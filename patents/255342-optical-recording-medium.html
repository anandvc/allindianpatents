				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a phase-change optical<br>
recording medium (such as, DVD-RW, DVD+RW or DVD-RAM)<br>
where the irradiation of laser beam causes optical changes to a<br>
recording material of a recording layer therefore information is<br>
recorded and reproduced; and the information is rewritable, and<br>
relates specifically to an optical recording medium having<br>
performance responsive to high-speed recording linear velocity,<br>
as well.<br>
Background Art<br>
Conventionally, in a phase-change optical recording<br>
medium where information is recorded and reproduced onto/from<br>
a recording layer and the information is rewritable, the recording<br>
layer contains four elements, Ag, In, Sb and Te, as primary<br>
components. The objective is to improve the recording linear<br>
velocity on the basis of stable signal processing, making it<br>
possible to stably perform recording and. reproducing at IX-speed<br>
to 4X-speed of a recording linear velocity of DVD-ROM (3.49 m/s),<br>
which is now commercially available.<br>
In the optical recording medium, the manner in which to<br><br>
conduct heat subtly changes depending upon an optical constant<br>
or film thickness of each layer laminated on a substrate, and may<br>
greatly affect the recording characteristic in a mark recorded on<br>
the recording layer, or reflectance or modulation factor may<br>
change. As in Patent Literature 1, the film thickness of each<br>
layer laminated onto a substrate, an optical constant of a<br>
crystalline phase and an amorphous phase in the recording layer,<br>
an optical constant regarding a protective layer and a reflective<br>
layer, and the condition for groove depth of a transparent<br>
substrate are important factors relating to recording<br>
characteristics and signal processing.<br>
In addition, in order to realize high-speed recording,<br>
recording must be performed with additionally higher power, so<br>
the storage reliability becomes more severe than in comparison<br>
with the conventional art. Using Ag having high thermal<br>
conductivity for a reflective layer binds with S in ZnS-SiO2 of a<br>
protective layer and Ag2S is formed, so it is necessary to establish<br>
a sulfidation prevention layer between the reflective layer and<br>
the protective layer. However, recording with higher power<br>
causes the easy occurrence of peeling-off with interference<br>
between the Ag reflective layer and the sulfidation prevention<br>
layer, leading to the problem that a disc defect easily occurs after<br>
repeated recording or after long-term storage in a severe<br><br>
environment.<br>
As a related well-known technology, Patent Literature 2<br>
discloses an invention where tantalum oxide, tantalum and<br>
nickel are used for an intermediate layer making contact with an<br>
Ag reflective layer, and Mw(SbzTe1-z)1-w provided that 0 ≤ w ≤ 0.3<br>
and 0.5 ≤ z ≤ 0.9, for a recording layer. However, the invention<br>
has different constituent elements from those in the sulfidation<br>
prevention layer of the present invention," and in addition,<br>
recording is performed at 2X-speed of CD (2.4 m/s), which is at a<br>
lower velocity, and lower density compared to those in the<br>
present invention.<br>
Further, Patent Literature 3 relating to the present<br>
application by the applicant discloses an invention where Si, SiC,<br>
Ge and GeCr are used for a sulfidation prevention layer making<br>
contact with an Ag reflective layer, and GaaGeBInySbSTee<br>
(provided that 0 
s 
different constituent elements from those in the sulfidation<br>
prevention layer of the present invention. In addition,<br>
recording is performed at 20 m/s at maximum, which is at a lower<br>
velocity compared to that of the present invention.<br>
Further, Patent Literature 4 discloses an invention where<br>
a recording lasher composed of GeSbln, and recording is performed<br><br>
at 2.4 m/s to 9.6 m/s, which is at a lower velocity compared to that<br>
in the present invention.<br>
The present invention is directed at providing a DVD+RW<br>
recordable at 6X-speed to 8X-speed of DVD-ROM (hereafter,<br>
simply referred to as '6X-speed to 8X-speed), and optical<br>
constants in a crystalline state and an amorphous state in a<br>
recording layer, and the groove condition to control high<br>
reflectance are studied; concurrently, the sulfidation prevention<br>
layer is also studied.<br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>

DVD+RW medium repeatedly recordable at a high linear velocity,<br>
20 m/s to 28 m/s (approximately 6X-speed to 8X-speed), and<br>
where recording characteristic and storage characteristic are also<br>
excellent. Further, the objective is to provide a DVD+RW<br><br>
medium where the reflectance of the recording layer is appropriately reduced.<br>
In addition, the objective is to provide a phase-change optical recording medium<br>
where it becomes difficult for disc defects to occur due to loose film to occur even<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The present invention is described hereafter.<br>
	In the optical recording medium of the present invention,<br>
a first protective layer; a recording layer composed of a<br>
phase-change recording material comprising at least four<br>
elements, Ga, Sb, Sn and Ge, and where a transfer linear velocity<br>
is 20 mg/s or faster; a second layer; and a reflective layer are<br>
 laminated onto a transparent substrate in this order. The<br>
transfer linear velocity is a physical quantity substituting a<br>
crystallization kinetic unique to each phase-change recording<br>
material, and herein, it indicates a velocity where the reflectance<br><br>
starts decreasing rapidly in the case of researching the scanning<br>
speed dependency of crystalline reflectance by irradiating a<br>
continuous light with 18 mW. If a phase-change recording<br>
material where the transfer linear velocity is 20 m/s or faster is<br>
 used, no amorphousness is occurred even though a light is<br>
continuously irradiated while the optical recording medium is<br>
rotated at less than 20 m/s. Further, if a phase-change<br>
recording material where the transfer linear speed is 30 m/s or<br>
slower is used, the amorphousness can be easily conducted at<br>
 approximately 6X-speed to 8X-speed of the recording linear<br>
velocity. If the transfer linear velocity becomes faster than this,<br>
the amorphousness becomes difficult and recording becomes<br>
difficult.<br>
As a recording material of the recording layer, a<br>
 phase-change recording material responsive to the recording<br>
linear velocity at approximately 6X-speed to 8X_speed is<br>
required.<br>
In the present invention, it is essential to record an<br>
amorphous mark more securely than the case of recording the<br>
 mark at lX-speed to 4X-speed, and for the absorption coefficient<br>
 in the crystalline state of the recording layer, the higher the<br>
better. However, if it is excessively high, the remaining heat is<br>
filled and characteristic deteriorates. Further, for the refractive<br><br>
index in the amorphous state, the greater the better. There is a<br>
report that it is desirable that the refractive index &amp; the<br>
extinction coefficient in the crystalline state and the refractive<br>
index &amp; the extinction coefficient in the amorphous state in the<br>
AglnSbTe-base phase-change recording material, which is a<br>
conventional phase-change recording material, are within the<br>
range of 2 to 4, 2 to 4, 2.5 to 4 and 2.5 to 3.5, respectively (Patent<br>
Literature l). As result of researching the GaSbSnGe-base<br>
phase-change recording material with reference to these findings<br>
by the inventors of the present application, the result shown in<br>
the below-described Table 1 was obtained. Furthermore,<br>
"as-depo optical constant" in the table is equivalent to the optical<br>
constant in the amorphous state.<br>
On the basis of the results in Table 1, in the present<br>
invention, when the wavelength of recording/reproducing light is<br>
within the range of 650 nm to 665 nm and the recording linear<br>
speed is 20 m/s to 28 m/s (approximately 6X-speed to 8X-speed), a<br>
phase-change recording material where the refractive index Nc &amp;<br>
the extinction coefficient Kc in the crystalline state and the<br>
refractive index Na &amp; the extinction coefficient Ka in the<br>
amorphous state in the recording layer are within the following<br>
ranges is used:<br>
2.0 ≤Nc ≤ 3.0<br><br>
4.0≤Kc≤5.0<br>
4.0 ≤ Na ≤5.0<br>
2.5 ≤Ka≤3.1<br>
Furthermore, when the wavelength of the<br>
recording/reproducing light is within the range of 650 nm to 665<br>
nm and the recording linear velocity is 20 m/s to 28 m/s<br>
(approximately 6X-speed to 8X-speed), the refractive index Nc &amp;<br>
the extinction coefficient Kc in the crystalline state and the<br>
refractive index Na &amp; the extinction coefficient Ka in the<br>
amorphous state in the recording layer can be measured as<br>
follows. Immediately after the preparation of the recording layer<br>
composed of the phase-change recording layer with 100 nm of<br>
thickness on a polycarbonate transparent substrate with 0.6 mm<br>
of thickness, Na and Ka in the amorphous state in the recording<br>
layer are measured by spectroellipsometry. Furthermore, after<br>
the initialization of the phase-change recording layer with an<br>
initializer, Na and Ka in the crystalline phase are measured by<br>
spectroellipsometry. The optical constants are measured by<br>
spectroellipsometry with a VASE and a WVASE32 software (J.A.<br>
Woollam Japan Co., Inc.). The initializer used here is a<br>
POP120-7AH (Hitachi Computer Peripherals Co., Ltd.). The<br>
conditions for the initialization are 900 mW of laser power, 11 m/s<br>
of linear velocity, and 37 p.m of head feed.<br><br>
Further, an element(s) other than the four elements, Ga,<br>
Sb, Sn and Ge, such as, Te, can be added to the optical recording<br>
medium of the present invention. For the added quantity of the<br>
element (atomic%), as long as the range is small to some extent,<br>
an effect on the above-mentioned refractive index and extinction<br>
coefficient is small, and the recording characteristic at<br>
high-speed recording, approximately at 6X-speed to 8X-speed,<br>
becomes excellent. The below-mentioned Table 2 shows the data<br>
in the case that the added element is Te, and it is clear that it is<br>
preferable to control the composition ratio at 5 atomic% or less.<br>
Preferably the total of contents of the four elements, Ga, Sb, Sn<br>
and Ge, in the recording layer is 95 atomic% or greater relative to<br>
all elements in the recording layer. Te contributes to the<br>
easiness of the initial crystallization. In addition, for the<br>
purpose of the improvement of various characteristics, other<br>
element, such as In, Zn, Ag or Cu, can be added.<br>
Further, the conventional AglnSbTe-base phase-change<br>
recording material is not suitable for high linear velocity<br>
recording because the crystallization kinetic is slow, so the<br>
amorphous mark cannot be accurately recorded at 6X-speed to<br>
8X-speed. Therefore, the development of a new phase-change<br>
recording material recordable at 6X-speed to 8X-speed is required.<br>
Up to the present, as a recording material, a three-element<br><br>
material, Ga, Sb and Sn, and the four-element material, Ga, Sb,<br>
Sn and Ge, have been developed. However, any material<br>
sufficiently responsive to recording at 6X-speed to 8X-speed has<br>
not been obtained yet. Then, the inventors of the present<br>
application have developed the phase-change recording material<br>
responsive to recording at approximately 6X-speed to 8X-speed by<br>
determining the composition ratio of each element within the<br>
range of several %.<br>
In other words, according to the research up to the present,<br>
it has been clear that because the crystallization kinetic of the<br>
SbSn compound is very fast, there is a possibility of realizing a<br>
high-speed recording medium with excellent recording sensitivity.<br>
However, the storage condition at room temperature is poor, so<br>
the SbSn compound cannot be independently used as a recording<br>
material. Then, if Ga or Ge is added, the amorphousness<br>
becomes easier and it results in easy recording. Ga and Ge have<br>
a function to slow the crystallization kinetic down, so the<br>
crystallization kinetic can be controlled to be responsive to the<br>
recording linear velocity at approximately 6X-speed to 8X-speed.<br>
Therefore, in the recording layer of the present invention,<br>
it is desirable to satisfy the following conditions regarding the<br>
composition ratio (atomic%) of the four elements, Ga, Sb, Sn and<br>
Ge, as a, 6, y and 8, respectively.<br><br>
2 ≤ a ≤ 11<br>
59≤B≤ 70<br>
17≤Y≤ 26<br>
2≤8 ≤ 12<br>
84 ≤ B + y ≤ 88<br>
a + B + y + 8 = 100<br>
In the above-mentioned conditions, if Sb is less than 59 %,<br>
the melting point becomes higher, so the sensitivity becomes poor,<br>
and if Sb exceeds 70 %, it becomes difficult to record an<br>
amorphous mark; thus excellent recording characteristics cannot<br>
be obtained. If Sn is less than 17 %, the crystallization kinetic<br>
starts slowing down, so the sensitivity becomes poor, and if Sn<br>
exceeds 26 %, the crystallization kinetic becomes excessively fast<br>
and it becomes difficult to become amorphous, so it is not<br>
preferable. If Ga or Ge is less than 2 %, the storage reliability<br>
deteriorates, and if Ga exceeds 11 % or Ge exceeds 12 %, the<br>
crystallization temperature becomes excessively high and the<br>
initial crystallization becomes difficult, so it is not preferable.<br>
In addition, if a total of Sb and Sn is less than 84 % or<br>
exceeds 88 %, it causes excessively slow or fast crystallization<br>
kinetic, respectively, so a recording layer suitable for recording at<br>
6X-speed to 8X-speed cannot be obtained. Examining the range<br>
of the total composition ratio of Sb to Sn where the recording<br><br>
characteristic at 8X-speed becomes excellent, as shown in Fig. 8,<br>
the recording characteristic becomes excellent when the total of<br>
Sb + Sn is within the range of 84 % to 88 %, and it has become<br>
clear that if the total is out of this range, the recording<br>
characteristic deteriorates. As described above, in order to<br>
securely perform the high-speed recording, not only providing the<br>
composition ratio of Sb to Sn independently, but it is also<br>
important to provide the range of the total composition ratio of Sb<br>
to Sn.<br>
Fig. 1 shows comparison data of the storage stability<br>
according to whether or not Ge is contained. As an example, in<br>
Ga11.9Sb73.1Sn15 (a line through the diamond points in the chart),<br>
which is phase-change recording material containing no Ge, the<br>
reflectance after the initialization decreases by 5.7 % after 100<br>
hours under the atmosphere at 85 % of humidity and 80 °C of<br>
temperature, so the crystal condition is changed and recording<br>
becomes difficult. Further, even after recording, the storage<br>
condition at a space region deteriorates and the jitter<br>
characteristic deteriorates. However, in Ga5Sb70Sn17Ge8 (a line<br>
through the square points in the chart), which is a phase-change<br>
recording material where Ge is added, the fluctuation is defused,<br>
so the reflectance after the initialization decreased by less than<br>
1.5 % even after 900 hours.<br><br>
Fig. 2 shows the storage characteristic of the<br>
GaSbSnGe-base phase-change recording material (jitter<br>
characteristic after 0 time, 10 times, 1000 times of overwriting<br>
(DOW0 (the line through the diamond points in the chart),<br>
DOW10 (the line through the square points in the chart) and<br>
DOW1000 (the line through the triangular points in the chart),<br>
respectively), and no jitter fluctuation occurs even after 900-hour<br>
storage.<br>
For the film thickness of the recording layer, the range of 5<br>
nm to 50 nm is desirable, and the range of 10 nm to 20 nm is more<br>
preferable. If the film thickness is thinner than 5 nm, defects<br>
caused by deterioration due to the repeated recording occur.<br>
Further, if the film thickness is thicker than 50 nm, jitter<br>
characteristics become poor.<br>
As the first protective layer material, transparent<br>
material where a light is efficiently transmitted through and the<br>
melting point is 1000 °C or higher is preferable. The oxide,<br>
nitride or sulfide is mainly used; among these, it is preferable to<br>
use a mixture of ZnS and Si02 where the internal stress and the<br>
absorbency index are small. Since ZnS has small thermal<br>
conductivity, the thermal diffusion during recording can be<br>
reduced, resulting in the increased recording sensitivity.<br>
However, ZnS changes to a crystal at the time of initialization or<br><br>
recording, deteriorating the stability of the recording layer, so a<br>
mixture with SiO2 inhibiting the crystallization of ZnS should be<br>
used. For the composition, it is preferable that ZnS : SiO2 = 60 :<br>
40 to 90 - 10 (mol %). In particular, it is preferable that ZnS :<br>
Si02 = 80 : 20 (mole ratio).<br>
For the film thickness, the range of 30 nm to 100 nm is<br>
desirable. If the film thickness is out of this range, it becomes<br>
difficult to certainly secure 60 % or greater modulation factor.<br>
Further, if the film, thickness becomes smaller than 30 nm,<br>
because the reflectance fluctuation according to the film<br>
thickness becomes greater, it becomes difficult to stably form the<br>
layer, and, if the film thickness becomes thicker than 100 nm, the<br>
deposition time becomes longer and the productivity of the<br>
optical recording medium decreases.<br>
As a second protective layer material, material having the<br>
same characteristics as that of the first protective layer is<br>
preferable.<br>
For the film thickness, the range of 3 nm to 15 nm is<br>
preferable. If the film thickness is less than 3 nm, defects, such<br>
as poor recording sensitivity or the reduction of modulation factor,<br>
may be encountered. If the film thickness is larger than 15 nm,<br>
there is excessive heat, and an amorphous mark becomes smaller<br>
due to the residual heat and the recording characteristic becomes<br><br>
poor.<br>
Metal material is used for the reflective layer, and metal<br>
material, such as Al, Ag, Au or Cu, or an alloy material of these<br>
metal materials, is often used.<br>
For the film thickness, the range of 100 nm to 300 nm is<br>
preferable. If the film thickness is less than 100 nm, heat<br>
radiation efficiency may be deteriolated. Furthermore, even if<br>
the film thickness is larger than 300 nm, the heat radiation<br>
efficiency will not be improved, but rather the thickness of the<br>
film become larger beyond necessity.<br>
In the aspect where the first protective layer and the<br>
second protective layer comprise a mixture of ZnS and Si02 and<br>
the reflective layer comprise Ag or alloy where Ag is a main<br>
component, it is preferable to additionally establish a sulfidation<br>
prevention layer between the second protective layer and the<br>
reflective layer.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a layer construction example of the optical<br>
recording medium of the present invention, and is a construction<br>
where a first protective layer 2 containing the mixture of ZnS and<br>
Si02, a recording layer 3, a second protective layer 4 containing<br>
the mixture of ZnS and SiO2, a sulfidation prevention layer 5 and<br>
a reflective layer 6 composed of Ag alloy are laminated in order<br>
onto a transparent substrate 1.<br><br>
A reversible phase transition between the crystal and<br>
amorphous states of the phase-change recording layer by the<br>
irradiation of a laser beam from the substrate side results in<br>
recording and erasure of information. DVD+RW is in the<br>
crystalline state before recording, and the irradiation of a<br>
modulated laser beam and quenching of the recording layer<br>
result in the formation of an amorphous mark. At this time, in<br>
order to directly perform the repeated recording of the<br>
amorphous mark, it is necessary to crystallize the amorphous<br>
mark in shorter period as recording speed increases: therefore, a<br>
phase-change recording material with fast crystallization kinetic<br>
is required. Further, if using a material with fast<br>
crystallization kinetic, re-crystallization progresses from the<br>
periphery of the amorphous mark immediately after the mark<br>
formation and the mark becomes smaller. In order to reduce the<br>
re-crystallization region, it is better to have a quenching<br>
structure where cooling velocity is fast, so it is preferable to use<br>
Ag or alloy where Ag is a main component, which has high<br>
thermal conductivity, for the reflective layer. Herein, the main<br>
component means contains 90 atomic% of Ag. Further, as an<br><br>
element forming alloy with Ag5 Cu, Pd, Ti, Cr and Ta are<br>
provided.<br>
However, Ag tends to migrate rapidly within a layer, and,<br><br>
in addition, it reacts with S to easily form Ag2S. Consequently,<br>
it is preferable to establish a sulfidation prevention layer. For<br>
the sulfidaition prevention layer, SiC or Si, which has been<br>
conventionally used, can be used. However, from viewpoints to<br>
improve the adhesion between the reflective layer and the<br>
sulfidation prevention layer and to prevent the generation of disc<br>
defects such as the formation of loose film even after repeated<br>
recording or the long-term storage in a severe environment, it is<br>
preferable to use a mixture of TiC and TiO. To achieve faster<br>
recording speed, larger recording power is required. Therefore, if<br>
the adhesion between the sulfidation prevention layer and<br>
ZnS-SiO2 or Ag is not strong enough, film peeling-off occurs<br>
easily after repeated recording, compared to the optical recording<br>
medium for low-speed recording. For SiC, since the coefficients<br>
of thermal expansion of Ag and SiC are markedly different from<br>
each other, the internal stress of the film increases upon the<br>
initialization or upon recording, and the film peeling-off may<br>
occur.<br>
Then, using the mixture of TiO, whose coefficient of<br>
thermal expansion is close to that of Ag, and which has good<br>
adhesion with Ag, and TiC, which has an effect to prevent the Ag<br>
dispersion, for the sulfidation prevention layer between the Ag<br>
reflective layer and the second protective layer and combining<br><br>
with the above-mentioned recording layer enable the provision of<br>
an optical recording medium where the modulation factor is great,<br>
and suitable to high-speed recording, and where the storage<br>
stability is more excellent.<br>
Further, setting the total film thickness of the second<br>
protective layer and the sulfidation prevention layer at 7 nm to<br>
20 nm enables the provision of the optical recording medium with<br>
a greater modulation factor. More preferably, setting the total<br>
film thickness of the above-mentioned two layers at 7 nm to 15<br>
nm enables excellent repeated recording characteristics. In<br>
high-speed recording, the cooling velocity of the recording layer<br>
greatly changes of recording characteristics, so the total film<br>
thickness of the second protective layer and the sulfidation<br>
prevention layer, which are interposed "between the reflective<br>
layer and the recording layer greatly affecting the cooling<br>
velocity, is important.<br>
It is preferable that the composition of the sulfidation<br>
prevention layer be (TiC)p(TiO)ioo-P and 50 ≤ p ≤ 80 ('p' is % by<br>
mass). When 'p' is 80 or less, a greater modulation factor can be<br>
obtained, and when 'p' is 50 or greater, excellent repeated<br>
recording characteristics can be obtained. The greater 'p'<br>
becomes, the greater the thermal conductivity becomes.<br>
However, if the thermal conductivity of the sulfidation<br><br>
prevention layer is excessively great, the modulation factor<br>
becomes smaller, and if the thermal conductivity is excessively<br>
small, heating occurs and the repeated recording characteristic<br>
becomes especially poor. The thermal conductivity and the<br>
difference of film thickness of the layers interposed between the<br>
reflective layer and the recording layer especially affect the<br>
high-speed recording, so if these are not within an appropriate<br>
range, respectively., excellent recording characteristics where<br>
rewritable optical disc system can be realized cannot be obtained.<br>
Further, a layer composed of a mixture of ZrO2, Y2O3, and<br>
T102 can be established between the second protective layer and<br>
the sulfidation prevention layer with 2 nm to 8 nm of thickness.<br>
If using a mixture of TiC and TiO for the sulfidation prevention<br>
layer, even though the modulation factor can easily become<br>
smaller compared to the case of using SiC, the establishment of<br>
the above-mentioned mixture layer increass the modulation<br>
factor. For the composition, it is preferable to mix 60 mol % or<br>
greater of ZrO2 and 10 mol % or greater of TiO2.<br>
Further, it is preferable to establish an interface layer<br>
composed of Si02 with 2 nm to 4 nm of thickness between the first<br>
protective layer and the phase-change recording layer. This<br>
reduces damage to a substrate when recording is performed at<br>
high power, so the repeated recording characteristic in the high<br><br>
power recording becomes excellent, and the recording power<br>
margin can be widened. If the thickness is less than 2 nm, it<br>
becomes difficult to form a uniform Si02 layer, and if the<br>
thickness exceeds 4 nm, the recording sensitivity becomes poor<br>
and the modulation factor diminishes.<br>
For the transparent substrate, a plastic substrate is<br>
generally used. As the plastic substrate, as long as it has<br>
transparency and it excels in planar accuracy, there is no special<br>
limitation. Any substrate, which has been conventionally used<br>
as a transparent substrate for an optical recording medium, can<br>
be optionally selected and used. As a typical example, a glass<br>
plate and a polycarbonate plate are provided. Concerning the<br>
optical constant, it is preferable that the refractive index be 1.5<br>
to 1.6.<br>
In addition, it is preferable that the transparent substrate<br>
has a wobbled groove with 0.74 ± 0.03 urn of track pitch, 22 nm to<br>
40 nm of groove depth and 0.2 p.m to 0.3 p.m of groove width. As<br>
a purpose of having the wobbled groove, there are the access to an<br>
unrecorded specific track and the rotation of the substrate at a<br>
constant linear velocity. The optical recording medium of the<br>
present invention is produced for the purpose of enabling<br>
response to the recording at approximately 6X-speed to 8X-speed.<br>
Sn is added to a GaSb'base material for the purpose of improving<br><br>
the recording characteristic and accelerating the crystallization<br>
kinetic. However, it should be noted that the effect of Sn<br>
contained in the recording layer causes increased reflectance.<br>
For example, as a result of researching about the optical<br>
recording medium of the present invention where the groove<br>
depth of the transparent substrate is 20 nm, the film thickness of<br>
the first protective layer is 30 nm to 100 am, the film thickness of<br>
the recording layer is 5 nm to 50 nm, the film thickness of the<br>
second protective layer is 3 nm to 15 nm, the film thickness of the<br>
reflective layer is 100 nm to 300 nm and the relative composition<br>
ratios of the four elements in the recording layer fulfill the<br>
above-mentioned requirement, it has become clear that the<br>
reflectance at an unrecorded region (crystalline substance)<br>
becomes within the range of 26 % to 32 %. However, if<br>
comparing this reflectance with reflectance at lX-speed to<br>
4X-speed of DVD+RW, which is a conventional phase-change<br>
optical recording medium, it is unnecessarily high. Therefore,<br>
taking the compatibility into consideration, it is necessary to<br>
adjust the reflectance by reduction.<br>
Therefore, the conditions of the transparent substrate<br>
having the wobbled groove with 0.74 ± 0.03 µm of track pitch, 22<br>
nm to 40 nm of the groove depth and 0.2 µm to 0.3 µm of groove<br>
width are adopted. For example, researching about the<br><br>
transparent substrate by setting the groove depth at 37 nm, the<br>
reflectance could be reduced by approximately 2 % to 3 %. In the<br>
DVD disc having track pitch at 0.74 ± 0.03 am, a push-pull signal<br>
is mainly extracted as a signal used for detecting a tracking error.<br>
For the push-pull signal, at 660 nm of laser wavelength used for a<br>
DVD, the greatest signal intensity can be obtained if using the<br>
above-mentioned transparent substrate when the groove depth is<br>
55 nm. In order to adjust the reflectance to be low and to<br>
increase the amplitude of an error signal, for the groove depth,<br>
the deeper the better. However, also taking the recording<br>
characteristic into consideration, it is preferable that the groove<br>
depth is within the range of 22 nm to 40 nm. Further, taking the<br>
recording characteristic and the signal characteristic into<br>
consideration, it has become clear that it is desirable for the<br>
groove width to be within 0.2 µm to 0.3 µm.<br>
The present invention can provide a DVD+RW medium<br>
that enables the repeated recording at 20 m/s to 28 m/s<br>
(approximately 6X-speed to 8X-speed), and where the recording<br>
characteristic and storage characteristic are also excellent, and<br>
in addition, a DVD+RW where the reflectance of the recording<br>
layer is appropriately reduced.<br>
Hereafter, the present invention is more specifically<br>
described using Examples and Comparative Examples. However,<br><br>
the present invention will not be limited by these Examples.<br>
[Examples A-l to A-7 and Comparative Examples A-8 to A-19]<br>
Discs where the first protective layer ZnS-Si02 with 60 nm<br>
of thickness, the recording layer composed of the phase-change<br>
recording material shown in Table 1 with 16 nm of thickness, the<br>
second protective layer ZnS_Si02 with 7 nm of thickness, the<br>
sulfidation prevention layer SiC with 4 nm of thickness and the<br>
reflective layer Ag with 140 nm of thickness were laminated in<br>
this order on a polycarbonate transparent substrate having 0.74<br>
p,m of track pitch, 27 nm of groove depth and 0.27 µm of groove<br>
width were prepared. These discs were initialized using an<br>
initializer for a phase-change disc, and a DVD+RW disc was<br>
obtained. For the initialization, an optical head with 48 nm of<br>
beam width was used, and crystallization was conducted under<br>
the conditions with 1300 mW of power (herein, it is power<br>
consumption of LD, and this is different from an irradiation<br>
power), 18.5 m/s of scanning speed and 30 µm/rotation of feed.<br>
The recording layers of the above-mentioned discs are all<br>
composed of the GaSbSnGe-base material with various optical<br>
constants having sufficient transfer linear velocity at 20 m/s or<br>
faster. For these discs, the recording linear velocity was set at<br>
6X-speed (20.9 m/s) and 8X-speed (27.9 m/s), and whether or not<br>
excellent recording characteristics could be obtained was<br><br>
examined. Recording was performed by repeating the intensity<br>
modulation, with 2T cycle recording strategic having three levels<br>
(Pp &gt; Pe &gt; Pb), peak power 'Pp1 for the purpose of forming an<br>
amorphous mark, bottom power 'Pb' for the purpose of providing<br>
a quenching efficacy and erasure power 'Pe' for the purpose of<br>
forming crystalline substance and erasing the information. A<br>
pulse generator is DTG-5274 manufactured by Tektronix<br>
Japan,Ltd., and the set resolving power is 3.348352 GHz. The<br>
evaluation device for this recording is DDU-1000 manufactured<br>
by Pulstec Industrial Co., Ltd and the specifications of the<br>
recording power are 40 mw with Pp at maximum and 18 mW with<br>
Pe at maximum. The peak power Pb was fixed at 0.1 mW and<br>
recording was performed. Numerical values used for criteria for<br>
the purpose of determining appropriateness of the recording<br>
characteristic are "Data to Clock Jitter (hereafter, referred to as<br>
DC jitter)"' and "modulation factor". The DC jitter is digitization<br>
of the gap of ends between the window 'Tw' upon reproducing at<br>
IX speed (corresponding mark length is approximately 0.1333<br>
µm) and nine types of marks regarding the window width Tw as<br>
unit (3Tw to 11Tw marks), and it means that the smaller the<br>
value becomes, the better the characteristic becomes. The<br>
modulation factor indicates how much the difference of the<br>
reflectance between a crystalline substance and an amorphous<br><br>
substance is occupied relative to the reflectance of the crystalline<br>
substance. Since the greater difference of the crystalline<br>
substance can be easily binarized, for the modulation factor, the<br>
greater the better. The evaluation criteria are as follows, and<br>
the numerical values are values after 10 times of overwriting<br>

With respect to discs in Example A'2 and the<br>
below-mentioned Examples A-20 to A-23, the recording<br>
characteristics were compared.<br>
For the discs in Examples A-2, A-20 and A-21, Fig. 4 shows<br>
the compared result of the DC jitter after DOW10 at 8X-speed in<br>
the case of changing the peak power (Example A-2- the line<br>
through the triangular points, Example A-20: the line through<br>
the diamond points, and Example A-21- the line through the<br>
rectangular points), and Table 1 shows the result in Examples<br>
A-22 andA-23.<br>
The recording characteristic of the disc in Example A-2 (Sb<br>
+ Sn = 81.8 atomic%) was evaluated, and the bottom jitter after<br>
DOW10 at 6X-speed and 8X-speed was 8.9 % and 13.9 %,<br>
respectively.<br>

(Sb + Sn = 90 atomic%, Nc = 2.35, Kc = 5.00, Na = 4.29, Ka = 3.09),<br>
and the recording characteristics were evaluated. The bottom<br>
jitter after DOW10 at 6X-speed and 8X-speed was 14.5 % and<br>
13.7 %, respectively.<br>
[Example A-22]<br>
A disc was prepared similarly to Example A-l except for<br>
changing the phase-change recording material to<br>
Ga11Sb64Sn2oGe5 (Sb + Sn = 84 atomic%, Nc = 2.61, Kc = 4.32, Na<br>

evaluated. The bottom jitter after DOW10 at 6X_speed and<br>

and the recording characteristics were evaluated. The bottom<br>
jitter after DOW10 at 6X-speed and 8X-speed was 8.2 % and 8.8 %,<br><br>
respectively; thus excellent characteristics were obtained.<br><comparison of jitter modulation factor and reflectance></comparison>
according to groove depth&gt;<br>
With respect to each disc in Examples A-3, A-24 and A-25,<br>
Fig. 5 to Fig. 7 show the comparison results of the DC jitter, the<br>
modulation factor and the reflectance in the case of changing the<br>
peak power (Example A-3 (groove depth: 27 nm): the line through<br>
the rectangular points, Example A-24 (groove depth: 37 nm)'- the<br>
line through the diamond points, Example A-25 (groove depth: 42<br>
nm): the line through the triangular points), respectively.<br>
The bottom jitter of the disc in Example A-3 after DOW10<br>
at 6X-speed and 8X-speed shown in Table 1 was 8.0 % and 8.4 %,<br>
respectively, and the modulation factor was also excellent, which<br>
was 61.5 %, and the reflectance at an unrecorded region (R14H)<br>
at that time was 26.5 %.<br>
[Example A-24]<br>
A disc was prepared similarly to Example A-3 except for<br>
changing the groove depth of the substrate, to 37 nm, and the<br>
recording characteristics were evaluated. The bottom jitter<br>
after DOW10 at 6X-speed and 8X-speed was 8.2 % and 8.6 %,<br>
respectively, and the modulation factor was excellent, which was<br>
61.7 %, and the reflectance at an unrecorded region (R14H) at<br><br>
that time was 24.4 %.<br>
[Example A-25]<br>
A disc was prepared similarly to Example A-3 except for<br>
changing the groove depth of the substrate to 42 nm, and the<br>
recording characteristics were evaluated. The bottom jitter<br>
after DOW10 at 6X-speed and 8X-speed was 9.7 % and 10.2 %,<br>
respectively, so both showed slight deterioration, and the<br>
modulation factor was 61.6 % and the reflectance at an<br>
unrecorded region (B.14H) at that time was 22.1 %. Although<br>
lower reflectance could be obtained, the recording characteristics<br>
had slightly deteriorated.<br>
[Example A-26]<br>
A disc was prepared similarly to Example A-l except for<br>
changing the phase-change recording material to<br>
Ga7Sb68Sn15Ge6Te4, and the recording characteristics were<br>
evaluated. The result is shown in Table 2.<br>
[Example A-27]<br>
A disc was prepared similarly to Example A-l except for<br>
changing the phase-change recording material to<br>
Ga5Sbt68Sn15Ge7Te5, and the recording characteristics were<br>
evaluated. The result is shown in Table 2.<br>
[Example A-28]<br><br>
A disc was prepared similarly to Example A-l except for<br>
changing the phase-change recording material to<br>
Ga3Sh68Sn15Ge8Te6, and the recording characteristics were<br>
evaluated. The result is shown in Table 2.<br>
[Example A-29]<br>
A disc was prepared similarly to Example A_l except for<br>
changing the phase-change recording inaterial to<br>
Ga3Sb67Sn14Ge8Te8, and the recording characteristics were<br>
evaluated. The result is shown in Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
As it is clear from the above-mentioned Table 2, Nc<br>
exceeded 3.0 in Comparative Examples A-28 andA-29, and<br>
preferable results could not be obtained for both the jitter and<br>
the modulation factor.<br>
According to the above-mentioned Examples and<br>
Comparative Examples, it has been demonstrated that using the<br>
GaSbSnGe-base phase-change recording layer material having<br>
optical constants provided in the present invention enables<br>
recording at 6 X-speed to 8X-speed of recording linear veloCitY.<br>
Further, according to Examples A-2 and A-20 to A_23, it is clear<br>
that if the total composition ratio of Sb to Sn is within the range<br>
of 84 ≤6 +. y ≤ 88, further excellent recording characteristic and<br>
storage stability can be obtained.<br>
Further, according to Examples A-3, A-24 and A-25, in the<br>
case that the transparent substrate has a wobbled groove with<br>
0.74 ± 0.03 µm of track pitch, 22 nm to 40 nm of groove depth and<br>
0.2 µm to 0.3 µm of groove width, it is clear that while excellent<br>
recording characteristics are maintained, the reflectance can be<br>
controlled to be low.<br>
(Examples B-l to B-7)<br><br>
The first protective layer, the phase-change recording<br>
layer, the second protective layer, the sulfidation prevention<br>
layer and the reflective layer were deposited in order onto a<br><br>
polycarbonate substrate with 0.74 µm of track pitch, 27 nm of<br>
groove depth, 12 cm of diameter and 0.6 mm of thickness<br>
according to the sputtering method.<br>
For the first protective layer, (ZnS)8o(Si02)2o (mol %) was<br>
used as a target and the film thickness was set at 60 nm.<br>
For the phase-change recording layer, Sn18Sb68Ga5Ge9<br>
(atomic%), Nc = 2.33, Kc = 4.88, Na = 4.45, Ka = 2.89, was used as<br>
a target and the film thickness was set at 16 nm.<br>
For the second protective layer, (ZnS)80(Si02)20 (mol %)<br>
was used as a target and the film thickness was set as shown in<br>
Table 3.<br>
For the sulfidation prevention layer, (TiC)7o(TiO)3o<br>
(mass %) was used as a target and the film thickness was set as<br>
shown in Table 3.<br>
For the reflective layer, Ag was used as a target and the<br>
film thickness was set at 180 nm.<br>
Subsequently, after applying acrylic-base cured resin<br>
(SD318 manufactured by Dainippon Ink and Chemicals,<br>
Incorporated) with 8 µm of thickness onto the reflective layer<br>
according to the spin coating method, the film was cured by<br>
ultraviolet ray in an N2 atmosphere and a resin protective layer<br>
was formed.<br>
In addition, another polycarbonate substrate with 12 cm of<br><br>
diameter and 0.6 mm of thickness was bonded onto the resin<br>
protective layer using an adhesive, and a disc-shaped optical<br>
recording medium was obtained.<br>
Subsequently, the optical recording medium was<br>
initialized using an initializer (POP120-7AH manufactured by<br>
Hitachi Computer Peripherals Co., Ltd.) having a laser head<br>
where a focusing function was added to a. laser beam with 830 nm<br>
of output wavelength, approximately 1 µm of width, 75 µm of<br>
length and 2W of maximum output. Fixed initialization<br>
conditions were 1500 mW of laser output, 20 m/s of scanning<br>
speed and 50 µm of head feed.<br><br>
With respect to the optical recording media prepared as<br>
mentioned above, recording and reproducing were evaluated<br>
using the optical disc evaluating device (DDU-1000<br><br>
manufactured by Pulstec Industrial Co., Ltd) having a pickup<br>
with 650 nm of wavelength and 0.65 of NA. The recording linear<br>
velocity was set at 28 m/s (equivalent to 8X-speed of DVD), the<br>
jitter (data to clock jitter: a value where 'a' is standardized with<br>
detection window width 'Tw') when repeatedly recording the<br>
random pattern 10 times with EFM + modulation method and the<br>
modulation factor are shown in Table 4. The recording strategy<br>
was optimized, and reproducing was all performed at 3.5 m/s of<br>
linear velocity with 0.7 mW of power.<br><br>
As it is clear from Table 4, in the case that the total film<br>
thickness of the first protective layer and the sulfidation<br>
prevention layer is especially 7 nm to 20 nm, 60 % or greater<br>
modulation factor, which is a standard value for DVD-ROM, could<br>
be obtained. In addition, in the case that the total film<br><br>
thickness is 7 nm to 15 nm, the jitter after 10 times of repeated<br>
recording was within 9 %, which is a standard value; thus<br>
preferable repeated recording characteristics could be obtained.<br>
In the case that the total film thickness was less than 7 nm, the<br>
modulation factor was small and the jitter was 9 % or greater.<br>
This was because heat was not sufficiently applied to the<br>
recording layer, the fused region was narrow, and the formed<br>
mark was small. Further, in the case that the total film<br>
thickness exceeded 20 nm, the modulation factor was also small<br>
and the jitter was also 9 % or greater, because even though the<br>
fused region was wide, the period of time to be maintained in the<br>
temperature range where re-crystallization occurs was long, so<br>
re-crystallization progressed.from the periphery of the mark, and<br>
as a result, the formed mark became small.<br>
In addition, after storing each of the above-mentioned<br>
optical recording media for 100 hours in an environment of 80 °<br>
and 85 % RH, the optical recording media were visually observed<br>
by holding each of them to a lamp, and no pinhole generation was<br>
confirmed in any of them.<br>
Furthermore, the transfer linear velocity of the recording<br>
medium in Example B-l was 28 m/s.<br>
(Examples B-8 to B-12)<br>
Disc-shaped optical recording media were prepared<br><br>
similarly to Example 1 except for changing the phase-change<br>
recording material to Sn13Sb72Ga7Ge8, Nc = 2.21, Kc = 4.97, Na =<br>
4.36, Ka =: 2.98, setting the film thickness of the first protective<br>
layer at 8 nm and the film thickness of the sulfidation prevention<br>
layer at 5 nm, and changing the composition of the sulfidation<br>
prevention layer to that shown in Table 5.<br>
With respect to these optical recording media, recording<br>
and reproducing were evaluated using the optical evaluating<br>
device (DDU-1000 manufactured by Pulstec Industrial Co., Ltd)<br>
having a pickup with 650 nm of wavelength and 0.65 of NA. The<br>
recording linear velocity was set at 28 m/s (equivalent to<br>
8X-speed of DVD), and the modulation factor upon repeatedly<br>
recording a random pattern 10 times with EFM + modulation<br>
method and the jitter upon repeatedly recording 1,000 times were<br>
examined. If the jitter was greater than 9 %, the optical<br>
recording medium was graded as B, and if the jitter is 9 % or less,<br>
the medium was graded A, and the result is shown in Table 5.<br>
As it is clear from Table 5, in the case that TiC was 80 (%<br>
by mass) or less, the modulation factor after DOW10 was 60 % or<br>
greater. Further, in the case that TiC was 40 (% by mass), the<br>
modulation factor was greater, but the jitter after DOW1000 was<br>
9 % or greater.<br>
Furthermore, the transfer linear velocity of the recording<br><br><br>
(Example B-13)<br>
Disc-shaped optical recording media were prepared<br>
similarly to Example B-3 except for changing the phase-change<br>
recording material to SnaoSbssGasGeio (Nc = 2.43, Kc = 4.80, Na =<br>
4.40, Ka -- 2.78 and the transfer linear velocity = 26 m/s).<br>
With respect to this optical recording medium, recording<br>
and reproducing were evaluated using the optical disc evaluating<br>
device (DDU-1000 manufactured by Pulstec Industrial Co., Ltd)<br>
having a pickup with 650 nm of wavelength and 0.65 of NA. The<br>
recording linear velocity was set at 28 m/s (equivalent to<br>
8X_speed of DVD), and it was optimized with 32 mW of recording<br><br>
power Pw, 0.1 mW of bottom power Pb, and 5 mW to 10 mW of<br>
erasing power Pe. A random pattern was repeatedly recorded<br>
with EFM + modulation method and the jitter (data to clock<br>
jitter: a value where 'a' was standardization with detection<br><br>
window width. 'Tw') was evaluated. The recording strategy was<br>
optimized, and reproducing was all performed at 3.5 m/s of linear<br>
velocity with 0.7 mW of power.<br>
In addition, after this optical recording medium was<br>
stored for 100 hours in an environment of 80 °C and 85 % RH,<br>
recording was performed under the same condition. Each result<br>
is shown in Fig. 9 (before the storage test: the line through the<br>
rectangular points, after storage test: the line through the<br>
diamond points).<br>
As it is clear from Fig. 9, even after 100-hour storage in an<br>
environment of 80° and 85% RH, no great jitter deterioration was<br>
confirmed. The optical recording medium after this storage test<br>
was visually observed by holding it to a lamp; however, no<br>
pinhole generation was confirmed.<br>
(Example B-14)<br>
A disc-shaped optical recording medium was prepared<br>
similarly to Example B-13 except for changing the phase-change<br>
recording material to Sn20Sb65Ga3Ge7Te5, (atomic%), Nc = 2.50, Kc<br>
= 4.80, Na = 4.35, Ka = 2.68, the transfer linear velocity = 24 m/s,<br>
and changing the film thickness of the second protective layer to<br>
10 nm. Recording was performed similarly to Example B-13,<br>
and the jitter after DOWl was improved more than that in<br>
Example B-13. It is considered that because the addition of Te<br><br>
resulted in the uniform initial crystallization, the jitter rise after<br>
DOW1 was diminished.<br>
In addition, after this optical recording medium was<br>
stored for 100 hours in an environment of 80 °C and 85 % RH,<br>
recording was performed under the same condition. Each result<br>
is shown in Fig. 10 (before the storage test: the line through the<br>
rectangular points, after storage test'- the line through the<br>
diamond points).<br>
As it is clear from Fig. 10, even after 100-hour storage in<br>
an environment of 80 °C and 85% RH, no great jitter<br>
deterioration was confirmed. The optical recording medium<br>

in Examples B-13.<br>

thickness of the first protective layer to 58 nm, establishing an<br>
Si02 layer with 2 nm of film thickness between the first<br>
protective layer and the phase-change recording layer, changing<br>
the phase-change recording material to Sn14Sb68Ga10Ge8<br>
(atomic%) (Nc = 2.38, Kc = 4.87, Na = 4.38, Ka = 2.55, and the<br>
