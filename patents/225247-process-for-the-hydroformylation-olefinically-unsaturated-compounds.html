				<td>Process for the hydroformylation of olefinically unsaturated compounds<br>
The invention relates to an improved process for the hydroformyiation of<br>
oiefinically unsaturated compounds in the presence of an aqueous catalyst<br>
solution comprising water-soluble rhodium complexes by use of a reaction<br>
column as reactor.<br>
The reaction of compounds containing olefinic double bonds with carbon<br>
monoxide and hydrogen is the customary industrial method of preparing<br>
aldehydes (oxo process).<br>
The process is not restricted to the use of olefinic hydrocarbons, but can<br>
be extended to starting materials which not only have a double bond but<br>
also bear functional groups, predominantly groups which remain<br>
unchanged under the reaction conditions.<br>
The classical oxo process employs cobalt as catalyst. Its effectiveness is<br>
based on the formation of cobalt carbonyl compounds by action of<br>
hydrogen and carbon monoxide at pressures above 20 MPa and<br>
temperatures of about 120°C and more on metallic cobalt or cobalt<br>
compounds.<br>
In the last 30 years, cobalt has increasingly been replaced by rhodium as<br>
catalyst. The platinum metal is used as a complex which comprises,<br>
preferably, phosphenes as ligands in addition to carbon monoxide. The<br>
use of rhodium as catalyst allows the process to be carried out at lower<br>
pressures and, in addition, higher yields are achieved and the unbranched<br>
products which are more valuable for further processing are preferentially<br>
formed if straight-chain terminal olefins are used as starting materials.<br>
A further refinement of the oxo process comprises the transition from<br>
catalysts which are homogeneously dissolved in the reaction medium, i.e.<br>
in the starting material and in the reaction product, to aqueous catalyst<br>
solutions which are present as a separate phase in addition to that formed<br>
by the starting material and reaction product. This variant of the reaction is<br>
described, for example, in DE B-26 27 354. Its particular advantage is that<br>
the reaction product and the catalyst can readily be separated under mild<br>
conditions without use of thermal process steps, so that losses which occur<br>
as a result of further reactions of the aldehydes formed are avoided.<br>
Furthermore, very high yields are achieved and, when using unbranched<br>
terminal olefins, the aldehydes obtained are very predominantly n-<br>
aldehydes.<br>
In practice, the oxo process using an aqueous catalyst phase is usually<br>
carried out in stirred reactors which have initially been charged with a<br>
solution of the catalyst system in water. Olefinically unsaturated<br>
compounds and synthesis gas are introduced into the reaction vessel and<br>
reacted with one another with intimate mixing. The reaction product leaves<br>
the reactor together with aqueous catalyst solution, unreacted starting<br>
materials (synthesis gas, olefin) and hydrogenation products of the<br>
olefinically unsaturated compounds via an immersed tube. The gas phase,<br>
essentially synthesis gas, olefin and saturated hydrocarbon formed from<br>
the olefin, is separated from the liquid products in a separation vessel and<br>
recirculated to the reactor. Part of the circulating gas is freed of the<br>
condensable reaction products in a condenser and is discharged into the<br>
waste gas system.<br>
The liquid separated off in the separation vessel is passed to a phase<br>
separator. Here, the crude organic reaction product separates from the<br>
aqueous catalyst phase. While the organic reaction product is conveyed<br>
via a pump to a stripping column, a further pump conveys the aqueous<br>
catalyst phase back to the reactor with the heat of the exothermic reaction<br>
being removed in a heat exchanger and used to generate process steam.<br>
Water can be fed to the reactor together with the cooled catalyst solution to<br>
compensate water losses which occur via the waste gas and via the oxo<br>
product. The crude oxo product introduced into the stripping column is<br>
conveyed in countercurrent to part of the synthesis gas which in this way<br>
becomes laden with the olefin dissolved in the crude product. The<br>
preheated synthesis gas/olefin mixture is fed to the reactor. A further<br>
substream of synthesis gas is preheated in a heat exchanger using<br>
process heat. The fresh olefin is also preheated and vaporized in a heat<br>
exchanger by means of waste heat from the aldehyde distillation before it<br>
enters the reactor, while the crude oxo product from the stripping column is<br>
passed directly without cooling to the distillation. Finally, a buffer vessel for<br>
temporary storage of product is provided in case of a malfunction in the<br>
plant.<br>
In an industrially particularly advantageous embodiment of a production<br>
plant for carrying out the oxo process, synthesis gas and olefin are<br>
introduced via double roses which serve as predistributors into the reactor<br>
in which the aqueous catalyst solution is present. The fine dispersion of the<br>
reactants in the reaction mixture is achieved by means of a sparging stirrer.<br>
To remove the heat of reaction, the reactor is provided with a cooling<br>
matrix. The liquid and gaseous components ascend through a guide tube<br>
in the reactor and separate at its upper end. The gas is either recirculated<br>
into the reactor or discharged from the reaction system as offgas. The<br>
aqueous catalyst solution separates from the crude, organic product. The<br>
crude product is introduced into a stripping column, freed of dissolved<br>
olefins by means of the synthesis gas passed through the stripping column<br>
in countercurrent and finely fractionated into its components in a column.<br>
The heat required for the distillation is obtained directly via the cooling<br>
matrix. For this purpose, the liquid aldehyde from the bottom of the column<br>
is introduced via a phase separator into the cooling matrix in which it<br>
vaporizes and it is then conveyed in vapor form via the phase separator<br>
back into the column.<br>
The above-described apparatus for carrying out the oxo process using an<br>
aqueous catalyst phase has given excellent service in industrial practice.<br>
However, there is interest in further optimizing the process. This is an<br>
object of the present invention. Specifically, the invention has the object of<br>
improving the economics by changing the way in which the process is<br>
carried out and/or by simplifying the apparatus employed in the process.<br>
Further objects are to increase the conversion and the yield of desired<br>
product and to improve safety.<br>
The invention provides a process for the hydroformylation of ofefinically<br>
unsaturated compounds in a heterogeneous reaction system using a<br>
catalyst consisting of an aqueous solution comprising complexes of<br>
rhodium with water-soluble organic phosphorus(lll) compounds as ligands<br>
and, if desired, excess water-soluble organic phosphorus(lll) compounds,<br>
at pressures of from 0.4 to 10 MPa and temperatures of from 50 to 180°C.<br>
According to the present invention, the reaction of the reactants is carried<br>
out in a reaction column.<br>
Apart from carrying out the reaction between olefinic compound and<br>
synthesis gas in a heterogeneous reaction system using an aqueous<br>
catalyst phase, it is an essential feature of the invention that the reaction is<br>
carried out in a reaction column as reactor.<br>
The differences between the novel process and the processes customary<br>
hitherto which have a stirred tank as central apparatus of the reaction plant<br>
are conspicuous. Apart from further changes, the mixing of the reactants<br>
and the catalyst solution without use of a stirrer and the absence of a<br>
separate stripping apparatus for recovering the olefin dissolved in the<br>
product are of particular significance.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the term reaction columns refers<br>
to the apparatuses used, in particular, for distillation, rectification and<br>
extraction in chemical engineering. As hydroformylation reactors, they are<br>
provided with feed openings for the reactants and the catalyst solution and<br>
with devices for taking off product, catalyst solution and offgas. As reaction<br>
columns, it is possible to use the various types of column which are widely<br>
used in industrial practice, in particular tray columns and columns with<br>
ordered packing or random packing elements. In these, the catalyst<br>
solution is fed in at the top of the column, advantageously onto the<br>
uppermost tray of the column. Below the top of the column, preferably in<br>
the upper region (i.e. in the upper half) of the column, the olefinic<br>
compound is fed into the reactor. Catalyst solution, olefin and reaction<br>
product, which travel downward in the interior of the column, flow in<br>
countercurrent to the ascending synthesis gas introduced at the bottom of<br>
the column. Reaction product and catalyst solution are taken off in the<br>
lower part (the lower half) of the reactor, while the gaseous components<br>
leave the column in its upper region.<br>
The reactants and catalyst solution do not have to be introduced into the<br>
reactor at one feed point each. It is thus not necessary for the total amount<br>
of olefin to be introduced entirely at one point and in the upper region and<br>
the total amount of synthesis gas to flow into the reaction space only at the<br>
bottom of the reaction column. Rather, the reactants can be introduced at<br>
different points along the column. The number of feed points can be up to<br>
the number of separation stages of the column. Equipping the reactor with<br>
a plurality of feed lines for the individual participants in the reaction allows it<br>
to be matched individually to the requirements of the respective reaction,<br>
e.g. with regard to the reactivity of the olefin used, the desired reaction<br>
rate, the completeness of the conversion and the desired composition of<br>
the reaction product. Merely by way of example, the reactivity of the olefin<br>
will be examined in more detail. In the case of olefins which react quickly, a<br>
larger amount of olefin will be able to be fed to the reactor than in the case<br>
of relatively unreactive olefins, so that the reactive unsaturated<br>
hydrocarbons are introduced into the reactor via not only one feed line but<br>
via a plurality of feed lines. This opportunity of varying the streams also<br>
allows the same reactor to be used for reacting various starting materials.<br>
The introduction of catalyst solution at various points along the reactor will<br>
be restricted to special cases, e.g. to maintain the required catalyst<br>
concentration in the case of increased catalyst consumption caused by<br>
impurities in the starting materials or else to control the temperature by<br>
removing heat of reaction from the reactor. Below the top of the reactor, it<br>
is possible to feed the catalyst solution into the column either separately<br>
from the olefin or together with the olefin.<br>
Use of a reaction column instead of a stirred tank as reactor is also<br>
advantageous because a plurality of separation stages (e.g. column trays)<br>
are connected in series in the column. The series arrangement of a<br>
plurality of separation stages in the column has the effect of converting the<br>
characteristics of a stirred tank into the characteristics of a cascade of<br>
stirred tanks. Olefin and synthesis gas react with one another in the<br>
presence of the catalyst solution until the respective chemical and physical<br>
equilibrium is established. For this reason, the conversion in the reaction<br>
column is higher than in a stirred tank. Reaction columns having from 5 to<br>
120 separation stages, in particular from 15 to 40 separation stages, have<br>
been found to be useful in the process of the invention.<br>
A critical factor in the choice of the reaction column which is suitable in a<br>
particular case is its load range. This term refers to the uniform<br>
hydrodynamic loading of the column cross section due to ascending<br>
gas/mass stream and the downflowing liquid/mass stream. Each reaction<br>
column has a particular load range which depends on the type of column<br>
internals and the properties of the feed mixture and within which uniform<br>
flow loading and thus heat and mass transport are ensured.<br>
The hydroformylation reaction is strongly exothermic. The heat evolved in<br>
the reaction can be used either internally in the reaction for preheating the<br>
reactants and for distillation of the reaction product and/or externally for<br>
generating steam. The thermal energy is advantageously removed via the<br>
reaction product and the circulated catalyst solution, although heat<br>
recovery is not restricted to these embodiments.<br>
The synthesis gas rising through the reaction column flows, as stated<br>
above, in countercurrent to the reaction product. The gaseous phase<br>
permeates the liquid stream and in the process extracts unreacted olefin<br>
dissolved in the reaction product and transports it into the reaction zone.<br>
The olefin conversion is significantly improved in this way, without a<br>
specific extraction unit having to be installed in the hydroformylation plant.<br>
As catalysts, use is made of water-soluble rhodium complexes containing<br>
water-soluble phosphorus(lll) compounds as ligands. Examples of water-<br>
soluble phosphorus(lll) compounds which form complexes with rhodium<br>
are triarylphosphines, trialkylphosphines and arylated or alkylated<br>
diphosphines whose organic radicals contain sulfonic acid groups or<br>
carboxyl groups. Their preparation and use is known, for example, from<br>
DE-B-26 27 354, EP 0 103 810 B1, EP 0 163 234 B1 and EP 0 571 819<br>
A1. Further groups of suitable compounds are sulfonated or carboxylated<br>
organic phosphites and heterocyclic compounds of trivalent phosphorus.<br>
The conditions under which the reaction occurs can be varied within wide<br>
limits and adapted to individual circumstances. They depend, inter alia, on<br>
the starting material, on the catalyst system chosen and on the desired<br>
degree of conversion. The hydroformylation of the starting materials is<br>
usually carried out at temperatures of from 50 to 180°C. Preference is<br>
given to temperatures of from 80 to 140°C, in particular from 100 to 130°C.<br>
The total pressure is in a range from 0.4 to 10 MPa, preferably from 1 to<br>
6 MPa and in particular from 1.5 to 5 MPa. The molar ratio of hydrogen to<br>
carbon monoxide is usually in the range from 1:10 to 10:1; mixtures<br>
comprising hydrogen and carbon monoxide in a molar ratio of from 3:1 to<br>
1:3, in particular 1:1, are preferred.<br>
The rhodium concentration is from 20 to 1000 ppm by weight, preferably<br>
from 50 to 500 ppm by weight and in particular from 100 to 300 ppm by<br>
weight, in each case based on the aqueous catalyst solution. Although it is<br>
possible to use the stochiometric rhodium-phosphorus complex as catalyst,<br>
the reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of excess phosphorus<br>
ligand, i.e. ligand which has not undergone complex formation with<br>
rhodium. Preference is given to using from 3 to 200 mol of phosphorus in<br>
the form of a water-soluble organic phosphorus compound per mol of<br>
rhodium. Molar ratios of rhodium to phosphorus in the range from 1:50 to<br>
1:100 have been found to be particularly useful. The rhodium-phosphorus<br>
complex used as catalyst does not have to have a uniform composition,<br>
but can be, for example, a mixture of rhodium complexes which differ in the<br>
type of phosphorus ligands present. Likewise, the phosphorus ligand<br>
present in the aqueous catalyst solution can be composed of a mixture of<br>
different water-soluble organic phosphorus compounds. The catalyst is<br>
usually formed from the components rhodium or rhodium compound,<br>
organic phosphorus compound and synthesis gas under the conditions of<br>
the hydroformylation reaction. However, it can also be introduced into the<br>
reaction stage as a preformed catalyst, i.e. a separately prepared catalyst.<br>
It has been found to be advantageous to circulate the catalyst and to make<br>
up for any catalyst losses which occur by introduction of fresh catalyst.<br>
To increase the conversion per unit time of olefinically unsaturated<br>
compounds which are only sparingly soluble in the aqueous catalyst<br>
solution, it may be advisable to add a phase transfer reagent (solubilizer) to<br>
this solution. This alters the physical properties of the interfaces between<br>
the two liquid phases and thus aids transition of the organic reactants into<br>
the aqueous catalyst phase. Solubilizing action is displayed by compounds<br>
whose hydrophilic groups are ionic (anionic or cationic) or nonionic.<br>
Examples of anionically active compounds are, inter alia, the sodium,<br>
potassium and ammonium salts of carboxylic acids, preferably those<br>
having from 8 to 20 carbon atoms. Cationic solubilizers include<br>
tetraalkylammonium and N-alkylpyrridinium salts. Nonionic phase transfer<br>
reagents are, for example, alkyl and alkylphenyl polyethylene glycols and<br>
trialkylamine oxides.<br>
The reactants olefin and synthesis gas can be preheated before<br>
introduction into the reactor. The liquid phase leaves the reaction column in<br>
the lower part, preferably at the bottom of the column, and goes via a heat<br>
exchanger into a phase separator. Here, it separates into the organic<br>
reaction product and the aqueous catalyst solution. The offgas taken from<br>
the reactor in the upper part, in particular at the top of the column, consists<br>
essentially of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. It may further comprise<br>
reaction product, saturated compounds formed by hydrogenation of the<br>
olefinic compounds and water. Olefinic starting material is present in the<br>
offgas particularly when, for example for reasons of process economics,<br>
the reaction has not been carried out to complete conversion of the<br>
unsaturated compound. The olefin can be recovered from the offgas by<br>
known methods, e.g. by condensation, or reacted in a second reaction<br>
stage to convert it into hydroformylation product. The reaction product<br>
present in the offgas is also separated off and returned to the reaction<br>
column or passed directly to the distillation stage.<br>
The process of the invention can be applied to olefinically unsaturated<br>
compounds of any structure. Accordingly, both olefins having an internal<br>
double bond and olefins having terminal double bonds and likewise<br>
straight-chain or branched olefins are suitable as starting material.<br>
Furthermore, the olefins can also be substituted by functional groups, in<br>
particular groups which are not changed during the course of the reaction.<br>
Multiply olefinically unsaturated compounds are also possible as starting<br>
materials. The process has been found to be particularly useful in the<br>
hydroformylation of olefinically unsaturated hydrocarbons having from 3 to<br>
12 carbon atoms in the molecule, preferably propylene and the isomeric<br>
butenes.<br>
Possible embodiments of the process of the invention are shown<br>
schematically by way of example in the accompanying drawings.<br>
In the process outlined in Figure 1, synthesis gas is fed into a reaction<br>
column 1 at the bottom of the column via a line 2 and olefin is fed in at feed<br>
points 4, 5 and 6 along the length of the reactor via a line 3. The catalyst<br>
solution is pumped via a line 7 into the top of the column and onto the<br>
uppermost separation stage of the column. Downward-flowing olefin reacts<br>
in the reactor with ascending synthesis gas in the presence of the catalyst<br>
to form aldehyde until equilibrium is established. Olefin dissolved in the<br>
product is stripped from the liquid phase by the upward-flowing synthesis<br>
gas stream and is likewise converted into aldehyde. The crude aldehyde<br>
which has been freed of olefin is taken off together with the catalyst<br>
solution in the lower part of the reaction column and is passed directly via a<br>
line 8 to a heat exchanger 9. The recovered heat can be used, for<br>
example, for the generation of stream and/or for the distillation of reaction<br>
product. The heat exchanger is followed by a separator 10 in which organic<br>
product and aqueous catalyst solution are separated. The catalyst phase is<br>
pumped via a heat exchanger 11, where the remaining heat in it is<br>
removed, to the top of the reaction column 1, if appropriate after addition of<br>
supplementary amounts of water or catalyst solution from containers 12<br>
and 13. Off gas is taken from the reaction system via line 14. It comprises<br>
predominantly carbon monoxide and hydrogen and small amounts of, inter<br>
alia, unreacted olefin and reaction product. Olefin and product are not<br>
discarded but instead can, like carbon monoxide and hydrogen, be utilized,<br>
for example in the process itself. It is also possible for the gas mixture to<br>
be reacted in an after-reactor with the olefin recovered from the offgas so<br>
as to convert both of them into further, desired product.<br>
The process variant shown in Figure 2 differs from the process of Figure 1<br>
in that the offgas leaving the reactor 1 via line 14 is cooled in a heat<br>
exchanger 15. A two-phase system consisting of gaseous and liquid phase<br>
is formed. Both phases are separated in a separator 16 and the gaseous<br>
phase is removed from the system while the liquid phase is returned to the<br>
reaction column 1 via line 17. The plant components denoted by the<br>
reference numerals 2 to 13 correspond, (as do the reaction column 1 and<br>
the offgas line 14) to those of Figure 1.<br>

the top of the column at one or more feed points along the reaction column.<br>
10. The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 9, wherein the reactants<br>
are preheated before being introduced into the reaction column.<br>
11. The process as claimed in claim 10, wherein preheating is carried out using<br>
heat evolved in the process.<br>
12. The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 11, wherein the heat<br>
reaction is removed by means of an auxiliary medium such as water or steam.<br>
13. The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 12, wherein the offgas is<br>
separated into a gaseous phase and a liquid phase and the liquid phase is<br>
returned to the reaction column.<br>
A process for the hydroformylation of olefinically unsaturated compounds having<br>
from 3 to 12 carbon atoms in a heterogeneous reaction system using a catalyst<br>
consisting of an aqueous solution comprising complexes of rhodium with water-<br>
soluble organic phosphorus (III) compounds selected from the group consisting of<br>
triarylphosphines, trialkylphosphines and arylated or alkylated diphosphates whose<br>
organic radicals contain sulfonic acid groups or carboxyl groups as ligands and, if<br>
desired, excess water-soluble organic phosphorus (III) compounds, at pressures of<br>
from 0.4 to 10 MPa and temperatures of from 50 to 180°C,wherein the reaction of<br>
the reactants is carried out in a reaction column having from 5 to 120 separation<br>
stages, and selected from the group consisting of a tray column, a column with<br>
ordered packing and a column with random packing elements.</td>
