				<td>This invention relates to a flowable refractory composition, particularly monolithic refractory compositions suitable for lining iron and steel making containers. An ideal refractory composition must resist high temperatures, changes of temperature, corrosion/erosion of molten metals and slags and hot gases carrying solid particles.<br>
Monolithic refractories are usually defined by their mode of application. For instance, a ramming refractory is installed by ramming either by mallets or by pneumatic rammers. Gunning refractories are installed by application through a gunning equipment and a castable refractory is installed by casting refractory compositions. During the past two decades, low cement castables have been developed which can be installed not only by casting but also under the force of vibration for moving the material. Water content in these compositions have been significantly reduced. These compositions behave in a pseudo-thixotropic fashion and the movement of the material takes place only under force of vibration. Preparation of refractory lining for metallurgical operations has always been time and labour intensive. Known refractory linings are cast against solid steel forms which can withstand vibration during casting steps. Transportation of these steel forms also poses problems.<br>
The main objective of this invention is in formulating a refractory composition which is flowable without the application of external force, requires shorter installation and drying time, leading to labour and cost savings. Refractory compositions of the present invention achieves these objectives by combining refractory aggregates with a colloidal solution of selected inorganic compounds in<br><br>
aqueous medium or an aqueous suspension of selected inorganic compounds of colloidal dimension. The particle size of the selected inorganic compounds in the aqueous medium is a vital factor that governs the flowability of the refractory composition. Another advantage is that the dry refractory aggregate may be prepared first and shipped to the installation site where required quantity of the inorganic sol is added for mixing prior to casting for lining operations. Since this composition need not be vibrated during casting operations, it is found possible to cast them on light removable form instead of heavy steel forms, thus reducing the cost considerably.<br>
According to this invention conventional refractory aggregates having 95 to 99% of refractory base material are mixed with an aqueous solution containing 8 to 24% submicron sized inorganic binder material selected from silica, alumina, zirconia and mullite. The composition may include 1 to 10% of microsilica, 0 to 40% of silicon carbide, 5 to 15% calcined alumina, 0 to 5% of metallic powders such as aluminum, and/or silicon, antigassing agent such as pyridine, and 0.5 to 3% by weight of a setting agent based on the aqueous binder content. Refractory base materials may be calcined clay, mullite, calcined bauxite, sillimanite, kyanite, andalucite, brown fused alumina, or tabular alumina, Setting agents such as calcium hydroxide, magnesium oxide or hydroxide, or calcium aluminate cement may also be added. Submicron size of the inorganic compounds selected from silica, alumina, zirconia or mullite which forms an aqueous colloidal binder may be of 5 microns or less than 5 microns.<br>
The flowable refractory composition according to this invention comprises of conventional refractory aggregates and setting agents bonded together by an aqueous colloidal suspension of an inorganic compound selected from silica, alumina, zirconia or mullite, the solid particles of the said inorganic compounds in the colloidal suspension having a particle size 5 microns.<br><br>
By using the refractory composition of this invention, refractory linings may be installed even in remote areas where placement by conventional methods such as ramming and vibra casting would have been difficult.<br>
The pump used for installation of this refractory can be a cement concrete pump with twin cylinders -one for drawing the material in and the other to push the material out into the pipe. The pump can be driven either by diesel or electric motors with suitable capacity. For transporting the high density large grain and abrasive particles used for the blast furnace trough refractory, the exit cylinder should preferably have a minimum of 75 mm diameter connected to 75 mm pipes for installation. Larger diameter cylinders can also be used such as 100 or 125mm but the exit pipes need to be reduced to 100 or 75 mm otherwise the movement of the pipes becomes difficult for handling due to increased weight. The use of a 75 mm diameter cylinder with 75 mm exit pipe diameter provides a smooth operation and puts minimum strain on the motor. Any reduction in the pipe line from the exit cylinder puts significant pressure on the pump.<br>
The special monolithic refractory can also be installed by transporting by a mobile conveyor system whereby the wet mix from the mixer can be dumped onto the conveyor belt that can be shortened or elongated as needed for the specific distance of installation. The delivery of the wet mix from the mixer can be controlled by the pneumatic door on the mixer so that the material can have a steady flow to be delivered at the point of installation. The conveyer should be provided with wheels and also adjustable lengths. The method of installation by the conveyer belt is simpler and needs significantly less investment for the equipment.<br><br>
EXAMPLE I<br>
A typical composition used for blast furnace cast house trough was prepared by mixing the following components in weight percentages as follows:<br>
Materials	Wt.(Kg)<br>
Tabular alumina, particle size 6 mm to 200 microns	80<br>
Reactive alumina, particle size 5 to 3 microns	10<br>
Silicon Carbide, particle size 200 to 50 microns	35<br>
Micro silica, particle size 0.5 to 0.1 microns	5<br>
Metallic powder, particle size 200 to 75 microns	5<br>
Graphite, particle size 200 to 100 microns	2.5<br>
Setting agent 100 microns	0.5<br>
Gas inhibitor	1.0<br>
Aqueous colloidal suspension of micro silica	15<br>
The above composition by mixing in place and installed by casting through a hopper without vibration, or by dumping into a pump and transporting into the site through steel and flexible pipes or by transporting the wet mix by dumping on to a flexible/movable conveyer belt as a trough lining in the blast furnace cast house. This composition will have excellent resistance to corrosion/erosion by the molten iron/slag and will provide good performance.<br>
The use of the unique suspended binder system has distinct advantage over other conventionally used binders such as clay, phosphates and calcium aluminate cement systems. Since there is no chemically bonded water in this binder system, it is much quicker for installation and also eliminates labour and avoids human error by<br><br>
avoiding the need of vibration. It is also easier to dry the installed lining since the moisture present is free and not chemically combined as in clay or calcium aluminate binder systems. The refractories with this binder system have better refractories, thermal stability and thermal shock resistance. All these things contribute to longer life because of its overall superior properties resulting in lower cost in time and labour.<br>
EXAMPLE II<br>
A typical composition for the iron runner in the blast furnace cast house will be as follows:<br>
Wt(Kg)<br>
Calcined bauxite, particle size 5 mm to 200 microns	80<br>
Calcined alumina, particle size 5 to 3 microns	5<br>
Silicon Carbide, particle size 200 to 50 microns	30<br>
Micro silica, particle size 0.5 to 0.1 microns	2.5<br>
Graphite, particle size 200 to 75 microns	2.5<br>
Setting agent 200 to 100 microns	0.5<br>
Gas inhibitor	1.0<br>
Aqueous colloidal suspension of sub micron silica	18<br>
The above composition by mixing in place and installed either by casting through a hopper or by transporting by pumping or by transferring the wet mix by a flexible and mobile conveyer belt as a lining for the iron runner will have rapid drying/heating characteristics, excellent resistance to erosion by molten iron and slag with good performance.<br><br>
EXAMPLE III<br>
A typical example for application in the steel ladle barrel or tundish back-up lining will be as follows:<br>
Wt(Kg)<br>
Calcined bauxite, avg. particle size 5 mm to 200 microns	85<br>
Tabular alumina, particle size 75 to 50 microns	10<br>
Silica fume, particle size 0.2 microns	5<br>
Setting agent 200 to 100 microns	0.5<br>
Aqueous colloidal suspension of micro silica	12<br>
The above composition by mixing in place and installed either by casting through a hopper or by transporting by pumping or by transferring the wet mix by a flexible and mobile conveyer belt as a lining for applications like reheat furnace hearth, tundish back-up lining, steel ladle barrel and waste incinerator linings, will have excellent resistance to erosion and thermal shock with good performance.<br>
