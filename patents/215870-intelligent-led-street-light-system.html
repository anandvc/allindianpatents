FIELD OF INVENTION :-<br>
The Invention describes Intelligent LED Street Light System. The system<br>
consists of a metal/engineering plastic housing with fixture, light emitting diodes, PCB, DC power supply (SMPS - Switch Mode Power Supply) etc. These lights are smaller in size, compact and light in weight and can be made into different shapes, sizes and configuration as per need.<br>
The system employs an intelligent electronic control system to ensure that the light always operates at its peak efficiency. The power supply to the system allows use of normally available AC voltages from 110V to 440V, 50 Hz or 60 Hz or any other power supply voltages as may be available from solar cell/ Battery/ Inverter.<br>
PRIOR ART:<br>
A High Pressure /Low Pressure /Metal halides Sodium vapour light is a gas discharge lamp which uses sodium /inert gas in an excited state to produce light. These lights are bigger in size, bulky, heavy and difficult to manage at height at which these are installed<br>
Exhibit    1    :    SODIUM    VAPOUR    STREET    LIGHT    FUNCTIONAL REPRESENTATION<br>
1.	AC Mains Supply Termination<br>
2.	Ballast<br>
3.	Electrode<br>
4.	Sodium Mercury Amalgam<br>
5.	Arc<br>
6.	Electrode<br>
7.	Alumina Arc Tube<br>
The luminaire is powered by AC Mains supply Termination (1) in series with an inductive Ballast (2) in order to supply a nearly constant current to electrodes (3) &amp; (6) of the luminaire, thus assuring stable operation. The inductive ballast (2) assists in continuing the stable operation without extinguishing the luminaire at each zero current point in the AC cycle.<br>
An amalgam of metallic sodium and mercury (4) lies at the coolest part of the luminaire and provides the sodium and mercury vapour in which the arc (5) is drawn. The temperature of the amalgam is determined to a great extent by luminaire power. The higher the luminaire power, the higher will be the amalgam temperature. The higher the temperature of the amalgam, the higher will be the mercury and sodium vapour pressures in the luminaire. An increase in these metal pressures will cause a decrease in the electrical resistance in the Alumina Arc Tube (7) of the luminaire.<br>
PROBLEM WITH PRIOR ART<br>
1.	Existing lights are bigger in size, bulky, heavy and difficult to manage at<br>
height at which these are installed.<br>
2.	Sodium and Mercury remain in solid state and need more current to melt<br>
and convert to vapours     and current passes through ions to produce<br>
light, hence requires more power.<br>
3.	Light scatters in 360Â° direction of the LPS /HPS light and reflectors are<br>
needed to reflect the light in a required direction. In achieving the<br>
reflection of light, 40% light energy is wasted and only 60% light energy<br>
is actually utilized.<br>
4.	Light intensity is very poor and does not give better visibility.<br>
5.	Low pressure sodium vapour (LPS) light has various wattages say 150<br>
watt is power consumption by the LPS light and 200 watts (approx.)<br>
inclusive of ballast.<br>
6.	High pressure sodium vapour (HPS) light has various wattages say 250<br>
watt is power consumption by the HPS light and 300 watts (approx.)<br>
inclusive of ballast.<br>
7.	Power factor for sodium vapour light is 0.5 -0.6 (Inductive).<br>
8.	End life duration for sodium vapour light is about 7000 hrs operations,<br>
provided Ballast life is in order. Invariably Ballast does not last that long<br>
and life gets reduced considerably.<br>
9.	Sodium vapour light cannot vary intensity or dimness of the light.<br><br>
10.	Sodium vapour light consists of an outer vacuum envelope of glass<br>
coated   with   an   infrared   reflecting  layer   of   indium  tin   oxide,   a<br>
semiconductor material that allows the visible light wavelengths out and<br>
keeps the infrared (heat) back. This heat is dissipated in the environment<br>
contributing to global warming.<br>
11.	Sodium and mercury are arsenic metals which are very hazardous for<br>
human beings. And once the life is over, the disposal of these metals<br>
becomes difficult.<br>
12.	For providing automatic switching on or off automatically, the light has<br>
to   be   provided  with   a  complete   additional   timer   and   switching<br>
device/controller additionally.<br>
13.	Colour of the light is not pleasing to eyes.<br>
14.	Sodium vapour light is harmful and not good for reading.<br>
HOW THIS INVENTION SEEKS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS :<br>
My invention relates to Intelligent LED Street Light which eliminates and removes above problems.<br>
Illustrations of Intelligent LED Street Light are as under : Exhibit 2: Intelligent LED Street Light Functional Representation<br>
1.	AC Main Supply Termination.<br>
2.	DC Power Supply (SMPS - Switch Mode Power Supply)<br>
3.	Solid State Control Electronics<br>
4.	LED Clusters<br>
5.	Solar /Battery Supply /Inverter (Optional)<br>
AC mains supply termination (1) is converted to required DC voltage in the DC power supply section (SMPS - Switch Mode Power Supply) (2).<br>
The DC power supply section (SMPS) (2) can also be powered from a Solar Cell /Battery Supply/Inverter (Optional) (5).<br>
DC power supply section (SMPS) (2) feeds power supply to Solid state control Electronics (3) and LED clusters (4).<br>
Light emitting diode (LED) emits incoherent narrow spectrum light when electrically biased in the forward direction of the p-n junction (p-positive and n-negative). This effect is a form of electroluminescence. An LED is a small extended source with extra optics added to its configuration that makes an LED to emit a more useful light emission pattern.<br>
Current flows easily from the p-side or anode to the n-side or cathode. Charge carriers electrons and holes flow into the junction from electrodes with different voltages. When an electron meets a hole, it falls into a lower energy level, and releases energy in the form of a photon.<br>
The light emitted from an LED is in unidirection and being almost a point source (in modular form of upto 5 watts or above), and it is possible to focus<br>
the individual light beams of each module on the specific spot on the ground where it is required. The LED luminaire efficiency is upto 95% as against a conventional sodium vapour light which has luminaire efficiency of 45-50% (further reduced by another 25% due to maintenance losses)<br>
45 - 60 watt LED luminaire can replace a 250 watt sodium vapour light mounted at a height of 35 feet to give a similar illumination level.<br>
LED luminaire can be dimmed automatically by a photocell switch or a certain number of LED modules in any light can be put off automatically after busy period by individual or a central timer. LED luminaire can be switched on or off automatically with the help of solid state control electronics (3).<br>
1 Lux of LED luminaire is equivalent to the visible effectiveness of more than 7 lux of sodium vapor light. Bluer light Emitting Diode luminaire requires less electric power to give the same visually effectiveness as from the sodium vapour light to convert the photopic lumens to mesopic lumens.<br>
Human eye has two regions, each of which respond to light differently - (a) Cones in the centre, which are active at daytime and can see colours (photopic vision), and (b) peripheral Rods, which are active at low light levels (scotopic vision). The visual activity at night-time falls in between, and is known as the mesopic region. The daytime vision (photopic) has maximum sensitivity at yellow-green wavelengths (555 nm), and tapers down on both sides of the visible spectrum; it is barely active in the blue region. On the other hand, at low light levels (scotopic) vision, Rods are active, which have much higher light sensitivity at blue-green (507nm). Furthermore, this sensitivity at nighttime is 3 times greater than at daytime, and is also active in the peripheral vision, i.e. with this vision the eye can see moving objects; but with no colour.<br>
And human eye focuses by varying the pupil size, which is activated by blue light sensitive rods. Sodium vapour light is deficient in blue light, the pupil opens fully and so the near objects become out of focus due to the reduced depth of field. Whereas LED luminaire has sufficient blue light that increases depth of field and near objects become in sight focus.<br>
The light from LED luminaire is pleasing to the eyes. It is having soothing effect. It is saving energy and money, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing glare to increase visibility, reducing light pollution and maintaining a safe level of lighting.<br>
The illustrations shown in Exhibits are only representative to show the invention. There could be numerous version of this invention in shape or size and configuration depending upon the specific use and the type of LED Street Light (Pole mounted/wall mounted /horizontal surf ace/vertical surface) to be used.<br>
Therefore, many apparently different embodiment of the present invention could be made without departing from scope and spirit thereof, it is indented that the description of the invention stated herein be interpreted as being illustrating only and not limiting in any manner whatsoever.<br>
