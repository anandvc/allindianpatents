GLAZING PROVIDED WITH A THIN-FILM MULTILAYER<br>
ACTING ON SOLAR RADIATION<br>
The invention relates to glazing provided with thin-film multilayers<br>
acting on solar radiation, especially glazing intended for thermal<br>
insulation and/or solar protection.<br>
This type of glazing is more particularly suitable for fitting into<br>
buildings: by virtue of the thin films, it makes it possible, by varying the<br>
amount of solar radiation energy, to prevent the interior of rooms being<br>
excessively heated in the summer and thus helps to limit the consumption<br>
of energy needed for air-conditioning them.<br>
The invention also relates to this type of glazing once it has been<br>
opacificd so as to form part of wall-cladding panels, which is called, more<br>
concisely, "curtain walling" and which, in combination with window<br>
glazing, makes it possible to provide buildings with exterior surfaces that<br>
arc entirely glazed.<br>
Such multilayer glazing (and curtain walling) is subjected to a<br>
number of constraints: with regard to window glazing, the films employed<br>
must filter out the solar radiation sufficiently. Furthermore, the thermal<br>
performance must preserve the optical and esthetic appearance of the<br>
glazing: it is desirable to be able to modulate the level of light transmission<br>
of the substrate and to retain an esthetically attractive color, most<br>
particularly in external reflection. This is also true of curtain walling with<br>
regard to the appearance in reflection. These films must also be<br>
sufficiently durable, this being the more so if, in the glazing once fitted,<br>
they are on one of the exterior faces of the glazing (as opposed to the<br>
"interior" faces turned toward the intermediate gas-filled cavity of a<br>
double-glazing unit, for example).<br>
Another constraint is imposed progressively: when the glazing<br>
consists at least partly of glass substrates, these may have to undergo one<br>
or more heat treatments, for example a bending operation if it is desired to<br>
shape them (shop window) or a toughening or annealing operation if it is<br><br>
2<br>
desired to make them stronger/less hazardous in the event of impacts.<br>
The fact that films are deposited on the glass before its heat treatment<br>
means that there is a risk of them being damaged and their properties,<br>
especially optical properties, being substantially modified (to deposit the<br>
films after the glass has been heat-treated is complicated and expensive).<br>
A first approach consists in modifying the optical appearance of the<br>
glass due to the films after the heat treatment and in configuring the films<br>
so that they have the desired properties, especially optical and thermal<br>
properties, only after this treatment. But in fact this means having to<br>
manufacture two types of multilayers in parallel, one for non-<br>
toughened/non-curved glazing and the other for glazing which will be<br>
toughened/curved. It is endeavored henceforth to avoid this by devising<br>
multilayers of thin (intcrferential) films which are able to withstand heat<br>
treatments without the optical properties of the glass being modified too<br>
significantly and without its appearance being degraded (optical defects).<br>
The films may then be referred to as "bendable" or "toughcnable" films.<br>
An example of solar-protection glazing for buildings is given in<br>
patents EP-0 511 901 and EP-0 678 483: these refer to functional films for<br>
filtering out solar radiation that are made of a nickel-chromium alloy,<br>
optionally nitrided, made of stainless steel or of tantalum and are placed<br>
between two dielectric films of metal oxides such as SnO2, TiO2 or Ta2O;,.<br>
Such glazing makes for good solar-protection glazing with satisfactory<br>
mechanical and chemical durability, but is not truly "bendable" or<br>
"toughenable" since the oxide films surrounding the functional film do not<br>
prevent it from being oxidized during the bending or toughening operation,<br>
the oxidation being accompanied by a modification in the light<br>
transmission and in the general appearance of the glazing in its entirety.<br>
Many studies have been carried out recently to make the films<br>
bcndable/toughenable in the context of low-cmissivity glazing, in which<br>
the aim is rather to achieve high light transmission as opposed to solar<br>
protection. It has already been proposed to use, above the silver functional<br>
films, dielectric films based on silicon nitride, this material being relatively<br><br>
3<br>
inert with respect to high-temperature oxidation and proving suitable for<br>
preserving the subjacent silver film, as described in patent EP-0 718 250.<br>
Other multilayers acting on solar radiation and assumed to be<br>
bcndable/toughenable have been described, these employing functional<br>
films other than silver: patent EP-0 536 607 uses functional films made of<br>
a metal nitride, of the TiN or CrN type, with protective films made of metal<br>
or of silicon derivatives; patent EP-0 747 329 describes functional films<br>
made of a nickel alloy of the NiCr type that are combined with silicon<br>
nitride films.<br>
Multilayer structures are also known that use, as film acting on<br>
solar radiation, titanium dioxide (TiO2), this film being pyrolytically<br>
deposited in the float chamber, namely by thermally decomposing a liquid<br>
or solid precursor of titanium-based precursors.<br>
Although the product is satisfactory from the standpoint of<br>
reflection properties with regard to solar radiation, its method of<br>
manufacture no longer meets environmental regulations. This is because<br>
the pyrolytic deposition technique requires the use of organomctallic<br>
precursors in hydrocarbon-type solvents, which mean that the waste and<br>
gaseous discharges have to undergo further treatment.<br>
Furthermore, the pyrolytic deposition technique requires the use of<br>
nozzles placed in the treatment chamber, facing the moving glass ribbon,<br>
so as to be able to disperse the organometallic precursors as uniformly as<br>
possible for the purpose of obtaining a film with optimum optical<br>
properties.<br>
However, these multilayers providing a solar-protection function<br>
that arc deposited pyrolytically have reached performance levels that arc<br>
not easily capable of being improved, considering the deposition technique<br>
and the regulatory requirements.<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to develop a novel type of<br>
thin film multilayers acting on solar radiation, for the purpose of<br>
manufacturing improved solar-protection glazing by a<br>
magnetron-sputtering technique. The intended improvement is especially<br>
to  obtain  a better compromise  between  durability,  thermal  properties,<br><br>
4<br>
optical properties and ability to withstand heat treatments without any<br>
damage when the substrate carrying the multilayer is of the glass type.<br>
The other object of the invention is to make this multilayer<br>
compatible with the use of the glazing, once it has been opacificd, as<br>
curtain walling.<br>
The subject of the invention is firstly a transparent substrate,<br>
especially a glass substrate, provided with a thin-film multilayer acting on<br>
solar radiation, the multilayer being deposited by magnetron sputtering,<br>
which is characterized in that it includes at least a lubricating film of high<br>
optical index n, this lubricating film being associated with at least one<br>
sublayer, which is based on silicon nitride or oxynitride or carbonitride, or<br>
based on aluminum and/or zirconium nitride or oxynitride or<br>
carbonitride, or a mixture of at least two of these compounds (mixed Si-Al<br>
or Si Zr nitrides or oxynitrides or carbonitrides).<br>
The lubricating films of the invention allow the light transmission<br>
value of the substrate to be varied within the desired ranges, as explained<br>
in detail below, by adjusting their thicknesses, while still maintaining a<br>
solar protection effect.<br>
The presence of the sublayer makes it possible to vary, more flexibly,<br>
the optical appearance conferred by the multilayer on its carrier substrate.<br>
Furthermore, in the case of heat treatment, it constitutes an additional<br>
barrier, especially with respect to oxygen and alkaline metals from the<br>
glass substrate, which species arc liable to migrate toward the heat and to<br>
degrade the multilayer.<br>
Furthermore, the choice of an overlayer based on silicon nitride or<br>
silicon oxide (abbreviated to Si3N4 and SiO2) or on silicon oxynitride<br>
(abbreviated to SiON, without prejudicing the respective amounts of Si, O<br>
and N) has also proved to be highly advantageous on several counts: this<br>
type of material proves to be capable of protecting the films of the<br>
multilayer (the lubricating layer and the sublayer) of the invention at high<br>
temperature, especially from oxidation, while maintaining their integrity,<br>
thereby making the multilayer according to the invention<br>
bendable/toughcnablc when the substrate carrying the multilayer is made<br><br>
5<br>
of glass  and when it is desired for said multilayer to undergo a heat<br>
treatment of this type after deposition of the films: the change in optical<br>
properties caused by a heat treatment of the toughening type is slight,<br>
with the light transmission and external appearance in reflection both<br>
being modified sufficiently slightly not to be significantly perceptible to the<br>
human eye.<br>
Finally, it has been discovered that it is also compatible with a<br>
subsequent enameling treatment, this being most particularly<br>
advantageous in the case of curtain walling, since in general there are two<br>
possible ways of opacifying the glazing for curtain walling: either a lacquer<br>
is deposited on the glass, which is dried and cured with a moderate heat<br>
treatment, or an enamel is deposited.<br>
The enamel, like that usually deposited, is composed of a powder<br>
containing a glass frit (the glassy matrix) and pigments used as colorants<br>
(the frit and the pigments being based on metal oxides), and a medium<br>
also called a vehicle, allowing the powder to be applied to the glass and to<br>
adhere to it at the time of deposition. To obtain the final enameled coating,<br>
it must then be fired, and this firing operation is frequently carried out<br>
concomitantly with the operation of toughening/bending the glass.<br>
Reference may be made for further details about the enamel compositions<br>
to patents FR-2 736 348, WO 96/41773, EP-718 248, EP-712 813 and<br>
ICP-636 588. The enamel, a mineral coating, is durable, adherent to the<br>
glass and therefore a useful opacifying coating. However, when the glazing<br>
is provided beforehand with thin films, it is tricky to use it for two reasons:<br>
-	on the one hand, firing the enamel necessarily means subjecting<br>
the multilayer to a high-temperature heat treatment, which is possible<br>
only if the multilayer is capable of not being optically degraded during this<br>
treatment; and<br>
-	on the other hand, over time the enamel tends to release chemical<br>
substances which diffuse into the subjacent films and chemically modify<br>
them.<br>
However, using a silicon nitride or oxynitride or silicon oxide film to<br>
complete the thin-film multilayers has been very effective both for making<br><br>
6<br>
the overall multilayer capable of withstanding the heat treatments and for<br>
acting as a barrier to these chemical compounds liable to diffuse out of the<br>
enamel layer.<br>
Consequently, the multilayer according to the invention is<br>
enamelablc in the sense that an enamel can be deposited on the face of<br>
the substrate that is not coated with the multilayer and fired without<br>
appreciably changing the optical appearance, with respect to window<br>
glazing provided with the same films, in external reflection. This is<br>
precisely the challenge for curtain walling, namely to provide harmony of<br>
color and as far as possible similarity of external appearance with the<br>
window glazing so as to be able to form entirely glazed walls which are<br>
esthetically attractive.<br>
According to another embodiment, not exclusive of the previous one,<br>
provision may be made to use multiple sublayers, especially having an<br>
alternation of high refractive index (for example between 1.8 and 2.2) and<br>
low refractive index (for example between 1.4 and 1.6). These are<br>
preferably sequences of the SiaN4 (index ~ 2)/SiO2 (index ~ 1.45) or<br>
Si3N4/SiO2/Si3N4 type. These sequences allow the external appearance of<br>
the substrate in reflection to be adjusted, especially for the purpose of<br>
reducing the value of R1 and/or its color.<br>
Moreover, the film or films of the multilayer which are based on<br>
silicon nitride or oxynitride also contain a metal in a minor amount with<br>
respect to silicon, for example aluminum, especially up to 10% by weight<br>
of the compound constituting the film in question. This is useful for<br>
increasing the rate of deposition of the film by magnetically enhanced<br>
reactive sputtering, in which the silicon target without any "doping" with a<br>
metal is not conducting enough. The metal may furthermore confer better<br>
durability on the nitride or oxynitride.<br>
With regard to the thicknesses of the films described above, it is<br>
usual to choose a thickness range from 5 to 50 nm for the lubricating film,<br>
especially between 5 and 30 nm. The choice of its thickness allows the<br>
light transmission of the substrate to be varied within ranges used for<br>
glazing providing buildings with solar protection, i.e. especially 50 to 80%<br><br>
7<br>
or 60 to 70%. Of course, the light transmission level may also be modified<br>
using other parameters, especially the thickness and the composition of<br>
the substrate, most particularly when it is made of clear or colored glass.<br>
The thickness of the sublayer is preferably between 5 and 70 nm,<br>
especially between 10 and 35 nm. For example, it is 15, 20 or 25 nm.<br>
The thickness of the optional ovcrlayer is preferably between 1 and<br>
10 nm, especially between 2 and 7 nm.<br>
When there is a single sublayer, of the Si3N4 type, its thickness, is,<br>
for example, 5 to 50 nm, especially about 10 to 30 or 25 nm. When it is a<br>
sequence of several films, each of the films may have a thickness of, for<br>
example, 5 to 50 nm, especially 1 5 to 45 nm.<br>
The sublayer and/or the overlayer may in fact form part of a<br>
superposition of dielectric films. One or other may thus be combined with<br>
other films of different refractive indices. Thus, the multilayer may<br>
include, between the substrate and the functional film (or above the<br>
functional film) an alternation of three, high index/low index/high index,<br>
films, the "high index" (at least 1.8 to 2) film or one of them possibly being<br>
the sublayer of the invention of the Si3N4 or A1N type and the "low index"<br>
(for example less than 1.7) film possibly being made of silicon oxide SiO2.<br>
The thickness of the additional metal nitride film is preferably<br>
between 2 and 20 nm, especially between 5 and 10 nm. It: is therefore<br>
preferably thin and therefore possibly contributes only very slightly to the<br>
solar protection effect imparted by the metal film.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention is a multilayer that<br>
includes a lubricating film based on titanium dioxide (TiO2) or zirconium<br>
dioxide (ZrO2) or a mixture of titanium oxide and zinc oxide (OTiZn) or a<br>
mixed silicon zirconium nitride (SiZrN), a sublayer based on silicon nitride<br>
and an optional overlayer, also based on silicon nitride (Si4N4) or silicon<br>
oxide (SiO).<br>
The subject of the invention is also a substrate provided with the<br>
multilayer which is described above, in general, and is bendable and/or<br>
toughenable and/or enamelable. A multilayer which is "bendable and/or<br>
toughenable" is understood within the meaning of the invention to be a<br><br>
8<br>
multilayer which, deposited on the substrate, undergoes a limited optical<br>
change and may especially be quantified within the (L*,a*,b*) colorimetry<br>
system by a AE* value of less than 3, especially less than 2.<br>
AE* is defined as follows: AE* = (AL*2 + Aa*2 + Ab*2)1^, where AL*, Aa*<br>
and Ab* are the differences in the L*, a* and b* measurements before and<br>
after heat treatment.<br>
That face of the substrate not provided with a multilayer is<br>
considered as "enamelable" when it is possible to deposit on it, in a known<br>
manner, an enamel composition without the appearance of optical defects<br>
in the multilayer (which is on the other face of the substrate) and with a<br>
limited optical change, which may be quantified as above. This also means<br>
that it has a satisfactory durability, without any undesirable deterioration<br>
of the films of the multilayer in contact with the enamel, either while it is<br>
being fired or over time once the glazing has been fitted.<br>
Of course, a multilayer of this type is advantageous when substrates<br>
made of clear or bulk-tinted glass are used. However, it is possible just as<br>
well not to seek to exploit its bendable/toughcnable nature but simply its<br>
satisfactory durability, by using glass substrates but also substrates not<br>
made of glass, especially made of a rigid and transparent polymer material<br>
such as polycarbonate or polymethyl methacrylatc (PMMA) substituting<br>
for the glass, or else a flexible polymer material, like certain polyurethanes<br>
or like polyethylene tcrephthalate (PET), which flexible material can then<br>
be fastened to a rigid substrate in order to functionalizc it, by making<br>
them adhere by various means, or by a lamination operation.<br>
The subject of the invention is also "monolithic" glazing (i.e. glazing<br>
comprising a single substrate) or insulating multiple glazing of the double<br>
glazing type. Preferably, whether monolithic glazing or double glazing, the<br>
multilayers are placed on the 2 face (conventionally, the glass/substrate<br>
faces of a glazing assembly are numbered from the outside toward the<br>
inside of the compartment/room which is fitted therewith) and provide a<br>
solar-radiation protection effect.<br>
More particularly, advantageous glazing according to the invention<br>
has a TL of about 50 to 80%, especially 60 to 70%, and a solar factor SF<br><br>
9<br>
close to the TL value. It also has preferably a blue or green color in external<br>
reflection (on that side of the substrate which is not provided with films)<br>
especially with, in the (L*,a*,b*) colorimetry system, negative a* and b*<br>
values (before and after any possible heat treatment). Thus, an attractive<br>
and not very strong color in reflection, desirable in buildings, is obtained.<br>
The subject of the invention is also a substrate with a multilayer<br>
and partially opacificd by a coating of the lacquer or enamel type, for the<br>
purpose of making curtain walling, in which the opacifying coating is in<br>
direct contact with the face of the substrate that is not coated with the<br>
multilayer. The multilayer can therefore be absolutely identical both for<br>
window glazing and for curtain walling.<br>
Although the application more particularly intended by the<br>
invention is glazing for buildings, it is clear that other applications can be<br>
envisaged, especially for vehicle windows (apart from windshields, in<br>
which a very high light transmission is required), such as the side<br>
windows, sunroof and rear window.<br>
The invention will be described below in greater detail with the aid of<br>
nonlimiting examples.<br>
All the substrates are made of 6 mm-thick clear glass of the<br>
PLANILUX type sold by Saint-Gobain Glass France.<br>
All the films arc deposited in a known manner by magnetically<br>
enhanced sputtering, the metal films using a metal target in an oxidizing<br>
atmosphere in the case of TiOa, the metal nitride or silicon nitride films<br>
using a suitable metal or silicon (bulk-doped with 8% aluminum) target in<br>
a reactive atmosphere containing nitrogen (100% N2 for TiN and 40%<br>
Ar/60% N2 for Si3N4). The Si3N4 films therefore contain a little aluminum.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
This example uses a TiO2 lubricating film and an Si3N4 sublayer<br>
according to the following sequence:<br>
glass / Si3N4 (25 nm)/TiO2 (20 nm).<br>
After depositing the films,  the substrate  underwent the  following<br>
heat treatment: 620°C heating for 10 minutes.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br><br>
10<br><br>
This example uses the same lubricating film and the same sublayer<br>
as  in   Example   1,  with  an  additional  SiO2  ovcrlaycr  according  to  the<br>
following sequence:<br>
glass / Si3N4 (20 nm) / TiO2 (20 nm) / SiO2 (5 nm).<br>
The coated substrate then underwent the same heat treatment as in<br>
Example 1.<br>
Table 1. below combines, for Examples 1, 2, the following properties:<br>
-	optical transmission    TL: light transmission in % under illuminant<br>
external reflection (i.e. that measured on the external side when<br>
the coated glass is fitted as monolithic glazing in a room with the<br>
multilayer on face 2: external reflection (RLEXT) in %; a* (REXT), b*(REXT), the<br>
colorimctric coordinates in external reflection according to the (L*,a*,b*)<br>
colorimetry system;<br>
internal reflection: the value of RLINT in % and the colorimctric data<br>
a*(RINT), b*(RINT); and<br>
-	energy transmission: TE in %.<br>
All these properties are given twice: once before heat treatment and<br>
once after heat treatment. Also measured arc E*(T) in transmission,<br>
E*(REXT) in external reflection and E*(RINT) in internal reflection, where<br>
E*     (L*2 + a*2 + b*2)1/2 for transmission, with:<br>
a* = a* (after treatment) - a* (before treatment);<br>
b* = b* (after treatment) - b* (before treatment);<br>
L* = L* (after treatment) - L* (before treatment).<br><br><br><br>
12<br>
This table shows that Examples 1 and 2 according to the invention<br>
provide a good E* before heat treatment/E* after heat treatment<br>
compromise (little variation) and they provide good solar protection. They<br>
are also good from the point of view of esthetic appearance, most<br>
particularly in external reflection where the a* and b* values are negative<br>
giving a color in the blue-green that is not very strong, regarded as<br>
attractive for glazing with strong external reflection.<br>
What is notable is that all these advantages are retained after heat<br>
treatment: the TL and TE values are retained to within 1%, the colorimetric<br>
data change very little and there is no switch from one color to another in<br>
external reflection. There are no optical defects. The AE* value, quantifying<br>
a possible colorimetric change, remains at most 1.2 in transmission, in<br>
internal reflection and in external reflection: this is indeed a multilayer<br>
capable of undergoing a treatment of the bending or toughening type<br>
without significant degradation. Whether it is desired to have a glass<br>
which may or may not be toughened, annealed or curved, the invention<br>
provides a solar-protection multilayer with identical, retained, properties.<br>
The comments made with regard to Example 1 also apply to Example 2,<br>
except as regards the value of AE* in transmission, which is substantially<br>
less than the corresponding value in both internal and external reflection.<br>
In conclusion, the solar-protection glazing according to the invention<br>
is highly advantageous for fitting into buildings, but not to the exclusion<br>
of applications in automobiles and any other vehicle: side windows, rear<br>
window and sunroof, which may also have enameled coatings. With a fixed<br>
multilayer, especially with the desired T1, and TE values, it is thus possible,<br>
without having to modify the multilayer, to manufacture window glazing<br>
which is not intended to undergo heat treatments or which must be<br>
bent/toughcncd/anncaled and to manufacture curtain walling in<br>
complete colorimetric harmony with the window glazing, which may be<br>
lacquered or enameled: it is thus possible to standardize the manufacture<br>
of interfcrential films on large-sized substrates, this being a great<br>
advantage from the industrial standpoint.<br>
The   invention   has   resulted   in   the   development   of  toughenable<br><br>
13<br>
solar control glazing with E* values in external reflection of 1.2 or less.<br>
It is also possible to make enameled, rather than lacquered,<br>
multilayer-coated curtain walling, this also being highly advantageous<br>
from an industrial standpoint (the enameling taking place during the<br>
toughening process, whereas lacquering requires an additional<br>
manufacturing step).<br><br>
