				<td>LAUNDRY DETERGENT BARS WITH IMPROVED PHYSICAL PROPERTIES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method of making a laundry detergent bar composition comprising synthetic anionic detergent surfactant having improved physical properties.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In societies where mechanical washing machines are hot common, laundry detergent bars comprising synthetic organic surfactants and detergency builders are used in the laundering of clothes. Technical developments in the field of laundry detergent bars have concerned formulating bars which are effective in cleaning clothes; which have acceptable sudsing characteristics in warm and cool water and in hard and soft water; which have acceptable in-use wear rates, hardness, durability, and feel; which have low smear, and-which have a pleasing odor and appearance. Methods for making laundry detergent bars are also well known in the art. Prior art disclosing laundry bars and methods for making laundry bars include: U.S. Pat. 3,178,370, Okenfuss, issued April 13, 1965; and Philippine Pat. 13,778, Anderson, issued September 23, 1980.<br>
Laundry bar compositions are commonly used in countries having high humidity, such as in the Philippines, India, and Latin America. Consumers often launder clothes outside and therefore often store the laundry bars outside. Such bars which are stored at high humidity conditions tend to become soft and mushy when exposed from the wrapper. Although not intended to be limited by theory,<br>
thÂ© bars tend to absorb moisture in such high humidity conditions. It is undesirable for consumers to handle such mushy bars. Furthermore, consumers find it difficult to wash clothes properly using soft bars since the bar must be sufficiently hard to rub directly against the clothes.<br>
In addition, since bars are used for more than one wash load, after one use, the bar is stored (usually outside) and reused. The used bars which became wet during the wash do not dry adequately after use, especially In high humidity conditions. Not only does it stay wet and mushy after use, but the bars may continue to absorb additional moisture from the high humidity conditions of storage after use.<br>
It has now been found that the in-situ formation of a complex between calcium salt and siliceous material during bar processing improves the physical properties of synthetic laundry bar compositions. One benefit is that the bars have significantly less moisture absorption, especially at high humidity conditions, which leads to a good rate of drying of the surface of the bar. In addition, such bar compositions of the present invention have improved hardness of the bar, thereby retaining the structural integrity during use and transportation. Furthermore, such compositions have reduced bar solubility, wherein it is harder for the bar to dissolve after becoming wet during the washing process.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

Moisture<br>
The final bar composition should have no more than about 15% moisture. The moisture level of the total bar composition can be determined by any methods known in the art by one skilled in the area of laundry bar compositions. One common method is the Bidwell Sterling Distillation method. Another known method is the Karl Fischer Moisture Titration Method. See AOCS official method Dd2a-59 issue 93 and AOCS official method Dd2b-59 issue 89. Bar Physical Properties<br>
The bars of the present invention are sufficiently hard. A preferred method to measure bar hardness is to measure the penetration of a needle through the bar surface under a standard weight for 5 seconds using a cone penetrometer. One such penetrometer is made by Associated Instrument Manufacturers India Pvt. Ltd. (Model number AIM 512). The weight of the rod and the cone is 149 grams and an additional 50 gram weight is placed on the cone. The penetration reading of a fresh bar made as per the present invention will typically be about 20-30 (1/10 mm) and after 40 minutes it would be around 15-20 (1/10 mm) . Bars aged about 3 days at ambient conditions will typically have a bar penetration reading of about 5-12 (1/10 mm).<br>
Another physical property of interest is the bar solubility in water. One method of determining the bar solubility is to submerge a bar having the following dimensions: 75mm x 55mm, in 250 ml of water In a beaker for 2 hours, drying the bar at 60 degrees C for 2 hours and then weighing the bar. To have acceptable bar solubility, the difference in weight should be about 15-20 grams for a 125 gram bar (12-16% of the original weight of the bar), more preferably 5-15 grams (4-12% of the original weight of the bar).<br>
Yet another physical property of consumer relevance is the rate of drying of the bar after usage and storage under high humidity conditions.-A preferred method to measure this property Is to place a bar with dimens1ons of 75mm x 55mm with one of its large flat surface in contact with about 20 ml of water in a petri dish for 2 hours and then scraping the gel formed. This procedure is repeated for a second cycle except that the gel is not scraped off from the bar surface after the second contact with water. The bar is then stored under 30 degrees C and 88% Relative Humidity for 24 hours and then the bar surface which was exposed to the water is graded for dryness on a 1-5 grading scale by experienced operators as illustrated below:<br>
Drvness Grade	Physical state of the bar surface<br>
1	very wet, very soft, melting, soft core<br>
2	wet, soft gel, hard core<br>
3	somewhat dry (moist), feels soft<br>
4	somewhat dry ( moist), feels hard<br>
5	completely dry, hard<br>
For good consumer acceptance, the dryness grade is typically between .3.5-5.0. Preferred bars of the present invention have a dryness grade within this range. Processing<br>
The detergent laundry bars of the present invention can be processed in conventional soap or detergent bar making equipment with some or all of the following key equipment: blender/mixer, mill or refining plodder, two-stage vacuum plodder, logo printer/cutter, cooling tunnel and wrapper.<br>
In a typical process the raw materials are mixed in the blender. Alkyl benzene sulfonic acid Is reacted with alkaline inorganic salts to complete neutralization, the amount of alkaline inorganic salt being at least sufficient to completely neutralize the acid. Once the neutralization reaction is completed, the calcium salt and siliceous material are added to form a complex in-situ. To control the grit formation during this reaction, it is preferable to add some inert powdered materials like talc and/or zeolite after the addition of silicate, but before the addition of the calcium salt. Preferably the level of these inert materials should be from about 1% to about 20%, by weight of the composition. The calcium salt and siliceous material must be added to a completely neutralized anionic active. Therefore, they should only be added after the neutralization of the acid form of anionic synthetic detergent surfactant. Where pre-neutralized anionic surfactant is used exclusively, the calcium salt and siliceous material can be added either before or after the surfactant is added to the mixer. .Phosphate detergency builder is added after the addition of calcium salt and siliceous material. Then other optional, surfactants followed by any additional optional components such as chelants are added. The mixing can take from one minute to one hour, with the usual mixing time being from about two to twenty minutes. The blender mix is charged to a surge tank. The product is conveyed from the surge tank to the mill or refining plodder via a multi-worm conveyor.<br>
After milling or preliminary plodding, the product is then conveyed to a two-stage vacuum plodder, operating at high vacuum, e.g. 600 to 740 mm of mercury vacuum, so that entrapped air/gas is removed. The product is extruded<br>
and cut to the desired bar length, and printed with the product brand name. The printed bar can be cooled, for example in a cooling tunnel, before it is wrapped; cased, and sent to storage.<br>
A preferred laundry bar composition is made by the following method: The raw materials are first mixed in a blender. Sodium carbonate and pre-neutralized coco fatty alkyl sulfate (CFAS) (if a mixture of CFAS/LAS is used as a surfactant system) are mixed for about 1-2 minutes. This is followed by the addition of linear alkyl benzene sulfonic acid and sulfuric acid (if present in the formulation). The acids are then completely neutralized by the sodium carbonate in the seat of the blender. (The amount of sodium carbonate should be at least an amount sufficient to neutralize the acids.) Once the neutralization reaction is completed, sodium silicate is added, followed by the addition of talc and zeolite, and the mixture is mixed for about 2 minutes. Ca(OH)2 is then added and mixed for an additional 2 minutes. Then, a chelant, if present is added, followed by other optional surfactants, STPP, magnesium sulfate, and any other additional optional components. The STPP and magnesium sulfate (when used) must be added after the addition of Ca(OH)2 and siliceous material is mixed to form a complex in situ. Magnesium sulfate, when used is also added after the STPP. The total mixing time can take up to about one hour, with the usual mixing time being from about five to twenty minutes. As one of the last optional ingredients, bleach and enzymes can be added to the mixture and then mixed for an additional one to five minutes. The blender mix is charged to a surge tank. The product is conveyed from the surge tank to the mill or refining plodder via a multi-worm conveyor.<br>
After milling or preliminary plodding, the product is then conveyed to a two-stage vacuum plodder, operating at high vacuum, e.g. 600 to 740 mm of mercury vacuum, so that entrapped air is removed. The product is extruded and cut to the desired bar length, and printed with the product brand name. The printed bar can be cooled, for example in a cooling tunnel, before it is wrapped, cased, and sent to storage.<br>
