NOVEL TELLURIUM COMPOUNDS AND USES THEREOF<br>
FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel tellurium-containing compounds, compositions comprising such compounds, and their use as immunomodulators.<br>
Cytokines play an important role in a regulation of the immune system. Several studies indicate that variations in cytokine expression are associated with disease activity in immune mediated or inflammatory disorders, including autoimmune disorders (Acta Univ. Palacki. Olomuc, Fac. Med 143: 19-29, 2000; Rheumatol 39: 1078, 2000; J. Immunol 167: 5338, 2001), trauma (surgery) (Blood 87: 2095-2147, 1996), ischemic diseases (myocardial infarction) (Acta Univ. Palacki. Olomuc, Fac. Med. 143: 19-29, 2000; Cell Immunol. 184: 12, 1998), Alzheimer's disease (Blood 87: 2095-2147, 1996), liver diseases (Immunol Rev. 174:192-209, 2000), rheumatoid arthritis (Arthritis Rheum. 44: 275, 2001; J. Rheumatol. 28: 1779, 2001), obesity (Shock 14: 2533 2000), psoriasis (Arch. Dermatol Res, 293: 334, 2001), and sepsis (Acta. Univ. Palacki. Olomuc, Fac. Med 143: 19-29, 2000; Blood 87: 2095-2147, 1996; Shock 16: 441, 2000; J. Med. 31:15, 2000).<br>
IL-lp is crucial for the induction of fever and acute-phase response during local tissue damage; in systemic inflammation it contributes to inflammatory reaction (Acta. Univ. Palacki. Olomuc, Fac. Med. 143: 19-29, 2000). This cytokine is important in response to tissue damage and infection, but is not required for normal development and homeostasis. Serum levels of IL-lp and IL-IRa are significantly elevated in severe sepsis (Acta Univ. Palacki. Olomuc, Fac. Med 143:19-29, 2000).<br>
The IL-1 family of cytokines, which include IL-18 and IL-lp.are key hormones of the immune system. Both IL-18 and IL-lp are expressed and produced by various types of cells from hematopoetic and nonhematopoetic lineages, such as dendritic cells, monocytes/macrophages, microglia cells, keratinocytes, intestinal epithelial cells, etc. Recent studies emphasize the pathophysiological role of IL-18 and IL-ip in a variety of neurodegenerative, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as inflammation, hemaopoiesis and wound healing (Immunol Today 7: 45-56,1986).<br>
Interleukin-18 is an early signal in the development of T-lyinphocyte helper type 1 (Thl) responses.   It acts together with IL-12 to induce various cytokines, including<br><br>
IFN-y, to activate Thl cells. IFN-y is in turn responsible for inducing production of the soluble receptor protein, IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP), a native down-regulator of IL-18 activity, which specifically binds IL-18 and neutralizes its biological activity in vitro and in vivo (Immunity 10:127, 1999).<br>
IL-18 and IL-lp.are expressed and produced in an inactive form, which requires activation by protease enzymes. The protease enzymes are divided into four families, (serine-, metallo-, aspartic- and cysteine-proteases) based on their catalytic residues and mechanism of action. Whereas serine proteases utilize a nucleophilic hydroxyl of the serine residue and aspartic and metalloproteases posses carboxylates as active functionalities, the cysteine proteases have an active-site thiol-nucleophile.<br>
The caspase enzymes (Cysteine Aspartic-Specific Proteases) are a family of intracellular cysteine endopepetidases, which cleave their substrates after aspartate residues (Ann. Rev. Immunol. 17: 781-828, 1999). The caspases are divided into two classes, based on the lengths of their N-terminal prodomains. Caspases-1,-2,-4,-5,-8, and -10 have long prodomains; and caspases-3,-6,-7, and -9 have short prodomains.<br>
Caspase 1, which is also known and referred to herein, interchangeably, as interleukin-p-converting enzyme (ICE), is expressed as a proenzyme of 45 kD in many tissues (J. Clin. Immunol 19:1, 1999). Upon stimulation, it undergoes activation by proteolytic cleavage. Active ICE is a tetramer of two non-identical subunits plO and p20 in 2:2 proportion, which is uniquely responsible for cleaving pro-interleukin-1 p (31 or 33 kD), into mature interleukin-lp (IL-lp)(17.5 kD), which consists of the C-terminal 153 residues of the inactive form; and pro-IL-18 (24 kD), which is cleaved at Asp35, into the biologically active 18 kD form (J. Immunother. 25: S4-S11, 2002; Nature 386: 619, 1997; Science 275: 206, 1997). The active cytokine is then released by a non-standard mechanism, since unlike the case with most secretory proteins, the precursor lacks a signal sequence and is not associated with membrane-bound compartments (J. Exp. Med 167:389-407, 1988).<br>
ICE therefore plays an important role in physiological processes mediated by IL-lp and IL-18.<br>
Various tellurium compounds, having immunomodulating properties, have been shown to have beneficial effects in diverse preclinical and clinical studies. A particularly  effective  family  of tellurium-containing  compounds  is  taught,   for<br><br>
example, in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,752,614; 4,761,490; 4,764,461 and 4,929,739. The immunomodulating properties of this family of tellurium-containing compounds is described, for example, in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,962,207, 5,0933135, 5,102,908 and 5,213,899, which are all incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.<br>
One of the most promising compounds described in these patents is ammonium trichloro(dioxyethylene-0,0')tellurate, which is also referred to herein and in the art as AS101. AS101, as a representative example of the family of tellurium-containing compound discussed hereinabove, exhibits antiviral (Nat. Immun. Cell Growth ReguL 7(3):163-8, 1988; AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 8(5):613-23, 1992), and tumoricidal activity (Nature 330(6144): 173-6, 1987; J. Clin. Oncol. 13(9):2342-53, 1995; J Immunol. 161(7):3536-42,1998.<br>
It has been suggested that AS 101, as well as other tellurium-containing immunomodulators, stimulate the innate and acquired arm of the immune response. For example, it has been shown that AS 101 is a potent activator of interferon (IFN) (IFN) in mice (J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 88(18): 1276-84, 1996) and humans (Nat. Immun. Cell Growth ReguL 9(3):182-90, 1990; Immunology 70(4):473-7, 1990; J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 88(18): 1276-84, 1996.)<br>
It has also been demonstrated that AS101, as well as other tellurium-containing immunomodulators, induce the secretion of a spectrum of cytokines, such as IL-la, IL-6 and TNF-oc, and that macrophages are one main target for AS 101 (Exp. Hematol. 23(13): 1358-66, 1995) and it was found to inhibit IL-10 at the m-RNA level, and this inhibition may cause an increase in EL-12 (Cell Immunol. 176(2): 180-5, 1997); J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 88(18): 1276-84, 1996).<br>
Other publications describing the immunomodulation properties of AS 101 include, for example, "The immunomodulator AS 101 restores T(H1) type of response suppressed by Babesia rodhaini in BALB/c mice". Cell Immunol 1998 Feb; "Predominance of TH1 response in tumor-bearing mice and cancer patients treated with AS 101". J Natl Cancer Inst 1996 Sep; "AS-101: a modulator of in vitro T-cell proliferation". Anticancer Drugs 1993 Jun; "The immunomodulator AS 101 admini stered orally as a chemoprotective and radioprotective agent". Int J Immunopharmacol 1992 May; "Inhibition of the reverse transcriptase activity and replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 by AS 101 in vitro". AIDS Res<br><br>
Hum Retroviruses 1992 May; "Immunomodulatory effects of AS 101 on interleukin-2 production and T-lymphocyte function of lymphocytes treated with psoralens and ultraviolet A". Photodermatol Photoimmunol Photomed 1992 Feb; "Use and mechanism of action of AS 101 in protecting bone marrow colony forming units-granulocyte-macrophage following purging with ASTA-Z 7557". Cancer Res 1991 Oct 15; "The effect of the immunomodulator agent AS101 on interleukin-10 production in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) induced in mice by a pathogenic anti-DNA antibody". Clin Exp Immunol 1990 Mar; "Toxicity study in rats of a tellurium based immunomodulating drug, AS-101; a potential drug for ADDS and cancer patients". Arch Toxicol 1989; "The biological activity and immunotherapeutic properties of AS-101, a synthetic organotellurium compound". Nat Immun Cell Growth Regid 1988; and "A new immunomodulating compound (AS-101) with potential therapeutic application". Nature 1987 Nov.<br>
In addition to its immunomodulatory effect, AS 101 is also characterized by low toxicity. Toxicity tests have shown that LD50 values in rats following intravenous and intramuscular administration of AS 101 are 500-1000 folds higher than the immunologically effective dose.<br>
While AS 101 and its immunomodulating properties has been studied, bis-tellurium compounds and their properties have never been suggested nor practiced hitherto.<br>
There is thus a widely recognized need for and it would be highly advantageous to have novel compounds, which are characterized as non toxic and which can be utilized in the treatment of medical conditions such as those delineated above.<br>

Preferably, n and m are each 0. More preferably, each of Ri, R4, R5 and R« is hydrogen or alkyl. More preferably, each of Rj, R*, R5 and R8 is hydrogen.<br>
The presently most preferred compound according to the present embodiments has the general Formula I above, wherein n and m are each 0 and each of Ri-Rg is hydrogen. The preparation and analytical data of this compound is detailed in Example 1 in the Examples section that follows.   This compound is referred to<br><br>
hereinafter as SAS.<br>
The compounds of the present embodiments are typically prepared by reacting substantially equimolar amounts of a tellurium tetralkoxide and tartaric acid. These materials are combined in the presence of a water-free organic solvent, such as dried ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide, i-propanol, and the like. Generally, the reaction may take place at ambient conditions, but, if desired, higher or lower temperatures and higher or lower pressures may be utilized.<br>
Certain of the tellurium tetralkoxide compounds are known, and others may be prepared according to the method of Mehorta et aL, [J. Indian Chem. Soc. 42: 1 (1965)], which is incorporated by reference.<br>
The compounds described herein can further be in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to a charged species of the parent compound and its counter ion, which is typically used to modify the solubility characteristics of the parent compound and/or to reduce any significant irritation to an organism by the parent compound, while not abrogating the biological activity and properties of the administered compound.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be used in the treatment of pathologies associated with defects in the cell death pathway. These pathologies include inflammatory, autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases, various forms of cancer, and developmental defects.<br>
As discussed in the Background section hereinabove, it is known that in apoptotic responses, the family of cysteine proteases operates in a cascade mechanism, involving first initiators, then effectors. It has been found recently that ICE also requires "initiators", in particular, caspase -11 and -4, in order to become active (Ann. Rev. Immunol 17: 781-828, 1999). Inhibition of IL-18 and IL-lp maturation in viti-o and in vivo by AS101 may be due not only to its effect on caspase-1, but also partly due to its effect on other caspases which are required for the recruitment of ICE.<br>
As described in the Examples section below, a representative compound according to the present embodiments, was prepared (see, Example 1). As shown in Example 2, it was unexpectedly found that the compounds of the present invention are ICE-inhibitors. They also inhibit the activity of two known substrates for ICE: IL-18 and EL-lp (see, Example 3). ICE inhibitors and their activities are described in U.S.<br><br>
6,531,474 and U.S. 6,716,818, which are incorporated by reference.<br>
The compound of Example 1 was tested for its inhibitory activity towards a member of the cysteine protease family, caspase-1 (ICE- Interleukin-1 P converting enzyme). The enzymatic reaction was carried out with caspase-1 specific colorimetric substrate, AC-YVAD-pNA, and in the absence or the presence of the tellurium compound of example 1 at different concentrations. The enzyme activity was tested for 1 hour and measured at 405 nm.<br>
Figure 3 shows the direct inhibition of ICE activity by the compound of Example 1 in a substrate specific enzymatic assay that demonstrates that the compound of Example 1 inhibits caspase-1 activity. 0 \iM in the graph represents enzyme activity in the absence of the compound of Example 1, as a positive control. A caspase-1 specific inhibitor (AC-YVAD-p-NA) was added at the concentration of 0.1 (iM as an internal control for the assay. The results, as presented in Figure 3, expressed as percentage of residual enzymatic activity, show that the compound of Example 1 can directly, in a concentration dependent maimer, inhibit ICE activity.<br>
Following the direct inhibition of caspase-1 activity, it was determined that the compound of Example 1 is capable of inhibiting two of ICE's substrates; EL-18 and IL-lp (see, Example 3 in the Examples section that follows). SAC was used as a bacterial antigen, which is capable of stimulating PMBC to produce and secrete these two highly active inflammatory cytokines. Treatment with the compound of Example 1 in a concentration dependent manner was found to decrease SAC-induced secretion levels of IL-18 (see, Figure 4) and IL-lp (see, Figure 5) after 24 hours. The decrease in IL-18 and IL-lp secretion was significant, starting form 0.5 to 1 ng/ml (p
The data presented herein suggest that SAS (a representative compound according to the present embodiments described in Example 1, as well as related tellurium-containing compounds, may contribute a significant role in balancing the immune response in many pathophysiological conditions, via inhibition of the caspase-1 (ICE) enzyme.<br>
The present invention therefore provides a method of treating or preventing a condition in which inhibition of interleukin-1 p-converting enzyme is beneficial,<br><br>
comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a tellurium-containing compound of general formula I.<br>
Conditions in which inhibition of interleukin-lp-converting enzyme is beneficial include, without limitation, IL-1 mediated disease, an inflammatory dis -lse (such as, for example, septic shock, septicemia, adult respiratory distress syndrome, arthritis, cholangitis, colitis, encephalitis, hepatitis, pancreatitis and reperfusion injury), an autoimmune disease (such as, for example, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, chronic thyroiditis, Graves' disease, autoimmune gastritis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune neutropenia, throbocytopenia, chronic active hepatitis, myasthenia gravis and multiple sclerosis), an ischemic disease (such as, for example, cerebral ischemia, myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, stroke, ischemic kidney disease; an immune based diseases, and hypersensitivity), a destructive bone disorder, a proliferative disorder, an infectious disease, a neurodegenerative disease (such as, for example, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and primary lateral sclerosis), a disease associated with cell death, an excess dietary alcohol intake disease, retinal disorders, uveitis, inflammatory peritonitis, osteoarthritis, pancreatitis, asthma, glomerulonephritis, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, atopic dermatitis, scarring, graft vs host disease, organ transplant rejection, organ apoptosis after bum injury, osteoporosis, leukemia and related disorders, myelodysplastic syndrome, multiple myeloma-related bone disorder, acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, metastatic melanoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, multiple myeloma, haemorrhagic shock, sepsis, bums, Shigellosis, Huntington's disease, Kennedy's disease, prion disease, epilepsy, acute and chronic heart disease, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, atherosclerosis, coronary artery bypass graft, spinal muscular atrophy, HIV-related encephalitis. aging, neurological damage due to stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, yellow fever, dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, liver disease, renal disease, polycystic kidney disease, H. pylori-associated gastric and duodenal ulcer disease, HIV infection, tuberculosis, an immunotherapy for the treatment of various forms of cancer, organ failure, meningitis and a complication associated with coronary artery bypass grafts.<br>
The present invention further provides a method of treating or preventing<br><br>
obesity, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of the compound of Formula I.<br>
The effect of the compounds described herein in preventing weight gain was also studied, as described in Example 4. It was found that the compound of Example 1 prevents weight gain when given intraperitoneally (ip) to ob/ob mice.<br>
The effect of the compound of Example 1 was investigated in vivo, on body and fat composition in mice under standard diet. Mice treated with the compound of Example 1 every other day for 10 weeks gained significantly less body weight than untreated mice under a standard diet (see„ Figure 6).<br>
In summary, the novel compounds described herein are useful for treating obesity, and related diseases (e.g., diabetes).<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered orally, alone for the treatment of obesity and/or type 2 diabetes or in combination with insulin or other antihyperglycemic drugs such as thiazolidinedione derivatives. If administered in combination with insulin, it may be possible to reduce the patient's normal dose, of insulin. For example, EP 749751 (which is incorporated herein by reference) teaches pharmaceutical compositions comprising an insulin sensitivity enhancer, which could be a thiazolidinedione compound, in combination with other antidiabetics. More specifically, EP 749751 teaches that the preferred insulin sensitivity enhancer is pioglitazone, which can be combined with other antidiabetics such as metformin, phenformin or buformin, trolitazone and metformin. Other combinations of antihyperglycemic drugs and thiazolidinedione derivatives can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,524,621; 6,475,521; 6,451,342 and 6,153,632 and PCT patent applications WO 01/3594 and WO 01/3594, which are incorporated herein by reference. The dose for the other antihyperglycemic drugs may be the known dose for the particular other antihyperglycemic drug.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be used for the treatment of conditions which have previously been described as amenable to treatment with ammonium trichloro(dioxyethylene-0?01,)tellurate (AS101). Many of those conditions are described in U.S. 4,752,614; U.S. 4,761,490; 4,764,461; and U.S. 4,929,739, which are incorporated herein by reference. These include use as an adjuvant for enhancing the immune response of a subject to an immunoeffector, for example via induction of<br><br>
interleukin-12; for treatment of alopecia, and as a neuroprotective agent, for example in the treatment and prevention of neurodegenerative processes caused by trauma.<br>
The tellurium compound is administered in a therapeutically effective amount. The term "therapeutically effective amount" or "pharmaceutically effective amount5' denotes that dose of an active ingredient or a composition comprising the active ingredient that will provide the therapeutic effect for which the active ingredient is indicated. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for use in context of the present invention include compositions wherein the active ingredients are contained in an amount effective to achieve the intended purpose. More specifically, a therapeutically effective amount means an amount of active ingredients effective to prevent, alleviate or ameliorate symptoms of disease or prolong the survival of the subject being treated.<br>
Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the active ingredients described herein can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in vitro, in cell cultures or experimental animals. The data obtained from these in vitro and cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The exact formulation, route of administration and dosage can be chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition. [See e.g., Fingl, et al, (1975) "The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics", Ch. 1  p. 1 ] .<br>
In any of the different embodiments of the method of the present invention, the tellurium-containing compounds described herein can be provided to a subject either per se, or as part of a pharmaceutical composition where it is mixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
As used herein a "pharmaceutical composition" refers to a preparation of one or more of the active ingredients described herein with other chemical components such as physiologically suitable carriers and excipients. The purpose of a pharmaceutical composition is to facilitate administration of a compound to the subject treated<br>
Hereinafter, the phrases "physiologically acceptable carrier" and "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" which may be interchangeably used refer to a carrier or a diluent that does not cause significant irritation to the subject and does not abrogate the biological activity and properties of the administered compound. As used herein, the term "carrier" refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with<br><br>
which the therapeutic is administered.<br>
Herein the term "excipient" refers to an inert substance added to a pharmaceutical composition to further facilitate administration of an active ingredient. Examples, without limitation, of excipients include calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars and types of starch, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, vegetable oils and polyethylene glycols.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents may be, for example, binders, (e.g., syrup, gum Arabic, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, polyvinylpyrrolidone, etc), excipients (e.g., lactose, sucrose, com starch, sorbitol), lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, talc, polyethylene glycol, silica, etc.), disintegrants (e.g. microcrystalline cellulose, potato starch, etc.), wetting agents (e.g. sodium lauryl sulfate, etc.), and the like. These pharmaceutical preparations may be in the form of a solid preparation such as tablets, capsules, powders, etc., or in the form of a liquid preparation such as solution, suspension, emulsion, etc., when administered orally. When administered parenteraliy, the pharmaceutical preparations may be in the form of a suppository, an injection or an intravenous drip, a physiological salt solution, and so on.<br>
Therapeutic application of SAS and other tellurium compounds, can be contemplated to be accomplished by any suitable therapeutic method and technique presently or prospectively known to those skilled in the art. The tellurium compound may be administered in a variety of forms. These include orally, parenteraliy, rectally, nasally, topically or via inhalation. The parenteral route of administration may be intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, etc.<br>
In general, the composition of the subject invention will be formulated such that an effective amount of bioactive tellurium compound is combined with a suitable carrier in order to facilitate effective administration of the composition. The oral administration may be as a solid dosage form i.e. tablet with conventional excipients such as lactose, microcrystalline cellulose and the like.<br>
It has been found that the tellurium compounds useful in the practice of the invention will hydrolyze in the presence of water. These hydrolyzed compositions are active in vivo and in vitro although the hydrolyzed compositions eventually decompose. For this reason, it is recommended that the compositions be freshly prepared or administered orally in the dry form. Preferably, the compounds should be<br><br>
kept under anhydrous conditions until just prior to being used.<br>
Dosages can be titrated to the individual patient. The dose of SAS or a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof varies depending on the exact formulation, route of administration, ages, weights and condition of individual patients, or the severity of the disease.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Reference is now made to the following examples, which together with the above descriptions, illustrate the invention in a non limiting fashion.<br>
EXAMPLE 1 Preparation ofSAS- an exemplary bis-tellurium compound<br>
Tellurium tetra-isopropoxide was prepared according to the procedure set forth by Mehrota et al., [J. Indian Client, Soc.} 1965, 42, 1Tartaric acid (0.3 gram) was dissolved in 3.00 ml of dried ethanol, which was dried by flashing dry argon gas into Hie reaction flask. To the dissolved tartanic acid, 0.5 ml of tellurium tetra-isopropoxide was added in the presence of dry argon gas. The mixture was stirred at room temperature (25 °C) for 24 hours and the compound obtained from the reaction of tartaric acid and tellurium tetra-isopropoxide was precipitated. Centrifugation followed by decantation was used to separate the solid compound. The compound was washed with dried ethanol and dried by vacuum (0.1 mm/Hg, at 25 °C for 24 hours).<br>
Melting point (mp) was 220 °C(d).<br>
The elemental analysis for CioHioC&gt;3Te2 was: calcu; C: 20.28 %;H: 1.53%;Te: 43.08%.<br><br>
found: C: 20.44 %;H: 1.83%;Te: 44.51%.<br>
The IR spectrum of the obtained product is shown in Figurel.<br>
lH-NMR (D6-DMSO): 5 = 3.344 (H20), 4.696 (SAS) ppm.<br>
I3C-NMR (D6-DMSO): 5 = 76.62,273.89 ppm.<br>
125Te-NMR (D6-DMSO): 5 = 1463.06 ppm.<br>
The crystallographic data of the obtained product are presented in Tables 1-3 below and is further shown in Figure 2..<br>
The positional parameters for (041) Sigal P21are presented in Table 1 below.<br>
The intramolecular distances involving the non-hydrogen atoms are presented in Table 2 (standard deviation given in parenthesis to least significant figure).<br>
The intramolecular bond angles involving the non-hydrogen atoms (angles in degrees; Standard deviation given in least significant figure in parenthesis) are presented in Table 3.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The atom designator code (ADC) specifies the position of an atom in a crystal. The 5-digit number shown in the table is a composite of three one digit numbers and one two digit number: TA(lst digit) + TB (2nd digit) + TC (3rd digit) + SN(4th and 5th digit). TA, TB and TC are the crystal latice translation digits along cell edges a, b, and c. A translation digit of 5 indicates the origin unit cell. If TA=4, this indicates a translation of one unit cell length along the a axis from 1 to 9 and thus (+/-) 4 latice translations from the origin (TA=5, TB=53 TC=5) can be represented.<br>
The SN or symmetry operator number refers to the number of the symmetry operator used to generate the coordinates of the target atom. A list of the symmetry operators relevant to this structure are given below.<br>
For a given intermolecular contact, the first atom (origin atom) is located in the origin unit cell (TA=5, TB=5, TC=5) and its position can be generated using the identity operator (SN=1). Thus, the ADC for an origin atom is always ADC=5550L The position of the second atom (target atom) can be generated using the ADC and the coordinates of that atom in the parameter table. For example, an ADC of 47502 refers to the target atom moved through operator two, then translated -1 cell translations along t he a axis, +2 cell translations along the b axis, and 0 cell translations along the c axis.<br>
An ADC of 1 indicates an intermolecular contact between two fragments (i.e. cation and anion) that reside in the same asymmetric unit<br>
Symmetry Operators:<br>
(1)+X,+Y,  +Z    (2) -X, 1/2+Y, -Z<br>
EXAMPLE 2 Inhibition ofcaspase-1/interleukin-p-converting enzyme<br>
Cells: Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from randomly selected healthy donors by Ficoll-Hypaque (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) density-gradient centrifugation. PBMC were adjusted to 2.5 x 106 cells/mi and cultured in enriched RPMI 1640 medium (Biological industries, Kibbutz Beit Haemek, Israel) with 10 % Fetal Calf Serum (FCS) (Biological Industries) at 37 °C and 7 % C02.<br>
Reagents: The following bacterial antigens, antibodies and peptides were applied:  heat-inactivated  Staphylococcus  aureus  Cowan   strain   (SAC(10    v/v;<br><br>
Calbiochem, Bad Homburg, Germany), Lipopolysaccharide [LPS (40-60ng/ml, in vitro) and (0.5mg/mouse, in vivo); salmonella Enteritidis, Sigma Aldrich, Rehovot, Israel), rCaspase-l and specific inhibitor (Ac-YVAD-CHO) (Biomol and International Industries L.P. Canada). Caspase-1 colorimetric substrate (AC-YVAD-pNA) (Alexis Biochemicals, Inc. San Diego, Calif). The compound of Example 1 was supplied by the Chemistry Department at Bar Iian University, in a solution of PBS, pH 7.4 (Example 10 of U.S. 4,764,461, which is incorporated by reference) and maintained at 4°C.<br>
In vitro studies: Cells were first treated with various concentrations of the compound of Example 1 (SAS) and after 1 hour SAC was added. After 24 hours, supematants were collected and evaluated for cytokine content. Viability at the end of these experiments, as assessed by trypan blue exclusion method, was always found to be greater than 95 %.<br>
DTT (Dithiothreitol), which is present in the commercial enzyme solution, interacts with the compound of Example 1 and would thus interfere with the inhibition studies. Therefore removal of the DTT from the enzyme solution prior to the enzymatic assay was necessary. Gel permeation chromatography was carried out at 4 °C. 50^,1 solution of commercial activated rCaspase-l was loaded on a 1X15cm Sephadex G-15 column (Pharmacia), pre-equilibrated with assay buffer containing: 50 mM Hepes, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 % CHAPS, 1 mM EDTA, 10 % Glycerol at pH 7.4, the enzyme was eluted with the same buffer (DEGASSED) at 0.5 ml/min and 500(4,1 fractions were collected. The enzyme-substrate reaction was measured continuously with 1 minute intervals for a total time of 1 hour at 30 °C and was read at 405 nm. The total volume of the reaction was 100 \il and contained as following: 50pl rCaspase-l (0.8U/fil), 25 ^1 colorimetric substrate (Ac-YVAD-pNA, 200^iM), 25 jal of the compound of Example 1 at various concentration (2.550 pM, 5 JIM, 10 JJM) in assay buffer. Results are shown in Figure 3.<br>
Statistical analysis: Data are presented as mean +SE. For comparisons of means of the various groups, the pair wise t test was used<br><br>

IL-18 and IL-lp byPMBC<br>
The compound described in Example 1 (SAS) was delivered to the medium 1 hour before stimulation with SAC. Optimal concentration of SAC for cytokine secretion stimulation was 10'3 V/V (data not shown).<br>
PBMC (2.5 x 106 cells/ml) were treated with various concentration of the tellurium compound of Example 1 and after 1 hour were stimulated with SAC (10° V/V). It was found that SAS decreased SAC-induced secretion levels of IL-18 (Figure 4) and IL-lp (Figure 5). Results as shown in Figures 4 and 5 represent means +JSE of three experiments **p
EXAMPLE 4 Prevention of weight gain by SAS<br>
Animal experiments were performed in accordance with approved institutional protocols and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.<br>
Female ob/ob mice 7 weeks old were injected intraperitoneal^ (ip) with SAS (10 fig/ml in PBS) every other day. Control animals were injected every other day with PBS. Body weight was monitored on a daily basis.<br>
It was found that weight gain was prevented in the SAS-treated mice.<br>
Additional results, presented in Figure 6, show the effect of the compound of Example 1 on reducing/preventing weight gain in mice, as compared with non-treated mice fed with the same standard diet.<br>
EXAMPLE 5 Effect of SAS in treatment of hair loss<br>
A patient suffering from hair loss applies a spray containing 0.017 % SAS in 20 % propylene glycol, 20 % water and 60 % ethyl alcohol twice daily. The results are monitored at commencement of the study, after about 1 month, after about 3 months, ind after about 6 months. Hair density, terminal hair density, and velius hair density ire analyzed, using the Dating Image DB image archiving system, and TichoScan software.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 6 Effect ofSAS on IL-12 production by human monocytes<br>
Adherent Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) from a tuberculin-negative healthy donor are incubated with SAS (0.87-3.5 ng/ml PBS) or R coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1 ng/ml PBS; Sigma) for 24 hours. Supematants are collected after 28 hours for analysis of IL-12 production. Cell supematants are determined using commercially available Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kits (R&amp;D Systems). Supematants are tested for IL-12p40 by ELISA kit (Endogene).<br>
EXAMPLE 7 Effects of SAS on IL-12 p40 production by murine bone marrow-derived<br>
dendritic cells<br>
Murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DC) are prepared by culturing bone marrow cells from the femur and tibia of mice in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% supernatant from a granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor-secreting cell line.<br>
On day 7 of culture, cells are collected, washed, and resuspended in RPMI medium. DC (106 cells/ml) are cultured with SAS (0.87-17.5 \iglm\) or with CpG. Supematants are collected after 24 hours for analysis of IL-12 p40 production. Cell supematants are determined using commercially available ELISA kits (R&amp;D Systems).<br>
EXAMPLE 8 Effects of SAS on serum antibody responses to KLH<br>
Serum was obtained from mice immunized with depyrogenated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) (5 \ig\ Calbiochem, La Jolla, Calif); or with KLH plus phosphorothioate-stabilized oligodeoxynucleotide-containing CpG motifs (CpG-ODN) (5'-GCTAGACGTTAGCGT-3'), synthesized by Sigma-Genosys Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom; or with KLH, plus CpG, plus SAS (17.5 jig/ml PBS); or with Dulbecco's PBS (Sigma, Poole, United Kingdom) in a final volume of 50 \il.<br>
On day 7 after the first or second immunization, mice are sacrificed by cervical<br><br>
dislocation, and serum and popliteal lymph nodes collected in the presence or absence of SAS (17.5 ng/ml). Titers of KLH-specific IgGl and IgG2a in the serum of immunized mice are determined by ELISA, and analysed for the presence of antibody subclasses IgGl and IgG2a.<br>
EXAMPLE 9 Assessment of the neuroprotective effects of SAS<br>
To assess the neuroprotective effects of SAS, PC 12 cells are maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 8 % heat inactivated horse serum, 8% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, glutamine (5mM) and 50 |ig/ml gentamycin at 37° C.<br>
PC 12 cells are washed in serum-free medium, resuspended to l-5xl06cells/ml. After 24 hours of incubation at 37°C in culture, the cells are supplemented with 3ml of medium (RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS, 2% glutamine and lmg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). After another 24 hours, cells are resuspended and maintained in the selection medium. After 3-4 weeks in selective medium, transfected cells are analyzed for via Western blotting. Results are expressed as percent p21 as compared to the negative (no drug) control.<br>
The ras Asn-17 gene is then cloned into a mammalian expression vector. Transfection of PC 12 cells with the plasmid DNA is performed with the calcium phosphate precipitation technique.<br>
PC 12 cell extracts (20^g/lane of protein) boiled under reducing conditions, are subjected to electrophoresis on 7.5 and 12.5% polyacryiamide gels and electro-transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membrane is blocked for one hour with 10% powdered milk in 0.2% Tween 20, Tris-buffered saline, and then incubated with the appropriate specific detecting antibodies. Immunoreactive proteins are detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL) and a chemiluminescence reagent. For immunoprecipitation studies, immune complexes are precipitated with Protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia) and, following electrophoresis, blotted with anti-phosphoserine or anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies.<br>
Endogenous JNK and erk are immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with<br><br>
specific antibodies and their activities measured by using P ATP and glutathione s-transferase (GST) e-jun or myelin basic protein (MPB) respectively, as the substrate. Samples are run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and subjected to Phosphorlmager analysis.<br>
EXAMPLE 10 Activation of the Ras superfamily GTPases<br>
The effect of SAS on signaling pathways that are controlled by Ras superfamily GTPases is screened by parallel analysis of the activation of the Ras family GTPases and their effectors. The primary methods used for studying activation of different Ras superfamily GTPases are: (a) pull down of activated Ras superfamily GTPases from cell lysates, by binding of the specific recombinant purified effector GTPase binding domains to the activated GTP bound form. Subsequent to the pull down of the activated GTPases, the proteins are detected and quantified by western blotting; (b) activation of GTPases effectors such as Raf or RAC, by reporter gene assays; and (c) direct immunoprecipitation kinase assays.<br>
EXAMPLE 11 Detection of Apoptosis<br>
The percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis is quantitatively determined using an Apoptosis Detection kit, on the basis of their ability to bind annexin V and exclude iodide, and also by an in situ cell detection kit incorporating HTC labeling andTUNEL.<br>
