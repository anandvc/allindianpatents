PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION OF GLUCOPYRANOSYLOXYPYRAZOLE DERIVATIVE<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a method for preparing glucopyranosyloxypyrazole derivatives useful as intermediates for manufacturing medicaments.<br>
[0002]-[0006]<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for preparing the glucopyranosyloxypyrazole derivatives which are useful as agents for the prevention or treatment of a disease associated with hyperglycemia such as diabetes, diabetic complications, obesity or the like. For example, the present invention relates to a method for preparing a glucopyranosyloxypyrazole derivative represented by the general formula:<br>
[Chem.]<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R , R , R , R and R may be the same or different, each of them is a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a C1-6 alkyl group, ahaloC1-6alkylgroup, aC3-6ycloalkyl group, aC3-6cycloalkyloxy group, a C3-6 cycloalkyl (C1-6 alkoxy) group, a C1-6 alkoxy group,<br>
a C1-6 alkylthio group, a haloC1-6 alkoxy group, an aryl group, an aryloxy group, a heteroaryl group, an aryl (C1-6 alkyl) group, an aryl(C1-6 alkoxy) group, a C2-6 alkenyl group, a C2-6 alkynyl group, a heteroC3-6 cycloalkyl group, a heteroC3-6 cycloalkyloxy group, a heteroC3-6 cycloalkyl (C1-6 alkyl) group, a C1-6 alkoxy group substituted by an amino group which is mono-substituted by a C1-6 alkyl group or a C1-6 alkoxy group substituted by an amino group which is di-substituted by a C1-6 alkyl group, R is a C1-6 alkyl group, a haloC1-6 alkyl group or a C3-6 cycloalkyl group, R  is a hydrogen atom, a C1-6 alkyl group, a C3-6 cycloalkyl group, a C3-6cycloalkyl-substitutedC1-6 alkyl group, anaryl(C1-6 alkyl) group, a heteroC3-6 cycloalkyl group, a heteroC3-6 cycloalkyl(C1-6 alkyl) group or a group forming a prodrug, and Q is a group represented by the general formula: [Chem.2]<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which P is a hydrogen atom or a group forming a prodrug. As the glucopyranosyloxypyrazole derivative, in addition, for example, Patent References 1 to 13 as described below can be illustrated.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0007]<br>
It has been reported that the glucopyranosyloxypyrazole derivatives represented by the above general formula (A) are useful as agents for the prevention or treatment of a disease<br>
associated with hyperglycemia such as diabetes, diabetic complications, obesity or the like (for example, see Patent References 1 to 13). [0008]-[0010]<br>
Previously, as the method for preparing the glucopyranosyloxypyrazole derivatives represented by the above general formula (A), glycosylation using a benzylpyrazole derivative represented by the general formula: [Chem. 3]<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R66  is a C1-6 alkyl group, and R and R have the same meanings as defined above, and a hydroxy-protected α-D-glucopyranosylhalogen derivative in the presence of silver carbonate or silver oxide containing silver that is a heavy metal has been reported (for example, see Patent References 1 to 6) .<br>
[0011]<br>
However, when the glycosylation is carried out for a hydroxy-protected α-D-glucopyranosylbromide using the pyrazole derivative represented by the above general formula<br>
(II) wherein R is a lower alkyl group under reported condition, side reactions that the pyrazole derivative represented by the above general formula (II) used in the reaction reacts with each other or that a nitrogen atom on the pyrazole ring is glycosylated occur, and the problems could not be avoided. And a problem that a special purification process to remove those by-products was needed existed. Furthermore, conditions to use a strong<br><br>
base or a reagent that contains silver that is the heavy metal was examined to suppress the side reaction. However, when the heavy metal is used for the manufacturing process of a medicine, a special purification process is necessary so that the heavy metal used does not remain in the medicine, and various analyze characteristics to be inspected to confirm whether the heavy metal remains in the medicine have to be conducted, therefore, there was a problem that a number of complex working increased. Heretofore, it is reported that reaction time becomes long if silver is not used, and for example, it requires several days to glycosylate, though other glycosylations without the use of the reagent that contains silver are examined to solve these problems (see Patent Reference 6). On the other hand, though a method by adding a phase-transfer catalyst to shorten the time of the glycosylation is also examined, so this time, various problems such as a problem that large excess of a sugar donor is needed, a problem that reactive yield is not constant, and a problem that conduct on an industrial scale is difficult are caused. [0012]-[0017]<br>
On the other hand, in Patent Reference 14, a method for obtaining a 5-thio-D-glucopyranoside derivative represented by the general formula: [Chem.6]<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
by subjecting a pyrazole derivative represented by the general<br>
formula:<br>
[Chem.4]<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
and 2, 3, 4, 6-tetra-0-acetyl-5-thio-D-glucose represented by a<br>
formula:<br>
[Chem.5]<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
to Mitsunobu reaction that uses triphenylphosphine and diisopropylazodicarboxylate is described. However, this reaction is different from the present invention because it is a different product (a 5-thio-D-glucopyranoside derivative) by a different method for preparing (Mitsunobu reaction) by the<br><br>
use of a different substrate 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-5-thio-D-glucose. Moreover, in the above Patent Reference 14, it is not described that this reaction is applicable to manufacturing of an α-D-glucopyranosylhalogen derivative. And because the α/β selectivity of the product is not excellent, Mitsunobu reaction described in the above Patent Reference 14 has a problem that another process to remove the product of unnecessary configuration is needed, and unnecessary product should be disposed in economical respect. And Mitsunobu reaction has a problem of generating triphenylphosphine oxide difficult to remove as a by-product. <br>
[0018]<br>
As mentioned above, the methods ever reported are not always satisfactory, and the development of a easier and more efficient process of manufacturing has been desired. Patent Reference 1: International Publication W002/053573 pamphlet;<br>

 (I) as a manufacturing intermediate, without using the reagent containing silver that is the heavy metal which has been reported up to now. Moreover, unlike with the method using a benzylpyrazole derivative represented by the above general formula (II) , a method for preparing the present invention is an excellent method that has improved the side reaction which a pyrazole derivative used in the reaction reacts with each other and a nitrogen atom on the pyrazole ring is glycosylated even<br>
if a hydroxy-protected a-D-glucopyranosylhalogen derivative is used. Moreover, by the method for manufacturing of the present invention a compound represented by the general formula (IV) can be stereoselectively prepared in extremely high a/(3 selectivity, and the generation of an unnecessary product can be suppressed. And thus, it is a very excellent method from respect of manufacturing cost. <br>
[0067]<br>

(Scheme Removed)<br><br>
[0068]<br>
In the formula, R1,R2,R3,R4,R5,R6,R7,PG1,Q1, and X have the same meanings as defined above. <br>
[0069] Process 1<br>
The glycosylated compound represented by the above general formula (IV) can be prepared by allowing a benzylpyrazole derivative (I) to react with a sugar donor represented by the above general formula (III) in an inert solvent, in the presence of abase, usually at 20 to 60 °C.

mixture was stirred at room temperature for 12 hours.  In addition, to the mixture was added potassium carbonate (0. 053 g) , and the mixture was stirred for 2 hours. The reaction mixture was poured into water to precipitate the solid. The solids were collected by filtration. The obtained solids were washed with water and dried under reduced pressure to give 4-benzyl-5-isopropyl-3- (2, 3, 4, 6-tetra-0-pivaloyl-β-D-glucopyranosyloxy) -1H-pyrazole (0.098 g).

To solution of 4-benzyl-l,2-dihydro-l-formyl-5-isopropyl-3H-pyrazol-3-one (1.07g) in acetonitrile (20mL) were added potassium carbonate (0.905 g) and 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-pivaloyl-α-D-glucopyranosyl bromide (2.65 g) under stirring at room temperature.  In addition, the mixture was heated to 50 °C and stirred for 1 hour. After the reaction completed, the insoluble materials were removed by filtration, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (eluent: n-hexane/ethyl acetate = 10/1) to give 4-benzyl-l-formyl-5-isopropyl-3- (2,3,4, 6-tetra-0-pivaloyl-β-D-glucopyranosyl-oxy)-1H-pyrazole (1.49 g) .<br>
