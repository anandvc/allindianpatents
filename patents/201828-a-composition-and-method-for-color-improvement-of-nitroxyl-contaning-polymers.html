				<td>The invention relates to a composition and process for color improvement of nitroxyl or nitroxyl ether containing polymers.<br>
Stable free nitrify radicals or nitrify ethers are for example useful in controlled free radical polymerization (CFRP) and by this way incorporated into the polymer in a significant amount, leading in some cases to slightly colored polymers.<br>
Controlled free radical polymerization (CFRP) of ethylenically unsaturated monomers has attracted continuing attention, because of its capability to produce polymers with narrow molecular weight distributions and controlled architecture such as block copolymers.<br>
US-A-4 581 429 to Solomon et a!., issued April 8,1986, discloses a free radical polymeriza¬tion process which controls the growth of polymer chains to produce short chain or oligo-meric photopolymers and copolymers, including block and graft copolymers. The process employs an initiator having the formula (in part) R'R"N-0-X, where X is a free radical species capable of polymerizing unsaturated monomers. The reactions typically have low conversion rates. Specifically mentioned radical R'R"N-0« groups are derived from 1,1,3,3 tetraethylisoindoline, 1,1,3,3 tetrapropylisoindoline, 2,2,6,6 tetramethylpiperidine, 2,2,5,5 tetramethylpyrrolidine or di-t-butylamine.<br>
US 5322912 to Georges et al. issued June 21, 1994 discloses a polymerization process using a free radical initiator, a polymerizable monomer compound and a stable free radical agent of the basic structure R'R"N-0« for the synthesis of photopolymers and block copolymers.<br>
WO 98/13392 describes open chain alkoxyamine compounds which have a symmetrical substitution pattern and are derived from NO gas or from nitro so compounds which are suitable regulators for this type of radical polymerization.<br>
EP-A-621 878 and EP-A-735 052 disclose a method for preparing thermoplastic polymers of narrow polydispersities by free radical-initiated polymerization, which comprises adding a free radical initiator and a stable free radical agent to the monomer compound.<br><br>
wo 96/24620 describes a polymerization process in which very specific stable free radical agents are used, such as for example  bearing a hydrogen atom in<br>
a-position to the nitrogen atom.<br>
WO 98/30601 discloses specific nitroxyls based on Imldazolidinones, which are also useful for stable free radical mediated polymerization.<br>
In addition WO 98/44008 discloses specific nitroxyls based on morpholinones, piperazinones and piperazinediones.<br>
All nitroxyl radicals useful in such controlled polymerization processes have inherently a reddish color.<br>
Polymers made in the presence of such stable nitroxyl radicals or nitroxyl ethers are end-capped by the nitroxyl group. The bond, polymer to nitroxyl group however is a labile bond, which cleaves upon heating, liberating again the nitroxyl radical and giving thus color to the polymer. The color formation depends, therefore, on the concentration of nitroxyl radical / nitroxylether used to synthesize the polymer.<br>
As many processing conditions include a heating step, e. g. removing not reacted monomer, shaping parts by extrusion, injection molding, blow molding and the like, undesirable discoloration accompanies these processes.<br>
The problem underlying the present invention is to counteract discoloration resulting from stable free nitroxyl radicals. This problem is solved by adding a reducing agent to the polymer, preferably during a processing step, such as extrusion or injection molding.<br>
One subject of the invention is a composition comprising.<br><br>
a) at least one oligomer, cooligomer, polymer or copolymer or blends thereof, containing a stable free nitroxyl radical ; and b) a reducing agent;<br>
with the proviso that the composition is essentially free of a polymerizable monomer.<br>
Essentially free of a polymerizable monomer means that in some cases there may be a small amount of monomer left from manufacturing the polymer, which could not be completely removed. Preferably no monomer at all is present. Usually the excess monomer is present in an amount of a few ppm.<br>
The nitroxyl radical may be present due to its admixture during polymerization, due to its admixture for monomer stabilization, due to its use as chain stopping agent or due to a grafting reaction after polymerization has been completed.<br>
The nitroxyl radical may be present as a mixture with the polymer or it may be partially bound to the polymer.<br>
The polymers, copolymers, oligomers or cooligomers which can be used in the present invention are listed below.<br>
1. Polymers of monoolefins and diolefins, for example polypropylene, polyisobutylene, po-lybut-1-ene, poly-4-methylpent-1-ene, polyisoprene or polybutadiene, as well as polymers of cycloolefins, for instance of cyclopentene or norbornene, polyethylene (which optionally can be crosslinked), for example high density polyethylene (HOPE), high density and high mole¬cular weight polyethylene (HDPE-HMW), high density and ultrahigh molecular weight poly¬ethylene (HDPE-UHMW), medium density polyethylene (MDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), (VLDPE) and (ULDPE).<br>
Polyolefins, i.e. the polymers of monoolefins exemplified in the preceding paragraph, prefe¬rably polyethylene and polypropylene, can be prepared by different, and especially by the following, methods:<br>
a)      radical polymerisation (normally under high pressure and at elevated temperature).<br><br>
b)      catalytic polymerisation using a catalyst that normally contains one or more than one metal of groups IVb, Vb, VIb or VIII of the Periodic Table. These metals usually have one or more than one ligand, typically oxides, halides, alcoholates, esters, ethers, amines, alkyls, alkenyls and/or aryls that may be either p- or s-coordinated. These metal complexes may be in the free form or fixed on substrates, typically on activated magnesium chloride, titanium(lli) chloride, alumina or silicon oxide. These catalysts may be soluble or Insoluble in the polymerisation medium. The catalysts can be used by themselves in the polymerisation or further activators may be used, typically metal alkyls, metal hydrides, metal alkyl halides, metal alkyl oxides or metal alkyloxanes, said metals being elements of groups la, lla and/or Ilia of the Periodic Table. The activators may be modified conveniently with further ester, ether, amine or silyl ether groups. These catalyst systems are usually termed Phillips, Standard Oil Indiana, Ziegler (-Natta), TNZ (DuPont), metallocene or single site catalysts (SSC).<br>

  An", wherein An"<br>
and Ra have the meaning as defined above and Re is methyl or benzyl. An" is preferably CI", Br'or"O3S-CH3.<br><br><br><br>
Particularly preferred ethylenically unsaturated monomers are styrene, methylacrylate, ethylacrylate, butylacrylate, isobutylacrylate, tert. butylacrylate, hydroxyethylacrylate, hydroxypropylacrylate, dimethylaminoethylacrylate, glycidylacrylates, methyl(meth)acrylate, ethyi(meth)acrylate, butyl(meth)acry!ate, hydroxyethyl(meth)acrylate, hydroxypropyl(meth)acrylate, dimethylamlnoethyl(meth)acrylate, glycldyl(meth)acrylates, acrylonltrile, acrylamide, methacrylamide or dimethylamlnopropyl-methacrylamide.<br>
The polymerization process may be carried out in the presence of an organic solvent or in the presence of water or in mixtures of organic solvents and water. Additional cosolvents or surfactants, such as glycols or ammonium salts of fatty acids, may be present. Other suitable cosolvents are described hereinafter.<br>
If organic solvents are used, suitable solvents or mixtures of solvents are typically pure alkanes (hexane, heptane, octane, isooctane), aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, xylene), halogenated hydrocarbons (chlorobenzene), aikanols (methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether), esters (ethyl acetate, propyl, butyl or hexyl acetate) and ethers (diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether), or mixtures thereof.<br>
The aqueous polymerization reactions can be supplemented with a water-miscible or hydrophilic cosolvent to help ensure that the reaction mixture remains a homogeneous single phase throughout the monomer conversion. Any water-soluble or water-miscible cosolvent may be used, as long as the aqueous solvent medium is effective in providing a solvent system which prevents precipitation or phase separation of the reactants or polymer products until after all polymerization reactions have been completed. Exemplary cosolvents useful in the present invention may be selected from the group consisting of aliphatic alcohols, glycols, ethers, glycol ethers, pyrrolidines, N-alkyI pyrrolidinones, N-alkyI pyrrolidones, polyethylene glycols, polypropylene glycols, amides, carboxylic acids and salts thereof, esters, organosulfides, sulfoxides, sulfones, alcohol derivatives, hydroxyether derivatives such as butyl carbitol or cellosolve, amino alcohols, ketones, and the like, as well as derivatives thereof and mixtures thereof. Specific examples include methanol, ethanol, propanol, dioxane, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, glycerol, dipropylene glycol, tetrahydrofuran, and other water-soluble or water-miscible materials, and mixtures thereof. When mixtures of water and water-soluble or water-miscible organic liquids are selected as the aqueous reaction media, the water to cosolvent weight ratio is typically in the range of about 100:0 to about 10:90.<br><br>
Furthermore CFRP is particularly useful for the preparation of block copolymers.<br>
Block copolymers are, for example, block copolymers of polystyrene and polydienes or polyacrylates (e.g., poly(styrene-b-butadiene), poly(styrene-b-isoprene), poly(styrene-£)-acrylate) or poly(styrene-j!)-acrylate-i)-styrene). They are usefull as adhesives or as compatibilizers for polymer blends or as polymer toughening agents. Poly(methylmethacrylate-6-acrylate) diblock copolymers or poly(methylacrylate-6-acrylate-6-methacrylate) triblock copolymers) are useful as dispersing agents for coating systeme, as coating additives (e.g. Theological agents, compatibilizers, reactive diluents) or as resin component in coatings(e.g. high solid paints) Block copolymers of styrene, (meth)acrylates and/or acrylonitrile are useful for plastics, elastomers and adhesives.<br>
Block copolymers prepared by CFRP, wherein the blocks alternate between polar monomers and non-polar monomers, are useful in many applications as amphiphilic surfactants or dispersants for preparing highly uniform polymer blends.<br>
The (co)polymers may have a number average molecular weight from 1 000 to 400000 g/mol, preferably from 2 000 to 250 000 g/mol and, more preferably, from 2 000 to 200 000 g/mol. The number average molecular weight may be determined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) or, if the initiator carries a group which can be easily distinguished from the monomer(s), by NMR spectroscopy or other conventional methods.<br>
A plurality of specifically designed polymers and copolymers are accessible by this type of controlled radical polymerization, such as star and graft (co)polymers as described, inter alia, by C. J. Hawker in Angew. Chemie, 1995, 107, pages 1623-1627, dendrimers as described by K. Matyaszewski et al. in Macromolecules 1996, Vol 29, No. 12, pages 4167-4171, graft (co)polymers as described by C.

Hawker in Macromolecules 1996, 29, 2686-2688, or diblock and triblock copolymers as described by N. A. Listigovers in Macromolecules 1996, 29, 8992-8993.<br>
Preferably the reducing agent is a cyclic ethylenically unsaturated compound having an aliylic hydrogen atom, a phosphorous compound with oxidation number l-IV and a valence of<br><br>

Another subject of the Invention is a process for improving the color of an oligomer, cooligomer, polymer or copolymer or blends thereof, containing a stable free nitroxyl radical<br><br>
by adding a reducing agent to said polymer and heating said mixture to above the glass temperature in case of amorphous polymers or above the melting point in case of crystalline or semi-crystalline polymers; with the proviso that essentially no polymerizable monomer Is present.<br>
There are different reasons, why stable free nitroxyl radicals may be present in a polymer One possibility Is that graft polymers have been prepared in the presence of a nitroxyl radical or a nitroxyl ether. Such a process typically comprises a first step A), wherein a stable<br><br>
nitroxyl radical is grafted onto a polymer, which step comprises heating a polymer and a compound containing a stable NO* radical to above the melting point of the polymer, mixing and reacting the components at said temperature; and in a second step B) the grafted polymer of step A) is heated in the presence of an ethylenically unsaturated monomer or oligomer to a temperature at which cleavage of the nitroxyl-polymer bond occurs.<br>
Such polymers, grafted in the presence of a nitroxyl radical or a nitroxyl ether are also a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The stable free nitroxyl radical may also be present in the polymer due to its admixture for monomer stabilization or due to its use as chain stopping agent.<br>
Preferred is a process for improving the color of polymers, obtained by radical polymerization, which polymerization has been carried out in the presence of a stable free<br>
nitroxyl radical  and a source of free radicals capable of initiating the<br>
polymerization, or in the presence of a nitroxyl ether   , wherein<br>
X represents a group having at least one carbon atom and is such that the free radical derived from X is capable of initiating polymerization and the remaining radical<br>
forms a stable free nitroxyl radical;<br>
by adding a reducing agent to said polymer and heating said mixture to above the glass<br>
temperature In case of amorphous polymers or above the melting point in case of crystalline<br>
or semi-crystalline polymers;<br>
with the proviso that essentially no polymerizable monomer is present.<br>
The process is preferably carried out, wherein the mixture is heated to 50°-150° C above the glass temperature in case of amorphous polymers or 20°-180° C above the melting point in case of crystalline or semi-crystalline polymers.<br><br>
The heating step of the process may be performed in any reactor suitable for mixing a polymer melt. Preferably the reactor is an extruder or kneading apparatus as for example described in "Handbuch der Kunststoffextrusion" Vol.1, editor F. Hensen, W. Knappe and H. Potente, 1989, pages 3-7. If an extruder is used the process may be described as reactive extrusion process. Examples of reactiv extrusion equipment and processes are given by G. H. Hu et a!., in "Reactive Modifiers for Polymers", first edition, Blackie Academic &amp; Professional an Imprint of Chapman &amp; Hall, London 1997, chapter 1, pages 1-97.<br>
Preferably, If an extruder is used, a reduced pressure of less than 200 mbar is applied during extrusion. Volatile by products may be removed thereby.<br>
Typical reaction times are from a few seconds to several hours. Preferably the reaction time<br>
is from 10 seconds to 1 h, most preferably from 20 seconds to 20 min.<br>
Another subject is the use of a reducing agent for improving the color of an oligomer,<br>
cooligomer, polymer or copolymer or blends thereof, containing a stable free nitroxyl radical<br>

Still another subject of the invention is the use of a reducing agent for removing the discoloration of polymers, obtained by radical polymerization, which polymerization has been<br>
carried out in the presence of a stable free nitroxyl radical and a source of free<br>
radicals capable of initiating the polymerization, or in the presence of a nitroxyl ether   , wherein<br>
X represents a group having at least one carbon atom and is such that the free radical derived from X is capable of initiating polymerization and the remaining radical<br>
forms a stable free nitroxyl radical.<br><br>
