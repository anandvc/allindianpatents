of all of the above which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a dosage form providing immediate release of an<br>
active ingredient. The dosage form comprises a solid core and a shell surrounding the<br>
core. The shell has one or more openings therein.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Certain dosage forms containing apertures or embossments are known. For<br>
instance, "osmotic pump" dosage forms for the administration of pharmaceutically<br>
active ingredients are known in the art. They typically comprise a semipermeable<br>
wall that surrounds a reservoir containing drug. The wall is permeable to the passage<br>
of an external fluid, impermeable to the passage of drug, and has a passageway<br>
through the semipermeable wall for delivering drug from the osmotic system. For<br>
example, U.S. Patent No. 4,576,604 discloses an osmotic device comprising a drug<br>
compartment surrounded by a wall (coating) having a passageway therein. The wall<br>
may comprise an immediate release dose of drug, and the inner drug compartment<br>
may comprise a sustained release dose of drug.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,449,983 discloses another osmotic device comprising two,<br>
separately housed drugs that are separately dispensed from the device. The device<br>
comprises two compartments, one for each drug, separated by a partition. Each<br>
compartment has an orifice for communicating with the exterior of the device.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,823,816 discloses a water-soluble package provided in the<br>
form of a hard shell capsule filled with powder, granules, or the like. The capsule is<br>
apertured, and the apertures are covered by a water-soluble barrier film. The film is<br>
more water soluble than the capsule so that when the package contacts water, the film<br>
rather than the capsule dissolves first, exposing the contents for dissolution and/or<br>
release by way of the apertures while the capsule is intact.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,256,440 relates to an intagliated dosage form comprising<br>
one or more circumscribed regions on its surface. The dosage form is spray coated<br>
with a latex polymer. When placed in an environment of use, the latex coating within<br>
the circumscribed region is reproducibly expelled, leaving a coated core tablet with a<br>
predefined aperture, which exposes a discrete portion of the core surface to the<br>
environment of use.<br>
One known method of producing gelatin coated dosage forms is via an<br>
enrobing process wherein two separate films made of gelatinous material are applied<br>
to opposite sides of a tablet by a pair of rotary dies, as disclosed for example, in U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 5,146,730 and 5,459,983. Film formulations for producing gelcaps and<br>
geltabs prepared via enrobing methods such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,146,730 and 5,459,983 typically comprises a water-based gelatin preparation having<br>
about 45% gelatin and about 9% plasticizer (glycerin and/or sorbitol) by weight.<br>
Glycerin and sorbitol can be used as single plasticizers or in combination with each<br>
other.. In addition, other sugars and poly-hydroxy compounds can be used as<br>
additives and plasticizers. If a tamper-evident gelatin-coated medicine tablet is the<br>
desired end product, then the ratio of plasticizer to gelatin in the gelatin formulation<br>
should be in the range of about 1:5.<br>
Another conventional method for forming a shell (or coating), on a core (or<br>
substrate), is mat disclosed in WO 01/57144 which utilizes the principles of<br>
electrostatic deposition to form the coating. At least one of the core or the shell<br>
preferably incorporates one or more "charge control agents," such as metal saJicylates,<br>
selected from propionic acid derivative NSAID, e.g. ibuprofen, naproxen,<br>
flurbiprofen, fenbufen, fenoprofen, indoprofen, ketoprofen, fhuprofen, pirprofen,<br>
carprofen, oxaprozin, pranoprofen, suprofen, and phannaceutically acceptable salts,<br>
derivatives, and combinations thereof. In another particular embodiment of the<br>
invention, the active ingredient may be selected from acetaminophen, acetyl salicylic<br>
acid, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, flurbiprofen, diclofenac, cyclobenzaprine,<br>
meloxicam, rofecoxib, celecoxib, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters,<br>
isomers, and mixtures thereof.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the active ingredient may be selected<br>
from pseudoephedrine, phenylpropanolamine, chlorpheniramme, dextromethorphan,<br>
diphenhydramine, astemizole, terfenadine, fexofenadine, loratadine, desloratadine,<br>
cetirizine, mixtures thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, isomers, and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
Examples of suitable polydimethylsiloxanes, which include, but are not<br>
limited to dimethicone and simethicone, are those disclosed in United States Patent<br>
Nos. 4,906,478, 5,275,822, and 6,103,260, the contents of each is expressly<br>
incorporated herein by reference. As used herein, the term "simethicone" refers to the<br>
broader class of polydimethylsiloxanes, including but not limited to simethicone and<br>
dimethicone.<br>
The active ingredient or ingredients are present in the dosage form in a<br>
therapeutically effective amount, which is an amount that produces the desired<br>
therapeutic response upon oral administration and can be readily determined by one<br>
skilled in the art. In determining such amounts, the particular active ingredient being<br>
administered, the bioavailability characteristics of the active ingredient, the dosing<br>
regimen, the age and weight of the patient, and other factors must be considered, as<br>
known in the art. Typically, the dosage form comprises at least about 1 weight<br>
percent, preferably, the dosage form comprises at least about 5 weight percent, e.g. at<br>
least about 25 weight percent of a combination of one or more active ingredients. In<br>
one preferred embodiment, a core comprises a total of at least about 50 weight<br>
for example zinc salicylate, magnesium salicylate and calcium salicylate; quaternary<br>
ammonium salts; benzalkonium chloride; benzethonium chloride; trimethyl tetradecyl<br>
ammonium bromide (cetrimide); and cyclodextrins and their adducts, in an amount<br>
from about 1% to about 10% by weight of the shell.<br>
Applicants have now discovered that an immediate release dosage form may<br>
be made from a solid core and a shell surrounding the core, wherein the core has a<br>
density of at least about 0.9 g/cc. The shell comprises one or more openings therein<br>
and is readily soluble in gastrointestinal fluids. The shell is preferably applied to the<br>
core by enrobing.<br>

As used herein, the term "dosage form" applies to any solid object, semi-solid,<br>
or liquid composition designed to contain a specific predetermined amount (dose) of<br>
a certain ingredient, for example an active ingredient as defined below. Suitable<br>
dosage forms may be pharmaceutical drug delivery systems, including those for oral<br>
administration, buccal administration, rectal administration, topical or mucosal<br>
delivery, or subcutaneous implants, or other implanted drug delivery systems; or<br>
compositions for delivering minerals, vitamins and other nutraceuticals, oral care<br>
agents, flavorants, and the like. Preferably the dosage forms of the present invention<br>
are considered to be solid, however they may contain liquid or semi-solid<br>
components. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the dosage form is an orally<br>
administered system for delivering a pharmaceutical active ingredient to the gastro-<br>
intestinal tract of a human.<br>
Suitable active ingredients for use in this invention include for example<br>
Pharmaceuticals, minerals, vitamins and other nutraceuticals, oral care agents,<br>
flavorants and mixtures thereof. Suitable Pharmaceuticals include analgesics, anti-<br>
inflammatory agents, antiarthritics, anesthetics, antihistamines, antitussives,<br>
antibiotics, anti-infective agents, antivirals, anticoagulants, antidepressants,<br>
antidiabetic agents, antiemetics, antiflatulents, antifungals, antispasmodics, appetite<br>
suppressants, bronchodilators, cardiovascular agents, central nervous system agents,<br>
central nervous system stimulants, decongestants, oral contraceptives, diuretics,<br>
expectorants, gastrointestinal agents, migraine preparations, motion sickness products,<br>
mucolytics, muscle relaxants, osteoporosis preparations, polydimethylsiloxanes,<br>
respiratory agents, sleep-aids, urinary tract agents and mixtures thereof.<br>
the coated solid dosage form as measured by conventional pharmaceutical hardness<br>
testing equipment, such as a Schleuniger Hardness Tester. In order to compare values<br>
across different size tablets, the breaking strength must be normalized for the area of<br>
the break. This normalized value, expressed in kp/cm2, is sometimes referred in the<br>
art as tablet tensile strength. A general discussion of tablet hardness testing is found<br>
in Leiberman et al., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms - Tablets, Volume 2,2nd ed.,<br>
Marcel Dekker Inc., 1990, pp. 213 - 217, 327 - 329.<br>
The core may have one of a variety of different shapes. For example, the core<br>
may be shaped as a polyhedron, such as a cube, pyramid, prism, or the like; or may<br>
have the geometry of a space figure with some non-flat faces, such as a cone,<br>
truncated cone, cylinder, sphere, torus, or the like. In certain embodiments, a core has<br>
one or more major faces. For example, in embodiments wherein a core is a<br>
compressed tablet, the core surface typically has two opposing major faces formed by<br>
contact with the upper and lower punch faces in the compression machine. In such<br>
embodiments the core surface typically further comprises a "belly-band" located<br>
between the two major faces, and formed by contact with the die walls in the<br>
compression machine. A core may also comprise a multilayer tablet.<br>
Exemplary core shapes that may be employed include tablet shapes formed<br>
from compression tooling shapes described by "The Elizabeth Companies Tablet<br>
Design Training Manual" (Elizabeth Carbide Die Co., Inc., p. 7 (McKeesport, Pa.)<br>
(incorporated herein by reference) as follows (the tablet shape corresponds inversely<br>
to the shape of the compression tooling):<br>
1. Shallow Concave.<br>
2. Standard Concave.<br>
3. Deep Concave.<br>
4. Extra Deep Concave.<br>
5. Modified Ball Concave.<br>
6. Standard Concave Bisect.<br>
7. Standard Concave Double Bisect.<br>
8. Standard Concave European Bisect.<br>
9. Standard Concave Partial Bisect.<br>
10. Double Radius.<br>
11. Bevel &amp; Concave.<br>
12. Flat Plain.<br>
percent, e.g. at least about 70 weight percent, say at least about 80 weight percent<br>
(based on the weight of the core) of one or more active ingredients.<br>
The active ingredient or ingredients may be present in the dosage form in any<br>
form. For example, the active ingredient may be dispersed at the molecular level, e.g.<br>
melted or dissolved, within the dosage form, or may be in the form of particles, which<br>
in turn may be coated or uncoated. If the active ingredient is in form of particles, the<br>
particles (whether coated or uncoated) typically have an average particle size of about<br>
1-2000 microns. In one preferred embodiment, such particles are crystals having an<br>
average particle size of about 1-300 microns. In another preferred embodiment, the<br>
particles are granules or pellets having an average particle size of about 50-2000<br>
microns, preferably about 50-1000 microns, most preferably about 100-800 microns.<br>
The core may be any solid form. The core may prepared by any suitable <br>
method, including for example compression or molding. As used herein, "core" refers<br>
to a material which is at least partially enveloped or surrounded by another material.<br>
Preferably, the core is a self-contained unitary object, such as a tablet or capsule.<br>
Typically, the core comprises a solid, for example, the core may be a compressed or<br>
molded tablet, hard or soft capsule, suppository, or a confectionery form such as a<br>
lozenge, nougat, caramel, fondant, or fat based composition. In certain other<br>
embodiments, the core or a portion thereof may be in the form of a semi-solid or a<br>
liquid in the finished dosage form. For example the core may comprise a liquid filled<br>
capsule, or a semisolid fondant material. In embodiments in which the core<br>
comprises a flowable component, such as a plurality of granules or particles, or a<br>
liquid, the core preferrably additionally comprises an enveloping component, such as<br>
a capsule shell, or a coating, for containing the flowable material. In certain particular<br>
embodiments in which the core comprises an enveloping component, the shell or shell<br>
portions of the present invention are in direct contact with the enveloping component<br>
of the core, which separates the shell from the flowable component of the core.<br>
In one embodiment the core is a compressed tablet having a hardness from<br>
about 2 to about 30 kp/cm2, e.g. from about 6 to about 25 kp/cm2. "Hardness" is a<br>
term used in the art to describe the diametral breaking strength of either the core or<br>

depending on the method by which it is made.<br>
In embodiments in which the core is made by compression, suitable excipients<br>
include fillers, binders, disintegrants, lubricants, glidants, and the like, as known in<br>
the art. In embodiments in which the core is made by compression and additionally<br>
confers modified release of an active ingredient contained therein, such core<br>
preferably further comprises a release-modifying compressible excipient.<br>
Suitable fillers for use in making the core by compression include water-<br>
soluble compressible carbohydrates such as sugars, which include dextrose, sucrose,<br>
maltose, and lactose, sugar-alcohols, which include mannitol, sorbitol, maltitol,<br>
xylitol, starch hydrolysates, which include dextrins, and maltodextrins, and the like,<br>

laminarin, scleroglucan, inulin, whelan, rhamsan, zooglan, methylan, chitin,<br>
cyclodextrin, chitosan, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, cellulosics, sucrose, starches, and the<br>
like; and derivatives and mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable disintegrants for making the core by compression, include sodium<br>
starch glycolate, cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone, cross-linked<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, starches, microcrystalline cellulose, and the like.<br>
Suitable lubricants for making the core by compression include long chain<br>
fatty acids and their salts, such as magnesium stearate and stearic acid, talc, glycerides<br>
and waxes.<br>
Suitable glidants for making the core by compression, include colloidal silicon<br>
dioxide, and the like.<br>
In certain embodiments, the core or a portion thereof may optionally comprise<br>
release modifying excipients as known in the art, for example as disclosed in<br>
commonly assigned, copending U.S. Application Serial No._________[MCP 321],<br>
the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. Suitable release-<br>
modifying compressible excipients for making the core by compression include<br>
swellable erodible hydrophillic materials, insoluble edible materials, pH-dependent<br>
polymers, and the like.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants for making the cores by<br>
compression include, preservatives; high intensity sweeteners such as aspartame,<br>
acesulfame potassium, sucralose, and saccharin; flavorants; colorants; antioxidants;<br>
surfactants; wetting agents; and the like and mixtures thereof.<br>
In embodiments wherein one or more cores are prepared by compression, a<br>
dry blending (i.e. direct compression), or wet granulation process may be employed,<br>
as known in the art. In a dry blending (direct compression) method, the active<br>
ingredient or ingredients, together with the excipients, are blended in a suitable<br>
blender, than transferred directly to a compression machine for pressing into tablets.<br>
In a wet granulation method, the active ingredient or ingredients, appropriate<br>
excipients, and a solution or dispersion of a wet binder (e.g. an aqueous cooked starch<br>
paste, or solution of polyvinyl pyrrolidone) are mixed and granulated. Alternatively a<br>
dry binder may be included among the excipients, and the mixture may be granulated<br>
with water or other suitable solvent. Suitable apparatuses for wet granulation are<br>
known in the art, including low shear, e.g. planetary mixers; high shear mixers; and<br>
fluid beds, including rotary fluid beds. The resulting granulated material is dried, and<br>
optionally dry-blended with further ingredients, e.g. adjuvants and/or excipients such<br>
as for example lubricants, colorants, and the like. The final dry blend is then suitable<br>
for compression. Methods for direct compression and wet granulation processes are<br>
known in the art, and are described in detail in, for example, Lachman, et al., The<br>
Theory and Practice of Industrial Pharmacy. Chapter 11 (3rd ed. 1986).<br>
The dry-blended, or wet granulated, powder mixture is typically compacted<br>
into tablets using a rotary compression machine as known in the art, such as for<br>
example those commercially available from Fette America Inc., Rockaway, NJ, or<br>
Manesty Machines LTD, Liverpool, UK. In a rotary compression machine, a metered<br>
volume of powder is filled into a die cavity, which rotates as part of a "die table" from<br>
the filling position to a compaction position where the powder is compacted between<br>
an upper and a lower punch to an ejection position where the resulting tablet is pushed<br>
from the die cavity by the lower punch and guided to an ejection chute by a stationary<br>
"take-off bar.<br>
In one optional embodiment, the core may be prepared by the compression<br>
methods and apparatus described in copending U.S. Patent Application Serial No.<br>
09/966,509, pages 16-27, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Specifically, the core is made using a rotary compression module comprising a fill<br>
zone, insertion zone, compression zone, ejection zone, and purge zone in a single<br>
apparatus having a double row die construction as shown in Figure 6 of U.S. patent<br>
application Serial No. 09/966,509. The dies of the compression module are<br>
preferably rilled using the assistance of a vacuum, with filters located in or near each<br>
die.<br>
Cores made by compression may be single or multi-layer, for example bi-<br>
layer, tablets.<br>
The cores have a density of at least about 0.9 g/cc, e.g. at least about 1.0 g/cc.<br>
Exemplary cores include a 385 mg compressed soft tablet with a volume of 0.4 cubic<br>
centimeters, and a 586mg compressed tablet with a volume of about 0.5 cc.<br>
A shell surrounds the cores. The shell comprises one or more openings<br>
therein. The opening or openings provide a passageway for communication between<br>
the core and the exterior of the dosage form. The openings may extend completely<br>
through the thickness of the shell to contact the core, or only partially through the<br>
shell.<br>
The shell may be substantially unitary and continuous with the exception of<br>
the openings therein, or the shell may comprise multiple portions, e.g. a first shell<br>
portion and a second shell portion. In certain embodiments the shell or shell portions<br>
are in direct contact with the core. In certain other embodiments, the shell or shell<br>
portions are in direct contact with a subcoating which substantially surrounds the<br>
core. In embodiments in which the shell comprises a first and second shell portion, at<br>
least a first shell portion comprises openings therein.<br>
In certain embodiments the first shell portion and second shell portion are<br>
compositionally different. As used herein, the term "compositionally different"<br>
means having features that are readily distinguishable by qualitative or quantitative<br>
chemical analysis, physical testing, or visual observation. For example, the first and<br>
second shell portions may contain different ingredients, or different levels of the same<br>
ingredients, or the first and second shell portions may have different physical or<br>
chemical properties, different functional properties, or be visually distinct. Examples<br>
of physical or chemical properties that may be different include hydrophylicity,<br>
hydrophobicity, hygroscopicity, elasticity, plasticity, tensile strength, crystallinity,<br>
and density. Examples of functional properties which may be different include rate<br>
and/or extent of dissolution of the material itself or of an active ingredient therefrom,<br>
rate of disintegration of the material, permeability to active ingredients, permeability<br>
to water or aqueous media, and the like. Examples of visual distinctions include size,<br>
shape, topography, or other geometric features, color, hue, opacity, and gloss.<br>
In one embodiment, the dosage form of the invention comprises: a) a core<br>
containing an active ingredient; b) an optional subcoating that substantially covers the<br>
core; and c) a shell comprising first and second shell portions residing on the surface<br>
of the subcoating, the first shell portion comprising one.or more openings, and the<br>
first shell portion being readily soluble in gastrointestinal fluids. As used herein,<br>
"substantially covers" shall mean at least about 95 percent of the surface area of the<br>
core is covered by the subcoating.<br>
The use of subcoatings is well known in the art and disclosed in, for example,<br>
United States Patent Nos. 3,185,626, which is incorporated by reference herein. Any<br>
composition suitable for film-coating a tablet may be used as a subcoating according<br>
to the present invention. Examples of suitable subcoatings are disclosed in United<br>
States Patent Nos. 4,683,256,4,543,370,4,643,894,4,828,841,4,725,441,4,802,924,<br>
5,630,871, and 6,274,162, which are all incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Additional suitable subcoatings include one or more of the following ingredients:<br>
cellulose ethers such as hydroxypropylmethyicellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, and<br>
hydroxyethylcellulose; polycarbohydrates such as xanthan gum, starch, and<br>
maltodextrin; plasticizers including for example, glycerin, polyethylene glycol,<br>
propylene glycol, dibutyl sebecate, triethyl citrate, vegetable oils such as castor oil,<br>
surfactants such as polysorbate-80, sodium lauryl sulfate and dioctyl-sodium<br>
sulfosuccinate; polycarbohydrates, pigments, and opacifiers.<br>
In one embodiment, the subcoating comprises from about 2 percent to about 8<br>
percent, e.g. from about 4 percent to about 6 percent of a water-soluble cellulose ether<br>
and from about 0.1 percent to about 1 percent, castor oil, as disclosed in detail in<br>
United States Patent No. 5,658,589, which is incorporated by reference herein. In<br>
another embodiment, the subcoating comprises from about 20 percent to about 50<br>
percent, e.g., from about 25 percent to about 40 percent of HPMC; from about 45<br>
percent to about 75 percent, e.g., from about 50 percent to about 70 percent of<br>
maltodextrin; and from about 1 percent to about 10 percent, e.g., from about 5 percent<br>
to about 10 percent of PEG 400.<br>
The dried subcoating typically is present in an amount, based upon the dry<br>
weight of the core, from about 0 percent to about 5 percent.<br>
Figure 1 depicts a dosage form 1 according to the invention comprising a shell<br>
3 having a plurality of openings 2. Openings 2 are shaped as elongated slits, and do<br>
not extend all the way through the shell 3 to the core (not shown) under the shell 3.<br>
Figure 2 depicts another dosage form according to the invention. The dosage<br>
form 1 comprises a core (not shown) covered a shell made of a first shell portion 3 a<br>
and a second shell portion 3b. Shell portion 3a contains a plurality of openings 2a,<br>
2b. Openings 2a are in the shape of dimples, while openings 2b are in the shape of<br>
letters.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates another dosage form according to the invention. Dosage<br>
form 1 comprises a core (not shown) covered by a shell 3, which comprises openings<br>
2a, 2b. Openings 2a are in the shape of circular holes, while openings 2b are in the<br>
shape of letters.<br>
Figure 4 shows another dosage form according to the invention. Dosage form<br>
1 comprises a core 4 surrounded by a shell 3 having openings 2. Core 4 is partially<br>
visible at the base of each opening 2 in shell 3.<br>
Figure 5 depicts a further dosage form according to the invention. Dosage<br>
form 1 comprises a football-shaped core (not shown) covered by a shell comprising a<br>
first shell portion 3a and a second shell portion 3b. First shell portion 3a comprises a<br>
plurality of small, round openings 2.<br>
Each opening may have dimensions, e.g., length, width, or diameter, in the<br>
range of about 0.1% to about 100%, of the diameter of the dosage form, or of any<br>
dimension (e.g. diameter, length, or width) of a major face of the dosage form. The<br>
diameter or width of each opening is preferably from about 0.5% to about 5% of the<br>
diameter of the dosage form, or of any dimension (e.g. diameter, length, or width) of a<br>
major face of the dosage form. In certain embodiments the diameter or width of the<br>
openings may range from about 200 to about 2000 microns. The length of the<br>
openings may range from about 1% to about 100% of the diameter of the dosage<br>
form, or of the diameter of a major face of the dosage form. In certain particular<br>
embodiments, the length or diameter of a major face of the dosage form is from about<br>
10,000 to about 20,000 microns. In one particular embodiment, the length of the<br>
openings is from about 100 to about 20,000 microns. The depth of the openings is<br>
typically from about 75% to about 100% of the thickness of the shell at the location of<br>
the openings. In certain embodiments, the thickness of the shell at the location of the<br>
openings typically ranges from about 20 to about 800 microns, e.g. from about 100 to<br>
about 400 microns. In one particular embodiment, the depth of the openings is from<br>
about 75 to about 400 microns. If a plurality of openings are present, they are<br>
typically spaced from one another by at least about one half, e.g. at least about one,<br>
times the smallest dimension of the smallest opening. The openings may have a<br>
variety of shapes, or be arranged in a variety of different patterns, and may have<br>
similar or different sizes, such as depicted in Figure 6.<br>
In one embodiment, the size of the openings is small enough to prevent the<br>
core from being tasted, yet the number of openings is large enough to provide<br>
communication between a certain percentage of surface area of the core and the<br>
exterior of the dosage form.<br>
The shell thickness at various locations maybe measured using a microscope,<br>
for example, an environmental scanning electron microscope, model XL 30 ESEM<br>
LaB6, Philips Electronic Instruments Company, Mahwah, WI. The shell thickness is<br>
measured at 6 different locations on a single dosage form. The relative standard<br>
deviation (RSD) is calculated as the sample standard deviation, devided by the mean,<br>
times 100 as known in the art (i.e. the RSD is the standard deviation expressed as a<br>
percentage of the mean). The RSD in shell thickness provides an indication of the<br>
variation in the thickness of the shell on a single dosage form. In certain optional<br>
embodiments of the invention, the relative standard deviation in shell thickness is less<br>
than about 40%, e.g less than about 30%, or less than about 20%.<br>
The dosage forms of the invention provide immediate release of one or more<br>
active ingredients contained therein. The active ingredient or ingredients may be<br>
found within the core, the shell, or portions or combinations thereof. In one<br>
embodiment, at least one active ingredient is contained in the core.<br>
In embodiments in which it is desired for the active ingredient to be absorbed<br>
into the systemic circulation of an animal, the active ingredient or ingredients are<br>
preferably capable of dissolution upon contact with a fluid such as water, gastric fluid,<br>
intestinal fluid or the like. In one embodiment, the dissolution characteristics of at<br>
least one active ingredient meets USP specifications for immediate release tablets<br>
containing the active ingredient. For example, for acetaminophen tablets, USP 24<br>
specifies that in pH 5.8 phosphate buffer, using USP apparatus 2 (paddles) at 50 rpm,<br>
at least 80% of the acetaminophen contained in the dosage form is released therefrom<br>
within 30 minutes after dosing, and for ibuprofen tablets, USP 24 specifies that in pH<br>
7.2 phosphate buffer, using USP apparatus 2 (paddles) at 50 rpm, at least 80% of the<br>
ibuprofen contained in the dosage form is released therefrom within 60 minutes after<br>
dosing. See USP 24, 2000 Version, 19 - 20 and 856 (1999). In another embodiment,<br>
at least about 70% the active ingredient can be detected in a suitable dissolution<br>
medium after 60 minutes of stirring at suitable conditions.<br>
Accordingly, the shell, or a portion thereof, is readily soluble in<br>
gastrointestinal fluids. In a preferred embodiment in which the shell comprises a first<br>
and second shell portion, at least the first shell portion comprises openings therein,<br>
and is readily soluble in gastrointestinal fluids. In such embodiments, such shell or<br>
shell portion will preferably be breached or dissolved within 30 minutes in 900 ml<br>
water or 0.1 N HC1, or phosphate buffer solution at 37°C with stirring by a USP type<br>
2 dissolution apparatus (Paddle method) at 50 or 100 rpm.<br>
The shell or shell portion preferably comprises materials which exhibit rapid<br>
dissolution in gastro-intestinal fluids. For example, such shell or shell portion may<br>
comprise readily soluble materials selected from water soluble or water swellable film<br>
formers, water soluble or water swellable thickeners, crystallizable and non-<br>
crystallizable carbohydrates. In certain such embodiments, suitable water soluble or<br>
water swellable film formers may be selected from water swellable cellulose<br>
derivatives, thermoplastic starches, polyalkalene glycols, polyalkalene oxides, and<br>
amorphous sugar glass, and combinations thereof. In certain other such embodiments,<br>
suitable film formers may be selected from film forming water soluble polymers such<br>
as for example water soluble vinyl polymers, water soluble polycarbohydrates, and<br>
water soluble oopolymers; film-forming proteins, and combinations thereof. In<br>
certain other such embodiments, suitable thickeners may be selected from gelling<br>
polymers or hydrocolloids; gelling starches, and crystallizable carbohydrates. In<br>
certain other such embodiments, suitable non-crystallizable carbohydrates may be<br>
selected from polydextrose, starch hydrolysates, and non-crystallizable sugar<br>
alcohols. In one embodiment, the shell preferably comprises at least about 50%,<br>
preferably at least about 80%, most preferably at least about 90% of a material<br>
selected from film formers, gelling polymers, low-melting hydrophobic materials,<br>
non-crystallizable sugars or sugar alcohols, and mixtures thereof. In another<br>
embodiment, the shell comprises at least about 50%, preferably at least about 80%,<br>
most preferably at least about 90% of a material selected from film formers, gelling<br>
polymers, low-melting hydrophobic materials, and mixtures thereof.<br>
In another particular embodiment, the shell comprises less than about 50%,<br>
preferably less than about 25%, most preferably less than about 5% of a crystallizable<br>
sugar.<br>
In another embodiment, the dosage form is substantially free (i.e. less than 1%<br>
by weight, preferably less man about 0.1 % by weight, based upon the shell weight) of<br>
charge control agents. As used herein, the term "charge control agents" refers to a<br>
material having a charge control function, such as those used for electrostatic<br>
deposition of coatings onto substrates. Such charge control agents include metal<br>
salicylates, for example zinc salicylate, magnesium salicylate and calcium salicylate;<br>
quaternary ammonium salts; benzalkonium chloride; benzethonium chloride;<br>
trimethyl tetradecyl ammonium bromide (cetrimide); and cyclodextrins and their<br>
adducts.<br>
In certain optional embodiments, the shell itself or an outer coating thereon<br>
may contain active ingredient. In one particular embodiment, such active ingredient<br>
will be released immediately from the dosage form upon contact with suitable liquid<br>
media. In another embodiment, the shell comprises a first shell portion and a second<br>
shell portion. An outer coating resides upon the second shell portion, while the first<br>
shell portion comprises openings therein. Active ingredient may be released either<br>
immediately, or in a controlled, e.g. sustained, prolonged, extended manner, or in a<br>
delayed, e.g. pulsatile, or repeat action manner from the dosage form upon contact<br>
with suitable liquid media. In embodiments wherein the active ingredient is released<br>
immediately from the outer coating, the outer coating is also preferably readily<br>
soluble in gastrointestinal fluids, as described above.<br>
The shell may be applied to the core by any suitable method, for example by<br>
spraying, dipping, enrobing, or molding. Suitable spray-coating methods are<br>
described in, for example, United States Patent Nos. 3,185,626,4,683,256,<br>
4,543,370,4,643,894,4,828,841, 4,725,441,4,802,924, 5,630,871, and 6,274,162, the<br>
disclosures of which are all incorporated by reference herein. Suitable dipping<br>
methods are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,820,524, 5,538,125; 5,228,916;<br>
5,436,026; 5,679,406, the disclosures of which are all incorporated by reference<br>
herein. Suitable enrobing methods are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,146,730 and<br>
5,459,983. Suitable molding methods are described herein.<br>
In certain optional embodiments of the invention, the core, the shell, or both<br>
are prepared by molding. In particular, the core, the shell, or both may be made by<br>
solvent-based molding or solvent-free molding, In such embodiments, the core or the<br>
shell is made from a flowable material optionally comprising active ingredient. The<br>
flowable material may be any edible material that is flowable at a temperature<br>
between about 37°C and 250°C, and that is solid, semi-solid, or can form a gel at a<br>
temperature between about -10°C and about 35°C. When it is in the fluid or flowable<br>
state, the flowable material may comprise a dissolved, dispersed, or molten<br>
component, and optionally a solvent such as for example water or organic solvents, or<br>
combinations thereof. The solvent may be partially or substantially removed by<br>
drying.<br>
In one embodiment, solvent-based or solvent-free molding is performed via<br>
thermal setting molding using the method and apparatus described in copending U.S.<br>
patent application Serial No. 09/966,450, pages 57-63, the disclosure of which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference, In this embodiment, a core or shell is formed by<br>
injecting flowable form into a molding chamber. The flowable material preferably<br>
comprises a thermal setting material at a temperature above its melting point but<br>
below the decomposition temperature of any active ingredient contained therein. The<br>
starting material is cooled and solidifies in the molding chamber into a shaped form<br>
(i.e., having the shape of the mold).<br>
According to this method, the flowable material may comprise solid particles<br>
suspended in a molten matrix, for example a polymer matrix. The flowable material<br>
may be completely molten or in the form of a paste. The flowable material may<br>
comprise an active ingredient dissolved in a molten material. The flowable material<br>
may comprise solid particles dispersed in a fluid carrier. Alternatively, the flowable<br>
material may be made by dissolving a solid in a solvent, which solvent is then<br>
evaporated after the molding step.<br>
In another embodiment, solvent-based or solvent-free molding is performed by<br>
thermal cycle molding using the method and apparatus described in copending U.S.<br>
patent application Serial No. 09/966,497, pages 27-51, the disclosure of which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference. Thermal cycle molding is performed by injecting a<br>
flowable material into a heated molding chamber. The flowable material may<br>
comprise active ingredient and a thermoplastic material at a temperature above the set<br>
temperature of the thermoplastic material but below the decomposition temperature of<br>
active ingredient. The flowable material is cooled and solidifies in the molding<br>
chamber into a shaped form (i.e., having the shape of the mold).<br>
In the thermal cycle molding method and apparatus of U.S. patent application<br>
Serial No. 09/966,497 a thermal cycle molding module having the general<br>
configuration shown in Figure 3 therein is employed. The thermal cycle molding<br>
module 200 comprises a rotor 202 around which a plurality of mold units 204 are<br>
disposed. The thermal cycle molding module includes a reservoir 206 (see Figure 4)<br>
for holding flowable material. In addition, the thermal cycle molding module is<br>
provided with a temperature control system for rapidly heating and cooling the mold<br>
units. Figures 55 and 56 depict the temperature control system 600.<br>
The mold units may comprise center mold assemblies 212, upper mold<br>
assemblies 214, and lower mold assemblies 210, as shown in. Figures 26-28, which<br>
mate to form mold cavities having a desired shape, for instance of a core or a shell<br>
surrounding one or more cores. As rotor 202 rotates, opposing center and upper mold<br>
assemblies or opposing center and lower mold assemblies close. Flowable material,<br>
which is heated to a flowable state in reservoir 206, is injected into the resulting mold<br>
cavities. The temperature of the flowable material is then decreased, hardening the<br>
flowable material. The mold assemblies open and eject the finished product.<br>
In one optional embodiment of the invention, the shell is applied to the dosage<br>
form using a thermal cycle molding apparatus of the general type shown in Figures<br>
28A-C of copending U.S. Application Serial No. 09/966,497 comprising rotatable<br>
center mold assemblies 212, lower mold assemblies 210 and upper mold assemblies<br>
214. Cores are continuously fed to the mold assemblies. Shell flowable material,<br>
which is heated to a flowable state in reservoir 206, is injected into the mold cavities<br>
created by the closed mold assemblies holding the cores. The temperature of the shell<br>
flowable material is then decreased, hardening it around the cores. The mold<br>
assemblies open and eject the finished dosage forms. Shell coating is performed in<br>
two steps, each half of the dosage forms being coated separately as shown in the flow<br>
diagram of Figure 28B of copending U.S. Application Serial No. 09/966,939 via<br>
rotation of the center mold assembly.<br>
In one embodiment, the compression module of copending U.S. patent<br>
application Serial No. 09/966,509, pp. 16-27 may be employed to make the core and<br>
the shell is applied to the core using a thermal cycle molding module as described<br>
above. A transfer device as described in U.S. patent application Serial No.<br>
09/966,414, pp. 51-57, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference,<br>
may be used to transfer the cores from the compression module to the thermal cycle<br>
molding module. Such a transfer device may have the structure shown as 300 in<br>
Figure 3 of copending U.S. Application Serial No. 09/966,939. It comprises a<br>
plurality of transfer units 304 attached in cantilever fashion to a belt 312 as shown in<br>
Figures 68 and 69 of copending U.S. Application Serial No. 09/966,939. The transfer<br>
device rotates and operates in sync with the compression module and the thermal<br>
cycle molding module to which it is coupled. Transfer units 304 comprise retainers<br>
330 for holding cores as they travel around the transfer device.<br>
Suitable thermoplastic materials for use in or as the flowable material include<br>
both water soluble and water insoluble polymers that are generally linear, not<br>
crosslinked, and not strongly hydrogen bonded to adjacent polymer chains. The<br>
thermoplastic material may be single materials, or may be mixtures of materials with<br>
solvent or plasticizer. Examples of suitable thermoplastic materials include those<br>
comprising water swellable cellulose derivatives, water insoluble cellulose<br>
derivatrives, thermoplastic vinyl polymers, thermoplastic starches, thermoplastic<br>
polyalkalene glycols, thermoplastic polyalkalene oxides, and amorphous sugar-glass,<br>
and the like, and derivatives, copolymers, and combinations thereof. Examples of<br>
suitable thermoplastic water swellable cellulose derivatives include hydroxypropyl<br>
cellulose (HPC), hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC), methyl cellulose (MC),<br>
and their combinations with water or other suitable solvents and/or plasticizers.<br>
Examples of suitable thermoplastic water insoluble cellulose derivatives include<br>
cellulose acetate (CA), ethyl cellulose (EC), cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB),<br>
cellulose propionate, and their combinations with suitable organic solvents and/or<br>
plasticizers. Examples of suitable thermoplastic vinyl polymers include polyvinyl<br>
alcohol (PVA) and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP). Examples of suitable thermoplastic<br>
starches are disclosed for example in U.S. Patent No. 5,427,614. Examples of<br>
suitable thermoplastic polyalkalene glycols include polyethylene glycol. Examples of<br>
suitable thermoplastic polyalkalene oxides include polyethylene oxide having a<br>
molecular weight from about 100,000 to about 900,000 Daltons. Other suitable<br>
thermoplastic materials include sugar in the form on an amorphous glass such as that<br>
used to make hard candy forms.<br>
It should be noted that, when used to make the shell, the flowable material<br>
must be a material readily soluble in gastrointestinal fluids, as described above.<br>
In those embodiments in which the shell is prepared using a solvent-free<br>
molding process, the shell typically comprises at least about 30 percent, e.g. at least<br>
about 45 percent by weight of a thermal-reversible carrier. .The shell may optionally<br>
further comprise up to about 30 weight percent total of various plasticizers, adjuvants<br>
and excipients.<br>
In those embodiments in which the shell is prepared using a solvent-based<br>
molding process, the shell typically comprises at least about 10 weight percent, e.g. at<br>
least about 12 weight percent or at least about 15 weight percent or at least about 20<br>
(PVP). Examples of suitable thermoplastic starches for use as thermal-reversible<br>
carriers are disclosed for example in U.S. Patent No. 5,427,614. Examples of suitable<br>
thermoplastic resins for use as themal-reversible carriers include dammars, mastic,<br>
rosin, shellac, sandarac, and glcerol ester of rosin. In one embodiment, the thermal-<br>
reversible carrier for making a core by molding is selected from polyalkylene glycols,<br>
polyalkaline oxides, and combinations thereof.<br>
In embodiments in which the shell comprises an active ingredient intended to<br>
have immediate release from the dosage form, the shell is preferably prepared via<br>
solvent-free molding. In such embodiments a thermal-reversible carrier is employed<br>
in the flowable material to make the shell, said thermal-reversible carrier preferably<br>
selected from polyethylene glycol with weight average molecular weight from about<br>
1450 to about 20000, polyethylene oxide with weight average molecular weight from<br>
about 100,000 to about 900,000, and the like.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the shell is applied to the core by<br>
enrobing. In enrobing methods, cast films are applied to opposite sides of a core, i.e.,<br>
a compressed tablet, using rotating dies, and are sealed together in an essentially<br>
edge-to-edge manner at a seal line that extends around the core at a desired place.<br>
The dies are positioned such that the surfaces are in abutting relationship with one<br>
another, thereby forming a nip in between. Each of the dies has a series of matching<br>
recesses on its circumferential surface. As the dies rotate, the films are joined and<br>
fused together at the nip between the dies where a pair of matching recesses form a<br>
pocket into which a core is dropped by a metered feed mechanism. As the dies<br>
continue to rotate, the core urges the films into the interior of the recesses in the dies,<br>
and the core is thereby securely enveloped and enrobed by the films, while the films<br>
continue to be joined about the core by the dies. Simultaneously with the fusing of<br>
the films about the core, the enrobed core is pinch cut from the films by the rotary<br>
dies, whereupon it separates from the films in the form of an individual enrobed<br>
dosage form.<br>
Useful enrobing methods and apparatuses are described for example in U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 5,146,730 and 5,459,983, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein<br>
weight percent or at least about 25 weight percent of a film-former. The shell may<br>
again also optionally further comprise up to about 30 weight percent total of various<br>
plasticizers, adjuvants, and excipients.<br>
The total weight of the shell is preferably about 20 percent to about 400<br>
percent of the total weight of the cores. In embodiments wherein the shell is prepared<br>
by a solvent-free molding process, the total weight of the shell is typically from about<br>
50 percent to about 400 percent, e.g. from about 75 percent to about 400 percent, or<br>
about 100 percent to about 200 percent of the total weight of the cores. In<br>
embodiments wherein the shell is prepared by a solvent-based molding process, the<br>
total weight of the shell is typically from about 20 percent to about 100 percent of the<br>
total weight of the cores.<br>
In embodiments in which the shell is applied to the core by molding, at least a<br>
portion of the shell surrounds the core such that the shell inner surface resides<br>
substantially confonnally upon the core outer surface. As used herein, the term<br>
"substantially conformally" shall mean that the inner surface of the shell has peaks<br>
and valleys or indentations and protrusions corresponding substantially inversely to<br>
the peaks and valleys of the outer surface of the core, hi certain such embodiments,<br>
the indentations and protrusions typically have a length, width, height or depth in one<br>
dimension of greater than 10 microns, say greater than 20 microns, and less than<br>
about 30,000 microns, preferably less than about 2000 microns.<br>
m those embodiments in which solvent-free molding is employed, the<br>
flowable material may comprise a thermal-reversible carrier. Suitable thermal-<br>
reversible carriers for use in making a core, the shell or both by molding are<br>
thermoplastic materials typically having a melting point below about 110°C, more<br>
preferably between about 20 and about 100°C. Examples of suitable thermal-<br>
reversible carriers for solvent-free molding include thermplastic polyalkalene glycols,<br>
thermoplastic polyalkalene oxides, low melting hydrophobic materials, thermoplastic<br>
polymers, thermoplastic starches, and the like. Preferred thermal-reversible carriers<br>
include polyethylene glycol and polyethylene oxide. Suitable thermoplastic<br>
polyalkylene glycols for use as thermal-reversible carriers include polyethylene glycol<br>
having molecular weight from about 100 to about 20,000, e.g. from about 100 to<br>
about 8,000 Daltons. Suitable thermoplastic polyalkalene oxides include<br>
polyethylene oxide having a molecular weight from about 100,000 to about 900,000<br>
Daltons. Suitable low-melting hydrophobic materials for use as thermal-reversible<br>
carriers include fats, fatty acid esters, phospholipids, and waxes which are solid at<br>
room temperature, fat-containing mixtures such as chocolate; and the tike. Examples<br>
of suitable fats include hydrogenated vegetable oils such as for example cocoa butter,<br>
hydrogenated palm kernel oil, hydrogenated cottonseed oil, hydrogenated sunflower<br>
oil, and hydrogenated soybean oil; and free fatty acids and their salts. Examples of<br>
suitable fatty acid esters include sucrose fatty acid esters, mono, di, and triglycerides,<br>
glyceryl behenate, glyceryl palmitostearate, glyceryl monostearate, glyceryl<br>
tristearate, glyceryl trilaurylate, glyceryl myristate, GlycoWax-932, lauroyl macrogol-<br>
32 glycerides, and stearoyl macrogol-32 glycerides. Examples of suitable<br>
phospholipids include phosphotidyl choline, phosphotidyl serene, phosphotidyl<br>
enositol, and phosphotidic acid. Examples of suitable waxes which are solid at room<br>
temperature include carnauba wax, spermaceti wax, beeswax, candelilla wax, shellac<br>
wax, microcrystalline wax, and paraffin wax. Suitable thermoplastic polymers for use<br>
as thermal-reversible carriers include thermoplastic water swellable cellulose<br>
derivatives, thermoplastic water insoluble polymers, thermoplastic vinyl polymers,<br>
thermoplastic starches, and thermoplastic resins, and combinations thereof. Suitable<br>
thermoplastic water swellable cellulose derivatives include include<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC), methyl cellulose (MC),<br>
carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), cross-linked hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropyl<br>
cellulose (HPC), hydroxybutylcellulose (HBC), hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC),<br>
hydroxypropylethylcellulose, hydroxypropylbutylcellulose,<br>

thereof. Suitable thermoplastic water insoluble polymers include ethylcellulose,<br>
polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl acetate, polycaprolactones, cellulose acetate and its<br>
derivatives, acrylates, methacrylates, acrylic acid copolymers, and the like and<br>
derivatives, copolymers, and combinations thereof. Suitable thermoplastic vinyl<br>
polymers include polyvinylacetate, polyvinyl alcohol, and polyvinyl pyrrolidone<br>
by reference. Referring to the 730 patent and Figure 13 in particular, cast films 36<br>
and 37 are formed on rotating casting drums 42 and 43, which are cooled by a<br>
coolant. The films are fed through a series of rotating drums to drum-like dies 38 and<br>
39, which rotate synchronously with one another. Dies 38 and 39 are symmetrically<br>
disposed relative to one another about a functional center plane 54 of the overall<br>
enrobing apparatus. Films 36 and 37 contact each other at the nip between dies 38<br>
and 39. Here, the cores are enrobed with coating, and the two films are sealed<br>
together and cut.<br>
Specifically, a web is created as films 36 and 37 converge and are squeezed<br>
together. The films self-adhere together. After emerging from between dies 38 and<br>
39, the web containing the enrobed cores passes between a pair of mangle rolls 63.<br>
The web is stretched, and the enrobed cores self separate and drop into product<br>
receptacles 65.<br>
Referring to Figure 20 of the '730 patent, each die 38,39 has a plurality of<br>
recesses 108, which cooperate with corresponding recesses in the other die. The<br>
cavities of these recesses are shaped to receive a single core. The cavities are defined<br>
by ribs 109 that close together to cut the enrobed cores from the web. Teem 115 on<br>
the edges of the dies 38,39 grip the films 36,37.<br>
The enrobed cores can be washed and dried, and optionally further processed<br>
as desired.<br>
In another embodiment, the shell is again applied to the core by enrobing,<br>
however the films used to make the shell each comprise visually distinct portions, for<br>
example stripes. The films are applied by the enrobing method described in<br>
commonly assigned, copending U.S. Application Serial Nos.____________[MCP<br>
301 and MCP3161. Referring generally to Figures 9-11 therein, the film casting<br>
apparatus 30 for this method of enrobing comprises a casting drum 34, the exterior<br>
surface 36 of which is cooled to at least partially solidify coating materials coming<br>
into contact therewith. A multi-chamber slit extruder 38 deposits film onto the<br>
casting drum 34. The extruder 38 comprises partitions 58,60,62 mat divide the<br>
interior 44 into four chambers 64,66, 68, 70. The chambers 64,66,68, 70 can each<br>
92b', 92c' of each film 32,32'. All of the color transitions 92a, 92b, 92c, 92a', 92b',<br>
92c' are aligned with the conjugate plane of symmetry 16 of a corresponding core 10.<br>
Furthermore, the enrobing apparatus 102 preferably includes registering<br>
means 120 (shown schematically in Figure 14 of the [MCP 301]________-<br>
application) for ensuring that the colored stripes (not shown) of the films 32,32' are<br>
properly aligned with one another prior to passage between the rotary dies 112,112'.<br>
The registering means 120 also ensures that the positions of the dispensed cores 10<br>
are appropriate relative to the color transitions 92a, 92b, 92c, 92a', 92b', 92c', such<br>
that the transition between the colors on the resulting products 122 are properly<br>
matched with one another and the conjugate plane of symmetry 18 of each core 10.<br>
An enlarged schematic perspective view of the drum-like rotary dies 112, 112'<br>
is provided in Figure 16 of the [MCP 301]________application. The rotary dies<br>
112,112' are substantially identical to one another, each having an exterior<br>
circumferential surface 124,124' with a series of recesses 126,126' thereon. Each<br>
recess 126,126' is arranged such that its length 130, 130' is aligned parallel to the<br>
axis of rotation AR, AR' of its respective rotary die 112,112'. Each recess 126 on<br>
one die 112 cooperates with a corresponding recess 126' on the other die 112'. In<br>
addition, the number of rows of recesses 126,126' should correspond to the number<br>
of color transitions 92a, 92b, 92c, 92a', 92b', 92c' between the stripes 84, 86, 88, 90,<br>
84', 86', 88', 90' on the striped films 32, 32', respectively, mat pass between the dies<br>
112,112'.<br>
The orientation of the striped films 32, 32' as they pass between the rotary<br>
dies 112,112' is such that, for example, red stripes 84, 88 of one film 32 are matched<br>
with the red stripes 84', 88' of the other film 32' and yellow stripes 86, 90, 86', 90' of<br>
each film 32,32', respectively, are similarly matched with one another. The<br>
registering means 120 of the enrobing apparatus 102 may be used to facilitate the<br>
orientation of the films 32,32' such that the matching and alignment of the color<br>
transitions of each film are improved.<br>
As the rotary dies 112,112' rotate, the cores 10 are dispensed to the nip<br>
between the dies 112, 112' such that they are oriented with their lengths aligned<br>
contain visually different coating materials, i.e., different colored coating materials.<br>
Each partition has a tapered blade edge 94, 96, 98 to control the flow of coating<br>
material onto the casting drum 34. The coating materials are supplied to the chambers<br>
from for example feeder pipes 72, 74. An open slit 78 is located at the bottom of the<br>
slit extruder 38. Slit 78 communicates with each chamber 64, 66,68, 70. The slit<br>
extruder is heated to heat the coating materials to a flowable state, which depending<br>
on the material may be in the range of about 40 to 250" C.<br>
Referring to Figures 14-16 of the [MCP 301] application, an enrobing<br>
apparatus 102 for use with cast films having visually distinct portions similar to that<br>
described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,146,730 and 5,459,983 may be used. In particular,<br>
cast films 32,32' are moved in a continuous manner, by a series of rollers 106,108,<br>
110,106', 108', 110' toward a pair ofcoacting rotary dies 112,112', which are<br>
positioned symmetrically on either side of the central plane of symmetry 104 of the<br>
apparatus 102. The rotary dies 112, 112' rotate on their axes of rotation AR, ARrespectively, thereby forming a nip in between. The nip between the rotary dies 112,<br>
112' lies in the aforesaid central plane of.symmetry 104 and the striped films 32, 32'<br>
are passed therethrough.<br>
i The enrobing apparatus 102 also includes a core dispensing means 118, which<br>
holds a supply of cores 10 and dispenses them to the nip in a timed manner. The core<br>
dispensing means 118 is also aligned with the central plane of symmetry 104. The<br>
core dispensing means 118 orients and dispenses each core 10 such mat the core 10<br>
simultaneously contacts the contact surfaces 32a, 32a' of the converging striped films<br>
32,32' as the core 10 enters the nip, with its transverse plane of symmetry 16 lying in<br>
the central plane of symmetry 104 of the enrobing apparatus 102, and the color<br>
transitions 92a, 92a' of the films 32, 32', respectively, lying in the conjugate plane of<br>
symmetry 18 of the core 10. The films 32,32' are then stretched around the opposite<br>
sides of each core 10 symmetrically.<br>
Figure 15 of the [MCP 301]________application shows the proper<br>
positioning of the cores 10 in between the striped films 32, 32' as they enter the nip<br>
between the dies 112,112' and relative to the color transitions 92a, 92b, 92c, 92a',<br>
parallel to the axes of rotation AR, AR' of the dies 112,112' and each core 10 is<br>
thereby properly aligned to be received between a pair of coacting recesses 126, 126'.<br>
The rotary dies 112,112' continue to rotate and the films 32, 32' are sealed to each<br>
other by the raised rims 128,128' of the coacting recesses 126, 126', around the core<br>
10 thereby forming a film seam 134, which lies in the transverse plane of symmetry<br>
16 of the core 10. The raised rims 128,128' also cut through the bonded films 32,<br>
32', at the film seam 134 around each enrobed core 10, thereby releasing the enrobed<br>
core products 122, from the bonded films 32,32'.<br>
The film seam 134 created may comprise abutting film edges. It is also<br>
possible to have a film seam 134 wherein the cut edge of one film 32 slightly overlaps<br>
the cut edge of the other film 32' by an amount approximately equal to the thickness<br>
of the films 32,32'. Alternatively, the film seam 134 could be formed such that the<br>
cut edges of the films 32, 32' are aligned with one another about the core 10, but are<br>
spaced apart slightly by a distance that is approximately equal to the thickness of the<br>
films 32, 32'.<br>
If aesthetically desired, the films 32, 32' may be aligned such that the resulting<br>
products 122 have a film seam 134 wherein a stripe of one color (for example, a red<br>
stripe 84) (or visual distinction) of one film 32 abuts or overlaps a stripe of another<br>
color (for example, a yellow stripe 90') (or visual distinction) of the other film 32' to<br>
form a product 122 having a "checkerboard pattern", i.e., having four quadrants of<br>
alternating red and yellow colors (or other visual distinctions).<br>
Figures 17-19 of the [MCP 301]_________- application depict an<br>
alternative film casting apparatus 136 for use with enrobing processes. The<br>
alternative film casting apparatus 136 includes film receiving means, such as a<br>
conventional metal casting belt 140 that is mounted onto two rotating drums 142,144,<br>
for receiving the film 138 being cast thereon. The rotating drums 142,144 rotate,<br>
thereby causing the casting belt 140 to move in the directions indicated by the arrows<br>
J and K. A warming plate 148 may be positioned adjacent to the casting belt 140 to<br>
warm the casting belt 140 prior to casting film thereon. A cooling plate 150 is<br>
positioned adjacent to the casting belt 140 to cool the casting belt 140 after film is cast<br>
thereon.<br>
The alternative film casting apparatus 136 further includes film depositing<br>
means, such as a reciprocating multi-chamber slit extruder 146, for depositing the film<br>
138, in a semi-continuous manner, onto the casting belt 138. As with the slit extruder<br>
38 discussed above, the reciprocating slit extruder 146 includes interior partitions 152,<br>
154,156 that form interior chambers 158,160,162,164 for holding visually distinct<br>
coating material 166,168 therein. A slit 170 is also provided, through which the<br>
coating materials 166,168 flow out of the chambers 158,160,162,164 and onto the<br>
casting belt 140, thereby creating a striped film 138.<br>
The reciprocating slit extruder 146 also includes supply means, such as feeder<br>
pipes 182,184 for supplying the coating materials 166, 168 to each of the chambers<br>
158,160, 162,164 and flow control means, such as a slidable gate 180 for controlling<br>
the flow of the coating materials 166,168 from the chambers 158,160,162,164.<br>
Each of the interior partitions 152,154,156 of the reciprocating slit extruder 146 has<br>
stripe control means, such as a tapered blade edge, to control the flow of the coating<br>
materials 166,168 exiting the chambers 158,160,162, 164. One notable difference<br>
between the slit extruder 38 described above and the present reciprocating slit<br>
extruder 146 is that reciprocating slit extruder 146 is connected to a conventional<br>
motor such that it moves reciprocatingly in the directions indicated by arrow M in<br>
Figure 18 of the [MCP 301]________- application.<br>
Initially, feeder pipes 182, 184 supply coating materials 166,168 of two<br>
colors, such as red and yellow, respectively, to alternate chambers 158,160,162,164,<br>
respectively, of the reciprocating slit extruder 146. Within chambers 158,160,162,<br>
164 the coating materials 166,168 become or are maintained as liquid and flowable.<br>
Cooling plate 150 at least partially solidifies the coating material 166,168 upon<br>
physical contact with the surface of the casting belt 140 to form the transversely<br>
striped film 138.<br>
After the coating materials 166,168, the warming plate 148 and the cooling<br>
plate 150 have attained their desired temperatures, a portion 198 of the casting belt<br>
140 is warmed by the wanning plate 148 and is then advanced by the rotating drums<br>
142,144 to a position underneath the reciprocating slit extruder 146. The slidable<br>
gate 180 is men moved to a position which opens the slit 170 to the thickness that is<br>
desired for the striped film 138. While the rotating drums 142,144 and the casting<br>
belt 140 remain stationary, the coating materials 166, 168 flow out of the chambers<br>
158,160,162,164, along the tapered blade edges (not shown), through the slit 170<br>
and onto the warmed portion 198 of the casting belt 140, which briefly maintains the<br>
coating material 166,168 in a substantially liquid, flowable state.<br>
Simultaneously with the flow of the coating materials 166,168 onto the<br>
casting belt 140, the reciprocating slit extruder 146 is moved from a first position 194<br>
to a second position 196, where it is temporarily halted. As soon as the reciprocating<br>
slit extruder 146 reaches its second position 196, the slidable gate 180 is moved to a<br>
closed position, thereby blocking the slit 170 and temporarily halting the flow of<br>
coating materials 166,168, which results in the formation of a film segment 200. The<br>
film segment 200 has alternating, transversely oriented red stripes 172, 176 and<br>
yellow stripes 174,178 with straight and consistent color transitions 186,188,190<br>
therebetween.<br>
Next, the casting belt 140 is moved by the rotating drums 142,144, such that<br>
the film segment 200 is moved, and a newly warmed portion of the casting belt 140 is<br>
positioned beneath the reciprocating slit extruder 140. The first film segment 200 is<br>
cooled while the second film segment is cast onto the casting belt 140.<br>
When it is desired to cast a subsequent film segment, with the reciprocating<br>
slit extruder 146, now in its second position 196, and the casting belt 140 held<br>
stationary, the slidable gate 180 is again moved to a position which opens the slit 170<br>
by an amount that is equal to the thickness desired for the striped film 138. As<br>
coating materials 166,168 flow out onto the casting belt 140, the reciprocating slit<br>
extruder 146 is moved from its second position 196 back to its first position 194,<br>
where it is again temporarily halted. As the coating materials 166,168 are being cast<br>
onto the casting belt 140, the first edge of the new film segment will meet and bond<br>
with the second edge 204 of the first film segment 200. After the reciprocating slit<br>
extruder 146 returns to its first position 194, the slidable gate 180 is again moved to<br>
its closed position, thereby blocking the slit 170 and temporarily halting the flow of<br>
coating materials 166,168, which results in the creation of a new film segment that is<br>
bonded to the first film segment 200.<br>
The foregoing process steps are repeated continuously, resulting in a film<br>
casting process that is semi-continuous and which produces a continuous ribbon of<br>
transversely striped film 138. The transversely striped film 138 is continuously<br>
removed from the casting belt 140 by a scraper or other device and then fed into the<br>
rotary die enrobing apparatus 102 for enrobing cores 10 as described above.<br>
However, because the alternative film casting apparatus 136 produces film 138 having<br>
stripes that are transversely oriented, rotary dies 208,208' have recesses 210,210'<br>
which are oriented such that their lengths are aligned perpendicularly to the axes of<br>
rotation of their respective rotary dies. In addition, the core dispensing means used<br>
herewith orients, and dispenses each core 10 to the nip between the dies 208,208' end-<br>
first, i.e., such that one of the ends 12,14 of each caplet 10 simultaneously contacts<br>
the converging films 138,138' as the core 10 enters the nip.<br>
Figures 22-30 of the [MCP 301]_________application are directed to an<br>
alternative enrobing apparatus for making films with visually distinct portions, which<br>
includes the alternative film casting apparatus 136 described above. A transversely<br>
striped film is fed, along with cores, into the alternative enrobing apparatus to produce<br>
bi-colored products, each having a film seam that only partially circumscribes the<br>
core and which lies in a reference plane that is different from the reference plane in<br>
which the color transition of the product lies.<br>
The alternative enrobing apparatus includes a conveyor system 220 that<br>
comprises a series of horizontally-oriented rollers 222 and pairs of rollers, 224,226,<br>
228 for supporting and conveying the transversely striped film 138. A core<br>
dispensing means 230 is positioned above the conveyor system 220 and the film 138<br>
for the purpose of dispensing cores 10 onto the film 138 in the required orientation<br>
with respect to the color transitions 186,188,190. The core dispensing means 230<br>
includes slat feeders 234,236 that orient the cores as required for proper positioning<br>
onto the film 138. The core dispensing means 230 further includes a core positioning<br>
slat 238 and a core plunger 240 positioned above the positioning slat 238.<br>
Cores 10 are fed from hopper 232, through the slat feeders 234,236, to the<br>
positioning slat 238. The cores 10', 10", 10'" are lined up, end 12 to end 14 and,<br>
thereby, each core is moved along the positioning slat 238 in a substantially<br>
continuous manner by the core behind it. When a core 10' is pushed beyond the<br>
support rails 248, 250 and is no longer supported thereby, and when the position of a<br>
color transition 186 of the film 138 lies in the conjugate plane of symmetry 18' of<br>
core 10', a registering means 242 signals a motor, which moves the plunger 240 up<br>
and down until the core 10' contacts and rests upon the film 138. When plunger 240<br>
reaches its uppermost position, it momentarily stops until the next core 10" is moved<br>
beyond support rails 248,250 contained within the positioning slat 238. The<br>
foregoing events are repeated continuously as long as cores 10 are fed and moved<br>
through the positioning slat 238.<br>
The beginning portion of the conveyor system 220, i.e., the portion that is<br>
located between the alternative film casting apparatus 136 and a short distance on the<br>
opposite side of the core positioning slat 238, is comprised of horizontally-oriented<br>
rollers 222. Film 138 is moved by the horizontally-oriented rollers 222 along this<br>
beginning portion. The remaining portion of the conveyor system 220, which is<br>
located between a short distance past the positioning slat 238 and the rotary dies 260,<br>
262, is comprised of pairs of rollers 224,226,228. As shown schematically in Figure<br>
26 of the [MCP 301]_________application, the individual rollers of sequential pairs<br>
of rollers 224,226,228 are gradually and sequentially pivoted upward from the<br>
horizontal plane, in increments of about 10 degrees for each successive pair of rollers<br>
224,226,228, starting proximate to the positioning slat 238. Accordingly, as the film<br>
138 approaches the rotary dies 260,262, the film 138 is folded longitudinally about<br>
the cores 10.<br>
The rotary dies 260,262 rotate and cooperate with one another to form a nip<br>
therebetween, into which the cores 10 and the film 138 are fed. Likewise, each of the<br>
dies 260,262 have recesses 282,284, arranged circumferentially in a row on the<br>
surface of each die 260, 262. The recesses 282,284 each have raised rims for sealing<br>
and cutting the bonded film 138 about the cores 10, thereby enrobing the cores 10.<br>
The rotary dies 260,262 however, are oriented such that they rotate in the horizontal<br>
plane, rather than in the vertical plane as do the previously discussed rotary dies 112,<br>
112', 208,208'. Furthermore, when the cores 10 are fed into the nip, the film 138 is<br>
folded and partially bonded about them. Furthermore, the partially enrobed cores 10<br>
are fed successively, i.e., one-by-one, into the nip between the dies 260, 262.<br>
The shell may also be applied to the core using a vacuum forming apparatus.<br>
Commonly assigned, copending U.S. Patent Application Serial Nos. [MCP 301 and<br>
MCP 316]________________disclose such apparatuses.<br>
With reference to Figures 31-44 of the [MCP 301]______________<br>
application, a vacuum forming apparatus 292 includes a first plurality of individual<br>
porous platens 294, a first conveyor system 296 and a second conveyor system 298.<br>
The first and second conveyor systems 296,298 are arranged in series with one<br>
another, thereby creating a single path along which the porous platens 294 are moved<br>
in semi-continuous fashion. The first and second conveyer systems 296,298 are<br>
provided with conventional vacuum sources that apply a vacuum to each of the<br>
porous platens 294 while they are moved along the apparatus.<br>
The vacuum forming apparatus 292 further includes a second plurality of<br>
individual porous platens 304 and a third conveyor system 306 that moves porous<br>
platens 304 along a second path, which is shown by the arrow GG in Figure 31. The<br>
third conveyor system 306 is positioned between the first and second conveyor<br>
systems 296,298.<br>
A rotating mechanism 308 is also positioned between the first and second<br>
conveyor systems 296,298. The rotating mechanism 308 simultaneously holds<br>
together two of platens, i.e., one platen 294 and a corresponding platen 304, and<br>
rotates them together, such that the platen 304, first on top, is inverted and positioned<br>
on the bottom.<br>
Each porous platen 294,304 has at least one recess 310,312, respectively,<br>
sized and shaped to temporarily but snugly receive therein a core 10 to be enrobed.<br>
It is possible to achieve multi-colored enrobed products having color<br>
transitions oriented in a variety of different ways using different combinations of the<br>
platens with transversely and longitudinally striped films. However, within a<br>
particular vacuum forming apparatus, the orientation of the recesses 310, 312 in all of<br>
the platens 294,304 must be longitudinal, or, alternatively, me orientation of the<br>
recesses 310,312 in all of the platens 294,304 must be transverse (or otherwise<br>
aligned with the orientation of the stripes on the films).<br>
The vacuum forming apparatus 292 further includes a first pair of rollers 338,<br>
340 having a film 342 mounted thereon. The first pair of rollers 338, 340 is<br>
positioned proximate to the first conveyor system 296 such mat the first film 342 is<br>
suspended above the first plurality of porous platens 294. A second pair of rollers<br>
344, 346 having a second film 348 mounted thereon is positioned proximate to the<br>
second conveyor system 298 such that the second film 348 is also suspended above<br>
the first plurality of porous platens 294<br>
The vacuum forming apparatus 292 also includes a first registering device 350<br>
positioned proximate to the first conveyor system 296 for properly positioning the<br>
first film 342 relative to a core 10 that is positioned within the recess 310 of the<br>
porous platen 294. A second registering device 352 is positioned proximate to the<br>
second conveyor system 298 for properly positioning the second film 348 relative to a<br>
partially enrobed core 10 that is positioned within the recess 310 of another of the<br>
porous platens 294.<br>
The vacuum forming apparatus 292 also includes a first ring press 354 and a<br>
first film cutter 356 that are positioned proximate to the first conveyor system 296 and<br>
move in a reciprocating fashion. Additionally, a second ring press 358 and a second<br>
film cutter 360 are positioned proximate to the second conveyor system 298. The first<br>
and second ring presses 354,358 each have an open configuration, such as an O-<br>
shape or an oval shape, as viewed from above, such that there is formed a passageway<br>
362,364, respectively, therethrough. Each of the ring presses 354,358 also has a<br>
contacting edge 366,368, respectively, configured to contact the first and second<br>
films 342, 348, respectively, without damaging them. Each of the ring presses 354,<br>
358 is sized and shaped such that the contacting edges 366, 368 circumscribe a core<br>
10 therein.<br>
The first and second film cutters 356,360 each have a recess 370,372,<br>
respectively, that is sized and shaped to receive therein a portion of a partially<br>
enrobed core 10 which already has a film coating applied thereto. The first film cutter<br>
356 is oriented to face the porous platen 294 positioned thereunder, while the second<br>
film cutter 360 is oriented to face the porous platen 304 positioned thereunder. The<br>
first and second film cutters 356, 360 also move reciprocatingly.<br>
The first film 342 is mounted onto a first pair of rollers 338, 340 and stretched<br>
therebetween, such that the first film 342 is positioned between the first conveyor<br>
system 296 and the first plurality of porous platens 294 on one side, and the first ring<br>
press 354 and the first film cutter 356 on the other side. Similarly, the second film<br>
348 is mounted onto a second pair of rollers 344,346 and stretched therebetween,<br>
such that the second film 348 is positioned between the second conveyor system 298<br>
and the first plurality porous platens 294 on one side, and the second ring press 360<br>
and the second film cutter 362 on the other side.<br>
Initially, the first, second and third conveyor systems 296,298, 306 are set<br>
into motion, thereby moving the porous platens 294,304 in the directions indicated by<br>
the arrows BE, FF, GG, respectively, in Figure 31 of the [MCP 301]_________<br>
application. The first conveyor system 296 moves one of the porous platens 294 to a<br>
position that is immediately prior to the first station 378. A core 10 is placed into the<br>
recess 310 of this porous platen 294 and held firmly in the recess 310 by the<br>
aforementioned vacuum, which is continuously applied to the platen 294 and all<br>
others on the conveyor 298, by a first vacuum source 300.<br>
Platen 294 is next moved by the first conveyor system 296 to the first station<br>
378. Movement of the platen 294 ceases temporarily when the first registering device<br>
350 confirms that the core 10 is properly positioned. While the platen 294 is<br>
momentarily stationary, hot air is blown through the first ring press 354, thereby<br>
The platen 304 is then moved toward the partially enrobed core 10 until the partially<br>
enrobed core 10 is held within the recesses 310, 312 of both of the platens 294, 304<br>
(as shown in Figures 31 and 40 of the [MCP 301]_________- application). The<br>
vacuum being applied to the porous platen 294 is discontinued and the platens 294,<br>
304 are rotated with the partially enrobed core 10 therebetween, whereupon the platen<br>
294 holding the core 10 is inverted, and the platen 304 is moved into a right-side-up<br>
position. The now inverted platen 294 is now moved away from the right-side-up<br>
platen 304 and becomes one of the platens 304 moving along the path shown by the<br>
arrow GG in Figure 31 of the [MCP 301]_________— application. The right-side-up<br>
platen 304 is next moved onto the second conveyor system 298 and becomes one of<br>
the platens 294 moving along the path shown by the arrows EE, FF in Figure 31 of the<br>
[MCP 301]________- application. Next, a vacuum is applied to partially enrobed<br>
core 10, thereby holding the partially enrobed core 10 within the recess 310 of the<br>
platen 294, which is now moving on the second conveyor system 298, such that the<br>
uncovered portion of the partially enrobed core 10 is exposed.<br>
Platen 294 and partially enrobed core 10 are moved by the second conveyor<br>
system 298 to the fifth station 386 of the vacuum forming apparatus 292. Movement<br>
of the platen 294 ceases temporarily when the second registering device 352 confirms<br>
that the partially enrobed core 10 is properly positioned relative to the second film<br>
248. While the platen 294 is momentarily stationary, hot air is blown through the<br>
second ring press 358 to soften the second film 348 to a formable state. The second<br>
ring press 358 is then moved such that the contacting edge 368 of the second ring<br>
press 358 contacts and presses the second film 348 onto the working surface 314 of<br>
the platen 294 and into contact with the uncovered portion of the partially enrobed<br>
core 10.<br>
The heated second film 248 is then pulled onto the core 10 by a vacuum<br>
applied by the second vacuum source 302, thereby conforming the second film 248 to<br>
the shape of the uncovered portion of the core 10. Thereafter, the second ring press<br>
358 is retracted and the platen 294, having the enrobed core 10 held in its recess 310<br>
by the vacuum, is now moved to the sixth station 388 and temporarily stopped there.<br>
It is noted that, as shown in Figure 42 of the [MCP 301]__________application, the<br>
softening the first film 342 to a formable state. The first ring press 354 is then moved,<br>
such that the contacting edge 366 of the first ring press 354 presses the first film 342<br>
onto the working surface 314 of the platen 294 and into contact with the top half of<br>
the core 10.<br>
The heated first film 342 is simultaneously pulled onto the core 10 and thereby<br>
made to conform to the shape of the top half of the core 10 by the aforementioned<br>
vacuum. Thereafter, the first ring press 354 is retracted and platen 294 is moved to<br>
the second station 380, where it is temporarily stopped. While the platen 294 and the<br>
core 10 are temporarily stationary, cold air is blown onto the first film 342 and core<br>
10, thereby cooling and molding the first film 342 into conformity with the top half of<br>
the core 10.<br>
Referring to Figures 36-44 of the [MCP 301]_________application, after<br>
sufficient time has passed to cool and mold the first film 342 onto the core 10, the<br>
platen 294 and partially enrobed core 10 are moved a predetermined distance by the<br>
first conveyor system 296 to the third station 382 of the vacuum forming apparatus<br>
292 and temporarily halted there such that the partially enrobed core 10 is aligned<br>
with the recess 370 and the cutting edge 374 of the first film cutter 356. The first film<br>
cutter 356 is moved until the partially enrobed core 10 is received snugly within the<br>
recess 370 and the tapered cutting edge 374 contacts and cuts through the first film<br>
342 closely around the perimeter of the partially enrobed core 10. The first film cutter<br>
356 is then moved away from the platen 294.<br>
The platen 294 and partially enrobed core 10 are next moved to the fourth, or<br>
rotating, station 384 of the vacuum forming apparatus 292 and, again, temporarily<br>
stopped, whereupon the partially enrobed core 10 is transferred to one of the platens<br>
304, as follows. The third conveyor system 306 moves one of the platens 304 into<br>
position at the rotating station 384, such mat it is inverted relative to the platen 294<br>
carrying the partially enrobed core 10 thereon. After the platen 294 is moved a<br>
predetermined distance, such that the partially enrobed core 10 is aligned with the<br>
recess 312 of the inverted platen 304, the first conveyor system 296 holds the platen<br>
294 and partially enrobed core 10 temporarily stationary at the rotating station 384.<br>
second film 348 partially overlaps the cut edge of the first film 342 that has already<br>
been applied to the core 10. While the platen 294 and the core 10 are temporarily<br>
stationary, cold air is now blown onto the second film 248 and core 10, thereby<br>
cooling and molding the second film 348 into conformity with the core 10.<br>
After sufficient time has passed to cool and mold the second film 348 onto the<br>
core 10, the platen 294 and the enrobed core 10 are moved a predetermined distance<br>
by the second conveyor system 298 to the seventh station 390 of the vacuum forming<br>
apparatus 292 and temporarily halted there such that the enrobed core 10 is aligned<br>
with the recess 372 and the cutting edge 376 of the second film cutter 360. The<br>
second film cutter 360 is moved until the enrobed core 10 is received snugly within<br>
the recess 372 and the cutting edge 376 contacts and cuts through the second film 248<br>
closely around the perimeter of the enrobed core 10. The second film cutter 360 is<br>
men moved away from the platen 294.<br>
The platen 294 and fully enrobed core 10 are moved by the second conveyer<br>
system 298 away from the seventh station 390. After the platen 294 and enrobed core<br>
10 are past the seventh station 390, the vacuum being applied to the platen 294 is<br>
ceased, thereby releasing the enrobed product 404 from the recess 310.<br>
Alternatively, platens having recesses that are each circumscribed by a raised<br>
cutting ridge capable of cleanly cutting the first and second films 342,348 may be<br>
used. Alternatively, instead of first placing the caplet 10 into the recess 310 of the<br>
first platen 294, the first film 342 could be laid across a first platen and then warm air<br>
could be blown o&amp;to the first film 342 to soften it to a formable state. Then, a vacuum<br>
could be applied through the platen to pull the first film 342 into the recess and<br>
conform it thereto. Thereafter, the core 10 could be placed into the recess 310 and<br>
cool air blown onto the platen 294, first film 342 and core, to mold the first film 342<br>
into conformity with the core 10. The second film 348 would then be placed onto the<br>
platen, on top of the core 10, and warm air blown onto the second film 348 to soften it<br>
to a formable state. Another platen would then be moved into contact with the second<br>
film 348, pressing the second film 348 against the core 10 and the first platen 294,<br>
thereby, conforming the second film 348 to the contour of the core 10. Cool air<br>

As used herein, "modified starches" include starches that have been modified<br>
by crosslinking, chemically modified for improved stability or optimized<br>
performance, or physically modified for improved solubility properties or optimized<br>
performance. Examples of chemically-modified starches are well known in the art<br>
and typically include those starches that have been chemically treated to cause<br>
replacement of some of its hydroxyl groups with either ester or ether groups.<br>
Crosslinking, as used herein, may occur in modified starches when two hydroxyl<br>
groups on neighboring starch molecules are chemically linked. As used herein, "pre-<br>
gelatinized starches" or "instantized starches" refers to modified starches that have<br>
been pre-wetted, then dried to enhance their cold-water solubility. Suitable modified<br>
starches are commercially available from several suppliers such as, for example, A.E.<br>
Staley Manufacturing Company, and National Starch &amp; Chemical Company. One<br>
suitable film forming modified starch includes the pre-gelatinized waxy maize<br>
derivative starches that are commercially available from National Starch &amp; Chemical<br>
Company under the tradenames PURITY GUM and F1LMSET, and derivatives,<br>
copolymers, and mixtures thereof. Such waxy maize starches typically contain, based<br>
upon the total weight of the starch, from about 0 percent to about 18 percent of<br>
amylose and from about 100% to about 88% of amylopectin.<br>

onto the caplet 10. Lastly, the raised cutting edges of the recesses may cut through<br>
both of the first and second films 342,348, thereby releasing enrobed products.<br>
It is noted that the hot and cold air temperature ranges, as well as the vacuum<br>
pressure ranges, are within the knowledge of those skilled in the art.<br>
In embodiments in which the shell is applied to the core by spraying, dipping,<br>
enrobing, or molding, the shell is preferably applied to the core in the form of a<br>
flowable material. The flowable material may comprise a dissolved, dispersed, or<br>
molten component, and optionally a solvent or fluid carrier component that may<br>
optionally be removed during processing, for example by drying. Regardless of the<br>
method by which it is applied, the finished shell, and accordingly the flowable<br>
material for making the shell, preferably comprises a film former. Optionally, the<br>
shell or readily soluble shell portion of the present invention may further comprise<br>
one or more thickeners, and various adjuvants and/or excipients as known in the art.<br>
Any film former known in the art is suitable for use in the flowable material.<br>

One suitable hydroxypropylmethylcellulose compound for use as a<br>
thermoplastic film-forming water soluble polymer is "HPMC 2910", which is a<br>
cellulose ether having a degree of substitution of about 1.9 and a hydroxypropyl molar<br>
substitution of 0.23, and containing, based upon the total weight of the compound,<br>
from about 29% to about 30% methoxyl groups and from about 7% to about 12%<br>

sorbose along with their hydrogenated analogs: e.g., glucitol (sorbitol), and mannitol<br>
are preferred. Of the oligosaccharides, the 1,2-disaccharides sucrose and trehalose,<br>
the 1,4-disaccharides maltose, lactose, and cellobiose, and the 1,6-disaccharides<br>
gentiobiose and melibiose, as well as the trisaccharide raffinose are preferred along<br>

In one embodiment of the invention, the flowable material comprises gelatin<br>
as a gelling polymer. Gelatin is a natural, thermogelling polymer. It is a tasteless and<br>
colorless mixture of derived proteins of the albuminous class which is ordinarily<br>
soluble in warm water. Two types of gelatin - Type A and Type B - are commonly<br>
used. Type A gelatin is a derivative of acid-treated raw materials. Type B gelatin is a<br>
derivative of alkali-treated raw materials. The moisture content of gelatin, as well as<br>
its Bloom strength, composition and original gelatin processing conditions, determine<br>
its transition temperature between liquid and solid. Bloom is a standard measure of<br>
the strength of a gelatin gel, and is roughly correlated with molecular weight. Bloom<br>
is defined as the weight in grams required to move a half-inch diameter plastic<br>
plunger 4 mm into a 6.67% gelatin gel that has been held at 10°C for 17 hours. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the flowable material is an aqueous solution comprising 20%<br>
275 Bloom pork skin gelatin, 20% 250 Bloom Bone Gelatin, and approximately 60%<br>
water.<br>

solutions such as mixtures of gelatin and other hydrocolloids at water contents up to<br>
about 30%, such as for example those used to make "gummi" confection forms.<br>
Additional suitable thickeners include crystallizable carbohydrates, and the<br>
like, and derivatives and combinations thereof. Suitable crystallizable carbohydrates<br>
include the monosaccharides and the oligosaccharides. Of the monosaccharides, the<br>

idose, galactose, talose, and the ketohexoses e.g., the D and L isomers of fructose and<br>
"Acid-hydrolyzed starch," as used herein, is one type of modified starch that<br>
results from treating a starch suspension with dilute acid at a temperature below the<br>
gelatinization point of the starch. During the acid hydrolysis, the granular form of the<br>
starch is maintained in the starch suspension, and the hydrolysis reaction is ended by<br>
neutralization, filtration and drying once the desired degree of hydrolysis is reached.<br>
As a result, the average molecular size of the starch polymers is reduced. Acid-<br>
hydrolyzed starches (also known as "thin boiling starches") tend to have a much lower<br>
hot viscosity than the same native starch as well as a strong tendency to gel when<br>
cooled.<br>
"Gelling starches," as used herein, include those starches that, when combined<br>
with water and heated to a temperature sufficient to form a solution, thereafter form a<br>
gel upon cooling to a temperature below the gelation point of the starch. Examples of<br>
gelling starches include, but are not limited to, acid hydrolyzed starches such as that<br>
available from Grain Processing Corporation under the tradename PURE-SET B950;<br>
hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate such as that available from Grain Processing<br>
Corporation under the tradename, PURE-GEL B990, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable low-melting hydrophobic materials include fats, fatty acid esters,<br>
phospholipids, and waxes. Examples of suitable fats include hydrogenated vegetable<br>
oils such as for example cocoa butter, hydrogenated palm kernel oil, hydrogenated<br>
cottonseed oil, hydrogenated sunflower oil, and hydrogenated soybean oil; and free<br>
fatty acids and their salts. Examples of suitable fatty acid esters include sucrose fatty<br>
acid esters, mono, di, and triglycerides, glyceryl behenate, glyceryl palrnitostearate,<br>
glyceryl monostearate, glyceryl tristearate, glyceryl trilaurylate, glyceryl myristate,<br>
GlycoWax-932, lauroyl macrogol-32 glycerides, and stearoyl macrogol-32 glycerides.<br>
Examples of suitable phospholipids include phosphotidyl choline, phosphotidyl<br>
serene, phosphotidyl enositol, and phosphotidic acid. Examples of suitable waxes<br>
include carnauba wax, spermaceti wax, beeswax, candelilla wax, shellac wax,<br>
microcrystalline wax, and paraffin wax; fat-containing mixtures such as chocolate;<br>
and the like.<br>
Suitable non-crystallizable carbohydrates include non-crystallizable sugars<br>
such as polydextrose, and starch hydrolysates, e.g. glucose syrup, com syrup, and<br>
high fructose corn syrup; and non-crystallizable sugar-alcohols such as maltitol syrup.<br>
Suitable solvents for optional use as components of the flowable material<br>
include water; polar organic solvents such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, acetone,<br>
and the like; and non-polar organic solvents such as methylene chloride, and the like;<br>
and mixtures thereof.<br>
The flowable material for making the shell by spraying, dipping, enrobing, or<br>
molding may optionally comprise adjuvants or excipients, which may comprise up to<br>
about 30% by weight of the flowable material. Examples of suitable adjuvants or<br>
excipients include plasticizers, detackifiers, humectants, surfactants, anti-foaming<br>
agents, colorants, flavorants, sweeteners, opacifiers, and the like. Suitable plasticizers<br>
for making the core, the shell, or a portion thereof, by molding include, but not be<br>
limited to polyethylene glycol; propylene glycol; glycerin; sorbitol; triethyl citrate;<br>
tribuyl citrate; dibutyl sebecate; vegetable oils such as castor oil, rape oil, olive oil,<br>
and sesame oil; surfactants such as polysorbates, sodium lauryl sulfates, and dioctyl-<br>
sodium sulfosuccinates; mono acetate of glycerol; diacetate of glycerol; triacetate of<br>
glycerol; natural gums; triacetin; acetyltributyl citrate; diethyloxalate; diethyhnalate;<br>
diethyl fumarate; diethylmalonate; dioctylphthalate; dibutylsuccinate;<br>
glyceroltributyrate; hydrogenated castor oil; fatty acids; substituted triglycerides and<br>
glycerides; and the like and/or mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the plasticizer is<br>
triethyl citrate. In certain embodiments, the shell is substantially free of plasticizers,<br>
i.e. contains less than about 1%, say less than about 0.01% of plasticizers.<br>
The openings may be made in the shell in any manner. A variety of methods<br>
of creating openings or holes in coatings are known in the pharmaceutical and other<br>
arts, and any of these may be used. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art,<br>
different methods of making the openings may lend themselves to combination with<br>
different methods of manufacturing the dosage form and/or applying the shell thereto.<br>
The method of making the openings also depends on the nature and composition of<br>
the shell, and the outer coating if present. The openings may be formed in the shell of<br>
the present invention at any of several different steps in the process, depending partly<br>
on the process used to apply the shell to the core. For embodiments in which the shell<br>
is applied to the core by enrobing, the openings may be formed during formation of<br>
the cast film, after formation of the cast film but prior to application of the film to the<br>
core, during application of the film to the core, or after application of the film to the<br>
core. For embodiments in which the shell is applied to the core by dipping, transfer,<br>
spraying, or molding, the openings may be formed in the shell material during<br>
application of the shell to the core, or after application of the shell to the core.<br>
For example, ablative methods employing erosion, melting, or vaporization of<br>
the shell by water jet erosion, sand blasting, grinding, arc vaporization, dielectric<br>
breakdown, ion beam sputtering, ultrasonic abrasive machining, cavitating fluid jet, or<br>
laser evaporation may be used to make the openings. Mechanical processes such as<br>
punching, perforating, slitting, piercing, drilling, masking followed by dipping, or<br>
vacuum removal may be used to make the openings. Chemical means, such as acid<br>
reactions, base reactions, solvent washing, acid etching with masking, photo etching<br>
with masking, anisotropic wet chemical etching, isotropic wet chemical etching,<br>
hydrophobization whereby dots of a nonwetting material are printed for example on a<br>
roller, or a burned mask effect may be used to make the openings. Methods involving<br>
the application of heat, such as melting with a hot iron, laser machining, arc<br>
evaporation, ultrasonic melting or cavitation, microwave heating, high energy<br>
methods such as plasma methods, infrared selective polymer curing, or induction<br>
heating with ferrous additives may be used to make the openings. Finally, additive<br>
methods such as painting, dipping, solvent washing, enrobing of the core with a<br>
woven material, strands or ribbons, spray coating with a masking material and<br>
removing the masking material by solvent or hydrophobic incompatibility, spraying<br>
through a masking sheet, using ribbons of material, or building up threads or webs or<br>
mats in the shell may also be used to create openings.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the shell is applied to the core by thermal<br>
cycle molding, as described above, and the openings are formed via one or more<br>
protrusions on the inside surface of at least one of the mold assemblies. Each<br>
protrusion, which is adjusted for shape and size as desired, masks a small location on<br>
an underlying core, leaving behind an opening in the shell at the site of the protrusion.<br>
The mold assemblies may comprise a plurality of protrusions to form a plurality of<br>
corresponding openings in the shell. The protrusions may be located on the inside<br>
surface of only one mold assembly, say the upper mold assembly, or located within<br>
only a portion, i.e., one quadrant of the inside surface of one mold assembly, as<br>
desired. Or the protrusions may be arranged to form patterns, symbols, words, and<br>
the like, in the shell.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the shell is applied to the core by<br>
enrobing, either using visually homogeneous films as described in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,146,730 and 5,459,983, or films having visually distinct portions as described in<br>
commonly assigned, copending U.S. Application Serial Nos. [MCP 301 and MCP<br>
316]_________________. In either case, the cast films used for the enrobing step<br>
are perforated either before, during, or after the enrobing process.<br>
In one embodiment, in which the shell is applied to the core by enrobing, the<br>
openings may be formed during formation of the cast film by the mechanical method<br>
of casting the openings into the film using a suitably shaped or textured casting<br>
surface, e.g. chilled film forming roll (exterier surface 36 of casting drum 34 in the<br>
[MCP 301]____________application). Suitable textures include surfaces with<br>
protrusions tall enough that the poured film will not envelope the protrusions, thus<br>
leaving openings in the cooled film. Figure 7 depicts such a forming roll 1010 having<br>
a surface 1020 having a suitable texture that creates voids, slits, or open areas in the<br>
film. The films arrive at the dye rolls 1040 already containing openings.<br>
In a second embodiment, in which the shell is applied to the core via enrobing,<br>
the openings may be mechanically pierced or punched in the cast film after it is<br>
formed, and prior to its application to the core. For example, Figures 8 and 9 depict<br>
perforating apparatuses 1030 located between the forming rolls 1010 and dye rolls<br>
1040. The perforating apparatus pierces, or punches openings into the formed film.<br>
In another such embodiment, utilizing the vacuum forming method of applying the<br>
shell to the core via enrobing, the film is vaccuum formed on a vacuum forming plate<br>
(i.e., a plurality of porous platens 294 as described in the [MCP 301]________<br>
application) into the cavity shapes for depositing the cores into the recess, then the<br>
openings are formed prior to inserting the cores. In one particular such embodiment,<br>
the shaped film with recesses is removed from the forming plate (i.e., the plurality of<br>
porous platens 294), and travels to a perforating apparatus. In another particular<br>
embodiment, the shaped film with recesses remains in contact with the forming plate<br>
(i.e., the plurality of porous platens 294), and openings are formed therein via suitable<br>
ablative methods prior to insertion of the cores. One particularly suitable ablative<br>
method for this application employs a laser to "burn" the openings into the formed<br>
film in the desired shape, size and pattern.<br>
Another particular embodiment wherein openings are formed in the shell prior<br>
to its application to the core by enrobing is depicted in Figure 10. This method<br>
employs a capsule shell (comprising gelatin, starch, cellulose ethers, or other suitable<br>
materials as known in the art and described herein) to enrobe the core of the dosage<br>
form. The capsule shell is formed in two portions 1210 by dipping steel pins into a<br>
solution of shell material in fluid form as known in the art. The shell material is then<br>
solidified on the steel pins. Before removal of the solidified capsule shells from the<br>
forming pins, suitable means, such as for example a laser, is used to burn the openings<br>
in the capsule shell in the desired size, shape, and pattern. The cores 1220 are then<br>
enrobed with the capsule shells 1210 as known in the art, for example by shrink-<br>
fitring capsule shell halves onto compressed tablets as disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,415,868,6,126,767,5,464,631,5,460,824,5,317,849, 5,511,361, 5,609,010,<br>
5,795,588 and 6,080,426, and PCT Appln. No. WO 97/37629 to produce a dosage<br>
form 1230 of the present invention.<br>
In a third embodiment the openings may be formed in the shell during the<br>
application of the shell to the core. In such embodiments, the shell may be applied to<br>
the core by any suitable method, e.g. enrobing, dipping, transfer, spraying, or<br>
molding.<br>
For example, in one embodiment wherein the shell is applied by enrobing, the<br>
surface of the rotary dies 1040 have a suitable texture that creates voids, slits, or open<br>
areas in the shell by perforating, piercing, or punching as the core is being enrobed<br>
with the cast film.<br>
One example of a method of forming openings in the shell during application<br>
of the shell to the core by a dipping process is depicted in Figure 11. In mis method,<br>
the core is held during dipping by a holder 1310 equipped with one or more,<br>
preferably a plurality of masking pins 1320 that hold the core, and mask the areas to<br>
be left uncovered by shell. The shape, size and arrangement of the masking pins 1320<br>
determine the shape, size, and pattern of the openings in the shell. Another example<br>
of a method of forming openings in the shell during application of the shell to the core<br>
by a dipping process is depicted in Figure 12. Here the core is dipped into a foamed<br>
shell material 1420. The air bubbles in the foam will become openings 1430 in the<br>
finished solidified shell. In a similar embodiment, the openings are coreated during<br>
application of the shell by dipping the core into a suspension of solid wax non-pareils<br>
in film-forming shell material. The non-pareils are deposited onto the core along with<br>
the shell material. The shell material is then solidified. Next, heat is applied in order<br>
to melt the wax non-pareils, leaving openings in the shell in the size and shape of the<br>
wax non-pareils. In another embodiment, the core is dipped into a fluid material, e.g.<br>
polymer which reacts and solidifies upon activation by ultraviolet radiation, light, or<br>
heat. In this method, a highly specific or targeted energy source such as a laser is<br>
used to selectively solidify the portion of shell intended to remain on the tablet. After<br>
this treatment, the remaining fluid either drains off or is washed off. In a similar<br>
embodiment, the core surface may be coated with a powder, after which a laser can be<br>
used to selectively melt portions of the powder, leaving unmelted powder where<br>
openings are desired. The remaining material remains a powder and is shaken off.<br>
One example of a preferred method of forming openings in the shell during<br>
application of the shell to the core by a transfer method similar to printing is depicted<br>
in Figure 13. A transfer plate 1510 surface has an engraved image with peaks and<br>
valleys. The shell material is applied in fluid form to the surface of the transfer plate<br>
1510, and selectively fills in the valleys but does not cover the peaks. A "print pad"<br>
applicator 1520 picks up the shell material in the pattern of the image from the<br>
transfer plate 1510 and deposits, or transfers, the shell material in the desired pattern<br>
onto the surface of the core. Transfer plates offer the advantage of allowing indirect<br>
application of the pattern to the dosage form. Another suitable method of painting the<br>
shell material selectively onto the core is by powder coating, e.g. electrostatic<br>
depostion as disclosed in PCT Appln. No. WO 01/57144. Another suitable method of<br>
painting the shell material selectively onto the core is via ink jet printing as disclosed<br>
in.<br>
In a fourth embodiment, the openings may be formed in the shell after the<br>
shell is applied to the core. One such embodiment is depicted in Figure 14. Here, the<br>
core 1610 has protrusions 1620, the shell 1630 is applied to surround the entire core,<br>
then the protrusions are ground off, e.g. by a pair of rotating grinding wheels 1640 to<br>
expose uncoated core (i.e. create openings 1650). in yet another example, the shell is<br>
applied to the core as multiple layers of a film, e.g. by enrobing. Areas of the film are<br>
then selectively burned off with a laser to create openings in the shell surface in the<br>
desired pattern and having any desired depth. In another such embodiment, a<br>
scintering process is used to deposit the shell. Powdered shell material is applied to<br>
the core surface, then heat is applied to partially, but not completely, fuse the powder<br>
particles, creating a porous shell surface. Other preferred methods for forming<br>
openings in the shell after its application to the core employ mechanical methods such<br>
as punching, piercing, drilling, hot knive, melting. One such mechanical method is<br>
depicted in Figure 15. Figure 15 A depicts the use of hot pins or knives to melt and/or<br>
pierce the openings into the shell. Figure 15B depicts the drilling of openings in the<br>
shell. The melting or piercing tips depicted in Figure 15 may form the surface (or<br>
"business end") of either a punch mechanism, or a roller mechanism. Another<br>
suitable mechanical method includes punching the openings into the formed shell as<br>
depicted in Figure 16. In this particular embodiment, the punched-out shell material<br>
remains in the cavity created by the punch, however a portion of the core surface<br>
becomes exposed as part of the interior of the cavity. Alternate methods for forming<br>
openings in the shell after its application to the core include ablative methods such as<br>
sand/grit blasting, grinding, arc vaporization, dielectric breakdown, ion beam<br>
sputtering, ultrasonic abrasive machining, cavitating fluid jet, laser evaporation;<br>
chemical methods such as selective application acid or base reaction, chemical photo<br>
etching; thermal methods such as melting using hot pins, laser machining, arc<br>
evaporation, ultrasonic melting or cavitation, microwave heating, and the like. These<br>
methods can optionally be employed to selectively remove shell material after first<br>
masking the area of shell intended to remain intact.<br>
It will be appreciated that many additional methods, including but not Limited<br>
to those in the broad categories of ablative, mechanical, chemical, thermal, or<br>
additive, though not specifically exemplified herein, are suitable for forming the<br>
openings in the shell of the present invention.<br>
For example, after exiting the film casting apparatus but before being fed to<br>
the enrobing apparatus, the film sheets may be subjected to a mechanical process such<br>
as punching, perforating, slitting, piercing, or drilling to form one or more openings in<br>
the film sheets. For instance, slits may be formed in the cast or extruded film by<br>
ablative, mechanical, chemical, thermal, or additive methods.<br>
The following non-limiting example further illustrates the invention.<br>
Total 603.2<br>
The active and excipients of Part I are weighed in the proportions provided<br>
and added to a bowl of a fluid bed granulator such as an AEROMATIC brand<br>
granulator. The granulating agent (Part II) is prepared by adding the purified water to<br>
a processing tank with approximately 15 grams of water for each gram of starch NF.<br>
The starch is mixed in slowly, and the mixture is heated until the temperature reaches<br>
about 82 to 84° C. With the components of Part I in a heated fluidized state and an<br>
inlet air temperature of 75 to 85° C, the granulating agent is sprayed onto the<br>
powders. After all the granulating agent has been sprayed, the granulated powders are<br>
dried to a moisture content of about 1.4 to 1.9% as determined by loss on drying using<br>
for example a COMPUTRAC brand analyzer. The dried granulation is then sieved,<br>
for example, using a GLATT QUICK brand sieve stator No. 3, screen No. 1.5 mm,<br>
1,000 RPM. The sieved and dried granulation is then blended with the powders of<br>
Part HI using a suitable mixer such as a twin shell, ribbon or planetary mixer. The<br>
finished blend is then loaded into the hopper of a rotary tableting machine and<br>
compressed into tablets using round deep concave tooling having a diameter oil/16<br>
inches. The average thickness of the resulting tablet cores is approximately 0.3 inches.<br>
The average hardness of the resulting tablet cores is approximately 10 Kp. The<br>
average tablet core weight is approximately 603.2 mg.<br>
Part B: Preparation of Shell Material as Cast Film for Enrobing:<br>
A first gelatin based cast film for enrobing the core of part A, having a<br>
thickness in the range of approximately 0.02 inches, is prepared from the following<br>
components:<br>
Gelatin (150 Bloom) 45%<br>
Glycerin 6%<br>
Sorbitol 2%<br>
Water 45%<br>
Colorants 2%<br>
The colorants are mixed with the water to form a homogenous soluiton. The<br>
dry gelatin granules are added to the colorant solution, and mixed for about 1 minute<br>
to completely wet the gelatin granules. The gelatin slurry is placed in a water bath<br>
and heated to 55°C to melt and dissolve the gelatin. The glycerin and sorbitol are<br>
then mixed in. The final solution is held at 55°C for approximately 10 hours to<br>
deaerate. The solution is then mixed at low speed until uniform (about 5 to 15<br>
minutes), and transferred to a jacketed feed tank equipped with a propeller-type<br>
electric mixer. The gelatin solution is maintained at 55°C with continuous mixing<br>
during its use for forming the cast film for making the first shell portion of the present<br>
invention. The gelatin solution is then poured onto a casting drum (forming roll<br>
1010), the surface of which is cooled to a temperature of approximately 25°C to form<br>
a cast film.<br>
A second gelatin based cast film having similar thickness, but a second color,<br>
is prepared by the method described above.<br>
The cooled first cast film is then fed between two rolls comprising a<br>
perforating apparatus (1030), which punches openings into the formed film. The<br>
openings are round, with a diameter of 750 microns, and are arranged in groups of 7,<br>
with one central opening encircled by 6 peripheral openings. The groups of 7<br>
openings are spaced in the film at intervals corresponding to the cavities in the dye<br>
rolls 1040. The cooled second cast film is fed between two rolls with smooth<br>
surfaces, thus remaining continuous with no openings therein.<br>
Next, the perforated first film and the non-perforated second film are fed<br>
between the dye rolls 1040, of an enrobing apparatus, together with the tablet cores of<br>
part A. The first and second films are pressed in contact with the tablet core, and with<br>
one another at an interface forming a seem around the belly band of the compressed<br>
tablet core. The resulting dosage form has a first shell portion of a first color, having<br>
openings therein, and a second shell portion of a second color, having substantially no<br>
openings therein.<br>
A dosage form containing at least one active ingredient, which<br>
comprises a core and a shell surrounding at least a portion of the<br>
core, wherein the core has a density of at least 0.9 g/cc, the shell<br>
comprises one or more openings, the shell is readily soluble in<br>
gastrointestinal fluids, and the dosage form provides for immediate<br>
release of at least one active ingredient upon contact of the dosage<br>
form with a liquid medium wherein the dosage form provides for<br>
immediate release of at least one active ingredient contained in the<br>
core which comprises a compressed tablet.</td>
