				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention in general relates to Multi Function Peripheral (MFP) devices. Further, this invention relates to scanning in computer networks. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method of group network scan.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
MFP supports various network application like scan to email, scan to FTP etc. One of such feature is network scan. Network scan feature allows user to scan the document and send it to PC connected to the network. In this feature, document would be scanned from MFP and sent to a single PC by using IP network.<br>
Figure 1 describes the blocks of related art and illustrates how it functions.<br>
There are following parts for the related art.<br>
1.	MFP the device with which scanner is attached.<br>
2.	NIC Network Interface Card which makes MFP network aware.<br>
3.	A Program is running at PC.<br>
There is no provision to send the scanned document to multiple PC. It means scanning is required to send to each PC.<br>
Figure 2 describes the flow for the related art. The following steps are followed in the related art:<br>
1.	Load the document in the Scanner.<br>
2.	Start Scanning.<br>
3.	Send the data to PC connected to the network.<br>
Related art functions in the manner given below: 1. Load the document in the scanner.<br>
'2. Start the scanning from the device or from the MFP.<br>
3.	Scanned data is sent to PC through IP network.<br>
4.	If Scanned image need to be sent to some more PC then repeat step 1 to 3 for all the PCs as shown in the drawing above.<br>
Scanning is required each time scanned data is to be sent to PC.<br>
As we have seen above, scanning is required each time scanned data to be transfer to PC. The weakness of the prior art can be shown below by an example: Suppose you have a scanned document which needs to be sending to 5 PC.<br>
&gt;	Approximate time of color scanning of single page at 200 dpi: 57 Sec<br>
&gt;	Approximate time of Data Transfer to PC for the page: 3 Sec<br>
&gt;	Total time for sending a single page by color scanning to 5 PC: (57 + 3) * 5 = 300 Sec<br>
So if we have 10 page document which need to be sent to 5 PC then Total Time = 3000 Sec i.e. 50 Minutes.<br>
It does not include the time which needed to start the job. We will see in coming sections how this would improve by this invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention will address the weakness in the related art. This invention will make it possible that scanned data can be sent to multiple PC over the network. By doing so, scanning time would be saved as scanning will happen only once and data would be transferred to many PC over the network. This would reduce scanning time. Scanning time is major contribution in total job time as we have seen in above example.<br>
This invention is a method of group network scan allowing user to scan the document and sent it to PC connected to the network comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	group login which tell MFP whom to send the scanned data;<br>
(b)	loading and scanning the document in the scanner;<br>
(c)	storing data till it is transferred to all PC's using buffers;<br>
(d)	encoding the data into buffer by Encoder module;<br>
(e)	group transfer of data in the group based on the said group login by group transfer module; and<br>
(f)	alerting and logging the information of the group.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings and the claims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiment is merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Figure 3 describes the blocks of current invention. It shows how it functions. Here scanned data can be sent to multiple PC over the network. Also there is need of scanning to happen only once.<br>
This functions in the manner given below:<br>
1.	Load the document in the scanner.<br>
2.	Start the scanning from the device or from the MFP.<br>
3.	Scanned data is sent to PC through IP network.<br>
4.	If Scanned image need to be sent to some more PC then a mechanism is devised to sent the same scanned data to all the PC's.<br>
Figure 4 shows the Flow Chart for Current Invention Function.<br>
The following steps need to be followed for the function mentioned in the invention:<br>
1.	Group Login: Group login will tell MFP whom to send the scanned data. Group can be entered manually also.<br>
2.	Load the document in the scanner.<br>
3.	Start Scanning.<br>
4.	Send the Data to all the PCs in the group. Data can be sent packet by packet to each client or page by page.<br>
Step 4 is new in this invention. Concept of group login also is new as far as network scanning is concerned.<br>
Figure 5 shows usage of two buffers in the present invention for a method to be introduced which will store the data till it is transferred to all PCs.<br>
There is following parts of the invention:<br>
1.	Group Transfer Handler Module at MFP<br>
2.	Extra Memory required for group network scan<br>
3.	Group Transfer Handler Module at NIC<br>
The structure of this invention can be defined in two ways:<br>
1.	Parts of the invention<br>
2.	Usage of the part<br>
Parts of the invention have been defined in the above section. Usage of the part is given below.<br>
Group Transfer Handler at MFP:<br>
The job for this module is as follows:<br>
1.	Inform NIC about group transfer.<br>
2.	Hold the data for the page till it is sent to all the member of group. Extra Memory required for group network scan<br>
Memory equivalent to two encoded page size is required in case of group network scan. This memory would be divided in two buffers as shown in figure 5. The use of this memory is to reduce the delay for scanner. Memory for one page size is still required in related art also so effective requirement is for one encoded page size memory i.e. around 1 MB.<br>
Group Transfer Handler at NIC:<br>
The job for this module is as follows:<br>
1.	NIC has to send data to each member of the group.<br>
2.	Do fine tuning with client<br>
This section will describe the operation of the invention. Whole operation can be divided into three parts.<br>
1.	Group formation<br>
2.	Alerts and Logging Information of Group<br>
3.	Group transfer of Data<br>
Group Formation:<br>
Group formation will be done at MFP. User can make a group by selecting entry for PC from the subscription table maintained by MFP. When a PC client for network scan subscribe to MFP he can chose not to be part of any group. An entry for each PC client for network scan would be made at MFP Data Base named Subscription Table. In that scenario that user would not be allowed to be a part of the group. Group information can be seen by a user. To authenticate, user should login into the system to access group related functionality. Only a valid user in subscription table can form the group. It means before forming a group user has to login into MFP. The information of group creator would be maintained at MFP.<br>
Alerts and Logging Information of Group:<br>
A group journal would be maintained for group information. This journal would contain name of the group and creator of the group and member of the group and their IP addresses. A journal for group transfer also would be maintained for logging information. This journal would make an entry for each group transfer. This will have name of the group and the result of transfer. If communication to any member if the group is failed then name of that member would be mentioned in the journal. An alert would be send to the pc client for network scan of group creator in case of communication failure of any member of the group. If failure occurs for group creator then no alerts would be sent to any client.<br>
Usage of extra memory required for group network scan<br>
So around 1 MB size of memory is required for group network scan. By using this extra memory we would have 2 buffers of 1 MB each for network scan. Usage of this memory would be as follows:<br>
Figure 6 shows usage of two buffers by Scanner Module. Scanner scans the data first. Then buffer 1 is checked for its availability. If it is available Encoder module encodes the data and stores the data into bufferl If more scanned data exist and the buffer 1 also gets filled encoder module checks for the availability of buffer 2. If it is available Encoder module encodes the data and stores the data into buffer2.lf more scanned data exist and the buffer 2 also gets filled encoder module checks for the availability of buffer 1 again. Initially while checking the availability.<br>
Figure 7 shows usage of two buffers by GTH module. Group Transfer Handler Module at MFP read data from buffers and sends it to the NIC. First the GTH module confirms if there is any data to be read. It checks for buffer 1 for any data to be read. If buffer contains data buffer 1 is read and data send to NIC. This is done till buffer 1 becomes empty. Then it checks for buffer 2 to be read or not. If buffer contains data buffer 2 is read and data send to NIC. This is done till buffer 2 becomes empty.<br>
For Bufferl:<br>
	Scanner scans the data.<br>
	Encoder module encodes the data and stores the data into bufferl (Figure 6)<br>
	Group Transfer Handler Module at MFP read data from buffer2 and sends it to the NIC. (Figure 7)<br>
For Buffer2:<br>
	Scanner scans the data.<br>
	Encoder module encodes the data and stores the data into buffer2. (Figure 6)<br>
	Group Transfer Handler Module at MFP read data from bufferl and sends it to the NIC. (Figure 7)<br>
So scanner continues scanning to one buffer when group transfer module is sending data to NIC from another buffer. So both buffers would be used in tandem.<br>
Group transfer of Data:<br>
Once group formation is completed, user can choose to do group transfer of scanned data. The following activity will be done for group transfer.<br>
1.	Scan the document<br>
2.	Encode the data<br>
3.	Store the data into extra memory for group network scan.<br>
4.	Send data to NIC from the memory for network scan.<br>
5.	NIC will transfer the data to each member of group one by one.<br>
6.	Step 4 and 5 will be repeated till the whole data is transferred to every member. This step will not be required if NIC can hold one page of data. In such case, NIC can receive full page of data and the transfer it to all the member of group.<br>
7.	Go to Step 1 if there are more documents to scan.<br>
