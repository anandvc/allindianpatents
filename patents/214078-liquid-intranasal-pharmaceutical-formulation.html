LIQUID INTRANASAL PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATION<br>
Description<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an intranasal pharmaceutical<br>
formulation containing a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of<br>
rotigotine. Such intranasal formulations are useful in the<br>
treatment of diseases where the administration of rotigotine<br>
is beneficial, in particular in the treatment of morbus<br>
Parkinson and other dopamine-related disorders.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
It is known that dopamine D2 agonists such as apomorphine or<br>
rotigotine may in principle be used to treat morbus Parkinson<br>
and other diseases for which an increase of the dopamine level<br>
is beneficial such as the restless leg syndrome (RLS).<br>
However, due to the very high first-pass effect of most of<br>
these dopamine agonists and the problem that many Parkinson<br>
patients develop some kind of drug tolerance against these<br>
drugs, the development of a safe and effective pharmaceutical<br>
formulation by which controlled amounts of drug can be<br>
administered is far from trivial.<br>
Rotigotine (5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-6-[propyl-[2-(2-<br>
thienyl)ethyl]amino]-1-naphthalenol, sometimes also designated<br>
as N-0923) and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts have been<br>
previously administered to patients mainly in the form of<br>
transdermal delivery systems (see e.g. WO 94/07468,.WO<br>
99/49852, EP-A-1 256 339). However, there was also at least<br>
one attempt of an intranasal administration of this drug<br>
(Swart et al., Pharmaceutical Sciences 1995, 1: 437-440).<br>
Swart et al. administered a solution of rotigotine<br>
hydrochloride in a 1:1 mixture of polyethylenglycol (PEG) 4 00<br>
and water to male Albino Wistar rats. While they observed an<br>
improved bioavailability of rotigotine after buccal, nasal or<br>
rectal administration compared with oral dosing in the rat,<br>
they also observed that the bioavailability for the nasal<br>
dosing was "somewhat disappointing" when compared with the<br>
results described for other lipophilic drugs. Swart et al.<br>
suggested that the relatively low bioavailability they<br>
observed may be explained by a low absorption or rapid<br>
metabolic conversion of the drug in the nasal mucosa. These<br>
authors further stated that as of 1995 no information was<br>
available about the influence of rotigotine on the ciliary<br>
function of the nasal mucosa. In their view, nasal medication<br>
may change or even destroy the epithelial cells, with the<br>
recovery taking a few hours to a few months depending on the<br>
agent (Van Donk et al. , Rhinology 18: 93-104).<br>
In view of this rather discouraging report, it is perhaps not<br>
very surprising that the nasal administration of rotigotine<br>
does not seem to have been further attempted in the years<br>
after 1995 until the present invention was made. The state of<br>
information on the influence of rotigotine on the ciliary<br>
function of the nasal mucosa remained basically unchanged<br>
since these days.<br>
US-A-2003-0,124,191 discloses a pharmaceutical composition in<br>
powder form that is intended for administration through the<br>
mucosa. A large variety of active ingredients including, among<br>
many others, rotigotine may be used as the active principle of<br>
this formulation which may further contain wetting agents,<br>
binding agents, diluents, penetration enhancers and other<br>
ingredients. The penetration enhancers of this reference<br>
include, among many others, cyclodextrins. The administration<br>
routes described in this application are again multifold and<br>
comprise administration through the buccal mucosa, the nasal<br>
mucosa, the vaginal mucosa and sublingual administration.<br>
However, this reference does not specifically disclose an<br>
intranasal formulation of rotigotine and provides no teaching<br>
as to requirements and the necessary/suitable ingredients of<br>
such an intranasal formulation.<br>
Apomorphine is a drug that shares certain functional features<br>
with rotigotine but is structurally different. Like<br>
rotigotine, apomorphine is a dopamine-. agonist and has<br>
therefore been used to treat various dopamine-related<br>
disorders, including morbus Parkinson. The nasal<br>
administration of apomorphine has also been tried. For<br>
example, WO 94/22445 describes pharmaceutical compositions for<br>
intranasal administration of. apomorphine, morphine and<br>
dihydroergotamine. These drugs can be used in combination with<br>
saccharides or higher sugar alcohols.<br>
J. Duarte et al. describe aspects of intranasal apomorphine in<br>
Parkinson"s Disease in J. Pharmacol. Technol. 11:226-228<br>
(1995) . This report states on the one hand that intranasal<br>
administration of apomorphine is a comfortable and effective<br>
alternative to subcutaneous administration but on the other<br>
hand also mentions that one patient developed a nasal<br>
vestibulitis ("troublesome rhinitis") during chemical trials.<br>
While this patient could continue apomorphine therapy, doubts<br>
do remain of the general suitability of this therapy form when<br>
account is taken of the fact that only four patients<br>
participated in this study. A very similar report on such side<br>
effects is given in Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd 1992; 136, nr 14,<br>
p.702. The authors of this reference suspect that apomorphine<br>
may bind as a hapten to proteins in the nasal mucosa and thus<br>
evoke an allergic reaction. Thus, even in the case of<br>
apomorphine, the problem of finding a safe (non-allergenic)<br>
and effective intranasal medication cannot be considered as<br>
having been solved satisfactorily.<br>
More recently, the same findings with liquid intranasal<br>
formulations of apomorphine were confirmed again by Djupesland<br>
et al. in PFO Magazine, June/July 2002. These authors stated<br>
that while administration of liquid intranasal apomorphine has<br>
been shown to be effective in Parkinson"s Disease, local side<br>
effects in the form of nasal crusting, inflammation and<br>
infection have been evident. In addition apomorphine was found<br>
to be subject to rapid oxidation in solution. To overcome<br>
these problems, a nasal-powder approach was developed.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
The overriding objective of this invention is the development<br>
of a liquid intranasal formulation of rotigotine salts that is<br>
stable, safe and effective. Aspects of the desired stability<br>
include an acceptable oxidative stability and a good<br>
temperature stability. Aspects of formulation safety include,<br>
inter alia, no detectable microbiological contamination while<br>
retaining the possibility to avoid potentially irritating<br>
preservatives such as ethanol or benzalkonium chloride, even<br>
though such preservatives can be added according to necessity.<br>
However, in a preferred aspect of the present invention the<br>
intranasal formulation is free of any preservatives yet<br>
remains antibacterially active. Further aspects of safety<br>
include low irritation of the nasal mucosa and avoidance of<br>
nasal vestibulitis. Aspects of formulation efficacy include<br>
the possibility of administering sufficient quantities of<br>
rotigotine to a human subject suffering from Parkinson"s<br>
Disease to achieve (a) a rotigotine plasma level in the order<br>
of at least 100 pg/ml and (b) a measurable improvement of the<br>
symptoms of Parkinson"s Disease of at least 2 units in the<br>
Unified Parkinson"s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) compared to a<br>
placebo treatment. In the context of this application,<br>
"placebo treatment" refers to a treatment with an intranasal<br>
composition of identical qualitative composition but where the<br>
active ingredient has been omitted.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Surprisingly it-has been found that the above objectives could<br>
be obtained with a liquid intranasal pharmaceutical<br>
formulation comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable acid<br>
addition salt of rotigotine and a-cyclodextrin. The most<br>
preferred pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt of<br>
rotigotine is the hydrochloride. Further pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable acid addition salts that could be used include the<br>
urotrate, tartrate, citrate, phosphate, sulphate and the<br>
methanesulfonate. Additional preferred-aspects of intranasal<br>
formulations according to the present invention are given in<br>
the appending dependent claims and in the following detailed<br>
description.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
According to preferred aspects of the present invention said<br>
liquid intranasal formulation further contains buffer salts,<br>
e.g. phosphates or acetates, and as such may be present as a<br>
buffered aqueous solution. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
intranasal formulation contains phosphate buffered saline<br>
(PBS) as buffer system.<br>
The intranasal formulation according to the present invention<br>
may preferably further contain a viscosity-enhancing<br>
substance. Glycerol and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) are<br>
particularly useful as viscosity enhancers, but the present<br>
invention is not limited thereto. Glycerol is particularly<br>
preferred as it also has a soothing effect on the nasal<br>
mucosa. The viscosity of the intranasal formulations of the<br>
present invention should preferably be between 0.8 and 1.5<br>
mm2/s,. most preferably around 1.2 mm2/s. The viscosity can be<br>
determined by an Ubbelohde capillary viscosimeter with<br>
suspending ball-level for the determination of kinematic<br>
viscosity according to DIN 51562, part 1. Moreover, glycerol<br>
in the formulation surprisingly serves to increase the uptake<br>
of rotigotine through the nasal mucosa as was shown by in-<br>
vitro permeation assays with nasal mucosa from freshly<br>
slaughtered cattle.<br>
The pH-value of the formulation of the present invention<br>
should preferably in the range of 4.5 to 6.5, more preferably<br>
around 5.8 ± 0.3. The pH value of 5.8 leads to an optimal drug<br>
uptake as was revealed by in-vitro permeation assays.<br>
Surprisingly, a higher pH value of 6.5 as well as a lower pH<br>
value of 4.5 in the formulation resulted in a significantly<br>
lower rotigotine uptake through nasal mucosa tissue from<br>
freshly slaughtered cattle. The pH varlue of the intranasal<br>
formulation can be adjusted during or after its preparation<br>
with a pharroaceutically acceptable acid or base. Most<br>
preferably, citric acid is used for this purpose.<br>
In a preferred aspect of the present invention the intranasal<br>
formulation does not contain a further absorption enhancer,<br>
preservative and/or antioxidant. While such agents are<br>
commonly used in many commercial intranasal preparations, the<br>
formulation of the present invention can do without them<br>
without sacrificing safety and efficacy, or even improve<br>
safety and efficacy by omitting such agents.<br>
Nevertheless, according to a less preferred aspect of the<br>
invention, it is also possible that the intranasal formulation<br>
contains further absorption enhancers. Such enhancers can<br>
suitably be selected from surfactants and/or emulsifiers,<br>
particularly non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN 80® or<br>
cremophor RH40®. As an antioxidant, the formulation may<br>
contain e.g. ascorbates or sorbates. Known preservatives that<br>
may, but do not need to be used in the formulation include<br>
antimicrobial substances such benzalkonium chloride. It is one<br>
of the particularly advantageous and surprising features of<br>
the formulation according to the present invention that such<br>
antimicrobial preservatives are not needed, thus in a further<br>
aspect the present invention relates to an intranasal<br>
formulation as defined above that is free of preservatives.<br>
The absence of preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride<br>
provides an additional advantage because this agent shows a<br>
significant ciliary toxicity. Experiments conducted by the<br>
applicant show that even a formulation according to the<br>
invention that is free from preservatives shows no microbial<br>
contamination and satisfies the standards for topical<br>
formulations according to Ph. Eur., 4 Ed.<br>
a-Cyclodextrin is a particularly important component of the<br>
present invention. The inventors have discovered that,<br>
unexpectedly, a-cycl,odextrin markedly increases the storage<br>
stability of the intranasal formulation, even when compared to<br>
ß-cyclodextrin. Moreover, a-cyclodextrin seems to have a much<br>
better solubility-enhancing effect on rotigotine hydrochloride<br>
than ß-cyclodextrin. The concentration of a-cyclodextrin in<br>
solution does not need to be higher than 0.5 g/ml and is<br>
preferably in the range of 0.001 - 0.1 g/ml, more preferably<br>
between 0.05 and 0.1 g/ml and most preferably 0.05 -<br>
0.085 g/ml.<br>
Cyclodextrins per se, among many other agents, have been<br>
proposed for nasal drug delivery before, see e.g. Merkus et al<br>
in Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 36 (1999) 41-57. However,<br>
the review of Merkus does not specifically address rotigotine<br>
and, on the whole, rather seems to prefer ß-cyclodextrins and<br>
particularly methylated ß-cyclodextrins. The article further<br>
notes large interspecies differences and cautions against<br>
blindly transferring the results of rat studies to humans.<br>
The intranasal formulation according to a preferred aspect of<br>
the present invention may contain 1-6 mg/ml rotigotine-HCl<br>
in an aqueous buffered solution. According to a further and<br>
independent aspect of the present invention, the intranasal<br>
formulation contains between 0.03 and 0.1 g/ml a-cyclodextrin<br>
in the solution.<br>
Particularly preferred intranasal formulations according to<br>
the present invention consist of 2 - 5 mg/ml rotigotine-HCl,<br>
0.05 - 0.1 g/ml a-cyclodextrin and 2.2-3 vol.% glycerol in<br>
an aqueous buffer, such as phosphate buffered saline (PBS).<br>
Examples<br>
The following examples are to illustrate the invention without<br>
limiting it. All parts and percentages are volume-based unless<br>
indicated otherwise.<br>
Example 1<br>
The following intranasal formulation according to the present<br>
invention was prepared:<br>
2.5 g/L Rotigotine-HCl<br>
85 g/L a-Cyclodextrin<br>
8 g/L NaCl<br>
0.2 g/L KC1<br>
1.44 g/L Na2HPO4x2H2O<br>
0.2 g/L KH2PO4<br>
31.2 g/L Glycerol (87 % solution in water)<br>
water to add up to final volume<br>
citric acid for pH adjustment<br>
pH of solution 5.8<br>
610 ml water was adjusted to pH 3 with citric acid and alpha-<br>
cyclodextrin, glycerol and rotigotine hydrochloride were added<br>
to give a concentration of 85 mg/ml, 2.6 vol. % and 2.5 mg/ml<br>
respectively. Subsequently, 250 ml of 4xPBS buffer solution<br>
(having four times the concentration of standard PBS buffer<br>
solution, i.e. a" concentration of 32 g/1 NaCl, 0.8 g/1 KC1,<br>
5.76 g/1 Na2HPO4 x 2 H2O and 0.8 g/1 KH2PO4 in water) was<br>
added, followed by drop wise addition of 1 M citric acid until<br>
a pH of 5.8 was reached. Water was used to fill up to a final<br>
volume of 1000 ml.<br>
The obtained solution was filtered through 0.22 urn PES filter.<br>
The solution may be filled in suitable pharmaceutical<br>
containers, e.g. dark vials of 8 ml. volume, and is ready for<br>
intranasal administration to mammals, including man.<br>
Example 2<br>
The (maximum) solubility of rotigotine-HCl in aqueous solution<br>
at room temperature (20 °C) can be significantly improved by<br>
the use of a-cyclodextrin (a-CD) while there is no significant,<br>
increase in rotigotine solubility when ß-cyclodextrin is used.<br>
For cyclodextrin concentrations which are close to the maximum<br>
solubility of each of the two CD types, 5.03 mg/mL rotigotine-<br>
HCl could be dissolved in an 0.1 g/mL a-CD solution but only<br>
1.57 mg/mL could be dissolved in a 0.015 g/mL ß-CD solution.<br>
The concentration was determined by isocratic HPLC analysis.<br>
HPLC column LiChroCART 75x4 mm, Superspher 60 RP-select B 5 µm<br>
(Merck), column temperature: 30°C, mobile phase:<br>
water/acetonitrile/methane sulfonic acid (65/35/0.05 v/v/v) ,<br>
flow rate: 2 mL/min, injection volume: 50 µl, detection at 22 0<br>
nm, retention time approx. 1. 5 min. The concentration was<br>
determined by use of an external reference solution with known<br>
concentration.<br>
The results are shown in the following table 1:<br>
* = exceeds maximum ß-CD solubility in the solution tested<br>
Very surprisingly, it was shown that the solubility of<br>
rotigotine hydrochloride is increased five-fold by adding 0.1<br>
g/ml a-cyclodextrin (a-CD) whereas the maximum solubility-<br>
enhancing effect of ß-CD was only very moderate (factor 1.6).<br>
Rotigotine base is practically insoluble both in aqueous<br>
solution and in aqueous solutions containing a- or ß-<br>
cyclodextrin. The full beneficial effects of the present<br>
invention can therefore only be obtained by using a-<br>
cyclodextrin. This effect was surprising and unpredictable on<br>
the basis of the available data on rotigotine.<br>
Example 3<br>
To evaluate the storage stability of potential nasal<br>
formulations of rotigotine hydrochloride the following<br>
formulations were prepared:<br>
Formulation sample A (comparative example):<br>
2.5 g/L Rotigotine-HCl<br>
0.5 % (v/v) Tween 80<br>
8 g/L NaCl<br>
0.2 g/L KC1<br>
1.44 g/L Na2HPo4x2H2o<br>
0.2 g/L KH2PO4<br>
water to add up to final volume<br>
citric acid for pH adjustment, pH 5.8<br>
470 ml water were adjusted to pH 3 with citric acid and Tween<br>
80 and rotigotine hydrochloride were added to give a<br>
concentration of 0.5 vol. % and 2,5 mg/ml respectively.<br>
Subsequently, 200 ml of 4x PBS buffer solution was added,<br>
followed by drop wise addition of 1 M citric acid until a pH<br>
of 5.8 was reached. Water was used to fill up to a final<br>
volume of 8 00 ml.<br>
Formulation sample B (inventive formulation) :<br>
2.5 g/L Rotigotine-HCl<br>
85 g/L a-Cyclodextrin<br>
8 g/L NaCl<br>
0.2 g/L KC1<br>
1.44 g/L Na2HPO4x2H2O<br>
0.2 g/L KH2PO4<br>
water to add up to final volume<br>
citric acid for pH adjustment, pH 5.8<br>
470 ml water was adjusted to pH 3 with citric acid and a-<br>
cyclodextrin and rotigotine hydrochloride were added to give a<br>
concentration of 85 mg/ml and 2.5 mg/ml respectively.<br>
Subsequently, 200 ml of 4xPBS buffer solution were added,<br>
followed by drop wise addition of 1 M citric acid until a pH<br>
of 5.8 was reached. Water was used to fill up to a final<br>
volume of 800 ml.<br>
The stability was determined by measuring the concentration of<br>
rotigotine over time using gradient HPLC analysis.<br>
HPLC column: Licrospher 100 CN, 5 urn, 125 x 4.6 mm (Bidhoff),<br>
pre column filter: 2 urn, mobile phase A: water/methane<br>
sulfonic acid (1000/0.5 (v/v) ) , mobile phase B:<br>
acetonitrile/methane sulfonic acid 1000/0.5 (v/v)), flow rate<br>
1.0 mL/min, profile of the gradient: 0 min 95%A/5%B;2<br>
min 95 % A / 5 % B; 35 min 40 % A / 60 % B; 38 min 40 % A / 60<br>
% B; 39 min 95 % A / 5 % B; initial pressure approx. 90 bar,<br>
injection volume 80 µl, detection at -220 nm and 272 nm,<br>
retention time approx. 18 min. All peaks in the chromatogram<br>
with an area &gt; 0.05 % were integrated up to a retention time<br>
of 35 minutes to calculate the purity of the drug substance.<br>
The relative purity is used to calculate the degradation of<br>
Rotigotine hydrochloride. The results are shown in Table 2.<br>
* These values reflect the loss in rotigotine absorption<br>
between the start values and the actual test points at the<br>
given conditions.<br>
** The apparent increase in purity can be explained by the<br>
measurement accuracy of the analytical method. The result<br>
should be interpreted as no significant change in purity<br>
relative to the starting value at t=0.<br>
It is readily apparent from Table 2 that a-cyclodextrin<br>
(sample B) markedly increased stability of rotigotine<br>
hydrochloride as compared to the Tween 80 formulation (sample<br>
A) . The stabilizing effect of a-cyclodextrin becomes also<br>
apparent from a comparative test in an aqueous rotigotine<br>
solution. Following storage at 60°C for 8 weeks, a rotigotine<br>
solution of 1.6 mg/ml with a-cyclodextrin showed a decrease in<br>
the rotigotine concentration of -0.07 mg/ml, whilst a solution<br>
of 1.9 mg/ml of rotigotine without a-cyclodextrin showed a<br>
decrease of -0.22 mg/ml.<br>
Example 4<br>
2.5 g/L Rotigotine-HCl<br>
50 g/L a-Cyclodextrin<br>
4 g/L NaCl<br>
0.1 g/L KC1<br>
0.72 g/L Na2HPO4x2H2O<br>
0.1 g/L KH2PO4<br>
31.2 g/L Glycerol (87% solution in water)<br>
470 ml water was adjusted to pH 3 with citric acid and a-<br>
cyclodextrin, glycerol and rotigotine hydrochloride were added<br>
to give a concentration of 50 mg/ml and 2.5 mg/ml,<br>
respectively.<br>
Subsequently, 200 ml of 2xPBS buffer solution were added,<br>
