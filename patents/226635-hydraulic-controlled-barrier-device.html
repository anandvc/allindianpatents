				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>1 have invented 1-xing barrier, depend upon hydraulic pressure, in which boom of barrier divided in two parts, one of it called short arm and second called long arm. In normal position if the boom is fixed on axis, the long arm goes downward. So it would be balanced by weight (made of cast iron) putting on short arm. Then for upward position of long arm, 10 to 20 kg. excess wt. puts on short arm. The short arm connected with knob of piston of cylinder C2 which is controlled by hydraulic pressure of cylinder Cl, because knob of piston of cylinder Cl is fixed with a lever and lever displaced by muscular force of human. If the knob of piston of cylinder Cl is displaced ] cm. by muscular force hydraulic pressure works on cylinder C2 and knob of cylinder C2 goes upward by 2 cm, as well as short arm goes upward, show the long arm goes downward. Just reverse of it, boom of barrier goes upward. &quot;So cause of hydraulic pressure a large cylinder connecting through pipe with a small cylinder and connected with striking rod on specific angle with short arm of boom. Which boom is divided by axis in two parts that is short arm &amp; long arm. When hydraulic pressure given through large cylinder. The long arm of boom works as a level crossing on road, rail etc. is a new invented idea. &quot;</td>

				<td>The invention relates to a hydraulic controlled barrier. It seeks to provide a more efficient alternative to various kind of 1-Xing barriers - operated manually, mechanically or through computerized electronics.<br>
The barrier currently in use are either wholly mechanically operated and manually powered or powered by slow speed electric motors operated manually or automatic. The proposed invention offers a barrier which is hydraulic controlled, manually operated but uses only nominal human strength.<br>
Disadvantages of Prior Art:<br>
Disadvantages in the system under current usage are unavoidable. They need more muscular power and time. Moreover the down ward movement of the boom is often uncontrolled and terminate with a thud. Backup batteries and chargers are to be maintained and considerable mechanical maintenance is required to ensure smooth functioning of the system. The disadvantages and difficulties are evident and there is a clear need for improvement.<br>
Accordingly, a primary object of this invention is to present hydraulic controlled barrier which uses hydraulic power in place of muscular strength.<br>
Another object of this invention s to propose to minimize the physical load upon the crossing operator.<br>
Next object of this invention is to propose manually operated hydraulic controlled barrier is to save time regarding its operation<br>
A further object of this invention is to propose manually operated hydraulic controlled barrier is to control the downward movement of the boom and to eliminate the thud and present invention fulfill its objective.<br>
Still further object of this invention is to propose manually operated hydraulic controlled barrier is maintenance free up to long time.<br>
Yet a further object of this invention is to propose manually operated hydraulic controlled barrier free from payment of electricity -or working of barrier.<br>
Finally the present invention succeeds in presenting a cost efficient, time efficient and energy efficient alternative to the barriers currently in use. Present invention is as :<br>
Statement of Invention :<br>
A Hydraulic controlled barrier comprising : small diameter single acting cylinder (25) and large diameter single acting cylinder (23) of volume proportion 1: 4 being attached with each other<br>
through a pipe (24): said pipe being filled with conventional hydraulic oil; knob (26) of piston of said large diameter single acting cylinder being hinged with a lever (20) and the knob of piston of said smaller diameter single acting cylinder being coupled to the short arm of boom; which provides angular movement of the said boom or barrier in accordance with the<br>
reciprocating motion of the oil inside the two cylinders.<br>
Description with the accompanying drawings -<br>
Further   object   and   advantages   of   this   invention   shall   become   manifest   with accompanying drawing and description where in :<br>
1.	Fig. 1 - Shows complete hydraulic controlled barrier.<br>
2.	Fig. 2 to 11 - Shows parts of hydraulic controlled barrier i.e.<br>
Fig. (2) Stand (I &amp; II). Fig. (3) 8 and (III), Fig. (4) Lever-pivot, Fig. (5) Shaft Fig.(6) Gripper plate. Fig (7) Slot plate, Fig. (8 &amp; 9) Tie- rod Arrangement, Fig. (10 &amp; 11) Signal Arrangement.<br>
3.	Fig. (12) Shows attachment of Hydnulic Cylinders with lever and boom.<br>
Detailed description with drawings -<br>
Further description and specifications of parts of hydraulic controlled barrier are given with reference of Figs. &amp; Nos . These specification given are for a single boom barrier across a six meter wide road .<br>
The two stands (Fig. 2) which are used for barrier construction are made of M/S angle iron - ISA 75x75x5 mm.(l). The height of these stands is 1 mtr. Other members of stand are welded as per drawing. These stands are fixed on centre line by welding, on a 10 mm. thick base plate of M/S of size 20x45 cm (2), wt. 84.60 Kg. / m2. And from the base of stands, a channel (3) of ISLC 75x40 welded on 80 cm height and two angle iron (1) crossing another of same specification are welded below it. There are four holes (4)   in M/S base plate (2) at the comer The 90 cm. long 18 mm. dia bolts along with the foundation are fixed tight in these holes. These bolts have 15 cm. threading with 2 nuts each. Now on 80 cm. height of stands on ISLC a bearing no. 6208 (5) is attached. A third stand (Fig. 3) of 1.2 meter, height is fixed just below the long arm (16) of the boom and 6 mtr. far from the two stands. The top of the stand is made of a  15 Cm. deep half circle upon which the boom would rest The shaft (Fig. 5) is made of hard steel 15 cm. dia with 7.5 cm. deep half round cut(12) made in middle, and a long hole c/c for a locking bolt. A gripper plate (44) (Fig. 6) ties the boom with 4 bolts.<br>
The 8 mtr. long boom (Fig. 1). is made of 3 pieces of pipe seamlessly welded to each<br>
other pipe I is 3 mtr. long M/S pipe (7) of 80 mm O/D &amp; pipe II is 3 mtr. long M/S pipe (8) of<br>
100 mm. O/D &amp; pipe 111 is 2 mtr. long M/S pipe (9) of 110 O/D. For 6 mtr. wide road barrier.<br>
the long arm of boom is of 6.5 mtr. and the short arm is of 1.5 mtr. At the end of the long arm. a<br>
round hook of 10 mm. dia of 7.5 cm. circle is welded<br>
The boom is strengthened by two adjustable support wire (18. 19) (Fig. 8 &amp; 9) as shown in drawing. A cast iron counter weight (13) is attached to the short arm of the boom.<br>
Figure 1 &amp; 12 show the attachment of hydraulic cylinder one with operating lever &amp; the other t\\o the boom. Hydraulic pressure is created by operating a type-2 lever (Fig. 4) (or a gear pump) made of 30x5 mm. thick M/S flat &amp;  160 cm. long. The top of the lever is made thicker to ensure an easy grip (21) of 20 mm. dia. The lever is pivoted (22) at the bottom( pipe bore 30mm). A slotted plate (31) (Fig. 7). of mild steel with 10 mm. dia with an adjustable bolt (30) of 15 to 20 cm length is attached a little below the grip handle.<br>
The figure shows two hydraulic cylinders the bigger one is single acting hydraulic cylinder (23). which is made of seamless steal barrel and piston (32) of fine grained Aluminum with 2 rings of same size &amp; 300mm. piston  (26) of 16mm dia made of medium carbon steel. The gland is made leak proof with a rubber seal (33). It supports the piston rod at one side. A hole of 6 mm. with bolt (34) is made in the barrel to fill oil in the cylinder. The cylinder is strongly fixed to a concrete block by grouting the hole-passes (35) attached or welded to the cylinder. The piston rod is attached (45) to the operating at the height 30 cm from top of pivot. From this cylinder a pipe line of 4 mm. dia carrying oil runs to the cylinder (25) attached to the boom. The smaller cylinder(25) | specifications- size of barrel (25) is 40 mm. bore with accurate size of piston &amp; rings and 500 mm long piston rod (27) of 12 mm. dia of hard steel is fixed at one end to a pivot ( 50 cms high from earth is between the two stands on the small arm side). The cylinder is pivoted at one end either upon bearing or a bush (29). The piston rod (27) is similarly attached to the short arm of the boom 60-75 cms away from the axis (28).<br>
The boom is locked by hydraulically operated disc break (37) like arrangement (Fig. 1) as shown in drawing.<br>
Fight signal arrangement is easily attachable as shown in drawing (Fig. 10 &amp; 11).<br><br><br><br><br>
