				<td>The invention relates to shaving systems having handles and replaceable cartridges<br>
Shaving systems often consist of a handle and a replaceable cartridge in which one or more blades are mounted in a plastic housing  After the blades in a cartridge have become dull from use, the cartridge is discarded, and replaced on the handle with a new cartridge In some shaving systems the blades are resiliently mounted with respect to the cartridge housing and deflect under the force of skin contact during shaving  In some shaving systems the connection of the cartridge to the handle provides a pivotal mounting of the cartridge with respect to the handle so that the cartridge angle adjusts to follow the contours of the surface being shaved  In such systems, the cartridge can be biased toward an at rest position by the action of a spring-biased plunger (a cam follower) carried on the handle against a cam surface on the cartridge housing<br>
In one aspect, the invention features, in general, a replaceable razor blade cartridge that includes a blade unit and cartridge connecting structure for connecting the blade unit to a handle  The cartridge connecting structure has inwardly directed surfaces that partially define a handle-receiving region and mate with outwardly directed surfaces on handle connecting structure of the handle  The cartridge connecting structure also has a connection entrance to the<br>
handle-receiving region and a projection that extends into the handle-receiving region  The projection has a blocking surface facing the opposite direction from the connection entrance to retain the handle connecting structure on' the cartridge connecting structure<br>
In another aspect, the invention features, in general, a replaceable razor blade cartridge that includes a blade unit that is pivotally connected to a cartridge connecting structure that includes a latching member that is movable to release the cartridge from a handle<br>
In another aspect, the invention features, in general, a replaceable razor blade cartridge that includes a blade unit and a cartridge connecting structure for connecting and disconnecting the blade unit to a handle by movement along a connection axis  The cartridge connecting structure includes a latching member that is movable to release the cartridge from the handle prior to retraction of the cartridge connecting structure from the handle along the connection axis<br>
Certain implementations of the invention include one or more of the following features  In certain implementations the latching member includes a projection with a blocking surface that blocks retraction of the handle connecting structure from the cartridge connecting structure when in a latched position and permits retraction of the handle connecting structure from the cartridge connecting structure when in an unlatched position  The latching member includes engagement structure that is movable from an initial position to a deflected position, the blocking surface moving from the latched position to the unlatched position as the engagement structure is moved from the initial position to the deflected position  The projection is movable generally along a deflection axis that is<br>
transverse to the connection axis, and the projection has a camming surface on the opposite side of the deflection axis from the blocking surface, the camming surface making a larger angle with the deflection axis than the blocking surface  The latching member includes a cantilevered beam structure with a base region and an unsupported end, the projection is closer to the base region than the engagement structure, and the engagement structure is closer to the free end than the blocking surface<br>
The handle connecting structure of the handle has an ejector that is extendible from the handle, and the engagement structure is aligned with the ejector  The engagement structure is on the unsupported end of the cantilever structure, and the unsupported end is bent such that the projection is deflected in a transverse direction from the ejector movement when the engagement structure is engaged by the ejector  The angle of the blocking surface with the deflection axis is between 0° and 10°  and the angle of the camming surface with the deflection axis is between 30° and 60°   There are two projections, and two bent ends engaged by the ejector  There are two slots separating the cantilevered beam structure from adjacent portions of the cartridge connecting structure  There are two grooves extending from the two slots at the base region Sections in planes transverse to the connection axis through the inwardly directed surfaces and the mating outwardly directed surfaces have asymmetrical shapes to promote proper alignment during connection<br>
In another aspect, the invention features, in general, shaving razors including cartridges as have already been described and handles connected to the cartridges<br>
In another aspect, the invention features, in general, methods of connecting replaceable shaving<br>
cartridges as have already been described to handles and disconnecting the cartridges from the handles by moving latching members to release the cartridges from the handles<br>

Fig  3 is a partial sectional view, taken at 3-3 of Fig  6, of a cartridge connecting structure of the Fig 2 replaceable cartridge<br>
Fig  4 is a partial sectional view of a handle connecting structure of the Fig 2 handle<br>
Fig  5 is a partial elevation of the Fig  3 cartridge connecting structure<br>
Fig  6 is a partial sectional view, taken at 6-6 of Fig  5, of the Fig  3 cartridge connecting structure<br>
Figs  7-11 are diagrammatic partial sectional views of portions of the Fig  3 cartridge connecting structure and portions of the Fig  4 handle connecting structure at different times during connection and disconnection<br>
Referring to Figs  1 and 2, shaving razor 10 includes handle 12 and replaceable shaving cartridge 14  As shown in Fig 2, cartridge 14 is removable from handle 12 Cartridge 14 includes blade unit 16, which carries three spring-biased blades 18, guard 2 0 and cap 22   Cartridge 14 also includes interconnect member 24 on which blade unit 16 is pivotally mounted  Interconnect member 24 includes base 27, which removably and fixedly attaches to asymmetrical extension 26 on handle 12, and two arms 28 that pivotally support blade unit 16 at its two sides  Base 27 acts as a cartridge connecting structure, and extension 26 acts as a handle connecting structure  These two structures connect to each other to connect a replaceable cartridge 14 to handle 12   Spring biased plunger 45 extends from extension 26, passes through an opening at the top of base 2 7 and acts against cam surface 3 0 on blade unit 16, causing it to have a forward-biased at-rest orientation, as is discussed in detail in the above-referenced application, which is hereby incorporated by reference<br>
Referring to Figs  3 and 4, base 27 has handle-receiving region 32 that is partially defined by inwardly directed surfaces 34   Connection entrance 3 6 provides access to handle-receiving region 32   Inwardly directed surfaces 34 mate with outwardly directed surfaces 3 8 on extension 26 of handle 12  Base 27 also has an angled recess region 4 0 for receiving angled surface 42 on handle 12<br>
Referring to Figs  3, 5 and 6, base 27 has latching member 44 formed in the bottom wall 46 thereof  As shown in Figs  3 and 6, latching member 44 has a cantilevered beam structure, and is connected to bottom wall 46 at base region 48 near the ends of slots 50   Latching member 44 tends to<br>
pivot about axis 52 (Fig  6) upon being subjected to a force with a outward component at the free end at engagement members 54 (l e , to the left along connection axis 76 in Fig  3)   Bottom wall 46 also has grooves 56 (Figs 3',   6) extending backward from slots 50 to promote pivoting of latching member 44<br>
Two projections 58 (Figs  3, 5, 6) extend upward from latching member 44 for interacting with depressions 60 formed in the lower surface of extension 2 6 of handle 12 (Fig 4)   Each projection has a front blocking surface 62, a top surface 64, and an angled camming surface 66, which makes about a 45° angle with connection axis 76 along which extension 26 moves during connection to and retraction from base 27  Other angles, e g , between 30° and 60° could also be used  Depressions 60 similarly have front surfaces 68 for interacting with front blocking surface 62, top surface 70 and rear angled surface 72 for receiving top surface 64 and camming surface 66, respectively, of projections 58 Front blocking surface 62 of projection 58 makes about a 90° angle with connection axis 76<br>
Referring to Fig 4, ejector 79 is slidably mounted within recess 81 within the handle connecting structure of handle 12   It is shown at an at-rest position m Fig  4, and can be moved forward slightly by activating button 80 on handle 12   (See Figs  2 and 9-11 )  Referring to Figs  9-11, button 80 has a lower extension 82 that sits within opening 84 of ejector 79   Moving button 80 forward relative to extension 2 6 on which is it mounted (I e , to the left in Fig  9) causes ejector 79 to be moved forward from the position of Fig  9 to the position of Figs  10 and 11   Fig 11 shows the front of extension 82 against stop surface 86 of extension 26<br>
Figs  7-11 are sectional views showing the components of handle 12 and cartridge 14 that interact during connection and disconnection of cartridge 14 to handle 12   The components of the handle connecting structure shown in these figures are part of a subassembly that includes extension 26, the rest of the subassembly is received within handle 12 and thus is not seen in Fig  2<br>
Referring to Fig  7, extension 26 of handle 12 is shown being advanced along connection axis 76 in the insertion direction I indicated by the arrow  It is seen that extension 26 fits within handle-receiving region 32 of base 27  As shown in Fig  7, button 80 is in an at-rest position, and lower sloping front surface 90 of extension 26 is about to contact camming surface 66 of projection 58<br>
Referring to Fig  8, as extension 26 of handle 12 is moved further m the insertion direction indicated by arrow I, sloping surface 90 of extension 26 rides over camming surface 66, causing latch member 44 and in particular projection 58 thereon to move downward along the deflection axis indicated by arrow D, which is substantially perpendicular to connection axis 76 and the direction of insertion I   The action of sloping surface 90 on camming surface 66 causes latching member 44 to bend generally about axis 52 in the base region   (See Figs  6 and 8 )  In the position shown in Fig  8, the lowest portion of sloping surface 90 is shown riding on top of top surface 64 of projection 58   Owing to sloping surface 90 and camming surface 66, relatively minor connection forces are needed to deflect latching member 44 and to connect cartridge 14 to handle 12<br>
Referring to Fig  9 , extension 26 of handle 12 is shown in the position in which it is connected to base 2 7 of cartridge 14   Sloping surface 90 has advanced past<br>
projection 58, and latching member 44 has moved up to the latched position in which projection 58 has snapped up into depression 60 of extension 26   In this position cartridge 14 is securely attached to handle 12 with little likelihood of unintended detachment during use owing to interference of surface 68 on handle 12 and blocking surface 62 on cartridge 14   Surfaces 62 and 68 are substantially perpendicular to axis 76 along which extension 2 6 needs to be moved relative to base 27 to disconnect the two  Thus very large forces along axis 76 would need to be exerted to disconnect cartridge 14 from handle 12 if one does not first unlatch latching member 44<br>
Referring to Fig  10, when the user wishes to disconnect cartridge 14 from handle 12, button 80 is moved relative to extension 2 6 m the unlatched direction indicated by arrow U on Fig  10, and this causes ejector 79 to be moved along axis 76 m the ejection direction indicated by arrow E  Ejector 79 pushes engagement members 54 outward, causing projection 58 to move downward in the deflection direction indicated by arrow D as latching member 44 bends at axis 52 at base region 4 8   This downward movement causes projection 58 to clear depression 60 and to release extension 26 from latching member 44 so that extension 26 moves relative to base 27 in the retraction direction indicated by arrow R  As shown in Fig  10, extension 82 of button 80 has moved forward from the position shown in Fig  9<br>
In Fig  11, button 80 has moved further forward, and extension 82 is against stop surface 86   Extension 26 has moved further in the retraction direction R such that the front sloping surface 90 is riding down camming surface 66 As extension 26 continues to be retracted from base 27, ejector 79 will eventual move backward from engagement<br>
members 54, permitting latching member 44 to move back to the at rest disconnected position shown in Fig  7<br>
Other embodiments of the invention are within the scope of the appended claims  For example, blocking surface 62 and/or facing surface 68 of extension 2 6 could be at slightly less than 90° (e g , between 80° and 90°) with respect to connection axis 76 to permit base 27 to disconnect from an extension 26 upon being subjected to a force that is substantially larger than forces to which the parts would be subjected during normal shaving  This force could also be larger than the forces needed to connect a cartridge 14 to handle 12  When the blocking surface on the projection extending in from the base 27 is so angled, one can avoid use of a latching member that needs to be deflected prior to retraction, as described in the above-referenced patent application, in this case base 27 will deform during retraction to permit the projection to clear the depression in the handle extension<br><br><br><br><br><br>
