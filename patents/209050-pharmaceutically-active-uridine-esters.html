COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10)<br>
PHARMACEUTICALLY ACTIVE URIDINE ESTERS<br>
TROMMSDORFF GMBH &amp; CO. KG. 14 A,  50999 KOLN, GERMANY, GERMAN National<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br>
Pharmaceutically active uridine esters<br>
Specification<br>
The present invention relates to novel uridine esters, their use as pharmaceutically active agents against a variety of diseases, methods for the preparation of said uridine esters and pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one uridine ester as active ingredient. The present invention relates also to a drug combination comprising free fatty acids and/or fatty acid esters and uridine, deoxyuridine, uridine monophosphate and/or deoxyuridine monophosphate, and to the use of such a drug combination.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Fatty acids:<br>
Carboxylic acids occur in many molecular forms. At first it must be recalled that if the majority of the fatty acids found in lipids are monocarboxylic acids, some of the fatty acids are dicarboxylic and constitute important metabolic products of the previous ones.<br>
To describe precisely the structure of a fatty acid molecule, one must give the length of the carbon chain (number of carbon atoms), the number of double bonds and also the exact position of these double bonds. This will define the biological reactivity of the fatty acid molecule.<br>
Most fatty acids are straight-chain compounds with in most cases an even number of carbon atoms. Chain-lengths range from 2 to 80 carbon atoms, but commonly from 12 up to 24. With a chain length from 2 to 4 carbon atoms they are called short-chain, from 6 to 10 they are called medium-chain and 12 up to 24 they are called long-chain fatty acids. Their physical and biological properties are related to this partition in. 3 classes.<br>
Fatty acids can be further subdivided into well-defined families according to their structure:<br>
a)	Saturated fatty acids<br>
b)	Monoenoic fatty acids<br><br>
c)	Polyenoic fatty acids<br>
- methylene interrupted<br>
\	• polymethylene interrupted<br>
-	conjugated<br>
-	isolated<br><br>
d)	Mono- and multibranched fatty acids<br>
e)	Ring containing fatty acids<br>
cyclopropane acids furanoid acids epoxy acids lipoic acid<br>
f)	Acetylenic fatty acids<br>
• • g)     Hydroxy fatty acids<br>
h)     Sulfur containing fatty acids i)      Dicarboxylic acids j)      Fatty acid amides k)     Keto fatty acids.<br>
The simplest fatty acids are referred to as saturated fatty acids. They have no unsaturated linkages and cannot be altered by hydrogenation or halogenation. When double bonds are present, fatty acids are said unsaturated, monounsaturated (MUFA) if only one double bond is present and polyunsaturated (PUFA) if they have two or more double bonds generally separated by a single methylene group (methylene-interrupted unsaturation).<br>
To describe these unsaturated fatty acids, two ways are offered:<br>
The chemist's terminology:<br>
The carbon atoms are counted from the carboxyl group which put the emphasis on the double bond closest to this group. As an example: 18:2 A9r12-octadecadienoic acid or cis-9, cis-12-octadecadienoic acid, the trivial name: linoleic acid. The double bonds have usually a Z (cis) configuration but can have also a E (trans) configuration.<br>
The biochemist's and physiologist's terminology:<br>
The double bonds are counted from the methyl group determining the metabolic<br>
family, noted by n-x (n being the total number of carbon atoms, x the position of<br><br><br>
the last double bond). The other double bonds are deduced from the first one by adding 3 (this is the most frequent structure, non-conjugated fatty acids, but sometimes by adding 2, these double bonds are said conjugated).<br>
Thus linoleic acid (cf. Fig. 1) or cis-9, cis-12-octadecadienoic acid is also named in the shorthand nomenclature 18:2 (n-6). This compound has 18 carbon atoms, 2 double bonds and 6 carbon atoms from the last double bond to the terminal methyl group. In the old literature it was designated 18:2co6. 18-6=12, 12-3=9 hence D9,12.<br>
Saturated fatty acids have commonly straight chains and even carbon number (n = 4 - 30). They have the general formula: CH3(CH2)nCOOH. Table 1 summarizes some saturated acids and their corresponding trivial names.<br><br>
Monoenoic fatty acids are monounsaturated normal fatty acids which are widespread in the living world where they occur mostly as their cis-isomers. They have the general structure CH3(CH2)xCH=CH(CH2)yCOOH. They can have the unique double bond in a number of different positions, but the most common are<br><br>
of the n-9 series, as oleic acid from olive oil (cis-9-octadecenoic acid) and from quite all seed. oils.   Some important monoenoic acids are listed below:<br><br>
Oleic acid is probably the most common fatty acid (60 - 70% in olive oil). Several positional isomers of oleic acid exist with the cis double bond in the (n-12) or (n-7) position but trans-isomers are known: Elaidic acid (t9-octadecenoic acid) and t-vaccenic acid (t11-octadecenoic acid) are found in the rumen and in lipids of ruminant animals.<br>
An unusual trans fatty acid, t3-hexadecenoic acid (trans-16:1 n-13), occurs in eukaryotic photosynthetic membranes from higher plants and green algae.<br>
Polyenoic fatty acids are also called polyunsaturated fatty acis (PUFA). These fatty acids have 2 or more cis double bonds which are most frequently separated from each other by a single methylene group (methylene-interrupted polyenes). Linoleic acid is a typical member of this group. Some other polyunsaturated fatty acids undergo a migration of one of their double bonds which are not again methylene-interrupted and are known as conjugated fatty acids. Some unusual fatty acids have not the regular structure with a methylene group between two<br><br>
double bonds but are polymethylene-interrupted polyenes. They are found in certain classes of plants, marine invertebrates and insects. Brominated long-chain fatty acids have been isolated from phospholipids of primitive marine animals such as sponges.<br>
The most important polyenoic fatty acids can be grouped into 2 series with a common structural feature: CH3(CH2)XCH=CH— with x=4 for the (n-6) series and with x=1 for the (n-3) series. Eicosapentaenoic acid is a common polyene of the (n-3) series having the double bonds in the 5, 8, 11, 14, and 17 positions. Table 3 summarizes the most common polyenoic fatty acids.<br><br><br>
The most common polyene acids are octadecatrienoic acids (7 species are known). Eleostearic acid (9c11t13t) is found in tong oil and had an industrial importance, calendic acid (8t10t12c) is found in Calendula officinalis and catalpic acid (9c11t13c) is found in Catalpa ovata.<br>
Recently, novel polyene fatty acids with different chain lengths and varying unsaturation were described: 16:5, 18:4, 20:5, 20:6, and unexpectedly 22:7. All these species have in common 4 conjugated all-cis double bonds as in 18:4 with their position in 6, 8, 10, and 12, the novel conjugated docosaheptadecanoic acid having its double bonds in 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, 16, and 19, it was named stellaheptaenoic acid.<br>
Among the unsaturated polymethylene-interrupted fatty acids found in the plant kingdom those with a cis-5 ethylenic bond are present in various sources. The three most frequent fatty acids with that structure are taxoleic acid (all-cis-5,9-18:2), pinolenic acid (all-cis-5,9,12-18:3) which is found in seeds of conifers, Teucrium and also in tall oil, and sciadonic acid (all-cis-5,11,14-20:3). These fatty acids are present in seed oil at levels from about 1% up to 25%. Similar species with 4 double bonds are also described.<br>
Some isoprenoid- fatty acids are known. In this group, the most interesting is retinoic acid (cf. Fig. 1) which derives from retinol and has important functions in cell regulation.<br>
Mono- and multibranched fatty acids, preferably monomethyl branched fatty acids are found in animal and microbial lipids, e.g. mycobacteria. As for hydrocarbons, they have generally either an iso- or an anteiso-structure. For instance, 14-methyl pentadecanoic acid (isopalmitic acid) is of the iso-series and 13-methyl pentadecanoic acid is of the corresponding anteiso-series. Further examples for branched fatty acids are pristanic acid and phytanic acid as shown.in Fig. 1.<br>
Some fatty acids contain either in the chain a cyclopropane ring (present in bacterial lipids) or a cyclopropene ring (present in some seed oils), or at the end of the chain a cyclopentene ring (seed oils). Among cyclopropane acids, lactobacillic acid (11,12-methyleneoctadecanoic acid) is found mainly in gram-negative bacteriae. Another cyclopropane fatty acid (9,10-methylenehexa-decanoic acid) was recently shown to be present in phospholipids of heart and liver mitochondria.<br><br><br>
Cyclopropene acids are found in Malvales seed, oils, and Baobab, Kapok and Mowrah seed oils. Among cyclopentenyl acids, Chaulmoogric acid is found in chaulmoogra oil from seeds of Flacourtiaceae (Hydnocarpus), which was used in folk medicine for treatment of leprosy.<br>
Epoxy acids are present in a number of seed oils. The natural species are all C18 compounds, saturated on unsaturated. For example, 9,10-epoxystearic and 9,10-epoxyoctadec-12-enoic (coronaric acid) acids are found in sunflower seeds (Chrysanthemum).<br>
Lipoic acid (cf. Fig. 1) was first considered as a microbial growth factor but it was found not only in yeast but also in beef liver from which it was first isolated in pure form. Lipoic acid'was named also thioctic acid or 1,2-dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid. After its absorption, this acid is reduced enzymatically by NADH or NADPH to dihydrolipoic acid (or 6,8-dithiane octanoic acid) in various tissues.<br>
First shown necessary for bacteria, lipoic acid was demonstrated to be a coenzyme in the glycine cleavage system and in the dehydrogenase complex. Now. lipoic acid is considered as an efficient antioxidant since with its reduced form it constitutes a redox couple via modulation of NADH/NAD ratio. Consequently, lipoic acid has gained a special interest as a therapeutic agent. It can scavenge hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals but also chelates transition metals. It is also considered that lipoic acid is perhaps the most powerful of all the antioxidants, it may offer an efficient protection against many heart diseases, it is currently used to relieve the complications of diabetes.<br>
Acetylenic fatty acids, also known as ethynoic acids, include fatty acids which contain a triple bond and eventually one or two double bonds. For instance, tariric acid (6-octadecynoic acid) was found in tariri seeds from Picramnia sow, a plant indigenous to Guatemala. Table 4 shows further examples of acetylenic fatty acids.<br>
Table 4:   Acetylenic fatty acids<br><br>
Systematic name	Trivial name<br>
6-octadecynoic acid	Tariric acid<br><br><br><br>
In hydroxy fatty acids the hydroxyl group may occur at various positions in the carbon chain which can be saturated or monoenoic. Some polyhydroxy fatty acids are known, which are most frequently produced by lipoxygenase activities. 2-Hydroxy acids (or a-hydroxy acids) are found in plants (chain from 12 up to 24 carbon atoms) and in animal wool waxes, skin lipids and specialized tissues, mainly in brain. 2-Hydroxytetracosanoic acid (cerebronic acid) and 2-hydroxy-15-tetracosenoic acid (hydroxynervonic acid) are constituents of the ceramide part of cerebrosides and 3-hydroxy acids (or p-hydroxy acids) occur in some bacterial lipids. Further examples are ricinoleic acid (12-hydroxy-9-bctadecenoic acid) which characterizes castor bean oil and lesquerolic acid, the C20 homologue of ricinoleic acid (14-hydroxy-11-eicosenoic acid).<br>
Although the dicarboxylic acids do not occur in appreciable amounts as components of animal or vegetal lipids, they are in general important metabolic products of fatty acids since they originate from them by oxidation. They have the general type formula: HOOC-(CH2)n-COOH. Short-chain dicarboxylic acids are of great importance in the general metabolism and up to n=3 they cannot be considered as lipids since their water solubility is important. The simplest of these intermediates is oxalic acid (n=0), the others are malonic (n=1), succinic (n=2) and glutaric (n=3) acids. The other lipid members of the group found in natural products or from synthesis have a "n" value from 4 up to 21. Examples thereof are: adipic acid (r\=4), pimelic acid (n=5), suberic acid (n=6), azelaic acid (n=7), sebacic acid (n=8), brassylic acid (n=11), and thapsic acid (n=14).<br><br>
Ribose and deoxyribose:<br>
Ribose and deoxyribose are pentoses. Ribose is also called ribofuranose because of the structural relationship to furane. The only structural difference between ribose and deoxyribose is the loss of an hydroxy group in position 2'C of the heterocyclic ring.   Fig. 2 shows the structures of ribose and deoxyribose.<br>
Nucleosides and Nucleotides:<br>
These are compounds in which a purine or pyrimidine base is covalently bound to a sugar. If the base is bound to ribose the result is a ribonucleoside (base + sugar = nucleoside), and if bound to deoxyribose then the nucleoside is deoxyribonucleoside. In deoxyribose the OH-group on 2'C is replaced with hydrogen so becomes deoxy.<br>
The bonding between the base and the sugar involves 1'C OH-group of the sugar, and the N9 nitrogen of a purine or N1 of a pyrimidine in an N-beta-glycosidic linkage. The nucleosides containing deoxyribose possess the same type of glycosidic linkage.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the three purine bases uracil, cytosine, and thymine.<br><br><br>
In order to distinguish the numbering of the sugar ring and numbering of the bases the sugar numbers are primed, e.g. 3' 5*.   Thus, 5' refers to 5'C of the sugar ring.<br>
These are phosphate esters of the nucleosides and they are fairly strong acids.<br>
The phosphoric acid is always esterified to the sugar group (base + sugar +<br>
phosphate = nucleotide). The phosphoric acid could be located on the 2', 3' or<br>
5'C    of    the    sugar    residue.	However    natural    ribonucleotides    and<br>
deoxyribonucleotides have the phosphoric acid on the 5'C position.<br>
The phosphoric acid can undergo further phosphorylation to produce diphosphates and triphosphates, e.g. ADP and ATP. So for each nucleotide monophosphate there is also a nucleotide diphosphate and a nucleotide triphosphate. The di and tri nucleotides do not occur in DNA or RNA only the monophosphate nucleotides. The di and triphosphate nucleotides do occur naturally, and play very important roles in many aspects of biochemical metabolism.<br>
Object of the present invention is to provide novel compounds and novel drug combinations which Can be used for prophylaxis and/or treatment of a variety of diseases and disorders comprising diabetes mellitus Type I and Type II, inflammation, cancer, necrosis, gastric ulcers, neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease), neuropathic diseases, neuropathic pain and polyneuropathy, peripheral and/or central nerve diseases, degradation of the peripheral and/or central nerve system, heavy metal poisoning, ishemic diseases and ishemic heart disease, liver diseases and dysfunction of liver, allergies, cardiovascular diseases, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and retroviral infections (HIV, AIDS), together with methods for said treatment and pharmaceutical compositions used within said methods.<br>
This object is solved by the disclosure of the independent claims. Further advantageous features, aspects and details of the invention are evident from the dependent claims, the description, the examples and the figures of the present application.<br><br><br>
Description of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to compounds having the general formula (I):<br><br>
wherein<br>
R represents R"—COO; R represents hydrogen or a hydroxy group;<br>
R" represents a alkyl chain with 8 to 30 carbon atoms, a monobranched or multibranched alkyl chain with 8 to 30 carbon atoms, a monoenoic alkyl chain with 8 to 30 carbon atoms, a monoenoic branched alkyl chain with 8 to 30 carbon atoms, a polyenoic alkyl chain with 8 to 30 carbon atoms, a polyenoic branched alkyl chain with 8 to 30 carbon atoms, a branched or unbranched alkyl chain with 8 to 30 carbon atoms containing a carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring, a monoinoic alkyl chain with 8 to 30 carbon atoms, a monoinoic branched alkyl chain with 8 to 30 carbon atoms, a polyinoic alkyl chain with 8 to 30 carbon atoms, a polyinoic branched alkyl chain with 8 to 30 carbon atoms, a alkyl chain with 8 to 30 carbon atoms containing at least one double and one triple bond, a branched alkyl chain with 8 to 30 carbon atoms containing at least one double and one triple bond, a hydroxy group or thiol group containing branched or unbranched and/or saturated or unsaturated alkyl chain with 8 to 30 carbon atoms, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
The compounds of the general formula (I) and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof exhibit excellent activity against a variety of diseases and disorders and therefore are useful as pharmaceutically active agents.<br>
The compounds according to formula (I) can be synthesized starting from hydroxy group protected nucleosides or deoxynucleosides.    As protecting groups for the<br><br>
two nucleosid hydroxy groups in position 3 and 4, normally acetals and preferably ketals are used. As protecting groups for the deoxynucleosid hydroxy group in position 3 preferably acid sensitive OH-protecting groups for secondary alcohols are used. These OH-protected nucleosides or deoxynucleosides are used as starting material and are reacted with an carboxylic acid, carboxylic acid halogenid, carboxylic acid cyanide, carboxylic acid azide, and/or carboxylic acid anhydride. In the case, a non-activated carboxylic acid is used, reagents such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) are needed in order to support ester formation.<br>
In the case, a carboxylic acid chloride, bromide, cyanide, or azide is used, a base preferably an organic base such as pyridine, dimethyl aminopyridine (DMAP), triethylamine, imidazole ecty may be added to the reaction mixture.<br>
Normally equimolar amounts of (deoxy)nucleosid and carboxylic acid or carboxylic acid derivatives (carboxylic acid halogenids, - cyanides, - azides, - anhydrides) are used within the process, but also a high excess of one reactant can be used. Preferred solvents comprise polar aprotic solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, DMF, or ethers (THF, dioxane, diethylether, TBDME, etc.).<br>
In the last step of the process the OH-protecting group is removed preferably under smooth acidic conditions optionally at elevated temperatures between 80 and 100°C. Solvents such as acetic acid or a mixture of water and acetic acid or alcohols such as methanol or ethanol gave good results. A broad variety of organic acids such as benzene sulfonic acids, citric acid, methane sulfonic acid, oxalic acid, etc. may be used in catalytic amounts for ketal and acetal cleavage.<br>
Furthermore, it has turned out to be advantageous to carry out all reaction steps under exclusion of light. Purification of the products were performed according to standard procedures well known in the state of the art.<br>
The compounds of the invention are basic and form pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts with organic and inorganic acids. Examples of suitable.acids for such acid addition salt formation are hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, citric acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, salicylic acid, p-aminosalicylic acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, ascorbic acid, maleic acid, sulfonic acid, phosphonic acid, perchloric acid, nitric acid, formic acid, propionic acid, gluconic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, hydroxymaleic acid, pyruvic acid, phenylacetic acid, benzoic acid, p-aminobenzoic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic<br><br><br>
acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, nitrous acid, hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, ethylenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, naphthylsulfonic acid, sulfanilic acid, camphersulfonic acid, china acid, mandelic acid, o-methylmandelic acid, hydrogen-benzenesulfonic acid, picric acid, adipic acid, d-o-tolyltartaric acid, tartronic acid, a-toluic acid, (o,; m, p)-toluic acid, naphthylamine sulfonic acid, and other mineral or carboxylic acids well known to those skilled in the art. The salts are prepared by contacting the free base form with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce a salt in the conventional manner.<br>
The free base forms may be regenerated by treating the salt with a suitable dilute aqueous base solution such as dilute aqueous sodium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, ammonia and sodium bicarbonate. The free base forms differ from their corresponding salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but the salts are otherwise equivalent to their corresponding free base forms for purposes of this invention. .<br>
The inventive compounds of the general formula (I) exhibit also acidic properties, because of the uracil moiety and in addition thereto, depending upon the reagents used for the ester formation, e.g. in the event a dicarboxylic acid is used for ester formation, further acidic groups are present and the inventive compounds are able to form salts with organic or inorganic bases, too. Thus, for example, if there are carboxylic acid substituents in the molecule, salts may be formed with inorganic as well as organic bases such as, for example, NaOH, KOH, NH4OH, tetraalkylammonium hydroxide, and the like.<br>
Thus, suitable pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts of the compounds of the present invention include addition salts formed with organic or inorganic bases. The salt forming ion derived from such bases can be metal ions, e.g., aluminum, alkali metal ions, such as sodium or potassium, alkaline earth metal ions such as calcium or magnesium, or an amine salt ion, of which a number are known for this purpose. Examples include alkali or alkaline-earth hydroxides, alkali or alkaline-earth alkoxides, alkali or alkaline-earth carbonates or bicarbonates, and/or organic bases such as, i.a., ammonia, primary, secondary and tertiary amines, such as, e.g., ethanolamine, glucamine, N-methyl- and N.N-dimethylglucamine, arylalkylamines such as dibenzylamine and N.N-dibenzylethylenediamine, lower alkylamines such as methylamine, t-butylamine, procaine, lower alkylpiperidines such   as   N-ethylpiperidine,   cycloalkylamines   such   as   cyclohexylamine   or<br><br>
dicyclohexylamine, morpholine, 1-adamantylamine, benzathine, or salts derived from amino acids like arginine, lysine, ornithine or amides of originally neutral or acidic amino acids.

composition can range from about 5 to about 95% by weight of the total composition, preferably from about 25 to about 75%, more preferably from about 30 to about 60% by weight, and most preferably from about 40 to 50% by weight.<br>
The term disintegrants refers to materials added to the composition to help it break apart (disintegrate) and release the medicaments. Suitable disintegrants include starches, "cold water soluble" modified starches such as sodium carboxymethyl starch, natural and synthetic gums such as locust bean, karaya, guar, tragacanth and agar, cellulose derivatives such as methylcellulose and sodium carboxymethylcellulose, microcrystalline celluloses and cross-linked microcrystalline celluloses such as sodium croscarmellose, alginates such as alginic acid and sodium alginate, clays such as bentonites, and effervescent mixtures. The amount of disintegrant in the composition can range from about 1 to about 40% by weight of the composition, preferably 2 to about 30% by-weight of the composition, more preferably from about 3 to 20% by weight of the composition, and most preferably from about 5 to about 10% by weight.<br>
Binders characterize substances that bind or "glue" powders together and make<br>
them cohesive by forming granules, thus serving as the "adhesive" in the<br>
formulation. Binders add cohesive strength already available in the diluent or<br>
bulking agent. Suitable binders include sugars such as sucrose, starches derived<br>
from wheat, corn rice and potato; natural gums such as' acacia, gelatin and<br>
tragacanth; derivatives of seaweed such as alginic acid, sodium alginate and<br>
ammonium calcium alginate; cellulosic materials such as methylcellulose and<br>
sodium        carboxymethylcellulose        and	hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose;<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone; and inorganics such as magnesium aluminum silicate. The amount of binder in the composition can range from about 1 to 30% by weight of the composition, preferably from about 2 to about 20% by weight of the composition, more preferably from about 3 to about 10% by weight, even more preferably from about 3 to about 6% by weight.<br>
Lubricant refers to a substance added to the dosage form to enable the tablet, granules, etc. after it has been compressed, to release from the mold or die by reducing friction or wear. Suitable lubricants include metallic stearates such as magnesium stearate, calcium stearate or potassium stearate; stearic acid; high melting point waxes; and water soluble lubricants such as sodium chloride, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium oleate, polyethylene glycols and d'l-leucine.    Lubricants are usually added at the very last step before compression,<br><br>
since they must be present on the surfaces of the granules and in between them and the parts of the tablet press. The amount of lubricant in the composition can range from about 0.05 to about 15% by weight of the composition, preferably 0.2 to about 5% by weight of the composition, more preferably from about 0.3 to about 3%, and most preferably from about 0.3 to about 1.5% by weight of the composition.<br>
Glidents are materials that prevent caking and improve the flow characteristics of granulations, so that flow is smooth and uniform. Suitable glidents include silicon dioxide and talc. The amount of glident in the composition can range from about 0.01 to 10% by weight of the composition, preferably 0.1% to about 7% by weight of the total composition, more preferably from about 0.2 to 5% by weight, and most preferably from about 0.5 to about 2% by weight.<br>
Coloring agents are excipients that provide coloration to the composition or the dosage form. Such excipients can include food grade dyes and food grade dyes adsorbed onto a suitable adsorbent such as clay or aluminum oxide. The amount of the coloring agent can vary from about 0.01 to 10% by weight of the composition, preferably from about 0.05 to 6% by weight, more preferably from about 0.1 to about 4% by weight of the composition, and most preferably from about 0.1 to about 1%.<br>
Techniques for the formulation and administration of the inventive compounds of the present invention may be found in "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences" Mack Publishing Co., Easton PA. A suitable composition comprising at least one compound of the invention and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may be a solution of the compound in a suitable liquid pharmaceutical carrier or any other formulation such as tablets, pills, film tablets, coated tablets, dragees, capsules, powders and deposits, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions, emulsions, and the like.<br>
Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the inventive compounds may be determined by standard pharmaceutical, pharmacological, and toxicological procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effect is the therapeutic index and can be expressed as the ratio between LD50 and ED50. The dosage of the compound  lies preferably within a  range of circulating<br><br><br>
concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The actual amount of the composition administered will be dependent on the subject being treated, on the subject's weight, the severity of the disease, the manner of administration and the judgement of the prescribing physician.<br>

27.7	g uridine were dissolved under nitrogen in 250 ml anhydrous acetone and<br>
11.7	g 2,2-dimethoxypropane. After addition of 0.3 ml cone, sulfuric acid the reaction mixture was stirred for about 20h at room temperature. During this time a voluminous fine precipitation was formed. After filtration the remaining solution was treated with 2 ml triethylamine in 80 ml dichlormethane and was subsequently washed thoroughly.<br><br>
Yield:  21.9 g (77.0 mmol,£8%th) Melting point:   159-160°C '<br>
The yield can be further increased by reducing the volume of acetone for about one third, and by adding heptane as an anti-solvent, and by cooling the mixture to 0-5°C prior to filtration.  Yields in the range of 80-85% can be obtained.<br>
Because of cost reasons it has been demonstrated that the anhydrous acetone can be replaced by bulk acetone having a water content of 0.1% (w/w) without showing an effect on the yield.<br>
Step 2: Esterification<br>
4.00 g DL-a-fipoic acid were dissolved under nitrogen in 50 ml dichlormethane and 4.00 g DCC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) dissolved in 70 ml dichlormethane were added. After 5 minutes 5.51 g of the ketal as obtained from step 1 were given to the solution and after another 5 minutes 150 mg DMAP (dimethyiaminopyridine) were added. The solution was stirred over night at room temperature, diluted with 100 ml MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether) and filtered. The solvent was removed under vacuum and the remaining oil was purified by column chromatography on silica using hexane : ethyl acetate (1:2) as elueht. A yellow viscous oil was obtained.<br>
Yield:  8.06 g (11A mmol, 88% th)<br>
The step 2 reaction can also be carried out in ethyl acetate having the advantage that the reaction product can without purification directly subjected to the reaction conditions of step 3. After stirring the reaction over night at room temperature the slight excess of DCC is hydrolysed to DCU (dicyclohexyl urea) by an aqueous 10% citric acid wash and the excess of DL-a-lipoic acid is easily removed by washing with an aqueous NaHC03-solution. The DCU is removed during work-up by filtration. Yields are between 50 and 90% th depending on scale and solvent.<br>
Beside DCC / DMAP also pivaloyl chloride / DMAP has been examined as effective coupling agents. Solvents like toluene or ethers such as THF or dioxane can be used instead of dichloromethane. Instead of DCC N,N'-carbonyf diimidazole or chloroformic acid isobutyl ester may be used.<br><br><br>
Step 3: Deprotection	,<br>
11.7 g ketal protected compound 5 as obtained from step 2 were stirred 5.5h in 300 ml acetic acid at a temperature of about 95°C. Thereafter, the acetic acid was removed under vacuum and the remainder was redissolved in 150 ml ethyl acetate. Said solution was washed two times with 70 ml saturated NaHC03-solution each and subsequently two times with 100 ml saturated NaCI-solution each. The solution was dried over Na2S04 and the solvent was nearly removed completely (the concentration to dryness should be avoided). The pale remainder was redissolved in 150 ml ethyl acetate and optionally treated with ultrasonic for 2 - 3 minutes while a yellow precipitate was formed. The precipitate (compound 5) was separated by filtration, washed with ethyl acetate and dried. Beside ethyl acetate, n-BuOH, toluene, 1-pentanol, acetonitril or mixtures of these solvents have been examined as alternative precipitation solvents^<br>

Example 9:  Diabetes and Polyneuropathy<br>
The model used to determine the effect of the compounds of the present invention on treating diabetes and/or polyneuropathy comprises the use of in-vitro Hippocampus cuts for detecting the over-sensitiveness of pyramid cells due to the enhancement of the glucose concentration. Said over-sensitiveness could be antagonized dose-dependent by the use of a compound of the general formula (I).<br>
The Hippocampus cuts of rats present a validated model for determination of interaction between a drug substance which is in direct contact with neuronal tissue. The interaction between a pharmaceutically active compound and the brain tissue can be examined directly, because of the maintenance of the three dimensional structure of the tissue within the in-vitro Hippocampus cut. Said compounds act on a special population of nerve cells, the pyramid cells of the Hippocampus.   It is known that the synapse between pyramid cells and Schaffer-<br><br><br>
collaterals (which can be electrically stimulated) use the neurotransmitter glutamate for the process of signal transduction. The result of the electric stimulation, the so called population spike, represents the amount of activated pyramid cells. Other known models allow the in-vitro determination of a neuronal network only within a time frame of up to 8 hours. The advantage of this model is that neuronal network can be analyzed in-vitro over a much longer period after chemical or electric provocation of the cells. The cells are brought to an elevated level of stimulation which allows a long term measurement of pharmacologically active compounds under pathophysiologic conditions (W. Dimpfel et al., Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 1991, 1142-1146; W. Dimpfel et al., Eur. J. Med. Res. 1996,1, 523-527).<br>
Materials &amp; Methods<br>
Within the present method the level of stimulation was elevated by the use of an increased concentration of glucose in the superfusion medium in order to measure the antagonistic effect of the compounds of the present invention. Because of the fact that a-lipolc acid had been applied to this method (W. Dimpfel et al., Eur. J. Med. Res. 1996, 1, 523-527), compound 5' was selected as a close related compound in order to produce reasonable results when comparing a-lipoic acid and uridine with compound 5". Thus, a-lipoic acid and uridine were selected as reference.<br>
21 adult male CD rats had been used within the present studies. The Hippocampus was isolated after anesthetization and exsanguination of the test animals. Whe middle part' of the Hippocampus was fixed by means of a glue in phosphate&amp;uffered saline (Nad: 124 mM, KCI: 5 mM, CaCfe: 2 mM, MgS04: 2 mM. NaH«P04: 1.25 mM, NaHC03: 26 mM, glucose:'10 mM; control solution: ACSF; Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). The Hippocampus was subsequent cut into slides of 400 uM by means of a Vibratom (Rhema Labortechnik). The Hippocampus cuts were stored at least one hour before the test runs in an incubation chamber under carbogen (S.J. Schiff, G.G. Somjen, Brain Research 1985, 345, 279-284).<br>
The experiment was carried out in a so called "Base Unit with Haas Top" (Medical Systems Corporation, U.SA.) at a temperature of 3S'C according to the protocol of H.L. Haas and R.W. Greene (Neurotransmitter and cortical function; ed. M. Avoli, T.A. Reader, R.W. Dykes and P. Gloor, pp. 483-494, Plenum Publishing Corp.).   The Hippocampus cut was placed on a piece'of gauze and perfused by<br><br>
means of peristaltic pumps. The test apparatus was flashed with carbogen (flow rate: 200 mt per hour) in order to maintain the necessary oxygen supply.<br>
The CArregion was stimulated by means of a stimulus generator (laboratory computer, Pro Science) and a bipolar concentric steel electrode (Rhodes Medical Systems, U.S.A.). A pulse width of 200 us was used and the amperage was constantly kept at 200 uA. The stimulus generator released four single stimulation signals within intervals of 20 seconds which released a total number of four population spikes in the Hippocampus cut. An average value of the four amplitudes of the spikes was calculated.<br>
Results<br>
The previous findings that a-lipoic acid is able to antagonize the over-sensitiveness induced by an increased glucose concentration could be reproduced (W. Dimpfel et al., Eur. J. Med. Res. 1996,1,523-527). Furthermore, uridine was used as a second reference. The electric reply of the hippocampal pyramid cells in form of the population spike was increased for about 160% during the presence of 30 mM glucose compared to the initial value of approximately 1 mV. All three substances, a-lipoic acid, uridine and compound 5', were able to reduce dose-dependent the elevated stimulation level.<br>
It could be demonstrated that compound 5' was active within a range of 1 - 25 uM while said rang of concentration was extended to about 100 uM for uridine, a-Lipoic acid shown a nearly linear effect up to a concentration of 400 uM. Thus, the calculated ICso-values for compound 5' are 5 uM, for uridine 40 uM, and for a-lipoic acid is the ICso-value approximately 200 uM.<br>
A direct comparison of the effect of compound 5' with a-lipoic acid and uridine on the enhancement of the glucose-induced over-sensitiveness could be performed by the use of the above described model. The elevated level of over-sensitiveness of the hippocampal pyramid cells could be most effectively treated with compound 5' while uridine and a-lipoic acid showed only weaker effects.<br>
Thus, it can be stressed that compound 5' is able to significantly reduce the increased over-sensitiveness and, therefore, the compounds according to general formula (I) can be used as pharmaceutically effective agents to treat diabetes and polyneuropathy.<br><br><br>
Example 10:   Diabetes and Polyneuropathy<br>
According to the procedure and the model as outlined in Example 9 also S-5 and<br>
R-5 were tested and the test results were compared to those of uridine and a-<br>
lipoicacid.<br>
As a reply to the electric stimulation the population spike of the activated pyramid cells was measured. The amplitude of the population spike represents the amount of activated pyramid cells. The electric reply of the hippocampai pyramid cells in form of the population spike was increased for about 160% to 170% during the presence of 30 mM glucose compared to the initial value of approximately 1 mV. The amplitude of the population spike was measured in uV and the mean was calculated of at least three measured amplitudes.<br>
It could be demonstrated that compound R-5 was active within a range of 1 - 15 uM while compound S-5 was active within the range of 1 -10 pM. As described above, uridine showed activity within the concentration range of 1 -100 uM and a-lipoic acid showed a nearly linear effect up to a concentration of 400 pM. The calculated ICso-value for compound S-5 is 4 uM, for R-5 8 uM, for uridine 40 uM, and for a-lipoic acid is the ICso-value approximately 200 uM.<br>
A comparison of the effect of compounds 5', S-5, and R-5 with ICso-values within the range of 4 - 8 uM with a-llpoic acid (ICso-value * 200 uM) and uridine (ICso-value * 40 pM) on the enhancement of the glucose-induced over-sensitiveness could be performed by the use of the above described model. Said comparison proves that the compounds of the present invention are capable of reducing the elevated level of over-sensitiveness of the hippocampai pyramid cells in a very similar manner while uridine and a-lipoic acid showed much weaker effects.<br>
Thus, it can be stated that the compounds of the present invention are able to significantly reduce the increased over-sensitiveness of the pyramid cells and, therefore, are pharmaceutically effective agents to treat diabetes and polyneuropathy.<br><br><br>
Example 11:   Neuroprotective Effects<br>
As demonstrated by this example, the compounds of the present invention show neuroprotective potency. The neuroprotective effects of a-lipoic acid and more    onounced of dihydrolipoic acid are well known (P. Wolz, J. Krieglstein, Lipoic Acid in Health and Disease, New York, Basel, Hong Kong, Marcel Oekker Inc., 1997, pp. 205-225). Thus, dihydrolipoic acid was chosen as a positive control for comparison reasons. The most similar compound to dihydrolipoic acid of the present invention is compound 5'. The mouse model as described below was used in order to examine the dose-dependent neuroprotective effect of compound 5' in comparison with dihydrolipoic acid and with untreated mice, i.e. mice treated only with a vehicle but without any active ingredient.<br>
Materials &amp; Methods<br>
Permanent focal cerebral ischemia in mice:<br>
Permanent middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion was performed in male NMRI<br>
mice (12 to 17 animals per group) according to the method described by Welsh et<br>
al. (J. Neurochem. 1987,846-851).   Briefly, after the mice were anesthetized with<br>
tribromoethanol (600 mg/kg intraperitoneally), a small hole was drilled in the skuH<br>
to expose the middle cerebral artery.   The stem of the middle cerebral artery and<br>
both branches were permanently occluded by electrocoagulation.       Body<br>
temperature was maintained at 37°C ± 1°C with a heating lamp during the surgical<br>
procedure.   Afterwards, the mice were kept at an environmental temperature of<br>
30°C for 2 hours after MCA occlusion.<br>
For histologic evaluation, the mice were anesthetized again with tribromoethanol and perfused intraperitoneally with a 1.5% solution of neutral red (0.5 ml) 2 days after middle cerebral artery occlusion. The brains were removed and stored in a fixative (4% formalin in phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.4) for 24 hours.<br>
In this model of focal cerebral ischemia in mice, only cortical tissue was found to be infarcted, and furthermore, the infarct volume correlates with the infarct surface (C. Backhaul* et al., J. Pharmacol. Methods 1992, 27, 27-32). The tissue on the brain surface unstained by neutral red was determined, (in square millimeters) as infarcted surface area by means of an image analyzing; system (Kontron, Eching, Germany) according to the publication of C. Backhaul. *<br><br><br>
The injection of compound 5', dihydrolipoic acid, and the vehicle only was performed intraperitoneally 1 hour before MCA occlusion. Compound 5' and dihydrolipoic acid were dissolved in 25% macrogol 400 (vehicle). The injected volume was always 0.25-0.30 ml per mouse. Doses of 100,150, and 500 mg/kg compound 5' and 150 mg/kg dihydrolipoic acid were used. The control group received the vehicle (0.25-0.30 ml 25% macrogol 400 per. mouse) only.<br>
Besujts<br>
The results are given as means ± SD (standard deviation). The differences between compound 5'-treated, dihydrolipoic acid-tredted, and vehicle-treated animals were evaluated statistically according to the ANOVA and DUNCAN test.<br>
In the first series of experiments it could be demonstrated that compound 5' significantly reduced the infarcted area on the mouse brain surface when administered in a concentration of 100 mg in 0.25-0.30 ml vehicle (cf. Table 6).<br>
Table 6:     Influence of comp. 5' and dihydrolipoic acid on infarct area after permanent MCA occlusion in NMRI mice<br><br>
This effect is not clearly dose-dependent, because it seems to decrease with increasing dosage of compound 5'. Thus, it is predicted that somewhere between 20 mg/kg - 100 mg/kg of compound 5' per mouse a maximum neuroprotective effect is reached. This result shows that low dosages of a compound of the present invention may be used to achieve a significant'reduce of infarcted brain area.<br>
The mean of the infarct area obtained from mice treated with 500 mg/kg compound 5" was no longer statistically reduced compared with the controls. The effect of the lowest dose of compound 5' seemed to be the most pronounced and a decrease of the neuroprotective effect was observed at higher concentrations of compound 5'.    At a concentration of 500 mg/kg of compound 5" only a slight<br><br>
neuroprotective effect was detected while dihydrolipolc acid showed no effect at all and did not reduce the infarct area in this study.<br>
The results discussed above clearly demonstrate the neuroprotective effect of compound 5'. In addition, the advantageous finding that a maximum neuroprotective effect is obtained at low concentrations is described. Thus, it has been proven that the compounds of the present invention can be used as anti-ischemic drugs in order to treat, for instance, stroke. Furthermore, no toxic effects could be detected in mice applied to the above-mentioned method.<br>
Example 12:  Neuroprotective Effects<br>
This example was selected to determine the effect of the compounds of the present invention on the concentration of dopamine its metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid (DOPAC) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT or Serotonin) and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindol acetic acid (5-HIAA) in the substantia nigra and the Striatum of Wistar rats (Charles River, Sulzbach Rosenberg).<br>
Said two brain regions were selected in order to examine dopaminergic neurons, because it is well known that said neurons are sensitive to neurotoxines which may cause M. Parkinson, Alzheimer, and Chorea Huntington. The method as described below was used to determine degenerative processes. Sodium malonate was used as a neurotoxic substance within said method.<br>
Materials &amp; Methods<br>
It is known that sodium malonate increases the release von dopamine in the Striatum of the test animals. Groups of six Wistar rats each have been used as test animals. Thus, the dopamine concentration can be used as an indicator in order to determine the harmful effect of neurotoxines.    .<br>
100 mg of compound 5' were dissolved in 5 ml 50% propan-1,2-diol (Merck, Darmstadt). Four 5 ml portions of compound 5* were administered intraperitoneal to the test animals. The first portion was administered,, in the, evening of the first      est day, the second portion during the next morning, the third portion in the evening of the second test day and the late portion during the morning of the third test day. Thirty minutes after the last application of compound 5" 2 umol sodium malonate dissolved in physiologic sodium chloride solution were injected into the<br><br><br>
left Striatum by means of a precision pump (flow rate 0.5 ul/min.) after having anesthetized the rats (Ketamin: 80 mg/kg and Xylasin: 6-10 mg/kg).<br>
Four days after sodium malonate application, the Striatum and the treated and untreated part of the substantia nigra was separately excised, weighted, homogenized with perchloric acid, and centrifuged. Aliquots of the supematants were subsequently subjected to HPLC and by the means of HPLC-ELCD the amount of dopamine, DOPAC, 5-HT, 5-HIAA, and 3-methoxytyramine was colorimetrically measured.<br>
Results<br>
The application of sodium malonate leads to a reduction of dopamine and its metabolites HVA and DOPAC. The neurotoxin malonate decreased the concentration of dopamine (-44%, p
Furthermore, it could be shown that administration of the compound 5' increased dramatically the level of 5-HT and its metabolite 5-HIAA (cf. Fig 5a and 5b). In cases of reduced levels of 5-HT and 5-HIAA, administration of compound 5' was able to significantly increase 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels to normal values. Thus, administration of compound 5' compensates or over-compensates the diminishing effect on the 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels.<br>
The results exhibited above dearly demonstrate the neuroprotective effect of compound 5'. The advantageous findings show that compound 5' is capable of compensating the harmful effect of neurotoxins and is able to increase the 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels. Thus, it has been proven that the compounds of the present invention can be used as drugs in order to treat, for instance, Parkinson, Alzheimer, Chorea Huntington or depression.<br><br><br><br>
