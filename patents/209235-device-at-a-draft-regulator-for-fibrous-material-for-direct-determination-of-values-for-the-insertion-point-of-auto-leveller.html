				<td>Device at a draft regulator for fibrous material for direct determination of values for the insertion point of auto leveller.<br>
The Innovation pertains to a device at a draft regulator for fibrous material for direct determination of setting (control) values for the insertion point of draft regulator, in case of which the control of the drafting frame adjustable in the draft by the card sliver displays at least one anticipatory control, in order to change the draft of the card sliver, where with the help of drafted (stretched) card sliver several test data of a quality indicating dimension, as CV-value, are receivable and are withdrawable towards determination of a function, whose minimum results an optimal insertion point of draft regulator for the control of the draft and the optimised insertion point of draft regulator is determinate in a propulsive testing or adjusting run of the drafting (drawing frame).<br>
The insertion point of auto 1evel1er is an important setting<br>
dimension at the draft, in order to produce card sliver with a<br>
sliver high card/uniformity, that means, with a low CV-value.<br>
In a known device and in a propulsive setting (adjusting) run the card sliver between middle rolls and feed rolls (delivery roll) of the drafting system (device) are drafted and are withdrawn by Calandar rolls, at which a measuring device for the CV-value of the drafted card sliver is connected. In the propulsive adjusting run a multiple of CV test data are determined, which represent a quality indicating measure, relating to the drafted card sliver. With the help of this several test data a functional run is determined, whose minimum corresponds with that value, which promises the best matching of the regulation at the actual card sliver. The several test data,<br>
 2<br>
which are indicated, and with which the functional run is determined, are measured at one, in each case, other adjusting value of the regulation, so that for the definition of the to be evaluated functional run a self incrementally changing parameter, for example, the insertion point of auto leveller of the "electronic memory", is to be collated/ with each of its increment value to one of the/data. Disadvantageous is, that the quality of the card sliver (feed quality) running-in in the drafting system and unstretched cannot be taken into consideration. Besides that, it is disturbing, that only a certain, that means, a similar CV-value is requisitioned.<br>
The innovation takes, therefore, the task as the basis to arrange a device of the nature described in the begining, which avoids the mentioned disadvantages and which improves especially the determination and adjustment of the optimum insertion point of auto leveller at a regulating device of the drafting system.<br>
The solution of this problem takes place by the distinguishing features of the patent claim no.l.<br>
By the measures in accordance with the innovation the optimum insertion point of auto leveller (optimum dead time) is determined by the draft itself. With the help of the CV-values measured on line of the card sliver there determines the control of the drawing frame the optimum point of insertion of the auto leveller that means, that the machine optimises 'itself. By the inclusion of different natured quality distinguishing dimensions, as CV-value; the point of insertion of the auto leveller is determined more precisely. Moreover a quicker determination of the point of insertion of the auto leveller is rendered possible.<br>
The patent claims 2-18 have advantageous further develop, ments of the innovation.<br>
 The innovation is explained in detail in the followinq with the help of the examples of execution represented through/drawing.      <br>
It shows :<br>
Fig.l   A   draft   regulator   with   the   device   in   accordance with the innovation in schematical  lateral view,<br>

Figure   4   Visualising   of   the   automatic   determination   of the optimum insertion point of auto leveller.<br>
According   to   figure   1   there   displays   a   draft   1,   for   example, Truetzschler   draft   HSR,   a   drafting   device2,on  which  a   drafting<br>
are<br>
device (system) inlet 3 and a drafting system outlet 4/pre supported and subsequently supported. The card sliver 5 exit from (not represented) cans coming in the sliver guide 6 and are transported along drawn by the withdrawing (take-up) rollers 7,8 at the measuring component 9. The drafting system 2 is designed as 4 -above 3 drafting system rolling mill, that means, it consists of three bottom rolls I, II, III (I - discharge-bottom roll, II - middle-bottom roll, III - entrance-bottom roll) and four top rolls 11, 12, 13, 14. In the drafting system rolling mill 2 there takes place the draft of the card sliver 5' from several card slivers 5. . The draft composes itself from pre-drafting and main drafting. The pairs of rolls 14/III and 13/II build the pre-draft area and the pairs of rolls 13/II and 11,<br>

 Contd	P/4.<br>

12/I build the main drafting area. The drafted card sliver 5 arrives in the drafting device outlet 4 a web guide 10 and are drawn with the help of the withdrawl (take-up) roller 15 and 16 by a sliver funnel 17, in which these are integrated to a card sliver 18, which is subsequently deposited in cans. With A the direction of work is designated.<br>
The take-up rolls 7, 8, the initial bottom roll III and the middle bottom roll II, which are coupled mechanically, for example, by toothed type belt, are driven by the variable speed motor 19, where  a   desired value is  forecastable . (The pertaining top rolls 14 and 13 run along with). The discharge-bottom roll I and the take-up roll 15, 16 are driven by the main motor 20. The variable speed motor 19 and the main motor 20 each possesseses a regulator 21 and 22. The regulation (speed control) takes place in each case through a closed regulating circuit, where to the regulator 19 a tacho alternator 23 and to the main motor 20 a tacho alternator 24 is allocated. At the inlet of drafting system 3 a measure proportionate to the mass, for example, the cross section of the fed-in card sliver 5, is measured by an inlet measuring organ 9, that, for example, is known from the DE-A-44 04 326. At the outlet of drafting system 4 the cross section of the dischargedcard sliver 18 is won over by a discharge measuring organ allocated to the sliver funnel 17, which, for example, is known from the DE-A-195-37 983. A central computing unit 26 (control and regulating device), for example, micro computer with micro processor transmits an adjustment of the desired dimension for the variable speed motor 19 to the regulator 21. The measured quantity of both the measuring organs 9 and 25 are transmitted to the central computing unit 26 during the drafting process. From the measured-dimensions of the inlet measuring organ 9 and from the desired value for the cross section of the discharging card sliver 18 in the central computing unit 26 the desired value for the variable speed motor 19 is determined. The measured dimension of the outlet measuring organ 25 help the monitoring of the outcoming card<br>

sliver 18 (discharge sliver monitoring). With the help of this regulating system the variations in the cross section of the fed-in card sliver 5 can be compensated by appropriate regulations of the draft process and a comparability of the card sliver can be achieved. With 27 a display screen, with 28 an interface, with 29 a feeding device and with 30a pressure bar is indicated.<br>
The anticipatory control can be integrated, according to figure no. 1, in a central computing unit 26. A separate anticipatory controlling device 30 can be prevalent in accordance with figure no.la, which is attached between the computing unit 26 and the regulator 21 . The computing unit 26 changes the point of insertion or auto leveller R of the anticipatory control 30.<br>
error sensing device The test data of the/ (measuring component) (unit) 9, for example,<br>
variations in thickness of the card sliver 5 are led to a memory (accumulator) 31 in the computer 26 with variable delay. By the delay it is achieved, that the change of the draft of the card sliver in the main draft zone takes place then, according to figure no.2, when the card sliver range measured earlier by the measuring component 9 prevails with the thickness deviating from the desired value in the main draft point 32. When this sliver range reaches the main draft point 32, the belonging test data is recalled from the memory 31. The distance between the<br>
measuring place of the measuring component /9 and the place of<br>
32 draft at the main draft point/is the point of insertion of the<br>
auto leveller R.<br>
The device in accordance with the innovation renders possible the direct determination of adjusting value for the point of starting of auto 1evel1er R. With the help of the drafted (stretched) card sliver 5'' a majority of test data of the card sliver thickness of the outgoing card sliver 51" are received through the sliver funnel 17 and the measuring organ 25, and,<br>
Contd	P/6.<br>
 6<br>
in fact, by various sliver lengths, from which three CV-values CV1m' CV10cm' CV3cm) are calculated as quantity indicating dimensions.<br>
With the help of the undrafted (unstretched) card sliver 5 test data in respect of the card sliver thickness of the incoming card sliver 5 for a definite length of sliver are received by the guiding of the sliver 6 and the measuring organ 9 in an appropriate manner, from which CV-values (CV. ) as quality indicating measure are calculated. The determination of the CV-values takes place for preferably four insertion points of auto leveller R. There appropriately, in each case, two insertion points of auto leveller R of this side and two points of insertion of auto leveller R on the other side of the optimum<br>
insertion point of auto leveller R  are elected. From the<br>
r	opt<br>
CV-values of the unstretched card sliver 5 and of the stretched card sliver 5'', in each case, a quality code number QK is determined on the basis of calculation. Furthermore, a function between the quality code numbers QK and the corresponding insertion point of auto leveller R is calculated in the computer 26 and is represented in the display screen 27 (pls. see fig. 3 &amp; 4). There a polynom of the second grade is determined from the four values for the insertion point of the auto leveller R and the pertaining quality code numbers QK and subsequently the minimum of the curve is calculated. The minimum of the function corresponds with the optimal insertion point of auto leveller R (pls. see fig. 4). In this manner on the basis of the drafted card sliver 5'' several measuring values of three different CV-values and on the basis of the undrafted card sliver 5 several test data of a CV-value are received, in relation to the insertion point of auto leveller R CV-values corresponding with one another for a quality code number QK are integrated and with the help of several quality code numbers QK a function is determined by calculation, whose minimum corresponds with the optimal insertion point of auto leveller Ropt<br>

In operation in one adjusting and test-run in a first step a first value conceived, preferably known from experience for the insertion point of auto leveller for example, R-5 is adjusted. The input can take place through the input device 29 or from a memory (accumulator). In addition, one proceeds as follows<br>
(1) The on line measured sliverquality for each adjustment of<br>
an insertion point of auto leveller is determined, in each<br>
case, by a sliver length of 250 to 300 metre.<br>
(2) The measurements for optimisation of the insertion point<br>
of auto leveller are implemented at one piece without<br>
exchange of cans, if necessary, with machines-stand-still<br>
between the individual insertion point of auto leveller.<br>
(3) The determination of the on line measured sliver quality<br>
takes place through following quality values :<br><br>
* Outlet (discharge) sliverquality : CV3cm' CV10cm' CVlm<br>
(SLIVER-FOCUS)<br>
* Feed sliver quality is described by : CV.  (inlet<br>
measuring funnel)<br>
From this different quality values a quality code number QK is determined :<br>
QK= CV3cm, + CV10cm + CVlm - CVin<br>
With this quality code number the sliverquality is described adequately :<br>
QK high     =&gt;  quality bad QK low      =&gt; quality good<br>
Contd	P/8.<br>
 8<br>
Conditioned by the QK-equation the natural dispersion of the individual values are reduced and outlier not over-valued. The mean value formation leads to exact prediction and under the influence of the regulation both the long as well as short wave lengths are taken into consideration. Even the influence of the feed quality card sliver 5 is taken into consideration in the calculation.<br>
The QK-values, which may be calculated from the actual CV-values of the tests, are inserted in order to be able to develop the steps 4,5,6,7,8.<br>
The quality run above the point of starting of auto leveller R is always symmetrical to the curve minimum (figure 3), that means, in case of optimal starting point of auto leveller R of 0 the CV-value worsening at -4 is exactly so large as at +4. The functional correlation is described on the ground of the symmetry by a polynom of second grade.<br>
The range between -5 and +5 should have been taken into consideration advantageously, so that the differences in quality are large enough and simultaneously the level of the insertion point of regulation remains realistic.<br>
Gradation of 3 to 4 values for the insertion point of auto leveller R supply sufficient supporting points (four piece) : -5-4-3-2-1012345<br>
With the help of numerical solving methods now from the four values a polynom of second grade (symmetrical run) is determined for the insertion point of auto 1 evel1er R and   for the QK-values belonging thereto.<br>
Subsequently, the minimum of the curve is determined with the help of numerical method.<br>
Contd	P/9.<br>
 9<br>
This minimum value is the optimum insertion point of auto leveller R. In case of prevailing machine adjustment and given sliver material (pls. see fig. 4).<br>
With the help of visualising (display screen 27) it is possible to represent (fig. 4) the automatic determination of the insertion point of auto leveller for the operator in a subsequently executable manner.<br>
Several different natured CV-values of different sectional (cutting length) are compared with one another, and besides the discharge quality (card sliver 5'') also the feed quality is taken into consideration as an important quality-feature. Furthermore, the main drafting point from the minimum of a polynom of second grade, that means, a symmetrical run is computed. Several different CV-values are integrated according to an algorithm for a quality code number QK. From the insertion point of auto leveller R and the corresponding quality code number a function is approximated. The minimum is calculated from the resulting functional runs. The determination takes place in the pre-operation-test or adjusting run. The optimised insertion point of auto 1evel1er Ropt is taken over before beginning of the production operation by the control 26:30 and a consistency enquiry with, in case of necessity, fault recording is implemented. In one graphic the result is represented to the operator In a subsequently performable manner. Four quality code numbers QK are determined for stipulated inserting point of auto leveller R. These four quality code numbers are deposited in an accumulator (memory) and from them a functional run is approximated. Only then the minimum from the functional run is computed. For each quality code number some meter of card slivers are required. The quality indicating dimension (CV-value) is determined both between the delivery roll and deposit (discharge),  but  also  at  the  inlet  measuring  hopper.<br>

measuring hopper. The test run is conducted within a can filling. Between the four insertion points of auto leveliler R (support points) the machine is stopped. The definite four insertion points of auto leveller R display different distances.<br>
The advantages of the automatic optimisation of the insertion point of the auto leveller consist of among other things :<br>
(a) Quicker optimisation of the insertion point of auto<br>
leveller.<br>
(b) Material sparing optimisation.<br>
(c) No requirement of the laboratory and of the Uster-Tester.<br>
(d) CV-values for the optimisation   are no more spoiled by<br>
effects like depositing of can, influences of climate etc.<br>
Thereby better optimisation result.<br>
(e) Realisation of the "self optimising draft (stretch)".<br>
(f) Effective utilisation of the machine control (computer<br>
26).<br>
(g) With the help of automatic optimisation the optimal<br>
insertion point of auto leveller can even be found, when<br>
the data of the working storage and the data of the<br>
mechanical adjustment do not conform with one another.<br>
(h)  Transfer of knowledge for progress during the manual optimisation to the operator drops out.<br>
By the automatic determination of the insertion point of auto leveller (main draft point) it is possible to improve not only<br>

the sliver uniformity, but also in the same extent the CV-values of the thread quality. This showed spinning machine final count in case of PES/BW mixture.<br>
