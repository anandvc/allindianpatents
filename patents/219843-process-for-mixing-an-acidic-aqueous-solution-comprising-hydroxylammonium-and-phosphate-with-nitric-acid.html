PROCESS FOR MIXING AN ACIDIC AQUEOUS SOLUTION COMPRISING HYDROXYLAMMONIUM AND PHOSPHATE WITH NITRIC ACID<br>
The invention relates to a process for mixing a first acidic aqueous solution comprising hydroxylammonium and phosphate with a second acidic aqueous solution comprising nitric acid, resulting in a third acidic aqueous solution comprising hydroxylammonium, phosphate and nitric acid.<br>
Cydohexanone oxime can be prepared in a process in which an aqueous reaction medium is cycled from a hydroxylammonium synthesis reactor in which hydroxylammonium is prepared by catalytic reduction of nitrate with hydrogen to a cydohexanone oxime synthesis reactor in which cydohexanone oxime is produced by reaction of hydroxylammonium with cydohexanone and from the cydohexanone oxime synthesis reactor back to the hydroxylammonium synthesis reactor. To make up for the nitrate that is reduced in the hydroxylammonium synthesis reactor, nitric add can be introduced into the aqueous reaction medium by mixing a nitric acid solution with the aqueous solution leaving the cydohexanone oxime synthesis zone. The aqueous reaction medium leaving the cydohexanone oxime synthesis reactor may comprise unreached hydroxylammonium. Said unreacted'hydroxylammonium may decompose as a result of the mixing with the nitric acid solution, this decomposition being disadvantageous, as hydroxylammonium is a useful product.<br>
CN-A-1281349 discloses the use of a static mixer for mixing both solutions. However, in the mixed solution decomposition of hydroxylammonium may stiii occur.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a process for mixing a first acidic aqueous solution comprising hydroxylammonium and phosphate with a second acidic aqueous solution comprising nitric acid, resulting in a third acidic aqueous solution comprising hydroxylammonium, phosphate and nitric acid, in which decomposition of hydroxylammonium in the third acidic aqueous solution is prevented or at least reduced.<br>
This object is achieved in that in the third acidic aqueous solution the total acid concentration minusJhe phosphate concentration is lower than<br><br>

Obtaining a sufficiently nigh hydroxylammonium concentration in the first acidic aqueous solution can izr example be achieved by adding hydroxyiammonium to an acidic aqueous solution comprising hydroxylammonium to obtain the first acidic aqueous solution. Obtaining a sufficiently high hydroxylammonium concentration in the third acidic aqueous solution can for example be achieved by adding hydroxylammonium to the third acidic aqueous solution and/or by performing the mixing cf the first and second acidic aqueous solution in a hydroxyiammonium reactor in which hydroxylammonium is prepared by catalytic reduction of nitrate with hydrogen.<br>

Brief Description of the Drawing<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of an embodiment of the process according to the present invention.<br>
Descriptor of an embodiment<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, A represents the hydroxylammonium raactor. B represents the cyclohexanone oxime reactor. To reactor A, containing catalyst, an acidic aqueous solution comprising hydroxylammonium, phosphate and nitric acid is fed as aqueous reaction medium through line 1 and hydrogen is fed through line 2; optionally an additional acidic aqueous solution comprising nitric acid is fed to reactor A through 'ine 3; unreacied hydrogen is discharged, with any other gases, via line 4. Ir. the hydroxylammonium reactor A, the aqueous reaction medium is enriched in hydroxylammonium. "his aqueous reaction medium being enriched in hydroxyianmonium leaves reactor A via line 5 and is cycled to the cyctohexanone oxime reactor B via lire 6. The cyclohexanone to be converted is fed to reactor B via line 7. The largest pa.-, of cyclohexanone oxime produced and dissolved in an organic solvent !s removed frcm the system via line 8. The aqueous reaction medium leaving the cyclohexanone c/ime reactor through line 9 is extracted in an extraction zone C.<br><br>
An extraction agent, an organic solvent, enters extraction zone C through line 10. Within extraction zone C, additional cyclohexanone oxime is removec from the aqueous reaction medium and carried out of zone C in the organic sc'vent and is fed through line 11 to zone 3.<br>
The aqueous reaction medium leaving extraction zone C through line 12 is recycled to the hydroxylammonium reactor A, through lines 13. "4, 15. and 1. A part of the aqueous reaction medium leaving the extraction zone C through line 12 is tapped for absorbing and oxidizing nitrogen oxides. This part of the aqueous reaction medium is fed through line 15 to absorption column Dr in which nitrogen oxides are absorbed, which are produced in reactor E by ammonia combustion and fed through 'ins 13 to absorption column D. In. column D nitric acid is produced from absorbed nitrogen oxides by a further reaction with water from the aqueous reaction medium. The aqusous reaction medium enriched with nitric acid passes from column D to bleaching column F through line 16. In column F residual nitrogen oxides are oxidized into nitric acid. Accordingly, the nitric acid concentration is increased in the aqueous reaction medium leaving column F through line 19. Optionally an additional amount of nitric acid can bs supplied through line 20 and mixed with the acidic aqueous solution comprising nitric acid passing through line 19. The thus obtained second acidic-aqueous solution comprising nitric acid passing through line 21 is mixed with the aqueous reaction medium passing through line 14, the first acidic aqueous solution. Optionally an additional amount of nitric acid can be supplied through line 22 and mixed with the third acidic aqueous solution passing through line 15. Subsequently the thus obtained third or fourth acidic aqueous solution is fed to the hydroxyiammoniun reactor through line 1, completing the cycle. The aqueous reaction medium passing through line 13 may be enriched with hydroxylammonium by adding an aqueous solution comprising hydroxylammonium through line 16, which may be tapped from line 5.<br>

In all examples decomposition of hydroxylammoniurn was monitored by monitoring gas evolution in the third acicic aqueous solution with a bubbler.<br>
Comparative Experiment A<br>
A glass reactor equipped with baffles and a turbine stirrer was filled with 40 ml of a first acidic aqueous solution, comprising per litre 0.029 mole hydroxylammoniurn, 4.51 mole phosphate, 3.52 moi ammonium and 1.51 moie nitrate, the total acid concentration being 2.67 moie oer litre. This first acidic aqueous solution was heated to 65 °C under a continuous stream of nitrogen gas ana vigorous stirring (600 rpm). After the solution has reached the desired temperature the supply of nitrogen was stopped and 30 ml of a second acidic aqueous solution, comprising per litre no hydroxylammoniurn, and 2.33 mole phosphate, 1.53 mole ammonium and 6.4^-mole nitrate, having a total acid concentration of 7.53 moie per litre, was mixed with the first acidic aqueous solution drop wise. At a certain point during the addition of the second acidic aqueous solution decomposition of hydroxylammoniurn starts, which was observed by a vigorous gas evolution. After the addition of the second acidic aqueous solution was completed and the gas evolution in the third acidic aqueous solution having a temperature of 65 °C had stopped the hydroxylammoniurn concentration in the third acidic aqueous solution was determined by titration and appeared to be 
0.523 * ln([hydroxylammonium]/1.25) + 422/(T + 81) is 0.63. Thus this comparative Experiment demonstrates decomposition of hydroxylammoniurn in the case that the total acid concentration minus the phosphate concentration in the third acidic aquecus solution is higher than 0.523 * ln([hydroxyiammonium]/1 -25) + 422/(T + 81).<br><br>
Example I<br>
Comparative Experiment A was repeated excect :hat instead of 30 ml, 20 ml of the second acidic aqueous solution was mixed with the first acidic aquecus solution. In this case no vigorous gas evolution couid be observed. :n the third acidic aqueous solution having a temperature of 65 °C the hydroxylammcnium concentration determined by titration was 0.013 mol/l, which is equal to the calculated value of 0.0*9. The calculated total acid concentration minus the calculated phosphate concentration in the third acidic aquecus solution of this Example is 0.3 mol/l. The calculated value for 0.523 * ln([hydroxylammonium]/1.25) + 422'(T + 81) is 0.7. Thus this example demonstrates that no decomposition of hydroxylammonium occurs in the third acidic aquecus solution when the total acid concentration minus the phosphate concentration in the third acidic aqueous solution is lower than 0.523 * in([hydroxylammomum]/1.25) + 422/(T + 31).<br>
Example II<br>
Comparative Experiment A was repeated except that the third acidic aqueous solution was heated to 35 °C. No vigorous gas evolution could be obsen/ed. In the third acidic aqueous solution the hydroxylammonium concentration determined by titration was 0,017 mol/l, which is equal to the calculated'hydroxylammonium concentration, being 0.017 mol/l. The calculated total acid concentration minus the calculated phosphate concentration in the third acidic aqueous solution cf this Examole is 1.2 mol/l. The calculated value for 0.523 * ln([hydroxylammonium]/1.25) + 422/(T ^ 31) is 1.4. Thus this Example demonstrates that no decomposition of hydroxylammonium occurs in the third acidic aqueous solution at a temperature of 35 °C when the total acia concentration minus the phosphate concentration in the third acidic aqueous solution is lower than 0.523 * ln([hydroxylanmonium]/1.25) + 422/(T + 81).<br>
Example III<br>
Comoarative Experiment A was repeated except that as first acidic aqueous solution, v/as used a solution comprising per litre 0.146 mole hydroxylammonium, 3.74 mole phosphate, 3.34 mole ammonium and 2.57 mol nitrate, the total acid concentration being 2.33 mol per litre. No vigorous gas evolution could be observed. In the third acidic aqueous solution having a temperature cf 65 5C the<br><br>
hydroxylammonium concentration determined by titration was 0.08 mol/l, which is equal to the calculated hydroxylammonium concentration, being 0.08 mol/l. The calculated total acid concentration minus the calculated phosphate concentration in the third acidic aqueous solution of this Example is 1.2 mol/I. The calculated value for 0.523 ■* h([hydroxyiammcnium]/1.25} ^ 422/(T + 81) is 1.5. Thus this Example demonstrates that no decomposition of hydroxylammonium occurs in the-third acidic aqueous solution when the total aciG concentration minus the phosphate concentration in the third acidic aqueous solution is lower than 0.523 * ln-([hydroxy»ammonium]/1.25) + 422/(T + 81).<br>
Examples IV-XXIV<br>
Comparative ExDeriment A was repeated except that different first and second acidic aqueous solutions and temperatures were used and that the addition of the second acidic aqueous solution was stopped at the moment gas evolution started. At that moment the amount of added second acidic aqueous solutions was determined, the total acid concentration minus the phosphate concentration in the third acidic aqueous solution was calculated, the value for 0.523 * ln([hydroxylammonium]/1.25) + 422/(T + 81)in the third acidic aqueous solution was calculated and the amount of hydroxylammonium was calculated. All data are given in Tables 1-3. These Examples show that decomposition of hydroxylammonium starts.at the point where the total acid concentration minus the phosphate concentration in the third acidic aqueous solution is equal to 0.523 * ln([hydroxylammonium]/1.25) + 422/(T + 81).<br><br><br><br><br><br>

Ax :~s moment gas evolution started the calculated hydroxylammonium concentration in the trrd acidic acueous solution having a temperature of 50 °C was 0.61 mol/L The calculated tctal acid concen:ration minus the calculated phosphate concentration in the third acidic aqueous solution of this Example is 2.7 mol/L The calculated value for 0.523 * in([hyd"Oxylarmonium]/1.25j + 422/(T + 81) is 2.6. This Experiment demonstrates that in the third acidic aqueous solution comprising per litre 0.61 mole hydroxylammonium, obtained by mixing a ""3t acidic acueous solution with a second acidic aqueous solution which is obtained by r:xing an acicic aqueous solution comprising nitric acid and phesohate with a 65% nitric acid solution, decomposition ofhydroxylammonium starts at the moment that the total acid concentration minus the phosphate concentration in the third acidic aqueous solution is ecai to 0.522 * lr,([hydroxylammonium]/1,25) + 422/(T + 81).<br>
Example XXVI<br>
Example XXV was repeated except that for the second acidic aqueous solution a 65% aquecus nitric acid solution is used which was added drop wise to the first acidic aqueous sclutic" until gas evolution started. At the moment gas evolution stared 41 ml of the 65% aqueous nitric acid solution has been added and the calculated hydroxylammonium concentration ir. the third acidic aqueous solution having a temperature of 60 CC was 1.02 mo::. The caicuiatec total acid concentration minus the calculated phosphate concentration in the third acidic aqueous solution of this Example is 3.2 rr.cl/l. The calculated value fcr 0.523 * !n([hydroxylammonium]/1.25) + 422/(T + 31) is 2.9. This Example demonstrates that if the concentration of hydroxylammonium in the third acicic aqueous solution is 1.!2 mc'/i and the second acidic aqueous solution, being a 65% aqueous nitric acid sc'utiom is mixed crop wise with the first acidic aqueous solution no deccmpositicn occurs «nt;l the total acid concentration minus the phosphate concentration in<br><br>
the third acidic acueous solution is equal to 0.523 * ln([hydroxylamr.onium]/1.25) + 422/(T + 31).<br>
