				<td>This invention rclates to tiorinalcd 4-a7asteroid derivaiives as androgen receptor modulators<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to fluorinated 4-azasteroid derivatives, their synthesis, and there use as androgen receptor modulators. More particularly, the compounds of the present invention are tissue-selective androgen receptor modulators and arc thereby useful Tor the treatment of conditions caused by androgen deficiency or which can be ameliorated by androgen administration, such as osteoporosis, periodontal disease, bone fracture, frailty, and sarcopenia.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVF.NI ION<br>
The androgen receptor (AR) belongs to the superfamily of steroid/thyroid hormone nuclear receptors, whose other members include the estrogen receptor (F^R), the progj:terone receptor (PR), the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). The AR is expressed in numerous tissues of the body and is the receptor thioiigh which the physiological as well as the pathophysiological cflecls of cndogcnc-us androgen ligands, such as testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (FMT), are expressed. Structurally, the AR is composed of three main functional domaiiis: the ligand binding domain (LBD). the DNA-binding domain, and amino-terminal . A compound that binds to the AR and mimics the effects ofan endogenous AR ligand is referred to as an AR agonist, whereas a compound thai inhibits the effects ofan endogenous AR ligand is termed an AR antagonist.<br>
Androgci; ligand binding to (he AR affords a ligand/receptor complex, which, subsequent to translocation inside the nucleus of the cell, binds to specific regulatory DNA .sequences (referred to as androgen response elements or AREs) within the promoter or enhancer regions of the target gene or genes present in the cell"s nucleus. Other proteins termed cofaclors are next recruited which bind to the amino-terminal domain or .he LBD of the receptor leading to gene transcription and subsequent translation tc produce the protein(s) encoded by that gene or genes.<br>
Androj.-""n therapy has been used in the clinic to treat a variety of male disorders, such as reproductive disorders and primary or secondary male hypogonadism. Moreover, a number of natural or synthetic AR agonists have been clinically investigated for the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders, such as bone<br><br>
disease, hematopoietic disorders, neuromuscular disease, rheumatological disease, wasting disease, and for hormone replacement therapy (HRT), such as female androgen deficiency. In addition, AR antagonists, such as flutamide and bicalutamide, have been used to treat prostate CHiicer. It would therefore be useful to have available compounds that can activate (""agoii/e") the function of the AR in a tissue-selective manner which would afford the desired beneficial osteo- and myoanabotic effects of androgens but without the negative androgenic properties, such as virilization and induction of an atherogenic lipid profile which can lead to cardiovascular disease.<br>
fhe role of androgens in bone formation has been documented. For csample. anabolic sVcoids, such as nandrolone decanoate or sVanozolol, have been shown to increase borie mass in postmenopausal women. The beneficial effects of androgens on bone in postmenopausal osteoporosis were documented in recent studies using combined testosterone and estrogen administration [Hofbauer, et al., "Androgen cITcclson bone metabolism: recent progress and controversies." Eur. J. Endocrinol. 140: 271-286 (1999)1- Coml^infid treatment significantly increased the rate and extent ofthc ri.se in bone mineral de.isily (BMD) in the lumbar and hip regions, relative to treatment with estrogen alone. Additionally, estrogen - progestin combinations that incorporated an androgenic progestin (such as norcthindrone), rather than medroxyprogesterone acetate, yielded greater improvements in hip BMD. These results have recently been confirmed in a larger 2-ycar, double-blind comparison study in which oral conjugated estrogen (Crii) and methyl testosterone combinations were demonstrated to be effective in promoting accrual c" bone mass in the spine and hip, while conjugated estrogen therapy alone prevented bone loss ["A two-year, double-blind comparison of estrogen-androgen and conjugated estrogens in surgically menopausal women: Effects on bone mineral density, symptojiis and lipid profiles," J. Reprod. Med.. 44: 1012-1020 (1999)j. Despite the beneficial effects of androgens in postmenopausal women, the use of androgens has been limited because of the undesirable virilizing and metabolic action of androgens. The diua from Watts and colleagues demonstrate that hot flushes decrease in women treated with CEE and melhyltestosterone; however, 30% of these women sufTcrcd from significant increases in acne and facial hair, a complication of all current androgen phanr.^icotherapies | Watts, et al., "Comparison of oral estrogens and estrogens plus androgen on bone mineral density, menopausal symptoms, and lipid-lipoprotein profiles ia surgical menopause." Obstet. Gynecol.. 85: 529-537 (1995)]. Moreover, the addition of melhyltestosterone to CEE markedly decreased HDL levels,<br><br>
as seen in other studies. Therefore, non-tissue selective AR agonists may increase the risk of cardiovascular Jisease. Thus, the virilizing potential and negative effects on lipid profile of current androgen therapies provide a strong rationale for developing tissue-selective androgen receptor agonists for bone. Reference is made to J. A. Kanis, "Other agents for generalized osteoporosis," in Osteoporosis. Blackwell Science, Ch. 8, pp 196-227 (1994) for -i discussion of non-selective anabolic steroids in the treatment of osteoporosis.<br>
It is alsu well established that androgens play an important role in bone metabolism in men, which parallels the role of estrogens in women [Anderson, et al., ""Androgen supplementntion in eugonadal men with osteoporosis - effects of six months of treatment on bone mineral density and cardiovascular risk factors," Bone. 18: 171-177 (1996)|. F.ven in eugonadal men with established osteoporosis, the therapeutic response to testosterone treatment provided additional evidence that androgens exert impoi am osteoanabolie effects. Mean lumbar BMD increased from 0.799 giTi/cm2 to 0.839 g/cm2, in 5 to 6 months in response to 250 mg of testosterone ester administered intramuscularly every fortnight. A common scenario for androgen deficiency occurs in men with stage D prostate cancer (metastatic) who undergo androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Endocrine orchiectomy is achieved by long acting GnRH agonists, while androgen receptor blockade is implemented with flutamidc, nilutamidc, bicalutamide, or RU 58841 (AR antagonists). In response to hormonal deprivation, these men suffered from hot flushes, significant bone loss, weakness, and fatigue. In a recent pilot study of men with stage D prostate cancer, osteopenia (50% vs. 38%) and osteoporosis (38% vs. 25%) were more common in men who had undergone A DT for greater than one year than the patients who did not undergo ADT [Wei, ct al.. "Androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer results in significant loss of bor.i density," Urology. 54: 607-611 (1999)]. Lumbar spine BMD was significantly lower =n men who had undergone ADT. Thus, in addition to the use of tissue selective AR agonists for osteoporosis, tissue selective AR antagonists in the prostate that lack antagonistic action in bone and muscle may be useful agents for the treatment of prostate cancer, either alone or as an adjunct to traditional ADT such as with a GnRH agonist/antagonist [See also A. Stoch, et al., J. Clin. Endocrin. Metab.. 86: 2787-2791 (2001)] Tissue-selective AR antagonists may also have utility in the treatment of polycysiic ovarian syndrome in postmenopausal women [see C.A. liagleson,   et al..   ""Polycystic  ovarian  syndrome:  evidence that flutamide restores<br><br>
sensitivity of the gon^jdolropin-releasing hormone pulse generator to inhibition by estradiol and progesterone," J. Clin. Bndocrinol. Metab.. 85: 4047-4052 (2000) and E. Diamanti-Kandarakis. "I"hc Effect of a Pure Antiandrogen Receptor Blocker, Flulamidc. on the Lipid Profile in the Polycystic Ovary Syndrome," Int. J. Endocrinol. Mel_a_k, 83: 2699-2705 , i998).<br>
There is a need for more effective agents to treat osteopeaia and osteoporosis in both rrien and women. Osteoporosis is characterized by bone loss, resulting from an imbalance between bone resorption (destruction) and bone formation, which starts in the fourth decade and continues throughout life at the rate of about 1-4% per year lEasteit, " Treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis," New Engl. J. Med., 338: 736 (I998)|. In tiv; United States, there are currently about 20 million people with detectable fractures of J.K vertebrae due to osteoporosis. In addition, there arc about 250,000 hip fractures per year due to osteoporosis, associated with a l2%-20% mortality rate within the first two years, while 30% of patients require nursing home care after the fracture and many never become fully ambulatory again. In postmenopausal women, estrogen deficiency leads to increased bone resorption resulting in bone loss n the vertebrae of around 5% per year, immediately following menopause. Thus, first line treatment/prevention of this condition is inhibition of bone resorption by bisphosphonates, estrogens, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), and calcitonin. However, inhibitors of bone resorption are not sufficient to restore bone mass for n^i"-icnts who have already lost a significant amount of bone. The increase in spinal liMD attained by bisphosphonate treatment can reach 11% after 7 years of treatment wit: alendronate. In addition, as the rate of bone turnover differs from site to site, highf "n the trabecular bone of the vertebrae than in the cortex of the long bones, the bone resorption inhibitors are less effective in increasing hip BMD and preventing hip fracture. Therefore, osteoanabolic agents, which increase cortical bone formation and bone mass of long bones by stimulating periosteal bone formation, would address an unmet need in the treatment of osteoporosis especially for patients with high risk of hip fractures. The osteoanabolic agents also complement the bone resorption inhibitors th:."t target the trabecular envelope, leading to a biomechanically favorable bone structure (Schmidt, et al., "Anabolic steroid: Steroid effects on bone in women," In; J. P. Bilezikian, el al., Ed., Principles of Bone Biology- San Diego: Academic Press, 1996). Tissue-selective AR agonists with diminished deleterious effects on ihe cardiovascular system and limited virilizing potential may be useful as a<br><br>
monotherapy for the prevention and/or treatment of female osteoporosis. In addition, a compound with ostcoai.abolic properties in bone and muscle but with reduced activity in the prostate and s".-: accessory tissues may be useful for the prevention and/or treatment of male osle
Selective androgen receptor modulators may also be useful to treat certain hematopoietic disorders. It is known that androgens stimulate renal hypertrophy and erythropoietin (HfCJ) production. Prior to the introduction of recombinant human tPO, androgens were employed to treat anemia caused by chronic renal failure. In addition, androgens at pharmacological doses were found to increase serum EPO levels in anemic patients with non-severe aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndromes but not in non-anemic pa"."fnls. Treatment modalities for anemia will require selective action such as may be provided by selective androgen receptor modulators.<br>
I-urthermore, selective androgen receptor modulators may also have clinical value as an adjunct to the treatment of obesity. This approach to lowering body fat is supported by ;*iiblished observations that androgen administration reduced subcutaneous and visceral abdominal fat in obese men [J.C. Lovejoy. et al., "Oral anabolic steroid treatment, but not parenteral androgen treatment, decreases abdominal fat in obese, older men," Int. J. Obesity. 19: 614-624 (1995)]. Therefore, SARMs devoid of androgenic .;rfects on prostate may be beneficial in the treatmem of obese men. In a separate st"idy, androgen administration resulted in loss of subcutaneous abdominal fat in obcpc postmenopausal women [ J.C. Lovejoy, et al., "Exogenous Androgens Influence Body Composition and Regional Body Fat Distribution in Obese Postmenopausal Womf;n - A Clinical Research Center Study," J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.. 81: 21^8-2203 (19%)]. In the latter study, nandrolone decanoate, a weak androgen and anabolv agent, was found to increase lean body mass and resting metabolic rate in obese postmenopausal women consuming a weight-reducing diet.<br>
Non-ste.oidal compounds having androgen receptor modulating properties were disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,688,808; 5,696,130; 6,017,924; 6.093.821; WO 01/1613") (published 8 March 2001); and WO 01/16108 (published 8 March 2001), all assigned to Ligand Pharmaceuticals, and in WO 01/27086, assigned to Kaken Pharm. Co. Ar^ditional background for the rationale behind the development of Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators is found in L. Zhi and E. Martinborough in Ann. Rep. Med. Chcm. 36: 169-180 (2001). Non-steroidal SARMs were disclosed in J.P.   Udwards.   "New   Nonsteroidal   Androgen   Receptor   Modulators   Based  on  4-<br><br>
(Trinuoromethyl}-2(l I !i-Pyrrolidino[3.2-g]quinolinone,"" Bioorg, Med. Chem. Lett.. 8: 745-750 (1998) and in L. Zhi et al., "Switching Androgen Receptor Antagonists to Agonists by Modifying C-ring Substituents on Piperidino[3,4-g]quinolinone." Bioorg. Med. .Chem^etl.. 9: 1009-1012 (1999).<br>
There exists a need in the clinical art for more effective agents that can elicit the positive responses of androgen replacement therapy but without the undesired side effects of non-liss"."e selective agonists of the AR. What is needed are compounds that can produce the same positive responses as androgen replacement therapy but without the undesired side effects. Also needed are androgenic compounds that exert selective effects on different tissues of the body. In this invention, we have identified compounds that function cis selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) using a series of m vilro cell-a-ssays that profile ligand mediated activation of AR, such as (i) N-C interaction, (ii) transcriptional repression, and (iii) transcriptional activation. SARM compounds in ilils invention, identified with the methods listed above, exhibit tissue selective AR agonism in vivo, i.e. agonism in bone (stimulation of bone formation in a rodent model of osteoporosis) and antagonism in prostate (minimal elTects on prostate growih in castrated rodents and antagonism of prostate growth induced by AR agonists,.<br>
The compounds of the present invention identified as SARMs are useful to treat diseases or conui".ions caused by androgen deficiency which can be ameliorated by androgen administration. Such compounds are ideal for the treatment of osteoporosis in women and men as a monotherapy or in combination with inhibitors of bone resorption, such at&gt; bisphosphonates, estrogens, SERMs, cathepsin K inhibitors, av33 integrin receptor antagonists, calcitonin, and proton pump inhibitors. They can also be used with agents that stimulate bone formation, such as parathyroid hormone or analogs thereof. The SARM compounds of the present invention may also be employed for treatment of prostate disease, such as prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (til"H). Moreover, compounds of this invention exhibit minimal effects on skin (acne and facial nair growth) and may be useful for treatment of hirsutism. Additionally, compounJs of this invention can stimulate muscle growth and may be useful for treatment "•■i sarcopcnia and frailty. They can be employed to reduce subcutaneous and visceral abdominal fat in the treatment of obesity. Moreover, compounds of this invention can exhibit androgen agonism in the central nervous system and may be useful to treat vasomotor symptoms (hot flush) and to increase<br><br>
energy and libido, particularly in postmenopausal women. The compounds of the present invention may be used in the treatment of prostate cancer, either aione or as an adjunct to traditional GnRfl agonist/antagonist therapy, for their ability to restore bone, or as a replacement for antiandrogen therapy because of their ability to antagonize androgen in the prostaic and minimiz-c bone depletion in the skeletal system. Further, the compounds of [he present invention may be used for their abihiy to restore bone in the treatment of pancrealic cancer as an adjunct to treatment with antiandrogen, or as monolhcrapy for their antiandrogenic properties, offering the advantage over traditional anliandrogens of being bone-sparing. Additionally, compounds of this invention can increase the number of blood ccUs, such as red blood cell.s and platelets, and may be useful for the treaimciii of hematopoietic disorders, such as aplastic anemia. Finally, compounds of this invention have minimal effects on lipid metabolism. Thus, considering their tissue selective androgen receptor agonism listed above, the compounds of this invention are ideal for hormone replacement therapy in hypogonadtc (androgen deficient) men.<br>

Compounds of the present invention have been found to be tissue-selective modulators of liic androgen receptor (SARMs). In one aspect, compounds of the present invention in^y be useful to activate the function of the androgen receptor in a mammal, and in parixular to activate the function of the androgen receptor in bone and/or muscle tissue and block or inhibit ("antagonize") the function of the androgen receptor in the prostate ol a male individual or in the uterus of a female individual. The activation of the AR in bone can be assayed through stimulation of bone formation in a rodent model of osleopo.osis. and the antagonism of the AR in the prostate can be assayed through observation of minimal effects on prostate growth in castrated rodents and antagonism of p:ostate growth induced by AR agonists, as detailed in the I"Aamples,<br>
A further aspect of the present invention is concerned with compounds of slruclural formula 1 that block the function of the androgen receptor in the prostate of a male individual or in ihe uterus of a female individual induced by AR agonists, but not in hair-growing skin or vocal cords, and activate the function of the androgen receptor in bone and/or muscle tissue, but not in organs which control blood lipid levels (e.g. liver).<br>

In another embodiment, the compounds of the present Invention may be used to treat conditions in a female individual which are caused by androgen deficiency or which can be ameliorated by androgen replacement, including, but not limited to. osteoporosis, osteopenia, glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, postmenopausal symptoms, periodontal disease, HIV-wasting, cancer cachexia, obesity, aplastic and other anemias, musci.inr dystrophies, premature ovarian failure, and autoimmune disease, alone or in comoination with other active agents. Treatment is effected by administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of structural formula i to a female individual in need of such treatment.<br>
The compounds of structural formula I may also be employed as adjuncts to traditional pndrogen depletion therapy in the treatment of prostate cancer to restore bone, minimize: hone loss, and maintain or increase bone mineral density. In this manner, they may be employed together with traditional androgen deprivation therapy, including GnRH agonists/antagonists, such as those disclosed in P. Limonta, ct al., "LIIRH analogues as anticancer agents: phuitary and extrapituitary shes of action." lixp. Opin. Invest. Drugs. 10: 709-720 (2001); H.J. Strieker, ""Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ant^"-onists," Urology, 58 (Suppl. 2A): 24-27 (2001); R.P. Millar, et al., "Progress towa; is the development of non-peptide orally-active GnRll antagonists." British Medical Bulletin. 56: 761-772 (2000); and A.V. Schally et al., "Rational use of agonists and antagonists of LH-RH in the treatment of hormone-sensitive neoplasms and gynecologic conditions," Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews. 28: 157-169 (1997). It is also possible that the compounds of structural formula I may be used in combination with antiandrogens, such as flutamide, 2-hydroxyflutamide (the active metabolite of liutamide), nilutamide, and bicalutamide (Casodex™) in the treatment of prostate caii^cr.<br>
Further, tiie compounds of the present invention may also be employed in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, either for their androgen antagonist properties or as an adjunct to an ami androgen, such as flutamide, 2-hydroxynutamide (the active metabolite of flutamide,, nilutamide, and bicalutamide (Casodex^").<br>
Compounds of structural formula 1 have minimal negative effects on lipid metabolism, fji^rcfore, considering Iheir tissue selective androgen agonistic properties, the compounds of this invention have advantages over existing approaches<br><br>
for   hormone   rcplaci.r.ii-nl   therapy   in    hypogonadic   (androgen   deficient)   male individuals.<br>
Additionally, compounds of the present invention can increase the number of blood cell^, such as red blood cells and platelets, and can be used for treatment of hcmatopoi-^lic disorders, such as aplastic anemia.<br>

It is g"jTicrally preferable to administer compounds of the present invention in their cnantiomerically pure form. Racemic mixtures can be separated into their individual enanti^^mers by any of a number of conventional methods. These include chiral chromatography, derivatization with a chiral auxiliary followed by separation by chrom aography or crystallization, and fractional crystallization of diaslcrcomeric sails.<br>
As usee! herein, a compound of the present invention which functions as an "agonist" of the androgen receptor can bind to the androgen receptor and initiate a physiological or a pharmacological response characteristic of that receptor. The term "tissue-selective androgen receptor modulator" refers to an androgen receptor ligand thai mimics the actior of a natural ligand in some tissues but not in others. A "partial agonist" is an agonist "hich is unable to induce maximal activation of the receptor population, regardless i.&gt;rthe amount of compound applied. A "full agonist" induces full activation of the androgen receptor population at a given concentration. A compound of the preseni invention which functions as an "antagonist" of the androgen receptor can bind to the androgen receptor and block or inhibit the androgen-associated responses normally inciijced by a natural androgen receptor ligand.<br><br>
The te"-Li "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids including inorganic or organic bases and inn.ganic or organic acids.

For the reatment and prevention of osteoporosis, the compounds c&gt;f the present invention may be administered in combination with a bone-strengthening agent selected from antiresorptive agents, osieoanabolic agents, and other agents beneficial for the skeleton through mechanisms which arc not precisely defined, such as calcium supplements, flavonoids, and vitamin D analogs. The conditions of periodontal disease, bone fracture, and bone damage following bone reconstructive surgery may also benefit from thes^: combined treatments. For example, the compounds of the instant invention ma&gt; b:^ effectively administered in combination with effective amounts of other agents such as estrogens, bisphosphonates, SERMs, cathepsin K inhibitors, avp3 integrin receptor antagonists, vacuolar ATPase inhibitors, the polypeptide ostcoprotegcrin, antagonists of VEGF, thiazolidinediones, calcitonin, protein kinase inhibitoi.s, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and analogs, calcium receptor antagonists, growth hormone secretagogues, growth hormone releasing hormone, insulin-like growth facior. bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), inhibitors of BMP antagonism, prostaglandin derivatives, fibroblast growth factors, vitamin D and derivatives thereof, vitamin K and derivatives thereof, soy isoflavones, calcium salts, and fluoride salts. "1 lie conditions of periodontal disease, bone fracture, and bone damage following bonij reconstructive surgery may also benefit from these combined treatments. In one embodiment of the present invention, a compound of the instant invention may be effctJv^ly administered in combination with an effective amount of a bone-strengthening agem selected from estrogen or an estrogen derivative, alone or in combination with a progestin or progestin derivative; a bisphosphonate; an antiestrogen or a selcclive estrogen receptor modulator; an av|33 integrin receptor antagonist; a cathepsin K inhibitor: an osteoclast vacuolar ATPase inhibitor; calcitonin; and osteoprotegerin.<br>
In the ucatment of osteoporosis, the activity of the compounds of the present invention are distinct from that of the anti-resorptive agents: estrogens, bisphosphonates.   SFlRMs.   calcitonin,   cathepsin   K   inhibitors,   vacuolar   ATPase<br><br>
inhibitors, agents interfering with the RANK/RANKL/Osteoprotegerin pathway, p38 inhibitors or any other inhibitors of osteoclast generation or osteoclast activation. Rather than inhibiting bone resorption, the compounds of structural formula 1 stimulate bone Ibrmation. acting preferentially on cortical bone, which is responsible for a significant part of bene strength. The thickening of cortical bone substantially contributes to a reductioii in fracture risk, especially fractures of the hip. The combination of the tissue-selective androgen receptor modulators of structural formula I with anti-resorptive agents such as estrogen, bisphosphonatcs, anticstrogens, SERMs, calcitonin, «vp3 integrin receptor antagonists, MMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, vacuolar ATPasc inhibitors, and cathepsin K inhibitors is particularly useful because of the complementarity ofihe bone anabolic and antiresorptive actions.<br>
Bone anlircsportive agents are those agents which are known in the art to inhibit the resorption of bone and include, for example, estrogen and estrogen derivatives which include steroidal compounds having estrogenic activity such as, for example. 1 7P-estradiol, estrone, conjugated estrogen (PREMARIN®), equine estrogen. 17p-ethynyl estradiol, and the tike. The estrogen or estrogen derivative may be employed alone or in cnmbination with a progestin or progestin derivative. Nonlimiting examples of progestin derivatives are norethindrone and medroxy-progesterone acetate.<br>

Cathepsin K. formerly known as cathepsin 02, is a cysteine protease and is described in PCT International Application Publication No. WO 96/13523, published May 9, 1996; U.S. Patent No. 5,501.969, issued March 3. 1996; and U.S. Patent No. 5.736,357. issued Apr" 7. 1998, all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. Cysteine proteases, specifically cathepsins, are linked to a number of disease conditions. s&gt;:ch as tumor metastasis, inflammation, arthritis, and bone remodeling. At acidic pH"s, cathepsins can degrade type-I collagen. Cathepsin protease inhibitors can inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption by inhibiting the degradation of collagen fibers and are thus useful in the treatment of bone resorption diseases, such as osteoporosis.<br>
Members of the class of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, known as the "statins," have been fp:md to trigger the growth of new bone, replacing bone mass lost as a result of osteoporosis (see The Wall Street Journal. Friday, December 3, 1999. page IJl). Therefore, the statins hold promise for the treatment of bone resorption. I"Aamplcs of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors include statins in their lactonized or dihydroxy open acid terms and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters thereof including but not limited to lovastatin (see US Patent No. 4,342,767); simvastatin (see US Patent No. 4,4^"J,784); dihydroxy open-acid simvastatin, particularly the ammonium or calciun". -salts thereof; pravastatin, particularly the sodium salt thereof (see US Patent No, 4,346.227); fluvastatin, particularly the sodium salt thereof (see US Patent No. 5.354.772); atorva.statin, particularly the calcium salt thereof (see US Patent No. 5,273,995); ceriva"^tatin. particularly the sodium salt thereof (see US Patent No. 5,177.080), rosuvastatin. also known as ZD-4522 (see US Patent No. 5,260,440) and pitavastatin. also rcfirired to as NK-104, itavastatin, or nisvastatin (see PC"f international applicaiio;- publication number WO 97/23200).<br><br>
Osteoclast vacuolar ATPase inhibitors, also called proton pump inhibitors, may also be employed together with the tissue selective androgen receptor modulators of structural formula I. The proton ATPase which is found on the apical membrane of the osteoclast bas been reported to play a significant role in the bone resorption process. T"jreforc, this proton pump represents an attractive target for the design of inhibitors of bone resorption which are potentially useful for the treatment and prevention of osr:.oporosis and related metabolic diseases [see C. Farina el al., ■"Selective inhibitors of the osteoclast vacuolar proton ATPase as novel bone antiresorptive agents." F:»PT, 4: 163-172(1999)].<br>
rhe angiogenic factor VEGF has been shown to stimulate the bone-resorbing activity of (■■ jlatcd mature rabbit osteoclasts via binding to its receptors on osteoclasts [see M. Nakagawa el al., "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) directly enhances oslcuclastic bone resorption and survival of mature osteoclasis," 1"1-:BS Letters. 473: 161-164 (2000)]. Therefore, the developmem of antagonists of V1;GF binding to osteoclast receptors, such as KDR/Flk-1 and Flt-1, may provide yet a further approach to the treatment or prevention of bone resorption.<br>
Activators of the peroxisome proliferator-acttvated receplor-(PPAR ), such as the thiazolidinediones (TZD"s), inhibit osteoclast-like cell formation and bone resorption in vitro. Results reported by R. Okazaki et al. in l-indocrinoloiiv. 140: 6O60-5065 (1999) point to a local mechanism on bone marrow cells as well as a systemic one on glucose metabolism. Nonlimiling examples of PPAK activators include the glitazones, such as troglitazone, pioglilazone, rosiglilazonc, and BRl 49653.<br>
Calcitonin may also be employed together with the tissue selective androgen receptor modulator of structural formula 1. Calcitonin is preferentially employed as salmon nasal spray (Azra el al.. Calcitonin. 1996. In: J. P. Bilezikian, et al.. hd., Principles of Bone, Biology, San Diego: Academic Press; and Silverman, ■"Calcitonin." Rheumatic Disease Clinics of North America, 27: 187-196, 2001)<br>
Protein kinase inhibitors may also be employed together with the tissue selective androgen receptor modulators of structural formula I. Kinase inhibitors include those disclosed in WO 01/17562 and are in one embodiment selected from inhibitors of p38. Specific embodiments of p38 inhibitors useful in the present invention include SB 203580 [Badger et al., •Tharmacological profile of SB 203580, a selective inhibitor of cytokine suppressive binding protein/p38 kinase, in animal<br><br>
models of arthritis, bone resorption, endotoxin shock, and immune function," J, Pharmacol. Exn. Thcr.. 279: I453-I46I (1996)].<br>
OsteoanabcMc agents are those agents that are known in the art to build bone by increasing the production of the bone protein matrix. Such osteoanaboltc agcms include, for ex?iiple, the various forms of parathyroid hormone (PTH) such as naturally occurring TTH (1-84), PTH (1-34). analogs thereof, native or with substitutions and particularly parathyroid hormone subcutaneous injection. PTH has been found to increase the activity of osteoblasts, the cells that form bone, thereby promoting the synthesis of new bone (Modern Drup Discoverv. Vol. 3, No. 8, 2000), In studies reported at the lirst World Congress on Osteoporosis held in Chicago in June 2000, women in combined PTH-estrogen therapy exhibited a 12.8% increase in spinal bone mass and a 4.4% increase in total hip mass. Another study presented at the same meeting showed that PTl! could increase bone size as well as density. A clinical trial of the effect of the human parathyroid hormone 1-34 fragment [hPTH(l-34)] on postmenopausal osteoporotic women resulted in &gt;65% reduction in spine fractures and a 54% reduction in noiivertebral fractures, al^er a median of 22 months of treatment [see J.M. Hock, Bone. 27: 467-469 (2000) and S. Mohan, et al.. Bone. 27: 471-478 (20QQ), and references cited therein]. Thus, PTH and fragments thereof, such as hPTH(l-34). may prove to be efficacious in the treatment of osteoporosis alone or in combination with other agents, such as the tissue selective androgen receptor modulators of the pre;.":nt invention. An injectable recombinant form of human PTH, Forteo (teriparatide). hn^ received regulatory approval in the U.S. for the treatment of osteoporosis.<br>
Also usi.-ful in combination with the SARMs of the present invention are calcium receptor antagonists which induce the secretion of PTH as described by Gowen et al., in "Antagonizing the parathyroid calcium receptor stimulates parathyroid hormone secretion anu hone formation in osteopenic rats," J. Clin. Invest. 105: 1595-604 (2000).<br>

Trends Biotcchtiol-, 11: 379-383 (1993)].<br>
Inhibitors of BMP antagonism may also be employed together with the tissue selective androgen receptor modulators of structural formula I. BMP antagonist inhibitors are in one embodiitient selected from inhibitors of the BMP antagonists SOST. noggin, chordin gremlin, and dan [Massague and Chen, "Controlling TGF-bcta signaling," Genes Dev.. i -1: 627-644, 2000; Aspenberg et al., "~The bone morphogenetic<br><br>

Fibroblast growth factors may also be employed together with the tissue selective androgen receptor modulators of structural formula I. Fibroblast growth factors include aFGK. bFGF and related peptides with FGF activity [Hurley Florkiewicz, "Fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor families,"" 1996. In: J. P.

Dietary calcium supplements include calcium carbonate, calcium citrate, and naiui^l calcium salts [Heaney. Calcium. 1996. In: J. P, Bilezikian, et al., l:d.. Principles of Bone Biology, San Diego: Academic Press).<br>
Daily dosage ranges for bone resorption inhibitors, osteoanaboHc agents and other agents whicn may be used to benefit the skeleton when used in combination with a compound of structural formula 1 are those which are known in the art. In such combinations, generally the daily dosage range for the tissue selective androgen receptor modulator of si,-;.;ctural formula I is 0.01 to 1000 mg per adult human per day, more preferably" from 0,1 LO 200 mg/day. However, adjustments to decrease the dose of each agent may be made due to the increased efficacy of the combined agent.<br>
In particular, when a bisphosphonate is employed, dosages of 2.5 to 100 mg/day (measured as liic free bisphosphonic acid) are appropriate for treatment, more preferably 5 to 20 mg/day, especially about 10 mg/day. Prophylactically. doses of about 2.5 to about 10 mg/tiL; find especially about 5 mg/day should be employed. For reduction in sidc-effecis, it may be desirable to administer the combination of a compound of structural formula f and the bisphosphonate once a week.    For once<br><br>
weekly adminislralion. doses of about 15 mg to 700 mg per week of bisphosphonate and 0.07 to 7000 mg of a compound of structural formula I may be employed, either scparalcly. or in a coiribiiiexl dosage form.

Once the cells begin to slide off the flask, the complete media is added to kill the trypsin, "fhe cells are counted at this point, then diluted to the appropriate conccntralinn and split into flasks or dishes for further culturing (Usually 1:3 to 1:6 dilution).<br>
Preparation of MDA-MB-453 Cell Lysate<br>
When the MDA cells are 70 to 85% confluent, they arc detached as described above, and collected by centrifuging at 1000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The cell pellet is washed twice -viih TEGM (10 mM Tris-HCI, 1 mM EDTA. 10% glycerol. 1 mM bela-mercaptocth."innl, 10 mM Sodium Molybdate, pH 7.2).  After the final wash.<br><br>
the cells are rcsiispen,"•"H in TF.GM at a concentration of 107 cclls/mL. The cell suspension is snap froz-r. in liquid nitrogen or ethanol/dry ice bath and transferred to -80°C freezer on dry ice. Before setting up the binding assay, the frozen samples arc left on ice-water to jusl th iw (-1 hr). Then the samples are centrifuged at 12,500 g to 20,000 g for 30 min ct 4°C. The supernatant is used to set-up assay right away. If using 50 L of supernai^nt, the test compound can be prepared in 50 L of the TBGM buffer. Procedure^for Multiple Ccmpound Screening:<br>
Ix TEGM buffer is prepared, and the isotope-containing assay mixture is prepared in the following order: EtOH (2% final concentration in reaction). ^Ij-RI881 or 3H-DHT (G : nM final Cone, in reaction) and Ix TEGM. [eg. For 100 samples. 200 L (100 x 2) of EtOH + 4,25 L of 1:10 3H-R1881 stock + 2300 L (100 X 23) Ix TEGM I. i I.e compound is serially diluted, e.g., if starting final cone, is 1 M. and the compound is in 25 L of solution, for duplicate samples, 75 L of 4x1 M solution is made and 3 L of 100 M is added to 72 L of buffer, and 1:5 serial dilution.<br>
25 L o? -JH-RISSI trace and 25 L compound solution are first mixed together, followed by -iddition of 50 L receptor solution. The reaction is gently mixed, spun bricfiy at about 200 rpm and incubated at 4°C overnight. 100 L of 50% ilAP slurry is prepared and added to the incubated reaction which is then vortexed and incubated on ice for 5 to 10 minutes. The reaction mixture is vortexed twice more to resuspend HAI" while incubating reaction. The samples in 96-well format are then washed in wash buft""T using The FilterMate Universal Harvester plate washer (Packard). The washing process transfers HAP pellet containing ligand-bound expressed receptor to Unlfilter-96 GF/B filter plate (Packard). The HAP pellet on the filter plate is incubated with 50 L of MICROSCINT (Packard) scintillinl for 30 minutes before being counted on the TopCounl microscintillation counter (Packard). IC50S arc calculated using R1881 as a reference. Tissue selective androgen receptor modulators of the prcscni invention displayed IC50 values of 1 micromolar or less.<br>

6. In Vivo Prostate Asaa"<br>
Male SpiufaUC-Dawley rats aged 9-10 weeks, the earliest age of sexual maturity, are used in prevention mode. The goal is to measure the degree to which androgen-like eompoui.ds delay the rapid deterioration (—85%) of the ventral prostate gland and semina] vcsiccs that occurs during a seven day period after removal of the testes (orchiectomy |OUX)),<br>
Rats arc rrchieclomized (ORX). Each rat is weighed, then anesthetized by isofluranc gas that ia iTaintained to effect. A 1.5 cm anteroposterior incision is made in the scrotum. The right testicle is exteriorized. The spermatic artery and vas deferens are ligatcd with 4.0 sill 0.5cm proximal to the testicle. The testicle is freed by one cut of a small surgical scissors distal to the ligation site. The tissue stump is returned to the scrotum. The same i? repeated for the left testicle. When both stumps are returned to the scrotum, the scrotirr" and overlying skin are sutured closed with 4.0 silk. For Sham-ORX. all procedures -; "f^pling ligation and scissors cutting are completed. The rats fully recover consciousness and full mobility within 10-15 minutes.<br>
A dose ■ .test compound is administered subcutaneously or orally to the rac immediatelv alter the surgical incision is sutured. Treatment continues for an additional six consccui"ve days.<br><br>
Necropsy and l-.ndpoinLS:<br>
The rat !-&gt; Ilrst weighed, then anesthetized in a CO2 chamber until near death. Approximately 5ml whole blood is obtained by cardiac puncture. The rat is then examined for certain "gns of death and completeness of ORX. Next, the ventral portion of the prostate ,^jand is located and blunt dissected free in a highly stylized fashion. Ihe ventral r: jslale is blotted dry for 3-5 seconds and (hen weighed (VPW). Finally, the seminal vesitie is located and dissected free. The ventral seminal vesicle is blotted dry for 3-5 sccor"ds and then weighed (SVWT).<br>
Primary data for this assay are the weights of the ventral prostate and seminal vesicle. Sccoriary data include serum LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH {follicle stimulating hormone), and possible serum markers of bone formation and virilization. Data are :• -alyzed by ANOVA plus Fisher PLSD post-hoc test to identify intcrgroup differences, i lie extent to which test compounds inhibit ORX-induced loss of VPW and SVWT is f.^essed.<br>
7. In Vivo Bone Formation Assav:<br>
Female Sprague-Dawley rats aged 7-10 months are used in treatment mode to simulate aduli "luman females. The rats have been ovariectomized (OVX) 75-180 days previously, LU cause bone loss and simulate estrogen deficient, osteopenic adult human females. Pre-trcatment with a low dose of a powerful anti-resorptive. alendronate (0.0028mpk SC, 2X/wk) is begun on Day 0. On Day 15, treatment with test compound is started. Test compound treatment occurs on Days 15-31 with necropsy on Day 32. The goal is to measure the extent to which androgen-likc compounds increase ti.. amount of bone formation, shown by increased iluorochrome labeling, at the pcriost^-^jl surface.<br>
In a typical assay, nine groups of seven rats each are studied.<br>
On Days 19 and 29 (fifth and fifteenth days of treatment), a single subcutaneous injection of calcein (8mg/kg) is given to each rat.<br>
Necropsy and Endpoint."<br>
The rat i ■ I"lrst weighed, then anesthetized in a CO2 chamber until near death. Approximately 5mL whole blood is obtained by cardiac puncture. The rat is then examined for certain signs of death and completeness of OVX. First, the uterus is located, blunt dissected free in a highly stylized fashion, blotted dry for 3-5 seconds and<br><br>
then weighed (UW). The uterus is placed in 10% neuiral-buffcred formalin. Next, the right leg is disarticulated at the hip. The femur and tibia are separated at the knee, substantially dcflcshed, and then placed in 70% ethanol.<br>
A 1-cm .cgment of the central right femur, with the femoral proximal-dislal midpoini ats ceni-^:. is placed in a scintUiation vial and dehydrated and defatted in graded alcohols and acetone, then introduced to solutions with increasing concentrations of methyl methacrylate. It is embedded in a mixture of 90% methyl methacrylate :10% dibutyl phthalate, that is allowed to polymerize over a 48-72hr period. The bottle is cracked and the plastic block is trimmed into a shape that conveniently fits the \i.:e-like specimen holder of a Leica 1600 Saw Microtome, with the long axis of the bo-." prepared for cross-sectioning. Three cross-sections of 85)ini thickness are prepared and mounted on glass slides. One section from each rat that approximates the midpoint of the bone is selected and blind-coded. The periosteal surface of each section is assessed for total periosteal surface, single fluorochrome label, double fiuorochrome label, and interlabel distance.<br>
Primary "lata for this assay are the percentage of periosteal surface bearing double label J"^d the mineral apposition rate (interlabel distance{^lm)/10d). scmi-independcnt marker^ of bone formation. Secondary data include uterus weight and histologic features. Tertiary endpoints may include serum markers of bone formation and virilization. Data are analyzed by ANOVA plus Fisher PI.SD post-hoc test to idcntiiy intergroup differences. The extent to which lest compounds increase bone formation endpoi-:! are assessed.<br>
