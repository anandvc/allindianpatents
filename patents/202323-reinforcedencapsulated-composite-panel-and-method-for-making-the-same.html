				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
Wood Science &amp; Technology and further belongs to woodworking industry.<br>
PRIOR ART WITH SHORT COMINGS<br>
The problems associated with sub-floor moisture and liquid spillage on floorings and coverings using cellulose based foundation layer materials are well known. Currently available wooden flooring and laminate flooring using substrates like high density fibreboard, chipboard, plywood or solid lumber itself suffer from serious dimensional stability problems when exposed to high levels of humidity or to moisture while cleaning, during spillage of liquids etc. Although many manufacturers have adopted lock designs with minimal gap between planks, fluids still manage to seep through the joints. When the fluids seep through, the plank warps increasing the gaps and the problem then becomes cumulative and upwardly exponential. Application of waxes and protective coatings on the edges is not very effective against vapour as such coatings can only be applied very thin since thicker coatings distort the straight line edge finish of the flooring.<br>
While many products have appeared in the market recently, which use virgin or recycled thermoplastic vinyl substrates, such products are not only harmful to the environment, but also have low thermal stability, low hardness and poor impact resistance. The use of thermoplastic foundation layers for flooring and panels with higher thickness is limited due to the high cost of the resins. Lower thickness on the other hand lends itself to less dimensional stability of the flooring tiles or panels due to the reduced value of section modulus.<br>
Stone, cement and ceramic substrates are dimensionally stable as also moisture / vapour resistant. They are however available only in certain finishes due to processing limitations. Ceramic and stone substrates also have to be installed with 2-4 mm joints of filler material. Unlike wooden panels, commercially available ceramic and stone materials are not dimensionally precise due to the high costs to be incurred in calibrating and machining them.<br>
Although ceramic tiles with wood-like printed finishes have appeared in the market, the reproduction of the natural characteristics of wood is very poor. Such tiles have also to be laid with the 2-5 mm filler gaps and hence do not at all look like wooden planks when laid. Further, such tiles cannot be produced with inlays due to the high temperatures used in the glazing process during manufacture.<br>
It is known to those experienced in the art that directly using stone or ceramic substrates as foundation layers for wooden flooring/ wood inlay flooring is extremely difficult and expensive due to the hardness of these materials and high processing costs encountered in precisely calibrating and machining such materials. The substrate surfece should have an accuracy of 0.1 mm in order to achieve a durable adhesive joint. Ceramic and stone products are extremely hard necessitating the use of expensive abrasive materials for<br><br>
precise calibration. It is also extremely expensive to shape the edges of stone and ceramic foundation layer tiles with locking profiles and tongue-groove profiles. Meanwhile, providing a minimal hairline gap between panels is important for attaining better looks and aesthetic value for the flooring or wall panels.<br>
PROBLEMS WITH THE EXISTING ART<br>
Technical problem with the available panels are that they have high expansion coefficients, do not have structural and dimensional stability, do not have water and vapour resistance and move significantly with changes in temperature and humidity. As seen in: Alvin E.Witt et al., U.S Pat No. 5,976,689 discloses a Coated Synthetic Resin Board tile. This flooring uses a synthetic resin as a thin foundation foundation layer with a wood veneer decorative surface. In U.S. Pat No. 5,437,934 they disclose a Coated Cement Board Tile. While the cement board tile disclosed suffers from the serious setback that thickness calibration and edge processing is difficult and expensive, the former tile uses a high content of expensive synthetic resin and is particularly not suited for thicker panels due to economic and environmental reasons.<br>
Messner, U.S Pat No. 3,231,457 includes wood flooring in which a backing made from waste rubber is used as a foundation layer with a wood veneer surface. Elmendorf, U.S Pat No. 3,287,203 describes a plywood subfloor onto which is placed a tile having a wood fiber hardboard foundation, a natural wood layer and a vinyl resin coating.<br>
Hao et al., U.S Pat Application Publication No. US 2002 / 0142135 discloses a thermoplastic plank onto which is glued a laminate.<br>
Ill Hong Min., U.S Pat Application Publication No. US2003 / 0024637 discloses an abrasion resistant laminate formed on a polymeric substrate.<br>
PROPOSED TECHNICAL SOLUTION<br>
I propose a technical solution mentioned below, since none of known floor tile or panel methods provide the unique combination of using<br>
a.	Materials such as stone, cement tile, sand polymer concrete, ceramic &amp; reinforced<br>
cellulose based panel foundation layers, with;<br>
b.	A continuous high tensile strength encapsulation which reinforces the foundation<br>
layer, renders it water and vapour proof permits a cost effective process for<br>
precise calibration of the thickness of the panel and facilitates the easy and<br>
accurate profiling of the edges to produce an interlocking system between the<br>
panels with;<br>
c.	Decorative surfaces like wood, laminate, leather, metal and inlay.<br>
Further, none of the known floor tile or panel methods provide the unique combination of using thermally stable materials such as ceramic, cement tiles and stone with heat<br><br>
insulating materials like wood in the same panel with a water resistant encapsulation interface which can be sanded, calibrated and machined cost-effectively.<br>

FIG 1 illustrates one preferred embodiment of the invention. Here the cross section shows a cellulose based reinforced encapsulated composite panel with profiled edges, which is one embodiment of this invention. The foundation layer shown in this figure is made of a plurality of cellulose-based panels 11 but could also be made of one or more cellulose based panels. The foundation layer is reinforced with fiber meshes between the cellulose-based panels depicted by the dotted lines in the figure. If only one cellulose based panel is used as a foundation layer, then the fiber mesh is provided on one or both sides of that panel.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention comprises reinforced encapsulated composited panel and method for making the same. Reinforced encapsulated comprisite panel is durable, stable and vapour resistant panel ideally suited for wall cladding and floor covering applications. The preferred embodiments in the invention described herein are not intended to limit the scope of this invention, as it is well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The products of the invention are best illustrated by FIG 1. which not only depicts one preferred embodiment but also represents the general structure of the products produced with this invention. In FIG 1, thefoundation layer 11 shown is one made of a plurality of reinforced cellulose based panels, although it coukl be made of one or more ceramic tiles, stone tiles, cement tiles, polymer concrete tiles or cellulose based panels in other<br><br>
embodiments. The foundation layers are inevitably reinforced so as to build tensile strength (MOE) and flexural strength (MOR) , The reinforcement is done using a resin matrix, which necessarily consists of fiber, meshes or chopped fiber strands. When cellulose based panels such as plywood, hardboard, LVL and fiberboard are used as the foundation layer, they have to be reinforced so as to provide thermo hygroscopic stability. When ceramic tiles, sand polymer concrete tiles, cement tiles or stone tiles are used as foundation layers, they have to be reinforced so as to improve their modulus of rupture (MOR) properties and breaking strength during drop tests. The term ceran:uc tiles<br><br><br>
used is a laminate, the laminate itself comes with an abrasion resistant coating. The encapsulation 7 is then edge profiled so as to form a panel interlock mechanism.<br>
FIG.la &amp; FIG.lb illustrate the general process for manufacture of the preferred embodiment of this invention. The reinforced encapsulated composite panel consist of 5 layers in three-dimensional space. The stratum, which provides structural support and integrity to the product, is the foundation layer. In the preferred embodiment of this invention, the foundation layer is selected from the group consisting of sand polymer concrete tiles, natural stone tiles, ceramic tiles, cement tiles and reinforced cellulose based panel.<br>
In the subsequent figures viz. FIG 2 to FIG 17, the Foundation Layers produced using ceramic tiles, stone tiles, cement tiles, sand polymer concrete tiles are marked as 10, while the Foundation Layers produced using cellulosed based panels are marked as 11. It should be noted that irrespective of the type of foundation layer being used, the ensuing processes of encapsulation and reinforcement, calibration, bonding of decorative layer, encapsulation of decorative layer and application of abrasion resistant coating and machining of edge profiles remain the same for all preferred embodiments of this invention.<br><br><br>
Cellulose based panels of thickness 2 to 25 mm can be used although 3mm to 5 mm thick panels are preferred. Sheets of the selected cellulose based panels are sanded preferably with Grit 60 Aluminium Oxide sandpaper in a wide belt sander. A resin mixture is prepared from about 20% to 60% by weight of unsaturated polyester resin, 39% to 80% by weight of filler and 1% to 2% by weight of methyl ethyl ketone peroxide catalyst. The preferred unsaturated polyester resins are Mechster sold by Mechemco Industries or Norpol sold by Reichhold Chemicals Inc or similar. The preferred unsaturated polyester resins should have a Tensile Strength (filled) of more than 30 MPa, Flexural Strength (filled) of more than 55 MPa, Barcol Hardness (filled) of more than 50 and a Heat Deflection Temperature of more than 85 C. Any other thermo set or thermoplastic resin can be used as long as it cures to a solid that can be worked on and is moisture resistant. Other additives such as dispersing agents, air release agents and inhibitors are added in a conventional manner.<br><br><br>
In another embodiment of this invention, sand polymer concrete tiles are used as foundation layer . Sand polymer concrete tiles can be cast in thick nesses as low as 5 mm. However, the thickness of the tile has to be increased while casting large format tiles. For example, for al200 x 600 mm tile, the thickness would have to be at least 6 mm in order to maintain enough rigidity and breaking strength. In the preferred embodiment, a homogeneous  mixture  of sand,  imsaturated polyester resin.  Methyl Ethyl  Ketone<br><br><br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention ceramic tiles are used as the foundation layer 10 as shown in FIG.6 and FIG.7. Ceramic tiles are manufactured commercially by compressing clay and firing the bisques at high temperatures. They are extremely stable and water resistant. When large format ceramic tiles are not available, small format ceramic tiles can be arranged as an array. In one preferred embodiment of this invention, an array of small format ceramic tiles are placed together and encapsulated in order to produce a large format reinforced encapsulated foundation layer. A bottom view of this embodiment is illustrated in FIG. 16. While unglazed ceramic tiles are preferred, glazed ceramic tiles with rough surface finish on the glazing can also be used as foundation<br><br><br>
In the preferred embodiments of this invention which use one of ceramic tiles, cement tiles, sand polymer concrete tile or natural stone tiles as foundation layers, the encapsulation is put on the face and the four edges of the foundation layer. The encapsulation caps the foundation layer 10 as shown in FIG.6 and reinforces it. In the preferred embodiments of this invention which use reinforced cellulose based panels 11 as foundation layers, the encapsulation 7 is put on all the four edges as shown in FIG.8. The encapsulation thus forms a continuous waterproof reinforcing band around the foundation layer with no joints or breaks.<br><br><br>
30 MPa, Flexural Strength (filled) of more than 55 MPa, Barcol Hardness (filled) of more than 50 and a Heat Deflection Temperature of more than 85 C. Any other thermoset or thermoplastic resin can be used as long as it cures to a solid than can be worked on and is moisture resistant. Other additives such as dispersing agents, air release agents and inhibitors are added in a conventional manner.<br><br><br><br>
Cold pressing is preferred in this invention in order to maximize the stability of the panels. While hot pressing at temperatures of 75C or less is also possible, hot pressing requires the use of balancing layers and also increases the probability of cupping or doming of the finished panels.<br><br><br>
The inventive steps as detailed herein provide an effective means of combining materials, which are chemically, physically and mechanically different from one another. When combined together though, the end products are very stable, aesthetically pleasing and novel.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A feature of the present invention is to provide dimensionally stable water and vapour resistant reinforced encapsulated composite panels, which are not susceptible to damage by moisture.<br>
Another feature of this invention is to provide a panel that is economically feasible and easy to install.<br>
Another feature of this invention is that it uses one of stone, ceramic, cement, sand polymer concrete or cellulose foundation layers with a decorative surface chosen from or a combination of wood, and leather while permitting easy calibration, edge profiling and facilitating a panel interlocking system.<br>
Another feature of this invention is the it provides panels with waterproof edges, which are dimensionally precise, and those, which can be installed with minimal gaps between panels so as to maximize visual appeal.<br>
Yet another feature of this invention is that it provides panels with a lock profile on the waterproof edges such that they can be locked closely with one another and also be laid as floating installations i.e. without adhering them to the sub-floor.<br>
Another feature of this invention is to provide innovative ceramic tile panels that bear structural similarity to glazed ceramic tiles so that they can be installed simultaneously so as to create novel wall and flooring designs.<br>
Also a feature of this inventk)n is to permit a wide range of installation methods i.e. floating installation, tile glue method, cement mortar method or combinations of these methods on a wide range of surfaces including those with existing floors.<br>
Yet another feature of this invention is that moisture resistant wooden flooring panels, which can be installed alongside stone and ceramic tiles using the same installation method, can be produced.<br>
Another feature of this invention is that since the panels can be installed with minimal gaps between them, it permits use in areas like kitchens where hygiene is of prime importance.<br><br>
Yet another feature of this invention is that wood and wooden veneer panels, which can be used in moisture-laden areas like bathrooms can be produced.<br>
A very important feature of this invention is that it enables the combination of moisture resistant thermally stable materials like ceramic with insulating materials like wood. This combination demonstrates exceptional performance in applications where under floor heating is instaDed.<br>
The thermally stable encapsulated ceramic foundation layer protects the upper wooden decorative and insulating layer from large thermal gradients rendering stability and minimal movement to the flooring installation.<br><br><br>
cure for 5-7 days with frequent watering to allow full cure. After curing, the tiles are allowed to stabilize for 4-5 days in a dry area. After the tiles have stabilized, they are encapsulated on the sides and face as described earlier in the case of panels described in the first embodiment. Further processing is also similar to the panels described in the first embodiment.<br>
In yet another embodiment of this invention, the foundation layer is a sand polymer concrete tile. Sand polymer concrete tiles are cast on molds by mixing sand, unsaturated polyester resin, catalyst and filler material with glass fibre mat used as reinforcement. The tiles are allowed to cure overnight and encapsulated on the sides and face. Further processing is similar to that described for the panels in the first embodiment.<br><br><br>
installed alongside stone and ceramic tiles. The same product with an abrasion resistant wear layer is ideal for use as flooring panels. With a wooden decorative layer of thickness between 0.6 mm and 25 mm, and an abrasion resistant wear layer, these panels would be a superior alternative to engineered wood floors.<br><br><br>
COMMERCIAL VIABILITY<br>
There is now an ever-increasing demand from consumers for innovative floor and wall<br>
coverings,   which  are   aesthetically  pleasing  while  being  dimensionally  stable  and<br>
moisture   resistant.   Consumers   are   also   becoming   increasingly   conscious   of the<br>
environment and are also demanding more environment-fiiendly products all over the<br>
world. Reinforced encapsulated composite panel is durable, stable and vapour resistant<br>
panel ideally suited for wall cladding and floor covering applications.<br>
The use of a plurality of decorative layer combinations such as wood with metal inlays<br>
and vice versa, wood with leather, wood and metal with ahalone inlays, pearl finish<br>
inlays, resin inlays and such, shall enhance its marketability.<br>
Products described  in these  embodiments can find use even in extreme  service<br>
environments such as spas, saunas and swimming pool areas.<br><br><br><br>
