				<td>GROUPING OF USER TERMINAL CELL ACCESS INFORMATION IN A<br>
SYSTEM INFORMATION BLOCK<br>
The invention relates to a method for generating and<br>
transmitting system information, a network device, a<br>
method for verifying if a mobile radio user device is<br>
provided with access to a mobile radio cell, a mobile<br>
radio user device and a method for determining valid<br>
system information.<br>
A base station of a cellular mobile radio communication<br>
network transmits, in a mobile radio cell, system<br>
information which enables the mobile radio user devices<br>
located in the mobile radio cell to use the mobile<br>
radio communication network. Efficient methods for<br>
transmitting this system information are desirable.<br>
A method for generating and transmitting system<br>
information in a mobile radio cell is provided, in<br>
which method system information is grouped to form<br>
several information blocks, the information required<br>
for a mobile radio user device in order to verify if<br>
said user device is provided with access to the mobile<br>
radio cell being grouped into a single one of the<br>
information blocks, at least one information message is<br>
formed from the information blocks, the information<br>
message is supplied to a unit of the data link layer by<br>
a unit of the network layer and the unit of the data<br>
link layer transmits the information message by means<br>
of at least one unit of the physical layer.<br>

exemplary embodiment of the invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows a data flowchart.<br><br>
Figure 3 shows a system information block according to<br>
an exemplary embodiment of the invention.<br>
Figure 4 shows a data structure according to an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the invention.<br>
Figure 5 shows a sequence diagram according to an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the invention.<br>
Figure 6 shows a data flowchart according to an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the invention.<br>
In cellular mobile radio communication systems such as,<br>
for example, mobile radio communication systems<br>
according to the GSM (Global System for Mobile<br>
Communications) standard or the UMTS (Universal Mobile<br>
Telecommunications System) standard, important system<br>
information of a mobile radio cell, that is to say<br>
system information which is required for operating a<br>
mobile radio user device in the mobile radio cell, is<br>
conveyed by broadcasting from a base station which<br>
operates the mobile radio cell to all mobile radio user<br>
devices which are located in the mobile radio cell.<br>
This system information is, for example, network<br>
operator-specific information such as the identity of<br>
the mobile radio network to which the mobile radio cell<br>
belongs, for example a PLMN (Public Land Mobile<br>
Network) identity, and the identity of the mobile radio<br>
cell (cell identity) or other information which is<br>
suitable for an unambiguous configuration of mobile<br>
radio network and/or mobile radio cells.<br>
According to an exemplary embodiment of the invention,<br>
a method for generating and transmitting system<br>
information in a mobile radio cell is provided, in<br>
which method system information is grouped to form<br>
several information blocks, the information required<br>
for a mobile radio user device in order to verify if<br>
said user device is provided with access to the mobile<br><br>
radio cell being grouped into a single one of the<br>
information blocks, at least one information message is<br>
formed from the information blocks, the information<br>
message is supplied to a unit of the data link layer by<br>
a unit of the network layer and the unit of the data<br>
link layer transmits the information message by means<br>
of at least one unit of the physical layer.<br>
According to a further exemplary embodiment of the<br>
invention, a method for verifying if a mobile radio<br>
user device is provided with access to a mobile radio<br>
cell is provided in which method it is determined in<br>
which information block of a multiplicity of<br>
information blocks transmitted in the mobile radio cell<br>
the information required for the mobile radio user<br>
device in order to verify if said user device is<br>
provided with access to the mobile radio cell is<br>
transmitted, the information block is received before<br>
other information blocks of the multiplicity of<br>
information blocks are received, and it is verified if<br>
access to the mobile radio cell is provided for the<br>
mobile radio user device before other information<br>
blocks of the multiplicity of information blocks are<br>
received.<br>
According to other exemplary embodiments of the<br>
invention, a network device and a mobile radio user<br>
device according to the method, described above, for<br>
generating and transmitting system information in a<br>
mobile radio cell and respectively the method,<br>
described above, for verifying if a mobile radio user<br>
device is provided with access to a mobile radio cell<br>
are provided.<br>
To illustrate, all of the system information needed by<br>
a mobile radio user device for being able to decide<br>
whether it can successfully register in a mobile radio<br>
cell, that is to say all suitability information of the<br>
system information, is grouped to form one information<br><br>
block. In this manner, it is only necessary that the<br>
mobile radio user device reads in this information<br>
block in order to be able to decide whether it should<br>
attempt to register in the mobile radio cell.<br>
Compared with the procedure of conveying the<br>
suitability information in different information<br>
blocks, the reception of the suitability information<br>
and thus the deciding whether a mobile radio cell is<br>
suitable for a registration can be accelerated. This<br>
makes it possible to reduce the time needed by a mobile<br>
radio user device for finding a mobile radio cell in<br>
which it can register. Finally, the mobile radio user<br>
device can successfully register in a mobile radio cell<br>
after a shorter time and set up a communication link to<br>
a base station.<br>
According to another exemplary embodiment of the<br>
invention, a method for determining valid system<br>
information by a mobile radio user device is provided,<br>
in which method an configuration transmitted in a<br>
mobile radio cell is received which identifies a set of<br>
information required for the mobile radio user device<br>
in order to verify if said user device is provided with<br>
access to the mobile radio cell, which set of<br>
information is currently valid in the mobile radio<br>
cell, and in the case where the set of information is<br>
stored, it is verified by means of the stored set of<br>
information if the mobile radio user device is provided<br>
with access to the mobile radio cell.<br>
In this manner, it is not necessary that the mobile<br>
radio user device receives information but can use the<br>
stored information which leads to a further gain in<br>
time. A stored set of information can also be marked<br>
with a validity period which specifies until when it is<br>
valid for the configuration, in other words is<br>
identified by this configuration. In this case, the<br>
stored set of information is used for verifying if the<br><br>
mobile radio user device is provided with access to the<br>
mobile radio cell only when the set of information is<br>
still valid for the configuration. The configuration<br>
can be transmitted, for example, in a master<br>
information block (MIB). To illustrate, it can be<br>
signaled in a master information block which (possibly)<br>
stored set of information is currently valid in the<br>
mobile radio cell.<br>
The mobile radio cell is a mobile radio cell of a<br>
mobile radio network which is configured, for example,<br>
in accordance with the UMTS standard, the GSM standard,<br>
the CDMA2000 (Code Division Multiple Access) standard<br>
or the FOMA (Freedom of Mobile Access) standard.<br>
The information message is, for example, a PDU (Packet<br>
Data Unit) which is supplied to the RLC layer from the<br>
RRC layer. The information message is a system<br>
information message in one embodiment.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the invention can be<br>
implemented both in software, hardware and mixed form<br>
(that is to say partially software, partially<br>
hardware) .<br>
The further embodiments of the invention which are<br>
described in conjunction with the method for generating<br>
and transmitting system information in a mobile radio<br>
cell correspondingly also apply to the method for<br>
verifying if a mobile radio user device is provided<br>
with access to a mobile radio cell, to the mobile radio<br>
user device and to the method for determining valid<br>
system information.<br>
The information blocks are, for example, a master<br>
information block (or several master information<br>
blocks) or system information blocks.<br><br>
The information block, into which the information<br>
required for the mobile radio user device in order to<br>
verify if said user device is provided with access to<br>
the mobile radio cell is grouped, is, for example, a<br>
master information block. The information block, into<br>
which the information required for the mobile radio<br>
user device in order to verify if said user device is<br>
provided with access to the mobile radio cell is<br>
grouped, can also be a system information block.<br>
The unit of the data link layer is, for example, a unit<br>
of the RLC (Resource Link Control) layer and the unit<br>
of the network layer is, for example, a unit of the RRC<br>
(Radio Resource Control) layer.<br>
In one embodiment, the information block, into which<br>
the information required for the mobile radio user<br>
device in order to verify if said user device is<br>
provided with access to the mobile radio cell is<br>
grouped, does not contain any other information. Since<br>
the information block is thus reduced to its minimum<br>
size, it can be read in very rapidly as part of a<br>
verification if the mobile radio cell is suitable for a<br>
registration.<br>
The system information is transmitted, for example, by<br>
a base station which operates the mobile radio cell.<br>
The unit of the data link layer is arranged, for<br>
example, in the base station. The unit of the network<br>
layer can also be arranged in the base station.<br>
In one embodiment, the information required for the<br>
mobile radio user device in order to verify if said<br>
user device is provided with access to the mobile radio<br>
cell is associated with an configuration, which<br>
enables the mobile radio user device to verify if it<br>
has already stored the information and which signals<br>
that the information identified by the configuration<br>
is currently valid in the mobile radio cell.<br><br>
For example, the configuration is inserted into the<br>
information block into which the information required<br>
for the mobile radio device in order to verify if said<br>
user device is provided with access to the mobile radio<br>
cell is grouped.<br>
The information can also be provided with validity-<br>
period information which specifies how long the<br>
configuration for the information is valid. This<br>
prevents the possible configurations available (for<br>
example from 0 to 63, that is to say 6 bits) from being<br>
issued completely to sets of information and new sets<br>
of information can no longer be provided with an<br>
configuration.<br>
Figure 1 shows a communication system 100 according to<br>
an exemplary embodiment of the invention.<br>
The communication system 100 has the architecture of a<br>
UMTS radio network, which is also called UMTS<br>
Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN).<br>
The communication system 100 has a multiplicity of<br>
radio network subsystems (RNS) 101, 102 which are in<br>
each case coupled to the UMTS core network 105 by means<br>
of an Iu interface 103, 104.<br>
The RNS 101, 102 in each case has a radio network<br>
controller (RNC) 107, 108 and one or more base stations<br>
109, 110, 111, 112. A UMTS base station is also called<br>
node B.<br>
The RNCs 107, 108 of different RNS 101, 102 are coupled<br>
to one another by means of an Iur interface 113.<br>
Each base station 109, 110, 111, 112 of an RNS 101, 102<br>
is coupled to the RNC 107, 108 of the RNS 101, 102 by<br>
means of an Iub interface 126, 127, 128, 129. Each base<br><br>
station 109, 110, 111, 112 of an RNS 101, 102 operates<br>
one or more mobile radio cells (CE) 114 to 125 within<br>
the RNS 101, 102 by radio engineering means. The RNC<br>
107, 108 of an RNS 101, 102 monitors the allocation of<br>
radio resources of the mobile radio cells 114 to 125 in<br>
the RNS 101, 102.<br>
Between a base station 109, 110, 111, 112 and a mobile<br>
radio user device (user equipment, UE) 106 in a mobile<br>
radio cell 114 to 125, information signals and data<br>
signals are transmitted by means of radio transmission<br>
technology by means of an air interface (Uu) 13 0. For<br>
example, a separate signal transmission in the uplink<br>
direction and downlink direction is achieved by a<br>
corresponding separate assignment of frequencies or<br>
frequency ranges in the FDD (Frequency Division Duplex)<br>
mode. Uplink is understood to be the signal<br>
transmission from the mobile radio user device 106 to a<br>
base station 109, 110, 111, 112 and downlink is<br>
understood to be the signal transmission from a base<br>
station 109, 110, 111, 112 to the mobile radio user<br>
device 106. The signals to different mobile radio user<br>
devices and from different mobile radio user devices in<br>
the same mobile radio cell are separated, for example,<br>
by means of orthogonal codes, for example by means of<br>
the so-called CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)<br>
method.<br>
In the mobile radio cells 114 to 125, system<br>
information relating to the operation of mobile radio<br>
user devices in the respective mobile radio cell are<br>
transmitted by means of the logical broadcast control<br>
channel (BCCH). The logical BCCH channel is mapped onto<br>
the transport channel BCH (Broadcast Channel) and<br>
physically transmitted by means of the physical channel<br>
P-CCPCH (Primary Common Control Physical Channel) by<br>
means of the air interface. This is illustrated in<br>
figure 2.<br><br>
Figure 2 shows a data flowchart 200.<br>
System information bits are transmitted to system<br>
information blocks 203 of in each case 246 bits by<br>
means of the BCCH 201 and the BCH 202. The system<br>
information blocks 203 are transmitted to the physical<br>
layer for sending out by means of the physical channel<br>
P-CCPCH 204 and are supplemented with a word, for<br>
example of 26 bits length, for error recognition<br>
according to the CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check). The<br>
information bits and the bits appended for error<br>
recognition are jointly channel-coded in the physical<br>
layer, modulated and spread with a CDMA code, known<br>
throughout the system, with the spreading factor<br>
SF = 256. Since a fixed transmission time interval<br>
(TTI) of 20 ms is defined (TTI = 20 ms) for the BCH,<br>
the channel-coded bits are broadcast by means of two<br>
P-CCPCH transmit frames 205 in two blocks with in each<br>
case a length of 20 ms by means of the air interface in<br>
the respective mobile radio cell.<br>
The format of the system information blocks 203 will be<br>
explained with reference to figure 3 in the text which<br>
follows.<br>
Figure 3 shows a system information block (SIB) 300<br>
according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention.<br>
The system information block 3 00 has a system frame<br>
number (SFN) 301 which consists of 12 bits. The system<br>
frame number is followed by SIB data 3 02 which contains<br>
system information and consists of 234 bits. The system<br>
frame number 301 specifies the timing used in the<br>
respective mobile radio cell and is used for<br>
synchronization between base station and mobile radio<br>
user device.<br>
The system information block in which certain system<br>
information is transmitted is decided on the basis of<br><br>
the type of system information. Apart from the system<br>
information blocks, master information blocks (MIB) and<br>
scheduling blocks (SB) are also transmitted, in the<br>
present exemplary embodiment in the same way as has<br>
been explained with reference to figure 2 for the<br>
system information blocks. In a master information<br>
block, for example, the PLMN identify of the mobile<br>
radio network is transmitted, and scheduling<br>
information with respect to the transmission of the<br>
system information blocks. In the scheduling blocks,<br>
scheduling information with respect to the system<br>
information blocks is also signaled.<br>
In a UMTS mobile radio network, 18 types of system<br>
information blocks are defined. The allocation of<br>
certain system information to system information<br>
blocks, that is to say the allocation of which system<br>
information block contains which system information, is<br>
as follows, for example:<br>
SIB 1 contains information about the UMTS core<br>
network and information on configuration of<br>
system-related timers and constants.<br>
SIB 3 contains parameter values which are<br>
required for selecting mobile radio cells and<br>
for the change of mobile radio cell by a mobile<br>
radio user device.<br>
SIB 5 contains information about the<br>
configuration of the common physical radio<br>
resources for mobile radio user devices which<br>
are in rest mode (ideal mode).<br>
SIB 6 contains information on the configuration<br>
of the common physical radio resources for<br>
mobile radio user devices which are in<br>
connected mode.<br>
SIB 11 contains information for carrying out<br>
measurements.<br><br>
In the system information block with the number 16,<br>
parameters of the so-called "predefined configurations"<br>
are transmitted which have radio bearer parameters,<br>
transport channel parameters and physical channel<br>
parameters. When a signaling connection is set up, a<br>
mobile radio user device signals to the UMTS radio<br>
access network (UTRAN) an item of information called<br>
"predefined configuration value tag". This signals to<br>
the mobile radio network that the mobile radio user<br>
device has stored the "predefined configurations"<br>
contained in the system information block having the<br>
number 16. In the RRC connection setup message, the<br>
UMTS radio access network signals to the mobile radio<br>
user device which predefined configuration is to be<br>
used, in the form of the so-called "predefined<br>
configuration identity". From UMTS in Version Release 5<br>
onward, an analogous procedure is also possible for the<br>
"radio bearer reconfiguration" procedure.<br>
Furthermore, default configurations can be provided for<br>
RAB (Radio Access Bearer) and signaling connections.<br>
These default configurations are permanently stored in<br>
mobile radio user devices. Instead of a complete list<br>
of parameters for setting up an RAB or a signaling<br>
connection, the UMTS radio access network can transmit<br>
to a mobile radio user device a so-called "default<br>
configuration identity" which specifies a default<br>
configuration (this is possible from UMTS in Version<br>
Release 6 onward). Default configurations are used for<br>
the "Handover to UTRAN" procedure in UMTS in Version<br>
R99 (Release 1999) and for the "RRC Connection Setup"<br>
and "Radio Bearer Reconfiguration" procedures in UMTS<br>
in Version Release 5.<br>
So that a mobile radio user device can correctly use a<br>
mobile radio network, it ensures that it has received<br>
the current system information in the mobile radio cell<br>
in which it is located. If the amount of system<br>
information which must be read in is very large,<br><br>
however, the reception and the reading in of the system<br>
information is correspondingly time-intensive for the<br>
mobile radio user devices. This is of disadvantage<br>
particularly in the case of the system information<br>
which specifies whether a mobile radio cell is suitable<br>
for a mobile radio user device, which will be called<br>
suitability information in the text which follows.<br>
Reading in the suitability information is necessary for<br>
a mobile radio user device whenever it would like to<br>
change to another mobile radio cell (cell reselection)<br>
and when the mobile radio user device is switched on.<br>
According to one exemplary embodiment of the invention,<br>
all suitability information is transmitted in the<br>
master information block so that the reading in of the<br>
suitability information can be carried out efficiently<br>
and rapidly. In one embodiment, apart from the<br>
suitability information, no other information is<br>
transmitted in the master information block. All<br>
scheduling information is transmitted in the scheduling<br>
blocks. The size of the master information block can be<br>
reduced in this manner and the time required for<br>
reading in the master information block can be<br>
correspondingly reduced.<br>
The suitability information is, for example:<br>
the PLMN identity, that is to say an<br>
configuration of the mobile radio network to<br>
which the mobile radio cell belongs<br>
the LAC (Local Area Code) , that is to say a<br>
code of the mobile radio network<br>
Qqualmin, an item of information on the minimum<br>
quality level required in the mobile radio cell<br>
in decibels<br>
Qrxlevmin, an item of information of the<br>
minimum receiver level in the mobile radio cell<br>
in dBm<br>
an item of information on the maximum<br>
permissible transmitting power on the uplink<br><br>
cell barred information, for example a cell bar<br>
bit, which indicates if the mobile radio cell<br>
is barred for mobile radio user devices (for<br>
example mobile radio user devices without<br>
particular privileges),<br>
an intrafrequency cell reselection indicator<br>
which specifies if the mobile radio user device<br>
can dial into the mobile radio cell by using<br>
the same frequency as in the mobile radio cell<br>
previously used by the mobile radio user device<br>
the value of the Tfc,arred parameter, which<br>
specifies how long a mobile radio user device<br>
should remove the mobile radio cell from its<br>
list of adjacent mobile radio cells when the<br>
mobile radio cell is identified as barred<br>
the information regarding if the mobile radio<br>
cell is reserved for use by the operator of the<br>
mobile radio network (cell reserved for<br>
operator use)<br>
an item of information regarding if the mobile<br>
radio cell is reserved for a future extension<br>
of the mobile radio network (cell reservation<br>
extension).<br>
As mentioned, the suitability information is<br>
transmitted, for example, in the master information<br>
block. The master information block is correspondingly<br>
arranged, for example in accordance with Table 1. Other<br>
information which is transmitted in the master<br>
information block in conventional mobile radio<br>
communication networks is transmitted by means of the<br>
scheduling blocks or by means of system information<br>
blocks in one exemplary embodiment. For example, all<br>
scheduling information which relates to system<br>
information blocks and which have been transmitted in<br>
the master block in conventional mobile radio networks<br>
are transmitted by means of the scheduling blocks in<br>
one exemplary embodiment.<br><br><br><br><br>
According to a further exemplary embodiment of the<br>
invention, the entire suitability information is<br>
transmitted within a system information block which is<br>
sent, for example, in fixed time association with the<br>
master information block. This means that it is<br>
specified after how much time after transmission of the<br>
master information block the system information block<br>
is sent out by the base station.<br>
For example, the system information block is	always<br>
sent out by means of a time frame of 10 ms in	length<br>
which follows a time frame in which the	master<br>
information block has been sent out.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment of the invention,<br>
default values are used for the system information.<br>
This means that a mobile radio user device stores<br>
default configurations (stored configurations), that is<br>
to say possible values for the system information, for<br>
example possible arrangements of system information<br>
blocks, the possible system information being provided<br>
with an configuration, for example with a stored<br>
configuration ID, for example a number between 1 and N.<br>
According to one exemplary embodiment of the invention,<br>
this is applied for the suitability information and<br>
will be explained in greater detail with reference to<br>
figure 4 in the text which follows.<br><br>
Figure 4 shows a data structure 4 00 according to an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the invention.<br>
The data structure 400 is stored in a mobile radio user<br>
device and is used for storing standard configurations<br>
for the suitability information. That is to say,<br>
possible valid values for the suitability information<br>
are stored in the form of the data structure 400 in the<br>
mobile radio user device.<br>
The data structure 400 has several sets of suitability<br>
information 401. Each set of suitability information<br>
4 01 contains values for the parameters corresponding to<br>
the suitability information, that is to say, for<br>
example, for the abovementioned parameters of the<br>
values of which the suitability information consists.<br>
The sets of suitability information specify suitability<br>
information which may be valid in a mobile radio cell.<br>
Each set of suitability information 401 is provided<br>
with a suitability information configuration 402 so<br>
that reference can be made to each set of suitability<br>
information 401.<br>
Instead of transmitting the complete suitability<br>
information to the mobile radio user device, a base<br>
station, if the suitability information, which is valid<br>
in the mobile radio cell operated by the base station<br>
corresponds to one of the sets of suitability<br>
information 401, can transmit only the suitability<br>
information configuration to the mobile radio user<br>
device in order to signal to the mobile radio user<br>
device which suitability information is valid in the<br>
mobile radio cell.<br>
For example, the date structure 400 has maximally N<br>
sets of suitability information 401. Correspondingly,<br>
the suitability information configuration has, for<br>
example, values from 1 to N. Storing default values for<br>
the suitability information, for example in the form of<br><br>
the data structure 400, is efficient and not very-<br>
complex compared with information which, for example,<br>
characterizes the structure of a radio bearer for a<br>
radio bearer setup.<br>
While when storing the configuration of a radio bearer<br>
(RAB configuration) with a suitable indexing, so that<br>
during the setting up of a radio bearer the<br>
configuration of a radio bearer can be rapidly accessed<br>
by using an index and thus the setting up of a radio<br>
bearer can be accelerated, a considerable complexity<br>
arises due to the high volume of data of the parameters<br>
required for describing a radio bearer, this is not the<br>
case when storing default configurations for<br>
suitability information and default values for<br>
suitability information can be administered efficiently<br>
and with little complexity.<br>
Apart from the lesser volume of data of the suitability<br>
information compared with parameters which are required<br>
for describing a radio bearer, the reason for this is<br>
that the suitability information changes less<br>
frequently compared with RAB configurations.<br>
For example, the data structure 400 is built up by the<br>
suitability information sent out by the base stations<br>
being sent out together with a suitability information<br>
configuration 402, and the mobile radio user device<br>
stores the suitability information sent out in the form<br>
of a set of suitability information 401 together with<br>
the suitability information configuration 402 in the<br>
data structure 400. In this context, the suitability<br>
information can be sent out in such a manner that the<br>
suitability information is transmitted all together in<br>
a master information block, the suitability information<br>
is transmitted all together in a system information<br>
block or the suitability information can also be<br>
transmitted distributed over several system information<br>
blocks. If a base station sends out suitability<br><br>
information together with a suitability information<br>
configuration, the mobile radio user device can check<br>
the data structure 4 00 and determine by means of the<br>
suitability information configurations 402 whether the<br>
suitability information sent out matches a set of<br>
suitability information 401. If this is the case, the<br>
mobile radio user device does not need to read in the<br>
suitability information but can use the stored set of<br>
suitability information. Otherwise, the mobile radio<br>
user device reads in the suitability information sent<br>
out and stores it in the data structure together with<br>
the suitability information configuration sent out.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, default<br>
values are stored for each system information block.<br>
That is to say that, analogously to figure 4, an<br>
analogous data structure 4 00, in which sets of system<br>
information which are sent out in this system<br>
information block are stored, is provided in the mobile<br>
radio user device for each system information block.<br>
For example, a base station sends out in the master<br>
information block, for each system information block,<br>
the system information configuration (analogously to<br>
the suitability information configuration 402) which<br>
specifies which set of system information is valid for<br>
this system information block,1 in other words which<br>
version of the system information block is currently<br>
valid. Such a master configuration block is shown in<br>
Table 2.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
In this example, the master configuration block,<br>
similar to the master configuration block which is<br>
arranged according to Table 1, contains the suitability<br>
information in accordance with lines 5 to 14 in<br>
Table 2. Corresponding to lines 2 to 4, the master<br>
configuration block contains for each system<br>
information block the system information block<br>
configuration which specifies which set of system<br>
information is currently valid for this system<br>
information block. In this example, the system<br>
information block configurations have the values 0 to<br>
64 (compare line 4, column 4 of Table 2) and the system<br>
information blocks are numbered through from 0 to 18<br>
(compare line 3, column 4 of Table 2) . The "&gt;" symbols<br>
indicate that the information, according to line 3 and<br>
line 4 of Table 4, that is to say the information of a<br>
system information block (SIB number) is stored<br>
together with the system block configuration for each<br>
system block in the form of the list of stored<br>
information (compare line 2 of Table 2).<br>
It can be provided that for each set of system<br>
information (for example set of suitability information<br>
401) , a validity period is defined which specifies a<br>
time interval after which the set of system information<br>
from the mobile radio user device on which it is stored<br>
is considered as no longer valid. This makes it<br>
possible to avoid that, after a certain operating time<br>
of the mobile radio network, all system information<br>
configurations are issued and no more new system<br><br>
information sets can be stored in the mobile radio user<br>
devices or can no longer be addressed by means of a<br>
system information configuration.<br>
If, for example, the range of values of the system<br>
information configuration is 0 to 64 as in the above<br>
example, no new system information sets could be<br>
addressed unambiguously by a base station by means of a<br>
system information configuration as soon as 65 system<br>
information sets have been stored and addressed by<br>
means of the system information configuration, that is<br>
to say a set of system information which corresponds to<br>
none of the sets of system information previously<br>
addressed by means of the system information<br>
configuration could no longer be identified or<br>
addressed.<br>
By using a validity period after which the sets of<br>
system information are no longer valid, system<br>
information configurations are demonstratively<br>
released and are available for addressing new sets of<br>
system information and can be reoccupied<br>
correspondingly.<br>
The ISO (International Organization for<br>
Standardization) has defined a reference model<br>
consisting of seven layers for describing manufacturer-<br>
independent communication systems which is called<br>
ISO/OSI model. The ISO/OSI model is used for describing<br>
a communication between various network devices of<br>
different manufacturers. OSI stands for Open System<br>
Interconnection. Most of the freely usable network<br>
protocols are based on this reference model, for<br>
example TCP/IP (Transport Control Protocol/Internet<br>
Protocol). The seven levels of the ISO/OSI model are<br>
defined in such a way that they build upon one another<br>
and that units of one level can be used independently<br>
of the units of other levels. The units of levels 1 to<br>
4 form the transport system, that is to say in levels 1<br><br>
to 4 the communication channels are defined physically<br>
and logically, and the units of levels 5 to 7 form the<br>
application system and are predominantly used for<br>
representing information. The seven levels of the<br>
ISO/OSI model are designated in their order from 1 to 7<br>
as physical layer, data link layer, network layer,<br>
transport layer, session layer, presentation layer and<br>
application layer.<br>
In Table 3, the designation and examples of protocols<br>
which are used as part of the respective layer are<br>
specified for each layer.<br><br>
The units of the application layer provide the<br>
interface between the respective user and application<br>
programs, for example for users of email programs or<br>
data transmission services.<br>
The units of the presentation layer prepare data for<br>
use by the units of the application layer. In this<br>
context, data are decoded, for example, converted<br>
between different formats, encrypted or checked.<br>
The units of the session layer provide services which<br>
are used for organizing the data transmission. For<br>
example, it is guaranteed that communication<br>
connections can be resumed again in spite of temporary<br>
interruptions. For this purpose, tokens in data packets<br>
are used, for example.<br><br>
The units of the transport layer provide the<br>
possibility of setting up and clearing down<br>
communication connections in a proper manner,<br>
synchronizing communication connections and<br>
distributing to the communication connections data<br>
packets for transmission by means of several<br>
communication connections (multiplexing). The transport<br>
layer forms the interface between the transport system<br>
and the application system according to the ISO/OSI<br>
model. In addition, data packets are segmented by units<br>
of the transport layer and the congestion of data<br>
packets can be prevented.<br>
The units of the network layer handle the switching and<br>
delivery of data packets. For example, they carry out<br>
the assembly of routing tables and the routing. If data<br>
packets are only to be forwarded, they are provided<br>
with a new intermediate destination address by units of<br>
the network layer and are not forwarded to units of<br>
higher layers. The coupling of different network<br>
topologies is also carried out in the network layer.<br>
The units of the data link layer organize and monitor<br>
the access to the data transmission medium. Bit streams<br>
to be transmitted are segmented in the data link layer<br>
and combined to form packets. Furthermore, data can be<br>
subjected to an error check, for example a checksum can<br>
be appended to a data packet. A compression of data can<br>
also be carried out. Further tasks of the units of the<br>
data link layer are the sequence monitoring, the time<br>
monitoring and the flow control.<br>
The data link layer can be subdivided into two<br>
sublayers. The upper sublayer, that is to say the<br>
sublayer in the direction of the network layer, is<br>
called the logical link control (LLC) layer and the<br>
lower sublayer, that is to say the sublayer in the<br>
direction of the physical layer, is called the medium<br><br>
access control (MAC) layer. The functionality of the<br>
units of the MAC layer can be developed differently<br>
depending on the transmission medium used (that is to<br>
say depending on the arrangement of the physical<br>
layer). The main tasks of the MAC layer usually<br>
include:<br>
Detecting where frames in the bit stream received<br>
by the units of the physical layer start and stop (when<br>
receiving data).<br>
Dividing the data stream into frames and possibly<br>
inserting additional bits into the frame structure so<br>
that the start and the end of a frame can be detected<br>
at a receiver (when transmitting data).<br>
Finding transmission errors, for example by<br>
inserting a checksum during transmission or by<br>
corresponding control calculations during reception,<br>
respectively.<br>
Inserting and evaluating MAC addresses during<br>
transmission and during reception, respectively.<br>
Access control, that is to say when several units<br>
wish to access the physical transmission medium,<br>
deciding which of the units is granted the right of<br>
access.<br>
The physical layer relates to characteristics of the<br>
transmission medium. For example, wavelengths and<br>
signal levels to be used are defined. The units of the<br>
physical layer convert the bit sequences to be<br>
transmitted into transmittable formats.<br>
According to one exemplary embodiment of the invention,<br>
a method is provided as is shown in figure 5.<br>
Figure 5 shows a sequence diagram 50 0 according to one<br>
exemplary embodiment of the invention.<br>
The sequence diagram 500 illustrates a method for<br>
generating and transmitting system information to a<br>
mobile radio user device in a mobile radio cell.<br><br>
In step 501, system information is grouped to form<br>
several system information blocks, the information<br>
required for a mobile radio user device in order to<br>
verify if it is provided with access to the mobile<br>
radio cell, are grouped in a single one of the system<br>
information blocks.<br>
In step 502, at least one information message is formed<br>
from the information blocks.<br>
In step 503, the information message is supplied to a<br>
unit of the data link layer by a unit of the network<br>
layer.<br>
In step 504, the information message is sent out by the<br>
unit of the data link layer by means of at least one<br>
unit of the physical layer.<br>
In figure 6, it is illustrated which tasks are carried<br>
out in which layers according to an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>
Figure 6 shows a data flowchart 600 according to one<br>
exemplary embodiment of the invention.<br>
The data flow shown takes place between units of the<br>
network layer 601, of the data link layer 602 and the<br>
physical layer 603.<br>
A unit of the network layer 606, in the present<br>
exemplary embodiment a unit of the RRC (radio resource<br>
control) layer, that is to say a unit which performs<br>
tasks in the framework of the RRC protocol, groups<br>
system information 604 to form several information<br>
blocks 605.<br>
The system information 604 is generated at least<br>
partially by a unit of the RRC layer.<br><br>
One of the information blocks 605 contains all the<br>
information required for a mobile radio user device in<br>
order to verify if it is provided with access in the<br>
mobile radio cell in which the system information 604<br>
is sent out, that is to say all suitability<br>
information.<br>
From the information blocks, information messages 609<br>
are formed in the RRC layer 601, which messages are<br>
supplied to a unit of the data link layer 607, in the<br>
present example a unit of the RLC (radio link control)<br>
layer, that is to say a unit which performs tasks<br>
within the framework of the RLC protocol.<br>
The unit of the data link layer 607 supplies the<br>
information messages 609, which were supplemented with<br>
error correction bits for a possible error correction,<br>
or segmented for sending out, for example, by the unit<br>
of the data link layer 607, to a unit of the physical<br>
layer 608. The unit of the physical layer 608 sends out<br>
the information messages 609. For example, the<br>
information messages 609 are broadcast in the mobile<br>
radio cell.<br>
The information blocks 605 can be both system<br>
information blocks (SIBs) and a master information<br>
block (MIB) .<br>
The sending out of the information messages 609 by<br>
means of the unit of the physical layer 60 8, for<br>
example a physical channel, for example a broadcast<br>
channel, can also involve a unit of the MAC layer (not<br>
shown) which, for example, regulates the access to the<br>
physical channel.<br><br>
