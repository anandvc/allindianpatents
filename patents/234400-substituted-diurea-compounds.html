Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to diurea derivatives that block intracellular signal transduction and inhibit interleukin-2 (IL-2) production, to methods for their preparation, to compositions containing them and to me¬thods and use for clinical treatment of autoimmune disea¬ses, inflammatory diseases, organ transplant rejection and other disorders associated with IL-2 mediated immune response as well as  conditions of malignant neoplasia. Because of their selective immunomodulating properties, these compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of this invention are particularly useful for preventing and treating acute or chronic inflammation, autoimmune di¬sease (rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, type-1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis), graft versus host disease (and other forms of organ or bone marrow transplant rejection) and malignant neoplastic disease. More particularly, the present invention relates to novel diurea derivatives suitable for the treatment of, for example, rheumatoid arthritis and graft versus host disease. Background of the invention<br>
T lymphocytes play a central role in the immune res¬ponse, both as direct effector cells and as regulatory cells that modulate the functions of numerous other cell types, primarily those that participate in the body's defence mechanisms. This regulatory function is provided either through direct cell-cell contact or via the secre¬tion of various cytokines. Thus the proper function of T-cells is essential for the maintenance of normal homeo¬stasis within and outside the immune system. Conversely, abnormalities in their function can lead to immunological diseases, e.g. autoimmunity, allergies and immunodefi-<br>
&gt;■■<br><br>
ciences. Indeed, activation of T-cells is often the ini¬tiating event in many inflammatory and autoimmune disea¬ses.<br>
CD^"" T cells of the T helper 1 (Thl) type play a pi¬votal role in orchestrating inflammatory immune respon¬ses. Thl cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are commonly associated with cell-mediated immunity and induction of organ-specific autoimmune diseases (Abbas et al. 1996) . The cytokine IL-2 is a principal regulator of Thl activity (Waldmann et al. 2001). IL-2 is an autocrine growth factor that plays an essential role in the regula¬tion of T-cell activation and proliferation. When the bo¬dy launches a Thl response against its own cells, autoim¬mune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, type-1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis occur. Similarly, cell-mediated immunity causes rejection of transplanted organs (allograft rejec¬tion) and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a serious complication that can occur after bone-marrow transplan¬tation. In addition to IL-2, dysregulation of other pro¬inflammatory Thl cytokines (including TNF-a and IFN-y) has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflam¬matory and autoimmune diseases (Sacca et al. 1997). Cli¬nical studies have shown that interference with IL-2 activity effectively suppresses immune response in vivo (Waldmann et al. 1993). Accordingly, agents that inhibit IL-2 production are therapeutically useful for selecti¬vely suppressing immune response in a patient in need of such immunosuppression.<br>
A common immunopathological hallmark of many auto¬immune inflammatory diseases is a T-cell invasion and accumulation at the inflamed tissue. One mechanism impli¬cated in this process is the failure to remove autoreac¬tive T-cells due to defects in activation-induced cell death (Eguchi et al. 2001), suggesting that lack of apop-tosis is involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity. Thus, approaches that attempt to correct underlying im-<br><br>
munoregulatory defects in autoimmune disease could in¬clude inventions aimed at inhibiting cytokines (such as IL-2) and/or deleting autoreactive Thl cells. Inappro¬priate survival of lymphocytes is also associated with an increased occurrence of lymphoma (Bleesing et al. 2003). Moreover, an important aspect of tumour development in general is the suppression of apoptosis, and human tu¬mours ^seem to utilise several different mechanisms to evade cell suicide (White et al. 2001). Therefore, stra¬tegies to circumvent anti-apoptotic mechanisms and to ac¬tivate apoptosis in tumour cells would suppress tumour formation.<br>
In document WO030517 97, small molecule inhibitors of IL-2/IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) binding are described. This approach would block the proliferative activity of IL-2/IL-2R binding but fails to inhibit other pro-inflam¬matory cytokines. In addition, the use of antibodies di¬rected against IL-2Ra has been described. However, these antibodies are not orally bioavailable. Inhibition of IL-2 action can also be achieved by the use of more general immunosuppressive drugs, such as glucocorticoids, cyclo-sporine, azathioprione, or mycophenolate mofetil. These compounds are relatively non-selective and suffer from dose-limiting side effects. Accordingly, a need exists for compounds that effectively inhibit IL-2 production for preventing and treating immune disorders.<br>
The prior art of IL-2 inhibition with small mole¬cules describes no compounds structurally related to the diurea compounds of the present invention. However, other applications of related diurea derivatives have been described in the literature.<br>
In U.S. Pat. No. 5,358,946 some urea derivatives as inhibitors of acyl-coenzyme A cholesterol acyl-transfe-rase (ACAT) and their use for the treatment of athero¬sclerosis are described.<br>
In U.S. Pat. No. 6,316,623 libraries of ethylenedi-amine compounds useful for screening in biological assays<br><br>
in order to identify pharmaceutically useful compounds are described.<br>
In EP 0 325 397 diurea derivatives useful for the preparation of a medicament for inhibiting the acyl-coenzyme A cholesterol acyl-transferase (ACAT) enzyme in a subject are described.<br>
In J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 89-99 the synthesis and conformation of 1,2-di'aminoethane and 1,3-diaminopro-pane diureas are described.<br>
Diurea derivatives can also be found in the CA Chem-cat database. No pharmacological activities have been ascribed to these compounds.<br>
The substitution pattern and use of the above, spe¬cifically mentioned,. diureas places them outside the scope of the present invention. Summary of the invention<br>
The compounds of this invention inhibit production of IL-2 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines by T-cells by inhibiting intracellular signalling. This inhibition of IL-2 is therapeutically useful for selectively supp¬ressing immune function. Compounds also promote the in¬duction of apoptosis in activated T-cells. The result of such selectively suppressed immunity includes reduced cell proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes and cellular immune response without serious toxicity or undesired side effects. Thus, the inhibition of IL-2 production and/or induction of apoptosis in activated T-cells are attractive means for preventing and treating a variety of immune disorders, including inflammatory di¬seases, autoimmune diseases, organ and bone marrow trans¬plant rejection and other disorders associated with IL-2 mediated immune response and defective cell regulation. In particular, the compounds may be used to prevent or treat acute or chronic inflammation, rheumatoid arth¬ritis, multiple sclerosis, type-1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, graft versus host disease (and<br><br>
other forms of organ or bone marrow transplant rejection) and malignant neoplastic disease. Description of the drawing<br>

The objective problem of the present invention is to provide compounds which by virtue of their pharmacologi¬cal profile, with high potency in experimental models and low level of side-effects, are considered to be of value in the treatment of disease associated with pathologic inflammation, autoimmunity or other pathologic cell regu¬lation. Included in the invention is also the use of the compounds for the preparation of a medicament for the inhibition of IL-2 production. These compounds also in¬hibit the production of other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interferon-y (IFN-y) and promote apoptosis (ac¬tivation-induced cell death). In a particular aspect, this invention provides preparation of a medicament for the inhibition of IL-2 production, a method of treating diseases in which the disease pathology may be therapeu¬tically modified by inhibiting IL-2 production and T-cell activation. Examples of such diseases are inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, organ transplant rejection, as well as malignant neoplastic diseases. In particular, the compounds may be used to prevent or treat acute or chro¬nic inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclero¬sis, type-1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, psoria¬sis, graft versus host disease (and other forms of organ or bone marrow transplant rejection) and malignant neo¬plastic disease. More particularly, the present invention relates to novel diurea derivatives suitable for the treatment of, for example, rheumatoid arthritis and graft versus host disease.<br><br>

4-Methyl-morpholine (584 mg, 5.8 mmol) was added to a solution of 2,4,6-trichloro-[1,3,5] triazine (355 mg, 1.92 mmol) in CH2CI2 (20 mL) at 0°C. A slurry of quino-line-6-carboxylic acid (1.00 g, 5.8 mmol) in CH2CI2 was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0°C for 4.5 hours. The solution was filtered trough celite and NaNa (375 mg, 5.8 mmol) was added to the filtrate. The reac¬tion mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature over night stirring all the time. The solution was ex¬tracted first with Na2C03 and then with water. The organic layer was dried over sodium sulphate and evaporated. The crude product was purified by flash silica gel chromato¬graphy using, EtOAc:Heptane 1:1 as the eluent. Concentra¬tion in vacuum of the product-rich fractions provided quinoline-6-carbonyl azide (310 mg, 28%). ^H NMR (CDCI3) : 5 7.49 (IH, q) , 8.15 (IH, d) , 8.26 (2H, d) , 8.57 (IH, s), 9.02 (IH, d) .<br>

The compounds of formula (I) were assayed for inhi¬bition of IL-2 production. Inhibition of IL-2 production<br>
The compounds to be evaluated were dissolved in DMSO and the dilution series of the compounds were prepared in DMSO. The series were further diluted in cell culture me¬dium (RPMI 1640 with ultraglutamine, 10% foetal calf se¬rum (FCS)) to obtain a final assay concentration of DMSO of 0.1% in 200 pi total volume. The compounds were plated (2 pl/well) on opaque white assay plates together with controls.<br>
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were iso¬lated from human blood drawn from healthy volunteers, by density gradient separation over Ficoll-Paque. T-cells (CD4+) were obtained with positive selection using mag¬netic cell sorting (MACS). The cells were resuspended at 1 X 10^ cells/ml in cell culture medium (RPMI 1640 with ultraglutamine, 10% FCS, 10 mM hepes, ImM sodium pyruvate and 0.1 mg/ml gentamicin).<br>
The cells (1 x 10^/well) were added to the assay plates containing the diluted compounds and pre-incubated for 30 min at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% car¬bon dioxide. The cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and 250 ng/ml ionomycin and the plates were incubated for 4 hours at 37'"C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide. Approximately 100 pi of the supernatants were removed and transferred to a separate microtiter plate and the remaining cells<br>
^7<br><br>
were lysed (Nucleotide Releasing Reagent, ViaLight'*', Cambrex). All the plates were kept at -20°C pending ana¬lysis. Human interleukin-2 (IL-2) was analysed with a standard ELISA kit (OptEIA'^, Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Viability was assessed by measuring adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content by adding luciferase (ATP monitoring reagent, ViaLight™, Cambrex) to the lysed cells and measuring luminescence, 'all accor¬ding to the manufacturer's specifications.<br>
The % effect of each concentration of compound was calculated compared to non-treated stimulated cells. Non¬linear regression, a modified Hill-plot (y = (a - d) / (1 + (x/c) 'b) + d) was used to calculate the concentration for y = 50% (IC50) • Inhibition of other cytokines<br>
By similar methods using peripheral blood mono¬nuclear cells, appropriate stimuli, and commercially available ELISA kits, for a particular cytokine, inhi¬bition of IL-6, TNF-a and IFN-y were demonstrated. Induction of apoptosis<br>
The induction of apoptosis can be observed by mea¬suring Annexin V-binding to cells (Van Engeland et al. 1998). Primary human 004"^ T cells were isolated from peripheral blood from healthy volunteers as described<br>
I  above. Cells were cultured immediately after purification at a density of 2 x 10^ cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, Gentamycin (100 \iq/ml) ,   Hepes (10 mM) and Sodium Pyruvate (1 mM). Cells were stained with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide by using the<br>
')     ApoAlert Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Kit (Clontech) accor¬ding to manufacturer's instructions. Flow cytometry ana¬lysis was performed using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Alternatively, induction of apoptosis can be demon-<br>
/  strated measuring cleavage of the caspase-substrate PARP<br>
3  (poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase) (Tang et al. 1996). Cell lysates were prepared by lysing 2 x 10^ PBS-washed cells in 50 ^.1 buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 250 mM<br>
3«<br><br>
/<br><br>
NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 3 mM EGTA 0.5% NP-4 0 supplemented with 1 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPP), 10 mM p-glycerophos-phate, 100 nM Na-vanadate and 1 mM phenylmethansulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The protein concentrations were deter¬mined by using Bio-Rads protein assay and thereafter e-qual amounts of protein was loaded onto precasted NuPAGE™ Tris-Bis gels (Novex). After electrophoresis, the pro¬teins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and probed with a polyclonal rabbit antibody directed against PARP (Roche). Proteins were visualised after incubations with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti¬body and ECL reagents (Amersham Bioscience).<br>
Another method for measuring apoptosis involves vi¬sualising specific DNA fragmentation (Willingham et al. 1999). DNA was extracted using Suicide-Track DNA Ladder Isolation Kit (Oncogene Research Products) according to manufacturer's instructions. DNA fragmentation was visua¬lised on 1.5% agarose gels in the presence of ethidium bromide. Summary of Test Results<br>
Among preferred compounds is 1-(2-diethylamino-ethyl)-3-(3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-l-{2-[3-(3-trifluoro-methyl-phenyl)-ureido]-ethyl}-urea, hydrochloride herein¬after called Compound A.<br>
The effect of Compound A on PMA/Ionomycin stimulated IL-2 production in human T-cells was determined (figure 1). The IC50 of Compound A was 2  ±  1 pM   (mean ± S.D., n=30) .<br>
Examples of other compounds showing similar effects on IL-2 production are shown below in table 1 (including the result for Compound A).<br>

The effect of Compound A on PMA/Ionomycin stimulated IL-6, TNF-a and IFN-y production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells was determined. The IC50 values of Compound A were 3 ± 1 |iM (mean ± S.D., n=3) for IL-6, 3 ± 1 jiM (mean ± S.D., n=3) for TNF-a and 4 ± 1 JAM (mean ± S.D., n=3) for IFN-y.<br>
The effect of Compound A on apoptosis induction in human T-cells was determined by methods mentioned above. Significant apoptosis induction was observed at &gt; 4 jiM of Compound A.<br>
Effective quantities of the compounds of formula (I) are preferably administered to a patient in need of such treatment according to usual routes of administration and formulated in usual pharmaceutical compositions compri¬sing an effective amount of the active ingredient and one or more suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or carriers. Such compositions may take a variety of forms, e.g. solutions, suspensions, emulsions, tablets.<br>
40<br><br>
capsules, and powders prepared for oral administration, aerosols for inhalation, sterile solutions for parental administration, suppositories for rectal administration or suitable topical formulations. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable pharmaceu¬tical formulations are described, for example, in ^'Phar¬maceuticals - The Science of Dosage Form Design^', M.B. Aulton, Churchill Livingstone, (1988).<br>
A suitable daily dose for use in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is contemplated to vary between 0.0005 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg body weight, in particular between 0.005 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg body weight, depending upon the specific condition to be treated, the age and weight of the specific patient, and the specific pa¬tient's response to the medication. The exact individual dosage, as well as the daily dosage, will be determined according to standard medical principles under the direc¬tion of a physician.<br>
Various additives to enhance the stability or ease of administration of the drug are contemplated. The phar¬maceutical composition may also contain additional thera¬peutically useful substances other than a compound of formula (I). References<br>
