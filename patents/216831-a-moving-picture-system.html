				<td>A MOVING PICTURE SYSTEM<br>
LD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a moving picture system for displaying a collection of<br>
:ionary images as a motion picture to passengers in a vehicle, for example a train,<br>
elling along a pathway in the vicinity of the images.<br>
SCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
It is known to provide a motion picture system for viewing from a vehicle travelling<br>
ng a fixed path. A known form of such a system comprises a plurality of static images,<br>
ge mounts mounting the images along one side of the fixed path and an illumination<br>
tern for illuminating each of the images intermittently. The proposed uses of these<br>
terns include commercial advertising, entertainment, and information provision. A variety<br>
llumination methodologies, triggering mechanisms, and display mountings have been<br>
posed.<br>
The systems disclosed in US patents 4,383,742 and 4,179,198 use electromagnetic<br>
gers to sense the velocity of the moving vehicle and to synchronize the intermittent<br>
nination of the images according to the vehicle speed and the image dimensions. Thus<br>
speed of the motion picture varies with the speed of the train. Furthermore, the<br>
essary synchronizing mechanism is quite complicated and therefore expensive. In the<br>
ond patent, light flash emitting devices are installed on the vehicle at regular intervals.<br>
US patent 5,108,171, discloses, in one embodiment, a trigger mechanism<br>
ponsive to a light signal from each window of the vehicle. In another embodiment, a<br>
ector is associated with each window to reflect light from stationary light sources. This<br>
tern requires modifications to and regular maintenance of the vehicle, which is<br>
ensive and undesirable.<br>
US patent 6,016,183 discloses the use of individual sets of screens and<br>
oboscopic liquid crystal projectors for the display of images. Image signals are sent<br>
 the liquid crystal projectors from an image source such a digital video player. This<br>
ombination is expensive.<br>
US patent 3,951,529 uses rear stroboscopic backlight for each image to illuminate<br>
ie images but provides scant guidance on the size and placement of the images. Thus to<br>
 observer in the vehicle there is the undesirable possibility that only a partial view of an<br>
nage is perceived through the closest vehicular window.<br>
All of the patents referred to above are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
One common problem with all of these patented inventions is the possibility of loss<br>
synchronicity in illumination. In this case, the observer sees flashing black images,<br>
nich detracts from the aesthetic appeal of the motion picture. Another problem is the<br>
ilure to account for change in the perceived size of the image if the distance between<br>
 vehicle and the wall changes. Therefore, for a passenger travelling through different<br>
eas where such a system is installed, there may be a great variation in perceived image<br>
 corresponding to differing cross sectional width of the relevant pathways.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides for a moving picture system<br>
viewing from a vehicle travelling along a fixed path at a substantially<br>
nstant speed V. the system comprisinq : a plurality of static images; image<br>
page having a width Wp and being spaced from the adjacent images by a spacing Wi,<br>
and the dimensions Wp and Wi being related to the vehicle speed by (Wp + Wi) ³ V/R;<br>
here R is the viewing rate of the images and is greater than or equal to 24 images per<br>
second; and a static illumination for illuminating each of the images intermittently and<br>
aving a single trigger responsive to the approach of the vehicle to cause all of the images<br>
to be illuminated simultaneously at a fixed frequency greater than 24 Hz, wherein each<br>
page is spaced from the vehicle by a distance D and wherein the ratio Wp : D is<br>
bstantially constant from image to image.<br>
The invention further provides a moving picture system for viewing from a vehicle<br>
avelling along a fixed path at a substantially constant speed V, the system comprising : a<br>
urality of static images; image mounts mounting the images along one side of the fixed<br>
th, each image having a width Wp and being spaced from the adjacent images by a<br>
acing Withe dimensions Wpand Wi being related to the vehicle speed by (Wp + Wi) &gt;<br>
R<br>
where R is the viewing rate of the images and is greater than or equal to 24 images<br>
or second; and a static illumination system for illuminating each of the images<br>
termittently, the illumination system having a single trigger responsive to the approach of<br>
the vehicle to cause all of the images to be illuminated simultaneously at a fixed frequency<br>
eater than 24 Hz, wherein each image has an image height Hp and wherein the image is<br>
aced from the vehicle by a distance D and wherein the ratio Hp : D is substantially<br>
nstant from image to image.<br>
The images, of minor variation in successive content, give to an observer the<br>
simple construction, installation, and maintenance of the constituent elements, and the<br>
improved view offered to passengers in the vehicle.<br>
With this system at least twenty four images per second pass a stationary<br>
passenger in the moving vehicle regardless of the speed of the vehicle. The frequency<br>
of illumination is not synchronized with the vehicle speed or window positioning. The<br>
frequency is conveniently that of local mains current, usually 50 or 60 Hz.<br>
In embodiments where the distance from the vehicle to an adjacent wall<br>
carrying the images varies along the path, the ratios of the image width and height to<br>
the vehicle to image spacing are maintained constant, either by varying the positioning<br>
of the images relative to the wall or varying the image size. This maintains the.<br>
perceived size of the images fairly constant.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring to the accompanying drawings, one embodiment of the invention<br>
is illustrated in Fig. 1. A subway train 10 travels along a pathway defined by track 12.<br>
Along one sides of the vehicle"s pathway are placed image panels 14, each of which<br>
displays one image. In this preferred embodiment, the image covers the whole of the<br>
image panel. Typically, solid walls 16 line the sides of the pathway, but this is not<br>
required for proper functioning of the invention. Each image panel 14 is mounted on the<br>
wall 16 bv a panel mount 18. Each image Danel 14 is Illuminated bv a strobe Iight 20<br>
directed towards the image on the front face of the panel. All of the strobe lights are<br>
operated by a common controller 22.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 5, the controller 22 includes an infrared (IR) motion<br>
detector 24 positioned to detect the approach of the train 10: On detection of the train,<br>
the IR detector starts a timer 26, which in turn actuates a strobe power supply 28. The<br>
power supply is connected to an AC mains power supply 30 and produces an output<br>
wave at mains frequency, either 50 or 60 Hz depending on location. This minimizes the<br>
complexity of the controller and eliminates any synchronization of the image illumination<br>
with either train speed or window position. After a preset time, the timer 26 counts out<br>
and the power supply is turned off. The time of operation is selected to be sufficient to<br>
allow passage of the subway train.<br>
It is known that where the frequency at which images of minor variation<br>
are flashed to an observer at or in excess of about 24 cycles per second, the perception<br>
is that of smooth motion. The human mind fills in the intervening blank spaces to create<br>
an illusion of continuous motion. Furthermore, a separation of the still images is<br>
necessary. For example, on television, diagonal black bars are scanned at a rate of<br>
one-eighth to one-thirtieth per second; and cinematic films frames are separated by a<br>
fine black border.<br>
If the frequency falls below this threshold of about 24 cycles per second,<br>
the psychological perception of continuous motion is not achieved; instead, any<br>
movements are seen as "jerky" and the images flash.<br>
Referring to Figures 3 and 4 of the drawings, each panel has a panel width<br>
Wp and a heiaht Hn. It is SDaced from each adiacent oanel bv a spacina W. The image<br>
is spaced from the side of the train by a distance D. The speed at which a subway<br>
vehicle (or any conventional means of mass vehicular transport) travels during cruising<br>
speed is generally consistent from day to day. This is to permit detailed scheduling as<br>
well as for safety reasons. It is therefore an acceptable assumption that the speed of a<br>
bond, this imposes an upper limit on the width Wp of each image panel plus the spacing<br>
associated with the separation between images. The relationship is such that the<br>
miniimum speed of the vehicle V is the multiplicative product of the panel width plus<br>
arating distance, and the continuous motion threshold (about 24):<br>
V£( Wp+Wi)R,<br>
where R is the viewing rate of the images and is ³ 24.<br>
To maintain the largest possible image size, the viewing rate should be kept as close<br>
:4 as possible.<br>
If the speed of the vehicle increases, then the panel size separating distance must<br>
portionately increase if the viewing rate by the observer in the vehicle is to remain at<br>
put 24 cycles per second. Considerations of aesthetic appeal mandate an increase of<br>
size of each image panel with a concomitant decrease in the separating distance<br>
ween the image panels. On the other hand, a decrease in the speed of the vehicle<br>
uires that the image panel size plus separating distance decrease. In fact, the image<br>
el size actually decreases whereas the separating distance increases, again, for<br>
thetic reasons. Studies show that a maximum of five centimeters (two inches) is<br>
osed on the separating distance between image panels. This upper limit works also to<br>
linate the possibility of loss of synchronicity so prevalent in other attempts at creating<br>
same effect. In general, the cruising speed of a vehicle is unlikely to vary by a<br>
A desirable characteristic of a motion picture apparatus is to keep constant<br>
dimensions of the image as perceived by the observers. As illustrated in Figure 4,<br>
size of an image as seen by an observer inside the vehicle is inversely proportional<br>
the perpendicular distance from the observer (in practice the window of a vehicle) to<br>
image panels. If this distance increases, in order to keep the perceived size<br>
stant, the absolute size of an image as carried by an image panel must increase<br>
portionally. The ratios of image width Wp and height Hp to the distance from the train<br>
the wall remain constant. The consequent expansion or contraction in image panel<br>
size is compensated by a decrease or increase in the separating distance so as to leave<br>
unperturbed the viewing rate.<br>
Therefore, the dimension and placement of the image panels are specified<br>
as a function of the speed of the travelling vehicle and the distance from the image<br>
panels to the train. For example, if the vehicle travels at about 80 kilometers per hour<br>
(50 miles per hour), which is equivalent to about 22.22 meters per second (73.35 feet<br>
per second), in order to afford a viewing rate of about 24 images per second, the width<br>
of each image panel plus the interval spacing is approximately one meter (three feet).<br>
Typically, the interval spacing on each size of an image is chosen as one-twelfth the<br>
size of the panel plus interval spacing, 8.3 centimeters (3 inches). If the distance to the<br>
wall increases by five percent, then the image panel size increases proportionately to<br>
96.2 centimeters meters (2 feet 10.7 inches), and the interval spacing should be set at<br>
about 3.8 centimeters (1.3 inches).<br>
As illustrated most particularly in Figure 2, the image panels 14 are<br>
constructed of rigid materials so as to avoid movement on the passage of a vehicle due<br>
to the displacement of air. Image mounts 18 affix the image panels 14 to the wall 16 of<br>
the vehicle"s pathway. The panel holder 34 includes a U-shaped frame 36 with upright<br>
arms 38 and a base 40 configured as channels to receive the side and bottom edges of<br>
an image panel. Each of the arms 38 is connected to two angle brackets 42 by<br>
fasteners 44 fixed to the arms and slots 46 in the brackets. Tightening the fasteners<br>
fixes the position of the arms along the slots. The angle brackets have base flanges 48<br>
mounted on the wait, so that the flanges 50 in which the slots are formed project<br>
forwardly from the wall. Thus, the image panels may be each positioned vertically at a<br>
generally uniform distance from the train, regardless of the contour of the supporting<br>
wall. Of course minor variations may exist due to serious defects in the wall or general<br>
conditions.<br>
Illumination of each image panel is provided through the strobe lights 20<br>
which are attached to the wall and located immediately above the image mounts 32.<br>
The orientation of with each light is preferably adjustable, using a rotating light head and<br>
"barn door" flaps. In order to reduce or practically eliminate the effect of glare from<br>
other light sources on the inside windows of a vehicle, the intensity of strobe illumination<br>
should be such that 75 per cent of illumination perceived by an observer on passing<br>
through the region of the image panels derives from the external strobe lighting and the<br>
balance from spurces within the vehicle. A further option is to reduce the internal<br>
lighting of the vehicle on entering into a vicinity of the image panels.<br>
Each set of lights is preferably connected to the next set by interlocking<br>
receptacles. This produces modularity, resulting in ease of extension and maintenance.<br>
It will be appreciated that the description above relates to the preferred<br>
embodiments by way of example only. Many possible variations on the apparatus will<br>
be evident to those knowledgeable in the field, and such variations are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention as described and claimed, whether or not expressly<br>
described.<br>
As one example, the vehicle used in the foregoing description is a subway<br>
train travelling in an underground subway tunnel. However, this invention is adaptable<br>
to be used for outdoor rail systems, monorails, elevators, or any form of transportation<br>
where images may be viewed from a moving position and the prevailing lighting<br>
conditions are appropriate or are appropriately adjustable.<br>
The preceding description has described the viewing of a motion picture<br>
through the windows on one side of a train. It is to be understood that images may be<br>
provided on both sides where appropriate conditions exist. Where used, the images on<br>
opposite sides need not be of the same motion picture.<br>
