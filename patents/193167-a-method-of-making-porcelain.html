This  invention relates to a method of making porcelain.<br>
Porcelain materials are typically made by shaping the precursor materials into a green body and firing the green body to convert it into a porcelain. The precursor materials may include alumina, clay, and a fluxing material such as feldspar or nepheline syenite. There has been much activiu' aimed at developing porcelain compositions which have higher strengths or are easier to prepare, for example by lowering the firing temperatures. Oda, US 4,717,695 (1988), discloses porcelains having unglazed bending strengths greater than 1400 kg/cm" prepared from corundum, bauxite, clay, feldspar, and optionally quartz. However, two high temperature steps, a calcining one at 900-1400 °C and a firing one at 1100-1400 °C, are needed.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
We have discovered Lhat by using a bismuth fluxing material, porcelains of higher strength unexpectedly can be obtained while at the same time permining a sirppler and'or lower temperature firing process. A porcelain of this invention comprises 9 to 55 % by weight of SiO2. 36 to 87 % by weight of Al.Oj, 0 to 2.0 % by weight of Fe203. 0 to 1.0 % by weight of TiO2. 0 to 0.5 % by weight of CaO, 0 to 0.5 % by weight of MgO, 1.0 to 4.0 % by weight of K2O and Na2O combined, and 0.25 to 25.0 % by weight of bismuth oxide, the percentages being based on the combined weights of SiO2, .A.l203, Fe203, TiO2. CaO, MgO, K2O. Na20, and bismuth oxide.<br>
.A.lso provided is a method of making a porcelain, comprising the steps of<br>
(a)	forming a mixture comprising (i) 5 to 80 % by weight of alumina, (ii) 10 to 80 % by weight of clay, (iii) 9 to 25 % by weight of fluxing material selected from the group consisting of bismuth-containing fluxing material, bismuth-free fluxing material and combinations thereof provided that the amount of bismuth-containing fluxing material is at least 0.2 % by weight; all the weight %"s being based on the combined weights of alumina, clay, and fluxing material;<br>
(b)	forming the mixture into a shaped article; and<br>
(c)	firing the shaped article to convert the mi.xture into porcelain.<br><br>
Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
This invention advantageously permits the fabrication of higher strength porcelains by processes which are more forgiving than prior art ones. The inclusion of a bismuth-containing fluxing material unexpectedly results in a porcelain having higher strengths than the corresponding materials made without the bismuth-containing fluxing material under the same conditions. The results are obtained over a wide range of alumina content and over a wide range of firing temperatures and regimens. The bismuth-containing fluxing material also enables in some instances the attainment of high strengths at lower firing temperatiires. In other instances, the high strengths are difficult or impossible to obtain in the corresponding bismuth-fi-ee formulations without resorting to tightly controlled firing conditions. In other instances, especially where the amount of alumina is high (greater than 55 % by weight), the high strengths are difficult to obtain regardless of the firing conditions unless a bismuth-containing fluxing material is used.<br>
As stated above, porcelains of this invention comprises 9 to 55 % by weight of SiOj, 36 to 87 % by weight of Al2O,, 0 to 2.0 % by weight of Fc2O3, 0 to 1.0 % by weight of TiOz, 0 to 0.5 % by weight of CaO, 0 to 0.5 % by weight of MgO, 1.0 to 4.0 % by weight of K2O and Na20 combined, and 0.25 to 25.0 % by weight of bismuth oxide. Preferably, the porcelain consists essentially of the foregoing component.s, that is, it is essentially free of other materials. The presence of Fe203, Ti02, CaO, and MgO is theoretically optional, but because normally they are present as unavoidable impurities in the precursor materials, they are usually present in the final porcelain. The K2O and Na20 come mainly fi"om the fluxing material, but a small amount also comes fi-om the clay and the alumina. Without being bound by such theory, it is believed that the porcelain has corundum and muUite crystalline phases in a glassy matrix.<br>
Unglazed bending strengths were measured using a standard three-point bending test. Porcelains of this invention preferably have unglazed bending strengths of at least 2000 kg/cm^, more preferably at least 2800 kg/cm^. Although our measurements were made with samples of various sizes, results were confirmed to be reliable and reproducible when selected samples were re-measured with 12 mm (0.5 inch) diameter extruded rods which are normally used for such measurements, using a test span of 100 mm.<br>
The term "porcelain," as used herein, is a ceramic which is prepared from clay (e.g., Al2Si205(0H)4), a fluxing material, and alumina.   The porcelains of this invention also<br><br>
include bismuth oxide derived from the fluxing material. The bismuth fluxing material, in addition to facilitating the firing process by lowering the requisite temperature, contributes to the attainment of high bending strengths.<br>
The bismuth-containing fluxing materied may be either bismuth oxide (typically 81203) or a compound pyrolyzable to bismuth oxide. Regarding the latter, any finely dispersed bismuth compound which is so pyrolyzable may be used. Exemplary ones include, without limitation, bismuth subcarbonate (Bi202(C03)), bismuth subnitrate (Bi202(N03)2), bismuth oxychloride, bismuth nitrate, bismuth chloride, bismuth sulfate, bismuth oxalate, bismuth hydroxide, and the like. Bismuth subcarbonate is especially preferred. It is believed that the bismuth subcarbonate can be more effectively dispersed, making it a better sintering aid. The amovmt of bismuth containing fluxing material to be used is at least 0.2 % by weight, up to maximimi of 25 % by weight (that is, all the fluxing material is bismuth-containing). A preferred range is between 0.5 and 15 % by weight. Combinations of the bismuth oxide and the pyrolyzable compound may be used.<br>
The bismuth-free fluxing material may be a feldspar, nepheline syenite, or other fluxing material conventionally used in the ceramic arts. Feldspars are anhydrous aluminosilicates containing K+ Na+ or Ca+2 ions which aid in the formation of a glass phase. The preferred feldspar is potash (K+) feldspar, or KAlSi308. (Herein, the identification of a feldspar as being of a given type (e.g., "potash feldspar") means that it has a predominance of the correspondingly specified ion (in this instance, K ). It does not mean that the other ions (Na , Ca  ) must be entirely or even substantially absent.)<br>
The alumina preferably is corundum (a-alumina). The alumina typically has a puri¬ty of about 99.8 %, the main impurity being Na20. Particle size is not especially critical. Typically, we have used alumina with an average particle size of between 2 and 10 |im, although alumina with larger or smaller average particle sizes may be used. During the fa¬brication process, the particle size may be ftirther reduced and agglomerates broken up. The amount of alumina is between 10 and 80, preferably 25 and 75, % by weight.<br>
Clays are hydrous alumino silicates which develop plasticity when mixed with water. They may additionally contain small amounts of impurities such as quartz, Fe203, Ti02, CaO, MgO, K2O, or Na20. The clay may be china clay, bentonite, ball clay, and the like, or a mixture thereof Ball clays have smaller particle sizes than china clays and therefore are more plastic.  However, they tend to have more impurity ions and organic<br><br>
matter. Because china clay is not as highly plastic, it can be mixed with ball clay to make it easier to mold. Generally, the selection of the type of clay (or clay mixtiire) is governed by processabilty considerations. We have found that the type of clay or clay mixture has little effect on the mechanical properties of the resultant porcelain. The clay is used in an amount of between 10 and 80, preferably 12.5 and 60, % by weight.<br>
The bismuth compound may be finely dispersed or coated over the other compo¬nents by wet milling. A ball mill may be used to produce an intimate mixture of the precur¬sor materials, which can then be dewatered by filter pressing. To illustrate, all the precursor materials except the clay may be milled imtil at least about 98 % of the particles are less than 10 nm in effective spherical diameter. The milling time varies depending on the den¬sity and amount of the milling media, the ratio of water to solids, the total loading of the mill, and the milling speed. The clay is then added and the mixture is subjected to further milling until the desired particle size distribution is reached. Dewatering may also be effected by other methods, such as rotary evaporation or spray drying. The precursor materials may be ground to create a homogeneous mixture of the components. Generally, smaller particle sizes are preferred, subject to the limitation that mixtures with extremely small particle sizes are difficult to extrude. Other comminution techniques may be used.<br>
Other mixing techniques may be used, for example by precipitation of the bismuth onto a suspension of the other components, as disclosed in Dupon et al., US 5,070,050 (1991), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The dewatered intimate mixture is then shaped, for example by extrusion, into a desired shaped article, or green body. The green body is then sintered (or fired) to convert the intimate mixture into porcelain material. While we do not wish to be bound by any theory, it is our belief that the bismuth compound, when heated, is converted to an oxide of bismuth which melts and acts as a liquid phase sintering aid which reacts with the clay and other fluxing material to promote densification and produce a dense porcelain. An advantage of our invention is that sintering or firing can be effected at a relatively low temperature. The temperature is preferably between HOC and 1300 °C, more preferably between 1150 and 1260 °C. Some experimentation with the minimum temperature required to attain the desired properties in the porcelain for a given formulation may be needed. The sintering time is not particularly critical, provided it is of sufficient duration. Once the ceiling temperature has been attained, the sample is held there for between about 0 and about 12 hr. Longer times may be used. Therelhay be some variation in the time required.<br><br>
depending on the sintering temperature, the particle size of the porcelain precursor material, the amount of bismuth compound present, etc., as may be readily empirically determined. As is well known in the art the sintering process may be according to a complex heating schedule, In such instances, a complex heating schedule, with the initial heating stages at a lower temperature, for example at 200 to 700°C for 1-20 hr, is recommended to ensure removal of volatiles (e.g., water from clay and carbon dioxide from bismuth subcarbonate).<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a method of making porcelain, comprising 9 to 55% by weight of SiO2, 36 to 87% by weight of AI2O3, 0 to 2.0% by weight of FejOa, 0 to 1.0% by weight of TiOj, 0 to 0.5% by weight of CaO, 0 to 0.5°'o by weight of MgO, 1.0 to 4.0% by weight of K2O and Na20 combined, and 0.25 to 25.0% by weight of bismuth oxide, the percentages being based on the combined weights of Si02, AI2O3, FejOa, Ti02, CaO, MgO, K2O, Na20, and bismuth oxide, the said method comprising the steps of: (a) forming a mixture comprising (i) 5 to 80% by weight of alumina, (ii) 10 to 80% by weight of clay, (iii) 9 to 25% by wei^t of fluxing material selected from the group consisting of bismuth-containing fluxing material, bismuth-free fluxing material and combinations thereof, provided that the amount of bismuth-containing fluxing material is at least 0.2% by wei^t; all the weight %'s being based on the combined weights of alumina, clay, and fluxing material; (b) forming the mixture into a shaped article; and (c) firing the shaped article to convert the mixture into porcelain.<br><br>
The process of this invention is advantageous in that only a single high temperature treatment is required. All the precursor materials may be milled in the same mill and discharged only once, instead of unloading the mill to calcine the materials and then reloading them to remill and mix with the clay. Porcelain made according to this invention can be used for all the applications for which porcelains are used, including insulators and structural ceramics. The practice of our invention may be further understood by reference to the following examples, which are provided by way of illustration and not of limitation.<br>
Example 1<br>
Corundum, potash feldspar, clay (a combination of china and ball clays), and bismuth subcarbonatc. in the amounts indicated in Table 1 below, were added to an 1.0 L mill jar with 1100 g Burundum cylindrical milling media. 200 g deionized water and about 4 g Darvan_ 7 dispcrsant. After ball milling for about 48 hr. the slurry was dried by rotan,-evaporation, ground, sieved (80 mesh screen) and uniaxially pressed at about 879 kg/cm' (12.5 kpsi) into 5.1 cm (2 inch) diameter discs. The discs were fired at maximum temperatures ranging from 1150 to 1300 °C and held there for 2 to 6 hr. The heating and cooling rates were as follows;<br><br>
Three-point bending tests specimens were sliced from the discs (1 nmi thick x 3 mm wide) with a diamond saw and tested. X-ray diffraction ol' the porcelains indicated corundum and mullite as the only crystalline phases present. The results are summarized in Table 1, immediately following.<br><br><br><br>
Example 2<br>
The starting materials were the same as in Example 1, in the proportions set forth in Table 2. The non-plastic materials (corundum, feldspar, and bismuth subcarbonate) were added to a 1.0 L mill jar together with 1100g Bunmdum cylindrical milling media and 185 g deionized water. After ball milling for 24 hr, the clays were added with an additional 15 g deionized water and about 4 g Darvan-7 dispersant. The slurry was milled for another 5 hr. The slurry was dried by rotary evaporation, ground, sieved (80 mesh screen) and uniaxially pressed at about 879 kg/cm^ (12.5 kpsi) into 2 inch diameter discs. The discs were fired at maximum temperatures ranging fi-om 1150 to 1260 °C and held at the maximum temperature for 0 to 6 hr. The heating and cooling rates were as specified for Example 1, except that for samples fired at 1260 °C the firing schedule was: 32 to 300 °C in 4 hr, 300 °C to 570 °C in 8 hr, 570 to 900 °C in 8 hr, 900 to 1260 °C in 9 hr, 1260 to 800 °C in 8 hr, and 800 to 32 °C in 25 hr. Three point bending tests were performed as specified in Example 1. Again, x-ray diffi-action confirmed the presence of corundum and mullite as the only crystalline phases. The results are summarized in Table 2.<br><br><br><br><br>
Example 3<br>
Corundum (25 wt %), potash feldspar (10 wt %), clay (57.5 wt %), and a bismuth-containing fluxing material (7.5 wt %) were added to a 1.0 L jar mill with 1300 g Burundum cylindrical grinding media, 250 g deionized water, and 4 g Darvan-7 dispersant. The wt % of the bismuth-containing fluxing material was calculated based on an equivalent amount of bismuth trioxide. The total amount of solid ingredients was about 238 g. After ball milling the formulation for 48 hr, the slurry is dried by rotary evaporation, hand ground, sieved using an 80 mesh screen and uniaxially pressed to 879 kg/cm (12.5 kpsi) into 5.1 cm diameter discs. The discs were fired from 25 °C to 1100 °C at a rate of 135 °C/hr, held at 110 °C for 12 hr, and cooled to room temperature at 135 °C/min. Three-point bending test specimens were cut from the fired discs (1 mm thick x 3 m wide) using a diamond saw and tested to failure. The results are summarized in Table 3.<br><br>
