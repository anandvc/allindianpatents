				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention pertains to the field of variable valve timing<br>
(VCT) systems. More particularly, the invention pertains to a VCT<br>
mechanism having hydraulic cushioning.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
The performance of an internal combustion engine can be<br>
improved by the use of dual camshafts, one to operate the intake<br>
valves of the various cylinders of the engine and the other to<br>
operate the exhaust valves. Typically, one of such camshafts is<br>
driven by the crankshaft of the engine, through a sprocket and<br>
chain drive or a belt drive, and the other of such camshafts is<br>
driven by the first, through a second sprocket and chain drive or<br>
a second belt drive. Alternatively, both of the camshafts can be<br>
driven by a single crankshaft powered chain drive or belt drive.<br>
Engine performance in an engine with dual camshafts can be<br>
further improved, in terms of idle quality, fuel economy, reduced<br>
emissions or increased torque, by changing the positional<br>
relationship of one of the camshafts, usualy the camshaft which<br>
operates to intake valves of the engine, relative to the other<br>
camshaft and relative to the crankshaft, to thereby vary the<br>
timing of the engine in terms of the operation of intake valves<br>
relative to its exhaust valves or in terms of the operation of<br>
its valves relative to the position of the crankshaft.<br><br>
Consideration of information disclosed by the following US. Patents, which are all<br>
herein incorporated bY reference, is useful when exploring the background of the present<br>
invention.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5.002,023 describes a VCT system within the field of the invention<br>
in which the system hydraulics includes a pair of oppositely acting hydraulic cylinders<br>
with appropriate hydraulic flow elements to selectively transfer hydraulic fluid from one<br>
of the cylinders to the other, or vice versa, to therein advance or retard the circumferential<br>
position on of a camshaft relative to a crankshaft. The control system utilizes a control<br>
valve in which the exhaustion of hydraulic fluid from one or another of the oppositely<br>
acting cylinders is permitted by moving a spool within the valve one way or another from<br>
its centered or null position. The movement of the spool occurs in response to an increase<br>
or decrease in control hydraulic pressure, Pc, on one end of the spool and the relationship<br>
between the hydraulic force on such end and an oppositely direct mechanical force on the<br>
other end which results from a compression spring that acts thereon.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,107,804 describes an alternate type of VCT system within the<br>
field of the invention in which the system hydraulics include a vane having lobes within an<br>
enclosed housing which replace the oppositely acting cylinders disclosed by the<br>
aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 5,002,023. The vane is oscillatable with respect to the<br>
housing, with appropriate hydraulic flow elements to transfer hydraulic fluid within the<br>
housing from one side of a lobe to the other, or vice versa, to thereby oscillate the vane<br>
with respect to the housing in one direction or the other, an action which is effective to<br>
advance or retard the position of the camshaft relative to the crankshaft. The control<br>
system of this VCT system is identical to that divulged in U.S. Patent No. 5,002,023, using<br>
the same type of spool valve responding to the same type of forces acting thereon.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,172,659 and 5,184,578 both address the problems of the<br>
aforementioned types of VCT systems created by the attempt to balance the hydraulic<br>
force exerted against one end of the spool and the mechanical force exerted against the<br>
other end. The improved control system disclosed in both U.S. Patent Nos. 5,172,659 and<br>
5,184,578 utilizes hydraulic force on both ends of the spool. The hydraulic force on one<br>
end results from the directly applied Indraulic fluid from the engine oil gallery at full<br><br>
hydraulic pressure, Ps. The hydraulic force on the other end of the spool results from a<br>
hydraulic cylinder or other force multiplier which acts thereon in response to system<br>
hydraulic fluid at reduced pressure. Pc. from a PWM solenoid. Because the force at each<br>
of the opposed ends of the spool is hydraulic in origin, based on the same hydraulic fluid,<br>
changes in pressure or viscosity of the hydraulic fluid will be self-negating, and \\ ill not<br>
affect the centered or null position of the spool.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5.289,805 provides an implied VCI method which utilizes a<br>
hydraulic PWM spool position control and an advanced control algorithm that yields a<br>
prescribed set point tracking behavior with a high degree of robustness.<br>
In U.S Patent No. 5,361,735, a camshaft has a vane secured to an end for non-<br>
oscillating rotation. The cam-shaft also carries a timing belt driven pulley which can rotate<br>
with the camshaft but which is oscillatable with respect to the camshaft. The vane has<br>
opposed lobes which are received in opposed recesses, respectively, of the pulley. The<br>
camshaft tends to change in reaction to torque pulses which it experiences during its<br>
normal operation and it is permitted to advance or retard by selectively blocking or<br>
permitting the flow of engine oil from the recesses by controlling the position of a spool<br>
within a valve body of a control valve in response to a signal from an engine control unit.<br>
The spool is urged in a given direction by rotary linear motion translating means which is<br>
rotated by an electric motor, preferably of the stepper motor type.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,497,738 shows a control system which eliminates the hydraulic<br>
force on one end of a spool resulting from directly applied hydraulic fluid from the engine<br>
oil gallery at full hydraulic pressure, Ps, utilised by previous embodiments of the VCT<br>
system. The force on the other end of the vented spool results from an electromechanical<br>
actuator, preferably of the variable force solenoid type, which acts directly upon the<br>
vented spool in response to an electronic signal issued from an engine control unit ("ECU")<br>
which monitors various engine parameters. The ECU receives signals from sensors<br>
corresponding to camshaft and crankshaft positions and utilizes this information to<br>
calculate a relative phase angle. A closed-loop feedback system which corrects for any<br>
phase angle error is preferably employed. The use of a variable force solenoid solves the<br>
problem of sluggish dynamic response. Such a device can be designed to be as fast as the<br>
mechanical response of the spool valve, and certainly much faster than the conventional<br><br>
(fully hydraulic) differential pressure control system. The faster response allows the use of<br>
increased closed-loop gain, making the system less sensitive to component tolerances and<br>
operating environment.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5.657.725 shows a control system which utilizes engine oil<br>
pressure for actuation. The system includes A camshaft has a vane secured to an end<br>
thereof for non-oscillating rotation therewith. The camshaft also carries a housing which<br>
can rotate with the camshaft but which is oscillatable with the camshaft. The vane has<br>
opposed lobes which are received in opposed recesses, respectively, of the housing. The<br>
recesses have greater circumferential extent than the lobes to permit the vane and housing<br>
to oscillate with respect to one another, and thereby permit the camshaft to change in<br>
phase relative to a crankshaft. The camshaft tends to change direction in reaction to<br>
engine oil pressure and/or camshaft torque pulses which it experiences during its normal<br>
operation, and it is permitted to either advance or retard by selectively blocking or<br>
permitting the flow of engine oil through the return lines from the recesses by controlling<br>
the position of a spool within a spool valve body in response to a signal indicative of an<br>
engine operating condition from an engine control unit. The spool is selectively<br>
positioned by controlling hydraulic loads on its opposed end in response to a signal from<br>
an engine control unit. The vane can be biased to an extreme position to provide a<br>
counteractive force to a unidirectionally acting frictional torque experienced by the<br>
camshaft during rotation.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,247.434 shows a multi-position variable camshaft timing system<br>
actuated by engine oil. Within the system, a hub is secured to a camshaft for rotation<br>
synchronous with the camshaft, and a housing circumscribes the hub and is rotatable with<br>
the hub and the camshaft and is further oscillatable with respect to the hub and the<br>
camshaft within a predetermined angle of rotation. Driving vanes are radially disposed<br>
within the housing and cooperate with an external surface on the hub, while driven vanes<br>
are radially disposed in the hub and cooperate with an internal surface of the housing. A<br>
locking device, reactive to oil pressure, prevents relative motion between the housing and<br>
the hub. A controlling device controls the oscillation of the housing relative to the hab.<br><br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,250.265 slums a variable valve timing system with actuator<br>
locking for internal combustion engine. The system comprising a variable camshaft<br>
timing system comprising a camshaft with a vane secured to the camshaft for rotation with<br>
the camshaft but not for oscillation with respect to the camshaft. The vane has a<br>
circumferentially extending plurality of lobes projecting radially outwardly therefrom and<br>
is surrounded by an annular housing that has a corresponding plurality of recesses each of<br>
which receives one of the lobes and has a circumferential extent greater than the<br>
circumferential extent of the lobe received therein to permit oscillation of the housing<br>
relative to the vane and the camshaft while the housing rotates with the camshaft and the<br>
vane. Oscillation of the housing relative to the vane and the camshaft is actuated by<br>
pressurized engine oil in each of the recesses on opposed sides of the lobe therein, the oil<br>
pressure in such recess being preferably derived in part from a torque pulse in the<br>
camshaft as it rotates during its operation. An annular locking plate is positioned coaxially<br>
with the camshaft and the annular housing and is moveable relative to the annular housing<br>
along a longitudinal central axis of the camshaft between a first position, where the<br>
locking plate engages the annular housing to prevent its circumferential movement relative<br>
to the vane and a second position where circumferential movement of the annular housing<br>
relative to the vane is permitted. The locking plate is biased by a spring toward its first<br>
position and is urged away from its first position toward its second position by engine oil<br>
pressure, to which it is exposed by a passage leading through the camshaft, when engine<br>
oil pressure is sufficiently high to overcome the spring biasing force, which is the only<br>
lime when it is desired to change the relative positions of the annular housing and the vane.<br>
The movement of the locking plate is controlled by an engine electronic control unit either<br>
through a closed loop control system or an open loop control system.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6.263,846 shows a control valve strategy for vane-type variable<br>
camshaft timing system. The strategy involves an internal combustion engine that<br>
includes a camshaft and hub secured to the camshaft for rotation therewith, where a<br>
housing circumscribes the hub and is rotatable with the hub and the camshaft, and is<br>
further oscillatablc with respect to the hub and camshaft. Driving vanes are radially<br>
inwardly disposed in the housing and cooperate with the hub, while driven vanes are<br>
radially outwardly disposed in the hub to cooperate with the housing and also<br>
circumferentially alternate with the driving vanes to define circumferentially alternating<br><br>
advance and retard chambers A configuration for controlling the oscillation of the<br>
housing relative to the hub includes an electronic engine control unit, and an advancing<br>
control valve that is responsive to the electronic engine control unit and that regulates<br>
engine oil pressure to and from the advance chambers. A retarding control valve<br>
responsive to the electronic engine control unit regulates engine oil pressure to and from<br>
the retard chambers. An advancing passage communicates engine oil pressure between the<br>
advancing control valve and the advance chambers, while a retarding passage<br>
communicates engine oil pressure between the retarding control valve and the retard<br>
chambers.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6.31 1,655 shows multi-position variable cam timing system having<br>
a vane-mounted locking-piston device. An internal combustion engine having a camshaft<br>
and variable camshaft timing system, wherein a rotor is secured to the camshaft and is<br>
rotatable but non-oscillatable with respect to the camshaft is discribed. A housing<br>
circumscribes the rotor, is rotatable with both the rotor and the camshaft, and is further<br>
oscillatable with respect to both the rotor and the camshaft between a fully retarded<br>
position and a fully advanced position. A locking configuration prevents relative motion<br>
between the rotor and the housing, and is mounted within either the rotor or the housing,<br>
and is respectively and releasably engageable w ith the other of either the rotor and the<br>
housing in the fully retarded position, the fully advanced position, and in positions<br>
therebetween. The locking device includes a locking piston having keys terminating one-<br>
end thereof, and serrations mounted opposite the keys on the locking piston for<br>
interlocking the rotor to the housing. A controlling configuration controls oscillation of<br>
the rotor relative to the housing.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,374,787 shows a multi-position variable camshaft timing system<br>
actuated by engine oil pressure. A hub is secured to a camshaft for rotation synchronous<br>
with the camshaft, and a housing circumscribes the hub and is rotatable with the hub and<br>
the camshaft and is further oscillatable with respect to the hub and the camshaft within a<br>
predetermined angle of rotation. Driving vanes are radially disposed within the housing<br>
and cooperate with an external surface on the hub, while driven vanes are radially<br>
disposed in the hub and cooperate with an internal surface of the housing. A locking<br><br>
device, reactive to oil pressure, prevents relative motion between the housing and the hub.<br>
A controlling device controls the oscillation of the housing relative to the hub.<br>
it has become more common for variable camshaft timing mechanisms to be made<br>
in a vane/housing format. Working hydraulic chambers are created by imposing either<br>
single or multiple vanes of a rotor attached to the camshaft into a cavity in a housing that<br>
is attached to the camshaft sprocket. The circumferential length of the pocket or cavitv in<br>
the housing determines the relative phase travel of the camshaft relative to the<br>
sprocket/housing. The control is accomplished by exhausting fluid such as oil from one<br>
chamber while simultaneously filling the opposing chamber. I his causes the variable<br>
camshaft timing mechanism to move the camshaft relative to the crankshaft manifested in<br>
a phase position.<br>
The rate of change of the camshaft is determined in part by how fast the oil can<br>
exhaust from the resisting or draining hydraulic chamber. As the rotor of the VCT reaches<br>
the end of its travel limited by the cavity of the housing, the rotor will impact the housing<br>
and cause undesirable noise. As can be seen, there is need in a phaser to reduce the noise<br>
at the end of travel and keeping suitable rate of change in the phase position of the<br>
camshaft.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, a vane-type VCT phaser comprises a<br>
housing (1), the outside of which has sprocket teeth (8) which<br>
mesh with and are driven by timing chain (9).Inside the housing<br>
(1). a cavity including fluid chambers (6) and (7) is defined.<br>
Coaxially within the housing (1), free to rotate<br>
relative to the housing, is a rotor (2) with vanes (5)<br><br>
which fit between the clumbers (6) and (7). and a central control valve (4) which routes<br>
pressurized oil via passages (12) and (13) to chambers (6) and (7), respectively<br>
Pressurized oil introduced by valve (4) into passages (12) will push vanes (5)<br>
counterclockwise relative to the housing (1), forcing oil out of chambers (6) into passages<br>
(13) and into valve (4). It will be recognized by one skilled in the art that this description<br>
is common to vane phasers in general, and the specific arrangement of vanes, chambers,<br>
passages and valves shown in figure 1 may be varied within the teachings of the invention.<br>
For example, the number of vanes and their location can be changed, some phasers have<br>
only a single vane, others as many as a dozen, and the vanes might be located on the<br>
housing and reciprocate within chambers on the rotor. The housing might be driven by a<br>
chain or belt or gears, and the sprocket teeth might be gear teeth or a toothed pulley for a<br>
belt.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2a. in the phaser of the invention, a detailed description of<br>
passages (12) and (13) to chambers (6) and (7) is shown. Vane (5) has a first wall (15)<br>
and a second wall (14) on its first side and its opposing second side respectively. When<br>
vane (5) oscillates within the cavity comprising the chambers (6) and (7), the movement<br>
thereof is stopped by the physical limitations of the housing (1). Specifically, the physical<br>
limitations to the movement of vane (5) are a first chamber wall (16) in fluid chamber (6)<br>
and an opposing second chamber wall (18) in fluid chamber (7).<br>
As discussed in the Background section (supra) of the present application,<br>
undesirable noise occurs when vane (5) comes in contact with housing (1). By way of a<br>
specific example, when second wall (14) of vane (5) is stopped by second chamber wall<br>
(18). noise occurs. Similarly, when first wall (15) of vane (5) is stopped by first chamber<br>
wall (16), undesirable noise is generated as well.<br>
The present invention introduces structures that impede the impact of vane (5)<br>
movement within the cavity of housing (1). fhe structures include introducing a first<br>
distance (20) and a second distance (22) at each side of vane (5) on rotor (2). Distance (20)<br>
is defined by two terminal points, first terminal point (20a) and second terminal point (20b)<br>
respectively. Similarly, distance (22) is defined b\ two terminal points, first terminal<br>
point (22a) and second terminal point (22b) respectively. First terminal points (20a, 22a)<br><br>
can be considered as located both within vane (5) and rotor (2) with vane (5) being an<br>
extension of the rotor (2). In other words, within a neighborhood or close proximity of<br>
points (20a, 22a), there are at least one point defined on vane (5) and at least one point<br>
defined on rotor (2). Second terminal points (20b. 22b) are only located in rotor (2)<br>
portion are at distances (20, 22) respectively to vane (5). Further, second terminal points<br>
(20b, 22b) terminate at the openings or ports of passages ( 12) and (13) respectively at<br>
locations wherein passages (12) and (13) end or terminate at the cavity of housing (1).<br>
The lengths or dimension of distances (20, 22) are determined by design choices.<br>
Further, the length and shape of distances (20, 22) may be identical or different. However,<br>
distances (20, 22) must satisfy one limitation which is, being part of rotor (2). they must<br>
rotate past the cavity portions of housing (1) on each side of the cavity respectively. By<br>
way of example the distances (20, 22) may be a line segment or an arc of the<br>
circumference of the rotor (2). By way of example, point (20b) needs to rotate past wall<br>
(16).<br>
Referring to Fig. 2B, the process that exhaust the fluid of chamber (6) ol the<br>
present invention is described. Direction 24 indicates the rotating movement of rotor (2)<br>
in relation to housing (1) with rotor (2) having vanes rigidly attached thereto (only one<br>
shown, i.e. vane 5). The fluid in chamber (6) is exhausted normally from the hydraulic<br>
chamber (6) and simultaneously into chamber (7) according to normal phasing operation.<br>
The flow operates in such a way that actuation rate of the VCT during normal phasing<br>
operation is not disturbed until the rotor (2) nears or is in the proximity of the end of its<br>
travel. At this point the flow of fluid (26) at exhaust port in the proximity of second<br>
terminal point (20b) would be restricted by a close clearance defined between rotor (2) and<br>
housing (1). Therefore the relative motion or rotation between rotor (2) and housing (1) is<br>
gradually decelerated. Eventually the VCT rotor (2) will come to a stop and thus limit the<br>
impact energy with which the rotor (2) impacts the housing (1).<br>
It is noted that the present invention contemplates application in and type VCT<br>
mechanism including Cam Torque Actuated (CTA), or oil pressure actuated mechanisms.<br>
It is further noted that normal phasing operation is defined as the rate of change of<br>
the cam shaft when passages are fully within the cavity of the housing (1).<br><br>
Referring to Fig. 3. another embodiment of the present invention is shown. A pair<br>
of separate inlet sources (28, 30) is introduced each with a check valve (32) and a separate<br>
exhaust ports (12, 13) respectively. As can be seen, the phaser of VCT system would have<br>
an unlimited supply of fluid to till the chambers (6,7) and their respective exhaust ports<br>
(12, 13)thereby limiting the velocity of the rotor (2) near the end of travel. Thus good<br>
VCT response in all directions is achieved while limiting the velocity and thus the impact<br>
energy as the vane (5) approaches its mechanical stops due to the physical limitations of<br>
the housing cavity.<br>
As discussed supra, the rate of change of the camshaft is determined, in part, by<br>
how fast fluid can exhaust from the resisting hydraulic chamber. As the rotor (2) of the<br>
VCT reaches the end of its travel, as limited by the housing (1), the rotor (2) will impact<br>
the housing (I) and cause undesirable noise. The present invention permits the fluid to<br>
exhaust normally from the hydraulic chamber and thus does not limit the actuation rate of<br>
the VCT during normal phasing until the rotor nears the end of its travel. At this point the<br>
exhaust port would be restricted by the close clearance between the rotor (2) and the<br>
housing (1) by the provision of the distances (20, 22) at each end of the housing cavity<br>
respectively. In order to facilitate the normal fluid flow, separate inlet passages (28, 30)<br>
cures the possible defect of insufficient flow out of the exhaust chamber to the inlet<br>
chamber (see Fig. 3). Without the separate inlet passage, fluid might not be exhausted<br>
sufficiently during the end of travel time segments. The end result may be insufficient<br>
fluid flow out of the exhaust chamber into the opposite chamber. However, the vane still<br>
moves in that the volume of the opposite chamber is increasing. This increase may cause<br>
the opposite chamber to draw undesirable material such as ambient air around the phaser.<br>
The present invention gradually decelerates the VCT rotor (2) to a stop, thus<br>
limiting the impact energy with which the rotor (2) impacts the housing (1). The present<br>
invention contemplates application in any type VCT mechanism.<br>
An improvement on ef the structure described supra would be to separate the inlet<br>
fluid and the exhaust port in each hydraulic chamber as shown in Fig. 2B. Once the rotor<br>
(2) reaches its end of travel, it not only restricts fluid leaving the exhaust hydraulic<br>
chamber but it could restrict the oil entering the inlet hydraulic chamber a.s well. This<br><br>
could cause a delay in actuation of the VCT mechanism in the opposite direction.<br>
However, if a separate inlet source is introduced with a check valve and a separate exhaust<br>
port is used as shown in Fig. 3, then the VCT has an unlinked supply of fluid to fill the<br>
chamber and an exhaust port that limited the velocity of the rotor near the end of travel.<br>
This would give the VCT good response in all phaset directions while limiting the velocity<br>
and thus the impact energy when it approaches the mechanical stops.<br>
For example, in Fig. 3 when fluid is exhausting from chamber (6) via passage (13).<br>
at the end of travel of vane (5) the fluid flow rate may be decreased due to the structure of<br>
the present invention. At this juncture, chamber (7) still needs to be tilled with sufficient<br>
fluid flow of a suitable rate. If the flow is below a threshold value, undesirable effects<br>
including entry of ambient air may get into chamber (7). The introduction of inflow<br>
passage (30) reduces or solves the undesirable effect problem by introducing sufficient<br>
fluid flow rate thereby resulting in sufficient fluid flow into chamber (7). Similar results<br>
occur at the opposite end of travel of the vane.<br>
It is noted that only a portion of the phaser is shown here. The phaser may have<br>
more than one similar structure as shown in Figs. 2A. 2B. or 3. For example, the phaset<br>
may have 2, 4, or 8 similar structures.<br>
Fig. 4 is a schematic depiction that shows, in part, the VCT system of the present<br>
invention. A null position is shown in Fig. 4. Solenoid (120) engages spool valve (114)<br>
by exerting a first force upon the same on a first end (29). The first force is met by a force<br>
of equal strength exerted by spring (21) upon a second end (17) of spool valve 114 thereby<br>
maintaining the null position. The spool valve (114) includes a first block (19) and a<br>
second block (23) each of which blocks fluid flow respectively.<br>
The phaser (542) includes a vane (558), a housing (57) using the vane (558) to<br>
delimit an advance chamber A and a retard chamber R therein. Typically, the housing (57)<br>
and the vane (558) are coupled to crank shaft (not shown; and cam shaft (also not shown)<br>
respectively. Vane (558) is permitted to move relative to the phaser housing by adjusting<br>
the fluid quantity of advance and retard chambers A and R. If it is desirous to move vane<br>
(558) toward the retard side, solenoid (120) pushes spool valve (114) further right from the<br>
original null position such that liquid in chamber A drains out along duct (40) through duct<br><br>
(180). The fluid further flows or is in fluid communication with an outside sink (not<br>
shown) by means of having block (19) sliding further right to allow said fluid<br>
communication to occur. Simultaneously, fluid from a source passes through duct (51)<br>
and is in one-way fluid communication with duct (70) by means of one-way valve (15).<br>
thereby supplying fluid to chamber R via duet (50). This can occur because block (23)<br>
moved further right causing the above one-way fluid communication to occur. When the<br>
desired vane position is reached, the spool valve is commanded to move back left to its<br>
null position, thereby maintaining a new phase relationship of the crank and cam shaft.<br>
Referring to Fig. 5, a Cam Torque Actuated (CTA) VCT system applicable to the<br>
present invention is shown. The CTA system uses torque reversals in camshaft caused by<br>
the forces of opening and closing engine valves to move vane (942). The control valve in a<br>
CTA system allows fluid flow from advance chamber (92) to retard chamber (93) or vice<br>
versa, allowing vane (942) to move, or stops fluid flow, locking vane (942) in position.<br>
CTA phaser may also have oil input (913) to make up for losses due to leakage, but does<br>
not use engine oil pressure to move phaser.<br>
The detailed operation of CTA phaser system is as follows, fig. 5 depicts a null<br>
position in that ideally no fluid flow occurs because the spool valve (140) stops fluid<br>
circulation at both advance end (98) and retard end (910). When cam angular relationship<br>
is required to be changed, vane (942) necessarily needs to move. Solenoid (920), which<br>
engages spool valve (140), is commanded to move spool (140) away from the null position<br>
thereby causing fluid within the CTA circulation to flow. It is pointed out that the CTA<br>
circulation ideally uses only local fluid without any fluid coming from source (913).<br>
However, during normal operation, some fluid leakage occurs and the fluid deficit needs<br>
to be replenished by the source (913) via a one way valve (914). The fluid in this case<br>
may be engine oil. The source (913) may be the oil pan.<br>
There are two scenarios for the CTA phaser system. First, there is the Advance<br>
scenario, wherein an Advance chamber (92) needs to be filled with more fluid than in the<br>
null position. In other words, the size or volume of chamber (92) is increased. The<br>
advance scenario is accomplished by way of the following.<br><br>
Solenoid (920) pushes the spool valve (140) toward right such that the left portion<br>
(919) of the spool valve (140) still stops fluid flow at the advance end (98). But<br>
simultaneously the right portion (917) moved further right leaving retard portion (916) in<br>
fluid communication with duct (99). Because of the inherent torque reversals in camshaft,<br>
drained fluid from the retard chamber (93) feeds the same into advance chamber (92) via<br>
one-way valve (96) and duct (94).<br>
Similarly, for the second scenario which is the retard scenario wherein a Retard<br>
chamber (93) needs to be filled with more fluid than in the null position. In other words.<br>
the size or volume of chamber (93) is increased. The reta-d scenario is accomplished by<br>
way of the following.<br>
Solenoid (920) reduces its engaging force with the spool valve (140) such that an<br>
elastic member (921) forces spool (140) to move left. The right portion (917) of the spool<br>
valve (140) stops fluid flow at the retard end (910). But simultaneously the left portion<br>
(919) moves further right leaving Advance portion (98) in fluid communication with duct<br>
(99). Because of the inherent torque reversals in camshaft, drained fluid from the Advance<br>
chamber (92) feeds the same into Retard chamber (93) via one-way valve (97) and duct<br>
(95).<br>
As can be appreciated, with the CTA cam phaser, the inherent cam torque energy is<br>
used as the motive force to re-circulate oil between the chambers (92. 93) in the phaser. This<br>
varying cam torque arises from alternately compressing, then releasing, each valve spring, as<br>
the camshaft rotates.<br>
It should be noted that Figs 4 and 5 are used to show different types of VCT system<br>
suitable for the present invention. Some structures are not depicted in detail. For these details.<br>
refer to Figs 2-3.<br>
The following are terms and concepts relating to the present invention.<br>
It is noted the hydraulic fluid or fluid referred to supra are actuating fluids.<br>
Actuating fluid is the fluid which moves the vanes in a vane phaser. Typically the<br>
actuating fluid includes engine oil, but could be separate hydraulic fluid. The VCT system<br>
of the present invention may be a Cam Torque Actuated (CTA)VCT system in which a<br><br>
VCT system that uses torque reversals in camshaft caused by the forces of opening and<br>
closing engine valves to move the vane. The control valve in a CIA. system allows fluid<br>
flow from advance chamber to retard chamber, allowing vane to move, or stops flow,<br>
locking \ane in position. The CIA phaser may also have oil input to make up for losses<br>
due to leakage, but does not use engine oil pressure to move phaser. A vane is a radial<br>
element actuating fluid acts upon, housed in chamber. A vane phaser is a phaser which is<br>
actuated by vanes moving in chambers.<br>
There may be one or more camshaft per engine. The camshaft may be driven by a<br>
belt or chain or gears or another camshaft. Lobes may exist on camshaft to push on valves.<br>
In a multiple camshaft engine, most often has one shaft for exhaust valves one shaft for<br>
intake valves. A "V" type engine usually has two camshafts (one for each bank) or four<br>
(intake and exhaust for each bank).<br>
A chamber or cavity is defined as a space within which vane rotates. The chamber<br>
may be divided into advance chamber (makes valves open sooner relative to crankshaft)<br>
and retard chamber (makes valves open later relative to crankshaft). A check valve is<br>
defined as a valve which permits fluid flow in only one direction. A closed loop is defined<br>
as a control system which changes one characteristic in response to another, then checks to<br>
see if the change was made correctly and adjusts the action to achieve the desired result<br>
(e.g. moves a valve to change phaser position in response to a command from the F.CT '.<br>
then checks the actual phaser position and moves valve again to correct position). The<br>
control valve is a valve which controls flow of fluid to phaser. The control valve may<br>
exist within the phaser in CTA system. The control valve may be actuated by oil pressure<br>
or a solenoid. Crankshaft takes power from pistons and drives transmission and camshaft.<br>
Spool valve is defined as the control valve of spool type. Typically the spool rides in bore,<br>
connects one passage to another. Most often the spool is most often located on center axis<br>
of rotor of a phaser.<br>
A differential Pressure Control System (DPCS) is a system for moving a spool<br>
valve, which uses actuating fluid pressure on each end of the spool. One end of the spool<br>
is larger than the other, and fluid on that end is controlled (usually by a Pulse Width<br>
Modulated (PWM) valve on the oil pressure), full supply pressure is supplied to the other<br><br>
end of the spool (hence differential pressure). The valve Control Unit (VCU) is a control<br>
circuitry for controlling the VCT system. Typically the VCU acts in response to<br>
command from ECU.<br>
A driven shaft is any shaft which receives power (in VCT, must often camshaft).<br>
Driving shaft is any shaft which supplies power (in VCT, most often crankshaft, but could<br>
drive one camshaft from another camshaft). ECU is an Engine Control Unit that is the<br>
car's computer. Engine Oil is the oil used to lubricate engine, pressure can be tapped to<br>
actuate phaser through control valve.<br>
The housing is defined as the outer part of phaser with chambers. The outside of<br>
housing can be pulley (for timing belt), sprocket (for timing chain) or gear (for timing<br>
gear). Hydraulic fluid is any special kind of oil used in hydraulic cylinders, similar to<br>
brake fluid or power steering fluid. Hydraulic fluid is not necessarily the same as engine<br>
oil. Typically the present invention uses "actuating fluid". The lock pin is disposed to<br>
lock a phaser in position. Usually the lock pin is used when oil pressure is too low to hold<br>
phaser, as during engine start or shutdown.<br>
An oil Pressure Actuated (OPA) VCT system uses a conventional phaser. where<br>
engine oil pressure is applied to one side of the vane or the other to move the vane.<br>
An open loop is used in a control system which changes one characteristic in<br>
response to another (say, moves a valve in response to a command from the ECU) without<br>
feedback to confirm the action.<br>
Phase is defined as the relative angular position of camshaft and crankshaft (or<br>
camshaft and another camshaft, if phaser is driven by another cam). A phaser is defined<br>
as the entire part which mounts to cam. The phaser is typically made up of rotor and<br>
housing and possibly spool valve and check valves. A piston phaser is a phaser actuated<br>
by pistons in cylinders of an internal combustion engine. The rotor is the inner part of the<br>
phaser, which is attached to a cam shaft.<br>
Pulse-width Modulation (PWM) provides a varying force or pressure by changing<br>
the timing of on/off pulses of voltage or fluid pressure. The solenoid is an electrical<br>
actuator which uses electrical current flowing in coil to move a mechanical arm. A<br><br>
variable force solenoid (VFS) is a solenoid whose actuating force can be varied, usually by<br>
PMW of supply voltage or with a current controller VES is an alternative to an on off<br>
(all or nothing) solenoid.<br>
The sprocket is a member used with chains such as an engine timing chains. Limiting<br>
is defined as the relationship between the time a piston reaches a defined position usually<br>
top dead center (TDO) and the time something else happens. For example, in or<br>
VVI systems, liming usually relates to when a valve opens or closes. Ignition timing<br>
relates to when the spark plug fires.<br>
A Torsion Assist (TA) or Torque Assisted phaser is a variation on the OPA phaser.<br>
which adds a check valve in the oil supply line (i.e. a single check valve embodiment) or a<br>
check valve in the supply line to each chamber (i.e. two check valve embodiment). The<br>
check valve blocks oil pressure pulses due to torque reversals from propagating back into<br>
the oil system, and stop the vane from moving backward due to torque reversals. In the<br>
TA system, motion of the vane due to forward torque effects is permitted; hence the<br>
expression "torsion assist" is used. Graph of vane movement is step function<br>
A VCT system includes a phaser. control valvets). control valve actuator(s) and<br>
control circuitry. Variable Cam Timing (VCT) is a process, not a thing, that refers to<br>
controlling and/or varying the angular relationship (phase) between one or more camshafts,<br>
which drive the engine's intake and/or exhaust valves. The angular relationship also<br>
includes phase relationship between cam and the crankshafts, in which the crank shall is<br>
connected to the pistons.<br><br>
