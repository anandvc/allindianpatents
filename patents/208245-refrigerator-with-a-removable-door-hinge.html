REFRIGERATOR WITH A REMOVABLE DOOR HINGE<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a refrigerator, and more particularly, to a refrigerator capable of reducing a width thereof easily by removing a hinge member from a body thereof.<br>
2.	Prior Art<br>
FIG. 6'is a front view of a conventional refrigerator. The refrigerator has a body 101 for forming a freezing compartment (not shown) and a fresh food compartment 105 which are partitioned from each other by a partitioning wall, and a freezing compartment door 107 and a fresh food compartment door 109 which are respectively installed on front sides of the freezing compartment and the fresh food compartment 105. On both comers of the upper front end part of the body 101, upper hinge brackets 111 protruding frontward are installed, and hinge pins (not shown) protruding downward are formed on the respective upper hinge brackets 111.<br>
At both comers of the lower front end part of the body 101, lower hinge brackets 113 having reversed L-shape substantially are installed. Each of the lower hinge brackets 113 has, as shown in FIG. 7, a fixing part 114 formed with a plurality of screw holes, and a support part 115 extended horizontally from the fixing part 114. A hinge pin 117 protrudes upward from the support part 115, and accommodating recesses 108 for accommodating the hinge pin of the upper hinge bracket 111 and the hinge pin 117 of the lower hinge bracket 113 are respectively formed on the upper and the lower comer area of the fresh food compartment door 109.<br>
Meanwhile, there is a recent tendency that refrigerators become large-sized more and more. There occurs a case that when such a large-sized refrigerator is conveyed, the refrigerator cannot enter a room through a gate of the room since the width thereof is greater than that of the room gate.    When such a<br><br>
case occurs, a worker disassembles the doors 107 and 109 of the refrigerator from the body 101 to^ reduce the width of the refrigerator, and conveys the refrigerator into the room, and then the worker reassembles the doors 107 and 109 with the body 101.<br>
However, in such a conventional refrigerator, since the hinge brackets 111 and 113 protrude from the body 101, even when the doors 107 and 109 are disassembled with the body, the width of the refrigerator is not reduced enough, whereby the hinge brackets 111 and 113 may be hooked by the edge of the gate of the room. Furthermore, in such a situation, the hinge brackets 111 and 113 may undergoes a damage. Therefore, the worker must disassemble the door 107 and 109 from the body 101 as well as the hinge brackets 111 and 113.<br>
■<br>
However, the hinge brackets 111 and 113, especially the lower hinge bracket 113, are steadfastly fixed on the body 101 by a plurality of screws so that they can support the doors 107 and 109 used for a long period of time while receiving foods to be stored in the refrigerator, the process for assembling and disassembling them is not easy and requires a lot of pains and time.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention has been proposed to overcome the above-described problems in the prior art, and accordingly it is the object of the present invention to provide a refrigerator having a hinge member capable of being removed easily, thereby reducing the width thereof without disassembling the hinge brackets after disassembling the doors, and facilitating the passage thereof through a gate of a room.<br>
To achieve the above object, the present invention provides a refrigerator having a body for forming a cooling compartment, and a door for opening/closing the cooling compartment, the refrigerator comprising: a hinge member having a hinge pin assembled on a comer of the door; and a hinge bracket fixed on the body, the hinge bracket forming a pocket part for accommodating the hinge member so as to be capable of being pulled out therefrom.<br><br>
Here, the hinge bracket has a front plate part being parallel with a front side of the body, and a flange part formed at an edge of the front plate part, the flange part being fixed on the front side of the body by a plurality of fixing screws.<br>
It is preferable that the front plate part is formed with a plurality of passing holes through which the fixing screws pass. Thus, a worker can easily fix the hinge bracket to the front surface of the refrigerator.<br>
It is more preferable that the hinge bracket has a rib extended toward an inner area of the pocket part, the rib being in contact with the hinge member. The rib functions to guide the insertion of the hinge member into the hinge bracket, and also functions to prevent the free movement of the hinge member when the hinge member is accommodated in the hinge bracket.<br>
Furthermore,   the   hinge   member   has    a   protrusion   part	protruding<br>
downward    from    a    lower    end    thereof,    and    an    accommodation	hole    foT<br>
accommodating   the  protrusion  part  is  formed  on  a  bottom  side   of	the  hinge<br>
bracket.      Accordingly,  the  hinge  member  is  fixed  to  a  position   in	the  hinge<br>
bracket.<br>
Furthermore, the refrigerator further comprises a means for adjusting a height of the hinge member with respect to the hinge bracket. The adjusting means comprises a height adjusting bolt being assembled vertically with a bottom side of the hinge bracket, the height adjusting bolt being contacted with a lower end of the hinge member. The door can be assembled and disassembled more easily by the adjusting means.<br>
According to the present invention, the width of the refrigerator is effectively reduced without disassembling the hinge bracket fixed on the body, and the damage of the hinge member is prevented while the refrigerator is conveyed.<br>
