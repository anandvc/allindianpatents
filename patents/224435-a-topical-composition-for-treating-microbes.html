COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"A TOPICAL COMPOSITION FOR TREATING MICROBES"<br>
THE PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE COMPANY, a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Ohio, of One Procter 8s Gamble Plaza, Cincinnati, Ohio 45202, United States of America, and ARCH CHEMICALS INC, of 350 Knotter Drive, Cheshire, Connecticut 06410, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
present invention relates to a topical composition for treating microbes.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to topical anti-microbial compositions and methods of treating microbial infections on the skin or scalp.   Of specific concern are methods for the treatment of dandruff and compositions which provide improved anti-dandruff activity.    In particular, the present invention relates to methods and compositions utilizing a polyvalent metal salt of pyrithione and a metal ion source.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Various anti-dandruff compositions are commercially available or otherwise known in the shampoo art. These compositions typically comprise detersive surfactants and particulate, crystalline anti-microbial agents dispersed and suspended throughout the composition. Anti¬microbial agents used for this purpose include sulfur, selenium sulfide and polyvalent metal salts of pyridinethione. During the shampooing process, these anti-microbial agents deposit on the scalp to provide anti-dandruff activity. Soluble anti-dandruff agents, such as ketoconazole, are also known in the art.<br>
Nevertheless, consumers desire an anti-dandruff shampoo which provides surperior anti-dandruff efficacy.<br>
Polyvalent metal salts of pyrithione (also known as l-hydroxy-2-pyridinetnione^2-pyridinethiol-1-oxide; 2-pyridinethione; 2-mercaptopyridine-N-oxide; pyridinethione; and cyridinethione-N-oxide) are known to be effective biocidial agents and are widely used as fungicides and bactericides in paints and metalworking fluids. Polyvalent metal salts of blyrithione are also used as fungicides and bactericides in personal care -compositions such as oot powders and anti-dandruff shampoos. The polyvalent metal salts of pyrithione are only paringly soluble in water' and include magnesium pyrithione.. barium pyrithione, bismuth<br><br>
pyrithione, strontium pyrithione, copper pyrithione, zinc pyrithione, cadmium pyrithione, and zirconium pyrithione.<br>
Zinc and copper pyrithione are especially useful as anti-microbial agents in personal care compositions. Zinc pyrithione is known as an anti-dandruff component in shampoos. Synthesis of polyvalent pyrithione salts is described in U.S. Patent No. 2,809,971 to Berstein, et al. Other patents disclosing similar compounds and processes for making them include U.S. Patents Nos. 2,786,847; 3,589,999; 3,590,035; and 3,773,770.<br>
While pyrithione biocides have proven useful for a wide range of applications, the utility of these compounds is limited to the control of select species and strains of fungi and bacteria. Further, while higher concentrations of pyrithione salts have been observed to control the growth of a wider range of organisms, the useful amount of polyvalent metal salts of pyrithione that can be added to a commercial product is limited by efficacy and economic considerations, and environmental concerns. In personal care compositions, such as shampoos, the amounts of pyrithione salts that may be added is further limited by toxicological concerns.<br>
Generally, the use of anti-microbial agents in anti-dandruff shampoos is also known in the art. However, although polyvalent metal salts of pyrithiones have been disclosed as anti¬microbial and/or anti-dandruff agents, the overall efficacy has remained relatively low. Therefore, consumers desire a shampoo which provides superior anti-dandruff efficacy versus currently marketed products. Such a superior efficacy can be difficult to achieve.<br>
For example; it was previously believed that anti-dandruff efficacy could be achieved by -"solubilizing" a zinc pyrithione complex in a strong chelating agent. One such approach, disclosed in European Patent Application No. 077,630 to Dixon was to "solubilize" zinc pyrithione in a strong chelating agent in the presence of divalent copper cations. However, the 'solubilization" process disclosed in the '630 Application actually results in the break down of the chemical structure of the zinc pyrithione complex. The resulting composition contains a complex of the chelating agent/zinc in solution with free pyrithione ions.' The free pyrithione ons are soluble in the composition. The '630 Application discloses that this approach results in a clear product that is physically stable and provides anti-dandruff benefits.<br>
Unfortunately, the downside risk to this approach is that excessive amounts of the ;oluble free pyrithione ions are known to be toxic to humans and the use of such a composition vould fall outside of the current Federal Drug Administration monograph for zinc pyrithione, naking the composition commercially unacceptable for personal care products.<br>
Metal ions, such as copper salts are also taught in the art to provide efficacy in anti¬microbial applications. Copper compounds, such as copper sulfate and cuprous oxide have been<br><br>
used widely as fungicides, antifoulants, and algaecides in a large range of applications including paints, swimming pool water, and wood products. Similarly, inorganic salts of zinc such as zinc chloride, zinc sulfate, and zinc oxide have been employed as bacteriostatic and/or fungistatic compounds in a large variety of products including paints, coatings, and antiseptics. However, copper salts and zinc salts do not possess as high a level of biocidal efficacy as might be desired for many anti-dandruff and skin care applications.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found, in accordance with the present invention, that anti-dandruff efficacy can be dramatically increased in topical compositions by the use of polyvalent metal salts of pynthione, such as zinc pyrithione, in combination with a metal ion source such as copper and zinc salts. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an anti-dandruff topical composition with improved efficacy. The improved efficacy also allows for the reduction of the levels of metal pyrithiones in anti-microbial compositions, thereby facilitating the production of safer products containing anti-microbial actives.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide topical skin and/or hair compositions which provide superior anti-dandruff efficacy. It is also an object of the present invention to provide a method for cleansing the hair and/or skin. It is also an object of the present invention to provide a method for treating athlete's foot. These, and other objects, will become readily apparent from the detailed description below.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

Volatile Carrier When the hair styling polymers described below are included in the anti-microbial impositions of the present invention, especially the hair styling shampoo embodiments, it is particularly preferable to also include a volatile carrier to solubilize the hair styling polymer, such a carrier helps disperse the hair styling polymer as water-insoluble fluid particles hroughout the composition, wherein the dispersed particles comprise the styling polymer and the 'olarile carrier. Carriers suitable for this purpose include hydrocarbons, ethers, esters, amines,<br><br>
alkyl alcohols, volatile silicone derivatives and combinations thereof, many examples of which are well known in the art.<br>
Such a volatile carrier must be water-insoluble or have a low water solubility. The selected styling polymer, however, must also be sufficiently soluble in the selected carrier to allow dispersion of the hair styling polymer and solvent combination as a separate, dispersed fluid phase in the styling shampoo composition. The carrier used must also be volatile. In this context, the term volatile means that the carrier has a boiling point of less than about 300°C, preferably from about 90°C to about 260°C, more preferably from about 100°C to about 200°C (at about one atmosphere of pressure).<br>
The concentration of a volatile carrier in the composition must be sufficient to solubilize the hair styling polymer and disperse it as a separate fluid phase in the shampoo composition. Such concentrations generally range from about 0.10% to about 10%, preferably from about 0.5% to about 8%, most preferably from about 1% to about 6%, by weight of the shampoo composition, wherein the weight ratio of styling polymer to carrier is preferably from about 10:90 to about 70:30, more preferably from about 20:80 to about 65:35, even more preferably from about 30:70 to about 60:40. If the weight ratio of styling polymer to carrier is too low, the lathering performance of the shampoo composition will be negatively affected.   If the ratio of polymer to solvent is too high, the composition becomes too viscous and causes difficulty in the dispersion of the styling polymer.    The hair styling agents should have an average particle diameter in the final shampoo product of from about 0.05 to about 100 microns, preferably from about 1 to about 25 microns, more preferably from about 0.5 to about 10 microns.

3. Select Stability Active<br>
In the styling shampoo embodiments of the present invention that include a hair styling polymer and a volatile carrier, it is also preferable that the. composition contain a select stability active.

Additionally, significantly lower levels of the crystalline, hydroxyl-containing stabilizer need to be used relative to traditional stability<br><br>
actives.  This results in enhanced deposition efficiency of the hair styling polymer onto the hair as well as reduced interactions with other shampoo components.<br>
The stabilizer suitable for use in the shampoo compositions are characterized by the general formula:<br><br>
wherein:        (x + a) is from between 11 and 17, (y + b) is from between 11 and 17, (z + c) is from between 11 and 17; preferably:    x=y=z=10, and<br>

Silicone resins can be included in the silicone conditioning agent.   These resins are<br>
highly crosslinked polymeric siloxane systems.   The crosslinking is introduced through the<br>
incorporation of trifunctional and tetrafunctional silanes with monofunctional or difunctional, or<br><br>
both, silanes during manufacture of the silicone resin. As is well understood in the art, the degree of crosslinking that is required in order to result in a silicone resin will vary according to the specific silane units incorporated into the silicone resin.   In general, silicone materials which have a sufficient level of trifunctional and tetrafunctional siloxane monomer units.(and hence, a sufficient level of crosslinking) such that they dry down to a rigid, or hard, film are considered to be silicone resins.   The ratio of oxygen atoms to silicon atoms is indicative of the level of crosslinking in a particular silicone material.   Silicone materials which have at least about 1.1 oxygen atoms per silicon atom will generally be silicone resins herein.   Preferably, the ratio of oxygen:silicon atoms is at least about 1.2:1.0. Silanes used in the manufacture of silicone resins include    monomethyl-,    dimethyl-,    trimethyl-,    monophenyl-,    diphenyl-,    methylphenyl-, monovinyl-, and methylvinyi-chlorosilanes, and tetrachlorosilane, with the methyl-substituted silanes being most commonly utilized.   Preferred resins are offered by General Electric as GE SS4230 and SS4267.   Commercially available silicone resins will generally be supplied in a dissolved form in a low viscosity volatile or nonvolatile silicone fluid. The silicone resins for use herein should be supplied and incorporated into the present compositions in such dissolved form, as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
Silicone materials and silicone resins in particular, can conveniently be identified according to a shorthand nomenclature system well known to those skilled in the art as "MDTQ" nomenclature. Under this system, the silicone is described according to presence of various siloxane monomer units which make up the silicone. Briefly, the symbol M denotes the monofunctional unit (CH3)3 SiO 5; D denotes the difunctional unit (CH3)2SiO; T denotes the<br>
trifunctional unit (CH3)3 SiO 5; and Q denotes the quadri- or tetra-functional unit SiCb. Primes<br>
of the unit symbols, e.g., M', D', T!, and Q' denote substituents other than methyl, and must be specifically defined for each occurrence. Typical alternate substituents include groups such as vinyl, phenyls, amines, hydroxyls, etc. The molar ratios of the various units, either in terms of subscripts to the symbols indicating the total number of each type of unit in the silicone (or an average thereof) or as specifically indicated ratios in combination with molecular weight complete the description of the silicone material under the MDTQ system. Higher relative molar amounts of T, Q, T and/or Q' to D, D', M and/or M' in a silicone resin is indicative of higher evels of crosslinking. As discussed before, however, the overall level of crosslinking can also be ndicated by the oxygen to silicon ratio.<br>
The silicone resins for use herein which are preferred are MQ, MT, MTQ, MDT and MDTQ resins.  Thus, the preferred silicone substiruent is methyl.  Especially preferred are MQ<br><br>
    .<br><br>
resins wherein the M:Q ratio is from about 0.5:1.0 to about 1.5:1.0 and the average molecular weight of the resin is from about 1000 to about 10,000.<br>
The weight ratio of the nonvolatile silicone fluid, having refractive index below 1.46, to the silicone resin component, when used, is preferably from about 4:1 to about 400:1, preferably this ratio is from about 9:1 to about 200:1, more preferably from about 19:1 to about 100:1, particularly when the silicone fluid component is a polydimethylsiloxane fluid or a mixture of polydimethylsiloxane fluid and polydimethylsiloxane gum as described above. Insofar as the silicone resin forms a part of the same phase in the compositions hereof as the silicone fluid, i.e. the conditioning active, the sum of the fluid and resin should be included in determining the level of silicone conditioning agent in the composition. G. Organic Conditioning Oils<br>

Methods of Manufacture<br>
The anti-microbial compositions of the present invention may be prepared by any known or otherwise effective technique, suitable for providing an anti-microbial composition provided that the resulting composition provides the excellent anti-microbial benefits described herein. Methods for preparing the anti-dandruff and conditioning shampoo embodiments of the present invention include conventional formulation and mixing techniques. A method such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,661, which description is incorporated herein by reference, could be employed, wherein the anti-microbial agent of the present invention would typically be added in the same step as the silicone premix is added in the '661 description.<br>
Methods of Use<br>
The topical anti-microbial compositions of the present invention may be used in direct application to the skin or in a conventional manner for cleansing skin and hair and controlling microbial infection (including fungal, viral, or bacterial infections) on the skin or scalp. Directly applied compositions, such as powders, are used by applying an effective amount of the composition, typically from about 1 g to about 20 g, to the skin, for example the feet.   The cleansing compositions herein are useful for cleansing the hair and scalp, and other areas of the body such as underarm, feet, and groin areas and for any other area of skin in need of treatment. An effective amount of the composition, typically from about lg to about 50g, preferably from about lg to about 20g of the composition, for cleansing hair, skin or other area of the body, is topically applied to the hair, skin or other area that has preferably been wetted, generally with water, and then rinsed off.   Application to the hair typically includes working the shampoo composition through the hair.<br><br>
A preferred method for providing anti-microbial (especially anti-dandruff) efficacy with a shampoo embodiment comprises the steps of: (a) wetting the hair with water, (b) applying an effective amount of the anti-microbial shampoo composition to the hair, and (c) rinsing the anti¬microbial shampoo composition from the hair using water. These, steps may be repeated as many times as desired to achieve the cleansing, conditioning, and anti-microbial/anti-dandruff benefits sought.<br>
It is also contemplated that when the anti-microbial active employed is zinc pyrithione, and/or if other optional hair growth regulating agents are employed, the anti-microbial compositions of the present invention, may, provide for the regulation of growth of the hair. The method of regularly using such shampoo compositions comprises repeating steps a, b, and c (above).<br>
It is also contemplated that the.compositions herein may be employed as leave-on<br>
compositions.   This method for providing anti-microbial efficacy to the skin or hair comprises<br>
:he steps of (A) applying an effective amount of the shampoo composition to the skin or hair,<br>
and (B) leaving the product on the hair for a sufficient amount of time to allow for efficacy. The<br>
remaining product may then be later rinsed from the hair with water or brushed out of the hair<br>
with any common implement or the hands.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The composition of the invention can be made by mixing one or more selected metal ion sources and one or more metal salts of pyrithione in an appropriate media or carrier, or by adding the individual components separately to the skin or hair cleansing compositions. Useful carriers are discussed more fully above.<br>
The following examples are intended to illustrate, but in no way limit the scope of the present invention. All parts and percentages are by weight and all temperatures are in degrees Celsius unless explicitly stated otherwise.<br>
Example 1: The Effect of Combining ZPT with Metal Ions on the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of Metal Ions Experiments were conducted to investigate the"'efficacy of the composition of the present invention to inhibit the survival, growth, and proliferation of microorganisms in topical compositions. The test microorganism was Malassezia furfur. The testing principle employed, Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), is discussed below, and the results are tabulated in Table I.<br><br>
The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration is indicative of anti-fungal efficacy. Generally, the lower the value of the composition, the better its anti-fungal efficacy, due to increased inherent ability of the anti-dandruff agent to inhibit the growth of microorganisms.<br>
Malassezia furfur was grown in a flask containing mDixon medium (see E. Gueho, et al. Antoinie Leeuwenhoek (1996), no. 69, 337-55, which description is incorporated by reference herein). Dilutions of solubilized anti-microbial active were then added to test tubes containing molten mDixon agar. M. furfur inoculum was added to each tube of molten agar, the tube vortexed, and the contents poured into separate sterile petri dishes. After the plates are incubated, they were observed for visible M. furfur growth. The lowest tested dilution of anti-microbial active that yields no growth is defined as the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC). Equipment/Reagents<br>
Microbe	Malassezia furfur (ATCC 14521)<br>
Erlenmeyer flask	250ml<br>
Agar medium	9.5ml mDixon agar per concentration per active tested<br>
Solvent	water, dimethyl sulfonyl oxide ("DMSO")<br>
Zinc pyridinethione       ZPT having an average particle size of about 2.5um, preserved in<br>

Experimental procedure<br>
1)	Malassezia furfur was grown in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 ml "mDIXON"<br>
medium at 320 rpm and 30°C until turbid.<br>
2)	.   Selected dilutions were prepared using an appropriate dilution series, of the anti-microbial<br>
active or combination in solvent, which allowed the sample active to be solubilized prior to addition to the final test agar. For each concentration of the ZPT samples, the solvent was "DMSO"; for other samples, the solvent was water or "DMSO" or other suitable solvent.<br>
3)	0.25 ml dilutions of anti-microbial active were added to test tubes containing 9.5 ml molten "mDKON" agar (held at 45°C in a water bath).<br>
4)	0.25 M. furfur inoculum (adjusted to 5 x 105 cfu/ml by direct count) was added to each test tube of molten agar.<br><br>
5)<br>
6)<br>
.7)<br>
Each tube was vortexed, and the contents poured into separate petri dishes. After the agar solidified, the plates inverted and incubated at 30° for 5 days. The plates were then observed for visible M. furfur growth.<br>
Table 1 shows the results of experiments testing the efficacy of ZPT in combination with several different metal ion sources against the M. furfur microorganism.<br>
As shown in Table 1, it required at least 50ppm of metal ions alone to inhibit fungal growth. When using ZPT alone, it requires 8ppm to inhibit fungal growth. Sub-MIC levels of ZPT were tested in combination with various metals to determine the resulting MIC of the metal ion. As clearly indicated in Table 1, the addition of metal ions served to potentiate the ZPT, thereby achieving MIC with sub-MIC levels of ZPT. For instance, it is shown that a combination of 4ppm ZPT with less than 0.005ppm of copper ions achieved the MIC. However, neither 4ppm of ZPT or 0.005ppm of copper ion would achieve the MIC level alone.<br><br>

Example 2      The Effect of Metal Ions on the Kill Rate Results of Zinc Pvrithione.<br>
Experiments were conducted to investigate the efficacy of the composition of the present invention to inhibit the survival, growth, and proliferation of microorganisms in topical compositions. The test microorganism was Malassezia furfur. The testing principle employed, Kill Rate Test (KRT), is discussed below, and the results are tabulated in Tables 2(a) and 2(b).<br>
The Kill Rate Test (KRT) results are indicative of anti-fungal efficacy. Generally, the greater the inhibition of fungal growth in this test, the better the anti-fungal efficacy of the compound(s) tested.<br>
A flask containing mDixon broth medium (see Gueho, et al. Antoinie Leeuwenhoek (1996), no. 69, 337-55, which description is incorporated by reference herein) was inoculated with Malassezia furfur. Specific concentrations of active(s) were then added to the flask . Samples were then withdrawn from the flask at specified time points, diluted in sterile water, and spread across the surface of a mDixon agar plate. After the plates were incubated, they were observed for visible M. furfur growth by counting the number of colonies present and converting this number into colony forming units (CFU) / ml mDixon broth.<br>
The lower the CFU/ml count, the better activity the active(s) have against M. furfur.<br>

Experimental Procedure<br>
1.	M. furfur (ATCC 14521) cultures were brought to log phase overnight in 2 Erlenmeyer flasks (125 ml) each containing 75 ml mDixon broth.<br>
2.	41.0 g mDixon broth was prepared in a 125 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 0.05% or 0.5% of the metal ion to be tested in combination with ZPT.<br>
3.	20 g of a 500 ppm ZPT solution was prepared in DMSO by adding 0.010 mg ZPT to 19.990 g DMSO.<br>
4.	1.0 g of the 500 ppm ZPT solution was added to the 41g of broth/active from step 2 above giving 42 g in each flask.<br>
5.	42 g mDixon broth was prepared in a 125 ml Erlenmeyer flask (for the negative control)<br>
6.	41 g mDixon broth + 1 g ZPT solution was prepared in a 125 ml Erlenmeyer flask (for the ZPT control)<br>
7.	From the log phase culture, 8.0 g M. furfur inoculum was added to each flask, bringing the weight of the broth/inoculum/actives to 50.0 g.<br>
8.	0 hour time point samplings were performed according to the following methodology:<br><br>
a)	Withdraw 1.1 ml broth from flasks.<br>
b)	Spread 0.1 ml across surface of mDixon agar plate.<br>
c)	Perform 10-1, 10-2, 10-3, 10-4 and 10-5 dilutions of the sample and spread 0.1 ml of these across separate mDixon agar plates. (For the 0 and 4 hour time points, only plate out 10-3, 10-4 and 10-5 dilutions)<br>
d)	Invert and incul ite plates 5-7 days at 30C.<br>
e)	Determine viability by counting colonies and converting to CFU/ml.<br>
9. For Mg2+, Ag*. Mn 2+, Bi3+, and Na+ Step 8 was repeated at the 24 and 48 hour time points. For Zn:+ and Cu2+, Step 8 was repeated at the 4, 24, and 48 hour time points.<br><br>
Tables 2(a) and 2(b) show the results of experiments testing the efficacy of metal ion sources in combination with ZPT against the M. furfur microorganism.<br>
As basis for comparison in Tables 2(a) and 2(b), the test results for the tested materials should be lower than the negative control at each particular data point in order to show quick efficacy. The closer to zero the resulting data point is, the quicker the efficacy of the material tested. Therefore, it is clear from the data presented that, for instance, 0.05% of copper sulfate in combination with l0 ppm ZPT works faster and is therefore more efficacious, than either 0.05% of copper sulfate or ZPT alone. The KRT data presented below therefore clearly indicate the potentiation of ZPT by the metal ion source.<br><br><br><br>

All exemplified compositions can be prepared by conventional formulation and mixing [echniques. Component amounts are listed as weight percents and exclude minor materials such is diluents, filler, and so forth. The listed formulations, therefore, comprise the listed :omponents and any minor materials associated with such components. As used herein, 'minors" refers to those optional components such as preservatives, viscosity modifiers, pH nodifiers, fragrances, foam boosters, and the like. As is apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, the selection of these minors will vary depending on the physical and chemical eharacteristics of the particular ingredients selected to make the present invention as described lerein. Other modifications can be undertaken by the skilled artisan without departing from the pint and scope of this invention.

EXAMPLES 3-13<br>
Anti-Microbial Shampoo<br>
A suitable method for preparing the anti-microbial shampoo compositions described in Examples 3-13 (below) follows:<br>
About one-third to all of the ammonium laureth sulfate (added as 25wt% solution) is added to a jacketed mix tank and heated to about 60°C to about 80°C with slow agitation to form a surfactant solution. Cocamide MEA and fatty alcohols, (where applicable), are added to the tank and allowed to disperse.  Salts (e.g. potassium chloride) and pH modifiers (e.g. citric acid, sodium citrate) are added to the tank and allowed to disperse.    Ethylene glycol distearate ("EGDS") is added to the mixing vessel and allowed to melt.   After the EGDS is melted and dispersed, preservarive is added to the surfactant solution.   The resulting mixture is cooled to about 25°C to about 40°C and collected in a finishing tank. As a result of this cooling step, the EGDS crystallizes to form a crystalline network in the product. The remainder of the ammonium laureth sulfate and other components, including the silicone and anti-microbial agent(s), are added to the finishing tank with agitation to ensure a homogeneous mixture. Cationic polymer is dispersed in water as an about 0.1% to about 10% aqueous solution and then added to the final mix.   Once all components have been added, additional viscosity and pH modifiers may be added, as needed, to the mixture to adjust product viscosity and pH to the extent desired.<br><br>

Examples 14-17 Anti-Microbial Styling Shampoo<br>
A suitable method for preparing the anti-microbial styling shampoo compositions described in Examples 14-17 (below) by conventional formulation and mixing techniques follows:<br><br>
The hair styling polymer should first be dissolved in the volatile carrier. The anti¬microbial active is then added to this styling polymer/volatile carrier premix. The styling polymer/volatile carrier/anti-microbial active premix may then be added to a premix of the surfactants, or some portion of the surfactants, and the solid components which has been heated to melt the solid components, e.g., about 87°C. This mixture is then pumped through a high shear mill and cooled, and then the remaining components are mixed in. Alternatively, the styling polymer/volatile carrier/anti-microbial active premix may be added to this final mix, after cooling. The composition should have a final viscosity of from about 2000 to about 12,000 cps. The viscosity of the composition can be adjusted using sodium chloride or ammonium<br>
xylenesulfonate as needed.<br><br>

A suitable method for preparing the anti-microbial hair conditioning compositions described in Examples 18-21 (below) by conventional formulation and mixing techniques follows<br>
When included in the composition, polymeric materials such as polypropylene glycol are dispersed in water at room temperature to make a polymer solution, and heated up to above 70°C. Amidoamine and acid, and when present, other cationic surfactants, ester oil of low melting point oil are added in the solution with agitation. Then high melting point fatty compound, and when present, other low melting point oils and benzyl alcohol are also added in the solution with agitation. The mixture thus obtained is cooled down to below 60°C, and the remaining components such as zinc pyrithione, metal ion source, and silicone compound are added with agitation, and further cooled down to about 30°C.<br>
A triblender and/or mill can be used in each step, if necessary to disperse the materials. Alternatively, up to 50% of the acid can be added after cooling below 60°C.<br>
The embodiments disclosed herein have many advantages. For example, they can provide effective anti-microbial, especially anti-dandruff, efficacy, while not deteriorating conditioning benefits such as wet hair feel, spreadabilify, and rinsability, as well as providing glossiness, and dry combing.<br><br>
