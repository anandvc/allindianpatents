				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process of making jute-glass fibre hybrid sheet moulding compound (SMC) useful for making low cost composite components.<br>
Jute - glass fibre hybrid sheet moulding compound (SMC) may be used to produce composites of various shapes and sizes required for applications in railways, furniture industry, electrical industry and domestic appliances. This type of composite can replace an assembly of many pieces of sheet metals and fibre board with a product offering simpler installation, better performance with low noise and smoother interior and exterior surfaces with better aesthetic appeal without the necessity for painting. It also has additional advantages of being lighter in weight and lower in cost.<br>
In the previous method of producing jute-glass fibre hybrid composite jute cloth, and glass fibre were mixed with polyester resin, catalyst and accelerator by using hand lay up method or by press moulding method without forming sheet moulding compound (SMC), Reference for which may be made to (1) Composite Materials Technology, Manser Publishers, N.Y. p 62, 1990, by P.K.

Monteoro, F. G. Fernandez and M. M. Moraes;   wherein   the strength   of the<br><br>
composite is not at all comparable to conventional glass based SMC composite because<br>
of poor wettability of jute fibre in polyester resin.<br>
The main drawbacks of the above noted hitherto known processes are :<br>
1. Jute fibre in general, require high percentage of polymeric matrices to wet the surfaces due to weak interfacial bonding between the fibre and the polymeric matrices and due to hygroscopic nature of the jute fibres. The alpha cellulose content of jute fibre possesses three hydroxyl groups for each glucose residue and the hemicellulose content of jute fibre possesses two hydroxyl groups for each pentose residence. These hydroxyl groups are the active centres to attract water molecules. Hydrogen bonds are formed between the hydroxyl groups and water molecules. First the direct attachment of water molecules through the active sites (i.e. hydroxyl group) occur and then the indirect attachment through directly attached water molecules take place, Reference for which may be made to "Proc. of the International Symposium on Biocomposites and Blends based on jute and allied fibres", Nov. 30 - Dec. 2, 1994, by Dr. B.C.Mitra.<br>
Hence similar to the application of coupling agent in the form of sizing solution to the glass fibre, attempts have been made by several investigators to block the hydroxyl groups of cellulose and hemicellulose of jute fibre by the application of different chemicals but the surface functionality was not much improved and as such the wettability of jute fibre in polymer matrices was poor. References for which may be made to (a) Ind. J. Text. Res. 7:87, 1982, by M.K.Sridhar et.al, (b) J. Appl. Phys. Sci.,<br>
26:4069,1981 by R.M.V.G.K. Rao et.al (c)  Reinforced Plastics, 8, 306, June, 1964, by<br>
A.R.Philip, (d) Eng. Mater. Des., 8, 475 1965.  In spite of these efforts, however, there has not been any extensive commercial utilisation of jute fiber composites. One of the<br><br>
several reasons for this failure lies in the poor adhesion between resin matrix and jute fiber leading to debonding of the composite on aging.<br>
2. Jute fibre is less efficient than glass fibre in its resin distribution properties. It has a greater flow resistance and tend to be less buoyant in dry state and compressed more readily thereby entrapping small air bubbles in the laminates. Because of these characteristics it is not easily amenable to the common moulding processes like hand lay up moulding. It is also very difficult to impregnate raw jute fibre with polymeric resin as like glass fibre in common sheet moulding manufacturing system until and unless it is properly treated by using polymer solution.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process of making jute-glass fibre hybrid sheet moulding compound (SMC) useful for making low cost composite components which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a composition for making jute-glass fibre hybrid sheet moulding compound (SMC).<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process fof making jute-glass fibre hybrid sheet moulding compound (SMC) useful for making low cost composite components which comprises (i) impregnating jute fibre with a polymer solution by known methods such as wetting, followed by passing through squeeze rollers, drying the polymer coated jute fibre in an oven at a temperature in the range of 50° - 70°C for a time period in the range of 1 - 1.5 hrs., (ii) preparing a slurry by mixing 27 - 35 wt.% polyester resin, such as herein described 1.5-2 gms.

polymer coated jute fibre as obtained at step (i) in between 20 - 25 wt.% glass fibre layers, into the slurry as obtained at step (ii) and squeezing out in between two cellophane papers to obtain a hybrid sheet moulding compound (SMC), rolling the SMC over a mandrel and maturing at a temperature in the range of 10° - 15°C 7 days to get the desired jute - glass fibre hybrid sheet moulding compound.<br>

The novelties and inventive steps of the present invention are :<br>
(1)	Improvement of the wettability property of jute fibre in polyester resin by<br>
using polymer coated jute fibre and thereby increasing the strength of the composite.<br>
(2)	Partial reduction of high cost glass fibre in SMC by incorporating polymer<br>
coated jute fibre and thereby reducing the cost of the composite.<br>
(3)	Improvement of the strength of the SMC composite by partial reduction of<br>
filler in SMC by incorporating polymer coated jute fibre.<br>
Analysis for the achievement    of the strength    properties of the    composite components based on jute-glass fibre hybrid SMC.<br>
Jute is a naturally occuring fibre having a great potential for use in composite materials. Their specific strength and stiffness are quite high, however, hygroscopic nature of jute creates problem in the long term durability of composites made only out of them. Hybridisation with glass fibre provides a viable alternative to overcome this problem.<br>
In the conventional SMC preparation calcium carbonate is basically used as a cheap paniculate filler and these particles are extremely inefficient as reinforcing agent because of their low aspect ratio. In the jute-glass fibre hybrid composite a part of this filler is replaced by jute fibre which can also act as a cheap substitute of filler provides the extra advantage of improving the strength because jute fibre is also act as a reinforcing agent for its high aspect ratio. Jute fibre is thus considered as a filler fibre for the preparation of composite components. This in rum allow the reduction of glass fibre percentage in the conventional SMC and thereby reducing the cost and density of the composite components..<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
1.	Wettability   property of jute fibre in polyester resin   is made easy for<br>
preparing jute- glass fibre hybrid sheet moulding compound ( SMC).<br>
2.	The inclusion of jute fibre as partial replacement of glass fibre in the<br>
preparation of compound reducing (i) the cost of the composite components and (ii)<br>
the weight of the composite components.<br>
3.	The strength properties of jute-glass fibre hybrid SMC based composite<br>
components       can be comparable with the present day high cost only glass<br>
fibre based sheet moulding compound (SMC) based composite components.<br>
4.	Jute fibre can be considered as an extremely effective and economic type filler<br>
fibre_because of its high aspect ratio for the preparation of jute-glass fibre hybrid<br>
sheet moulding     compound (SMC) useful  for making low cost composite<br>
components.<br>
5.	Conventional roller mill machine may be used   for the preparation of jute-<br>
glass fibre hybrid SMC.<br>
6.	By using this jute-glass fibre hybrid SMC various composite components of<br>
different shapes and sizes can be manufactured  for    applications   in    railways,<br>
furniture industry, electrical industry and domestic appliances.<br><br><br><br>
