				<td>SECURED THROTTLE POSITION IN A COORDINATED TORQUE CONTROL<br>
SYSTEM<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to vehicle control systems and<br>
more particularly to electronic throttle control.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] Referring now to FIG. 1, a functional block diagram of a vehicle<br>
100 is presented. The vehicle 100 includes an engine 102, which generates<br>
torque to propel the vehicle 100. Air is drawn into the engine 102 through an<br>
intake manifold 104. A throttle valve 106 controls airflow into the engine 102.<br>
The throttle valve 106 may include a throttle plate 108, which may block all of or<br>
a portion of an opening in the throttle valve 106. An electronic throttle control<br>
(ETC) motor 109 controls the throttle valve 106 and/or the throttle plate 108.<br>
[0003] The air flowing through the throttle valve 106 is mixed with fuel<br>
from one or more fuel injectors 110 to form an air-fuel mixture. The air-fuel<br>
mixture is combusted within one or more cylinders 112 of the engine 102.<br>
Combustion of the air-fuel mixture may be initiated by, for example, a spark<br>
delivered by a spark plug 114. Although the spark plug 114 is depicted, the<br>
engine 102 may include a compression-combustion type engine that does not<br>
include the spark plug 114. The combustion of the air-fuel mixture generates<br>
torque. Resulting exhaust gas is expelled from the cylinders 112 to an exhaust<br>
system 116.<br><br>
delivered by a spark plug 114. Although the spark plug 114 is depicted, the<br>
engine 102 may include a compression-combustion type engine that does not<br>
include the spark plug 114. The combustion of the air-fuel mixture generates<br>
torque. Resulting exhaust gas is expelled from the cylinders 112 to an exhaust<br>
system 116.<br>
[0005] An engine control modle (ECM) 130 modulates torque output<br>
from the engine 102. The ECM 130 may modulate torque by controlling the<br>
airflow through the throttle valve 106, the fuel injected by the fuel injectors 110,<br>
and/or the timing of the spark delivered by the spark plug 114. The ECM 130<br>
may modulate torque based upon, for example, a pedal position signal from a<br>
pedal position sensor 134 and/or signals from other sensors 136. The pedal<br>
position sensor 134 generates the pedal position signal based upon actuation of<br>
an accelerator pedal 138 by a driver. The other sensors 136 may include, for<br>
example mass air flow (MAF) sensor a manifold absolute pressure (MAP)<br>
sensor, an engine speed sensor, a transmission sensor, a cruise control system,<br>
and/or a traction control system.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] A throttle control module comprises a primary throttle position<br>
module, a redundant throttle position module, and a remedial action module.<br>
The primary throttle position module transforms a primary throttle area signal<br>
indication desired throttle area into a primary throttle position signal indicating a<br>
first desired throttle position of a throttalve. The throttle valve is actuated<br>
based upon the primary throttle position signal. The redundant throttle position<br><br>
module transforms a redundant throttle area signal indicating desired throttle<br>
area into a redundant throttle position signal indicating a second desired throttle<br>
position of the throttle valve. The remedial action module selectively generates a<br>
remedial action signal based upon a comparison of the first and second desired<br>
throttle positions.<br>
[0007] A throttle control system comprises the throttle control module<br>
and a throttle actuation module. The rottle actuation module controls an<br>
electronic throttle control (ETC) motor that actuates the throttle valve. The<br>
throttle actuation module instructs the ETC motor to actuate the throttle valve to a<br>
predetermined throttle position after receiving the remedial action signal. In<br>
further features, the predetermined throttle position is a high-idle position.<br>
[0008] In other features, the throttle actuation module instructs the ETC<br>
motor to actuate the throttle valve to a lesser throttle position after receiving the<br>
remedial action signal. The lesser throttle position is one of the first and second<br>
desireo hottle positions that corresponed to a lesser opening of the throttle<br>
valve.<br>
[0009] In further features, the throttle actuation module compares the<br>
first desired throttle position with an actual throttle position from a throttle position<br>
sensor and instructs the ETC motor to actuate the throttle valve to reach the first<br>
desired throttle position based upon the comparison.<br>
[0010] In still further features, the throttle control module further<br>
comprises nonvolatile memory that includes data for converting throttle area to<br>
throughttion. The primary and redungant throttle position modules determine<br><br>
the first and second desired throttle positions, respectively, based upon the data.<br>
The data comprises a first lookup table and a second lookup table. The first<br>
lookup table has a mapping from throttle area to segment value. The second<br>
lookup table has a mapping from segment value to throttle position.<br>
[0011] In still further features, the remedial action module suspends<br>
generating the remedial action signal when a service input signal is received.<br>
The rental action module generates the remedial action signal when the first<br>
and second desired throttle positions differ by more than a predetermined<br>
percentage. The predetermined percentage corresponds to a maximum<br>
allowable calculation imprecision.<br>
[0012] A method comprises transforming a primary throttle area signal<br>
indicating desired throttle area into a primary throttle position signal indicating a<br>
first desired throttle position of a throttle valve, actuating the throttle valve based<br>
upon the primary throttle position signal, transforming a redundant throttle area<br>
signal dicating desired throttle area into a redundant throttle position signal<br>
indicating a second desired throttle position of the throttle valve, and selectively<br>
generating a remedial action signal based upon a comparison of the first and<br>
second desired throttle positions.<br>
[0013] In further features, the method further comprises actuating the<br>
throttle valve to a predetermined throttle position after receiving the remedial<br>
action signal. The predetermined throttle position is a high-idle position. The<br>
method further comprises actuating the throttle valve to a lesser throttle position<br>
after receiving the remedial action signal. The lesser throttle position is one of<br><br>
the first and second desired throttle positions that corresponds to a lesser<br>
opening of the throttle valve.<br>
[0014] In other features, the method further comprises comparing the<br>
first desired throttle position with an actual throttle position from a throttle position<br>
sensor and actuating the throttle valve to reach the first desired throttle position<br>
based upon the comparison. The method further comprises determining the first<br>
and second throttle positions based upon data for converting throttle area to<br>
throttion.<br>
[0015] In still other features, the method further comprises determining<br>
the first and second throttle positions based upon a first lookup table and a<br>
second lookup table. The first lookup table has a mapping from throttle area to<br>
segment value. The second lookup table has a mapping from segment value to<br>
throttle position.<br>
[0016] The method further comprises suspending generating the<br>
remedial action signal when a service input signal is received. The method<br>
further imprises generating the remedial action signal when the first and<br>
second desired throttle positions differ by more than a predetermined<br>
percentage.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0024] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is in<br>
no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For purposes of<br>
clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify<br>
similar elements. As used herein, the phrase at least one of A, B, and C should<br>
be construed to mean a logical (A or B or C), using a non-exclusive logical or. It<br>
should be understood that steps within a method may be executed in different<br>
order without altering the principles of the present disclosure.<br><br>
[0025] As used herein, the term module refers to an Application<br>
Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared,<br>
dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware<br>
programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that<br>
provide the described functionality.<br>
[0026] Referring now to FIG. 2, a functional block diagram of an<br>
exemplary vehicle 200 is presented. The vehicle 200 includes the engine 102,<br>
which generates torque to propel the vehicle 200. An engine control module<br>
(ECM) 230 modulates torque output from the engine 102. The ECM 230 may<br>
modulate torque by controlling the airflow through the throttle valve 106, the fuel<br>
injected by the fuel injectors 110, and/or the timing of the spark delivered by the<br>
spark plug 114.<br>
[0027] The ECM 230 includes a torque request module 232, a fuel<br>
actuation module 246, a spark actuation module 248, a primary throttle area<br>
module 250, and a redundant throttle area module 252. The torque request<br>
module 232 generates a torque request based upon, for example, the pedal<br>
position signal from the pedal position sensor 134 and/or signals from the other<br>
sensor 106. The torque request module 232 may also generate the torque<br>
request based upon data stored in memory, such as nonvolatile memory 240 and<br>
volatile memory 242. For example only, the nonvolatile memory 240 may be<br>
read-only memory (ROM), flash memory, electrically erasable programmable<br>
read-only memory (EEPROM), erasable programmable read-only memory<br>
(EPROM) or any other suitable type of nonvolatile memory.<br><br>
[0028] Based on the torque request, the torque request module 232<br>
transmitter control signals to the fuel actuation module 246, the spark actuation<br>
module 248, and the primary throttle area module 250. The control signal for the<br>
primary throttle area module 250 is also provided to the redundant throttle area<br>
module 252. The fuel actuation module 246 controls the volume of fuel injected<br>
by the fuel injectors 110. The spark actuation module 248 controls the timing of<br>
spark delivery of the spark plug 114.<br>
[0029] The primary throttle area module 250 generates a primary<br>
throttle area signal based upon the control signal from the torque request module<br>
232. The primary throttle area signal may also be based upon data stored in<br>
memory, such as the nonvolatile memory 240 and the volatile memory 242. The<br>
primary throttle area signal indicates the desired throttle area of the throttle valve<br>
106. The desired throttle area may be, for example, a desired percentage of the<br>
throttle valve opening that is unblocked by the throttle plate 108 or a desired<br>
physical area of the throttle valve opening.<br>
[0030] Independent of the primary throttle area signal, the redundant<br>
throttle area module 252 generates a redundant throttle area signal, which also<br>
indicates the desired throttle area of the throttle valve 106. The redundant<br>
throttle area module 252 generates the redundant throttle area signal based<br>
upon the control signal from the torque request module 232. The redundant<br>
throttle area module 252 may also generate the redundant throttle area signal<br>
based upon data stored in the nonvolatile memory 240 and the volatile memory<br>
242.<br><br>
[0031] The throttle area of the throttle valve 106 may be controlled by<br>
the position of the throttle plate 108, which is referred to as throttle position. In<br>
various implementations, the throttle position represents an angular position of<br>
the throttle plate 108 on a rotational axis perpendicular to the direction of airflow<br>
through the throttle valve 106. For example only, a throttle area opening<br>
percentage of 50% may correspond to a throttle position of 30°.<br>
[0032] A throttle control module 254 receives the primary throttle area<br>
signal and the redundant throttle area signal. Although the throttle control<br>
module 254 and other modules are depicted within the ECM 230, one or more<br>
may be implemented separately from the ECM 230. The throttle control module<br>
254 transmits a throttle position signal to a throttle actuation module 256. The<br>
throttle actuation module 256 drives the ETC motor 109 to actuate the throttle<br>
plate 108 to the position indicated by the throttle position signal.<br>
[0033] The throttle control module 254 generates a primary throttle<br>
position signal based upon the primary throttle area signal and a redundant<br>
throttle position signal based upon the redundant throttle area signal. The<br>
primary and redundant throttle position signals indicate desired throttle position.<br>
If the primary and redundant throttle position signals differ, the throttle control<br>
module 254 may take remedial action.<br>
[0034] To take remedial action, the throttle control module 254 may<br>
transmit a remedial action signal to the throttle actuation module 256. When the<br>
throttle actuation module 256 receives the remedial action signal, the throttle<br>
actuation module 256 may, for example, instruct the ETC motor 109 to actuate<br><br>
the throttle plate 108 to a predetermined throttle position. The predetermined<br>
throttle position may be a high-idle position. Alternatively, the throttle actuation<br>
module 256 may instruct the ETC motor 109 to actuate the throttle plate 108 to<br>
the throttle position corresponding to the lesser of the primary and redundant<br>
throttle position signals. In this manner, the throttle control module 254 prevents<br>
an unexpected increase in torque in the event that one of the primary or<br>
redundant throttle position signals is corrupt.<br>
[0035] The throttle actuation module 256 may include an actuation<br>
diagnostic, which compares the desired throttle position with an actual throttle<br>
position. The actual throttle position may be measured by one or more throttle<br>
position sensors 260. If the desired throttle position differs from the actual<br>
throttle position, the throttle actuation module 256 may attempt to control the<br>
ETC motor 109 to reach the desired throttle position. The throttle actuation<br>
module 256 may also signal an error and/or instruct the ETC motor 109 to<br>
actuate the throttle plate 108 to the high-idle throttle position.<br>
[0036] A service input signal may be transmitted to the primary throttle<br>
area module 250 and the throttle control module 254 by, for example, a service<br>
technician or a calibrator. The service input signal may instruct the primary<br>
throttle area module 250 to generate the primary throttle area signal based upon<br>
the service input signal. The primary throttle area signal will likely then differ<br>
from the redundant throttle area signal, which may cause the throttle control<br>
module 254 to incorrectly take remedial action. Accordingly, the throttle control<br><br>
module 254 may refrain from taking remedial action when the service input signal<br>
is received.<br>
[0037] Referring now to FIG. 3A, a functional block diagram of an<br>
exemplary implementation of the throttle control module 254 is presented. The<br>
throttle control module 254 includes a primary throttle position module 302 and a<br>
redundant throttle position module 304, which receive the primary throttle area<br>
signal and the redundant throttle area signal, respectively.<br>
[0038] The primary throttle position module 302 generates a primary<br>
throttle position signal based upon the primary throttle area signal. The<br>
redundant throttle position module 304 generates a redundant throttle position<br>
signal based upon the redundant throttle area signal. The primary throttle<br>
position signal and the redundant throttle position signal each indicate a desired<br>
throttle position.<br>
[0039] The desired throttle positions may be determined using throttle<br>
area to throttle position data stored in nonvolatile memory 306. The nonvolatile<br>
memory 306 may be implemented in the nonvolatile memory 240 of FIG. 2. and<br>
may include, for example, a diagnostic or an error correcting code (ECC) to<br>
ensure data integrity. For example only, the nonvolatile memory 306 may be<br>
may be read-only memory (ROM), flash memory, electrically erasable<br>
programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), erasable programmable read-only<br>
memory (EPROM) or any other suitable type of nonvolatile memory.<br>
[0040] The nonvolatile memory 306 may include one or more lookup<br>
tables from which a desired throttle position (e.g., in degrees of throttle plate<br><br>
rotation) may be determined from a desired throttle area (e.g., in percentage of<br>
unrestricted throttle valve area). Referring to FIG. 3B, an exemplary tabular<br>
illustration of lookup tables used to convert a desired throttle area percentage<br>
into a desired throttle position is presented. Numerical values and calculations in<br>
FIG. 3B are provided for exemplary purposes only, and the lookup tables may<br>
include any suitable values.<br>
[0041] In various implementations, the range of possible throttle areas<br>
(e.g., 0-100%) may be divided into a predetermined number of segments, such<br>
as 33 segments. These segments may be equally or unequally sized. When the<br>
range of possible throttle areas is divided into 33 equally sized segments, each<br>
segment includes approximately 3.3% of the range of throttle areas (i.e., 100% /<br>
33 segments).<br>
[0042] A first lookup table 308 may define each segment in terms of<br>
the maximum throttle area within the segment. A segment value for a desired<br>
throttle area may be determined based upon the first lookup table 308. The<br>
segment value may include an integer part (IP) and a fractional part (FP), and<br>
may be represented as IP.FP. The first lookup table 308 may be used to<br>
determine in which segment the desired throttle area is located, IP, and where<br>
within segment IP the desired throttle area is located, FP. In various<br>
implementations, FP may not be determined.<br>
[0043] The desired throttle area may fall between a first and a second<br>
maximum throttle area MTA1 and MTA2. respectfully. MTA1 and MTA2<br>
correspond to upper and lower segments IP and IP-1, respectively. For example<br><br>
only, the FP may be calculated through interpolation, such as linear interpolation,<br>
using the equation:<br><br>
where MTA1 is the maximum throttle area corresponding to IP, and MTA2 is the<br>
maximum throttle area corresponding to IP-1.<br>
[0044] For purposes of illustration and example only, in FIG. 3B, a<br>
desired throttle area percentage of 8% falls between maximum throttle area<br>
percentages of 10% and 4%, which are MTA1 and MTA2, respectively. MTA1 and<br>
MTA2 correspond to segment 2 (i.e. IP) and segment 1 (i.e., IP-1), respectively.<br>
Using the equation above and the exemplary values provided, FP can be<br>
determined and is 0.66 in FIG. 3B.<br>
[0045] A second lookup table 310 is used to determine the desired<br>
throttle position that corresponds to the segment value IP.FP. The second<br>
lookup table 310 includes a mapping of segment to throttle position. IP and an<br>
upper segment IP+1 correspond to lower and upper throttle positions TP1 and<br>
TP2, respectively. For example only, the desired throttle position that<br>
corresponds to the desired throttle area may be calculated through interpolation,<br>
such as linear interpolation, using FP and the equation:<br>
Desired Throttle Position =TP1 +FP*(TP2 -TP1)<br>
where TP1 is the throttle position corresponding to IP, TP2 is the throttle position<br>
corresponding to IP+1, and FP is the fractional part of the segment value.<br><br>
[0046] For purposes of illustration and example only, in FIG. 3B, the<br>
segment value 2.66 (from above) corresponds to IP (segment 2). IP and IP+1<br>
(segment 3) correspond to throttle positions of 7° and 13°, respectively. Using<br>
the above equation and the exemplary values provided, the desired throttle<br>
position can be determined and is 11° in FIG. 3B. Accordingly, using the<br>
exemplary values provided, a desired throttle area percentage of 8% may<br>
correspond to a desired throttle position of 11°.<br>
[0047] Referring back to FIG. 3A, the desired throttle positions may be<br>
expressed as voltages within a voltage range. A lower limit of the voltage range<br>
may be learned upon starting the engine 102. For example only, the lower limit<br>
may be learned based upon a minimum throttle position measured by the throttle<br>
position sensor 260. An upper limit of the voltage range may be calibratable.<br>
For example only, the upper limit may be set to correspond to the greatest<br>
allowable throttle position.<br>
[0048] The primary throttle position module 302 transmits the primary<br>
throttle position signal to the throttle actuation module 256 and may transmit the<br>
primary throttle position signal to the throttle actuation diagnostic. A remedial<br>
action module 312 determines whether to take remedial action based upon a<br>
comparison of the primary and redundant throttle position signals and generates<br>
the remedial action signal accordingly.<br>
[0049] The remedial action module 312 may take remedial action<br>
when, for example, the desired throttle positions differ by more than a<br>
predetermined percentage. The predetermined percentage may allow for<br><br>
rounding errors, and may be, for example, 0.06%. Alternatively, taking remedial<br>
action may be limited to times when the desired throttle position of the primary<br>
throttle position signal is larger than that of the redundant throttle position signal<br>
by more than the predetermined percentage.<br>
[0050] The remedial action module 312 may also receive the service<br>
input signal. The remedial action module 312 may further limit taking remedial<br>
action to times when the service input signal is not received. This may prevent<br>
the incorrect taking of remedial action when the primary throttle area signal is<br>
being generated based upon the service input signal.<br>
[0051] The throttle actuation module 256 may, for example, instruct the<br>
ETC motor 109 to actuate the throttle plate 108 to the predetermined throttle<br>
position when the remedial action signal is received. In this manner, the throttle<br>
control module 254 prevents an unexpected increase in torque in the event that<br>
one of the primary or redundant throttle position signals is corrupt. The remedial<br>
action signal may also be transmitted to other components of the ECM 230 for<br>
diagnostic purposes. For example only, the ECM 230 may illuminate a "check<br>
engine" light and/or set an error code after receiving the remedial action signal.<br>
[0052] Referring now to FIG. 4, a flowchart depicting exemplary steps<br>
performed by the throttle control module 254 is presented. Control begins in step<br>
404, where control receives the primary throttle area signal and the redundant<br>
throttle area signal. The primary throttle area signal and the redundant throttle<br>
area signal each indicate the desired throttle area.<br><br>
[0053] Control continues in step 408, where control determines the<br>
primary throttle position and generates the primary throttle position signal<br>
accordingly. Control continues in step 412, where control determines the<br>
redundant throttle position and generates the redundant throttle position signal<br>
accordingly. Control may, for example, convert the desired throttle areas of the<br>
primary and redundant throttle area signals to the desired throttle positrons using<br>
the lookup tables of the nonvolatile memory 306.<br>
[0054] Control continues in step 416, where control instructs the ETC<br>
motor 109 to actuate the throttle plate 108 to the throttle position indicated by the<br>
primary throttle position signal. In step 420, control determines whether the<br>
throttle positions indicated by the primary and redundant throttle position signals<br>
differ by more than the predetermined percentage. If so, control transfers to step<br>
424; otherwise, control returns to step 404. In step 424, control takes remedial<br>
action. For example only, control may take remedial action by instructing the<br>
ETC motor 109 to actuate the throttle plate 108 to a predetermined throttle<br>
position, such as the high-idle position. Control then returns to step 404.<br>
[0055] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the disclosure can be implemented in a<br>
variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure includes particular examples,<br>
the true scope of the disclosure should not be so limited since other modifications<br>
will become apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, the<br>
specification and the following claims.<br><br>
