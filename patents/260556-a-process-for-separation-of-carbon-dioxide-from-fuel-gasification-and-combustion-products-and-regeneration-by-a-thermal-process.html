				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process of separation of carbon dioxide from<br>
fuel gas and combustion products using ammonia absorption and subsequent<br>
regeneration by a thermal process to prevent the harmful emission of carbon<br>
dioxide green house gas adaptable to power plants, steel plants, fertilizer plants,<br>
refineries, waste disposal plants and other industries.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND PRIOR ARTS<br>
The greenhouse gas carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has reached an alarming<br>
level to cause a global warming and climate damage. Burning of the fossil fuels<br>
like coal, oil and the natural gas for transportation, an electric power generation,<br>
the production of steel, cement, fertilizer and the chemicals emit carbon dioxide<br>
to the atmosphere which acts like a blanket warming up the earth and referred<br>
as a global warming. This can lead to a major environmental catastrophe on the<br>
earth in the coming decades. Hence, there is a necessity to invent new<br>
technology to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions into atmosphere.<br><br>
The fossil fuel fired in electric power generation is one of the major sources of<br>
carbon dioxide emissions from thermal power plants. In these power plants the<br>
chemical pollutants like SOx, NOx, in ppm levels are removed by the pollution<br>
control devices and the stack gases emitted to the atmosphere are nitrogen,<br>
water vapour and harmful carbon dioxide.<br>
The present global warming crisis calls for a separation of carbon dioxide from<br>
nitrogen in the flue gas by a suitable method as described in the present art, so<br>
that carbon dioxide captured can be transported and sequestrated in empty oil<br>
and gas wells under earth or in the ocean, instead of direct emission to the<br>
atmosphere. Presently these options are being studied, as nature is already using<br>
the natural reservoirs as the main carbon dioxide sink.<br>
The separation of carbon dioxide from other gases like nitrogen is an important<br>
step in the carbon capture for sequestration. Amine absorption process is a well<br>
known method used in fertilizer and refinery industries for separation of the<br>
carbon dioxide from other gases in the production of hydrogen but is too costly<br>
and a high energy process to adopt for capturing a large amount of carbon<br>
dioxide emitted from the thermal power plants at an uneconomical decrease in<br>
efficiency of 11-13%. Further the amines are costly and it degrades with limited<br>
life. The technologies are being developed to use oxygen directly for combustion<br>
or the gasification with fossil fuels instead of air, which emit only carbon dioxide<br><br>
without nitrogen and can be directly captured and sequestrated. But oxygen<br>
separation from air, using liquefaction technologies is a capital intensive and<br>
costing about 15 to 20% of capital cost of power plant and further this method<br>
would be applicable to new green field contents only and cannot be retrofitted in<br>
existing power plants which use air for combustion. Development of membranes<br>
for carbon dioxide separation is at an infant stage and is not providing an<br>
immediate solution.<br>
Recently the proposed methods are based on the absorption reaction of carbon<br>
dioxide with oxides and hydroxides of sodium, potassium, lithium, magnesium ,<br>
calcium to form carbonates and subsequently decompose at high temperature<br>
for evolving pure carbon dioxide for sequestration. USP 2007217981 and USP<br>
2005180910 describe an art of capturing carbon dioxide from flue gas effluent of<br>
a power plant to form magnesium carbonate from the base solution and the<br>
carbonate is subsequently heated for CO2 recovery. USP 2007261947 describes a<br>
process of sequestration of carbon dioxide by mineral carbonation using<br>
magnesium or calcium silicate hydroxide minerals to form the corresponding<br>
carbonates. Though the mineral silicate hydroxides are cheaper, the<br>
corresponding carbonates have to be decomposed at a high temperature above<br>
900 deg.C consuming high energy for the regeneration of carbon dioxide,<br>
decreasing the overall efficiency of power generation and these methods are not<br>
presently economical. USP 7132090 describes a method for conversion of carbon<br><br>
dioxide to mineral carbonates and store the same in the ground without<br>
regeneration. Such a method is not applicable for large scale power plants<br>
emitting large quantity of carbon dioxide requiring a huge land areas for storing<br>
the mineral carbonates.<br>
An USP 6667022 describes a method and apparatus for removing C02 using<br>
two fluidized beds for producing hydrogen from one bed and C02 from another<br>
bed by capturing C02 with calcium oxide forming CaC03. Since CaC03<br>
decomposes at 970 deg.C the reaction heat has to be supplied from combustion<br>
bringing down the overall efficiency.<br>
The aim of present invention is to use ammonia for absorption of carbon dioxide<br>
and the regeneration of carbon dioxide at low temperature using waste heat, as<br>
a simple and economically cheap process to separate carbon dioxide present in<br>
fuel syn gas or flue gas, from other gases like nitrogen. The process of this<br>
invention has been tested in bench scale. Such a method can be quickly adopted<br>
in the existing and newer thermal power plants at an affordable cost. Such a<br>
method can also be adopted in steel plants, fertilizer plants, refineries, waste<br>
disposal plants and other industries which emit carbon dioxide.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to propose a process of<br>
separation of carbon dioxide from fuel gas and combustion product using<br>
ammonia absorption and subsequent regeneration by a thermal process which<br>
eliminates the disadvantages of the existing state of art.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a process of separation of<br>
carbon dioxide from fuel gas and combustion product using ammonia absorption<br>
and subsequent regeneration by a thermal process which ensures the complete<br>
removal of CO2by ammonia absorption and subsequent regeneration by a<br>
thermal process.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to propose a process of separation of<br>
carbon dioxide from fuel gas and combustion product using ammonia absorption<br>
and subsequent regeneration by a thermal process which ensures removal of<br>
other acid gases also.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to propose a process of<br>
separation of carbon dioxide from fuel gas and combustion product using<br>
ammonia absorption and subsequent regeneration by a thermal process which<br>
makes a pollution free atmosphere.<br><br>
An yet further object of the present invention is to propose a process of<br>

prevents a global warming.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process of separation carbon dioxide present<br>
in a mixture of gases primarily nitrogen, present in fuel syn gas or flue gas<br>
combustion products arising out of fossil fuel conversion in thermal power plants,<br>
fertilizer plants, steel plants and other chemical plants, using absorption with<br>
ammonia solution wherein the carbon dioxide forms ammonium carbonate in<br>
solution; such a solution on heating evolves carbon dioxide at a temperature low<br>

removal of carbon dioxide from air blown gasification process can contribute to<br>
increase in calorific value for better combustion in gas turbines.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Fig.l - shows a process flow-diagram for separation of CO2from fue gas<br>
according to the invention<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
The integrated process system for carbon dioxide separation proposed in the<br>
present art is shown in Figure-1. The incoming fuel gas or flue gas having carbon<br>
dioxide is cooled in a heat exchanger (1) by exchanging the heat with<br>
ammonium carbonate solution from the absorber. The fuel gas or flue gas is<br>
further cooled in a gas cooling scrubber (2) with water to increase ammonia<br>
absorption efficiency. The gas is scrubbed with ammonia solution in the CO2<br>
absorber (3) to form ammonium carbonate solution. The traces of ammonia<br>
carried over by the gas is washed away by scrubbing with water in ammonia<br>
wash scrubber (4) to form ammonia solution and the CO2free flue gas leaves the<br>
stack or CO2free fuel gas is used in the process further. In the regeneration<br>
cycle of the process, the ammonium carbonate solution from the absorber (3) is<br>
partially heated in the heat exchanger (1) with heat from inlet fuel gas or flue<br>
gas and then heated to regeneration temperature using steam from reboiler<br>
(5).The evaporated ammonia and CO2in vapor phase from the evaporator (6) is<br><br>
passed to ammonia recovery scrubber (7) where scrubbing with water dissolves<br>
ammonia alone and the separated carbon dioxide gas can be sent for<br>
sequestration or for other applications. The recovered ammonia solution from<br>
the reactors (7) and (4) are recirculated to the absorber (3) again, with the<br>
required makeup solution.The details of the process is further discussed under<br>
the following description.<br>
The carbon dioxide separation process described in this art is based on the<br>
bench scale tests conducted on absorption reaction between carbon dioxide and<br>
ammonia solution. The ammonia dissolved in water forms ammonium hydroxide<br>
solution which is alkaline in nature with a pH 13-14. When carbon dioxide gas is<br>
passed though ammonium hydroxide solution, carbon dioxide is absorbed in a<br>
mild exothermic reaction, to form concentrated ammonium carbonate solution.<br>
In the absorption process the alkalinity of ammonia solution decreases with the<br>
associated decrease of pH and this pH change is used to control the process<br>
effectively. The absorption of carbon dioxide decreases with the increase in<br>
temperature of ammonium carbonate solution and above 60°C, the ammonium<br>
carbonate solution decomposes to release carbon dioxide back.<br>
In the present invention, the absorption reaction of carbon dioxide by ammonia<br>
solution to form ammonium carbonate and regeneration of carbon dioxide on<br>
heating, is used in the carbon dioxide separation of CO2from other gases like<br><br>
nitrogen to obtain a steady stream of carbon dioxide which can be sequestrated.<br>
The ammonium hydroxide rich solution after removal of carbon dioxide is<br>
recirculated back for absorption. Alternatively a crystalline ammonium<br>
bicarbonate solid compound can be separated from ammonium carbonate<br>
solution at suitable pH and this can be used as a potential soil nutrient fertilizer<br>
providing both carbon and nitrogen to earth for plant growth.<br>
In this art, a gas mixture of CO2and other gases like nitrogen, CO2varying<br>
up to 15 % corresponding to the amount of CO2present in the gasification and<br>
combustion products of fossil fuels, is passed through the inlet at the bottom of<br>
the absorption reactor (3) and ammonia solution of suitable concentration is<br>
sprayed through nozzles from top of the reactor in counter current to the flow<br>
of gas. After absorption of CO2by ammonia solution, the remaining nitrogen gas<br>
exits from top of the reactor and CO2absorbed ammonium carbonate solution<br>
leaves bottom of the reactor through a separate exit port. The concentration of<br>
ammonia solution is varied up to 25 % by weight of ammonia in water solution,<br>
depending on the concentration of CO2and quantity of gas. Ammonia solution<br>
of 28 % concentration and above is classified as hazardous chemical and<br>
equipment and system design would require extra features with higher margin<br>
of safety and cost. Hence the ammonia solution used in this art is kept below<br>
28% concentration. The gas and solution in counter current flow, promote<br>
good liquid to gas contact for absorption of carbon dioxide. The solution is<br><br>
sprayed through non clogging nozzles made of stainless steel having resistance<br>
to ammonia corrosion. The spray nozzle provides fine droplets to promote large<br>
surface area of liquid film for coming into contact with carbon dioxide gas for<br>
efficient absorption. In larger equipment, plurality of such spray nozzles is to be<br>
arranged in different tires within the reactor depending on the relative quantities<br>
of ammonia solution and gas. Spray nozzle absorption is preferred over packed<br>
bed absorption as the ammonium bicarbonate solid crystals formed can deposit<br>
and choke the packed bed, increase the pressure drop and hinder the process.<br>
The absorption process depends on the temperature of the reactant solution and<br>
gas and lowering the temperature promotes better absorption. It is found that<br>
carbon dioxide can be absorbed over a range of temperatures from 5 deg.C to<br>
60 deg.C. Even at room temperature, the ammonia is partly in vapor phase and<br>
so at higher temperatures the quantity of ammonia in liquid phase decreases<br>
with a decrease In CO2absorption capacity. The evolved carbon dioxide gas<br>
carries some ammonia with it which is washed away in the following ammonia<br>
wash reactor (4) with a spray of water or lean ammonium carbonate solution,<br>
the reactor having a configuration similar to the absorption reactor(3) and the<br>
extent of washing is monitored by pH of the solution. The gas coming out of this<br>
reactor(4) Is Nitrogen, free of carbon dioxide and can be emitted safely .<br>
If the gas quantity is very large, several absorbers in parallel can be used. If<br>
carbon dioxide is not fully absorbed in one stage within the practically designed<br><br>
height of the reactor, more stages in series can be used to bring down carbon<br>
dioxide to the required levels. In the bench scale tests one absorber of one<br>
meter height brought down the CO2level from around 13 % at the inlet to 2 %<br>
at the outlet and two such absorbers brought down the CO2to 0.2 to 0.4 % at<br>
the outlet of the second absorber, constituting separation of more than 98 %<br>
carbon dioxide.<br>
The carbon dioxide absorbed in ammonia solution forms ammonium carbonate<br>
liquid and the pH decreases. Typically Ammonium hydroxide solution of pH 13 to<br>
14 decreases to 8 to 9 when saturation happens with the formation of<br>
ammonium bicarbonate crystals. The ammonium bicarbonate crystals have<br>
been separated and confirmed by x-ray diffraction analysis. In large scale power<br>
plants it is possible to adopt the method described in this art to convert harmful<br>
carbon dioxide emission into a useful fertilizer product.<br>
Alternatively the ammonium carbonate solution formed after absorption is<br>
decomposed using waste heat in the plant to evolve ammonia and carbon<br>
dioxide in gas phase. The ammonia is washed away by spraying water in a<br>
scrubber reactor (7) and recirculated back to the absorption reactor for carbon<br>
dioxide absorption. The left out carbon dioxide gas can be used in sequestration<br>
or other applications. In this art the bench scale tests revealed that ammonium<br>
carbonate solution evolves ammonia and carbon dioxide in the range of 60°C to<br><br>
100°C and nearly 100 % carbon dioxide is regenerated back in the most<br>
optimum temperature range of 70- 95°C at near atmospheric pressure. The heat<br>
energy for regeneration of carbon dioxide can be derived from the flue gas waste<br>
heat energy which is discharged at around 140°C in the stack of present power<br>
plants. In this art, it is proposed as one of the major advantages of ammonia<br>
absorption and regeneration process to use the large quantity of low<br>
temperature waste heat for regenerating carbon dioxide, as this low temperature<br>
heat cannot be recovered easily and efficiently by other methods and is usually<br>
carried by flue gas causing thermal pollution apart from CO2greenhouse<br>
pollution.<br>
In the present thermal power plants, the fuels like coal, oil, natural gas, blast<br>
furnace gas, coke oven gas or any other natural or synthetic fuel containing<br>
carbon or hydrocarbons are used for combustion with air or oxygen to form<br>
combustion products having carbon dioxide and the associated heat energy is<br>
exchanged with steam and converted to electricity in a turbo-generator . The<br>
resulting flue gas combustion products are nitrogen, water vapor and carbon<br>
dioxide with small amounts of polluting oxides of sulphur. Nitrogen, chlorine,<br>
etc originating from the fuel itself. The oxides of sulphur SOx and nitrogen NOx<br>
are acid gases. In the present thermal power plants, the acid gases are<br>
removed in separate pollution control devices like Flue gas desulphurlzation unit<br>
(FGD) for removing sulphur oxides and selective catalytic reduction unit (SCR)<br><br>
for removing nitrogen oxides. The left out major gases are nitrogen, water vapor<br>
which is harmless and carbon dioxide which is a harmful greenhouse gas are<br>
emitted to the atmosphere. Ammonia solution being alkaline, the present art of<br>
removal of carbon dioxide using ammonia absorption process can additionally<br>
remove other acid gases like SOx and NOx also without separate pollution<br>
control devices like FGD and SCR. It is proposed as an additional feature of the<br>
invention that adoption of ammonia absorption and regeneration process<br>
described in the present art, with thermal power plants can thus lead to removal<br>
of carbon dioxide and other acid gases together, with lower capital cost and ultra<br>
low emissions.<br>
In the advanced combined cycle power plants involving gasification of fossil<br>
fuels, the fuel syn gas formed has carbon monoxide, hydrogen, carbon dioxide,<br>
nitrogen and small amounts of corrosive acid gases like Hydrogen sulphide, HCl,<br>
HCN, originating from Sulphur, Nitrogen and Chlorine present in coal in the<br>
reducing atmosphere. The acid gases being corrosive, affect the life of turbines,<br>
fuel cells and other downstream components and their removal is necessary.<br>
Ammonia being alkaline can absorb and remove these acid gases apart from<br>
carbon dioxide in gasification process also and thereby eliminate the necessity of<br>
introducing separate impurity removal or pollution control devices for each of the<br>
acid gas components.<br><br>
Further air blown fluidized bed gasification process is more suitable for high ash<br>
sub bituminous coals and high moisture lignite coals. The air blown gasification<br>
of these fuels produce syn gas having carbon monoxide, hydrogen, carbon<br>
dioxide, nitrogen and acid gases with lower calorific value due to dilution effect<br>
of large quantities of nitrogen originating from air used for gasification. In this<br>
invention it was found during tests that carbon dioxide present in syn gas to the<br>
tune of 12% can be removed to less than 1% using ammonia solution absorption<br>
process. The removal of carbon dioxide can lead to improvement of calorific<br>
value facilitating better combustion in gas turbines. In producer gas also it was<br>
found during tests that removal of CO2from 6% to less than 0.4 % is possible<br>
using ammonia absorption process. Therefore the present art can be used for<br>
separation of carbon dioxide from a mixture of gases in any fuel gas like syn gas,<br>
blast furnace gas, coke oven gas etc., or flue gas combustion products of fossil<br>
fuels and send carbon dioxide for sequestration or other applications.<br><br>
