				<td>POWER PROCESSING SYSTEMS AND METHODS<br>
FOR USE IN PLUG-IN ELECTRIC VEHICLES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	Embodiments of systems and methods relate to power<br>
processing systems and methods for their use in plug-in electric vehicles (e.g.,<br>
fully electric and hybrid electric vehicles).<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]	A traditional plug-in electric vehicle (e.g., a fully electric or<br>
hybrid electric vehicle) uses an on-board or off-board battery charger to<br>
recharge the vehicle's battery from a utility alternating current (AC) outlet.<br>
When the vehicle is not being driven (e.g., when the vehicle is parked at home<br>
for the night), the vehicle's operator may connect the vehicle to an outlet via<br>
the battery charger. The battery charger is a may then draw current from the<br>
utility in order to recharge the battery.<br>
[0003]	Traditional battery chargers have several implications with<br>
respect to a vehicle's physical, manufacturing, and/or operational<br>
characteristics. For example, inclusion of an on-board battery charger in a<br>
plug-in electric vehicle adds to the overall weight of the vehicle, thus<br>
decreasing the vehicle's driving range for a given battery charge. In addition,<br>
as an additional component, a battery charger consumes physical space and<br>
adds to the vehicle's manufacturing cost.<br>
[0004]	Traditional battery chargers also may indiscriminately draw<br>
power from an electric utility, which may increase the overall cost, to a<br>
consumer, of operating a plug-in electric vehicle. Many utility companies<br>
have rate plans that include increased utility fees for power drawn during time<br>
periods when the utility company typically experiences peak usage (e.g.,<br>
"peak usage time periods"). A peak usage time period may include, for<br><br>
example, a period between 5:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m., when many consumers<br>
are at home for the evening performing power-consumptive activities (e.g.,<br>
cooking, laundry, and so on). In addition, such a peak usage time period is<br>
likely to coincide with a time period when a plug-in electric vehicle's battery<br>
charger is connected to a utility AC outlet, as described above. When the<br>
battery charging process occurs during a peak usage time period, the utility<br>
fees charged to the consumer that are associated with recharging the battery<br>
may be higher than they would be if the battery were charged during a non-<br>
peak usage time period (e.g., a time period when the fees are lower, such as<br>
between midnight and 5:00 a.m.).<br>
[0005]	In order to increase the incentives for consumers to purchase<br>
and use plug-in electric vehicles, it is desirable to provide methods and<br>
apparatus to reduce the overall cost, to the consumer, for operating a plug-in<br>
electric vehicle. In addition, it is desirable to provide methods and apparatus<br>
to provide battery charging capabilities while reducing vehicle manufacturing<br>
cost, vehicle weight, and/or the physical space consumed by a traditional<br>
battery charger. Other desirable features and characteristics will become<br>
apparent from the subsequent detailed description and the appended claims,<br>
taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and the foregoing<br>
technical field and background.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006]	An embodiment of a power processing system for use in a<br>
plug-in electric vehicle includes at least one AC electric motor electrically<br>
coupled with a bi-directional inverter system, and an electronic control system.<br>
The electronic control system is operable to provide a drive function by<br>
providing first control signals to the bi-directional inverter system to cause the<br>
bi-directional inverter system to draw DC electrical power from a DC energy<br>
source of the vehicle, to convert the DC power to AC power, and to provide<br>
the AC power to windings of the at least one AC electric motor in order to<br>
propel the vehicle. The electronic control system also is operable to provide a<br><br>
charging function by providing second control signals to the bi-directional<br>
inverter system to cause the bi-directional inverter system to draw AC power<br>
from the windings of the at least one AC electric motor, to convert the AC<br>
power to DC power, and to provide the DC power to the DC energy source in<br>
order to recharge the DC energy source.<br>
[0007]	Another embodiment of a power processing system for use<br>
in a plug-in electric vehicle includes at least one AC electric motor electrically<br>
coupled with a bi-directional inverter system and with a traction system. In an<br>
embodiment, the bi-directional inverter system includes a plurality of<br>
switches, and is adapted cause the system to provide a drive function by<br>
drawing DC electrical power from a DC energy source of the vehicle in<br>
response to receiving first control signals, converting the DC power to AC<br>
power, and providing the AC power to windings of the at least one AC electric<br>
motor in order to propel the vehicle. The bi-directional inverter system also is<br>
adapted cause the system to provide a charging function by drawing AC power<br>
from the windings of the at least one AC electric motor in response to<br>
receiving second control signals, converting the AC power to DC power, and<br>
providing the DC power to the DC energy source in order to recharge the DC<br>
energy source.<br>
[0008]	An embodiment of a method for operating a power<br>
processing system of a plug-in electric vehicle, includes utilizing, during a<br>
first time period, windings of at least one AC electric motor and a bi-<br>
directional inverter system to provide a drive function by causing the bi-<br>
directional inverter system to draw DC electrical power from a DC energy<br>
source of the vehicle in response to receiving first control signals, to convert<br>
the DC power to AC power, and to provide the AC power to the windings of<br>
the at least one AC electric motor in order to propel the vehicle. The method<br>
also includes utilizing, during a second time period, the windings of the at<br>
least one AC electric motor and the bi-directional inverter system to provide a<br>
charging function by causing the bi-directional inverter system to draw AC<br>
power from the windings of the at least one AC electric motor in response to<br><br>
receiving second control signals, to convert the AC power to DC power, and<br>
to provide the DC power to the DC energy source in order to recharge the DC<br>
energy source.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0018]	The following detailed description is merely exemplary in<br>
nature and is not intended to limit the scope or the application and uses of the<br>
inventive subject matter. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by<br>
any expressed or implied theory presented in the preceding technical field,<br>
background, summary or the following detailed description. In the following<br>
description, like reference numbers relate to like elements in each of the<br>
Figures.<br>
[0019]	Embodiments include power processing systems and<br>
methods for use with plug-in electric vehicles. The term "power processing"<br>
includes one or more power processing related functions that include, but are<br>
not limited to, a battery (or other direct current (DC) power source) charging<br>
function, an alternating current (AC) power source function, a utility-<br>
interconnected active power generator function, a utility-interconnected<br>
reactive power generator function, and/or a utility-interconnected active power<br>
filter function, each of which is described in more detail later. As used herein,<br>
the term "electric vehicle" includes both fully electric (e.g., electric only)<br>
vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles. Accordingly, as used herein, the term<br>
plug-in electric vehicle may mean either or both a plug-in fully electric vehicle<br>
and a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV). Embodiments may be integrally<br>
included in a plug-in electric vehicle, an on-board battery charger, and/or an<br>
off-board battery charger.<br>
[0020]	The following description refers to system components,<br>
elements, nodes or features being "coupled" together. As used herein, unless<br>
expressly stated otherwise, the term "coupled" means that one<br>
component/element/node/feature is directly or indirectly joined to (or directly<br>
or indirectly communicates with) another component/element/node/feature,<br><br>
and not necessarily mechanically. Thus, although the schematics shown in<br>
FIGs 2-7 depict various exemplary arrangements of<br>
components/elements/nodes/features, additional intervening components,<br>
elements, nodes, features, or devices may be present in other embodiments of<br>
the depicted subject matter.<br>
[0021]	FIG. 1 is a schematic representation of an example<br>
embodiment of a plug-in electric vehicle 100 that incorporates an embodiment<br>
of a power processing system, as described in more detail below. In the<br>
exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, vehicle 100 is a plug-in fully<br>
electric vehicle or a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle having an electric traction<br>
system. According to various embodiments, the term "plug-in," as applied to<br>
a vehicle, means a vehicle having at least a DC energy source (e.g., DC energy<br>
source 110) and a hardware interface (e.g., AC power interface 114), where<br>
the hardware interface is adapted to connect with an external load (e.g., an<br>
electricity-consuming device) or a utility alternating current (AC) outlet in<br>
order to charge the DC energy source using power supplied by the electric<br>
utility.<br>
[0022]	Vehicle 100 may be any one of a number of different types<br>
of automobiles, such as, for example, a sedan, a wagon, a truck, or a sport<br>
utility vehicle, and may be two-wheel drive (i.e., rear-wheel drive or front-<br>
wheel drive), four-wheel drive, or all-wheel drive. Vehicle 100 may also<br>
incorporate any one of, or combination of, a number of different types of<br>
engines and/or traction systems, such as, for example, a gasoline or diesel<br>
fueled combustion engine, a "flex fuel vehicle" engine (i.e., using a mixture of<br>
gasoline and alcohol), a gaseous compound (e.g., hydrogen and natural gas)<br>
fueled engine, a combustion/electric motor hybrid engine, and an electric<br>
motor.<br>
[0023]	According to various embodiments, vehicle 100 includes one<br>
or more electronic control systems 108, one or more DC energy sources 110,<br>
one or more AC power interfaces 114, one or more inverter systems 116, and<br>
one or more motors 118, 119, 120. In embodiments in which vehicle 100 is a<br><br>
hybrid electric vehicle, vehicle 100 also may include an engine 122 (e.g., an<br>
internal combustion engine). Although only one each of electronic control<br>
system 108, DC energy source 110, AC power interface 114, and inverter<br>
system 116 is illustrated in FIG. 1, more than one (e.g., two or three) of any<br>
one or more of these components may be included in vehicle 100, in other<br>
embodiments. In addition, although three motors 118, 119, 120 are illustrated<br>
in FIG. 1, system 100 may include one, two, or more than three motors, in<br>
other embodiments.<br>
[0024]	In some embodiments, particularly in series-type hybrid<br>
electric vehicles, vehicle 100 may include a first motor 118 or "drive motor"<br>
adapted to provide drive power to wheels 106 through its electrical coupling<br>
with a traction system of the vehicle (e.g., to propel the vehicle), and a second<br>
motor 119 or "alternator" adapted to function as an alternator for cranking the<br>
internal combustion engine (or other type of engine) when starting and/or to<br>
provide additional mechanical power to the traction system for accelerating.<br>
In other embodiments, particularly in parallel-type hybrid electric vehicles,<br>
vehicle 100 may include a single motor 118 adapted to provide drive power<br>
and also to function as an alternator. In still other embodiments, particularly<br>
in power split-type hybrid electric vehicles (also referred to as series-parallel-<br>
type hybrid electric vehicles), vehicle 100 may include a first motor 118<br>
adapted to provide drive power, a second motor 119 adapted to function as an<br>
alternator, and a third motor 120 adapted to function as an auxiliary motor<br>
(e.g., to provide power to an electric pump, AC compressor or other vehicle<br>
component).<br>
[0025]	In an embodiment, each motor 118-120 may include a three-<br>
phase alternating current (AC) electric motor, although other types of motors<br>
having a different number of phases may be employed. As shown in FIG. 1,<br>
motor 118 may also include or cooperate with a transmission such that motor<br>
118 and the transmission are mechanically coupled to at least some of the<br>
vehicle's wheels through one or more drive shafts (not illustrated).<br><br>
[0026]	Electronic control system 108 is in operable communication<br>
with motors 118-120, DC energy source 110, and inverter system 116.<br>
Although not shown in detail, electronic control system 108 may include<br>
various sensors and automotive control modules, or electronic control units<br>
(ECUs) (e.g., an inverter control module and a vehicle controller), at least one<br>
processor, and/or a memory (or other computer-readable medium) which<br>
includes instructions stored thereon for carrying out the processes and methods<br>
as described below.<br>
[0027]	DC energy source 110 may include one or more<br>
rechargeable batteries, battery packs, fuel cells, supercapacitors, or the like.<br>
DC energy source 110 is in operable communication with and/or electrically<br>
coupled with electronic control system 108 and to inverter system 116. In<br>
embodiments in which vehicle 100 includes multiple DC energy sources 110,<br>
a first DC energy source 110 may have a first nominal operating voltage (e.g.,<br>
in a range of 42 to 350 volts), and other DC energy sources may have different<br>
nominal operating voltages (e.g., in a range of 12 to 42 volts).<br>
[0028]	AC power interface 114 is in operable communication with<br>
and/or electrically coupled with inverter system 116. AC power interface 114<br>
includes a hardware interface that is adapted to couple with an electric utility<br>
or other external load in order to exchange AC power with the electric utility<br>
or other external load. In an embodiment, AC power interface 114 includes a<br>
junction box (e.g., junction boxes 212, 312, 412, 512, 612, 712, FIGs. 2-7) that<br>
is adapted to receive an electrical plug (e.g., electrical plugs 290, 390, 490,<br>
590, 690, 790, FIGs. 2-7) that is electrically coupled with or connectable to a<br>
utility AC outlet or an external load. In an alternate embodiment, AC power<br>
interface 114 includes an electrical plug that is adapted to be inserted into a<br>
junction box (e.g., an electrical socket, not illustrated), where the junction box<br>
is electrically coupled with or connectable to an electric utility or other<br>
external load. More particularly, in various embodiments, AC power interface<br>
114 includes a hardware interface selected from a group of hardware<br>
interfaces that includes a two-conductor AC power interface, a three-<br><br>
conductor AC power interface, a single-phase junction box, a two-phase<br>
junction box, a three-phase junction box, a single-phase plug, a two-phase<br>
plug, and a three-phase plug. Embodiments described in conjunction with<br>
FIGs 2-7, later, include vehicular power processing systems that include an<br>
AC power interface in the form of a junction box that is adapted to receive an<br>
electrical plug. The illustrated and described embodiments are not meant to be<br>
limiting, and it is to be understood that other embodiments of inverter systems<br>
may include an electrical plug that is adapted to be inserted into a junction<br>
box.<br>
[0029]	At various times, vehicle 100 may be in either a propulsion<br>
state or a parking state. In either state, various system components may<br>
interoperate as a vehicular power processing system (e.g., vehicular power<br>
processing systems 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, FIGs. 2-7). More<br>
particularly, a vehicular power processing system may include one or more<br>
DC link capacitors (not illustrated), electronic control systems 108, DC energy<br>
sources 110, AC power interfaces 114, inverter systems 116, and motors 118-<br>
120, among other things. Various embodiments of vehicular power processing<br>
systems will be described later in conjunction with FIGs. 2-7.<br>
[0030]	While in the propulsion state, vehicle 100 may be stationary<br>
or moving, and the AC power interface 114 is disconnected from any electric<br>
utility or external load. In the propulsion state, the power processing system<br>
provides a drive function, in which inverter system 116 may draw DC power<br>
from DC energy source 110, convert the DC power to AC waveforms, and<br>
provide the AC waveforms to motors 118-120, in order to propel the vehicle,<br>
to provide alternator power, and/or to provide auxiliary power.<br>
[0031]	While in the parking state, vehicle 100 is stationary and the<br>
AC power interface 114 is coupled with an electric utility and/or another type<br>
of external load (e.g., via a physical coupling between a junction box and a<br>
plug). While in the vehicle parking state, vehicle 100 may be in either a<br>
charging mode or a power processing mode, according to various<br>
embodiments.<br><br>
[0032]	In the charging mode, the power processing system provides<br>
a charging function, in order to charge the vehicle's DC energy source 110<br>
(e.g., a battery) by drawing power from an electric utility in order to recharge<br>
the DC energy source 110, according to an embodiment. Conversely, in the<br>
power processing mode, the power processing system functions to discharge<br>
the vehicle's DC energy source 110 by drawing power from the DC energy<br>
source 110, and supplying that power to the electric utility, according to<br>
another embodiment.<br>
[0033]	More specifically, when vehicle 100 is in the charging<br>
mode, inverter system 116 may provide a charging function by receiving AC<br>
power from the electric utility via one or more motors 118-120 and the AC<br>
power interface 114, converting the received AC power to DC power, and<br>
recharging DC energy source 110 with the DC power. Accordingly, vehicle<br>
100 may function to recharge a DC energy source 110 while vehicle 100 is in<br>
the charging mode.<br>
[0034]	While in the power processing mode, and according to<br>
various embodiments, the system components (e.g., inverter system 116 and<br>
motor(s) 118-120) may be operable to provide any one or more functions<br>
selected from a group of functions that includes, but is not limited to, a stand-<br>
alone AC power source function, a utility-interconnected active power<br>
generator function, a utility-interconnected reactive power generator function,<br>
and/or a utility-interconnected active power filter function. Any one or more<br>
of these functions may be provided through control of the system components<br>
by an electronic control system 108. In other words, an electronic control<br>
system 108 may execute instructions that cause electronic control system 108<br>
to supply control signals to the system components in a manner that causes the<br>
system components to provide one or more of the above functions.<br>
[0035]	According to various embodiments, when vehicle 100 in the<br>
power processing mode, inverter system 116 may operate to draw DC power<br>
from DC energy source 110, to convert the DC power to AC power, and to<br>
supply the AC power to an external load (e.g., an electric utility or another<br><br>
type of load) via one or more motors 118-120 and AC power interface 114. In<br>
addition, when vehicle 100 is in the power processing mode and is providing a<br>
utility-interconnected reactive power generator function, inverter system 116<br>
also may operate to draw AC power from an electric utility via one or more<br>
motors 118-120 and AC power interface 114, to convert the AC power to DC<br>
power, and to provide the DC power to DC energy source 110. More detailed<br>
descriptions of the functioning of various system components will be given<br>
below, in conjunction with the descriptions of the power processing systems of<br>
FIGs. 2-7.<br>
[0036]	In an embodiment, vehicle 100 automatically may switch<br>
between the charging mode and the power processing mode based on various<br>
factors such as, for example, the state of charge (SOC) of the battery and/or<br>
the time of day. For example, vehicle 100 may be programmed not to switch<br>
to the power processing mode when the SOC of the battery is below a first<br>
threshold. As another example, vehicle 100 may be programmed<br>
automatically to switch from the power processing mode to the charging mode<br>
when the SOC of the battery is below a second threshold, which may be the<br>
same as or different from the first threshold. As yet another example, vehicle<br>
100 may be programmed automatically to switch to the power processing<br>
mode at a first time of day (e.g., to supply power to a utility during a peak<br>
usage time period) and to switch to the charging mode at a second time of day<br>
(e.g., to draw power from the utility during a non-peak usage time period). In<br>
addition or alternatively, a user may cause vehicle 100 to switch to either the<br>
charging mode or the power processing mode by providing a user input<br>
through a user interface device that provides the user with the option to choose<br>
the mode.<br>
[0037]	Embodiments described in detail herein indicate that some<br>
or all of the same system components (e.g., inverter system 116, motor(s) 118-<br>
120, DC link capacitors (not illustrated)) may be used in both the propulsion<br>
state and the parking state in order to provide drive power to the vehicle's<br>
traction system, to charge the DC energy source 110 (e.g., in the charging<br><br>
mode), or to supply AC electric power (e.g., in the power processing mode).<br>
It is to be understood that, in other embodiments, vehicle 100 may include<br>
distinct system components for use in either the propulsion state or the parking<br>
state. Further, vehicle 100 may include distinct system components for use<br>
during either the charging mode or the power processing mode.<br>
[0038]	FIGs 2-7 illustrate embodiments of power processing<br>
systems that are suitable for use in plug-in electric vehicles (e.g., vehicle 100,<br>
FIG. 1). The description of FIGs. 2-7, below, apply to configurations when a<br>
vehicle is in a parking state (e.g., the vehicle is stationary and the vehicle's AC<br>
power interface is coupled with an electric utility and/or another type of<br>
external load).<br>
[0039]	FIG. 2 is a schematic circuit representation of an<br>
embodiment of a vehicular power processing system 200, in accordance with a<br>
first example embodiment. System 200 may be suitable for use with a power<br>
split-type hybrid electric vehicle, although system 200 may be adapted for use<br>
with other types of hybrid electric vehicles, as well. In an embodiment,<br>
system 200 includes an inverter system 202 (e.g., inverter system 116, FIG. 1),<br>
a first AC electric motor 204 (e.g., a drive motor 118, FIG. 1), a second AC<br>
electric motor 206 (e.g., an alternator 119, FIG. 1), a rechargeable DC energy<br>
source 208 (e.g., DC energy source 110, FIG. 1), a DC bus capacitor 210, a<br>
junction box 212, and an electronic control system 213 (e.g., electronic control<br>
system 108, FIG. 1).<br>
[0040]	Inverter system 202 is operable as a bi-directional converter.<br>
When controlled to function as a DC-to-AC converter, inverter system 202 is<br>
adapted to convert DC power from DC energy source 208 into AC power for<br>
provision to first and second AC electric motors 204, 206. When controlled to<br>
function as an AC-to-DC converter, inverter system 202 is adapted to convert<br>
AC power from first and second AC electric motors 204, 206 into DC power<br>
for provision to DC energy source 208.<br>
[0041]	Inverter system 202 includes a first inverter section 240 and<br>
a second inverter section 250. In an embodiment, inverter section 240<br><br>
includes an array of six switches 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265 and inverter<br>
section 250 includes an array of six switches 270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275.<br>
Switches 260, 262, 264, 270, 272, 274 may be referred to as "upper switches,"<br>
and switches 261, 263, 265, 271, 273, 275 may be referred to as lower<br>
switches. Each switch 260-265, 270-275 includes a transistor (e.g., an<br>
insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), metal oxide semiconductor field<br>
effect transistor (MOSFET), integrated gate commutated thyristor (IGCTs) or<br>
other high frequency switching device) and an antiparallel diode. During<br>
operation, the direction of current through the transistor is opposite to the<br>
direction of allowable current through the respective diode. During operation,<br>
an inverter control algorithm executed by electronic control system 213<br>
provides drive signals (not illustrated) to the transistors of each of the switches<br>
260-265, 270-275, where the drive signals have characteristics that depend on<br>
the function being implemented by system 200 at the time (e.g., drive<br>
function, charging function, stand-alone AC power source function, utility-<br>
interconnected active power generator function, utility-interconnected reactive<br>
power generator function, or utility-interconnected active power filter<br>
function). In an embodiment, the transistor drive signals include high<br>
frequency pulse width modulated (PWM) signals having variable<br>
characteristics (e.g., duty cycle) that may be adjusted to control the switching<br>
of switches 260-265, 270-275, and thus to control the voltage and current<br>
produced by inverter sections 240 and 250 (e.g., to produce a desired voltage<br>
and/or current amplitude and/or phase shift).<br>
[0042]	As shown, pairs of switches 260-265 in inverter section 240<br>
are electrically coupled in series with each other, and each pair comprises a<br>
switching leg 242, 243, and 244. The switching legs 242-244 are electrically<br>
coupled in parallel with each other. Similarly, pairs of switches 270-275 in<br>
inverter section 250 are electrically coupled in series with each other, and each<br>
pair comprises a switching leg 252, 253, and 254. The switching legs 252-254<br>
are electrically coupled in parallel with each other. Conductive components at<br>
first ends of switching legs 242-244 and 252-254 are electrically coupled with<br><br>
a first inverter terminal 280, and conductive components at second, opposite<br>
ends of switching legs 242-244 and 252-254 are electrically coupled with a<br>
second inverter terminal 282.<br>
[0043]	Rechargeable DC energy source 208 is electrically coupled<br>
in parallel with inverter system 202 across first inverter terminal 280 and<br>
second inverter terminal 282. Rechargeable DC energy source 208 may<br>
include one or more rechargeable batteries, battery packs, supercapacitors, or<br>
the like. In addition, DC bus capacitor 210 is electrically coupled across<br>
rechargeable DC energy source 208, and thus also is coupled in parallel with<br>
inverter system 202 across first inverter terminal 280 and second inverter<br>
terminal 282. DC bus capacitor 210 is adapted to provide DC bus voltage<br>
filtering. In various embodiments, DC bus capacitor 210 may include one or<br>
more electrolytic capacitors, film capacitors, or other types of capacitors.<br>
[0044]	Each of AC electric motors 204, 206 is a three phase motor<br>
that includes a set of three windings (or coils) 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219.<br>
Although not illustrated, AC electric motors 204, 206 each include a stator<br>
assembly (including the windings) and a rotor assembly (including a<br>
ferromagnetic core, windings, and/or permanent magnets). The windings 214-<br>
216 of first AC electric motor 204 are electrically coupled with first inverter<br>
section 240 as follows: 1) a first winding 214 is electrically coupled with a<br>
connection point between the switches of leg 242; 2) a second winding 215 is<br>
electrically coupled with a connection point between the switches of leg 243;<br>
and 3) a third winding 216 is electrically coupled with a connection point<br>
between the switches of leg 244. Similarly, the windings 217-219 of second<br>
AC electric motor 206 are electrically coupled with second inverter section<br>
250 as follows: 1) a first winding 217 is electrically coupled with a connection<br>
point between the switches of leg 252; 2) a second winding 218 is electrically<br>
coupled with a connection point between the switches of leg 253; and 3) a<br>
third winding 219 is electrically coupled with a connection point between the<br>
switches of leg 254.<br><br>
[0045]	Junction box 212 is adapted to receive and electrically<br>
couple with a single-phase or two-phase electrical plug 290, which in turn is<br>
electrically coupled with an external load 292 (e.g., a device or an electric<br>
utility). In an alternate embodiment, system 200 may include a single-phase<br>
or two-phase electrical plug (not illustrated), in place of junction box 212. In<br>
such an embodiment, the electrical plug may be adapted to be received by and<br>
electrically couple with an external junction box (not illustrated). The junction<br>
box, in turn, may be electrically coupled with an external load (e.g., a device<br>
or an electric utility). In either embodiment (e.g., when system 200 includes<br>
either a junction box or a plug), the junction box or plug of the vehicle more<br>
generally may be considered a two-conductor AC power interface (e.g., AC<br>
power interface 114, FIG. 1).<br>
[0046]	In an embodiment, a neutral point 230 of first AC electric<br>
motor 204 may be electrically coupled with a first conductor 232 between first<br>
AC electric motor 204 and junction box 212. Similarly, a neutral point 234 of<br>
second AC electric motor 206 may be electrically coupled with a second<br>
conductor 236 between second AC electric motor 206 and junction box 212.<br>
When system 200 is adapted to process single-phase AC power, first<br>
conductor 232 may carry a phase component of the AC power, and second<br>
conductor 236 may carry a neutral component of the AC power, or vice versa.<br>
When system 200 is adapted to process two-phase AC power, first conductor<br>
232 may carry a first phase component of the AC power, and second<br>
conductor 236 may carry a second phase component of the AC power.<br>
[0047]	When system 200 is in a propulsion state, junction box 212<br>
typically is disconnected from plug 290, in order to enable the vehicle to<br>
move. In addition, to provide a drive function, electronic control system 213<br>
may provide transistor drive signals to inverter system 202, which cause<br>
inverter system 202 to draw DC power from DC energy source 208, to convert<br>
the DC power to AC power, and to provide the AC power to motors 204, 206,<br>
in order to propel the vehicle and/or to provide alternator power. Referring to<br>
first inverter section 240, in an embodiment, electronic control system 213<br><br>
provides the transistor drive signals to switch the upper switches 260, 262, 264<br>
out of phase with each other (e.g., 120 degrees out of phase with each other),<br>
and to switch each of the lower switches 261, 263, 265 out of phase with each<br>
other and also out of phase (e.g., 180 degrees out of phase) with the switching<br>
cycles of the corresponding upper switches 260, 262, 264 within each leg 242,<br>
243, 244. The corresponding switches (e.g., switches in the same position in<br>
the six switch array, such as switches 260 and 270) of the first inverter section<br>
240 and the second inverter section 250 may or may not be switched<br>
synchronously with each other.<br>
[0048]	When system 200 is in a parking state, junction box 212 is<br>
connected to plug 290, and thus to external load 292 (e.g., a device or an<br>
electric utility). When system 200 is in the parking state and additionally is in<br>
a charging mode, a charging function may be provided when electronic control<br>
system 213 provides transistor drive signals to inverter system 202, which<br>
cause inverter system 202 to draw AC power from motors 204, 206, to convert<br>
the AC power to DC power, and to provide the DC power to DC energy<br>
source 208, in order to recharge DC energy source 208. Referring to first<br>
inverter section 240, in an embodiment, electronic control system 213<br>
provides the transistor drive signals to switch the upper switches 260, 262,<br>
264, in phase with each other (e.g., the switching cycles are synchronized),<br>
and to switch each of the lower switches 261, 263, 265, in phase with each<br>
other but out of phase (e.g., 180 degrees out of phase) with the switching<br>
cycles of the corresponding upper switches 260, 262, 264 within each leg 242,<br>
243, 244. In either single-phase operation or two-phase operation, a first<br>
group of switches that includes the upper switches of each leg of first inverter<br>
section 240 (e.g., switches 260, 262, 264) and the lower switches of each leg<br>
of second inverter section 250 (e.g., switches 271, 273, 275) are<br>
synchronously switched. In other words, all six switches of the first group of<br>
switches are turned on or off simultaneously. Similarly, a second group of<br>
switches that includes the lower switches of each leg of first inverter section<br>
240 (e.g., switches 261, 263, 265) and the upper switches of each leg of<br><br>
second inverter section 250 (e.g., switches 270, 272, 274) are synchronously<br>
switched. In other words, all six switches of the second group of switches are<br>
turned on or off simultaneously. Switching of the first group of six switches is<br>
180 degrees out of phase with the switching of the second group of six<br>
switches.<br>
[0049]	Alternatively, when system 200 is in a parking state and<br>
additionally is in a power processing mode, one or more of a variety of<br>
functions may be provided in accordance with the transistor drive signals<br>
provided by electronic control system 213. In a particular embodiment, and as<br>
mentioned previously, the functions that may be provided in the parking state<br>
and the power processing mode may include any one or more functions<br>
selected from a group of functions that includes, but is not limited to, a stand-<br>
alone AC power source function, a utility-interconnected active power<br>
generator function, a utility-interconnected reactive power generator function,<br>
and/or a utility-interconnected active power filter function. For the functions<br>
listed in the previous sentence, control of switches 260-265 of first inverter<br>
section 240 and second inverter section 250 may be performed in a similar<br>
manner as the control of switches 260-265 of first inverter section 240 and<br>
second inverter section 250 in charging mode. In other words, referring to<br>
first inverter section 240, electronic control system 213 provides the transistor<br>
drive signals to switch the upper switches 260, 262, 264 in phase with each<br>
other, and to switch each of the lower switches 261, 263, 265 in phase with<br>
each other but out of phase with the switching cycles of the corresponding<br>
upper switches 260, 262, 264 within each leg 242, 243, 244, in an<br>
embodiment. In addition, the corresponding switches of second inverter<br>
section 250 are switched synchronously with the corresponding switches of<br>
first inverter section 240.<br>
[0050]	The stand-alone AC power source function may be<br>
provided, for example, when system 200 is in operable communication with<br>
and/or electrically coupled with an external load 292 in the form of a device<br>
(e.g., a device that operates using 120 or 240 AC volts) via junction box 212<br><br>
and plug 290. To provide the AC power source function, electronic control<br>
system 213 provides transistor drive signals to inverter system 202, which<br>
cause inverter system 202 to draw DC power from DC energy source 208, to<br>
convert the DC power to AC power, and to supply the AC power to external<br>
load 292 via the windings 214-219 of motors 204, 206, junction box 212, and<br>
plug 290.<br>
[0051]	The utility-interconnected active power generator function,<br>
utility-interconnected reactive power generator function, and/or utility-<br>
interconnected active power filter function may be provided, for example,<br>
when system 200 is in operable communication with and/or electrically<br>
coupled with an external load 292 in the form of an electric utility via junction<br>
box 212 and plug 290. To provide the utility-interconnected active power<br>
generator function, electronic control system 213 provides transistor drive<br>
signals to inverter system 202, which causes inverter system 202 to draw DC<br>
power from DC energy source 208, to convert the DC power to AC power,<br>
and to supply the AC power to the external load 292 (e.g., the electric utility)<br>
via the windings 214-219 of motors 204, 206, junction box 212, and plug 290.<br>
In order to control the quantity of active power supplied by system 200 to the<br>
electric utility, the magnitude of the AC power may be adjusted through<br>
adjustment of the characteristics of the transistor drive signals provided by<br>
electronic control system 213 to inverter system 202 (e.g., the magnitude of<br>
the AC power is increased to supply more active power to the utility and<br>
decreased to supply less active power to the utility).<br>
[0052]	To provide the utility-interconnected reactive power<br>
generator function, electronic control system 213 provides transistor drive<br>
signals to inverter system 202 during a first half of an electric cycle, which<br>
cause inverter system 202 to draw DC power from DC energy source 208, to<br>
convert the DC power to AC power, and to supply the AC power to the<br>
external load 292 (e.g., the electric utility) via the windings 214-219 of motors<br>
204, 206, junction box 212, and plug 290. During a second half of the electric<br>
cycle, electronic control system 213 provides transistor drive signals to<br><br>
inverter system 202, which cause inverter system 202 to draw AC power from<br>
the external load 292 (e.g., the electric utility) via the windings 214-219 of<br>
motors 204, 206, junction box 212, and plug 290, to convert the AC power to<br>
DC power, and to supply the DC power to the DC energy source 208. In order<br>
to control the quantity of reactive power circulated by system 200 between<br>
itself and the electric utility, the phase shift between the voltage and current<br>
waveforms of the AC power may be adjusted through adjustment of the<br>
characteristics of the transistor drive signals provided by electronic control<br>
system 213 to inverter system 202 (e.g., the phase shift may be increased<br>
toward 90 degrees to supply more reactive power to the utility and decreased<br>
toward 0 degrees to supply less reactive power to the utility).<br>
[0053]	Finally, to provide the utility-interconnected power filter<br>
function, electronic control system 213 provides transistor drive signals to<br>
inverter system 202, which cause inverter system 202 to draw DC power from<br>
DC energy source 208, to convert the DC power to AC power, and to supply<br>
the AC power to the external load 292 (e.g., the electric utility) via the<br>
windings 214-219 of motors 204, 206, junction box 212, and plug 290 in an<br>
effort to help the electric utility to create more sinusoidal voltage/current<br>
waveforms.<br>
[0054]	FIG. 3 is a schematic circuit representation of an<br>
embodiment of a vehicular power processing system 300, in accordance with a<br>
second example embodiment. System 300 may be suitable for use with a<br>
parallel-type hybrid electric vehicle, although system 300 may be adapted for<br>
use with other types of hybrid electric vehicles, as well. In an embodiment,<br>
system 300 includes an inverter system 302 (e.g., inverter system 116, FIG. 1),<br>
an AC electric motor 304 (e.g., motor 118, 119 or 120, FIG. 1), a rechargeable<br>
DC energy source 308 (e.g., DC energy source 110, FIG. 1), a DC bus<br>
capacitor 310, a junction box 312, an electronic control system 313 (e.g.,<br>
electronic control system 108, FIG. 1), and a switch array 318. The functions<br>
and various embodiments relating to DC energy source 308 and DC bus<br>
capacitor 310 are similar to the functions and various embodiments of<br><br>
analogous components in FIG. 2 (e.g., DC energy source 208 and DC bus<br>
capacitor 310), and accordingly are not repeated here for purposes of brevity.<br>
[0055]	Inverter system 302 is operable as a bi-directional converter,<br>
as described in conjunction with FIG. 2, and includes an inverter section 340.<br>
In an embodiment, inverter section 340 includes an array of six switches,<br>
which may be configured in the same manner and function the same as<br>
embodiments of switches 260-265, discussed above in conjunction with FIG.<br>
2. In addition, during operation, an inverter control algorithm executed by an<br>
electronic control system 313 provides transistor drive signals (not illustrated)<br>
depending on the function being implemented by system 300 at the time, as<br>
also discussed above in conjunction with FIG. 2. To provide a drive function<br>
or to provide a charging function, the switches of inverter section 340 may be<br>
controlled in substantially the same manner as described above when switches<br>
260-265 (FIG. 2) are controlled to provide a drive function. Otherwise, to<br>
provide a utility-interconnected active power generator function, a utility-<br>
interconnected reactive power generator function, and/or a utility-<br>
interconnected active power filter function, the switches of inverter section<br>
340 may be controlled in substantially the same manner as described above<br>
when switches 260-265 (FIG. 2) are controlled to provide the corresponding<br>
functions.<br>
[0056]	As shown, pairs of switches in inverter section 340 are<br>
electrically coupled in series with each other, and each pair comprises a<br>
switching leg 342, 343, and 344. The switching legs 342-344 are electrically<br>
coupled in parallel with each other. Conductive components at first ends of<br>
switching legs 342-344 are electrically coupled with a first inverter terminal<br>
380, and conductive components at second, opposite ends of switching legs<br>
342-344 are electrically coupled with a second inverter terminal 382.<br>
[0057]	Rechargeable DC energy source 308 is electrically coupled<br>
in parallel with inverter system 302 across first inverter terminal 380 and<br>
second inverter terminal 382. In addition, DC bus capacitor 310 is electrically<br>
coupled across rechargeable DC energy source 308, and thus also is coupled in<br><br>
parallel with inverter system 302 across first inverter terminal 380 and second<br>
inverter terminal 382.<br>
[0058]	In contrast with junction box 212 of FIG. 2, junction box<br>
312 is adapted to receive and electrically couple with a three-phase electrical<br>
plug 390, which in turn is electrically coupled with an external load 392 (e.g.,<br>
a device or an electric utility). In an alternate embodiment, system 300 may<br>
include a three-phase electrical plug (not illustrated), in place of junction box<br>
312, as described above in conjunction with FIG. 2. In either embodiment<br>
(e.g., when system 200 includes either a junction box or a plug), the junction<br>
box or plug of the vehicle more generally may be considered a three-conductor<br>
AC power interface (e.g., AC power interface 114, FIG. 1).<br>
[0059]	AC electric motor 304 is a three phase motor that includes a<br>
set of three windings (or coils) 314, 315, 316. Although not illustrated, AC<br>
electric motor 304 includes a stator assembly (including the windings) and a<br>
rotor assembly (including a ferromagnetic core, windings, and/or permanent<br>
magnets). The windings 314-316 of AC electric motor 204 are electrically<br>
coupled with inverter section 340 as follows: 1) a first end of winding 314 is<br>
electrically coupled with a connection point between the switches of leg 342;<br>
2) a first end of second winding 315 is electrically coupled with a connection<br>
point between the switches of leg 343; and 3) a first end of third winding 316<br>
is electrically coupled with a connection point between the switches of leg<br>
344.<br>
[0060]	In an embodiment, switch array 318 includes three solid<br>
state switches in the form of three back-to-back silicon controlled rectifiers<br>
(SCR). The windings 314-316 of AC electric motor 204 are electrically<br>
coupled with switch array 318 as follows: 1) a second end of winding 314 is<br>
electrically coupled with a first switch of switch array 318; 2) a second end of<br>
second winding 315 is electrically coupled with a second switch of switch<br>
array 318; and 3) a second end of third winding 316 is electrically coupled<br>
with a third switch of switch array 318.<br><br>
[0061]	A neutral point 305 of AC electric motor 304 is separated, in<br>
an embodiment, by switch array 318. In an embodiment, switch array 318<br>
includes three switches, arranged in parallel. Each switch of switch array 318<br>
may be controlled into a first position (as shown in FIG. 3) or a second<br>
position. In an embodiment, the position of the switches in switch array 318<br>
may be controlled by a coordinating circuit (not illustrated) within system 300<br>
according to whether or not plug 390 is inserted into junction box 312. When<br>
plug 390 is not inserted into junction box 312, the switches of switch array<br>
318 may be controlled to remain in the first position. When plug 390 is<br>
inserted into the junction box 312, the switches of switch array 318 may be<br>
controlled to remain in the second position, in an embodiment.<br>
[0062]	In the first position, the second ends of windings 314, 315,<br>
316 are disconnected from junction box 312, and are interconnected to form<br>
the neutral point 305. In an embodiment, the switches of switch array 318<br>
may be controlled into the first position in the propulsion state, for example.<br>
In the second position, the second end of each winding 314, 315, 316 is<br>
electrically coupled with one of the three conductors 332, 333, 334 between<br>
junction box 312 and switch array 318. Accordingly, when the switches of<br>
switch array 318 are in the second position, first conductor 332 may carry a<br>
first phase component of the AC power, second conductor 333 may cany a<br>
second phase component of the AC power, and third conductor 334 may carry<br>
a third phase component of the AC power. In an embodiment, the switches of<br>
switch array 318 may be controlled into the second position in the parking<br>
state, for example, in order to interconnect system 300 with external load 392<br>
via junction box 312, and to enable system 300 to provide the charging<br>
function, the utility-interconnected active power generator function, the utility-<br>
interconnected reactive power generator function, and/or the utility-<br>
interconnected active power filter function.<br>
[0063]	FIG. 4 is a schematic circuit representation of an<br>
embodiment of a vehicular power processing system 400, in accordance with a<br>
third example embodiment. System 400 may be suitable for use with a power<br><br>
split-type hybrid electric vehicle, although system 400 may be adapted for use<br>
with other types of hybrid electric vehicles, as well. In an embodiment,<br>
system 400 includes an inverter system 402 (e.g., inverter system 116, FIG: 1),<br>
a first AC electric motor 404 (e.g., a drive motor 118, FIG. 1), a second AC<br>
electric motor 405 (e.g., an alternator 119, FIG. 1), a third AC electric motor<br>
406 (e.g., an auxiliary motor 120, FIG. 1), a rechargeable DC energy source<br>
408 (e.g., DC energy source 110, FIG. 1), a DC bus capacitor 410, a junction<br>
box 412, and an electronic control system 413 (e.g., electronic control system<br>
108, FIG. 1). The functions and various embodiments relating to DC energy<br>
source 408 and DC bus capacitor 410 are similar to the functions and various<br>
embodiments of analogous components in FIG. 2 (e.g., DC energy source 208<br>
and DC bus capacitor 310), and accordingly are not repeated here for purposes<br>
of brevity.<br>
[0064]	Inverter system 402 is operable as a bi-directional converter,<br>
as described in conjunction with FIG. 2, and includes a first inverter section<br>
440, a second inverter section 450, and a third inverter section 480. In an<br>
embodiment, inverter sections 440,450,480 each include an array of six<br>
switches, which may be configured in the same manner and function the same<br>
as embodiments of switches 260-265, discussed above in conjunction with<br>
FIG. 2. In an embodiment, however, the switches of first and second inverter<br>
sections 440, 450 may be adapted for high power applications (e.g., as they<br>
may be electrically coupled with a drive motor 404 and an alternator motor<br>
405, respectively), and the switches of third inverter section 480 may be<br>
adapted for significantly lower power applications (e.g., as they may be<br>
electrically coupled with an auxiliary motor 406). In addition, during<br>
operation, an inverter control algorithm executed by electronic control system<br>
413 provides transistor drive signals (not illustrated) depending on the<br>
function being implemented by system 400 at the time, as also discussed<br>
above in conjunction with FIG. 2. In an embodiment, through control of the<br>
switching of the first, second, and third inverter sections 440,450, 480, motors<br><br>
404-406 are operated out of phase with each other (e.g., 120 degrees out of<br>
phase).<br>
[0065]	As shown, pairs of switches in inverter section 440 are<br>
electrically coupled in series with each other, and each pair comprises a<br>
switching leg 442,443, and 444. The switching legs 442-444 are electrically<br>
coupled in parallel with each other. Similarly, pairs of switches in inverter<br>
section 450 are electrically coupled in series with each other, and each pair<br>
comprises a switching leg 452,453, and 454. The switching legs 452-454 are<br>
electrically coupled in parallel with each other. Finally, pairs of switches in<br>
inverter section 480 are electrically coupled in series with each other, and each<br>
pair comprises a switching leg 482, 483, and 484. The switching legs 482-484<br>
are electrically coupled in parallel with each other. Conductive components at<br>
first ends of switching legs 442-444,452-454, and 482-484 are electrically<br>
coupled with a first inverter terminal 486, and conductive components at<br>
second, opposite ends of switching legs 442-444,452-454, and 482-484 are<br>
electrically coupled with a second inverter terminal 488.<br>
[0066]	Rechargeable DC energy source 408 is electrically coupled<br>
in parallel with inverter system 402 across first inverter terminal 486 and<br>
second inverter terminal 488. In addition, DC bus capacitor 410 is electrically<br>
coupled across rechargeable DC energy source 408, and thus also is coupled in<br>
parallel with inverter system 402 across first inverter terminal 486 and second<br>
inverter terminal 488.<br>
[0067]	Similar to junction box 312 of FIG. 3, junction box 412 is<br>
adapted to receive and electrically couple with a three-phase electrical plug<br>
490, which in turn is electrically coupled with an external load 392 (e.g., a<br>
device or an electric utility). In an alternate embodiment, system 400 may<br>
include a three-phase electrical plug (not illustrated), in place of junction box<br>
412, as described above in conjunction with FIG. 2. In either embodiment<br>
(e.g., when system 200 includes either a junction box or a plug), the junction<br>
box or plug of the vehicle more generally may be considered a three-conductor<br>
AC power interface (e.g., AC power interface 114, FIG. 1).<br><br>
[0068]	Each of AC electric motors 404-406 is a three phase motor<br>
that includes a set of three windings (or coils) 414, 415,416, 417,418,419,<br>
420,421,422. Although not illustrated, AC electric motors 404-406 each<br>
include a stator assembly (including the windings) and a rotor assembly<br>
(including a ferromagnetic core, windings, and/or permanent magnets). The<br>
windings 414-416 of first AC electric motor 404 are electrically coupled with<br>
first inverter section 440 as follows: 1) a first winding 414 is electrically<br>
coupled with a connection point between the switches of leg 442; 2) a second<br>
winding 415 is electrically coupled with a connection point between the<br>
switches of leg 443; and 3) a third winding 416 is electrically coupled with a<br>
connection point between the switches of leg 444. Similarly, the windings<br>
417-419 of second AC electric motor 405 are electrically coupled with second<br>
inverter section 450 as follows: 1) a first winding 417 is electrically coupled<br>
with a connection point between the switches of leg 452; 2) a second winding<br>
418 is electrically coupled with a connection point between the switches of leg<br>
453; and 3) a third winding 419 is electrically coupled with a connection point<br>
between the switches of leg 454. Finally, the windings 420-422 of third AC<br>
electric motor 406 are electrically coupled with third inverter section 480 as<br>
follows: 1) a first winding 420 is electrically coupled with a connection point<br>
between the switches of leg 482; 2) a second winding 421 is electrically<br>
coupled with a connection point between the switches of leg 483; and 3) a<br>
third winding 422 is electrically coupled with a connection point between the<br>
switches of leg 484.<br>
[0069]	In an embodiment, a neutral point 430 of first AC electric<br>
motor 404 may be electrically coupled with a first conductor 431 between first<br>
AC electric motor 404 and junction box 412. Similarly, a neutral point 432 of<br>
second AC electric motor 405 may be electrically coupled with a second<br>
conductor 433 between second AC electric motor 405 and junction box 412.<br>
Finally, a neutral point 434 of third AC electric motor 406 may be electrically<br>
coupled with a third conductor 435 between third AC electric motor 406 and<br>
junction box 412.<br><br>
[0070]	As mentioned previously, through control of the switching<br>
of the first, second, and third inverter sections 440, 450, 480, motors 404-406<br>
are operated out of phase with each other (e.g., 120 degrees out of phase).<br>
Accordingly, first conductor 431 may carry a first phase component of the AC<br>
power, second conductor 433 may carry a second phase component of the AC<br>
power, and third conductor 435 may carry a third phase component of the AC<br>
power. In an embodiment, the phase components of the AC power are limited<br>
by the capacity of inverter section 480, which may include relatively low-<br>
power switches, as described previously.<br>
[0071]	FIG. 5 is a schematic circuit representation of an<br>
embodiment of a vehicular power processing system 500, in accordance with a<br>
fourth example embodiment. System 500 may be suitable for use with a<br>
series-type hybrid electric vehicle or a power split-type hybrid electric vehicle,<br>
although system 500 may be adapted for use with other types of hybrid<br>
electric vehicles, as well. In an embodiment, system 500 includes an inverter<br>
system 502 (e.g., inverter system 116, FIG. 1), a first AC electric motor 504<br>
(e.g., a drive motor 118, FIG. 1), a second AC electric motor 506 (e.g., an<br>
alternator 119, FIG. 1), a rechargeable DC energy source 508 (e.g., DC energy<br>
source 110, FIG. 1), a plurality of DC bus capacitors 510, 511, a junction box<br>
512, an electronic control system 513 (e.g., electronic control system 108,<br>
FIG. 1), and an inductor 545. The functions and various embodiments relating<br>
to DC energy source 508 are similar to the functions and various embodiments<br>
of analogous components in FIG. 2 (e.g., DC energy source 208), and<br>
accordingly are not repeated here for purposes of brevity.<br>
[0072]	Inverter system 502 is operable as a bi-directional converter,<br>
as described in conjunction with FIG. 2, and includes a first inverter section<br>
540 and a second inverter section 550. In an embodiment, inverter sections<br>
540, 550 each include an array of six switches, which may be configured in<br>
the same manner and function the same as embodiments of switches 260-265,<br>
discussed above in conjunction with FIG. 2. In addition, during operation, an<br>
inverter control algorithm executed by electronic control system 513 provides<br><br>
transistor drive signals (not illustrated) depending on the function being<br>

[0073]	As shown, pairs of switches in inverter section 540 are<br>
electrically coupled in series with each other, and each pair comprises a<br>
switching leg 542, 543, and 544. The switching legs 542-544 are electrically<br>
coupled in parallel with each other. Similarly, pairs of switches in inverter<br>
section 550 are electrically coupled in series with each other, and each pair<br>
comprises a switching leg 552, 553, and 554. The switching legs 552-554 are<br>
electrically coupled in parallel with each other. Conductive components at<br>
first ends of switching legs 542-544 and 552-554 are electrically coupled with<br>
a first inverter terminal 580, and conductive components at second, opposite<br>
ends of switching legs 542-544 and 552-554 are electrically coupled with a<br>
second inverter terminal 582.<br>
[0074]	Rechargeable DC energy source 508 is electrically coupled<br>
in parallel with inverter system 502 across first inverter terminal 580 and<br>
second inverter terminal 582. In an embodiment, DC bus capacitors 510, 511<br>
include two series connected capacitors 510, 511, although system 500 may<br>
include more than two series connected capacitors, in other embodiments. In<br>
addition, the ends of the series connected DC bus capacitors 510, 511 are<br>
electrically coupled across rechargeable DC energy source 508, and thus also<br>
are coupled in parallel with inverter system 502 across first inverter terminal<br>
580 and second inverter terminal 582.<br>
[0075]	Similar to junction box 312 of FIG. 3, junction box 512 is<br>
adapted to receive and electrically couple with a three-phase electrical plug<br>
590, which in turn is electrically coupled with an external load 592 (e.g., a<br>
device or an electric utility). In an alternate embodiment, system 500 may<br>
include a three-phase electrical plug (not illustrated), in place of junction box<br>
512, as described above in conjunction with FIG. 2. In either embodiment<br><br>
(e.g., when system 200 includes either a junction box or a plug), the junction<br>
box or plug of the vehicle more generally may be considered a three-conductor<br>
AC power interface (e.g., AC power interface 114, FIG. 1).<br>
[0076]	Each of AC electric motors 504, 506 is a three phase motor<br>
that includes a set of three windings (or coils) 514, 515, 516, 517, 518, 519.<br>
Although not illustrated, AC electric motors 504, 506 each includes a stator<br>
assembly (including the windings) and a rotor assembly (including a<br>
ferromagnetic core, windings, and/or permanent magnets). The windings 514-<br>
516 of first AC electric motor 504 are electrically coupled with first inverter<br>
section 540 as follows: 1) a first winding 514 is electrically coupled with a<br>
connection point between the switches of leg 542; 2) a second winding 515 is<br>
electrically coupled with a connection point between the switches of leg 543;<br>
and 3) a third winding 516 is electrically coupled with a connection point<br>
between the switches of leg 544. Similarly, the windings 517-519 of second<br>
AC electric motor 506 are electrically coupled with second inverter section<br>
550 as follows: 1) a first winding 517 is electrically coupled with a connection<br>
point between the switches of leg 552; 2) a second winding 518 is electrically<br>
coupled with a connection point between the switches of leg 553; and 3) a<br>
third winding 519 is electrically coupled with a connection point between the<br>
switches of leg 554.<br>
{0077]	A neutral point 532 of first AC electric motor 504 may be<br>
electrically coupled with a second conductor 533 between first AC electric<br>
motor 504 and junction box 512. Similarly, a neutral point 534 of second AC<br>
electric motor 506 may be electrically coupled with a third conductor 535<br>
between second AC electric motor 506 and junction box 512.<br>
[0078]	In an embodiment, a connection point 523 (e.g., a mid-point,<br>
electrically) between DC bus capacitors 510, 511 is electrically coupled with a<br>
first end of inductor 545, and a second end of inductor 545 is electrically<br>
coupled with a first conductor 531 between inductor 545 and junction box<br>
512. Inductor 545 may include, for example, an inductor element adapted to<br>
provide current regulation for the current drawn from connection point 523.<br><br>
[0079]	As mentioned previously, through control of the switching<br>
of the first and second inverter sections 540, 550, motors 504, 506 are<br>
operated out of phase with each other (e.g., 120 degrees out of phase). In<br>
addition, when system 500 is a balanced, three-phase system, according to an<br>
embodiment, the phase of the current at the connection point 523 between DC<br>
bus capacitors 510, 511 is indirectly controlled by directly controlling the<br>
phases of the currents through motors 504, 506. For example, when the first<br>
and second inverter sections 540, 550 are controlled so that the currents at the<br>
neutral points 532, 534 are 120 degrees out of phase with each other, the<br>
current at the connection point 523 between DC bus capacitors 510, 511 also<br>
will be 120 degrees out of phase with the motor currents. Accordingly, with<br>
the above-described couplings between the various system components, first<br>
conductor 532 may carry a first phase component of the AC power (e.g., from<br>
connection point 523), second conductor 533 may carry a second phase<br>
component of the AC power (e.g., from neutral point 532), and third conductor<br>
534 may carry a third phase component of the AC power (e.g., from neutral<br>
point 534).<br>

in parallel with inverter system 602 across first inverter terminal 680 and<br>
second inverter terminal 682. In addition, DC bus capacitor 610 is electrically<br>
coupled across rechargeable DC energy source 608, and thus also is coupled in<br>
parallel with inverter system 602 across first inverter terminal 680 and second<br>
inverter terminal 682.<br>
[0084]	Similar to junction box 312 of FIG. 3, junction box 612 is<br>
adapted to receive and electrically couple with a three-phase electrical plug<br><br>
690, which in turn is electrically coupled with an external load 692 (e.g., a<br>
device or an electric utility). In an alternate embodiment, system 600 may<br>
include a three-phase electrical plug (not illustrated), in place of junction box<br>
612, as described above in conjunction with FIG. 2. In either embodiment<br>
(e.g., when system 200 includes either a junction box or a plug), the junction<br>
box or plug of the vehicle more generally may be considered a three-conductor<br>
AC power interface (e.g., AC power interface 114, FIG. I).<br>
[0085]	Each of AC electric motors 604,606 is a three phase motor<br>
that includes a set of three windings (or coils) 614, 615, 616, 617, 618, 619.<br>
Although not illustrated, AC electric motors 604,606 each includes a stator<br>
assembly (including the windings) and a rotor assembly (including a<br>

coupled with a connection point between the switches of leg 653; and 3) a<br>
third winding 619 is electrically coupled with a connection point between the<br>

[0086]	A neutral point 632 of first AC electric motor 604 may be<br>
electrically coupled with a second conductor 633 between first AC electric<br>
motor 604 and junction box 612. Similarly, a neutral point 634 of second AC<br>
electric motor 606 may be electrically coupled with a third conductor 636<br>
between second AC electric motor 606 and junction box 612.<br>
[0087]	Half bridge 611 includes include two series connected<br>
switches 694, 696, although system 600 may include more than two series<br><br>
connected switches to form a half bridge, in other embodiments. In an<br>
embodiment, switches 694,696 may be configured substantially the same as<br>
the switches of first and second inverter sections 640, 650. In addition, the<br>
ends of the series connected switches 694, 696 are electrically coupled across<br>
rechargeable DC energy source 608, and thus also are coupled in parallel with<br>
DC bus capacitor 610 and inverter system 602 across first inverter terminal<br>

end of inductor 645 is electrically coupled with a first conductor 631 between<br>
inductor 645 and junction box 612. Inductor 645 may include, for example, an<br>
inductor element adapted to provide current regulation for the current drawn<br>
from connection point 623.<br>
[0089]	As mentioned previously, through control of the switching<br>
of the first and second inverter sections 640, 650, motors 604, 606 are<br>
operated out of phase with each other (e.g., 120 degrees out of phase). In<br>
addition, in an embodiment, switching of switches 694, 696 of half bridge 511<br>
is controlled to produce a current, at connection point 623, that is out of phase<br>
with the phases of the currents through motors 604,606. For example, when<br>
the first and second inverter sections 640, 650 are controlled so that the<br>
currents at the neutral points 632, 634 are 120 degrees out of phase with each<br>
other, switches 694, 696 may be controlled to produce a current at connection<br>
point 623 that is 120 degrees out of phase with the motor currents.<br>
Accordingly, with the above-described couplings between the various system<br>
components, first conductor 632 may carry a first phase component of the AC<br>
power (e.g., from connection point 623), second conductor 633 may carry a<br>
second phase component of the AC power (e.g., from neutral point 632), and<br>
third conductor 634 may carry a third phase component of the AC power (e.g.,<br>
from neutral point 634).<br>

source 110, FIG. 1), a DC bus capacitor 710, a switch 721, a junction box 712,<br>
and an electronic control system 713 (e.g., electronic control system 108, FIG.<br>
1). The functions and various embodiments relating to DC energy source 708<br>
are similar to the functions and various embodiments of analogous<br>
components in FIG. 2 (e.g., DC energy source 208), and accordingly are not<br>
repeated here for purposes of brevity.<br>
[0091]	Inverter system 702 is operable as a bi-directional converter,<br>
as described in conjunction with FIG. 2, and includes a first inverter section<br>
740 and a second inverter section 750. In an embodiment, inverter sections<br>
740, 750 each include an array of six switches, which may be configured in<br>
the same manner and function the same as embodiments of switches 260-265,<br>
discussed above in conjunction with FIG. 2. In addition, during operation, an<br>
inverter control algorithm executed by electronic control system 713 provides<br>
transistor drive signals (not illustrated) depending on the function being<br>
implemented by system 700 at the time, as also discussed above in<br>
conjunction with FIG. 2.<br>
[0092]	As shown, pairs of switches in inverter section 740 are<br>
electrically coupled in series with each other, and each pair comprises a<br>
switching leg 742, 743, and 744. The switching legs 742-744 are electrically<br>
coupled in parallel with each other. Similarly, pairs of switches in inverter<br>
section 750 are electrically coupled in series with each other, and each pair<br>
comprises a switching leg 752, 753, and 754. The switching legs 752-754 are<br>
electrically coupled in parallel with each other. Conductive components at<br>
first ends of switching legs 742-744 and 752-754 are electrically coupled with<br><br>
a first inverter terminal 780, and conductive components at second, opposite<br>
ends of switching legs 742-744 and 752-754 are electrically coupled with a<br>
second inverter terminal 782.<br>
[0093]	Rechargeable DC energy source 708 is electrically coupled<br>
in parallel with inverter system 702 across first inverter terminal 780 and<br>
second inverter terminal 782. In addition, DC bus capacitor 710 is electrically<br>
coupled across rechargeable DC energy source 708, and thus also is coupled in<br>
parallel with inverter system 702 across first inverter terminal 780 and second<br>
inverter terminal 782.<br>
[0094]	Similar to junction box 312 of FIG. 3, junction box 712 is<br>
adapted to receive and electrically couple with a three-phase electrical plug<br>
790, which in turn is electrically coupled with an external load 792 (e.g., a<br>
device or an electric utility). In an alternate embodiment, system 700 may<br>
include a three-phase electrical plug (not illustrated), in place of junction box<br>
712, as described above in conjunction with FIG. 2. In either embodiment<br>
(e.g., when system 200 includes either a junction box or a plug), the junction<br>
box or plug of the vehicle more generally may be considered a three-conductor<br>
AC power interface (e.g., AC power interface 114, FIG. 1).<br>
[0095]	Each of AC electric motors 704, 706 is a three phase motor<br>
that includes a set of three windings (or coils) 714, 715, 716, 717, 718, 719.<br>
Although not illustrated, AC electric motors 704, 706 each includes a stator<br>
assembly (including the windings) and a rotor assembly (including a<br>
ferromagnetic core, windings, and/or permanent magnets). The windings 714-<br>
716 of first AC electric motor 704 are electrically coupled with first inverter<br>
section 740 as follows: 1) a first end of first winding 714 is electrically<br>
coupled with a connection point between the switches of leg 742; 2) a first end<br>
of a second winding 715 is electrically coupled with a connection point<br>
between the switches of leg 743; and 3) a first end of a third winding 716 is<br>
electrically coupled with a connection point between the switches of leg 744.<br>
Similarly, first ends of the windings 717-719 of second AC electric motor 706<br>
are electrically coupled with second inverter section 750 as follows: 1) a first<br><br>
end of first winding 717 is electrically coupled with a connection point<br>
between the switches of leg 752; 2) a first end of second winding 718 is<br>
electrically coupled with a connection point between the switches of leg 753;<br>
and 3) a first end of third winding 719 is electrically coupled with a<br>
connection point between the switches of leg 754.<br>
[0096]	A neutral point 732 of first AC electric motor 704 may be<br>
electrically coupled with a first conductor 733 between first AC electric motor<br>
704 and junction box 712. A neutral point 734 of AC electric motor 706 is<br>
separated, in an embodiment, by switch 721. In an embodiment, switch 721<br>
includes a solid state switch in the form of an SCR. Switch 721 may be<br>
controlled into a first position (as shown in FIG. 7) or a second position. In an<br>
embodiment, the position of the switch 721 may be controlled by a<br>
coordinating circuit (not illustrated) within system 700 according to whether<br>
or not plug 790 is inserted into junction box 712. When plug 790 is not<br>
inserted into junction box 712, switch 721 may be controlled to remain in the<br>
first position. When plug 790 is inserted into the junction box 712, switch 721<br>
may be controlled to remain in the second position, in an embodiment.<br>
[0097]	The second end of winding 719 is electrically coupled to<br>
switch 721. Accordingly, in the first position, the second end of winding 719<br>
is disconnected from junction box 712, and is interconnected with the second<br>
ends of windings 717, 718 to form the neutral point 734. In an embodiment,<br>
switch 721 may be controlled into the first position in the propulsion state, for<br>
example. In the second position, the second end of winding 719 is electrically<br>
coupled with a second conductor 735 between junction box 712 and switch<br>
721. Second ends of windings 717, 718 remain electrically coupled together<br>
and with a third conductor 736 between motor 706 and junction box 712.<br>
[0098]	Through control of the switching of the first and second<br>
inverter sections 740, 750, motor 704 is operated to produce a first phase<br>
current, and motor 706 is operated to produce second and third phase currents,<br>
where the first, second, and third phase currents are out of phase with each<br>
other (e.g., 120 degrees out of phase). More particularly, the switching of the<br><br>
first and second switching legs 752, 753 of inverter section 750 are controlled<br>
synchronously to produce a phase current at neutral point 734 of motor 706<br>
that is out of phase (e.g., 120 degrees out of phase) with the phase current at<br>
the neutral point 732 of motor 704. In addition, switching of the third<br>
switching leg 754 of inverter section 750 is controlled to produce a phase<br>
current at the second end of winding 719 that is out of phase (e.g., 120 degrees<br>
out of phase) with the phase currents at neutral points 732, 734.<br>
[0099]	Accordingly, with the above-described couplings between<br>
the various system components, when switch 721 is in the second position,<br>
first conductor 733 may carry a first phase component of the AC power (e.g.,<br>
from neutral point 732), second conductor 735 may carry a second phase<br>
component of the AC power (e.g., from winding 719), and third conductor 736<br>
may carry a third phase component of the AC power (e.g., from neutral point<br>
734). In an embodiment, switch 721 may be controlled into the second<br>
position in the parking state, for example, in order to interconnect system 700<br>
with external load 792 via junction box 712, and to enable system 700 to<br>
provide the charging function, the utility-interconnected active power<br>
generator function, the utility-interconnected reactive power generator<br>
function, and/or the utility-interconnected active power filter function.<br>
[00100]	FIG. 8 is a flowchart of a method for operating a power<br>
processing system of a plug-in electric vehicle, in accordance with an example<br>
embodiment. The method of FIG. 8 may be implemented, for example, using<br>
any previously described embodiment of a power processing system that<br>
includes at least one DC energy source (e.g., a battery), at least one AC<br>
electric motor, and at least one bi-directional inverter system.<br>
[00101]	It is to be understood that the first time period, second time<br>
period, and third time period referred to below are intended to indicate non-<br>
overlapping time periods, but are not intended to indicate any sequence of the<br>
processes with which they are described. More particularly, although the<br>
process blocks of FIG. 8 are shown to occur in a particular example sequence<br>
and only one iteration of each process block is shown to occur, it is to be<br><br>
understood that the process blocks may occur in other sequences and/or<br>
multiple iterations or no iterations of a process block may occur during a time<br>
period. In practice, the processes associated with blocks 802, 804, and 806<br>
may be implemented as a state machine, and transitions between any two<br>
states may occur at various times. However, for purposes of simplicity, the<br>
processes associated with blocks 802, 804, 806 are illustrated and described in<br>
the form of a flowchart.<br>
[00102]	The method may begin in step 802, when the vehicle is in a<br>
propulsion state (e.g., during a first time period when the vehicle is<br>
disconnected from any electric utility or external load). While in the<br>
propulsion state, the AC electric motor(s) and bi-directional inverter system of<br>
the power processing system may be utilized to provide a drive function,<br>
according to an embodiment. To provide the drive function, the system causes<br>
the bi-directional inverter system to draw direct DC electrical power from a<br>
DC energy source in response to receiving first control signals, to convert the<br>
DC power to AC power, and to provide the AC power to the at least one AC<br>
electric motor in order to propel the vehicle.<br>
[00103]	Step 804 may occur when the vehicle is in a parking state<br>
(e.g., at times the vehicle is connected with an electric utility) and a charging<br>
mode (e.g., during a second time period). While in the parking state and the<br>
charging mode, the windings of non-spinning AC electric motor(s) and bi-<br>
directional inverter system of the power processing system may be utilized to<br>
provide a charging function, according to an embodiment. To provide the<br>
charging function, the system causes the bi-directional inverter system to draw<br>
AC power from the windings of the AC electric motor(s) in response to<br>
receiving second control signals, to convert the AC power to DC power, and<br>
to provide the DC power to the DC energy source in order to recharge the DC<br>
energy source.<br>
[00104]	Step 806 may occur when the vehicle is in a parking state<br>
(e.g., at times the vehicle is connected with an electric utility) and a power<br>
processing mode (e.g., during a third time period). While in the parking state<br><br>
and the power processing mode, the windings of non-spinning AC electric<br>
motor(s) and bi-directional inverter system of the power processing system<br>
may be utilized to provide one or more power processing functions, according<br>
to an embodiment. As described in detail, previously, the power processing<br>
functions may include, but are not limited to, any one or more of an AC power<br>
source function, a utility-interconnected active power generator function, a<br>
utility-interconnected reactive power generator function, and/or a utility-<br>
interconnected active power filter function. To provide the power processing<br>
functions, the system causes the bi-directional inverter system to draw DC<br>
power from the DC energy source in response to receiving third control<br>
signals, to convert the DC power to AC power, and to provide the AC power<br>
to the windings at least one AC electric motor in order to provide AC power to<br>
an external load. In addition, to more specifically provide the utility-<br>
interconnected reactive power generator function, the system causes the bi-<br>
directional inverter system, during half of an electrical cycle, to draw AC<br>
power from the external load via the AC electric motor(s), to convert the AC<br>
power to DC power, and to provide the DC power to the DC energy source.<br>
[00105]	Thus, various embodiments of power processing systems<br>
and methods for use with plug-in electric vehicles have been described above.<br>
The embodiments may have one or more advantages over traditional systems<br>
in which a plug-in electric vehicle includes a battery charger. For example, an<br>
advantage may be that available system components (e.g., one or more<br>
inverters, DC bus capacitors, and motor windings) may be used the propulsion<br>
state to selectively apply drive power to the vehicle's traction system, and in<br>
the parking state to provide functions associated with a charging mode and/or<br>
a power processing mode. Accordingly, the function of a separate battery<br>
charger may not be needed, and such a battery charger may be excluded from<br>
the system. This may result in decreased vehicle weight (and thus extended<br>
driving range for a given battery charge) and decreased vehicle manufacturing<br>
cost. In addition, the space that would otherwise be used to house the battery<br>
charger may be used for other purposes or eliminated from the vehicle.<br><br>
[00106]	Another advantage may be a decrease in the operational<br>
expense of the vehicle to the consumer. For example, according to various<br>
embodiments, battery (or other DC energy source) charging function may be<br>
controlled by the system to occur during non-peak usage time periods, rather<br>
than during peak usage time periods. Accordingly, the consumer may be<br>
charged decreased utility fees from the utility company. In addition, unlike<br>
traditional battery chargers that enable current to flow in only one direction<br>
(e.g., from the electric utility to the vehicle's battery), embodiments described<br>
above are bi-directional, in that they enable current to flow from the electric<br>
utility to the vehicle's battery (or other DC energy source) during some time<br>
periods, and they enable current to flow from the vehicle's battery (or other<br>
DC energy source) to the electric utility during other time periods.<br>
Accordingly, power may be provided both from the electric utility to the<br>
vehicle and from the vehicle to the electric utility. In some cases, a utility<br>
company may provide the consumer with refunds or credits when the vehicle<br>
functions to the benefit of the utility company (e.g., by providing a utility-<br>
interconnected active power generator function, a utility-interconnected<br>
reactive power generator function, and/or a utility-interconnected active power<br>
filter function).<br>
