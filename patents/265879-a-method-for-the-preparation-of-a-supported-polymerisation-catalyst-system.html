				<td>The present invention relates to a method  for the preparation of a supported polymerisation catalyst system.<br>
The present invention relates to supported catalysts suitable for the polymerisation of olefins and in particular to supported metallocene catalysts providing advantages for operation in gas phase processes for the polymerisation of ethylene or the copolymerisation of ethylene and α-olefins having from 3 to 10 carbon atoms.<br>
In recent years there have been many advances in the production of polyolefin homopolymers and copolymers due to the introduction of metallocene catalysts. Metallocene catalysts offer the advantage of generally a higher activity than traditional Ziegler catalysts and are usually described as catalysts which are single site in nature. There have been developed several different families of metallocene complexes. In earlier years catalysts based on bis (cyclopentadienyl) metal complexes were developed, examples of which may be found in EP 129368 of-EP 206794. More recently complexes having a single or mono cyclopentadienyl ring have been developed. Such complexes have been referred to as 'constrained geometry' complexes and examples of these complexes may be found in EP 416815 or EP 420436. In both of these complexes the metal atom eg. zirconium is in the highest oxidation state.<br>
Other complexes.however have been developed in which the metal atom may be in a reduced oxidation state. Examples of both the bis (cyclopentadienyl) and mono (cyclopentadienyl) complexes have been described in WO 96/04290 and WO 95/00526 respectively.<br>
The above metallocene complexes are utilised for polymerisation in the presence of a cocatalyst or activator. Typically activators are aluminoxanes, in particular methyl alumindxane or alternatively may be compounds based on boron compounds. Examples of the latter are borates such as trialkyl-substituted ammonium tetraphenyl- or<br>
tetrafluorophenyl-borates or triarylboranes such as tris(pentafluorophenyl) borane. Catalyst systems incorporating borate activators are described in EP 561479, EP 418044 and EP 551277.<br>
The above metallocene complexes may be used for the polymerisation of olefins in solution, slurry or gas phase. When used in the slurry or gas phase the metallocene complex and/or the activator are suitably supported. Typical supports include inorganic oxides eg. silica or polymeric supports may alternatively be used.<br>
Examples of the preparation of supported metallocene catalysts for the polymerisation of olefins may be found in WO 94/26793, WO 95/07939, WO 96/00245, WO 96/04318, WO 97/02297 and EP 642536.<br>
WO 98/27119 describes supported catalyst components comprising ionic compounds comprising a cation and an anion in which the anion contains at least one substituent comprising a moiety having an active hydrogen. Jn this disclosure supported metallocene catalysts are exemplified in which the catalyst is prepared by treating the aforementioned ionic compound with a trialkylaluminium compound followed by subsequent treatment with the support and the metallocene.<br>
WO 98/271 19 also describes a method for activating a substantially inactive catalyst precursor comprising (a) an ionic compound comprising a cation and an anion containing at least one substituent comprising a moiety having an active hydrogen, (b) a +transition metal compound and optionally, (c) a support by treatment with an organometallic compound thereby forming an active catalyst.<br>
Various methods have been utilised to prepare supported catalysts of this type. For example WO 98/27119 describes several methods of preparing the supported catalysts disclosed therein in which the support is impregnated with the ionic compound. The volume of the ionic compound may correspond from 20 volume percent to greater than 200 volume percent of the total pore volume of the support. In a preferred preparative route the volume of the solution of the ionic compound does not exceed substantially, and is preferably equal to, the total pore volume of the support. Such methods of preparation may be referred to as incipient precipitation or incipient wetness techniques.<br>
US 6458904 describes the preparation of supported metallocene catalysts by contacting a metallocene complex with an alk-1-ene followed by reaction of this mixture with an ionic compound followed by addition to a support material.<br>
US 6225423 describes the reaction product of a transition metal compound with an unsaturated organic compound such as 1-hexene and wherein the reaction product is then contacted in a suitable solvent with a carrier material.<br>
US 5912202 describes the contact between a single site catalyst precursor with an activating cocatalyst before, during or after contact of the single site precursor with a weakly coordinating electron donor that does not substantially polymerise during the contacting stage.<br>
Macromolecular Rapid Communications 1998, 19. 505 - 509 describes the preparation of a number of silica supported metallocene catalysts. Exemplified systems described the addition of a metallocene/ 1-hexene solution to a silica supported aluminoxane or the addition of a metallocene to silica supported aluminoxane followed by addition of 1-hexene.<br>
More recently Macromolecular Rapid Communications 2001, 22, 1427-1431 described the preparation of supported metallocene catalysts by impregnating up to the pore volume of a silica support with a premixed 1-hexene solution of co- and pro-catalysts. Exemplified systems were silica supported bis(cyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride/methyl aluminoxane for slurry polymerisation. Such systems however showed no long term storage stability and after a few days were inactive for polymerisations.<br>
In both these latter prior art references the addition of the 1-hexene is either after both the polymerisation catalyst (eg. metallocene) and cocatalyst (aluminoxane) have been added to the support or wherein the polymerisation catalyst and cocatalyst are contacted simultaneously with the 1-hexene and the support.<br>
We have now surprisingly found that the addition of a polymerisable monomer to the support prior to contact with one or both of the polymerisation catalyst and the cocatalyst results in an improved supported catalyst system which has improved activity and which is stable over extended periods of time.<br>
Thus according to the present invention there is provided a method for the preparation of a supported polymerisation catalyst system said method comprising the combination of<br>
(i)        a porous support<br>
(ii)       a polymerisable monomer,<br>

Prior to its use the support material may be subjected to treatment at 100°C to 1000°C and preferably at 200 to 850°C in an inert atmosphere under reduced pressure.<br>
The porous supports are preferably pretreated with an organometallic compound preferably an organoaluminium compound and most preferably a trialkylaluminium compound in a dilute solvent.<br>

Alternatively a combination of one or more monomers may be used for example ethylene/1 -hexene.<br>
The preferred polymerisable monomer for use in the present invention is 1-hexene.<br>
The polymerisable monomer is suitably used in liquid form or alternatively may be used in a suitable solvent.<br>
When using a liquid monomer it may be advantageous that the catalyst components be optionally present in a solution of the polymerisable monomer for example when using 1-hexene as solvent.<br>
The polymerisable monomer and polymerisation catalyst are typically used in a ratio of 1:1 to 250:1 and most preferably in the ratio 20:1 to 80:1.<br>
The polymerisation catalyst component according to the present invention may suitably be any polymerisation catalyst used in conjunction with a porous support in the present of a suitable cocatalyst.<br>

tri (p-tolyl)(hydroxyphenyl) borate<br>
tris (pentafluorophenyl)(hydroxyphenyl) borate<br>
	tris (pentafluorophenyl)(4-hydroxyphenyl) borate<br>
Examples of suitable cations for this type of cocatalyst include triethylammonium, triisopropylammonium, diethylmethylammonium, dibutylethylammonium and similar.<br>
Particularly suitable are those cations having longer alkyl chains such as       dihexyldecylmethylammonium, dioctadecylmethylammonium,<br>
ditetradecylmethylammonium, bis(hydrogentated tallow alkyl) methylammonium and similar.<br>
Particular preferred cocatalysts of this type are alkylammonium tris(pentafluorophenyl) 4-(hydroxyphenyl) borates. A particularly preferred cocatalyst is bis(hydrogenated tallow alkyl) methyl ammonium tris (pentafluorophenyl) (4-hydroxyphenyl) borate.<br>
With respect to this type of cocatalyst, a preferred compound is the reaction product of an alkylammonium tris(peritaflurophenyI)-4-(hydroxyphenyl) borate and an organometallic compound, for example triethyialuminium.<br>
The preferred metal with respect to the organometallic compound is aluminium and the preferred metal for the ionic activator is boron whereby the molar ratio of Al/B is less than 2 and is preferably less than 1 and most preferably in the range 0.3 to 0.8.<br>
In a preferred method according to the present invention the molar ratio of metaJlocene complex to cocatalyst employed in the method of the present invention may be in the range 1:10000 to 100:1. A preferred range is from 1:5000 to 10:1 and most preferred from 1:10 to 10:1.<br>
It is advantageous in this method of the present invention that the ionic compound is dried before contact with the organometallic compound. This enables<br>
lower ratios of organometallic compound to the ionic compound to be used without any detrimental effects on activity.<br>
The supported catalyst systems of the present invention are most suitable for operation in processes which typically employ supported polymerisation catalysts.<br>
The supported catalysts of the present invention may be suitable for the polymerisation of olefin monomers selected from (a) ethylene, (b) propylene (c) mixtures of ethylene and propylene and (d) mixtures of (a), (b) or (c) with one or more other alpha-olefms.<br>
Thus according to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for the polymerisation of olefin monomers selected from (a) ethylene, (b) propylene (c) mixtures of ethylene and propylene and (d) mixtures of (a), (b) or (c) with one or more other alpha-olefins, said process performed in the presence of a supported polymerisation catalyst system as hereinbefore described.<br>
The supported systems of the present invention are however most suitable for use in slurry or gas phase processes.<br>
A slurry process typically uses an inert hydrocarbon diluent and temperatures from about 0°C up to a temperature just below the temperature at which the resulting polymer becomes substantially soluble in the inert polymerisation medium. Suitable diluents include toluene or alkanes such as hexane, propane or isobutane.  Preferred temperatures are from about 30°C up to about 200°C but preferably from about 60°C to 100 C. Loop reactors are widely used in slurry polymerisation processes.<br>
Gas phase processes for the polymerisation of olefins, especially for the homopolymerisation and the copolymerisation of ethylene and α-olefins for example 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-l-pentene are well known in the art.<br>
Typical operating conditions for the gas phase are from 20°C to 100°C and most preferably from 40°C to 85°C with pressures from subatmospheric to 100 bar.<br>
Particularly preferred gas phase processes are those operating in a fluidised bed. Examples of such processes are described in EP 89691 and EP 699213 the latter being a particularly preferred process for use with the supported catalysts of the present invention.<br>
Particularly preferred polymerisation processes are those comprising the polymerisation of ethylene or the copolymerisation of ethylene and a-olefins having from 3 to 10 carbon atoms.<br>
Thus according to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for the polymerisation of ethylene or the copolymerisation of ethylene and a-olefins having from 3 to 10 carbon atoms, said process performed under polymerisation conditions in the present of a supported catalyst system prepared as hereinbefore described.<br>
The preferred a-olefins are 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-l-pentene and 1-octene.<br>
The supported catalysts prepared according to the present invention may also be suitable for the preparation of other polymers for example polypropylene, polystyrene, etc.<br>
By use of the method of the present invention a free flowing powder is produced which typically may have a similar particle size to the starting porous support material. The resultant supported catalysts are stable at room temperature over extended periods of time and exhibit a less deactivating kinetic profile than similar catalysts prepared without the incorporation of a polymerisable monomer.<br>
It is also an advantage of the method of the present invention that supported catalysts may be suitably prepared in a one-pot procedure ie. a preparation carried out without the need for washing steps and typically wherein the contact between the support material, cocatalyst, polymerisation catajyst and monomer is performed in a single reaction vessel.<br>

The catalysts from Examples 2 and 3 were tested for ethylene - 1-hexene<br>
copolymerisation as follows:<br>
A 2.5 1 double jacketed thermostatic stainless steel autoclave was purged with nitrogen<br>
at 70°C for at least one hour. 150g of PE pellets previously dried under vacuum at 80°C for 12 hours were introduced and the reactor was then purged three times with nitrogen (7 bar to atmospheric pressure). ~0.13 g of TEA treated silica (1.5 mmol TEA/g) was added under pressure and allowed to scavenge impurities for at least 15 minutes under agitation. The gas phase was then composed (addition of ethylene, 1-hexene and hydrogen) and a mixture of supported catalyst (~0.1 g) and silica/TEA (~0.1 g) was injected. A constant pressure of ethylene and a constant pressure ratio of ethylene/co-monomer were maintained during the run. The run was terminated by venting the reactor and then purging the reactor 3 times with nitrogen. The PE powder produced during the run was then separated from the PE seed bed by simple sieving. Typical conditions are as follows: Temperature: 70°C Ethylene pressure: 6.5 b<br>
