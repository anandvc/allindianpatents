"Cross Reference Statement<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. -60/553,906, filed March 17, 2004. For purposes of United States patent practice, the contents of this provisional application are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
►	The present invention relates to compositions for polymerizing one or more monomers or<br>
mixtures of monomers such as ethylene and one or more comonomers, to form an interpolymer product having unique physical properties, to a process for preparing such interpclymers, and to the resulting polymer products. In another aspect, the invention relates to methods of using these polymers in applications requiring unique combinations of physical properties. In still another aspect, the invention relates to the articles prepared from these polymers.  The inventive polymers comprise two or more differing regions or segments (blocks) causing the polymer to possess unique physical properties. These multi-block copolymers and polymeric blends comprising the same are usefully employed in the preparation of solid articles such as moldings, films, sheets, and foamed objects by molding, extruding, or other processes, and are useful as components or ingredients in adhesives, laminates, polymeric blends, and other end uses. The resulting products are used in the manufacture of components for automobiles, such as profiles, bumpers and trim parts; packaging materials; electric cable insulation, and other applications.<br>
It has long been known that polymers containing a block-type structure often have superior properties compared to random copolymers and blends. For example, triblock copolymers of styrene and butadiene (SBS) and hydrogenated versions of the same (SEBS) have an excellent combination of heat resistance and elasticity. Other block copolymers are also known in the art. Generally, block copolymers known as thermoplastic elastomers (TPE) have desirable properties due to the presence of "soft" or eiastomeric block segments connecting "hard" either crystallizable or glassy blocks in the same polymer. At temperatures up to the melt temperature or glass transition temperature of the hard segments, the polymers demonstrate eiastomeric character. At higher temperatures, the polymers become flowable, exhibiting thermoplastic behavior. Known methods of preparing block copolymers include anionic polymerization and controlled free radical polymerization. Unfortunately, these methods of preparing block copolymers require sequential monomer addition and batch processing and the types of monomers that can be usefully employed in such methods are relatively limited. For example, in the anionic polymerization of styrene and<br><br>
butadiene to form a SBS type block copolymer, each polymer chain requires a stoichiometric amount of initiator and the resulting polymers have extremely narrow molecular weight distribution, Mw/Mn, preferably from 1.0 to 1.3. Additionally, anionic and free-radical processes are relatively slow, resulting in poor process economics.<br>
Irwould be desirable to produce block copolymers catalytically, that is, in a process wherein more than one polymer molecule is produced for each catalyst or initiator molecule. In addition, ft would be highly desirable to produce block copolymers from olefin monomers such as ethylene, propylene, and higher alpha-olefins that are generally unsuited for use in anionic or free-radical polymerizations. In certain of these polymers, it is highly desirable that some or all of the polymer blocks comprise amorphous polymers such as a copolymer of ethylene and a comonomer, especially amorphous random copolymers comprising ethylene and an a-olefin having 3, and especially 4, or more carbon atoms. Finally, if would be highly desirable to be able to use a continuous process for production of block copolymers.<br>
Previous researchers have stated that certain homogeneous coordination polymerization catalysts can be used to prepare polymers having a substantially "block-like" structure by suppressing chain-transfer during the polymerization, for example, by conducting the polymerization process in the absence of a chain transfer agent and at a sufficiently low temperature such that chain transfer by P-hydride elimination or other chain transfer processes is essentially eliminated. Under such conditions, the sequential addition of different monomers was said to result in formation of polymers having sequences or segments of different monomer content. Several examples of such catalyst compositions and processes are reviewed by Coates, Hustad, and Reinartz in Angew. Chern.. Int. Ed., 41, 2236-2257 (2002) as well as US-A-2003/0114623.<br>
Disadvantageously, such processes require sequential monomer addition and result in the production of only one polymer chain per active catalyst center, which limits catalyst productivity. In addition, the requirement of relatively low process temperatures increases the process operating costs, making such processes unsuited for commercial implementation. Moreover, the catalyst cannot be optimized for formation of each respective polymer type, and therefore the entire process results in production of polymer blocks or segments of less than maximal efficiency and/or quality. For example, formation of a certain quantity of prematurely terminated polymer is generally unavoidable, resulting in the forming of blends having inferior polymer properties. Accordingly, under normal operating conditions, for sequentially prepared block copolymers having Mw/Mn of 1.5 or greater, the resulting distribution of block lengths is relatively inhomogeneous, not a most probable distribution. Finally, sequentially prepared block copolymers must be prepared in a batch process, limiting rates and increasing costs with respect to polymerization reactions carried out in a continuous process.<br><br>
FOT these reasons, it would be highly desirable to provide a process for producing olefin copolymers in well defined blocks or segments in a process using coordination polymerization catalysts capable of operation at high catalytic efficiencies. In addition, it would be desirable to provide a process and resulting block or segmented copolymers wherein insertion of terminal blocks or sequencing of blocks within the polymer can be influenced by appropriate selection of process conditions. Finally, it would be desirable to provide a continuous process for producing multi-block copolymers.<br>
The use of certain metal alkyl compounds and other compounds, such as hydrogen, as chain transfer agents to interrupt chain growth in olefin polymerizations is well known in the art. In addition, it is known to employ such compounds, especially aluminum alkyl compounds, as scavengers or as cocatalysts in olefin polymerizations. In Macromolecules. 33, 9192-9199 (2000) the use of certain aluminum trialkyl compounds as chain transfer agents in combination with certain paired zirconocene catalyst compositions resulted in polypropylene mixtures containing small quantities of polymer fractions containing both isotactic and atactic chain segments. In Liu and Rytter, Macromolecular Rapid Comm.. 22, 952-956 (2001) and Bruaseth and Rytter, Macromolecules, 36, 3026-3034 (2003) mixtures of ethylene and 1-hexene were polymerized by a similar catalyst composition containing trimethylaluminum chain transfer agent. In the latter reference, die authors summarized the prior art studies m the following manner (some citations omitted):<br>
"Mixing of two metallocenes with known polymerization behavior can be used to control polymer microstructure. Several studies have been performed of ethene polymerization by mixing two metallocenes. Common observations were that, by combining catalysts which separately give polyethene with different Afw, polyethene with broader and in some cases bimodal MWD can be obtained. [SJoares and Kim (J. Polvm. Sci. . Part A: Polym. Chenu 38, 1408-1432 (2000)) developed a criterion in order to test the MWD bimodality of polymers made by dual single-site catalysts, as exemplified by ethene/1-hexene copolymerization of the mixtures Et(Ind)2ZrCl2/Cp2HfCl2 and Et(Ind)2ZrCl2/ CGC (constrained geometry catalyst) supported on silica. Heiland and Kaminsky fMakromol. Chem.. 193, 601-610 (1992)) studied a mixture of Et-(Ind)2ZrCl2 and the hafnium analogue in copolymerization of ethene and 1-butene.<br>
These studies do not contain any indication of interaction between the two different sites, for example, by readsorption of a terminated chain at the alternative site. Such reports have been issued, however, for polymerization of propene. Chien et al. (J. Polvm. Sci. . Part A: Polvm. Chem., 37, 2439-2445 (1999), MakromoL 30, 3447-3458<br><br>
(1997)) studied propene polymerization by homogeneous binary zirconocene catalysts. A blend of isotactic polypropylene (i-PP), atactic polypropylene (a-PP), and a stereoblock fraction (i-PP-6-a-PP) was obtained with a binary system comprising an isospecific and an aspecific precursor with a borate and TEBA as cocatalyst By using a binary mixture of isospecific and syndiospecific zirconocenes, a blend of isotactic polypropylene (i-PP), syndiotactic polypropylene (s-PP), and a stereoblock fraction (i-PP-6-s-PP) was obtained. The mechanism for formation of the stereoblock fraction was proposed to involve the exchange of propagating chains between the two different catalytic sites. Przybyla and Fink (Acta Polynu 50, 77-83 (1999)) used two different types of metallocenes (isospecific and syndiospecific) supported on Hie same silica for propene polymerization. They reported that, with a certain type of silica support, chain transfer between the active species in the catalyst system occurred, and stereoblock PP was obtained. Lieber and Brintzinger (Macromol. 3, 9192-9199 (2000)) have proposed a more detailed explanation of how the transfer of a growing polymer chain from one type of metallocene to another occurs. They studied propene polymerization by catalyst mixtures of two different ansa-zirconocenes. The different catalysts were first studied individually with regard to their tendency toward alkyl-polymeryl exchange with the alkylaluminum activator and then pairwise with respect to their capability to produce polymers with a stereoblock structure. They reported that formation of stereoblock polymers by a mixture of zirconocene catalysts with different stereoselectivities is contingent upon an efficient polymeryl exchange between the Zr catalyst centers and the Al centers of the cocatalyst."<br>
Brusath and Rytter then disclosed their own observations using paired zirconocene catalysts to polymerize mixtures of ethylene/ 1-hexene and reported the effects of the influence of the dual site catalyst on polymerization activity, incorporation of comonomer, and polymer microstructure using methylalumoxane cocatalyst.<br>
Analysis of the foregoing results indicate that Rytter and coworkers likely failed to utilize combinations of catalyst, cocatalyst, and third components that were capable of readsorption of the polymer chain from the chain transfer agent onto both of the active catalytic sites, i.e., two-way readsorption. While indicating that chain termination due to the presence of trimethylalumimim likely occurred with respect to polymer formed from the catalyst incorporating minimal comonomer, and thereafter that polymeryl exchange with the more open catalytic site followed by continued polymerization likely occurred, evidence of the reverse flow of polymer ligands appeared to be lacking in the reference. In fact, in a later communication, Rytter, et. al., Polymer, 45, 7853-<br><br>
7861 (2004), it was reported that no chain transfer between the catalyst sites actually took place in the earlier experiment. Similar polymerizations were reported in WO98/34970.<br>
In USP's 6,380,341 and 6,169,151, use of a "fluxiona!" metallocene catalyst, that is a metallocene capable of relatively facile conversion between two stereoisomeric forms having differing polymerization characteristics such as differing reactivity ratios was said to result in production of olefin copolymers having a "blocky" structure. Disadvantageous!/, the respective stereoisomers of such metallocenes generally fail to possess significant difference in polymer formation properties and are incapable of forming both highly crystalline and amorphous block copolymer segments, for example, from a given monomer mixture under fixed reaction conditions. Moreover, because the relative ratio of the two "fluxional" forms of the catalyst cannot be varied, there is no ability, using "fluxional" catalysts, to vary polymer block composition or the ratio of the respective blocks. Finally, prior art methods for olefin block copolymerization have been incapable of readily controlling the sequencing of the various polymer blocks, and in particular controlling the nature of the terminating block or segment of a multi-block copolymer. For certain applications, it is desirable to produce polymers having terminal blocks that are highly crystalline, that are functionalized or more readily functionalized, or that possess other distinguishing properties. For example, it is believed that polymers wherein the terminal segments or blocks are crystalline or glassy possess improved abrasion resistance and thermal properties such as tensile strength, elastic recovery and compression set. In addition, polymers wherein the blocks having amorphous properties are internal or primarily connected between crystalline or glassy blocks, have unproved elastomeric properties, such as improved retractive force and recovery, particularly at elevated temperatures.<br>
In JACSt 2004, 126, 10701-10712, Gibson, et al discuss the effects of "catalyzed living polymerization" on molecular weight distribution. The authors define catalyzed living polymerization in this manner:<br>
"... if chain transfer to aluminum constitutes the sole transfer mechanism and the exchange of the growing polymer chain between the transition metal and the aluminum centers is very fast and reversible, the polymer chains will appear to be growing on the aluminum centers. This can then reasonably be described as a catalyzed chain growth reaction on aluminum... .An attractive manifestation of this type of chain growth reaction is a Poisson distribution of product molecular weights, as opposed to the Schulz-Flory distribution that arises when P-H transfer accompanies propagation."<br>
The authors reported the results for the catalyzed living homopolymerization of ethylene using an iron containing catalyst in combination with ZnEt2, ZnMe2) or Zn(i-Pr)2. Homoleptic alkyls of aluminum, boron, tin, lithium, magnesium and lead did not induce catalyzed chain growth.<br><br>
Using GaMe3 as cocatalyst resulted in production of a polymer having a narrow molecular weight distribution. However, after analysis of time-dependent product distribution, the authors concluded this reaction was, "not a simple catalyzed chain growth reaction." The reference fails to disclose the use of two or more catalysts in combination with a chain shuttling agent to make multi-block copolymers. Similar processes employing single catalysts have been described in USP's 5,210,338, 5,276,220, and 6,444,867.<br>
Earlier workers have claimed to have formed block copolymers using a single Ziegler-Natta type catalyst in multiple reactors arranged in series, see for example USP's 3,970,719 and 4,039,632. Additional Ziegler-Natta based processes and polymers are disclosed in USP's 4,971,936; 5,089,573; 5,118,767; 5,118,768; 5,134,209; 5,229,477; 5,270,276; 5,270,410; 5,294,581; 5,543,458; 5,550,194; and 5,693,713, as well as inEP-A-470,171 andEP-A-500,530.<br>
Despite the advances by the foregoing researchers, there remains a need in the art for a polymerization process that is capable of preparing block like copolymers, especially multi-block copolymers, and most especially linear multi-block copolymers, in high yield and selectivity. Moreover, it would be desirable if there were provided an improved process for preparing multi-block copolymers, especially linear multi-block copolymers, of two or more olefin monomers such as ethylene and one or more comonomers, by the use of a shuttling agent. In addition it would be desirable to provide such an improved process that is capable of preparing multi-block copolymers, especially linear multi-block copolymers, having a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution. It would further be desirable to provide an improved process for preparing copolymers having more than two segments or blocks. Furthermore, it would be desirable to provide a process for identifying combinations of catalysts and chain shuttling agents capable of making such multi-block copolymers. Even further, it would be desirable to provide a process for independent control of the order of the various polymer blocks, especially a process for preparing olefin block copolymers containing terminal blocks having high crystallinity and/or functionality. Finally, it would be desirable to provide an improved process for preparing any of the foregoing desirable polymer products in a continuous process, without required sequential addition of monomers. Highly desirably, such process allows for independent control of the quantity and/or identity of the shuttling agent(s) and/or catalysts used.<br>

In a preferred embodiment, the blocks differ in the amount or type of comonomer incorporated therein, the density, the amount of crystallinity, the crystallite size attributable to a polymer of such composition, the type or degree of tacticity (isotactic or syndiotactic), regio-<br><br>
regularity or regio-irregularity, the amount of branching, including long chain branching or hyper-branching, the homogeneity, or any other chemical or physical property. Compared to block ■ copolymers of the prior art, including copolymers produced by sequential monomer addition, fluxional catalysts, or anionic polymerization techniques, the copolymers of the invention are characterized by unique distributions of both polymer polydispersity (PDI or Mw/Mn), block length distribution, and/or block number distribution, due, in a preferred embodiment, to the effect of the shuttling agent(s) in combination with multiple catalysts. More specifically, when produced in a continuous process, the polymers desirably possess PDI from 1.7 to 2.9, preferably from 1.8 to 2.5, more preferably from 1.8 to 2.2, and most preferably from 1.8 to 2.1. When produced in a batch or semi-batch process, the polymers desirably possess PDI from 1.0 to 2.9, preferably from 1.3 to 2.5, more preferably from 1.4 to 2.0, and most preferably from 1.4 to 1.8.<br>
The term "ethylene multi-block copolymer" means a multi-block copolymer comprising ethylene and one or more copolymerizable comonomers, wherein ethylene comprises a plurality of the polymerized monomer units of at least one block or segment in the polymer, preferably at least 90 mole percent, more preferably at least 95 mole percent, and most preferably at least 98 mole percent of said block. Based on total polymer weight, the ethylene multi-block copolymers of the present invention preferably have an ethylene content from 25 to 97 percent, more preferably from 40 to 96 percent,-even more preferably from 55 to 95 percent, and most preferably from 65 to 85 percent.<br>
Because the respective distinguishable segments or blocks formed from two of more monomers are joined into single polymer chains, the polymer cannot be completely fractionated using standard selective extraction techniques. For example, polymers containing regions that are relatively crystalline (high density segments) and regions that are relatively amorphous (lower density segments) cannot be selectively extracted or fractionated using differing solvents. In a preferred embodiment the quantity of extractable polymer using either a dialkyl ether- or an alkane-solvent is less than 10 percent, preferably less than 7 percent, more preferably less than 5 percent and most preferably less than 2 percent of the total polymer weight.<br>
In addition, the multi-block copolymers of the invention desirably possess a PDI Fitting a Schutz-Flory distribution rather than a Poisson distribution. The use of the present polymerization process results in a product having both a polydisperse block distribution as well as a polydisperse distribution of block sizes. This ultimates in the formation of polymer products having improved and distinguishable physical properties. The theoretical benefits of a polydisperse block distribution have been previously modeled and discussed in Potemkin, Physical Review E (1998) 57(6), p. 6902-6912, and Dobrynin, J. Chem. Phvs. (1997) 107(21), p 9234-9238.<br><br>
In a further embodiment, the polymers of the invention, especially those made in a continuous, solution polymerization reactor, possess a most probable distribution of block lengths. Most preferred polymers according to the invention are multi-block copolymers containing 4 or more blocks or segments including terminal blocks.<br>
The following mathematical treatment of the resulting polymers is based on theoretically derived parameters that are believed to apply to the present invented polymers and demonstrate that, especially in a steady-state, continuous, well-mixed reactor, the block lengths of the resulting polymer prepared using 2 or more catalysts will each conform to a most probable distribution, derived in the following manner, wherein pj is the probability of propagation with respect to block sequences from catalyst i. The theoretical treatment is based on standard assumptions and methods known in the art and used in predicting the effects of polymerization kinetics on molecular architecture, including the use of mass action reaction rate expressions that are not affected by chain or block lengths. Such methods have been previously disclosed in W. H. Ray, J. Macromol. Sci.., Rev. Macromol. Chem.. C8, 1 (1972) and A. E. Hamielec and J. F. MacGregor, "Polymer Reaction Engineering", K.H. Reichert and W. Geisler, Eds., Hanser, Munich, 1983, In addition it is assumed that adjacent sequences formed by the same catalyst form a single block. For catalyst i, the fraction of sequences of length n is given by Xj[n], where n is an integer from 1 to infinity representing the number of monomer units in the block.<br><br>
Each catalyst has a probability of propagation (pO and forms a polymer segment having a unique average block length and distribution. In a most preferred embodiment, the probability of propagation is defined as:<br><br>
Rp[i] = Rate of monomer consumption by catalyst i, (znoles/L),<br>
Rt[i] = Total rate of chain transfer and termination for catalyst is (moles/L),<br>
Rs[i] = Rate of chain shuttling with dormant polymer to other catalysts, (moies/L), and<br>
[Q]      = Concentration of catalyst i (moles/L).<br>
Dormant polymer chains refers to polymer chains that are attached to a CSA.<br>
The overall monomer consumption or polymer propagation rate, Rp[i], is defined using an<br>
apparent rate constant, kpj, multiplied by a total monomer concentration, [M], as follows:<br><br><br>
The total chain transfer rate is given below including values for chain transfer to hydrogen (H2), beta hydride elimination, and chain transfer to chain shuttling agent (CSA). The reactor residence time is given by 0 and each subscripted k value is a rate constant<br><br>
For a dual catalyst system, the rate of chain shuttling of polymer between catalysts 1 and 2 is given as follows:<br><br>
If more than 2 catalysts are employed then added terms and complexity in the theoretical relation for Rs[i] result, but the ultimate conclusion that the resulting block length distributions are most probable is unaffected.<br>
As used herein with respect to a chemical compound, unless specifically indicated otherwise, the singular includes all isomeric forms and vice versa (for example, "hexane", includes all isomers of hexane individually or collectively). The terms "compound" and "complex" are used interchangeably herein to refer to organic-, inorganic- and organometal compounds. The term, "atom" refers to the smallest constituent of an element regardless of ionic state, that is, whether or not the same bears a charge or partial charge or is bonded to another atom. The term "heteroatom" refers to an atom other than carbon or hydrogen. Preferred heteroatoms include: F, CI, Br, N, O, P, B, S, Si, Sb, Al, Sn, As, Se and Ge.<br>
The term, "hydrocarbyl" refers to univalent substituents containing only hydrogen and carbon atoms, including branched or unbranched, saturated or unsaturated, cyclic, polycyclic or noncyclic species. Examples include alkyl-, cycloalkyl-, alkenyl-, alkadienyl-, cycloalkenyl-, cycloalkadienyl-, aryl-, and alkynyl- groups. "Substituted hydrocarbyl" refers to a hydrocarbyl group that is substituted with one or more nonhydrocarbyl substituent groups.' The terms, "heteroatom containing hydrocarbyl" or "heterohydrocarbyl" refer to univalent groups in which at least one atom other than hydrogen or carbon is present along with one or more carbon atom and one or more hydrogen atoms. The term "heterocarbyl" refers to groups containing one or more carbon atoms and one or more heteroatoms and no hydrogen atoms. The bond between the carbon atom and any heteroatom as well as the bonds between any two heteroatoms, may be a single or multiple covalent bond or a coordinating or other donative bond. Thus, an alkyl group substituted with a heterocycloalkyl-, aiyl- substituted heterocycloalkyl-, heteroaryl-, alkyl- substituted heteroaryl-, alkoxy-, aryloxy-, dihydrocarbylboryl-, dihydrocarbylphosphino-, dihydrocarbylamino-, trihydrocarbylsilyl-, hydrocarbylthio-, or hydrocarbylseleno- group is within the scope of the term heteroalkyl. Examples of suitable heteroalkyl groups include cyanomethyl-, benzoylmethyl-, (2-pyridyl)methyl-, and trifluoromethyl- groups.<br><br>
As used herein the term "aromatic" refers to a polyatomic, cyclic, conjugated ring system containing (45+2) π-electrons, wherein 5 is an integer greater than or equal to 1. The term "fused" as used herein with respect to a ring system containing two or more polyatomic, cyclic rings means that with respect to at least two rings thereof, at least one pair of adjacent atoms is included in both rings. The term "aryl" refers to a monovalent aromatic substituent which may be a single aromatic ring or multiple, aromatic rings which are fosed together, linked covalently, or linked to a common group such as a methylene or ethylene moiety. Examples of aromatic ring(s) include phenyl, naphthyl, anthracenyl, and biphenyl, among others.<br>
"Substituted aryl" refers to an aryl group in which one or more hydrogen atoms bound to any carbon is replaced by one or more functional groups such as alkyl, substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, substituted heterocycloalkyl, halogen, alkylhalos (e.g., CF3), hydroxy, amino, phosphido, alkoxy, amino, thio, nitro, and both saturated and unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons which are fused to the aromatic ring(s), linked covalently or linked to a common group such as a methylene or ethylene moiety. The common linking group may also be a carbonyl as in benzophenone or oxygen as in diphenylether or nitrogen in diphenyiamine. ■<br>
The term, "comonomer incorporation index", refers to the percent comonoiner incorporated into a copolymer prepared under representative ethylene/ comonomer polymerization conditions by the catalyst under consideration in the absence of other polymerization catalysts, ideally under steady-state, continuous solution polymerization conditions in a hydrocarbon diluent at 100 °C, 4,5 MPa ethylene pressure (reactor pressure), greater than 92 (more preferably greater than 95) percent ethylene conversion, and greater than 0.01 percent comonomer conversion. The selection of metal complexes or catalyst compositions having the greatest difference in comonomer incorporation indices results in copolymers from two or more monomers having the largest difference in block or segment properties^ such as density.<br>
In certain circumstances the comonomer incorporation index may be determined directly, for example by the use of NMR spectroscopic techniques. Often, however, any difference in comonomer incorporation must be indirectly determined. For polymers formed from multiple monomers this may be accomplished by various techniques based on monomer reactivities.<br>
For copolymers produced by a given catalyst, the relative amounts of comonomer and monomer in the copolymer and hence the copolymer composition is determined by relative rates of reaction of comonomer and monomer. Mathematically the molar ratio of comonomer to monomer is given by <br><br>
Here Rp2 an&amp;Rpl are the rates of polymerization of comonomer and monomer respectively<br>
and F2 and Fx are the mole fractions of each in the copolymer. Because F1 + F2 = 1 we can rearrange this equation to<br><br>
The individual rates of polymerization of comonomer and monomer are typically complex functions of temperature, catalyst, and monomer/comonomer concentrations. In the limit as comonomer concentration in the reaction media drops to zero, Rp2 drops to zero, F2 becomes zero<br>
and the polymer consists of pure monomer. In the limiting case of no monomer in the reactor Rpl becomes zero and F2 is one (provided the comonomer can polymerize alone).<br>
For most homogeneous catalysts the ratio of comonomer to monomer in the reactor largely determines polymer composition as determined according to either the Terminal Copolymerization Model or the Penultimate Copolymerization Model.<br>
For random copolymers in which the identity of the last monomer inserted dictates the rate at which subsequent monomers inserts the terminal copolymerization model is employed. In this model insertion reactions of the type<br><br>
where C   represents the catalyst, Mi represents monomer z, and kiJ is the rate constant having the rate equation <br>
The comonomer mole fraction (r=2) in the reaction media is defined by the equation:<br>
ri<br>
A simplified equation for comonomer composition can be derived as disclosed in George Odian, Principles of Polymerization, Second Edition, John Wiley and Sons, 1970, as follows:<br><br>
From this equation the mole fraction of comonomer in the polymer is solely dependent on the mole fraction of comonomer in the reaction media and two temperature dependent reactivity ratios defined in terms of the insertion rate constants as:<br><br><br>
Alternatively, in the penultimate copolymerization model, the identities of the last two monomers inserted in the growing polymer chain dictate the rate of subsequent monomer insertion. The polymerization reactions are of the form<br><br>
and the individual rate equations are:<br><br>
The comonomer content can be calculated (again as disclosed in George Odian, Supra.) as:<br><br>
For this model as well the polymer composition is a function only of temperature dependent reactivity ratios and comonomer mole fraction in the reactor. The same' is also true when reverse comonomer or monomer insertion may occur or in the case of the interpolynierization of more than two monomers.<br>
Reactivity ratios for use in the foregoing models may be predicted using well known theoretical techniques or empirically derived from actual polymerization data. Suitable theoretical techniques are disclosed, for example, in B. G. Kyle, Chemical and Process Thermodynamics, Third Addition, Prentice-Hall, 1999 and in Redlich-Kwong-Soave (RKS) Equation of State, Chemical Engineering Science, 1972, pp 1197-1203. Commercially available software programs may be used to assist in deriving reactivity ratios from experimentally derived data. One example of such software is Aspen Plus from Aspen Technology, Inc., Ten Canal Park, Cambridge, MA 02141-2201 USA.<br>

Chain shuttling agents<br>
The term, "shuttling agent" refers to a compound or mixture of compounds employed in the composition of the present invention that is capable of causing polymeryl exchange between at least two active catalyst sites of the catalysts included in the composition under the conditions of the polymerization. That is, transfer of a polymer fragment occurs both to and from one or more of the active catalyst sites. In contrast to a shuttling agent, a "chain transfer agent" causes termination of polymer chain growth and amounts to a one-time transfer of growing polymer from the catalyst to the transfer agent. Preferably, the shuttling agent has an activity ratio RA_B/RB-A of from 0.01 and 100, more preferably from 0.1 to 10, most preferably from 0.5 to 2.0, and most highly preferably from 0.8 to 1.2, wherein RA_B is the rate of polymeryl transfer from catalyst A active site to catalyst<br><br>
B active site via the shuttling agent, and RB.A is the rate of reverse polymeryl transfer, i.e., the rate of exchange starting from the catalyst B active site to catalyst A active site via the shuttling agent. Desirably, the intermediate formed between the shuttling agent and the polymeryl chain is sufficiently stable that chain termination is relatively rare. Desirably, less than 90 percent, preferably less than 75 percent, more preferably less than 50 percent and most desirably less than 10 percent of shuttle-polymeryl products are terminated prior to attaining 3 distinguishable polymer segments or blocks. Ideally, the rate of chain shuttling (defined by the time required to transfer a polymer chain from a catalyst site to the chain shuttling agent and then back to a catalyst site) is equivalent to or faster than the rate of polymer termination, even up to 10 or even 100 times faster than the rate of polymer termination. This permits polymer block formation on the same time scale as polymer propagation.<br>
By selecting different combinations of catalysts having differing comonomer incorporation rates as well as differing reactivities, and by pairing various shuttling agents or mixtures of agents with these catalyst combinations, polymer products having segments of different densities or comonomer concentrations, different block lengths, and different numbers of such segments or blocks in each copolymer can be prepared. For example, if the activity of the shuttling agent is low relative to the catalyst polymer chain propagation rate of one or more of the catalysts, longer block length multi-block copolymers and polymer blends may be obtained. Contrariwise, if shuttling is very fast relative to polymer chain propagation, a copolymer having a more random chain structure and shorter block lengths is obtained. An extremely fast shuttling agent may produce a multi-block copolymer having substantially random copolymer properties. By proper selection of both catalyst mixture and shuttling agent, relatively pure block copolymers, copolymers containing relatively large polymer segments or blocks, and/or blends of the foregoing with various ethylene homopolymers and/or copolymers can be obtained.<br>
A suitable composition comprising Catalyst A, Catalyst B, and a chain shuttling agent can be selected for this invention by the following multi-step procedure specially adapted for block differentiation based on comonomer incorporation:<br>
I. One or more addition polymerizable. preferably olefin monomers are polymerized using a mixture comprising a potential catalyst and a potential chain shuttling agent. This polymerization test is desirably performed using a batch or semi-batch reactor (that is, without resupply of catalyst or shuttling agent), preferably with relatively constant monomer concentration, operating under solution polymerization conditions, typically using a molar ratio of catalyst to chain shuttling agent from 1:5 to 1:500. After forming a suitable quantity of polymer, the reaction is terminated by addition of a catalyst poison and the polymer's properties (Mw, Mn, and Mw/Mn or PDI) measured.<br><br>
II. The foregoing polymerization and polymer testing are repeated for several different reaction times, providing a series of polymers having a range of yields and PDI values.<br>
HI. Catalyst/ shuttling agent pairs demonstrating significant polymer transfer both to and from the shuttling agent are characterized by a polymer series wherein the minimum PDI is less than 2.0, more preferably less than 1.5, and most preferably less than 1.3. Furthermore, if chain shuttling is occurring, the Mn of the polymer will increase, preferably nearly linear ly, as conversion is increased. Most preferred catalyst/ shuttling agent pairs are those giving polymer Mn as a function of conversion (or polymer yield) fitting a line with a statistical precision (R2) of greater than 0.95? preferably greater than 0.99.<br>
Steps I-]H are then carried out for one or more additional pairings of potential catalysts and/or putative shuttling agents.<br>
A suitable composition comprising Catalyst A, Catalyst B, and one or more chain shuttling agents according to the invention is then selected such that the two catalysts each undergo chain shuttling with one or more of the chain shuttling agents, and Catalyst A has a higher comonomer incorporation index (or is otherwise capable of selectively forming polymer) compared to Catalyst B under the reaction conditions chosen. Most preferably, at least one of the chain shuttling agents undergoes polymer transfer in both the forward and reverse directions (as identified in the foregoing test) with both Catalyst A and Catalyst B. In addition, it is preferable that the chain shuttling agent does not reduce the catalyst activity (measured in weight of polymer produced per weight of catalyst per unit time) of either catalyst (compared to activity in the absence of a shuttling agent) by more than 60 percent, more preferably such catalyst activity is not reduced by more than 20 percent, and most preferably catalyst activity of at least one of the catalysts is increased compared to the catalyst activity in the absence of a shuttling agent.<br>
Alternatively, it is also possible to detect desirable catalyst/shuttling agent pairs by performing a series of polymerizations under standard batch reaction conditions and measuring the resulting number average molecular weights, PDI and polymer yield or production rate. Suitable shuttling agents are characterized by lowering of the resultant Mn without significant broadening of PDI or loss of activity (reduction in yield or rate).<br>
The foregoing tests are readily adapted to rapid throughput screening techniques using automated reactors and analytic probes and to formation of polymer blocks having different distinguishing properties. For example, a number of potential shuttling agent candidates can be pre-identified or synthesized in situ by combination of various organometal compounds with various proton sources and the compound or reaction product added to a polymerization reaction employing an olefin polymerization catalyst composition. Several polymerizations are conducted at varying molar ratios of shuttling agent to catalyst. As a minimum requirement, suitable shuttling agents are<br><br>
those that produce a minimum PDI of less than 2.0 in variable yield experiments as described above, while not significantly adversely affecting catalyst activity, and preferably improving catalyst activity, as above described.<br>
Regardless of the method for identifying, a priori, a shuttling agent, the term is meant to refer to a compound that is capable of preparing the presently identified multi-block copolymers or usefully employed under the polymerization conditions herein disclosed. Highly desirably, multi-block copolymers having an average number of blocks or segments per average chain (as defined as the average number of blocks of different composition divided by the Mn of the polymer) greater than 3.0 more preferably greater than 3.5, even more preferably greater than 4.0, and less than 25, preferably less than 15, more preferably less than 10.0, most preferably less than 8.0 are formed according to the invention.<br>
Suitable shuttling agents for use herein include Group 1,2,12 or 13 metal compounds or complexes containing at least one C1-20 hydrocarbyl group, preferably hydrocarbyl substituted aluminum, gallium or zinc compounds containing from 1 to 12 carbons in each hydrocarbyl group, and reaction products thereof with a proton source. Preferred hydrocarbyl groups are alkyl groups, preferably linear or branched, C2-8 alkyl groups. Most preferred shuttling agents for use in the present invention are trialkyl aluminum and dialkyl zinc compounds, especially triethylaluminum, tri(i-propyl) aluminum, tri(i-butyl)aluminum, tri(n-hexyl)aluminum, tri(n-octyl)aluminum, triethylgallium, or diethylzinc. Additional suitable shuttling agents include the reaction product or mixture formed by combining the foregoing organometal compound, preferably a tri(C2_8) alkyl aluminum or di(C1-8) alkyl zinc compound, especially triethylaluminum, tri(i-propyl) aluminum, tri(i-butyl)aluminum, tri(n-hexyl)aluminum, tri(n-octyl)aluminum, or diethylzinc, with less than a stoichiometric quantity (relative to the number of hydrocarbyl groups) of a secondary amine or a hydroxyl compound, especially bis(trimethylsilyl)amine, t-butyl(dimethyl)siloxane, 2-hydroxymethylpyridine, di(n-pentyl)amine, 2,6-di(t-butyl)phe'nol, ethyl(l-naphthyl)amine, bis(2,3,6,7-dibenzo-l-azacycloheptaneamine), or 2,6-diphenylphenol. Desirably, sufficient amine or hydroxyl reagent is used such that one hydrocarbyl group remains per metal atom. The primary reaction products of the foregoing combinations most desired for use in the present invention as shuttling agents are n-octylaluminum di(bis(trimethylsilyl)amide), i-propylaluminum bis(dimethyl(t-butyl)siloxide):, and n-octylaluminum di(pyridinyl-2-methoxide), i-butylaluminum bis(dimethyl(t-butyl)siloxane), i-butylaluminum bis(di(trimethylsilyl)amide), n-octylaluminum di(pyridine-2-methoxide), i-butylaluminum bis(di(n-pentyl)amide), n-octylaluminum bis(2,6-di~t-butylphenoxide), n-octylaluminum di(ethyl(l-naphthyl)amide), ethylaluminum bis(t-butyldimethylsiloxide), ethylaluminum di(bis(trimethylsilyl)amide), ethylaluminum bis(2,3,6,7-dibenzo-1-azacycloheptaneamide), n-octylaluminum bis(2,3,6,7-dibenzo-l-azacycloheptaneamide),<br><br>
n-octylaluminum bis(dimethyl(t»butyl)siloxide, ethylzinc (2,6-diphenylphenoxide), and ethylzinc (t-butoxide).<br>
It will be appreciated by the skilled artisan that a suitable shuttling agent for one catalyst or catalyst combination may not necessarily be as good or even satisfactory for use with a different catalyst or catalyst combination. Some potential shuttling agents may adversely affect the performance of one or more catalysts and may be undesirable for use for that reason as well. Accordingly, the activity of the chain shuttling agent desirably is balanced with fee catalytic activity of the catalysts to achieve the desired polymer properties. In some embodiments of the invention, best results may be obtained by use of shuttling agents having a chain shuttling activity (as measured by a rate of chain transfer) that is less than the maximum possible rate.<br>
Generally however, preferred shuttling agents possess the highest rates of polymer transfer as well as the highest transfer efficiencies (reduced incidences of chain termination). Such shuttling agents may be used in reduced concentrations and still achieve the desired degree of shuttling. In addition, such shuttling agents result in production of the shortest possible polymer block lengths. Highly desirably, chain shuttling agents with a single exchange site are employed due to the fact that the effective molecular weight of the polymer in the reactor is lowered, thereby reducing viscosity of fee reaction mixture and consequently reducing operating costs.<br>
Catalysts<br>
Suitable catalysts for use herein include any compound or combination of compounds that is adapted for preparing polymers of fee desired composition or type.

A most highly preferred metal complex of the foregoing formula is:<br><br>
The foregoing polyvalent Lewis base complexes are conveniently prepared by standard metallation and ligand exchange procedures involving a source of the Group 4 metal and the neutral polyfunctional ligand source. In addition, the complexes may also be prepared by means of an amide elimination and hydrocarbylation process starting from the corresponding Group 4 metal tetraamide and a hydrocarbylating agent, such as trimethylaluminutn. Other techniques may be used as well. These complexes are known from the disclosures of, among others, US patents 6,320,005, 6,103,657, WO 02/38628, WO 03/40195, and US 04/0220050.<br>
Catalysts having high comonomer incorporation properties are also known to reincorporate in situ prepared long chain olefins resulting incidentally during the polymerization through [3-hydride elimination and chain termination of growing polymer, or other process. The concentration of such long chain olefins is particularly enhanced by use of continuous solution polymerization conditions at high conversions, especially ethylene conversions of 95 percent or greater, more preferably at ethylene conversions of 97 percent or greater. Under such conditions a small but detectable quantity of olefin terminated polymer may be reincorporated into a growing polymer chain, resulting in the formation of long chain branches, that is, branches of a carbon length greater than would result from other deliberately added comonomer. Moreover, such chains reflect the<br><br>
presence of other comonomers present in the reaction mixture. That is, the chains may include short chain or long chain branching as well, depending on the comonomer composition of the reaction mixture. Long chain branching of olefin polymers is further described in USP's 5,272,236, 5,278,272, and 5,665,800. In one aspect of the invention, the level of long chain branching in the product is significantly suppressed or eliminated altogether by the use of chain shuttling agents that cause essentiually all of the polymer chains to be terminated with the chain shuttling agent, and not by the formation of vinyl groups which can be reincorporated to form a long chain branch. In this embodiment, the resulting polymer block is highly linear, leading to advantaged properties.<br>
Alternatively, and more preferably, branching, including hyper-branching, may be induced in a particular segment of the present multi-block copolymers by the use of specific catalysts known to result in"chain-walking" in the resulting polymer. For example, certain homogeneous bridged bis indenyl- or partially hydrogenated bis indenyl- zirconium catalysts, disclosed by Kaminski, et at., J. Mol. Catal. A: Chemical 102 (1995) 59-65; Zambelli, efaLMacromolecules. 1988: 21, 617-622; or Dias, et al&gt; J. Mol. Catal. A: Chemical, 185 (2002) 57-64 may be used to prepare branched copolymers from single monomers, including ethylene. Higher transition metal catalysts, especially nickel and palladium catalysts are also known to lead to hyper-branched polymers (the branches of which are also branched) as disclosed in Brookhart, et ai, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 64145-6415.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the presence of such branching (long chain branching, 1,3-addition, or hyper-branching) in the polymers of the invention can be confined to only the blocks or segments resulting from activity of catalyst A. Accordingly, in one embodiment of the invention a multi-block copolymer containing blocks or segments differing in the presence of such brandling in combination with other segments or blocks substantially lacking such branching (especially high density or highly crystalline polymer blocks), can be produced from a single monomer containing reaction mixture, that is, without the addition of a deliberately added comonomer. Highly preferably, in a specific embodiment of the invention, a multi-block copolymer comprising alternating unbranched, ethylene homopolymer segments and branched polyethylene segments, especially ethylene/propylene copolymer segments, may be prepared from an initial reaction mixture consisting essentially of ethylene as the addition polymerizable monomer. The presence of such branching in the multi-block copolymers of the invention can be detected by certain physical properties of the resulting copolymers, such as reduced surface imperfections during melt extrusion (reduced melt fracture), reduced melting point, Tg, for the amorphous segments compared to a non-branched polymer segment, and/or the presence of 1,3-addition sequences or hyper-branching as detected by NMR techniques. The quantity of the foregoing types<br><br>
of branching present in the polymers of the invention (as a portion of the blocks or segments containing the same), is normally in the range from 0.01 to 10 branches per 1,000 carbons.<br>
Suitable metal compounds for use as catalyst (B) include the foregoing metal compounds mentioned with respect to catalyst (A) as well as other metal compounds, with the proviso, in one embodiment of the invention, that they incorporate comonomer relatively poorly compared to catalyst (A).

In a preferred embodiment, the shuttling agent is employed both for purposes of chain shuttling and as the cocatalyst component of the catalyst composition.<br>
The metal complexes desirably are rendered catalytically active by combination with a cation forming cocatalyst, sucli as those previously known in the art for use with Group 4 metal olefin polymerization complexes. Suitable cation forming cocatalysts for use herein include neutral Lewis acids, such as Ci_3o hydrocarbyl substituted Group 13 compounds, especially tri(hydrocarbyl)aluminum- or tri(hydrocarbyl)boron compounds and halogenated (including perhalogenated) derivatives thereof, having from 1 to 10 carbons in each hydrocarbyl or halogenated hydrocarbyl group, more especially perfluorinated tri(aryl)boron compounds, and most especially tris(pentafluoro-phenyl)borane; nonpolymeric, compatible, noncoordinating, ion forming compounds (including the use of such compounds under oxidizing conditions), especially the use of ammonium-, phosphonium-, oxonium-, carbonium-, silylium- or sulfonium- salts of compatible, noncoordinating anions, or ferrocenium-, lead- or silver salts of compatible, noncoordinating anions; and combinations of the foregoing cation forming cocatalysts and techniques. The foregoing activating cocatalysts and activating techniques have been previously taught with respect to different metal complexes for olefin polymerizations in the following references: EP-A-277,003, US-A-5,153,157, US-A-5,064,802, US-A-5,321,106, US-A-5,721,185, US-A-5,350,723, US-A-5,425,872, US-A-5,625,087, US-A-5,883,204, US-A-5,919,983, US-A-5,783,512, WO 99/15534, and W099/42467.<br><br>

Suitable ion forming compounds useful as cocatalysts in one embodiment of the present invention comprise a cation which is a Bronsted acid capable of donating a proton, and a compatible, noncoordinating anion, A'. As used herein, the term "noncoordinating" means an anion or substance which either does not coordinate to the Group 4 metal containing precursor complex and the- catalytic derivative derived there from, or which is only weakly coordinated to such complexes thereby remaining sufficiently labile to be displaced by a neutral Lewis base. A noncoordinating anion specifically refers to an anion which when functioning as a charge balancing anion in a cationic metal complex does not transfer an anionic substituent or fragment thereof to said cation thereby forming neutral complexes. "Compatible anions" are anions which are not degraded to neutrality when the initially formed complex decomposes and are noninterfering with desired subsequent polymerization or other uses of the complex.<br>
Preferred anions are those containing a single coordination complex comprising a charge-bearing metal or metalloid core which anion is capable of balancing the charge of the active catalyst species (the metal cation) which may be formed when the two components are combined. Also, said anion should be sufficiently labile to be displaced by olefmic, diolefinic and acetylenically unsaturated compounds or other neutral Lewis bases such as ethers or nitriles. Suitable metals include, but are not limited to, aluminum, gold and platinum. Suitable metalloids include, but are not limited to, boron, phosphorus, and silicon.

WO 98/09996 describes activating catalyst compounds with perchlorates, periodates and iodates, including their hydrates. WO 99/18135 describes the use of organoboroaluminum activators. WO 03/10171 discloses catalyst activators that are adducts of Bronsted acids with Lewis acids. Other activators or methods for activating a catalyst compound are described in for example, US Patents 5,849,852, 5,859, 653, 5,869,723, EP-A-615981, and PCT publication WO 98/32775. All of the foregoing catalyst activators as well as any other know activator for transition metal complex catalysts may be employed alone or in combination according to the present invention, however, for best results alumoxane containing cocatalysts arc avoided.<br>
The molar ratio of cataiyst/cocatalyst employed preferably ranges from 1:10,000 to 100:1, more preferably from 1:5000 to 10:1, most preferably from 1:1000 to 1:1. Alumoxane, when used by itself as an activating cocatalyst, is employed in large quantity, generally at Jer-^t 100 times the quantity of metal complex on a molar basis. Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane, where used as an activating cocatalyst is employed in a molar ratio to the metal complex of from 0.5:1 to 10:1, more preferably from 1:1 to 6:1 most preferably from 1:1 to 5:1. The remaining activating cocatalysts are generally employed in approximately equimolar quantity with the metal complex.<br>
The process of the invention employing catalyst A, catalyst B, one or more cocatalysts, and chain shuttling agent C may be further elucidated by reference to Figure 1, where there are illustrated activated catalyst site A, 10, which under polymerization conditions forms a polymer chain, 13, attached to the active catalyst site, 12.  Similarly, active catalyst site B, 20, produces a differentiated polymer chain, 23, attached to the active catalyst site, 22. A chain shuttling agent CI, attached to a polymer chain produced by active catalyst B, 14, exchanges its polymer chain, 23, for the polymer chain, 13, attached to catalyst site A. Additional chain growth under polymerization conditions causes formation of a multi-block copolymer, IS, attached to active catalyst site A. Similarly, chain shuttling agent C2, attached to a polymer chain produced by active catalyst site A, 24, exchanges its polymer chain, 13, for the polymer chain, 23, attached to catalyst site B.<br><br>
Additional chain growth under polymerization conditions causes formation of a multi-block copolymer, 28, attached to active catalyst site B. The growing multi-block copolymers are repeatedly exchanged between active catalyst A and active catalyst B by means of shuttling agent C resulting in formation of a block or segment of differing properties whenever exchange to the opposite active catalyst site occurs. The growing polymer chains may be recovered while attached to a chain shuttling agent and functionalized if desired. Alternatively, the resulting polymer may be recovered by scission from the active catalyst site or the shuttling agent, through use of a proton source or other killing agent.<br>
It is believed (without wishing to be bound by such belief), that the composition of the respective segments or blocks, and especially of the end segments of the polymer chains, may be influenced through selection of process conditions or other process variables. In the polymers of the invention, the nature of the end segments is determined by the relative rates of chain transfer or termination for the respective catalysts as well as by the relative rates of chain shuttling. Possible chain termination mechanisms include, but are not limited to, P-hydrogen elimination, P-hydrogen transfer to monomer, P-methyl elimination, and chain transfer to hydrogen or other chain-terminating reagent such as an organosilane or chain functionalizing agent Accordingly, when a low concentration of chain shuttling agent is used, the majority of polymer chain ends will be generated in the polymerization reactor by one of the foregoing chain termination mechanisms and the relative rates of chain termination for catalyst (A) and (B) will determine the predominant chain terminating moiety. That is, the catalyst having the fastest rate of chain termination will produce relatively more chain end segments in the finished polymer.<br>
In contrast, when a high concentration of chain shuttling agent is employed, the majority of the polymer chains within the reactor and upon exiting the polymerization zone are attached or bound to the chain shuttling agent Under these reaction conditions, the relative rates of chain transfer of the polymerization catalysts and the relative rate of chain shuttling of the two catalysts primarily determines the identity of the chain terminating moiety. If catalyst (A) has a faster chain transfer and/or chain shuttling rate than catalyst (B), then the majority of the chain end segments will be those produced by catalyst (A).<br>
At intermediate concentrations of chain shuttling agent, all three of the aforementioned factors are instrumental in determining the identity of the final polymer block. The foregoing methodology may be expanded to the analysis of multi-block polymers having more than two block types and for controlling the average block lengths and block sequences for these polymers. For example, using a mixture of catalysts 1, 2, and 3 with a chain shuttling agent, for which each catalyst type makes a different type of polymer block, produces a linear block copolymer with three different block types. Furthermore, if the ratio of the shuttling rate to the propagation rate for the<br><br>
three catalysts follows the order 1&gt;2&gt;3, then the average block length for the three block types will follow the order 3&gt;2&gt;1, and there will be fewer instances of 2-type blocks adjacent to 3-type blocks than 1-type blocks adjacent to 2-type blocks.<br>
It follows that a method exists for controlling the block length distribution of the various block types. For example, by selecting catalysts 1,2, and 3 (wherein 2 and 3 produce substantially the same polymer block type), and a chain shuttling agent, and the shuttling rate follows the order 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3, the resulting polymer will have a bimodal distribution of block lengths made from the 2 and 3 catalysts.<br>
During the polymerization, the reaction mixture comprising one or more monomers is contacted with the activated catalyst composition according to any suitable polymerization conditions. The process is characterized by use of elevated temperatures and pressures. Hydrogen may be employed as a chain transfer agent for molecular weight control according to known techniques if desired. As in other similar polymerizations., it is highly desirable that the monomers and solvents employed be of sufficiently high purity that catalyst deactivation does not occur. Any suitable technique for monomer purification such as devolatilization at reduced pressure, contacting with molecular sieves or high surface area alumina, or a combination of the foregoing processes may be employed. The skilled artisan will appreciate that the ratio of chain shuttling agent to one or more catalysts and or monomers in the process of the present invention may be varied in order to produce polymers differing in one or more chemical or physical properties.<br>
Supports may be employed in the present invention, especially in slurry or gas-phase polymerizations. Suitable supports include solid, particulated, high surface area, metal oxides, metalloid oxides, or mixtures thereof (interchangeably referred to herein as an inorganic oxide). Examples include: talc, silica, alumina, magnesia, titania, zirconia, Sn203s aluminosilicates, borosilicates, clays, and mixtures thereof. Suitable supports preferably have a surface area as determined by nitrogen porosimetry using the BJE.T. method from 10 to 1000 m /g, and preferably from 100 to 600 m /g. The average particle size typically is from 0.1 to 500 jim, preferably from 1 to 200 {im, more preferably 10 to 100 µm.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention the present catalyst composition and optional support may be spray dried or otherwise recovered in solid, particulated form to provide a composition that is readily transported and handled. Suitable methods for spray drying a liquid containing slurry are well known in the art and usefully employed herein. Preferred techniques for spray drying catalyst compositions for use herein are described inUS-A's-5,648,310 and 5,672,669.<br>
The polymerization is desirably carried out as a continuous polymerization, preferably a continuous, solution polymerization, in which catalyst components, shuttling agent(s), monomers, and optionally solvent, adjuvants, scavengers, and polymerization aids are continuously supplied to<br><br>
the reaction zone and polymer product continuously removed there from. Within the scope of the terms "continuous" and "continuously" as used in this context are those processes in which there are intermittent additions of reactants and removal of products at small regular or irregular intervals, so that, over time, the overall process is substantially continuous.<br>
The catalyst compositions can be advantageously employed in a high pressure, solution, slurry, or gas phase polymerization process. For a solution polymerization process it is desirable to employ homogeneous dispersions of the catalyst components in a liquid diluent in which the polymer is soluble under the polymerization conditions employed. One such process utilizing an extremely fine silica or similar dispersing agent to produce such a homogeneous catalyst dispersion where either the metal complex or the cocatalyst is only poorly soluble is disclosed in US-A-5,783,512. A solution process to prepare the novel polymers of the present invention, especially a continuous solution process is preferably carried out at a temperature between 80°C and 250°C, more preferably between 100°C and 210°C, and most preferably between 110°C and 210°C. A high pressure process is usually carried out at temperatures from 100°C to 400°C and at pressures above 500 bar (50 MPa). A slurry process typically uses an inert hydrocarbon diluent and temperatures of from 0°C up to a temperature just below the temperature at which the resulting polymer becomes substantially soluble in the inert polymerization medium. Preferred temperatures in a slurry polymerization are from 30°C, preferably from 60°C up to 115°C, preferably up to 100°C. Pressures typically range from atmospheric (100 kPa) to 500 psi (3.4 MPa).<br>
In all of the foregoing processes, continuous or substantially continuous polymerization conditions are preferably employed. The use of such polymerization conditions, especially continuous, solution polymerization processes employing two or more active polymerization catalyst species, allows the use of elevated reactor temperatures which results in the economical production of multi-block or segmented copolymers in high yields and efficiencies. Both homogeneous and plug-flow type reaction conditions may be employed. The latter conditions are preferred where tapering of the block composition is desired.<br>
Both catalyst compositions (A) and (B) may be prepared as a homogeneous composition by addition of the requisite metal complexes to a solvent in which the polymerization will be conducted or in a diluent compatible with the ultimate reaction mixture. The desired cocatalyst or activator and the shuttling agent may be combined with the catalyst composition either prior to, simultaneously with, or after combination with the monomers to be polymerized and any additional reaction diluent.<br>
At all times, the individual ingredients as well as any active catalyst composition must be protected from oxygen and moisture. Therefore, the catalyst components, shuttling agent and<br><br>
activated catalysts must be prepared and stored in an oxygen and moisture free atmosphere, preferably a dry, inert gas such as nitrogen.<br>
Without limiting in any way the scope of the invention, one means for carrying out such a polymerization process is as follows. In a stirred-tank reactor, the monomers to be polymerized are introduced continuously together with any solvent or diluent. The reactor contains a liquid phase composed substantially of monomers together with any solvent or diluent and dissolved polymer. Preferred solvents include C4-10 hydrocarbons or mixtures thereof, especially alkanes such as hexane or mixtures of alkanes, as well as one or more of the monomers employed in the polymerization.<br>
Catalysts (A) and (B) along with cocatalyst and chain shuttling agent are continuously or intermittently introduced in the reactor liquid phase or any recycled portion thereof. The reactor temperature and pressure may be controlled by adjusting the solvent/monomer ratio, the catalyst addition rate, as well as by cooling or heating coils, jackets or both. The polymerization rate is controlled by the rate of catalyst addition. The ethylene content of the polymer product is determined by the ratio of ethylene to comonomer in the reactor, which is controlled by manipulating the respective feed rates of these components to the reactor. The polymer product molecular weight is controlled, optionally, by controlling other polymerization variables such as the temperature, monomer concentration, or by the previously mentioned chain transfer agent, as is well known in the art. Upon exiting the reactor, the effluent is contacted with a catalyst kill agent such as water, steam or an alcohol. The polymer solution is optionally heated, and the polymer product is recovered by flashing off gaseous monomers as well as residual solvent or diluent at reduced pressure, and, if necessary, conducting further devolatilization in equipment such as a devolatilizing extruder. In a continuous process the mean residence time of the catalyst and polymer in the reactor generally is from 5 minutes to 8 hours, and preferably from 10 minutes to 6 hours,<br>
Alternatively, the foregoing polymerization may be carried out in a continuous loop reactor with or without a monomer, catalyst or shuttling agent gradient established between differing regions thereof, optionally accompanied by separated addition of catalysts and/or chain transfer agent, and operating under adiabatic or non-adiabatic solution polymerization conditions or combinations of the foregoing reactor conditions. Examples of suitable loop reactors and a variety of suitable operating conditions for use therewith are found in USP's 5,977,251, 6,319,989 and 6,683,149.<br>
Although not as desired, the catalyst composition may also be prepared and employed as a heterogeneous catalyst by adsorbing the requisite components on an inert inorganic or organic particulated solid, as previously disclosed. In an preferred embodiment, a heterogeneous catalyst is prepared by co-precipitating the metal complex and the reaction product of an inert inorganic compound and an active hydrogen containing activator, especially the reaction product of a tri µM<br><br>
alkyl) aluminum compound and an ammonium salt of a hydroxyaryltris(pentafluorophenyl)borate, such as an ammonium salt of (4-hydroxy-3,5-ditertiarybutylphenyl)tris(pentafluorophenyI)borate. When prepared in heterogeneous or supported form, the catalyst composition may be employed in a slurry or a gas phase polymerization. As a practical limitation, slurry polymerization takes place in liquid diluents in which the polymer product is substantially insoluble. Preferably, the diluent for slurry polymerization is one or more hydrocarbons with less than 5 carbon atoms. If desired, saturated hydrocarbons such as ethane, propane or butane may be used in whole or part as the diluent. As with a solution polymerization, the a-olefm comonomer or a mixture of different oc-olefin monomers may be used in whole or part as the diluent. Most preferably at least a major part of the diluent comprises the a-olefin monomer or monomers to be polymerized.<br>
Preferably for use in gas phase polymerization processes, the support material and resulting catalyst has a median particle diameter from 20 to 200 µm, more preferably from 30 µm to 150 ^im, and most preferably from 50 µm to 100 urn. Preferably for use in slurry polymerization processes, the support has a median particle diameter from 1 µm to 200 µm, more preferably from 5 µm to 100 µm, and most preferably from 10 µm to 80 µm.<br>
Suitable gas phase polymerization process for use herein are substantially similar to known processes used commercially on a large scale for the manufacture of polypropylene, ethylene/ a-olefin copolymers, and other olefin polymers. The gas phase process employed can be, for example, of the type which employs a mechanically stirred bed or a gas fluidized bed as the polymerization reaction zone. Preferred is the process wherein the polymerization reaction is carried out in a vertical cylindrical polymerization reactor containing a fluidized bed of polymer particles supported or suspended above a perforated plate or fluidization grid, by a flow of fluidization gas.<br>
The gas employed to fluidize the bed comprises the monomer or monomers to be polymerized, and also serves as a heat exchange medium to remove the heat of reaction from the bed. The hot gases emerge from the top of the reactor, normally via a tranquilization zone, also known as a velocity reduction zone, having a wider diameter than the fluidized bed and wherein fine particles entrained in the gas stream have an opportunity to gravitate back into the bed. It can also be advantageous to use a cyclone to remove ultra-fine particles from the hot gas stream. The gas is then normally recycled to the bed by means of a blower or compressor and one or more heat exchangers to strip the gas of the heat of polymerization.<br>
A preferred method of cooling of the bed, in addition to the cooling provided by the cooled recycle gas, is to feed a volatile liquid to the bed to provide an evaporative cooling effect, often referred to as operation in the condensing mode. The volatile liquid employed in this case can be, for example, a volatile inert liquid, for example, a saturated hydrocarbon having 3 to 8, preferably 4<br><br>
to 6, carbon atoms. In the case that the monomer or comonotner itself is a volatile liquid, or can be condensed to provide such a liquid, this can suitably be fed to the bed to provide an evaporative cooling effect. The volatile liquid evaporates in the hot fluidized bed to form gas which mixes with the fluidizing gas. If the volatile liquid is a monomer or comonomer, it will undergo some polymerization in the bed. The evaporated liquid then emerges from the reactor as part of the hot recycle gas, and enters the compression/heat exchange part of the recycle loop. The recycle gas is cooled in the heat exchanger and, if the temperature to which the gas is cooled is below the dew point, liquid will precipitate from the gas. This liquid is desirably recycled continuously to the fluidized bed. It is possible to recycle the precipitated liquid to the bed as liquid droplets carried in the recycle gas stream. This type of process is described, for example in EP-89691; U.S. 4,543,399; WO-94/25495 and U.S. 5,352,749. A particularly preferred method of recycling the liquid to the bed is to separate the liquid from the recycle gas stream and to reinject this liquid directly into the bed, preferably using a method which generates fine droplets of the liquid within the bed. This type of process is described in WO-94/28032.<br>
The polymerization reaction occurring in the gas fluidized bed is catalyzed by the continuous or semi-continuous addition of catalyst composition according to the invention. The catalyst composition may be subjected to a prepolymerization step, for example, by polymerizing a small quantity of olefin monomer in a liquid inert diluent, to provide a catalyst composite comprising supported catalyst particles embedded in olefin polymer particles as well.<br>
The polymer is produced directly in the fluidized bed by polymerization of the monomer or mixture of monomers on the fluidized particles of catalyst composition, supported catalyst composition or prepolymerized catalyst composition within the bed. Start-up of the polymerization reaction is achieved using a bed of preformed polymer particles, which are preferably similar to the desired polymer, and conditioning the bed by drying with inert gas or nitrogen prior to introducing the catalyst composition, the monomers and any other gases which it is desired to have in the recycle gas stream, such as a diluent gas, hydrogen chain transfer agent, or an inert condensable gas when operating in gas phase condensing mode. The produced polymer is discharged continuously or semi-continuously from the fluidized bed as desired.<br>
The gas phase processes most suitable for the practice of this invention are continuous processes which provide for the continuous supply of reactants to the reaction zone of the reactor and the removal of products from the reaction zone of the reactor, thereby providing a steady-state environment on the macro scale in the reaction zone of the reactor. Products are readily recovered by exposure to reduced pressure and optionally elevated temperatures (devolatilization) according to known techniques. Typically, the fluidized bed of the gas phase process is operated at<br><br>
temperatures greater than 50°C, preferably from 60°C to 110°C, more preferably from 70°C to<br>
110°C.<br>
Examples of gas phase processes which are adaptable for use in the process of this invention are disclosed in US Patents: 4,588,790; 4,543,399; 5,352,749; 5,436,304; 5,405,922; 5,462,999; 5,461,123; 5,453,471; 5,032,562; 5,028,670; 5,473,028; 5,106,804; 5,556,238; 5,541,270; 5,608,019; and 5,616,661.<br>
As previously mentioned, functionalized derivatives of multi-block copolymers are also included within the present invention. Examples include metallated polymers wherein the metal is the remnant of the catalyst or chain shuttling agent employed, as well as further derivatives thereof, for example, the reaction product of a metallated polymer with an oxygen source and then with water to form a hydroxyl terminated polymer. In another embodiment, sufficient air or other quench agent is added to cleave some or all of the shuttling agent-polymer bonds thereby converting at least a portion of the polymer to a hydroxyl terminated polymer. Additional examples include olefin terminated polymers formed by p-hydride elimination and ethylenic unsaturation in the resulting polymer.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention the multi-block copolymer may be functionalized by maleation (reaction with maleic anhydride or its equivalent), metallation (such as with an alkyl lithium reagent, optionally in the presence of a Lewis base, especially an amine, such as tetramethylethylenediamine), or by incorporation of a diene or masked olefin in a copolymerization process. After polymerization involving a masked olefin, the masking group, for example a trihydrocarbylsilane, may be removed thereby exposing a more readily functionalized remnant. Techniques for functionalization of polymers are well known, and disclosed for example in USP 5,543,458, and elsewhere.<br>
Because a substantial fraction of the polymeric product exiting the reactor is terminated with the chain shuttling agent, further functionalization is relatively easy. The metallated polymer species can be utilized in well known chemical reactions such as those suitable for other alkyl-aluminum, alkyl-gallium, alkyl-zinc, or alkyl-Group 1 compounds to form amine-, hydroxy-, epoxy-, ketone, ester, nitrile, and other functionalized terminated polymer products. Examples of suitable reaction techniques that are adaptable for use here in are described in Negishi, "Orgaonmetallics in Organic Synthesis", Vol. 1 and 2, (1980), and other standard texts in organometallic and organic synthesis.<br>

More preferably still, the highest CRYSTAF peak comprises at least 10 percent of the cumulative polymer. Figures 3-27 and 36-49 show the DSC and CRYSTAF curves for many examples of the invention as well as many comparative polymers Peaks used for calculating the delta quantity, y*, are identified in each figure along with integrated area under the curve (indicating percentage of cumulative polymer). Figures 2 and 50 shows plotted data for examples of the invention as well as comparative examples. Integrated peak areas and peak temperatures are calculated by the computerized drawing program supplied by the instrument maker. The diagonal line shown for the<br><br>
random ethylene octene comparative polymers corresponds to the equation y* = -0.1299 (AH) -f 62.81.<br>
In a fifth embodiment, the invention is an interpolymer having a tensile strength above 10 MPa, preferably a tensile strength &gt; 11 MPa, more preferably a tensile strength &gt; 13MPa and an elongation at break of at least 600 percent, more preferably at least 700 percent, highly preferably at least 800 percent, and most highly preferably at least 900 percent at a crosshead separation rate of 11 cm/minute.<br>
In a sixth embodiment, the invention is an interpolymer having a delta quantity (tallest DSC peak temperature (measured from the baseline) minus tallest CRYSTAF peak temperature (i.e., highest numerical value of dW/dT)) greater than 48°C and a heat of fusion greater than or equal to 130 J/gm, wherein the CRYSTAF peak is determined using at least 5 percent of the cumulative polymer (that is, the peak must represent at least 5 percent of the cumulative polymer), and if less than 5 percent of the polymer has an identifiable CRYSTAF peak, then the CRYSTAF temperature is 30°C. More preferably still, the highest CRYSTAF peak comprises at least 10 percent of the cumulative polymer. Figures 3-27 and 36-49 show the DSC and CRYSTAF curves for many [ examples of the invention as well as many comparative polymers Peaks used for calculating the delta quantity, y*, are identified in each figure along with integrated area under the curve (indicating percentage of cumulative polymer). In Figures 2 and 50 the vertical line illustrates AH = 130 J/g and the horizontal line illustrates y* = 48°C.<br>
In a seventh embodiment, the invention is an interpolymer having a storage modulus ratio, G'(25°C)/G\100oC), of from 1 to 50, preferably from 1 to 20, more preferably from 1 to 10, and a 70°C compression set of less than 80 percent, preferably less than 70 percent, especially less than 60 percent, down to a compression set of 0 percent.<br>
In an eighth embodiment, the invention is an interpolymer having a heat of fusion of less than 85 J/g and a pellet blocking strength of equal to or less than 100 pounds/foot2 (4800 Pa), preferably equal to or less than 50 lbs/ft2 (2400 Pa), especially equal to or less than 5 lbs/ft2 (240 Pa), and as low as 0 lbs/ft2 (0 Pa).<br>
In a ninth embodiment, the invention is a uncrosslinked, elastomeric, interpolymer comprising in polymerized form at least 50 mole percent ethylene, having a 70°C compression set of less than 80 percent, preferably less than 70 percent, most preferably less than 60 percent.<br>
In a tenth embodiment, the invention is an olefin interpolymer, preferably comprising ethylene and one or more copolymerizable comonomers in polymerized form, characterized by multiple blocks or segments of two or more polymerized monomer units differing in chemical or physical properties (blocked interpolymer), most preferably a multi-block copolymer, said block interpolymer having a molecular fraction which elutes between 40°C and 130°C when fractionated<br><br>
using TREF, characterized in that said fraction has a molar comonomer content higher, preferably at least 5 percent higher, more preferably at least 10 percent higher, than that of a comparable random ethylene interpolymer fraction eluting between the same temperatures, wherein said comparable random ethylene interpolymer comprises the same comonomer(s), and has a melt index, density, and molar comonomer content (based on the whole polymer) within 10 percent of that of the blocked interpolymer. Preferably, the Mw/Mn of the comparable interpolymer is also within 10 percent of that of the blocked interpolymer and/or the comparable interpolymer has a total comonomer content within 10 weight percent of that of the blocked interpolymer.<br>
Comonomer content may be measured using any suitable technique, with techniques based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy preferred. Moreover, for polymers or blends of polymers having relatively broad TREF curves, the polymer desirably is first fractionated using TREF into fractions each having an eluted temperature range of i0°C or less. That is, each eluted fraction has a collection temperature window of 10°C or less. Using this technique, said blocked interpolymers have at least one such fraction having a higher molar comonomer content than a corresponding fraction of the comparable interpolymer.<br>
Preferably, for interpolymers of ethylene and 1-octene, the blocked interpolymer has a comonomer content of the TREF fraction eluting between 40 a;&gt;.d 130°C greater than or equal to the quantity (- 0.2013) T + 20.07, more preferably greater than or equal to the quantity (-0.2013) T+ 21.07, where T is the numerical value of the peak elution temp; ..afttre of the TREF fraction being compared, measured in °C.<br>
Figure 54 graphically depicts the foregoing embodiment of the invention for blocked interpolymers of ethylene and 1-octene where a plot of the cornonomer content versus TREF elution temperature for several comparable ethylene/1-octene interpolymers (random copolymers) are fit to a line representing (- 0.2013) T + 20.07 (solid line). The line for the equation (- 0.2013) T + 21.07 is depicted by a dotted line. Also depicted are the comonomer contents for fractions of several blocked ethylene/1-octene interpolymers of the invention (multi-block copolymers). All of the blocked interpolymer fractions have significantly higher 1-octene content than either line at equivalent elution temperatures. This result is characteristic of the multi-block copolymers of the invention and is believed to be due to the presence of differentiated blocks within the polymer chains, having both crystalline and amorphous nature.<br>
Figure 55 graphically displays the TREF curve and comonomer contents of polymer fractions for Example 5 and comparative F. The peak eluting from 40 to 130°C, preferably from 60°C to 95°C for both polymers is fractionated into three parts, each part eluting over a temperature range of less than 10°C. Actual data for Example 5 is represented by triangles. The skilled artisan will appreciate that an appropriate calibration curve may be constructed for interpolymers<br><br>
comprising different comonomers and a line used as a comparison fitted to the TREF values obtained from comparative interpolymers of the same monomers, preferably random copolymers made using a metallocene or other homogeneous catalyst composition. Blocked interpolymers corresponding to the present invention are characterized by a molar comonomer content greater than the value determined from the calibration curve at the same TREF elution temperature, preferably at least 5 percent greater, more preferably at least 10 percent greater.<br>
For copolymers of ethylene and an a-olefln, the inventive polymers preferably possess a PDI of at least 1.7, more preferably at least 2.0, and most preferably at least 2.6, up to a maximum value of 5.0, more preferably up to a maximum of 3.5, and especially up to a maximum of 2.7, a heat of fusion of 80 J/g or less, an ethylene content of at least 50 weight percent, a glass transition temperature, Tg, of less than -25°C, more preferably less than -30°C, and/or one and only one Tm.<br>
The polymers may be further characterized by a thermomechanical analysis penetration<br>
depth of 1 mm at a temperature of at least 90°C as well as a flexural modulus of from 3 kpsi (20<br>
MPa) to 13 kpsi (90 MPa). Alternatively, the present polymers can have a thermomechanical<br>
analysis penetration depth of 1 ixnn at a temperature of at least 104°C as well as a flexural modulus<br>
of at least 3 kpsi (20 MPa). The inventive interpolymers may be further characterized as having a<br>
70°C compression set of less than 80 percent, preferably less than 70 percent, most preferably less<br>
than 60 percent. The inventive polymers further may be characterized as having an abrasion<br>
resistance (or volume loss) of less than 90 mm3. Further, the inventive polymers can have, alone or<br>
in combination with any other properties herein disclosed, a storage modulus, G', such that log (G5)<br>
is greater than or equal to 400 kPa, preferably greater than or equal to 1.0 MPa, at a temperature of<br>
100°C. Moreover, the olefin polymers of the invention possess a relatively flat storage modulus as<br>
a function of temperature in the range from 0 to 100°C (illustrated in Figure 35) that is characteristic<br>
i of block copolymers, and here-to-before unknown for an all olefin copolymer, especially a<br>
copolymer of ethylene and one or more C3-8 aliphatic a-olefins. (By the term "relatively flat" in this<br>
context is meant that log G' (in Pascals) decreases by less than one order of magnitude between 50<br>
and 100°C, preferably between 0 and 100°C). Additionally, the polymers of the invention can have<br>
a melt index, I2, from 0.01 to 2000 g/10 minutes, preferably from 0.01 to 1000 g/10 minutes, more<br>
preferably from 0,01 to 500 g/10 minutes, and especially from 0.01 to 100 g/10 minutes. The<br>
mveixtGd po]ym&amp;rs can have molecular weights, Mw, from 1,000 g/mole to 5,000,000 g/mole,<br>
preferably from 10.00 g/mole to 1,000,000, more preferably from 10,000 g/mole to 500,000 g/mole,<br>
and especially from 10,000 g/mole to 300,000 g/mole. The density of the invented polymers can be<br>
from 0.80 to 0.99 g/cm3 and preferably for ethylene containing polymers from 0.85 g/cm3 to 0.97<br>
g/C1-4.<br><br>
The polymers of the invention may be differentiated from conventional, random copolymers, physical blends of polymers, and block copolymers prepared via sequential monomer addition, fluxional catalysts, anionic or cationic living polymerization techniques. In particular, compared to a random copolymer of the same monomers and monomer content at equivalent crystallinity or modulus, the polymers of the invention have better (higher) heat resistance as measured by melting point, higher TMA penetration temperature, higher high-temperature tensile strength, and/or higher high-temperature torsion storage modulus as determined by dynamic mechanical analysis. Compared to a random copolymer comprising the same monomers and monomer content, the inventive polymers have lower compression set, particularly at elevated temperatures, lower stress relaxation, higher creep resistance, higher tear strength, higher blocking resistance, faster setup due to higher crystallization (solidification) temperature, higher recovery (particularly at elevated temperatures), better abrasion resistance, higher retractive force, and better oil and filler acceptance.<br>
The present polymers also exhibit a unique crystallization and branching distribution relationship. That is, the present polymers have a relatively large difference between the tallest peak temperature measured using CRYSTAF and DSC as a function of heat of fusion, especially as compared to random copolymers comprising the same monomers and monomer level or physical blends of polymers, such as a blend of a high density polymer and a lower density copolymer, at equivalent overall density. It is believed that this unique feature of the invented polymers is due to the unique distribution of the comonomer in blocks within the polymer backbone. In particular, the polymer desirably comprises alternating blocks -of differing comonomer content (including homopolymers blocks). The polymers desirably comprise a distribution in number and/or block size of polymer blocks of differing density or comonomer content, which is a Schultz-Flory type of distribution. In addition, the inventive polymers also have a peak melting point and crystallization temperature profile that, uniquely, is independent of polymer density/modulus morphology. In a preferred embodiment, the microcrystalline order of the polymers demonstrates characteristic spherulites and lamellae that are distinguishable from random or block copolymers, even at PDI values that are less than 1.7, or even less than 1.5, down to less than 1.3. The unique crystalline morphology of the invented polymers is believed to result in good barrier properties due to increased tortuosity of the crystalline morphology, which makes the polymers suitable for use in gasketing and sealing applications, such as bottle cap liners and films for produce, meat, and food packaging. Figure 28 contains low resolution optical micrographs of pressed films showing the microcrystalline structure of three multi-block copolymers of the present invention (all having about 0.88 density) but made with differing levels of chain shuttling agent showing varied spherulitic structure as well as three comparative polymers, a substantially linear ethylene/ 1-octene copolymer<br><br>
(Affinity™ copolymer of 0.875 g/C1-4density, available from The Dow Chemical Company), a linear polyethylene having density of 0.94 g/cm3, and a polyethylene blend made with dual catalysts in a single reactor (in-reactor blend). Figure 29 contains four high resolution scanning electron micrographs (100 nm scale), three taken of the above samples of the invented polymers made with high, medium and low levels of chain shuttling agent in the reactor, as well as a comparative photomicrograph of the substantially linear ethylene/ 1-octene copolymer (Affinity™ copolymer of 0.875 g/cm3 density). Comparison of the three photographs of polymers of the invention generally show a reduction in lamellae thickness and length with increasing levels of chain shuttling agent.<br>
Moreover, the present polymers may be prepared using techniques to influence the degree or level of blockiness. That is the amount of comonomer and length of each polymer block or segment can be altered by controlling the ratio and type of catalysts and shuttling agent as well as the temperature of the polymerization, and other polymerization variables. A surprising benefit of this phenomenon is the discovery that as the degree of blockiness is increased, the optical properties, tear strength, and high temperature recovery properties of the resulting polymer are improved. In particular, haze decreases while clarity, tear strength, and high temperature recovery properties increase as the average number of blocks in the polymer increases. By selecting shuttling agents and catalyst combinations having the desired chain transferring ability (high rates of shuttling with low levels of chain termination) other forms of polymer termination are effectively suppressed. Accordingly, little if any P-hydride elimination is observed in the polymerization of ethylene/ a-olefin comonomer mixtures according to the invention, and the resulting crystalline blocks are highly, or substantially completely, linear, possessing little or no long chain branching.<br>
Another surprising benefit of the invention is that polymers wherein chain ends are highly crystalline can be selectively prepared. In elastomer applications, reducing the relative quantity of polymer that terminates with an amorphous block reduces the intermolecular dilutive effect on crystalline regions. This result can be obtained by choosing chain shuttling agents and catalysts having an appropriate response to hydrogen or other chain terminating agents. Specifically, if the catalyst which produces highly crystalline polymer is more susceptible to chain termination (such as by use of hydrogen) than the catalyst responsible for producing the less crystalline polymer segment (such as through higher comonomer incorporation, regio-error, or atactic polymer formation), then the highly crystalline polymer segments will preferentially populate the terminal portions of the polymer. Not only are the resulting terminated groups crystalline, but upon termination, the highly crystalline polymer forming catalyst site is once again available for reinitiation of polymer formation. The initially formed polymer is therefore another highly crystalline polymer segment. Accordingly, both ends of the resulting multi-block copolymer are preferentially highly crystalline.<br><br>
The ability of the present multi-block copolymers made from ethylene and a cornonomer such as 1-octene to retain high melting temperature properties is illustrated by reference to Figure 34, which is a graph of crystalline melting point as a function of density (comonomer content). At lower densities, crystalline melt temperatures are not significantly reduced compared to those of higher density multi-block copolymers according to the invention (line), whereas conventional random copolymers typically follow a well known curve reflecting loss of peak crystalline melt temperature as density is reduced.<br>
Other highly desirable compositions according to the present invention are elastomeric interpolymers of ethylene, a C3.2o a-olefin, especially propylene, and optionally one or more diene monomers. Preferred a-olefins for use in this embodiment of the present invention are designated by the formula CH2=CHR*, where R* is a linear or branched alkyl group of from 1 to 12 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable a-olefins include, but are not limited to, propylene, isobutylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, l-hexene,4-methyl-1-pentene, and 1-octene. A particularly preferred a-olefin is propylene. The propylene based polymers are generally referred to in the art as EP or EPDM polymers. Suitable dienes for use in preparing such polymers, especially multi-block EPDM type polymers include conjugated or non-conjugated, straight or branched chain-, cyclic- or polycyclic-dienes containing from 4 to 20 carbons. Preferred dienes include 1,4-pentadiene, 1,4-hexadiene, 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene, dicyclopentadiene, cyclohexadiene, and 5-butylidene-2-norbornene. A particularly preferred diene is 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene.<br>
Because the diene containing polymers contain alternating segments or blocks containing greater or lesser quantities of the diene (including none) and a-olefin (including none), the total quantity of diene and a-olefin may be reduced without loss of subsequent polymer properties. That is, because the diene and a-olefin monomers are preferentially incorporated into one type of block of the polymer rather than uniformly or randomly throughout Hie polymer, they are more efficiently utilized and subsequently the crosslink density of the polymer can be better controlled. Such crosslinkable elastomers and the cured products have advantaged properties, including higher tensile strength and better elastic recovery.<br>
Desirably, the polymers of the invention made with two catalysts incorporating differing quantities of comonomer have a weight ratio of blocks formed thereby from 95:5 to 5:95, The elastomeric polymers desirably have an ethylene content of from 20 to 90 percent, a diene content of from 0.1 to 10 percent, and an a-olefin content of from 10 to 80 percent, based on the total weight of the polymer. Further preferably, the multi-block elastomeric polymers of this embodiment of the invention have an ethylene content of from 60 to 90 percent, a diene content of from 0.1 to 10 percent, and an a-olefin content of from 10 to 40 percent, based on the total weight of the polymer. Preferred polymers are high molecular weight polymers, having a weight average<br><br>

Suitable oils include any oil that is conventionally used in manufacturing extended EPDM rubber formulations. Examples include both naphthenic- and paraffinic- oils, with paraffinic oils being preferred.<br>
Highly desirably a curable EPDM rubber formulation is prepared by incorporation of one or more curing agents along with conventional accelerators or other adjuvants. Suitable curing agents are sulfur based. Examples of suitable sulfur based curing agents include, but are not limited to, sulfur, tetramethylthiuram disulfide (TMTD), dipentamethylenethiuram tetrasulfide (DPTT), 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT), 2-mercaptobenzothiazolate disulfide (MBTS), zinc-2-mercaptobenozothiazolate (ZMBT), zinc diethyldithiocarbamatezinc (ZDEC), zinc dibutyldithiocarbamate (ZDBC), dipentamethylenethiuram tetrasulflde (DPTT), N-t-butylbenzothiazole-2- sulfanamide (TBBS), and mixtures thereof. A preferred cure system includes a combination of sulfur, MBT and TMTD. Desirably, the foregoing components are employed in amounts from 0.1 to 5 percent, based on total composition weight.<br>

In a highly desired embodiment of the invention thermoplastic compositions comprising a thermoplastic matrix polymer, especially isotactic polypropylene, and an elastomeric multi-block copolymer of ethylene and a copolymerizabie comonomer according to the invention, are uniquely capable of forming core-shell type particles having hard crystalline or semi-crystalline blocks in the form of a core surrounded by soft or elastomeric blocks forming a "shell" around the occluded domains of hard polymer. These particles are formed and dispersed within the matrix polymer by the forces incurred during melt compounding or blending. This highly desirable morphology is believed to result due to the unique physical properties of the multi-block copolymers which enable compatible polymer regions such as the matrix and higher comonomer content elastomeric regions of the multi-block copolymer to self-assemble in the melt due to thermodynamic forces. Shearing forces during compounding are believed to produce separated regions of matrix polymer encircled by elastomer. Upon solidifying, these regions become occluded elastomer particles encased in the polymer matrix.<br>
Particularly desirable blends are thermoplastic polyolefin blends (TPO), thermoplastic elastomer blends (TPE)9 thermoplastic vulcanisites (TPV) and styrenic polymer blends. TPE and TPV blends may be prepared by combining the invented multi-block polymers, including µmctionalized or unsaturated derivatives thereof with an optional rubber, including conventional<br><br>
block copolymers, especially an SBS block copolymer, and optionally a crosslinking or vulcanizing agent. TPO blends are generally prepared by blending the invented multi-block copolymers with a polyolefin, and optionally a crosslinking or vulcanizing agent The foregoing blends may be used in forming a molded object, and optionally crosslinking the resulting molded article. A similar procedure using different components has been previously disclosed in USP 6,797,779.<br>
Suitable conventional block copolymers for this application desirably possess a Mooney viscosity (ML 1+4 @ 100°C.) in the range from 10 to 135, more preferably from 25 to 100, and most preferably from 30 to 80. Suitable polyolefins especially include linear or low density polyethylene, polypropylene (including atactic, isotactic, syndiotactic and impact modified versions thereof) and poly(4-methyl-l-pentene). Suitable styrenic polymers include polystyrene, rubber modified polystyrene (HIPS), styrene/acrylonitrile copolymers (SAN), rubber modified SAN (ABS or AES) and styrene maleic anhydride copolymers.<br>
The blends may be prepared by mixing or kneading the respective components at a temperature around'or above the melt point temperature of one or both of the components. For most multiblock copolymers, this temperature may be above 130° C, most generally above 145° C.. and most preferably above 150° C. Typical polymer mixing or kneading equipment that is capable of reaching the desired temperatures and melt plastifying the mixture may be employed. These include mills, kneaders, extruders (both single screw and twin-screw), Banbury mixers, calenders, and the like. The sequence of mixing and method may depend on the final composition. A combination of Banbury batch mixers and continuous mixers may also be employed, such as a Banbury mixer followed by a mill mixer followed by an extruder. Typically, a TPE or TPV composition will have a higher loading of cross-linkable polymer (typically the conventional block copolymer containing unsaturation) compared to TPO compositions. Generally, for TPE and TPV compositions, the weight ratio of block copolymer to multi-block copolymer maybe from about 90:10 to 10:90, more preferably from 80:20 to 20:80, and most preferably from 75:25 to 25:75. For TPO applications, the weight ratio of multi-block copolymer to polyolefin may be from about 49:51 to about 5:95, more preferably from 35:65 to about 10:90. For modified styrenic polymer applications, the weight ratio of multi-block copolymer to polyolefin may also be from about 49:51 to about 5:95, more preferably from 35:65 to about 10:90. The ratios may be changed by changing the viscosity ratios of the various components. There is considerable literature illustrating techniques for changing the phase continuity by changing the viscosity ratios of the constituents of a blend and a person skilled in this art may consult if necessary.<br>
The blend compositions may contain processing oils, plasticizers, and processing aids. Rubber processing oils have a certain ASTM designation and paraffinic, napthenic or aromatic process oils are all suitable for use. Generally from 0 to 150 parts, more preferably 0 to 100 parts,<br><br>
and most preferably from 0 to 50 parts of oil per 100 parts of total polymer are employed. Higher amounts of oil may tend to improve the processing of the resulting product at the expense of some physical properties. Additional processing aids include conventional waxes, fatty acid salts, such as calcium stearate or zinc stearate, (poly)alcohols including glycols, (poly)alcohol ethers, including glycol ethers, (poly)esters, including (poly)glycol esters, and metal salt-, especially Group 1 or 2 metal or zinc-, salt derivatives thereof.<br>
It is known that non-hydrogenated rubbers such as those comprising polymerized forms of butadiene or isoprene, including block copolymers (here-in-after diene rubbers), have lower resistance to UV, ozone, and oxidation, compared to mostly or highly saturated rubbers. In' applications such as tires made from compositions containing higher concentrations of diene based rubbers, it is known to incorporate carbon black to improve rubber stability, along with anti-ozone additives and anti-oxidants. Multi-block copolymers according to the present invention possessing extremely low levels of unsaturation, find particular application as a protective surface layer (coated, coextruded or laminated) or weather resistant film adhered to articles formed from conventional diene elastomer modified polymeric compositions.<br>
For conventional TPO, TPV, and TPE applications, carbon black is the additive of choice for UV absorption and stabilizing properties. Representative examples of carbon blacks include ASTMN110,N121,N220,N231,N234,N242,N293,N299, S315, N326,N330,M332,N339, N343, N347, N351, N358, N375, N539, N550, N582, N630, N642, N650, N683, N754, N762, N765, N774, N787, N907, N908, N990 and N991. These carbon blacks have iodine absorptions ranging from 9 to 145 g/kg and average pore volumes ranging from 10 to 150 cmVlOO g. Generally, smaller particle sized carbon blacks are employed, to the extent cost considerations permit. For many such applications the present multi-block copolymers and blends thereof require little or no carbon black, thereby allowing considerable design, freedom to include alternative pigments or no pigments at all. Multi-hued tires or tires matching the color of the vehicle are one possibility.<br>
Compositions, including thermoplastic blends according to the invention may also contain anti-ozonants or anti-oxidants that are known to a rubber chemist of ordinary skill. The anti-ozonants may be physical protectants such as waxy materials that come to the surface and protect the part from oxygen or ozone or they may be chemical protectors that react with oxygen or ozone. Suitable chemical protectors include styrenated phenols, butylated octylated phenol, butylated di(dimethylbenzyl) phenol, p-phenylenediamines, butylated reaction products of p-cresol and dicyclopentadiene (DCPD), polyphenols antioxidants, hydroquinone derivatives, quinoline, diphenylene antioxidants, thioester antioxidants, and blends thereof. Some representative trade names of such products are Wingstay™ S antioxidant, Polystay™ 100 antioxidant, Polystay™ 100 AZ antioxidant, Polystay™ 200 antioxidant, Wingstay™ L antioxidant, Wingstay™ LHLS<br><br>
antioxidant, Wingstay™ K antioxidant, Wingstay™ 29 antioxidant, Wingstay™ SN-1 antioxidant, and Irganox™ antioxidants. In some applications, the anti-oxidants and anti-ozonants used will preferably be non-staining and non-migratory.<br>
For providing additional stability against UV radiation, hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS) and UV absorbers may be also used. Suitable examples include Tinuvin™ 123, Tinuvin™ 144, Tinuvin™ 622, Tinuvin™ 765, Tinuvin™ 770, and Tinuvin™ 780, available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals, and Chemisorb™ T944, available from Cytex Plastics, Houston TX, USA. A Lewis acid may be additionally included with a HALS compound in order to achieve superior surface quality, as disclosed in USP 6,051,681.<br>
For some compositions, additional mixing process may be employed to pre-disperse the anti-oxidants, anti-ozonants, carbon black, UV absorbers, and/or light stabilizers to form a masterbatch, and subsequently to form polymer blends there from.<br>
Suitable crosslinking agents (also referred to as curing or vulcanizing agents) for use herein include sulfur based, peroxide based, or phenolic based compounds. Examples of the foregoing materials are found in the art, including inUSP's: 3,758,643, 3,806,558, 5,051,478, 4,104,210, 4,130,535, 4,202,801, 4,271,049,4,340,684, 4,250,273,4,927,882, 4,311,628 and 5,248,729.<br>
When sulfur based curing agents are employed, accelerators and cure activators may be used as well. Accelerators are used to control the time and/or temperature required for dynamic vulcanization and to improve the properties of the resulting cross-linked article. In one embodiment, a single accelerator or primary accelerator is used. The primary accelerator(s) may be used in total amounts ranging from about 0.5 to about 4, preferably about 0.8 to about 1.5, phr, based on total composition weight: In another embodiment, combinations of a primary and a secondary accelerator might be used with the secondary accelerator being used in smaller amounts, such as from about 0.05 to about 3 phr, in order to activate and to improve the properties of the cured article. Combinations of accelerators generally produce articles having properties that are somewhat better than those produced by use of a single accelerator. In addition, delayed action accelerators may be used which are not affected by normal processing temperatures yet produce a satisfactory cure at ordinary vulcanization temperatures. Vulcanization retarders might also be used. Suitable types of accelerators that may be used in the present invention are amines, disulfides, guanidines, thioureas, thiazoles, thiurams, sulfonamides, dithiocarbamates and xanthates. Preferably, the primary accelerator is a sulfenamide. If a second accelerator is used, the secondary accelerator is preferably a guanidine, dithiocarbarnate or thiuram compound. Certain processing aids and cure activators such as stearic acid and ZnO may also be used. When peroxide based curing agents are used, co-activators or coagents may be used in combination therewith. Suitable coagents include trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA), trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate<br><br>
(TMPTMA), triallyl cyanurate (TAC), triallyl isocyanurate (TAIC), among others. Use of peroxide crosslinkers and optional coagents used for partial or complete dynamic vulcanization are known in the art and disclosed for example in the publication, "Peroxide Vulcanization of Elastomer", Vol. 74, No 3, July-August 2001.<br>
When the multi-block copolymer containing composition is at least partially crosslinked, the degree of crosslinking may be measured by dissolving the composition in a solvent for specified duration, and calculating the percent gel or unextractable component The percent gel normally increases with increasing crosslinking levels. For cured articles according to the invention, the percent gel content is desirably in the range from 5 to 100 percent.<br>
The multi-block copolymers of the invention as well as blends thereof possess improved processability compared to prior art compositions, due, it is believed, to lower melt viscosity. Thus, the composition or blend demonstrates an unproved surface appearance, especially when formed into a molded or extruded article. At the same time, the present compositions and blends thereof uniquely possess improved melt strength properties, thereby allowing the present multi-block copolymers and blends thereof, especially TPO blends, to be usefully employed in foam and thermoforming applications where melt strength is currently inadequate.<br>
Thermoplastic compositions according to the invention may also contain organic or inorganic fillers or other additives such as starch, talc, calcium carbonate, glass fibers, polymeric fibers (including nylon, rayon, cotton, polyester, and polyaramide), metal fibers, flakes or particles, expandable layered silicates, phosphates or carbonates, such as clays, mica, silica, alumina, aluminosilicates or aluminophosphates, carbon whiskers, carbon fibers, nanoparticies including nanotubes, wollastonite, graphite, zeolites, and ceramics, such as silicon carbide, silicon nitride or titanias. Silane based or other coupling agents may also be employed for better filler bonding.<br>
The thermoplastic compositions of this invention, including the foregoing blends, may be processed by conventional molding techniques such as injection molding, extrusion molding, thermoforming, slush molding, over molding, insert molding, blow molding, and other techniques. Films, including multi-layer films, may be produced by cast or tentermg processes, including blown film processes.<br>
Testing Methods<br>
In the foregoing characterizing disclosure and the examples that follow, the following analytical techniques are-employed: GPC Method for Samples 1-4 and A-C<br>
An automated liquid-handling robot equipped with a heated needle set to 160°C is used to add enough 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene stabilized with 300 ppm Ionol to each dried polymer sample to<br><br>
give a final concentration of 30 mg/mL. A small glass stir rod is placed into each tube and the samples are heated to 160°C for 2 hours on a heated, orbital-shaker rotating at 250 rpm. The concentrated polymer solution is then diluted to 1 mg/ml using the automated liquid-handling robot and the heated needle set to 160°C.<br>
A Symyx Rapid GPC system is used to determine the molecular weight data for each sample. A Gilson 350 pump set at 2.0 ml/min flow rate is used to pump helium-purged l,2-dichlorobenzene stabilized with 300 ppm Ionol as the mobile phase through three Plgel 10 micrometer (µm) Mixed B 300mm x 7.5mm columns placed in series and heated to 160°C. A Polymer Labs ELS 1000 Detector is used with the Evaporator set to 250°C, the Nebulizer set to 165°C9 and the nitrogen flow rate set to 1.8 SLM at a pressure of 60-80 psi (400-600 kPa) N2. The polymer samples are heated to 160°C and each sample injected into a 250 pi loop using the liquid-handling robot and a heated needle. Serial analysis of the polymer samples using two switched loops and overlapping injections are used. The sample data is collected and analyzed using Symyx Epoch™ software. Peaks are manually integrated and the molecular weight information reported uncorrected against a polystyrene standard calibration curve.<br>
The DSC melting peak is measured as the maximum in heat flow rate (W/g) with respect to the linear baseline drawn between -30°C and end of melting. The heat of fusion is measured as the area under the melting curve between -30°C and the end of melting using a linear baseline. Standard CRYSTAF Method<br>
Branching distributions are determined by crystallization analysis fractionation (CRYSTAF) using a CRYSTAF 200 unit commercially available from PolymerChar, Valencia, Spain. The samples are dissolved in 1,2,4 trichlorobenzene at 160°C (0.66 mg/mL) for 1 hr and stabilized at 95°C for 45 minutes. The sampling temperatures range from 95 to 30°C at a cooling rate of 0.2°C/min. An infrared detector is used to measure the polymer solution concentrations. The cumulative soluble concentration is measured as the polymer crystallizes while the temperature is decreased. The analytical derivative of the cumulative profile reflects the short chain branching distribution of the polymer.<br>
The CRYSTAF peak temperature and area are identified by the peak analysis module included in the CRYSTAF Software (Version 2001.b, PolymerChar, Valencia, Spain). The CRYSTAF peak finding routine identifies a peak temperature as a maximum in the dW/dT and the area between the largest positive inflections on either side of the identified peak in the derivative curve. To calculate the CRYSTAF curve, the preferred processing parameters are with a temperature limit of 70°C and with smoothing parameters above the temperature limit of 0.1, and below the temperature limit of 0.3.<br><br>
DSC Standard Method (Excluding Samples 1-4 and A-C)<br>
Differential Scanning Calorimetry results are determined using aTAI model Q1000 DSC equipped with, an RCS cooling accessory and an autosampler. A nitrogen purge gas flow of 50 ml/min is used. The sample is pressed into a thin film and melted in the press at about 175°C and then air-cooled to room temperature (25°C). 3-10 rng Of material is then cut into a 6 mm diameter disk, accurately weighed, placed in a light aluminum pan (ca 50 mg), and then crimped shut. The thermal behavior of the sample is investigated with the following temperature profile. The sample is rapidly heated to 180°C and held isothermal for 3 minutes in order to remove any previous thennal history. The sample is then cooled to -40°C at 10°C/min cooling rate and held at -40°C for 3 minutes. The sample is then heated to 150 °C at 10°C/min. heating rate. The cooling and second heating curves are recorded.<br>
The DSC melting peak is measured as the maximum in heat flow rate (W/g) with respect to the linear baseline drawn between -30°C and end of melting. The heat of fusion is measured as the area under the melting curve between -30°C and the end of melting using a linear baseline. Abrasion Resistance<br>
Abrasion resistance is measured on compression molded plaques according to ISO 4649. The average value of 3 measurements is reported. Plaques for the test are 6.4 mm thick and compression molded using a hot press (Carver Model #4095-4PR1001R). The pellets are placed betweenpolytetrafluoroethylene sheets,heatedat 190 °C at 55 psi (380kPa)for 3 minutes, followed by 1.3 MPa for 3 minutes, and then 2.6 MPa for 3 minutes. Next the piaques are cooled in the press with running cold water at 1.3 MPa for 1 minute and removed for testing. GPC Method (Excluding Samples 1-4 and A-C)<br>
The gel permeation chromatographic system consists of either a Polymer Laboratories Model PL-210 or a Polymer Laboratories Model PL-220 instrument. The column and carousel compartments are operated at 140 °C, Three Polymer Laboratories 10-micron Mixed-B columns are used. The solvent is 1,2,4 trichlorobenzene. The samples are prepared at a concentration of 0.1 grams of polymer in 50 milliliters of solvent containing 200 ppm of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Samples are prepared by agitating lightly for 2 hours at 160°C. The injection volume used is 100 microliters and the flow rate is 1.0 ml/minute.<br>
Calibration of the GPC column set is performed with 21 narrow molecular weight distribution polystyrene standards with molecular weights ranging from 580 to 8,400,000, arranged in 6 "cocktail" mixtures with at least a decade of separation between individual molecular weights. The standards are purchased from Polymer Laboratories (Shropshire, UK). The polystyrene standards are prepared at 0.025 grams in 50 milliliters of solvent for molecular weights equal to or greater than 1,000,000, and 0.05 grams in 50 milliliters of solvent for molecular weights less than<br><br>
1,000,000. The polystyrene standards are dissolved at 80°C with gentle agitation for 30 minutes. The narrow standards mixtures are run first and in order of decreasing highest molecular weight component to minimize degradation. The polystyrene standard peak molecular weights are converted to polyethylene molecular weights using the following equation (as described in Williams and Ward, J. Polvm. ScL Polvm.

The sample is prepared by stacking 25.4 mm diameter round discs of 3.2 mm, 2.0 mm, and 0.25 mm thickness until a total thickness of 12.7 mm is reached. The discs are cut from 12.7 C1-4x 12.7 C1-4compression molded plaques molded with a hot press under the following conditions: zero pressure for 3 min at 190°C, followed by 86 MPa for 2 min at 190°C, followed by cooling inside the press with cold running water at 86 MPa. Density<br>

The pellets are placed between polytetrafluoroethylene sheets, heated at 190 DC at 55 psi (380 kPa) for 3 min, followed by 1.3 MPa for 3 min, and then 2.6 MPa for 3 min. The film is then cooled in the press with running cold water at 1.3 MPa for 1 min. The compression molded films are used for optical measurements, tensile behavior, recovery, and stress relaxation.<br>

Mechanical Properties - Tensile, Hysteresis, and Tear<br>
Stress-strain behavior in uniaxial tension is measured using ASTM D 1708 microtensile specimens. Samples are stretched with an Instron at 500 % min-1 at 21°C. Tensile strength and elongation at break are reported from an average of 5 specimens.<br>
100% and 300% Hysteresis is determined from cyclic loading to 100% and 300% strains using ASTM D 1708 microtensile specimens with an Instron™ instrument. The sample is loaded and unloaded at 267 % min"1 for 3 cycles at 21°C. Cyclic experiments at 300% and 80°C are conducted using an environmental chamber. In the 80 °C experiment, the sample is allowed to equilibrate for 45 minutes at the test temperature before testing. In the 21 °CS 300% strain cyclic experiment, the retractive stress at 150% strain from the first unloading cycle is recorded. Percent recovery for all experiments are calculated from the first unloading cycle using the strain at which the load returned to the base line. The percent recovery is defined as:<br>
%Recovery = -^	-xl00<br>
sf<br>
where Ef is the strain taken for cyclic loading and £s is the strain where the load returns to the baseline during the 1st unloading cycle.<br>
Stress relaxation is measured at 50 percent strain and 37 °C for 12 hours using an Instron™ instrument equipped with an environmental chamber. The gauge geometry was 76 mm x 25 mm x 0.4 mm. After equilibrating at 37°C for 45 min in the environmental chamber, the sample was stretched to 50% strain at 333% min"1. Stress was recorded as a function of time for 12 hours. The percent stress relaxation after 12 hours was calculated using the formula:<br>
% Stress Relaxation =   ° "  12 x 100<br>
where L0 is the load at 50% strain at 0 time and Ln is the load at 50 percent strain after 12 hours.<br>
Tensile notched tear experiments are carried out on samples having a density of 0.88 g/cc or less using an Instron™ instrument. The geometry consists of a gauge section of 76 mm x 13 mm x 0.4 mm with a 2 mm notch cut into the sample at half the specimen length. The sample is stretched at 508 mm min"1 at 21 °C until it breaks. The tear energy is calculated as the area under the stress-elongation curve up to strain at maximum load. An average of at least 3 specimens are reported. TMA<br>
Thermal Mechanical Analysis (Penetration Temperature) is conducted on 30mm diameter x 3.3 mm thick, compression molded discs, formed at 180°C and 10 MPa molding pressure for 5 minutes and then air quenched. The instrument used is a TMA 7, brand available from Perkin-Elmer. In the test, a probe with 1.5 mm radius tip (P/N N519-0416) is applied to the surface of the<br><br>
sample disc with IN force. The temperature is raised at 5°C/min from 25°C. The probe penetration distance is measured as a function of temperature. The experiment ends when the probe has penetrated 1 mm into the sample. DMA<br>
Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) is measured on compression molded disks formed in a hot press at 180°C at 10 MPa pressure for 5 minutes and then water cooled in the press at 90°C / min. Testing is conducted using an ARES controlled strain rheometer (TA instruments) equipped with dual cantilever fixtures for torsion testing.<br>
A 1.5mm plaque is pressed and cut in a bar of dimensions 32x12mm. The sample is clamped at both ends between fixtures separated by 10mm (grip separation AL) and subjected to successive temperature steps from -100°C to 200°C (5°C per step). At each temperature the torsion modulus G5 is measured at an angular frequency of 10 rad/s, the strain amplitude being maintained between 0.1 percent and 4 percent to ensure that the torque is sufficient and that the measurement remains in the linear regime.<br>
An initial static force of 10 g is maintained (auto-tension mode) to prevent slack in the sample when thermal expansion occurs. As a consequence, the grip separation AL increases with the temperature, particularly above the melting or softening point of the polymer sample. The test stops at the maximum temperature or when the gap between the fixtures reaches 65 mm. Pellet Blocking Strength<br>
Pellets (150 g) are loaded into a 2" (5 cm) diameter hollow cylinder that is made of two halves held together by a hose clamp. A 2.75 lb (1.25 kg) load is applied to the pellets in the cylinder at 45 °C for 3 days. After 3 days, the pellets loosely consolidate into a cylindrical shaped plug. The plug is removed from the form and the pellet blocking force measured by loading the cylinder of blocked pellets in compression using an Instron™ instrument to measure the compressive force needed to break the cylinder into pellets. Melt Index<br>
Melt index, or I2, is measured in accordance with ASTM D 1238, Condition 190°C/2.16 kg. Melt index, or Ii0 is also measured in accordance with ASTM D 1238, Condition 190°C/10 kg. ATREF<br>
Analytical temperature rising elution fractionation (ATREF) analysis is conducted according to the method described in USP 4,798,081. The composition to be analyzed is dissolved in trichlorobenzene and allowed to crystallize in a column containing an inert support (stainless steel shot) by, slowly reducing the temperature to 20°C at a cooling rate of 0J°C/miu. The column is equipped with an infrared detector. An ATREF chromatogram curve is then generated by eluting<br><br>
the crystallized polymer sample from the column by slowly increasing the temperature of the eluting solvent (trichlorobenzene) from 20 to 120°C at a rate of 1.5°C/min. Polymer Fractionation by TREF<br>
Large-scale TREF fractionation is carried by dissolving 15-20 g of polymer in 2 liters of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB)by stirring for 4 hours at 160°C. The polymer solution is forced by 15 psig (100 kPa) nitrogen onto a 3 inch by 4 foot (7.6 C1-4x 12 cm) steel column packed with a 60:40 (v:v) mix of 30-40 mesh (600-425 µm) spherical, technical quality glass beads (available from Potters Industries, HC 30 Box 20, Brownwood, TX, 76801) and stainless steel, 0.028" (0.7mm) diameter cut wire shot (available form Pellets, Inc. 63 Industrial Drive, North Tonawanda, NY, 14120). The column is immersed in a thermally controlled oil jacket, set initially to 160 °C. The column is first cooled ballistically to 125 °C, then slow cooled to 20 °C at 0.04 °C per minute and held for one hour. Fresh TCB is introduced at about 65 ml/min while the temperature is increased at 0.167 °C per minute.<br>
Approximately 2000 ml portions of eluant from the preparative TREF column are collected in a 16 station, heated fraction collector. The polymer is concentrated in each fraction using a rotary evaporator until about 50 to 100 ml of the polymer solution remains. The concentrated solutions are allowed to stand overnight before adding excess methanol, filtering, and rinsing (approx. 300-500 ml of methanol including the final rinse). The filtration step is performed on a 3 position vacuum assisted filtering station using 5.0 pm polytetrafluoroethylene coated filter paper (available from Osmonics Inc., Cat# Z50WP04750). The filtrated fractions are dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 60 °C and weighed on an analytical balance before further testing.<br>
I3CNMR Analysis<br>
The samples are prepared by adding approximately 3g of a 50/50 mixture of tetrachloroethane-d /orthodichlorobenzene to 0.4 g sample in a 10 nun NMR tube. The samples are dissolved and homogenized by heating the tube and its contents to 150°C. The data is collected using a JEOL Eclipse™ 400MHz spectrometer or a Varian Unity Plus™ 400MHz spectrometer, corresponding to a 13C resonance frequency of 100.5 MHz. The data is acquired using 4000 transients per data file with a 6 second pulse repetition delay. To achieve minimum signal-to-noise for quantitative analysis, multiple data files are added together. The spectral width is 25,000 Hz with a minimum file size of 32K data points. The samples are analyzed at 130 °C in a 10 mm broad band probe. The comonomer incorporation is determined using Randall's triad method (Randall, J.C.; JMS-Rev. MacromoL Chem. Phys, C29, 201-317 (1989).<br><br>
Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)<br>
Sections are collected from the sample material using a Leica UCT™ microtome with a FC crycschamber operated at -80 °C. A diamond knife is used to section all sample material to a thickness of 120 nm. Sections are placed on freshly cleaved mica surfaces, and mounted on standard AFM specimen metal support disks with a double carbon tape. The sections are examined with a DI NanoScope IV™ Multi-Mode AFM, in tapping mode with phase detection. Nano-sensor tips are used in all experiments.<br>

General High Throughput Parallel Polymerization Conditions<br>
Polymerizations are conducted using a high throughput, parallel polymerization reactor (PPR) available from Symyx technologies, Inc. and operated substantially according to USP's 6,248,540, 6,030,917, 6,362,309, 6,306,658, and 6,316,663. Ethylene copolymerizations are conducted at 130°C and 200 psi (1.4 MPa) with ethylene on demand using 1.2 equivalents of<br><br>
cocatalyst 1 based on total catalyst used (1.1 equivalents when MMAO is present). A series of<br>
polymerizations are conducted in a parallel pressure reactor (PPR) comprised of 48 individual<br>
reactor cells in a 6 x 8 array that are fitted with a pre-weighed glass tube. The working volume in<br>
each reactor cell is 6000 \iL. Each cell is temperature and pressure controlled with stirring provided<br>
by individual stirring paddles. The monomer gas and quench gas are plumbed directly into the PPR<br>
unit and controlled by automatic valves. Liquid reagents are robotically added to each reactor cell<br>
by syringes and the reservoir solvent is mixed alkanes. The order of addition is mixed alkanes<br>
solvent (4 ml), ethylene, 1-octene comonomer (1 ml), cocatalyst 1 or cocatalyst 1/MMAO mixture,<br>
shuttling agent, and catalyst or catalyst mixture. When a mixture of cocatalyst 1 and MMAO or a<br>
mixture of two catalysts is used, the reagents are premixed in a small vial immediately prior to<br>
addition to the reactor. When a reagent is omitted in an experiment, the above order of addition is<br>
otherwise maintained. Polymerizations are conducted for approximately 1-2 minutes, until<br>
predetermined ethylene consumptions are reached. After quenching with CO, the reactors are<br>
cooled and the glass tubes are unloaded. The tubes are transferred to a centrifuge/vacuum drying<br>
unit, and dried for 12 hours at 60 °C. The tubes containing dried polymer are weighed and the<br>
difference between this weight and the tare weight gives the net yield of polymer. Results are<br>
contained in Table 1. In Table 1 and elsewhere in the application, comparative compounds are<br>
indicated by an asterisk (*).<br>
Examples 1-4 demonstrate,the synthesis of linear block copolymers by the present invention<br>
as evidenced by the formation of a very narrow MWD, essentially monomodal copolymer when<br>
DEZ is present and a bimodal, broad molecular weight distribution product (a mixture of separately<br>
produced polymers) in the absence of DEZ. Due to the fact that Catalyst (Al) is known to<br>
incorporate more octene than Catalyst (Bl), the different blocks or segments of the resulting<br>
copolymers of the invention are distinguishable based on branching or density.<br>

It may be seen the polymers produced according to the invention have a relatively narrow polydispersity (Mw/Mn) and larger block-copolymer content (trimer, tetramer, or larger) than polymers prepared in the absence of the shuttling agent<br>

The DSC curve in Figure 3 for the polymer of example 1 shows a 115.7°C melting point (Tm) with a heat of fusion of 158.1 J/g. The corresponding CRYSTAF curve shows the tallest peak at 34.5°C with a peak area of 52.9 percent. The difference between the DSC Tm and the Tcrystaf is 81.2°C.<br>
The DSC curve in Figure 4 for the polymer of example 2 shows a peak with a 109.7°C melting point (Tm) with a heat of fusion of 214.0 J/g. The corresponding CRYSTAF curve shows the tallest peak at 46,2°C with a peak area of 57.0 percent. The difference between the DSC Tm and the Tcrystaf is 63.5°C.<br>
The DSC curve in Figure 5 for the polymer of example 3 shows a peak with a 120.7°C melting point (Tm) with a heat of fusion of 160.1 J/g. The corresponding CRYSTAF curve shows the tallest peak at 66.1°C with a peak area of 71.8 percent. The difference between the DSC Tm and the Tcrystaf is 54.6°C.<br>
The DSC curve in Figure 6 for the polymer of example 4 shows a peak with a 104.5°C melting point (Tm) with a heat of fusion of 170.7 J/g. The corresponding CRYSTAF curve shows the tallest peak at 30 °C with a peak area of 18.2 percent. The difference between the DSC Tm and the Tcrystaf is 74.5°C.<br>
The DSC curve in Figure 22 (comparative A) shows a 90.0ºC melting point (Tm) with a heat of fusion of 86.7 J/g. The corresponding CRYSTAF curve shows the tallest peak at 48.5°C with a peak area of 29.4 percent. Both of these values are consistent with a resin that is low in density. The difference between the DSC Tm and the Tcrystaf is 41.8°C.<br>
The DSC curve in Figure 23 (Comparative B) shows a 129.8°C melting point (Tm) with a heat of fusion of 237.0 J/g. The corresponding CRYSTAF curve shows the tallest peak at 82.4°C with a peak area of 83.7 percent. Both of these values are consistent with a resin that is high in density. The difference between the DSC Tm and the Tcrystaf is 47.4°C.<br>
The DSC curve in Figure 24 (Comparative C) shows a 125.3°C melting point (Tm) with a heat of fusion of 143.0 J/g. The corresponding CRYSTAF curve shows the tallest peak at 81.8 °C with a peak area of 34.7 percent as well as a lower crystalline peak at 52.4 °C. The separation between the two peaks is consistent with the presence of a high crystalline and a low crystalline polymer. The difference between the DSC Tm and the Tcrystaf is 43.5°C.<br><br>
Examples 5-19, Comparatives D-F, Continuous Solution Polymerization. Catalyst A1/B2 + D~EZ Continuous solution polymerizations are carried out in a computer controlled autoclave reactor equipped with an internal stirrer. Purified mixed alkanes solvent (Isopar™ E available from ExxonMobil, Inc.), ethylene at 2.70 lbs/hour (1.22 kg/hour), 1-octene, and hydrogen (where used) are supplied to a 3.8 L reactor equipped with a jacket for temperature control and an internal thermocouple. The solvent feed to the reactor is measured by a mass-flow controller. A variable speed diaphragm pump controls the solvent flow rate and pressure to the reactor. At the discharge of the pump, a side stream is taken to provide flush flows for the catalyst and cocatalyst 1 injection lines and the reactor agitator. These flows are measured by Micro-Motion mass flow meters and controlled by control valves or by the manual adjustment of needle valves. The remaining solvent is combined with 1-octene, ethylene, and hydrogen (where used) and fed to the reactor. A mass flow controller is used to deliver hydrogen to the reactor as needed. The temperature of the solvent/monomer solution is controlled by use of a heat exchanger before entering the reactor. This stream enters the bottom of the reactor. The catalyst component solutions are metered using pumps and mass flow meters and are combined with the catalyst flush solvent and introduced into the bottom of the reactor. The reactor is run liquid-full at 500 psig (3.45 MPa) with vigorous stirring. Product is removed through exit lines at the top of the reactor. All exit lines from the reactor are steam traced and insulated. Polymerization is stopped by the addition of a small amount of water into the exit line along with any stabilizers or other additives and passing the mixture through a static mixer. The product stream is then heated by passing through a heat exchanger before devolatilization. The polymer product is recovered by extrusion using a devolatilizing extruder and water cooled pelletizer. Process details and results are contained in Table 2. Selected polymer properties are provided in Table 3.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

The separation between the two peaks is consistent with the presence of both a high crystalline and a low crystalline polymer. The delta between the DSC Tm and the Tcrystaf is 47.2°C.<br>
Physical Property Testing<br>
Polymer samples are evaluated for physical properties such as high temperature resistance properties, as evidenced by TMA temperature testing, pellet blocking strength, high temperature recovery, high temperature compression set and storage modulus ratio, G'(25°C)/G'(100°C). Several commercially available polymers are included hi the tests: Comparative G* is a substantially linear ethylene/l-octene copolymer (AFFINITY™ KC8852G, available from The Dow Chemical Company), Comparative H* is an elastorneric, substantially linear ethylene/ 1-octene copolymer (AFFINITY™ EG8100, available from The Dow Chemical Company), Comparative I is a substantially linear ethylene/l-octene copolymer (Affinity PL1840, available from The Dow Chemical Company), Comparative J is ahydrogenated styrene/butadiene/styrene triblock copolymer (Kraton™ G1652, available from KRATON Polymers), Comparative K is a thermoplastic vulanizate (TPV, a polyolefin blend containing dispersed therein a crosslinked elastomer). Results are presented in Table 4.<br><br><br>
Ill Table 4, Comparative F (which is a physical blend of the two polymers resulting from simultaneous polymerizations using catalyst Al and Bl) has a 1 mm penetration temperature of about 70°C, while Examples 5-9 have a 1 mm penetration temperature of 100°C or greater. Further, examples 10-19 all have a 1 mm penetration temperature of greater than 85°C, with most having 1 mm TMA temperature of greater than 90°C or even greater than 100°C. This shows that the novel polymers have better dimensional stability at higher temperatures compared to a physical blend. Comparative J (a commercial SEBS) has a good 1 mm TMA temperature of about 107°C, but it has very poor (high temperature 70°C) compression set of about 100 percent and it also failed to recover (sample broke) during a high temperature (80°C) 300 percent strain recovery. Thus the exemplified polymers have a unique combination of properties unavailable even in some commercially available, high performance thermoplastic elastomers.<br>
Similarly, Table 4 shows a low (good) storage modulus ratio, Gs(25oC)/G'(100°C), for the invented polymers of 6 or less, whereas a physical blend (Comparative F) has a storage modulus ratio of 9 and a random ethylene/octene copolymer (Comparative G) of similar density has a storage<br><br>
modulus ratio an order ot magnitude greater (89). It is desirable that the storage modulus ratio of a polymer be as close to 1 as possible. Such polymers will be relatively unaffected by temperature, and fabricated articles made from such polymers can be usefully employed over a broad temperature range. This feature of low storage modulus ratio and temperature independence is particularly useful in elastomer applications such as in pressure sensitive adhesive formulations.<br>
The data in Table 4 also demonstrate that the polymers of the invention possess improved pellet blocking strength. In particular, Example 5 has a pellet blocking strength of 0 MPa, meaning it is free flowing under the conditions tested, compared to Comparatives F and G which show considerable blocking. Blocking strength is important since bulk shipment of polymers having large blocking strengths can result in product clumping or sticking together upon storage or shipping, resulting in poor handling properties.<br>
High temperature (70°C) compression set for the invented polymers is generally good, meaning generally less than about 80 percent, preferably less than about 70 percent and especially less than about 60 percent. In contrast, Comparatives F, G, H and J all have a 70°C compression set of 100 percent (the maximum possible value, indicating no recovery). Good high temperature compression set (low numerical values) is especially needed for applications such as gaskets, window profiles, o-rings, and the like.<br><br><br><br>
Table 5 shows results for mechanical properties for the new polymers as well as for various comparison polymers at ambient temperatures. It may be seen that the present polymers have very good abrasion resistance when tested according to ISO 4649, generally showing a volume loss of less than about 90 mm3, preferably less than about 80 mm3, and especially less than about 50 mm3. In this test, higher numbers indicate higher volume loss and consequently lower abrasion resistance.<br>
Tear strength as measured by tensile notched tear strength of the invented polymers is generally 1000 mJ or higher, as shown in Table 5. Tear strength for the invented polymers can be as high as 3000 mJ, or even as high as 5000 mJ. Comparative polymers generally have tear strengths no higher than 750 mJ.<br>
Table 5 also shows that the polymers of the invention have better retractive stress at 150 percent strain (demonstrated by higher retractive stress values) than some of the comparative samples. Comparative Examples F, G and H have retractive stress value at 150 percent strain of 400 kPa or less, while the invented polymers have retractive stress values at 150 percent strain of 500 kPa (Ex. 11) to as high as about 1100 kPa (Ex. 17). Polymers having higher than 150 percent retractive stress values would be quite useful for elastic applications, such as elastic fibers and fabrics, especially nonwoven fabrics. Other applications include diaper, hygiene, and medical garment waistband applications, such'as tabs and elastic bands.<br>
Table 5 also shows that stress relaxation (at 50 percent strain) is also improved (less) for the invented polymers as compared to, for example, Comparative G. Lower stress relaxation means that the polymer retains its force better in applications such as diapers and other garments where retention of elastic properties over long time periods at body temperatures is desired.<br><br><br>
The optical properties reported in Table 6 are based on compression molded films<br>
substantially lacking in orientation. Optical properties of the polymers may be varied over wide<br>
i ranges, due to variation in crystallite size, resulting from variation in the quantity of chain shuttling<br>
agent employed in the polymerization.<br>
Extractions of Multi-Block Copolymers<br>
Extraction studies of the polymers of examples 5, 7 and Comparative E are conducted. In the experiments^ the polymer sample is weighed into a glass fritted extraction thimble and fitted into a Kumagawa type extractor. The extractor with sample is purged with nitrogen, and a 500mL round bottom flask is charged with 350 mL of diethyl ether. The flask is then fitted to the extractor. The ether is heated while being stirred. Time is noted when the ether begins to condense into the thimble, and the extraction is allowed to proceed under nitrogen for 24 hours. At this time, heating is stopped and the solution is allowed to cool. Any ether remaining in the extractor is returned to the flask. The ether in the flask is evaporated under vacuum at ambient temperature, and the resulting solids are purged dry with nitrogen. Any residue is transferred to a weighed bottle using successive washes of hexane. The combined hexane washes are then evaporated with another<br><br>
nitrogen purge, and the residue dried under vacuum overnight at 40°C. Any remaining ether in the extractor is purged dry with nitrogen.<br>
A second clean round bottom flask charged with 350 mL of hexane is then connected to the extractor. The hexane is heated to reflux with stirring and maintained at reflux for 24 hours after hexane is first noticed condensing into the thimble. Heating is then stopped and the flask is allowed to cool. Any hexane remaining in the extractor is transferred back to the flask. The hexane is removed by evaporation under vacuum at ambient temperature, and any residue remaining in the flask is transferred to a weighed bottle using successive hexane washes. The hexane in the flask is evaporated by a nitrogen purge, and the residue is -vacuum dried overnight at 40°C.<br>
The polymer sample remaining in the thimble after the extractions is transferred from the thimble to a weighed bottle and vacuum dried overnight at 40°C. Results are contained in Table 7.<br><br>
Article Fabrication and Testing<br>
Fibers<br>
Polymer samples from Example 11, Example 17 and Comparative G are spun into a<br>
multifilament bundle of 24 fibers with round cross-sections in a fiber spinning line (Fourne)<br>
equipped with twenty four 25x1 mm spinnerets a spin head temperature of 260 °C, a melt<br>
temperature of 302°C and a winder speed of 70 m/min. Other spinning conditions are listed in<br>
Table 8. The denier of the resulting bundle is approximately 95 to 100 denier (g/9000 m).<br><br>
The fibers are crosslinked by passing six times through an electron beaming crosslinking machine operating at an electron beam dosage of 32 KGy/ pass, giving a total dosage level of 192 KGy. Between each pass, the fibers are cooled to -10 °C.<br>
The tensile behavior of the resulting uncrosslinked and crosslinked fibers is measured according to BISFA Test Methods for Bare Elastic Yarns, Chapter 6: Tensile Properties using<br><br>
Option C clamps and Option A test speed. Tenacity and elongation at break are reported from an average of 5 replications. The recovery behavior of the crosslinked fibers is also measured using BISFA Test Methods for Bare Elastic Yarns, Chapter 7: Viscoelastic Properties Procedure A where the fiber is cyclically loaded to 300 percent strain. The percent permanent deformation is calculated at the beginning of the 6th cycle as specified in the test method. Results of 300 percent strain cycle behavior for fibers prepared from the polymer of Example 17 are shown in Figure 30.<br>
Stress relaxation of crosslinked fibers is measured from 10 percent strain at alternating temperatures of 21 °C and 40 °C. In the experiment, 13 loops of the bundle fibers with a circumference of 324 mm are mounted to an Instron test machine by 2 hooks resulting in a gauge length of 162 mm. The sample is stretched to 10 percent strain at a rate of 100 percent elongation/minute at 21 °C and then held for 10 minutes. The subsequent thermal treatment is: 10 minutes at 40 °C in a water bath, 10 minutes at 21 °C in air, 10 minutes at 40 °C in a water bath, and 10 minutes at 21 °C in air. The time to transfer the sample between the water bath and the air cooling chamber is 6 seconds. During the entire process, the load is monitored. The percent load<br>
change from the load at 35 minutes and the load at 45 minutes is calculated using the formula:<br>
  i<br>
where L(t=35 min) and L(t=45 min) are loads at 35 minutes and 45 minutes, corresponding to the middle periods of the last 40 °C water bath and 21 °C air exposures, respectively. Results are shown in Figure 31. Fiber properties are also tabulated in Table 9.<br><br>
In fibers prepared from both Example 11 and comparative G, crosslinking results in an increase in tenacity with some loss of elongation. Both examples show similar permanent deformation of approximately 135 percent. In Figure 31, Example 11 displays lower stress relaxation than comparative G as well as being less temperature sensitive. The percent load change between 40°C (35min) and 21°C (35min) are listed in Table 9. The fiber prepared from Example 11 polymer shows only 4 percent change in load whereas the fiber of Comparative G displays 25 percent change. Low temperature sensitivity in stress relaxation is important in maintaining long shelf life of fiber bobbins. High temperature sensitivity in stress relaxation can lead to bobbin defects during storage in a non-climate controlled storage facility as the fiber alternately relaxes and<br><br>
constricts due to temperature fluctuations. This can lead to problems such as poor fiber unwinding behavior and fiber breaks in subsequent downstream processing of the fiber.<br>
Foams<br>
Samples of polymers (Ex. 5 and a commercially available ethylene/ vinylacetate copolymer, Elvax™ 460, containing 18 percent acetate and having 2 melt index, available from DuPont Inc., Comparative L) are melt compounded with an azide blowing agent (AZ130, an azodicarbonamide blowing agent available from Uniroyal, Inc.), zinc oxide, stearic acid, and a peroxide cross-linking agent (di-tert butyl peroxy isopropyl benzene peroxide, 40 percent active on silica carrier, Perkadox™ 1440 peroxide, available from Azo Nobel, Inc.) compression molded into plaques and allowed to expand.<br>
Compounding Condition: Roll mill @ 130°C 10 min,<br>
Molding and Foaming Condition: Sheets from the roll mill are preheated to 90°C in an oven for 15 minutes, then fed to a mold preheated to 180ºC, pressed (mechanical lock) and cured at this ;      temperature for 10 minutes. Upon removal, samples are allowed to expand. Formulation details (parts by weight) are contained in Table 10.<br><br>
Property testing on the resulting foam strands is conducted in the following manner: Foam density is measured according to ASTM 792, abrasion resistance is measured according to ISO 4649, shrinkage is measured at room temperature after subjecting the sample to 70°C for 40 minutes according to SATRA PM70, compression set is measured at room temperature after 1.5 and 24 hours of subjecting a sample to a temperature of 50°C for 6 hours according to ISO 815, Shore A hardness is measured according to ISO 868, split tear is measured according to SATRA TM65 standards, and tensile strength and elongation are measured according DIN 53504. Results are reported in Table 11.<br><br><br>
The results of table 11 show that the thermal and mechanical properties of the crosslinked foam prepared from example 7 are better than those of the similarly prepared foam made from Comparative L. In particular, the foam prepared from Example 7 has lower shrinkage, lower compression set, and higher split tear and elongation than the comparative foam. These properties make the polymers of the invention well suited for use in many high performance foam applications, such as shoe soles, flooring, and construction materials.<br>
Crosslinked Films using Electron Beam<br>
Compression molded films of 0.4 mm thickness are crosslinked under nitrogen atmosphere using an electron beam radiation crosslinking unit (Sterigenics, San Diego). A total electron beam dosage of 22.4 Mrad is applied using a series of 7 passes through an electronic beam at 3.2 Mrad per pass. All examples showed a gel level between 75 and 90 percent as measured according to ASTM D-2765. The mechanical properties of the irradiated films are substantially unaffected by crosslinking. Although the inventive and comparative examples exhibit similar ultimate properties, the inventive examples exhibit higher percent recovery, retractive stress and stress relaxation than the comparative samples. Results are provided in Table 12.<br><br>
Polypropylene Impact Modification<br>
A series of impact modified isotactic polypropylene blends containing 20 percent by weight ethylene/octene elastomer are prepared on a Haake compounder supplied with a Leistritz 18 mm twin screw extruder (L/D = 30), a K-TRON K2VT20 twin screw auger feeder, two refrigerated water circulation bath quench tanks, and a Berlyn PEL-2 4 blade strand chopper. The polypropylene used in all blends is PP-314-02Z hPP, available from The Dow Chemical Co. having a MFR of 2 dg/min measured according to ASTM D1238 (230°C, 2.16 kg).<br>
A water circulator is attached to the jacket of the feed throat of the extruder and set at 20°C. to keep the polymer from melting and bridging the feed throat. The extruder temperature zones are set at 120. 165,190, 230, and 230°C, respectively. The extruder die is set at 230°C. Prior to<br><br>
extrusion a lid supplied with a nitrogen line is placed on top of the feed hopper. The transition area from the feeder discharge to the extruder feed throat cone is sealed with heavy aluminum foil. The extruder is preheated, calibrated, and run empty for several minutes with nitrogen flowing throughout the system to purge it of oxygen. Three kilogram samples to be melt blended are prepared by hand tumbling the combined components in a plastic bag prior to extrusion.<br>
Injection molded test bars are prepared from polymer samples and tested for 23°C notched Izod impact according to ASTM D-256 and flexural modulus according to ASTM D-790. Injection Molding Conditions are as follows. The samples are injection molded at a melt temperature of 243°C, pack time of 6.7 sec at 3400 psi (23 MPa) pressure, hold time of 12 sec at 3400 psi (23 MPa) pressure, and total cycle time of 28 seconds. Component details and results are contained in Table 13.<br><br>
The results of Table 13 indicate that the multiblock copolymers of the invention are highly effective as impact modifiers when blended with isotactic polypropylene. Surprisingly, sample a made with the polymer of Example 5 made with a higher ratio of chain shuttling agent/ total catalyst resulting in a greater number of blocks per polymer molecule (a more "blocky" polymer) shows even lower modulus and impact strength than sample b, which is compounded with the polymer of Example 8, which is a less "blocky" polymer. This observation indicates that the level of blockiness, as controlled by the amount of chain shuttling agent, in the multi-block copolymers of the invention can strongly affect the stiffness/toughness balance of polymer blends.<br>
Additional evidence of the difference in polymer blend properties is apparent from a comparison of Figures 51-53, which are atomic force microscopic images of osmium tetroxide stained microtomed samples of injection molded plaques b, a and d, respectively. In the micrographs, the dark areas are the ethylene/octene copolymer elastomer while the lighter areas are the propylene homopolymers matrix. It can be seen from the micrographs that the multi-block copolymers made with low CSA to catalyst molar ratios (low "blockiness" copolymers) surprisingly produce core-shell morphology in the blends (Figure 51). High CSA ratio multi-block copolymers<br><br>
(Figure 52) exhibit domains of apparently solid elastomer similar in appearance to the results obtained using conventional ethylene/octene impact modifiers (Figure 53).<br>
The advantages of having the unique morphology shown in Figure 51 (occluded rubber morphology) include: excellent stiffness/toughness balance, high impact efficiency (lower amount of rubber to achieve a given toughness) and higher brush resistance (lower tendency for stress whitening). Moreover, the refractive index of the elastomer is readily varied by controlling the amount of occlusions present. This allows greater ability to match the refractive index of the elastomer with the matrix polymer, resulting in blends exhibiting a better balance of optical clarity, stiffness, toughness and brush resistance. Additionally, such blends (that is, blends comprising lower blockiness multi-block copolymers) exhibit higher heat distortion temperature, improved morphological stability (retention of polymer properties after multiple processing steps). Previously, such properties were only obtainable in blend comprising additional components, such as three component blends of elastomer, high density polyethylene and isotactic polypropylene.<br>

Samples of the resulting films are tested for normalized film tear resistance in cross direction (CD) and machine direction (MD) according to ASTM D1922; blocking properties according to ASTM D33 54-96; and coefficient of friction (COF), according to ASTM D1894-01. Results are contained in Table 15.<br><br><br>
The film prepared from the polymer of example 15 shows both higher CD and MD tear than the film made from Comparative I polymer. Additionally, it exhibits a more balanced tear (smaller CD/MD ratio) than the comparative film. Both the blocking force and COF for the film made from example 14 are lower than those for Comparative I- This combination of film properties indicates that films made from multi-block copolymers according to the invention have greater tear resistance and higher blocking resistance than films made from conventional ethylene/octene copolymers.<br>
Preparation of Oil Extended Polymer Blends<br>
Compounded blends are prepared at 190°C in a preheated Haake Rheomix™ 600 mixer of 69 ml volume. The rotors are turned at a drive speed of 50 rpm while the polymer is added and worked into a melt. By monitoring the torque of the mixer, melting is verified. Once melting of the polymer is accomplished, a paraffmic oil (RENOIL™ 625, available from Renkert Oil, Inc.) is added by syringe to the molten polymer. Once oil addition had been completed the ram seal is lowered on to the melt and mixing continued for 15 minutes. Total mass of oil and polymer is 55 grams. The rotors are then stopped, the bowl opened and the resulting blend removed, flattened and<br>
cooled in a press.<br>
Blended and unblended polymers are compression molded into 5" x 5" x 0.125" (125 x 125 x 3 mm) plaques on a laminating press under the following conditions;<br>
1)3 minutes no pressure at 190°C,<br>
2)	2 minutes at ram force 30,000 pounds (133 fcN) at 190°C, and then<br>
3)	3 minutes at 25°C at ram force 30,000 pounds (13 kN).<br>
The resulting plaques are measured for Shore A hardness with a hand held durometer and for heat resistance (TMA). Reported hardness results are the average of 5 measurements at 1 and 5 second durations made at random points on the plaque surface. Results are reported in Table 16.<br><br><br>
The results of Table 16 indicate that the inventive polymer has similar Shore A hardness as the comparative polymer but shows about 40°C higher TMA temperature. Surprisingly, the 30 weight percent oil extended polymer has a similar Shore A hardness to the 40 percent oil filled comparative polymer but has more than 30°C higher TMA temperature. This result demonstrates that the polymer of Example 17 exhibits higher oil acceptance and better retention of thermal and mechanical properties such as heat resistance as measured by TMA temperature, and tensile strength compared to the comparative H polymer. This combination of low hardness and high TMA temperature is useful in many soft elastomer applications such as soft touch molded articles and pressure sensitive adhesive applications.<br>

Example 22 Combinatorial Screening of Catalyst/ Shuttling Agent pairs<br>
i	The reaction conditions of Examples 1 -4 are substantially repeated using various catalysts,<br>
cocatalyst 1 and potential shuttling agents. Over 500 reactions are performed. The resulting ethylene/1-octene copolymers are tested for Mn and PDI and polymer production rate compared to rates obtained from a control using MMAO in place of the shuttling agent. The best compositions are then selected based on a combination of greatest molecular weight (Mn) reduction, greatest reduction in PDI, and least reduction (or actual increase) in polymerization rate. Selected combinations showing the best results (ranked by Mn reduction) are presented in Table 19.<br><br><br>
By reference to Table 19, suitable combinations of catalyst and shuttling agent may be selected. It is to be emphasized that preferred catalyst/shuttling agent combinations, in different embodiments, may be selected based on a desired objective, such as maximum reduction in Mn or improvement in production rate coupled with more modest Mn reduction. Additionally, the above results are based on a single catalyst/shuttling agent combination, whereas in practice, the effect, if any, of the presence of one or more additional catalysts or use of continuous polymerization conditions must also be considered in selecting a combination of catalysts and shuttling agent(s).<br>

A 1L reactor is charged with 600 mL of dry, deoxygenated hexane and 40 mmol of diethyl zinc and heated to 100°C under nitrogen. The reactor is then pressurized to 10 psi (70 kPa) with ethylene. A mixture of 10 µm of catalyst (Al), 10 µm-unole of catalyst (Bl), and 50 micromoles of MMAO is then injected into the reactor and ethylene fed on demand to maintain 10 psi (70 kPa) for 40 minutes. The reactor is then vented and cooled to ambient temperature and purged with nitrogen for 20 minutes. While vigorously purging with nitrogen, a stream of air is introduced into the bottom of the reactor for 1 hour and the resulting slurry stirred an additional hour. The reaction product slurry is then removed from the reactor, stirred with water and dried to give 25.5 g of polymer. GPC analysis reveals Mw = 1271, Mn = 1018, Mw/Mn = 1.25. !H NMR analysis reveals 27 percent conversion of possible zinc-terminated chain ends to hydroxyl-terminated chain ends.<br>
