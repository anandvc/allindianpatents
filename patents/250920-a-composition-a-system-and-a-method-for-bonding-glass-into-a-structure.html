SYSTEM FOR BONDING GLASS INTO A STRUCTURE<br>
Field of Invention<br>
The invention relates to compositions used to prepare glass or plastic coated with an abrasion resistant coating for bonding to a polyurethane adhesive. In another embodiment, the invention relates to systems comprising a composition used to prepare glass or plastic coated with an abrasion resistant coating for bonding to polyurethane adhesives and the polyurethane adhesives. The invention further relates to a method of bonding glass or plastic coated with an abrasion resistant coating into a structure, such as a building or an automobile, using the system of the invention.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
Glass installation is typically a three-stage process. First, a clear silane primer is applied to the glass to clean and prepare the surface for bonding. Second, a primer, which is essentially a carbon black dispersion which also contains a compound having silane and/or isocyanate functionality, often referred to as "black-out primer", is then applied over the top of the clear primer. Third, an adhesive is applied to the primed glass which is then installed into the structure. See, U.S. Patent 5,370,905, incorporated herein by reference.   The black-out primer can mar surfaces of a structure or vehicle on to which the black-out primer may be dripped during installation, U.S. Patent 5,363,944 discloses a single-step primer system. The primer comprises an aqueous primer solution containing a silane coupling agent which is used to facilitate adhesion of a polymer to a non-porous inorganic substrate such as metal or glass. The silane coupling agent has an amino or a mercapto functional group which is capable of reacting with functional groups of the polymer and also has one or more hydrolyzable groups which reacts with the free-hydroxyl groups on the surface of the substrate. This system requires long dry times before an adhesive can be applied. For many commercial operations, such long dry times are unacceptable. This is especially true in automotive assembly plants wherein each operation needs to be completed in a short period of time.<br><br>
Yao et al. U.S. Patent 6,511,752 discloses the method for adhering a polyurethane based adhesive to a substrate which comprises applying an aqueous primer solution onto Hie substrate which comprises water, an amino titanate compound, and preferably, an epoxy silane having at least one epoxy group and at least two alkoxy groups. Thereafter, a polyurethane adhesive is applied to the primer treated surface. A reaction product is formed of the primer and polyurethane.<br>
In order for a primer and adhesive system to be commercially viable, that system must provide a durable bond. "Durable bond" means that the adhesive holds the window into the structure for a period of years. As the structure to which window glass or plastic coated with an abrasion resistant coating is traditionally bonded lasts for a significant number of years, it is expected that the bond holding the glass or coated plastic into a structure also lasts a significant number of years. What is needed is a system which bonds glass or coated plastic into a structure which does not require black-out primer, which provides durable adhesion and which does not require long dry times between application of the primer and application of the adhesive. What is further needed is a system which allows for durable adhesion of the adhesives to the substrate surface.<br>
Summary of Invention<br>
The invention is a composition comprising a) one or more organotitanates having four ligands wherein the ligands are hydrocarbyl, optionally containing one or more functional groups having one or more heteroatoms selected fiom the group comprising oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur wherein two or more of the ligands may form a cyclic structure; b) one or more mercaptosilanes; c) one or more polyaminosilanes; d) one or more secondary aminosilanes; and e) a solvent which dissolves the components of the composition. This composition is referred to as a clear primer hereinafter.<br>
In another embodiment the invention is a system for bonding glass or a plastic coated with an abrasion resistant coating to a substrate which comprises a clear primer according to the invention; and an adhesive comprising an isocyanate functional prepolymer and a catalyst for the cure of the isocyanate functional prepolymer.<br><br>
In another embodiment the invention is a method comprising<br>
A)	applying a clear primer according to the invention to the surface of a glass or an abrasion resistant coated plastic along the portion of the glass or coated plastic to be bonded into a structure;<br>
B)	applying a polyisocyaaate functional adhesive composition to the surface of the glass or coated plastic along the portion of the glass or coated plastic to be bonded into the structure to which the clear primer was previously applied; and<br>
C)	contacting the glass or coated plastic with the structure with the adhesive disposed between the glass or coated plastic and the structure.<br>
The invention also comprises a structure having a window bonded to it using a clear primer of the invention and preferably a polyisocyanate functional adhesive composition. Preferably such structure is a building or an automobile. The invention provides a clear primer system and bonding system which bonds glass or plastic coated with an abrasion resistant coating into a structure without the need for a black-out primer. The system provides durable adhesion to the substrate. The clear primer dries rapidly allowing for application of the adhesive to the treated surface, in a short of period of time after the application of a clear primer. This system meets with the timing needs of an automobile assembly plant The compositions and systems of the invention work well on a variety of frits (also referred to as ceramic enamels) deposited on glass or plastic coated with an abrasion resistant coating. In particular, they work on press bent and sag bent glass.<br>

The clear primer composition of the invention further comprises a solvent The solvents which are relatively inert towards the components of the composition and which volatilize rapidly after application of the composition to the surface of a substrate are preferably used. It is desirable that the solvent volatilize away from the surface of a substrate in sufficient<br><br>
tjnie to allow application of the adhesive within the normal time constraints of assembly or fabrication under commercial conditions. For example, in the circumstances where a window is being installed in a vehicle on an assembly line, it is desirable that the solvent volatilize away before the application of adhesive and within the time period allotted for installation of the window into the vehicle without holding up the assembly line. Preferably, the substrate surface is dry before the adhesive is applied. Preferably, the solvent has volatilized away, in about 30 seconds or less, more preferably 20 seconds or less and most preferably 10 seconds or less. Preferable solvents include aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons and low molecular weight alcohols and glycols.

Preferably, the aromatic hydrocarbons contain about 6 to about 8 carbon atoms. Preferred aromatic hydrocarbons include toluene and xylene. Preferred alcohols and glycols useful include methanol, ethanol, n-propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol and isobutyl alcohol. Among preferred solvents are toluene, xylene and heptane. The solvent is present in sufficient amount to dissolve the components of the composition and not so much as to lengthen the drying time of the solvent after application to the substrate surface. Preferably, the solvent is present in an amount based on the total weight of the clear primer composition of about 0 weight percent or greater, more preferably about 45 weight percent or greater and most preferably about 60 weight percent or greater. Preferably, the solvent is present in an amount based on the total weight of the clear primer composition of about 99.5 percent by weight or less, more preferably about 95 percent by weight or less and most preferably about 90 percent by weight or less.<br>
The clear primer may further contain a component that fluoresces when illuminated by ultraviolet light. Fluorescing components are readily available from numerous sources, for example Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wisconsin. As a specific example, the fluorescing component can be Uvitex OB brand fluorescing agent available from Ciba Specialty<br><br>
Chemicals, Tarrytown, New York (USA). The amount of fluorescing agent added to the primer ' must bfe sufficient so that the area of the window treated with the primer is apparent when the window is illuminated with an ultraviolet light.<br>
As used herein, the term "durable bond" refers to the bond of the adhesive to the substrate surface wherein the bond lasts for a significant portion of the life, or the entire life, of the structure. The durability of a bond is typically predicted utilizing an accelerated aging test. For purposes of this invention, the following accelerated aging tests will be used as a predictor for durability of a bond. The clear primers are applied by saturating a cheesecloth with the solution and applying a thin wet coating to the window surface. Twenty seconds after the application, the adhesive is applied in a bead of 8.8 mm in width and 6.8 mm in thickness down the length of the substrate. The adhesive is allowed to cure for 7 days at 23°C and 50 percent Relative Humidity, and then the sample is placed into a water bath and held at 90°C. After the indicated times the sample is removed from the water bath, allowed to rest at least 15 minutes, and then tested. The adhesive/substrate interface is scored with a sharp knife as the adhesive is being pulled back. The results are listed as the percent of cohesive failure (failure within the urethane adhesive) with the desired result being 100 percent CF (cohesive failure). The long-term durability is expressed as the number of days required to lose 100 percent CF. As used herein, a durable bond means that the adhesive under the above-mentioned test exhibits a performance of about 5 days or greater, more preferably about 6 days or greater and most preferably about 8 days or greater.<br>

For formulating adhesive compositions, the one or more prepolymers and the silane containing compound, if present, are combined, preferably with fillers and additives known in the prior art for use in elastomeric compositions. By the addition of such materials, physical properties such as viscosity, flow rate, sag, and the like can be modified. However, to prevent premature hydrolysis of the moisture sensitive groups of the polymer, the filler should be thoroughly dried before admixture therewith. Exemplary filler materials and additives include materials such as carbon black, titanium dioxide, clays, calcium carbonate, surface treated silicas, ultraviolet stabilizers, antioxidants, and the like. This list, however, is not comprehensive and is given merely as illustrative. The fillers are preferably present in an amount of about 15 percent by weight or greater based on the adhesive. The fillers are<br><br>
preferably present in an amount of about 70 percent by weight or less based on the adhesive, more preferably 60 percent by weight or less and even more preferably 50 percent by weight or<br>
less.<br>
The adhesive composition also preferably contains one or more plasticizers or solvents to modify rheological properties to a desired consistency. Such materials are preferably free of water, inert to isocyanate groups, and compatible with the polymer. Such material may be added to the reaction mixtures for preparing the prepolymer, or to the mixture for preparing the final adhesive composition, but is preferably added to the reaction mixtures for preparing the prepolymer, so that such mixtures may be more easily mixed and handled. Suitable plasticizers and solvents are well-known in the art and include dioctyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, a partially hydrogenated terpene commercially available as "HB-40", trioctyl phosphate, epoxy plasticizers, toluene-sulfamide, chloroparaffins, adipic acid esters, castor oil, xylene, l-methyl-2-pyrolidinone and toluene. The amount of plasticizer used is that amount sufficient to give the desired rheological properties and disperse the components in the adhesive composition. Preferably the plasticizer is present in an amount of about 0 percent by weight or greater based on the weight of the adhesive composition, more preferably about 5 percent by weight or greater and most preferably about 10 percent by weight or greater. The plasticizer is preferably present in an amount of about 45 percent by weight or less based on the weight of the adhesive composition, more preferably about 40 percent by weight or less and most preferably about 20 pails by weight or less.<br>
The adhesive composition of this invention may be formulated by blending the components together using means well-known in the art. Generally the components are blended in a suitable mixer. Such blending is preferably conducted in an inert atmosphere and in the absence of atmospheric moisture to prevent premature reaction. It may be advantageous to add any plasticizers to the reaction mixture for preparing the isocyanate containing prepolymer so that such mixture may be easily mixed and handled. Alternatively, the plasticizers can be added during blending of all the components. Once the adhesive composition is formulated, it is packaged in a suitable container such that it is protected from<br><br>
ahnospheric moisture. Contact with atmospheric moisture could result in premature cross-<br>
i linking of the polyurethane prepolymer-contaming isocyanate groups.<br>
The clear primer composition is prepared hy contacting the silanes and titanates in solvent and mixing to form a clear solution.<br>
In general, the method of bonding glass, coated plastic or a window into a substrate comprises contacting the clear primer composition of the invention with the surface of the glass or coated plastic and allowing the solvent of the clear primer composition to volatilize away. Thereafter, a suitable adhesive is applied to the surface of the glass or coated plastic, along the portion of the glass or coated plastic which is to be bonded to the structure. The adhesive is thereafter contacted with the second substrate such that the adhesive is disposed between the glass and the second substrate. The adhesive is allowed to cure to form a durable bond between the glass or coated plastic and the substrate. In some embodiments, the glass or clear plastic has an opaque coating about the perimeter of the glass or clear plastic. This is commonly referred to as a frit For glass the coating is an inorganic enamel. Hie clear primer improves the ability of the described adhesive systems to bond to such coatings.<br>
The clear primer composition may be applied by any means well known in the art. It may be applied manually by brushing, rolling or applying a cloth containing the composition to the surface of a substrate to which the adhesive will be applied such that a sufficient amount of the primer composition is applied to the surface. Preferably, the clear primer composition is applied using a robot. Useful robots for this operation are for example is M710I, available from Fanuc Robotics America, of Rochester Hills, Michigan used with an automated primer dispense applicator supplied by Nordson Coiporation, Amherst, Ohio. The primer is applied such that there is at least about 8 to about 15 seconds of dry time after priming. The adhesive is applied at least 20 seconds after application of the adhesive. The system of the invention can be used to bond glass or plastic coated with an abrasion resistant coating, to other substrates such as metal or plastics. The plastic coated with an abrasion resistant coating can be any plastic which is clear, such as polycarbonate, acrylics, hydrogenated polystyrene or hydrogenated styrene conjugated diene block copolymers having greater than 50 percent styrene content The coating can comprise any coating which is abrasion resistant such<br><br>
&amp;s a polysiloxane coating. Preferably, the coating has an ultraviolet pigmented light blocking additive. Preferably, the glass or plastic window has an opaque coating disposed in the region to be contacted with the adhesive to block UV light from reaching the adhesive.<br>
In some embodiments, the adhesive composition is applied to the glass or coated plastic shortly after application of the clear primer composition. The minimum time between application of the clear primer and application of the adhesive is that time necessary for the solvent from the clear primer to volatilize away. In some embodiments, the clear primer adhesive composition may be applied in a different location from the location of application of the clear primer, for instance in a different part of the plant or a different plant. Further, the plants can be many miles apart, for instance hundreds or thousands of miles apart. The adhesive composition may be applied much later than the clear primer. In some embodiments, the time between application of the clear primer and application of the adhesive composition can be about 5 days or greater, or even 30 days or greater. .The time period between application of the clear primer and the application of the adhesive composition can be about 90 days or less and preferably about 60 days or less.<br>
One process for applying a primer to a window comprises the steps of: (a) directing light onto the window to illuminate a portion of the window; (b) applying a primer along the illuminated portion of the window. If the clear primer contains a component that evaporates, then the process can further include the step of forming an infrared image of the window as the component evaporates to indicate the area of application of the clear primer. If the clear primer contains a component that fluoresces when illuminated by ultraviolet light, then the process can fiirther include the step of illuminating the window with ultraviolet light to indicate the area of application of the clear primer. These processes may be performed as disclosed in commonly assigned Allam et aL, U.S. Patent Publication 2003/0232152 and PCT Application WO03/106579, filed June, 11,2003, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The system of the invention is used to bond porous and nonporous substrates together. The adhesive composition is applied to a substrate and the adhesive on the first substrate is thereafter contacted with a second substrate. Thereafter the adhesive is exposed to curing conditions. In a preferred embodiment one substrate is glass or coated plastic and the<br><br>
other substrate is a plastic, metal, fiberglass or composite substrate which may optionally be painted. This method is especially effective for substrates painted with an acid resistant paint. Generally the primers and adhesives are applied at ambient temperature in the presence of atmospheric moisture. Exposure to atmospheric moisture is sufficient to result in curing of the adhesive. Curing may be further accelerated by applying heat to the curing adhesive by means of convection heat, or microwave heating.<br>

Specific Embodiments of Invention<br>
The following examples are included for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. Unless otherwise stated, all parts and percentages are by weight.<br>
Preparation of Clear Primers<br>
The formulations are listed as either parts of the solution or as a percent based upon solids and are prepared by simply mixing the appropriate amounts of the desired material. The primer is prepared by adding a solvent to a pre-dried glass bottle. Each silane is added to the bottle and the bottle shaken for 2 minutes on a shaker. Finally, the titanate is added and the whole mixture is shaken for 3 minutes.<br>
The adhesion experiments were performed on three ceramic enamels on the surface of a glass coupon. Two of these, a bismuth and zinc containing frit (Frit 1) and bismuth and zinc containing frit further containing lithium and sulfur (Frit 2), are used on press-bent glass. The third was a bismuth and zinc containing frit (Frit 3), which is used on sag-bent glass. Each of these three ceramic enamels is available from Ferro Corporation. All glass coupons were used as received without any additional cleaning or pretreatment other than the application of the indicated clear wipe.<br>
The clear primer compositions were applied by saturating cheesecloth with the solution and applying a thin wet coating to the ceramic enamel surface. Twenty seconds after the application of the clear primer, the adhesive, was applied in a bead of 8 mm width and 6-8 mm thickness down the length of the substrate. The adhesive is allowed to cure for 7 days at 23°C and 50 percent RH before testing. The adhesion test is a modified peel test called the Quick Knife Adhesion (QKA) test. In this test the adhesive/substrate interface is scored with a sharp knife as.the adhesive is being pulled back. The results are listed as the percent of cohesive failure (failure within the methane adhesive) with the desired result being 100 percent CF (cohesive failure). The alternative failure mode is adhesive failure which is failure of the bond of the adhesive to the surface of the substrate. In addition to the initial adhesion results, additional samples were run through a durability experiment After preparing the samples and<br><br>
curing for seven days as described above, the samples were placed into a water bath and held at 90°C. After the indicated times a sample was removed from the water bath, allowed to rest at least 15 minutes, and then tested via the QKA test. The long-term durability is expressed as the number of days required to lose 100 percent CF, i.e., the adhesive demonstrates some adhesive failure. Adhesive 1 is an adhesive formulated with a silane grafted isocyanate terminated prepolymer, plasticizer, carbon black, 2,2-dimorpholinodiethylether dimethyltin carboxylate and a phosphite antioxidant.<br>
Table 1 lists the components used in the formulations of primers that meet the intended purpose of adhering to the ceramic enamel.<br><br>
Table 1: Tyzor® OGT titanate-octyleneglycol titanate=Tetrakis(2-ethyl-hexane' -1,3 ,diolato)titanate;<br>

KR*95 titanate-isopropyl tri(dodecyl)benzenesulfonyl titanate; KR*44 titanate-isopropyl tri(N-ethylenediamino)ethyl titanate; Tyzor® NBZ zirconate-N-butyl zirconate; Tyzor® NBZ zirconate-triethanolamine zirconate; Mercaptosilane is mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane. Polyaminosilane is N-2-aminoethyl-3-aminopropyltrimethoxy-silane. Secondary amino silane is bis(trimethyloxysilylpropyl)amine. Ethyl triacetoxy silane<br>
Table 2 gives the formulations of Examples 1-12. Examples 1-12 illustrate the types of titanates or zirconates used in conjunction with the mixture of silanes used. The table gives the relative amounts of the reactive materials as a function of total formulation solids. Examples 13 and 14 give the performance of primers that were made without silane adhesion promoters. Adhesive 1 was applied to each of the examples 20 seconds after the clear wipe was applied to the glass and the results indicate that the adhesion is greatly improved by the combination of silane mix and the titanium compound. A comparison of Examples 10,13 and<br><br>
applied to the glass and the results indicate that the adhesion is greatly improved by the combination of silane mix and the titanium compound. A comparison of Examples 10, 13 and 14 show the benefits of the titanate/silane combination. The adhesion of Example 10, a combination of Tyzor® TOT and the silane mix demonstrates 100 percent CF. Removal of the silane mix decreases performance of the adhesive to 60 percent CF for Example 13 and to less than 90 percent CF for Example 14. The replacement of the titanium compound with a zirconium compound also decreases the adhesion. The two formulations made with zirconium compounds, Examples 11 and 12, failed with 100 percent adhesive failure in the initial QKA tests. Adhesive Failure (AF) means the adhesion of the adhesive to the surface of the substrate fails.<br><br><br><br>
The combination of Tyzor® OGT and siianes was further investigated to determine the effects of changing the silane mix ratio and the amount of titanate relative to the amount of silane. Table 3 lists the formulations of an additional 12 examples (numbers 15-27). In addition to the initial QKA results, the durability performance, as measured by the number of days in 90°C water before there is a loss of adhesion is also listed for each example.<br><br><br><br>
Examples 1-3 and 15-23, which are comprised of the mercaptopropyl trimethoxy silane., N-aminoethyl-3-aminopropyl trimethoxy silane, and bis-(3-trimethoxysilylpropyl)amine silanes combined with Tyzor® OGT, Titanate exhibited 100 percent cohesive failure in the initial adhesion experiments. Example 24, made without Tyzor® OGT Titanate and with a 1:1:1 mix of the silanes achieved strong initial adhesion to each of the three enamels. However, die durability of this system is less than desirable.<br>
The combination of an organotitanate with the silane mix demonstrates excellent adhesion. A comparison of Examples 1, 2, 3 and 24 show the durability improvements when Tyzor® OGT is used with a 1:1:1 mix of silanes. When Tyzor® OGT Titanate removed from the formulation, there is a complete loss of cohesive failure to each of the three frits in less than one day in the water bath. Tyzor® OGT Titanate, regardless of the level used, improves the adhesion durability for each of the ceramic enamels. Durability performance is obtained when there is a higher percentage of mercaptosilane in the formulation. This is illustrated through a comparison of Examples 18,20 and 23. The durability is improved when the amount of amino silane is reduced relative to the mercaptosilane.<br>
Two adhesive systems were compared, one without a stabilizer package and one with a stabilizer package. The first adhesive was adhesive 1 as described hereinbefore. The second adhesive contained was adhesive 1 with a hindered amine light stabilizer sold under the trademark and designation Tinuvin 765 and an ultraviolet light absorber of Tinuvin 571. A primer comprising the primer of Example 17 was applied by wiping it on the enamel coated glass substrate surface using a cheesecloth soaked with the primer. The subtrates used were Frits 1 to 3. The solvent was allowed to flash off for 20 seconds and the adhesives were applied. The adhesive was cured at 23°C at 50 percent relative humidity for 7 days. Samples were subjected to conditions as described in SAE 1885 in a WOM (weatherometer) for 2000 and 2500 hours then the samples were tested according test SAE 1885. The results are compiled in Table 4.<br><br><br>
This data illustrates that the use of a light and a UV stabilizer in an adhesive improves the long term durability of the adhesive system bond.<br><br>
'Open Time Testing<br>
The primer of Example 23 was applied to glass coupons coated with Frit 1 enamel. The coupons were stored at 35°C in 90 percent relative humidity for the time stated. Adhesives A and B were applied to the coupons according to the QKA test described above. The coupons with adhesive applied to the surface were then cured for 7 days at 23°C and 50 percent relative humidity. For each open time period, one coupon was tested according to the QKA after the initial curing period. A second coupon was subjected, stored for 14 additional days at 100°C and 100 percent relative humidity. Adhesive A is an adhesive based on isocyanate and silane functional prepolymer. Adhesive B is an adhesive based on an isocyanate functional prepolymer.<br>
The results of the testing are contained in Table 5. Open time is the time between application of the clear primer and adhesive. Initial means testing of a coupon after 7 day cure of the adhesive on the coupon. Humidity means testing of the adhesive bond to the coupon after 7 day cure and the 14 day exposure to 100°C and 100 percent humidity. The data in Table 5 demonstrates that the open time between application of the clear primer and the adhesive can be from 0 to 90 days and a good bond of adhesive to the glass coupon is formed.<br><br><br><br>
