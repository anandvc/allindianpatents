				<td>A METHOD OF PREPARING A TRIFLUOROVINYL METAL COMPLEX<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method of preparing a trifluorovinyl metal<br>
complex and related monomers via the in-situ formation of a trifluorovinyl metal<br>
complex.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
a,p,P-Trifluorostyrenes ('TFS") can be used as monomers in the<br>
production of polymers that, in turn, can be used to produce membranes with favorable<br>
chemical and mechanical properties. In addition, if the resultant polymers are<br>
functionalized with an ion-exchange group, they can be used to form ion-exchange<br>
membranes. A polymer membrane comprising TFS and/or substituted TFS monomer<br>
units may be suitable for a wide variety of applications and, in particular, such polymer<br>
membranes containing ion-exchange functionality have been used in electrochemical<br>
applications such as fuel cells as disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,422,411, 5,602,185 and<br>
5,834,523.<br>
The synthesis of a,P,P-trifluorostyrene was initially reported in the late<br>
1940's and early 1950's. While several methods have since been reported, none of the<br>
methods are economically viable in the large scale synthesis of TFS and related<br>
monomers. Typical conditions that could render methodologies generally unsuitable for<br>
large scale synthesis include low yields, high or low temperatures, high pressures, the<br>
use of toxic chemicals and the use of environmentally damaging chemicals such as<br>
chlorofiuorocarbons ("CFCs").<br>
U.S. Patent No. 2,612,528 discloses a multi-step synthesis of TFS via a<br>
Friedal-Crafts acylation to produce an overall TFS yield of about 30%. In addition to<br>
the low yield obtained, the method also requires the use of a toxic fluorinatuig agent,<br>
namely antimony pentafluoride, and the isolation of CFC intermediates.<br><br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 2,651,627 and 2,752,400 report a synthesis of TFS from<br>
chlorotrifluoroethylene and benzene by pyrolysis at 550-600°C. Not only does this<br>
method require high temperatures and the use of a CFC as a starting material, but this<br>
method only results in low yields of less than 30%. Pyrolysis at 600-800°C was also<br>
reported in U.S. Patent No. 3,489,807 in the synthesis of TFS from β,β-<br>
chlorofluoroethylbenzene and 2-chloro-1,1-difluoroethylene, though, relatively low<br>
yields were similarly reported. Low yields also result from the synthesis of TFS via the<br>
reaction of phenyl lithium with tetrafluoroethylene as disclosed in U.S. Patent No.<br>
2,874,166.	Cryogenic	temperatures	of<br>
-30 to -100°C are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,449,449 for the reaction of solid<br>
phenylsodium with tetrafluoroethylene under high pressure (i.e., 70-1400 kPa) to form<br>
TFS.<br>
Relatively high yields at mild temperatures are described in Heinze and<br>
Burton (Journal of Organic Chemistry 55:2714-2720, 1998) for the synthesis of TFS.<br>
However, this synthesis requires the use of either iodotrifluoroethylene or<br>
bromotrifluoroethylene as a starting material. Bromo- and iodotrifluoroethylene are<br>
class 2 ozone-depleters that are both relatively expensive and currently commercially<br>
available in large volumes from only one source in North America, namely Halocarbon<br>
Products Corporation.<br>
Accordingly, there remains a need for improved synthetic methods for<br>
making TFS and related monomers, particularly methods that provide for relatively<br>
high yields under mild conditions using commercially available and relatively<br>
environmentally benign starting materials.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present method provides for the two-step synthesis of TFS or a<br>
derivative thereof from 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane ("HFC-134a")-<br>
In the first step, a trifluorovinyl metal complex is formed by effecting a<br>
reaction between HFC-134a, an amine, a base and a metal salt This is shown in the<br>
following reaction wherein MX1n is the metal salt:<br><br><br>
The amine may be added to the reaction mixture as a free amine or with the metal salt in<br>
a preformed metal salt-amine complex. Alternatively, the amine may be generated in<br>
situ. For example, if lithium diisopropylamide is used as the base, diisopropylamine<br>
will be generated in situ.<br>
In another embodiment of the first step, a trifluoro vinyl metal complex is<br>
formed by effecting a reaction between HFC-134a, a base and a metal salt, wherein the<br>
reaction temperature is greater than -68°C. In a more specific embodiment, the reaction<br>
temperature is from about 15°C to about 25°C.<br>
The second step involves reacting the trifluorovinyl metal complex, as<br>
prepared above, with an aromatic transfer agent (ArX2) in the presence of a metal<br>
catalyst and a coordinating ligand to form TFS or a derivative thereof. This is shown in<br>
the following reaction:<br><br>
The X2 group of the aromatic transfer agent can be any of a variety of<br>
suitable transfer agent leaving groups, such as halogen, triflate (i.e., -OSO2CF3), or<br>
other suitable groups known to those skilled in the art. In this regard, higher yields<br>
have been observed with aromatic iodides. Typically, the aromatic group will be a<br>
carbocyclic aromatic group, such as phenyl or naphthyl, although heterocyclic aromatic<br>
groups, such as thienyl, may also be used. As discussed in greater detail below, the<br>
aromatic transfer agent may be optionally substituted.<br>
To form TFS, the aromatic transfer agent is a phenyl halide (such as<br>
phenyl iodide). The metal catalyst may be palladium, nickel or platinum, in either the<br>
zero oxidation state or reduced to this oxidation state in situ. Palladium(0)<br>
bis(dibenzyiidene acetone) is an example of a metal catalyst that is easy to handle and<br><br>
both temperature and air stable. The coordinating ligand can be a mono- or<br>
multidentate phosphine, arsine or other ligand known to those skilled in the art. The<br>
ligand may be, for example, triphenylphosphine.<br>
The two steps in the synthesis of TFS or derivative thereof can be<br>
performed without isolating the trifluorovinyl metal complex intermediate. Further, a<br>
mixture of two or more TFS monomers (or derivatives thereof) can be synthesized by<br>
adding a second aromatic transfer agent along with the first aromatic transfer agent.<br>
These and other aspects of the invention will be evident upon reference<br>
to the following detailed description.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS <br>
α,β,β-Trifluorostyrene (TFS) has the following structure (I):<br><br>
As used herein, "derivatives" of TFS include compounds having the<br>
following structure (II):<br><br>
wherein Ar represents an aromatic carbocyclic or heterocylic moiety, optionally<br>
substituted with one or more substituents, but not including structure (I).<br>
Representative aromatic carbocylic moieties include phenyl and 1- and 2-naphthyl,<br>
while representative aromatic heterocyclic moieties include thienyl, furyl and pyrrolyl.<br>
When substituted by two or more substituents, the substituents may be the same or<br>
different. Substituents include any moiety not having acidic hydrogens. Representative<br>
substituents include, but are not limited to, hydroxy, cyano, nitro, halo, halogenated<br><br>
alkyl such as trifluoromethyl, halogenated alkenyl such as -CF=CF2, alkoxy such as<br>
methoxy, and aryloxy such as phenoxy.<br>
As used herein, "alkyl" means a straight chain or branched, noncyclic or<br>
cyclic, unsaturated or saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon containing from 1 to 10 carbon<br>
atoms. Representative saturated straight chain alkyls include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-<br>
butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, and the like; while saturated branched alkyls include isopropyl,<br>
sec-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, isopentyl, and the like. Representative saturated cyclic<br>
alkyls include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, -CH2cyclopropyl,<br>
-CH2cyclobutyl, -CH2cyclopentyl, -CH2cyclohexyl, and the like; while unsaturated<br>
cyclic alkyls include cyclopentenyl and cyclohexenyl, and the like. Cyclic alkyls, also<br>
referred to as "homocyclic rings," and include di- and poly-homocyclic rings such as<br>
decalin and adamantyl. Unsaturated alkyls contain at least one double or triple bond<br>
between adjacent carbon atoms (referred to as an "alkenyl" or "alkynyl", respectively).<br>
Representative straight chain and branched alkenyls include ethylenyl, propylenyl, 1-<br>
butenyl, 2-butenyl, isobutylenyl, 1-pentenyl, 2-pentenyl, 3-methyl-l-butenyl, 2-methyl-<br>
2-butenyl, 2,3-dimethyl-2-butenyl, and the like; while representative straight chain and<br>
branched alkynyls include acetylenyl, propynyl, 1-butynyl, 2-butynyl, 1-pentynyl, 2-<br>
pentynyl, 3-methyl-l butynyl, and the like.<br>
Furthermore, "aryl" means an aromatic carbocyclic moiety, such as<br>
phenyl and naphthyl, while "alkoxy" and "aryloxy"- mean -O-alkyl and -O-aryl,<br>
respectively.<br>
In the present approach, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane ("HFC-134a") is used<br>
as a starting material in the synthesis of TFS, or a derivative thereof, under relatively<br>
mild conditions. As a starting material, HFC-134a is economical and environmentally<br>
benign. HFC-134a has been reported as a starting material for perfluorovinyl-metal<br>
derivatives in Banger et al. (Chemical Communications 1997, 139-140). However,<br>
Banger et al. use very low temperatures (i.e., -78°C) for the synthesis of the<br>
perfluorovinyl metal derivatives as it was understood that trifluorovinyl lithium<br>
decomposes at higher temperatures (see, e.g., D.J. Burton et al., Tetrahedron, 2993,<br>
1994).<br><br>
In an embodiment of the present method, TFS monomers and derivatives<br>
thereof can be synthesized in two steps. In the first step, a trifluorovinyl metal complex<br>
is formed by reacting HFC-134a with a base, an amine and a metal salt. In the second<br>
step, an aromatic transfer agent, a metal catalyst and a coordinating ligand are combined<br>
and heated. After cooling to room temperature, TFS monomers, or derivatives thereof,<br>
can typically be isolated in yields of about 75-85%.<br>
It should be understood that various bases may be used in this first step,<br>
provide that the base is capable of deprotonating HFC-134a. Representative bases<br>
include, but are not limited to, alkyl and aryl lithium reagents (such as lithium<br>
diisopropylamide or t-butyllithiurn), alkyl and aryl Grignard reagent, and sodium or<br>
potassium metals.<br>
Representative metal salts, M(X1)n, include, but are not limited to, zinc<br>
salt, mercuric salt, indium salt, magnesium salt, cadmium salt, thalium salt, alkyl tin<br>
salt, aryl tin salt, alkyl lead salt or aryl lead salt. The metal salt may be a metal halide<br>
(i.e., X1 = halide) wherein the halide is a chloride, bromide or iodide, although other<br>
metal salts such as a metal acetate (X1 = acetate) or a metal triflate (X1 = triflate) may<br>
also be used. Also, the X1 groups need not be the same, although they typically are the<br>
same, and n represents the number of electron donating X1 groups are associated with<br>
the metal M. The metal salt is preferably anhydrous, though small amounts of water<br>
may be present. Nevertheless, higher yields tend to be observed in the absence of water<br>
during the first step. Anhydrous zinc chloride is a representative reagent as it reacts<br>
efficiently, and it is more economical and/or more environmentally benign than the<br>
other salts mentioned above.<br>
Suitable amines include alkyl, aryl and heteroaromatic amines as<br>
understood by those skilled in the art. In this regard, "heteroaromatic amine" means an<br>
aromatic heterocycle ring of 5 to 10 members and having at least one nitrogen atom and<br>
containing at least 1 carbon atom, including both mono- and bicyclic ring systems.<br>
Representative heteroaromatic amines include (but are not limited to) pyrrole, indole,<br>
azaindole, pyridine, quinoline, isoquinoline, pyrazole, imidazole, benzimidazole,<br>
pyridazine, pyrimidine, pyrazine, cinnoline, phthalazine, and quinazoline.<br><br>
Further, the amine may be mono- or multi-dentate. Without limiting the<br>
generality of the foregoing, the amine may be, for example, tetramethylethylenediamine<br>
("TMEDA"), diisopropylamine, triethylamine, or 2,2'-bi-pyridyl. Alternatively, the<br>
amine need not be independently added to the reaction mixture, though either lower<br>
yields tend to be observed or the reaction must be operated at lower temperatures.<br>
Nevertheless, acceptable yields may still be observed at temperatures higher than -68°C<br>
even without any amine being present in the reaction mixture. However, if lithium<br>
diisopropylamide ("LDA") is used as the base, relatively high yields are observed at<br>
higher temperatures even without amine being independently added to the reaction<br>
mixture. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that higher yields are observed<br>
due to an amine, namely diisopropylamine, being generated in situ as LDA reacts with<br>
HFC-134a.<br>
The amine and the metal salt can be added to the reaction mixture as<br>
separate components, or in the form of a preformed metal salt-amine complex, such as,<br>
for example, a ZnCl2•TMEDA complex.<br>
THF is used as a solvent in the above embodiment though it is<br>
understood that other solvents may be used.<br>
Dependent on the base chosen, the temperature of the reaction to form<br>
the trifluorovinyl metal complex may be varied without significantly affecting the yield.<br>
For example, the reaction may be performed at room temperature (i.e. 15-25°C) and<br>
also at low temperatures, such as, for example -90°C without significantly impacting<br>
the yield. However, an advantage of the present method is that it allows more practical<br>
conditions to be used in the synthesis of TFS monomers and derivatives thereof.<br>
The aromatic transfer agent (ArX2) may be an aromatic halide (i.e., X2 =<br>
fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo), triflate (i.e. X2 = -OSO2CF3), or other aromatic transfer<br>
agent known to those skilled in the art. The aryl group is phenyl to yield TFS.<br>
Alternatively, to yield TFS derivatives, the aromatic group may be substituted phenyl,<br>
naphthyl, substituted naphthyl, heteroaryl or substituted heteroaryl. To this end,<br>
"heteroaryl" means an aromatic heterocycle ring of 5 to 10 members and having at least<br>
one heteroatom selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, and containing at least 1<br>
carbon atom, including both mono- and bicyclic ring systems. Representative<br><br>
heteroaryls include (but are not limited to) furyl, benzofuranyl, thiophenyl,<br>
benzothiophenyl, pyrrolyl, indolyl, isoindolyl, azaindolyl, pyridyl, quinolinyl,<br>
isoquinolinyl, oxazolyl, isooxazolyl, benzoxazolyl, pyrazolyl, imidazolyl,<br>
benzimidazolyl, thiazolyl, benzothiazolyl, isothiazolyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl,<br>
pyrazinyl, triazinyl, cinnolinyl, phthalazinyl, and quinazolinyl.<br>
Furthermore, a combination of different aromatic transfer agents may be<br>
added to the reaction mixture to yield a mixture of TFS monomers and/or derivatives<br>
thereof. For example, if the aromatic transfer agent is iodophenyl and iodophenyl<br>
substituted with trifiuoromethyl (at either the ortho, meta or para position), and such<br>
transfer agents are added together as the aromatic transfer agents, a mixture of TFS and<br>
F3CC6H4CF=CF2 will be generated.<br>
The metal catalyst can be any palladium, nickel or platinum metal<br>
catalyst wherein the metal is in the zero oxidation state. Alternatively, the metal<br>
catalyst may be in the +2 or +4 oxidation state and then reduced in situ, to the zero<br>
oxidation state. For example, the metal catalyst may be palladium bis(dibenzylidene<br>
acetone).<br>
The coordinating ligand may be any ligand selected from the group of<br>
mono or multidentate phosphines and arsines. High yields of TFS and derivatives<br>
thereof may still be observed if the coordinating ligand is not added to the reaction<br>
mixture. Triphenylphosphine as the coordinating ligand allows high yields of TFS and<br>
derivatives thereof, is cost effective and relatively environmentally benign.<br>
A small amount of bis trifluorometal complex may be formed in the first<br>
step along with the "mono-complex". This is shown in the following schematic:<br><br>
The formation of the "bis complex" is not significant as it reacts with the aromatic<br>
transfer agent, similarly to the mono complex in the second step of the reaction to<br>
produce TFS or derivative thereof.<br><br>
The isolation and purification of TFS and derivatives can be<br>
accomplished by, for example, first flash distilling the reaction mixture under vacuum<br>
to separate the solvents and product from the metal salts produced during the reaction.<br>
The TFS monomer may then be isolated by fractional distillation under partial pressure.<br>
Depending on the relative volatility of the solvent, the TFS or related monomer may be<br>
isolated directly from the reaction mixture by fractional distillation.<br>
The monomer may then be polymerized to form a polymer suitable for<br>
use in such applications as a membrane in electrochemical fuel cells. The polymer may<br>
be a homopolymer or a copolymer. Copolymers may be random, block or graft<br>
copolymers.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
TRIFLUOROVINYL ZINC CHLORIDE<br>
A 250 mL three-necked round bottom flask fitted with a dry<br>
ice/isopropanol condenser, septum and a low temperature thermometer were assembled<br>
while hot and flushed with nitrogen gas. It was charged with ZnCl2 (3.42g, 25.0 mmol)<br>
and THF (15.0 ml). The solution was cooled to 12-15°C using a cold water bath and<br>
gaseous HFC-134a (2.5 ml, 30.0 mmol) was condensed in the saturated solution. LDA<br>
was added to the reaction mixture slowly over 35 min. through a cannula while<br>
maintaining the temperature between 15 and 20°C. The tip of the cannula was dipped<br>
below the surface of the solution to avoid decomposition of the intermediate vinyl<br>
lithium at the tip by the reaction of gaseous HFC-134a with LDA. The reaction mixture<br>
was stirred for lh at 20°C and then allowed to settle for 2h. The 19F NMR of the zinc<br>
reagent was recorded at this stage and showed formation of the trifluorovinyl zinc<br>
complex along with traces of unreacted HFC-134a. Small amounts of bis trifluorovinyl<br>
zinc product was also formed along with mono trifluorovinyl zinc complex as seen by<br>
the shoulder peaks in the up field direction to the mono complex. The ratio of mono/bis<br>
was approximately 90:10. The estimated yield of the trifluorovinyl zinc chloride was<br>
73%.<br><br>
EXAMPLES 2-9<br>
Following the general procedure as provided for in Example 1, the<br>
reaction was repeated varying the base, the metal salt, the amine and/or the temperature<br>

EXAMPLE 10<br>
GENERAL PROCEDURE FOR TFS AND DERIVATIVES<br>
Trifluorovinyl zinc chloride was prepared according to Example 1. The<br>
dry ice/isopropanol condenser and the thermometer from the reaction described in<br>
Example 1 were replaced with a stopcock and stopper. The trifluorovinyl zinc chloride<br>
solution was concentrated under vacuum to almost half its original volume. During this<br>
concentration, excess HFC-134a was evaporated off. After careful displacement of the<br>
vacuum with nitrogen, a condenser fitted with a nitrogen inlet replaced the stopcock.<br>
Iodobenzene (approx. 0.8 eq) and tetrakistriphenylphosphine palladium (Pd(PPh3)4)<br>
(approx. 1.5 mol%) were then added. The reaction mixture was heated at 60°C using an<br>
oil bath. The reaction progress was monitored using 19F NMR by sampling small<br>
aliquots of the reaction mixture. After the complete conversion of the trifluorovinyl<br>
zinc chloride to the TFS, the reaction mixture was triturated several times with pentane<br>
or hexane and the combined extracts evaporated on a rotary evaporator after the<br>
addition of silica gel. Silica gel was added prior to evaporation of the solvent to absorb<br>
the TFS product and thereby prevent loss of product due to its volatile nature. After<br>
evaporation of the solvent, column chromatography on silica gel was then carried out<br>
with either pentane or hexane as eluent depending on the volatility of the TFS.<br><br>
EXAMPLES 11-21<br>
Following the general procedure as provided for in Example 10, the<br>
reaction was repeated varying the aryl halide.<br><br>
