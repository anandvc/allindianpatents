Friction-fit elastic rail fastener for track systems<br>
The invention relates to a friction-fit elastic rail fastener for track systems; comprising a tensioning element made of an elastic material, in particular hardened spring steel, that in the assembled state is fixed in place between a retaining plate provided on a sleeper and a fastening anchor such that the tensioning element exerts a retention force on the rail foot in order to hold the rail in position, and the tensioning element is symmetrically aligned with respect to a vertically oriented plane of symmetry that is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the rail.<br>
A generic rail fastener is known from DE 34 00 110 [US 4,770,343].  In the cited document a tensioning element is used that in the assembled state is provided between a retaining plate and a fastening anchor.  The tensioning element has two legs designed as torsion elements.  The torsion legs have two adjacent parallel spring bar sections that are formed one piece with a loop that forms a bracing section and is curved outward and essentially transversely with respect to the spring bar sections.  The two spring bar sections of the torsion legs are connected via the transverse connecting piece.  The two outer spring bar sections of the torsion legs each have a U-shaped bend, provided at a distance behind the transverse connecting piece that at its free end section is supported on the transverse connecting piece, whereas anchor parts for the rail fastener have two support flanges for the torsion legs of the tensioning element, projecting toward opposite<br><br>
sides, adjacent to a center bar and respectively provided at a distance above stop bevels for the bracing sections located next to the rail foot.<br>
A rail fastener of the above-described type is known from DE 39 18 091 [5,096,119] in which sections of the outer legs of the epsilon-shaped tensioning elements widen toward the rail foot with an increase in distance between the inner legs.  The mutually aligned free ends of the tensioning element end outside the inner legs.  The tensioning element is also designed such that in the assembled position a center bar comes to rest a small distance above the rail foot, and in the preassembled position the inner side of the center bar contacts the shaft of the sleeper screw.<br>
In one of the previously known embodiments, although the tensioning element fulfills its function, namely, to securely hold the rail on the sleeper, the tensioning element is relatively large and complicated in design.  This entails a correspondingly high level of manufacturing complexity that increases the production costs for the tensioning elements.<br>
In addition, the previously known tensioning elements do not adequately address the problem that the rail may tilt when unusually high forces impinge thereon.  The torsion legs of the tensioning element and the sleeper screws may be highly stressed, i.e. overtightened or overloaded, when the rail tilts.  It is therefore desirable to design the rail fastener in such a way that precautions are taken, and also that overloading of the tensioning element and of the sleeper screws is prevented even during tilting.<br><br>
In one of the previously known embodiments, the tensioning torque is indirectly produced only by tightening the sleeper screws or hook screws.  The tensioning force of the tensioning element also acts on the pretensioning force of the sleeper screw, thereby also subjecting the screw to load.  In addition, the tensioning element can be assembled only by use of a sleeper screw or hook screw.  It is desirable to achieve a universal assembly of the tensioning element, i.e. with or without screws, and, if necessary, without affecting the pretensioning force for the screw.<br>
The object of the invention, therefore, is to refine a rail fastener of the generic type such that the above-referenced disadvantages are avoided, that in particular a simple geometric design of the tensioning element is possible, and that the associated manufacturing costs remain low.  A further aim is to provide a reliable two-stage overload protection so that the tensioning element is not damaged even when occasional, unusually high forces arise.  A further aim is to provide a possibility for assembly that is universal and, if necessary, independent from the screw pretensioning.<br>
Achievement of this object according to the invention is characterized in that the tensioning element has two preferably parallel torsion legs that in the assembled state are at least substantially provided between the retaining plate and the fastening anchor, and the two torsion legs are connected to one another on the side facing away from the rail by means of a connecting section.  In addition, a loop-shaped clamping section is<br><br>
provided on each end of the torsion leg facing the rail, and adjacent the torsion legs the clamping section first extends essentially perpendicular to the plane, and then extends in a looped manner until the ends of the clamping section reach the vicinity of the ends of the torsion legs, where they form a support surface on the rail foot.  Furthermore, in the non-tensioned state of the tensioning element the torsion legs together with the connecting section lie essentially in a first plane, and at least a portion of the loop-shaped clamping sections lie in a second plane, whereby the second plane is rotated about an axis in relation to the first plane, the axis extending parallel to the sectional axis of the plane of symmetry containing the first plane.<br>
In the assembled state of the tensioning element, the second plane preferably is substantially congruent with the first plane.<br>
Under normal load on the rail, in the assembled state the loop-shaped clamping sections of the tensioning element preferably contact the rail foot.  However, the ends of the clamping section in the assembled state may also engage in recesses provided for same in the retaining plate.  In this manner it is possible for the end-face ends of the clamping sections to lock in the recesses for horizontal stabilization in the final assembled position.  The recesses in the retaining plate may also have locking projections or catches that enable the ends of the clamping section to engage with the retaining plate.<br>
The loop-shaped clamping sections may also first extend from the end of the torsion legs, essentially perpendicular to the<br><br>
plane of symmetry, and then extend in the direction away from the rail in order to return back to the rail in a curved progression. In this case, the loop-shaped claxiqping sections preferably have an S-shaped curve, at least in places.  This design provides a compact structure of the fastening system, as discussed further below.<br>
In their portions facing the rail as viewed from above, the loop-shaped clamping sections preferably each have an essentially circular or oval shape.  Connection transitions between the individual functional zones are provided with large radii or radius transitions to ensure optimal tension curves in the material of the tensioning element.  The individual radii or radius transitions along the curve of the tensioning element may have different sizes.<br>
The loop-shaped clamping sections adjacent the torsion legs may first extend essentially perpendicular from the plane of symmetry.<br>
The angle between the above-referenced planes, i.e. between the first plane and the second plane, is preferably between 5° and 30° in the non-tensioned state of the tensioning element.<br>
The ends of the loop-shaped clamping sections may be designed as straight sections.  These straight sections preferably extend parallel to each other.<br>
The ends of the loop-shaped clamping sections, in particular the straight sections, may have a cutout that is designed as a support surface on the corner radius of the rail foot.  This allows defined and secure contact on the rail foot.<br><br>
To accommodate an overload, each loop-shaped clamping section may have a first contact surface in the lateral region of the clamping section for contacting the rail foot, the first contact surface likewise contacting the rail foot when the rail tilts in the event of high horizontal forces on the rail head (first overload case), but with a greatly reduced lever arm.  In addition, each loop-shaped clamping section may have a second contact surface for contacting the fastening anchor, and in a secondr  more intense overload case that exceeds the first overload case for the forces acting on the rail, the second contact surface contacts the fastening anchor.<br>
The retaining plate may be integrated into a rail-bed plate.<br>
The retaining plate and the fastening anchor may have a two-piece design.  The retaining plate and the fastening anchor may be connected or held together by means of a hook screw.<br>
The fastening anchor may be plate-shaped and fixed in placed by a screw.<br>
The retaining plate and the fastening anchor may also have a one-piece design.<br>
On its lower face, in its lateral end regions facing the rail, the fastening anchor may have contact surfaces for the loop-shaped clamping sections.  On its lower face the fastening anchor in its lateral end regions facing away from the rail may also have a first channeled locking depression in each case for locking the tensioning element in a preasserobled position.  On its lower face the fastening anchor may also have a second channeled locking<br><br>
depression in its lateral end regions facing away from the rail for locking the tensioning element in a neutral position.  Finally, on its lower face the fastening anchor may have two channeled contact surfaces for supporting the torsion legs of the tensioning element in the final assembled state.<br>
The fastening anchor may also be formed by the sleeper screw or by a washer connected thereto.<br>
The retaining plate may have two curved depressions, extending perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the rail, for guiding the tensioning element during installation thereof.  The retaining plate may have two contact surfaces for contacting the tensioning element in its assembled state.  Furthermore, on its lower face the retaining plate may have a projection, extending in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the rail, for engaging with a corresponding recess in the sleeper.<br>
The tensioning element may be economically produced by use of the proposed design.  The tensioning element is relatively compact, so that the proposed rail fastener may be used for a number of applications.<br>
In addition, two-stage overload protection of the rail fastener is provided in the event of overload, thereby reliably preventing excessive tilting of the rail and avoiding plastic deformation of the clamp.<br>

FIGS. 1 through 4 show the basic structure of a friction-fit elastic rail fastener for a track system.  The rail 6 must be fastened to a sleeper 2 or a rail-bed plate (see FIG. 23) .  For this purpose, the sleeper 2 is formed with a recess 24 whose shape corresponds to a projection of a retaining plate 3 mounted on the sleeper 2.  The recess 24 may correspond to the shape of a known angled guide plate, or may have another design.  A plate-shaped fastening anchor 4 is fixed to the retaining plate 3 and the sleeper 2 by means of a sleeper screw 12.  A tensioning element 1 is provided between the fastening anchor 4 and the retaining plate 3 and in its assembled state exerts a pressure force on the rail foot 5 and thus holds the rail 6 in the intended position.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the tensioning element 1 has a symmetrical design with a vertical axis of symmetry 7 extending perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 8 of the rail 6.<br>
The specific design of the tensioning element 1 is shown in FIGS. 5 through 10.<br>
As shown most clearly in FIG. 5, the tensioning element 1 comprises two torsion legs la1 and la" that are symmetrical with respect to the plane of symmetry 7 and parallel to each other.  The torsion legs are connected to one another via a connecting section lb.  Loop-shaped clamping sections Id1 and Id" is provided on the respective ends lc1 or lc" of the torsion legs la1 and la"; i.e. the torsion leg la1 and la" merges into the clamping section ld! and Id" via a rounded section.  The clamping section Id1 and Id"<br><br>
each have an essentially circular or oval shape in the top view of the tensioning element 1 (see FIG. 5) .  The clamping section Id1 and Id11 extend in a circular configuration until reaching their ends le1 and le" that come to rest in the vicinity of the ends lc1 and lc" of the torsion legs la1 and la".<br>
This end regions le1 and le" are designed as straight sections If1 and If", and are provided for pressing on the top side of the rail foot 5 in normal operation.  As shown in FIGS. 7, 8, and 10, for this purpose cutouts lg? and lg" are provided in the tensioning element 1, namely, in the straight sections If1 and If", so that in the region of the straight sections If1 and If" the tensioning element 1 lies flat (not just in selected locations) on the corner radius of the rail foot 5.<br>
As shown most clearly in FIG. 6, the two torsion legs la' and la" together with the connecting section lb lie essentially in a first plane 9.  Portions of the clamping sections Id1 and Id", however, lie in a second plane 10 that is rotated with respect to the plane 9 about the axis 11 by the angle a.  The axis 11 is parallel to the sectional axis of the plane of symmetry 7 containing the first plane 9, and in FIG. 6 is thus perpendicular to the plane of the drawing.  The angle a is 5° to 30° in the non-tensioned or partially tensioned state.<br>
As a result of this design, after the tensioning element 1 is assembled, it makes defined contact only in the region of the straight sections If1 and If". The tensioning element 1 otherwise does not contact the rail foot 5 in normal operation.<br><br>
As shown in FIG. 8, the tensioning element 1 as a whole may have a slightly curved design to provide optimal cooperation with the retaining plate 3 or with the fastening anchor 4.  This figure also clearly shows the manner in which the frontmost portion of the clamping section Id1 and Id" is rotated out of the plane of the torsion legs.<br>
The following precautions are taken to prevent damage or overload of the tensioning element 1 in the event of an excessive lateral, horizontal force on the head of the rail 6, i.e. when the rail 6 undergoes a tilting motion about its longitudinal axis 8.<br>
First contact surfaces lh' and lh" are provided on the tensioning element, i.e. in the region of the loop-shaped clamping sections Id' and Id", in lateral regions li1 and li" of the clamping sections Id1 and Id'1.  In the event of extreme tilting of the rail 6, the rail foot 5 also presses on these contact surfaces lh1 and lh", thereby increasing the elastic force of the tensioning element 1 on the rail foot 5.  Thus, the first stage of an overload protection is provided by the first contact surfaces lh1 and lh" .<br>
If the tilting motion of the rail 6 should increase even more, second contact surfaces Ik' and Ik" are provided on the clamping sections Id1 and Id" that upon further lifting of the clamping sections Id' and Id" are also lifted and press against contact surfaces 15' and 15" (see FIG. 14) on the fastening anchor 4.  This results in high resistance to further tilting of the rail 6 without overtightening and therefore damaging the tensioning element 1.<br><br>
FIGS. 11 and 12 illustrate one possible approach to the use of a retaining plate 3.  On its lower face 22 the retaining plate 3 has a projection 23 whose shape corresponds to that of the recess 24 in the sleeper 2 (see FIGS. 3 and 4).  This ensures precise contact of the retaining plate 3 on the sleeper 2.  On its top side the retaining plate 3 has two curved depressions 20' and 20" that facilitate installation of the tensioning element 1 during assembly.  In the final assembled state the tensioning element 1 rests on contact surfaces 21' and 21" on the retaining plate 3. The curved or trough-shaped depressions are useful when the tensioning element 1 is installed from the rear using an installation tool; i.e. it is not necessary to detach the fastening anchor 4.  The depressions are used to push the tensioning element through from behind without great exertion of force.  In the absence of the depressions, the tensioning element would have to be completely compressed to its final tensioned state when pushed through.<br>
The fastening anchor 4 is shown in FIGS. 13 and 14.  The lower face 13 of the plate-shaped fastening anchor 4 has various features that facilitate assembly and retention of the tensioning element 1 in the final assembled position.  In lateral end regions 14' and 14" of the fastening anchor 4 facing the rail are located the previously mentioned contact surfaces 15f and 15" that in the second overload protection stage are contacted by the clamping sections Id* and Id" at the second contact sections lkf and Ik" thereof.<br><br>
During assembly the tensioning element 1 is first pushed in the direction of the rail until it rests against first channeled locking depressions 17f and 17" that are provided, i.e. integrally molded, in lateral end regions 16' and 16".  When the tensioning element 1 is advanced further in the direction of the rail 6, and thus in the direction of the final position of the tensioning element after assembly, the tensioning element 1 comes to rest in second channeled locking depressions 18' and 18".  In the final assembled position the tensioning element 1 then makes contact in channeled contact surfaces 19' and 19".<br>
The assembly sequence for the rail fastener is shown in FIGS. 15 through 18:<br>
The first stage of installation in the preassembled position is shown in FIG. 15.  The fastening anchor 4 together with the retaining plate 3 is preassembled (on the track or in the sleeper unit) by means of the sleeper screw 12 that has been completely tightened.  The tensioning element 1 is first installed by hand into the space between the retaining plate 3 and the fastening anchor 4.  By use of an installation tool the tensioning element 1 may then be advanced further in the direction of the rail.  This is done until the frontmost regions of the clamping sections Id1 and Id" come to rest in the first channeled locking depressions 17! and 17" in the fastening anchor 4.<br>
FIG. 16 shows the second stage of installation, the neutral position.  In the neutral position the tensioning element 1 is advanced in the direction of the rail until the frontmost regions of the clamping sections Id1 and Id" come to rest in the<br><br>
second channeled locking depressions 18' and 18" in the fastening anchor 4.  In this position of the tensioning element 1 the rail is prevented from tilting out during the assembly operation.  A small tensioning force is produced by the tensioning element 1.<br>
In the third stage of installation, the intermediate stage as shown in FIG. 17, the tensioning element 1 has been advanced further in the direction of the rail.  This stage represents a deformation of the tensioning element between the neutral position and the final tensioning.  In this position a central tensioning force is produced by the tensioning element 1, and the tensioning element is clamped between the retaining plate and the fastening anchor.<br>
FIG. 18 shows the fourth stage of installation, the final tensioning.  The tensioning element 1 now prevents the rail from tilting during operation.  A sufficient final tensioning force is produced, depending on the application.  The tensioning element 1 now rests or makes contact with three regions: In the vicinity of the straight sections If1 and lfn the tensioning element 1 presses on the rail foot 5.  At the fastening anchor 4 the tensioning element 1 rests against the channeled contact surfaces 19' and 19". The retaining plate 3 contacts the tensioning element at the contact surfaces 21' and 21".<br>
The measures for protection against overload of the tensioning element 1 are shown in FIG. 19:<br>
In the first stage of overload protection the first contact surfaces lh1 and lh" of the loop-shaped clamping section Id1 and Id" of the tensioning element 1 rest on the rail foot 5.<br><br>
In the first stage of overload protection the first distance, denoted by reference numeral s1  in FIG. 19, approaches zero; i.e. contact occurs between the loop-shaped clamping section and the rail foot.<br>
In the second stage of overload protection the loop-shaped clamping sections Id1 and Id" together with the second contact surfaces Ik1 and Ik" are supported on the contact surfaces 15' and 15" of the fastening anchor 4.<br>
In the second stage of overload protection the second distance, denoted by reference numeral s2 in FIG. 19, approaches zero; i.e. contact occurs between this clamping section and the fastening anchor.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment the loop-shaped clamping sections Id1 and Id" adjacent the torsion legs le' and le" extend away from the plane of symmetry 7.  In principle, the clamping sections Id1 and Id" may extend toward the plane of symmetry 7.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment the retaining plate 4 [sic; 3] is designed as a separate component.  The plate 4 [sic; 3] may be a component of a ribbed plate, or may be fixedly connected to the fastening anchor 4.<br>
The illustrated assembly procedure is based on the fact that the sleeper screw 12 is tightened with final torque before the tensioning element 1 is installed.  It is also possible for the sleeper screw 12 to not be (completely) tightened until the tensioning element 1 is installed, specifically, in the sleeper unit, for example; i.e. in the preassembled position before the<br><br>
rail is assembled, or in the neutral or final tensioned position after the rail is assembled.<br>
FIG. 20 shows a perspective view of the retaining plate 3 for the rail fastener, seen from above.  The difference from the embodiment according to FIG. 11 is essentially that on the end of the retaining plate 3 facing the rail, recesses 25 are provided for supporting the ends le1 of the clamping section of the tensioning element 1.  The recesses 25 are thus used for fixing the tensioning element in place in the assembled state.<br>
Such recesses 25 may also be provided for an embodiment as illustrated in FIG. 21.  In this case the retaining plate 3 and the fastening anchor 4 are designed as one piece in a manner known as such.  The rail in this instance is assembled or disassembled using an appropriately shaped fitting or removal claw as an installation tool.<br>
FIG. 22 shows the embodiment according to FIG. 21; i.e. the retaining plate 3 and the fastening anchor 4 are designed as one piece, and here as well a concrete sleeper anchor 27 is provided for anchoring the system.  The concrete sleeper anchor 27 may be integrally cast into a concrete sleeper in a form-fit manner.<br>
FIG. 23 shows a rail-bed plate 28 into which the retaining plate 3 is integrated; the fastening anchor 4 once again is integrally molded as one piece.  FIG. 24 shows the manner in which a rail 6 is fixed to the rail-bed plate 28 by means of the tensioning element 1.  The retaining plate 3 may be integrated into the rail-bed plate 28 during manufacture of the rail-bed plate, for<br><br>
example, by primary shaping (integral casting).  However, the retaining plate may also be welded onto the rail-bed plate 28 as a separate part.<br>
FIGS. 25 and 26 show an alternative embodiment.  In this case, the fastening anchor 4 is designed as a separate part that is connected to the rail-bed plate 28 via a hook screw 26.  The tensioning element 1 on account of its very flat shape may also be used as internal jaw or running rail tensioning in the point switch or cross frog region.<br>
FIG. 27 shows a slide chair plate 29 for a point switch region, where the rail 6 together with the tensioning element 1 is fixed in place.<br>
One variant of the tensioning element is shown in FIGS. 28 and 29.  Here it is seen that the two torsion legs la1 and la" are not parallel, but instead form a V shape together with the connecting section lb.<br>
The above-mentioned illustrated embodiments show that all relevant fastener variants of rail tensioning elements in use hitherto may be replaced by a tensioning element of one shape by means of the system according to the invention.<br>
In all of the above illustrated embodiments the sleeper screw 12 fixes the fastening anchor 4 in place.  However, this is not absolutely necessary.  The fastening anchor 4 may be omitted, so that the sleeper screw 12 acts directly on the tensioning element and fixes same in place.  To this end, FIGS. 30 through 35 show a corresponding design.  The sleeper screw 12 may be connected to or have a washer.  In FIGS. 30 through 32 the tensioning element<br><br>
1 is still in an initial preassembled position.  In FIGS. 33 through 35 the tensioning element 1 has been brought into its final assembled position.  For installation, reference is made to the above description.<br>
An alternative design of the tensioning element 1 is shown in FIGS. 36 through 38; in FIG. 39 the rail fastener together with this tensioning element 1 is seen in the final assembled position.<br>
The difference between the embodiment of the tensioning element 1 shown by way of example in FIG. 5 and the embodiment shown in FIGS. 36 through 38 is that the loop-shaped clamping sections Id1 and Id" have a different shape.  Same as for the embodiment according to FIG. 5, the tensioning element 1 first extends from the ends lc1 and lc" of the torsion legs la1 and la", away from the plane of symmetry 7, but then extends to the rear, away from the rail 6.  Only at that point does the tensioning element 1 extend in a loop, once again in the direction of the rail 6 (loop-shaped clamping section Id1 and Id") , in order to come to rest on the rail foot 5.  This results in an S-shaped curve of the loop-shaped clamping section Id1 and Id" from the torsion legs la1 and la" to the ends le' and le" of the clamping sections.  In the embodiment according to FIG, 5, the transitions are straight in places (see sections Ik1 and Ik" in FIG. 5).<br>
A further difference in the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 36 through 38 is that the support surfaces (see, for example, Ig1 and lg" in FIG. 10) have been altered.  In this embodiment, the ends le1 and le" on the top side of the rail foot are aligned<br><br>
obliquely to a parallel orientation with respect to the longitudinal direction of the rail 6, as shown in FIGS. 36 and 39. In the embodiment described above according to FIG. 5, the ends le' and le" are essentially at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the rail.<br>
In the embodiment according to FIGS. 36 through 39, the support surfaces lg1 and lg" at the ends le1 and le" are slightly flattened and rest on top of the rail foot.  This enlarges the support or contact surface between the tensioning element 1 and the rail foot 5, thereby preventing additional wear as the result of migration of the rail 6 in the longitudinal direction.<br>
In the embodiment according to FIGS. 36 through 39, it is seen that a much smaller installation space is present with regard to the distance from the rail bar 30 when, for example, rail stems 31 are built on, as shown in FIG. 39. The embodiment according to FIGS. 36 through 39 therefore represents a preferred embodiment of the invention.<br>
The variant of the tensioning element 1 illustrated in FIGS. 40 through 45 is similar to that of FIGS. 36 through 40. However, in this embodiment the ends le1 and le" of the clamping section Id1 and Id" have a different shape.  In this case, the end regions le1 and le" are curved inward at an angle equal to or greater than 45° (see in particular FIG. 41) .  The angled section le1 and le", together with any flattened lower face provided, lies completely on top of the rail foot.<br>
A further modified variant of the tensioning element 1 is shown in FIGS. 46 through 51.  In this case, the loop-shaped<br><br>
clamping section Id1 and Id" is shortened; in comparison to the embodiments described above, the end region of the clamping section facing the rail 6 has been cut off so that the clamping section has only a simple shape.  Such a variant of the invention is appropriate when installation space is very limited.  The inventive concept in question nonetheless allows very reliable tensioning of the rail.  The installation space may be limited to such an extent, for example as the result of specialized rail stems, that supporting a standard rail fastener would otherwise be impossible.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
