 A METHOD OF MAKING MODIFIED SILICA FILLERS IN WHICH<br>
 SILICA IS CONTACTED WITH SILICON CONTAINING COMPOUNDS<br>
[0001] This invention is related to a method of making a modified silica filler in which<br>
silica is contacted with a blend or mixture of a diorganodihalosilane and a tetrahalosilane in a<br>
weight ratio of 1:0.1 to 1:2, respectively.<br>
[0002] This is an improvement in methods of modifying silica fillers, as described for<br>
example, in US Patent 6,051,672 (April 18, 2000), assigned to the same assignee as the<br>
present invention. While the '672 patent contains a general formula (1) which broadly<br>
interpreted includes tetrahalosilanes, (i) no particular tetrahalosilane compounds are disclosed<br>
in the '672 patent, (ii) the '672 patent does not describe any particular mixture or blend of<br>
tetrahalosilane compounds and diorganodihalosilane compound as being any more effective<br>
than any other blend, (iii) nor does the '672 patent teach any particular ratio of these silane<br>
compounds as being necessary to achieve new and unexpected results, i.e., the ability to<br>
deposit more siloxane on silica, vis a viz, improved its hydrophobicity.<br>
[0003] Furthermore, it is generally recognized in the art that treating agents used to impart<br>
hydrophobicity to surfaces should contain organic or hydrocarbon groups characteristic of<br>
fats, oils, and waxes such as alkyl groups. However, since tetrahalosilanes such as silicon<br>
tetrachloride SiCl4 contain no organic or hydrocarbon groups in their molecule, it was highly<br>
unexpected that they would possess this functional utility.<br>
[0004] The invention is directed to a method of making modified silica fillers in which<br>
silica is contacted with a blend or mixture of organosilicon compounds. In particular, it is<br>
directed to an improvement in treating silica with blends or mixtures of diorganodihalosilanes<br>
and tetrahalosilanes, in weight ratios of 1:0.1 to 1:2, respectively.<br>
[0005] Preferably, the weight ratio is 1:0.3 to 1:1, most preferably 1:0.5. Similarly, the<br>
blend or mixture is preferably a dialkyldichlorosilane and a tetrahalosilane such as silicon<br>
tetrachloride, silicon tetrabromide, and silicon tetraiodide, most preferably<br>
dimethyldichlorosilane and silicon tetrachloride. In some additional embodiments, the blend<br>
or mixture may also comprise compositions containing (i) dimethyldichlorosilane, (ii) silicon<br>
tetrachloride, and (iii) mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane.<br>
[0006] These and other features of the invention will become apparent from a consideration<br>
of the detailed description.<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
[0007] The silica used to make the modified silica fillers according to this invention are the<br>
colloidal or precipitated silicas of the type used to formulate polymeric compositions such as<br>
rubber, particularly those rubber compositions used in the manufacture of vehicle tires for<br>
improving the mechanical properties of tire rubber. Such silicas are described in detail in the<br>
'672 patent, and in US Patent 5,908,660 (June 1, 1999), to which reference may be had and<br>
which are considered incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0008] Mineral fillers such as silica, having a small particle size and a large surface area,<br>
are capable of increasing the tensile strength of rubber compounds, and therefore are useful<br>
as a reinforcing material for rubber; particularly when the mineral surfaces of the filler are<br>
converted to hydrophobic low energy surfaces. Typically, this is carried out using<br>
methylchlorosilanes which react with the surface water of mineral surfaces or the water<br>
present in a reaction, i.e., hydrolysis and condensation of silanols, liberating hydrochloric<br>
acid and concurrently depositing a very thin film of methylpolysiloxanes with low critical<br>
surface tensions not wetted by water. A very simplified representation is<br>
=Si-Cl + H2O -» =SiOH + HC1 -&gt; =Si-O-Sis.<br>
[0009] Among some of the other reasons it may be desirable to impart hydrophobicity to<br>
silica surfaces, is that it renders them easily dispersible in organic systems such as defoamers,<br>
and in food, dairy, and vegetable processing. In other applications, silica particles rendered<br>
sufficiently hydrophobic can be held at oil-water interfaces. Surfaces of oxide minerals<br>
modified with monolayers of organofunctional silanes to render such surfaces hydrophobic<br>
make them useful in oil recovery, ore flotation, pigment dispersion, and for surface<br>
modification of metals. These water repellent, low energy surfaces are useful in water<br>
resistant treatments for masonry, electrical insulation, packing for chromatography, and in<br>
non-caking fire extinguishers. Ceramic insulators treated in this fashion are capable of<br>
maintaining high electrical resistivity under humid conditions. Forming an insoluble water<br>
resistant methylpolysiloxane film on a surface protects brick, mortar, sandstone, and concrete<br>
from spalling, cracking, and efflorescence.<br>
[0010] When silicone rubbers are reinforced with untreated silicas, reactions can take place<br>
causing the mixture to become tough and nervy, making it difficult to further process the<br>
mixture unless processing is performed immediately after the mixture is prepared. Reactions<br>
known as structuring and crepe aging can be prevented by treating silica surfaces with<br>
materials capable of reacting with hydroxyl radicals present on silica surfaces. While many<br>
methods have been devised for treating silica as powders and water dispersions to prevent<br>
structuring and crepe aging, the present invention provides a simplified avenue for producing<br>
treated silicas useful in reinforcing silicone rubbers as well.<br>
[0011] The silica treating agents according to the invention are blends of<br>
organodichlorosilanes and tetrahalosilanes such as silicon tetrachloride, silicon tetrabromide,<br>
and silicon tetraiodide. The organodichlorosilanes may contain alkyl groups, cycloalkyl<br>
groups, araalkyl (arylalkyl) groups, alkaryl (alkylaryl) groups, aryl groups, and certain<br>
substituted groups which are not reactive with respect to silica surfaces.<br>
[0012] Some examples of alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, hexyl, octyl, decyl,<br>
dodecyl, octadecyl, and nonadecyl. Some examples of cycloalkyl groups are cyclobutyl and<br>
cyclohexyl. Some examples of araalkyl (arylalkyl) groups are benzyl, phenylethyl, and<br>
2-phenylpropyl. Some examples of alkaryl (alkylaryl) groups are tolyl and mesityl. Some<br>
examples of aryl groups are phenyl, xenyl, naphthyl, and anthracyl. Some examples of<br>
substituted groups which are not reactive with respect to a silica surface are halogenated alkyl<br>
groups and aryl groups such as chloromethyl, dichloromethyl, trichloromethyl,<br>
3-chloropropyl, chlorocyclohexyl, chlorophenyl, and dichloroxenyl; alkyl groups containing<br>
alkoxy radicals such as methoxy, ethoxy, butoxy, and pentoxy; alkyl groups containing<br>
sulfido (-S-), disulfido, or polysulfido radicals; and alkyl groups containing cyano (-C=N)<br>
radicals.<br>
[0013] Representative of some organodichlorosilanes and tetrahalosilanes which can be<br>
used according to this invention are silicon tetrachloride, silicon tetrabromide, silicon<br>
tetraiodide, n-butylmethyldichlorosilane, t-butylmethyldichlorosilane,<br>
t-butylphenyldichlorosilane, cyclohexylmethyldichlorosilane, n-decylmethyldichlorosilane,<br>
di-n-butyldichlorosilane, di-t-butyldiehlorosilane, dicyclohexyldichlorosilane,<br>
dicyclopentyldichlorosilane, diethyldichlorosilane, di-n-hexyldichlorosilane,<br>
dimesityldichlorosilane, dimethyldichlorosilane, di-n-octyldichlorosilane, di-<br>
phenyldichlorosilane, di-(p-tolyl)dichlorosilane, docosylmethyldichlorosilane,<br>
dodecylmethyldichlorosilane, ethylmethyldichlorosilane, n-heptylmethyldichlorosilane,<br>
hexylmethyldichlorosilane, n-octylmethyldichlorosilane, phenylethyldichlorosilane,<br>
phenylmethyldichlorosilane, and p-tolylmethyldichlorosilane.<br>
[0014] A general method of making modified silica fillers according to the invention is<br>
described below in Example A, although the modified silica fillers can be made by any<br>
known and accepted technique, for example, as described in detail in the '660 patent, the '672<br>
patent, and in US Patent 6,384,125 (May 7,2002). While these patents describe general<br>
methods, they fail to describe the features of this invention, i.e., the use of a particular<br>
mixture or blend of a diorganodihalosilane and tetrahalosilane compounds in a particular<br>
ratio.<br>
[0015] When used in rubber compositions for manufacturing vehicle tires, other<br>
conventional additives may be used along with the modified silica filler, including other<br>
fillers such as carbon black, various oils, plasticizers, accelerators, antioxidants, heat<br>
stabilizers, light stabilizers, zone stabilizers, extenders, and coloring pigments.<br>
[0016] The following examples are set forth in order to illustrate the invention in more<br>
detail. The silica slurry used in the examples contained 6.5 percent by weight of silica, and is<br>
a commercial product of PPG Industries, Inc., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Neutralization was<br>
carried out by using a standard solution containing 25 percent by weight of sodium<br>
hydroxide, and it was prepared by dissolving 1000 grams of sodium hydroxide pellets in<br>
3000 millilitre of deionized water.<br>
[0017] The apparatus used in treating the silica consisted of a 5-liter round-bottom reaction<br>
flask, with ball joints, a Teflon® shaft stirring paddle assembly, an overhead electrical<br>
stirring motor, and a Type-K thermocouple temperature controller with a flexible heating<br>
mantle. The reaction flask was surmounted with a Dean-Stark trap and water cooler<br>
condenser with a port for a sealed glass thermocouple well directly submersed into the<br>
reaction flask. The third neck of the reaction flask was sealed with a ball-joint cap or an<br>
addition funnel. Filtration and washing of treated silica fillers and silica filler cakes was<br>
conducted with a 253 mm Coors Porcelain Buchner funnel containing Whatman filter paper.<br>
The funnel was mounted on a 4-liter filter flask. A Fisher brand Digital Conductivity Meter<br>
was used to measure the conductivity of the filtrate from the washing process. A Mettler<br>
Toledo Portable pHMon Meter, Model No. MP125 was used to measure pH.<br>
[0018] The following procedure, used in Example 2, represents a general procedure which<br>
was repeated in Examples 1,3, and 4. Data for Examples 1-4 is shown in Table 1.<br>
Example A - A General Procedure for Examples 1-4<br>
[0019] The reaction flask was charged with 2000 g of silica slurry and 165 g of<br>
concentrated sulphuric acid. The slurry was heated to a temperature of 70 °C and the heat was<br>
then turned off. At this point, a mixture containing 9.10 g of tetrachlorosilane and 25.5 g of<br>
dimethyldichlorosilane was added directly to the reaction flask via a long-stem funnel in<br>
rapid fashion over a period of about 2-7 minutes. The treated slurry was then allowed to stir<br>
as it cooled to room temperature over a 60-minute period.<br>
[0020] To the stirred slurry was added 600 mL of a solution containing 25 percent by<br>
weight of sodium hydroxide, in order to adjust the pH in the range of 3.4 to 3.7. The<br>
neutralized slurry was transferred to the Buchner funnel and vacuum filtered to removed the<br>
aqueous phase. The filter cake was then washed repeatedly with copious amounts of water<br>
until the filtrate read less than 100 micro ohms. After allowing it to air-dry overnight, the<br>
filter cake was transferred to plastic pails with lids and spray dried as follows.<br>
[0021] The air-dried treated silica was re-slurried in deionized water to provide a slurry<br>
containing 20-40 percent by weight of the treated silica. The slurry was mixed until all of the<br>
solids were broken up. The slurry was then pumped to a Niro Atomizer spray drier at a rate of<br>
about 20 ml/minute with an inlet temperature of 260 °C and an outlet temperature of between<br>
120-140 °C. The dried and treated silica product was collected and stored in glass jars.<br>
[0022] An elemental analysis of the treated silica was conducted by an independent testing<br>
laboratory. The results of elemental analyses obtained for treated silica fillers prepared in<br>
Examples 1-4 are shown in Table 1. In Table 1, MPTES is 3-mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane<br>
HS-CH2CH2CH2-Si(OCH3)3 and DMDCS is dimethyldichlorosilane.<br>
[0023] The new and unexpected results obtained according to the invention, i.e., the deposit<br>
of more siloxane, can be appreciated by comparing Examples 1 and 2, which show that the<br>
Percent Loss was decreased from 58 percent in Example 1 where only the dichlorosilane was<br>
used, to 29 percent in Example 2 where a blend of the dichlorosilane and tetrachlorosilane<br>
were employed. As can be seen in Example 3, a further improvement can be obtained by<br>
addition of other silanes to the blend. Example 4 shows that other silanes without the<br>
tetrahalosilane in the blend or mixture, do not account for improved performance. A<br>
comparison of Examples 3 and 4 shows that rate of addition is not a critical factor in<br>
improving deposits of siloxanes on silica surfaces.<br>
[0024] Thus, the comparison of Example 1 with Example 2 shows a clear improvement.<br>
Example 3 shows that inclusion of other additives do not have a deleterious affect; in fact,<br>
their addition to the blend of dichlorosilanes and tetrahalosilanes may actually be<br>
advantageous in some instances.<br>
[0025] Other variations may be made in compounds, compositions, and methods described<br>
herein without departing from the essential features of the invention. The embodiments of the<br>
invention specifically illustrated herein are exemplary only and not intended as limitations on<br>
their scope except as defined in the appended claims.<br>
