				<td>DESCRIPTION OPTICAL RECORDING MEDIUM<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to an optical recording medium using a chelate dye comprising azo compounds and a metal in a recording layer.<br>
[Background of the Invention]<br>
Since optical recording using a laser enables high density storing and reproduction of data, the development has been advanced in particular in recent years.  As the media for use for optical recording, a magneto-optical recording medium, a phase-change optical recording medium, and an organic dye optical recording medium have been conventionally proposed..<br>
Of these media, an organic dye optical recording medium has been considered to be superior in view of inexpensiveness and simple manufacturing process.<br>
Examples of organic dye optical recording media include a recordable compact disc (CD-R) comprising an organic dye layer having laminated thereon a metal layer having high reflectance which is capable of overwriting can be exemplified.<br>
As the dyes for a recording layer of CD-R, various dyes, e.g., cyanine dyes, phthalocyanine dyes, metal chelate dyts's, etc. , have been proposed and put to practical use.  Focusign on the metal chelate dyes excellent in light fastness and environmentally durable, the present inventors have proposed many optical recording media using metal chelate dyes, including a domestic re-publication No. 3-818057 of PCT international patent publication, and JP-A-6-65514 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application").<br>
In general, the optical recording medium is required to have good storage stability, high light fastness, broad margins, such as recording power, and a high reflectance.  The dyes themselves to be used for optical recording media are also required to have performances capable of realizing these characteristics.<br>
However, it has so far been very difficult to satisfy these characteristics at the same time.<br>
Even when a plurality of dyes are used in<br>
combination so as to compensate for mutual weak points, the properties of a dye inferior in properties are generally liable to be revealed strongly. Accordingly, merely mixing dyes is insufficient to improve the performances of the optical recording medium.<br>
[Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
As a result of extensive studies for attaining<br>
these objects, the present inventors have found that a plurality of performances required of the optical recording medium can be improved at the same time by using, in the recording layer, an azo metal chelate dye comprising a plurality of azo compounds having different structures coordinated to one metal.<br>
That is, the present invention was achieved by an optical recording medium comprising a substrate and a laser-writable and/or readable recording layer provided thereo, wherein the recording layer contains a chelate dye comprising two or more azo compounds having different structures and a divalent or more metal ion, and the azo compounds are selected from the azo compounds represented by the following general formula (I) and the general formula (II)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein ring A represents an aromatic heterocyclic ring which may have substituent(s); ring B represents an aromatic hydrocarbon ring, an aromatic heterocyclic ring, or a condensed ring of one of these rings with saturated<br>
ring(s), and these rings each may have substituent(s) other than X; and X represents a group having an active hydrogen;<br>

The metal ions which constitute the chelate dyes according to the present invention are not particularly restricted as long as they are divalent or higher metal ions.  "The metals" used herein means the metals positioned on the left side of the line connecting boron and astatine in the long form of the Periodic Table, i.e., group I exclusive of hydrogen (alkali metal and the copper group) and group II (alkaline earth metal and the zinc group), group III exclusive of boron, group IV exclusive of carbon and silicon, group VIII (the iron group and the platinum group), elements belonging to each subgroup a of groups V, VI and VII, antimony, bismuth and polonium (cf. Rikagaku Jiten, 3rd Ed., enlarged edition, p. 339, Iwanami Shoten Co., Ltd.).  The preferred examples of these metals include Mg, Al, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Zr, Ru, Rh, Pd, In, Sn, Hf, Os, Pt and Hg, and Co, Ni, Cu and Pd are particularly preferred.<br>
The specific examples of the chelate dyes according to the present invention are shown below, but the present invention is not limited thereto.<br>
Further, in the following specific examples, for example, a chelate dye formed by the following two kinds of azo dyes:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
and Ni is represented as follows<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In the present invention, the producing method of a chelate dye comprising two or more azo compounds having different structures and a divalent or more metal ion includes the following method 1 or method 2.<br>
Method 1:<br>
A method of dissolving chelate dye a having azo compound P having the same structure alone as ligands and chelate dye b having azo compound Q having the same structure different in structure from the azo compound P alone in an appropriate solvent, and then allowing the solution to stand at room temperature (about 15 to 30°C) for 6 hours or more, to thereby perform the exchange of ligands (scheme 1) . [Scheme 1]<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Method 2:<br>
A method of mixing a plurality of azo compounds (e.g., P and Q) and a compound containing a metal ion, to thereby perform a chelation reaction (scheme 2). [Scheme 2]<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
In the above scheme 1, the producing method of a chelate dye of the present invention was described taking a case of using two kinds of chelate dye a and chelate dye b each having the same ligands in method 1 as an example.  In scheme 2, a case of using two kinds of azo compounds P and Q was explained by way of example.  However, the chelate dyes in method 1 and the azo compounds in method 2 may be 1 three or more kinds.<br>
In method 1, i.e., in the case of producing the chelate dye of the present invention by a ligand .exchange reaction, it is necessary to take reaction time of generally 6 hours or more at room temperature, preferably 12 hours or more, and more preferably 24 hours or more. Specifically, a reaction solution is allowed to stand for 6 hours or more, preferably 12 hours or more, and more preferably 24 hours or more. When a reaction solution is heated, a ligand exchange reaction is expected to progress faster than the case of allowing to stand at room temperature, but if the reaction solution is heated at 100°C or more, there is a fear that the dyes might be deteriorated or decomposed.<br>
When the reaction time is less than the above range, the reaction results in discontinuance before progressing sufficiently.  Therefore, for instance, when a recording layer of an optical recording medium is formed using the reaction as it is, or when the chelate dye is recovered from the reaction solution and used without purifying, the amount of the chelate dye of the present invention occupied in the entire amount of the obtained dye is not sufficient, and probably the performance cannot be exhibited sufficiently.  Further, when the objective dye is obtained by purification, the efficient is poor since the proportion of the compound corresponding to impurities is too much.<br>
There is no upper limit in the reaction time but generally the time until ligand exchange reaction in the solution reaches the equilibrium state should be sufficient.<br>
A chelate dye increased in purify by refining may be used in the optical recording medium according to the present invention, alternatively a chelate dye obtained by the above method 1, method 2 or other producing methods may be used without purification (mixture as it is)-.  The purification can be performed by recrystallization, various kinds of chromatographies or other well-known methods.<br>
In the optical recording medium according to the present invention, the proportion of the chelate dye of the present invention in the entire amount of dyes in a recording layer is preferably 5 mol% or more, more preferably 10 mol% or more. When the optical recording medium contains a plurality of chelate dyes of the present invention, the above amount is the lower limit of the total of chelate dyes. When the amount of the chelate dye of the present invention is less than 5 mol%, there is a fear that the performance of the chelate dye cannot be exhibited sufficiently.<br>
The upper limit of the proportion of the chelate dye according to the present invention is not restricted, but the upper limit of the proportion is 100 mol% when the<br>
chelate dye is used after being purified, with any of the dyes obtained by method 1 and method 2.<br>
When the chelate dye obtained by method 1 is used without purification, the proportion of the chelate dye of the present invention is generally 50 mol% or less per one compound, since the proportion becomes maximum when ligand exchange reaction reaches the equilibrium state.<br>
The recording layer of the optical recording medium of the present invention may contain chelate dyes comprising azo dyes having the same ring structure alone, as the ligands, selected from the azo compounds represented by the general formula (I) and the general formula (II), and other dyes, e.g., cyanine dyes, phthalocyanine dyes, azo dyes, triarylmethane dyes, squarylium dyes, and metal-containing indoaniline dyes, within the range not impairing the effect of the present invention.<br>
Preferably, the proportion of the chelate dye according to the present invention (the total amount when a plurality of dyes are used) is from 5 to 95 mol% based on the entire amount of the dyes contained in the recording layer, and the residual moiety comprises chelate dyes having azo compounds of the same structure alone as the ligands.  More preferably, the proportion of the chelate dye according to the present invention is from 10 to 90 mol%, and the remainder comprises chelate dyes having azo compounds of the same structure alone as the ligands.<br>
The content of the chelate dye of the present invention in the reaction solution in dye synthesis process according to the above method 1, method 2 and other methods, or in the solution for forming the recording layer in the recording layer forming process of the optical recording medium can be measured and controlled by the liquid phase chromatography.<br>
The optical recording medium according to the present invention fundamentally comprises a substrate and a recording layer containing a chelate dye, but a subbing layer may be provided on the substrate, if necessary.  The example of preferred layer constitution include a recordable type recording medium having a reflecting layer and a protective layer laminated on the recording layer in this order to make the medium to have a high reflectance.<br>
As such a substrate, substrates comprising resins, e.g., acrylate resins, methacrylate resins, polycarbonate resins, polyolefin resins (amorphous polyolefin), polyester resins, polystyrene resins and epoxy resins, substrates comprising glass, and a glass substrate having provided thereon a resin layer comprising a radiation-curable resin such as a photo-curable resin can be exemplified.<br>
Injection molded polycarbonate is preferred in view of high productivity, an economical aspect and moisture absorption resistance.<br>
Amorphous polyolefin is preferred in view of chemical resistance and moisture absorption resistance.<br>
A glass substrate is preferred in view of high responsibility.<br>
A resin plate or a resin layer may be provided in contiguous to a recording layer and guide grooves and pits for the light for recording/reproduction may be provided on the resin plate or the resin layer.<br>
The film thickness of the recording layer containing an azo metal chelate dye comprising azo compounds and a metal in the optical recording medium according to the present invention is from 10 to 5,000 nm, preferably from 70 to 3,000 nm.<br>
A recording layer can be formed by ordinarily used film-forming method, e.g., a vacuum deposition method, a sputtering method, a doctor blade method, a cast method, a spinner method and an immersion method.  A spinner method is preferred from the viewpoint of mass production and an economical aspect.<br>
A binder can be used, if necessary. Well-known binders, e.g., polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, a ketone resin, nitrocellulose, cellulose acetate, polyvinyl butyral, polycarbonate can be used in the present invention. When a binder is used in the present invention, it is preferred that the chelate dye of the present<br>
invention is contained in a. recording layer in an amount of 10 wt% or more.<br>
When a recording layer is formed by the spinner method, the number of revolution is preferably from 500 to 15,000 rpm, and treatment such as heating or application of solvent vapor may be performed after spin coating according to circumstances.<br>
For improving the stability and light fastness of a chelate dye, a transition metal chelate compound (e.g., acetylacetonate chelate, bisphenyldithiol, salicylaldehyde oxime, bisdithio-a-diketone) may be contained in a recording layer as a singlet oxygen quencher, and a recording sensitivity improving agent, such as a metal compound, may be contained for improving recording sensitivity.  The metal compound is a compound containing a metal such as a transition metal in the form of atom, ion or cluster, and the examples of the metal compounds include organic metal compounds, e.g., ethylenediamine complex, azomethine complex, phenylhydroxylamine complex, phenanthroline complex, dihydroxyazobenzene complex, dioxime complex, nitrosoaminophenol complex, pyridyltriazine complex, acetylacetonate complex, metallocene complex, and porphyrin complex.  The metal atom is not particularly restricted but a transition metal is preferred.<br>
When a recording layer is formed by coating according to a doctor blade method, a cast method, a spinner method or an immersion method, in particular, a spinner method, any solvents can be used with no limitation as long as they can dissolve the dye of the present invention and do not damage the substrate.  For example, ketone alcohol solvents, e.g., diacetone alcohol, and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-butanone, cellosolve solvents, e.g., methyl cellosolve and ethyl cellosolve, hydrocarbon solvents, e.g., n-hexane and n-octane, hydrocarbon solvents, e.g., cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, ethylcyclohexane, dimethylcyclohexane, n-butylcyclohexane, tert-butylcyclohexane, and cyclooctane, ether solvents, e.g., diisopropyl ether and dibutyl ether, perfluoroalkyl alcohol solvents, e.g., tetrafluoropropanol and octafluoropentanol, and hydroxy ester solvents, e.g., methyl lactate, ethyl lactate, and methyl 2-hydroxyisobutyrate can be used.<br>
In the case of vacuum deposition method, a<br>
recording layer is formed by charging a crucible equipped in a vacuum container with the components of the recording layer, e.g., the dye of the present invention and, if necessary, other dyes and various additives, exhausting the air in the vacuum container until 10"2 to 1CT5 Pa or so with an appropriate vacuum pump, heating the crucible to evaporate the recording layer components, and depositing<br>
the evaporated components on the substrate placed opposite to the crucible.<br>
A reflecting layer may be formed on the recording layer, and the thickness of the reflecting layer is preferably from 50 to 300 nm. As the material of the reflecting layer, metals having sufficiently high reflectance at the wavelength of the light of reproduction, e.g., Au, Al, Ag, Cu, Ti, Cr, Ni, Pt, Ta, Cr and Pd can be used alone or as alloys.  Of these metals, Au, Al and Ag are high in reflectance and preferred as the materials of the reflecting layer.  The following metals and semi-metals may be used with Au, Al and Ag as the main components, e.g., Mg, Se, Hf, V, Nb, Ru, W, Mn, Re, Fe, Co, Rh, Ir, Cu, Zn, Cd, Ga, In, Si, Ge, Te, Pb, Po, Sn and Bi.  Those containing Ag as the main component are particularly preferably used from the viewpoints that the cost is inexpensive, high reflectance can be easily obtained, and a beautiful print with a white ground can be obtained when a print-receiving layer, which is described later, is provided.  Here, the main component means the component whose content is 50% or more.<br>
It is also possible to form a multilayer film as a reflecting layer by alternately laminating a low refractive index thin layer and a high refractive index thin layer with the materials other than metals.<br>
The reflecting layer can be formed, e.g., by a sputtering method, an ion plating method, a chemical deposition method or a vacuum deposition method. Further, a well-known inorganic or organic intermediate layer and adhesive layer can also be provided on the substrate or under the reflecting layer for the purpose of improving the reflectance, recording characteristics and adhesive property.<br>
The materials of a protective layer provided on the reflecting layer are not particularly restricted so long as they can protect the reflecting layer from the external force. As the organic materials, thermoplastic resins, thermosetting resins, electron beam-curable resins and UV-curable resins can be exemplified.  As inorganic materials, SiC&gt;2, SiN4, MgF2 and SnO2 can be exemplified.<br>
Thermoplastic resins and thermosetting resins are dissolved in an appropriate solvent to prepare a coating solution, the thus-obtained coating solution is coated and dried, thereby a protective layer is formed.  UV-curable resins is coated as it is, or dissolved in an appropriate solvent and the obtained coating solution is coated and irradiated with UV light to be cured, thereby a protective layer is formed.  As UV-curable resins, acrylate resins, e.g., urethane acrylate, epoxy acrylate and polyester acrylate can be used in the present invention.  These<br>
materials may be used alone or as.mixture, and they may be used as a monolayer or as a multilayer film.<br>
A protective layer is formed by various methods, e.g., a spin coat method, a cast method, a sputtering method, and a chemical deposition method similarly to the recording layer. A spin coat method is preferred of these methods.<br>
The thickness of a protective layer is generally from 0.1 to 100 pm, but from 3 to 30 pm is preferred in the present invention.<br>
The recording layer of the optical recording medium according to the present invention may be provided on both sides or either one side of the substrate.  A substrate may further be adhered to the reflecting layer side.  Further, two optical recording media may be adhered by opposing reflecting layers mutually as inner surface. A UV-curable resin layer and an inorganic thin layer may be provided on the specular side of the substrate (the side on which a recording layer is not provided) for the purpose of surface protection and preventing dusts from.adhering.<br>
A print-receiving layer capable of writing (printing) with various printers, such as an ink jet printer and a heat-sensitive transfer printer, or with various writing tools, may be provided on the side which is not the plane of incidence of the recording/reproduction light.<br>
Recording on the thus-obtained optical recording medium is performed by applying laser beam, preferably semiconductor laser beam, converged into 100 nm or so to the recording layer provided on one side or both sides of the substrate.  The irradiated part of the recording layer with laser beam causes thermal deformation, e.g., decomposition, heat evolution and fusion by the absorption of laser beam energy.<br>
The reproduction of the recorded data is effected by reading the difference in reflectance between the part where thermal deformation has occurred and the part where thermal deformation has not occurred.<br>
The laser beams which are used for the optical recording medium according to the present invention include N2, He-Cd, Ar, He-Ne, ruby, a semiconductor, and a dye laser.  A semiconductor laser is particularly preferred due to its light weight, easy handling property and compactness. <example><br>
