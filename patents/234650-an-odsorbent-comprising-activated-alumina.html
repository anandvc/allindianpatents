TITLE OF THE INVENTION: CO-FORMED BASE-TREATED ALUMINAS FOR WATER AND CO2 REMOVAL<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention pertains to alumina adsorbents for removing at least water and carbon dioxide from a fluid.<br>
[0002] In the pre-purification of air, it is desirable to remove ambient water and CO2 prior to cryogenic distillation. Since water and CO2 form solids at liquid air temperatures, these trace air impurities must be removed to avoid plugging in the distillation system. [0003] Alumina is typically used as a desiccant in air pre-purification systems. Alumina has several advantages in this application including (1) low cost, (2) high volumetric water capacity, (3) simultaneous water and CO2 adsorption and (4) easy desorption of water.<br>
[0004] It has been found that if alumina is treated with basic salts, its CO2 capacity can be increased. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,656,064 (Golden et al.) and 6,125,655 (Millet et al.), for example, teach applying the basic salt to the alumina by an aqueous impregnation technique. Although this technique improves the CO2 capacity of the alumina, the present inventors are aware of the following drawbacks associated with the technique. Firstly, the impregnation technique deposits salts in the pore structure of the alumina. This lowers the alumina surface area, which in turn lowers its water capacity. Secondly, the impregnation technique requires additional processing steps (e.g., impregnation followed by activation), which add to the complexity of manufacturing the material and increases its cost.<br>
[0005] The formation of alumina/salt composite adsorbents by adding basic salts during the pelletizing process has been previously described. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,935,894 (Kanazirev) describes a method for preparing an alumina-based catalyst<br><br>
06601 USA<br>
or adsorbent by contacting activated alumina powder with an aqueous solution of at least<br>
two different alkali metals, wherein at least one of the alkali metals is derived from a<br>
carboxylic acid alkali metal salt.   During the activation process, the organic anion is<br>
decomposed, leaving a metal oxide.   These materials are said to show improved CO2<br>
capacity over materials produced with just one alkali metal.<br>
[0006]    In addition to their use in air pre-purification processes, composite aluminas are<br>
known to be useful as adsorbents in other separation processes.<br>
[0007]    For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,427,995 to Ziebarth et al. discloses an alumina<br>
adsorbent for adsorbing NOx and SOx from waste gases. The adsorbent is prepared by<br>
adding an alumina stabilizing agent (e.g., silica, rare earths, titania, zirconia and alkaline<br>
earths) to precipitated alumina, forming a slurry, milling and spray drying the slurry to<br>
form stabilized spheroidal alumina particles, and impregnating the particles with an alkali<br>
metal or alkaline earth metal to form the stabilized adsorbent.<br>
[0008]    U.S. Patent No. 5,316,998 to Lee et al. discloses an HCI adsorbent, methods of<br>
making and using the adsorbent, wherein the adsorbent comprises an activated alumina<br>
and about 5 wt% of an alkali metal oxide promoter.   The alkali metal oxide is derived<br>
from a water soluble, alkali metal salt of an organic compound which decomposes at<br>
temperatures below about 500°C.<br>
[0009]    U.S. Patent No. 5,096,871 to Lever et al. discloses alumina-containing acid<br>
adsorbents for removing acidic materials from fluids. The adsorbents comprise activated<br>
alumina and an amorphous alkali aluminum silicate. The adsorbents are prepared by a<br>
process comprising treating activated alumina with a (preferably aqueous) solution of an<br>
alkali metal silicate followed by an alkali metal aluminate, forming agglomerates of the<br>
treated alumina at a temperature below about 90°C, aging the agglomerates at a<br>
temperature in the range of 20-90°C,  and calcining the aged  agglomerates at a<br>
temperature in the range of 200-500°C.<br><br>
06601 USA<br>
[0010] U.S. Patent No. 4,855,276 to Osborne et al. discloses adsorbent compositions for removing compounds from gases, wherein the adsorbent compositions comprise alumina, carbon and in certain embodiments, sodium bicarbonate and impregnates such as Group 1A metal hydroxides and Group 7A salts of Group 1A metals. The compositions are prepared by a process comprising the steps of forming a mixture of activated alumina, carbon and water into a cohesive unit, and curing the cohesive unit at an elevated temperature.<br>
[0011] U.S. Patent No. 4,755,499 to Neal et al. discloses adsorbents comprising (a) an alumina substrate having a pore volume between 0.4 and 0.8 cc/g, and (b) an alkali or alkaline earth component, for example, sodium carbonate, wherein the amount of the alkali or alkaline earth component is between 50 and 400µ g/rn2 of the substrate. The adsorbents are said to be outstandingly effective for the removal of nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides and hydrogen sulfide from waste gas streams. The patent teaches loading the alkali or alkaline earth component onto the alumina substrate by spraying the substrate with a solution of a salt of the alkali or alkaline earth component. [0012] Despite the foregoing developments, it is desired to provide an improved process for removing water and/or CO2 from a gas stream. It is further desired to provide an improved adsorbent and an improved apparatus for use in such a process. [0013] All references cited herein are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.<br>

06601 USA<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0018] The invention is based on our discovery that the method of formation of an alumina/metal salt composite adsorbent has a significant effect on its performance for the removal of CO2 and water from gas streams.<br>
[0019] Conventional methods for forming activated alumina adsorbents have generally consisted of the four following steps.<br><br>
06601 USA<br>
[0020]   Step 1.   Activation:   Aluminum hydrate is converted into aluminum oxide by<br>
activation at temperatures up to 1000°C.   This process produces fine particle, porous<br>
aluminum oxide powder (typically 1 to 100 microns), which must be formed into larger<br>
particle sizes to make useful, activated alumina particles for fixed bed applications.<br>
[0021]   Step 2.   Pelletizing:  The activated alumina powder formed in step 1 is added<br>
with water in a pelletizing machine to produced formed activated alumina particles (or<br>
pellets), typically spheres, of 0.5 to 5 mm in diameter.<br>
[0022]   Step 3.  Aging:  The formed pellets are aged at up to 100°C and 100% RH for<br>
up to 12 hours to impart strength to the finished product.<br>
[0023]   Step 4.  Reactivation: The formed pellets are then heated at temperatures from<br>
100 to 500°C to produce a final product with a low residual water content and high<br>
adsorption capacity.<br>
[0024]    In conventional processes for adding CO2/H2O promoters (or additives) to the<br>
activated alumina, the promoters have been added by spray impregnation of the final<br>
formed activated alumina product with aqueous solutions of the desired promoter. Such<br>
aqueous   impregnation   techniques   require   the   extra   production   steps   of   spray<br>
impregnation and a final reactivation.<br>
[0025]   The   preferred   adsorbent   preparation   process   of   the   present   invention<br>
(sometimes described herein as "co-formation") comprises the addition of solid salts of<br>
alkali metals, alkaline earth metals and/or ammonium ion to the activated alumina<br>
powder during the pelletization step.  The solid salts and activated alumina powder are<br>
physically mixed in the pelletizing step to form composite pellets. Production via physical<br>
mixture (which as defined herein means combining and mixing at least two different<br>
solids, optionally in the presence of a liquid) has several advantages over the aqueous<br>
impregnation approach.   Firstly, production of the adsorbent involves fewer synthesis<br>
steps, which results in a lower cost adsorbent.   Secondly, the adsorbent has a higher<br><br>
06601 USA<br>
surface area and water capacity than a material produced by spray impregnation of<br>
formed alumina beads.<br>
[0026]   In addition, we unexpectedly found the following surprising benefits associated<br>
with the adsorbent of the invention: 1) the CO2 capacity of the adsorbent of the invention<br>
was higher than that of the impregnated material at the same salt loading; and 2) the<br>
adsorbent   of  the   invention   had   higher   hydrothermal   stability   compared   to   the<br>
impregnated material.<br>
[0027]   Thus, a first aspect of the invention comprises a process for providing the<br>
adsorbent of the  invention.    The adsorbent providing process  preferably includes<br>
modified versions of the four steps, discussed above, which are employed to produce<br>
conventional activated alumina adsorbents.<br>
[0028]   The first step is the activation step. Conventional means for providing activated<br>
alumina particles are suitable for use in the inventive process, but the invention is not<br>
limited thereto.   Thus, for example, aluminum hydrate can be converted into aluminum<br>
oxide by activation at temperatures up to 1000°C.   Preferably, the activated alumina<br>
particles (or solids) range in diameter from 0.5 to 100 microns.<br>
[0029]   The second step is the pellitizing step. This step is modified from conventional<br>
pellitizing in that it includes the addition of promoter solids to the activated alumina from<br>
the first step.  The promoter solids are preferably alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal<br>
salts or an ammonium ion salt, with alkali metal salts being most preferred. The salts are<br>
preferably  carbonates,   bicarbonates   or  phosphates,   more   preferably  carbonates,<br>
bicarbonates or phosphates of lithium, sodium or potassium, and even more preferably<br>
comprise at least one member selected from the group consisting of alkali metal<br>
carbonates, alkali metal bicarbonates and alkali metal phosphates.  Most preferably, the<br>
salt is potassium carbonate.    The promoter solids are preferably loaded onto the<br><br>
06601 USA<br>
activated alumina in an amount from 0.5 to 10 wt% based on the weight of the composite<br>
metal salt/alumina material.<br>
[0030]   Contrary to the teachings of U.S. Patent No. 6,125,655, it is not preferred to<br>
post-treat the final activated product with compounds and conditions that promote the<br>
formation of alkali metal oxides.   Accordingly, preferred embodiments of the invention<br>
exclude alkali metal oxides, alkaline earth metal oxides and/or oxides of ammonium ion<br>
from the adsorbent.  In certain of these embodiments, alumina is the only metal oxide in<br>
the adsorbent.<br>
[0031]   One or more promoters can be added to the activated alumina to form the<br>
adsorbent   of  the   invention;   however,   in   certain   embodiments,   it   is   considered<br>
advantageous to mix only one salt (e.g., alkali metal salt, alkaline earth metal salt or<br>
ammonium ion salt) with the activated alumina solid.   In certain of these embodiments,<br>
only one alkali metal salt solid is added to the activated alumina solid, such that the<br>
adsorbent comprises only one alkali metal salt.<br>
[0032]   The combined solids are physically mixed during the pelletizing step. Pelletizing<br>
is preferably conducted in a pelletizing machine to produce composite pellets, typically<br>
spheres, of 0.5 to 5 mm in diameter.<br>
[0033]    It is within the scope of the invention to add water to the mixture of solids for the<br>
purpose of binding small alumina particles together to form larger alumina particles, so<br>
long as aqueous impregnation of the activated alumina solids is not achieved. However,<br>
the water is substantially free of any promoter solids.   The water is deemed to be<br>
substantially free of promoter solids provided that the water as applied to the alumina<br>
particles contains less than 0.1 wt.% promoter solids. Thus, in preferred embodiments of<br>
the invention, the entire process is conducted without adding an aqueous mixture (i.e.,<br>
solution, dispersion, etc.) of promoter solids to the activated alumina.<br><br>
06601 USA<br>
[0034] The amount of water added in the pelletizing step is also a distinguishing feature of certain embodiments of the invention. While U.S. Patent No. 5,935,894 teaches at Example 1 the use of an aqueous solution of promoter solids at a ratio of 0.27 liters/kg of solids, preferred embodiments of the present invention include the use of more than 0.27 liters of water per kg of solids, and more preferably at least 0.4 liters/kg. [0035] The third step is the aging step. The aging step is not particularly limited and can be conducted, for example, under conventional conditions. Thus, the composite pellets from second step are preferably aged at up to 100°C and 100% RH for up to 12 hours to impart strength to the finished product.<br>
[0036] The fourth step is the reactivation step. The reactivation step is not particularly limited and can be conducted, for example, under conventional conditions. Thus, the aged pellets from the third step are preferably heated at temperatures from 100 to 500°C to produce the adsorbent of the invention. The adsorbent preferably comprises beads ranging in diameter from 0.3 to 5 mm. However, it is also within the scope of the invention to provide the composite adsorbent in the form of an extrudate or sphere. [0037] In addition to the adsorbent preparation and gas stream treatment aspects of the present invention described above, the invention comprises adsorbents prepared by the process of the invention and used in the treatment of the invention. The adsorbent has a preferred surface area of at least 250 m2/g, more preferably at least 280 m2/g. [0038] In preferred embodiments, the water capacity of the adsorbent is substantially undiminished relative to a reference water capacity of the activated alumina solids. As shown in Example 2, below, the water capacity of the (co-formed) adsorbent was only 0.1 wt% less than that of the reference activated alumina. The expression "substantially undiminished" as used herein means that the water capacity is reduced by not more than 0.5 wt% relative to the reference alumina. In absolute terms, it is preferred that the adsorbent have a water capacity of at least 14 wt% at 25°C and 60% RH.<br><br>
06601 USA<br>
[0039]    It is further preferred that the adsorbent have a CO2 capacity higher than a<br>
reference CO2 capacity of a corresponding impregnated adsorbent.   See, e.g., Example<br>
1, below.<br>
[0040]    It is still further preferred that the adsorbent have a hydrothermal stability higher<br>
than a reference hydrothermal stability of a corresponding impregnated adsorbent. See,<br>
e.g., Example 3, below.<br>
[0041]   In another aspect of the invention, the adsorbent is used in a process for<br>
removing at least CO2 and water from a gas stream.   Other components of the gas<br>
stream, such as, e.g., nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia and<br>
other acid gases, can also be removed in certain embodiments.   Suitable gas streams<br>
for use in the inventive process should contain CO2 and water, and include, e.g., air,<br>
synthesis gas and natural gas.<br>
[0042]   Preferred process conditions included an adsorption temperature from 0 to<br>
50°C, and an adsorption pressure from 1.5 to 50 bar absolute. The process is preferably<br>
conducted under temperature swing adsorption conditions or pressure swing adsorption<br>
conditions.<br>
[0043]    In another aspect of the invention, an apparatus for performing the inventive<br>
process is provided.    The apparatus preferably includes:    (a) a gas stream source<br>
containing a gaseous mixture comprising CO2 and water; (b) a chamber containing the<br>
adsorbent; (c) a feed conduit for conveying the gas stream from the gas stream source<br>
to the chamber; and (d) a product conduit adapted to convey a purified gas stream out of<br>
the chamber after CO2 and water have been adsorbed from the gas stream by the<br>
adsorbent.<br>
[0044]   The adsorbent can be used as the sole adsorbent in the adsorption chamber.<br>
The key advantage of using a single adsorbent is that there are no adsorbent layers to<br>
intermix in the event of a bed disturbance (fluidization).  The use of the adsorbent as a<br><br>
06601 USA<br>
sole material in the adsorption chamber is for applications including water and carbon dioxide removal from synthesis gas (mixtures of carbon monoxide and hydrogen) and natural gas. The adsorbent can also be used in conjunction with other adsorbents. For example, in the case of air pre-purification, the adsorbent can be placed on the feed end of the adsorption chamber to remove water and carbon dioxide. Downstream of the adsorbents typically are zeolites, which further remove other air impurities like nitrous oxide, hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide that breaks through the adsorbent.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0045]   The invention will be illustrated in more detail with reference to the following Examples, but it should be understood that the present invention is not deemed to be limited thereto. [0046]    Example 1<br>
[0047] The CO2 capacity of various alumina-based adsorbents was tested by measuring CO2 breakthrough curves at 25°C with 100 psig feed air containing 400 ppm CO2. The samples were regenerated in 150°C N2 prior to adsorption measurements. The results in Table 1 represent the CO2 capacity after 3 adsorption/regeneration cycles. The base alumina was AA-300 from Alcan. Samples produced by aqueous impregnation were prepared by adding sufficient solution to just fill the pore volume of the formed alumina (8x14 mesh), the concentration of the solution being such as to produce various weight per cent (solute/total weight of solids) loading of the solute on the alumina after drying at 120°C. In the case of the co-formed products, the solid basic salt was added to powdered activated alumina (about 10 microns) in the right proportions to give the desired metal salt loading. The mixture of salt and alumina powder was prepared in a laboratory pelletizer and water was added as needed to form 8x14 mesh beads. The pellets were aged for 8 hours at 90°C and calcined at 400°C for 2 hours. The results of<br><br>
06601 USA<br>
the CO2 capacity measurements are shown in Table 1. In all cases, the solute employed<br>
was K2CO3.<br>
[0048]<br><br>
[0049] The results in Table 1 clearly show that addition of K2CO3 to alumina improves its CO2 capacity. The unobvious result is that the CO2 capacity is a strong function of the method of manufacture of the adsorbent. Addition of 8 wt% K2CO3 to a formed alumina by aqueous impregnation produced a material with 2.1 times the CO2 capacity of the base alumina. However, when the K2CO3 was added prior to the forming step, the CO2 capacity increase was about 2.7 times. The co-formation production method improved the CO2 capacity 25% over the conventional aqueous impregnation technique. [0050]     Example 2<br>
[0051]   Some of the samples from Example 1 were tested for N2 BET surface area and water capacity at 25°C and 60% RH. The results of these measurements are shown in Table 2. [0052]<br><br>
[0053]   The results in Table 2 show that incorporation of K2CO3 at an 8-weight % level reduces the surface area of the base alumina.  However, adding the K2CO3 by aqueous<br><br>
)6601 USA<br>
impregnation reduces the alumina surface area more than if the K2CO3 is introduced by the co-formation technique. Impregnation results in a 22% drop in surface area, while the co-formation process results in an 8% loss in surface area. Another key aspect of the co-formation technique is its effect on the water capacity of the alumina. Aqueous impregnation to 8 wt% K2CO3 results in a loss in water capacity of the alumina at 60% RH of 8%. Adding 8 wt% K2CO3 using the co-formation technique results in no change in the water capacity of the material. This is particularly important since a key utility of the alumina in this process is water removal. U.S. Patent No. 6,125,655 shows that adding alkali metal oxides to alumina improves its CO2 capacity. However, the results in the '655 patent also show that addition of the metal oxides reduces the water capacity of the material from 5 to 16% (Figures 3, 4 and 5). This example shows that the co-formation process does not substantially affect the water capacity of the formed alumina product. [0054]    Example 3<br>
[0055] It is well known in the prior art that alumina desiccants lose water adsorption performance over time due to hydrothermal aging (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,968,234 to Midgett et al.). During thermal regeneration of the wet alumina, steam is generated which slowly converts the aluminum oxide to aluminum hydroxide. This chemical conversion results in a loss of surface area of the alumina with a concomitant loss in water capacity.<br>
[0056] We have found that formation of base modified alumina by the co-formation process improves the hydrothermal stability of the alumina relative to the as-formed alumina and the base-modified alumina produced by aqueous impregnation on the formed alumina piece. The results in Table 3 show the surface area (SA) of as-received alumina, 8 wt% K2CO3 alumina formed by aqueous impregnation and 8 wt% K2CO3 formed via co-formation after treating in steam at 250°C for various lengths of time. The<br><br>
'     06601 USA<br>
values in parentheses represent the loss in surface area relative to fresh material prior to<br>
steaming.<br>
[0057]<br><br>
[0058] The results in Table 3 clearly show that incorporation of K2CO3 onto the alumina helps retard the aging process. The results also show that the method of formation of the base-modified material also impacts its ability to withstand hydrothermal aging. The K2CO3 loaded material produced by aqueous impregnation on the formed alumina lost 18 and 34% of its surface area following 4 and 8 hours of steaming, respectively. The adsorbent produced by co-formation was the most resistant to hydrothermal aging, showing surface area losses of 8 and 27% following steaming times of 4 and 8 hours, respectively. The results in Table 3 show that: (1) base incorporation into alumina retards hydrothermal aging; and (2) production of base-modified alumina by a co-formation process improves the hydrothermal stability over the aqueous impregnation production technique. [0059]    Example 4<br>
[0060] Bound alumina bodies were formed by adding 55 liters of water to 100 kg of activated alumina powder (92 kg) and potassium carbonate (8 kg). The mixture was then formed into beads ranging in size from 4 to 12 mesh. The beads were aged for 8 hours at 90°C and calcined at 400°C for 2 hours. Following calcinations, some formed beads of 6 mesh size were tested for crush strenath in a chatillon compression test unit.<br><br>
06601 USA<br>
The average crush strength measured for 50 beads was 22 lbs.   This is significantly<br>
higher than the crush strength of a composition in accordance with U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,935,894, which employed a water/solid ratio of 0.27 liters of water/kg of solid in<br>
Example 1 to obtain a composition having a crush strength of only 14 lbs.  The current<br>
example used a water to solid ratio of 0.55 liters/kg.<br>
[0061]   While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific<br>
examples thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and<br>
modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
