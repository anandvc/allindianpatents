				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an electroluminescent dashboard. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention regards an electroluminescent dashboard.<br>
In vehicles, and in particular in two-wheeled and/or three-wheeled vehicles, the dashboards currently used are made up of an outer shell which may be of various shapes and/or dimensions, and has a wider side facing outwards and a shaped part which is housed inside a corresponding seat.<br>
This shell carries, on its wider side, almost all the devices displaying the state of the vehicle; namely, a tachymetric scale, with corresponding indicator, further indicators, and various warning devices.<br>
The opposite side of the shell, which is usually shaped so as to be placed in the corresponding seat, generally has a series of connections for the warning devices that are connected to the electrical system of the vehicle. For example, illumination of the tachymetric scale is by means of light sources located inside the dashboard body, i.e.., behind or at the side of the area to be illuminated.<br>
In any case, the structure of a traditional dashboard of this kind always appears as a closed and opaque box, and, at the moment of its installation, the<br>
only visible part or surface is the one facing the user, which consists of the various indicators.<br>
A structure of this kind presents the drawback of having a certain size and a certain weight.<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to solve the problems referred to above by providing a dashboard which is particularly light and not very bulky, can be easily and properly accommodated on a vehicle, and ensures optimal illumination for the various auxiliary elements that make it up..<br>
The said purpose according to the present invention is achieved by providing a dashboard of the electroluminescent type, as specified in detail in Claim 1.<br>
Further characteristics are present and are described in the dependent claims.<br>
In this way, by means of the aforementioned electroluminescent dashboard according to the present invention, it is evident that a dashboard is provided which is particularly light and thin, but sturdy, always well illuminated, adaptable to the individual vehicle, and attractive from the aesthetic point of view.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an electroluminescent dashboard characterized in that it is a transparent dashboard which consists of a portion of front shell and a portion of rear shell hermetically sealed together by means of a gasket set in between, and inside which is set a plate made of transparent material bearing the characters and/or figures of a tachymetric scale which co-operate with a corresponding mobile and oscillating pointer, which is set in front of the plate made of transparent material having associated to it a plurality of LED for supplying light.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The characteristics and advantages of an electroluminescent dashboard according to the present invention will emerge more clearly from the ensuing.<br>
description, which is given merely to provide a non-limiting example, with reference to the attached schematic drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a front view of a first embodiment of a dashboard of the electroluminescent type according to the present invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a section according to the trace II-II of Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 is a section according to the trace III-III of Figure 1;<br>
Figure 4 is a section according to the trace IV-IV of Figure 1; and<br>
Figure 5 is a section according to a trace identical to that of Figure 4 for a second embodiment of the dashboard according'to the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS<br>
With reference to the figures, a dashboard of the electroluminescent type made according to the invention is .illustrated and designated, as a whole, by 11.<br>
The dashboard 11 according to the invention is represented by a transparent dashboard which is made up of a front shell portion 12 and a rear shell portion<br>
13,	which are sealed together by a perimetral gasket<br>
14,	for example, made of silicone. Consequently, unlike<br>
the dashboards so far known, it does not appear as an<br>
opaque  box,  but  rather,  as  has  been  said,  as  a<br>
transparent box 12, 13, inside which a front plate 15<br><br>
made of transparent material is set, on which characters 16 of a tachymetric scale 17 are obtained, which co-operate with a corresponding pointer 18, which is mobile and free to oscillate and is set in front of the plate 15. The tachymetric scale 17 consists, for example, of a thin plate of silk-screen printed polycarbonate applied on the plate 15.<br>
According to the invention, night lighting is obtained by means of an optical prism or of an electroluminescent panel that enables the characters 16 and the edge of the plate 15 to be highlighted. It is immediately evident that the dashboard 11 is completed with a set of warning devices 19 having the normal functions used in motor vehicles.<br>
Figures 1-4 show, in detail, a first embodiment for obtaining a backlighted dashboard according to the invention, when the dashboard is provided with an optical prism effect, as may be seen more clearly in the cross section of Figure 4.<br>
In fact, a light-guide Plexiglas support 15, i.e., the above-mentioned transparent plate, is provided, which enables the effect of a luminous prism to be obtained. The light is emitted by a series of LED 21, the colour of which is chosen according to the requirements in terms of functions, style and cost.<br>
The graphics of the tachymeter,  which is to be<br><br>
illuminated by the prismatic effect referred to above, may be obtained with one of the following solutions:<br>
a)	a light-guide plate 15 with characters in<br>
relief and with a  layer of polycarbonate 20 with<br>
graphical elements to be overlaid;<br>
b)	a  light-guide  plate  15  with  an  area  of<br>
characters and graphics engraved into it, with a layer<br>
of polycarbonate 20 with graphical  elements  to be<br>
overlaid; and<br>
c)	a light-guide plate 15 with characters and<br>
graphics  silk-screen printed directly on the plate<br>
itself.<br>
The solutions indicated by a) and b) involve the presence   of   a   layer   of   silk-screen   printed polycarbonate 20, whereas the solution indicated by c) does not.<br>
The graduated scale 17 will be traversed by the tachymetric pointer 18, which may be back-lighted by a further LED 21a, or may simply be coloured.<br>
Movement of the pointer 18 is obtained by means of a small stepper motor 22 to achieve a greater precision together with saving in terms of space.<br>
The luminous effect of the tachymetric scale may also be obtained through the use of an electroluminescent panel 23, which will replace the light-guide support 15 described previously.<br>
Connection to an electronic control circuit 29 is by means of a special connector 24, shown in Figure 5.<br>
The dashboard is provided with a housing for the LED warning devices 19 and for a multi-function LCD unit 25, for example comprising a clock 26, a (total/trip) odometer 27, and a petrol-level indicator/water thermometer, indicated as a whole by 28. This area is not transparent because it provides, at the back, an electronic circuit 29 which manages the entire system. This circuit receives and transmits signals from and to the outside world by means of a multi-way connector 40.<br>
The set of components making up the LCD unit 25 includes: a filter 30, an elastomer 31 for connection to the electronic control circuit, and a series of LED 32 for illumination.<br>
The set of warning devices 19 is made up, instead, as follows: as many LED 33 as are the warning devices 19, and a base plate 34 made of silk-screen printed polycarbonate bearing the appropriate indications.<br>
The use of the LED 21, 32, 33 presents the advantages of having high-reliability components, of not dissipating heat, and of being of reduced overall dimensions.<br>
The set of warning devices 19 and the LCD unit 25 are covered by an internal mask 35 which hides also an<br>
electronic control circuit 29. All these items are contained within a supporting element 36.<br>
The dashboard 11 is thus englobed in a transparent shell divided into two parts: the rear part 13 and the front part 12, which are closed hermetically together by a silicone-rubber gasket 14.<br>
It is thus possible to obtain forms of any size with the same degree of illumination thanks to the composition of the dashboard according to the present invention.<br>
Advantageously, it is possible to achieve reduced dimensions, in particular as regards the thickness of the dashboard.<br>
The fact that Plexiglas light-guide plates or plates made of a similar transparent material are provided enables the entire dashboard to be extremely light.<br>
The embodiment according to the principles set forth above moreover makes possible a greater reliability, duration and sturdiness, as compared to dashboards of a traditional type.<br>
In addition, according to the invention, a transparent structure of interesting and new stylistic content is achieved.<br><br><br><br><br>
