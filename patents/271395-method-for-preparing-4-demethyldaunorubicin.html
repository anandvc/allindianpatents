METHOD FOR PREPARING 4-DEMETHYLDAUNORUBICIN<br>
Related Applications<br>
[0001]      This Application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional Application No. 60/749,464,<br>
filed on December 13, 2005, in accordance with 35 U.S.C. Section 119(e), and any other<br>
applicable laws. U.S. provisional Application No. 60/749,464 is hereby incoiporated by<br>
reference in its entirety as if set forth fully herein.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0002]      The field of the invention generally relates to chemical methods used to produce<br>
anthracyclines, a compound which is useful as an anticancer chemotherapeutic drug. More<br>
specifically, the field of the invention relates to methods of producing cytostatic anthracyclin<br>
antibiotic 4-demethyldaunorubicin (commonly referred to as "carminomycin") in the form of<br>
Formula (1) (wherein An" is an anion of any strong acid; for example, in one non-limiting case<br>
of 4'-epirubicin, An" comprises Cf).<br><br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0003]      Anthracyclines form one of the largest families of naturally occurring bioactive<br>
compounds. Several members of this family have shown to be clinically effective anti-<br>
neoplastic agents. These include, for example, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, idarubicin,<br>
epirubicin, pirarubicin, zorubicin, aclarubicin, and carminomycin. For instance, these<br><br>
compounds have shown to be useful in the treatment of breast carcinoma, acute lymphocytic<br>
and non-lymphocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and<br>
other solid cancerous tumors.<br>
[0004]      Carminomycin (in the form of Formula (l))is a well-known anthracyclin antibiotic<br>
that is used both in defined clinical applications and as a starting material for synthesis of<br>
multiple 4-modified anthracylins, and in particular, idarubicin (see for example, U.S. Patent No.<br>
7,053,191, the contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).<br>
[0005]      Microbiological production of carminomycin is complicated by a very low<br>
productivity of the known strains of microorganisms, at the level of 0.1 -0.3 g/L. Up until the<br>
present, the synthetic method of preparing carminomycin has been very protracted (involving<br>
10-12 chemical stages) and expensive. In the previously described methods of 4-methoxy<br>
group demethylation, the substrate was daunorubicinone because there had been no known<br>
methods of 4-methoxy group demethylation without breaking of the C-7 glycoside bond. The<br>
most common method of the 4-methoxy group demethylation involves treatment of the<br>
daunorubicinone with a strong Lewis acid, AICI3, in inert solvents such as chlorinated<br>
hydrocarbons (ex. dichloromethane) at boiling temperature. In an attempt to conduct the same<br>
synthesis with daunorubicin, the daunosamine glycoside bond is severed, and the anthracyclin<br>
nucleus is destroyed.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0006]      The present invention is directed to an innovative method for producing<br>
carminomycin using a novel method for the 4-methoxy group demethylation of a widely-<br>
available starting substance daunorubicin, that does not result in the destruction of the C-7<br>
glycoside bond, and that decreases the number of synthesis stages from 10-12 to 1-3.<br>
[0007]      Demethylation is achieved by the treatment of daunorubicin or N-protected<br>
daunorubicin (Formula 2 and Formula 3, respectively) with soft Lewis acids, such as TiHal4,<br><br>
BHal3, MgHal2, where Hal = F, Cl, Br, I in anhydrous solvents, such as alkanes, cycloalkanes,<br>
arenes, halogenoalkanes, simple ethers, CS2, all of which are stable in Lewis acids, at<br>
temperatures 10-80°C.<br><br>
[0008]      Extraction of carminomycin or N-protected carminomycin is achieved by treating the<br>
reaction mass with an aqueous solution of strong organic or mineral acids. After decomposition<br>
of the carminomycin and Lewis acids reactive complex, the reactive mass (in the case of<br>
utilization of water-soluble simple ethers) is extracted with water-insoluble (hydrophobic)<br>
organic solvents such as halogenoalkanes, cycloalkanes, arenes, C4-C6 alcohols and mixtures<br>
thereof. Carminomycin is then extracted as a base.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[0009]       The method of preparing a carminomycin compound using daunorubicin as the<br>
starting material according to the present invention comprises the following steps.<br>
[0010]      I.    Demethylation of daunorubicin or N-protected daunorubicin<br>
[0011]      The demethylation reaction is completed by treating daunorubicin or N-protected<br>
daunorubicin (Formula 2 and Formula 3, respectively) with soft Lewis acids, such as TiHal4,<br>
BHal3, MgHal2, where Hal = F, Cl, Br, I in anhydrous solvents, such as alkanes, cycloalkanes,<br><br>
arenes, halogenoalkanes, simple ethers, CS2, all of which are stable in Lewis acids, at<br>
temperatures in the range of about 10 - 80 °C (as shown in Diagram 1).<br><br>
[0012]      With utilization of the N-protected daunorubicin, the reaction is accomplished with<br>
lesser amounts of by-products (impurities) and a higher yield.<br>
[0013]      The amount of Lewis acid used in the reaction is 1-5 moles per 1 mole of<br>
daunorubicin, preferably 1.5-3 moles.<br>
[0014]      The reaction temperature depends on the strength of the Lewis acid and must provide<br>
for the maximum regioselectivity of the process involving breakage of the 4-OMe bond with<br>
preservation of the 7-O-daunosamine bond, preferably 40-60 °C.<br>
[0015]      The solvents suitable for conduction of the reaction are selected based on the same<br>
principles as for the temperature selection. Preference is given to halogenoalkanes, simple<br>
ethers, and CS2.<br>
[0016]      Extraction of carmmomycin or N-protected carminomycin is performed by treating<br>
the reaction mass with an aqueous solution of strong organic acids, such as oxalic acid,<br>
trifluoroacetic acid or such mineral acids as sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acids pH 2.5±1. After<br>
decomposition of the carminomycin and Lewis acids reactive complex, the reactive mass (in the<br>
case of utilization of water-soluble simple ethers) is extracted with water-insoluble<br><br>
(hydrophobic) organic solvents such as halogenoalkanes, cycloalkanes, arenes, C4-C6 alcohols<br>
and mixtures thereof. Carminomycin may then be extracted as a base.<br>
[0017]      The 3'N-Prot-group, in the case of utilization of N-protected daunorubicin, is<br>
removed immediately upon completion of the synthesis or after further modification of the 4-R<br>
substituent, depending on the goals of synthesis.<br>
[0018]      Example<br>
[0019]      6.25 grams of N-trifluoroacetyldaunorubicin is dissolved in 150 ml of<br>
tetrahydrofurane, and 2.9 grams of unhydrous magnesium chloride is slowly added under<br>
conditions that exclude contact with atmospheric moisture. The resulting mixture is incubated<br>
for 1.5 hours at 40 °C, then poured into ice water, titrated to pH 2.5 with trifluoroacetic acid,<br>
and then extracted with 2 x 50 ml aliquots of dichloromethane. The organic layer is separated<br>
and dried with anhydrous MgSO4. The solvent is then evaporated at below-atmospheric<br>
pressure. The result is about 4.8 grams of N-TFA-carminomycin with purity of about 65-80%<br>
(this is confirmed by HPLC).<br>
[0020]      The N-TFA-carminomycin, obtained from the above synthesis, is then suspended in<br>
200 ml of distilled water at a temperature of 30 °C, and 15 ml of 1.0 N NaOH solution is<br>
added. The mixture is incubated for 30 minutes and then neutralized to pH 7 with a solution of<br>
hydrochloric acid and is then sent to preparative chromatography. After evaporation of eluate,<br>
3.0-3.8 grams of carminomycin is produced with a purity of about 96% (this is confirmed by<br>
HPLC).<br><br>
