				<td>AN IMPROVED PROCESS  FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF PYRIDINE-2-CARBOXALDE--HYDE<br>
More particularly this invention relates to a process for the preparation of pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde selectively from 2-pyridyl carbinol. The dehydrogenation of 2-pyridyl carbinol was carried out over modified and unmodified amorphous or crystalline silico-alumino phosphate catalysts. The silico-alumino phosphates, are mild and oxidation catalysts.<br>
Pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde is used in the preparation of pralidox-ime met;hiodide which is antidote for poisning by organophosphate acetylcholine sterase inhibitors. Pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde is also used in the production of bisacodyl a laxative. E.P.Papodopoulous et al in 1966 reported the synthesis of Pyridine -2 -carboxaldehyde from 2-pyridyl carbinol over manganese dioxide catalyst. In 1990 Subrahmanyam and Prasad also reported the synthesis of pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde over mixed oxide like V-Mo oxide catalyst, from 2-picolyl alcohol. In 1980|S.L.T.An-dersson and Jaras synthesised 2-pyridine carboxaldehyde from 2-picoline itself. The yield and selectivity of pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde is lower. The water in the feed is very large amount to avoid the side products like pyridine and coke in case of literature reports.<br>
The catalysts used in the present invention were the silico-alumino phosphates<br>
(SAPO)	and modified siiico-aiumino phosphate catalysts.  Different types of<br>
silico-alumino phosphates were used like SAPO-37, SAPO(TBA), SAPO(TripA) and SAPO(DPA). The bracketed letters indicate the template used for the synthesis of respective SAPO's The synthesis of these silico-alumino phosphate(s) has been reported in our copending patents, Indian Patent Appl. No. 963/Del/1995, 1459/Del/1995. The Organic templates used were tetrabutyl ammonium bromide (TBA), tetra propyl ammonium bromide (TPA), tripropyl amine (TriPA) and dipropyl amine (DPA) All these catalysts are synthesized hydrothermally.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the synthesis of pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde using modified silico-alumino phosphate catalysts.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for the synthesis of pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde which comprises: passing a liquid feed comprising of 2-picolyl alcohol and water in the ratio in the range of 1:5 to 1:30 in presence of air over a catalyst novel silico alurniniophous-plate at a temperature in the range of 250 to 420° C, recovering the product by conventional practional distillation methods.<br>
Feed containing 2-picolyl alcohol and water having weight hourly space velocity may be in the range of 0.25 to 1.0 h -1. The catalyst used may be such as SAPO-37, SAPO(TBA), SAPO(TPA), SAPO(TriPA) and SAPO(DPA)<br>
water) was fed from top using a syringe pump(BeBraun). The product was cooled using ice-cooled water and collected at the bottom. The air was passed through the calibrated manometer. The products were analysed by GC using SE-30 (30%) column. The analysis was confirmed by mass spectrometry and GC-mass. The mass balance was &gt;90%.<br>
The reaction of 2-picolylalcohol in the presence of water and air<br>
was carried out over various modified and unmodified silico-<br>
aluminophosphate catalysts. The reaction was carried out in the<br>
0 temperature range of 300-420 C with WHSV 0.25 to 1. The reactions<br>
were carried out after the removal of template.<br>
The yields of pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde were 69.1, 65.4 and 53.2<br>
wt% ove"r SAPO(DPA), SAPO(TriPA) and SAPO-37 catalysts respective-<br>
0	-1<br>
ly at &gt;95% conversion at 400 C reaction temperature and 0.5 h<br>
WHSV. Over HZSM-5(Si/Al=30) and V-Ti-ZSM-5, 2.2% pyridine-2-<br>
carboxaldehyde was obtained and the major products were pyridine<br>
and 2-picoline. The dealkylation of picolylalcohol leads to<br>
pyridine and the acidic centres are responsible for the process.<br>
To enhance the selectivity of pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde, the<br>
amorphous silico-aluminophosphate(DPA) catalyst was further<br>
promoted by potassium (5 wt%) and antimony (1 wt%) to reduce the<br>
acidic centres. The yield of pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde was 81.9<br>
wt% at 98.0 wt% conversion of 2-pyridyl carbinol over Sb-K-<br>
0 SAPO(DPA) at 380 C.<br>
The reaction of 2-picolylalcohol was carried out over amorphous<br>
MSAPO catalysts. The yields of pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde were<br>
31.4, 65.9, 38.6 and 68.4 % over amorphous VSAPO-37, MnSAPO-37<br>
0 CoSAPO-37 and NiSAPO-37 at 380  C. The variation in the activity<br>
is due to the transition cations.<br>
The effect of water dilution on the dehydrogenation of picolylal-cohol over amorphous SAPO(TriPA) has been studied. The yield of pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde decreased with the increase of dilution of the feed. On the other hand the formation of pyridine increases. The effect of reaction temperature on the dehydrogenation of<br>
2-picolylalcohol is also studied. The yield of pyridine-2-carbox-<br>
0 aldehyde in the temperature range of 350-400 C was 63.0 to 69.1 %<br>
over amorphous SAPO(TriPA) catalyst. Over vanadium (&gt;15%) modified catalysts, the formation of other side products like carbox-<br>
2 ylic acid and CO were observed due to strong oxidising nature of<br>
the active centre. In our studies we have not observed &gt;2% car-<br>
2 boxylic acids, CO etc. As proposed in the literature, the redox<br>
system like vanadium is the active centre for the dehydrogena-<br>
5+     4 +<br>
tion. In case of V  	V  system, the oxidation states are<br>
stable and with the various coordination states, for the formation of oxo and peroxo species.<br>
Thus an improved process for the preparation of pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde by the dehydrogenation of 2-picolylalcohol has been carried out over crystalline and amorphous modified silico-aluminophosphate catalysts with high yield and selectivity.<br>
