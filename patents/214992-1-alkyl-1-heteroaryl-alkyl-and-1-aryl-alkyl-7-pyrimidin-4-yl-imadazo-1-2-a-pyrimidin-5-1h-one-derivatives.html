4-YL)-IMIDAZO[1,2-a]PYRIMIDIN-5(1 H)-ONE DERIVATIVES<br>
SPECIFICATION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to compounds that are useful as an active<br>
ingredient of a medicament for preventive and/or therapeutic treatment of<br>
neurodegenerative diseases caused by abnormal activity of GSK3ß.<br>
Background Art<br>
GSK3ß (glycogen synthase kinase 3ß) is a proline directed serine,<br>
threonine kinase that plays an important role in the control of metabolism,<br>
differentiation and survival. It was initially identified as an enzyme able to<br>
phosphorylate and hence inhibit glycogen synthase. It was later recognised that<br>
GSK3P was identical to tau protein kinase 1 (TPK1), an enzyme that<br>
phosphorylates tau protein in epitopes that are also found to be<br>
hyperphosphorylated in Alzheimer"s disease and in several taupathies.<br>
Interestingly, protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation of GSK3ß results in a loss of<br>
its kinase activity, and it has been hypothesised that this inhibition may mediate<br>
some of the effects of neurotrophic factors. Moreover, phosphorylation by GSK3ß<br>
of ß-catenin, a protein involved in cell survival, results in its degradation by an<br>
ubiquitinilation dependent proteasome pathway.<br>
Thus, it appears that inhibition of GSK3ß activity may result in neurotrophic<br>
activity. Indeed there is evidence that lithium, an uncompetitive inhibitor of GSK3ß,<br>
enhances neuritogenesis in some models and also increases neuronal survival,<br>
through the induction of survival factors such as Bcl-2 and the inhibition of the<br>
expression of proapoptotic factors such as P53 and Bax.<br>
Recent studies have demonstrated that ß-amyloid increases the GSK3ß activity<br>
and tau protein phosphorylation. Moreover, this hyperphosphorylation as well as<br>
the neurotoxic effects of ß-amyloid are blocked by lithium chloride and by a<br>
GSK3ß antisense mRNA. These observations strongly suggest that GSK3ß may<br>
be the link between the two major pathological processes in Alzheimer"s disease:<br>
abnormal APP (Amyloid Precursor Protein) processing and tau protein<br>
hyperphosphorylation.<br>
Although tau hyperphosphorylation results in a destabilisation of the neuronal<br>
cytoskeleton, the pathological consequences of abnormal GSK3ß activity are,<br>
most likely, not only due to a pathological phosphorylation of tau protein because,<br>
as mentioned above, an excessive activity of this kinase may affect survival<br>
through the modulation of the expression of apoptotic and antiapoptotic factors.<br>
Moreover, it has been shown that ß-amyloid-induced increase in GSK3ß activity<br>
results in the phosphorylation and, hence the inhibition of pyruvate<br>
dehydrogenase, a pivotal enzyme in energy production and acetylcholine<br>
synthesis.<br>
Altogether these experimental observations indicate that GSK3ß may find<br>
application in the treatment of the neuropathological consequences and the<br>
cognitive and attention deficits associated with Alzheimer"s disease, as well as<br>
other acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases. These include, in a non-<br>
limiting manner, Parkinson"s disease, tauopathies (e.g. frontotemporoparietal<br>
dementia, corticobasal degeneration, Pick"s disease, progressive supranuclear<br>
palsy) and other dementia including vascular dementia; acute stroke and others<br>
traumatic injuries; cerebrovascular accidents (e.g. age related macular<br>
degeneration); brain and spinal cord trauma; peripheral neuropathies;<br>
retinopathies and glaucoma.<br>
In addition GSK3ß may find application in the treatment of other diseases such as:<br>
Non-insulin dependent diabetes (such as diabetes type II ) and obesity; manic<br>
depressive illness; schizophrenia; alopecia; cancers such as breast cancer, non-<br>
small cell lung carcinoma, thyroid cancer, T or B-cell leukemia and several virus-<br>
induced tumors.<br>

As a further object, the present invention concerns also methods for preparing the<br>
imidazo[1,2-a}pyrimidone compounds represented by the aforementioned formula<br>
(I).<br>
These compounds can be prepared, for example, according to methods explained<br>
below.<br>
Preparation method<br>
Imida2o[1,2-a]pyrimidone compounds represented by the aforementioned<br>
formula (I) may be prepared according to scheme 1.<br>
(In the above scheme the definition of R1, R2, X and n are the same as<br>
those already described for compound of formula (1)).<br>
The 7-(pyrimidinyl)-imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-5(1H)-one derivative<br>
represented by the above formula (III), wherein R1 is as defined for compound of .<br>
formula (I), is allowed to react with a base such as sodium hydride, sodium<br>
carbonate or potassium carbonate in a solvent such as N,N-dimethylforrnamide,<br>
N-methylpyrrolidine, N,N-dimethylacetamide or chloroform at a suitable<br>
temperature ranging from 0 to 130°C under ordinary air, then with a compound of<br>
formula (II), wherein R2, X and n are as defined for compound of formula (I) and L<br>
represents a leaving group preferably bromide or mesyloxy group, is added to<br>
obtain the compound of the aforementioned formula (I).<br>
Compound of formula (H) are commercially available or may be<br>
synthesised according to well-known methods of one skilled in the art. The<br>
compound of formula (III) may be prepared according to the method defined in<br>
scheme 2.<br>
(In the above scheme the definition of R1 is the same as already<br>
described.)<br>
According to this method, the 3-ketoester of formula (V), wherein R represents an<br>
alkyl group such as for example a methyl or ethyl group, is allowed to react with a<br>
2-aminoimidazole of formula (IV). The reaction may be carried out in the presence<br>
of an ammonium salt such as ammonium acetate, in a alcoholic solvent such as<br>
methanol, ethanol and the like or without, at a suitable temperature ranging from<br>
25°-140°C under ordinary air.<br>
Compound of formula (IV) is commercially available, compound of<br>
formula (V) may be synthesised by analogy to the method described in patent<br>
DE2705582.<br>
For example compounds of formula (V), wherein R1 represent a pyrimidine ring.<br>
optionally substituted by a C1-4 alkyl group, C1-4 alkoxy group or a halogen atom,<br>
can be prepared by reacting a pyrimidinyl-4-carboxylic acid optionally substituted<br>
by a C1-4 alkyl group, C1-4 alkoxy group or an halogen, with a malonic acid<br>
monoester. The reaction can be carried out using methods we// known to one<br>
skilled in the art, such as for example in presence of a coupling agent such as<br>
1,1"-carbonylbis-1H-imidazole in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at a<br>
temperature ranging from 20 to 70°C.<br>
In the above reactions, protection or deprotection of a functional group<br>
may sometimes be necessary. A suitab/e protecting group Pg can he chosen<br>
depending on the type of the functional group, and a method described in the<br>
literature may be applied. Examples of protecting groups, of protection and<br>
deprotection methods are given for example in Protective groups in Organic<br>
Synthesis Greene et a}., 2nd Ed. (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York).<br>
The compounds of the present invention have inhibitory activity against GSK3ß.<br>
Accordingly, the compounds of the present invention are useful as an active<br>
ingredient for the preparation of a medicament, which enables preventive and/or<br>
therapeutic treatment of a disease caused by abnormal GSK3ß activity and more<br>
particularly of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer"s disease. In<br>
addition, the compounds of the present invention are also useful as an active<br>
ingredient for the preparation of a medicament for preventive and/or therapeutic<br>
treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson"s disease,<br>
tauopathtes (e.g. frontotemporoparietal dementia, corticobasal degeneration,<br>
Pick"s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy) and other dementia including<br>
vascular dementia; acute stroke and others traumatic injuries; cerebrovascular<br>
accidents (e.g. age related macular degeneration); brain and spinal cord trauma;<br>
peripheral neuropathies; retinopathies and glaucoma; and other diseases such as<br>
non-insulin dependent diabetes (such as diabetes type II) and obesity; manic<br>
depressive illness; schizophrenia; alopecia;-cancers such as breast cancer, non-<br>
small cell lung carcinoma, thyroid cancer, T or B-cell leukemia and several virus-<br>
induced tumors.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method for treating<br>
neurodegenerative diseases caused by abnormal activity of GSK3ß and of the<br>
aforementioned diseases which comprises administering to a mammalian<br>
organism in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of the formula (I).<br>
As the active ingredient of the medicament of the present invention, a<br>
substance may be used which is selected from the group consisting of the<br>
compound represented by the aforementioned formula (I) and pharmacologically<br>
acceptable salts thereof, and solvates thereof and hydrates thereof. The<br>
substance, per se, may be administered as the medicament of the present<br>
invention, however, it is desirable to administer the medicament in a form of a<br>
pharmaceutical composition which comprises the aforementioned substance as<br>
an active ingredient and one or more pharmaceutical additives. As the active<br>
ingredient of the medicament of the present invention, two or more of the<br>
aforementioned substances may be used in combination. The above<br>
pharmaceutical composition may be supplemented with an active ingredient of<br>
another medicament for the treatment of the above mentioned diseases. The type<br>
of pharmaceutical composition is not particularly limited, and the composition may<br>
be provided as any formulation for oral or parenteral administration. For example,<br>
the pharmaceutical composition may be formulated, for example, in the form of<br>
pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration such as granules, fine<br>
granules, powders, hard capsules, soft capsules, syrups, emulsions, suspensions,<br>
solutions and the like, or in the form of pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral<br>
administrations such as injections for intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous<br>
administration, drip infusions, transdermal preparations, transmucosal<br>
preparations, nasal drops, inhalants, suppositories and the like. Injections or drip<br>
infusions may be prepared as powdery preparations such as in the form of<br>
lyophilised preparations, and may be used by dissolving just before use in an<br>
appropriate aqueous medium such as physiological saline. Sustained-release<br>
preparations such as those coated with a polymer may be directly administered<br>
intracerebrally.<br>
Types of pharmaceutical additives used for the manufacture of the<br>
pharmaceutical composition, content ratios of the pharmaceutical additives<br>
relative to the active ingredient, and methods for preparing the pharmaceutical<br>
composition may be appropriately chosen by those skilled in the art. Inorganic or<br>
organic substances, or solid or liquid substances may be used as pharmaceutical<br>
additives. Generally, the pharmaceutical additives may be incorporated in a ratio<br>
ranging from 1% by weight to 90% by weight based on the weight of an active<br>
ingredient.<br>
Examples of excipients used for the preparation of solid pharmaceutical<br>
compositions include, for example, lactose, sucrose, starch, talc, cellulose,<br>
dextrin, kaolin, calcium carbonate and the like. For the preparation of liquid<br>
compositions for oral administration, a conventional inert diluent such as water or<br>
a vegetable oil may be used. The liquid composition may contain, in addition to<br>
the inert diluent, auxiliaries such as moistening agents, suspension aids,<br>
sweeteners, aromatics, colorants, and preservatives. The liquid composition may<br>
be filled in capsules made of an absorbable material such as gelatin. Examples of<br>
solvents or suspension mediums used for the preparation of compositions for<br>
parenteral administration, e.g. injections, suppositories, include water, propylene<br>
glycol, polyethylene glycol, benzyl alcohol, ethyl oleate, lecithin and the like.<br>
Examples of base materials used for suppositories include, for example, cacao<br>
butter, emulsified cacao butter, lauric lipid, witepsol.<br>
The dose and frequency of administration of the medicament of the<br>
present invention are not particularly limited, and they may be appropriately<br>
chosen depending on conditions such as a purpose of preventive and/or<br>
therapeutic treatment, a type of a disease, the body weight or age of a patient,<br>
severity of a disease and the like. Generally, a daily dose for oral administration<br>
to an adult may be 0.01 to 1,000 mg (the weight of an active ingredient), and the<br>
dose may be administered once a day or several times a day as divided portions,<br>
or once in several days. When the medicament is used as an injection,<br>
administrations may preferably be performed continuously or intermittently in a<br>
daily dose of 0.001 to 100 mg (the weight of an active ingredient) to an adult.<br>
