COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
SECTION 10<br>
TITLE:' Process of manufacturing a low porosity, ultra high density, cementitious composite'<br>
APPLICANTS: The ASSOCIATED CEMENT COMPANIES LIMITED, and Indian company having its registered address at .Cement House, 121, Maharshi Karve Road, Churchgate, Mumbai 400 020, Maharashtra, India.<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is performed:<br><br><br>
06-12-2004<br><br>
GRANTED <br>
This invention relates to " Process of manufacturing a low porosity, ultra high density, cementitious composite".<br>
More particularly this invention relates to process of manufacturing and laying a layer of ultra high density cementitious composite filled and spread over predressed pot holes and top asphalt / concrete / cobble stone surface layer coated with a layer of cationic or anionic emulsion covered by a layer of metallised polymer coated aggregates in herein after stated manner and cured in open air at ambient temperature for 4 hours to 1 day and extending up to 28 or more days to attain rock hard wear resistant top layer surface having herein below stated TABLE - 1 of product characteristics.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The porous microstructure of concrete is responsible for failure of concrete to achieve even 2-5% of yield strength of steel.  Many attempts have been made to reduce the porosity of concrete thereby enhancing its strength.  Dense packing is known to be an essential feature of ultra high strength of concrete material.  It has also been known that the influence of small percentage of reactive fine particles on the strength gain is very significant.  In an<br><br>
attempt to provide a theoretical basis, PC (Personal Comput¬er) based computer models have been developed which can be used to predict the dry packing behaviour of the components in cementitious systems.  The concept of efficient particle packing leading to elimination of voids and thereby giving a pNo of superior structural strength is theoretically estab¬lished.  The resultant product has high compressive and flexural strength, high fracture toughness and low perme¬ability.<br>
WEAR PROTECTION APPLICATIONS<br>
In transportation of heavy materials by transport vehicles on asphalt, concrete or cobble stone road surface is the main cause of erosive abrasion.  This wear results in frequent interruption of vehicular traffic by transport industry resulting in financial losses leading to the loss of competitiveness and heavy repairs and maintenance costs.<br>
A variety of materials have been tried and used for wear protection of road topped surface including alloy steel, metal filings and/or hard faced cage with welded rods.<br>
Use of ceramics is an alternative candidate for wear applications because of their high temperature strength and hardness, chemical inertness in severe corrosive and oxidiz¬ing atmosphere, and having high contact fatigue resistance<br><br>
and low inertia. The major disadvantage of ceramics is their brittleness.  The wear resistant ceramic materials used include oxides of ceramics, silicon carbide (SiC) based cer¬amics, metal composites, fused cast materials and ceramic filled polymers, elastomers or adhesives.<br>
Although a great deal of information exists on the wear resistance testing of ceramics by a variety of standard methods and means of interpreting results are yet to be established.  This stems from the fact that wear resistance is not a material property of ceramics but a system response or system dependent. It is not unusual for one class of materials to behave differently in different type of wear tests.  The factors generally affecting wear and abrasive-ness of road top layer include:<br>
1.	size, shape, density, hardness and velocity con¬centration, impact angle, load and corrosivity affect the wear factor;<br>
2.	nature of wear material in terms of fracture toughness, corrosion resistance, porosity, friction co¬efficient, grain size and hardness affecting the wear factor.<br>
The increase in the wear resistance capacity of "ACCMarg' composite is possible when mixed with the addition<br><br>
of various types of fibers.  Fiber reinforcement is one ofr,. the most cost effective ways of improving the strength and toughness of "ACCMarg' composite wherein the amount of strength increase depends on the type of fibre and the fibre cement matrix interaction.  There are various types of available fibres are :<br>
1.	Carbon fibres which are inert, medically stable than glass. These fibres are low in density but their strength;to density ratio is higher and possesses high electrical conductivity.  The tensile and flexural strength increases with addition of carbon fibres.  Increase of tensile strength is to the extent of 28% and flexural strength is 55 % •<br>
2.	Steel and stainless steel fibres mixed in a cement matrix provides a useful way for enhancing the tensile strength and tou9hness to brittle matrix.  Addition of stainless steel fibres to cement causes high densities, strength and lower porosity.<br>
3.	Addition of 3 volume percent of 'Kavelar' fiber to cement matrix increases modulus of rupture four fold over ordinary cement. As most of its strength is lost at temperature above 300 deg. C. its use needs to be limited to applications 
 <br>
"SELFIL" which looks like a white cotton fibre to cement matrix increases &gt;2 fold tensile strength and MOR increases 
5.   Addition of commercially available ^.;	y Fiber'<br>
when mixed with water attains unique property to expand along one plane like an accordion and its fibers get entan¬gled with each other and attain greater compression and tensile strength wherein an addition of small 1.5 % volume of said fibres to the cement matrix 'increases impact resist¬ance four times and compressive strength two times.<br>
Pot holes are usually formed in asphalt / concrete /cobble stone top layer by the piercing hydraulic jet impact of rain water digging into asphalt road top and enlarging the pot hole size and depth and also by the rolling of heavy transport vehicles which frequently interrupts the smooth flow of vehicular traffic and calls for expensive filling up of said pot holes and supervision by road inspectors.

STATEMENT OF INVENTION:<br>
According to this invention , a rapid setting, homogenous composition is prepared  and set to form a low porosity ultra high density cementitious composite.<br>
The process comprises amongst others of :<br>
a. Preparing an homogenous admixture by dry mixing the following:<br>
i) 10 to 60 % crushed inert or reactive aggregates containing alumina;<br>
ii) 10 - 80 % water soluble alitic and/or non alitic cement;<br>
iii) 5 - 50 % of one or more varieties of crushed, sieved, wet ground and pulverized silicious material as filler;<br>
iv) 10 - 60 % f organic and/ or inorganic fibers ;<br><br>
v)   5  -  40%  of  ultra  fine  metallic parti cles;<br>
vi)  optionally adding 0-5 % of pigment dye to give color to composite<br>
The above mixing may be done in a high intensive or planetary mixer for 4-5 minutes a<br>
b)	A moisture free homogenous mass is<br>
prepared by adding to admixture,<br>
while mixing is continued, water<br>
reducing aqueous solution of super<br>
plasticizers.The super plasticiser<br>
is added in two installments .<br>
First 75% is added, and mixed<br>
thoroughly and then the balance<br>
is added. The super plasticisers<br>
are capable of eliminating<br>
locking forces between admixture<br>
particles, so that a desired<br>
consistency is obtained , and the<br>
resultant is air dried to remove<br>
any residual moisture.<br>
c)	a light, fluid, uniform, plastic<br>
consistency homogenous composition<br>
is prepared by adding water to the<br>
homogenous mass . This homogenous<br>
composition is set by pouring it<br>
on predressed substrate and<br>
subsequently spread and leveled.<br><br>
The substrate may range from pot<br>
holes, old worn out asphalt, tar,<br>
cement, cobble stone or concrete<br>
roads and such other road surfaces<br>
that need to be repaired. The<br>
substrate is usually predressed<br>
with a cationic or anionic<br>
emulsion, and covered with a coat<br>
of 1 to 5 % metlised polymer coated<br>
aggregates such as Metal -I, to<br>
form a binder composition<br>
sandwiched between the base of the<br>
pothole and base of said predressed<br>
road top surface which is covered<br>
by the grout which is the<br>
homogeneous	composition.<br>
Optionally a skid resistant layer may be added over the composition that has been poured in to the substrate. The entirety is compacted to remove ai r pockets and to have a void ratio of less than 30 % . The same is cured at ambient temperature, by exposing to air to form a ultra high density, cementitious composite. The composite so formed has the characteristics, as set out in TABLE -1 as herein given:<br><br>
TABLE- 1<br><br>

b)	Hardness after 1 day :  ...	35-40 Mpa<br>
c)	Hardness  after 28 days :	&gt;80 -  90 Mpa<br>
d)	Flexural strength:	08 -  10 Mpa<br>
e)	Density:       		2100 Kg/m sq.<br>
          f)	Apparent porosity : 		• 000-0.02  %<br>
    g)	Abradibility index : . ...	010-030<br>
and wherein the sequential order of steps (a) to (f) for carrying out said process being alterable to suit end user convenience.<br>
According to one embodiment for filling up pot¬holes and resurfacing cement concrete road tops*anionic emulsion is used as binder instead of cationic emulsion.<br>
According to this invention the smooth layer of asphalt road top is rendered skid resistant by saturating powdered quartz into top layer of ~ACCMarg' composite before allowing it to get cured at ambient temp, in open air for 4 hours to 28 days depending on rock hard wear resistant surface desired for said top layer.<br>
According to still another embodiment for giving  ACCMarg smooth road top surface layer said composite is<br>
