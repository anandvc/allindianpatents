				<td>PROCESS AND DEVICE FOR MANUFACTURING A COMPOSITE STRAND<br>
The invention relates to a process and a device for manufacturing a<br>
composite strand formed by combining a multiplicity of continuous glass<br>
filaments with continuous high-shrinkage organic thermoplastic filaments.<br>
The manufacture of composite strands is disclosed especially in EP-A-0<br>
367 661 which describes a process employing a first installation comprising a<br>
bushing that contains molten glass, from which continuous glass filaments are<br>
drawn, and a second installation comprising a spinning head, supplied under<br>
pressure with an organic thermoplastic that delivers continuous filaments.<br>
The two types of filaments are assembled into at least one composite<br>
strand and during the assembly the filaments may be in the form of webs, or in<br>
web and strand form. In the composite strand, the glass filaments or strand are<br>
surrounded by thermoplastic filaments that protect the glass from rubbing on the<br>
solid surfaces with which the strand is in contact.<br>
Although the incorporation of thermoplastic filaments enables the<br>
abrasion resistance of the strand to be improved, it also introduces tensions in<br>
the strand due to a shrinkage phenomenon of said filaments, which causes<br>
waviness of the glass filaments. The presence of waviness is particularly visible<br>
when the composite strand is wound in the form of a bobbin as this is deformed<br>
over its entire periphery.<br>
The shrinkage phenomenon has several drawbacks : it requires resorting<br>
to thick spools for producing the bobbins so that they can withstand the<br>
shrinking exerted by the composite strand and it disrupts the unwinding of the<br>
strand from the bobbin due to the fact that it does not have the ideal geometric<br>
characteristics that are required for the desired application. Furthermore, such a<br>
strand is not advantageous for producing a fabric that can be used as a<br>
reinforcing material for large-size flat parts since, because of the waviness, the<br>
filaments are not perfectly aligned in the final composite. The reinforceability of<br>
the strands in a given direction is found to be reduced.<br>
To solve the problem of shrinkage of the thermoplastic filaments, various<br>
solutions have been proposed.<br>
In EP-A-0 505 275, a process for manufacturing a composite strand<br>
similar to that described previously in EP-A-0 367 661 is proposed, which plans<br><br>
to form the thermoplastic filaments using a spinning head that is normally used<br>
in the field of the synthetic fibre industry. In this way, it is possible to obtain a<br>
composite strand formed from one or more glass strands surrounded by organic<br>
filaments, which is independent of the configuration of the spinning head used<br>
for extruding the organic filaments.<br>
In EP-A-0 599 695, it is proposed to mingle the thermoplastic filaments<br>
with glass filaments at a speed during the commingling that is greater than the<br>
drawing speed of the glass filaments. The speed difference is determined so<br>
that the shrinkage phenomenon compensates for the excess initial length of the<br>
thermoplastic filaments relative to the glass filaments.<br>
In one embodiment, the thermoplastic filaments pass onto a variable<br>
speed drawing unit of the type comprising drums, which accentuates the excess<br>
length, which makes it possible to obtain a composite strand of which the glass<br>
filaments are linear and the thermoplastic filaments are wavy.<br>
In EP-A-0 616 055, a process for producing a glass/thermoplastic<br>
composite strand is also proposed, which consists in mingling a web of<br>
thermoplastic filaments with a bundle or a web of glass filaments, the<br>
thermoplastic filaments being, upstream of the point of convergence, heated to<br>
a temperature above their relaxation temperature, drawn then cooled. The<br>
composite strand obtained has no waviness and is stable over time.<br>
The direct manufacture of rovings, without passing through an<br>
intermediate step of unwinding the tape and winding the strand, is carried out<br>
continuously by drawing the composite strand under the bushing at a speed<br>
compatible with the drawing of the glass filaments. This already high speed (of<br>
the order of a few metres to about ten metres per second) is associated with a<br>
drawing speed of the thermoplastic filaments upstream of the convergence<br>
points that is even higher.<br>
The production of a composite strand without waviness under such<br>
conditions occurs via a precise synchronization of the relative speeds of the<br>
rotating elements of the drawing unit and by maintaining the initial difference<br>
between the drawing speeds of the glass filaments and the thermoplastic<br>
filaments.<br>
These conditions are limited to thermoplastic materials that undergo a<br>
limited shrinkage. When the shrinkage is larger, the drawing unit becomes<br><br>
inoperable due to the fact that its speed can no longer be increased so as to<br>
sufficiently increase the length of the thermoplastic filaments so that the<br>
composite strand does not have any waviness.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a process enabling the<br>
manufacture of a composite strand comprising commingled continuous high-<br>
shrinkage thermoplastic filaments and continuous glass filaments that does not<br>
have any waviness during its manufacture and that remains stable over time.<br>
This object is achieved via a process for manufacturing a composite<br>
strand formed by commingling continuous glass filaments mechanically drawn<br>
from the holes in a bushing filled with molten glass and continuous organic<br>
thermoplastic filaments emanating from a spinning head, said thermoplastic<br>
filaments being mingled in the form of a web with a bundle or a web of glass<br>
filaments, in which, before their commingling with the glass filaments, the<br>
thermoplastic filaments are drawn, heated then projected onto a moving support<br>
with a speed during their projection onto the support that is greater than the<br>
running speed of said support. The combined effect of the drawing and the<br>
projection of the heated thermoplastic filaments gives them a high level of<br>
crimping that consequently makes it possible to compensate for the shrinkage<br>
of the thermoplastic in the composite strand.<br>
Advantageously, the heating and protection of the thermoplastic<br>
filaments are carried out simultaneously.<br>
According to a first embodiment of the invention, the thermoplastic<br>
filaments are guided in the form of a web up to the glass filaments, also in the<br>
form of a web, and are combined with the latter at identical speeds between the<br>
coating roll and the point of gathering all the filaments into a composite strand.<br>
According to another embodiment, the thermoplastic filaments are<br>
projected onto the glass filaments deposited onto the moving support, in the<br>
running direction of said support. Thus a web formed by the entanglement of<br>
the crimped thermoplastic filaments with the linear glass filaments is obtained,<br>
this web consequently being assembled to form the composite strand.<br>
The process according to the invention makes it possible to obtain a<br>
composite strand without any waviness: the glass filaments that are<br>
incorporated into the composition of the composite strand are linear<br>
immediately after their assembly with the thermoplastic filaments, and they<br><br>
retain their linearity after the collection in the form of a package. In the end, the<br>
thermoplastic filaments in the composite strand may be linear or wavy<br>
depending on the level of crimping that has been conferred on them at the<br>
beginning.<br>
Thanks to the invention, it is possible to form bobbins under the normal<br>
conditions for producing glass strands, especially using spools of conventional<br>
thickness given the absence of shrinkage of the composite strand, these spools<br>
possibly being removed in order to obtain balls and reused if necessary. This<br>
has the advantage of being able to extract the composite strand according to<br>
the method of unwinding (from the outside) or unravelling (from the inside).<br>
Besides the fact that it makes it possible to obtain a composite strand<br>
without waviness using a high-shrinkage thermoplastic, the process according<br>
to the invention ensures a homogeneous distribution and a high commingling of<br>
the filaments within the composite strand.<br>
The invention also provides a device for carrying out this process.<br>
According to the invention, in order to enable the manufacture of a<br>
composite strand formed from continuous glass filaments and from continuous<br>
high-shrinkage thermoplastic filaments, this device comprises, on the one hand,<br>
an installation comprising at least one bushing supplied with molten glass, the<br>
lower face of which has a very large number of holes, this bushing being<br>
associated with a coating device, and on the other hand, an installation<br>
comprising at least one spinning head supplied under pressure with molten<br>
organic thermoplastic, the lower face of which is equipped with a very large<br>
number of holes, this spinning head being associated with a drawing unit of the<br>
type comprising drums, with a device for projecting thermoplastic filaments that<br>
is provided with heating means, with a drum-type moving support and with a<br>
means enabling the thermoplastic filaments to be mingled with the glass<br>
filaments, finally means common to the two installations enabling the assembly<br>
and winding of the composite strand.<br>
The drum drawing unit has at least two rolls operating at variable speeds,<br>
preferably ensuring an increasing linear speed of the thermoplastic filaments.<br>
When the drawing unit comprises more than two rolls, the latter advantageously<br>
operate in pairs. The drawing unit may be provided with heating means, for<br>
example electric or infrared heating means, preferably placed in the first drum<br><br>
encountered by the thermoplastic filaments with the objective of preheating<br>
them and thus promoting their drawing.<br>
Preferably, the means enabling the thermoplastic filaments to be<br>
projected onto the moving support is a device using the properties of fluids that<br>
may be liquids or gases, such as pulsed or compressed air. Advantageously, it<br>
is a Venturi system, the role of which is solely to project the thermoplastic<br>
filaments by giving them an adequate spatial distribution and orientation,<br>
without giving them any additional speed.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the heating<br>
means, especially electrical, are associated with the device ensuring the<br>
projection of the thermoplastic filaments. In this way, the heating of the<br>
thermoplastic filaments at a temperature close to their softening point is carried<br>
out homogeneously and rapidly, which makes it possible to obtain a satisfactory<br>
crimping state during the projection onto the moving support.<br>
The moving support may be made from a drum, the surface of which<br>
consists of perforations, comprising an element for separating the internal<br>
volume into at least two compartments, one connected to means enabling it to<br>
be maintained under vacuum, the other associated with means enabling it to be<br>
put under excess pressure. The size and placement of the compartments are<br>
chosen so as to maintain the thermoplastic filaments in their initial crimping<br>
state, in the form of a web at the surface of the drum situated above the first<br>
compartment, and to obtain the separation of the web when it passes above the<br>
second compartment.<br>
The means enabling the two types of filaments to be mingled may be<br>
constituted by a Venturi system as described previously that enables the<br>
thermoplastic filaments to be projected into a web or a bundle of glass<br>
filaments. Preferably, this system projects the thermoplastic filaments at an<br>
identical speed to the drawing speed of the glass filaments.<br>
The means ensuring the commingling of the filaments may also be<br>
constituted by the drum-moving support. In this case, the drum is used to<br>
support the web of glass filaments, which winds around it, and the crimped<br>
thermoplastic filaments in web form are mingled with the glass filaments along a<br>
generatrix of the drum.<br><br>
The devices described previously enable the production of composite<br>
strands, from precrimped high-shrinkage thermoplastic filaments and from glass<br>
filaments, which do not have any subsequent deformation, that is to say that<br>
remain stable over time.<br>
Such devices can be applied to any type of known glass, for example E-<br>
glass, R-glass, S-glass, AR-glass or C-glass, E-glass being preferred.<br>
In the same way, it is possible to use any thermoplastic capable of<br>
having a high shrinkage, for example a polymer belonging to the group of<br>
polyurethanes, polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and<br>
polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), and polyamides such as nylon-6, nylon-6,6,<br>
nylon-11 and nylon-12.<br>
Other details and advantageous features of the invention will become<br>
apparent on reading the description of the examples of devices for carrying out<br>
the invention described with reference to the appended figures that represent:<br>
Figure 1 : a schematic representation of an installation according to<br>
the invention; and<br>
Figure 2: a schematic representation of a second embodiment of<br>
the invention.<br>
Represented in Figure 1 is a schematic view of a complete installation<br>
according to the invention. It comprises a bushing 1 supplied with molten glass<br>
either via a hopper containing cold glass, for example in the form of beads that<br>
drop simply by gravity, or from the forehearth of a furnace that feeds glass<br>
directly to its top.<br>
Whatever the type of feed, the bushing 1 is usually made of a platinum-<br>
rhodium alloy and it is heated by resistance heating so as to remelt the glass or<br>
keep it at a high temperature. A multitude of streams of molten glass flow from<br>
the bushing 1, these streams are drawn in the form of a bundle 2 of filaments by<br>
a device, not shown, also allowing the bobbin 3 to be formed. Placed in the path<br>
of the bundle 2 is a coating roll 4, for example made of graphite, which deposits<br>
a size onto the glass filaments that is intended to prevent or limit the rubbing of<br>
the filaments on the members with which they come into contact. The size may<br>
be aqueous or anhydrous (that is to say comprising less than 5 % by weight of<br>
water) and contain compounds, or derivatives of these compounds, which are<br><br>
incorporated into the composition of the thermoplastic filaments 5 that will<br>
combine with the glass filaments to form the composite strand 6.<br>
Also represented schematically in Figure 1 is a spinning head 7 from<br>
which the thermoplastic filaments 5 are extruded. The spinning head 7 is<br>
supplied with a molten, high-shrinkage thermoplastic, for example coming from<br>
an extruder, not shown, supplied with granules which flows under pressure<br>
through a large number of holes positioned under the spinning head 7, to form<br>
the filaments 5 by drawing and cooling. Cooling of the filaments is carried out by<br>
forced convention, by means of a conditioning device 8 having a suitable shape<br>
for the spinning head 7 and that generates a laminar air flow perpendicular to<br>
the filaments. The cooling air has a flow rate, a temperature and a humidity that<br>
are kept constant. The filaments 5 then pass over a roll 9 that makes it possible<br>
to assemble them in the form of a web 10, on the one hand, and to deflect their<br>
path, on the other hand.<br>
After passing over the roll 9, the web 10 of thermoplastic filaments<br>
passes over a drawing unit 11 formed, for example, from rolls 12, 13 that may<br>
turn at the same speed or have different speeds so that the acceleration Is<br>
carried out in the run direction of the thermoplastic filaments. The drawing unit<br>
11 has the role of drawing the filaments 5 and of giving a set speed to the web<br>
10. It is possible to vary the rotational speed of rolls 12 and 13 so as to<br>
precisely adjust the projection speed of the thermoplastic filaments onto the<br>
drum 17. Rolls 12 and 13 may be associated, where appropriate, with a heating<br>
system, for example an electric heating system, which makes it possible to<br>
ensure a homogeneous and rapid preheating of the thermoplastic filaments by<br>
contact with the surface of the rolls. The drawing unit 11 may be formed from a<br>
higher number of rolls, preferably functioning in pairs, for example four or six<br>
rolls.<br>
The web 10 of thermoplastic filaments, optionally preheated, is then<br>
directed towards the deflecting roll 14, which may be heated and optionally be<br>
motor-driven, then it passes into a crimping device 15 formed, for example from<br>
a Venturi system 16 and a drum 17.<br>
The Venturi system 16 makes it possible to keep the thermoplastic<br>
filaments separate and to project them as a regular web of suitable size onto<br>
the drum 17. The Venturi system 16 operates by an injection of compressed air<br><br>
and imparts no additional speed to the web 10. This system is associated with a<br>
heating device (not shown), for example using a fluid such as hot air or steam,<br>
and has the role of bringing the thermoplastic filaments to a temperature close<br>
to the softening point of the thermoplastic in order to improve their crimpability.<br>
At the outlet of the Venturi system 16, the web 10 of thermoplastic<br>
filaments is projected onto the drum 17. The rotational speed of the drum 17 is<br>
lower than the speed of the web 10 during its projection so that the filaments<br>
crimp when they come into contact with the surface of said drum.<br>
The drum 17 is equipped with a central groove 18, having a width slightly<br>
less than that of the drum, which is pierced by multiple holes (not shown). It also<br>
comprises an element 19, that is coaxial and immobile relative to the drum,<br>
which is used to separate the interior of the drum into two compartments 20, 21.<br>
Compartment 20 is connected to a device, not shown, which enables it to be put<br>
under vacuum, for example a suction pump, and compartment 21 is connected<br>
to a device, not shown, enabling it to be put under an excess pressure, for<br>
example an air injection device.<br>
After its projection onto the drum 17, the web 10 of crimped filaments is<br>
held in the groove 18 level with the compartment 20 under vacuum and it is<br>
cooled, by simple contact with the perforated surface or via a fluid, for example<br>
water or a sizing composition sprayed onto the filaments. Next, the web 10 is<br>
separated from the surface of the drum 17 level with the compartment 21 under<br>
the effect of the pressurized air passing through the perforations.<br>
The web 10 then passes onto a deflecting roll 22, then into a Venturi<br>
device 23 that keeps the crimped thermoplastic filaments in individual form until<br>
they are mingled with the glass filaments of the web 24.<br>
Joining of the web 10 of thermoplastic filaments and the web 24 of glass<br>
filaments takes place between the coating roll 4 and the element 25 being used<br>
to assemble the filaments into a composite strand. During the commingling of<br>
the filaments, the thermoplastic filaments arrive with a speed equal to that of the<br>
glass filaments.<br>
A deflector 26 equipped with a notch keeps all the filaments in place, in<br>
particular along the edges, and helps to reduce the disturbance undergone by<br>
the web 24 of glass filaments at the moment when the web 10 of crimped<br>
thermoplastic filaments is projected onto it.<br><br>
The web 27 of intermingled crimped thermoplastic filaments and glass<br>
filaments then passes onto the device 25 that enables assembly of the filaments<br>
into a composite strand 6, which is immediately wound in the form of a bobbin 3<br>
thanks to a drawing device, not shown, that operates at a given linear speed<br>
kept constant to guarantee the desired linear density.<br>
This linear speed that enables the drawing of the glass filaments is in<br>
general equal to that imparted by the drum 17 to the web 10 of crimped<br>
thermoplastic filaments. Nevertheless, it is possible to mingle the thermoplastic<br>
filaments with the glass filaments at a speed, during their projection, which may<br>
be lower in order to given an extra tension to the thermoplastic filaments to<br>
improve the ability to keep them in web form until the point of commingling with<br>
the glass filaments. Under these conditions, the difference between the<br>
projection speed of the thermoplastic filaments and the drawing speed of the<br>
glass filaments does not exceed 10%.<br>
Figure 2 represents an installation according to a second embodiment of<br>
the invention. In this figure, the common devices and means bear the same<br>
numbers as in Figure 1.<br>
The bundle 2 of glass filaments flowing from the bushing is drawn by a<br>
device (not shown) that forms the bobbin 3. The bundle 2 passes over the<br>
coating roll 4 that deposits a size on the glass filaments and the web 24 formed<br>
is wound over the drum 17.<br>
The thermoplastic filaments 5 extruded from the spinning head 7, cooled<br>
by the conditioning device 8 are assembled into a web 10 level with the roll 9.<br>
The web 10 then passes onto the drawing unit 11 having rolls 12, 13 and is<br>
drawn under the same conditions as in Figure 1. After roll 13, the web 10 is<br>
directed towards the roll 14, that is optionally heated and/or motor-driven, and<br>
into the crimping device 15 formed from the Venturi system 16 and the drum 17.<br>
In the Venturi system, the thermoplastic filaments of the web 10 are kept<br>
in their individual state and are heated at a temperature close to the softening<br>
point in order to help to obtain a high level of crimping.<br>
The heated web 10 is projected onto the drum 17 that rotates at a lower<br>
speed than the projection speed of the filaments, which crimps them. Joining of<br>
the web 10 of crimped thermoplastic filaments and the web 24 of glass<br>
filaments is carried out along a generatrix of the drum 17. The projection of the<br><br>
web 10 takes place while the filaments of the web 24 are contained within the<br>
groove 18 of the drum 17 ; this way of proceeding avoids disturbing the web of<br>
glass filaments and thus makes it possible to reduce the risk of said filaments<br>
breaking.<br>
Immediately after their joining with the web 24, the crimped thermoplastic<br>
filaments intermingle with the glass filaments and are flattened to the bottom of<br>
the groove 18 level with the compartment 20 under vacuum. When the web of<br>
thermoplastic filaments and glass filaments wound up onto the drum 17 arrives<br>
level with the compartment 21 that is under the action of pressurized air, it is<br>
detached from the surface under the effect of the air pressure coming from the<br>
inside of said compartment.<br>
The web 27 passes onto the roll 22 and onto the device 25 for gathering<br>
the filaments into a composite strand 6, which is wound in the form of the<br>
bobbin 3. A second device 25 may be placed between the exit of the drum 17<br>
and the roll 22 in order to help to obtain a better assembly of the composite<br>
strand.<br>
The bobbins obtained using the process according to the invention are<br>
composed of a composite strand, of which the glass filaments are linear and the<br>
thermoplastic filaments are crimped (or wavy) in a way that is permanent and<br>
stable over time. The level of crimping or waviness of the thermoplastic<br>
filaments in the composite strand depends on the size of the crimping that was<br>
given to them during projection onto the moving support.<br>
Moreover, the distribution of the glass filaments and the thermoplastic<br>
filaments within the composite strand is homogeneous, which translates into<br>
good commingling of the filaments.<br>
It is possible to apply some modifications to the process and device that<br>
have just been described. Firstly, it is possible to use a size made up of several<br>
solutions, whether aqueous or not, comprising compounds that are capable of<br>
copolymerizing over a relatively short time when they are brought into contact<br>
with each other. In this case, the coating device comprises separate rolls, each<br>
of them depositing one of the sizing solutions on the glass filaments. It is also<br>
possible to anticipate a drying device that enables water to be removed from the<br>
glass filaments, or at least for the water content to be substantially reduced,<br>
before winding.<br><br>
It is also possible to combine the invention with the production of<br>
complex composite strands, that is to say composite strands comprising organic<br>
thermoplastics that have different shrinkages. For this, it is possible to form<br>
different types of filaments, for example from one or more spinning heads, and<br>
to project them, in individual form or after having been assembled, onto the<br>
glass filaments.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A composite strand was manufactured in the installation described in<br>
Figure 1 under the following conditions :<br>
-	thermoplastic filaments:<br>
■	thermoplastic: polyethylene terephthalate (PET);<br>
■	number of filaments: 1200 filaments ;<br>
■ linear density: 359 tex;<br>
■	flow rate of the device 8 : 500 m3/h ;<br><br>
■	speed of the drawing unit: 1500 m/min ; temperature of rolls 12<br>
and 13 : 240°C ; draw ratio in the melt phase: 1560;<br>
■	air temperature in the Venturi device 16 : 260°C;<br>
■	rotational speed of the drum 17 : 990 m/min; cooling by water-<br>
spraying ; and<br>
■	degree of crimping : 8% .<br>
The degree of crimping was measured according to the formula<br>
100 x (L-Lo)/Lo, in which Lo is the length of a crimped filament and<br>
L is the length of the same filament after a sufficient drawing to<br>
make it linear.<br>
-	glass filaments :<br>
■	number of filaments : 1600 ;<br>
-	composite strand:<br>
■	glass/thermoplastic weight ratio : 75/25;<br>
■	linear density: 1491 tex; and<br>
■	linear speed (winding): 1000 m/min.<br>
The bobbin 3 was dried in an oven at 118°C for 32 hours. The shrinkage<br>
of the thermoplastic filaments was around 6%. The geometry of the bobbin was<br>
not changed after drying.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
A composite strand was manufactured in the installation described in<br>
Figure 2 under the following conditions :<br>
-	thermoplastic filaments:<br>
■	thermoplastic: polyamide (PA);<br>
■	number of filaments : 1200 filaments ;<br>
■	linear density: 466 tex;<br>
■	flow rate of the device 8 :400 m3/h ;<br>
» speed of the drawing unit: 1800 m/min ; temperature of rolls 12<br>
and 13 : 180°C ; draw ratio in the melt phase : 3640 ;<br>
■	air temperature in the Venturi device 16 : 200°C ;<br>
■	rotational speed of the drum 17 : 1008 m/min ; cooling by water-<br>
spraying ; and<br>
■	degree of crimping : 10 %.<br>
The degree of crimping was measured according to the formula<br>
100 x (L-Lo)/Lo, in which Lo is the length of a crimped filament and<br>
L is the length of the same filament after a sufficient drawing to<br>
make it linear.<br>
-	glass filaments:<br>
■	number of filaments : 1600;<br>
-	composite strand:<br>
■	glass/thermoplastic weight ratio : 70/30;<br>
■	linear density: 1597 tex; and<br>
■	linear speed (winding): 1008 m/min.<br>
The bobbin 3 was dried in an oven at 118°C for 32 hours. The shrinkage<br>
of the thermoplastic filaments was around 7%. The geometry of the bobbin was<br>
not changed after drying.<br><br>
