A Biodegradable Microsphere Composition Suitable For The Controlled Release Of Glucose Controlling Peptide And Formulation Thereof<br>
APPLICANTS<br>
Name : DONG-A PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD<br>
Address : 252 Yongdu-dong, Dongdaemun-ku, Seoul 130-072, Republic of<br>
Korea<br>
Nationality : a Korean Company<br>
PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a biodegradable polymeric microsphere comprising a biodegradable polymer carrier with a glucose-regulating peptide encapsulated therein, capable of releasing the glucose-regulating peptide in a controlled manner, and a method for the preparation thereof.<br>
Background Art<br>
After being administered orally, most protein and peptide drugs lose their active structures in the acidic environment of the stomach or undergo enzymatic degradation. Also, they are adsorbed at very low rates through the gastric or intestinal mucosa. For these reasons, protein or peptide drugs usually take non-oral administration routes, that is, are usually administered by injection. The non-oral administration of protein or peptide drugs must be repeated because most non-orally administered protein or.peptide drugs show short naff fives and fow bioavailability in the body. In addition, their administration may be continued for a long time period, e.g., months, in many cases. In order to avoid these problems, active research into sustained-release dosage formulations has been conducted, resulting in the use of biodegradable polymeric carriers with protein or peptide drugs encapsulated therein, which can release the protein or peptide drugs therefrom as the biodegradation of the polymeric carriers progresses [Heller, J. et al., Controlled release of water-soluble macromolecules from bioerodible hydrogels, Biomaterials, 4, 262-266, 1983; Langer, R., New methods of drug delivery, Science, 249, 1527-1533, 1990; Langer, R., Chem. Eng. Commun., 6, 1-48, 1980; Langer, R. S. and Peppas, N. A., Biomaterials, 2, 201-214, 1981; Heller, J., CRC Crit. Rev. Ther. Drug Carrier Syst, 1(1), 39-90, 1984; Holland, S.J. Tighe, B. J. and Gould, P. L., J. Controlled Release, 155-180, 1986].<br>
Aliphatic polyesters, currently used as polymeric carriers for protein or peptide drugs, received FDA permission for the use thereof because their biocompatibility was recognized. They are widely used as carriers for drug delivery or sutures for operations. Concrete examples of aliphatic polyesters include poly-L-lactic acid, polyglycolic acid, poly-D-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid, poly-L-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid, poly-D,L-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid (hereinafter referred to as<br><br>
TLGA'), poly-caprolactone, poly-valerolactone, poly-hydroxy butyrate and poly-hydroxy valerate [Peppas, L. B., Int. J. Pharm., 116, 1-9, 1995].<br>
With the development of high-molecular weight peptides or proteins as novel therapeutics in recent years, various attempts have been made to release them from polymeric carriers in a controlled manner. The dosage forms comprising polyester microspheres with protein drugs encapsulated therein, however, suffer from the disadvantages of showing an initial burst effect, an uncontrolled release rate for a period of time due to various factors, or an incomplete release of the encapsulated drug.<br>
For example, model protein drugs, such as bovine serum albumin, lysozyme, etc. are released in large amounts in an initial stage, but show a final release of around 50% [Crotts, G. and Park, T.G., J. Control. Release, 44, 123-134, 1997; Leonard, N.B., Michael, L. H., Lee, M.M. J. Pharm. Sci., 84, 707-712]. As for microspheres using aliphatic polyester carriers with recombinant human growth hormone encapsulated therein, they initially release the drug in an amount of 30-50 %, but 40-60 % of the drug remains in the microspheres [Yan, C., et al., J. Control. Release, 32, 231-241, 1994; Kim, H.K. and Park, T.G., Biotechnol. Bioeng., 65, 659-667,1999].<br>
The initial burst release of the drug is attributed to the fact that proteinous drugs aggregated at or adsorbed to microsphere surfaces or holes are released through rapid diffusion in an initial stage.<br>
Proteinous drugs may be denatured by the interface between water and an organic solvent during the manufacture of microspheres, and thus form irreversible aggregates which lead to unstable release. In order to prevent the interface-induced denaturation of proteinous drugs, the use of surfactants (e.g., non-ionic type surfactant Tween, Pluronic F68, Brij 35, etc.) and stabilizers (e.g., mannitol, gelatin, trehalose, carboxymethylcellulose, etc.) or an organic solvent free of water in the preparation of microspheres has been reported [Gombotz, W.R., Healy, M., Brown, L.,U. S.PatentNo. 5019400].      /--<br>
In order to solve the problem of uncontrollable drug release rates for a period of time and the incomplete release of encapsulated drugs, many recent studies are associated with alternative methods of preparing microspheres for the sustained release of drugs, which include encapsulating a drug in a mixture of two or  more   polymers   with  different  degradation  rates   at  a  predetermined  ratio<br><br>
[Ravivarapu, H.B., Burton, K., Deluca, P.P., Eur J Pharm Biopharm 50(2) 263-270, 2000; Korean Patent Application No. 1998-0062142] or mixing two or more polymeric microspheres having (different degradation rates with respective drugs encapsulated therein at a predetermined ratio (U. S. Pat. No. 4897268), thereby controlling both the initial release and the continuous release of the drug or drugs from the microspheres. In the microspheres prepared by the conventional methods, however, the products degraded from the polymer with a high degradation rate, e.g., lactic acid and glycolic acid, decrease the pH value, which promotes the degradation of the polymer having a low degradation rate, resulting in a release rate quite different from the calculated means of the release rates of the drugs encapsulated in respective polymers. Further, the preparation of two Qr more microspheres for one dosage form is disadvantageous in terms of manufacturing processes and economy (Korean Patent Application No. 2000-0036178).<br>
As techniques tor preparing microspheres, pha.se separation (U. S. Pat. No. 4673595, Korean Pat. Application No. 2007-0031304), spray-drying (Korean Pat. Application No. 2003-0023130) and organic solvent evaporation (U. S. Pat. No. 4389330) are generally known. In a phase separation method, a methylene chloride solvent is used in combination with silicon oil, heptens and ethyl alcohol, but all of them have to be eliminated and thus are economically disadvantageous. As for the spray-drying method, it may incur the denaturation of a peptide or proteinous drug because it requires the spray-drying of the peptide or proteinous drug at a high temperature, such as 60°C or higher, along with an organic solvent. For these reasons, the organic solvent evaporation method is most widely applied to the preparation of peptide or proteinous drugs. One of the most technically important factors in this method is encapsulation efficiency (Korean Patent Application No. 2003-0081179).<br>
Therefore, there is the need for a preparation method of microspheres that shows neither an initial-burst effect nor incomplete release, allows the zero-order release of drugs, is simple and economically advantageous and ensures high encapsulation efficiency and high stability of the encapsulated drug.<br>
Glucose-regulating peptides belong to a group of peptides which have<br><br>
therapeutic potential for the treatment of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes mellitus or insulin-independent diabetes mellitus, obesity and lipid dysmetabolism (U. S. Pat. No. 6506724). Examples of glucose-regulating peptides include Exendin-3, Exendin-4 and homologs and agonists thereof, and glucagons, glucagons-Jike peptides (e.g;,. GLP-1, GLP-2) and homologs and agonists thereof (Korean Patent Application No. 2006-7015029).<br>
Exendin-4, isolated from the salivary secretions of the lizard Heloderma horridum or Heloderma suspectum, is a physiologically active peptide consisting of 39 amino acid residues. Exendin-4 functions to stimulate the secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta cells, reduce elevated glucagons secretion and induce a decrease of appetite, thereby being useful for the treatment of diabetes and obesity [Eng. J. et al. 1990; Raufman, J.P. 1992; Goeke, R. 1993; Thorens, B. 1993].<br>
For the effective prevention and treatment of diabetes mellitus, studies on microspheres for the sustained release of exendin-4 have been conducted (Korean Patent Application No. 2006-7023921). However, conventional methods are complicated and inefficient, as exemplified by the use and removal of many organic solvents in the phase separation method, peptide degradation attributable to the use of high energy in an .ultrasonic process-, and the use of many excipients including stabilizers such as sugar, and release enhancers (e.g., inorganic acids and inorganic salts).<br>
Disclosure Technical Problem<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide microspheres that show neither an initial burst effect nor incomplete release, allow the zero-order release of drugs irrespective of a stable release period of time, are simple and economically advantageous in the preparation thereof, and ensure high encapsulation efficiency and high stability of the encapsulated drug, and a method for the preparation thereof, which employs neither many organic solvents, high-energy treatment such as ultrasonication, nor release promoters, and are simple.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
In order to  accomplish the above object, the present invention provides biodegradable polymeric microspheres comprising a biodegradable polymer carrier<br><br>
with a glucose-regulating peptide encapsulated therein, capable of releasing the glucose-regulating peptide in a controlled manner.<br>
Also, the present invention provides a method for preparing the biodegradable polymeric microspheres.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
In addition to being simple and economically advantageous in the preparation thereof and ensuring high encapsulation efficiency and high stability of the encapsulated drug, the microspheres according to the present invention show the zero-order release of drugs, e.g., exendin-4 and thus allow the drugs to be steadily released in vitro and in vivo therefrom over three to four weeks, with neither initial burst effect nor incomplete release.<br>

Best Mode<br>
Below, a detailed description is given of the present invention.<br>
The present invention pertains to a biodegradable polymeric microsphere for the controlled release of a glucose-regulating peptide, comprising a biodegradable polymer carrier with the glucose-regulating peptide encapsulated therein.<br><br>
Examples of the glucose-regulating peptide suitable for use in the present invention include natural, recombinant or synthetic exendin-3, exendin-4 and homologs and agonists thereof, glucagon, glucagon-like peptides (e.g., GLP-1, GLP-2) and homologs and agonists thereof, with preference for synthetic exendin-3, exendin-4 and homologs and agonists thereof. Most preferable is synthetic exendin-4.<br>
- The content of the glucose-regulating peptide in the microsphere may vary depending on administration routes, dosages, and protein properties.<br>
Suitable for use as the biodegradable polymer carrier are biodegradable polyester polymers. While serving as a scaffold for the microsphere and containing a glucose-regulating peptide therein, biodegradable polyester polymers gradually degrade to thus release the glucose-regulating peptide. Examples of the biodegradable polyester polymer include poly-L-lactic acid, poly-glycolic acid, poly-D-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid, poly-L-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid, poly-D,L-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid, poly-caprolactone, poly-valerolactone, poly-hydroxy butyrate and poly-hydroxy valerate, but are not limited thereto. As long as a biodegradable polyester polymer is usually used in the art, no particular limitations are imposed on the use thereof in the present invention. The polymer is preferably selected "from a group consisting of poly-L-lactic acid, poly-D-Iactic acid-co-glycolic acid, poly-L-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid, poly-D,L-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid (PLGA), and a combination thereof. More preferable is poly-D,L-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid (PLGA), alone or in combination with poly-L-lactic acid.<br>
Also, the present invention pertains to a method for preparing the biodegradable polymeric microsphere for the controlled release of a glucose-regulating peptide.<br>
The method for the preparation of the biodegradable polymeric microsphere comprises:<br>
adding an organic solvent to a polymer to give a polymer solution (step 1): dispersing a glucose-regulating peptide in the polymer solution of step 1 to give a dispersion, followed by adding an alcohol or a mixture of an alcohol and an organic acid to the dispersion to give a drug-dispersed solution (step 2); and<br><br>
forming microspheres from the drug-dispersed solution of step 2 (step 3).<br>
A detailed description will be given of the method in a stepwise manner.<br>
First, step 1 is to yield a polymer solution.<br>
In step 1, a polymer is dissolved in an organic solvent. The polymer is biodegradable and can be used as a carrier. Preferable is a biodegradable polyester polymer. As long as the biodegradable polymer carrier has high solubility therein and it can be easily removed through evaporation, any volatile organic solvent may be used without particular limitation. In the present invention, the organic solvent acts not only as a solubilizer for dissolving the polymer, but also as a dispersant for uniformly dispersing the glucose-regulating peptide in the polymer solution.<br>
Examples of the organic solvent suitable for use in the present invention include methylene chloride, ethyl acetate, chloroform, acetone, dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, ethylacetate, methyfethyfketone, acetomtrife, and combinations thereof, with preference for methylene chloride, ethylacetate and chloroform and the greatest preference for methylene chloride.<br>
Next, step 2 is to yield a drug-dispersed solution.<br>
In step 2, a glucose-regulating peptide is dispersed in the polymer solution. The glucose-regulating peptide is as described above. Preferably, synthetic exendin-4 is added to obtain a drug dispersion. In the drug dispersion, the ratio of the glucose-regulating peptide to the polymer (w/w) is selected within a range sufficient to dissolve the glucose-regulating peptide.<br>
Then, alcohol alone or in combination with an organic acid is dissolved in the drug dispersion. The alcohol and the organic acid act as solubilizers capable of dissolving both the polymer and the glucose-regulating peptide. A stabilizer or a surfactant may be further added.<br>
In the method according to the present invention, it is very important to conduct the preparation of the drug dispersion in the order of adding an organic solvent to a polymer, adding a glucose-regulating peptide, and adding alcohol or a mixture of alcohol and organic acid. When the addition order is changed, that is, when the polymer is added with the organic solvent and alcohol or a mixture of alcohol and organic acid, followed by dissolving the glucose-regulating peptide, or<br><br>
when a solution of the glucose-regulating peptide in alcohol or a mixture of alcohol and organic acid is added to the polymer solution, the resulting microsphere shows an incomplete release pattern.<br>
Useful in the present invention are methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol and butyl alcohol, with methyl alcohol being preferred due to high solubility for the biodegradable polymeric carrier and the glucose-regulating peptide. The alcohol which is to dissolve the drug dispersion is preferably used in as small an amount as possible, but must be sufficient to dissolve the drug dispersion. The amount may be determined depending on the kind of alcohol. In the case of methyl alcohol, the ratio of the drug dispersion to alcohol (v/v) preferably ranges from 1:1 to 6:1, and more preferably from 3:1 to 4:1 in order to completely dissolve the drug dispersion.<br>
Also, as long as it can dissolve the polymeric carrier and the glucose-regulating peptide, any organic acid may be used without particular limitation. Examples of the organic solvent suitable for the present invention include oxalic acid, oxaloacetic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, butyric acid, palmitic acid, tartaric acid, ascorbic acid, uric acid, sulfonic acid, sulfim'c acid, formic acid, citric acid, isocitric acid, alpha-ketoglutaric acid, succinic acid and nucleic acids, with preference for acetic acid, formic acid and a combination thereof. Like the alcohol, the amount of the organic acid is determined depending on the kind thereof.<br>
No particular limitations are imposed on additives as long as they can dissolve the drug dispersion and ate soluble in a solvent for the drug dispersion. For example, polyethylene ' glycols (Solutol HS-15™, TPGS™, Gelucire™), oils (Labrafil™, Labrasol™, Medium Chain Triglyceride™), proteins (Lectin), surfactants (N-Methyl pyrrolidone, Polyvinyl pyrrolidone, Tween,™, Span™, Cremophor™, Poloxamer™, Brij™, SunSoft 818H™) and hydropropyl methylcellulose may be used. The concentration thereof in the solubilizer ranges from 0.01 to 15% (w/v) and preferably from 0.1 to 12.5% (w/v).<br>
Finally, step 3 is to form microspheres from the drug-dispersed solution of step 2.<br>
The formation of the microsphere may be achieved by dispersing the drug-dispersed solution in an aqueous solution containing an emulsifier or using a spray drier.<br><br>
When the drug-dispersed solution is dispersed in an aqueous solution containing an emulsifier, a stirrer and a homogenizer are used to form microspheres, which are then dried. The emulsifier useful in the present invention may be a lipophilic emulsifier dispersible in organic solvents or a hydrophilic emulsifier dispersible in aqueous solvents. Examples of the hydrophilic emulsifier include Tween, Triton, Brij, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and polyvinylalcohol, with preference for polyvinylalcohol. The organic solvent may or may not be saturated with the emulsifier. Methylene chloride, ethyl acetate or chloroform may be preferably used as the organic solvent, with the greatest preference for methylene chloride. The concentration of the emulsifier in aqueous solution ranges from 0.01 to 5.0% (w/v) and preferably from 0.5 to 2% (w/v).<br>
In this step, the drying may be implemented as freeze-drying or vacuum-drying. The resulting microspheres may be harvested through centrifugation upon freeze-drying or through a vacuum filter system upon vacuum-drying before final drying.<br>
The microspheres prepared according to the method are of an O/W type and range in mean size from 5 to 70 urn, and preferably from 10 to 30 urn, which is suitable for injection. The particle size can be set at various values by controlling the volume ratio of the oil phase, that is, the drug-dispersed solution, to the water phase in which the emulsifier is dissolved.<br>
In the case of spray-drying, microspheres can be prepared simply by spraying the drug-dispersed solution from a spray-drier. In the interests of preparation efficiency, the spray-drier is set at 115~125°C for the influx and at 80~90°C for the efflux. Thereafter, the spray-dried microspheres may be allowed to undergo an additional drying process, such as freeze-drying or vacuum-drying, to remove residual solvents therefrom.<br>
Further, the biodegradable polymeric microsphere according to the present invention may be prepared by a method comprising:<br>
adding an organic solvent to a polymer to give a polymer solution (step 1): emulsifying the polymer solution of step 1 with an aqueous glucose-regulating peptide solution containing a surfactant to give a primary emulsion (step 2'); and<br>
forming microspheres from the primary emulsion of step 2' (step 3').<br><br>
In step 1, a polymer is dissolved in an organic solvent. The polymer is biodegradable and can be used as a carrier. Preferable is a biodegradable polyester polymer. As long as it has high solubility for the biodegradable polymer carrier and can be easily removed through evaporation, any volatile organic solvent may be used without particular limitation. In the present invention, the organic solvent acts not only as a solubilizer for dissolving the polymer, but also as a dispersant for uniformly dispersing the glucose-regulating peptide in the polymer solution.<br>
Examples of the organic solvent suitable for use in the present invention include methylene chloride, ethyl acetate, chloroform, acetone, dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, ethylacetate, methylethylketone, acetonitrile, and combinations thereof, with preference for methylene chloride, ethylacetate and chloroform and most preference for methylene chloride.<br>
In step 2', an aqueous glucose-regulating peptide solution containing a surfactant is added to the polymer solution, followed by emulsification with a stirrer or a homogenizer to give a primary emulsion. Synthetic exendin-4 may be preferably employed as a glucose-regulating peptide. The addition of the aqueous glucose-regulating peptide solution containing a surfactant to the polymer solution results in the formation of W/O/W type double emulsion microspheres.<br>
In step 2', any surfactant may be contained in the aqueous glucose-regulating peptide solution as long as it can dissolve the glucose-regulating peptide in the aqueous solution. Examples of the surfactant available in the present invention include Tween, Triton, Brij, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and polyvinylalcohol.<br>
The formation ofmicro spheres-may be achieved by dispersing the primary emulsion of step 2' in an aqueous solution containing an emulsifier, stirring with a stirrer and a homogenizer, and drying. The emulsifier useful in the present invention may be a lipophilic emulsifier dispersible in organic solvents or a hydrophilic emulsifier dispersible in aqueous solvents. Examples of the hydrophilic emulsifier include Tween, Triton, Brij, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and polyvinylalcohol, with preference for polyvinylalcohol. An emulsifier, whether saturated in the organic solvent or not, may be used. Methylene chloride, ethyl acetate or chloroform may be preferably used as the organic solvent, with greatest preference for methylene chloride. The concentration of the emulsifier in aqueous solution ranges from 0.01 to 5.0% (w/v), and preferably frornO.5 to 2% (w/v).<br><br>
In this step, the drying may resort to freeze-drying or vacuum-drying. The resulting microspheres may be harvested through centrifugation upon freeze-drying or through a vacuum filter system upon vacuum-drying before final drying.<br>
Enjoying the advantages of showing neither initial burst effect nor incomplete release, maintaining the zero-order Telease of exendin-4, ensuring high encapsulation efficiency due to the simple preparation method thereof and high stability for the encapsulated exendin-4, and steadily releasing exendin-4 therefrom in vitro and in vivo over three or more weeks, the microspheres prepared according to the present invention are useful as an agent for releasing exendin-4 in a controlled manner.<br>
Mode for Invention<br>
A better understanding of the present invention may be obtained through the following examples which are set forth to illustrate, but are not to be construed as the limit of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1: Preparation of Microspheres According to Kinds of Polymers and Mixture Ratios (O/W Emulsion)<br>
300 mg of a polymer (Boehringer Ingelheim) was completely dissolved in methylene chloride. In this polymer solution, 9 mg of exendin-4 (American Peptide) was dispersed to give an exendin-4 dispersion. The polymer that was used, as listed in Table 1, was one polymer product or a mixture of two different polymer products in various mixture ratios. To each of the drug dispersions which were different in polymer kind and mixture ratio, methyl alcohol was added in a predetermined amount (alcohol : drug dispersion 1:4 v/v) to give drug-dispersed solutions. 10 ml of each of the drug-dispersed solutions was emulsified with 250 ml of a methylene chloride-saturated polyvinylalcohol 1% aqueous solution (w/v) using a stirrer or a homogenizer to form microspheres.

The extracted exendin-4 was quantitatively analyzed to calculate the encapsulation efficiency, which is expressed as a percentage of the actual encapsulation amount to a theoretical encapsulation amount.<br>
Calculations are summarized in Table 5, below.<br>

EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLE 3: In Vitro Release of Drug from Microspheres<br>
In the following conditions, the microspheres prepared in Examples and<br>
Comparative Examples were evaluated for exendin-4 release in vitro.<br>
30 mg of the microspheres placed in a polystyrene vessel was dispersed in<br>
1.5 ml of PBS (phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4) containing Tween 20 in an<br>
amount of 0.02 % (v/v).   During incubation at 37°C, the dispersion was centrifuged<br><br>
according to the incubation time to precipitate the microspheres. The supernatant was analyzed for exendin-4 level to determine the amount of exendin-4 released from the microspheres. The precipitated microspheres were again dispersed in fresh PBS for subsequent analysis experiments. The release (%) of the exendin-4 from the microspheres is plotted against incubation time period in FIGS. 1 to 3.<br>
FIGS. 1 and 2 show the amounts of exendin-4 released in vitro over time from the microspheres prepared through an exendin dispersion process according to the present invention in Examples 1 and 4-8 while FIG. 3 shows the amounts of exendin-4 released in vitro over time from the microspheres prepared in Comparative Examples 1 and 2 when the exendin dispersion process was excluded.<br>
As is apparent from the plots of FIGS. 1 and 2, the microspheres prepared through the exendin dispersion process according to the present invention show neither initial burst release (exendin-4 released 3% during the first one day), nor incomplete release, with the maintenance of zero-order release over 21 days.<br>
In contrast, as seen in FIG. 3, the microspheres prepared without an exendin dispersion process showed incomplete release, with only 83% (Comparative Example 1) and 49% (Comparative Example 2) released over 21 days.<br>
Thus, the exendin 4 containing microspheres prepared in accordance with the present invention showed neither initial burst release nor incomplete release, but maintained zero-order release of exendin-4 over three weeks and therefore can be effectively used as agents for the sustained release of exendin-4.<br>
EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLE 4: Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of Microspheres<br>
In the following conditions, the microspheres prepared in Examples and Comparative Examples were evaluated for exendin-4 release in vivo and pharmacokinetic properties.<br>
A predetermined amount of the microspheres prepared in Examples 1 and 4-8 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2 (corresponding to 140 p.g of exendin-4) was suspended in an aqueous solution containing 1.5% CMC, 0.5% Tween 20 and 0.9% NaCl, followed by the subcutaneous injection of the suspension at a dosage of 0.2 ml into each of five Sprague-Dawley rats. Thereafter, blood was sampled from the rats at predetermined time intervals and quantitatively analyzed for exendin-4 level using ELISA to determine the release of exendin-4 from the microspheres. FIG. 4 shows the in vivo release pattern of exendin-4 from the microspheres prepared in<br><br>
Example 1-1.<br>
As is apparent from the release pattern of FIG. 4, the microspheres prepared according to the present invention show neither initial burst release nor incomplete release, but maintain zero-order release over 20 days in the experimental animals, as in the in vitro experiment.<br>
Also, the pharmacokinetic parameters, maximum blood concentration (Cmax) and AUCo.14d, were calculated from the measurements of the exendin-4 release using a WinNonlin program, and are summarized in Table 7, below.<br>

C. 1	0.94 ±0.17	5.34 ±0.61<br>
C. 2	0.85 ± 0.24	5.07 ±0.20<br>
As shown in Table 7, all of the microspheres of Examples 1-1 to 1-7, 4, 5-1 to 5-3, and 6 to 8 were calculated to be higher in Cmax and AUC values than those of Comparative Examples I and 2, indicating that the microspheres prepared according to the present invention are agents for the excellent controlled release of exendin-4.<br>
On the basis of the data of FIG. 4 and Table 7, consequently, the present<br><br>
invention provides biodegradable polymeric microspheres which are not only excellent in encapsulation efficiency, but also can steadily release exendin-4 for 2 to 4 weeks to completion without a lag phase.<br>

The resulting solution was diluted fivefold with ammonium bicarbonate, followed by conducting reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) to observe peaks and the retention time of exendin-4. The results are shown in FIG. 5. FIG. 5 is a chromatogram of exendin-4 obtained from the microspheres prepared in Example 1-1.
