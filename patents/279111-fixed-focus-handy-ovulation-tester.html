				<td>FIXED FOCUS HANDY OVULATION TESTER<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a portable microscope apparatus having fixed focus for<br>
the indicating woman's fertility period during her menstrual cycle. More particularly, the<br>
present invention relates to a fixed focus handy ovulation tester which obviates the<br>
procedure of manual focussing and renders improved image clarity, contrast and<br>
increased depth of focus. The fixed focus handy ovulation tester of the present invention<br>
effectively eliminates spurious images, which cause confusion in accurately ascertaining<br>
the results. Also, die reliability of die eyepiece over longer periods of usage is ensured<br>
because of its sealed construction.<br>
Background Md Prior Art Description:<br>
It has been clearly established that women's saliva during her menstrual cycles can be<br>
used to determine tiieir fertile period. Scientists have observed a clear difference in the<br>
cell pattern in saliva between fertile and sterile periods. More particularly, scientists have<br>
found that during a woman's fertile period, a sample of dried saliva forms vein-like<br>
structure or fern teaf Kke pattern. Contrary to the above, during sterile periods, the dried<br>
saliva sample typically forms a spotted or a dot Nke pattern.<br>
In order to administer self-examination, special optical devices such as microscopes or<br>
magnifying glasses are available in the market<br>
US Patents 4,815,835 and 5,267,087 which are incorporated herein as reference describe<br>
such handy ovulation tester devices. The handy ovulation testers prepared in accordance<br>
with the teachings of the aforesaid documents and those existing in the market have<br>
certain shortcomings such as the lack of clarity of the image. The clarity of the image<br>
apparent to the user is very much wanting at times, so the user often lacks some degree of<br>
confidence in her observation. In order to obviate such shortcomings, efforts have been<br>
made in the present invention to improve the clarity of image by certain built-in quality<br>
and optical design features, which are simple and do not change their form or cost<br>
materially.<br>
In erstwhile ovulation testers, the eyepiece needs to be focussed by screwing or pushing<br>
the eye piece lens part, which is usually called an outer part with respect to an inner part<br>
to see or magnify the object (biological specimen such as dried saliva) clearly. This<br>
approach of focussing is cumbersome from the point of view of users who will have to be<br>
made aware of this technique before use. This approach often causes some strain to the<br>
eye besides manual effort.<br>
Constructionally, the prior art devices comprise of inner and an outer telescopic tubes<br>
which are configured to move in and out with respect to each other. The eyepiece is<br>
incorporated at the top end of one of the telescopic tubes (preferably the inner tube) and<br>
the other telescopic tube (preferably the outer telescopic tube) is provided with a<br>
provision to accommodate a slide having die biological specimen thereupon. A light<br>
source is located opposite to the end having die eyepiece so as to illuminate the biological<br>
specimen. The light source can be a bulb or LED. The inner and the outer tubes are<br>
moved with respect to each other in order to achieve focusing on the slide having the<br>
biological specimen. Due to the telescopic construction of the tubes, the eye piece and the<br>
object (the biological specimen) are aligned in different planes for focus and hence the<br>
probability of error / unclear image increases for want of coaxiality in lens and surface of<br>
object<br>
In existing focusable devices, one tube containing lenses and the other one containing<br>
object surface are either pushed or turned against each other, thus creating the focussing<br>
effect However as the time passes, the areas that are pushed or rotated get worn out<br>
causing difficulty to accurately adjust the focus of the device. Also, it is observed that by<br>
the action of pushing or rotating the telescopic tubes, dust particles generated due to the<br>
rubbing action of the moving parts fall on the enclosed optical surface and onto the<br>
opposite surface of the glass plate wherein the biological specimen is applied. Settlement<br>
of these dust particles causes spurious shadows on the image and adversely affects the<br>
contrast and sometimes confuses the user.<br>
Further due to the two-piece construction, the inventors have very often observed that the<br>
moisture from the environment and even very fine dust particles enters into the eyepiece<br>
and hamper the quality of the image.<br>
Even when we look into manufacturing a set of telescopic tubes which are accurately coaxial<br>
and which do not have minimum gap between them, it can be a complex task. To<br>
avoid misalignment of the telescopic tubes, special materials are required to be provided<br>
between them.<br>
Further, looking into the cost of such a telescopic device, due to the complexity in the<br>
manufacturing process of these devices and the amount of special devices to be used for<br>
obtaining the alignment of the telescopic tubes, the cost of manufacturing is substantially<br>
high.<br>
Thus, there appears a necessity to develop an improved and handy portable microscope<br>
apparatus for viewing biological specimens such as saliva for the detection of woman's<br>
fertility period during her menstrual cycle, having fixed focus that overcomes the<br>
disadvantages discussed above.<br>
Objects of the Present Invention:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a portable microscope apparatus<br>
having fixed focus.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a fixed focus handy ovulation tester<br>
which obviates the disadvantages described above and especially obviates the procedure<br>
of manual focussing and renders improved image clarity, contrast and increased depth of<br>
focus.<br>

*<br>
and holding the outer case to the inner casing.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the fixed focus eye piece assembly<br>
comprises of a sealed housing (111) having a viewing slot (112) at a top end and<br>
incorporated with a single plano-convex rod lens (113), wherein the focus of the rod lens<br>
lies on a flat surface (114) of the same whereupon the biological specimen is applied.<br>
In one more embodiment of the present invention, the fixed focus eye piece assembly<br>
comprises of a glass holder assembly (33) integrated with a lens holder assembly (31),<br>
wherein the glass holder assembly and the lens holder assembly are maintained at a<br>
predetermined distance by a separating means (32).<br>
In one another embodiment of the present invention, the glass holder assembly is<br>
constituted as a sub assembly comprising of a housing (36) fitted with a Plano-convex<br>
field lens (37) having a curved surface and a flat surface, wherein the flat surface acts as<br>
an object surface where upon the biological specimen is located / applied.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, the thickness of the Piano convex field<br>
lens is equal to or greater than the radius of the lens such as a hyper hemispherical lens or<br>
a rod lens<br>
In a further more embodiment of the present invention, the Piano convex field lens is<br>
made of glass or is made of transparent plastic (37) glued using transparent optical<br>
cement to Piano-Piano glass plate (38X thereby compensating the adverse effect of plastic<br>
surface deviation / warping of flat glued surface and serving as a hard glass surface for<br>
application of biological specimen to enable repeated application and cleaning.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the glass holder assembly is constituted<br>
as a sub assembly comprising of a housing (36) fitted with a bi-convex lens (43) and a<br>
Plano-convex field lens (42), wherein the biconvex lens is placed above a curved surface<br>
of the field lens and the flat surface acts as an object surface where upon the biological<br>
specimen is located / applied.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the lens holder assembly is<br>
constituted as a sab assembly comprising a housing (34) fitted with a Piano convex eye<br>
lens (35).<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the eye lens is made of transparent<br>
plastic (35) and is glued using trans paient optical cement to Piano-Piano polished glass<br>
plate (38), serving to compensate for the adverse optical effect plastic surface deviation /<br>
warping and offering a hard exterior glass surface to enable cleaning.<br>
In one more another embodiment of the present invention, in the fixed focus eyepiece<br>
assembly the number of Air to glass surfaces is restricted to four, including the surface on<br>
which the biological specimen is smeared for observation.<br>
In one another embodiment of the present invention, the glass holder assembly (33), the<br>
lens holder assembly (31), and the separating means (32) are sealed to form the fixed<br>
focus eyepiece.<br>
in a further embodiment of the present invention, a metal sleeve (51) is further provided<br>
inside the inner casing.<br>
In a further more embodiment of the present invention, the controllable illuminating<br>
assembly comprises of a light source (52), an associated power supply means (53) and a<br>
switch means (54).<br>
system. When the diaphragm is 1.6 mm diameter, and the Eyepiece focal length is 4 mm;<br>
and the distance between the Eyepiece and the diaphragm is 20 mm, the size of the Exit<br>
Pupil will be around 0.4 mm.<br>
The contrast/clarity of the image is improved by using a thicker field lens (which reduces<br>
spherical aberration, since there is a larger length of denser medium in the path of<br>
convergent beam of light).<br>
The contract/clarity of image is improved by reducing the number of Glass-to-Air<br>
reflections, since only four Glass-to-Air surfaces are involved in the device of the present<br>
invention. In one of the simplest forms, according to a preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the number of Air-to-Glass or lens surfaces have been reduced to four<br>
which includes the focal plane surface of the field lens where the biological specimen i.e.<br>
the saliva is applied as shown in Figures 6 to 8. Some products in the market do have four<br>
Air-to-Glass surfaces, however, they consist of a double convex lens and a thin pianopiano<br>
glass plate for application of saliva. It has been noticed that these products have<br>
poor image quality because of large spherical aberration, and curvature of field inherent<br>
in such system of single lens. Besides the other side of thin piano-piano plate (for<br>
application of saliva) is quite close to the focal plane and hence, any condensation or<br>
settlement of dust on it impairs the clarity of the image. Also, it has been noticed that<br>
such devices are neither sealed nor have fixed focus.<br>
The saliva is smeared on the flat surface of the flat surface of the field lens. (According to<br>
the present invention, the eyepiece is adjusted and focused at the plane meant for<br>
smearing of saliva. That is, on to the outer Piano surface of the thicker Field lens. This<br>
reduces the number Glass-to-Air Surfaces to four), Figure 6,7,8.<br>
Confidence of the user is boosted by the optical construction of the present invention<br>
since her clarity of vision is not spoiled by spurious shadows due to condensation and<br>
dust on the other (curved) surface. The curved surface of the thicker Field Lens is at<br>
considerable distance from die focal plane (Plan) surface of the Field Lens, and therefore<br>
any dust or blemishes on the surface of the Field Lens are out of focus while viewing<br>
through the eyepiece as can be seen in Figures 6 to 8.<br>
To make the device economically viable and high quantity productive, the convex lenses<br>
have been replaced by transparent plastic materials instead of glass (refer to figure 8).<br>
Further<br>
a special transparent adhesive has been used to stick plastic lenses to piano-piano<br>
polished glass plates, eliminating aberrations occurring due to inherent quality of plastics<br>
to shrink on solidification.<br>
The eyepiece of the device is based on an optical system which has reduced spherical<br>
aberration, because of thicker field lens. The numerical data illustrating the reduction in<br>
the spherical aberration in the device is as follows:<br>
Equivalent Focal Length of the Eyepiece = 4.16 mm<br>
Magnification of the Eyepiece = 60.14X<br>
Radius I = Infinite (flat)<br>
Radius 2 = 3.89 mm<br>
Radius 3 = 3.89 mm<br>
Radius 4 = Infinite (flat)<br>
Center Thickness of Eyelcns =1.6 nun<br>
Air Gap Between Eyelens and Fieldlens = I nun<br>
Refractive Index of Glasses = 1.5<br>
For Relative Aperture of 02:<br>
Spherical Aberration = 0.217 mm when Center Thickness of Fieldlens = 1.6 mm<br>
Spherical Aberration = 0.176 mm when Center Thickness of Fieldlens = 5.17 mm<br>
It is intended to make the Center Thickness of the Fieldlens so large that its outer surface<br>
lies on the focus of the system (where the saliva can be smeared) as shown by ray path in<br>
Figures 6 to 8.<br>
In the device of the present invention the saliva is smeared on the flat surface of thicker<br>
Piano convex field lens which is of hemisphere or hyper hemisphere or rod lens form.<br>
The optical design of the eyepiece is so computed and adjusted that its focus is at the<br>
plane meant for the smearing of the saliva, i.e. on to the outer surface of the field lens.<br>
In the device of the present invention, the number of Glass (or refracting medium) to Air<br>
Surfaces has been reduced and so also the internal reflection by eliminating separate<br>
piano-piano glass plate for application of smear. Comparing with the existing devices, it<br>
can be seen that the device of the present invention provides a saving of 4% loss on each<br>
surface, i.e. amounting to 8% because of elimination of two surfaces.<br>
It is a well known scientific phenomena that when light passes from transparent lighter<br>
medium to transparent denser medium, or vice versa, a fraction of the light, nearly 4%,<br>
gets reflected, depending upon the difference in the refractive indexes between the two<br>
mediums. In order to reduce large portion of thus reflected light, the surfaces are usually<br>
given anti-reflection coatings wherever economics/quality requirements necessitate. It is<br>
desirable to reduce this reflected light from glass to air surfaces, which otherwise scatters<br>
itself onto the image, and dilutes the contrast of the object/image. The inventors in the<br>
present invention have therefore structured the optical system of the device (eyepiece) in<br>
such a way that the number of glass to air surfaces are reduced to minimum. That is, four<br>
only in this case, including the surface on which saliva is smeared, as apparent in Figures<br>
6-8.<br>
It can be clearly noticed from any one of figures 6 to 8 that the other surface of the<br>
smeared optical component is distant enough to be completely and very much out of<br>
focus of the eyepiece. The Applicants have specially sealed the interiors of the eyepiece<br>
to protect it from condensation and dust and is waterproof.<br>
To prolong the reliability of die device, the applicants have eliminated the focusing<br>
mechanism which is otherwise prone to wear and tear. The sealing of the eyepiece and<br>
elimination of the focusing mechanism increases confidence of the user in using the<br>
device of the present invention, Figures 4 (a) to (c) and 5 (a) to (f). The confidence in the<br>
device is reposed by offering consistent clarity of image.<br>
In erstwhile designs, while trying to focus and see the saliva patterns, the user sees infocus<br>
and out-focus images, which differ slightly. Thus the impression of the image<br>
varies, and the user's interpretations keep changing. There is no such change involved in<br>
the present invention, since it's a fixed focus design, and thus the impression of the user<br>
is always consistent.<br>
In the present invention, the applicants have masked the LED by a diaphragm of 1.6 mm<br>
diameter. This reduces diameter of the Exit Pupil, thereby increasing depth of focus. It<br>
also reduces stray light. Reducing the aperture in general, increases the depth of optical<br>
focus. This is a well known optical principle which is well known in its simplest form in<br>
a pin hole camera. The smaller the size of the pin hole, the longer the range of objects,<br>
from near to far, which can get imaged on its screen. In our invention, we have reduced<br>
the size of the Exit Pupil (which is the entrance pupil for the eye), and the screen is the<br>
retina of the user.<br>
Without deviating from the true sense of the present invention, the Applicants would like<br>
to emphasize that field lens can be made of glass, or it may be made of transparent<br>
plastic, and glued with transparent optical cement to piano piano glass blank, serving<br>
multiple purposes - viz., compensating the adverse optical effect of plastic surface<br>
deviations/ warping of flat/glued surface; and serving a hard glass surface for application<br>
of saliva smear to enable repeated application and cleaning as can be seen from Figures<br>
10 (a), (b) and (c).<br>
The eye lens can also be made of transparent plastic, and glued with transparent optical<br>
cement to piano-piano glass blank, serving to compensate for adverse optical effect<br>
plastic surface deviation/warping, and offering a hard exterior glass surface to enable<br>
necessary cleaning.<br>
It can be clearly noticed from Figmes 3 (a) to (c) that the self locating and holding rib<br>
provided at a substantially lower portion on the inner casing not only helps in<br>
conveniently glutting and holding roe outer case on to the inner casing but also provides a<br>
esthetic appeal to me inner casing.<br>
The outer case is provided with a outer case sleeve as can be seen from Figure 2 to avoid<br>
scratching the inner casing.<br>
For operating the device for testing the ovulation, the following four steps are performed<br>
as illustrated in Figure 11:<br>
Step 1: The outer casing is removed.<br>
Step 2: The fixed focus eyepiece assembly is carefully removed from the top end of the<br>
inner casing.<br>
Step 3: Smearing of saliva on the bottom inner portion of the fixed focus eyepiece<br>
assembly. The bottom inner portion of the fixed focus eyepiece assembly is made flat<br>
specifically for this purpose. The saliva is then allowed to dry for a few of minutes. After<br>
the saliva gets dried, the fixed focus eyepiece assembly is carefully placed on the top end<br>
of the inner casing.<br>
Step 4: Push the button provided at the bottom of the device and look through the top<br>
outer portion of the fixed focus eyepiece to see the image. In this final stage, no focusing<br>
is done. In fact, there is no provision for focussing provided in the device of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The advantages of the present invention is described here below:<br>
1. A Handy Ovulation Tester, which is fixed focus and does not need manual<br>
focusing.<br>
2. The optical system has enough depth of focus, and adjusted talcing care of dioptric<br>
variations of about plus/minus 4 diopters of the user's unaided eye.<br>
3. The eyepiece of the device is based on an optical system which has reduced<br>
spherical aberration, because of thicker field lens.<br>
4. The optical design of the eyepiece is so computed and adjusted that its focus is at<br>
the plane meant for the smearing of die saliva, i.e. on to the outer surface of the<br>
field lens.<br>
5. The number of Glass (or refracting medium) to Air Surfaces has been reduced and<br>
so also the internal reflection by eliminating separate piano-piano glass plate for<br>
application of smear.<br>
6. The other surface of the smeared optical component is distant enough to be<br>
completely and very much out of focus of the eyepiece.<br>
7. The interior of roc eyepiece is sealed to protect it from condensation and dust and<br>
is waterproof.<br>
8. The reliability/life of the device is prolonged by eliminating the focusing<br>
mechanism which is otherwise prone to wear and tear.<br>
9. Confidence in the device is reposed by offering consistent clarity of image.<br>
10. The LED is masked by a diaphragm of 1.6 mm diameter. This reduces diameter of<br>
the Exit Pupil, thereby increasing depth of focus. It also reduces stray light.<br>
<br>

WE CLAIM:<br>
1. A fixed focus handy and sealed ovulation tester for unaided eye, compatible for<br>
people with normal vision, as well as for those with long/short sighted vision up to<br>
Plus/minus 4 diopters. The said ovulation tester comprising:<br>
an inner casing (1) having a top and bottom end;<br>
a controllable illuminating assembly comprising a LED masked with a diaphragm,<br>
located near a bottom end of the inner casing, and being covered at the bottom by a<br>
bottom base plate (3), and<br>
a sealed fixed focused eyepiece assembly (4) being removeably located at the top end of<br>
inner casing, the said eyepiece assembly being used for magnified viewing of biological<br>
specimen, comprises of a bottom portion for receiving a biological specimen; and top<br>
portion for viewing the specimen,<br>
2. The fixed focus handy ovulation tester as claimed in claim 1, wherein the fixed<br>
focus sealed eye piece assembly comprises of a combination of piano convex eye lens on<br>
top and a substantially thicker plano-convex field lens at bottom, with their convex<br>
surfaces inwardly facing each other, and piano surfaces disposed outwards, the outward<br>
piano surface of field lens, which is construed and adjusted to be at the focus of the<br>
complete eye piece, is also used for application of biological specimen.<br>
3. The fixed focus handy ovulation tester as claimed in claim 1, wherein the<br>
illuminating source LED is masked by a diaphragm (55), the appropriate diameter of the<br>
diaphragm gives the necessary depth of focus to the eye piece to accommodate / make it<br>
compatible for people with normal vision, as well as those with long/short sighted<br>
vision up to plus/minus 4 diopters.<br>
4. The fixed focus handy ovulation tester as claimed in claim 2, wherein the<br>
piano convex field lens is made of glass or is made of transparent plastic (37) glued using<br>
transparent optical cement to piano-piano glass plate (38), thereby compensating the<br>
adverse effect of plastic surface deviation/warping of flat glued surface and serving as a<br>
hard glass surface for application of biological specimen to enable repeated application<br>
and cleaning.<br>
5. The fixed focus handy ovulation tester as claimed in claim 2, wherein the<br>
lens holder assembly is constituted as a sub assembly comprising a housing (34) fitted<br>
with a piano convex eye lens (35), wherein the eye lens is made of transparent plastic and<br>
is glued using transparent optical cement to piano-piano polished glass plate (38), serving<br>
to compensate for the adverse optical effect plastic surface deviation/warping and<br>
offering a hard exterior glass surface to enable repeated cleaning.<br>
6. The fixed focus handy ovulation tester as claimed in claim 2, wherein in the<br>
fixed focus eyepiece assembly, the total number of air to glass surfaces is restricted to<br>
four, including the surface on which the biological specimen is smeared for observation<br>
thereby eliminating the need to have a separate piano piano glass plate for application of<br>
smear.<br>
7. The fixed focus handy ovulation tester as claimed in claim 1, wherein the<br>
glass holder assembly (33), the lens holder assembly (31), and the separating means (32)<br>
are sealed to form the fixed focus eyepiece.<br>
