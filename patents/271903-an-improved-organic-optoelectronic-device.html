				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an improved organic optoelectronic device. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION/PRIOR ART<br>
Conventionally, solar cells and photodetectors have been fabricated using inorganic materials like silicon and gallium arsenide (GaAs) using processes that require high temperatures. They also produce toxic materials (by products) during fabrication and disposal which can have adverse effects on the environment in the long run. However, in the past few years organic solar cells have gained popularity ever since the development of a two layer organic photovoltaic cell by Tang1. Availability of inexpensive and varied raw materials accompanied by an easy and ecology friendly fabrication procedure and the ability to tune molecular properties has made organic photovoltaic devices an attractive proposition2 4. Moreover, organic solar cells can have a flexible structure and are environment friendly, thus giving them an edge over the conventional inorganic solar cells.<br>
A patent US20060071253 is known in the art related to a photoelectric conversion device comprising of at least two electrodes; and an organic photoelectric conversion film intervening between the said at least two electrodes; the organic photoelectric conversion film comprising a positive hole transporting material containing an arylidene compound having a specific structure, which is stated to be acidic.<br>
Another literature by Lai Bahadur et al 2004 semiconductor science and technology 19531-536 known in the art. This is directed to the photosensitizing behaviour of 2-imidazolin-5-one, which studied earlier at sprayed ZnO thin film electrodes has been reinvestigated at nanocrystalline ZnO thin film electrodes prepared by the sol-gel method. By using semiconductor electrodes in the form of nanocrystalline thin films, all PEC cell parameters such as dye-sensitized photo voltage, photocurrent and IPCE were found to be higher as compared to those obtained with the use of sprayed thin film electrodes. Thus, through this investigation it has clearly been demonstrated that the same dye can perform better on nanocrystalline than sprayed thin film electrodes of the same semiconducting material.<br>
The distinguishing features of the present invention as compared to US20060071253 are as follows:-<br>
1.	The present invention deals with the molecules having formula<br>
wherein Rl = R2 = any substituent such as alkyl, aromatic,<br>
heteroaromatic   and   halides,   and   R3   =   aryl  which   is   not<br>
described by the formulae I and II of the US Patent.<br>
2.	The  molecule of the  present invention contains only double<br>
bond which is different from that of the US document in which<br>
they have shown a molecule defined by the formula III (wherein<br>
R.sup.4,R.sup.5, R.sup.6 and n have the same meanings as in<br>
the general formula (II), and Z.sup.l represents an atomic group<br>
forming a 5- to 7 membered ring).<br>
3.	The absorption spectrum of the present invention also falls<br>
outside the range of 50 to 150 nm of the US document.<br>
4.	The molecule of the present invention is tuned to be basic and<br>
not acidic as claimed in the US document.<br>
The non patent literature "Improved performance of 2-imidazolin-5-one as sensitizer at nanocrystalline ZnO thin film electrode in acetonitrile solution" differs from the present invention in the following ways-<br>
1.	The   specific   molecule   used   in   this   technical   paper   is   2-<br>
imidazolin-5-one which is different from the present invention<br>
molecule i.e. imidazolin-5-one.<br>
2.	The technical paper has shown that the molecule is used as<br>
dye/dopant material showing photovoltaic parameters but the<br>
present invention is not a dye/dopant sensitized photovoltaic<br>
system.<br>
3.	The paper claims the use of the molecules as "Photosensitizer<br>
for its application in a photoelectrochemical cell" but in the<br>
present invention the molecule is used as an active layer in<br>
organic solar cells.<br>
4.	The  specific molecule used in this technical paper is 4-m-<br>
rnethoxy-p-hydroxybenzylidene 2-m-methoxy-p-hydroxy styryl-<br>
1-phenyl   2-imidazolin-5-one,   which   is   different   from   the<br>
molecule(s)   used   in   the   present   invention.   The   specific<br>
molecules     that    show    solar    cell    effect    are,     however,<br>
distinct/ different.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to provide an improved optoelectronic device which can be an organic solar cell or an organic photodetector or sensor which is environment and user friendly.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to use material that are biodegradable and hence there is no problem of non-degradable waste from used and abandoned solar cells polluting the environment. This is particularly important as we need large area solar cells to meet the growing energy demand of the common man.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved organic solar cell which is efficient compared to the present available organic solar cells and is easy to fabricate along with an improved organic photodetector which has high sensitivity.<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS;<br><br>
Fig. l(a) shows generic chemical structure of the imidazolin-5-one molecules wherein Ri, Ra and Ra can be modified as per requirements and can be any functional or chemical group like alkyl, aromatic, heteroarornatic, halides etc. such that the resulting molecule is basic or neutral in nature. In Fig. l(b) three specific examples of the molecules having the skeleton structure shown in Fig. l(a) are given.<br>
The molecules (Figure l(b)) are as follows:<br>
Molecule A:<br>
(4Z)-4-(4-Methoxybenzylidene)-2-((E)-4-methoxystyryl)-1 -phenyl-1,4-dihydro-5H-imidazolin-5-one.<br>
Molecule B:<br>
(4Z)-4-(4-N,N-Dimethylaminobenzylidene)-l-methyl-2-phenyl-5H-imidazolin-5-one.<br>
The above two molecules with solar cell effect can be used as a single layer in their respective devices. However, the active layer with bilayer or multilayer heterojunctions, as well as, bulk heterojunctions with these molecules and other molecules from the imidazolin-5-one family can also be formed. For example, bulk heterojunction active layer with molecule B above with molecule C shown below has been prepared.<br>
Molecule C:<br>
(4Z)-4-(4-Methoxyben2ylidene)-2-((E)-styryl)-l-phenyl-l,4-dihydro-5H-imidazolin-5-one..<br>
Reference may be made to fig. 2 (a) and (b) for device description. Devices are formed at the intersection of the anode (ITO in this case) and cathode (Ca/Al in this case) layers.<br>
The present invention provides an improved organic solar cell/organic photodetector comprising of an active layer intervening between two electrodes, which can be presented as follows:-<br>
Anode/PEDOT:PSS/Imidazolin-5»one (s) Active layer/Cathode.<br>
Anode represents a transparent/semitransparent conducting electrode such as Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) or a combination of ITO and PEDOT:PSS.<br>
Active layer corresponds to a single or bilayer or blend or tandem structure of one or more imidazolin-5-one molecules or a combination of imidazolin-5-one molecules with other known molecules such as Ceo fullerenes, PCBM, pentacene, CuPC, thiophenes or other organic/inorganic semiconductors. Cathode refers to metals like Al, Au, Al, Ag, Cr, or material combination of material layers such as Ca and Al, Mg and Al, Mn and Al, or LiF and Al or any other conducting/semiconducting material or its combination with the said metals/materials.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a photograph of the actual fabricated device whose characteristics are mentioned below.<br>
The complete device fabrication procedure has been explained in [5] for a typical single layer (active layer of a single imidazolin-5-one molecule) device with ITO/PEDOT:PSS as the anode and Ca/Al as the cathode.<br>
Different molecules belonging to this family were synthesized and tested for their potential application as photovoltaic materials. The molecular structure of some of these molecules is shown in Fig. l(b). Two examples of the obtained current density - voltage relations, depicting the photovoltaic behaviour, for single layer devices using Molecules A and B and one example for a bilayer structure using two of the molecules (Molecules B and C) are shown in Figures 4(a), (b) and (c) respectively. The characteristic in the fourth quadrant resembles generation of power from the device thereby indicating photovoltaic behaviour. Similarly the current density - voltage relations for sensor action are shown in Figures 5(a) and 5(b).<br>
Choices of other molecules to make heterojunction with imidazoline-5-one to form the active layer would be fullerenes such as Ceo or its derivatives or could be carbon nanotube or any other electron transporting material with low mobility of holes. Similarly those imidazolin-5-one molecules which have a high electron mobility will require hole transporting materials with low electron mobility like thiophenes or its derivatives, phthalocyanines or its derivatives etc.<br>
Imidazolin-5-one is the main chromophore which is responsible for the high fluorescence property of green fluorescent proteins (GFPs)6-7. This chromophore 4-(p-hydroxybenzylidene) imidazolin-5-one, is attached to the peptide backbone through 1 and 2 positions of the ring8. It is formed via a post translational internal cyclization of the Ser65-Tyr66-Gly67 tripeptide followed by 1,2-dehydrogenation of tyrosine. The substituents attached to imidazolin-5-one ring can be varied to alter the optical and electrical properties of the molecule that can thus be engineered for absorption in a desired frequency range. This ability to tune imidazolin-5-ones provides the designer with flexibility to alter the molecular properties as per requirement. In addition, the molecules score over other known materials for solar cell requirement because they are biodegradable and thus making them environment and user friendly.<br>
