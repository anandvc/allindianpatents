PCT/KR2005/001628<br><br>
Description <br>
OUTDOOR   UNIT   FOR   SPLIT   TYPE   AIR-CONDITIONER<br>
Technical   Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to an outdoor unit for a split type air-conditioner<br>
which can maximize cooling capability by efficiently increasing an ventilation amount, even though the large-sized outdoor unit is installed inside an opening space of an cuter wall of a building. <br>
              Background   Art<br>
[2]	In general, an air-conditioner is classified into a split type air-conditioner in which<br>
an indoor unit and an outdoor unit are split and individually installed in an inside space and an outside space, and a single type air-conditioner in which an indoor unit and an outdoor unit are combined into one device and installed through a window or wall. The indoor unit and the outdoor unit are increased in size due to high cooling or heating capacity, and scriais vibrations are generated in the outdoor unit due to the operation of a compressor of the outdoor unit. Accordingly, the split type air-conditioner has been more popularly used than the single type air-conditioner.<br>
[3]	The split type air-conditioner includes an indoor unit installed indoors, for<br>
exchanging heat between low temperature low pressure gas refrigerants and air, and supplying warm or cool air into the air-conditioned space, and an outdoor unit installed outdoors, for compressing, condensing and expanding the refrigerants to facilitate the heat exchange in the indoor unit. The indoor unit and the outdoor unit are coupled to each other through refrigerant tubes.<br>
[4]	Here, the indoor unit includes an indoor casing on which a suction hole and a<br>
discharge hole for sucking or discharging indoor air are formed, an evaporator installed inside the indoor casing, for exchanging heat between low temperature low pressure gas refrigerants and air, and an indoor fan and a motor installed at one side of the evaporator, for supplying indoor air to the evaporator so that cool air can be discharged to the indoor space.<br>
[5]	In addition, the outdoor unit includes an outdoor casing on which a suction hole and<br>
a discharge hole for sucking or discharging outdoor air are formed, a compressor installed inside the outdoor casing, for compressing the refrigerants from the evaporator into high temperature high pressure gas refrigerants, a condenser for condensing the refrigerants from the compressor into mesothermal high pressure liquid refrigerants by exchanging heat between the refrigerants and outdoor air, an expansion<br><br>
WO 2006/129891<br><br>
PCI7KR2005/001628<br><br><br>
means such as a capillary tube or electronic expansion valve for decompressing the refrigerants from the condenser into low temperature low pressure gas refrigerants, and an outdoor fan, a kind of axial fan, and a motor that are installed at one side of the condenser, for supplying the outdoor air to the condenser. The motor is a general single phase or three phase induction motor. In the induction motor, when an alternating current is applied to a stator installed inside a housing to rotate a shaft and a rotor at the middle portion of the stator, a rotary magnetic field is generated to rotate the rotor.<br>
[6]	Normally, the suction holes are formed on the three sides of the outdoor casing and<br>
the discharge hole is formed on the top surface thereof in order to improve ventilation efficiency. Therefore, when the outdoor fan is operated, air is sucked through the three sides of the outdoor casing, heat-exchanged, and discharged through the top surface thereof.<br>
[7]	Here, the compressor, the condenser, the expansion means and the evaporator arc<br>
coupled to each other through the refrigerant tubes, so that the refrigerants can be circulated to be sequentially compressed, condensed, expanded and evaporated.<br>
[8]	However, the conventional outdoor unit for the air-conditioner is restricted in in-<br>
stallation spaces due to high density and strict environment regulations of cities, and increases civil applications due to noise and heat. Especially, in a common residential area such as large-scaled apartment buildings, the outdoor units must be installed in indoor verandas to improve the appearance and reduce noises.<br>
[9]	Recently, a front suction/discharge type outdoor unit for a split type air-conditioner<br>
which sucks air through the front surface, exchanges heat, and discharges the heat-exchanged air through the front surface has been applied to a common residential area such as large-scaled apartment buildings.<br>
[10]<br>
Disclosure   of   Invention Technical   Problem<br>
[11]	Nevertheless, the front suction/discharge type outdoor unit for the split type air-<br>
conditioner has a smaller air suction area than the three-side suction/discharge type outdoor unit for the air-conditioner. As a result, a ventilation amount is reduced to deteriorate ventilation efficiency and cooling capability.<br>
[12]	In addition, the front suction/discharge type outdoor unit for the split type air-<br>
conditioner uses the general single phase or three phase induction motor to drive the<br><br>
WO 2006/129891<br><br>
PCT/KK2005/001628<br><br>
ventilation fan. The induction motor has low efficiency below 40 to 50%. Especially, since a stable torque area is narrow, a range of a RPM variable area is restricted. In case the RPM exceeds the stable torque area, noises are generated and efficiency is reduced.<br>
[13]	The present invention is achieved to solve the above problems. An object of the<br>
present invention is to provide an outdoor unit for a split type air-conditioner which can improve a ventilation amount and ventilation efficiency by using a fan having a relatively large ventilation amount, even though outdoor air is sucked or discharged to/ from a restricted space.<br>
[14]	Another object of the present invention is to provide an outdoor unit for a split type<br>
air-conditioner which can improve operational reliability and efficiency by using a stable high efficiency motor to drive a fan for sending outdoor air.<br>
[15]	Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an outdoor unit for a split<br>
type air-conditioner which is reduced in size by decreasing an installation space by improving an installation structure of a fan for sending outdoor air and a motor for driving the fan.<br>
[16]	Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an outdoor unit for a split<br>
type air-conditioner which has a realistic front suction/discharge type installation structure to be selectively built in an outer wall of a building.<br>

A bar-shaped separating member A2 for separating the upper casing 22 from the lower casing 12 is installed at the lower portion of the front surface of the upper casing 22. A front separating member A3 for separating the pair of fan housings 24 and 24' at both sides is installed inside the front surface of the upper casing 22.<br>
[73]	The lower connection member C2 is fixed to the bottom surface of the upper casing<br>
22 so that the fan housings 24 and 24' can be mounted thereon. After the ventilation unit 20 is mounted on the heat exchange unit 10, the ventilation unit 20 is screw-<br><br>

connected to the connection protrusions 12a and 12b of the heat exchange unit 10.<br>
[74]	Identically to the lower casing 12, a mesh-shaped front grill (not shown) can be ad-<br>
ditionally installed on the front surface of the upper casing 22 to prevent incoming of alien substances or invasion of animals (for example, rats).<br>
[75]	The sirocco fans 26 and 26' can be built in the fan housings 24 and 24'. A pair of<br>
suction holes 24   and 24'  are formed to face each other in the up/down axial<br>
in	in<br>
direction, and discharge holes 24   and 24'    are formed on the front surfaces of the fan<br>
out	out<br>
housings 24 and 24', so that the sirocco fans 26 and 26' can suck air in the axial directions and discharge the air in the circumferential directions. Guides R are inwardly protruded from each suction hole 24   and 24'  to guide the sucked air.<br>

[76]	The fan housings 24 and 24' are fixed in the upper casing 22 by brackets (not<br>
shown), to be positioned at. both sides of the front separating member A3 in the upper  casing .22. The lower suction hole 24   is linked to the bottom surface of the upper<br>
	in<br>

out<br>
[77]	Here, the fan housings 24 and 24' can be installed to guide the air sent by each<br>
sirocco fan 26 and 26' in the opposite directions or the same direction to prevent interferences. Although the fan housings 24 and 24' of one outdoor unit are installed to guide the air sent by each sirocco fan 26 and 26' in one direction, the fan housings 24 and 24' of the adjacent outdoor unit are installed to guide the air sent by each sirocco fan 26 and 26' in the opposite direction.<br>
[78]	Preferably, the rotary direction and the operation of the sirocco fans 26 and 26' built<br>
in the fan housings 24 and 24' are determined by the shape of the fan housings 24 and 24'.<br>
[79]	The sirocco fans 26 and 26' are axial fans for sucking the air in die axial directions<br>
and discharging the air in the circumferential directions. The sirocco fans 26 and 26' having a large air volume are suitable for the outdoor unit having high cooling capability.<br>
[80]	The sirocco fans 26 and 26' are built in the fan housings 24 and 24' in the up/down<br>
axial direction to face the suction holes 24   and 24'   of each fan housing 24 and 24'.<br>

out<br>
each fan housing 24 and 24'.<br>
[81]	As shown in Fig. 8, the motors 28 and 28' are preferably installed near the upper<br>
suction hole 24'   having a relatively small suction flux among the suction holes 24<br>

and 24'  of the fan housings 24 and 24'. To reduce the installation space, the motors 28<br>
in<br>
and 28' are partially positioned inside the suction holes 24   and 24'   of the fan<br>
in	in<br>
housings 24 and 24'.<br>
[82]	Especially, BLDC motors using not a brush but a manual circuit in converting an<br>
alternating current into a direct current are employed as the motors 28 and 28'. Since the BLDC motors do not have a carbon brush, the BLDC motors do not generate sparks in the operation, reduce possibility of gas explosion, are stably driven in most of revolution numbers, and maintain high efficiency of 70 to 80%.<br>
[83]	In detail, the BLDC motor 28 includes a motor rotation shaft 282 for transmitting<br>
power to the sirocco fan 26, a stator 284, a rotor 286 and permanent magnets 288 for driving the motor rotation shaft 282 by generating a rotary force by a mutual electromagnetic force, and a sensor (not shown) for controlling a supplied current by sensing the position of the rotor 286.<br>
[84]	In order to reduce a suction flowing resistance, the BLDC motor 28 is fixedly<br>
installed on the motor support member 30 near the upper suction hole 24   of the fan<br>
in<br>
housing 24 having a relatively small suction flux.<br>
[85]	The motor rotation shaft 282 is supported on the motor support member 30 by a ball<br>
bearing 289 to rotatably pass through the motor support member 30. The end of the motor rotation shaft 282 is connected to the axial center of the sirocco fan 26 by corking. The stator 284 is fixedly installed on the motor support member 30 with a predetermined gap from the outer circumference of the motor rotation shaft 282.<br>
[86]	The cuter diameter part of the rotor 286 is positioned on the outer circumference of<br>
the stator 284, and the inner diameter part thereof is fixedly installed on the motor rotation shaft 282. A plurality of ribs are formed long on the top or bottom surface of the rotor 286 in the radial direction to reinforce intensity in generation of a centriiugal force. The plurality of permanent magnets 288 are fixedly installed in the outer diameter part of the rotor 286 in the circumferential direction at predetermined intervals to generate the mutual electromagnetic force with the stator 284. The sensor is fixedly installed near the core of the stator 284.<br>
[87]	Accordingly, when the current is sequentially applied to the coil of the stator 284,<br>
the rotor 286 is rotated by the mutual electromagnetic force between the current of the coil and the permanent magnets 288. The rotary force of the rotor 286 rotatably drives the sirocco fan 26 by the motor rotation shaft 282.<br>
[88]	The motor support members 30 and 30' install the sirocco fans 26 and 26' and the<br>
BLDC motors 28 and 28' to hang in the fan housings 24 and 24', respectively. In detail,<br><br>
WO 2006/129891<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/001628<br><br>
as illustrated in Fig. 9, the motor support member 30 includes a cylindrical shaft support unit 302 for rotatably supporting the motor rotation shaft 282 by the ball bearing 289, a stator support unit 304 incorporated with the upper end of the shaft support unit 302, the stator 284 being fixedly mounted thereon, and a plurality of fixed units 306 proffuded from the circumference of the stator support unit 304 in the radial direction at predetermined intervals, and screw-fixed near the upper suction hole 24<br>
in<br>
of the fan housing 24.<br>
[89]	Here, the cylindrical shaft support unit 302 is shorter than the motor rotation shaft<br>
282. The ball bearing 289 is installed in the upper and lower ends of the shaft support unit 302, for rotatably supporting the motor rotation shaft 282. A plurality of grooves or holes 304a and a plurality of screw holes 304h are formed on the stator support unit 304, so that the stator 284 can be inserted and fixed by screws.<br>
[90]	Preferably, three fixed units: 306 are formed on the circumferences of the shaft<br>
support unit 302 and the stator support unit 304 of the motor, support member 30 at an interval of120( to distribute the supported load. More preferably, in order to reinforce intensity of the fixed units 306, a plurality of intensity reinforcing ribs 308 are formed among the shaft support unit 302, the stator support unit 304 and the fixed units 306 to support the lower portions of the stator support unit 304 and the fixed units 306, and a plurality of auxiliary intensity reinforcing ribs 309 are formed on the top surfaces of the fixed units 306.<br>
[91]	Especially, the fixed units 306 are protruded from the stator support unit 304 in the<br>
radial direction. The middle portions 306a of the fixed units 306 are upwardly inclined in the radial direction. The screw holes 306h are formed in the horizontal parts of the ends 306b of the fixed units 306. In the motor support member 30, the ends 306b of the fixed units 306 are screw-coupled near the upper suction hole 24    of the fan<br>
in<br>
housing 24.<br>
[92]	The assembly and installation process of the outdoor unit for the split type air-<br>
conditioner will now be described. The condensers 14, the compressors 16a, 16b and 16c and the expansion means are installed in the lower casing 12, and the control box for controlling the above components is installed at one side of the condensers 14, thereby forming the heat exchange unit 10.<br>
[93]	The pair of sirocco fans 26 and 26' and the BLDC motors 28 and 28' are fixed to the<br>
fan housings 24 and 24' by the motor support members 30 and 30', respectively, for composing a pair of ventilation devices. The ventilation devices are fixed in the upper casing 22, thereby forming the ventilation unit 20.<br><br>
WO 2006/129891<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/001628<br><br>
[94]	The assembly process of the ventilation unit 20 will now be explained in more<br>
detail. The motor rotation shaft 282 of the BLDC motor 28 is rotatably installed in the shaft support unit 302 of the motor support member 30 by the ball bearing 289, and the stator 284 is screw-fixed to the top surface of the stator support unit 304 of the motor support member 30, thereby forming a motor assembly. In the motor assembly, when the sirocco fan 26 is positioned in the fan housing 24, the motor rotation shaft 282 is connected to the axial center of the sirocco fan 26 by corking, and when the fixed units 306 of the motor support member 30 are mounted near the upper suction hole 24    of<br>
in<br>
the fan housing 24, the fixed units 306 are fixedly connected thereto by screws.<br>
[95]	Accordingly, the pair of ventilation devices including the BLDC motors 28 and 28'<br>
are positioned at both sides of the upper casing 22, and fixedly installed by brackets.<br>
The BLDC motors 28 and 28' are connected to the. control box by wires and controlled<br>
by the control box.<br>
[96]	The lower casing 12 and the upper casing 22 have their front surfaces opened. The<br>
•lower separating member Al and the upper separating member A2 are installed to<br>
separate the lower casing 12 and the upper casing 22.'Especially, the front separating<br>
member A3 is installed on the front surface of the upper casing 22 to separate the fan<br>
housings 24 and 24'.<br>
[97]	Here, die discharge holes 24   and 24'    formed on the front surfaces of the fan<br>
GUI	<br>
housings 24 and 24' are closely adhered to the front surface of the upper casing 22, for directly externally discharging the air from each fan housing 24 and 24'.<br>
[98]	The lower connection member CI is installed to cover the top surface of the lower<br>
casing 12, the upper connection member C2 is installed to be supported on the bottom surface of the upper casing 22, the upper casing 22 is mounted on the lower casing 12, and the assembly protrusions 12a and 12b of the lower casing 12 are screw-coupled to the upper casing 22. The top surface of the lower casing 12 and the bottom surface of the upper casing 22 are linked to each other.<br>
[99]	Therefore, the compressors 16a, 16b and 16c, the condensers 14 and the expansion<br>
means of the outdoor unit are connected to the evaporator of the indoor unit by the refrigerant tubes. The operation of the compressors 16a, 16b and 16c is controlled by load.<br>
[100]	The operation of the outdoor unit will now be explained in detail. The compressors<br>
16a, 16b and 16c are operated according to the signal of the control box generated by the load. The refrigerants are sucked to the indoor unit through the compressors 16a, 16b and 16c, the condensers 14 and the expansion means, and circulated along the<br><br>
WO 2006/129891<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/001628<br><br>
evaporator of the indoor unit. The refrigerants passing through the evaporator cool the air near the evaporator, thereby performing the cooling operation indoors.<br>
[101]	When the refrigerants are circulated in the condensers 14, the sirocco fans 26 and<br>
26' are driven by the BLDC motors 28 and 28', respectively. Therefore, the air sucked through the front surface of the lower casing 12 exchanges heat with the refrigerants through the condensers 14, and condenses the refrigerants. The heat-exchanged air is discharged from the front surface of the upper casing 22 through the sirocco fans 26 and 26'.<br>
[102]	In the BLDC motor 28, when the current is applied to the coil of the stator 284, the<br>
mutual electromagnetic force is generated between the stator 284 and the permanent magnets 288. The sensor senses the position of the stator 284, and sequentially applies the current to the coil of the stator 284, thereby continuously generating the mutual electromagnetic force between, the stator 284 and the permanent magnets 288. The rotor 286 to which the permanent magnets 288 are fixed and the motor rotation shaft 282 are rotated by the electromagnetic force at the same time, for transmitting the rotary force to the sirocco fan 26.<br>
[103]	Since the stable torque area of the BLDC motor 28 is wide, the BLDC motor 28 can<br>
be stably operated in various RPM, thereby restricting noises and reducing power consumption.<br>
[104]	The sirocco fans 26 and 26' rotated by the BLDC motors 28 and 28' suck air in the<br>
axial directions. The air passing through the condensers 14 is mostly sucked through the lower suction holes 24   and 24'  of the fan housings 24 and 24', partially sucked to<br>
in	in<br>
the upper suction holes 24   and 24'  of the fan housings 24 and 24', guided by the<br>
in	in<br>
glides R formed near the suction holes 24   and 24' , sucked in the axial directions of<br>
in	in<br>
the sirocco fans 26 and 26', discharged in the circumferential directions, guided by the fan housings 24 and 24', and discharged through the discharge holes 24     and 24'    of<br>
cut	oil<br>
the fan housings 24 and 24'.<br>
[105]	Here, the BLDC motors 28 and 28' are installed near the upper suction holes 24<br>
in<br>
and 24'  having a relatively small suction flux among the suction holes 24    and 24'   of<br>
in	in	in<br>
the fan housings 24 and 24', thereby minimizing the suction flowing resistance.<br>
Moreover, the BLDC motors 28 and 28' are stably efficiently driven to improve<br>
ventilation and heat exchange efficiency.<br>
[106]	Because the two sirocco fans 26 and 26' having a relatively large ventilation amount<br>
are installed by the BLDC motors 28 and 28', the ventilation amount can be efficiently controlled by load, and the maximum air volume can be increased. In addition, because<br><br>
WO 2006/129891<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/001628<br><br>
the two condensers 14 are stacked in the up/down direction and connected to each<br>
other, the condensation heat exchange can be facilitated to improve cooling capability<br>
of the whole refrigeration cycle.<br>

conditioner has been described on the basis of the preferred embodiment of the present invention and the accompanying drawings, it is understood that the present invention should not be limited to these preferred embodiments but various changes and modifications can be made by one skilled in the art within the spirit and scope of the present invention as hereinafter claimed.<br><br>
