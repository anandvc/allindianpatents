PROCESSES FOR PREPARING OPTICALLY ACTIVE (S OR R)-p-AMINO ACID AND OPTICALLY ACTIVE^ (R OR S)-p-AMINO ACID ESTER, AND P-AMINO ACID 2-ALKOXYETHYL ESTER AND OPTICALLY ACTIVE (S OR R)-p-AMINO ACID 2-ALKOXYETHYL ESTER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a process for obtaining an optically active (S or R) -p-amino acid and an optically active (R or S)-p-amino acid ester simultaneously from a p-amino acid ester (racemic mixture), and to a novel p-amino acid 2-alkoxyethyl ester and an optically active (S or R)-p-amino acid 2-alkoxy ester which are starting materials for the above process. These optically active p-amino acid and its ester are useful as a starting material or a synthetic intermediate of a medicine, agricultural chemical such as a physiologically active peptide, a lactam series antibiotics, etc., and a physiologically active substance (for example, see Patent literatures 1-3). BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Heretofore, as a process for preparing an optically active p-amino acid and its ester by an enantio-selective hydrolysis reaction using a biocatalyst, there has been disclosed a method in which, for example, only one of enantiomers of ethyl 3-amino-3-arylpropionate (racemic mixture) is selectively hydrolyzed in water in the presence of a lipase (trade name: Amano PS) originated from Burkholderia  cepacia   (Pseudomonas  cepacia)   to obtain an optically active (S)-3-amino-3-arylpropionic acid and an optically active (R)-ethyl 3-amino-3-arylpropionate (for example, see Non-patent literature 1.).<br>
[0003]<br>
However, according to this method, there are problems<br><br>
that an E value which is an index of selectivity between enantiomers is low, when an optically active carboxylic acid which is a product is water-soluble, it is difficult to recover 100% of the product from the aqueous solution after completion of the reaction, and yet, under the presence of a large amount of water, lowering in optical purity occurs due to self-hydrolysis reaction of the substrate. Incidentally, the E value is widely utilized as an index of selectivity of kinetic optical resolution (for example, see Non-patent literature 2.). [0004]<br>
Also, as a method for obtaining an optically active 3-amino-3-arylpropionic acid, it has been known a method to accomplish a good yield and good optical purity by making an ester portion propyl ester (for example, see Patent literature 4). [0005]<br>
However, according to this method, a large amount of water must be used so that there are problems that the operations for the reaction become complicated since it is essential to adjust pH of an aqueous phase, etc.  Incidentally, as a required optically active p-amino acid ester, a methyl ester or an ethyl ester thereof is desired in many cases, so that the resulting optically active p-amino acid propyl ester is required to be led to a desired methyl ester or ethyl ester by transesterification, etc., so that this is not an efficient method. [0006]<br>
Moreover, as a method for obtaining an optically active 3-amino-3-arylpropionic acid, it has been known a method which can realize high enantio-selectivity by carrying out enzymatic hydrolysis of 3-amino-3-arylpropion-ic acid ester (racemic compound) in two-phase system of water and an organic solvent (for example, see Patent literature 5). [0007]<br><br>
However, in this method, when an optically active carboxylic acid which is a product is water-soluble, it is difficult to recover the product with 100% from the aqueous solution after completion of the reaction. Also, there was a problem that in the presence of a large amount of water, lowering in optical purity was caused due to self-hydrolysis of the substrate. [0008]<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0009]<br>
An Object of the present invention is    to solve the above-mentioned problems, and to provide a process for preparing an optically active (S or R) -p-amino acid and an optically active (R or S)-p-amino acid ester simultaneously from p-amino acid ester (racemic mixture) by hydrolysis<br>
(reaction of p-amino acid ester (racemic mixture) and water) using an enzyme with a simple and easy method and with a high E value. MEANS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS<br>
[0010]<br>
Heretofore, a preparation of an optically active p-amino acid by enantio-selective hydrolysis of a p-amino<br><br>
acid ester (racemic mixture) is generally carried out by a method in which a large amount of water and a racemic mixture p-amino acid ester are reacted in the presence of a hydrolase in a solvent mainly comprising water. This is because in the hydrolysis of racemic mixture p-amino acid ester which is a substrate, it has been considered that the reaction proceeds rapidly as an amount of water is as much as possible. The present inventors have earnestly investigated to solve the problems mentioned above, and as a result, they have found a novel reactin system in which yield, selectiity, operability, etc. are improved as compared with the prior art technique, and superior as an industrial preparation process, in which self-hydrolysis which causes lowering in optical purity of a substrate (p-amino acid ester) which is easily hydrolyzed by water can be substantially completely inhibited, and an optically active p-amino acid which can be difficultly obtained solely due to water-solubility in general can be completely recovered by reacting water and a p-amino acid ester<br>
(racemic mixture) in the presence of a hydrolase in an organic solvent.<br>

The reaction of the present invention is carried out in the presence of a hydrolase in an organic solvent. During the reaction of the present invention, the hydrolase participates in the reaction by presenting a substantially suspended state in the reaction mixture, and there is no problem even when it is slightly dissolved in the mixture. Incidentally, the terms "in an organic solvent" in the present invention mean the state in which a reaction solvent to be used in the hydroloysis is an organic solvent, and a liquid portion dissolved in the organic solvent, except for the hydrolase (an immobilizing agent may be contained in some cases) and a precipitating product, etc., does not cause phase separation (that is, a state in which water (which may contain the below-mentioned inorganic said or organic salt), a substrate and an organic solvent constitute a single phase). [0052]<br>
As the water to be used in the reaction of the present invention, purified water such as deionized water, distilled water, etc., is generally used, and it is desired that an inorganic salt such as sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate, etc., or an organic salt such as sodium acetate, ammonium acetate, sodium citrate, etc., is added to water to present them in the reaction system.

Incidentally, during the reaction, the hydrolase is substantially in a suspended state, and while it may depend<br><br>
on a kind of Compound (II), Compound (II) sometimes precipitates as a solid as the reaction proceeds in some cases, but these suspended states or precipitation do not substantially affect on the reaction. [0059]<br>
Compound (II) and Compound (III) obtained by the reaction of the present invention can be isolated to obtain Compound (II) by, for example, when Compound (II) is precipitated after completion of the reaction, adding a suitable organic solvent (for example, acetonitrile, acetone, etc.) to the reaction mixture, if necessary, and filtering the mixture, and to obtain Compound (III) by concentrating the organic layer. Also, after completion of the reaction, when Compound (II) is not precipitated, Compound (II) can be obtained by, for example, adjusting a pH of the mixture, extracting Compound (II) with water, further re-adjusting a pH of the aqueous layer, extracting the same with an organic solvent, and concentrating the resulting organic layer, and Compound (III) can be obtained by concentrating the organic layer separated at the time of extracting Compound (II) with water.
