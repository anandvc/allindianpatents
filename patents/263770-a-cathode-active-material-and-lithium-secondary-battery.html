				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a high-power lithium secondary battery having a long-term service life and superior safety at both room temperature and high temperature, even after repeated high-current charge and discharge.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Technological development and increased demand for mobile equipment have led to a rapid increase in the demand for secondary batteries as an energy source. In recent years, applicability of secondary batteries has been realized as power sources for electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). In the light of such trends, a great deal of research and study has been focused on secondary batteries which are capable of meeting various demands. Among other things, there has been an increased demand for lithium secondary batteries having high-energy density, high-discharge voltage and power output stability.<br>
Particularly, lithium secondary batteries for use in EVs and the like require not only high-energy density and capability to exert large power output within a short period of time, but also a long-term service life of more than 10 years even under severe conditions in which high-current charge/discharge cycles are repeated within a short<br>
time, thus necessitating remarkably superior safety and long-term service life compared to conventional small-size lithium secondary batteries.<br>
Lithium ion batteries that have been used in conventional small-size batteries generally employ a layered structure of lithium cobalt composite oxide as a cathode material and a graphite-based material as an anode material. However, the main constitutional element of the lithium cobalt .composite oxide, cobalt, is very expensive and is not suitable for use in electric vehicles due to safety concerns. Therefore, as the cathode material of lithium ion batteries for EVs, a lithium manganese composite oxide having a spinel structure made up of manganese is ideal in terms of both cost and safety.<br>
However, the lithium manganese composite oxide, upon high-temperature and high-current charge/discharge, undergoes elution of manganese ions into an electrolyte due to the influence of the electrolyte, thus resulting in degradation of battery properties and performance. Thus, there is a need for measures to prevent such problems. In addition, the lithium manganese composite oxide has drawbacks such as a low capacity per unit weight, i.e., a low charge density, as compared to conventional lithium cobalt composite oxides or lithium nickel composite oxides. Thus, there is a limit to charge density of the battery and in order to enter practical use as the power source of EVs, designs of the battery to solve such disadvantages should be effected together.<br>
In order to alleviate the above-mentioned respective disadvantages, various studies and attempts to fabricate electrodes using a mixed cathode active material have been made. For example, Korean Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2003-0096214 assigned to Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. (Japan), and Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2003-092108 disclose techniques utilizing a mixture of lithium/manganese composite oxide, and lithium/nickel/cobalt/manganese composite<br>
oxide and/or lithium/nickel/manganese composite oxide to enhance recovery and power output characteristics. These arts, however, still suffer from problems associated with inferior life characteristics of the lithium manganese oxide and limited improvement of safety.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to solve the above problems, and other technical problems that have yet to be resolved.<br>
Specifically, an object of the present invention is to provide a cathode active material for a secondary battery which ensures superior safety and can have a long-term service life at both room temperature and high temperature, even after repeated high-current charge and discharge.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a lithium secondary battery comprising a cathode containing the above-mentioned cathode active material.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, the above and other objects can be accomplished by the provision of a cathode active material for a secondary battery, comprising a mixture of a lithium/manganese spinel oxide represented by Formula I below and a lithium/nickel/cobalt/manganese composite oxide represented by Formula II below, wherein at least one of two oxides has an average particle diameter of more than 15 µm:<br>
[Formula I]<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein,<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
[Formula II]<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein, <br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a lithium secondary battery comprising the above-mentioned cathode active material-containing cathode, an anode, a separator and an electrolyte.<br>
In order to improve the life characteristics of the battery, the present nvention uses an oxide having an average particle diameter of more than 15 µm as the cathode active material. This is because an increase in the particle size of the oxide leads to inhibition in decomposition of an electrolyte and reduction in dissolution of manganese into the electrolyte. However, the manufacturing process of the oxide suffers from limitations in increasing of the oxide particle size, and an excessively larger particle size of the oxide leads to deterioration of the battery efficiency versus the weight thereof. Therefore, the average particle diameter of the oxide is preferably in the range of 15 to 30 µm.<br>
As a preferred example of the oxide particle size, mention may be made of a case where the lithium/manganese spinel oxide of Formula I has an average particle diameter of more than 15 µm, and a case where the lithium/manganese spinel oxide of Formula I and the lithium/nickel/cobalt/manganese composite oxide of Formula II have an average particle diameter of more than 15 µm, respectively. That is, when the average particle diameter of the lithium/manganese spinel oxide is more than 15 µm or the average particle diameter of both oxides is more than 15 µm, life characteristics of the battery are further improved. These facts will be illustrated and confirmed in the following Examples and Comparative Examples hereinafter.<br>
As used herein, the average particle diameter of the oxide preferably refers to a particle diameter of the oxide when large numbers of particles gather into an aggregate. The cathode active materials, i.e., individual oxide units tend to aggregate depending upon set conditions of the manufacturing process, and the resulting aggregate per se exerts desirable characteristics of active materials. Therefore, the average particle diameter of the oxide preferably means a particle diameter of such an oxide aggregate.<br>
The particle diameter of the oxide unit may vary depending upon processes for preparation of the oxides. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment, the oxide unit of the lithium/manganese spinel oxide may have a particle diameter of 0.2 to 10 urn, upon taking into consideration various characteristics of the cathode active material and morphology of the aggregate.<br>
In addition, the particle diameter of the oxides has a close relationship with the surface area of the oxide. When the oxide unit has a surface area of 0.1 to 1.0 m2/g, it is possible to exert superior characteristics of the active material.<br>
The lithium/nickel/cobalt/manganese composite oxide is a lithium oxide which simultaneously contains nickel, manganese and cobalt elements, as shown in Formula II, and significantly improves, in combination with the lithium/manganese spinel oxide, the safety and life characteristics of the cathode active material according to the present invention. The lithium/nickel/cobalt/manganese composite oxide contains each of at least 0.2 M nickel and manganese, provided that it contains cobalt. Preferred examples of the lithium/nickel/cobalt/manganese composite oxide may include, but are not limited to, Li1+zNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 and Li1<br>
The mixing ratio of two composite oxides in the cathode active material of the present invention is preferably in the range of 90 : 10 to 10 : 90, more preferably in the range of 90 : 10 to 30 : 70 (w/w). If the content of the composite oxide (I) among two composite oxides is excessively low, the stability of the battery is lowered. Conversely, if the content of the composite oxide (II) is excessively low, it is undesirably difficult to achieve desired life characteristics. These facts "will also be illustrated and confirmed in the following Examples and Comparative Examples hereinafter.<br>
When the lithium/manganese spinel oxide of Formula I is a lithium/manganese spinel oxide of Formula III wherein a portion of manganese (Mn) is substituted with other metal elements, the life characteristics of the battery can be further improved.<br>
[Formula III]<br>
wherein,<br>
M is a metal having an oxidation number of 2 (Formula Removed)<br>
In the lithium/manganese spinel oxide of Formula III, manganese (Mn) is substituted with a metal (M) having an oxidation number of 2 or 3 within the predetermined range. Herein, the metal (M) may be preferably aluminum (Al), magnesium (Mg) or both of them.<br>
Since the oxidation number of the substituent metal is smaller than that of manganese (Mn), an increasing amount of the substituted metal leads to a decrease in an average value of the oxidation number and a relative increase in the oxidation number of manganese (Mn), consequently resulting in inhibition of manganese (Mn) dissolution. That is, as the amount of the substituted metal (z) in the lithium/manganese spinel oxide of Formula III increases, life characteristics are further improved. However, since an increasing amount of the substituted metal (z) is also accompanied by a decrease of initial capacity, a maximum value of z is preferably less than 0.2, which is capable of maximizing improvements of the life characteristics and minimizing reduction of the initial capacity of the battery. More preferably, the value of z is in the range of 0.01 to 0.2.<br>
Methods of preparing lithium metal composite oxides, such as lithium/manganese spinel oxides of Formula I, lithium/nickel/cobalt/manganese composite oxides of Formula II and lithium/manganese spinel oxides of Formula III wherein a portion of manganese is substituted with a certain metal, are well-known in the art and thus will not be described herein.<br>
Hereinafter, fabrication of a cathode containing a cathode active material according to the present invention will be specifically illustrated.<br>
First, the cathode active material of the present invention, and a binder and a conductive material in a content of 1 to 20% by weight relative to the active material are added to a dispersion solvent and the resulting dispersion is stirred to prepare an electrode paste. The paste is applied to a metal plate for a current collector which is then compressed and dried to fabricate a laminate electrode.<br>
The cathode current collector is generally fabricated to have a thickness of 3 to 500 um. There is no particular limit to the cathode current collector, so long as it has high conductivity without causing chemical changes in the fabricated battery. As examples of the cathode current collector, mention may be made of stainless steel, aluminum, nickel, titanium, sintered carbon, and aluminum or stainless steel which was surface-treated with carbon, nickel, titanium or silver. The current collector may be fabricated to have fine irregularities on the surface thereof so as to enhance adhesion to the cathode active material. In addition, the current collector may take various forms including films, sheets, foils, nets, porous structures, foams and non-woven fabrics.<br>

Where appropriate, the filler may be optionally added as an ingredient to inhibit cathode expansion. There is no particular limit to the filler, so long as it does not cause chemical changes in the fabricated battery and is a fibrous material. As examples of the filler, there may be used olefin polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene; and fibrous materials such as glass fiber and carbon fiber.<br>
Representative examples of the dispersion solvent that can be used in the present invention may include isopropyl alcohol, N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) and acetone.<br>
Uniform application of the paste of electrode materials to a metal material may be carried out by conventional methods known in the art or appropriate novel methods, taking into consideration characteristics of materials to be used. For example, preferably<br>
the electrode paste is distributed onto the current collector and is then uniformly dispersed thereon using a doctor blade. Where appropriate, distribution and dispersion of the electrode paste may also be performed in a single step. Further, application of the electrode paste may be carried out by a method selected from die casting, comma coating, screen printing and the like. Alternatively, application of the electrode paste may be carried out by molding the paste on a separate substrate and then binding it to the current collector via pressing or lamination.<br>
Drying of the paste applied over the metal plate is preferably carried out in a vacuum oven at 50 to 200°C for 1 to 3 days.<br>
Further, the present invention provides a lithium secondary battery comprising the cathode fabricated as above.<br>
The lithium secondary battery of the present invention is comprised of an electrode assembly composed of the above-mentioned cathode and an anode, which are arranged opposite to each other with a separator therebetween, and a lithium salt-containing, non-aqueous electrolyte.<br>

Similar to the cathode current collector, the anode current collector may also be fabricated to form fine irregularities on the surface thereof so as to enhance adhesion to the anode active material. In addition, the anode current collector may take various forms including films, sheets, foils, nets, porous structures, foams and non-woven fabrics.<br>

A lithium/manganese spinel oxide of Lin+xMn2O4 having an average particle size of 19 µm and a lithium/nickel/cobalt/manganese composite oxide of Lii+zNi1/3Coi/3Mni/3O2 having an average particle size of 17 µm were mixed in a weight ratio of 1 : 1 to thereby prepare a cathode active material. The cathode active material was mixed with 5% by weight of carbon black and 5% by weight of PVdF as a binder, and stirred with NMP as a solvent. The resulting mixture was coated on aluminum foil as a metal current collector which was then dried in a vacuum oven at 120°C for more than 2 hours, thereby fabricating a cathode.<br>
An electrode assembly was fabricated using the thus-fabricated cathode, an anode which was fabricated by coating mesocarbon microbeads (MCMBs) as artificial graphite on copper foil, and a porous separator made of polypropylene. The electrode assembly was placed in a pouch case to which electrode leads were then connected. Thereafter, as an electrolyte, a solution of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1:1, v/v), in which 1M LiPF6 salt was dissolved, was injected thereto, followed by sealing the case to assemble a lithium secondary battery.<br>
The thus-fabricated lithium secondary battery was subjected to charge/discharge cycling in a voltage range of 3.0 to 4.2 V and life characteristics of the battery were measured. The results thus obtained are given in Table 1 below.<br>

The thus-fabricated lithium secondary battery was subjected to charge/discharge cycling in a voltage range of 3.0 to 4.2 V and life characteristics of the battery were measured. The results are given in Table 1 below.<br>

As can be seen from Table 1, increases in the average particle size of the lithium/manganese spinel oxide and lithium/nickel/cobalt/manganese composite oxide resulted in improvements of life characteristics. When the average particle size of at least one of above two oxides was more than 15 µm, more than 70% of battery performance relative to initial capacity was exerted even after 300 cycles. When the average particle size of both oxides was less than 15µm, life characteristics of the battery are significantly deteriorated with at most 60% of the initial capacity being exerted under the same conditions. Particularly, it was confirmed that when the average particle size of both oxides was more than 15 µm, life characteristics of the battery were further improved.<br>

The thus-fabricated lithium secondary battery was subjected to charge/discharge cycling in a voltage range of 3.0 to 4.2 V and life characteristics of the battery were measured. The results are given in Table 2 below.<br>
[Example 9]<br>
A lithium secondary battery was assembled in the same manner as in Example 1, except that a cathode active material was prepared by mixing a lithium/manganese spinel oxide of Li1+xMn2O4 having an average particle size of 19 µm, and a lithium/nickel/cobalt/manganese composite oxide of Li1+zNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 having an average particle size of 9 ^m in a weight ratio of 30 : 70. The thus-fabricated lithium secondary battery was subjected to charge/discharge cycling in a voltage range of 3.0 to 4.2 V and life characteristics of the battery were measured. The results are given in Table 2 below.<br>
[Example 10]<br>
A lithium secondary battery was assembled in the same manner as in Example 1, except that a cathode active material was prepared by mixing a lithium/manganese spinel oxide of Li1+xMn2O4 having an average particle size of 19 um and a lithium/nickel/cobalt/manganese composite oxide of Li1+zNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 having an average particle size of 9 um in a weight ratio of 10 : 90. The thus-fabricated lithium secondary battery was subjected to charge/discharge cycling in a voltage range of 3.0 to 4.2 V and life characteristics of the battery were measured. The results are given in Table 2 below.<br>
[Comparative Example 2]<br>
A lithium secondary battery was assembled in the same manner as in Example 1, except that a cathode active material was prepared using only a lithium/manganese spinel oxide of Li1+xMn2O4 having an average particle size of 19 µm. The thus-fabricated lithium secondary battery was subjected to charge/discharge cycling in a<br>
voltage range of 3.0 to 4.2 V and life characteristics of the battery were measured. The results are given in Table 2 below.<br>
[Comparative Example 3]<br>
A lithium secondary battery was assembled in the same manner as in Example 1, except that a cathode active material was prepared using only a lithium/nickel/cobalt/manganese composite oxide of Li1+zNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 having an average particle size of 9 µm. The thus-fabricated lithium secondary battery was subjected to charge/discharge cycling in a voltage range of 3.0 to 4.2 V and life characteristics of the battery were measured. The results are given in Table 2 below.<br>
 (Table Removed)<br>
As can be seen from Table 2, life characteristics of the battery began to improve when more than 10% lithium/nickel/cobalt/manganese composite oxide having an average particle size of 9 µm was added to the lithium/manganese spinel oxide having an average particle size of 19 µm, and addition of 30%lithium/nickel/cobalt/manganese composite oxide reached the maximum value of life characteristics. However, an excessively high content of the lithium/nickel/cobalt/manganese composite oxide may result in relatively low safety of the battery and therefore it is preferred to use the lithium/nickel/cobalt/manganese composite oxide in an amount of less than 90%. In addition, it can be seen that batteries of Examples 6 to 10 exhibit superior life characteristics, as compared to batteries of Comparative Examples 2 and 3 which contain a single kind of an oxide as an active material.<br>

A lithium secondary battery was assembled in the same manner as in Example 1, except that a cathode active material was prepared using a substituted lithium/manganese spinel oxide of Li1+xMn1.9Alo.iO4, instead<br>
The thus-fabricated lithium secondary battery was subjected to charge/discharge cycling in a voltage range of 3.0 to 4.2 V and life characteristics of the battery were measured. The results are given in Table 3 below.<br>
[Example 12]<br>

[Example 14]<br>
A lithium secondary battery was assembled in the same manner as in Example 1, except that a cathode active material was prepared using a substituted lithium/manganese spinel oxide of Li1+xMn1.9Mgo.iO4, instead of using Li1+xMn2O4<br>
The thus-fabricated lithium secondary battery was subjected to charge/discharge cycling in a voltage range of 3.0 to 4.2 V and life characteristics of the battery were measured. The results are given in Table 3 below.<br>
[Example 15]<br>

 (Table Removed)<br>
As can be seen from Table 3, in the composite oxide mixtures of the cathode active materials, substitution of a manganese (Mn) site of the lithium/manganese spinel oxide with aluminum (Al) or magnesium (Mg) has led to further improvements in life characteristics of the battery. In addition, the higher substitution amounts (z-value) of metal ions have led to further improvements in life characteristics. However, it was confirmed that when the substitution amount, i.e., the z value, exceeds 0.2, the initial capacity of the battery is decreased.<br>
