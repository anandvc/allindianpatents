				<td>PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS HAVING APPETITE SUPPRESSANT ACTIVITY<br>
THIS INVENTION relates to steroidal glycosides, to compositions containing such steroidal glycosides and to a new use for these steroidal glycosides and the compositions containing them. The invention further relates to a method of extracting and isolating these steroidal glycosides from plant material, to a method of synthetically producing these steroidal glycosides, and to the products of such an extraction and such a synthesis process.<br>
In a particular application, the invention relates to an appetite suppressant agent, to a process for synthetically producing the appetite suppressant agent, to a process for extracting the appetite suppressant agent from plant material, to an appetite suppressant composition containing the appetite suppressant agent, and to a method of suppressing an appetite.<br>
According to the invention, there is provided a process for preparing an extract of a plant of the genus Trichocaulon or of the genus Hoodia, the extract comprising an appetite suppressant agent, the process including the steps of treating collected plant material with a solvent to extract a fraction having appetite suppressant activity, separating the extraction solution from the rest of the plant material, removing the solvent from the extraction solution and recovering the extract. The extract so recovered may be further purified, eg by way of suitable solvent extraction procedures.<br>
The invention also provides a plant extract made of plants of the group comprising the genus Trichocaulon and the genus Hoodia  and having appetite suppressant activity.<br>
The extract may be prepared from plant material such as the  stems and roots of  said plants of the genus<br><br>
Trichocaulon     or  of  the  genus Hoodia.	The  genus<br>
Trichocaulon and the genus Hoodia include succulent plants<br>
growing in arid regions such as are found in Southern<br>
Africa. In one application of the invention, the active<br>
appetite suppressant extract is obtained from the species<br>
Trichocaulon      piliferum.	The  species  Trichocaulon<br>
officinale may ajso be used to provide an active appetite suppressant extract. In another application of the invention, the active appetite suppressant extract may be obtained from the species Hoodia currorii, Hoodia gordonii or Hoodia lugardii- Bioassays conducted by the Applicant on rats have indicated that certain of the extracts possess appetite suppressant activity.<br>
The plant material may be homogenised in the presence of a suitable solvent, for example, a methanol/methylene chloride solvent, by means of a device such as a Waring blender. The extraction solution may then be separated from the residual plant material by an appropriate separation procedure such as, for example, filtration or centrifugation. The solvent may be removed by means of the rotary evaporator preferably in a water bath at a temperature of 60°C. The separated crude extract may then be further extracted with methylene chloride and water before being separated into a methylene chloride extract and a water extract. The methylene chloride extract may have the solvent removed preferably by means of evaporation on a rotary evaporator and the resultant extract may be further purified by way of a methanol/hexane extraction. The methanol/hejcane extraction product may then be separated to yield a methanol extract and a hexane extract. The methanol extact may be evaporated to remove the solvent in ordei to yield a partially purified active extract.<br>
The partially purified active extract may be dissolved in methanol, and may be further fractionated by column chromatography,  employing silica gel  as  an adsorption<br><br>
medium and a chloroform/30% methanol mixture as an eluent. A plurality of different fractions may be obtained, and each may be evaluated, by suitable bioassaying procedures, to determine the appetite suppressant activity thereof.<br>
A fraction having appetite suppressant activity may preferably be further fractionated such as by column chromatography using silica gel as an adsorption medium and a 9:1 chloroform:methanol solvent, and the resultant sub-fractions bioassayed for their appetite suppressant activity. A sub-fraction displaying appetite suppressant activity may, if desired, be further fractionated and purified, conveniently using a column chromatographic procedure with silica gel as the adsorption medium and a 9:1 ethylacetate:hexane solvent. The resultant purified fractions may again be evaluated by suitable bioassay procedures for their appetite suppressant activity.<br>
The Applicant has found that at least one such purified fraction has good appetite suppressant activity, and the active principle in the fraction was identified by conventional chemical techniques including nuclear magnetic resonance, and was found to be a compound of the structural<br><br><br>
In accordance with S.I.  nomenclature,  the active principle (1) is the compound 3-0-[-/3-D-thevetopyranosyl-(14) -/3-D-cymaropyranosyl- (l-»4) -(3-D-cymaropyranosyl] -12/3-0-tigloyloxy-14-hydroxy-14/3-pregn-50-en-20-one  (C47H74O15 M"*"878) .<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for preparing an extract of a plant of the genus Trichocaulon or of the genus Hoodia, the extract comprising an appetite suppressant agent, the process including the steps of pressing collected plant material to separate sap from solid plant material and recovering the sap free of the solid plant material to form the extract.<br>
The extract may be dried to remove moisture, e.g. by spray-drying, freeze-drying or vacuum drying, to form a free-flowing powder.<br>
The Invention extends to a composition having appetite suppressant activity comprising an extract as described above.<br>
The composition may be admixed with a pharmaceutical excipient, diluent or carrier and optionally it is prepared in unit dosage form.<br>

The invention extends also to a foodstuff or a beverage containing an effective quantity of the steroidal glycoside of the formula (1), or its derivatives or analogues as set out before, to have an appetite suppressant effect when ingested.<br>
Molecular genetic studies have led to a considerable increase in the understanding of the regulation of appetite, satiety and bodyweight. These studies have revealed numerous central regulatory pathways, mediated by a number of neuropeptides. The maintenance of a normal body weight is achieved by an intricate balance between energy intake, food consumption, and energy expenditure. Energy homeostasis is subject to a wide range of influences, ultimately controlled by the brain. The different signals include such things as sense of smell and taste and gastro-intestinal signals such as distension of the gastro-intestinal tract, chemical signals to the gastric mucosa and blood-borne metabolites such as fatty acids and glucose.<br>
Centrally, neuropeptide "Y" (NPY) which is negatively regulated by leptin, has -been established as one of the positive regulators of feeding behaviour. Expression of the endogenous antagonist for melanocortin receptors has also been shown to be the basis for obesity in a particular model (the ob/ob mouse) . Indeed deficiency at the MC4 melanocortin receptor completely replicates the obesity syndrome. Other mediators which have been shown to have roles in the energy balance include bombesin, galonin and glucagon-like peptide-1.<br><br>
without being bound by theory, the Applicant believes that compound (1) and its analogues as described above act as an agonist of the raelanocortin 4 receptor. The effect of this is to regulate NPY but also to increase cholecystokinin. The effect of cholecystokinin amongst other things is to inhibit gastric emptying.<br>
Accordingly, the invention extends to a composition having appetite suppressant activity comprising a raelanocortin 4 receptor agonist.<br>
The agonist may be an extract or compound as previously described, in particular the compound of formula (1). The composition may be admixed with a pharmaceutical excipient, diluent or carrier and is optionally prepared in unit dosage form.<br>
The invention still further extends to the use of a raelanocortin 4 receptor agonist in the manufacture of a raedicament having appetite suppressant activity, to a raelanocortin 4 receptor agonist for use as a medicament having appetite suppressant activity, to a method of suppressing an appetite by administering to a human or animal an effective dosage of a composition comprising a raelanocortin 4 agonist as described above, and to the use of a melanocortin 4 receptor agonist to suppress the appetite of and/or to combat obesity in a human or animal.<br>
The invention and its efficacy will now be further described, without limitation of the scope of the invention, with reference to the following examples and drawings.<br>
In the drawings. Figure 1 shows a flow diagram of the general method of extracting a first crude appetite suppressant extract and a_purified appetite suppressant extract from plant material of the genus Trichocaulon  or Hoodia;<br><br>
Figure 2 shows a graphical representation of a bioassay carried out on rats using a partially purified methanol extract of Trichocaulon piliferum;<br>
Figures 3 and 4 together show a schematic representation of a preferred embodiment of the process of the invention for producing an extract of plant material of the genus Trichocaulon  or Uoodia.;     and<br>
Figures 5 and 6 show a graphical representation of the percentage change of body mass of rats for different groups for days -7 to 7 and days 0 to 7 respectively in a repeat dose study using a sap extract and a spray-dried sap extract of plant material of the species Hoodia. gordonii.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
The general method of extracting a first crude appetite suppressant extract and a purified appetite suppressant extract from plant material of the genus Trichocaulon or of the genus Hoodia is illustrated by way of the flow diagram of Figure 1.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Bioassays carried out on rats using a partially purified methanol extract obtained in the manner illustrated in Example 1, indicated that the extract does in fact exhibit appetite suppressant activity. The appetite suppressant activity of the active extract can be illustrated by way of a typical example of the effect of the methanol extract of Trichocaulon piliferum on rats, by way of the graphic representation in Figure 2.<br>
It will be evident from Figure 2 that the test group of rats dosed with the extract on day 5 displayed a substantially diminished food intake over the next two days, while a control group did "riot disclose a comparable<br><br>
reduced food intake. The food intake of the test group returned to normal, and in fact increased, from day 8 onwards.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
A preferred embodiment of a process in accordance with the invention for producing an extract having appetite suppressant activity is illustrated schematically by way of example in Figures 3 and 4, which two Figures together illustrate the comprehensive process. However, various other procedures may be used, as will be understood by persons skilled in the art.<br>
Referring to Figure 3, plant material of the genus Trichocaulon or the genus Hoodia. is fed into a blender 3, eg a Waring blender, by way of feedline 1, with a solvent in the form of a methylene chloride/methanol solution introduced via feedline 2. The homogenised product is fed via line 4 into a separation stage 5, eg in the form of a filter or centrifuge, and the residual plant material is removed via line 27.<br>
The solvent/extract mixture is fed via line 6 into an evaporation stage 7, where the solvent is removed, for example by means of a rotor evaporator. The dried crude extract is fed via line 8 into a further extraction stage 9 with the addition of a methylene chloride/water solution introduced via feedline 29 for further extraction, and then to a separation stage 13 by way of line 11, where the water fraction is removed via line 31. The dissolved extract fraction is fed via line 15 into a drier stage 17 where the solvent is evaporated, for example by a rotor evaporator.<br>
Referring to Figure 4, the dried extract is fed via line 10 into an extraction stage 12. A methanol/hexane solution is also fed via line 14 into the extraction stage 12 for further purification and""extraction of the dried<br><br>
extract. The extract/methanol/hexane mixture is fed via line 16 into a separation stage 18, the hexane fraction is removed via line 20, and the methanol/extract mixture is then fed via line 22 into a drying stage 24. In the drying stage 24, the solvent is removed, eg by evaporation on a rotor evaporator.<br>
The dried, partially purified active extract is fed via line 26 and with the addition of methanol via line 28 into a solution stage 30, and the dissolved fraction is fed via line 36 to a chromatography column 38.<br>
In the column 3 8 the methanol soluble fraction is further fractionated, using silica gel and a chloroform/30% methanol solvent, into different fractions schematically indicated as fractions I to V. According to an actual fractionation procedure carried out by the Applicant, the fractionation procedure yielded the following fraction weights : 1(3.9 g) ; II{2.6 g) ; 111(2.1 g) ; IV(1.1 g) and V(2.0 g) . These fractions are individually evaluated by a suitable bioassaying procedure (in a step not shown) and those fractions identified as fractions I and II, displaying marked appetite suppressant activity, are fed by feedlines 40 and 42 into columns 44 and 4 6 respectively where they are further fractionated and purified by column chromatography, again by using silica gel and a 9:1 chloroform:methanol system.<br>
The sub-fractions 11(A) - (C) obtained from column 44 do not, when assayed, display a noteworthy appetite suppressant activity, and may be recycled for further chromatography.<br>
The sub-fractions I(A) - (L) obtained from column 46 are also evaluated (by an assaying step not shown), and the sub-fraction 1(C) is found to have marked appetite suppressant activity.<br><br>
t— The sub-fraction I(C) is fed via line 48 into column 50 for a further fractionation and purification, using silica gel and a 9:1 ethyl acetate:hexane eluent. Of the resultant purified fractions, fraction 1(C)(ii) is found, after assaying, to possess marked appetite suppressant activity.<br>
The purified product is identified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (as indicated in Tables 1 and 2 below}, to be compound (1).<br><br><br><br><br><br>

EXAMPLE 42<br>
The results of the following three bioassays on the appetite suppressant are set out below, viz.<br>
a)	Irwin Test;<br>
b)	Acute Toxicity Test;  and<br>
c)	Oral Dose Anorectic Test.<br>
a)   Irwin Test<br>
The purpose of this test was to evaluate the appetite suppressant of the invention produced from a plant extract as hereinbefore described, according to the reduced animal Irwin test for tranquillising and sedative action.<br><br>
axperimentax Procedure<br>
The appetite suppressant was extracted from plant material by the Applicant by the method as hereinbefore described and administered to two of four groups of three animals each: one group receiving no treatment, one group receiving the solvent dimethylsulfoxide {DMSO), one group receiving the test sample at 50 mg/kg, and one group receiving the test sample at 300 mg/kg. Treatment took place by intraperitoneal injection, and observations were made at specific intervals up to five hours post treatment. Only symptoms other than those observed in the DMSO-treated animals were used in the interpretation of the results.<br>
Results<br>
It was clear that the solvent, DMSO, had a marked effect on the animals, especially on the heat regulating mechanism. Body temperatures of all Che animals treated with the solvent, alone or together with the test sample, showed a marked drop.<br>
Animals in the low dose group showed decreased dispersion in the cage and decreased locomotor activity, as in all the other groups, including the control group, Apathy was seen in the same degree as in the DMSO-treated group. Decreased respiration was observed 15-60 minutes after treatment. Ptosis (closing of the eyelids) was also observed to a larger degree than in the DMSO group.   A<br><br>
pinna (ear) response was seen as well as a positive finger response, indicating fearfulness. Body temperature dropped to 32,7°C after treatment.<br>
Animals in the high dose group showed as in the other groups an initial decreased dispersion in the cage and decreased locomotor activity, but showed increased dispersion and locomotor activity before death, which occurred approximately 1 hour after treatment. Severe clonic symmetrical convulsions occurred 30 minutes after treatment. Respiration decreased initially, but increased before death. A pinna (ear) response was delayed and a positive finger response was observed, indicating fearfulness, both as observed in animals in the low dose group. Body temperature dropped to 30,7°C after treatment. Increased positional passivity was observed as well as decreased body tone. Abnormal limb rotation was observed, the grip strength decreased, no pain response was present and loss of righting reflex occurred.<br>
Discussion<br>
When compared with the control and DMSO-treated animals, animals receiving the low dose (50 mg/kg) only showed decreased respiration and an increased degree of ptosis. Animals receiving the high dose (300 mg/kg) of the test sample reacted very intensely by showing convulsions and death. All other observations made in these animals can be ascribed to the animals being in convulsions and<br><br>
dying. Signs suggestive of tranquillising and sedative actions such as marked decreased dispersion in the cages, decreased locomotor activity and apathy in the test groups that could be ascribed to the test sample were not seen.<br>
It can therefore be concluded that the test sample is lethal to mice at 300 mg/kg and has respiratory suppressive effects on mice at 50 mg/kg, when given intraperitoneally with DMSO as solvent.<br>
b)   Acute Toxicity Test<br>
The purpose of this, test was to gain information on the toxicity of the test sample.<br>
Experimental Procedure<br>
A plant extract prepared in accordance with the invention as hereinbefore described, and having appetite suppressive action was purified and one test sample was tested at increasing doses by oral treatment in mice. Two animals were used per dose group, except in the highest dose group where only one animal was treated. Animals were examined for good health and their body masses determined on the day of treatment.<br>
Doses ranged from 100 mg/kg up to 3 028,5 mg/kg. The dose was calculated and mixed into prepared potato starch, so that each animal received a total dose of 0,2 ml.<br><br>
Animal 13 received 0,25 ml. Potato starch was prepared by mixing 20 g starch into a small volume of cold water, and adding it to boiling water, to make up a volume of 1 litre. The suspension was allowed to cool to room temperature before dosing.<br>
Animals in groups 1 and 2 were treated on the same day. They were observed for 24 hours and if no signs of toxicity developed, the next group was treated. The same approach was followed until all the animals were treated. This schedule was followed to ensure that animals were not unnecessarily treated when an acute toxic dose had been reached in the previous group.<br>
Animals were observed for clinical signs of toxicity immediately {1-2 hours) after treatment and daily thereafter. Body mass was determined once a week and total food and water intakes of each animal were measured.<br>
Surviving animals were euthanased by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbitone sodium (commercially available under the trade name Euthanaze, Centaur) on day 14 of the experiment. A post-mortem examination was performed on these animals, as well as on the one animal which died during the experiment. Samples for histopathology were collected.<br><br>
Results<br>
Group 1 (Control Group)<br>
No clinical signs of toxicity were observed during the 14-day observation period. Food and water intakes were within the normal parameters. Changes in body mass were also within normal parameters. No histopathological changes were recorded in the liver samples.<br>
Group 2 (100 mcr/kci)<br>
No clinical signs of toxicity were observed during the observation period. Food and water intakes were normal and changes in body mass over the observation period were also normal. No macroscopical pathology was observed and no histopathological or morphological changes were recorded in the liver samples.<br>
Group 3 (200 mq/kq)<br>
Animals in this group showed no clinical symptoms of toxicity during the experiment. Food and water intakes were normal, as was the change in body mass. No macroscopic pathology was observed, but the livers showed histopathological changes on examination. Cloudy swelling of the hepatocytes was mild in animal 6, but moderate in animal 5. Moderate hydropic degeneration also occurred in the hepatocytes of animal 5.<br><br>
Group 4 (4UU mcf/Kq)<br>
No clinical signs of toxicity were observed during the observation period, and no macroscopic pathology was observed during the post-mortem examination. Moderate cloudy swelling and mild hydropic changes of the hepatocytes were observed on histology.<br>
Water and food intakes and the increase in body mass in animal 7 were normal. Animal 8 consumed almost double the total food intake of animal 7 (144,6 g and 73,9 g respectively), but the increase in body mass was only 0,81 g compared to 2,7 g.<br>
Group 5 (800 mq/kq)<br>
One animal (animal 10) died three hours after dosing without showing any specific signs.   The other animal<br>
(animal 9) survived the entire observation period without any signs of toxicity. Water intake in the surviving animal was normal (42,42 ml) , while food intake was high<br>
(134,2 g). The body mass increased by 2,85 g which was the highest of all animals in the experiment.<br>
At the post-mortem examination of animal 10, which died shortly after oral dosing, the lungs were congested. No foreign body reaction which would have indicated inhalation of test material was present. No macroscopic pathology was observed in animal  9.   Mild cytoplasmic vacuolisation<br><br>
{hydropic degeneration) was present in animal 10, but moderate in animal 9. The glandular cytoplasmic appearance of the liver was classified as moderate in both animals.<br>
Group 6 (1 600 mq/kq)<br>
None of the animals presented any clinical signs of toxicity during the duration of the experiment. No macroscopic pathology was observed at post-mortem examination, but moderate degenerative changes in the liver of animal 11 were observed at histopathological examination. Animal 12 showed moderate cloudy swelling and mild hydropic changes of the hepatocytes. Food and water intakes were normal, as was the increase in body mass over the experimental period.<br>
Group 7 (3 028,5 mg/kg)<br>
Only one animal was treated at this dose. This animal showed no signs of toxicity during the observation period, and no macroscopic pathology was observed. At histopathological examination, moderate cloudy swelling and hydropic degeneration of the hepatocytes was observed. The animal showed a loss of body mass over the observation period (-0,82 g), but food and water intakes were normal.<br><br>
Discussion<br>
Since a very small number of animals were used in each dose group, it is difficult to make any conclusions. The fact that only one animal died at a low dose rate, without showing any symptoms, might indicate that death was not related to the test sample, but due to stress during and/or after treatment. No animals in higher dose groups died or showed any signs of toxicity, which further supports this assumption.<br>
The increased food intake observed in animal 8 could possibly be ascribed to excessive spillage of food as was reflected in the small increase in body mass. It should be kept in mind that all the animals in this experiment were only treated once, and that it is unlikely that an appetite suppressor will have a marked influence on either the food or water intakes, or body mass over a 14 day period, as was the case in this experiment.<br>
From the histopathological examination of the liver samples, it was clear that the pathological changes were dose related, with animals receiving higher doses showing the extensive changes. The pathology observed was not metabolic of nature, but possibly test sample-induced. The changes were only degenerative and therefore reversible. No signs of irreversible hepatocellular changes were observed.<br><br>
It can, therefore, be concluded that only one animal died at a lower dose (800 mg/kg) , but that the death was possibly not test sample related. None of the other animals in any of the dose groups showed any signs of toxicity during the 14 day observation period after treatment, or died as result of the treatment. A single oral dose of the test sample induced reversible dose-related hepatocellular changes.<br>
c)   Oral Dose Anorectic Test<br>
The purpose of this test was to determine the activity of a plant extract prepared in accordance with the invention, and the minimum effective dose, and at the same time investigate any possible side-effects such as respiratory suppression, as experienced in the Irwin Test (referred to above).<br>
Experimental Procedure<br>
Animals were allocated to treatment groups using randomisation tables. Each treatment group consisted of three animals, with 6 animals in the control group. The test sample was dosed to young female rats with body weight 100-150 g at acclimatisation, for three consecutive days. Animals were identified by means of metallic ear tags and KMnO skin markings for easy identification. Animals were housed individually in standard rodent polycarbonate cages, and water and powdered commercial rodent pellets were<br><br>
available ad libitum. Water and food intakes were measured and calculated for each day. In order to find the minimum effective dose of the test sample, five doses were tested. Treatment was by oral gavage, with the test sample suspended in potato starch.<br>
The test substance was compound (!), a white granular powder prepared from an extract from plant material in accordance with the invention, and the measured quantity of the test sample was mixed with prepared potato starch and dosed. Mixing with potato starch took place immediately before dosing on each day. Before withdrawal of the dosing volume for each animal, the suspensions were mixed thoroughly using a Vortex.<br>
A range of five doses was tested, with a control group receiving only the carrier substance. Doses were chosen on the basis of the effects observed in the aforedescribed Irwin Test and were:<br>
Group	1:	0,00 mg/kg (Control Group)<br>
Group	2:	6,25 mg/kg<br>
Group	3:	12,50 mg/kg<br>
Group	4:	25,00 mg/kg<br>
Group	5:	37,50 mg/kg<br>
Group	6:	50,00 mg/kg<br><br>
Results<br>
Treatment did not affect the health of the animals during the study period. Animals treated with the test sample in all dose groups, showed a significantly reduced mean body mass gain over the total study period, and animals in three of the five treatment groups actually lost body mass.<br>
Mean food intakes for all the treatment groups were reduced over the study period. Animals in the higher dose groups showed an increased water consumption.<br>
Respiratory rate in none of the animals in any dose group was significantly effected.<br>
Animals in all dose groups presented with friable livers at post-mortem examination, but no macroscopic pathology was observed.<br>
Discussion<br>
Data collected during the acclimatisation period confirmed that all animals included in the experiment were healthy and body mass gain was comparable between the animals.<br>
The reduction, and in some animals even a loss, in body mass gain, in combination with the reduced food intake is<br><br>
strongly indicative of suppression of the appetite centre.<br>
Reduced food intake and reduced body mass gain was experienced even with the lowest dose group {6,25 mg/kg}. Actual loss in body mass was experienced in the 12,50 mg/kg group.<br>
It is important to note that the treatment groups all had an increased water consumption when feed consumption decreased (Figure 2} . This could be due to a diuretic effect of the test sample, or to stimulation of the thirst centre in the brain.<br>
The fact that no respiratory suppression occurred as had been observed in the acute toxicity test referred to above, with the intraperitoneal route, is seen as a positive aspect. This could be due to reduced absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, with consequent reduced bioavailability. The bioavailability at the oral doses tested was, however, sufficient for the test sample to be effective. The slight reduction in respiratory rate 1 hour post treatment in most groups could be ascribed to filling of the stomach with the dose volume and consequent passivity of the animals.<br>
The friable livers observed in the treatment groups could be due to a change in the energy metabolism secondary to the reduced food intake, causing increased fat metabolism and overload on the liver.  If this was indeed<br><br>
the case, these cnanges couia possibly be regarded these changes as transitory which might recover with time after a steady state had been reached, or after withdrawal of the test sample. The possible effect on the liver also needs further investigation.<br>
Since this study was intended primarily as a screening test, small groups of test animals were used. This makes statistical interpretation of the data difficult, especially where individual animals react totally differently. However, the data indicates that the test sample has appetite suppressive action, even at the lowest dose tested (5,25 mg/kg}. No clinical signs of respiratory suppression occurred at the doses tested.<br>
EXAMPLE 43<br>
Harvested Hoodia plants received either from the natural environment or through a cultivation programme are first stored at 4°C for a maximum of 48 hours. The plants are washed in tap water and thereafter sliced into + 1 cm slices. The sliced pieces are all combined and then pressed through a hydraulic press at 300 bar pressure for a minimum of 0.5 hour per pressing. During the pressing the sap of the plant is collected separately. The sap is stored at -18°C  until further processing is required.<br>
The sap is spray-dried under suitable conditions to obtain a free flowing powder.  The moisture content in the powder<br><br>
is preferably less than 5% after spray drying and, if necessary, it is further dried in a vacuum oven or using a fluid bed drier.<br>
Both the sap and the spray-dried material have been shown effective as an appetite suppressant in biological assays in rats.<br>
Experimental<br>
50 kg of Hoodia. gordonii plants were washed with tap water and thereafter sliced into 1 cm slices. The sliced plants were then pressed through a hydraulic press at 300 bar for a minimum of 0.5 hour per batch. The sap was collected and the mass was found to be 10 kg when Hoodia gordonii plants from the environment were used, and 20 kg when Hoodia gordonii plants from the cultivation programme was used. The sap (500 g) was spray-dried using the following conditions:<br><br>
Flow rate Inlet temperature Outlet temperature Chamber temperature<br><br>
2.85 ml/min 110°C<br>
70°C<br>
78°C<br><br>
The spray-dried powder obtained was a free flowing powder (22 g) with a moisture content of 6.9%.<br>
The spray dried powder was analysed for active ingredient concentration using HPLC techniques. The concentration of the active was determined to be 13 g/kg of spray dried powder.<br><br>

Spray-dried powder (10 mg} was dissolved in water (0.5 ml) and acetonitrile (0.5 ml) lO/il of this solution was injected into the HPLC and the concentration of the active compound (1) was determined using a standard curve which was prepared from the pure compound (1).<br>
EXAMPLE 44<br>
The results of a study designed to assess the possible anorectic effects of compound (1) in the rat are presented below. In the following, the samples tested are pure sap (Sample 1) , spray-dried sap (Sample 2) and active moiety (Sample 3) . Samples 1 and 2 are the sap and the spray-dried sap respectively, as described in Example 43 above. Sample 3 is solvent-extracted compound (1) of &amp;95% purity.<br>
Sample 1 to 3 were each administered as a single oral dose to male Wistar rats. Two additional control groups received vehicle (distilled water or DMSO). Orally administered fenfluramine (7.5 mg/kg) was included as a reference standard.<br>
Sample 1 (pure sap) administered orally, produced dose-dependent reductions in food consumption which were statistically significant at doses of 1600 mg/kg and above when compared with vehicle-treated controls. Cojcomitant reductions in bodyweight (or growth rate) were also recorded.  On the day of dosing, statistically significant<br><br>
increases in water consumption were recorded at 3 hours post-dose (6400 and 10000 mg/kg) and 6 hours post-dose (10000 mg/kg). Between 24 and 48 hours post-dose, statistically significant reductions in water consumption were recorded at doses of 3200 rag/kg and above.<br>
Sample 2 (spray-dried sap) administered orally at 76 mg/kg also produced statistically significant reductions in food consumption and bodyweight when compared with vehicle-treated animals. No statistically significant effects on water consumption were recorded.<br>
Sample 3 (active moiety) produced statistically significant reductions in food consumption at an oral dose of 5.0 mg/kg. No statistically significant effects on bodyweights were produced by the active moiety although examination of the data revealed a slight delay in growth when compared with vehicle-treated control animals. No statistically significant effects on water consumption were recorded.<br>
The reference standard, fenfluramine (7.5 mg/kg), produced statistically significant reductions in food consumption at 6 and 24 hours post-dose when compared with the relevant vehicle-treated control group. No statistically significant effects on water consumption or bodyweight were recorded.<br>
No treatment-related effects on the livers were recorded.<br><br><br><br>
Experimental Procedure<br>
Fifty-five male Wistar rats were used for the study.<br>
Bodyweights, food consumption (food hopper weight) and water consumption (bottle weight) were recorded daily at the same time each day from the day of arrival until the termination of the study.<br>
On Day 1, the rats received a single oral (gavage) dose according to the following table:<br>
Group  n  Oral treatment	Dose<br>
(mg/kg)<br>
1	5	Vehicle (distilled water)<br>
2	4	Sample 1 (pure sap)	800<br>
3	5	Sample 1 (pure sap)	1600<br>
4	5	Sample 1 (pure sap)	3200<br>
5	5	Sample 1 (pure sap)	6400<br>
6	5	Sample 1 (pure sap)	10000<br>
7	5	Sample 2 spray-dried sap	3 8<br>
8	5	Sample 2 spray-dried sap	76<br>
9	5	Sample 3 (active moiety}	2.5<br>
10	5	Sample 3 (active moiety)	5.0<br>
11	3	Fenfluramine	7.5<br>
12	3	Vehicle (DMSO)<br>
Groups 1-8 were dosed using a constant dose volume of 10 ml/kg and groups 9-12 were dosed using a dose volume of 1 ml/kg.<br>
Food and water consumption were also measured at 1,3 and 6 hours after dosing on Day 1.<br>
Following the measurements of Day 8, the animals were killed by carbon dioxide asphyxiation, and the livers excised and placed in 10% buffered formalin, prior to histology.<br><br>
Paraffin wax sections of each liver were taken at 4 - 5 m and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Additional sections were cut on a cryostat at 12 /im and stained for fat with Oil Red 0 (ORO).<br>
Data Analysis<br>
The post-dose food and water consumption measurements and bodyweights at each time-point for the P57-treated animals were compared with those for the relevant, similarly-treated vehicle control group using analysis of variance followed by Williams" test for comparisons with controls.<br>
The data for the fenfluramine-treated animals was compared with that for the vehicle-treated control group using Student"s t test.<br>
Results<br>
The results are summarised in the tables.<br>
Sample 1 {pure sap) administered orally produced marked, dose-related reductions in daily food consumption. The duration and amplitude of these reductions in food consumption were dose-dependent. At 24 hours post-dose, Sample 1 (pure sap} produced statistically significant reductions in food consumption at doses of 160 0 mg/kg and above when compared with vehicle-treated controls. The highest dose of Sample 1 (sap) (10000 mg/kg} produced statistically significant reductions in food consumption on a daily basis up to 5 days post-dose.<br>
Sample 2 (spray-dried sap) and Sample 3 (active moiety} produced marked and statistically significant reductions in food consumption at oral doses of 76 and 5.0 mg/kg respectively. In both cases the effects lasted 4 8 hours post-dose.<br><br>
The reference standard,  fenfluramine  (7.5 mq/kg,     p.o.) produced  statistically  significant  reductions  in  food consumption at 6 and 24 hours post-dose when compared with the relevant vehicle-treated control group (Group 12).<br>
Sample 2 (spray-dried sap) and Sample 3 (active moiety) produced no marked, dose-related effects on water consumption. On the day of dosing, the pure sap produced statistically significant increases in water consumption at 3 hours post-dose (6400 and 10000 mg/kg) and 6 hours post-dose (10 000 mg/kg). Two days after dosing however, statistically significant decreases in water consumption were recorded in animals receiving Sample 1 (sap) at 3200, 6400 and 10000 mg/kg. These reductions however, were not clearly dose-related and only occurred between 1 and 2 days post-dose. The biological significance of these effects therefore remains unclear.<br>
Sample 1 (pure sap) produced dose-related, statistically significant effects on bodyweights when compared with the vehicle-treated control group (Group 1} . When administered orally at doses of 3200 mg/kg and above. Sample 1 (pure sap) produced statistically significant reductions in bodyweight or decreased growth rates when compared with vehicle-treated animals. These effects were statistically significant from 48 hours post-dose until the end of the study.<br>
Sample 2 (spray-dried sap) administered orally at 76 mg/kg also produced statistically significant reductions in growth of the animals when compared with the vehicle-treated control group (Group 1) . These effects were statistically significant between Days 3 (48 hours post-dose) and 5 inclusive,<br>
Although Sample 3 (active moiety) appeared to delay the growth of the animals at the highest dose (5.0 mg/kg) when compared with the relevant vehicle-treated control group<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Histopatholocfv Report<br>
Histological examination was restricted to the liver.  No treatment-related  changes  were  detected  for  Sample  1 (liquid),  Sample 2  (spray-dried sap) ,  Sample 3  (active moiety), fenfluramine or the DMSO control group.<br>
The  findings recorded were of a similar incidence in control and treated groups.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 45<br>
A further bioassay, which employed the same test samples as described in Example 44, is described below. Animals in this study received a restricted diet i.e. animals only received food between 12:00 and 3:00pm daily. This is different from all other biological assays conducted thus far, whereby food was available to the rats a t lib. Animals were acclimatised over a seven day period (days -7 to -1), dosing took place from day 0 to day 6 at 9:00am by oral gavage. The recovery period was from days 7 to day 13. Dosage groups are described in Table 1 below. It should be noted that the actual control group is labelled Group 0 9. Group 5 is a controlled group which received a diet equivalent to that of Group 4. The purpose of this group was to evaluate the effect a restricted diet has on the lives of the animals.<br>
Results<br>
The results generated during the study showed that the acclimatization period was too short. Rats feed mainly during the night and the sudden change to a restricted access to feed for 3 hours during day-time, resulted in low daily intakes. The daily intake of feed was still increasing in most groups at the end of the acclimatization period when dosing with the test items started. As a result of this, the effect of the test materials did not significantly affect the food intake of the rats during the period of dosing.<br>
The mean body masses for the different groups for day -7 to -1 and days 0 to 6 are shown in the Table Dl and Table D2. The effect of the different dosages of the sap and spray-dried sap is shown in the accompanying graphs as % change in body mass day 0 to 7 (Figure 5), and % change in body mass day -7 to 7 (Figure 6). The loss in body mass is clearly dose-related especially with the higher dosages.<br><br>
The histopathological examination of the livers did not show any significant pathology in the groups receiving the test items.<br>
Food<br>
Food consumption was measured daily, during acclimatization and during the study. Food was available for a 3 hour feeding period daily, starting at 12:00 and ending at 15:00. The animals were fasted for the remainder of the time. Animals in Group 5 received a measured quantity food on Day 1, equivalent to the average food consumption of Group 4 on Day 0. This controlled feeding pattern for Group 5, as determined from the average food consumption of Group 4 from the previous day, was followed for Days 1-7.<br>
Water<br>
Water was provided in standard containers. Water (Magalies Hater Board Tap Water, suitable for human consumption) was available ad libitum. Water consumption was measured once daily, at the same time each day, after food consumption determination.<br>
Acclimatization<br>
The animals were acclimatized for seven days before the start of the study, during which time food and water consumption were determined as described above. The body masses were determined on a daily basis during this time.<br><br><br>
Route of Administration<br>
The test items were administered on a daily basis for seven days, using an intra-gastric needle, Animals were fasted for 18 hours prior to the item administration (starting at 09:00) .<br>
Duration of Treatment<br>
Animals were treated for seven consecutive days (from Day 0 - Day 6). Three animals of each group were sacrificed 24 hours after the last dosing (Day 7). The remaining three animals were sacrificed 7 days after the last treatment [Day 13). This procedure was followed for all the groups except for Group 5 where three animals were sacrificed 24 hours after the last controlled feeding (Day 8), the remaining three animals were sacrificed 7 days after the last treatment (Day 13).<br><br>
Body Masses<br>
Body masses were determined daily, at approximately the same time each day for the duration of the study, including during the acclimatization period.<br>
Euthanasia<br>
Three animals of each group were sacrificed 24 hours after the last dosing (Day 7).<br>
The remaining three animals were sacrificed 7 days after the last treatment. This procedure was followed for all the groups except for Group 5 where three animals were sacrificed 24 hours after the last controlled feeding (Day 8}, the remaining three animals were sacrificed 7 Days after the last treatment (Day 13) . The animals were euthanased at the end of the study period with CO2 gas.<br>
Ophthalmoscopic Examinations<br>
Ophthalmoscopic examinations, using an ophthalmoscope, were done prior to the first adminstration of the test item and at termination, in all animals in all groups,<br>
Macroscopic Patholocfy<br>
A full post mortem examination was performed on every animal which was euthanased at the end of the study period.<br>
Histopatholocfy<br>
Histopathological examination was performed on the liver of each of the animals.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
No specific lesions were recorded in the liver sections from the experimental rats which received the frozen sap as well as the spray-dried sap that could be attributed to the oral adminstration of the abovementioned chemicals. The hydropic cell swelling recorded in both control and experimental rats may indicate normal metabolic cell swelling and anoxic changes. Minimal foci of lymphocytic perivascular cuffing were found in some animals and is most likely an incidental observation. In a few rats congestion of mild degree is present in the hepatic sinusoids and should be regarded as an incidental observation.<br>
An important feature of the invention shown by the results of this study is that no tolerance to any of the samples developed over the test period, This may provide considerable benefit, particularly in relation to the use of the compounds and compositions of the invention in the treatment of obesity.<br>
While the compounds and compositions of the invention have primarily been described in relation to their properties as appetite suppressants, it should be noted that this expression - "appetite suppressant" - is used herein to denote activity which tends to limit appetite and/or increase the sense of satiety, and thus tends to reduce total calorific intake; this in turn tends to counteract obesity. Accordingly, this invention extends to a method of treating, preventing or combating obesity in a human or non-human animal which comprises administering to said human or non-human animal an obesity treating, preventing or combating amount of a compound of formula (2). A preferred embodiment of this aspect of the invention utilises a composition or extract containing a compound of formula (1).<br>
The term "animal" as used herein extends to, but is not restricted to, companion animals, e.g. household pets and domesticated  animals;    non-limiting  examples  of  such<br><br>
animals include cattle, sheep, ferrets, swine, camels, horses, poultry, fish, rabbits, goats, dogs and cats.<br>
As an anorectic agent or in the treatment or prevention of obesity in a human, a compound of formula (2), preferably of formula (1), or the composition defined in any one of claims 9 and 25 - 31 hereafter, is advantageously administered to said human in a dosage amount of from about 0.01 mg/kg/day to about 10 mg/kg/day. A preferred dosage range is 0.05 mg/Kg/day to 0.5 mg/kg/day. When using the spray dried powder form of the extract of this invention, a preferred dosage range is 0.1 mg/kg/day to 20 mg/kg/day; especially preferjred is 0.5 mg/kg/day to 5 mg/kg/day.<br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:	<br>
1.	A process for preparing an extract of a plant of the genus Trichocaulon or of the genus Hoodia, the extract comprising an appetite suppressant agent, the process including the steps of treating plant material with a solvent to extract a fraction having appetite suppressant activity, separating the extraction solution from the rest of the plant material, removing the solvent from the extraction solution and recovering the extract.<br>
2.	The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the process includes the steps of pressing plant material to separate sap from solid plant material and recovering the sap free of the solid plant material to form the extract.<br>
3.	The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the plant of the genus Trichocaulon is selected from the species Trichocaulon piliferum and Trichocaulon officinate and the plant of the genus Hoodia is selected from the species Hoodia currorii, Hoodia gordonii and Hoodia lugardii.<br>
4.	The process as claimed m claim 3, wherein the plant is selected from the species Hoodia currorii. Hoodia gordonii and Hoodia lugardii.<br>
5.	The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, which includes the step of concentrating the active agent in the extracted material by further extraction with a solvent.<br>
6.	The process as claimed in any one of claims 1, 3 to 5, wherein the solvent in the solvent extraction step or steps is one or more of methylene chloride, water, methanol, hexane, ethyl acetate or mixtures thereof<br><br>
7.	The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the active agent is concentrated in the extracted material by chromatographic separation.<br>
