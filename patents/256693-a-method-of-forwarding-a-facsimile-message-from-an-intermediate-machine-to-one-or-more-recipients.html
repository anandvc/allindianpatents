				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of network communications. More specifically, the present invention relates to the field of facsimile services and describes a method and a system for sending and receiving facsimile messages over a public switched telephone network (PSTN) and/or Internet Protocol (IP) network.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
In the field of facsimile services, facsimile messages have become an important way of communicating within and across networks. Exact copies of documents can be sent over PSTN and/or IP network as facsimile messages. The communication can be easily established using affordable machines, namely, facsimile machines or Multi-Functional Peripherals (MFPs).<br>
Presently in the art, facsimile messages are sent or received via the facsimile machines or the MFPs. A sender has to individually send a facsimile message to all intended recipients.<br>
Further in a local network, where a common facsimile machine is installed for receiving facsimile messages for all the recipients, the recipients may be provided with a facility to store all the facsimile messages intended for them in separate mailboxes. The facsimile messages are stored in the memory of the common facsimile machine. The recipients may get their respective facsimile messages printed in their presence.<br>
However, in the current state of art, a sender does not have the facility of sending facsimile messages to a single recipient, wherefrom the messages can be forwarded to a list of intended recipients provided by the sender. This would considerably reduce the cost for the sender as the sender may then send the facsimile message to a single recipient, especially in case the facsimile message<br><br>
has to be sent over a long distance telephone call. Further, there is no concept of obtaining an approval from the single recipient before forwarding the messages to the list of intended recipients.<br>
In the light of the foregoing, there is a need for a method and a system for enabling the sender to send facsimile messages to a single intermediate recipient that forwards the messages to the list of intended recipients. Further, there is a need for a method and a system for enabling the single intermediate recipient to grant approval to the list of intended recipients before forwarding the facsimile to the intended recipients, and/or modify the list of intended recipients accordingly.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The shortcomings set forth above are eliminated by the present invention, which is a method for transmitting a facsimile message from a sender to one or more recipients via an intermediate machine. The intermediate machine is capable of receiving facsimile messages from the sender and forwarding the facsimile message to the one or more recipients.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a method for automatically forwarding the facsimile message received by the intermediate machine. No manual intervention is required to automatically forward the facsimile message to the one or more recipients.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a method that enables a user at the intermediate machine to select an option for forwarding the facsimile message only on receiving approval from the user.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide a method for the user to modify a list of the one or more recipients provided by the sender before forwarding the facsimile message to the one or more recipients.<br><br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a method for cancelling the forwarding of the facsimile message to the one or more recipients.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a method for permanently preventing the forwarding of facsimile messages received by the intermediate machine.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the invention is directed to a method for transmitting the facsimile message from the sender to the one or more recipients via the intermediate machine. The method comprises attaching a list of the one or more recipients to whom the facsimile message is to be forwarded, the list being attached by the sender. Further, the method comprises identification of the facsimile message to be forwarded as a message distinct from a simple message. The facsimile message may be either forwarded automatically depending on the option pre-selected by a user at the intermediate machine or be forwarded only after receiving an approval from the user. In addition, the user may modify the list of the one or more recipients before granting the approval. Further, the user has an option to obtain a full view of the facsimile message before granting the approval. The user may permanently prevent the forwarding of the facsimile message received by the intermediate machine.<br>
An advantage of the present invention is that it provides an option to transmit a facsimile message at a single facsimile number, the facsimile number being of an intermediate machine, wherefrom the facsimile message is forwarded to one or more recipients.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is that it provides a method to enable the user to grant an approval before forwarding the facsimile message to the one or more recipients. Further, the method enables the user to modify the list of the one or more recipients for forwarding the facsimile message.<br><br>
The present invention provides a method for transmitting a facsimile message from a sender to one or more recipients via an intermediate machine, the intermediate machine being a machine capable of receiving the facsimile message from the sender and forwarding the facsimile message to the one or more recipients, the method comprising the steps of:<br>
a.	attaching a list of the one or more recipients to the facsimile<br>
message, the list of the one or more recipients being attached by the<br>
sender;<br>
b.	sending the facsimile message to the intermediate machine by the<br>
sender;<br>
c.	extracting the list of the one or more recipients from the facsimile<br>
message by the intermediate machine; and<br>
d.	forwarding the facsimile message to the one or more recipients by<br>
the intermediate machine;<br>
and the method optionally comprising the step of either:<br>
e.	enabling a user to select an option at the intermediate machine to<br>
either approve or cancel forwarding the facsimile message by the<br>
intermediate machine to the one or more recipients; or<br>
f.	enabling a user to permanently prevent forwarding of all facsimile<br>
messages received by the intermediate machine.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
For the sake of convenience, the terms used to describe various embodiments are described below. It should be understood that these are provided to merely aid the understanding of the description, and that definitions in no way limit the scope of the invention.<br><br>
T.30 Protocol: T.30 Protocol is a handshake protocol. This protocol describes the overall procedure for establishing and managing communication between two facsimile machines for sending and receiving a facsimile message. The T.30 Protocol defines five phases describing the procedural steps for sending and receiving the facsimile message. The first phase comprises establishing a call between the two facsimile machines for transmission of the facsimile message. The second phase, a pre message procedure, describes selection of a communication mode for the transmission of the facsimile message. The third phase describes a message transmission procedure, which comprises phasing and synchronization techniques between the two facsimile machines. The fourth phase, a post messgge procedure, describes a procedure to confirm the receipt of the facsimile message at the end of the facsimile message transmission. The fifth phase is a call release procedure, which describes disconnection of the call established between the two facsimile machines.<br>
Internet facsimile message: An Internet facsimile message is sent over an Internet Protocol (IP) network. An email is sent to the facsimile service provider, wherefrom the email is translated to a facsimile message and is sent to intended facsimile machines.<br>
Figure 1 is a block diagram depicting the environment of the invention, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The environment depicts a sender 102 sending a facsimile message to one or more recipients 104 via an intermediate machine 106. Sender 102 sends the facsimile message to intermediate machine 106 over a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) or an Internet Protocol (IP) network 108. Intermediate machine 106, after receiving the facsimile message from sender 102, provides options to a user at intermediate machine 106 for further forwarding the facsimile message to one or more recipients 104.<br>
Sender 102 attaches facsimile information along with the facsimile message. In an embodiment of the invention, the facsimile information comprises a facsimile<br><br>
number of sender 102 and headline of the facsimile message. In addition, an identifier is attached with the facsimile message that allows the identification of simple facsimile messages as distinct from facsimile messages to be forwarded to one or more recipients 104. In case, the facsimile message is not a simple facsimile message, an additional list of the one or more recipients is attached by sender 102. The list comprises facsimile numbers of one or more recipients 104. Sender 102 attaches the facsimile information by embedding the facsimile information in a non-standard facility of T.30 protocol.<br>
Sender 102 sends the facsimile message with the attached facsimile information to intermediate machine 106. The facsimile message may be sent over Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) or Internet Protocol (IP) network 108. Intermediate machine 106 extracts the facsimile information from the non-standard facility of T.30 protocol. Further, intermediate machine 106 extracts the identifier to identify the facsimile message as a simple facsimile message. If the identifier identifies the facsimile message as a simple facsimile message, the facsimile message is treated as a normal facsimile message and a hardcopy of the facsimile message may be obtained by a user at intermediate machine 106. However, the simple facsimile message cannot be forwarded to other recipients. If the identifier identifies the facsimile message to be distinct from a simple facsimile message, the facsimile message is to be forwarded to one or more recipients 104. Intermediate machine 106 extracts the list of one or more recipients 104 from the facsimile information of the facsimile message.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the user at intermediate machine 106 may customize intermediate machine 106 by pre-selecting options provided by intermediate machine 106. Intermediate machine 106 provides an option for automatic forwarding of any facsimile message received by intermediate machine 106 to one or more recipients 104 without obtaining an approval from the user. No manual intervention is required after selecting the option for automatic forwarding of the facsimile message.<br><br>
In another embodiment of the invention, intermediate machine 106 allows the user to select an option.to obtain an approval from the user before forwarding the facsimile message to one or more recipients 104. The user may obtain a full view of the facsimile message before granting an approval to the facsimile message. The full view of the facsimile message may be obtained in the form of a hardcopy or displayed on a screen of intermediate machine 106. Further, the user may view the list of one or more recipients 104. The user may modify the list of one or more recipients 104 provided by sender 102. The user may add new recipients to the list as well as delete already present recipients from the list of one or more recipients 104. The list of one or more recipients 104 is updated accordingly.<br>
Intermediate machine 106 sends the facsimile message to the updated list of one or more recipients 104. The facsimile message may be transmitted over PSTN or IP network 108.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the user is provided an option to disapprove the forwarding of the facsimile message to any of one or more recipients 104. The facsimile message is then deleted from intermediate machine 106.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the facsimile message is deleted from intermediate machine 106 if the user does not approve the facsimile message within a specified period of time.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, intermediate machine 106 enables the user to permanently cancel the forwarding of any facsimile message received by intermediate machine 106. All the facsimile messages received by intermediate machine 106 will not be forwarded. However, hardcopies of the facsimile messages may be obtained by the user at intermediate machine 106. One or more recipients 104 receive the facsimile message sent to them by intermediate machine 106 over PSTN or IP network 108.<br><br>
Figure 2 is a flowchart illustrating a method for transmitting a facsimile message from a sender to one or more recipients, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. At step 202, a list of the one or more recipients is attached by the sender along with the facsimile message. The list of the one or more recipients contains facsimile numbers of the one or more recipients. At step 204, the facsimile message is sent by the sender to the intermediate machine. At step 206, the list of the one or more recipients is extracted from the facsimile message by the intermediate machine. At step 208, the facsimile message is forwarded to the one or more recipients by the intermediate machine.<br>
Figure 3 is a flowchart illustrating a method for setting up the configuration at intermediate machine for transmitting a facsimile message from a sender to one or more recipients, in accordance with another embodiment of the invention. At step 302, a user at the intermediate machine is enabled to select an option to approve or cancel the forwarding of the facsimile message to the one or more recipients. At step 304, a user at the intermediate machine can select to never forward from this machine. In such cases all facsimile messages received with forward request would be treated as simple facsimile. All these facsimile messages would be printed at intermediate machine. At step 306, a user at the intermediate machine can select always forward option. In such cases all facsimile messages with forward request would be forward automatically to attach list of facsimile numbers without interruption from the user. At step 306, a user can setup intermediate machine to Approve and Forward option. In such cases all facsimile message would be forwarded only if user has approved the received facsimile message. User can chose to approve, cancel or approve with modification in receiver list.<br>
Figures 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d and 4e illustrate a flowchart of a method for transmitting a facsimile message from a sender to one or more recipients, in accordance with yet another embodiment of the invention. At step 402, a list of the one or more recipients is attached along with the facsimile message by the sender. The list of the one or more recipients is embedded in a non-standard facility of T.30 protocol.<br><br>
Along with this, facsimile information is embedded in the non-standard facility of T.30 Protocol. The facsimile information comprises, but may not be limited to, facsimile number of the sender, and headline of the facsimile message. At step 404, an identifier is attached to*the facsimile message to identify simple messages as distinct from facsimile messages sent for approval and forwarding at the intermediate machine. At step 406, the sender may opt to send the facsimile message over a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). If the sender does not opt to send the facsimile message over the PSTN, the sender may opt to send the facsimile message over Internet Protocol (IP) network, at step 408. At step 410, the facsimile message is sent to the intermediate machine. The facsimile message is transmitted to the intermediate machine over the option as chosen by the sender at steps 406 and 408. At step 412, the intermediate machine extracts the facsimile information embedded in the non-standard facility of T.30 Protocol. At step 412, the identifier attached to the facsimile message is extracted by the intermediate machine. At step 414, it is identified whether the facsimile message is a simple facsimile message or not. The identification is done with the help of the identifier attached with the facsimile message. In case, the facsimile message is not the simple facsimile message as identified at step 414, the list of one or more recipients of the facsimile is extracted by the intermediate machine, at step 416. Further, an option is provided to the user to automatically forward the facsimile message received by the intermediate machine at step 418. The facsimile messages received by the intermediate machine are automatically forwarded to the list of the one or more recipients provided by the sender in the facsimile message. The facsimile numbers of the one or more recipients are extracted by the intermediate machine from the non-standard facility of T.30 Protocol. At step 420, the user may apt to transmit the facsimile message over the PSTN network. In case, the user does not choose to transmit the facsimile message over the PSTN network at step 420, the user may opt to transmit the facsimile message over the IP network at step 422. At step 424, the facsimile message is automatically sent to the one or more recipients. No manual intervention is required to transmit the facsimile message. The transmission may be carried over any of the two choices made by the user at steps 420 and 422. In case, the user<br><br>
does not select the option to automatically forward the facsimile message received by the intermediate machine at step 418, the user is provided another option to obtain an approval from the user at the intermediate machine before forwarding the facsimile message to the one or more recipients at step 426. At step 428, the user may obtain a full view of the facsimile message before granting approval for forwarding the facsimile message. The full view of the facsimile message may be in the form of a hardcopy. At step 430, the user is able to obtain the list of the one or more recipients extracted by the intermediate machine. At step 432, the list of the one or more recipients may be modified by the user. A new recipient may be added to the list of the one or more recipient or an already existing recipient among the one or more recipient may be deleted by the user. The list of the one or more recipient is updated accordingly. The facsimile message may be transmitted to the one or more recipients over the PSTN, the option being provided at step 420. Further, the facsimile message may be transmitted over the IP network, the option being provided at step 422. At step 424, the facsimile message is sent to the one or more recipients. In case, the option for obtaining an approval before forwarding the facsimile message is not selected at step 426, an option to cancel the forwarding of the facsimile message received by the intermediate machine is provided at step 434. In case, the user cancels the forwarding of the facsimile message, the facsimile message is deleted from the intermediate machine at step 436. In case, the user does not cancel the forwarding of the facsimile message at step 434, it is checked whether the facsimile message has not received approval within a specified time period. In case the user does not approve forwarding the facsimile message within the specified time period, the facsimile message is deleted at step 436. In case, the time period has still not exceeded the specified time period, the user still has the option to approve the facsimile message to forward it to the one or more recipients at step 426.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the<br><br>
accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
