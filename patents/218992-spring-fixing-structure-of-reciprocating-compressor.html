[1]	The present invention relates to a reciprocating compressor, and more partkularly,<br>
to a spring fixing structure of a reciprocating compressor capable of easily and<br>
precisely fixing a resonant spring for causing a resonant movement of a piston and<br>
capable of facilitating an assembly work by a precise assembly tolerance.<br>
Background  Art<br>
[2]	Generally, a compressor converts an electric energy into a kinetic energy, and<br>
compresses a refrigerant by the kinetic energy. The compressor is a core factor con-<br>
stituting a refrigerating cjcle system, and is divided into a rotary compressor, a scroll<br>
compressor, a reciprocating compressor, and etc. according to a compression<br>
mechanism for compressing a refrigerant<br>
[3]	Figure 1 is a sectional view showing one embodiment of a reciprocating<br>
compressor.<br>
[4]	As shown, the reciprocating compressor comprises: a casing 100 provided with a<br>
gas siction pipe 110 and a discharge pipe 120; a frame unit 200 disposed inside the<br>
casing 100; a driving motor 300 mounted at the frame unit 200 for generating a linear<br>
reciprocation force; a compression unit 400 for compressing gas by receiving the<br>
driving force of the driving motor 300; and a resonant spring unit 500 for resonating<br>
the driving force of the driving motor 300.<br>
[5]	The frame unit 200 includes: a front frame 210 accommodating the compression<br>
unit 400 therein; a middle frame 220 coupled to the front frame 210; and a rear frame<br>
230 for fixing the driving motor 300 with the middle frame 220.<br>
[6]	The driving motor 300 includes: an outer stator 310 fixed between the middle frame<br>
220 and the rear frame 230; an inner stator 320 inserted into the outer stator 310 and<br>
fixedly coupled to the rear frame 230; a mover 330 movably inserted between the outer<br>
stator 310 and the inner stator 320; and a winding coil 340 coupled to inside of the<br>
outer stator 310. The mover 330 is composed of a magnet 331, and a magnet holder<br>
332 for supporting the magnet 331.<br>
[7]	The compression unit 400 includes: a cylinder 410 fixedly coupled to the front<br>
frame 210; a piston 420 of which one side is movably inserted into an inner space of<br>
the cylinder 410 and another side is fixedly coupled to the mover 330; a discharge<br><br>
WO 2004/081421	2	PCT/KR2004/000507<br>
valve assembly 430 mounted at one side of the cylinder 410 for controlling a discharge<br>
of a refrigerant; and a suction valve 440 mounted at the end of the piston 420 for<br>
controlling a flow of a refrigerant introduced into the inner space of the cylinder 410.<br>
The discharge valve assembly 430includes: a discharge cover 431 for covering the<br>
inner space of the cylinder 410; a discharge valve 432 inserted into the discharge cover<br>
431 for opening and closing the inner space of the cylinder 410; and a discharge spring<br>
433 inserted into the discharge cover 431 for elastially supporting the discharge valve<br>
432.<br>
[8]	The resonant spring unit 500 includes: a spring supporter 510 fixedly coupled to the<br>
mover 330; a front coil spring 520 disposed between one side surface of the spring<br>
supporter 510 and an inner side surface of the front frame 210; and a rear coil spring<br>
530 disposed between another side surface of the spring supporter 510 and one side<br>
surface of the middle frame 220. The front coil spring 520 and the rear coil spring 530<br>
constitute the resonant spring.<br>
[9]	Operation of the reciprocating compressor will be explained as follows.<br>
[10]	When a power is supplied to the reciprocating compressor, a linear reciprccation<br>
force is generated by an electromagnetic interaction of the driving motor 300. The<br>
linear reciprccation force is transmitted to the piston 420 through the mover 330.<br>
[11]	The piston 420 is linearly-reciprccated in the inner space of the cylinder 410, by the<br>
linear reciprccation of the piston 420 and a pressure difference, the suction valve 440<br>
and the discharge valve 432 are operated thus to suck a refrigerant into the inner space<br>
of the cylinder 410, compress, and discharge. The discharged refrigerant inside the<br>
compression space is exhausted outside the compressor through the discharge cover<br>
431 and the discharge pipe 120.<br>
[12]	The front coil spring 520 and the rear coil spring 530 respectively disposed at both<br>
sides of the piston 420 are contracted and relaxed according to the reciprccation of the<br>
piston 420, thereby elastically supporting the piston 420. The front coil spring 520 and<br>
the rear coil spring 530 cause the resonant movement of the mover 330 and the piston<br>
420.<br>
[13]	Said reciprocating compressor is fabricated through a series of assembly processes<br>
in a production line. At the time of the assembly processes, an assembly structure and<br>
an assembly work of components have to be simplified and facilitated in order to<br>
reduce the number of the assembly processes and to obtain more precise assembly<br>
dimension.<br>
[14]	Figure 2 is a sectional view showing a fixing structure of the resonant spring con-<br><br>
WO 2004/081421	3	PCT/KR2004/000507<br>
stituting the reciprocating compressor.<br>
[15]	As shown, a fixing groove 521 having a certain depth and the same inner diameter<br>
as an outer diameter of the front coil spring 520 is formed at an inner side surface of<br>
the front frame 210. The fixing groove 521 has a right-angled edge and a*right-angled<br>
corner. A fixing protrusion 511 having a certain height and the same outer diameter as<br>
an inner diameter of the front coil spring 520 is formed at one surface of the spring<br>
supporter 510 facing the fixing groove 521 of the front frame 210, and the fixing<br>
protrusion 511 has a right-angled edge and a right-angled corner. One end portion of<br>
the front coil spring 520 is inserted into the fixing groove 211 of the front frame, and<br>
another end portion thereof is fitted into the fixing protrusion 511 of the spring<br>
supporter. An outer surface of said one end portion of the front coil spring 520 is in<br>
contact with an inner circumferential surface of the fixing groove 211, and an inner<br>
surface of said end portion of the front coil spring 520 is in contact with an outer cir-<br>
cumferential surface of the fixing protrusion 511.<br>
[16]	A fixing groove 221 having a certain depth and the same inner diameter as an outer<br>
diameter of the rear coil spring 530 is formed at one surface of the middle frame 220,<br>
and the fixing groove 221 has a right-angled edge and a right-angled corner. A fixing<br>
protrusion 512 having a certain height and the same outer diameter as an inner<br>
diameter of the rear coil spring 530 is formed at one surface of the spring supporter<br>
510 facing the fixing groove 221 of the middle frame 220, and the fixing protrusion<br>
512 has a right-angled edge and a right-angled corner. One end portion of the rear coil<br>
spring 530 is inserted into the fixing groove 221 of the middle frame, and another end<br>
portion thereof is fitted into the fixing protrusion 512 of the spring supporter. An outer<br>
surface of said one end portion of the rear coil spring 530 is in contact with an inner<br>
circumferential surface of the fixing groove 221, and an inner surface of said end<br>
portion of the rear coil spring 530 is in contact with an outer circumferential surface of<br>
the fixing protrusion 512.<br>
[17]	A plurality of fixing grooves 211 and 221 are respectively formed at the front frame<br>
210 and the middle frame 220, and the fixing protrusions 511 and 512 corresponding<br>
to the fixing grooves 211 and 221 are formed at the spring supporter 510. A plurality<br>
of the front coil springs 520 and the rear coil springs 530 are respectively coupled to<br>
the fixing grooves 211 and 221 and the fixing protrusions 511 and 512. The front coil<br>
spring 520 and the rear coil spring 530 have the same size and shape.<br>
[18]	Since assembly tolerances of the piston 420 and the mover 330 are determined<br>
according to assembly tolerances of the front coil spring 520 and the rear coil spring<br><br>
WO 2004/081421	4	PCT/KR2004/000507<br>
530, assembly dimensions between the front and rear coil springs 520 and 530 and the<br>
fixing grooves 211 and 221, and between the front and rear coil springs 520 and 530<br>
and the fixing protrusions 511 and 512 have to be precisely maintained.<br>
£19]	In case that the inner diameters of the fixing grooves 211 and 221 are larger than<br>
the outer diameters of the front and rear coil springs 520 and 530 or the outer<br>
diameters of the fixing protrusions 511 and 512 are smaller than the inner diameters of<br>
the front and rear coil springs 520 and 530, movement widths of the piston 420 and the<br>
mover 330 connected to the spring supporter 510 in the circumference direction are<br>
great at the time of the compressor operation. According to this, a fictional contact is<br>
generated between the piston 420 and the cylinder 410 and between the mover 330 and<br>
the outer stator 310/ the inner stator 320 requiring a minute assembly tolerance,<br>
thereby lowering a compression function and causing a component damage.<br>
[20]	R&gt;wever, in the resonant spring unit fixing structure, it is complicated to fix the<br>
front and rear coil springs precisely and it is difficult to assemble the components.<br>
[21]	The reason is because the assembly tolerances between the front/rear coil springs<br>
and the counterpart components become minute, the outer diameters of the front/rear<br>
coil springs 520/530 are same as the outer diameters of entrance sides of the fixing<br>
grooves 211/221 to which the front/rear coil springs 520/530 are coupled, and the inner<br>
diameters of the front/rear coil springs 520/530 are same as the outer diameters of<br>
entrance sides of the fixing protrusions 511/512. According to this, an assembly pro-<br>
ductivity of the compressor is greatly lowered.<br>
Disclosure<br>
[22]	Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a spring fixing structure<br>
capable of easily and precisely fixing a resonant spring for causing a resonant<br>
movement of a piston and capable of facilitating an assembly work by a precise<br>
assembly tolerance.<br>
[23]	To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the<br>
present invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, there is provided a spring<br>
fixing structure of a reciprocating compressor comprising: a frame unit disposed inside<br>
a casing; a driving motor mounted at the frame unit for generating a linear re-<br>
ciprocation force; a cylinder fixedly coupled to the frame unit; a piston connected to a<br>
mover of the driving motor and linearly-reciprocated in the cylinder by receiving the<br>
driving force of the driving motor; and a resonant spring mounted between the mover<br>
or a spring supporter coupled to the mover and the frame unit for causing resonant<br>
movements of the mover and the piston, in the reciprocating compressor, a spring<br><br>
WO 2004/081421	5	PCT/KR2004/000507<br>
fixing portion having an inclination surface at an entrance side thereof is provided at<br>
the frame unit and the mover to which both end portions of the resonant spring are<br>
fixed or at the frame unit and a spring supporter coupled to the mover, and an end<br>
portion of the resonant spring is coupled to the spring fixing portion.<br>
[24]	The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present<br>
invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>

Mode   for   Invention<br>
[30]	Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, examples of which are illustrated in the acoompanjing drawings.<br>
[31]	Figure 3 is a front view showing a reciprocating compressor provided with one<br>
embodiment of a spring fixing structure of a reciprocating compressor according to the<br>
present invention. The same numerals were given to the same parts as those of the con-<br>
ventional art.<br>
[32]	As shown, the reciprocating compressor comprises: a casing 100 provided with a<br>
gas suction pipe 110 and a discharge pipe 120; a frame unit 200 disposed inside the<br>
casing 100; a driving motor 300 mounted at the frame unit 200 for generating a linear<br>
reciprocation force; a compression unit 400 for compressing gas by receiving the<br>

compressor according to the conventional art, thereby omitting explanations for the<br><br>
WO 2004/081421	6	PCT/KR2004/000507<br>
same construction. A resonant spring fixing stricture constituting the resonant spring<br>
unit 500 will be explained as follows.<br>
[33]	The resonant spring unit 500 is composed of a spring supporter 510 fixedly coupled<br>
to the mover 330 thus to move with the mover 330, and a resonant spring for<br>
elastically supporting the spring supporter 510. The spring supporter 510 is formed as<br>
a predetermined shape, and one side thereof is fixedly coupled to the mover 330 and<br>
another side thereof is disposed between a front frame 210 and a middle frame 220<br>
constituting the frame unit 200. The resonant spring is constituted with coil springs<br>
CS.<br>
[34]	The plurality of coil springs CS are positioned between an inner side surface of the<br>
front frame 210 and one surface of the spring supporter 510, and between another<br>
surface of the spring supporter 510 and one surface of the middle frame 510,<br>
[35]	As shown in Figure 4, a spring fixing portion SF having an inclination surface at an<br>
entrance side thereof is provided at the frame unit 210, or the middle frame 220, or the<br>
spring supporter 510 to which both end portions of the coil spring CS are fixed, and an<br>
end portion of the coil spring CS is coupled to the spring fixing portion SF. Figure 4<br>
shows a case that the coil spring CS is fixed to the middle frame 220.<br>
[36]	The spring fixing portion SF includes: a cylindrical groove 223 having a certain<br>
depth and an inner diameter corresponding to an outer diameter of the coil spring CS;<br>
and a guiding inclination surface 224 inclined with a certain inclination angle at the<br>
edge of the cylindrral groove 223 so that an inner diameter of an entrance side thereof<br>
become greater than the inner diameter of the cylindrical groove 223.<br>
[37]	The inner diameter of the inner ciraimferential surface of the cylindrral groove is<br>
constant The guiding inclination surface 224 starts from an arbitrary position of the<br>
inner ciraimferential surface of the cylindrical groove 223. The guiding inclination<br>
surface 224 has a conical shape.<br>
[38]	The coil spring CS is insertion-fixed to the cylindrical groove 223 through the<br>
guiding inclination surface 224. Since the coil spring CS is inserted into the cylindrical<br>
groove 223 by being guided by the guiding inclination surface 224 of which inner<br>
diameter is larger than the inner diameter of the cylindrical groove 223, the assembly<br>
work of the coil spring CS is simplified and facilitated.<br>
[39]	Figure 5 shows another embodiment of the resonant spring fixing structure.<br>
[40]	As shown, a spring fixing portion SF having an inclination surfxe at an entrance<br>
side thereof is provided at the frame unit 210, or the middle frame 220, or the spring<br>
supporter 510 to which both end portions of the coil spring CS are fixed, and an end<br><br>
WO 2004/081421	7	PCT/KR2004/000507<br>
portion of the coil spring CS is coupled to the spring fixing portion SF. Figure 5 shows<br>
a case that the coil spring CS is fixed to the middle frame 220.<br>
[41]	The spring fixing portion SF is formed as a conical groove 226 of whfch inner cir-<br>
cumferential surface is an inclination surface 225. An inner diameter of a bottom<br>
surface of the conical groove 226 corresponds to an outer diameter of the coil spring<br>
CS, and an inner diameter of an entrance side of the conical groove 226 is formed to be<br>
larger than the inner diameter of the bottom surface thereof. A depth of the conial<br>
groove 226 is preferably greater than a wire diameter of the coil spring CS.<br>
[42]	The coil spring CS is insertion-fixed to the conial groove 226. Since the entrance<br>
of the conical groove 226 is greater than the outer diameter of the coil spring CS and is<br>
formed as the inclination surface 225, the assembly work of the coil spring CS is<br>
simplified and facilitated.<br>
[43]	Figure 6 shows still another embodiment of the resonant spring fixing stricture.<br>
[44]	As shown, a spring fixing portion SF having an inclination surface at an entrance<br>
side thereof is provided at the frame unit 210, or the middle frame 220, or the spring<br>
supporter 510 to which both end portions of the coil spring CS are fixed, and an end<br>
portion of the coil spring CS is coupled to the spring fixing portion SF. Figure 6 shows<br>
a case that the coil spring CS is fixed to the spring supporter 510.<br>
[45]	The spring fixing portion SF is composed of a spring fixing protrusion 515<br>
protruded with a certain height and an outer diameter corresponding to the inner<br>
diameter of the coil spring CS and having a guiding inclination surface 514 inclined<br>
with a certain inclination angle at the protruded edge.<br>
[46]	The end portion of the coil spring CS is insertion-fixed to the spring fixing<br>
protrusion 515. The spring fixing protrusion 515 is disposed inside the coil spring CS,<br>
and an axial direction of the coil spring CS and an axial direction of the spring fixing<br>
protrusion are positioned on the same line or are parallel each other.<br>
[47]	The coil spring CS is guided by the guiding inclination surface 514 of which inner<br>
diameter is smaller than the inner diameter of the coil spring CS thus to be coupled to<br>
the spring fixing protrusion 515 provided with the guiding inclination surface 514,<br>
thereby having a simplified and facilitated assembly work of the coil spring CS.<br>
[48]	Figure 7 shows yet another embodiment of the resonant spring fixing structure.<br>
[49] •        As shown, a spring fixing portion SF having an inclination surface at an entrance<br>
side thereof is provided at the frame unit 210, or the middle frame 220, or the spring<br>
supporter 510 to which both end portions of the coil spring CS are fixed, and an end<br>
portion of the coil spring CS is coupled to the spring fixing portion SF. Figure 7 shows<br><br>
WO 2004/081421	8	PCT/KR2004/000507<br>
a case that the coil spring CS is fixed to the spring supporter 510.<br>
[50]	The spring fixing portion SF is composed of a spring fixing protrusion 517<br>
protruded with a certain height and an outer diameter corresponding to the inner<br>
diameter of the coil spring CS and having a guiding inclination surface 516 of a hemi-<br>
spherral shape at the protruded edge.<br>
[51]	The end portion of the coil spring CS is insertion-fixed to the spring fixing<br>
protrusion 517. The spring fixing protrusion 517 is disposed inside the coil spring CS.<br>
[52]	Since the coil spring CS is guided by the guiding inclination surface 516 of a hemi-<br>
spherical shape of which inner diameter is smaller than the inner diameter of the coil<br>
spring CS thus to be coupled to the spring fixing protrusion 517 provided with the<br>
guiding inclination surface 516, the assembly work of the coil spring CS is simplified<br>
and facilitated.<br>
[53]	A plurality of the aforementioned resonant spring fixing strictures are respectively<br>
provided at both side surfaces of the spring supporter 510, and the front frame 210 and<br>
the middle frame 220 facing said both side surfaces of the spring supporter 510.<br>
[54]	Only the spring fixing portion SF of a protrusion shape, or only the spring fixing<br>
portion SF of a groove shape, or both said spring fixing portion SF of a protrusion<br>
shape and said spring fixing portion SF of a groove shape can be formed at the spring<br>
supporter 510, the front frame 210, and the middle frame 220, respectively.<br>
[55]	The spring fixing portion SF of a protrusion shape is preferably applied to<br>
components having a relatively thin thickness, and the spring tixing portion SF of a<br>
groove shape is preferably applied to components having a relatively thick thickness.<br>
[56]	Figure 8 shows still yet another embodiment of the spring fixing stricture of a re-<br>
ciprocating compressor according to the present invention.<br>
[57]	As shown, a spring fixing protrusion 515 having a guiding inclination surface 514<br>
at an entrance side thereof is formed at the spring supporter 510, a spring fixing groove<br>
223 having a guiding inclination surface 224 at an entrance side thereof is formed at<br>
the frame unit 200 facing the spring fixing protrusion of the spring supporter 510, and<br>
both end portions of the coil spring CS constituting the resonant spring are fixedly<br>
coupled to the spring fixing protrusion 515 and the spring fixing groove 223. Figure 8<br>
shows a case that the coil spring CS is coupled between the spring supporter 510 and<br>
the middle frame 220.<br>
[58]	The spring fixing protrusion 515, as aforementioned, is extendingly-protruded at<br>
one surface of the spring supporter 510, and the outer diameter thereof is the same as<br>
the inner diameter of the coil spring CS. The guiding inclination surface 514 is formed<br><br>
WO 2004/081421	9	PCT/KR2004/000507<br>
at an edge of the protruded part.<br>
[59]	The spring fixing groove 223 is formed at one surface of the front frame 210 or the<br>
middle frame 220 facing the spring supporter S10, and the inner diameter of the spring<br>
fixing groove 223 is the same as the outer diameter of the ooil spring CS constituting<br>
the resonant spring. The guiding inclination surface 224 is formed to have a certain in-<br>
clination angle at the edge of the entrance side of the groove.<br>
[60]	One side of the coil spring CS constituting the resonant spring is fixed to the spring<br>
fixing protrusion 515 by being introduced along the guiding inclination surface 514 of<br>
the spring fixing protrusion, and another side of the coil spring CS is fixed to the<br>
spring fixing groove 223 by being introduced along the guiding inclination surface 224<br>
of the spring fixing groove 223. At this time, since both sides of the ooil spring CS are<br>
guided by the guiding inclination surface 514 of which inner diameter is smaller than<br>
that of the coil spring CS and by the guiding inclination surface 224 of which outer<br>
diameter is larger than that of the ooil spring CS thus to be coupled to the spring fixing<br>
protrusion 515 and the spring fixing groove 223, the assembly work of the resonant<br>
spring is simplified and facilitated.<br>
[61]	A reciprocating compressor can be divided into various types of which one is the<br>
aforementioned reciprocating compressor. In a reciprocating compressor that a driving<br>
motor 300 is positioned at the same direction as a piston 420 and the piston 420 is<br>
disposed inside the driving motor 300, a resonant spring is respectively disposed at<br>
both sides of the piston 420. In this case, a position that the resonant spring is fixedly-<br>
coupled is varied. The present invention can be applied to this case, too.<br>
[62]	As aforementioned, in the spring fixing structure of the redprocating compressor<br>
according to the present invention, when the resonant spring is fixedly-coupled to the<br>
spring supporter, or the front frame, or the middle frame, the resonant spring is guided<br>
by the guiding inclination surface of which inner diameter is smaller than that of the<br>
resonant spring or of which outer diameter is larger than that of the resonant spring<br>
thus to be fixedlycoupled. Therefore, the fixing and coupling work of the resonant<br>
spring is simple and easy, thereby easily assembling two components.<br>
[63]	According to this, the resonant springs are respectively coupled to the spring<br>
supporter, and the assembly that the resonant springs and the spring supporter are<br>
integrally assembled is used as one component at the time of an assembly work,<br>
thereby decreasing assembly processes.<br>
[64]	Since it is simple to set the assembly position precisely and to assemble two<br>
components, a dimension of a part to which the resonant spring is finally fixed can be<br><br>
WO 2004/081421	10	PCT/KR2004/000507<br>
'more minute and an assembly dimension with the resonant spring can be maintained<br>
more minutely. According to this, assembly dimensions of the piston ad the mover<br>
supported by the resonant spring and the spring supporter can be more minutely<br>
maintained.<br>
[65]	Since the assembly dimension of the piston can be more minutely maintained, an<br>
abrasion between the piston and the cylinder is decreased and a compression leakage is<br>
prevented thus to enhance a compression function.<br>
[66]	Also, since the assembly dimension of the mover is more minutely maintained, an<br>
abrasion between the mover and the inner/outer stators is prevented and an interval<br>
between the outer stator and the inner stator to which the mover is inserted is<br>
decreased thus to enhance a function of the driving motor.<br>
[67]	As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without departing from<br>
the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be understood that the<br>
above-described embodiments are not limited by any of the details of the foregoing de-<br>
scription, unless otherwise specified, but rather should be construed broadly within its<br>
spirit and scope as defined in the appended claims, and therefore all changes and modi-<br>
fications that fall within the metes and bounds of the claims, or equivalence of sich<br>
metes and bounds are therefore intended to be embraced by the appended claims.<br><br>
