				<td>A Powerless Helical Locking Mechanism for Door<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention belongs to mechanical driving field, relates to a locking and<br>
self-unlocking mechanism for powerless helix-driven door machines.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The helix-driven door machines are widely used, such as in various vehicle doors,<br>
shielding doors, and civil doors and so on. The helix-driven door machines usually<br>
have problems on locking and unlocking. At present, both home and abroad<br>
helix-driven door machines usually adopt various locks formed by brakes and<br>
clutches or the locks with electromagnetic, hydraulic and pneumatic driving modes<br>
for locking and unlocking. Most of the door machine locking devices mentioned<br>
above have the disadvantages of complicated mechanism and low reliability, their<br>
unlocking usually requires additional power sources,<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention is aimed to solve the defects mentioned above, put forward a<br>
simple and reliable powerless helical locking mechanism for door, to realize the<br>
locking and powerless self-unlocking of helix-driven door machine.<br>
Its technical solution is: a powerless helical locking mechanism for door, consists of a<br>
screw with variable lead angle, and a self-adaptive nut; the screw with variable lead<br>
angle is connected with the power source, and the self-adaptive nut is connected with<br>
the door; the screw slot of the screw with variable lead angle is divided into three<br>
sections: working section with the lead angle more than the friction angle, locking<br>
section with the lead angle less than the friction angle, and transition section between<br>
them; the power source can drive the screw with variable lead angle to rotate<br>
bidirectionally; the self-adaptive nut is composed by connected shaft sleeve and pin<br>
shaft and so on, the self-adaptive nut is assembled with the screw with variable lead<br>
angle into the screw kinematic pair, the pin shaft in the self-adaptive nut shall be deep<br>
into the screw slot of the screw with variable lead angle and realize the linear contact<br>
with the screw slot so that the pin shaft and screw slot with any lead angles may form<br>
the matched screw pair to realize the power and motion transfer.<br>
Its features are: ? powerless: both the locking and unlocking of door machine donâ€™t<br>
require additional power source, only the CW and CCW rotations of the screw with<br>
variable lead angle and self-adaptive nut themselves may realize the locking and<br>
self-unlocking of self-adaptive nut, thus realize the locking and powerless<br>
self-unlocking of door; high reliability: at the locking section of the screw with<br>
variable lead angle, the lead angle of screw pair is less than the friction angle as cause<br>
self-locking and thus let the screw with variable lead angle lockup the self-adaptive<br>
nut, that is, securely lockup the door, no unlock problems are caused by vibration etc.;<br>
while the power source drives the CW and CCW rotations of the screw with variable<br>
lead angle, it also drives the self-adaptive nut and door to move synchronously in<br>
WO 2008/046278 PCT/CN2007/00701<br>
3<br>
parallel with the axis of the screw with variable lead angle, with the self-adaptive nut<br>
entering and exiting the locking section of the screw with variable lead angle to<br>
realize the lock and powerless self-unlock of door machine. ?simple: the door lock<br>
mechanism has less parts and simple structure. The present invention is suitable for<br>
various helix-driven door machine locks.<br>
Working Principle of the present invention:<br>
?? When the power source closes the door, the screw with variable lead angle makes<br>
the CW rotation and drives the self-adaptive nut to move from its working section<br>
to its locking section, once the self-adaptive nut enters the locking section of the<br>
screw with variable lead angle, the close of the door is realized, and then the<br>
automatic locking of the door is realized;<br>
?? When the power source opens the door, the screw with variable lead angle makes<br>
the CCW rotation and drives the self-adaptive nut to move from its locking<br>
section to its working section, once the self-adaptive nut withdraws from the<br>
locking section of the screw with variable lead angle, the automatic unlock of<br>
door is realized, then the open of the door is realized;<br>
?? When close the door with hands, the difference from closing the door with power<br>
source is that the self-adaptive nut may drive the screw with variable lead angle<br>
to rotate and let the self-adaptive nut enter the locking section of the screw with<br>
variable lead angle to realize the automatic locking of the door and fulfill the<br>
close of the door;<br>
?? When open the door with hands, just design a device to let the screw with<br>
variable lead angle make the CCW rotation of a specific angle, the self-adaptive<br>
nut withdraws from the locking section of the screw with variable lead angle and<br>
unlocking is realized, then the open of the door is realized by the CCW motion of<br>
self-adaptive nut, the shift lever, gear, clutch unlocking devices and many other<br>
devices may be applied for this purpose<br>

are connected in rigid connection or rotary connection, when the pin shaft 5 and<br>
spindle sleeve 7 are in rigid connection, the screw pair is in sliding friction; when the<br>
pin shaft 5 and spindle sleeve 7 are in rotary connection, the screw pair is in rolling<br>
friction.<br>
When the power source 11 closes the door, the screw with variable lead angle 1 makes<br>
CW rotation to drive the self-adaptive nut 19 to move from the working section of the<br>
screw with variable lead angle to locking section, until the self-adaptive nut 19 enters<br>
the locking section and the door is locked. When the power source 11 opens the door,<br>
the screw with variable lead angle 1 makes CCW rotation to drive the self-adaptive<br>
nut 19 to leave the locking section and move reversely to open the door. When<br>
manually closes the door, the movement of self-adaptive nut 19 drives the screw with<br>
variable lead angle 1 to make CW rotation, let the self-adaptive nut 19 enter the<br>
locking section of the screw with variable lead angle to manually close the door and<br>
lock the door.<br>
The manual open of the door is shown in Fig. 5. The right shift lever 14 is connected<br>
with nut 2 of self-adaptive nut 19 through the right connecting plate 15; the left shift<br>
