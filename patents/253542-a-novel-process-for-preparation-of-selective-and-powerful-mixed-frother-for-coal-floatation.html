				<td>FIELD OF APPLICATION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparation of a selective and<br>
powerful mixed frother for coal floatation. In particular, it relates to a process<br>
for screening frothing molecules for coal floatation under scientific guidelines, for<br>
coal benefication.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The separation of fine particles of coal contained in coal slurry through the use of<br>
froth floatation processes is well known. Froth floatation processes involve<br>
introducing air into the coal slurry. The hydrophobic particles of coal are<br>
contacted with finely disseminated air bubbles such that the fine air bubbles<br>
become adhered to the hydrophobic coal particles. The particles carrying<br>
bubbles are then permitted to rise, forming froth on the surface of the slurry.<br>
The froth, containing the hydrophobic particles of coal, is skimmed from the<br>
surface of the coal slurry and collected, while rejecting any hydrophilic particles<br>
of impurities which do not adhere to the air bubbles and which remain<br>
suspended in the slurry.<br><br>
Floatation of coal fines has become Increasingly important as a separation and<br>
cleaning process where there is a lowering in both the particle size and grade of<br>
the coal being recovered from mining operations. The ability to remove the coal<br>
fines from coal washery or tailings is also advantageous in order to recover coal<br>
fines missed by other techniques of coal recovery.<br>
In order to improve the selectivity and recovery of the floatation process and<br>
enhance floating of the coal fines, various types of reagent have been developed<br>
for addition to the slurry. Frothers and collectors are two types of reagents<br>
which are commonly used in coal floatation.<br>
Floatation frothers are used to facilitate air dispersion into fine bubbles, and to<br>
stabilize the froth, According to Leja-Schulman's penetration theory frothers<br>
accumulate preferentially at the air-water interface and interact with collector<br>
molecules, adsorbed onto solid particles in the particle-to-bubble collision and<br>
attachment Effect of frothers on bubble size results from their ability to prevent<br>
bubble coalescence. The degree of bubble coalescence decreases with<br>
increasing frother concentration and at a particular concentration known as<br>
critical coalescence concentration (COC) for a frother, it reaches non coalescence<br>
environment Above the critical coalescence concentration there is very little<br>
effect on bubble size and to a large extent, the cell geometry affects the bubble<br>
size distribution.<br><br>
A successful frother must allow sufficient thinning of the liquid film between the<br>
colliding bubble and the particle so that attachment can take place in the time<br>
frame of the collision. Thinner liquid film enhances the bubble-particle<br>
attachment during collision process but it also increases the bubble-bubble<br>
coalescence. Thus a successful frother must achieve a delicate balance between<br>
these two competing processes and provide sufficient stability of the<br>
bubble/particles moiety and yet allow the weakly adhering or mechanically<br>
trapped particles of unwanted materials to escape with the draining liquid.<br>
Gravity is the main driving force for the drainage in froth phase. The surface<br>
gradient along the air-water interface creates the Gibbs-Marangoni effect that<br>
acts to retain the film thickness and prevent bubble coalescence. The froth<br>
stability also depends on, (a) particle size (finer particles stabilize froth), (b)<br>
wetting characteristics (particles having contact angle less than 90 degree<br>
stabilize froth and (c) shape of particles.<br>
Neutral frothers can be essentially divided into four groups. The first group<br>
consists of aromatic alcohols such as a-creasol and 2,3-xylenol. A second group<br>
is the alkoxy types such as triethoxy butane (TEB). The third group consists of<br>
aliphatic alcohols such as 2-ethyl hexanol, diacetone and methyl isobutyl carbinol<br>
(MIBC). In recent years, a fourth group of synthetic frothers consisting of<br><br>
polyethylene oxide (PEO), polypropylene oxide (PPO) and polybutylene oxide<br>
(PBO) types have been introduced into the market These chemicals may be<br>
presented by the general equation:<br><br>
It is generally known in industry that it is difficult to use a single pure frother<br>
that will effectively give good overall floatation performance for wide size<br>
distributed floatation feed (0.5 X 0.0 mm). It is due to some frothers are<br>
effective for coarse particles and others are good for floating ultra fine fractions.<br>
Attempts have been made to develop blended frothers for floating wide size<br>
distributed floatation feed. Examples of patents directed at improved frothers<br>
include U.S. Patent No. 4,582,596 issued April 15,1986, U.S. Patent No. 4,915,<br>
825 issued April 10, 1990, U.S. Patent No. 4, 272, 364 issued June 09, 1981,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4, 504, 385 issued March 12,1985, U.S. Patent No. 5, 304, 317<br>
issued April 19,1994, U.S. Patent No. 3,710,939 issued January 16,1973, U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4, 606, 818 Issued August 19, 1986, U.S. Patent No. 4, 761, 223<br>
issued August 02,1988, U.S. Patent No. 4,925,559 issued May 15,1990.<br><br>
In general practice, the frothers are screened under the general guidelines<br>
(price, availability, solubility in water, environment impact etc) and verification<br>
by laboratory and/or plant floatation data. It is generally accepted that adding a<br>
surface-active agent to water lowers the surface tension of the solution due to<br>
heteropolar nature of the reagent molecules. Thus, the surface tension of a<br>
solution is an Indication of the activity of a frother. Frothers that strongly tower<br>
the surface tension produce more stable froths. While the above conceptual<br>
picture is qualitatively correct, the use of surface tension measurements alone to<br>
screen frothers for application in floatation is limited. This is primarily due to the<br>
highly dynamic nature of the froth, especially in the presence of partides and<br>
turbulence. This situation Is not very different today and the terms "powerful" or<br>
"selective", which are used to characterize frothers, have intuitive rather than<br>
scientific meaning.<br>
There was therefore, a need for selection of selective and powerful mixed frother<br>
for coal floatation through blending mechanism of pure single frothing molecules.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a froth floatation process<br>
for beneficiating coat where coarse and ultrafine coal particles are selectively<br>
recovered in the presence of mixed chemicals system of methyl isobutyl carbinol<br>
(MIBC) and PPG-1000 (polygloycol ether).<br><br>
The process comprises characterizing of frothing molecules in two-phase (air-<br>
water interface) and three phase coal floatation. Scientific analysis provides<br>
linkage between two-phase frother classification Indices and coal floatation<br>
performance parameters. This novel process will facilitate in classification of<br>
frother and making suitable blended frother depending on the feed size<br>
distribution.<br>
The improvement in floatation process is governed by the novel approach for<br>
preparation of selective and powerful mixed frother for coal floatation through<br>
blending mechanism of pure single frothing molecules. This process contains<br>
characterization of frothing molecules in two-phase (air-water interface) and<br>
three phase coal floatation. Two phase frother characterization parameters are<br>
dynamic foamability index (OR), critical coalescene concentration (CCC), air<br>
bubble size distribution and surface activity and surfactants orientation at air-<br>
water interface. Selectivity, kinetics and size-wise floatation performance are<br>
three phase floatation characterization indices, Two phase fundamental frother<br>
characterization parameters are well correlated with floatation separation<br>
efficiency parameters. Surfactant molecules having loop and coil orientation at<br>
interface, high dynamic foamability index value, low critical coalescene<br>
concentration and high surface activeness are efficient for floating coarse<br><br>
particles. On the other hand molecules having vertical placement at air-water<br>
Interface, mono-fine bubble size, low dynamic foamability index and high critical<br>
coalescence concentration are selective for ultrafine coal particles. Mixed<br>
chemical systems of those frothing molecules are suitable coal floatation frother<br>
for broad size distributed floatation feed.<br>
Composition of methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC) and PPG-1000 in blended frotner<br>
depends on the ratio of ultrafine and coarse fraction in floatation feed. The<br>
methyl isobutyi carbinol can be present in an amount of 70 % and said PPG-1000<br>
in an amount of 30 %. The blended frother of the present invention is used in a<br>
dosage ranging from between about 0.10 kg/t to about 0.20 kg/t of floatation<br>
feed coal. The blended frother (methyl isobutyi carbinol and PPG-1000) is<br>
capable in floating selectively of ultrafine and coarse coal particles.<br>
There is Improvement in 4 % clean coal yield and 1 % ash reduction with this<br>
blended frothing molecule. It also produces dry froth by means of reduction in<br>
froth moisture.<br>
The process for preparation of selective and powerful mixed frother for coal<br>
floatation through blending mechanism of pure single frothing molecules of the<br><br>
present invention helps in depth understanding of frother action in coal floatation<br>
process. This process comprises characterization of frothing molecules in two-<br>
phase (air-water interface) and three phase coal floatation. The<br>
floatation/surfactant molecules have loop and coil orientation at interface, high<br>
dynamic foamability index value, low critical coalescence concentration and high<br>
surface activeness are efficient for floating coarse particles.<br>
The molecules have vertical placement at air-water interface, mono-fine bubble<br>
size, low dynamic foamability index and high critical coalescence concentration<br>
are selective for ultrafine coal particles. The mixed chemical systems of the<br>
frothing molecules are suitable coal floatation frother for broad size distributed<br>
floatation feed. The blended frother of the present invention containing methyl<br>
isobutyl carblnol and PPG-1000 is showing improvement in 4 % dean coal yield<br>
and 1 % ash reduction. It also produces dry forth by means of reduction in froth<br>
moisture.<br>
Thus the present invention provides a process for preparation of a selective and<br>
powerful mixed frother coal floatation for coal benefication, comprising the steps<br>
of: characterizing frothing / surfactant molecules into two phase (air-water<br>
interface) flotation parameters and three phase flotation parameters; blending of<br><br>
pure single frothing / surfactant molecules In the presence of a mixed chemical<br>
system of methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC) and polyglycol ether PPG - 1000; and<br>
selectively recovering coarse and ultrafine coal particles from said mixed<br>
chemical system.<br>
BRIEF DESCRlPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The invention can now be described in details with the help of the figures of the<br>
accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Rgure 1 shows schematic diagram of setup for testing<br>
frothability, foam stability and bubble size.<br>
Figure 2 shows the relationship between frother<br>
concentration and air bubble size.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The process of this invention for screening the frothing molecules and preparing<br>
blended chemicals results in an improved and efficient process for the recovery<br>
of coal values with enhanced recovery of coarse and ultrafine particles of the<br><br>
coal through addition of suitable frother in floatation. The invention of<br>
classification of frother is described here under sequential characterization<br>
techniques. The invention will become more readily apparent by explaining the<br>
process with example of PPG-1000 (Polygloycol ether family), methyl Isobutyl<br>
carbinol (Alcohol family) and Alpha-Terpinol (Alcohol family).<br>
Two-phases frother characterization<br>
Surface tension analysis<br>
Ring-Plate tensiometer is used to measure the surface tension of aqueous<br>
solutions at varying frother concentration at normal pH and room temperature.<br>
The surface tension decreases with Increasing frother concentration as molecutes<br>
adsorb at the liquid-air interface, Frother belonging to the polyglycol family<br>
decreases the surface tension more sharply compare to alcohol family frotners.<br>
It indicates that PPG-1000 is more surface active. Air-water interface affinity<br>
order of different frbthers at lower concentration is given below:<br>
PPG-1000&gt;iAlpha-terplneol&gt; MIBC<br><br>
For monodisperse nonionic surfactants, at constant pH, the adsorbed amount at<br>
air-water interface is given by the Gibbs adsorption isotherm<br><br>
where r is adsorption density, y is the static surface tension, T Is the absolute<br>
temperature, R is the ideal gas constant and C is the bulk frother concentration.<br>
The surface area occupied by a single molecule. Aexp, at the air-liquid interface is<br>
calculated as<br><br>
Where Av is the Avagdro number<br>
The equilibrium adsorption loading (I) and the adsorption area per molecule<br>
(AEXp) are presented in Table 1. As can be seen in Table 1, the adsorption<br>
loading of polyglycol ether (PPG-1000) is lower compared to alcohol family<br>
frothers. According to it, MIBC is required less area per molecule to adsorb at<br>
air/water interface compared to Alpha-Terpinol and PPG-1000.<br><br><br>
The molecular adsorption area of a methyl Isobutyl carbinol molecule and an<br>
Alpha-terpinol respectively are found to be 34 (A0)2 and 51 (A0)2. This alcohol<br>
family molecule ranges in chain length from approximately 6 A0 to 10 A0, with a<br>
diameter of approximately 2.0 A0. So these results are dose to the geometric<br>
dimensions of the hydrocarbon chain, indicating methyl isobutyl carbinol stands<br>
up at the air-water interface with -OH group oriented towards water phase and<br>
the hydrophobic chain towards air phase. From the equilibrium surface tension<br>
data, the molecular area of a PPG-1000 molecule is calculated 138 (A0)2. When<br>
ail the bond angles are taken into account, the length of the molecule is found to<br>
be 23 A0, while the diameter is 7.0 A0, giving a flat-lying molecular area of 162<br>
(A0)2 whereas the vertical cross-sectional area is 39 (A0)2. The orientation of<br>
PPG-1000 at the air-water interface seems to be part way between completely<br>
lying down and completely standing up. It suggests the formation of loops and<br>
coiling up at the interface with PPG-1000 molecule.<br><br>
PPG-1000 has a much higher molecular weight (398) compared to methyl<br>
isobutyl carbinol (102) and this higher molecular weight may lead to a more<br>
viscous, and hence more stable, froth layer. There Is only one-OH group in<br>
methyl isobutyl carbinol and this group will interact with water molecules to form<br>
an oriented monolayer at the surface; but in PPG-1000, there are several<br>
oxygenated units in the molecular chain and each unit can interact with water<br>
molecules through hydrogen bonding, causing the molecules to tend to lie at the<br>
surface, possibly increasing viscosity of froth and hence foam stability.<br>
Foaming and stability<br>
A set-up is designed for the measurement of foamability and retention time as<br>
shown in Fig. 1. A graduated glass burette of 50 cm height and 2.5 cm diameter<br>
is fitted with a glass frit at the bottom and connected to a mercury manometer<br>
and air compressor. Experiments are carried out by talcing a known volume<br>
(15ml) of the reagent solution in the burrette and passing air to the solution at a<br>
fixed flow rate. Air is bubbled through a glass frit into the frother solution of<br>
known concentration to create foam. The steady state foam height (foamability)<br>
is measured as the distance between the liquid-foam interface and the top of the<br>
foam.After the newly formed foam has been stabilized and attained an<br><br>
equilibrium height (after approx 2-3 min), the steady state height is recorded.<br>
Since the cross sectional area of glass burette is same throughout Its length, the<br>
height is also measure of the volume of the foam generated by the air at a fixed<br>
air flow rate for a known frother concentration.<br>
The foam height increases with increasing air flow rate and frother<br>
concentration. PPG-1000 gives the highest froth volume and methyl isobutyl<br>
carblnol produces considerably lower foaming. For the testing of behavior of<br>
floatation frothers, the dynamic foamability index is measured. This<br>
measurement requires determination of the retention time (rt) from the slope of<br>
linear part of the dependence of the total gas volume (V) in solution and foam<br>
plotted versus gas flow rate (Q) for increasing frother concentration, which is<br>
accordance with Eq. (3).<br><br>
The retention time (rt) values are obtained then used to determine the dynamic<br>
foamability index (DFI), which is defined as the limiting slope of the retention<br>
time-concentration curve for C-&gt; 0. Dynamic foamability index is defined as<br>
follows (Laskowski et at., 2003)<br><br><br>
Using the foamability data of methyl isobutyl carbinot concentration, PPG-1000<br>
and Alpha-terpineol and Eq. (3), the foam retention time of the foamer at<br>
different concentration is calculated. Polyglycol ether frother (PPG-1000) has<br>
achieved maximum foaming performance at relatively low concentration. Methyl<br>
isobutyl carbinol is showing lower retention time, which results in poor frothing<br>
efficiency compare to other two frothers. The relative order of frother efficiency<br>
in terms of dynamic foamability index is given below:<br>
PPG-1000&gt; Alpha--terpineol&gt;MIBC<br>
Bubble size distribution<br>
The experimental set-up of foamability is used for imaging bubbles as shown in<br>
Figure 1. Bubble images in foam phase are captured using a CCD camera, which<br>
was connected to a personal computer where the visual information is stored<br>
and processed. The images captured during sampling are automatically<br>
processed using image analysis technique for measuring bubble size distribution.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 2, each curve is clearly divided into two<br>
concentration ranges, the low concentration range which can be approximated<br>
by a step linear fit and the flat horizontal portion at higher concentration. The<br><br>
intersection of the horizontal asymptote to the sauter bubble size-concentration<br>
curve with the step linear portion can easily be determined. This Is so called<br>
critical coalescence concentration (Cho and Laskowski, 2002; Grau et al. 2005).<br>
The general trend for all the investigated frothers are fairly similar, the bubble<br>
size decreases with increasing frother dosage, and at a particular concentration,<br>
the bubble size leveled off. Frother controls bubble size by reducing bubble<br>
coalescence in the cell and that coalescence is entirely prevented at<br>
concentration exceeding the critical coalescence concentration in a dynamic<br>
system. It is dear from Figure 2 that the critical coalescence concentration value<br>
is different for each type of frother and given in Table 2. At frother<br>
concentration exceeding the critical coalescence concentration value, the<br>
conditions In the cell can be defined as non-coalescing. PPG-1000 Is able to<br>
provide nonrcoalescing environment in floatation system at lowest concentration<br>
compared to other frothers belonging to alcohol family. Methyl isobutyl carbinol<br>
is the most effective frother in terms of bubble size reduction and the least<br>
effective one is PPG-1000, Frothers dont only hinder coalescence but also<br>
somehow affect bubble break-up under turbulent conditions.<br><br><br>
A representative minus 0.5 mm size semi bituminous floatation feed coal sample<br>
is taken in this investigation. Nature of coal sample is difficult to float Ash<br>
analysis is carried out according to ASTM D 3174-73 standard snowed that the<br>
sample contains 24.5 % ash. Size-wise weight and ash distribution analysis is<br>
conducted with a representative sample of the floatation feed. Floatation feed<br>
contains high percentage (20 %) of oversize fraction, namely -1+0.5 mm,<br>
having 23.5 % ash. Ultra size fraction (- 0.075 mm) is having maximum weight<br>
contribution in floatation feed content approx. 50 %. High-speed diesel oil is<br>
used as conventional collector. Three selected non-ionic surfactants are used as<br>
frother.<br><br>
Frother performance of these chemicals are characterized in term of selectivity,<br>
kinetics and size wise floatation performance as shown in Table 3. Methyl<br>
isobutyl carbinol is efficient selective frother compare to polyglycol frother PPG-<br>
1000. Rate of recovery for polyglycol frother PPG-100G is faster compared<br>
to other alcohol frothers methyl isobutyl carbinol and Alpha-terpinonl. PPG-1000<br>
is efficient in terms of recovery and grade for 0.5 X 0.075 mm fraction. But<br>
alcohol frother methyi isobutyl carbinol is very effective for ultrafine fraction (-<br>
0.075 mm) In terms of reducing ash content and floating the coal particles.<br><br><br>
Smaller bubbles are obtained in the methyl isobutyl carbinol solution than in<br>
PPG-1000 solutions despite the same porous frit being used, as well as the PPG-<br>
1000 solution having considerably lower surface tensions than the methyl<br>
isobutyl carbinol solutions at the similar concentrations. It follows that the<br>
adsorption for larger (and more surface active) molecules of PPG-1000 must be<br>
larger to prevent bubble from coalescence.<br>
Dynamic foamability index value indicates the dynamic stability of foam, In which<br>
bubbles do not easily coalesce. Critical coalescence concentration is a measure<br>
of minimum concentration of a given frother required to prevent coalescence.<br>
Table 2 shows that PPG-1000 is having high dynamic foamability index and low<br>
critical coalescence concentration and methyl isobutyl carbinol having low<br>
dynamic foamability index and high critical coalescence concentration value.<br>
From surface activity point, PPG-1000 is showing parallel (loop and coil)<br>
orientation at air-water interface. Methyl isobutyl carbinol is showing vertical<br>
configuration at interface. This information predicts that PPG-1000 is more<br>
efficient in preventing bubble coalescence and also producing more stable and<br>
viscous foam compare to frothers belonging to alcohol family. It reflects that<br>
higher water recovery from pulp phase to froth phase, more chance of floating<br>
coal and ash mineral particles and less drainage rate from froth phase of coal<br><br>
floatation with polyglycol frother (PPG-1000), PPG-1000 is showing faster<br>
kinetics and less selectivity due to entrainment through water compared to<br>
alcohol frothers. Methyl isobutyl carbinol is more efficient in bubble break-up<br>
process, means producing finer bubbles compared to polyglycol ether frother<br>
PPG-1000. From floatation practice, methyl isobutyl carbinol is very selective<br>
and appropriate for the floatation of ultrafine particles and PPG-1000 is better<br>
frother in terms of recovery and selectivity for coarse particles,. These two phase<br>
frother characterization indices and observations are well correlating with three<br>
phase floatation performance indexes for polyglycol ether and alcohol foaming<br>
molecules. The frother characterization indexes are summarized in Table 4. On<br>
the basis of observations obtained from frother classification process, PPG-1000<br>
and methyl isobutyl carbinol are mixed in different composition. Floatation<br>
performance with mixed frother (PPG-1000 and methyl isobutyl carbinol) Is<br>
illustrated in Table 3. Blended frother is showing improvement in performance of<br>
recovery and grade of ultrafine and coarse coal fraction. So overall it is showing<br>
enhanced floatation efficiency.<br><br><br><br>
A good matching in critical coalescence concentration and dynamic foamability<br>
index values of PFG-1000 and methyl isobutyl cgrbinol is reported between this<br>
invention and work done since, despite the difference in experimental measuring<br>
systems. It also reflects that dynamic foamability index and critical coalescence<br>
coricentration can be material properties, for frothing molecules. The polyglycol<br>
ether and alcohol frothers are presenting good association between fundamental<br>
two phase frother characterization indices and coal floatation performance.<br>
