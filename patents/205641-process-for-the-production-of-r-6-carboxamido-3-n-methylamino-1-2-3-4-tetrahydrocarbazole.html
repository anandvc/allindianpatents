PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF R-(+)-6- CARBOXAMIDO- 3-N- METHYLAMINO- 1,2.3,4-<br>
TETRAHYDROCARBAZOLE<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of R-(+)-6-carboxamido-3-N-methylamino-l ,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole.<br>
WO-A-93/00086 describes a group of tetrahydrocarbazoie derivatives, which have activity as 5HT, receptor agonists and are therefore useful in the treatment of migraine. The specific compounds disclosed include inter alia 3-methylamino-6-carboxamido-l,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole hydrochloride. WO-A-93/00086 also describes a preparation of 3-methylamino-6-carboxamido-l,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole hydrochloride which comprises a six stage process, via 3-methylamino-6-cyano-l,2,3,4- tetrahydrocarbazoie, involving a number of protection and deprotection steps.<br>
WO-A-94/14772 describes enantiomers of certain carbazole derivatives, including<br>
the aforementioned compound. The enantiomers disclosed are:<br>
R-(+)-6-carboxamido-3-N-methylamino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole;<br>
S-(-)-6-carboxamido-3-N-methylamino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole;<br>
R-(+)-6-carboxamido-3-N-ethylamino-l ,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole;<br>
S-(-)-6-carboxamido-3-N-ethylamino-l,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole;<br>
and 3 salts and solvates thereof.<br>
R-(+)-6-carboxamido-3-N-methylamino-l,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole succinate has now entered clinical trials for the treatment of migraine.<br>
WO-A-94/14772 provides various methods by which single enantiomers can be prepared, namely:<br>
(i)        separation of an enantiomeric mixture of the compound or a derivative thereof by chromatography, e.g. on a chiral HPLC column; (ii)      separation of diastereoisomers of a chiral derivative (e.g. a chiral salt) of the compound e.g. by crystallisation or chromatography; or<br><br>
(iii)     alkylation of (+) or (-) enantiomer of 3-amino-6-carboxamido-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole or a salt thereof.<br>
Although the above-noted procedures (i) to (iii) can be used to prepare the desired enantiomer, they are disadvantageous from the point of view of"scale-up" and the manufacture of commercial quantities of the compound. In particular it has been found that carrying out the resolution at the final stage of the synthesis and using R-2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid (also known as D-pyroglutamic acid) to form a chiral salt results in an intermediate with poor solubility and hence gives low yields of the desired enantiomer, despite the fact that R-2-pyrroIidone-5-carboxylic acid is described as a preferred optically active acid for use in the process described in WO-A-94/14772.<br>
There is therefore a need to provide a more efficient method which more readily lends itself to commercial manufacture. We have now devised such a process for the preparation of R-(+)-6-carboxamido-3-N-methylamino-l,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole. This process relies on resolution of an indole nitrile intermediate compound at a relatively early stage of the process.  We have surprisingly found that this intermediate has good solubility and enables the desired enantiomer to be obtained in good yield. Indeed, although the new process has one more step than the process of WO-A-94/14772 it gives a greater overall yield of final product.  Furthermore, carrying out the resolution on the nitrile intermediate ensures that subsequent steps are carried out on the correct enantiomeric form of intermediate compounds resulting in direct production of the compound without the need for chromatography or the like.<br>
Thus, in a first aspect, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of R-(+)-6-carboxamido-3-N-methylamino-l,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole which comprises the step of resolving a mixture of enantiomers of an indole nitrile compound of formula (I):<br><br><br>
The compound of formula (I) may be named as 6-cyano-3-N-methylamino-L2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole. It will be appreciated that the compound of formula (I) may comprise varying ratios of its two enatiomers. In particular it may exist as a racemic mixture.<br>
It has been found that resolution of the mixture of indole nitrile enantiomers can advantageously be achieved by the use of L-pyroglutamic acid. Indeed, it was surprisingly found that use of D-pyroglutamic acid gave the 'wrong' enantiomer, whereas L-pyroglutamic acid gave the desired enantiomer in good yield. The use of L-pyroglutamic acid also has economic advantages as it is the naturally occurring form and hence considerably less expensive than the D-form. Reaction with the optically active acid to form a chiral salt may be effected in a suitable solvent, for example an alcohol such as methanol or ethanol and at a temperature in the range 0 to 100Â°C.  The desired enantiomer is obtained by crystallisation using methods well known in the art.  Crystallisation may be initiated spontaneously, or in some cases seeding may be required.  The reaction mixture is desirably treated with acetic acid, preferably after crystallisation has been initiated. This has been found advantageously to facilitate selective crystalllisation of the desired enantiomer.  The resulting L-pyroglutamate salt may advantageously be recrystallised from aqueous methanol or more preferably aqueous ethanol to enhance the optical purity of the product. The chiral salt may be converted into the free base using standard procedures, to provide (+)-6-cyano-3-N-methylamino-l,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole. If desired this compound may be directly reacted in situ to form the corresponding carboxamido compound.<br><br>
(-f)-6-Cyano-3-N-methylamino-L2,3.4-retrahydrocarbazole is a novel compound. Therefore, in a further aspect the present invention provides ( + )-6-cyano-3-N-methylaimno-l,23.4-tetrahydrocarbazole of formula (II):<br><br>
and salts and solvates thereof.<br>
A preferred embodiment of this aspect of the invention is (+)-6-cyano-3-N-methylamino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole L-pyroglutamate.<br>
The compound of formula (II) may be converted into the desired R-(+)-6Â« carboxamide-3-N-methylamino-l,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarba2ole or a salt or solvate thereof.<br>
In a further aspect therefore, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of R-(+)-6-carboxamido-3-N-methylamino-l ,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole or a salt or solvate thereof, which process comprises hydrolysing R-( + )-6-cyano-3-N-methylamino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole or a salt or solvate thereof. As will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, a nitrile may be hydrolysed to give either an amide or a carboxylic acid, depending upon the conditions used.  It will therefore be appreciated that in the present process the hydrolysis conditions should be chosen to give an amide rather than a carboxylic acid.  Preferably hydrolysis is effected using acetic acid and boron trifluoride (BF3)/ acetic acid complex.  Other means of hydrolysis which may be employed include hydrogen peroxide in the presence of an<br><br>
alkali hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxide, in a solvent such as an alcohol; or formic acid and hydrobromic or hydrochloric acid.<br>
6-Cyano-3-N-methylamino-l,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole employed as the starting material for the resolution step, may be prepared for example using the methods described in WO-A-93/00086. Alternatively, and more preferably 6-cyano-3-N-methylamino-l,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazoIe may be prepared by reacting 4-cyanophenyl hydrazine of formula (IE):<br><br>
or a salt thereof e.g. the hydrochoride with 4-methylaminocyclohexanone or a protected derivative thereof. Advantageously the ketal derivative 4-methylaminocyclohexanone (2\2'-dimethyltrimethylene)ketal or a salt thereof, eg the hydrochloride, is employed:<br><br>
(IV) The reaction is preferably effected under aqueous acidic conditions.<br><br>
The aforementioned ketal derivative (TV) is a commercially available compound. It may be prepared for example by the method described in WO-A-94/14772, by reaction of the corresponding protected 1,4-cyclohexanedione of formula (V):<br><br>
with methylamine.<br>
The reaction is preferably effected in a suitable solvent, such as an alcohol, or a mixture thereof, e.g. industrial methylated spirits or methanol, with catalytic hydrogenation using for example palladium on charcoal.<br>
A complete synthetic sequence from the keto-ketal of formula (V) to R-(+)-6-carboxamido-3-N-methylamino-l,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole is as follows:<br><br><br><br>
Preferred reaction conditions for the various steps are as follows:<br>
(i)        IMS, MeNH:, H2, Pd-C then THF, HC1, 0-10Â°C e.g. 0-5Â°C or preferably 5-<br>
10Â°C (yield: 77-94% theory); (ii)       HCl(aq), 80-90Â°C preferably 85-90Â°C followed by 0-5Â°C then NaOH(aq),<br>
THF followed by 0-5Â°C, (yield: 62-85% theory); (iii)     MeOH, L-pyroglutamic acid (L-PGA), AcOH, 50Â°C or preferably reflux<br>
followed by 0-5Â°C then recystallisation from aqueous MeOH or preferably<br>
EtOH, (yield: 14-30% theory); (iv)     AcOH, BF3(Ac0H)2, 90-95Â°C then NaOH, BuOH, then Na;C03 or<br>
preferably water wash, (yield: 70-100% theory).<br>
As an optional step (v) the resulting compound (II) from step (iv) can easily be converted to an appropriate salt form, e.g. a succinic acid salt by reaction with succinic acid in an alcohol such as ethanol or a mixture of alcohols such as ethanol and butanol. The reaction is preferably effected at a temperature in the range 60-100Â°C eg 60-65Â°C or preferably 70-100Â°C then 20-25Â°C, (yield: 87-90%theory). The salt, eg the succinate may if desired or necessary be recrystallised, preferably using aqueous ethanol.<br>
In a further embodiment therefore the present invention provides a process for the preparation of R-(+)-6-carboxamido-3-N-methylamino-l,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole or a salt or solvate thereof, which comprises reaction steps (i) to (iv) above and optionally salt formation step (v).<br>
As the amine ketal hydrochloride material used in step (ii) is a commercially available compound, the process can effectively consist of only steps (ii) to (iv).<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides the use of L-pyroglutamic acid in resolving an enantiomeric mixture of an indole nitrile compound of the formula (I):<br><br><br>
The present invention will now be described with reference to the following examples which should not be construed as in any way limiting the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1: Resolution of a racemic mixture of 6-Cyano-3-N-methylamino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole (Indole Nitrile)<br>
(a)       Salt formation<br>
Racemic Indole Nitrile (1.72mol, 387g) was mixed with methanol (1.941) and the mixture stirred and heated to reflux to give a solution. Meanwhile, a second flask was charged with L-pyroglutamic acid (0.5mol equiv., 110.9g) and methanol (774ml). The methanolic solution of the racemic Indole Nitrile was cooled to 50Â°C and filtered directly into the L-pyroglutamic acid mixture followed by two rinses with methanol (774ml and 387ml). The water content of the resultant mixture was adjusted so as to fall within the range 0.7-2% w/v. The mixture was heated to reflux to give a solution and then cooled to 25Â°C, seeded and acetic acid (0.6mol equiv., 59ml) was added over 30min at 25-28Â°C. The mixture was aged at 25Â°C for 30min and then cooled to 0-3 Â°C and aged for a further 2h. The resulting solid was isolated by filtration and dried in vacuo at ambient temperature to give intermediate grade R-(+)-6-cyano-3-N-methylamino-l,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole, Pyroglutamate salt (180.8g).<br>
(b)       Recrvstallisation<br>
The intermediate grade Pyroglutamate salt (147.4g) prepared in step (a) was mixed with water (120.6ml) and 96% ethanol (363ml) and the slurry was stirred and heated to reflux to give a solution. Further 96% ethanol (1.031) was added to the refluxing solution durinc 30min and the mixture was then seeded. The mixture was cooled to 0-5Â°C during 2h and aged for a further l-2h. The solid was isolated by filtration and dried in vacuo at ambient temperature to give -R-(+)-6-cyano-3-N-methylamino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole, Pyroglutamate salt(123.2g) with ee&gt;98% by HPLC analysis.<br><br><br>
2.1      Preparation of 4-methylaminocyclohexanone (2*2'-dimethyltrimethylene) ketal hydrochloride (Amine Ketal Hydrochloride)<br>

In parallel with this concentration phase, a second Stage One reaction was started in RV2 on the same scale as that described above and once the reaction was complete (GC analysis as above), the reaction was filtered directly into RV3 and the concentrate from the first batch with the line rinses to follow.  Again, the combined filtrate and washings were concentrated in vacuo at 35 to 40Â°C to remove the IMS.<br>
The residue was diluted with tetrahydrofuran (THF) (250L) and the solution concentrated in vacuo at 35 to 40Â°C to remove a portion (62.5L) of the THF.  The solution was made up once more with THF (62.5L) and the concentration to remove<br><br>
62.5L was repeated. The solution was then cooled to 0 to 5Â°C and treated with concentrated hydrochloric acid (1.2xnol equiv, 12.5L) at such a rate as to maintain the temperature below 10Â°C throughout. The resultant mixture was cooled to 0 to 5Â°C and aged for 1 to 2h.  The solid was collected by filtration on a 27" nutsche filter, washed by displacement with THF (2 x 25L) and dried in vacuo at 40Â°C to constant weight (typically overnight) to give the Amine Ketal Hydrochloride as a white solid (26.92kg corrected for solvent content, 85.5%th, 107.7% w/w).<br>
2.2      Preparation of 6-Cyano-3-N-methylamino-l,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole (Racemic Indole Nitrile)<br>
4-Cyanophenylhydrazine hydrochloride (26.24kg) and the Amine Ketal hydrochloride (Imol equiv. 38.57kg) were charged to the reaction vessel (RV3; nominal capacity 250L; working capacity oz300L) followed by water (92L) and cone, hydrochloric acid (65.6L). The reaction mixture was stirred and heated to 80-90Â° for up to ca 5h and monitored by proton NMR (see note below).  When the reaction was deemed to be complete, the reaction mixture was cooled to 0-5Â°C and aged for 1 hour at this temperature.  The racemic Indole Nitrile Hydrochloride was filtered using a 27" nutsche filter and washed thoroughly with water (3 x 26L or until the washing is &gt;pH5). The damp racemic Indole Nitrile Hydrochloride was then charged back into RV3, followed by water (164.5L) and THF (66L). The pH was adjusted to pH 13 with 6M NaOH (ca 33L) and the reaction mixture stirred for 30min. A sample was removed, the solid filtered off and checked by proton NMR (see note below) to ensure the free base had been generated. The THF was then distilled off in vacuo at 
 <br>
Determination of end-point of the reaction:<br>
A sample of the reaction mixture is removed from the vessel and filtered under vacuum. Approximately 20mg of the solid is dissolved in 1-2 ml of D6-DMSO and the NMR spectrum is collected using a 360MHz NMR spectrometer. The spectrum is examined for disappearance of the signals relating to the Hydrazine hydrochloride at 57.05ppm (2H, doublet) and 87.7ppm (2H, doublet).  The distinctive signals in the aromatic region relating to the racemic Indole Nitrile Hydrochloride intermediate are at S7.9ppm (1H, singlet) and 87.3-7.5 (2H, multiplet).<br>
Confirmation of free base formation:<br>
A sample of the reaction mixture is removed from the vessel and filtered under vacuum. Approximately 20mg of the solid is dissolved in l-2ml of D6-DMSO and the NMR spectrum is collected using a 360MHz NMR spectrometer.  The signal for the N-methyl group in the racemic Indole nitrile hydrochloride moves from its starting shift of 82.65ppm (singlet) to the shift of S2.38ppm (singlet) for the free base, the racemic Indole nitrile.  It is important that the shift of 82.38ppm is obtained since mixtures of the hydrochloride and free base will exhibit N-methyl shifts within this range due to equilibration in the NMR solution.<br>
2.3      Preparation of R-(+)-6-cyano-3-N-methylamino-l,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole Pyroglutamate<br>
The racemic Indole Nitrile (lmol equiv, 25.13kg) and L-pyroglutamic acid (0.5mol equiv. 7.3kg) were charged to the reaction vessel (RV3; nominal capacity 250L; working capacity ca300L) followed by methanol (250L) and the stirred mixture was heated to reflux to give a solution.  The mixture was cooled to 50Â°C and acetic acid (0.6mol equiv. 3.8L) added over approximately 15min. The solution was seeded after the acetic acid addition, aged at 50-55Â°C for 30min, and stirred whilst cooling to 0-5Â°C at a constant rate over 2h.  The slurry was aged at this temperature for 2h. The solid was filtered using a 27" nutsche filter and washed with methanol (1 x 25L, 1 x 12.5L).  The resulting solid was either dried in vacuo at room temperature<br><br>
to constant weight (typical output; 47-50%w/w of ca 94%ee material) or used methanol-wet in the recrystallisation having corrected for methanol content by proton NMR.<br>
Recrystallisation of the salt to meet optical specification: The solid (24.11kg) was charged to the reaction vessel (RV3; nominal capacity 250L; working capacity ca300L) followed by methanol (206L) and water (21.7L). The mixture was heated to reflux and stirred until all the solid dissolved (typically 30min). The mixture was cooled to 55-60Â°C, seed crystals introduced and the mixture aged at 55-60Â°C for 30min, then cooled to 0-5Â°C at constant rate during lh and aged for 2h.  The resulting solid was filtered using a 27" nutsche filter, washed by displacement with methanol (24L), and dried in vacuo at room temperature to constant weight. The Pyroglutamate was isolated as an off-white to white solid (16.81 kg corrected for methanol and water content, 69.7% w/w). The product has essentially the same IR and NMR spectra as the product of Example 3.2.<br>
2.4      Preparation of R-(4-)-6-carboxamido-3-N-methylamino-l,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole<br>
The reaction vessel (RV2, nominal capacity 100L; working capacity azl30L) was charged with the Pyroglutamate salt (lmol equiv. 22.0kg), acetic acid (55L) and demineralised water (5mol equiv, 5.5L) to give a dark brown solution on stirring. Boron trifluoride-acetic acid complex (6mol equiv, 52.8L) was added in one portion and a thick, white precipitate formed. The stirred mixture was heated at 90-95Â° and the precipitate redissolved as the temperature reaches 95Â°C to give a dark brown solution.  The reaction was monitored by HPLC analysis for disappearance of the Pyroglutamate and formation of R-(+)-6-carboxamido-3-N-methylamino-l,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole and Indole carboxylic acid (as a by-product).  When the reaction was complete (typically ca5-8h reaction time), the mixture was cooled to 25-30Â° and added to stirred cooled (0-4Â°C) water (110L) in RV3 (nominal capacity 250L; working capacity up to oz300L) over 10 min maintaining the temperature<br><br>
below 30Â° throughout (some fuming may occur at this point). /7-Butanol (110L) was added and the mixture cooled to 5-10Â°C.  The pH was adjusted to 7 and the contents transferred to a stainless steel vessel (MV1, nominal capacity 600L; working capacity ca650L) and the pH further adjusted 12-14 by the addition of 6M sodium hydroxide solution over ca lh maintaining the temperature below 30Â°C throughout (ca 330L is required to give pH13). The layers are allowed to settle and then separated. The aqueous layer was further extracted with w-butanol (1 x 110L, 1 x 55L). The combined organic extract was washed with ca 10%w/v sodium carbonate solution (2 x 44L). The carbonate washes were combined and back-extracted with n-butanol (44L). All the organic extracts were combined in RV3 and concentrated in vacuo to ca 130L maintaining an internal temperature below 50Â°C throughout. The concentrate was treated with base-washed charcoal (pH range 6-8, 1.1kg) added as slurry in n-butanol (22L) and the stirred mixture was heated and stirred at reflux for 15min. The mixture was cooled to 40-45Â°C, clarified in portions through a lym filter into the distillate receiver of RV3 (ie. DR3; capacity 100L) followed by a line rinse of 96% ethanol (8.8L).  The solution of R-(+)-6-carboxamido-3-N-methylamino-l,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole was transferred as necessary to a previously unused drum and a sample was removed for HPLC analysis to determine the product content (11.6kg, 77.2%th, 52.7%w/w). The solution of R-(+)-6-carboxamidoÂ«3-N-methylamino-l,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole was taken directly on to the next stage for the formation of the succinate salt.<br>
2.5      Preparation of R-(+)-6-carboxamido-3-N-methyIamino-l,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole, succinate salt.<br>
The reaction vessel (RV3, nominal capacity 250L; working capacity 300L) was charged with ethanol (98.5L), demineralised water (23.2L) and succinic acid (lmol equiv, 5.68kg) and the mixture heated to 70Â° with stirring until all the succinic acid dissolved (oz30min).  A solution of R-(+)-6-carboxamido-3-N-methylamino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole (contained weight; 11.59kg) in n-butanol/ethanol solution (total solution weight: 143kg) was added over 30 minutes, maintaining the internal temperature at 60-65Â° throughout, with a line rinse of warm (ca40Â°C) n-<br><br>
butanol/ethanol mixture (2:1, 17.4L). At the midpoint of the addition, the mixture was seeded with R-(4&gt;6-carboxamido-3-N-methylamino-l,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole (succinate salt) (the product may crystallise out of solution during the addition of the butanol solution to the succinic acid solution. In this case seeding is not necessary; when the addition is complete the stirred mixture is heated to reflux for ca 20min then cooled as described hereafter. Ageing at 55-60C0 is unnecessary).<br>
When the addition was complete, the hot mixture was cooled to 55-60C0 and aged<br>
for lh. The mixture was further cooled to 25Â°C over a 2h period, at a rate of 5Â°C<br>
every 20min followed by stirring the suspension at 25Â°C for 12-15h. The solid was<br>
filtered using a 27" nutsche filter and washed by displacement with cooled (5Â°C)<br>
96% ethanol (2 x 8.7L). The wet-cake was dried in vacuo at ambient temperature<br>
for up to 30h to give the product R-(+)-6-carboxamido-3-N-methylamino-l,2,3,4-<br>
tetrahydrocarbazole succinate salt monohydrate<br>
as an off-white solid (15.52kg, 85.9%th, 133.9%w/w).<br>
The product has essentially the same IR and NMR spectra as the product of<br>

Racemic Indole nitrile (lmol equiv, 21.57Kg) was charged to the 100L reaction vessel (working capacity cal30L), followed by methanol (105L). The mixture was stirred at 60 - 65Â°C until all the racemic Indole Nitrile had dissolved (lhr 31min). L-Pyroglutamic acid (0.5mol equiv, 6.26Kg) was charged to the 250L reaction vessel (working capacity oz300L), followed by methanol (43.5L). The solution of racemic Indole nitrile was cooled to 50-55Â°C, clarified through a l|im filter and transferred into the 250L vessel.  This was followed by two line rinses of methanol<br><br>
(43.5L, then 21L), each of which were heated to 50-55Â°C before transfer.   The contents of the 250L vessel were sampled to determine the water content of the mixture and further demineralised water was added to give a mixture containing 0.79%w/v (limits 0.7-2.0 %w/v). The stirred mixture in the 250L vessel was heated to reflux to obtain a full solution.    The mixture was cooled to 24-26Â°C and, if necessary, seeded to initiate crystallisation. Acetic acid (0.6mol equiv, 3.48Kg) was added, maintaining the internal temperature at 23-28Â°C, with the addition taking 18 min. The mixture was aged at 20-25 Â°C for 35 min, cooled to 10-12Â°C over 40 min, further cooled to 5Â°C and stirred at 0-5Â°C for 2hr 55min.  The material was filtered off and washed with methanol (1 x 21L, 1 x 11L). The resulting solid was dried in vacuo at a temperature up to 45Â°C (10.95Kg (corrected) of 93.2%de material, 50.8%w/w).    Alternatively, the solid could have been used methanol-wet in the recrystallisation, being corrected for methanol content by proton NMR.<br>

3.3      Preparation of R-( + )-6-carboxamido-3-N-methylamino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-carbazole<br>
The 100L reaction vessel (working capacity cal30L) was charged with the Pyroglutamate salt (lmol equiv, 5.93Kg), acetic acid (9L) and demineralised water (5mol equiv, 1.48L) to give a dark brown solution on stirring.  Boron trifluoride-acetic acid complex (6mol equiv, 14.1L) was added in one portion, followed by acetic acid line rinses (2 x 3L) and a thick, white precipitate was formed. The stirred mixture was heated at 90-95Â°C and the precipitate dissolved (as the temperature reached 95Â°C) to give a dark brown solution.  The reaction was monitored by HPLC analysis for disappearance of the Pyroglutamate salt and formation of R-(+)-6-carboxamido-3-N-methylamino-l ,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole and Indole carboxylic acid (by-product).  When the reaction was complete (6hr 18min), the mixture was cooled to 25-30Â°C and added to stirred, cool (5-10Â°C) demineralised water (31L) in the 250L reaction vessel (working capacity caSOOL), maintaining the temperature below 30Â°C throughout, the addition taking 12min. This was followed by a line rinse of demineralised water (5L).  rt-Butanol (29L) was added and the mixture was cooled to 5-10Â°C.  The pH was adjusted to 14 by the addition of ca 6M sodium hydroxide solution (106L), maintaining the temperature<br><br>
below 30Â°C throughout, the addition taking 61min. The temperature was adjusted to 25-30Â°C and the phases were allowed to settle and then separated.  The aqueous phase was further extracted with /z-butanol (1 x 29L, 1 x 15L) at 25-30Â°C throughout.  The combined organic extracts were washed with demineralised water (5 x 12L) at 25-30Â°C throughout. The organic solution was concentrated in vacuo to 37L, maintaining an internal temperature of 40-50Â°C throughout.  The concentrate was treated with a charcoal (60g) slurry in w-butanol (6L) and the stirred mixture was heated at reflux for 27min. The mixture was cooled to 55-60Â°C, clarified through a l|im filter, followed by a line rinse of 96% ethanol (11.5L) at 55-60Â°C and a sample was removed for HPLC analysis to determine the product content (3.76Kg, 92.4%th, 63.4%w/w).
