				<td>Introduction<br>
Currently there exists significant interest in the use of multihop techniques in packet<br>
based radio and other communication systems, where it is purported that such<br>
techniques will enable both extension in coverage range and increase in system<br>
capacity (throughout).<br>
In a multi-hop communication system, communication signals are sent in a<br>
communication direction along a communication path (C) from a source apparatus to a<br>
destination apparatus via one or more intermediate apparatuses. Figure 5 illustrates a<br>
single-cell two-hop wireless communication system comprising a base station BS<br>
(known in the context of 3G communication systems as "node-B" NB) a relay node RN<br>
(also known as a relay station RS) and a user equipment UE (also known as mobile<br>
station MS). In the case where signals are being transmitted on the downlink (DL) from<br>
a base station to a destination user equipment (UE) via the reiay node (RN), the base<br>
station comprises the source station (S) and the user equipment comprises the<br>
destination station (D). In the case where communication signals are being transmitted<br>
on the uplink (UL) from a user equipment (UE), via the relay node, to the base station,<br>
the user equipment comprises the source station and the base station comprises the<br>
destination station. The relay node is an example of an intermediate apparatus (I) and<br>
comprises: a receiver, operable to receive data from the source apparatus; and a<br>
transmitter, operable to transmit this data, or a derivative thereof, to the destination<br>
apparatus.<br>
Simple analogue repeaters or digital repeaters have been used as relays to improve or<br>
provide coverage in dead spots. They can either operate in a different transmission<br>
frequency band from the source station to prevent interference between the source<br>
transmission and the repeater transmission, or they can operate at a time when there<br>
is no transmission from the source station.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates a number of applications for relay stations. For fixed infrastructure,<br>
the coverage provided by a relay station may be "inâ€”fill" to allow access to the<br>
communication network for mobile stations which may otherwise be in the shadow of<br>
other objects or otherwise unable to receive a signal of sufficient strength from the<br>
base station despite being within the normal range of the base station. "Range<br>
extension" is also shown, in which a relay station allows access when a mobile station<br>
is outside the normal data transmission range of a base station. One example of in-fill<br>
shown at the top right of Figure 6 is positioning of a nomadic relay station to allow<br>
penetration of coverage within a building thai could be above, at, or below ground level.<br>
Other applications are nomadic relay stations which are brought into effect for<br>
temporary cover, providing access during events or emergencies/disasters. A final<br>
application shown in the bottom right of Figure 6 provides access to a network using a<br>
relay positioned on a vehicle.<br>
Relays may also be used in conjunction with advanced transmission techniques to<br>
enhance gain of the communications system as explained below.<br>
It is known that the occurrence of propagation loss, or "pathloss", due to the scattering<br>
or absorption of a radio communication as it travels through space, causes the strength<br>
of a signal to diminish. Factors which influence the pathloss between a transmitter and<br>
a receiver include: transmitter antenna height, receiver antenna height, carrier<br>
frequency, clutter type (urban, sub-urban, rural), details of morphology such as height,<br>
density, separation, terrain type (hilly, flat). The pathloss L (dB) between a transmitter<br>
and a receiver can be modelled by:<br>
 (A)<br>
Where d (metres) is the transmitter-receiver separation, b(db) and n are the pathloss<br>
parameters and the absolute pathloss is given by <br>
The sum of the absolute path losses experienced over the indirect link SI + ID may be<br>
less than the pathloss experienced over the direct link SD. In other words it is possible<br>
for:<br>
 (B)<br>
Splitting a single transmission iink into two shorter transmission segments therefore<br>
exploits the non-linear relationship between pathloss verses distance. From a simple<br>
theoretical analysis of the pathloss using equation (A), it can be appreciated that a<br>
reduction in the overall pathloss (and therefore an improvement, or gain, in signal<br>
strength and thus data throughput) can be achieved if a signal is sent from a source<br>
apparatus to a destination apparatus via an intermediate apparatus (e.g. relay node),<br>
rather than being sent directly from the source apparatus to the destination apparatus.<br>
If implemented appropriately, multi-hop communication systems can allow for a<br>
reduction in the transmit power of transmitters which facilitate wireless transmissions,<br>
leading to a reduction in interference levels as well as decreasing exposure to<br>
electromagnetic emissions. Alternatively, the reduction in overall pathloss can be<br>
exploited to improve the received signal quality at the receiver without an increase in<br>
the overall radiated transmission power required to convey the signal.<br>
Multi-hop systems are suitable for use with multi-carrier transmission. In a multi-carrier<br>
transmission system, such as FDM (frequency division multiplex), OFDM (orthogonal<br>
frequency division multiplex) or DMT (discrete multi-tone), a single data stream is<br>
modulated onto N parallel sub-carriers, each sub-carrier signal having its own<br>
frequency range. This allows the total bandwidth (i.e. the amount of data to be sent in<br>
a given time interval) to be divided over a plurality of sub-carriers thereby increasing<br>
the duration of each data symbol. Since each sub-carrier has a lower information rate,<br>
multi-carrier systems benefit from enhanced immunity to channel induced distortion<br>
compared with single carrier systems. This is made possible by ensuring that the<br>
transmission rate and hence bandwidth of each subcarrier is less than the coherence<br>
bandwidth of the channel. As a result, the channel distortion experienced on a signal<br>
subcarrier is frequency independent and can hence be corrected by a simple phase<br>
and amplitude correction factor. Thus the channel distortion correction entity within a<br>
multicarrier receiver can be of significantly lower complexity of its counterpart within a<br>
single carrier receiver when the system bandwidth is in excess of the coherence<br>
bandwidth of the channel.<br>
Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a modulation technique that is<br>
based on FDM. An OFDM system uses a plurality of sub-carrier frequencies which are<br>
orthogonal in a mathematical sense so that the sub-carriers' spectra may overlap<br>
without interference due to the fact they are mutually independent. The orthogonality<br>
of OFDM systems removes the need for guard band frequencies and thereby increases<br>
the spectral efficiency of the system. OFDM has been proposed and adopted for many<br>
wireless systems. It is currently used in Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL)<br>
connections, in some wireless LAN applications (such as WiFi devices based on the<br>
IEEE802.11a/g standard), and in wireless MAN applications such as WiMAX (based on<br>
the IEEE 802.16 standard). OFDM is often used in conjunction with channel coding, an<br>
error correction technique, to create coded orthogonal FDM or COFDM. COFDM is<br>
now widely used in digital telecommunications systems to improve the performance of<br>
an OFDM based system in a multipath environment where variations in the channel<br>
distortion can be seen across both subcarriers in the frequency domain and symbols in<br>
the time domain. The system has found use in video and audio broadcasting, such as<br>
DVB and DAB, as well as certain types of computer networking technology.<br>
In an OFDM system, a block of N modulated parallel data source signals is mapped to<br>
N orthogonal parallel sub-carriers by using an Inverse Discrete or Fast Fourier<br>
Transform algorithm (IDFT/IFFT) to form a signal known as an "OFDM symbol" in the<br>
time domain at the transmitter. Thus, an "OFDM symbol" is the composite signal of all<br>
N sub-carrier signals. An OFDM symbol can be represented mathematically as:<br><br>
where A/ is the sub-carrier separation in Hz, Ts = 1/A/ is symbol time interval in<br>
seconds, and cn are the modulated source signals. The sub-carrier vector in (1) onto<br>
which each of the source signals is modulated is a vector of N<br>
constellation symbols from a finite constellation. At the receiver, the received time-<br>
domain signal is transformed back to frequency domain by applying Discrete Fourier<br>
Transform (DFT) or Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm.<br>
OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) is a multiple access variant<br>
of OFDM. It works by assigning a subset of sub-carriers, to an individual user. This<br>
allows simultaneous transmission from several users leading to better spectral<br>
efficiency. However, there is still the issue of allowing bi-directional communication,<br>
that is, in the uplink and download directions, without interference.<br>
In order to enable bi-directional communication between two nodes, two well known<br>
different approaches exist for duplexing the two (forward or download and reverse or<br>
uplink) communication links to overcome the physical limitation that a device cannot<br>
simultaneously transmit and receive on the same resource medium. The first,<br>
frequency division duplexing (FDD), involves operating the two links simultaneously but<br>
on different frequency bands by subdividing the transmission medium into two distinct<br>
bands, one for forward link and the other for reverse link communications. The second,<br>
time division duplexing (TDD), involves operating the two links on the same frequency<br>
band, but subdividing the access to the medium in time so that only the forward or the<br>
reverse link will be utilizing the medium at any one point in time. Both approaches<br>
(TDD &amp; FDD) have their relative merits and are both well used techniques for single<br>
hop wired and wireless communication systems. For example the IEEE802.16<br>
standard incorporates both an FDD and TDD mode.<br>
As an example, Figure 7 illustrates the single hop TDD frame structure used in the<br>
OFDMA physical layer mode of the IEEE802.16 standard (WiMAX).<br>
Each frame is divided into DL and UL subframes, each being a discrete transmission<br>
interval. They are separated by Transmit/Receive and Receive/Transmit Transition<br>
Guard interval (TTG and RTG respectively). Each DL subframe starts with a preamble<br>
followed by the Frame Control Header (FCH), the DL-MAP, and the UL-MAP.<br>
The FCH contains the DL Frame Prefix (DLFP) to specify the burst profile and the<br>
length of the DL-MAP. The DLFP is a data structure transmitted at the beginning of<br>
each frame and contains information regarding the current frame; it is mapped to the<br>
FCH.<br>
Simultaneous DL allocations can be broadcast, multicast and unicast and they can also<br>
include an allocation for another BS rather than a serving BS. Simultaneous ULs can<br>
be data allocations and ranging or bandwidth requests.<br>

techniques. The entire contents of each of the other nine applications is incorporated<br>

filed herewith.<br>
In legacy single hop systems (e.g. 802.16-2004 and 802.16e-2005), standard network<br>
entry procedures already exist for an MS entering a network. However, as there is no<br>
concept of an RS in these systems, no suitable network entry procedure is defined.<br>
Embodiments of the invention are suitable as a standard network entry algorithm in the<br>
case that it is an RS entering the network.<br>
The invention is defined in the independent claims, to which reference should now be<br>
made. Advantageous embodiments are set out in the sub claims.<br>
Preferred features of the present invention will now be described, purely by way of<br>
example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:-<br>
Figure 1 shows Standard MS network entry procedure:<br>
Figure 2 shows Modification for capability negotiation;<br>
Figure 3 shows Modification for obtaining RS uplink parameters;<br>
Figure 4 shows Modification for switch uplink parameter usage;<br>
Figure 5 shows a single-cell two-hop wireless communication system;<br>
Figure 6 shows applications of relay stations; and<br>
Figure 7 shows a single hop TDD frame structure used in the OFDMA physical layer<br>
mode of the IEEE 802.16 standard.<br>
RS Network Entry Procedure<br>
The first stage is for the RS to follow the standard MS network entry procedure in order<br>
to establish a connection with the BS. An example of the network entry procedure for<br>
the case of the 802.16 system is given in Section 6.3.9 of the standard. Figure 1<br>
summarises these procedures that are detailed further in the standard.<br>
Throughout it is assumed that the network could consist of some legacy BS and some<br>
relaying enabled BS. It is also assumed that a relaying enabled BS may be operating<br>
in a legacy mode until it receives a request from an RS for it to enter the network. The<br>
reason the BS may operate in such a mode would be to preserve transmission<br>
resources by not having to broadcast relay specific information when there are no<br>
relays benefiting from the transmission.<br>
The first modification to the sequence above is that during the negotiation of basic<br>
capabilities the RS will identify itself as an RS to the BS using a new signalling entity<br>
(referred to as a TLV) that indicates that the device registering has the capability to act<br>
as a relay. Amongst other parameters the relay shall identify its capability to act as a<br>
relay on DL and/or UL traffic. It shall also declare the type of relaying supported (i.e.<br>
transparent or not). The required processes that need to be included into the<br>
procedure shown in Figure 1 are shown in Figure 2 in underlined text.<br>
As a result, the BS will now know that the connecting device is an RS, if it completes<br>
this stage. If the BS is a legacy BS then it will not complete this stage as it will not<br>
acknowledge the use of the extended relay related capabilities. However the RS may<br>
continue the network entry procedure as it may be able to operate in an alternative<br>
mode that does not require the BS to have knowledge that it is a RS and not an MS.<br>
If the RS is to perform uplink relaying (as identified above) then the second<br>
modification is that at some point between the RS becoming successfully registered<br>
with the BS and the RS becoming operational it will require the BS to inform it of the<br>
RS specific uplink parameters. In particular, this is required as during the normal<br>
ranging region, the RS will have to be receiving signals from MS or other RS and<br>
hence cannot be transmitting to the BS.<br>
It is assumed that if the BS is not already advertising these parameters through an<br>
appropriate message, it will at least start once it is aware that an RS is entering the<br>
network as determined during the RS capability negotiation stage. Therefore if the RS<br>
cannot determine the RS specific uplink parameters because they are not being<br>
advertised by the BS (usually after a timeout period of waiting for the parameters to be<br>
broadcast) it will assume that the BS does not support RSs (i.e. it is a legacy BS) and<br>
will mark the downlink channel associated with this BS as unusuable and restart the<br>
network entry procedure scanning for other potential downlink channels.<br>
The required processes that need to be included into the procedure shown in Figure 1<br>
are shown in Figure 3 in underlined text.<br>
Once the RS uplink parameters are identified the RS then switches to using these new<br>
parameters on the uplink prior to becoming operational. This is required before the RS<br>
is operational and is the final amendment required to the procedure shown in Figure 1,<br>
as shown in Figure 4 in underlined text.<br>
The RS completes the network entry procedure and now becomes operational,<br>
receiving the preamble to maintain synchronisation and the DL and UL-MAP messages<br>
to understand the allocation of resources within the frame for communication with the<br>
MS and BS.<br>
Extension for the case of RS transmitting a preamble<br>
If the RS is required to provide transmission of broadcast control information (i.e. the<br>
MS cannot receive this information directly from the BS or RS to which the RS is<br>
connecting) then prior to becoming operational one final step is required. In this case,<br>
the BS or RS will have identified to the RS during the capability negotiating phase that<br>
the RS should operate in such a mode. The RS will then stop listening to the normal<br>
preamble and MAP messages, so that it can transmit its own. Instead, it will ascertain<br>
from the BS or RS to which it is connecting the location of the relay amble, or other RS<br>
specific information signal that can be used to identify the transmitter and train the<br>
various distortion correction units within the receiver in the absence of the preamble<br>
knowledge.<br>
At this point the RS can then begin to broadcast the normal preamble and as and when<br>
required, the MAP messages.<br>
During operation the RS continually monitors the RS uplink parameters and other RS<br>
specific information signals on the downlink (i.e. Relay Amble and control information)<br>
as the BS or RS may change these based on the dynamically changing operational<br>
environment. For example, as more uplink channels are required to report HARQ<br>
related ACK/NACKs, channel quality reports or increase the ranging region.<br>
Benefits<br>
In summary the benefits of invention embodiments are:<br>
o Defines a simple modification to an existing procedure that supports the entry of<br>
both MS and RS into a communication network.<br>
o Minimises the impact on existing BS designs as the number of modifications<br>
required are minimal.<br>
o Enables the RS to closely mimic the procedure already developed and in use in<br>
the MS, thus enabling reuse of existing software developed to support network<br>
entry procedures in the MS.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention may be implemented in hardware, or as<br>
software modules running on one or more processors, or on a combination thereof.<br>
That is, those skilled in the art will appreciate that a microprocessor or digital signal<br>
processor (DSP) may be used in practice to implement some or all of the functionality<br>
of a transmitter embodying the present invention. The invention may also be embodied<br>

program products) for carrying out part or all of any of the methods described herein.<br>
