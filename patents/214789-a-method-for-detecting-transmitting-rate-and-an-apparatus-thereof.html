				<td>APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR DETECTING TRANSMITTING RATE OF TURBO DECODER<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to an apparatus and method for detecting a data rate, and in particular, to an apparatus and method for detecting a data rate of a turbo decoder in a mobile communication system.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In general, an encoder and a decoder are used in a digital mobile communication system to correct an error of a forward channel. The digital mobile communication system transmits and receives data in a radio environment, so it employs a coding technique to prevent generation of noises in a transmission channel. The mobile communication system typically uses a turbo coding technique for the coding technique.<br>
3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Projection) or 3GPP2 (3rd Generation Partnership Projection 2), an ongoing standardization work on the mobile communication system, specifies that transmission data can be transmitted at different data rates. Here, the data rate depends upon a length (or size) of a frame decoded by a turbo decoder. For example, a data rate of 2.4 Kbps corresponds to a decoded frame length of 24 bits/frame, and a data rate of 4.8 Kbps corresponds to a decoded frame length of 48 bits/frame.<br>
When transmitting data at various data rates, a transmitter generally transmits the data to a receiver along with information on a data rate of the currently transmitted data. However, transmitting the data along with the data rate of the transmission data causes a waste of transmission power, especially when the transmission data has a low data rate. Therefore, there is a demand for a method for transmitting data without information on its data rate.<br>
There is a known blind rate detection (BRD) technique, in which a<br><br>
transmitter transmits data without information on its data rate and a receiver detects the data rate based on only the received data. When data is transmitted in the BRD mode after being subject to turbo encoding, the results of CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Code) checking performed on an output of a turbo decoder are typically used to detect a data rate.<br>
That is, the transmitter adds CRC information to transmission data before transmission. Then, a channel decoder of the receiver decodes the received data at all of its available data rates and determines whether the decoded data includes noises, through CRC checking. If it is determined through the CRC checking performed at a specific data rate mat the frame is not damaged, the receiver detects the corresponding data rate. A procedure for detecting a data rate by the receiver using the CRC checking will be described in detail with reference to FIG. 1.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a procedure for detecting a data rate by a receiver through CRC checking of the BRD technique in a mobile communication system according to the prior art. A detailed description of the conventional procedure for detecting a data rate will now be made with reference to FIG. 1.<br>
*<br>
In step 10, the receiver performing the turbo decoding receives frame data over a radio channel; In this procedure, a description of a radio processing process and a channel decoding process will not be provided. After receiving the frame data, the receiver sets count values i and j to '0', in step 12. Here, i represents a value for counting a decoding iteration number (or decoding frequency) to perform turbo decoding on one frame at a selected data rate. Further, j represents a value for counting the number of types of the data rates. That is, if the turbo decoding is iteratively performed 6 times, the i value â€¢ represents a decoding iteration count value for limiting the turbo decoding to be performed up to 6 times, and if the number of the types of the data rates is 7, the j value represents a data rate type count value for performing the decoding at up to 7 data rates.<br>
After the step 12, the receiver sets an iteration limit number to its<br><br>
. maximum value in step 14. Here, the "'iteration limit number" refers to the maximum number of iterative decoding at a specific data rate, i.e., a value for setting a threshold for the iteration count value 'i' of the turbo decoder. In step 16, the receiver performs turbo decoding at a data rate set to the j value. For example., if decoding on voice data is performed at 2 Kbps, 4 Kbps and 8 Kbps, then the receiver performs the decoding on the data with a frame length FL(j) associated with 2 Kbps or 8 Kbps, whichever determined first. That is, the receiver performs the decoding at one initial data rate.<br>
After the decoding, the receiver analyzes the result of CRC checking performed on the decoded data in step 18. As the result of the analysis, if it is determined that the CRC is 'good', the receiver performs a data rate detection process for the current j value in step 20. Otherwise, the receiver determines whether the decoding iteration count value i is less than the iteration limit number, in order to iterate the decoding up to the iteration limit number. As the result of the determination, if the decoding iteration count value i is less than the iteration limit number, the receiver proceeds to step 24, and otherwise, proceeds to step 26. In the step 24, the receiver increases the decoding iteration count. value i by 1, and then returns to the step 16. The reason for iteratively performing the decoding at one data rate will be described with reference to FIGs. 2 and 3.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates distribution of a decoding state value m(i) indicating the quality of a data frame when data with a frame size 60 transmitted over a radio channel is subject to iterative turbo decoding by a turbo decoder with a frame size 60. FIG. 3 illustrates distribution of an  m(i) value when data with a frame size 40 transmitted over a radio channel is subject to iterative "turbo decoding by a turbo decoder with a frame size .60.<br>
In FIG. 2, a part represented by a solid line represents a part having an m(i) value of correctly decoded frame, while a part represented by dots represents an incorrectly decoded part. When performing the decoding for second time, the receiver iteratively performs the decoding for restoration, using the incorrectly decoded frames represented by the dots. Then, the incorrectly decoded frames are divided again into restored frames and non-restored frames,<br><br>
as shown in a second graph of FIG. 2. If the'process is iterated several times, the frame data will be more correctly decoded, thus increasing a probability that the CRC will be detected in a 'good' state. However, in the case where the data is decoded with a frame length associated with another data rate, even though the decoding is performed several times, the decoding results will continuously show an error state as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
Turning back to FIG. 1, the iterative limit number is typically set to 6. If the CRC is not 'good' after iterating the decoding six times at one data rate, the receiver determines in step 26 whether the data rate type count value j is larger than the number N of the data rates. As the result of the determination, if the data rate type count value j is not less than the number N, e.g., 3, of the data rates, the receiver proceeds to step 28 to perform a data rate detection failure process, considering that the decoding and the CRC checking have been completed for all of the available data rates. However, if the count value j indicates that the decoding has not yet performed at all of the data rates, i.e., if the j value is less than N, the receiver increases the count value j by 1 and sets the decoding iteration count value i to 0 in step 30, and then returns to the step 16 to repeat the steps 16 to 30.<br>
However, the turbo decoding technique for detecting a data rate through the above process causes a waste of time in detecting the data rate, especially when there is a great difference between a data rate at which the data frame has been transmitted and the initial data rate at which the turbo decoding is performed. That is, for example, if it is assumed that the number of the data rates to be detected is N and the iteration number is 8, the decoding is performed (N-1)*8 times at the worst. In addition, an increase in the number of the data rates for the transmission data causes an increase in the detection time and also causes an increase in power consumption for detecting the data rate.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail herein below with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates a block diagram of a radio receiver for performing turbo decoding according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. A -structure and operation of the radio receiver for performing the turbo decoding according to the present invention will be described in detail with reference to FIG. 4.<br>
A radio signal transmitted from a transmitter is received at an antenna<br><br>
ANT of the receiver through a radio environment. A demodulator 101 then demodulates the radio signal. A signal output from the demodulator 101 is descrambled and despread by a descrambler and despreader 103. The output signal is provided to a buffer 105. The buffer 105 sequentially buffers the received signal according to the order of decoding and provides its output to a decoder 107.<br>
Tne decoder 107, a turbo decoder .according to the present invention, performs decoding according to a data rate (i.e., frame length) determined by a data rate determiner 115. The frame length of actual data transmitted and received in the mobile communication system becomes 39,42, 49, 55, 58, 61, 65, 75 and 81 bits. For example, when the data rate determiner 115 desires to perform the decoding with, a frame length of 39 bits, the turbo decoder 107 reads a data frame with a length of 39 bits from the buffer 105 and decodes the read data frame. The decoded data is provided to a CRC detector 109 and a decoding state measurer 111.<br>
The CRC detector 109 performs hard decision and CRC checking on the output of the turbo decoder 107, and provides the CRC checking result to a controller 113. The decoding state measurer 111 measures decoding quality for the output of the turbo decoder 107, and provides the measured result to the controller 113. Based on the result values, the controller 113 manages a decoding iteration count value i, an iteration limit number, a data rate type count value j and the number N of the data rates, and detects a data rate transmitted from the transmitter. In addition, the controller 113 creates a signal to be provided to the data rate determiner 115 by receiving a value calculated by the decoding state measurer 111. The data rate determiner 115 determines the frame length associated with a data rate for the decoding based on a signal provided from the controller 113, and provides the determined frame length to the turbo decoder . 107.<br>
A control operation of the radio receiver having the above structure will be described with reference to FIGs. 5 to 8.<br><br>
FIG. 5 illustrates a procedure for detecting a data rate in a BRD mode by a receiver performing turbo decoding according to a first embodiment of the present invention. A detailed description of a method for detecting a data rate using CRC checking of the BRD technique by the receiver will be described with reference to FIGs. 4 and 5.<br>
In step 200, the controller 113 sets a decoding iteration count value i and a data rate type count value j to 0. For example, if the data frame with a length of 39, 42, 49, 55, 58, 61, 65, 75 and 81 bits can be transmitted through a radio channel, then the number N of the types of the data rates is 9 and the j value will be counted from 0 to 8. A data rate for decoding, i.e., the frame length is determined based on .the j value. The frame length FL(j) associated with the data rate type count value j determined by the controller 113 is provided to the decoder 107 from the data rate determiner 115. In step 202, the controller 111 sets an iteration limit number to a predetermined minimum value. This is to perform the iterative decoding as minimum times as possible each time the data rate FL(j) is changed.<br>
In step 204, the turbo decoder 107 decodes a data stream read from the buffer 105 using the FL(j) provided from the data rate determiner 115, and provides the decoded data to the CRC detector 109 and the decoding state measurer 111. The output of the turbo decoder 107 is a non-binary soft output value. The CRC detector 109 performs hard decision and CRC checking on the decoded data, and the decoding state measurer 111 measures a stale (or quality) of the decoded data.<br>
The controller 113 determines in step 206 whether the decoding iteration count value i is less than the iteration limit number set in the step 202. As the result of the determination, if the decoding iteration count value i is less than the iteration limit number, the controller 113 proceeds to step 208, and otherwise proceeds to step 216.<br>
In the step 208, the controller 113 calculates a decoding state value m(i) indicating quality of the currently decoded frame and an under-decoding state<br><br><br>
value Î”(i) defined as a difference between' a decoding state value during current decoding and a decoding state value during previous decoding. The m(i) value is calculated by<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
In Equation (1), | | represents an absolute value, and 'a' and :b! represent given constants, where 0 
In addition, the under-decoding state value Î”(i) is calculated by<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
In the formula, m(i) represents a decoding state value during the current decoding and m(i-l) represents a decoding state value during the previous decoding. As a result, it is noted that Î”(i) indicates how much the decoding quality is improved, by the iterative decoding at one data rate. Here, the Î”(i) is '0' during initial decoding.<br><br>
Based on Equation (2), FIG, 6 illustrates a change in the Î”(i) when an input frame length (an actual data rate to be used during transmission) is identical to a decoder frame length (a data rate used during the current decoding). It is noted herein that iteration of the decoding causes a change in the Î”(i). Further, FIG. 7 illustrates a change in the Î”(i) when the input frame length is not identical to the decoder frame length. It is noted herein that the Î”(i) is not changed even though the decoding is iterated. As illustrated, a change in the Î”(i) becomes a basis for determining whether a data rate is detected.<br>
After calculating the m(i) value and the Î”(i) value based on Equations (1) and (2) in the step 208, the controller 113 determines hi step 210 whether the m(i) value is larger than a first threshold. As the result of the determination, if the m(i) value is larger than the first threshold, the controller 113 proceeds to step 214, and otherwise proceeds to step 212. Here, the first threshold can be set to the minimum value among the values having a high probability that the m(i) will be normally decoded. The controller 113 determines in step 212 whether the Î”(i) value is larger than a second threshold. Likewise, the second threshold can be set to the minimum value among the values having a high probability that the Î”(i) will be normally decoded. As the result of the determination, if the Î”(i) is larger than the second threshold, the controller 113 proceeds to step 214, and otherwise proceeds to step 216.<br>
In the step 214, the controller 113 changes the iteration limit number to its maximum value, considering that it is necessary to iterate the decoding as many times as possible, and then proceeds to step 216.<br>
In the step 216, the controller 113 determines whether the CRC checking result received from the CRC detector 109 is 'good'. If the CRC checking result is 'good', the controller 113 performs a data rate detection success process in step 218. That is, the controller 113 determines the data rate used during the decoding process of the step 204 as an actual data rate transmitted from the transmitter.<br>
However, if the CRC checking result is not 'good', the controller 113 determines in step 220 whether the decoding iteration count value i is less than<br><br>
the iteration limit number. As the result of the determination, if the i value is less than the iteration limit number, the controller 113 increase the i value by 1 in step 222, and then returns to the step 202. However, if the i value is not less than the iteration limit number, i.e., if the turbo decoding has already been performed as many times as the set iteration limit number, the controller 113 determines in step 224 whether the data rate type count value j is less than the number N of the types of the frames. As the result of the determination, if the j value is less than the number of the types of the frames, the controller 113 increases the data rate type count value j by 1 and sets the decoding iteration count value i to 0 in step 228, and then returns to the step 202. However, if the j value is not less than the number N of the data rates, the controller 113 performs a data rate detection failure process in step 226.<br>
Summarizing the above processes, when the count values i and j and the decoder frame size are determined, the decoder 107 performs decoding by first setting the iteration limit number to its minimum value. If one of the m(i) value and the Î”(i) value is larger than its associated threshold, the controller 113 increases the iteration limit number to its maximum value, considering that there is a high probability that the CRC checking result will be 'good' for the current frame size, and then attempts to detect a data rate by performing CRC checking on every decoding result after increasing the iteration limit number to its maximum value. If the CRC checking result is not 'good' even though the decoding is iterated as many times as the maximum iteration limit number, the controller 113 considers that the data rate used for the current decoding is not identical to a data rate used during the transmission. In the case where the data rate is selected in error, the probability that the m(i) value or the Î”(i) value will be larger than then: associated thresholds, is almost close to 0. Thus, the decoding at the current data rate will be iterated as many times as the minimum iteration limit number.<br>
If the m(i) value or the Î”(i) value are larger than their associated thresholds, it can be considered that there is a very high probability that the data rate will be detected even though the initial CRC checking result is not 'good'. Therefore, the decoding at the current data rate is iterated as many times as<br><br>
possible. As described above, the receiver according to the present invention reduces time and power required for detecting a data rate by iteratively decoding the data rate with the lower probability as many times as the minimum iteration limit number and iteratively decoding the data rate with the higher probability as many times as the maximum iteration limit number.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates a procedure for detecting a data rate in the BRD mode by a receiver performing turbo decoding according to a second embodiment of the present invention. A detailed description of the procedure for detecting a data rate according to the second embodiment of the present invention will be made with reference to FIGs. 4 and 8.<br>
Steps 300 to 304 of FIG. 8 are equal in operation to the steps 200 to 204 of FIG. 5, so the description will be omitted for simplicity. The controller 113 determines in step 306 whether the decoding iteration count value i is less than the iteration limit number.<br>
As the result of the determination, if the decoding iteration count value i is less than the iteration limit number, the decoding state measurer 111 calculates<br>
the m(i) and the Î”(i) using the data decoded by the decoder 107 in step 308. The<br>
m(i) and the Î”(i) are calculated based on Equations (1) and (2), respectively.<br>
After the calculation, the controller 113. determines in step 310 whether the decoding iteration count value i is equal to 0. If the decoding iteration count value i is equal to 0, the m(i) and the Î”(i) are not required, since the decoding is initial decoding. Therefore, in this case, the controller 113 proceeds to step 320. â€¢However, if the decoding iteration count value i is not 0, the controller 113 determines in step 312 whether the m(i) value is larger than a first threshold. In step 314, the controller 113 sets the iteration limit number to its maximum value and then proceeds to step 320. However, if the m(i) value is not larger than the first threshold, the controller 113 determines in step 316 whether the Î”(i) value larger than a second threshold. As the result of the determination, if the A(i) is . larger than the second threshold, the controller 113 proceeds to step 318, and otherwise proceeds to step 324.<br><br>
In the step 318, the controller 113 sets the iteration limit number to a predetermined intermediate value. Herein, for example, the minimum value can be set to 2 or 3, the intermediate value can be set to 5, and the maximum value can be set to 8. After setting the iteration limit number, the controller 113 determines whether a CRC state is 'good', by using CRC checking results received from the CRC detector 109. As the result of the determination, if the CRC state is 'good', the controller 113 performs a data rate detection success process in step 322. That is, the controller 113 determines the data rate used during the decoding of the step 304 as a data rate transmitted from the transmitter. However, if the CRC is not 'good', the controller 113 determines in step 324 whether the decoding iteration count value i is less than the iteration limit number.<br>
As the result of the determination, if the decoding iteration count value i is less than the iteration limit number, the controller 113 increases the decoding<br>
'	*â€¢ ^P<br>
iteration count value i by 1 in step 326, and then returns to the step 304. However, if the decoding iteration count value i is not less than the iteration limit number, the controller 113 determines in step 328 whether the data rate type count value j is less than the number N of the data rates. As the result of the determination, if the data rate type count value j is not less than the number N of the data rates, the controller 113 performs a data rate detection failure process in step 330. However, if the data rate type count value j is Jess than the number N of the data rates, the controller 113 increases the j value by 1 and sets the decoding iteration count value i to 0 in step 332, and then returns to the step 302.<br>
In FIG. 8, unlike in FIG. 5, if the m(i) value is larger than the first threshold, the iteration limit number is set to its maximum value, and if the m(i) value is not larger than the first threshold and the Î”(i) value is larger than the second threshold, the iteration limit number is set to its intermediate value. That is, if there is a high probability that the data rate can be detected, the iteration limit number is set to its maximum value, and otherwise, the iteration limit number is set to its intermediate value, thereby making it possible to detect the data rate more rapidly.<br><br>
In addition, in FIG. 8, unlike in FIG. 5, if the m(i) value is not larger than the first threshold and the Î”(i) value is not larger than the second threshold, the CRC checking is not performed. This is because it can be considered that there is a very low probability that the data rate will be detected, when both, of the m(i) value and the Î”(i) value are not larger than their associated thresholds. Another reason is because the CRC checking result may become 'good' even though the 'input frame length is not identical to the decoder frame length due to serious damage of a received data frame. In this case, an incorrect data rate may be detected.<br>
Shown in Table 1 are the iteration limit numbers based on the m(i) and the Î”(i) for the first embodiment of FIG. 5 and the second embodiment of FIG. 8.<br>
