This application claims priority to United States Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/640,160, filed December 29, 2004, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INEVNTION<br>
A number of disease conditions are associated with the action of bacteria in the oral cavity. For example, gingivitis, an inflammation or infection of the gums and alveolar bones, is generally believed to be caused by plaque causing bacterial and the toxins formed as by-products from the bacteria.  In addition, plaque provides a locus for calculus or tartar formation. Periodontitis is generally believed to occur where unremoved plaque hardens into calculus (tartar), which affects the periodontal ligaments. As plaque and tartar continue to build up, the gums begin to recede, which can lead to continued inflammation, infection and potentially the loss of teeth.<br>
To prevent or treat these diseased conditions, antibacterial agents may be incorporated into oral care compositions such as toothpaste and mouthwashes or rinses. Application of antibacterial compositions in the oral cavity tends to retard plaque formation and related oral infections.   It is also common to provide oral compositions containing components that remove or prevent the build-up of tartar. Effective antitartar agents, such as phosphates, are believed to work in-part by interfering with crystalline growth of hydroxyapatite on the tooth surface.<br>
The antiplaque efficacy of antibacterial compounds in a dentifrice composition depends on a number of factors, including the presence of other ingredients that may interfere with its action. For example, certain cationic antibacterial compounds and certain nonionic antibacterial compounds lose their effectiveness when formulated with certain anionic surfactants or other anionic active ingredients, such as tartar control phosphates. In many instances, it is preferred to use antibacterial compounds that do not show the adverse interactions with such anionic components.<br>
Extracts from Magnolia officinalis(hereinafter "magnolia"), and especially from the bark, contain biphenol antibacterial compounds.  The extracts have been<br>
found to have antibacterial effectiveness when formulated into, for example, toothpaste formulations.<br>
Extracts prepared from natural sources such as magnolia are variable in composition and may contain many compounds other than the particular actives for which the extract is prepared.  In addition, the composition of the extracts can vary from season to season and between different geographical regions. For these many reasons, it may be desirable to synthesize naturally occurring products such as those found in magnolia extracts.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is based in part on the discovery that a particular analog of magnolol —  5,5'-dibutyl-2,2'-dihydroxy-l,r-biphenyl — is effective as an antiplaque and antibacterial component of dentifrices and other oral compositions. The invention relates to various oral compositions containing the compound and an orally acceptable carrier.  In various embodiments, antibacterial and antiplaque oral compositions are provided in the form of a paste or gel, a powder, a mouthwash or mouth rinse, a lozenge, chewing gum, an edible strip, and the like. The antibacterial compound is synthesized by Friedel-Crafts type acylation of a biphenol compound, followed by reduction to the end product.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The invention provides a new antibacterial compound 5,5'-dibutyl-2,2'-dihydroxy-1,1 '-biphenyl represented by the structure of formula (I), given below:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein any/all of the carbon atoms may be independently subsititued or unsubsititued.<br>
Antiplaque oral compositions are provided that contain an orally acceptable carrier and an antibacterial effective amount of the compound of formula (I) are also included.  In various embodiments, the compositions contain from about 0.001% to about 10% by weight of the compound of formula (I). Without limitation, the orally acceptable carrier is a liquid carrier; a powder carrier; or a carrier that dissolves upon contact<br>
with saliva and other components of an oral environment, such as, for example a film.   In other embodiments, the carrier can comprise a gum base. The oral compositions are provided variously in the form of a paste or gel, a powder, a mouth rinse, a lozenge, chewing gum, and an edible strip. Other forms ofthe composition include without limitation a liquid suitable for painting a dental surface, a wafer, a wipe or towelette, an implant, a dental floss, and forms that are edible or chewable by a small domestic animal such as a cat.<br>
In other embodiments, the invention provides paste or gel compositions that contain at least one humectant, at least one abrasive material, and an antibacterial effective amount of the compound of formula (I). The paste or gel compositions may further comprise an anticalculus agent such as a phosphate compound, alternatively combined with synthetic anionic polycarboxylates.   In an exemplary embodiment, the paste or gel composition comprises, for example:<br>
0.001 - 5% by weight of compound of formula (I);<br>
! -70% by weight humectant;<br>
1 -70%by weight abrasive compounds;<br>
0.5-2.5% by weight tetrasodium pyrophosphate (TSPP); and<br>
-10% by weight sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP).<br>
In other embodiments, the invention provides a method for inhibiting bacterial growth in the oral cavity of a subject animal, comprising applying to the oral surfaces of the subject animal an antibacterial composition comprising the compound of formula (I). In various embodiments, the method involves brushing the teeth, rinsing and/or applying to the oral surfaces compositions containing the compound of formula (I). As above, the method can be practiced by applying the antibacterial composition in a wide variety of forms such as pastes, gels, powder, mouth rinse, paint on gels, dissolvable or edible strips or films, chewing gum, lozenges, and the like.<br>
In various embodiments, treatment of oral surfaces with antibacterial compositions containing the compound of formula (I) leads to reduction or elimination of plaque, to prevention or treatment of gingivitis, to amelioration of oral malodor, and prevention ofperiodontal disease. The MIC   of the compound of formula (I) has been found to be lower against certain oral bacteria than an analogous compound containing propyl groups.<br>
The methods ofpreparing the compound of formula (I) include a step of<br>
reacting 2,2'-dihydroxy-1,1'-biphenyl with a butanoyl halide, such as butanoyl chloride, in the presence of a Lewis acid to form a carbonyl functional intermediate.   Thereafter, the carbonyl functional intermediate is reduced to obtain the compound of formula (I).<br>
Synthesis of the compound of formula (I) may be illustrated by th( following scheme:<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
In a first step, a 2,2'-dihydroxy-l,l'-biphenyl is reacted with an alkanoyl halide (illustrated as, e.g., butanoyl chloride) containing four carbons in the presence of a Lewis acid (illustrated as, e.g.,  aluminum chloride). The reaction product is a carbonyl functional intermediate (III).   The carbonyl functional intermediate is next reduced with conventional reducing agents to yield the final product (I). As shown in the scheme, reduction is accomplished by refluxing in acetic acid and HC1 in the presence of a zinc mercury amalgam as a reducing agent (Clemmensen reduction). Other Lewis acids can be used in the first step, and other reducing agents can be used in the second step.   Lewis acid catalysts and reducing agents and the conditions under which they can be utilized are well known in the art, and any such compounds and/or conditions may be used.   Non-limiting reduction reactions include the Wolff-Kishnerreduction, the Huang-Minion modification, and reduction with lithium aluminum hydride/aluminum chloride.<br>
The antibacterial compound of formula (I) is formulated with an orally acceptable carrier to provide oral compositions having a variety of forms.<br>
The compositions of the invention contain an orally acceptable earner and an antibacterial effective amount of the compound of formula (I). The carrier embraces all of the components of the oral composition except for the antibacterial compound of formula (I). The carnermay include components such as inactive ingredients, carriers, vehicles, and other active ingredients.<br>
To illustrate in a non-limiting example for the case ofpastes, the carrier can be a water/humectant system. Alternatively, the earner component of a paste composition may be water, humectant, and other functional components other than the compound of formula (1).  Whatever the context, a person of skill in the art recognizes that the paste composition contains both antibacterial compounds of the formula (I) and an orally acceptable carrier for the compound.<br>
In a mouth rinse, the carrier may be, for example, a water/alcohol liquid component in which the antibacterial compounds of the formula (I) are dissolved, dispersed, suspended or otherwise incorporated.  In a dissolvable lozenge, the carrier may be the solid matrix material that dissolves in the mouth to the oral surfaces in the mouth. In chewing gums, the carrier may be a gum base, while in an edible strip, the carner may be one or more film forming polymers.<br>
In all of the above examples, the oral composition, in whatever form, includes antibacterial compounds of the formula (I), a suitable carrier in an appropriate form, and other actives or functional materials needed to provide the oral compositions with desired properties.<br>
In addition to the carrier, oral compositions of the invention contain an antibacterial effective amount of the compound of formula (I). The antibacterial effective amount may be preferred to be about 0.001% to about 10%, based on the total weight of the oral composition, for example about 0.01% to about 5% or about 0.1% to about 2%. The effective amount may vary depending on the form of the oral composition. For example, in pastes, gels, and powders, an effective amount may be at least about 0.01% and more preferably at least about 0.05%. Preferably, the compound of the formula (I) is formulated at 5% or less, preferably about 2% or less, and more preferably about 1% or less.<br>
In mouth washes and rinses, the compound of the formula (I) may be about 0.001% (or 10 ppm) up to about 1%. Preferably, the compound represented by formula (I) may be present at about 0.5% or less or about 0.2%. Preferably, it is about 0.01%<br>
(100 ppm) or greater.   In various embodiments, compound represented by formula (I) is present at.about 0.03 to about 0.12% by weight.<br>

The invention has been described above with respect to various preferred embodiments. Further non-limiting description is provided in the following examples.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
The dipropyl and dibutyl analogs of magnolol are synthesized by Friedel-Crafts acylation of 2,2'-diphenol with propanoyl chloride and butanoyl chloride respectively, followed by Clemmensen reduction to yield 5,5'-propyl-2,2'-dihydroxy-l,1 '-biphenyl and 5,5'-dibutyl-2,2,-dihydroxy-l,1'-biphenyl, respectively.<br>
Example 2<br>
MIC50     values against a variety of bacteria are measured for the dipropyl and dibutyl derivatives and compared to those for triclosan. Results are given in Table I. Lower numeric values correspond to more effective antibacterial activity. TABLE I<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
As can be seen from Table I against a number of staphylococcus, streptococcus, and bacillus bacteria in the Table, MIC50 of the compound of formula (I) is over an order of magnitude less than that of the dipropyl derivative, and comparable to that of triclosan.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
