				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present Invention relates to a device for<br>
deinterleaving interleaved digital transmission data, and<br>
more particularly/ to a deinterleaving device which releases<br>
a plurality of types of interleaving simultaneously.<br>
2. DESCRIPTION OP THE RELATED ART:<br>
In recent years, digitalization in broadcasting<br>
technology has been in rapid progress. For example,<br>
terrestrial digital audio broadcasting employing a<br>
transmission method called orthogonal frequency division<br>
multiplex (OFDM) has been realized. In such a broadcasting<br>
method, in general, (1) an audio signal is coded after an<br>
error correction code is added thereto, (2) the coded data<br>
is divided into blocks (normally called "frames") of a<br>
predetermined length, and (3) each frame is constructed of<br>
a plurality of OFDM symbols. In addition to the above,<br>
processing steps of (4) rearranging data between frames<br>
(time interleave) and (5) changing the order of sub-carriers<br>
in a symbol (frequency interleave) may be performed. By<br>
combining the two types of interleave (4) and (5) with error<br>
correction, the audio signal can be substantially restored<br>
to its original state even if continuous data on a time axis<br>
and a frequency axis are partially missing.<br>
If such radio wave is reflected from a tall building,<br>
a mountain, and the like during reception of broadcasting,<br>
the frequency characteristic of a transmission path is no<br>
longer flat, causing a degradation of a received signal,<br>
called multi-path interference, in some cases. In such<br>
cases, the receiving power of continuous sub-carriers on<br>
a frequency axis drops simultaneously (frequency selective<br>
phasing). Therefore, if frequency interleaving is not<br>
performed, data error tends to occur in bursts, and thus<br>
the effect of an error correction code is unlikely to be<br>
obtained. Also, in the case of reception of broadcasting<br>
in a moving car and the like, impulse-like noise from an<br>
ignition plug of an engine and the like and instantaneous<br>
reduction of the electric field intensity may possibly occur.<br>
In order to avoid influences from such occurrences,<br>
interleave on a time axis is also required.<br>
For the above reasons, time and frequency<br>
interleaves are indispensable for digital broadcasting<br>
employing the OFDM method. Receivers of such broadcasting<br>
are therefore required to include a function of<br>
deinterleaving. For example, Japanese Laid-Open<br>
Publication No. 8-316933 and Japanese National Phase PCT<br>
Laid-Open Publication No. 9-509818 and No. 9-509819<br>
disclose a same construction of a receiver for digital audio<br>
broadcasting (hereinbelow, abbreviated as DAB) which has<br>
a function of releasing time and frequency interleaves.<br>
In Japanese National Phase PCT Laid-Open<br>
Publication No. 9-509819 (see Figure 2 of this publication),<br>
for example, frequency interleave is released when an output<br>
of a demodulator DEM is written in a demodulator output<br>
buffer DOB. The resultant data is temporarily written in<br>
a first section of a time deinterieave memory TDM(l). The<br>
frequency-delnterleaved data is then returned to the<br>
demodulator output buffer DOB and written this time in a<br>
second section of the time deinterieave memory TDM(2).<br>
During this writing of data in TDM(2), time interleave is<br>
released. The resultant data released from both time and<br>
-xfrequency<br>
interleaves is then transferred to a deinterleaver<br>
output buffer (IOB) and then input to a Viterbi decoder DEC<br>
for error correction.<br>
In general, delay occurs when serial data is<br>
interleaved. In order to deinterleave, it is necessary to<br>
provide a memory device for temporarily storing standby data<br>
during the delay time. Such a memory device is generally<br>
a semiconductor memory such as a DRAM, an SRAM, and a register.<br>
In the above exemplified receiver for DAB, the. demodulator<br>
output buffer DOB for releasing frequency interleave and<br>
the first section of the time deinterleave memory TDM(l)<br>
for releasing time interleave correspond to the memory<br>
device for temporarily storing data described above. The<br>
interleave-specific delay of time interleave is enormously<br>
larger than that of frequency interleave. Accordingly,<br>
while the memory capacity of DOB is 12 kbits, that of TDM<br>
is as large as 1,024 kbits (1 kbit = 1,024 bits). In this<br>
case, it should be noted that the memory ceipacity of the<br>
time deinterleave memory TDM is limited on the assumption<br>
that only part of a plurality of multiplexed services in<br>
a DAB signal is demodulated.<br>
If the output data rate (output speed) after<br>
deinterleaving is not matched with the input data rate of<br>
an error corrector, a storage device called a buffer<br>
(normally, a memory) is required to achieve ma.ching of these<br>
rates. Some error correctors read data Intermittently<br>
depending on the error correction coding method. In general,<br>
therefore, the above two data rates are not matched with<br>
each other. In the above exemplified receiver for DAB, the<br>
second section of the time deinterleave memory TDM(2) and<br>
the deinterleaver output buffer IOB serve to match the data<br>
rates.<br>
Thfe above conventional device requires high-speed<br>
and complicated processing, which ia not easily realized<br>
by a general purpose processor. Such processing is normally<br>
performed by an exclusive signal processing LSI (.large scale<br>
integrated circuit). As of today, however, it i&amp; not<br>
preferable economically to mount a large-capacity memory<br>
such as the zime deinterleave memory in a signal processing<br>
LSI. Therefore, the conventional deinterle^.ving device r.s<br>
described above has a construction that &amp; s^ncr^l external<br>
large-capacity memory is added to an e.yo;,u«j.ve signal<br>
processing LSI.<br>

following problems, fc*ir.c-e jfre-quenoy arc tlrr.* ;-..nter.le.av«e<br>

LSI, external memories e:c-« •* operate l-v r^q;,: U:^d, rusr.ltf-g<br>

In reality, it is possible to release, both v.1me and<br>
frequency iuterleaves? using a single, external memory, For<br>
example, data may be written in a. memory so that the data<br>
is arranged in a state ttiat frequency interleave has been<br>
released, and tiivts interleave may b© r&amp;Asas«4 when the data<br>
is read. In this const ruction, however, encess to random<br>

read operations. In saob r«no.on; acce??;??, if the input /output<br>
data rates are high, a DRAM having long random read/random<br>
write times fails to catch up with the processing speed.<br>
Hereinbelow, the processing speed will be described,<br>
taking as an example a receiver of a DAB signal used in<br>
broadcasting in Europe. In European DAB standards, the<br>
coding rate to an original code is 1/4 at minimum. In order<br>
to obtain an output data rate of 1.536 Mbps after error<br>
correction, an output data rate of four times the above data<br>
rate, i.e., 4.096 MHz, is required after dein'terleaving.<br>
The input data rate is 4.096 MHz, and the average of the<br>
input/output data rates ir 5,12 MHz.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Hereinbelow, the present invention will be<br>
described by way of examples with reference to the relevant<br>
drawings.<br>
(Example 1)<br>
Figure 1A is a block diagram illustrating a<br>
deinterleaving device 1 of Example 1 according to the<br>
present invention. Figure IB is a block diagram<br>
illustrating an internal construction of a data write<br>
section 10 of the deinterleaving device 1 of Figure 1A, and<br>
Figure. 1C is a block diagram illustrating an internal<br>
construction of a data read section 20 of the deinterleaving<br>
device 1 of Figure 1A.<br>
Referring to Figure 1A, the deinterleaving device 1<br>
includes the data write section 10, the data read section 20,<br>
and a memory 40. The memory 40 is a IM-word dual-port SRAM<br>
having a write port and a read port.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates an exemplified transmission<br>
frame to be processed by the device shown in Figure 1A.<br>
Referring to Figure 2, a transmission frame having 57,600<br>
data is divided into 75 data segments each composed of 768<br>
data. One data is assumed to be expressed by four bits, for<br>
- yCexample.<br>
It is also assumed that one data segment is<br>
transmitted via an OFDM symbol composed of 384 QPSKmodulated<br>
sub-carriers and is input to the deinterleaving<br>
device of this example after demodulation.<br>
As is shown in Figure 2, the transmission frame<br>
(after demodulation) has been subjected to inter-frame<br>
interleaving (time interleaving) and inner-segment<br>
interleaving (frequency interleaving), which correspond to<br>
interleave on a time axis and interleave on a frequency axis,<br>
respectively.<br>
In the inter-frame interleaving, data are exchanged<br>
between a plurality of frames. For example, in the zeroth<br>
intermediate frame, a(-8,l) represents the first data in<br>
the minus eighth original frame.<br>
In the inner-segment interleaving, the order of data<br>
in each segment of an intermediate frame is changed.<br>
The rule of the above interleaves will be described<br>
in detail.<br>
Assuming that the k-th data in the L-th original<br>
frame is represented by a(L,k), and the k-th data in the<br>
L-th intermediate frame after inter-frame interleaving is<br>
represented by b(L,k), the two data have the relationship<br>
of expression (1) below.<br>
b(L,k) * a(L-g{R(k,16)&gt;, k) ... (l)<br>
wherein R(m,r) denotes a remainder obtained when an integer<br>
m is divided by a natural number r, and g(n) denotes a<br>
function defined by expression (2) below. The<br>
function g(n) represents the rule of inter-frame<br>
interleaving.<br>
9(0)=0; g(l)=8; g(2)=4; g(3)=12; g(4)-2;<br>
g(5)-10j g(6}=6; g(7)-14; g(8)-l; g(9)=9;<br>
g(10)-3; g(ll)-13; g(l2)=3; g(13)-ll» g(14)=7;<br>
g(15)-!5; ... (2)<br>
Further, assuming that the k-th data 'in the L-th<br>
transmission frame after inner-segment interleaving is<br>
represented by c(L,k), the relationship of expression (3)<br>
below is established between c(L,k) and b(L,k).<br>
c(L,k) = b(L,768'Q(k,768)+f{R(k,76a)}) ... (3)<br>
wherein Q(m,r) denotes a quotient obtained when an integer<br>
m is divided by a natural number r, and f(n) denotes a<br>
one-to-one function having a defined range and value range<br>
of integers of 0 to 767 inclusive. The function f(n)<br>
represents the rule of inner-segment interleaving.<br>
Detailed description on this function is not necessary in<br>
the understanding of the operation of the ceinterleaving<br>
device.<br>
Figure 2 also illustrates detailed data in the<br>
zeroth original frame and the zeroth Intermediate frame.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates detailed data of the zeroth to<br>
fifteenth intermediate frames, where data belonging to the<br>
zeroth original frame are hatched. The above transmission<br>
frame resembles a transmission frame in a method called<br>
European DAB Mode 2,<br>
When a transmission frame is input to the<br>
deinterleaving device 1, thedata write section 10 generates<br>
addresses for the write port of the memory 40, and<br>
sequentially writes data in the transmission frame into<br>
continuous addresses in the memory 40. Figure 4<br>
illustrates a memory map of the memory 40, where 17<br>
compartments (FO to F16) for storing transmission frames<br>
are formed in the memory. Transmission frames are stored<br>
at a cycle of 17 frames in these compartments. In other words,<br>
once the zeroth to sixteenth frames are stored in<br>
compartments FO to F16, the seventeenth frame is stored in<br>
compartment FO.<br>
Referring to Figure IB, for realizing the above<br>
function, the data write section 10 includes a data<br>
counter 101, a frame counter 102, a frame head address<br>
generator 103, and an adder 104. The data counter 101 is<br>
a 57,600-scale counter counting the number of data in<br>
transmission frames. When the count value reaches 57,599,<br>
the data counter 101 increments the count of the frame<br>
counter 102 by one. The frame counter 102 is a 17-scale<br>
counter. The frame head address generator 103 generates a<br>
value obtained by multiplying the value of the frame<br>
counter 102 by 57,600. The adder 104 sums the value of the<br>
data counter 101 and the output value of the frame head<br>
address generator 103. Using the output of the adder 104<br>
as an address, the transmission frames are cyclically stored<br>
in the compartments of the RAM.<br>
Referring to Figure 4, when a transmission frame is<br>
being written in the compartment FO, data is read from the<br>
compartments Fl to F16. At this time, the latest frame is<br>
stored in the compartment F16 and the oldest frame is stored<br>
- 2X3 -<br>
in the compartment Fl. When a next transmission frame is<br>
written in the compartment Fl, data is read from the<br>
compartments F2 to F16 and FO. At this time, the latest<br>
frame is stored in the compartment FO and the oldest frame<br>
is stored in the compartment P2. In this way, the<br>
compartment from which data is read is cycled for each frame,<br>
so that the read and write operations will not collide with<br>
each other.<br>
Referring to Figure 1C, for realizing the above<br>
function, the data read section 20 includes a counter 201,<br>
a first operator 202, a frame head address generator 203,<br>
a second operator 204, a third operator 205, a ROM 206, and<br>
an adder 207. The counter 201 counts the number of data read<br>
requests m in response to a data read request signal received<br>
externally. The first operator 202 receives four less<br>
significant bits (n) of the counter 201 and outputs a<br>
function value g(n). The first operator 202 is only<br>
required to invert the bits of the input value as a nature<br>
of the function.<br>
Herein, by calculating backward from the<br>
definitions of the K-th data in the L-th original frame<br>
a(L,k), the k-th data in the L-th intermediate frame b(L,k)<br>
represented by expression (1), and the k-th data in the L-th<br>
transmission frame c(L,k) represented by expression (3),<br>
as described above, the relationship of expression (4) below<br>
is established.<br>
a(L,p) - c(L+g{R(p,16)&gt;,<br>
768-Q(p,768)+h{R(p,768)» ... (4)<br>
wherein the function h(n) is an inverse function of f(n).<br>
Assuming that the L-th transmission frame is<br>
currently being written in the compartment Fo (i.e., the<br>
value of the frame counter 102 is Fa), it ia possible to<br>
read the (L-16)th original frame from a compartment other<br>
than the compartment Fo. From the above-de scribed data<br>
write method and expression (4), it is found that the m-th<br>
data in the (L-16)th original frame is stored in a<br>
compartment at a position calculated from expression (5)<br>
below and that the relative position in the compartment is<br>
calculated from expression (6) below. The resultant data<br>
is an output for the m-th read request.<br>
R((Fc-16)+g{R(m,16)&gt;,17) ... (5)<br>
768-Q(m,768)+h{R(m,768)» ... (6)<br>
The frame head address generator 203 calculates<br>
expression (5) from the value Fo of the frame counter 102<br>
and the output of the first operator 202* g{R(m,16)}, and<br>
outputs a value obtained by multiplying the value of<br>
expression (5) by 57600. The second operator 204<br>
calculates the first term of expression (6), The third<br>
operator 205 calculates an argument R(m,768) of the<br>
function h of the second term of expression (6). The<br>
ROM 206 receives the value calculated by the third<br>
operator 205 as an address input, and outputs the function<br>
value h{R(m,768)}. The adder 207 sums the output values of<br>
the frame head address generator 203, the second<br>
operator 204, and the ROM 206. Using the output of the<br>
adder 207 as an address, the m-th data in the (L-16)th<br>
original frame is output in response to the m-th read<br>
request.<br>
As described above, in the deinterleaving device of<br>
this example, since time Interleave and frequency interleave<br>
are released simultaneously during reading data from the<br>
memory, a memory for frequency interleave is no more required.<br>
Moreover, since data is output in response to a data read<br>
request signal, an output buffer ia no more required. With<br>
these effects, the capacity of the memory (SRAM) can be m&amp;de<br>
small compared with the conventional examples, and thus a<br>
less expensive device is realized.<br>
In this example, the data write section and the data<br>
read section are constructed of respective exclusive<br>
circuits. The present invention is not restricted to this<br>
construction. For example, it is possible, in principle,<br>
to use a general purpose processor to realize substantially<br>
the same function as that described above. A dual-port SRAM<br>
is used as the memory in this example. Alternatively, a<br>
one-port SRAM or DRAM, for example, may be used as the memory<br>
by additionally providing a control circuit which enables<br>
read and write operations by time division. Although, OFDM<br>
is employed as the transmission method for transmission<br>
frames in this example, other transmission methods may be<br>
used. Also, the structure of the transmission frame is not<br>
restricted to that described in this example.<br>
In this example, deinterleaving is performed during<br>
reading of data. Alternatively, deinterleaving may be<br>
performed during writing of data, and data may be written<br>
so that the data can be read from continuous addresses during<br>
reading. By this construction, also, substantially the<br>
same effect as that described above can be obtained.<br>
For example. Figure 5 illustrates an alternative<br>
deinterleaving device of this example which performs<br>
dainterleaving during writing. Upon receipt of a<br>
transmission frame, a data write section 10A generates an<br>
stress for each fiat a in the tranp.mip.ainn frmnF! in thp,<br>
memory 40 corresponding to a relative position calculated<br>
from expression (SA) below in a compartment at a position<br>
of the memory 40 calculated from expression ( SA) below, and<br>
stores the k-th data in the L-th transmission frame at the<br>
generated address. In this way, respective data in an<br>
original frame are arranged in the memory 40. A data read<br>
section 20A can merely read the respective data in the<br>
original frame sequentially from the compartment PC of the<br>
memory 40.<br>

(Example 2)<br>
Figure 6 is a block diagram of a data read<br>
section 20B of a deinterleaving device of Example 2<br>
according to the present invention. The construction of the<br>
deinterleaving device of this example is the; same as that<br>
of the deinterleaving device of Example 1, except that the<br>
data read section 20 in Example 1 is replaced with the data<br>
read section 20B. The description of the data write<br>
section 10 and the memory 40 is therefore omitted here.<br>
Figure 7 illustrates an exemplified transmission<br>
frame to be processed by the deinterleaving clevice of this<br>
example. Referring to Figure 7, an intermediate frame<br>
having 57,600 data is divided into 900 data units each<br>
composed of 64 data. The intermediate frame has four<br>
multiplexed channels, and each channel occupies consecutive<br>
data units. For example, the third channel occupies 140 data<br>
units from the 476th to the 615th data units. Inter-frame<br>
interleaving has been performed under the same rule as that<br>
described in Example 1 for each channel. As in Example 1,<br>
the intermediate frame is divided into 75 data segments.<br>
Inner-segment interleaving is performed for each data<br>
segment to form the transmission frame. Data in the third<br>
channel is therefore included in 13 data segments from S39<br>
to S51 as shown in Figure 7.<br>
The transmission frame with the above structure is<br>
stored in the memory 40 by the data write section 10 shown<br>
in Figure 1 in the procedure as described in Example 1.<br>
Thereafter, the data read section 20B in this<br>
example releases the interleaves provided in the<br>
transmission frame and the channel. Referring to Figure 6,<br>
the data read section 20B includes a counter 211, a<br>
register 212, and an operation portion 22. Components of<br>
the operation portion 22 which are the same as those in<br>
Example 1 are denoted by the same reference numerals and<br>
the description thereof is omitted here.<br>
In the data read section 20B, upon receipt of a data<br>
read request signal, the counter 211 counts the number of<br>
read requests m. The number m circulates in the range of<br>
0 to 8959 since the counter 211 counts data in the third<br>
channel cyclically.<br>
The register 212 stores the channel start position<br>
designated externally. For example, in the case where the<br>
third channel of the above transmission frame is selected,<br>
- vs -<br>
the head data unit Number Un f- 476 ) is stored aa tnn ntinnnni<br>
'start position.<br>
A shifter 213 shifts the output value Un of the<br>
register 212 by 6 bits leftward to obtain a value 64 times<br>
the value Un (i.e., 64Un). A second adder 214 sums the<br>
output values of the counter 211 and the shifter 213<br>
(64Un + m). The resultant value is then input to the<br>
operators 202, 204, and 205, where the procedures described<br>
in Example 1 are performed. As a result, data in the third<br>
channel is output from the deinterleaving device (after<br>
deinterleaving) .<br>
As described above, the deinterleaving device of<br>
this example includes a mechanism of selecting one of<br>
multiplexed channels in a transmission frame and<br>
deinterleaving data in the channel. For other channels<br>
which have not been selected, the circuit operation of the<br>
data read section 20B is inactivated to prevent data in such<br>
non-selected channels from being read and deinterleaved.<br>
This enables a significant reduction in power consumption<br>

In this example, the data read section is<br>
constructed of an exclusive circuit . The present invention<br>
is not restricted to this construction. Also, the memory<br>
and the transmission method for transmission frames are not<br>
restricted to those in this example.<br>
(Example 3)<br>
Figure 8 is a block diagram of a data read<br>
section 20C of a deinterleaving device of Example 3<br>
according to the present invention . The construction of the<br>
deinterleaving device of this oxample ic th» oamo ao that<br>
of the deinterleaving device of Example 1, except that the<br>
data read section 20 in Example 1 is replaced with the data<br>
read section 20C. The description of the data write<br>
section 10 and the memory 40 is therefore omitted here.<br>
Figure 9 illustrates an exemplified frame to be<br>
processed by the deinterleaving device of this example.<br>
Referring to Figure 9, the process of generating an<br>
intermediate frame from an original frame via inter-frame<br>
interleaving is the same as that shown in Figure 7. In this<br>
example, however, the construction of channel multiplexing<br>
changes from a midway frame (the (n+15)th intermediate frame<br>
in Figure 9}. For example, in the illustrated example, the<br>
third channel, which originally occupies the 476th to 615th<br>
data units, changes to occupy the 336th to 475th data units<br>
after the change of multiplexing construction. Also, after<br>
the change of multiplexing construction, a new channel (the<br>
fifth channel) is added to the intermediate frame. The<br>
procedure of generating a transmission frame from the<br>
intermediate frame via inner-segment interleaving is the<br>
same as that described in Example 2. The description<br>
thereof is therefor© omitted here.<br>
Inter-frame interleaving as shown in Figure 3 has<br>
been performed in the respective channels. In the case where<br>
the multiplexing construction is changed somewhere in the<br>
16 frames to be deinterleaved, two different channel start<br>
positions are temporarily generated for one channel. It is<br>
therefore required to calculate addresses pf data in the<br>
memory 40 using the two different channel start positions.<br>
More specifically, for data which has been subjected to<br>
inter-frame interleaving before the change of multiplexing<br>
construction, the address of the data in the memory 40 must<br>
be calculated based on the old channel start position. For<br>
data which has been subjected to inter-frame interleaving<br>
after the change of multiplexing construction, the address<br>
of the data in the memory 40 must be calculated based on<br>
the new channel start position.<br>
Referring to Figure 8, in order to deinterleave data<br>
in each channel, the data read section 20C in this example<br>
includes a first counter 211, a second counter 221, two<br>
registers 223, and an operation portion 24, Components of<br>
the operation portion 24 which are the same as those in<br>
Example 1 are denoted by the same reference, numerals and<br>
the description thereof is omitted here.<br>
On receipt of a data read request signal, the first<br>
counter 211 counts the number of read requests m, as in the<br>
counter 211 shown in Figure 6. The counter value in is<br>
associated with the m-th data .In the selected channel.<br>
On receipt of a channel multiplexing construction<br>
change signal, the second counter 221 initializes the count<br>
value to 15. The second counter 221 decrements the counter<br>
value for each transmission frame, and stops counting when<br>
the value reaches zero. In order to allow the second<br>
counter 221 to decrement the value for each transmission<br>
frame, the second counter 221 may receive an external signal<br>
which pulses at each boundary between transmission frames.<br>
The time period from the initialization and operation start<br>
until the operation stop of the second counter 221<br>
corresponds to the time period from the generation of two<br>
different channel start positions until the settling to one<br>
channel start position.<br>
The two registers 223 constitute shift registers<br>
which store the new and old channel start positions. When<br>
a channel multiplexing construction change signal is input,<br>
these shift registers store the new channel start position<br>
and shift the old channel start position to the next stage,<br>
resulting in renewing both the new and old channel start<br>
positions.<br>
The value m of the first counter 211 and a value C<br>
of the second counter 221 are input to a comparator 222,<br>
and the output of the comparator 222 controls a selector 224.<br>
The selector 224 selects the new channel start position if<br>
expression (7) below is satisfied, or selects the old<br>
channel start position if not satisfied, and supplies the<br>
result to a shifter 213. The subsequent procedure of the<br>
data read section 20C is the same as that in Example 2.<br>
C * g{R(m,16)} ... (7)<br>
The second counter value C obtained immediately<br>
after the receipt of a channel multiplexing construction<br>
change signal is 15. As is apparent from expression (4),<br>
when the value m is a value with which the right side of<br>
expression (7) becomes 15, the m-th data belongs to the<br>
latest frame. Therefore, the new channel start position is<br>
adopted for the m-th data, while the old channel start<br>
position is adopted for data belonging to the other<br>
non-latest 15 frames.<br>
When the procedure moves to the next frame, the<br>
value C becomes 14. In this case, the new channel start<br>
position is adopted in the case where the right side of<br>
expression (7) la 14 or 15, i.e., for data belonging to the<br>
Latest frame or the second, latest frame. The old channel<br>
start position is adopted for data belonging to the remaining<br>
14 frames. In this way, the number of data for which the<br>
new channel start position is adopted increases as the<br>
procedure moves to the next frame. When the second counter<br>
value C reaches zero, the new channel start position is<br>
adopted for all data.<br>
With the above construction, the deinterleaving<br>
device of this example is capable of continuing<br>
deinterleaving even when the channel multiplexing<br>
construction changes midway through the process. Thus, if<br>
a receiver is provided with the deinterleaving device of<br>
this example, the transmitter side can perform dynamic<br>
channel multiplexing.<br>
Although the data read section is constructed of an<br>
exclusive circuit in this example, the present invention<br>
is not restricted to this construction. Also, the memory<br>
and the transmission method for transmission frames are not<br>
restricted to thaa,* ii-i thii<br>
(Example 4)<br>
Figure 10 illustrates an exemplified transmission<br>
frame to be processed by a deinterleaving device of Example 4<br>
according to the present invention . Referring to Figure 10 ,<br>
the number of data in the transmission frame, the number<br>
of data segments in the transmission frame, and the method<br>
of inner- segment interleaving are the same as those in<br>
Example 1. In the transmission frame shown in Figure 10,<br>
however, inter-frame interleaving is not performed for data<br>
belonging to the zeroth to 24th data segments of the<br>
transmission frame, while inter-frame interleaving is<br>
performed for data belonging to the 25th to 74th data<br>
segments as in Example 1.<br>
In reality, in European DAB transmission frames,<br>
time interleaving is not performed for some OFDM symbols<br>
known as fast information channel, in order to avoid a delay<br>
due to time interleaving to realize prompt data transmission.<br>
In this case, more intensified error correction is performed<br>
by reducing the coding rate because data without time<br>
interleaving is vulnerable to time-axis burst error.<br>
Figure 11 illustrates a memory map of the memory 40<br>
in Example 4. Unlike Example 1, data segments which have<br>
not been subjected to inter-frame interleaving are stored<br>
in compartments EO and El, while data segments which have<br>
been subjected to inter-frame interleaving are stored in<br>
compartments PO to P16. The compartments FO to F16<br>
correspond to the respective frames, and a total of 50 data<br>
segments from the 25th to 74th data segments are stored in<br>
respective compartments. Thus, addresses 0 to 652799 are<br>
allocated for the compartments FO to F16. For the<br>
compartments EO and El, in which data in the first 25 data<br>
segments in the respective transmission frame are<br>
alternately stored, addresses 652800 to 671999 and 672000<br>
to 691199 are allocated.<br>
Although Figure 11 is shown so that data is written<br>
in the compartment EO and data is read from the<br>
compartment El, the read and write compartments are switched<br>
with each other every frame so as to avoid collision between<br>
the write and read operations.<br>
If inter-frame interleaving has not been performed,<br>
*Lt is not necessary to store data in the past 16 frames as<br>
in the case where inter-frame interleaving has been<br>
performed. By separating the storage positions for data<br>
based on the existence of inter-frame interleaving as<br>
described above, the memory capacity can be saved.<br>
For example, while a memory capacity of 979,200<br>
words is required in Example 1, a memory capacity of only<br>
691,200 words is required in Example 4. This reduction in<br>
memory capacity will contribute to a reduction in production<br>
cost of an LSI in the future when the LSI process technology<br>
advances to allow a large-capacity memory such as an<br>
inter-frame interleaving memory to be mounted in a signal<br>
processing LSI.<br>
Figure 12 is a block diagram of the deinterleaving<br>
device of Example 4. Referring to Figure 12, as in the data<br>
write section 10 shown in Figure 1, upon receipt of<br>
transmission frames, a data read section 10D generates<br>
addresses for the write port of the memory 40, and<br>
sequentially writes data belonging to the 25th to 74th data<br>
segments of the transmission frames into 0 to 652799<br>
addresses in the memory 40. The data write section 10D also<br>
writes data belonging to the zeroth to 24th data segments<br>
of the transmission frames into 652800 to 671999 addresses<br>
and 672000 to 691199 addresses in the memory 40 alternately.<br>
The data read section 20D reads data from 0 to 652799<br>
addresses in the memory 40 while releasing both the time<br>
and frequency interleaves as in the data read section 20<br>
shown in Figure 1. The data read section 20D also reads data<br>
from 652800 to 671999 addresses and 672000 to 691199<br>
addresses in the memory 40 alternately.<br>
The circuit construction and the memory are not<br>
restricted to those described in this example.<br>
(Example 5)<br>
Figure 13 is a block diagram of a deinterleaving<br>
device 3 of Example 5 according to the present invention.<br>
The deinterleaving device 3 of Example 5 is the same as the<br>
deinterleaving device 1 shown in Figure 1A, except that a<br>
memory (DRAM) 41 and a DRAM controller 30 are provided in<br>
place of the memory (SRAM) 40.<br>
The DRAM controller 30 temporarily holds an address<br>
and data from the data write section 10 and an address from<br>
the data read section 20, and outputs these addresses and<br>
data to the DRAM 41 at a predetermined timing. The DRAM<br>
controller 30 also temporarily holds data output from the<br>
DRAM 41 and outputs the data to the data read section 20<br>
at a predetermined timing. Hereinbelow, these<br>
predetermined timings will be described in detail.<br>
Figure 14 is a timing chart of signals transmitted<br>
between the DRAM controller 30 and the DRAM 41. The DRAM<br>
controller 30 operates synchronously with a 25 MHz master<br>
clock and executes data write operation (six clocks) and<br>
data read operation (18 clocks) alternately in a cycle of<br>
24 clocks. Since data is sequentially written into<br>
continuous addresses as described in Example 1, four data<br>
can be written during six clocks using a fast page mode.<br>
AS tor tne read operation, since a random read is performed,<br>
a cycle time of 110 ns or more is required as discussed in<br>
the description of the related art. In Example 5, one data<br>
is read during three clocks (120 ns). The timing of various<br>
signals shown in Figure 14 satisfies the timing restriction<br>
tor a standard DRAM having an access time of 60 ns.<br>
As described above, the deinterleaving device of<br>
this example executes four-data write and six-data read<br>
during 24 clocks. Accordingly, the average input data rate<br>
is 4.167 MHz and the average output data rate is 6.25 MHz.<br>
It is therefore sufficiently possible to obtain an output<br>
data rate of 1.536 MHz after error correction even for the<br>
European DAB standards mentioned in the description of the<br>
related art.<br>
As described above, the deinterleaving device of<br>
this example, in which data is written using the fast page<br>
mode, realizes a high input/output data rates while using<br>
a DRAM with a low unit cost per bit.<br>
The circuit construction and the transmission<br>
method for transmission frames are not restricted to those<br>
described in this example.<br>
(Example 6)<br>
Figure 15 is a block diagram of a deinterleaving<br>
device 3 of Example 6 according to the present invention.<br>
The inner construction of the deinterleaving device 3 is<br>
the same as that shown in Figure 13. Referring to Figure 15,<br>
an OFDM demodulator 2 is provided upstream of the<br>
deinterleaving device 3. As in Example 1, the transmission<br>
frame to be processed is composed of 57,600 data and divided<br>
into 75 data segments. Each data segment is transmitted via<br>
an OFDM symbol composed of 384 QPSK-modulated sub-carriers.<br>
The transmission frame is input to the deinterleaving<br>
device 3 after being demodulated by the OFDM demodulator 2,<br>
Figure 16 illustrates part of the transmission<br>
frame to be processed by the deinterleaving device of this<br>
example. Referring to Figure 16, the length of each OFDM<br>
symbol is 250 us, and a guard interval with a length of a<br>
quarter of the symbol length (62.5 jxs) is added to each OFDM<br>
symbol. The guard interval is provided to prevent<br>
inter-symbol interference at multi-path signal receiving.<br>
In this example, the rear quarter portion of each symbol<br>
is copied at the head of the symbol as the guard interval.<br>
Since it takes time to retrieve and demodulate-data, the<br>
OFDM demodulator 2 outputs the demodulation result delaying<br>
two symbols from the input. During the guard interval, the<br>
input transmission frame is discarded, the internal<br>
operation is stopped, and the demodulation result is not<br>
output.<br>
The memory map of the memory (DRAM) 41 of the<br>
deinterleaving device of this example is the same as that<br>
shown in Figure 4. In this case, it is after 16 frames, i.e.,<br>
after 375 ms, at maximum that written data is read. After<br>
this time period, the data will be volatilized unless the<br>
DRAM is refreshed.<br>
The interval releasing device of this example<br>
performs a refresh operation during the guard interval at<br>
a timing shown in Figure 17. In other words, since no data<br>
is written during the guard interval, refresh operation is<br>
performed in place of write operation. This allows the<br>
refresh operation of the DRAM to be performed without<br>
reducing the input/output data rates nor changing the<br>
input/output timings.<br>
In this example, since six clocks (240 ns) are used<br>
C-n* rarr&amp;4h OJJAL'atiOh, abuul 260 i.»Ii.eish uptsidLIujis<br>
(62.5 us/240 ns) per symbol can be performed. The 1,024<br>
refresh operations required for refreshing the entire<br>
DRAM 41 are completed within four symbols, i.e., within a<br>
time period of 1. 25 ms. Since the time period of about 16 ms<br>
is enough for a current standard DRAM, the refresh operation<br>
may be performed at a lower speed than that in this example.<br>
The circuit construction and the transmission<br>
method for transmission frames are not restricted to those<br>
rtf»«jr,r1bi»ri in this example.<br>
Thus, the deinterleaving device according to the<br>
present invention does not require a memory for frequency<br>
interleave nor an output buffer. This allows for a less<br>
expansive device compared with tho conventional dovlaao.<br>
A mechanism of selecting one of multiplexed channels<br>
in a transmission frame to deinterleave only data of the<br>
selected channel is provided. This serves to greatly reduce<br>
power consumption of the circuit.<br>
Deinterleaving operations can be continuously<br>
performed even when the channel multiplexing construction<br>
changes midway. This allows for dynamic channel<br>
multiplexing on the transmitter side.<br>
The storage positions of data are separated<br>
depending on the existence of inter-frame interleaving.<br>
This allows for saving of the capacity of the time interleave<br>
memory and thus reduction in LSI production cost.<br>
Data is written using the fast page mode. This<br>
realizes high input/output data rates while using a DRAM<br>
with a low unit cost per bit.<br>
Refresh operation is performed during the guard<br>
interval, allowing for effective DRAM refreshing.<br>
Various other modifications will be apparent to and<br>
can be readily made by those skilled in the art without<br>
departing from the scope and spirit of this invention.<br>
