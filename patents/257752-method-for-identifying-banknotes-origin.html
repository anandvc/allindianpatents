Field of the Invention<br>
his invention relates to a method for verifying the origin of bank notes from an<br>
automatic teller.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
It has become increasingly common to pay out bank notes using automatic tellers<br>
in which the payout of bank notes can be initiated for example by means of a mag-<br>
netic strip card or chip card and the input of a personal identification number. The<br>
paid out amount is charged to an account associated with the magnetic strip card<br>
or chip card. Such automatic tellers offer the advantage that the payout of bank<br>
notes is possible round-the-clock since no counter staff whatsoever are required.<br>
The complete absence of counter staff in the payout of bank notes by means of<br>
automatic tellers generally makes it impossible to verify that said bank notes were<br>
output by a certain automatic teller. This is problematic for example when the paid<br>
out bank notes are forgeries.<br>
It is the problem of the present invention to specify a method for verifying the ori-<br>
gin of bank notes from an automatic teller.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
This problem is solved according to the invention by a method for verifying the<br>
origin of bank note, in particular forgeries, from an automatic teller, characterized<br>
by detecting data characterizing bank notes to be paid out or already paid out from<br>
a sensor device for checking the bank notes to be paid out or already paid out for<br>
authenticity and/or type and/or state, storing the data of the bank notes to be paid<br>
out or already paid out, generating check data for each bank note whose origin is<br>
to be verified, by means of the sensor device, comparing the check data of the<br>
bank note to be verified with the stored data of the paid out bank notes and ascer-<br><br>
taining the paid out bank note whose stored data have the greatest match to the<br>
check data of the bank note to be verified, and verifying the origin of the bank<br>
note from the automatic teller if the match exceeds a given measure.<br>
In the inventive method for verifying the origin of bank notes, in particular forger-<br>
ies, from an automatic teller, data characterizing bank notes to be paid out or al-<br>
ready paid out from a sensor device for checking the bank notes to be paid out or<br>
already paid out for aumenticity and/or type and/or state are detected, the data of<br>
the bank notes to be paid out or already paid out are stored, check data are gener-<br>
ated by means of the sensor device for each bank note whose origin is to be veri-<br>
fied, whereby the check data of the bank note to be verified are compared with the<br>
stored data of the paid out bank notes and the paid out bank note is ascertained<br>
whose stored data have the greatest match to the check data of the bank note to be<br>
verified, and the verification of origin for the bank note to be verified from the<br>
automatic teller is regarded as furnished if the match exceeds a given threshold<br>
value.<br>
The inventive method has in particular the advantage that reliable verification can<br>
be furnished for bank notes that they were output by a certain automatic teller.<br>
This is advantageous in particular if said bank note is a forgery, since this can pre-<br>
vent fraud and the circulation of counterfeit money.<br>
Further advantages of the present invention will result from the dependent claims<br>
as well as the following description of embodiments with reference to the accom-<br>
panying drawings.<br>

Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of a schematic structure of an automatic<br>
teller 10 for paying out bank notes.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The automatic teller 10 has an output pocket 1 into which bank notes BN to be<br>
paid out are output to a recipient. The bank notes BN are removed from a con-<br>
tainer 9 by a transport system 2 and can be supplied to a sensor device 3. The sen-<br>
sor device 3 detects features of each single bank note that are relevant for example<br>
for judging the authenticity and/or the type (currency, denomination) and/or the<br>
state, etc., of the bank note. Such features can be detected for example by different<br>
sensors mechanically, acoustically, optically, electrically and/or magnetically.<br>
Known authentication features comprise for example printing inks with special<br>
optical and/or magnetic properties, metallic or magnetic security threads, the use<br>
of brightener-free bank note paper, information contained in an electrical circuit,<br>
etc. The type of bank note is specified e.g. by its size, printed pattern, colors, etc.,<br>
whereas the state of the bank note can be derived for example from the optical ap-<br>
pearance (soiling). The features are detected by the sensor device 3, and corre-<br>
sponding data of the sensor device 3 transferred to a control device 4.<br>
By the control device 4 the data of the detected features are stored in the control<br>
device 4 or a nonvolatile memory 5 associated with the control device 4. The non-<br>
volatile memory 5 can be formed e.g. by an EEPROM or a flash memory, a hard<br>
disk, etc.<br><br>
For control of the automatic teller 10 by the recipient of the bank notes BN to be<br>
paid out, an input/output device 12 is connected to the control device 4 to permit<br>
for example the selection of certain processing modes, or inform the recipient<br>
about the processing of the payout. The input/output device 12 furthermore has an<br>
identification device 13, for example a reader for a magnetic strip card or chip<br>
card 14. By inputting an individual card 14 and possibly a personal identification<br>
number, the recipient of bank notes BN can identify himself with the automatic<br>
teller 10 and have the amount corresponding to the bank notes BN to be paid out<br>
charged to his account.<br>
The data of each paid out bank note BN are linked with information about the re-<br>
cipient's identity, e.g. by the data having the recipient's account number added<br>
thereto. Further information about the payout operation can also be added, e.g.<br>
date, time, identification number of the automatic teller 10, identification number<br>
of the container 9, etc. Moreover, additional information about the paid out bank<br>
notes BN can be added if it could be generated during processing, e.g. denomina-<br>
tion and/or orientation of the particular bank note BN and/or the serial number of<br>
the particular bank note BN. The information linked with the data of the paid out<br>
bank notes BN is stored in the nonvolatile memory 5 together with the data of the<br>
paid out bank notes BN.<br>
The data of the paid out bank notes BN stored in the nonvolatile memory 5 and the<br>
information linked therewith can be read via an interface 6 which is connected to<br>
the control device 4 or the nonvolatile memory 5, to permit verification of the ori-<br>
gin of the paid out bank notes BN from the automatic teller 10. The interface 6 can<br>
be designed e.g. as a modem, network connection, Internet connection, as a paral-<br>
lel, serial or USB interface, or also as a reading device for an optical or magnetic<br>
memory, etc. It is thus possible to record the data and information of the paid out<br>
bank notes BN e.g. on a storage medium, a portable computer, etc., which a ser-<br>
vice person carries. However, it is also possible for the data to be transferred via<br><br>
the modem, network connection, Internet connection, etc., to a certain place where<br>
the verification is to be furnished.<br>
Alternatively, the data of the bank notes BN to be paid out can be generated using<br>
a bank note processing machine 11 shown in Figure 3. In this case, the sensor de-<br>
vice 3 of the automatic teller 10 can be omitted, since the data of the bank notes<br>
BN to be paid out are generated and stored by the bank note processing machine<br>
11.<br>
The bank note processing machine 11 has an input pocket 20 for input of the bank<br>
notes BN intended for payouts, which is engaged by a singler 22. The singler 22<br>
grasps one of the bank notes BN to be processed at a time and transfers the single<br>
bank note to a transport system 23 which transports the single bank note through a<br>
sensor device 30. The sensor device 30 has a structure that can correspond to the<br>
structure of the sensor device 3 of the automatic teller 10; in particular it can have<br>
sensors of the same type which detect the features of the bank notes BN, as de-<br>
scribed above for the automatic teller 10, and generate corresponding data for<br>
them which correspond to the data of the sensor device 3 of the automatic teller<br>
10. The data of the bank notes BN are passed on to a control device 40 by which<br>
the data of the detected features are compared with comparative data which permit<br>
the recognition of authentic or forged and/or suspect bank notes, the type of bank<br>
notes, the state of the bank notes, etc. The comparative data and programs required<br>
for operating the bank note processing machine 11 are present in the form of soft-<br>
ware and stored in the control device 40 or a nonvolatile memory 41 associated<br>
with the control device 40. The nonvolatile memory 41 can be formed e.g. by an<br>
EEPROM, a flash memory, a hard disk, etc.<br>
On the basis of the comparison carried out by the control device 40 between the<br>
data of the particular bank note and the comparative data, a gate 24 disposed in the<br>
transport system 23 is driven to deposit the bank note for example in output pock-<br>
ets 25 or 27. It can be provided that the output pocket 23 receives the bank notes<br>
BN that are suitable for output with an automatic teller 10. These are in particular<br><br>
bank notes that are authentic. Further, the state of the bank notes can also be<br>
judged, so that only bank notes in good condition are provided for payout with an<br>
automatic teller 10 and are deposited in the output pocket 25. All other bank notes,<br>
in particular forgeries and suspect bank notes as well as bank notes in poor condi-<br>
tion, are deposited in the output pocket 27.<br>
For control of the bank note processing machine 10 by a service person, an in-<br>
put/output device 45 is connected to the control device 40 to permit for example<br>
the selection of certain processing modes or inform the service person about the<br>
processing of the bank notes 21.<br>
To permit the desired verification of origin from a certain automatic teller 10 to be<br>
furnished at a later time, the data generated by the sensor device 30 for the bank<br>
notes suitable for a later payout with an automatic teller 10, i.e. the bank notes de-<br>
posited in the output pocket 25, are stored in the nonvolatile memory 41 of the<br>
bank note processing machine 11.<br>
The bank notes deposited in the output pocket 25 are then filled into a container 9<br>
as used for the automatic tellers 10. Since the containers 9 as a rule have a unique<br>
identification, said identification of the container 9 used is linked as information<br>
with the data of the bank notes BN filled into said container 9, and likewise stored<br>
in the nonvolatile memory 41. The identification of the container 9 can be read in<br>
if the identification is present e.g. as a bar code or transponder, but it can also be<br>
entered by means of the input/output device 45. As further information, the date<br>
and/or time of filling of the container 9 and/or the date and/or time of insertion of<br>
the container 9 into an automatic teller 10 and/or the identification of the auto-<br>
matic teller 10 can be linked with the data and stored. The identification of the<br>
automatic teller 10 can also be stored as an alternative to the identification of the<br>
container 9. Furthermore, information on the origin of the bank notes BN can also<br>
be stored. If the bank notes BN are for example from one or more deposits that are<br>
input into the input pocket 20 of the bank note processing machine 11 for the<br>
above-described processing, information about said deposits, e.g. an account num-<br><br>
ber or the name of the depositor, can be assigned to the particular bank notes BN<br>
and stored, so that their origin can later be traced beyond the automatic teller 10.<br>
For securing and monitoring the operation of filling the container 9 with the bank<br>
notes BN prepared for payouts, it can be provided that the bank note processing<br>
machine 11, in particular the output pockets 25, 27, are monitored. For monitoring<br>
it is possible to use e.g. a camera 46 whose images are stored e.g. together with the<br>
data of the bank notes BN and the information linked therewith in the nonvolatile<br>
memory 41.<br>
Alternatively or additionally, the filling of the container 9 can be secured as shown<br>
in Figure 4. The container 9 is connected here directly to the bank note processing<br>
machine 11 so that the filling of the container 9 is effected automatically without<br>
the intermediary of service persons.<br>
The data of the bank notes BN provided for payouts stored in the nonvolatile<br>
memory 41 as well as the information linked therewith and any images can be read<br>
out via an interface 42, which is connected to the control device 40 or the nonvola-<br>
tile memory 41, to later permit a verification of the origin of the paid out bank<br>
notes from the automatic teller 10 into which the container 9 filled with the bank<br>
notes BN prepared for payouts is inserted. The interface 42 can be designed e.g. as<br>
a modem, network connection, Internet connection, as a parallel, serial or USB<br>
interface, or also as a reading device for an optical or magnetic memory, etc. It is<br>
thus possible to record the data and information of the paid out bank notes BN e.g.<br>
on a storage medium, a portable computer, etc., which a service person carries.<br>
However, it is also possible that the data are transferred via the modem, network<br>
connection, Internet connection, etc., to the central place where the verification is<br>
to be furnished. It is additionally possible to acquire and store, upon payout, in-<br>
formation that is assigned to the automatic teller 10 and/or the container 9 and/or<br>
the bank notes, e.g. the information described above in connection with the auto-<br>
matic teller 10.<br><br>
Figure 2 shows a schematic representation of a basic structure of a system for veri-<br>
fying the origin of bank notes from an automatic teller.<br>
The system can consist of one or more automatic tellers 10 which are connected<br>
by means of their interfaces 6 via a network 60, e.g. a telephone network, a local<br>
network, the Internet, etc., to a verification device, consisting e.g. of a computer<br>
51 with an interface 50, located at a certain place. One or more bank note process-<br>
ing machines 11 can be attached to the computer 51 via the network 60 and/or di-<br>
rectly.<br>
If a recipient claims to have obtained a bank note BN, in particular a forgery, from<br>
one of the automatic tellers 10, check data are generated for said bank note BN.<br>
For this purpose one of the automatic tellers 10 can be used, in particular the auto-<br>
matic teller 10 from which the forgery is supposed to come according to the re-<br>
cipient. For the forgery, data are then generated in the above-described way by the<br>
sensor device 3 of the automatic teller, to be used as check data. Alternatively, the<br>
check data are generated by the sensor device 30 of the bank note processing ma-<br>
chine 11 which has a structure corresponding to the structure of the sensor device<br>
that was used for generating the stored data of the output bank notes BN. For con-<br>
sideration of deviations produced by fluctuations during processing, the forgeries<br>
can be processed several times. The check data are generated from the thereby<br>
generated data e.g. by averaging.<br>
The generated check data are compared with the data of the paid out bank notes<br>
stored in the nonvolatile memories 5, 41. This comparison can be carried out by<br>
the control device 4, 40. The comparison can also be carried out by the computer<br>
51 if the stored data of the paid out bank notes and the check data were already<br>
transmitted to the computer via the network 60. Otherwise the computer can re-<br>
trieve the data and check data required for the comparison from the particular<br>
automatic teller 10 and/or the particular bank note processing machine 11, or the<br>
data are transmitted by means of the above-described storage medium.<br><br><br>
For the comparison, the check data of the forgery are compared for example by<br>
means of statistical methods with the stored data of the paid out bank notes BN of<br>
the automatic teller 10 from which they are supposed to have been paid out. Those<br>
data of the paid out bank note BN with the greatest match serve to verify mat the<br>
forgery was paid out from the automatic teller 10 if the match exceeds a certain<br>
measure, e.g. overshoots a given threshold value. If me data of the paid out bank<br>
note BN are linked, as described above, with the identity of the recipient to whom<br>
the bank note BN was paid out, e.g. via his account number, it can additionally be<br>
checked whether the bank note BN, i.e. the forgery, was actually paid out to said<br>
recipient. If no sufficient match is determined, the forgery cannot be from the<br>
automatic teller 10, as claimed. If a plurality of paid out bank notes BN are deter-<br>
mined whose stored data have an equally good match to the check data, no clear<br>
statement can be made. In such a case it can only be said that a determination of<br>
origin is not possible for this forgery.<br>
Since it is not always known in what orientation the data of the paid out bank<br>
notes BN were detected, sets of check data are generated for all possible orienta-<br>
tions for the forgeries to be checked. This can be done by processing the forgeries<br>
in all four orientations (front, transport from the left; front, transport from the<br>
right; back, transport from the left; back, transport from the right) by means of the<br>
automatic teller or the bank note processing machine 11 to generate four sets of<br>
check data for the forgery. It is thus ensured that the comparison of the stored data<br>
of the paid out bank notes BN with the check data yields a result independently of<br>
the original orientation of the paid out bank notes BN.<br>
To reduce the effort in generating the check data, it can also be provided to gener-<br>
ate only two sets of check data. One set of check data is obtained e.g. by detecting<br>
the front of the forgery, the other by turning over the forgery and detecting the<br>
back. The two missing sets of check data can in this case be generated by the con-<br>
trol device 4, 40 by the data of the two generated sets of check data being each<br>
evaluated backwards, since this corresponds to sets of check data of the two miss-<br>
ing orientations.<br><br>
Besides the described embodiment, a multiplicity of variations is possible.<br>
For example, a bank note processing machine 11 is unnecessary for generating<br>
check data if the automatic teller 10 itself is used for generating the check data as<br>
described above. For this purpose a special operating mode can be provided which<br>
permits the service person, authenticating himself e.g. with a special card 14, to<br>
generate the check data.<br>
A further possibility is to omit the computer 51. In this case the control device 4,<br>
40 is used for verifying the origin from a certain automatic teller.<br>
To reduce the effort in checking the data of the paid out bank notes BN, it can be<br>
provided, as described above, to consider only the data of the paid out bank notes<br>
BN of the automatic teller 10 from which the forgery is supposed to have been<br>
paid out. Besides this, further methods can be used, also additionally, to reduce the<br>
effort of the check.<br>
It can thus be provided to consider only the data of the paid out bank notes BN<br>
that were located in a certain container 9. The particular container 9 can be se-<br>
lected e.g. by the date of filling of the container 9 and/or the date of insertion into<br>
the automatic teller 10. If the date and/or time of the alleged payout are also<br>
known, their consideration makes it possible to obtain a further reduction of the<br>
stored data to be checked for the paid out bank notes.<br>
A reduction of effort can also be obtained if the data of the paid out bank notes BN<br>
are linked with the identity of the person to whom the forgery is supposed to have<br>
been paid out. In this case it is only necessary to check those data of the paid out<br>
bank notes BN assignable to the corresponding person.<br>
The effort of checking the origin of a forgery can be reduced further if the addi-<br>
tional data of the paid out bank notes BN, such as denomination and/or orienta-<br><br>
tion, are used in the check. In this case it is only necessary to compare those data<br>
of the paid out bank notes BN with the check data in which denomination and/or<br>
orientation match.<br>
If information about the orientation of the paid out bank notes BN is used, it is<br>
sufficient when detecting the forgery for generating the check data to detect the<br>
latter only in the known original orientation of the paid out bank note BN. This is<br>
also always given when the bank notes BN to be paid out are inserted into the con-<br>
tainers 9 or the automatic tellers 10 in a certain, given orientation.<br>
A further possibility for reducing the effort in checking the origin of a forgery can<br>
be obtained if the serial numbers of the paid out bank notes BN are determined<br>
and stored. In this case it is only necessary to look specifically for data with this<br>
serial number to carry out the check.<br>
A further reduction of the effort for verifying origin is also obtained in the case<br>
that the check data of the sensor device 3, 30 from the forgery are recognized by<br>
the control device 4, 40 as data of a forgery. In this case the forgery would already<br>
have been recognized as a forgery upon payout by the automatic teller 10 or upon<br>
filling of the container 9 with the help of the bank note processing machine 11. For<br>
this reason a check with the stored data of the paid out bank notes can be omitted<br>
for such a forgery which is already recognized as a forgery upon generation of the<br>
check data. This results from the fact that same-type sensors and evaluation soft-<br>
ware are used in the control devices and recognized forgeries are not paid out or<br>
filled into a container 9, so that the existing forgery recognized upon generation of<br>
the check data cannot have been output by the automatic teller 10.<br>
Conversely, it is also possible to reduce the effort for verifying origin by examin-<br>
ing the stored data of the paid out bank notes BN for the existence of a forgery for<br>
which a verification is to be furnished. For this purpose, forgery data are generated<br>
for the existing forgery, e.g. from the check data, and the greatest deviations from<br><br>
the comparative data of the corresponding authentic bank note are determined.<br>
Such forgery data are normally generated to be able to recognize new forgeries<br>
that have appeared. If the forgery data are compared with the stored data of the<br>
paid out bank notes and no stored data of paid out bank notes are determined that<br>
contain the characteristic deviations of the forgery data, it can be assumed with<br>
very high certainty that the forgery is not from the automatic teller 10. If stored<br>
data from one or more output bank notes are found that have the deviations or<br>
similar deviations, the forgery can be from the automatic teller 10. For the final<br>
check, the stored data having the characteristic deviations are compared with the<br>
check data, as described above, to verify the origin from the automatic teller 10.<br>
The suitability of the data characterizing the bank notes BN to be paid out or al-<br>
ready paid out and described above in connection with the sensor device 3, 30 de-<br>
pends greatly on whether they are obtained from features of the bank notes BN<br>
that are particularly characteristic of single bank notes BN.<br>
It is particularly suitable in this connection to use firstly the above-mentioned se-<br>
rial number. In addition to the actual serial number, which can be obtained e.g. by<br>
means of an evaluation program (OCR program) from the data of the sensor de-<br>
vice, the image of the serial number resulting from the data of the sensor device is<br>
also particularly characteristic, since the serial number is applied to the bank note<br>
as a rule in a separate printing operation. There can thus be e.g. fluctuations of the<br>
position of the serial numbers, of the printing density of the serial numbers, etc.,<br>
on single bank notes.<br>
It is likewise suitable to use e.g. the position of a security thread of bank notes,<br>
since the security thread is incorporated into the bank notes not at a certain posi-<br>
tion but within a certain area. The exact position of the security thread is thus par-<br>
ticularly characteristic of a certain bank note. If the security thread furthermore<br>
has a magnetic coding, this can be considered additionally or instead of the posi-<br>
tion of the security thread. The magnetic coding has continuous patterns character-<br>
istic of certain currencies and denominations. This continuous pattern does not<br><br>
always have the same starting point within the security thread, so that the magnetic<br>
coding can be used for characterizing a certain bank note if e.g. the starting point<br>
of the continuous pattern in the security thread is determined.<br>
Unlike the view in Figure 1, the automatic teller 10 can have more than one con-<br>
tainer 9. The individual containers then each contain e.g. only bank notes of a cer-<br>
tain denomination of a currency.<br>
As a further deviation it can be provided that the automatic teller 10 shown in Fig-<br>
ure 1 also permits the deposit of bank notes besides the payout of bank notes.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
Method For Identifying Banknotes Origin<br>
A method for verifying the origin of bank notes (BN) from an automatic<br>
teller (10) is disclosed. The method is characterized by detecting data characterizing<br>
bank notes (BN) to be paid out or already paid out from a sensor device (3; 30)<br>
for checking the bank notes (BN) to be paid out or already paid out for authenticity<br>
and/or type and/or state, storing the data of the bank notes (BN) to be paid out<br>
or already paid out, generating check data for each bank note whose origin is to be<br>
verified, by means of the sensor device (3; 30), comparing the check data of the<br>
bank note to be verified with the stored data of the paid out bank notes (BN) and<br>
ascertaining the paid out bank note (BN) whose stored data have the greatest<br>
match to the check data of the bank note to be verified, and verifying the origin of<br>
the bank note from the automatic teller (10) if the match exceeds a given measure.</td>
