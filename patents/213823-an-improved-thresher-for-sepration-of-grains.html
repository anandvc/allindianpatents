DESCRIPTION WITH REFERENCE TO DRAWINGS<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing<br>
description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and wherein.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the conventional thresher provided in a harvester combine.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a side sectional view of the thresher provided in a combine harvester in<br>
accordance with one embodiment<br>
FigJa to 3c show the concave plate provided in the thresher.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a side sectional view of another embodiment of a thresher provided in a<br>
combine harvester.<br><br>
Referring to fig. 1, the known thresher system provided in a harvester combine comprises a pan 3 at one end of the harvester and co-acting with a reel 1 and such that a standing crop 2 is fed into pan 3 by reel 1. The cut crop is fed to a conveyor 6 through a feeler anger 4 having prongs 5. The discharge end of conveyor 6 discharges the cut crop into a thresher 7. As apparent in fig. 1 thresher 7 includes a thresher drum disposed in an axis vertical to the longitudinal axis of the thresher. A concave 8 is disposed below thresher drum 7 and in a spaced relationship thereto in order to receive the grains and the straw. Grains pass through concave 8 onto a stepped bed 13. A stone trap 9 is provided in the proximity of concave 8 so as to prevent the entry of stones onto stepped bed 13. The grains from stepped bed 13 are blown onto a hinged screen 14 by means of a blower 16 disposed below of said stepped bed 13. Grains from hinged screen are conveyed by a screw conveyor onto a grain elevator 21 and screw conveyor 24 to a grain tank 22 having a discharge anger 23.<br>
A further adjustable sieve 18 is provided below hinged screen 14, and the grains are conveyed in a manner as described hereinabove.<br>
Reference is now made to the straw separated from the crop by thresher drum 7. Straw separated from the grain is discharged onto a straw walker 11 by a guide drum 10. A baffle plate 12 guiding the flow of straw onto said straw walker 11, and the straw is ultimately discharged from the opposite end of the combine.<br><br>
As shown in fig. 1 a chaffer rack 17 and screw 15 is provided with the straw system of the thresher.<br>
Reference is now made to fig. 2 which illustrates one of the embodiments of the thresher provided in a harvester combine. The thresher of fig.2 is used for crops such as paddy and where an impact action is required for causing a separation of the grains from the straw in distinction to a rubbing action for standing crops such as wheat or maize, and as shown in fig-4.<br>
The apparatus consisting of the reel section for cutting of the standing crop and feeding it into the feed zone A of the thresher is the same as that of the prior art. Thus, for purposes of brevity, the same reference numerals 1 to 6 as provided in fig. 1 are also provided in figs. 2 and 4 for designating like parts. Thus, the reel section comprising of parts having reference numerals 1 to 6 do not form a concept of the present invention.<br>
The present invention resides in a thresher comprising a rotor 17 disposed within a stator 21. Stator 21 is disposed along the longitudinal axis. The rotor comprises a rotatable shaft or drum 17 disposed within stator 21. The rotor 17 has a feed end in feed zone A adapted to receive the cut crop from feed conveyor 6. In order to transport the cut crop into the thresher, the feed end of rotor 21 comprises a tapered surface 22 with a curved profile or helix 23 formed on said surface.<br><br>
In order to create a impact action for the cut crop and simultaneously to allow the separated straw to be discharged from the straw discharge end 24, a helix 25 is provided on rotor 17 with a plurality of spaced fingers 20. Though fig.2 illustrates helix 25 as being provided along the entire length of rotor 17, in accordance with another embodiment helix 25 may be provided only in the separation or threshing zone C. Stator 21 has also a helix along the entire length except in the feed zone A having chute 7.<br>
In order to separate the grain from the straw, a concave plate 8 is provided in threshing zoneC.<br>
Reference is made to figs. 3a to 3c which illustrates the concave plate 8. Concave plate 8 comprises a frame 8a having a choke window 8b. in figs. 3a to 3c, the concave plate 8 is intended for an impact action and comprises equally spaced radial fingers or spikes 8c and which project outwardly of the surface of concave plate 8.<br>
Concave plate 8 has a leading section 8d and a trailing section 8e, the choke window 8b being provided in the trailing section 8e. A pivotal pin 8f is provided between the trailing section 8e and leading section 8d. As shown in fig.2 the clearance P at the leading section, which is the crop entry section, is more than that at trailing section 8e, which is the crop discharge side.<br><br>
After the threshing action in zone C, the grain is separated from the straw, which is facilitated by concave plate 8. After separation is effected in zone C, the grain falls in grain collection zone 27. Grain collection zone 27 has a known construction, namely that of a stepped bed 10, hinged screen 14, adjustable sieve 13 and screw conveyor 11. The grain is fed to a grain tank 18 through a grain elevator 12. A discharge anger is provided in tank 18.<br>
In accordance with this invention, and as illustrated in fig. 2, rotor 17 is disposed along the longitudinal axis of the thresher. A separating cage 16 comprises the lower section of stator21.<br>
The separated straw is discharged through discharge end 24.<br>
Reference is now made to the harvester combine having the thresher of the present invention. The thresher of fig.4 is identical to that of fig.2, and for this purpose like reference numerals denote like parts as those of fig.2. However, the thresher of fig.4 is intended to a standing crop such as wheat or maize and where a rubbing action is required on the crops rather than an impact action as provided by the construction of fig.2.<br><br>
For the purposes of brevity, only the difference in the construction of the thresher of fig.4 is described herein, the remaining features being identical to those as provided in fig.2.<br>
The rotor 17 no longer has a helix as provided in fig.2. However, rotor 17 has a plurality of rasp bars 21 in the threshing zone B which causes a rubbing action to a cut crop with stator 22 and a plurality of pegs 21 in the straw collection zone. Further, concave plate 8 has flats of a wire mesh construction equally spaced along the Y axis.<br>
The drawings illustrate the thresher in a harvester combine. As the invention does not reside in the harvester combine but in the thresher, such a thresher may be provided by itself or in any other agricultural apparatus.<br><br>
