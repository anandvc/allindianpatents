				<td>CONDENSED N-HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDS AND THEIR USE AS CRF RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS<br>
The present invention-relates to bicyclic derivatives, to processes for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in therapy.<br>
The first corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) was isolated from ovine hypothalami and identified as a 41-amino acid peptide (Vale et al., Science 213:1394-1397,1981). CRF has been found to produce profound alterations in endocrine, nervous and immune system function. CRF is believed to be the major physiological regulator of the basal and stress-release of adrenocorticotropic hormone ("ACTH"), Bendorphin and other propiomelanocortin ("POMC")-derived peptides from the anterior pituitary (Vale et al., Science 213:1394-1397,1981).<br>
In addition to its role in stimulating the production of ACTH and POMC, CRF appears to be one of the pivotal central nervous system neurotransmitters and plays a crucial role in integrating the body's overall response to stress.<br>
Administration of CRF directly to the brain elicits behavioral, physiological and endocrine responses identical to those observed for an animal exposed to a stressful environment. Accordingly, clinical data suggests that CRF receptor antagonists may represent novel antidepressant and/or anxiolytic drugs that may be useful in the treatment of the neuropsychlatric disorders manifesting hypersecretion of CRF.<br>
The first CRF receptor antagonists were peptides (see, e.g., Rivier et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,605,642; Rivier et al., Science 224: 889, 1984). While these peptides established that CRF receptor antagonists can attenuate the pharmacological responses to CRF, peptide CRF receptor antagonists suffer from the usual drawbacks of peptide therapeutics including lack of stability and limited oral activity. More recently, small molecule CRF receptor antagonists have been reported.<br>
WO 95/10506 describes inter alia compounds of general formula (A) with general CRF antagonist activity<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein Y may be CR29; V may be nitrogen, Z may be carbon or nitrogen, R3 may correspond to an amine derivative and R4 may be taken together with R29 to form a 5-membered ring and is -CH(R28) when R29 is-CH(R3O).<br>
WO 95/33750 also describes compounds of general formula (B) having CRF antagonistic activity,<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
in which A and Y may be nitrogen and carbon and B may correspond to an amine derivative.<br>
Recently a patent application has been published as WO 02/08895 in which the following compounds, CRF antagonists, are objects of the Patent Application:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
In particular, R2 and R3 with N may form a saturated or unsaturated heterocycle, which may be substituted by a 5-6 membered heterocycle, which may be substituted by 1 to 3 groups selected among: C1-C6 alkyl, halo C1-C2 alky!, C1-C6 alkoxy, halogen, nitro or cyano.<br>
Another recent patent application has been published as WO 03/008412 in which the following compounds, CRF antagonists, are objects of the Patent Application:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In particular, R2 and R3 with N may form a 5-14 membered heterocycie, which may be substituted by a 5-6 membered heterocycle, which may be saturated or may contain one to three double bonds, and which may be substituted by 1 or more groups such as C3-C7 cycloalkyl, C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6 alkoxy, halo C1-C6 alkyl, C2-C6 alkenyl, C2-C6 alkynyl. halo C1-C6 alkoxy, hydroxy, halogen, nitro, cyano, or C(0)NR6R7.<br>
None of the above references disclosed compounds falling into the scope of the present invention.<br>
Due to the physiological significance of CRF, the development of biologically-active small molecules having significant CRF receptor binding activity and which are capable of<br>
antagonizing the CRF receptor remains a desirable goaf. Such CRF receptor antagonists would be useful in the treatment of endocrine, psychiatric and neurologic conditions or illnesses, including stress-related disorders in general.<br>
While significant strides have been made toward achieving CRF regulation through administration of CRF receptor antagonists, there remains a need in the art for effective small molecule CRF receptor antagonists. There is also a need for pharmaceutical compositions containing such CRF receptor antagonists, as well as methods relating to the use thereof to treat, for example, stress-related disorders. The present invention fulfills these needs, and provides other related advantages.<br>
in particular the invention relates to novel compounds which are potent and specific antagonists of cortlcotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptors,<br>
The present invention provides compounds of formula (I) including stereoisomers, prodrugs and pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates thereof<br><br>

The compounds of the present invention may be in the form of and/or may be administered as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. For a review on suitable salts see Berge et al. J. Pharm. Sci., 1977. 66,1-19.<br>
Typically, a pharmaceutical acceptable salt may be readily prepared by using a desired acid or base as appropriate. The salt may precipitate from solution and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent.<br>
Suitable addition salts are formed from acids which form non-toxic salts and examples are hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulphate, bisulphate, nitrate, phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, acetate, maleate, malate, fumarate, lactate. tartrate, citrate, formate, gluconate, succinate, piruvate, oxalate, oxaloacetate, trifluoroacetate, saccharate, benzoate, methansulphonate, ethanesulphonate, benzenesulphonate, p-toluensulphonate, methanesulphonic, ethanesulphonic, p-toluenesulphonic, and isethionate.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable base salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as those of sodium and potassium, alkaline earth metal salts such as those of calcium<br>
and magnesium and salts with organic bases, including salts of primary, secondary and tertiary amines, such as isopropylamine, diethylamine, ethanolamine, trimethylamine, dicyclohexyl amine and N-methyl-D-glucamine.<br>
Those skilled in the art of organic chemistry will appreciate that many organic compounds can form complexes with solvents in which they are reacted or from which they are precipitated or crystallized. These complexes are known as "solvates". For example, a complex with water Is known as a "hydrate". Solvates of the compound of the invention are within the scope of the invention.<br>
In addition, prodrugs are also included within the context of this invention. As used herein, the term "prodrug" means a compound which is converted within the body, e.g. by hydrolysis in the blood, into its active form that has medical effects. Pharmaceirtically acceptable prodrugs are described in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Prodrugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, Edward B. Roche, ed., Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, and in D. Fleisher, S. Ramon and H. Barbra "Improved oral drug delivery: solubility limitations overcome by the use of prodrugs", Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews (1996) 19(2) 115-130, each of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Prodrugs are any covalently bonded carriers that release a compound of structure (I) in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a patient. Prodrugs are generally prepared by modifying functional groups in a way such that the modification Is cleaved, either by routine manipulation or in vivo, yielding the parent compound. Prodrugs include, for example, compounds of this invention wherein hydroxy, amine or sulfhydryl groups are bonded to any group that, when administered to a patient, cleaves to form the hydroxy, amine or sulfhydryl groups. Thus, representative examples of prodrugs Include (but are not limited to) acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of alcohol, sulfhydryl and amine functional groups of the compounds of structure (I). Further, in the case of a carboxylic acid (-COOH), esters may be employed, such as methyl esters, ethyl esters, and the like. Esters may be active in their own right and /or be hydrolysable under in vivo conditions in the human body. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable in vivo hydrolysable ester groups include those which break down readily in the human body to leave the parent acid or its salt.<br>
With regard to stereoisomers, the compounds of structure (I) may have one or more asymmetric carbon atom and may occur as recemates, racemic mixtures and as individual enantiomers or-diastereomers. All such isomeric forms are included within the present Invention, including mixtures thereof.<br>
Where a compound of the Invention contains an alkenyl or alkenylene group, cis (E) and trans (Z) isomerism may also occur. The present invention includes the individual<br>
stereoisomers of the compound of the invention and, where appropriate, the individual tautomeric forms thereof, together with mixtures thereof.<br>
Separation of diastereoisomers or cis and trans isomers may be achieved by conventional techniques, e.g. by fractional crystallisation, chromatography or H.P.L.C. of a stereoisomeric mixture of the agent may also be prepared from a corresponding optically pure intermediate or by resolution, such as H.P.L.C. of the corresponding racemate using a suitable chlral support or by fractional crystallisation of the diastereoisomeric salts formed by reaction of the corresponding racemate with a suitable optically active acid or base, as appropriate.<br>
Those skilled in the art of organic chemistry will appreciate that many organic compounds can form complexes with solvents in which they are reacted or from which they are precipitated or crystallized. These complexes are known as "solvates". For example, a complex with water is known as a "hydrate". Solvates of the compounds of the invention are within the scope of the invention.<br>
Furthermore, some of the crystalline forms of the compounds of structure (I) may exist as poiymorphs, which are included in the present Invention.<br>

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that in the preparation of the compound of the Invention or a solvate thereof it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect one or more sensitive groups in the molecule to prevent undesirable side reactions. Suitable protecting groups for use according to the present invention are well known to those skilled in the art and may be used in a conventional manner. See, for example, "Protective groups in organic synthesis" by T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts (John Wiley &amp; sons 1991) or "Protecting Groups" by PJ, Kocienski (Georg Thieme Verlag 1994). Examples of suitable amino protecting groups include acyl type protecting groups (e.g. formyl, trifiuoroacetyl, acetyl), aromatic urethane type protecting groups (e.g, benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) and substituted Cbz), aliphatic urethane protecting groups (e.g. 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc), t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), isopropyloxycarbonyl, cyclohexyloxycarbonyl) and alkyl type protecting groups (e.g. benzyl, trityl, chlorofrityl). Examples of suitable oxygen protecting groups may include for example alky silyl groups, such as trimethylsilyl or tert-butyldimethylsilyl; afkyl others such as tetrahydropyranyl or tert-butyl; or esters such as acelate.<br>
Pharmaceutical acceptable salts may also be prepared from other salts, including other pharmaceutically acceptable salts, of the compound of formula (I) using conventional methods.<br>

When a specific enantiomer of a compound of general formula (1) is required, this may be obtained for example by resolution of a corresponding enantiomeric mixture of a compound of formula (I) using conventional methods. Thus the required enantiomer may be obtained from the racemic compound of formula (I) by use of chiral HPLC procedure.<br>
The subject invention also includes isotopically-labelted compounds, which are identical to those recited in formula (I) and following, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature.

Compounds of the present invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds that contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of the present invention, Isotopically-tabelled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as SH, 14C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated, I.e., 3H, and carbon-14, i.e.,11C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. 11C and 18F isotopes are particularly useful in PET (positron emission tomography), and 125I isotopes are particularly useful in SPECT {single photon emission computerized tomography), afl useful in brain imaging. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopicaliy labelled compounds of formula I and following of this invention can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples below, by substituting a readily available isotopically labelled reagent fora non-isotopically labelled reagent.<br>

While it is possible that, for use in therapy, a compound of the present invention may be administered as the raw chemical, it is preferable to present the active ingredient as a pharmaceutical formulation e. g. when the agent is in admixture with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient, diluent or carrier selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or excipient. The carrier and/or excipient must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deletrious to the recipient thereof.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention further provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising at least one compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or excipient. The carrier and/or excipient must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deietrious to the receipient thereof.<br>
There is further provided by the present Invention a process of preparing a pharmaceutical composition, which process comprises mixing at least one compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or excipient.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be for human or animal usage in human and veterinary medicine and will typically comprise any one or more of a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier or excipient. Acceptable carriers or diluents for therapeutic use are well known in the pharmaceutical art, and are described, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co. (A. R. Gennaro edit. 1985). The choice of pharmaceutical carrier, excipient or diluent can be selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The pharmaceutical compositions may comprise as - or in addition to - the carrier, excipient or diluent any suitable binder(s), lubricant(s), suspending agent(s), coating agent(s), solubilising agent(s).<br>
Preservatives, stabilisers, dyes and even flavouring agents may be provided in the pharmaceutical composition. Examples of preservatives include sodium benzoate, sorbic acid and esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid. Antioxidants and suspending agents may be also used.<br>
There may be different composition/formulation requirements dependent on the different delivery systems. By way of example, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be formulated to be delivered using a mini-pump or by a mucosal route, for example, as a nasal spray or aerosol for inhalation or ingestible solution, or parenterally In which the composition is formulated by an Injectable form, for delivery, by, for example, an intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous route. Alternatively, the formulation may be designed to be delivered by both routes.<br>
Where the agent is to be delivered mucosally through the gastrointestinal mucosa, it<br><br>
should be able to remain stable during transit though the gastrointestinal tract; for example, it should be resistant to proteolytic degradation, stable at acid pH and resistant to the detergent effects of bile.<br>
Where appropriate, the pharmaceutical compositions can be administered by inhalation, in the form of a suppository or pessary, topically in the form of a lotion, solution, cream, ointment or dusting powder, by use of a skin patch, orally in the form of tablets containing excipients such as starch or lactose, or in capsules or ovules either alone or in admixture with excipients, or in the form of elixirs, solutions or suspensions containing flavouring or colouring agents, or they can be injected parenterally, for example intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously. For parenteral administration, the compositions may be best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may contain other substances, for example enough salts or monosaccharides to make the solution isotonic with blood. For buccal or sublingual administration the compositions may be administered in the form of tablets or lozenges which can be formulated in a conventional manner.<br>
For some embodiments, the agents of the present invention may also be used in combination with a cyclodextrin. Cyclodextrins are known to form inclusion and non-inclusion complexes with drug molecules. Formation of a drug-cyclodextrin complex may modify the solubility, dissolution rate, bioavailability and/or stability property of a drug molecule. Drug-cyclodextrin complexes are generally useful for most dosage forms and administration routes. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug the cyclodextrin may be used as an auxiliary additive, e. g. as a carrier, diluent or solubiliser. Alpha-, beta and gamma-cyclodextrins are most commonly used and suitable examples are described in WO-A-91/11172, WO-A-94/02518 and WO-A-98/55148.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the agents of the present invention are delivered systemically (such as orally, buccally, sublingually), more preferably orally.,<br>
Hence, preferably the agent is in a form that is suitable for oral delivery.<br>
It is to be understood that not all of the compounds need be administered by the same route. Likewise, if the composition comprises more than one active component, then those components may be administered by different routes.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be milled using known milling procedures such as wet milling to obtain a particle size appropriate for tablet formation and for other formulation types. Finely divided (nanoparticulate) preparations of the compounds of the invention may be prepared by processes known in the art, for example see International Patent Application No. WO 02/00196 (SmithKline Beecham).<br>
For oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the form of, for example, tablets or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipients such as binding agents (e.g. pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g. lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or calcium hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate. talc or silica); disintegrants (e.g. potato starch or sodium starch glycollate); or wetting agents (e.g. sodium lauryl sulphate). The tablets may be coated by methods well known in the art. Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, for example, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g. sorbitol syrup, cellulose derivatives or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (e.g. lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g. almond oil, oily esters, ethyl alcohol or fractionated vegetable oils); and preservatives (e.g. methyl or propyl-p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid). The preparations may also contain buffer salts, flavouring, colouring and sweetening agents as appropriate.<br>
Preparations for oral administration may be suitably formulated to give controlled release of the active compound.<br>
For buccal administration the composition may take the form of tablets or formulated in conventional manner.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be formulated for parenteral administration by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form e.g. in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilising and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be formulated for topical administration in the form of ointments, creams, gels, lotions, pessaries, aerosols or drops (e.g. eye, ear or nose drops). Ointments and creams may, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable thickening and/or gelling agents. Ointments for administration to the eye may be manufactured in a sterile manner using sterilised components.<br>
Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in general also contain one or more emulsifying agents, stabilising agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, or colouring agents. Drops may be formulated with an aqueous or non-aqueous base also comprising one or more dispersing agents, stabilising agents, solubilising agents or suspending agents. They may also contain a preservative.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g. containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
Trie compounds of the invention may aiso be formulated as depot preparations. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds of the invention may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt.<br>
For intranasal administration, the compounds of the invention may be formulated as solutions for administration via a suitable metered or unitary dose device or alternatively as a powder mix with a suitable carrier for administration using a suitable delivery device.<br>
A proposed dose of the compounds of the invention is 1 to about 1000mg per day. It will be appreciated that it may be necessary to make routine variations to the dosage, depending on the age and condition of the patient and the precise dosage will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or veterinarian. The dosage will also depend on the route of administration and the particular compound selected. Thus for parenteral administration a daily dose will typically be in the range of 1 to about 100 mg, preferably 1 to 80 mg per day. For oral administration a daily dose will typically be within the range 1 to 300 mg e.g. 1 to 100 mg.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
in the Intermediates and Examples unless otherwise stated:<br>
All temperatures refer to °C. Infrared spectra were measured on a FT-IR instrument. Compounds were analysed by direct infusion of the sample dissolved in acetonitrile into a mass spectra operated in positive electro spray (ES+) ionisation mode. Proton Magnetic Resonance (+H-NMR) spectra were recorded at 400 MHz, chemical shifts are reported in ppm downfield (d) from Me4Si, used as internal standard, and are assigned as singlets (s), broad singlets (bs), doublets (d), doublets of doublets (dd), triplets (t), quartets (q) or multisets (m). A strategy comprising of NOE (Nuclear Overhauser Effect) correlation and/or 1H.15N long range scalar correlations measurements has been implemented in order to allow elucidation of possible regio-isomers structure of compounds of the present invention. Proposed structures were verified by measurement of the vicinity in the space of key hydrogens, thus 1D Nuclear Overhauser difference spectra were used to measure 1H,1 H-dipole-dipole correlations.<br>
In cases where NOE measurements were not conclusive, 1H.15N long range scalar correlations were measured via 1H.15N-HMBC experiments. A delay corresponding to an average long range scalar coupling 2,3J(1H,15IM) of 6Hz was set for optimal result. Column chromathography was carried out over silica gel (Merck AG Darmstaadt, Germany).

EXAMPLE 12 CRF Binding Activity<br>
CRF binding affinity has been determined in vitro by the compounds' ability to displace 125l-oCRF and 125l-Sauvagine for CRF1 and CRF2 SPA, respectively, from recombinant human CRF receptors expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell membranes. For membrane preparation, CHO cells from confluent T-flasks were collected in SPA buffer (HEPES/KOH 50mM, EDTA 2mM, MgCI2 tOrnM, pH 7.4.) in 50mL centrifuge tubes, homogenized with a Polytron and centrifuged (50'OOOg for 5min at 4°C: Beckman centrifuge with JA20 rotor). The pellet was resuspended, homogenized and centrifuged as before.<br>
The SPA experiment has been carried out in Optiplate by the addition of 100 µL the reagent mixture to 1µL of compound dilution (100% DMSO solution) per well. The assay mixture was prepared by mixing SPA buffer, WGA SPA beads (2.5 mg/mL), BSA (1 mg/mL) and membranes (50 and 5 µg of protein/mL for CRF1 and CRF2 respectively) and 50 pM of radioligand.<br>
The plate was incubated overnight (&gt;18 hrs) at room temperature and read with the Packard Topcount with a WGA-SPA125I counting protocol.<br>
EXAMPLE 13 CRF functional assay<br>
Compounds of the invention were characterised in a functional assay for the determination of their inhibitory effect. Human CRF-CHO cells were stimulated with CRF and the receptor activation was evaluated by measuring the accumulation of cAMP. CHO cells from a confluent T-flask were resuspended with culture medium without G418 and dispensed in a 96-well plate, 25'OOOc/well, 100 µL/well and incubated overnight. After the incubation the medium was replaced with 100 uL of cAMP IBMX buffer warmed at 37°C (5mM KCI, 5mM NaHCO3, 154mM NaCI, 5mM HEPES, 2.3mM CaCI2, 1mM MgCIa, 1g/L glucose, pH 7.4 addltioned by 1mg/mL BSA and 1mM IBMX) and 1µL of antagonist dilution in neat DMSO. After 10 additional minutes of incubation at 37°C in a plate incubator without CO2, 1µL of agonist dilution in neat DMSO was added. As before, the plate was incubated for 10 minutes and then cAMP cellular content was measured by using the Amersham RPA 538 kit.<br>
