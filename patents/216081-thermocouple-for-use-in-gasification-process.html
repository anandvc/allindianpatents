				<td>THERMOCOUPLE FOR USE IN GASIFICATION PROCESS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to a thermocouple used in a gasification process and,<br>
more particularly, to the use of sapphire to extend the useful life of thermocouples used in a<br>
gasification process.<br>
BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In high temperature gasification processes, a hot partial oxidation gas is produced from<br>
hydrocarbonaceous fuels, for example coal. In these processes, the hydrocarbonaceous fuels are<br>
reacted with a reactive oxygen-containing gas, such as air or oxygen, in a gasification reactor to<br>
obtain the hot partial oxidation gas.<br>
In a typical gasification process, the hot partial oxidation gas will substantially comprise<br>
H2, CO2 and at least one gas from the group H2O, CO2, H2S, COS, NH3, N2, Ar, along with<br>
particulate carbon, ash, and/or molten slag typically containing species such as SiO2,. Al2O3, and<br>
the oxides and oxysulfides of metals such as Fe and Ca.<br>
The hot partial oxidation gas in the gasification reactor will commonly be at a<br>
temperature ranging from 1,700°F (927°C) to 3.000° F (1649°C), and more typically in the range<br>
of about 2,000°F (1093°C) to 2,800° F (1538°C). and at a pressure commonly in the range of<br>
about 1 atmosphere (98 kPa) to about 250 atmospheres (24.500 kPa), and more typically in the<br>
range of about 15 atmospheres (1,470 kPa) to 150 atmospheres (14,700 kPa).<br>
Thermocouples are commonly used for measuring temperature in these high temperature<br>
processes. The thermocouples can be used to measure the temperature in the gasification<br>
reactor. They may also be used to measure the temperature in downstream process steps in<br>
which the effluent is cooled and paniculate and gaseous contaminants are removed.<br><br>
Thermocouples are pairs of wires of dissimilar metals which are connected at both ends.<br>
The content of the wires must be sufficiently dissimilar to allow for a difference in electrical<br>
potential between them. Except for the ends, the two wires are electrically insulated from each<br>
other. The electrical insulation is commonly provided by a tube of insulating material having<br>
two non-intersecting holes passing lengthwise through the tube. Typical insulating materials<br>
include high temperature, high purity ceramics, such as alumina.<br>
When the two junctions of the wires are at different temperatures, a difference in<br>
electrical potential exists between them. The difference in electrical potential and therefore the<br>
difference in temperature can be measured by a voltage measuring instrument placed in the<br>
thermocouple circuit or alternatively by a voltage measuring instrument that is sent signals by a<br>
transmitter placed in the thermocouple circuit.<br>
The choice of dissimilar metals used for the thermocouple will vary depending on,<br>
among other things, the expected temperature range to be measured. For instance, one type of<br>
thermocouple commonly employed under the conditions present in a gasification reactor has one<br>
wire that contains platinum and about 30% rhodium and a second wire that contains platinum<br>
and about 6% rhodium. Other pairs of metals are used for different temperature ranges.<br>
One problem apparent with the use of thermocouples in the environment present in a<br>
gasification process, particularly the environment present in the gasification reactor, is the<br>
relatively short lifespan of the thermocouples. The relatively short lifespan is due in part to the<br>
extremely high temperatures and corrosive atmosphere that prevails during the operation of the<br>
gasification reactor. An unprotected thermocouple left in this environment is quickly attacked<br>
and rendered useless. Such attack can be most severe when the thermocouple comes into contact<br>
with molten slag present in the reactor.<br><br>
To alleviate this problem, thermocouples are commonly inserted into a refractory<br>
thermowell disposed along the outer wall of a gasification reactor or other exterior process<br>
surface. The refractory thermowells would include barriers of chrome-magnesia, high chrome,<br>
or similar slag resistant materials, and may incorporate other refractory and non-refractory<br>
materials such as A12O3, MgO, and stainless steel.<br>
When used in a gasification reactor, the thermowell may be introduced by passing it<br>
through an opening in the outer wall of the reactor pressure vessel. The thermowell may then<br>
pass through a corresponding opening in a refractory material, or series of refractory materials,<br>
commonly used to line the inner surface of the reactor pressure vessel. The thermowell may<br>
extend into the open space of the reactor or it may be set back at a slight distance from the<br>
interior of the reactor.<br>
Unfortunately, positioning the thermocouple inside a thermowell has not provided a<br>
complete solution. Over time, molten slag will breach the thermowell. The breach is commonly<br>
due to the effects of erosion and corrosion as well as thermal and/or mechanical stress.<br>
However, the breach may also be due, totally or in part, to an inherent fault in the thermowell.<br>
The breach, typically small initially, allows molten slag to enter the thermowell where it can<br>
come in contact with the thermocouple, rendering it useless.<br>
It would therefore be beneficial to have a means to increase the lifespan of thermocouples<br>
used in a gasification process.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, an improved apparatus<br>
comprising a thermocouple for measuring the temperature in a gasification process. The<br>
improvement comprises a sapphire envelope for enclosing at least a portion of the thermocouple.<br>
The sapphire envelope may be in the form of a sapphire sheath fitted over the thermocouple.<br><br>
The apparatus may also comprise a thermowell, with the sapphire envelope being provided by<br>
the thermowell.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention, an improved apparatus for measuring<br>
the temperature in a gasification process comprising a thermowell and one or more<br>
thermocouples is provided. The improvement comprises a sapphire envelope for enclosing at<br>
least a portion of at least one thermocouple. The sapphire envelope may be in the form of a<br>
sapphire sheath fitted over the thermocouple. The thermowell may contain at least one barrier<br>
layer comprised of sapphire, with the sapphire envelope being equivalent to the barrier layer<br>
comprised of sapphire.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS<br>
Gaseous mixtures substantially comprising H2,. CO, and at least one gas from the group<br>
H2O, CO2, H2S, COS, NH3, N2, Ar, along with particulate carbon, ash and/or molten slag<br>
typically containing species such as SiO2. Al2O3, and the oxides and oxysulfides of metals such<br>
as Fc and Ca are commonly produced by well known partial oxidation processes in the reaction<br>
zone of a free-flow, down-flowing vertical refractory lined steel pressure vessel. An example of<br>
such a process and pressure vessel are shown and described in coassigned U.S. Patent No.<br>
2,818,326 hereby incorporated by reference. In such a process, the partial oxidation gas will<br><br>
typically be subjected to cooling and additional purification steps in which particulate<br>
contaminants, gaseous contaminants, and water vapor are removed.<br>
The partial oxidation gas produced from such a process will, depending on chemical<br>
composition and intended end use, commonly be referred to as synthesis gas, fuel gas. or<br>
reducing gas. The generic partial oxidation gas will be referred to herein as encompassing all of<br>
these potentialities.<br>
The feed used to produce the partial oxidation gas comprises hydrocarbonaceous fuels.<br>
The term "hydrocarbonaceous"" as used herein to describe various suitable feedstocks is intended<br>
to include gaseous, liquid, and solid hydrocarbons, carbonaceous materials, and mixtures<br>
thereof. In fact, substantially any combustible carbon-containing organic material, or slurries<br>
thereof, may be included within the definition of the term "hydrocarbonaceous". For example,<br>
there are (1) pumpable slurries of solid carbonaceous fuels, such as particulate carbon dispersed<br>
in a vaporizable liquid carrier, such as water, liquid hydrocarbon fuel, and mixtures thereof; and<br>
(2) gas-liquid-solid dispersions, such as atomized liquid hydrocarbon fuel and particulate carbon<br>
dispersed in a temperature moderating gas.<br>
The term "liquid hydrocarbon," as used herein to describe suitable liquid feedstocks, is<br>
intended to include various materials, such as liquefied petroleum gas. petroleum distillates and<br>
residua, gasoline, naphtha, kerosene, crude petroleum, asphalt, gas oil. residual oil. tar-sand oil<br>
and shale oil, coal derived oil. aromatic hydrocarbons (such as benzene, toluene, xylene<br>
fractions), coal tar. cycle gas oil from fluid-catalytic-cracking operations, furfural extract of<br>
coker gas oil. and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
"Gaseous hydrocarbons,"1 as used herein to describe suitable gaseous feedstocks, include<br>
methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, natural gas. coke-oven gas, refinery gas, acetylene<br>
tail gas, ethylene off-gas, and mixtures thereof.<br>
"Solid hydrocarbon fuels," as used herein to describe suitable solid feedstocks, include,<br>
coal in the form of anthracite, bituminous, subbituminous; lignite; coke; residue derived from<br>
coal liquefaction; peat; oil shale; tar sands; petroleum coke; pitch; paniculate carbon (soot or<br>
ash); solid carbon-containing waste materials, such as sewage; and mixtures thereof.<br>
Solid, gaseous, and liquid feeds may be mixed and used simultaneously; and these may<br>
include paraffinic, olefinic, acetylenic, naphthenic, and aromatic compounds in any proportion.<br>
Also included within the definition of the term "hydrocarbonaceous" are oxygenated<br>
hydrocarbonaceous organic materials including carbohydrates, cellulosic materials, aldehydes,<br>
organic acids, alcohols, ketones, oxygenated fuel oil. waste liquids and by-products from<br>
chemical processes containing oxygenated hydrocarbonaceous organic materials, and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
In the reaction zone of a gasification reactor, the hydrocarbonaceous fuel is contacted<br>
with a free-oxygen containing gas. optionally in the presence of a temperature moderator. The<br>
reaction time will typically be in the range of about 1 to 10 seconds, and preferably about 2 to 6<br>
seconds. In the reaction zone, the contents will commonly reach temperatures in the range of<br>
about 1,700°F (927°C) to 3.000° F (1649°C). and more typically in the range of about 2.000° F<br>
(1093°C) to 2,800° F (1538°C). Pressure will typically be in the range of about latmophere (98<br>
kPa) to about 250 atmospheres (24.500 kPa). and more typically in the range of about 15<br>
atmospheres (1.470 kPa) to about 150 atmospheres (14,700 kPa). As the partial oxidation gas<br><br>
proceeds downstream, the temperature of the flow will be reduced as the gas is subjected to<br>
various cooling, washing, and other steps.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, temperature may be measured at various<br>
locations within the gasification process by thermocouples having employed therewith a<br>
sapphire envelope. The use of a sapphire envelope in accordance with the various embodiments<br>
of the invention, amongst other advantages, increases the useful life of the thermocouple over<br>
conventional thermocouples. In its various embodiments, the sapphire envelope will enclose at<br>
least a portion of a thermocouple with which it is employed. The use of the sapphire envelope is<br>
particularly advantageous when it is used in conjunction with thermocouples positioned so as to<br>
measure the temperature in the gasification reactor, as the detrimental effects of high<br>
temperatures, molten slag, and corrosives are most prevalent in the reactor.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the sapphire envelope is manifested in the<br>
form of a sapphire sheath 24 that fits over at least a portion of a thermocouple. In this<br>
embodiment, illustrated in Figure 1. a thermocouple 10 is provided. The thermocouple 10 is<br>
comprised of a pair of wires 12 and 14. The wires have dissimilar metal content such that a<br>
difference in electrical potential can develop between them when the thermocouple is exposed to<br>
a heat source. The wires, for example, may both contain platinum and rhodium as their primary<br>
substituents with the amounts of platinum and rhodium being different in the two wires.<br>
Preferably one of the wires has about 30% rhodium while the other wire has about 6% rhodium.<br>
For both wires, the remainder is primarily platinum.<br>
The wires are joined to each other at a hot junction 16 and cold junction 18. The terms<br>
"hot" and "cold" arc used because when employed to measure the temperature of a gasification<br>
reactor the hot junction 16 is positioned closer to the heat source. The difference between the<br><br>
electrical potential of the two wires, being representative of the temperature at the hot end, is<br>
measured. It is not critical how the difference in potential is measured. In fact, various means<br>
are known to those of ordinary skill in the art for measuring the difference in electrical potential.<br>
Any of these methods can be used in the present invention. For example, a voltage meter can be<br>
placed in the thermocouple circuit. Alternatively, and preferably, the cold junction 18 is<br>
provided at a temperature transmitter. The signal generated by the temperature transmitter can<br>
then be relayed to a control room or other location by signal transfer means 20.<br>
Except for the hot and cold junctions, the two wires 12 and 14 are otherwise electrically<br>
insulated from each other. While it is not critical how insulated, in this embodiment, the<br>
electrical insulation 22 is provided by a high temperature, high purity ceramic tube. Such a<br>
ceramic tube can be made of, for example, alumina.<br>
If the thermocouple disclosed to this point was utilized alone or in combination with a<br>
typical thermowell in order to measure the temperature of a gasification reactor, the<br>
thermocouple would, as disclosed, succumb to the slag and other detrimental materials present in<br>
the reactor relatively quickly. It is for this reason that in the present embodiment a sapphire<br>
sheath 24 is provided to fit over at least a portion of the thermocouple. The sapphire sheath 24 is<br>
substantially resistant to attack from the slag and other products of the gasification process. The<br>
completed thermocouple, comprising the improved sapphire sheath 24, can thus be viewed as<br>
having a distal end 26 adjacent to the hot junction 16.<br>
It is necessary that the sapphire sheath 24 enclose at least the hot junction 16. Preferably,<br>
and as subsequently detailed, the sapphire sheath 24 will be of sufficient length such that before<br>
the molten slag reaches the top of the sapphire sheath 24 the molten slag will cool and reach a<br>
state of nominal or zero flow or a breach will form at some other point on the sapphire sheath.<br><br>
In the present embodiment, the sapphire sheath 24 is substantially tubular having an<br>
enclosed end. being equivalent to the distal end 26 of the thermocouple, and an open end 28, the<br>
opening at the open end 28 being capable of receiving and fitting over the existing thermocouple<br>
comprised of the two wires 12 and 14 and the electrical insulation 22 surrounding and insulating<br>
the wires. In a variation of the embodiment, an enlarged plug 30 of sapphire is provided at the<br>
enclosed end of the sapphire sheath 24. The enlarged plug 30 increases the time it takes for the<br>
slag to penetrate the sapphire sheath 24. The presence of enlarged plug 30, in its simplest form,<br>
may be due to the fact that the sheath may be inherently thicker at the enclosed end than on its<br>
sides.<br>
In the present embodiment, the sapphire sheath 24 fits over and covers only a portion of<br>
the existing thermocouple. The open end 28 advantageously should fit tightly over electrical<br>
insulation 22. Platinum foil wrapped around the electrical insulation 22 or wrapped around the<br>
inner surface of the sheath 24 can be advantageously used to provide a good fit for the sapphire<br>
sheath 24. In other embodiments, the sapphire sheath 24 may extend over and cover a larger<br>
portion, if not substantially all of the existing thermocouple. In still other embodiments,<br>
sapphire may be used to both electrically insulate the two wires as well as sheath the wires. In<br>
such an embodiment, the sapphire sheath 24 and the electrical insulation 22 would both be<br>
comprised of sapphire.<br>
In other embodiments of the invention, any one of the disclosed thermocouples having a<br>
sapphire sheath 24 is advantageously combined with a thermowell. The combined apparatus is<br>
advantageously used to measure the temperature in a gasification process, particularly in a<br>
gasification reactor. Any thermowell commonly used or subsequently developed by one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art can be employed. Such thermowells would include barriers of chrome-<br><br>
magnesia, high chrome, or similar slag resistant materials, and may incorporate other refractory<br>
and non-refractory materials such as Al2O3, MgO, and stainless steel.<br>
In a preferred thermowell, illustrated in combination with a thermocouple of the present<br>
invention in Figure 2, the thermowell is comprised of an inner protection tube 62 and an outer<br>
protection tube 64. The inner protection tube 62 can be formed from a high density low porosity<br>
refractory, such as alumina or magnesia. A castable refractory material, typically a high density<br>
low porosity refractory, is then poured around the inner protection tube 62 and allowed to set so<br>
as to form the outer protection tube 64 around all but the opening of the inner protection tube 62.<br>
Preferably, this castable high density low porosity refractory material is comprised of chromium<br>
oxide or chromia-magnesia.<br>
In this embodiment the thermocouple 10 is inserted into the thermowell, distal end 26<br>
first. The thermocouple 10 is passed through a flanged reducer 76 and into the thermowell in<br>
contact with and mated to the flanged reducer 76. The distal end 26 of the thermocouple 10 is<br>
positioned adjacent to the tip 66 of the thermowell. A gap of about 0.125inches (3.18x10-1 m) to<br>
about 0.25 inches (6.35x10-3 m) is preferably maintained between the inside surface of tip 66 of<br>
the thermowell and the distal end 26 of the thermocouple.<br>
The upstream ends of the wires 12 and 14 of the thermocouple 10 extend past the back<br>
end of the electrical insulation 22. and/or the sapphire sheath 24 if the sheath is coterminous with<br>
the electrical insulation 22. The wires pass through a pressure sealing fitting 70. The pressure<br>
sealing fitting 70 contacts a bushing 72 which fits into a removable flange 74. The flange 74<br>
mates with flange reducer 76 that is mated to the outer steel wall 40 of the pressure vessel<br>
gasification reactor.<br><br>
The thermocouple 10 and thermowell assembly is held in place by bolting or clamping<br>
together flange 74 to flange reducer 76 and similarly bolting or clamping together flange reducer<br>
76 to the outer steel wall 40 of the pressure vessel gasification reactor. The use of two separate<br>
connections provides for increased efficiency in that a thermocouple 10 can be replaced without<br>
removing the thermowell. Instead of mating flanges, threaded caps and nozzles or other<br>
connection means can be used.<br>
The thermowell, with or without attached thermocouple 10, is passed in succession<br>
straight through a hole in the steel wall 40 of the pressure vessel gasification reactor and then<br>
through an aligned hole in the refractory 42 lining the wall on the inside of the pressure vessel.<br>
The tip 66 of the thermowell is preferably positioned so as to be retracted from about 0.25 to<br>
about 0.75 inches (0.019m), preferably 0.5 inches (0.0127 m). from the face of the refractory 42<br>
lining the inside steel wall of the pressure vessel reactor. In this manner, the rate of erosion is<br>
reduced as opposed to when the tip 66 of the thermowell is positioned even with the face of the<br>
refractor}" 42 or beyond the face of the refractory 42.<br>
The thermocouple 10 and thermowell assembly positioned in a gasification reactor<br>
exhibits increased resistance to slag. In the gasification reactor, molten slag 50 deposits out on<br>
the inside walls of the refractory 42 lining the inside steel wall of the pressure vessel reactor.<br>
The molten slag 50 will migrate toward the thermowell. As disclosed, over time the effects of<br>
erosion and corrosion as well as thermal and/or mechanical stress may cause a small breach in<br>
the tip 66 of the thermowell. When this occurs, the molten slag 50 will, moving toward cool<br>
spots, migrate through the breach and enter the inner protection tube 62, thereby coming in<br>
contact with the sapphire sheathed thermocouple. Advantageously, with the sapphire sheath 24.<br>
the wires 12 and 14 and hot junction 16 are shielded from the molten slag 50 and its destructive<br><br>
effects. The molten slag 50 will continue to migrate up the interior of the inner protection tube<br>
62 until it cools to the point at which it achieves a state of zero or nominal flow. Because of this,<br>
the sapphire sheath 24 should be of sufficient length such that before the slag can reach the open<br>
end 28 of the sapphire sheath 24, one of two things will occur: the molten slag 50 will achieve<br>
thermal equilibrium, cool, and achieve a state of nominal or zero flow; or a breach will form at<br>
some other point on the sapphire sheath. This second possibility might occur first when the<br>
effects of erosion and corrosion as well as thermal and/or mechanical stress cause the entire tip<br>
66 of the thermowell to be removed. When this occurs, the sapphire sheath 24 becomes onset by<br>
the full effects of erosion and corrosion in the gasification reactor. A breach ultimately forms in<br>
the sapphire sheath 24. With the wires 12 and 14 and the hot junction 16 unprotected, the<br>
thermocouple 10 fails. The selection of an appropriate length for the sapphire sheath 24 is<br>
within the skill of one of ordinary skill in the art having knowledge of the characteristics of their<br>
specific process, including temperature and gas composition, and having the benefit of this<br>
disclosure.<br>
In other embodiments, one or more, and preferably three, thermocouples are inserted into<br>
a thermowell having at least a corresponding number of inner protection tubes 62. In such a<br>
preferred embodiment, the distal ends of the one or more thermocouples are advantageously<br>
positioned at different points along the length of the thermowell. This arrangement provides for<br>
increased times between thermocouple and thermowell replacement. For example, in an<br>
embodiment in which a total of three thermocouples are used, slag ultimately penetrating the<br>
thermowell will reach the thermocouple positioned closest to the tip 66 first. This thermocouple<br>
will subsequently fail. It then takes an additional amount of time for the slag to reach and cause<br>
the failures of the second and third thermocouples. Thus, the process can be run longer without<br><br>
need for shut down. While the accuracy provided by the second and third thermocouples is not<br>
as good as the first thermocouple, the difference does not pose a problem for process control as<br>
the readings for the second and third thermocouples may be corrected based on data gathered<br>
prior to the failure of the first thermocouple.<br>
In other embodiments, the sapphire envelope can be provided by utilizing a thermowell<br>
fabricated wholly or in part from sapphire. Such a thermowell could have sapphire, preferably in<br>
the form of sapphire fiber, intermixed throughout the thermowell. Such a thermowell could also<br>
have at least one substantially continuous barrier layer comprised of sapphire. These<br>
thermowells could be used with a thermocouple that did not have a separate sapphire sheath.<br>
Alternatively, these thermowells could be employed with sapphire sheathed thermocouples. In<br>
one illustrative embodiment of a thermowell having at least one substantially continuous barrier<br>
layer comprised of sapphire, an inner protection tube 62 of the thermowell could be formed of<br>
sapphire.<br>
In other embodiments, a thermocouple having a sapphire sheath could be used without a<br>
thermowell to measure the temperature in a gasification process. However, this alternative is not<br>
preferred where the thermocouple would be exposed to molten slag. While a thermocouple<br>
sheathed with sapphire will withstand the full effects of erosion and corrosion in the gasification<br>
reactor for a longer time than a thermocouple not having a sapphire shield, the use of a<br>
thermocouple having a sapphire shield in conjunction with a thermowell dramatically increases<br>
the lifespan of the thermocouple so used.<br><br>
