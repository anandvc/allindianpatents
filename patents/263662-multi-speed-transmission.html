CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
100011 This application claims the benefit of United States Provisional Application<br>
Number 60/909,156, filed March 30, 2007, which is hereby incorporated by reference<br>
in its entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
10002]	This invention relates to a multi-speed transmission for a vehicle<br>
providing a plurality of forward speed ratios and at least one reverse speed ratio<br>
through selective engagement of five torque-transmitting mechanisms located in a<br>
selected /one or zones of the transmission.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
|0003)	Multi-speed transmissions in automotive vehicles allow for operating<br>
efficiency and smooth feel. Multiple planetary gear sets have been utilized to provide<br>
eight or more forward speed ratios with relatively efficient packaging due to the<br>
compact nature of planetary gear sets. A number of selectively engagable torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms are controlled to interconnect different members of the<br>
planetary gear sets with one another, with the transmission casing, or sometimes with<br>
the transmission input or output member to achieve the various speed ratios. Efficient<br>
packaging of the torque-transmitting mechanisms helps to minimize the overall<br>
dimensions of the transmission, potentially allowing its use in more vehicle platforms,<br>
reducing weight, and minimizing manufacturing complexity.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
10004)	A multi-speed transmission is provided with four planetary gear sets,<br>
each having a first, a second and a third rotatable member. Certain pairs of the<br>
members are continuously connected for common rotation. Specifically, the second<br>
member of the first planetary gear set is continuously connected for common rotation<br>
1<br><br>
with the first member of the second planetary gear set. The second member of the<br>
second planetary gear set is continuously connected for common rotation with the first<br>
member of the third planetary gear set. The second member of the third planetary gear<br>
set is continuously connected for common rotation with the first member of the fourth<br>
planetary gear set. The third member of the third planetary gear set is continuously<br>
connected for common rotation with the third member of the fourth planetary gear set.<br>
The third member of the first planetary gear set is grounded to the transmission casing.<br>
Preferably, an input member is continuously connected for common rotation with the<br>
first member of the first planetary gear set and an output member is continuously<br>
interconnected for common rotation with the first member of the fourth planetary gear<br>
set.<br>
10005)	Five torque-transmitting mechanisms are selectively engagable to connect<br>
selected members of the planetary gear sets for common rotation. The five torque<br>
transmitting mechanisms are engagable in different combinations to achieve eight<br>
forward speed ratios and a reverse speed ratio between the input member and the output<br>
member.<br>
100061	A transmission casing surrounds the planetary gear sets and torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms and defines a cavity having six different zones. The<br>
transmission casing includes opposing first and second end walls and a housing portion.<br>
As used herein, a "zone" is a portion of the cavity. A first zone extends axially from<br>
the first end wall to one of the planetary gear sets. A second, a third, and a fourth zone<br>
each extend between different adjacent pairs of the planetary gear sets. A fifth zone<br>
extends from another one of the planetary gear sets to the second end wall. Hach of the<br>
first, second, third, fourth, and fifth zones extend radially to an outer surface of a<br>
radially outermost one of the members. A sixth zone borders the first, second, third,<br>
fourth and fifth zones, extends radially outward to the housing portion and extends<br>
axially between the first and second walls.<br>
100071	Hach torque-transmitting mechanism may be located in selected ones of<br>
the zones that further desirability of (i) minimizing the overall size of the transmission,<br>
(ii) reducing weight, (iii) providing a convenient location for hydraulic feed to the<br>
2<br><br>
lorquc transmitting mechanism, such as by locating the torque-transmitting mechanism<br>
close to the transmission casing or to a centrally-located shaft, both of which typically<br>
define at least part of a feed path to supply hydraulic fluid to torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms, and (iv) reducing the overall complexity (e.g., the number, shape and size<br>
of hub members and other interconnecting members used to connect members of the<br>
planetary gear sets with one another or with the transmission casing). Different<br>
embodiments of the transmission are possible by arranging the planetary gear sets in a<br>
different order (e.g., the.order moving axially from the first end wall to the second end<br>
wall) in the transmission. The five torque-transmitting mechanisms are located in at<br>
least one of the six /ones in each such embodiment within the scope of the invention.<br>
100081	The five torque-transmitting mechanisms may include four rotating-typc<br>
clutches and one stationary-type clutch, with the stationary-type clutch grounding the<br>
second member of the fourth planetary gear set to the transmission housing.<br>
Alternatively, the five torque-transmitting mechanisms may all be rotating-typc<br>
clutches.<br>
|0009J	Preferably, the first, second, and third members of each planetary gear<br>
set are a ring gear member, a carrier member, and a sun gear member, although not<br>
necessarily in that order. Preferably, the input member is continuously interconnected<br>
for common rotation with the carrier member of the first planetary gear set; the ring<br>
gear member of the first planetary gear set is continuously connected for common<br>
rotation with the sun gear member of the second planetary gear set; the ring gear<br>
member of the third planetary gear set is continuously connected for common rotation<br>
with the carrier member of the fourth planetary gear set; the sun gear member of the<br>
first planetary gear set is grounded to the transmission casing; the ring gear member of<br>
the second planetary gear set is continuously connected for common rotation with the<br>
carrier member of the third planetary gear set; the sun gear member of the third<br>
planetary gear set is continuously connected for common rotation with the sun gear<br>
member of the fourth planetary gear set; and the output member is continuously<br>
connected for common rotation with the carrier member of the fourth planetary gear<br>
set.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
|0019]	Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers refer to like<br>
components. Figure 1A shows a transmission 10 having an input member 12 for<br>
receiving power from a power source such as an internal combustion engine and output<br>
4<br><br>
member 14 lor delivering power to a final drive mechanism such as the wheels of a<br>
vehicle. The transmission 10 includes a gearing arrangement 16 having four planetary<br>
gear sets 20, 30, 40 and 50 and five selectively engagable torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms 60, 62, 64, 66, and 68. Only that portion of the transmission 10 above an<br>
axis of rotation 69 of the input and output members 12, 14 is shown. Those skilled in<br>
the art will recognize that the planetary gear sets 20, 30, 40 and 50 as well as torque<br>
transmitting mechanisms 60, 62, 64, 66, and 68 are symmetrical about the axis of<br>
rotation 69. Kach planetary gear set 20, 30, 40 and 50 includes concentric rotatable<br>
components. Specifically, planetary gear set 20 includes a sun gear member 22, a ring<br>
gear member 24 and a carrier member 26 that rotatably supports a plurality of pinion<br>
gears 27 that intermesh with both the sun gear member 22 and the ring gear member<br>
24. Planetary gear set 30 includes a sun gear member 32, a ring gear member 34 and a<br>
carrier member 36 that rotatably supports a plurality of pinion gears 37 that intermesh<br>
with both the sun gear member 32 and the ring gear member 34. Planetary gear set 40<br>
includes a sun gear member 42, a ring gear member 44 and a carrier member 46 that<br>
rotatably supports a plurality of pinion gears 47 that intermesh with both the sun gear<br>
member 42 and the ring gear member 44. Planetary gear set 50 includes a sun gear<br>
member 52, a ring gear member 54 and a carrier member 56 that rotatably supports a<br>
plurality of pinion gears 57 that intermesh with both the sun gear member 52 and the<br>
ring gear member 54.<br>
10020]	In referring to the first, second, third and fourth planetary gear sets in this<br>
description and in the claims, these sets may be counted "first" to "fourth" in any order in<br>
the drawings (i.e., left to right, right to left, etc.). Additionally, the first, second or third<br>
members of each gear set may be counted "first" to "third" in any order in the drawings<br>
(i.e.. top to bottom, bottom to top, etc.) for each gear set. In the embodiment of figure<br>
I A, planetary gear set 20 is the first planetary gear set, planetary gear set 30 is the second<br>
planetary gear set, planetary gear set 40 is the third planetary gear set. and planetary gear<br>
set 50 is the fourth planetary gear set.<br>
100211	The input member 12 is continuously connected for common rotation with<br>
carrier member 26. The output member 14 is continuously connected for common<br>
5<br><br>
rotation with carrier member 56. An interconnecting member 70 continuously<br>
interconnects ring gear member 24 for common rotation with sun gear member 32. An<br>
interconnecting member 72 continuously interconnects ring gear member 34 for common<br>
rotation with carrier member 46. An interconnecting member 74 continuously<br>
interconnects ring gear member 44 for common rotation with carrier member 56. An<br>
interconnecting member 76 continuously interconnects sun gear member 42 for common<br>
rotation with sun gear member 52. Each of the interconnecting members 70, 72, 74 and<br>
76 may be one component or multiple components. The sun gear member 22 is<br>
continuously grounded to a housing 80 (also referred to herein as a housing portion) of<br>
the transmission 10 via a radially-extending structural member 78. The housing 80<br>
circumlerentially surrounds the gear sets 20, 30, 40 and 50 as well as the torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms 60, 62, 64, 66 and 68. The transmission 10 further includes a<br>
first end wall 82 generally at one end of the transmission 10 and a second end wall 84<br>
generally at an opposing end of the transmission 10. The housing 80 joins the first and<br>
second end walls 82. 84. It should be appreciated that the housing 80 and the first and<br>
second end walls 82, 84 form a transmission casing and may be integrated, or may each<br>
be a separate component or components of the casing. The transmission casing will be<br>
referred to herein as 80, 82, 84. The transmission casing 80, 82, 84 defines a cavity 85.<br>
I he end walls 82 and 84 enclose the cavity $5 axially, but are likely a conical or irregular<br>
shape rather than a planar shape as schematically depicted.<br>
|0022|	The planetary gear sets 20, 30, 40, and 50 and torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms 60. 62, 64, 66 and 68 are located in the cavity 85. The transmission casing<br>
80, 82, 84 and the planetary gear sets 20, 30, 40, and 50 cooperate to define six spaces or<br>
/ones I \ I within the cavity 85. A first zone / is defined between an outer surface 86 of<br>
the first end wall 82 and a plane 91 running generally parallel with a side of the planetary<br>
gear set 20 adjacent the first end wall 82, and runs radially outward to a circumferential<br>
boundary 90 running along a radially-outermost surface of each of the ring gear members<br>
24, 34. 44 and 54. A second zone // is defined between a plane 92 running generally<br>
parallel along a side of the planetary gear set 20 facing the planetary gear set 30, a plane<br>
93 running generally parallel along a side of the planetary gear set 30 facing the planetary<br>
gear set 20 and the circumferential boundary 90. A third zone /// is defined between a<br>
6<br><br>
plane 94 running generally parallel along a side of the planetary gear set 30 faeing the<br>
planetary gear set 40, a plane 95 running generally parallel along a side of the planetary<br>
gear set 10 facing the planetary gear set 30 and the circumferential boundary 90. A<br>
fourth /one IV is defined between a plane 96 running generally parallel along a side of<br>
the planetary gear set 40 facing the planetary gear set 50, a plane 97 running generally<br>
parallel along a side of the planetary gear set 50 facing the planetary gear set 40 and the<br>
circumferential boundary 90. A fifth zone V'\s defined between a plane 98 running<br>
generally parallel along a side of the planetary gear set 50 facing the second end wall 84,<br>
an outer surface 87 of the second end wall 84 and the circumferential boundary 90. A<br>
sixth /one VI is defined between the circumferential boundary 90, an outer surface 89 of<br>
the housing 80, and the outer surfaces 86 and 87 of the first and second end walls 82 and<br>
84, respectively. The structural member 78 traverses zones /and VI.<br>
(00231	Torque-transmitting mechanisms 62, 64, 66 and 68 are rotating-type<br>
clutches and torque-transmitting mechanism 60 is a brake, also referred to as a reaction<br>
clutch or a stationary clutch. Torque-transmitting mechanism 60 is selectively cngagable<br>
lo ground ring gear member 54 to second end wall 84. The torque-transmitting<br>
mechanism 62 is selectively engagable to connect the ring gear member 24 for common<br>
rotation with the sun gear members 42 and 52. The torque-transmitting mechanism 64 is<br>
selectively engagable to connect the carrier member 26 for common rotation with the<br>
carrier member 36. The torque-transmitting mechanism 66 is selectively engagable to<br>
connect the input member 12 and the carrier member 26 for common rotation with the<br>
sun gear members 42 and 52. The torque-transmitting mechanism 68 is selectively<br>
engagable to connect the carrier member 36 for common rotation with ring gear member<br>
&gt;1.<br>
|0024|	The transmission 10 provides eight forward speed ratios and one reverse<br>
speed ratio between the input member 12 and the output member 14. Specifically, a<br>
reverse speed ratio is established by engaging torque-transmitting mechanisms 60 and 68;<br>
a first forward speed ratio is established by engaging torque-transmitting mechanisms 60<br>
and 66: a second forward speed ratio is established by engaging torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms 60 and 62; a third forward speed ratio is established by engaging torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms 60 and 64; a fourth forward speed ratio is established by<br>
7<br><br>
engaging torque-transmitting mechanisms 62 and 64; a fifth forward speed ratio is<br>
established by engaging torque-transmitting mechanisms 64 and 66; a sixth forward<br>
speed ratio is established by engaging torque-transmitting mechanisms 64 and 68; a<br>
seventh forward speed ratio is established by engaging torque-transmitting mechanisms<br>
66 and 68; and an eighth forward speed ratio is established by engaging torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms 62 and 68. Thus, all upshifts and downshifts between<br>
subsequent speed ratios are single transition shifts. Those skilled in the art will recognize<br>
that the combinations of torque-transmitting mechanisms described above provide eight<br>
different numerical speed ratios and a reverse speed ratio. Preferably, in all embodiments<br>
of the invention, the tooth ratios are selected so that at least two of the speed ratios arc<br>
overdrive ratios.<br>
|0025|	As shown in Figure 1 A, torque-transmitting mechanisms 62 and 66 arc<br>
located in /one //; and torque-transmitting mechanisms 60, 64 and 68 arc located in zone<br>
VI. Alternatively, the interconnections between the various gear members, the input<br>
member I ?.. the output member 14 and the transmission casing 80, 82, 84 obtained by<br>
selective engagement of the various torque-transmitting mechanisms 60, 62, 64. 66 and<br>
68 as described above are possible with the torque-transmitting mechanisms 60, 62, 64,<br>
66 and 68 disposed in other zones as shown in the chart of figure 1B. An "X" in the<br>
chart of figure 113 indicates that the particular torque-transmitting mechanism is<br>
positionablc in the referenced zone and an "O" indicates that the particular torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms are not to be located in the referenced zone. It should be<br>
appreciated that the selection of location for the torque-transmitting mechanism of each<br>
row in the chart of figure 1B is feasible independently of the other rows. Accordingly,<br>
torque-transmitting mechanism 60 is beatable in any of four of the six possible zones;<br>
torque-transmitting mechanism 62 is locatable in any of three of the six possible zones;<br>
torque-transmitting mechanism 64 is locatable in any of three of the six possible zones;<br>
torque transmitting mechanism 66 is locatable in any of four of the six possible zones;<br>
and torque-transmitting mechanism 68 is locatable in any of five of the six possible<br>
/ones.<br>

is the fourth planetary gear set.<br>
[0028|	Each planetary gear set 120, 130, 140 and 150 includes concentric<br>
rotatable components. Specifically, planetary gear set 120 includes a sun gear member<br>
122, a ring gear member 124 and a carrier member 126 that rotatably supports a plurality<br>
of pinion gears 127 that intermesh with both the sun gear member 122 and the ring gear<br>
