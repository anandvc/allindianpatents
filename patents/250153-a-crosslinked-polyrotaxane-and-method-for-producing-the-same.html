COMPOUND HAVING CROSSLINKED POLYROTAXANE AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a crosslinked polyrotaxane obtainedby crosslinkingpolyrotaxanes and amethod for producing the crosslinked polyrotaxane.  In particular, the present invention relates to a crosslinked polyrotaxane in which an OH group(s) included in a polyrotaxane is (are) substituted with a non-ionic group(s), and a method for producing the crosslinked polyrotaxane.<br>
Background Art<br>
Polyrotaxane is comprised of pseudopolyrotaxane, which comprises a linear molecule (axis) and cyclic molecules (rota) in which the linear molecule is included in cavities of cyclic molecules in a skewered manner , and capping groups , each of which locates at each end of the pseudopolyrotaxane (each end of the linear molecule) in order to prevent the dissociation of the cyclic molecules.  For example, a polyrotaxane having a-cyclodextrin (hereinafter cyclodextrin may be simply abbreviated as "CD") as cyclic molecules, and polyethylene glycol (hereinafter may be abbreviated as "PEG") as a linear molecule has been intensively studied in recent years for its various characteristics.<br>
Patent Document 2 discloses a compound comprising crosslinked polyrotaxane having characteristics as so-called<br><br>
slipping or sliding gels or a viscoelastic material. Particularly, Patent Document 2 discloses a specific cross linked polyrotaxane, wherein a molecule of polyrotaxane comprises a-CD molecule as a cyclic molecule and PEG as a linear molecule included in the cyclic molecule, and molecules of polyrotaxane are crosslinked (bonded) to each other through chemical bonding. However, a polyrotaxane , in which a linear molecule , PEG, is included in cyclic molecules, CD molecules, is insoluble in most solvents including water, and soluble only in dimethylsulfoxide (hereinafter, abbreviated as DMSO) and an alkaline aqueous solution when the linear molecule has a molecular weight of 10 , 000 or more .  Accordingly, when preparing a crosslinked polyrotaxane, a solution of polyrotaxane in the solvent described above is used as a raw material.  But, in order to use a crosslinked polyrotaxane stably, after preparing a crosslinked polyrotaxane, a solvent used in preparation, i.e., DMSO or an alkaline aqueous solution, must be replaced by pure water or saline.  There is, however, a problem that optical characteristics, especially transparency of the crosslinked polyrotaxane are worsened at this time. Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent No. 2810264. Patent Document 2: WO 01/83566.<br>

Effects of the invention<br>
The present invention can provide a crosslinked polyrotaxane prepared by linking molecules of polyrotaxane ttirough chemical bonding, which has excellent optical characteristics in water or saline, a compound comprising the crosslinked polyrotaxane and a method of preparing them.<br><br>
Preferred Embodiments for Carrying Out the Present Invention<br>
The present invention will be described in detail hereinafter.<br>
The present invention provides a polyrotaxane comprising a cyclodextrin in which a part of hydroxyl groups is substituted with a non-ionic group (s) , a cross linked polyrotaxane comprising at least two molecules of the polyrotaxane crosslinked through chemical bonding and a material comprising the crosslinked polyrotaxane.  The material comprising the crosslinked polyrotaxane may comprise water in addition to the crosslinked polyrotaxane.  The material may also comprise various components other than water unless characteristics of the material are impaired.<br>
The present invention can solve the problem caused by formation of hydrogen bondings among hydroxyl groups of CDs, or the problem in transparency and shrinkage of the crosslinked polyrotaxane, by substituting a part of the hydroxyl groups with a non-ionic group(s).<br>
The novel crosslinked polyrotaxane according to the present invention is specifically described with reference to Figures , comparing with a conventional crosslinked polyrotaxane Fig. 1 shows a scheme of a conventional crosslinked polyrotaxane molecule.<br>
The conventional crosslinked polyrotaxane 101 comprises a molecule of polyrotaxane 109, in which a linear molecule 105 is included in a CD molecule 103 in a skewered manner, and the<br><br>
linear molecule 105 has bulky capping groups 107a and 107b at both ends 105a and 105b to prevent the dissociation of the CD molecule 103.  The conventional crosslinked polyrotaxane 101 comprises at least two molecules of the polyrotaxane 109 ,.in which molecules of CD 103 are linked (bonded) each other through chemical bonding.  In the conventional crosslinked polyrotaxane 101, hydrogen bonding is formed between molecules of CD 103, and thereby molecules of CD 103 aggregate within the molecule of polyrotaxane 109 .  The aggregation occurs between different molecules of polyrotaxane via linked (bonded) CD molecules, resulting in an aggregation behavior of the whole crosslinked polyrotaxane 101.  The aggregation behavior is remarkably observed when an environment of the crosslinked polyrotaxane such as a solvent is a hydrophilic solvent such as water or saline . Fig. 2 shows a scheme of the crosslinked polyrotaxane 1 of the present invention.  Substitution of a part of hydroxyl groups 11 in a CD molecule 3 forming a molecule of polyrotaxane 9 with a non-ionic group 13 can suppress formation of hydrogen bonding between CD molecules 3, and can prevent aggregation of CD molecules within the same molecule of polyrotaxane 9 .  Further , the substitution can also prevent aggregation between CD molecules belonging to different polyrotaxane molecules, and thus can prevent an aggregation behavior of the whole crosslinked polyrotaxane.  Consequently, the crosslinked polyrotaxane according to the present invention can have a less-or non- reduced optical characteristics, or transparency, in a hydrophilic solvent such as water or saline, as a result of suppression of<br><br>
aggregation of CD molecules and/or aggregation of molecules of polyrotaxane.<br>
When linking polyrotaxane molecules, all of the polyrotaxane molecules may be substituted with the same non-ionic group.  Alternatively, a part of the polyrotaxane molecules may be substituted with a non-ionic group A, and the rest of them may be substituted with a non-ionic group B (B is different from A).  Moreover, different molecules of polyrotaxane substituted with different non-ionic groups may be physically linked.  Use of different molecules of polyrotaxane substituted with different non-ionic groups can control various characteristics of a crosslinked polyrotaxane and a material comprising the crosslinked polyrotaxane such as transmittance, elastic modulus, volume change including a swelling property and the like.<br>
In the crosslinked polyrotaxane according to the present invention, a non-ionic group with which a hydroxyl group in a CD molecule is substituted must be a group which prevents aggregation due to hydrogen bonding between CD molecules. Specifically , the non-ionic group may be preferably a -OR group . R may be preferably a linear or branched alkyl group having 1-12 carbons, a linear or branched alkyl group having 2-12 carbons and at least one ether group, a cycloalkyl group having 3-12 carbons, a cycloalkyl ether group having 2-12 carbons or a cycloalkyl thioether group having 2-12 carbons.  Examples of R may include, but are not limited to, linear alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl,<br><br>
nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl and the like; a branched alkyl groups such as isopropyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, 1-methylpropyl, isoamyl, neopentyl, 1,1-dimethylpropyl, 4-methylpentyl, 2-methylbutyl, 2-ethylhexyl and the like ; cycloalkyl groups such as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, cyclooctyl, adamantyl and the like; cycloalkyl ether groups such as ethylene oxide, oxetane, tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydropyrane, oxepane, dioxane, dioxolane and the like; cycloalkyl thioether groups such as thiirane, thietane, tetrahydrothiophene, thiane, dithiolane, dithiane and the like. Among them, R may be preferably methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl or hexyl, and more preferably methyl, ethyl or propyl.<br>
Also, the non-ionic group may be a -O-R'-X group. R' may be a group resulting from removal of one hydrogen in R group, and X may be preferably OH, NH2 or SH. R1 is defined independently of R. R1 may be preferably a group resulting from removal of one hydrogen in methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl or hexyl, andmore preferably a group resulting from removal of one hydrogen in methyl, ethyl or propyl. X may be OH or NH2, more preferably OH.<br>
Further, the non-ionic group may be a -O-CO-NH-R1 group, a -O-CO-R2 group, a -O-Si-R3 group or a -O-CO-O-R4 group.<br>
Ri, R2, R3 and R4may be , independently, a linear or branched alkyl group having 1-12 carbons , a linear or branched alkyl group having 2-12 carbons and at least one ether group, a cycloalkyl group having 3-12 carbons, a cycloalkyl ether group having 2-12 carbons or a cycloalkyl thioether group having 2-12 carbons.<br><br>
Substitution of the hydroxyl group with the non-ionic group may be 10 to 90%, preferably 20 to 80%, more preferably 30 to 70% of the total hydroxyl groups of the total CD molecules included in crosslinked polyrotaxane.  Within the range described above, prevention of hydrogen bonding between CD molecules can be achieved. Moreover, within the range described above, there are enough crosslinking points for crosslinking molecules of polyrotaxane each other via hydroxyl groups in CD molecules, and the resulting crosslinked polyrotaxane can have desirable dynamic characteristics.<br>
The crosslinked polyrotaxane or the material comprising the crosslinked polyrotaxane according to the present invention may be self-standing.  The term "self-standing" used herein refers to a property that the substance can keep its shape even when a certain load is applied thereto.  For example, paper, cloth and the like are also included in those having a "self-standing" property as defined herein.<br>
The material comprising the crosslinked polyrotaxane according to the present invention may comprise water other than the crosslinked polyrotaxane. A weight ratio of water to the crosslinkedpolyrotaxane (water : crosslinked polyrotaxane) may be 1: 99 to 99 . 9 : 0 . 1, preferably 5 : 95 to 99 . 9 : 0 . 1, more preferably 10:90 to 99.9:0.1.<br>
The crosslinked polyrotaxane or the material according to the present invention swells by absorbing water.  A concentration of the crosslinked polyrotaxane, or an amount of polyrotaxane per unit volume of the material upon or before<br><br>
swelling may be 0.001 to 0.99 g/cm3, preferably 0.001 to 0.95 g/cm3, andmore preferably 0 . 001 to 0 . 90 g/cm3 . Within the range , transmittance and elastic modulus described hereinafter can be provided.<br>
The crosslinked polyrotaxane or the material comprising the crosslinked polyrotaxane according to the present invention may have transmittance within the range described bellow. That is , a transmittance at 400 to 800 nm is 80 %/mmt or more , preferably 90 %/mmt or more, and more preferably 95 %/mmt or more. The term "mint" means that a thickness (t) of a sample at which a transmittance is measured is normalized to be 1 mm.<br>
Transmittance of the crosslinked polyrotaxane or the material according to the present invention can vary according to temperature.  A transmittance at 0 to 90°C may be 80 %/mmt or more , preferably 9 0 %/mmt or more , and more preferably 9 5 %/mmt or more at 400 to 800 nm.<br>
Transmittance of the crosslinked polyrotaxane or the material according to the present invention may vary reversibly according to temperature.  Change of transmittance according to temperature generally shows the following tendency:  The transmittance is low at high temperature and high at low temperature.<br>
The crosslinked polyrotaxane or the material according to the present invention may also vary its elastic modulus reversibly according to temperature, in addition to changes of its volume and its transmittance according to temperature.<br>
Specifically, the crosslinked polyrotaxane or the<br><br>
material according to the present invention may exhibit an elastic modulus at 80°C twice or more, preferably three times or more , more preferably five times or more , and most preferably ten times or more than that at 25°C.<br>
A CD molecule constructing the crosslinked polyrotaxane according to the present invention may be selected from the group consisting of α-CD, β-CD and γ-CD, and more preferably cc-CD.<br>
In the crosslinked polyrotaxane according to the present invention, the linear molecule may be selected from the group consisting of polyethylene glycol, polyisoprene, polyisobutylene, polybutadiene, polypropylene glycol, polytetrahydrofuran, polydimethylsiloxane, polyethylene and polypropylene, and preferably polyethylene glycol.<br>
A molecular weight of the linear molecule may be 10,000 or more, preferably 20,000 or more, more preferably 35,000 or more.  When the molecular weight is not within the range described above, especially less than the range, a sliding mode function in which a cyclodextrin molecule relatively shifts along the linear molecule cannot be sufficiently attained, and dynamic characteristics such as stretchability and breaking strength of the resulting crosslinked polyrotaxane tend to be insufficient.  The upper limit of the molecular weight of the linear molecule is not specifically limited.  A crosslinked polyrotaxane using a linear molecule having a molecular weight of at least 100,000 can be preferably used in the present invention.<br>
In the crosslinked polyrotaxane according to the present<br><br>
invention, a bulky capping group used may be selected from the group consisting of dinitrophenyl groups, cyclodextrins, adamantane groups, trityl groups, fluoresceins and pyrenes, preferably selected from adamantane groups or trityl groups.<br>
Other bulky capping groups may also be used.  Examples of the other bulky capping group may include substituted benzene such as cresol (example of the substituent may include, but are not limited to, alkyl, alkyloxy, hydroxy, halogen, cyano, sulf onyl, carboxyl, amino , phenyl and the like .  The substituent may be single or plural.); polycyclic aromatics, such as anthracene, which may be substituted (examples of the substituent include, but are not limited to, those described above .  The substituent may be single or plural. ) ; and steroids .<br>
A combination of a CD molecule and a linear molecule in the crosslinked polyrotaxane according to the present invention may be ct-CD as the CD molecule and polyethylene glycol as the linear molecule.<br>
In the crosslinked polyrotaxane according to the present invention , the linear molecule may have the CD molecules included in a skewered manner at an amount of 0.001 to 0.6, preferably 0 . 01 to 0 . 5 , and more preferably 0.05 to 0.4of a maximum inclusion amount, which is defined as an amount at which the cyclodextrin molecule can be included at maximum when the linear molecule has the cyclodextrin molecules included in a skewered manner, and the amount atmaximum is normalized to be 1. When an inclusion amount is too small, it tends to be difficult to link (bond) two or more molecules of polyrotaxane through chemical bonding.<br><br>
In this case, the resulting crosslinked polyrotaxane has low crosslinking density and thus tends to have insufficient dynamic characteristics. When an inclusion amount of CD molecules is too large, or CD molecules are closely packed along the linear molecule, a sliding mode function in which a CD molecule relatively shifts along the linear molecule cannot be sufficiently attained, and dynamic characteristics such as stretchability and breaking strength of the resulting crosslinked polyrotaxane tend to be insufficient.<br>
In the crosslinked polyrotaxane according to the present invention, it is preferable that at least two molecules of polyrotaxane are chemically bound to each other by a crosslinking agent. The crosslinking agent may have a molecular weight of less than 2,000, preferably less than 1,000, more preferably less than 600, and most preferably less than 400.<br>
The crosslinking agent is not specifically limited as long as it links at least two molecules of polyrotaxane, but preferably selected from the group consisting of cyanuric chloride, trimesoyl chloride, terephthaloyl chloride, epichlorohydrin, dibromobenzene, glutaraldehyde, phenylene diisocyanate, tolylene diisocyanate, divinyl sulfone, 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole and alkoxysilanes.  Cyanuric chloride, epichlorohydrin, divinyl sulfone, and 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole are especially preferable.<br>

The step of substituting a part of OH groups of each of the cyclodextrin molecules with a non-ionic group (s) may be set upon any one of A) to D) , or may be set at any two or more of A) to D).<br>
In the preparation method described above, as the CD molecules, the linear molecule, the capping group and the like to be used, those described above may be used.<br><br>
In the method described above, the step of substituting may be set after the step 2) of capping to prepare a polyrotaxane and before the step 3) of linking.<br>
Conditions used in the step of substituting, which depend on the non-ionic group, are not specifically limited, and various reaction methods and conditions may be employed.  For example, when using the -OR group described above, or producing an ether bond, the following methodmay be employed:  In general, a method of using an appropriate base as a catalyst together with a halide in a polar solvent such as dimethylsulfoxide and dimethylformamide is employed.  As the base, alkaline such as sodiummethoxide , sodium ethoxide , potassium t-butoxide , sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, cesium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate , silver oxide, barium hydroxide, barium oxide, sodium hydride and potassium hydride; or alkaline earth metal salts can be used.  There is also a method of introducing a leaving group such as p-toluenesulfonyl and methanesuIfonyl and then substituting with an appropriate alcohol.<br>
In addition to the method of introducing a -OR group as the non-ionic group by producing the ether bond, the following method may be employed: A method of producing a carbamate bond with an isocyanate compound or the like; a method of producing an ester bond with a carboxylate compound, an acid chloride, an acid anhydride or the like; a method of producing a silyl ether bond with a silane compound or the like; a method of producing a carbonate bond with a chlorocarboxylate compound;<br><br>
or the like.<br>
The present invention will be illustrated more specifically by way of the following Examples , but is not limited thereby.<br>
Example 1:<br><preparation of pseudopolyrotaxane><br>
Each of 3.0 g of a-cyclodextrin (abbreviated as a-CD) and 12 g of PEG (molecular weight: approximately 20,000) having an amino group at each end (abbreviated as PEG-BA) was dissolved in 40 ml of water at 80°C.  These solutions were mixed with stirring, and cooled at 5°C for 16 hours, to give a pseudopolyrotaxane.  Then, the mixture was freeze-dried to remove water. <preparation of polyrotaxane><br>
To the pseudopolyrotaxane prepared above was added a solution of 2.2 ml of diisopropylethylamine, 2.5 g of adamantaneacetic acid, 1.8 g of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole and 5.3 g of benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris-(dimethylamino)-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP reagent) in 88 ml of dry dimethylformamide (DMF), and reacted at 5°C under argon atmosphere.  After 24 hours, to the reaction mixture was added 50 ml of methanol, and then centrifuged.  The mixture was further subjected to washing and centrifugation with a mixed solvent of methanol: DMF = 50 ml: 50 ml twice and with 100 ml of methanol twice, and then dried in vacuum.  The resultant solid was dissolved in 50 ml of DMSO, and dropped into 500 ml of water<br><br>
to be precipitated, and then centrifuged.  The supernatant was<br>
removed.  The mixture was further washed with 200 ml of water<br>
and 200 ml of methanol, centrifuged, and then dried in vacuum,<br>
to give 4 . 5 g of polyrotaxane having an adamantane group at each<br>
end.<br><an amount of a-cd in polyrotaxane><br>
NMR measurement showed that approximately 58 molecules of a-CD are included in the above polyrotaxane, while the maximum inclusion amount of a-CD molecules at closest packing along the PEGused is found to be 230 from calculation. From the calculated value and the measured value of NMR, an amount of a-CD in the polyrotaxane prepared in the present Example was found to be 0.25 of the maximum inclusion amount. <oxymethylation of a-cd><br>
To a solution of 1.0 g of the polyrotaxane prepared above in 10 ml of dehydrated DMSO was added 1.7 g of sodium methoxide (28% in methanol) (corresponding to 12 equivalents relative to 18 equivalents of hydroxyl groups of an a-CD molecule in the polyrotaxane) . The resultant suspension was stirred for 5 hours with distilling methanol off under reduced pressure. To the resultant was added 1. 2 g of methyl iodide . The reaction mixture was stirred for 19 hours, and then diluted with purified water to 100 ml of volume. The mixture was dialyzed for 48 hours with a dialysis tube (fraction molecular weight: 12,000) in flowing tap water. The mixture was further dialyzed for 3 hours in 500 ml of purified water twice, and then freeze-dried, to give a methylated polyrotaxane in which a part of OH groups of an a-CD<br><br>
molecule is substituted with an OCH3 group. Yield was 0.97 g. 1H-NMR (DMSO-d6, 300 MHz) δ (ppm) 3.0-4.0 (m, 18H) , 4.43 (br, 1H) , 4.75 (br, m, 1H) , 4.97 (s, 1H) , 5.4-5.8 (br, 0.5H).<br>
In contrast to solubility of the starting polyrotaxane, which was soluble only in DMSO and insoluble in water, the methylated polyrotaxane obtained by chemical modification through a-CD was soluble in water, as well as DMSO, suggesting that formation of hydrogen bonding between a-CD molecules in the polyrotaxane is suppressed by the chemical modification. <crosslinking of methylated polyrotaxane><br>
450 mg of the methylated polyrotaxane prepared above was dissolved in 3 ml of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) .  To the mixture was added 36 mg of CD I, and reacted for 4 8 hours at 50°C, to give a crosslinked methylated polyrotaxane.  The crosslinked methylated polyrotaxane was placed in water to replace DMSO with water, to obtain a hydrogel.  The resultant hydrogel showed no volume shrinkage and no reduction of transparency. <evaluation of transparency crosslinked methylated polyrotaxane><br>
The crosslinked methylated polyrotaxane was measured for transmittance by sandwiching it between slide glasses and adjusting a thickness thereof to 2 mm.  The result is shown in Fig. 3 with a solid line.  Fig. 3 shows that the crosslinked methylated polyrotaxane has high transmittance in a visible ray region of 400 nm to 800 nm. (Comparative Example 1)<br>
In Comparative Example 1, a crosslinked polyrotaxane was<br><br>
prepared under the conditions similar to those of Example 1, by using an unmodified polyrotaxane being not subjected to. <oxymethylation of> in Example 1. When the crosslinked polyrotaxane prepared inDMSO similarly as in Example 1 was placed in water to replace DMSO with water , the crosslinkedpolyrotaxane shrank and turned from transparent into opaque.<br>
The opaque crosslinked polyrotaxane of Comparative Example 1 was measured for optical characteristics similarly as in Example 1.  The result is shown in Fig. 3 (Comparative Example 1: dashed line).  Fig. 3 shows that the opaque crosslinked polyrotaxane of Comparative Example 1 is inferior in transparency to the crosslinked polyrotaxane of Example 1.<br>
Example 2: <oxymethylation of><br>
1. 0 g of polyrotaxane similarly prepared as in Example 1 was dissolved in 20 ml of DMSO.  To the mixture was added 0.8 g of sodium methoxide (28% methanol solution).  An amount of the sodium methoxide corresponds to 6 equivalents relative to 18 equivalents of hydroxyl groups of an α-CD molecule in the polyrotaxane.  The mixture was stirred for 3 hours with distilling methanol off under reduced pressure.  To this was added methyl iodide in the same equivalent to sodium methoxide. The reaction mixture was stirred for 12 hours, and then diluted with purified water to 10 0 ml of volume .  The mixture was dialyzed for 48 hours with a dialysis tube (fraction molecular weight: 12,000) in flowing tap water.  The mixture was further dialyzed<br><br>
for 3 hours in 500 ml of purified water twice, and then freeze-dried to give a product.  Yield was 0.96 g. 2H-NMR (DMSO-d6, 300 MHz) δ (ppm) 3.0-4.0 (m, 21H) , 4.45 (br, 1.3H), 4.78 (br, m, 1.5H), 4.99 (s, 1H) , 5.4-5.8 (br, 1.1H). <crosslinking of methylated polyrotaxane><br>
200 mg of the methylated polyrotaxane prepared above was dissolved in 2 ml of 0 . 01N NaOH aqueous solution.  To the mixture was added 20 mg of divinyl sulfone, by allowing to gelate for 48 hours at 5°C, and placing in pure water to replace the solvent with water, to obtain a hydrogel.  The hydrogel showed no shrinkage and reduction of transparency after the replacement with water.  The hydrogel was measured for transmittance similarly as in Example 1, and found to have higher transmittance than that of Example 1.<br>
Example 3:<br><preparation of peg-carboxylic acid via tempo oxidation peg> 10 g of PEG (molecular weight: 35, 000) , 100 mg of TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-l-piperidinyloxy radical) and 1 g of sodium bromide were dissolved in 100 ml of water. To the mixture was added 5 ml of commercially available aqueous solution of sodium hypochlorite (effective chlorine concentration: approx. 5%) , and reacted with stirring at room temperature . Immediately after adding sodium hypochlorite, a pH of the reaction mixture was rapidly decreased with the progress of the reaction, and was adjusted by adding IN NaOH so that pH of the reaction mixture was preferably kept at 10 to 11.  Decrease of pH became scarcely<br><br>
observable within almost 3 minutes , and then the reaction mixture was stirred for 10 minutes.  The reaction was quenched by adding ethanol with an amount of up to 5 ml.  Ingredients other than inorganic salt were extracted with methylene chloride (50 ml) three times andmethylene chloride was removed with an evaporator The residue was dissolved in 250 ml of hot ethanol, and allowed to stand in a refrigerator at -4°C overnight to precipitate a PEG-carboxylic acid, in which each end of the PEG was substituted with carboxylic acid (-COOH) .  The precipitated PEG-carboxylic acid was collected by centrifugation.  The collected PEG-carboxylic acid was subjected to the procedure consisting of dissolving in hot ethanol, precipitating and centrifuging, for several times , and finally dried in vacuum, to give a purified PEG-carboxylic acid.  Yield was 95% or more.  A degree of carboxylation was 95% or more.<br><preparation of inclusion complex using peg-carboxylic acid and cc-cd><br>

0.13 g of adamantane amine was dissolved in 50 ml of dimethylformamide (DMF) .  To the mixture was added 14 g of the<br><br>
inclusion complex above, and immediately shaken well at room temperature. The mixture was then added to a solution of 0.38 g of BOP reagent<br>
(benzotriazol-1-yl-oxy-tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexaf luorophosphate) in 25 ml of DMF, and similarly shaken well. Further, the mixture was then added to a solution of 0.14 ml of diisopropylethylamine in 25 ml of DMF, and similarly shaken well.  The resultant mixture was allowed to stand in a refrigerator overnight.  Then, to the mixture was added 100 ml of mixture of DMF/methanol = 1:1, mixed well, and then centrifuged The supernatant was discarded.  The washing with the DMF/methanol mixture was repeated twice, followed by washing with 100 ml of methanol and centrifuging twice.  The resultant precipitate was dried in vacuum, dissolved in 50 ml of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), dropped into 700 ml of water, and thereby a polyrotaxane was precipitated.  The precipitated polyrotaxane was collected by centrifugation, and dried in vacuum or f reeze-dried.  The procedure consisting of dissolving in DMSO, precipitating in water, collecting and drying was repeated twice, and thereby a purified polyrotaxane was finally prepared.  Yield based on the inclusion complex added was approximately 68% (9 . 6 g was obtained from 14 g of the inclusion complex). <hydroxypropylation of><br>
3.0 g of the polyrotaxane prepared above was dissolved in 40 ml of IN NaOH aqueous solution. To the mixture was added 25 g, large excess amount, of propylene oxide.  The mixture was<br><br>
stirred for 24 hours at room temperature, and then neutralized<br>
with hydrochloric acid.  The solution was dialyzed for 48 hours<br>
with a dialysis tube (fraction molecular weight: 12,000) in<br>
flowing tap water.  The mixture was further dialyzed for 3 hours<br>
in 500 ml of purified water twice, and then freeze-dried to give<br>
a product.  Yield was 3.1 g.<br>

The hydroxypropylated polyrotaxane prepared above was used to prepare a crosslinked polyrotaxane under the conditions similar to those of Example 1.  The crosslinked hydroxypropylated polyrotaxane was placed in pure water to replace the solvent with water, to obtain a hydrogel.  The hydrogel showed no volume shrinkage and no reduction of transparency.  The hydrogel was measured for transmittance similarly as in Example 1, and found to have higher transmittance than that of Example 1, as shown in Fig. 5.<br>
Example 4: <oxymethylation of><br>
5.0 g of the polyrotaxane prepared in Example 3 was dissolved in 100 ml of dehydrated DMSO.  To the mixture was added 1.4 g of sodium hydride (corresponding to 14.4 equivalents relative to 18 equivalents of hydroxyl groups of an α-CD molecule in the polyrotaxane) .  The resultant suspension was stirred for 3 hours .  To the suspension was added 8 g of methyl iodide , stirred<br><br>
for 20 hours, and then diluted with purified water to 200 ml of volume. The diluted mixture was dialyzed for 48 hours with a dialysis tube (fraction molecular weight: 12,000) in flowing tap water. The mixture was further dialyzed for 3 hours in 500 ml of purified water twice, and then freeze-dried to give a methylated polyrotaxane in which a part of OH groups of an α-CD molecule is substituted with an OCH3 group. Yield was 4.3 g. 2H-NMR (CDC13, 300 MHz) δ (ppm) 3.0-4.2 (m, 9H) , 4.8-5.2 (m, 1H) . <crosslinking of methylated polyrotaxane><br>
400 mg of the methylated polyrotaxane prepared above was dissolved in 2 ml of 0 . IN NaOH aqueous solution. To the mixture was added 20 mg of divinyl sulfone. The mixture was allowed to gelate for 24 hours at 5°C, and placed in pure water to replace the solvent with water, to obtain a hydrogel.<br>
The resulting crosslinkedmethylatedpolyrotaxane showed no volume shrinkage and no reduction of transparency at room temperature, but turned into opaque and volumetrically shrank by heating to 60°C or more. Specifically, it was observed that the crosslinked methylated polyrotaxane has a 1/5 volume at 80°C of the volume at room temperature (25°C) . It was confirmed that once cooled from 80°C to room temperature, the crosslinked methylated polyrotaxane recovers its original state (state at room temperature) for both transmittance and volume, and that both changes in volume and transmittance are reversible. Transmittance of the crosslinked methylated polyrotaxane was found to be nearly equal to that of Example 1.<br>
Dynamic characteristics with regard to temperature of<br><br>
the crosslinked methylated polyrotaxane were also measured with a thermomechanical analyzer, TMA/SS6100 (shape of the measured sample: cylindrical, 5 mm diameter and 3.7 mm height).  Fig. 6 shows that an elastic modulus of the gel was 8 kPa at first, began to increase in the vicinity of 65°C, and reached to 100 kPa at 80°C.  It was also found that the change in elastic modulus was reversible with temperature. (Comparative Example 2)<br>
In Comparative Example 2 , a crosslinked polyrotaxane was prepared under the conditions similar to those of Example 3 by using an unmodified polyrotaxane being not subjected to <oxymethylation of> in Example 3.  100 mg of the above unmodif ied polyrotaxane was dissolved in 1 ml of 0 . 5N NaOH aqueous solution.  To the mixture was added 18 mg of divinyl sulfone, and allowed to gelate for 3 hours at 25°C.  When the crosslinked polyrotaxane was placed in pure water to replace the solvent with water, the crosslinked polyrotaxane shrank and turned from transparent into opaque.<br>
The opaque crosslinked polyrotaxane of Comparative Example 2 was measured for optical characteristic's similarly as in Example 1. The result is shown in Fig. 7.

To the resulting solution was added 25 ml of commercially available aqueous solution of sodium hypochlorite (effective chlorine concentration: approx. 5%) , and reacted with stirring at room temperature.  Immediately after adding sodium hypochlorite, a pH of the reaction mixture was rapidly decreased with the progress of the reaction, and was adjusted by adding IN NaOH so that pH of the reaction mixture was preferably kept at 10 to 11.  The reaction was quenched by adding 25 ml of methanol.  Ingredients other than inorganic salts were extracted with methylene chloride (400 ml) three times and methylene chloride was removed with an evaporator.  The residue was dissolved in 3000 ml of hot ethanol, and allowed to stand in a refrigerator at -4°C overnight to precipitate only a PEG-carboxylic acid.

Yield was 0.5 g.<br>
In contrast to solubility of the starting polyrotaxane, which was soluble only in DMSO and insoluble in water, the isopropylcarbamoylated polyrotaxane obtained by chemical modification through α-CD was soluble in weakly alkaline water, as well as DMSO, suggesting that formation of hydrogen bonding between α-CD molecules in the polyrotaxane is suppressed by the chemical modification.<br><br><crosslinking of isopropylcarbamoylated polyrotaxane><br>
50 mg of the isopropylcarbamoylated polyrotaxane prepared above was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.05N NaOH aqueous solution.  To the mixture was added 5 mg of divinyl sulfone, followed by allowing to gelate for 2 hours at room temperature, and placing in pure water to replace the solvent with water, to obtain a hydrogel.  The hydrogel turned into opaque and volumetrically shrank by heating at 50°C.  It was observed that by cooling again, the hydrogel recovered from an opaque state and expanded its volume.<br>
Example 10: <acetylation of><br>
0 . 5 g of polyrotaxane similarly prepared as in Example 5 was dissolved in 5 ml of a mixture of dehydrated DMSO: dehydrated pyridine = 1:1. To the mixture were added 0.2 g of acetic anhydride and 0.02 g of 4-dimethylaminopyridine. The reaction mixture was stirred for 20 hours , and then diluted with purified water to 30 ml of volume. The diluted mixture was dialyzed for 24 hours with a dialysis tube (fractionmolecular weight: 12,000) in flowing tap water. The mixture was further dialyzed for 24 hours in 5000 ml of purified water, and then freeze-dried to give an acetylated polyrotaxane in which a part of OH groups of an cc-CD molecule is substituted with an O-CO-CH3 group . Yield was 0.5 g.<br>
XH-NMR (DMSO-d6, 400 MHz) δ (ppm) 1.8-2.2 (m, 2. 1H) , 3.0-5.3 (m, 10H), 5.3-6.1 (m, 1H).<br><br>
In contrast to solubility of the starting polyrotaxane, which was soluble only in DMSO and insoluble in water, the acetylated polyrotaxane obtained by chemical modification through a-CD was soluble in water at 10°C or lower, as well as DMSO, suggesting that formation of hydrogen bonding between a-CD molecules in the polyrotaxane is suppressed by the chemical modification. <crosslinking of acetylated polyrotaxane><br>
50 mg of the acetylated polyrotaxane prepared above was dissolved in 0 . 5 ml of dehydrated DMSO. To the mixture was added 7 mg of CDI. The mixture was allowed to gelate for 4 hours at 50°C, and placed in pure water to replace the solvent with water, to obtain a hydrogel. Shrinkage of the hydrogel was observed after the replacement with water. The gel turned into opaque and volumetrically shrank by heating at 50°C. It was observed that by cooling again, the hydrogel recovered from an opaque state and expanded its volume.<br>
