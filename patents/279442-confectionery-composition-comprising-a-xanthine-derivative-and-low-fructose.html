				<td>CONFECTIONERY COMPOSITION COMPRISING A XANTHINE DERIVATIVE AND LOW FRUCTOSE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a stable candy base comprising a sugar base, a xanthine derivative and an edible organic acid. This candy base is characterized by having a low fructose level, which improves stability, reduces moisture absorption and maintains the flavour profile.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
To appeal to consumers' tastes, confectionery compositions comprising a candy base need to be stable over time. The visual appearance as well as the mouth-feel and taste of the candy base need to vary as little as possible from the time the confectionery is manufactured and packaged to the moment it is consumed. Variations in visual appearance, mouth-feel and taste among confectionaries within the same package also need to be minimized.<br>
Flavours and other ingredients are generally added during the manufacture of the candy base to provide specific benefits. It is generally known in the art mat edible organic acids may function as flavour enhancers; when provided at optimal levels edible organic acids may significantly improve the release of flavours from the confectionery composition. Furthermore, they may stimulate salivation. However, me addition of edible organic acids to confectionery compositions may alter the stability of the candy base and/or the perception of flavours over time. This is detrimental to the visual appearance and the taste of the candy base. According to US 2004/0126472, acidic components may provoke the hydrolysis of the sugar alcohols resulting in a sticky and hygroscopic candy. US 2004/0126472 discloses a method of manufacture of a stable candy comprising at least one acidic component and at least one sugar alcohol. Sugar alcohols provide sweetness as they mimic sugars but are not metabolized as sugars, provide fewer calories and thus less energy.<br>
One major problem in the manufacture of a sugar base comprising an edible organic acid relies in the changes mat the sugar base candy may have undergone after manufacture so mat me candy does not closely resemble the product originally designed and produced. These changes may include moisture absorption, which may render the sugar base candy soft and sticky. Softness and stickiness may cause several drawbacks, for example an appealing shape of a<br>
 <br>
confectionery may be disrupted during storage due to the increased softness of the candy base and the weight of the overlying candies within the same package. Loss of shape is not the sole disadvantage. Increased moisture content may also induce stickiness in the candy base, causing it to stick to its own wrapper, to the other candies within the same package and/or to the package itself. Although this problem may be resolved by using low water vapor diffusion packages to prevent the moisture entering, the high costs associated therewith make these packages commercially unappealing.<br>
Softness and stickiness may also be more noticeable when the candy base constitutes the shell or the outer case of a centre-filled candy which may comprise a solid or liquid core. Loss of shape in liquid core centre-filled candies may lead to the release of the liquid core out from the candy base shell into the package. WO2006/091447 circumvents this problem by providing a centre-filled confectionery comprising a shear thinning centre-filled composition having rheological attributes that improve the stability of the confectionery. Nevertheless, being restrained to certain rheological attributes of the liquid centre-fill represents a limitation for manufacturers. Furthermore, liquid centre-filled candies have high consumer appeal and may represent a useful platform to deliver special ingredients.<br>
Ingredients such as xanthine and its methylated derivatives have recently received renewed interest because of the neurostimulating effects associated with their use. However, xanthine derivatives, in particular caffeine, seem to enhance moisture absorption and to alter, distort or mask the taste of other flavours within the sugar based candy.<br>
Thus, a need exists for a stable sugar base candy comprising xanthine derivatives and edible organic acids.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a confectionery composition comprising a candy base, said candy base comprising:<br>
i.	one or more sugar bases;<br>
ii.        at least one edible organic acid;<br>
iii.       greater than 0% and less than 1.90% of fructose by weight of said candy base and<br>
iv.       one or more xanthine derivatives. The present invention further relates to a method of continuous manufacture of said candy base and a package for comprising at least one of said confectionery composition.<br>
 <br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Unless otherwise stated herein, all percentages are weight percentages. The present invention provides a confectionery composition comprising a candy base, said candy base comprising one or more sugar bases, at least one edible organic acid, one or more xanthine derivatives and less than about 1.9% of fructose by weight of said candy base. This confectionery composition is characterized by having improved stability, less moisture absorption, being capable of maintaining the original shape during storage and not being sticky.<br>
1. CANDY BASE<br>
The confectionery composition according to the present invention comprises a candy base. The candy base comprises one or more sugar bases. Sugar bases useful in the present invention include mono-, di- and trisaccharides, oligosaccharides or derivatives thereof. Non-limiting examples include glucose, lactose, maltose, xylose, sucrose and fructooligosaccharides. Preferred sugar bases according to the present invention comprise glucose syrup, sucrose or mixture thereof, preferably a mixture thereof. The candy base according to the present invention comprises from about 10% to about 99% of sugar bases, preferably from 15% to 95%, more preferably from 15% to 90% by weight of the candy base. Preferred embodiments according to the invention comprise from about 30% to about 85% glucose syrup by weight of the sugar base and from about 15% to about 70% sucrose by weight of the sugar base.<br>
The confectionery composition according to the invention comprises at least one edible organic acid or salts thereof. Examples of suitable edible organic acids within the scope of the present invention are saturated and unsaturated hydroxy and non-hydroxy C1 to C6 mono-, di-, and tribasic carboxylic acids such as citric acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, adipic acid, succinic acid, ascorbic acid, glutaric acid, acetic and hydroxyacetic acid, glucono delta lactone, phosphoric acid or mixtures thereof, preferably citric acid, malic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, adipic acid, ascorbic acid or mixture mereof. Examples of salts which may be used as a source of acid are alkali and alkaline earth metal salts of the edible organic acids listed above, such as monobasic calcium phosphate, monobasic sodium phosphate, sodium hydrogen sulfite and sodium pyrophosphate.<br>
 <br>
The present inventors have surprisingly found that fructose levels in a candy base below about 1.90% by weight of the candy base render the candy base stable during its shelf life. Preferably, the candy base according to the present invention comprises less than about 1.5% by weight of fructose, more preferably less than about 1.0%, even more preferably less than about 0.75% of fructose by weight of the candy base. Preferably, the fructose level is greater than 0% by weight of said candy base. Without wishing to be bound by theory, fructose as used herein and in the presence of at least one edible organic acid and one or more xanthine derivatives, may improve the stability of a confectionery by reducing the hygroscopicity of the overall composition.<br>
The candy of the present invention comprises one or more xanthine derivatives. Xanmine and its methylated derivatives are useful ingredients due to their stimulating effect. Xanthine derivatives useful in the present invention include those that conform to formula (I):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where R1, R2 and R3 are independently selected from H or methyl and mixtures thereof. Preferred xanthine derivatives include: Xanthine, where R1, R2 and R3 in formula (I) are all H; Caffeine, where R1, R2 and R3 are all methyl; Theobromine, where R1 is H and R2 and R3 are bom methyl; Theophylline, where R1 and R2 are both methyl and R3 is H. More preferably the xanthine derivative comprises caffeine.<br>
The candy base according to the present invention may preferably comprise from about 0.01% to about 5% xanthine derivative by weight of said candy base. Preferably, said candy base<br>
 <br>
comprises from about 0.05% to about 2.5% xanthine derivative, more preferably from about 0.1% to about 1% xanthine derivative. Preferably the confectionery composition comprises sufficient xanthine derivative to deliver from about 1 mg to about 150 mg of xanthine derivative per individual confectionery unit, more preferably from about 5 mg to about 100mg, even more preferably from about 10 mg to about 50 mg xanthine derivative per individual confectionery unit. More preferably said candy base comprises from about 22.5 to about 27.5 mg of caffeine per individual confectionery unit.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, xanthine derivatives, in particular caffeine, in the presence of an edible organic acid may possibly form xanthine derivative organic salts. Caffeine in the presence of citric acid, for example, may form caffeine citrate. These xanthine derivative organic salts are believed to have a speed of dissociation in water faster than that of the xanthine derivatives themselves. Xanthine derivative organic salts within the candy base may reduce stability of said candy base during manufacture and storage. The candy base may turn soft, crack and it may become opaque, sticky and assume a glue-like consistency over time. These changes may not only affect the visual appearance of the candy base but they may likewise alter the organoleptic properties of the candy base. Without wishing to be bound by theory, fructose within the candy base may induce water vapor absorption during storage of said candy base. The confectionery may be stored for months and therefore, as the moisture content of said candy base increases, the interaction of xanthine salts with other ingredients within the candy base may increase too. It has been surprisingly found that a candy base comprising sugar bases, edible organic acids, xanthine derivatives and levels of fructose below about 1.9% by weight of said candy base, may improve the stability of the candy base by at least in part reducing moisture absorption and by at least maintaining the physical stability, taste and flavour profile.<br>

When the confectionery composition of the present invention is a liquid centre-filled candy, said centre-filled candy preferably comprises a cooling agent, a warming agent or mixtures thereof. More preferably said cooling agent and warming agent are located in distinct and discrete regions within the centre-filled candy. Even more preferably said candy base comprises a cooling agent and said centre-fill comprises a warming agent. Cooling and warming<br>
 <br>
agents act to reduce the perception of the xanthine derivatives, in particular the bitterness of caffeine by not only masking the bitterness, but further by reducing the consumers ability to actually detect the caffeine. By physically separating the peak effects of cooling agent and warming agent, however, the overall organoleptic effect of the product is substantially improved.<br>
Cooling agents suitable within the scope of the present invention are described in W097/06695. Preferred for use herein are physiological cooling agents selected from the group consisting of menthol, peppermint oil, N-substituted-p-menthane-3-carboxamides, acyclic tertiary and secondary carboxamides, 3-1-menthoxy propan-l,2-diol, monomenthyl glutarate and mixtures thereof. The carboxamides found most useful are those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,136,163, Jan. 23, 1979 to Watson et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 4,230, 688, Oct. 28, 1980 to Rowsell et al. The carboxamides in U.S. Pat. No. 4,136,163 are N-substituted-p-menthane-3-carboxamides, such as N-ethyl-p-menthane-3-carboxamide, commercially available as WS-3 from Wilkinson Sword. The carboxamides of U.S. Pat. No. 4,230,688 are certain acyclic tertiary and secondary carboxamides, such as trimethyl isopropyl butanamide, commercially available as WS-23 from Wilkinson Sword. More preferred for use herein are monomenthyl glutarate, N-ethyl-p-menthane-3-carboxamide, trimethyl isopropyl butanamide and mixtures thereof, more preferably still monomenthyl glutarate, commercially available as Cooler-2 from IFF (Netherlands).

The balance of the cooling composition may be made up of a suitable appropriate carrier, such as water, propylene glycol or a bulk sweetener, described in more detail below. The cooling composition can further comprise a warming agent as described herein provided that the predominant effect is one of cooling.<br>
Warming agents suitable within the scope of the present invention comprise vanillyl alcohol n-butyl ether, vanillyl alcohol n-propyl ether, vanillyl alcohol isopropyl ether, vanillyl alcohol isobutyl ether, vanillyl alcohol n-amino ether, vanillyl alcohol isoamyl ether, vanillyl alcohol n-hexyl ether, vanillyl alcohol methyl ether, vanillyl alcohol ethyl ether, gingerol, shogaol, paradol, zingerone, capsaicin, dihydrocapsaicin, nordihydrocapsaicin, homocapsaicin, homodihydrocapsaicin, ethanol, iso-propyl alcohol, iso-amylalcohol, benzyl alcohol, chloroform,<br>
 <br>
eugenol, cinnamon oil, cinnamic aldehyde, phosphate derivatives thereof, or mixtures thereof. The phosphate derivatives mentioned are those described in WO 97/02273. A commercial example of a suitable warming agent for use herein is Optaheat (Symrise, Germany). The balance of the warming composition may be made up of a suitable appropriate carrier, such as water, propylene glycol or a bulk sweetener, described in more detail below. The warming composition can further comprise a cooling agent as described herein provided that the predominant effect is one of warming.<br>
Suitable levels of the warming agent are from about 0.001 to about 10%, preferably from about 0.005 to about 5%, more preferably from about 0.01 to about 1%, more preferably still from about 0.01% to about 0.5% by weight of said centre-filled candy.<br>
The confectionery composition according to the present invention may further comprise a flavouring agent. As used herein, the term "flavouring agenf means those flavour essences and equivalent synthetic ingredients which are added to the flavour composition for the principal purpose of providing flavour to the confectionery product. It excludes warming and cooling agents as described above. Flavouring agents well known in the confectionery art can be added to (he flavour compositions of the invention. These flavouring agents can be chosen from synthetic flavouring liquid and/or oils derived from plants leaves, flowers, fruits and so forth, and combinations thereof. Representative flavouring liquids include: artificial, natural or synthetic fruit flavours such as lemon, orange, banana, grape, lime, apricot and grapefruit oils and fruit essences including apple, strawberry, cherry, orange, pineapple and so forth; bean and nut derived flavours such as coffee, cocoa, cola, peanut, almond and so forth; and root derive flavours such as licorice or ginger. The amount of flavouring agent employed is normally a matter of preference subject to such factors as flavour type, base type and strength desired. In general, amounts up to about 4% by weight of the confectionery composition are usable with amounts of from about 0.1% to about 1% by weight of the composition being preferred.<br>
3. METHOD OF MANUFACTURE<br>
The present invention further relates to a method of continuous manufacture of a confectionery comprising a candy base. The method comprises the steps of forming a liquid starting material comprising one or more sugar bases and water; removing at least part of the<br>
 <br>
water from said liquid starting material to form a candy base; forming a substantially flat sheet of said candy base on a rolling belt in a continuous manner; said substantially flat sheet of said candy base comprising a front and a rear surface, said rear surface being in contact with said rolling belt; adding to the front surface of said substantially flat sheet of candy base one or more edible organic acids. Said substantially flat sheet of candy base is then folded and rolled in a continuous manner and it is formed into a rope and finally screw extruded. The confectionery manufactured according to this method is preferably a centre-filled confectionery.<br>
By "substantially" flat sheet of candy mass is meant a sheet which has at least 80%, preferably 90%, more preferably 99% uniform thickness, said thickness being measured as me distance between said front and rear surface. The term "flat" as used herein is synonym for "horizontal", "even", "plane" and "planar".<br>
One or more substantially flat sheet of candy mass can be formed over the same rolling belt. The diickness of said substantially flat sheet of candy mass is from about 2 mm to about 25 mm, preferably from about 5 mm to about 20 mm.<br>
The edible organic acids may be added in a variety of ways. The edible organic acids may be sprayed over at least a portion of said substantially flat sheet of candy mass. Alternatively me edible organic acids may be dripped, sprinkled, drizzled, foamed, scattered, spurted, shot or showered over at least a part of the sheet. Any of these methods may also be combined in me same continuous line of manufacture. The preferred method may depend on whether the edible organic acids are in a powder, encapsulate, liquid or intermediate form, such as paste and/or cream. The edible organic acids may be added continuously or at intervals, one or more edible organic acids may be added on the front surface of said sheet, while one or more edible organic acids may be added on the rear surface.<br>
4. PACKAGE<br>
The confectionery compositions according to the present invention comprise a candy base of improved stability. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that by having fructose levels of less than about 1.90%, the candy base is more stable and less sticky due to reduced hygroscopicity than a candy base having fructose in higher level.<br>
As the confectionery herein have improved stability and resistance to moisture absorption during  storage,   a  further  embodiment  of the  present  invention  comprises   a  packaged<br>
 <br>
confectionery composition containing at least one confectionery composition comprising a candy base, said candy base comprising one or more sugar bases, at least one edible organic acid and less than 1.90% of fructose by weight of said candy base, and a package for containing said confectionery composition. Said packaged confectionery composition may be stored in a number of environmental conditions.<br>
The package containing said confectionery composition according to the present invention can be defined by the Water Vapor Transmission Rate (WVTR) as measured by the "Standard Test Method for Water Vapor Transmission Rate Through Plastic Film and Sheeting Using a Modulated Infrared Sensor", ASTM-F1249. This test method covers a procedure for determining the rate of water vapor transmission through flexible barrier materials. Briefly, the method comprises a dry chamber, which is separated from a wet chamber of known temperature and humidity by the film material to be tested. The dry chamber and the wet chamber make up a diffusion cell in which the test film is sealed. The diffusion cell is placed in a test station where the dry chamber and the top of the film are swept with dry air. Water vapour diffusing through the film mixes with the air and is carried into a pressure-modulated infrared sensor. This sensor measures the fraction of infrared energy absorbed by the water vapour and produces an electrical signal, the amplitude of which is proportional to the water vapou concentration. This signal is then compared with the electrical signals produced by calibrations films of known transmission rate. The transmission rate of the test film is finally calculated based on that of the reference films. The method is applicable to sheets and films up to 3 mm in thickness, consisting of single or multilayer of synthetic or natural polymers and foils, including coated materials. This method provides the time rate of water vapour flow (WVTR) normal to the surface, under steady-state conditions, per unit-area. An accepted unit of WVTR is g m "2 per 24 hours. The test conditions which must be indicated are the temperature and the relative humidity, the latter being the difference in relative humidity across the specimens. The package according to present invention preferably has a water vapor transmission rate of from about 6.0 g m -2 per 24 hours to about 0.005 g m ~2 per 24 hours, measured at 38°C / 90% relative humidity. Preferably, the package has a water vapor transmission rate of from about 0.9 g m -2 per 24 hours to about 0.005 g m "2 per 24 hours, more preferably from about 0.85 g m -2 per 24 hours to about 0.075 g m "2 per 24 hours.<br>
 <br>
Suitable packages for use within the scope of the present invention are packages comprising one, two or three layers of material.

5. EXAMPLES 5.1 Centre-filled confectionery Centre-fill composition:<br>
 <br>
Manufacturing instructions:<br>
The glycerin is weighed at room temperature into a suitable vessel. Anthocyanins, taurine and guarana powders are added and mix until dispersed. Subsequently, xanthan gum is added and mixed until dispersed. The glucose syrup is the pre-heated at 40°C and added to the batch, which is then mixed and heated up to 80°C. After stopping heating, sucrose and citric acid are added and mixed until dissolved. Finally, flavours and heating agent are added and mixed for 10 minutes.<br>
Suitable vessels for making the center-fill compositions should be made of stainless steel or other food grade acceptable material which can easily be heated and cooled. Ideally the mixing vessels should have scraped wall mixers as well as a medium/high shear mixer. Suitable high shear mixers include static in-line mixers, jet mixers such as those manufactured by Dca GmbH, or rotor stator mixers such as those manufactured by Silverson Inc. Care must be taken when using high shear mixers that the pseudoplastic polymers are not broken into lower molecular weight components.<br>

Manufacturing instructions:<br>
A pre-solution of caffeine is prepared by mixing 5% anhydrous caffeine powder with water at 50°C to make a clear solution.<br>
Sucrose, glucose liquid, water and the caffeine solution are weighed and premixed until homogeneous. The mixture is pre-cooked at 110°C and filtered for impurities. The dissolved glucose/sucrose/caffeine solution is filtered for impurities and pumped into the main cooker. The mixture is cooked at around 145°C and dispensed into an expansion chamber for evaporation. This liquid starting material is the fed into a vacuum chamber at -0.92 bar minimum to remove further water, the resulting candy mass should be less than 3% water. The liquid candy mass at 145°C is subsequently fed into an in-line high shear mixer where flavours and optional liquid ingredients can be injected using metered dosing pumps.<br>
The candy mass is subsequently dispensed onto a moving stainless steel belt to for a substantially flat sheet at a controlled temperature, a thin film of wax is used to ensure good separation of the mass from the cooling belt. As the sheet of candy mass is carried forward by the belt it is spread evenly by a fixed PTFE roller to ensure good temperature distribution. Anhydrous citric acid is deposited onto the front surface of the sheet of candy mass using a calibrated augur. The sheet of candy mass is subsequently folded onto itself from either side using PTFE ploughs so that the outer edges now fold over and trap the deposited citric acid. This folding action is repeated once more before the candy mass exits at from about 80°C to about 90°C.<br>
The candy mass is transferred through a vertical batch roller, also known as rope former, into a twin screw extruder preheated to 85°C. The twin screw extruder allows the simultaneous<br>
extrusion of the candy mass and liquid center-fill into a continuous rope. The rope is fed into punching equipment to form drops. Talc is used to prevent the candy mass and/or drops from sticking to the forming equipment. The drops are cooled down on a cooling belt passing the cooling tunnel to obtain their final consistency for sorting and packing.<br>
The percentage of fructose by weight of the confectionery on a dry matter basis is about 0.7%.<br>

The candy mass is transferred to horizontal batch roller, also known as rope former, to temper the candy mass and is pulled into a continuous rope. The rope is sized and fed into punching equipment to form drops. Talc is used to prevent the candy mass and/or drops from sticking to the forming equipment. The drops are cooled down on a cooling belt passing the cooling tunnel to obtain their final consistency for sorting and packing.
