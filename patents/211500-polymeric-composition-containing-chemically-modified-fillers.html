DESCRIPTION. QV THE INVENTION<br>
The presexit invention relates to chemically treated fillers and the use of such fillers in polymeric compositions, More particularly, this invention relates to pafticulate~br amorphous fillers having minimum carbon and mercapto contents, a minimum Silane Conversion Index, a minimum Standard Reinforcement Index arid polymers, e.g*, curable rubber compositions, containing such fillers. Most particularly, this invention relates to a hydrophobiaed and functional!zed filler, hereinafter referred to as a modified filler"", that improves the efficiency of producing polymeric compositions,• such as in rubber compounding  and the performance of polymerized or cured products, e.g.,- tires."<br>
In the production of polymeric compositions, it is common to incorporate reinforcing fillers to improve the physical properties of the polymer. The surfaces of such fillers are often modified to increase the reactivity and consequently she two and three dimensional coupling cf the filler within the polymeric composition,  It is  conventional in the .rubber industry to incorporate carbon black and other reinforcing fillers into natural and synthetic rubber to increase the physical properties of the cured rubber vulcanizate.  Fillers Used to reinforce such polymeric compositions include natural and synthetic fillers.<br>
One of. the principal non-black, fillers used in the rubber industry is air s-phous precipitated silica.  This<br>
2<br><br>
siliceous filler is used to impart improved tensile strength,<br>
tear resistance-and abrasion resistance to the .rubber<br>
vuLcaniaate. Silica fillers are- also used in combination, with<br>
carbon blacks to :obcain .maximum mileage in passenger vehicle<br>
tires and off-the-road tires, e.g., tires for mining and<br>
logging operations and for road-building equipment.  Such<br>
applications have become well established, when used as the<br>
sole reinforcing filler, silica fillers that are not well<br>
dispersed and/or coupled in the rubber do not provide the<br>
overall improved performance obtained by the use. of carbon<br>
blacks alone. This is observed most readily in rubber.<br>
vulcanizates used for tires, e.g., tire treads.<br>
various coupling agents, e.g., titanates,<br>
zirconates and silanes, have been suggested for use with<br>
fillers when such fillers are incorporated into polymeric<br>
"compositions., e.g., rubber, in order to improve the ,<br>
performance of the rubber vulcanizate. Among the various<br>
organosilane coupling agents suggested for such use are the<br>
mercaptoalkyltcialkQxysilantss, e.g.,<br>
mercstptopropyltrifitethoxysilane.  It has been reported that the<br>
use of appropriate amounts of such coupling agents,<br>
particularly mercaptapropyltrimethoxysilane," in siliceous<br>
filler-reinforced synthetic rubbers provides at least<br>
equivalent performance to carbon black-reinforced.synthetic<br>
rubbers in several key physical properties such as 3 00^<br>
modulus, tensile strength, abrasion resistance, and heat<br>
build-up.<br>
The high cost of mercaptoalkyltrialkoxysilanes, the■	i .<br>
irritating odors associated with the neat materials and the<br>
time and energy required to mix them into rubber compoaitions<br>
have deterred the more general use of siliceous fillers as the<br>
principal reinforcing filler in large volume rubber<br>
applications,  O.S, Patent  describes increasing the<br><br><br><br>
                                  2<br><br>
.efficiency of silane coupling agente, particularly mercaptosilane coupling agents, by using an alkoxysilane in combination with the silane to form a coupling composition. In one specific embodiment described in the "647 patent, the silane coupling composition is formulated with the siliceous" filler in A  suitable non-reactive liquid that is chemically inert with respect to the coupling composition and siliceous filler to prepare a rubber compounding additive i,e,, a silica-eilans concentrate.<br>
U.S. patent S, 116,336 describes? a two  step process in which the surface of natural or synthetic, oxide or silicate fillers is modified by using certain organosilieon compounds. In the first step, the organosilieon compound is mixed intensely with the filler at a temperature below 6 0°C. In the second step, the homogenous mixture is subjected to a temperaturs of from SO to 160C to complete the surface modification or, the filler,<br>
U.S. patent 5,909,660 also describes-a two-step method for the preparation of hydrophobic silica.  In the first step, an aqueous suspension of precipitated silica is contacted with an organosilieon compound in the presence of a catalytic amount of an acid to effect hydrophobing of the precipitated silica,  In the second step, the aqueous suspension of the hydrophobic precipitated silica-is contacted with a water-imiscible organic solvent at a.solvent to silica weight ratio greater than 5:i to effect separation of the hydrophobic precipitated silica from the aqueous phase,<br>
It has now been discovered that an improved modified filler, e.g., a particulate or amorphous inorganic    oxide, that is characterized by a carbon content of greater than 1 weight percent, a mercapto content of greater than 0.15 weight percent, a Silane Conversion Index (described hexeh) of at leaat 0.3, and a. Standard Reinforcement<br>
4<br><br>
Index (also described hereinafter) o£ 4 or more oan be prepared.  Th» process described in U.S. Patent 5,900,660 may bo-improved mid uacd to produce the niodiJClo.d fillcsr of tho present invention by utilising a certain combination of functionalizing and hydrophobizing agents in an aqueous suspension of inorganic oxide having a pH of 2,5 or le3S and treating the acidic aqueous suspension ot" modified fillers with acid neutralizing1 agents to increase the pH of the suspension to a rajige of from 3.0 to 10.<br>
As used herein, 3 functionalizing agent is a reactive chemical which can cause an. inorganic oxide to be<br>
-I<br>
covalently bonded to t.h.3 polymeric composition in which it is used, A hydrophobizing agent is a chemical which can bind to and/or be associated with an inorganic oxide to the extent that, it causes a reduction in the affinity for water of: the inorganic oxide while increasing the inorganic oxide"a affinity for the organic polymsric composition in which it is used.<br>
The aforementioned st.an.dard Reinforcement Index (SRI) of at least 4 ox* greater indicates a. modification of the interaction or bonding between the components of the filler-polymer composition, specifically, th.re is a stronger interaction between the, filler and polymer and/or the polymer and polymar than usually present for a given amount: of interaction between filler and filler, Alternatively stated, there is a weaker interaction between the filler and filler than usually present for a given amount of interaction between . filler and-polymer and/or polymer and polymer.  Appropriate modifications of these interactions in a rubber composition have been reported"to result in better tire performance, e.g., improved treadwear life, lower rolling resistance, better traction on snow and lower noise generation.  In addition to the improved propertie,,  0.3 modified filler has the benefit<br>

■    *   ■   ■<br><br>
of requiring less citne and energy to get incorporated into the polymeric composition,<br>
PET AILED. DBSCRIPICIOW OF. JM. JiMMHSU Other than in the operating examples, or where otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities, ratios, ranges, etc, used, herein are to be understood as modified in all instances by the term  about".<br>
The modified filler of the present invention may bs produced by any method that results in such a filler, i.e., an inorganic oxide, having a carbon content of greater than~"l weight percent, preferably, at least 1.5 weight, percent, and, more preferably; at.least 2.0 weight percent; a mercapto content of greater than 0, IS weight percent, preferably, at least 0.3 weight percent, and more preferably, at least 0.5 weight percent; a Silane Conversion Index, of at lsa,st 0.3, preferably, at least 0.4, and most preferably, at least 0.5 and a Standard Reinforcement Index of at least 4.6, preferably, at least 4.5 and more preferably at least 5.0. The modified filler of the present invention may also be characterized by a Tensile stress at 300% elongation of at least 6.2, preferably at least 7.0, more preferably, at lease 7.5 and most pxeffirably at least 3.0. The modified filler of the present invention may further be characterized by a Brunauer Emmett-Teller (BET) single point surface area of from 20 to 330 mVg, preferably from 40 to 300 and most preferably of from 100 to 200 m2/g, a pH of from 5 to 10, preferably from S.5 to 3.5,"mora preferably from 5;0 to 9,0 and most preferably, a pH of from 6.5 to- 7,5 or the pH of the product may range between any combination of these values, inclusive of the recited ranges; and a soxhlet Bxtractsble percent carbon of less then 30 percent, preferably less than ?" percent stnd more preferably less than 20 percent, e.g., IF;<br>
6<br><br>
percent:. The methods for determining the aforestated characteristics o£ the modified filler are described in •Example IS.<br>
The"filler used to prepare the modified filler of the present invention, is en inorganic oxide defined herein as<br>
possesses either oxygen (chemieorbed or covalently bonded) or .hydroxy! (bound or free) at its exposed surface,  In addition, the inorganic oxide is a material which is suitable for vise in the various molding, compounding or coating processes including injection molding, lamination, transfer molding, compression molding, rubber compounding, coating (such as dipping, brushing, knife coating, roller coating, silk .screen coating, printing,, spray coating and the like), casting, and the like.<br>
The inorganic oxide or mixture of 2  or more inorganic oxides used to produce the modified filler of the present invention may be natural or synthetic Such fillers   include oxides of che metals in.Periods a, 3, 4, 5 and S  of Groups lb, lib, Ilia, Hlb, IVa, IVb (except carbon), Va, via, Vila and vin of the Periodic. Table of the Elements in   Advanced inorganic Chemistry.;,, h  Comprehensive Text by F. Albert Cotton ec al, Fourth Edition, John Wiley and Sons, 19BQ. Among the natural silicates, kaoiines or clays ara     especially suitable.  However, ■ kieselgohr or diatomaceous earths can also be used. Aluminum oxide, aluminum hydroxide  or aluminum trihydrate and titanium dioxid*, which can be obtained from natural deposits, can be named by way of example as fillers. Especially suitable synthetic fillers are       aluminosilicates, silicates, pyrogenic, colloidal and precipitated silicas.<br>
The term  aluminoeilicates" can be described as natural or syr, he   materials .where the silicon atoms of a.<br>
7<br><br>
silicon dioxide are partially replaced, or substituted, either naturally or synthetically, by aluminum atoms.  For example, S to 90, alternatively 10 to 80 percent of silicon atoms of a silicon dioxide might be replaced, or substituted, naturally or synthetically, by aluminum atoms to yield a.n altnninosilicate.  A suitable process tor such preparation might be described, for example, as by a coprecipitation by. pH adjustment of,  a, basic solution, or mixture, of silicate and aluminate alno, for example, by a chemical reaction between sio2 or silanols on the surfa.ee of a silicon dioxide, and NaAlOj. For example, in such a coprecipitation process, the synthetic coprec-ipitated aluminosilicate may have 5 to 95 of its surface composed of silica moieties and, correspondingly, 95 to  5 percent of its surface composed of aluminum moieties.<br>
Examples of natural aluminoeilic&amp;tes include Muscovite, Beryl, Dichroite, sepiolice and Kaoiinire, Examples of synthetic aluminosilicates include Zeolite and those which might be represented by formulas such as, for example, [  (K26)I J ; [ (AljOj)r(SiO,).yYO] ; whesrein Y is magnesium or calcium.<br>
Preferably, the inorganic oxide used to produce the •modified filler of the present invention is aluminosilicate, colloidal silica, precipitated silica or mixtures thereof and most preferably it is a precipitated silica of the type commonly employed far compounding with rubber.  Various commercially .available silicas that may be considered for use in this invention include silicas commercially available from PPG .Industrie under the Hi-sil trademark with designations 210, 243, etc;1 silicas available from Rhone-Poulenc, with, for example, designations of 3HS5MP amd Z165-3R and silicas available from DegusBa AG with, for example, designations VN2 and VN3. etc.<br>
8<br><br>
The precipitated silica used to produce the modified filler of the present invention may be produced, for example, by acidic precipitation from solutions of silicates, e.g., sodium silicate. The method of preparing the precipitated silica is not limiting on the present invention and will depend"upon the?deeired properties of the silica, such as, surface area arid particle size required for a given application.<br>
The BET surface area of the precipitated silica used in preparing the modified silica of the present invention will generally he  within a range of from 50 mVg to 1QQ0 "Tn"/g, and will preferably be within a. range of from 100 mVg to 500<br>
The precipitated silica used to form the modified silica may be in the form of an aqueous suspension from production stages that precede the drying step, such as a slurry formed during precipitation or as a reliquefied filter cake. The suspension can also be formed by re-dispersing dried ailica into ah aqueous and/or organic solvent. The concentration of hydrophilie precipitated silica in the aqueous and/or organic suspension is not critical and can be within a range of about 1 to 90 weight percent,  Preferably, the concentration of hydrophilie precipitated silica is within a range of from 1 to SO weight percent, and more preferably within a range of from 1 to 20 .weight percent.<br>
The silane Conversion Index is defined by the equation T3/ (T1 + Ts + T*) .  The. values for T\ TJ and T5 are determined toy- solid state ",3i NMR and represent reacted ellans units. The Silane Conversion Ind»x provides an indication of the degree of reaction or crosslinking of the eilanes on adjacent si atoms and with each other.  The higher the index number, the .greater the amount of crosslirdcing amongst the , silica surface and adjacent siluxtes.  T1 represents a<br><br><br>
                               9<br><br>
silane unit: chemically bonded at one site to either the silica surface or another silane. T5 represents a silane unit chemically bonded at two sicea to either a Si atom on the silica surface and i;o one adjacent silane, two adjacent silanes or to two adjacent surface Si atoms, i.e.. partially crosslinking"structures. Ts represents a silane unit: chemic<ily bonded at three sites to1either a si atom on the silica surface and two adjacent silanes atoms one silane or units></ily>
it is believed that an organometallic-Re&amp;cbant Conversion index, comparable to the Silane Conversion index, ■ can be developed and used by  these skilled in the coupling agent art to provide an indication of the degree of reaction or crosslinking of zireonatea .and/or tifcanates (alone or in combination with fiilanes) with the inorganic oxide and themselves.<br>
Th« Standard Reinforcement Index is.determined<br>
using  a Standard Compounding Protocol. The Standard<br>
Compounding Protocol described herein does not include the<br>
addition of free or unbounded coupling agents to the rubber<br>
batch. This is an important distinction since others have<br>
recently reported Reinforcement Indexes, i.e.,.300 percent<br>
modulus/100 percent modulus ratios, greater than 4.0. See<br>
U.S. Patents 5,e4fi,3ii and 5,976,494.  In both .patents during<br>
rubber compounding, Silane X 50-S, a silica/rubber coupling<br>
agent, was added. Typically, the addition of such coupling<br>
agents to a rubber batch requires more time for mixing by the<br>
compounder, 	;<br>
The polymeric compositions, e.g., plastics and/or resin, in which the modified- filler can be added include essentially any plastic and/or resin.  Included in "this definition are rubber compounds. Such polymers are described in. Kirk Ochmer Encyclopedia of  Chemical There logy,. Fourth<br>

A 1.89 liter (L) Farrel Banbury mixer (Model "BR") was used for mixing the various ingredients.  Immediately prior to adding the batch ingredients to the mixer, 800 grams (g) of CV-60 grade natural rubber was put through the mixer to clean it of any residue of previous runs and increase the temperature to about 93°C. (200°F.).  After removing the rubber, the mixer was cooled to about 65°C. (150°F.) before adding the ingredients to produce the rubber test sample.<br>
A rubber composition is prepared using the test silica, the following other enumerated ingredients and the procedure described hereinafter.<br>

The first pass was initiated by adding the rubber, viz., SBR and BR, to the mixer arid mixing for 0.5 minute at 116 rpm.  The rotor speed was maintained at 116 rpm and -57.5 phr of the treated silica sample was added.  After a further 1.5 minute, the ram was raised and the chute swept, i.e., the covering on the entry chute was raised and any material that was found in the chute was swept back into the mixer.  After a further minute, the sample from Part A was added.  After another minute, the ram was raised and the chute swept.  The contents in the mixer were mixed for an additional minute to achieve a maximum temperature in the range of from 145 to 150°C. (293 to 302°F.) and to complete the first pass in the mixer. - Depending upon the type of sample, the rotor speed of the mixer may be increased or decreased after 4 minutes to achieve a temperature in the foregoing range within the .specified mixing period.<br>
After completing the first pass, the temperature of the material was determined with a thermocouple to verify that it did not exceed the maximum temperature of 150°C.  The removed material was weighed and sheeted in a Parrel 12 inch two-roll rubber mill at 2.032 mm ± 0.127 mm (0.080 inch ± 0.005 inch).  The resulting milled stock was cut into strips in preparation for the second pass in the mixer.<br>
A minimum of one hour was allotted between the completion of the first pass in the mixer and the beginning of the second pass to allow the milled"stock to cool.  If necessary, the aforedescribed cleaning and warming-up procedure using CV-6 0 grade natural rubber was completed prior to initiating the second pass.  The temperature of the mixer was adjusted to approximately 49°C.(120°F.).  With the cooling water running, the second pass was initiated by adding the strips of first pass stock to the mixer operating at 77 rpm and the preweighed combination of Santo^iex8 13 antiozonant and<br>
33-<br><br>
Okerin© 7240 Uiicrocryntalline wax/paraffin wax blend.  After 0.5 minutes, the second addition of the combination of RM Sulfur, TBBS and DPG was added.  After a further 1.5 minutes, the ram was raised and the chute swept.  The second pass was completed by mixing the stock an additional 2.0 minutes while maintaining the temperature at or below 125°C. (257°F.).<br>
Part C A Parrel 12 inch two-roll rubber mill was heated to approximately 60°C. (140°F.).  The stock from the second pass of Part B was fed into,, the running mill with a nip setting of 2.032 mm ± 0.127 mm (0.080 inch + 0.005 inch).  The resulting sheet was placed on a flat surface until the temperature of the sheet reached room temperature.  Typically, the sheet "?  cooled within about 30 minutes.  Afterwards, the milled r;heet was fed into the rubber mill with a nip setting of 3.81 mm + 0.51 mm (0.15 inch ± 0.02 inch). The rolling bank was adjusted, if necessary, to maintain a uniform thickness.  The resulting material was subjected to 16 side cuts and then 8 end passes.  The rubber mill nip was adjusted to produce a sheet thickness of 2.032 mm ± 0.127 mm (0.080 inch + 0.005 inch).  The sheet stock collected off the mill was placed on a flat clean surface.  Using a stencil, a rectangular sample 203.2 mm x 152.4 mm (8 inches x 6- inches) was cut from the sheet stock.  The sample was conditioned, i.e., stored between clean polyethylene sheets and maintained for 15 to 19 hours at a temperature of 23° ± 2° C, and a relative humidity of 50% + 5%.<br>
■ After conditioning, the sample was placed in a 203.2 mm x 152.4 mm x 2.286 mm (8 inch x 6 inch x 0.09 inch) standard frame machine steel compression mold having a polished surface.  The sample was cured in a 61 centimeter x<br>
34<br><br>
61 centimeter (24 inch x 24 inch) 890 kilonewton (100 ton) 4-post electrically heated compression press, for T90, i.e., the time it takes for 90 percent of the cure to occur, in accordance with ASTM D-2084, plus 5 minutes at 150°C. (302°F.) under a pressure of 13.79 megapascals (2000 pounds per square inch).  Typically, curing was completed within about 10 minutes.  The resulting cured rubber sheet was removed from the mold and maintained for 15 to 18 hours at a temperature of 23° ± 2°C. (73.4 ± 3.6°F.), and a relative humidity of 50% ± 5% prior to testing in Part D.<br>
Part D Testing was performed in accordance with ASTM D 412-98a - Test Method A.  Dumbbell test specimens were prepared using Die C.  An Instron model 4204 with an automated contact extensiometer for measuring elongation was used.  The cross-head speed was found to equal 508 mm/min.  All calculations were done using the Series IX Automated Materials Testing software supplied by the manufacturer.  The Reinforcement Index equals the Tensile Stress at 3 0 0% elongation (in MPa) divided by the Tensile Stress at 100% elongation (in MPa).  When the samples were prepared using the Standard Compounding Protocol, the results were reported as the Standard Reinforcement Index:<br>
PREPARATION OF PRECIPITATED SILICA A precipitated silica was produced by acidifying a sodium silicate solution with sulfuric acid.  The majority of the precipitate was formed at a pH above 8.5.  Further precipitate was produced by continuing the acid addition until the solution pH reached a level from 3.3 to 4.0.<br>
A sample of the precipitated silica for surface area analysis, as described _u ". ,:ample 15, was prepared by<br>
35<br><br>
filtering and washing a portion of the silica until the rinse water demonstrated a conductivity level of from about 300 to 800 micromho.s.  The resulting filter cake was re-liquefied using a high shear agitator to form a solid in liquid suspension.  The suspension was dried, in a Niro spray drier (inlet temperature about 360°C and the outlet temperature about 110°C).  Listed in Table 1 are the surface areas of the precipitated silicas used to prepare the modified silicas of the Examples and Comparative Examples.<br>
EXAMPLES 1-6<br>
Approximately 50 kilograms (kg) of the precipitated silica suspension of which about 3.25 kg is silica and from 15.2 to 15.9 kg of isopropyl alcohol were added to a 30 gallon glass lined vessel having a bottom drain.  The vessel was also equipped with a temperature recorder, mechanical stirrer, means for heating and a condenser.<br>
While the contents of the vessel were stirred and heating initiated, 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS) was added oyer an interval of time (typically, about 10 minutes) that would yield the approximate amounts listed for weight percent of MPTMS per silica on a dry basis for the examples listed in Table 1.  After completion of the MPTMS addition, dimethyldichlorosilane (DMDCS) was added in an identical manner to yield the approximate amounts listed for weight percent of DMDCS per silica on a dry basis in Table 1. The weight ratios of MPTMS/DMDCS is also listed in Table 1. The resulting pH of the solutions ranged from about 1.5 to about 2.2.<br>
After completion of the DMDCS addition, an amount of concentrated, i.e., about 37 wt. %, hydrochloric acid necessary to reduce the pH of the solution to about 0.3 was added.  The mixture was heated to abou- 6   -C and held at this<br>
36<br><br>
temperature for about 30 minutes.  While cooling, enough 50 wt.% NaOH was added to the mixture over an interval of time to adjust the pH to about 3.5.  After completion of the NaOH addition, enough toluene (typically 6.75 to 7.75 kg) was added to the stirred mixture to effect separation of the hydrophobic precipitated silica from the aqueous phase without forming an emulsion.  The aqueous phase was drained from the vessel.<br>
The stirred mixture in the vessel containing the hydrophobic precipitated silica was then washed with about 30 kg of water.  Enough additional toluene (typically 6.5 to 8.0 kg) was added to the stirred mixture to effect separation of the hydrophobic precipitated silica from the aqueous phase without forming an emulsion.  The aqueous phase was drained. The stirred mixture containing the hydrophobic precipitated silica was then washed two more times with about 3 0 kg of water per wash.  The aqueous phase was drained from the vessel after each wash and before addition of the subsequent wash.<br>
After washing was completed, enough toluene (typically from 12.5 to 15.3 kg) was added to the stirred mixture to make a flowable solid-in-liquid suspension that could be easily discharged from the vessel.  The resulting suspension was dried in a rotocone drier under vacuum (minimum 23 inches of mercury) at a minimum of 140°C.  Drying was continued until the samples showed a wt.% loss of less than 4 % when exposed to 160°C for 10 minutes.<br>
EXAMPLE 7 The procedure described for Examples 1-6 was followed except for the following: 00 g of 3-mercapto-propyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS) was added over about 10 minutes; 487 g of dimethyldichlorosilane was added over about 10 minutes; isopropyl alcohol and toluene were not used and slurries of thz.a  dividual batches were combined, filtered<br>
36<br><br>
and washed with water until the rinse water demonstrated a conductivity level of from about 300 to 800 micromhos.  The treated silica- sample was dried until a sample showed 
The approximate weight percents of MPTMS and DMDCS per silica on a dry basis and,the weight ratio of MPTMS / DMDCS for the modified silica sample of Example 7 are listed in Table 2.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
The procedure described for Examples 1-6 was followed except for the following: 40 kg of a re-liquefied solid in liquid precipitated silica suspension (3.3 kg of silica) and 12.2 kg of isopropyl alcohol were used,- 171 g of 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS) was added over about 7 minutes; S06 g of dimethyldichlorosilane (DMDCS) was added over about 2 minutes; concentrated hydrochloric acid was added over 24 minutes resulting in a solution pH of about 0.4; after heating the solution for 30 minutes at about 68°C. , enough 50 wt.% NaOH was added to adjust the pH to about 7.0; enough toluene {about 7.1 kg) was added to effect separation of the hydrophobic silica from the aqueous phase without forming an emulsion.  The recovered product was not subjected to water washing but, after draining the aqueous phase, about 2.2 kg of toluene was added to the product to make a flowable solid in liquid suspension.  The treated silica sample was dried until a sample showed 
The approximate weight percents of MPTMS and DMDCS per silica on a dry basis and the weight ratio of MPTMS / DMDCS for the modified silica sample of Example 8 are listed in Table 2.<br>
38<br><br>
EXAMPLE 9 The procedure of Example 8 was followed except that 86.5 g of 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS) was used. The approximate weight percents of MPTMS and DMDCS per silica on a dry basis and the weight ratio of MPTMS / DMDCS for the modified silica sample of Example 9 are listed in Table 2.<br>
EXAMPLES 10-13 Both silanes (DMDCS &amp; MPTMS) and acid (sufficient to result in a pH of about 0.3) were commixed with a freshly prepared silica slurry having a temperature of. about from 65 to 85°C. immediately prior to being added to a vessel. The acid used was concentrated, i.e., about 96 wt %, sulfuric acid in all of the examples except Example 13 which used concentrated hydrochloric acid.  The resulting mixture was left quiescent .for at least 15 minutes.  Water was added and agitation applied and the pH was adjusted to about 3.5 with 50 wt.% aqueous sodium hydroxide.  The resulting aqueous suspension of hydrophobic silica was filtered and washed with water until the rinse water demonstrated a conductivity level of from about 300 to 800 micromhos.  The hydrophobic silica was dried until a sample showed less than 2.5 weight percent loss when exposed to 106°C for 10 minutes.  The approximate amounts of the silanes added to the slurry are reported in Table 2 on a percentage weight based on dry silica along with the weight ratios of MPTMS / DMDCS.<br>
EXAMPLE 14 The procedure of Examples 10-13 was followed except that no acid was added, only the acid generated by the hydrolysis of DMDCS was present.  Enough (MPTMS) and enough dimethyldichlorosilane (DMDCS) were added to result in the<br>
39<br><br>
approximate weight percents of each per silica on a dry basis listed in Table 2. The pH of the resulting solution was 1.6.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES 1-3 The procedure described for Examples 1-6 was followed.  The approximate amounts of the silanes added to the slurry are reported in Table 2 on a percentage weight based on dry silica along with the weight ratios of MPTMS / DMDCS.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 4 The procedure of Examples 10-13 was followed except that only mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane was added to result in the approximate weight percent of MPTMS per silica on a dry basis listed in Table 2, and enough concentrated sulfuric acid was added to result in a pH of about 0.0.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 5 The procedure of Comparative Example 4 was followed except that only dimethyldichlorosilane was added to result in the approximate weight percent of DCDMS per silica on a dry basis listed in Table 2, enough concentrated sulfuric acid was added to result in a pH of about 0.4.<br>
EXAMPLE 15 The surface area of the treated and untreated test silica samples of Examples 1-14 and Comparative Examples(CE) 1-5 was determined using a Horiba 6200 series instrument by a dynamic single point surface area technique, ASTM D3037-93, Procedure C (modified).  This procedure simulates the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method at P/PQ = 0.294 using 30% nitrogen-in-hel"ium as the adsorbate gas.  The ASTM procedure was modified as follows: a 30% nitrogen-in-helium gas mixture was used; a i_ov-of approximately 40 mL/min was maintained,-<br>
40<br><br>
samples were dried in the analysis cells under a flow of nitrogen at 180±5QC for one hour; and the adsorbed nitrogen on the sample was desorbed by removing the dewar of liquid nitrogen and allowing the sample to warm to room temperature with no external heat source.  Results for the untreated test silica samples are listed in Table l and for the treated test silica samples are. listed in Table 3.<br>
The percent carbon was determined by CHN analysis using a Carlo Erba model 1106 elemental analyzer.  A 1 - 2 mg sample in a sealed tin capsule was burned in an oxygen enriched atmosphere at 1040 °C with a Helium carrier, quantitatively combusted over Cr2Oj, then the combustion gases were passed over Cu at 650 °C, to eliminate the excess oxygen and reduce the oxides of nitrogen to nitrogen^  The gases were then passed through a chromatographic column, separated and elut"ed as N3, C03, and H20.  The eluted gases were measured by a thermal conductivity detector.  The instrument was calibrated by combustion of standard compounds.  Results are listed in Table 3.<br>
The percent mercapto (SH) listed in Table 3 was determined by accurately weighing 2-3 grams of the treated silica to the nearest O.OOlg in an Erlenmeyer flask, adding 75ml of isopropyl alcohol, flushing with nitrogen, sealing with a wet stopper and magnetically stirring for 30 minutes. The stirred solution was titrated quickly with standard 0.01N Iodine solution, commercially available from LabChem Inc., to a slight yellow endpoint.  A blank titration was also done by following the same procedure except without adding the treated silica.  If blocked mercaptosilane was used to modify the filler, it will be necessary to deblock the blocked mercaptosilane before titrating.  The following equation was used to obtain the final value.<br>
% SH = (V1-V2) x N x 3.3 / W<br>
41<br><br>
where:    VI is the volume of iodine solution used with the sample<br>
V2 is the volume of iodine solution used in the blank<br>
N is the normality of the iodine solution W is the weight of the silica in grams<br>
The Silane Conversion Index reported as SCI in Table 3 was determined by solid state "Si NMR.  This data was collected at ambient temperature on a Bruker AM-300 NMR with a narrow bore magnet and .a Doty 7 mm standard speed MAS probe. Samples were packed into 7 mm o.d. zirconia rotors and sealed with short Kel-F caps.  The rotors were spun at the Magic Angle with a speed of about 5.0 kHz.  Cross Polarization (CP/MAS) data was collected using a 90° XH pulse, 5600 - 8400 scans per spectrum, a 5 jnsecond contact time, high power proton decoupling during data acquisition, and a 3 second relaxation delay.  Hartmann-Hahn conditions were achieved using a kaolinite sample (J. Rocha and J. Klinowski, J.   Magn. Reson.,   90, 567 (1990)).  All chemical shifts were referenced externally to tetramethylsilane (TMS).<br>
All spectra were analyzed using a nonlinear curve fitting program (LINBSIM) on an Aspect 3000 computer to determine the relative area % for the Tl (-49 ppm) , T2 (-57 ppm) , and T3 (-65 ppm) peaks.  Area % values for T1, T3, and T3 were determined by curve fitting over the region of -3 0 ppm to -80 ppm.<br>
pH determination:! were made on the treated ;;ilica;; of the Examples and Comparative Examples by the following procedure:, add 5.0 g of silica (in powder form) to a 150 mL beaker containing a magnetic stir bar; add 50 mL of isopropanol and 50 mL of deionized water; and stir vigorously w,;h .vc splashing until the silica is suspended.  Place a<br><br>
                             12<br><br><br>
calibrated pH electrode in the vigorously stirring solution and record the pH reading after one minute (±  5 sec).  The results are listed in Table 3.<br>
The Standard Reinforcement Index reported in Table 3 was determined by dividing the Tensile. Stress at 300% elongation by the Tensile Stress at 100% elongation.  The values for,the Tensile Stress at 3 00% and 100% elongations are included in Table 4.<br>
The Soxhlet Extractable percent carbon of the treated silicas of Examples 1, 2 and 7 wan determined by adding, approximately 5 grams of each material to 43 mm x~123 mm (internal diameter x external length) cellulose extraction thimbles which was placed into an appropriately sized Soxhlet extraction tube which was fitted with a condenser.  This Soxhlet extractor and condenser system was attached to a round bottom flask containing 700 mL of toluene.  The flask heated to the reflux temperature of the toluene.  After fefluxing for a minimum of 19 hours (typically 19 to 26 hours), the used toluene was replaced with unused toluene and refluxing was continued for a minimum of 19 hours (typically 19 to 24 hours).  The resulting extracted treated silicas were recovered and dried until a sample showed less than a 1.2 weight percent loss when exposed to 160°C for 10 minutes.  The percent carbon of each extracted sample was determined using the procedure described herein.  The Soxhlet extractable percent carbon was determined using the following equation:<br>
(% carbon before extraction) - (%■ carbon after extraction) x 100 (% carbon before extraction)<br>
The results are listed in Table 5.<br>

The results of Table 1 show that the surface areas of the untreated silica samples used in the process of making the Examples and Comparative Examples ranged from 172 to 214 mVg.<br>
The MPTMS/DMDCS ratios listed in Table 2 for Examples 1-14 ranged from 0.05:1 to 0.40:1.  The ratios for Comparative Examples 2 and 3, which contained both silanes, were 0.08:1 and 0.03:1 respectively.  Although the MPTMS/DMDCS ratio of Comparative Example {CE)2 was within the desired range of 0.05:1 to 10:1, the results for Mercapto(SH) weight percent, listed in Table 3 for the treated silica of CE-2 were less than the required amount of greater than 0.15 weight percent.<br>
