				<td>"NOVEL COMPOUNDS AS BETA-3-ADRENORECEPTOR AGONIST"<br>
Field of the invention<br>
This invention relates to a new class of chemical compounds and to their use<br>
in medicine. In particular, the invention concerns novel phenethanolamine<br>
derivatives, methods for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions<br>
containing them and their use as agonists at atypical beta-adrenoceptors (also<br>
known as beta-3-adrenoceptors).<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Atypical beta-adrenoceptors belong to the family of adrenoceptors that<br>
mediate the physiological actions of the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline.<br>
Such receptors have been described for example by J R S Arch et al., Nature,<br>
309, 163-165 (1984); C Wilson et a/., Eur. J. Pharmacol., 100, 309-319 (1984); L<br>
J Emorine et al., Science, 245, 1118-1121 (1989); and A. Biancherti et al. Br. J.<br>
Pharmacol., 100, 831-839 (1990).<br>
Phenethanolamine derivatives having activity at atypical beta-adrenoceptors<br>
are disclosed in, for example, European Patent Applications EP-A-0455006 and<br>
EP-A-0543662.<br>
Sub-types of the adrenoceptors, ar, a2-, ßr, ß2- and ß3-(atypica!) can be<br>
identified on the basis of their pharmacological properties and physiological<br>
effects. Chemical agents that stimulate or block these receptors (but not ß3) are<br>
widely used in clinical medicine. More recently, emphasis has been placed<br>
upon specific receptor selectivity in order to reduce side effects caused, in part,<br>
by interactions with other receptors.<br>
Atypical beta-adrenoceptors are known to occur in adipose tissue and the<br>
gastrointestinal tract. Atypical beta-adrenoceptor agonists have been found to be<br>
particularly useful as thermogenic anti-obesity agents and as anti-diabetic<br>
agents. Compounds having atypical beta-adrenoceptor agonist activity have also<br>
been described as being useful in the treatment of hyperglycaemia, as animal<br>
growth promoters, as blood platelet aggregation inhibitors, as positive inotropic<br>
agents and as antiatherosclerotic agents, and as being useful in the treatment of<br>
glaucoma.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention therefore provides, in a first aspect, compounds of formula<br>
(I) and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof:<br><br>
wherein X is oxygen or sulfur, optionally substituted by one or more groups<br>
selected from C1-4 alkyl and halogen, and where the heterocycle containing X is<br>
substituted meta or para to the depicted NH;<br>
R1 is hydrogen or C1-6alky!;<br>
R represents substituents selected from C1-6 alkyl, halogen, trifluoromethyl and<br>
C1-6alkoxy; and<br>
n represents an integer from 0-4.<br>
Preferably the compounds of this invention are agonists for human beta-3<br>
adrenoceptor ("ß3"). More preferably, the compounds of this invention are<br>
selective agonists for ß3.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical<br>
formulation comprising a compound of the invention. Preferred pharmaceutical<br>
compositions further comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for the prevention<br>
or treatment of clinical conditions or diseases susceptible to amelioration by<br>
administration of an atypical beta-adrenoceptor agonist, comprising<br>
administration of an effective amount of a compound or composition of this<br>
invention.<br>
in a further aspect, the present invention provides the use of a compound of<br>
formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, in the<br>
manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of conditions or diseases<br>
susceptible to amelioration by administration of an atypical beta-adrenoceptor<br>
agonist.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
As used herein, the terms "alkyl" and "alkoxy" mean a straight or branched<br>
alkyl group or alkoxy group respectively, containing the indicated number of<br>
carbon atoms. For example, C1-6alky! means a straight or branched alkyl<br>
containing at least 1 and at most 6 carbon atoms.<br>
Preferably the heterocycle containing X is substituted meta to the depicted<br>
NH.<br>
Preferably R1 is hydrogen or methyl. When R1 is other than hydrogen, then<br>
preferably the stereochemisty around the carbon to which R1 is bonded is R.<br>
Preferably R is chlorine, fluorine, or CF3.<br>
Preferably n is 0, 1, or 2. Most preferably n is 0.<br>
Preferably the stereochemisty around the carbon to which the depicted OH is<br>
bonded is JR.,............<br>
It will be appreciated that the above compounds of Formula (I) may contain<br>
optically active centers. The individual, isolated isomers and mixtures thereof,<br>
including racemates, are all within the scope of the present invention. Typically,<br>
where R1 is methyl, mixtures of diastereomers of compounds of Formula (I) may<br>
be obtained, which are enriched with greater than or equal to 80% by weight of<br>
one diastereomer.<br>
Suitable compounds of formula (I) of the invention include:<br>
2-(3-{2R-[2-(3-Chlorophenyl)-2R-hydroxyl-ethylamino]propylamino}phenyl)furan-<br>
3-carboxylic acid;<br>
2-(3-{[2-(3-Chlorophenyl)-2R-hydroxyl-ethylamino]ethylamino}phenyl)furan-3-<br>
carboxylic acid;<br>
2-(4-{2R-[2-(3-Chlorophenyl)-2R-hydroxyl-ethylamino]propylamino}phenyl)furan-<br>
3-carboxylic acid;<br>
2-(3-{2R-[2-(3-Chlorophenyl)-2R-hydroxyl-<br>
ethylamino]propylamino}phenyl)thiophene-3-carboxylic acid;<br>
2-(3-{[2-(3-Chiorophenyl)-2R-hydroxyl-ethylamino]ethy!amino}phenyi)thiophene-<br>
3-carboxylic acid;<br>
2-(4-{2R-[2-(3-Chloropheny!)-2R-hydroxyl-<br>
ethy!amino]propylamino}phenyl)thiophene-3-carboxylic acid; and<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof.<br>
Particularly preferred compounds of the invention include:<br>
2-(3-{[2~(3-Chlorophenyl)-2R-hydroxyl-ethylamino]ethylamino}phenyl)furan-3-<br>
carboxylic acid;<br>
2-(3-{[2-(3-Chlorophenyl)-2R-hydroxyl-ethylamino]ethylamino}phenyl)thiophene-<br>
3-carboxylic acid; and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof.<br>
By "a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative" is meant any pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt, ester, or salt of such ester, of a compound of formula (I) or any<br>
other compound which, upon administration to the recipient, is capable of<br>
providing (directly or indirectly) a compound of formula (I) or an active metabolite<br>
or residue thereof.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the compounds of formula<br>
(I) may be modified to provide pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof at<br>
any of the functional groups in the compounds of formula (I). Of particular<br>
interest as such derivatives are compounds modified at the carboxyl function,<br>
hydroxyl functions or at amino groups.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable derivatives of the compounds of formula (I) may be derivatised at<br>
more than one position.<br>
Preferred pharmaceuticaliy acceptable derivatives of the compounds of<br>
formula (I) are pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula (I) include<br>
those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic and organic acids and<br>
bases. Examples of suitable acids include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric,<br>
nitric, perchloric, fumaric, maleic, phosphoric, glycollic, lactic, salicylic, succinic,<br>
toluene- p-sulphonic, tartaric, acetic, citric, methanesulphonic, formic, benzoic,<br>
malonic, naphthalene-2-sulphonic and benzenesulphonic acids. Other acids<br>
such as oxalic, while not in themselves pharmaceutically acceptable may be<br>
useful in the preparation of salts useful as intermediates in obtaining compounds<br>
of the invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts.<br>
Salts derived from appropriate bases include alkali metal (e.g. sodium),<br>
alkaline earth metal (e.g. magnesium), ammonium and NR4+ (where R is C1-<br>
4alkyl) salts.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
derivatives act as agonists at atypical beta-adrenoceptors and as such are useful<br>
in the treatment of clinical conditions susceptible to amelioration by<br>
administration of an atypical beta-adrenoceptor agonist. Such conditions include<br>
hyperglycaemia, obesity, hyperlipemia, irritable bowel syndrome and its<br>
associated pain, motility dysfunction, excessive gastrointestinal secretion, non-<br>
specific diarrhoea, neurogenic inflammation, regulation of intraocular pressure,<br>
triglyceridemia, diabetes, e.g. non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM or<br>
Type 2), such as obese NIDDM and non-obese NIDDM, diabetic complications<br>
such as retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, cataracts, coronary heart<br>
diseases and arteriosclerosis, osteoporosis; and gastrointestinal disorders,<br>
particularly inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders. They are also of use in<br>
increasing the high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration and<br>
decreasing the triglyceride concentration in blood serum, especially human blood<br>
serum, and are therefore of potential use in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of<br>
atherosclerosis. They also may be useful for the treatment of hyperinsulinaemia,<br>
depression, muscle wasting, and urinary incontinence. References in this<br>
specification to treatment include prophylactic treatment as well as the alleviation<br>
of symptoms.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention provides the use of a compound of general<br>
Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, for the<br>
manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a condition susceptible of<br>
amelioration by an atypical beta-adrenoceptor agonist.<br>
While it is possible that, for use in therapy, a compound of the invention may<br>
be adnninistered as the raw chemical it is preferable to present the active<br>
ingredient as a pharmaceutical formulation. The invention thus further provides a<br>
pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound of Formula (I) or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof together with one or more<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers thereof and, optionally, other therapeutic<br>
and/or prophylactic ingredients. The carrier(s) or excipient(s) must be<br>
"acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the<br>
formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.<br>
The compounds for use according to the present invention may be formulated<br>
for oral, buccal, parenteral, rectal or transdermal administration or in a form<br>
suitable for administration by inhalation or insufflation (either through the mouth<br>
or the nose).<br>
For oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the form<br>
of, for example, tablets or capsules prepared by corventional means with<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents (e.g.<br>
pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl<br>
methylcellulose); fillers (e.g. lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or calcium<br>
hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate, talc or silica);<br>
disintegrants (e.g. potato starch or sodium starch glycollate); or wetting agents<br>
(e.g. sodium lauryl sulphate). The tablets may be coated by methods well known<br>
in the art. Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, for<br>
example, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they may be presented as a dry<br>
product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such<br>
liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g. sorbitol<br>
syrup, cellulose derivatives or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (e.g.<br>
lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g. almond oil, oily esters, ethyl<br>
alcohol or fractionated vegetable oils); and preservatives (e.g. methyl or propyl-p-<br>
hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid). The preparations may also contain buffer<br>
salts, flavoring, coloring and sweetening agents as appropriate. Preparations for<br>
oral administration may be suitably formulated to give controlled release of the<br>
active compound.<br>
For buccal administration the compositions may take the form of tablets or<br>
lozenges formulated in conventional manner.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention may be formulated for<br>
parenteral administration by injection e.g. by bolus injection or continuous<br>
infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form e.g. in<br>
ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The<br>
compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily<br>
or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending,<br>
stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in<br>
powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile pyrogen-free<br>
water, before use.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention may also be formulated in<br>
rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g. containing<br>
conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
In addition to the formulations described previously, the compounds may also<br>
be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be<br>
administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously, transcutaneously or<br>
intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds<br>
according to the present invention may be formulated with suitable polymeric or<br>
hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion<br>
exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly<br>
soluble salt.<br>
Suitable therapeutic ingredients which may be formulated with compounds of<br>
the invention, together with one or more pharmaceutical carriers or excipients,<br>
include ingredients which may be used in the same clinical conditions as those<br>
listed herein for atypical beta-adrenoceptor agonists. Such ingredients may<br>
include, for example, PPAR-gamma agonists.<br>
A proposed dose of the compounds according to the present invention for<br>
administration to a human (of approximately 70 kg body weight) is 0.1 mg to 1 g,<br>
preferably to 1 mg to 100 mg of the active ingredient per unit dose, expressed as<br>
the weight of free base. The unit dose may be administered, for example, 1 to 4<br>
times per day. The dose will depend on the route of administration. It will be<br>
appreciated that it may be necessary to make routine variations to the dosage<br>
depending on the age and weight of the patient as well as the severity of the<br>
condition to be treated. The precise dose and route of administration will<br>
ultimately be at the discretion of the attendant physician or veterinarian.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be prepared by any of the processes<br>
known in the art for the preparation of similar compounds. For example,<br>
according to a first process wherein X, R1, and R are as defined as for formula (I),<br>
compounds of formula (I) may be prepared by reaction of compounds of formula<br>
(II) and (III) <br>
where P1 and P2 are suitable protecting groups for oxygen and nitrogen groups<br>
respectively and R2 is lower alkyl or H, in the presence of a reducing agent,<br>
followed by deprotection of any protecting groups present.<br>
Compounds of formula (II) are described in PCT publication number<br>
WO95/33724 or may be prepared by standard methods.<br>
In an alternative process, a compound of formula (I) may be prepared by<br>
hydrolysis of a compound of formula (IV) or a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
version thereof: <br>
wherein R and R1 are as defined in formulas (II) and (III), R2 is lower alkyl and R3<br>
represents C1-6 alkyl or aryl optionally substituted by hydrogen, C1-6 alkyl or<br>
halogen; followed by the step of hydrolysing the ester group -CO2R2 to produce a<br>
compound of formula (I), wherein the furan ring is substituted by a -CO2H group.<br>
Preferably, hydrolysis of a compound of formula (IV) to form a compound<br>
of Formula (I) is carried out by reflux in the presence of an aqueous solution of a<br>
group 1 or group 2 metal hydroxide, e.g. NaOH or KOH, and preferably an<br>
alkanol, e.g. MeOH, for at least 4h. The step of hydrolysing the ester group -<br>
CO2R2 to produce a compound of formula (IA), wherein R4 is substituted by a -<br>
CO2H group can be carried out by a further hydrolysis step under standard<br>
hydrolysis conditions as would be apparent to a skilled person.<br>
A compound of formula (IV) may be prepared by reacting a compound of<br>
formula (V) with a compound of formula (VI):<br><br>
at elevated temperature and pressure, optionally in the presence of one or more<br>
of: C3-6alkanols, acetonitrile, N-methyl-pyrrolidinone (NMP), isobutylacetate,<br>
isopropylacetate, dimethylformamide (DMF), toluene, xylene or<br>
dimethylacetamide (DMA); preferably toluene and/or xylene. The temperature for<br>
the reaction is suitably 100°C or greater, preferably 100-150°C, more preferably<br>
100-120°C.<br>
The reaction of a compound of formula (V) with a compound of formula<br>
(VI) to form a compound of formula (IV) and the subsequent conversion of a<br>
compound of formula (IV) to a compound of formula (I) may be carried out<br>
separately or in situ. The reaction is preferably carried out in situ.<br>
A compound of formula (VI) may be prepared from a compound of<br>
formula.(VII):<br><br>
wherein L represents a leaving group such as a halogen atom (e.g. chlorine), by<br>
5 cyclisation in the presence of a solvent selected from: dichloromethane (DCM),<br>
EtOAc, toluene and/or xylene, and a base selected from: Na2CO3, NaOH,<br>
anhydrous Et3N and/or an amine, e.g. aqueous NH3. Preferably the solvent is<br>
DCM. Preferably the base is aqueous NH3.<br>
Compounds of Formula (VII) may be prepared from compounds of<br>
10 Formula (III) using any suitable method for the preparation of amidines. For<br>
example, by condensation of a compound of Formula (VIII) wherein L represents<br>
a leaving group <br>
as previously defined, in the presence of a solvent selected from: DCM, toluene,<br>
15 EtOAc, or CH3CN, and PCI5 or POCI3. Preferably the solvent is EtOAc.<br>
Preferably PCI5 is present.<br>
A compound of formula (III) may be prepared by reaction of a compound of<br>
formula (IX)<br><br>
where Y represents the diazonium salt N2+, with a suitable 5-membered<br>
heterocyclic ring of formula (X), followed by reduction of the nitro group using<br>
standard methods. Suitable compounds of formula (X) are known or are<br>
prepared by standard methods. For example, where X is oxygen, thus forming a<br>
furan group, a compound of formula (III) may be prepared directly by reaction of<br>
a compound of formula (IX) where Y represents the diazonium salt N2+ with a<br>
furan of formula (X), followed by reduction with standard methods. A compound<br>
of formula (IX) where Y represents the diazonium salt N2+ may in turn be<br>
prepared from a compound of formula (IX) where Y = NH? by standard methods<br>
known in the literature. Alternatively, a compound of formula (III) may be<br>
prepared from the reaction of a compound of formula (IX) where Y = Br, I or<br>
triflate with a furan of formula (X) in the presence of a suitable palladium catalyst<br>
and a suitable base followed by reduction of the nitro grcup under standard<br>
conditions. Suitable palladium catalysts include, but are not limited to,<br>
tetrakiis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0). Suitable bases include, but are not<br>
limited to KOAc. Use of the palladium catalyst Pd(PPh3)4 in the presence of the<br>
base KOAc is preferred.<br>
Compounds of formula (IX) are known compounds or may be prepared by<br>
processes well known in the art.<br>
Suitable reducing agents of use in the reactions include hydrogen in the<br>
presence of a catalyst, such as a noble metal catalyst, for examplepalladium,<br>
platinum or platinum oxide, Raney-nickel or hydride reducing agents such as<br>
borohydrides, for example sodium borohydride sodium triacetoxyborohydride or<br>
sodium cyanoborohydride. Suitable reaction conditions will be readily apparent<br>
to those skilled in the art and are further illustrated by the accompanying<br>
examples.<br>
The protecting groups used in the preparation of compounds of formula (I)<br>
may be used in conventional manner. See for example "Protective Groups in<br>
Organic Chemistry" Ed. J. F. W. McOmie (Plenum Press 1973) or "Protective<br>
Groups in Organic Synthesis" by Theodora W Greene and P M G Wuts (John<br>
Wiley and Sons 1991).<br>
Conventional amino protecting groups may include for example araikyl<br>
groups,-such as benzyl, diphenylmethyl or triphenylmethyl groups; and acyl<br>
groups such as N-benzyloxycarbony! ort-butoxycarbonyl.<br>
Conventional oxygen protecting groups may include for example alky silyl<br>
groups, such as tri methyl silyl, or tert-butyldimethyisilyl; alkyl ethers such as<br>
tetrahydropyranyl, or tert-butyl; or esters such as acetate.<br>
Removal of any protecting groups present may be achieved by conventional<br>
procedures.<br>
Atypical beta-adrenoceptor agonists are compounds, which demonstrate a<br>
pharmacological response mediated at atypical beta-adrenoceptors. This<br>
activity has been measured as the ability to stimulate lipolysis by rat adipocytes<br>
at sub-micromolar concentrations, in a response that is resistant to blockade by<br>
standard beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs such as propranolol.<br>
Another useful means of identifying an atypical beta-adrenoceptor agonist<br>
involves the measurement of agonist activity at atypical beta-adrenoceptors in<br>
the rat isolated lower oesophagus. Typically in this assay, a compound of general<br>
Formula (I) for use according to the present invention has an equipotent molar<br>
ratio (E:PMR) relevant to isoprenaline of less than 30. The rat oesophagus assay<br>
is based upon that described by Ford et. al., Br. J. Pharmacol., 105(suppl.),<br>
235P, 1992. The relative potency of each test compound (EPMR) is compared to<br>
isoprenaline as follows: <br>
wherein EC50 is the molar concentration of agonist which produces 50% of the<br>
maximum possible response for that agonist.<br>
A particularly useful method for determining agonist activity at human atypical<br>
beta-adrenoceptors involves the use of Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells<br>
i transfected with the human beta-3-adrenoceptor according to Method 1. The<br>
cell lines may also be transfected with human beta-1- and beta-2- adrenoceptor<br>
in a similar manner to provide a method of determining the selectivity of the<br>
compounds of the invention at the three receptors.<br>
Method 1 - Cell culture<br>
General cell culture guidelines are observed (Fershney, R.A. (1987) Culture<br>
of animal cells: A manual of basic technique. Wiley-Liss, Inc., N.Y.). A standard<br>
cell culture incubator is used (37°C, 5% CO2 in air, 95% relative humidity). H<br>
p3CHO cells are grown in DMEM/F12 (with pyroxidineHCI, 15 mM HEPES, L-<br>
glutamine), supplanted with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 500 µg/ml G418, 2 mM L-<br>
glutamine, 100 units penicillin G and 100 µg streptomycin sulfate. One confluent<br>
flask of cells is trypsinised and resuspended in the above medium at a<br>
concentration of 30-40,000 cells/100 ul and plated into 96-well flat bottom plates.<br>
The cells are then used for assay within 18-24 hours.<br>
The medium is aspirated from each well, and replaced with 180 µl DMEM/F12<br>
with 500 mM IBMX. Antagonists, if required, are added at this stage. The plate<br>
is then placed back in the incubator for 30 min. Drugs are then added to the<br>
wells (20 (il, 100x required final concentration) for 60 min. Responses were<br>
determined by measuring cAMP levels of a 20 ul sample of extracellular media<br>
using a scintillation proximity based radio-immunoassay (NEN Flashplates).<br>
 CHO-6CRE-luciferase cell lines which stably express hp3 receptors are<br>
seeded at 30,000 cells/well for 24 hr in DMEM/F12 containing 10% FBS. Media is<br>
removed from the cells and replaced with DMEM/F12 buffer (180 µl) containing<br>
300 mM IBMX and 1 mM ascorbic acid for 30 min prior to addition of compound.<br>
Vehicle or agonist (20 ^il) is added and incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes. At the<br>
1 end of the incubation period, samples of extracellular media are removed for<br>
direct assay in cAMP Flashplates (NEN).<br>
As used herein, a compound is considered to be an agonist for hß3 if the<br>
compound stimulates the accumulation of extracellular cAMP with CHO-6CRE-<br>
luciferase cells expressing hp3. The compounds of this invention have an EC50 of<br>
 at most 10 nM at hp3. The relative potency of a hp3 agonist may be compared to<br>
its potency for stimulating the accumulation of extracellular cAMP with CHO-<br>
6CRE-luciferase cells expressing hß2 and hß1. The compounds of this invention<br>
are at least 100 times more potent at hp3 than at hß2 or hß1<br>
The invention is further illustrated by the following intermediates and<br>
examples. All temperatures are in degrees centigrade. Chromatography was<br>
carried out on silica (Merck 9385) unless otherwise stated. HPLC<br>
