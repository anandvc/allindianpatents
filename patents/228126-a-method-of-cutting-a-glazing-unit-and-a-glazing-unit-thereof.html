				<td>gLAZING CUT WITHOUT BREAKING -IT-<br>
The invention relates to a method of cutting a glazing<br>
unit without it being necessary to apply a breaking<br>
force.<br>
A glass is usually cut according to the following<br>
successive steps:<br>
-	scoring a subcrack along the desired line of<br>
cutting, then<br>
-	application of a (breaking) force so that the<br>
subcrack propagates as a crack through the thickness of<br>
the glass, thereby breaking it as expected.<br>
However, after a glass has been cut it may be desired<br>
to improve its mechanical strength, for example its<br>
edge bending strength. To do this, a chemical<br>
toughening (or tempering) treatment may be carried out<br>
on the cut glass, generally by immersing it in a bath<br>
of molten potassium nitrate. Chemically toughened<br>
glasses therefore have their definitive shape before<br>
the chemical toughening treatment and they are not<br>
intended to be cut after the toughening has been<br>
carried out.<br>
WO 98/46537 teaches particular glass compositions<br>
obtained by chemical toughening (potassium ion<br>
exchange) for producing windows in the aeronautical<br>
field. No cutting is envisaged after the chemical<br>
toughening.<br>
EP 793 132 teaches cells formed from a pair of glass<br>
plates having electrodes on their surface, and at least<br>
one of the plates of which has undergone a chemical<br>
toughening treatment. The glass, intended to be<br>
incorporated into such a cell, is chemically toughened,<br>
then notched and broken into as many individual<br>
elements as will be incorporated into the cell. The<br>
chemical toughening treatment is carried out here on a<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
thickness of at most 2 0 μm. The above document teaches<br>
that, after having notched a glass, it is usually<br>
necessary to apply pressure in order to break it and<br>
that, in the case of a chemically toughened glass, if<br>
the chemically toughened layer is too thick it may be<br>
extremely difficult to break it. The object of<br>
EP 793 132 is to carry out a chemical toughening<br>
treatment allowing the glass to be broken in a<br>
conventional manner. To do this, glass having a maximum<br>
thickness of 2 mm is chemically treated over a maximum<br>
thickness of 20 μm.<br>
EP 875 4 90 discloses a continuous process for producing<br>
glass hardened by chemical toughening. The glass must<br>
have a maximum thickness of 1.2 mm and it is toughened<br>
in less than two hours. The chemical toughening<br>
treatment is carried out over a maximum thickness of<br>
30 μm. The glass may be wound. The glass may be covered<br>
with layers, for example metal layers, produced by<br>
sputtering, and may have an application as an LCD or<br>
DTR. The chemically treated glass may be cut into<br>
plates or sheets. That document does not teach the<br>
particular conditions for cutting the glass without<br>
breaking it.<br>
EP 982 121 discloses three-layer structures, at least<br>
one of which, on the surface, is made of glass and<br>
includes notches. The notches may have a zero width.<br>
Preferably, the layer just below the notched glass is<br>
flexible (e.g., it is a polymer). Thus the trilayer has<br>
more flexibility thanks to the notches. The notched<br>
glass may have been chemically toughened. If the notch<br>
has a nonzero width, it may be filled with a polymer<br>
having a refractive index identical to that of the<br>
notched glass. The envisaged applications are: security<br>
card, windows for buildings, smart cards, photomasks.<br>
The notches may be left visible so as to have a mirror<br>
effect.<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
EP 964 112 teaches a panel comprising a glass sheet<br>
having, over part of its thickness, grooves arranged<br>
horizontally and parallel to one another. These cuts<br>
are preferably produced by a laser. That document does<br>
not teach the chemical toughening of the glass.<br>
FR 1 598 242, FR 2 053 664 and FR 2 063 482 teach the<br>
chemical toughening in the presence of screens that<br>
protect certain areas from the toughening. The cut is<br>
then produced in these areas. This treatment<br>
necessarily generates an imbalance of the stresses in<br>
the thickness, compared with a thermally toughened pane<br>
without a screen. Thus, these glazing units are not in<br>
self-equilibrium in the thickness. Furthermore, a<br>
ribbon thus treated is not homogeneous and has to be<br>
cut in the. areas protected by the screens These<br>
documents do not therefore teach how to produce a<br>
glazing unit that can be cut, without breaking it after<br>
scoring, at whatever point on its surface, whereas this<br>
is the case for the glazing units according to the<br>
invention because of their homogeneity. In addition,<br>
the screens recommended by those documents impair the<br>
effect of the thermal toughening at the edges, just at<br>
the points where strengthening by the toughening<br>
treatment would in general be expected.<br>
An unusual behavior of glass, when it is cut after<br>
having been treated in a certain way, has now been<br>
discovered.<br>
When the essential parameters of the invention are<br>
achieved, the crack caused by the scoring propagates<br>
all by itself through the treated glazing, that is to<br>
say without it being necessary to apply a breaking<br>
force. Within the scope of the present application, the<br>
term "glazing" has a very general sense, without any<br>
shape limitation, covering all glass-based articles and<br>
in general comprising two generally parallel main<br>
faces, and especially the frames shown in figure 8.<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
According to the invention, it has been discovered that<br>
a glass treated so as to have a K factor of between<br>
0.05 and 0.4 MPa.m.1/2 could be cut without it being<br>
necessary to apply a breaking force, the K factor being<br>
defined by<br>
K = [ I oz2.H(az).dz]1/2 <br>
in which z is a position in the thickness, ơz is the<br>
intensity of the approximately isotropic biaxial stress<br>
at the position z, H(ƠZ) is equal to 1 if ơz is greater<br>
than 0 and is equal to 0 if ơz is less than or equal to<br>
0, with the convention that extension is denoted by<br>
positive values and compression by negative values.<br>
In fact, for such a glass, the subcrack itself<br>
propagates as a crack passing through the thickness of<br>
the glass, even in the absence of a breaking force. It<br>
is necessary for the subcrack to reach that region of<br>
the glazing in extension and to be deeper than 10 μm.<br>
In particular, the invention allows the cutting,<br>
without breaking, of glass sheets of any thickness,<br>
especially less than 500 μm, but also greater than<br>
1.2 mm and even greater than 2.6 mm, thicknesses that<br>
it is not usually known to cut directly by means of a<br>
laser in the case of a glazing unit outside the<br>
invention. The cutting according to the invention also<br>
generally results in an edge that does not cut one's<br>
hand, this being an advantage from the standpoint of<br>
safety. In general, the cutting without breaking<br>
according to the invention is carried out on glass<br>
having a thickness of less than or equal to 5.2 mm.<br>
Thus, the invention relates to a method of cutting a<br>
glazing unit that includes a glass sheet having two<br>
main faces, said method not involving the application<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
of a breaking force, said method comprising the<br>
following steps:<br>
-	application of a treatment to the glass sheet<br>
that generates stresses and at least one region in<br>
compression and at least one region in extension, the<br>
distribution of the stresses being biaxial,<br>
approximately isotropic and self-balanced in its<br>
thickness, said stresses being such that the K factor<br>
is between 0.05 and 0.4 MPa.m1/2;<br>
-	scoring a subcrack deeper than 10 μm along the<br>
desired line of cutting, said subcrack reaching that<br>
region of the glazing in extension.<br>
The stresses giving the glass its property of being<br>
able to be cut without breaking may be conferred on any<br>
type of glass by a suitable treatment, and especially:<br>
-	a chemical toughening treatment or<br>
-	the production of at least one thin layer or<br>
-	the subjection of the glass to approximately<br>
isotropic biaxial bending during the scoring operation.<br>
The first two treatments mentioned above result<br>
intrinsically in an approximately isotropic biaxial<br>
stress distribution. These first two treatments also<br>
result in stresses that are residual after cutting. The<br>
third treatment (subjection to biaxial bending) does<br>
not result in residual stresses after cutting, since<br>
the flexural forces disappear as soon as the glass is<br>
broken.<br>
The treatment gives the glass an approximately<br>
isotropic biaxial stress distribution, which means that<br>
the stresses are exerted in directions parallel to the<br>
glazing and, for a given depth, with approximately the<br>
same intensity in all directions parallel to the<br>
glazing. These biaxial stresses are generally isotropic<br>
in a plane parallel to the glazing. These stresses are<br>
self-balanced in the thickness of the glazing, which<br>
means that the extensional stresses balance out the<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
compressive stresses, which also amounts to saying that<br>
{Ơ(z)dz = 0 in which Ơ(z) represents the stress at the<br>
position z in the thickness of the glazing. The<br>
invention makes it possible to produce a glazing unit<br>
that can be cut according to the invention at any point<br>
whatsoever. Such a glazing unit may have a large<br>
surface, especially greater than 10 cm, or even greater<br>
than 20 cm, or indeed greater than 50 cm or indeed<br>
greater than 1 m in all directions parallel to its main<br>
faces (the case of flat glazing).<br>
Before said treatment, the glass may have no internal<br>
stress. It may especially be a float glass. The glass<br>
may be of any composition, and especially of the soda-<br>
lime type, or it may have one of the compositions<br>
described in FR 97/04508 or WO 96/11887.<br>
If it is chosen to carry out the treatment by chemical<br>
toughening, the glass must contain an alkali metal<br>
oxide. This oxide may be Na20 or Li20 and be present in<br>
the glass in an amount, for example, from 1 to 2 0% by<br>
weight. The chemical toughening treatment consists in<br>
replacing the alkali metal ions initially in the glass<br>
with other, larger alkali metal ions. If the initial<br>
oxide is Na20, a chemical toughening by treatment with<br>
KN03 is applied, so as to at least partly replace Na+<br>
ions with K+ ions. If the initial oxide is Li20, a<br>
chemical toughening by treatment with NaN03 or KN03 is<br>
applied, so as at least partly to replace Li+ ions with<br>
Na* or K+ ions, depending on the case. In particular, if<br>
the treatment is a chemical toughening treatment, the<br>
glass cut according to the invention has a better edge<br>
strength. The toughening may therefore result in a K+<br>
or Na+ ion concentration gradient perpendicular to at<br>
i least one of the main faces and decreasing from said<br>
main face.<br>
To measure the K factor in the glass, the technique of<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
biasographe may be used. This technique is well known<br>
to those skilled in the art, and reference may in<br>
particular be made to the work "Photoelasticity of<br>
glass" by H. Aben and C. Guillemet, Springer-Verlag<br>
1993, page 150.<br>
The technique of biasographe gives a stress intensity<br>
profile, such as for example curve (1) shown in<br>
figure 1, representing the change in the stress Ơ as a<br>
function of the depth in the glass (the x-axis is<br>
perpendicular to the glazing) . All the stresses Ơi<br>
corresponding to a thickness dzi are therefore measured<br>
over the entire curve (1) , the value of dzi being, for<br>
example, 8 μm. In practice, the K factor is then<br>
determined from the formula:<br>
K = (∑Ơi2.dzi)1/2.<br>
The biasographe technique requires access to the edge<br>
of the glazing. To use this technique, it is preferable<br>
for the width of the glazing to be equal to at least<br>
five times its thickness. Other photoelasticity methods<br>
may also be used, such as a stratorefractometer.<br>
To obtain a glazing unit having a K factor of between<br>
0.05 and 0.4 MPa.m1/2, it may be made to undergo<br>
chemical toughening. This chemical toughening must be<br>
carried out for a long enough time and at a high enough<br>
temperature for the K factor to be between 0.05 and<br>
0.4 MPa.m1/2. By routine tests, a person skilled in the<br>
art may find the time and temperature allowing such<br>
values to be obtained. In general, the chemical<br>
toughening is carried out by immersing the glazing unit<br>
to be treated in a hot bath of the chosen salt<br>
(generally NaN03 or KN03) . This bath contains the<br>
concentrated salt. The chemical toughening is generally<br>
carried out between 380°C and 520°C, and in any manner<br>
at a temperature below the softening point of the glass<br>
to be treated. The chemical toughening causes ionic<br><br>
exchange at the surface of the treated glass over a<br>
depth which may possibly range up to, for example,<br>
50 m. This ionic exchange is the cause of alkali metal<br>
ion concentration gradients. In general, this gradient<br>
is characterized by a reduction in the concentration of<br>
ions provided by the chemical toughening (generally K+<br>
or Na+) from the main face toward the core of the<br>
glazing. This gradient exists between the surface and,<br>
for example, a depth of at most 50 m. This gradient is<br>
shown in figure 2 by dots whose density decreases on<br>
moving further towards the inside of the glazing. The<br>
depth of the gradient is exaggerated in the figures in<br>
order to aid comprehension.<br>
The chemically toughened glazing units of the prior<br>
art, given the fact that they are not cut after the<br>
chemical toughening, have the same composition over<br>
their entire surface, including the edge. Figure 2a)<br>
shows in cross section the edge of a glazing unit<br>
chemically treated after cutting. The cut gave rise to<br>
the edge (2) . The scored line of the subcrack (3) is<br>
visible on the edge and shown in figure 2a) by a bolder<br>
line (it will be recalled that a subcrack is always<br>
visible on the cut edge of a glazing unit with the<br>
naked eye if the glazing is thick enough or with a<br>
microscope in the case of excessively thin glazing, for<br>
example with a thickness of less than 500 m) . The<br>
chemical toughening of the glazing after cutting gives<br>
rise to alkali metal ion exchange between the glazing<br>
and the toughening mediμm. This exchange created an<br>
alkali metal ion concentration gradient from the<br>
surface of the glazing toward the inside of the<br>
glazing, this gradient existing from the parallel main<br>
faces ((4) and (5) in figure 2) of the glazing and to a<br>
sufficient distance from the edges (including that<br>
denoted (2)), for example from the point (6) on the<br>
surface of a main face and perpendicular to this face<br>
toward the core of the glazing. This point (6) may<br>
generally be at least 1 mm from the edge. This gradient<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
does not exist along the edge in a direction<br>
perpendicular to the main faces, but it does exist on<br>
the edge in a direction parallel to the main faces of<br>
the glazing and at a sufficient distance from said main<br>
faces.<br>
Figure 2b) shows a glazing unit according to the<br>
invention, which was cut after the chemical toughening<br>
treatment. It will be understood that, in this case,<br>
the edge (2) cut according to the invention has a<br>
composition that varies depending on whether one is<br>
close to or far from the parallel main faces of the<br>
glazing. The surface of the edge cut according to the<br>
invention has a surface concentration gradient of<br>
alkali metal ions between the main face in which the<br>
subcrack was formed and the core of the glazing. This<br>
is in fact the fundamental difference from a glass cut<br>
before being treated by chemical toughening (the case<br>
shown in figure 2a) ) for which this gradient along the<br>
edge does not exist. In the case of the present<br>
invention, the edge cut according to the invention does<br>
have this gradient and has the mark of the subcrack, it<br>
being possible however, for this mark to be removed<br>
subsequently, for example by abrasion or polishing.<br>
Thus, the invention also relates to a glazing unit<br>
having such an edge with no subcrack visible.<br>
If the chemical toughening is carried out in a<br>
potassium nitrate bath, the surface concentration of<br>
potassium ions is a maximum along the edge at the end<br>
of the edge, that is to say at the corner between the<br>
edge and the main face on which the subcrack was<br>
formed. This variation in the surface ion concentration<br>
Cion along the edge is shown schematically by the curve<br>
on the left-hand side of figure 2b). However, this edge<br>
does not have a concentration gradient in a direction<br>
parallel to the main faces of the glazing (the faces<br>
denoted 4) and 5) of figure 2a) ) . The edge having the<br>
subcrack therefore does not have an alkali metal ion<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
concentration in the direction perpendicular to said<br>
edge.<br>
The treatment conferring the stresses on the glass may<br>
also be the application of at least one thin film. The<br>
film must be deposited so that it is in compression at<br>
the moment of scoring. This may in particular be<br>
achieved by hot deposition (generally at between 400<br>
and 700°C) of a film whose expansion coefficient is<br>
less than that of the substrate. The film is then put<br>
into compression during cooling. The cut is then made<br>
after the coated glass has returned to room<br>
temperature. The film may be produced in particular by<br>
sol-gel or screen printing or CVD processes. The film<br>
may also be produced at low temperature by the process<br>
of magnetron sputtering or plasma CVD, and especially<br>
when the film is made of silicon nitride. It is<br>
possible to check that the film is in compression, as<br>
it has a natural tendency to give the coated substrate<br>
convexity, seen from the side with the film.<br>
The film has a thickness allowing the desired stress<br>
intensity factor to be obtained, in general, the film<br>
has a thickness ranging from 1 to 20 urn. Preferably,<br>
the film contains a stress ranging from 200 MPa to<br>
5 GPa, for example about 3 00 MPa. A person skilled in<br>
the art will know how to measure the stress in a film<br>
on the glass. This stress in the film may especially be<br>
measured from the change in the curvature of the glass,<br>
or from the stress that it induces in the glass, this<br>
stress usually being evaluated by photoelasticity.<br>
The film may especially be made of silicon nitride,<br>
silicon  carbonitride,  silicon  carbide,  silicon<br>
oxycarbide, silicon oxycarbonitride, titanium oxide,<br>
titanium nitride, titanium carbonitride,  titanium<br>
carbide, titanium oxycarbide or titanium oxycarbo-<br>
nitride .<br><br>
-li-<br>
lt is also possible to apply a film in compression on<br>
each side of the substrate. When the glass is coated<br>
only on one side with a film in compression, the<br>
scoring may be done on the side with the film. For the<br>
scoring, a force may be applied to the glazing that<br>
tends to reduce the convexity conferred on the coated<br>
glass by the film, but this is not essential. When the<br>
glass is coated on both its faces with a film in<br>
compression, the scoring may be done on one or other of<br>
the faces.<br>
The treatment conferring the stress on the :. glass may<br>
also be the application of an approximately isotropic<br>
biaxial bending force. A suitable biaxial bending force<br>
may be applied by heating the two main faces • of the<br>
glazing to different temperatures and by opposing the<br>
deformation that this temperature difference naturally<br>
tends to induce by applying a force to the glazing. The<br>
scoring is performed, and hence the breaking, as long<br>
as the temperature difference and the force opposing<br>
the deformation exist. In this case, the bending forces<br>
are generated by the combination, on the one hand, of<br>
the application of different temperatures to the main<br>
faces and, on the other hand, of forces opposing the<br>
deformation that the temperature difference induces.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates one embodiment according to this<br>
principle. This figure shows a glazing unit having two<br>
main faces (7) and (8) and a plate (9) having a number<br>
of holes (10) . The glazing unit may be pressed against<br>
the plate since it is sucked against it by suction<br>
being exerted through the holes. The plate is heated to<br>
a different temperature from the starting temperature<br>
of the glazing so that the face (8) has a different<br>
temperature from that of the face (7) . The creation of<br>
this temperature difference between the two faces of<br>
the glazing is why stress is created in the glazing<br>
while it rests pressed against the plate. This is<br>
because if the glazing were left to assume its<br>
equilibrium shape, it would not contain any stress. If<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
the face (8) is hotter than the face (7) , it is the<br>
face {8) that is in compression as long as the glazing<br>
remains pressed. In this case, the scoring may be done<br>
on the face (7) , that is to say the face in extension.<br>
The subcrack on this face therefore immediately reaches<br>
the region in extension and a subcrack of very shallow<br>
depth, while still remaining deeper than 10 m may be<br>
sufficient. If the face (8) is cooler than the face<br>
(7) , it is the latter face that is in compression as<br>
long as the glazing remains pressed. In this case, the<br>
scoring may be done on the face (7), that is to say the<br>
face in compression, in which case, since the subcrack<br>
has to be deeper than the thickness in compression in<br>
order to reach the region in extension, it must be<br>
deeper than half the thickness of the glazing.<br>
In the case of the application of a bending force, the<br>
scoring must be done while said force is being exerted.<br>
The forces applied so as to generate the stress in the<br>
glass are much less than the conventional breaking<br>
forces. For example, for a glazing unit having a<br>
thickness ranging from 0.1 to 5.2 mm, these bending<br>
forces may be between 3 and 70 MPa, extends understood<br>
that the thinner the glazing the higher the force must<br>
be. In general, for glazing having a thickness ranging<br>
from 1 to 5.2 mm, these bending forces may be between 3<br>
and 2 0 MPa. In fact, as soon as the scoring is done,<br>
the subcrack propagates right into the thickness of the<br>
glass and it would be possible to immediately stop the<br>
bending forces just after scoring without this having<br>
any influence on the breaking.<br>
To cut the glass having a suitable K factor without<br>
breaking it, the surface of the glass is scored along a<br>
line corresponding to that of the desired cut. This<br>
scoring results in a subcrack (also called a blind<br>
crack by those skilled in the art) . The scoring may<br>
especially be done using a scoring wheel or by a<br>
diamond or by laser. Usually, and more particularly for<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
glazing having a thickness ranging from 1 to 3 mm,	the<br>
subcrack has a depth of 100 to 1 000 m. Usually,	the<br>
subcrack has a depth of between 10% and 2 0%,	for<br>
example about 15%, of the glazing thickness.<br>
When a scoring wheel or a diamond is used, the scoring<br>
is done with a load sufficient to obtain a sufficient<br>
depth of the subcrack, which must be able to propagate<br>
without the application of a breaking force. When a<br>
scoring wheel or a diamond is used, the scoring is<br>
preferably done under a cutting oil (also called<br>
"petrol" by those skilled in the art) . When a scoring<br>
wheel is used, it is preferable to use a scoring wheel<br>
with a large angle, for example 145°. The angle of the<br>
scoring wheel is the angle a as shown in figure 4. For<br>
a given scoring wheel or diamond, it is also possible<br>
by routine tests to find a load suitable for the<br>
scoring. This is because an insufficient load results<br>
in no fracture, while an excessively high load results<br>
in an uncontrolled fracture, that is to say a fracture<br>
that does not always follow the line of scoring.<br>
When the essential parameters of the invention have<br>
been achieved, the crack caused by the scoring<br>
propagates all by itself through the treated glazing,<br>
that is to say without it being necessary to apply a<br>
breaking force. It is possible to accelerate the<br>
propagation of the crack by at least one of the<br>
following means:<br>
-	with water: a little water may be placed in the<br>
subcrack; to do this, it is possible, for example, to<br>
wet the glazing before cutting, wetting only that part<br>
(typically a few mm) of the glazing corresponding to<br>
the end of the scoring;<br>
-	by increasing the scoring load at the end of<br>
scoring.<br>
The scoring must result in a subcrack. The scoring may<br>
be carried out on a main face of the glazing that is in<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
compression or, if it exists, on a main face of the<br>
glazing that is in extension. When the scoring is<br>
carried out on a main face in compression (especially<br>
in the case of a surface treated by chemical toughening<br>
or by a film in compression) , the subcrack is deeper<br>
than the thickness in compression ec so as to reach the<br>
region in extension. Preferably, especially if the<br>
treatment is a chemical toughening treatment, the<br>
subcrack has a depth of 5 to 20 times the value of the<br>
thickness in compression ec.<br>
In the case of a chemical toughening treatment, the<br>
thickness in compression may be evaluated from the<br>
depth of ion exchange Pe, which may be determined<br>
JTT x Mv x ev x Am<br>
a)	either by Pe = -	—	:	<br>
32 xaxmr<br>
in which:<br>
a represents the initial molar % of alkali metal<br>
oxide in the glass (for example Na20 or Li20) ;<br>
mi represents the total initial mass (before<br>
toughening) of the glass in grams;<br>
Mv represents the molar mass of the glass in<br>
g/mol;<br>
Am represents the rate of uptake of the glass<br>
during toughening in grams; and<br>
ev represents the thickness of the glass in<br>
micrometers,<br>
Pe thus being obtained in micrometers;<br>
b)	or by a microprobe profile, in which case it is<br>
defined by the depth for which the content of ions<br>
provided by the toughening is equal to that of the<br>
glass matrix to within 5%.<br>
In the case of a treatment by formation of a film, the<br>
thickness in compression is equal to the thickness of<br>
the film, provided that the film is in compression and<br>
that no external force deforms the glazing<br>
substantially.<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
In the case of a treatment by the application of<br>
bending forces, if the scoring is carried out on the<br>
side in compression, the thickness in compression is<br>
equal to one half of the thickness of the glazing. In<br>
the case of a treatment by the application of bending<br>
forces, if the scoring is carried out on the side in<br>
extension, the subcrack may be shallower, while still<br>
remaining greater than 10 μm.<br>
The invention makes it possible in particular to cut a<br>
glass sheet having a thickness of at least 0.3 mm, or<br>
at least 0.7 mm, or at least 1.2 mm or greater than<br>
1.5 mm or even at least 2.6 mm, without breaking it. In<br>
general, the glass sheet has a thickness of less than<br>
20 mm, for example at most 5.2 mm. The glazing may in<br>
particular have a thickness ranging from 0.7 mm to<br>
5.2 mm, for example 2.6 to 5.2 mm.<br>
The cutting according to the invention starts by the<br>
scoring of a subcrack on the surface of a glass, and<br>
the propagation of a crack through the entire thickness<br>
of the inorganic part of the glazing that has undergone<br>
the cut is observed. In fact, in the case of a<br>
laminated glazing unit that is the association of at<br>
least two glass sheets placed on either side of a<br>
polymer interlayer, one of the glass sheets being<br>
treated according to the invention and scored according<br>
to the invention, it is clear that the crack propagates<br>
only through the sheet that was scored and not the<br>
other glass sheet lying on the other side of the<br>
polymer interlayer.<br>
The invention also relates to a glazing unit comprising<br>
a glass sheet having two main faces and at least one<br>
edge, said glazing unit having a distribution of<br>
stresses through its thickness, said stresses being<br>
biaxial, approximately isotropic and self-balanced, and<br>
the K factor of which is between 0.05 and 0.4 MPa.m1/2.<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
The invention makes it possible to produce cutting<br>
profiles that the prior art does not allow to be<br>
produced.<br>
According to the invention, it is possible to cut glass<br>
along a curved line with a very small radius of<br>
curvature, and to do so even with a thick glass. At<br>
least at one point along the line of cutting, the<br>
radius of curvature may be less than 4 0 mm, or even<br>
less than 3 0 mm, or even less than 2 0 mm or even less<br>
than 10 mm or even less than 5 mm. In general, the<br>
radius of curvature is greater than 3 mm. Such radii of<br>
curvature of the cutting may be obtained for glazing<br>
with a thickness of even greater than 1 mm, or indeed<br>
greater than 2.6 mm. In general, to produce radii of<br>
curvature of less than 10 mm, it is preferable for the<br>
glazing to have a thickness of less than 5.2 mm, in<br>
particular, it is thus possible to cut magnetic<br>
recording disks, that is to say to make,<br>
simultaneously, their peripheral circular cut and their<br>
central circular hole.<br>
According to the invention, it is possible to make a<br>
cut along a curved line changing in concavity, and even<br>
linking inverse concavities with very small radii of<br>
curvature, such as those that have just been given.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates one form of cut produced on a<br>
glazing unit (11) , said cut having a change of<br>
concavity at the point (12) . Linked to the point (12)<br>
are two curves of different concavity. In figure 5, the<br>
curve on either side of the point (12) has the same<br>
radius of curvature in absolute value, which may be<br>
very small as already explained.<br>
According to the invention, it is possible to cut the<br>
glass over a very small width. A glazing unit generally<br>
has a thickness, a width and a length (at least equal<br>
to the width). In general, the glazing to be cut<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
according to the invention has an approximately-<br>
constant thickness. In general, it is flat. According<br>
to the invention, the width of glazing cut may even be<br>
less than 1.5 times the thickness, and even less than<br>
1.2 times the thickness, and even less than 1 times the<br>
thickness and even less than or equal to 0.7 times the<br>
thickness. In general, the width of glazing cut is<br>
greater than 0.1 times the thickness. Thus, the<br>
invention makes it possible in particular to produce<br>
glass strips of square or rectangular cross section<br>
having the width given above and especially a width of<br>
magnitude similar to that of the thickness or even less<br>
than that of the thickness.<br>
According to the invention, it is possible to cut a<br>
glazing unit along a line of cutting that includes an<br>
angle. This angle may, for example, range from 60° to<br>
120° and in particular be 90°. Remarkably, the cut<br>
results in a piece having a concave angle a1 and a<br>
piece having a convex angle a2 being obtained (see<br>
figure 6) . To do this the cut has not to be the result<br>
of intersection of two different lines of cutting that<br>
meet, said intersection forming the desired angle, the<br>
two lines of cutting being continued beyond their<br>
intersection. To produce the angle according to the<br>
invention, there are two options:<br>
1)	a hole may be made at the point chosen for the<br>
angle before the cutting and then the cutting is<br>
carried out by making two different scored lines that<br>
meet at the site of the hole, the hole possibly having<br>
a diameter of 0.2 to 2 mm for example; or<br>
2)	a hole is not made at the place chosen for the<br>
angle, rather a scored line is made that at every point<br>
satisfies the abovementioned condition as regards the<br>
radius of curvature, which must therefore be at least<br>
3 mm. Thus, the angle is in fact a curve of very small<br>
radius of curvature. It is possible to repeat the<br>
scoring several times provided that the various scored<br>
lines meet so that their tangents coincide at the<br><br>
- 18 -<br>
points of intersection.<br>
If it is desired to do the scoring by hand, it may be<br>
preferable to produce a hole at the place desired for<br>
the angle. If the scoring is done by a machine, a hole<br>
need not be made prior to the scoring provided that the<br>
scoring complies with the minimum radius of curvature<br>
given above. With this type of machine, the tracing is<br>
generally carried out in one single step, that is to<br>
say the scoring object is placed once on the glass and<br>
does not leave it until the end of the scoring.<br>
Figure 6 shows two glazing pieces after the cutting<br>
according to the invention. It may be seen that the cut<br>
has a rounded angle of small radius of curvature<br>
producing, in the two cut parts, two angles that fit<br>
together perfectly. This angle was produced without<br>
forming a hole prior to the cutting. According to the<br>
prior art, it was known how to make 90° angles, but by<br>
the intersection of lines of cutting that cross each<br>
other, that is to say that continue after their point<br>
of intersection. Figure 7 illustrates this way of<br>
cutting ordinary glass according to the prior art, with<br>
lines of cutting (13) traversing the entire surface of<br>
the glazing, and resulting in square or rectangular<br>
pieces (14) . The angles of all the pieces cut in this<br>
way are convex, none of the cut pieces having a concave<br>
angle.<br>
According to the invention, it is possible to cut and<br>
remove a full shape even from the inside of a glass<br>
plate without said cut intersecting the original<br>
external border of the glazing. Thus, a full shape,<br>
whose external border has the shape of the cut, is<br>
removed from the rest of the glazing, which then has an<br>
internal border having the shape of the cut and an<br>
external border remaining unchanged with respect to the<br>
original external border (before cutting). To do this,<br>
the scoring is carried out along a line that joins up<br><br>
- 19 -<br>
with itself without intersecting with the external<br>
border of the glazing and resulting in the cutting, on<br>
the one hand, of a full shape and, on the other hand,<br>
of a holed shape, the external outline of the holed<br>
shape corresponding to the original external outline of<br>
the glazing, the internal outline of the holed shape<br>
corresponding to the external outline of the full<br>
shape. This full shape may be a circle or have a radius<br>
of curvature as already mentioned. Figure 8 illustrates<br>
this possibility. In this figure, a full shape (15) has<br>
been cut from the inside of a plate, which then appears<br>
as a holed shape (16). The external outline of the full<br>
shape corresponds to the internal outline (17) of the<br>
holed shape. The external outline (18) of the holed<br>
shape is the same as the original plate before cutting.<br>
The full shape may be a circle or may include a small<br>
radius of curvature, as already mentioned. The full<br>
shape may also include one or more angles as already<br>
mentioned, it being understood that these angles have<br>
to be made according to the abovementioned conditions,<br>
that is to say with the formation of a hole prior to<br>
the cutting or without the prior formation of a hole,<br>
but by the scoring complying with a minimum radius of<br>
curvature of 3 mm. Thus, a full shape may be cut with a<br>
polygonal outline. In particular, the polygonal shape<br>
may include three, four, five or six angles, or even<br>
more. Thus, it is possible to cut a full shape having<br>
the shape of a square or rectangle after having made a<br>
cut with four 90° angles (this is the case for the cut<br>
shape shown in figure 8). The holed shape therefore has<br>
the shape of a frame, said frame shape having an<br>
internal border of square or rectangular shape and an<br>
external border of square or rectangular shape. This<br>
frame also has a cross section of square or rectangular<br>
shape. The holed shape (or frame) thus obtained is<br>
especially applicable as an insert piece between two<br>
glazing units, such as in flat FED (field emission<br>
display) screens. The holed shape may have a very small<br>
edge width ((19) in figure 8), that is to say one<br><br>
- 20 -<br>
corresponding to what was already mentioned as regards<br>
thin strips. The full shape may be separated from the<br>
holed shape, preferably by extraction from that side<br>
with the initial scoring. The full shape may generally<br>
be extracted by hand. To make extraction easier,<br>
especially for greater glazing thicknesses, a thermal<br>
extraction operation may also be carried out, which<br>
consists in heating (for example to between 90 and<br>
220°C) firstly the entire cut glazing, but for which<br>
the full shape and the holed shape have not yet been<br>
separated, and then secondly the central part of the<br>
glazing comprising the full shape to be extracted is<br>
cooled. The contraction caused by the cooling allows<br>
the full shape to be more easily extracted.<br>
The cutting according to the invention may be carried<br>
out by scoring the surface of a glass sheet treated in<br>
accordance with the invention (chemical, film, or<br>
bending treatment), said sheet forming part of a<br>
laminated glazing unit. In this case, the crack caused<br>
by the scoring propagates through the thickness of the<br>
treated sheet and stops at the polymer interlayer<br>
usually placed between the sheets of a laminated<br>
glazing unit. In this way, a multitude of parallel<br>
linear cracks may be produced through the treated sheet<br>
of the laminated glazing unit, passing through said<br>
sheet as far as the polymer interlayer. The cracks thus<br>
created act as mirrors for light passing through the<br>
glazing. The aesthetically attractive glazing thus<br>
obtained may serve as a light deflector. Figure 9<br>
illustrates this application. It shows that the light<br>
rays (20) are reflected at the interfaces (21) of the<br>
cracks created in accordance with the invention through<br>
the treated sheet (22) of the laminated glazing unit<br>
(2 3) comprising the combination of two glass sheets<br>
separated by a polymer layer (24). In this application,<br>
the cracks may be separated from one another by a<br>
distance of, for example, 2 mm to 10 mm. In general, it<br>
is desirable for the distance between two cracks to<br><br>
- 21 -<br>
represent 4 0 to 80% of the thickness of the cracked<br>
sheet.<br>
Of course, it is also possible to carry out<br>
conventional cutting, that is to say passing through<br>
the entire surface of the glazing, in order to cut<br>
square or rectangular shapes. Pieces of this type may<br>
serve as protective glazing for LCD (liquid-crystal<br>
display) cells.<br>
The present invention, particularly when it involves a<br>
chemical toughening treatment, is very beneficial for<br>
the cutting of glazing in the electronic field. This<br>
chemical toughening technique is particularly<br>
applicable to glass capable of ion exchange, as is the<br>
case in electronics for glass having in particular a<br>
high strain point, for example CS77 glass sold by<br>
Saint-Gobain Glass France. The composition of such<br>
glass is described, for example, in EP 0 914 299. The<br>
cutting technique is therefore applicable in lines for<br>
the manufacture of accessories for electronics (such as<br>
spacers or inserts) , of screens (plasma, LCD, TFT, FED<br>
screen) and of field emission displays, and in lines<br>
for manufacturing vacuum glazing. The use of chemical<br>
toughening gives the edges, especially the cut edges,<br>
high mechanical strength. With the cutting techniques<br>
of the prior art, it is necessary for the components to<br>
be brought into contact with the surface of the glass<br>
and to be held thereon, for the scoring and/or<br>
breaking, in order to cut the glass. This is a drawback<br>
if a surface of the glass has already received<br>
printing, as any contact with this printing may damage<br>
it. Thanks to the technique according to the invention,<br>
and more particularly when it employs chemical<br>
toughening, it is therefore possible to print the glass<br>
after the stress-generating treatment and then to cut<br>
it with the minimum of contact with components. In<br>
particular, it is therefore possible to produce a<br>
motherglass, to print patterns on the surface and then<br><br>
- 22 -<br>
to carry out the manufacturing cycles in order only<br>
thereafter to cut each screen (telephone, palmtop or<br>
portable computer screen).<br>
All the examples start with the chemical toughening of<br>
a glass plate, produced as follows, the essential<br>
parameters of said toughening (time and temperature)<br>
being given in table 1. The starting glasses used were<br>
the following:<br>
CS77: glass sold by Saint-Gobain Glass France;<br>
Px: glass of the PLANILUX brand sold by Saint-<br>
Gobain Glass France;<br>
C0211: glass sold by Corning.<br>
Chemical toughening for the examples<br>
A flat glass with the dimensions 300 x 200 x e mm was<br>
taken, "e" representing the thickness that was<br>
toughened in a potassium nitrate bath at a temperature<br>
T for a time "t". The treatments produced core stresses<br>
in the sheet.<br>
Cutting principle for the examples<br>
The glass plates were cut, using a diamond or a scoring<br>
wheel, into various cut shapes corresponding to various<br>
applications. The cuts using a scoring wheel were all<br>
made according to the principle below. The scoring was<br>
done with a scoring wheel of the VITRUM brand sold by<br>
Adler, said scoring wheel having an angle of 145° and a<br>
diameter of 5 mm with cutting fluid and with a load so<br>
that the subcrack is deeper than the exchange depth Pa.<br>
For the examples illustrating the invention, it was<br>
noticed that the subcrack propagated through the entire<br>
thickness of the glass without it being necessary to<br>
apply a breaking force (see the "propagation" line in<br>
table 1) . In certain cases, the propagation was<br>
initiated at the end of the scored line by adding<br><br>
- 23 -<br>
water, which penetrated by capillary effect into the<br>
subcrack. In other cases, the propagation was initiated<br>
by increasing the load at the end of the scored line.<br>
For all the examples, the K factor in the glass was<br>
measured by a biasographe on glass strips 10 mm in<br>
width, except in the case of examples 5 and 6 for which<br>
the glass strips were 3 mm in width.<br>
In table 1, the following expressions and abbreviations<br>
are used:<br>
-	Pe: ion exchange depth,-<br>
-	∆ load: increase in load;<br>
-	Propagation and type: it was judged whether the<br>
crack propagation proceeded correctly (guided<br>
propagation) or whether it was uncontrolled, which<br>
means that the glass does not break along the line of<br>
scoring, or whether it does not occur, which means that<br>
in the end the glass has not broken.<br>
Examples 1 and 2: frames<br>
Before the chemical toughening treatment, four holes<br>
1 mm in diameter were produced in the corners of the<br>
plate with a diamond drill bit, said holes being placed<br>
4 mm from the edges of said plate. After the chemical<br>
toughening treatment, the plate was cut along straight<br>
lines parallel to the edges of the plate and between<br>
the holes, so as to draw a frame. The glass rectangle<br>
between the holes could be extracted so as to recover a<br>
frame (see figure 8).<br>
Example 3; daylight reflection<br>
A laminated glazing unit was produced with, on the one<br>
hand, the chemically treated plate and, on the other<br>
hand, a pane of ordinary soda-lime glass (not<br>
chemically treated) 2 mm in thickness, placing between<br>
them, in the conventional manner, a film of polyvinyl<br>
butyral (PVB).<br><br>
- 24 -<br>
After one end of the glazing unit had been immersed in<br>
water (to about'5 mm), a first series of straight and<br>
parallel scored lines was produced by the scoring wheel<br>
on that side of the glazing that was chemically<br>
toughened, said scored lines being separated from one<br>
another by 8 mm and finishing at the edge immersed in<br>
water. The water plays its role by initiating the<br>
propagation of each crack. A second series of scored<br>
lines was then produced, between the scored lines of<br>
the first series, so that in the end the plate had<br>
scored lines approximately every 4 mm. It was noted<br>
that all the cracks caused by the scored lines<br>
propagated as far as the PVB film, that is to say they<br>
passed through the entire thickness of the chemically<br>
toughened glass pane. The glazing unit could then act<br>
as a reflector for light passing through it, thanks to<br>
the mirror effect of each of the cracks (see figure 9).<br>
Example 4: cutting a circle<br>
A circle 60 mm in diameter was cut in the chemically<br>
toughened glass using a scoring wheel of the VITRUM<br>
brand sold by Adler, said scoring wheel having an angle<br>
of 145° and a diameter of 5 mm and said scoring wheel<br>
being mounted on a circular glass cutter with a handle,<br>
having the reference Bohle 530.0 section 1.19. The<br>
glass disk could be extracted by thermal extraction<br>
without either the disk or the rest of the plate<br>
breaking.<br>
Example 5: cutting film glass<br>
Using a diamond, a glass sheet 300 urn in thickness was<br>
cut after it had been chemically toughened, without<br>
initiation, either with water or by a load increase.<br>
The cut is made easily along the scored line without<br>
uncontrolled breaking. The K factor in the glass was<br>
measured by a biasographe on strips 3 mm in width.<br><br>
- 25 -<br>
Example 6: (comparative example)<br>
The procedure was as in the case of example 5, except<br>
that the chemical toughening was carried out so that<br>
the K factor reached the value mentioned in table 1.<br>
Examples 7 to 9 (comparative examples)<br>
The procedure was as in the case of example 2, except<br>
that the chemical toughening was carried out so that<br>
the K factor reached the value mentioned in table 1.<br><br><br>
