				<td>This invention relates to a foldable lantern cum lamp. BACKGROUND<br>
Lanterns and lamps are available in the market separately. The known lantern consists of a base, a spring-loaded hood having holes, the base and the hood are connected by a hollow arm so that the air through the hood passes through the said hollow arms to the base where Kerosene (fuel) is stored. On the top of the base a burner is provided with supports for the chimney. These known lamps or lanterns work because the air goes into the tank through the supporting arms and the wick soaked in the kerosene burns. The known lantern can not be converted into lamp and is not foldable.<br>
It is the object of this invention to provide foldable lantern cum lamp.<br>
To achieve the said objective this invention provides a foldable lantern cum lamp comprising:<br>
a spring-loaded hood portion having a handle,<br>
a base portion having a burner on its top for storing the fuel,<br>
the said burner having holes at its bottom for circulation of air in<br>
	the lantern/lamp,<br>
      the said hood portion and the base portion are provided with preferably hexagonal plates,<br>
-the said hood portion and the base portion are connected with supporting means through the said hexagonal plates,<br>
-a chimney is provided between the burner and the hood without any support.<br>
-the arrangement between the hood and the base is such that when the supporting means and the hood are removed, it acts as a lamp and when the supporting means and the hood are there it forms a lantern.<br>
The said supporting means are semi-circular solid rods and are connected by nut bolts with the said hexagonal plates and the shape of the said rods are such that it will not obstruct the chimney to be inserted.<br>
2<br><br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig 1 shows the known lantern available in the market.<br>
Fig 2 shown the lantern cum lamp, according to this invention.<br>
Fig 3 shows the lamp when the supporting means and the hood are removed.<br>
Referring to the drawings, in figure 1 the known lantern is shown. It has base (B), hood (H) and the supporting hollow arms (A). The hood has holes (H3 &amp; H4). The burner (Bl), which is placed on the base is having holes on the top so that the air coming through the supporting arms goes to the base where the fuel is stored and then comes out through the holes in the burner so that the air circulation is maintained and the lantern remains lighted. The known lamps have handle (HI).<br>
Figure 2 shows the lantern according to this invention. The Lantern according to this invention consists of a spring loaded hood (H) having holes (H3 &amp; H4). The said hood (H) is provided with a handle (H1). The said hood (H) has a hexagonal plate (HP1). The said lantern has base (B) for storing fuel. On the top of the said base, burner (Bl) is provided with holes (H2) at its bottom. The said base (B) is also provided with a hexagonal plate (HP2). The base has also an inlet (I) for filling the fuel. The hood (H) and the base (B) are connected by supporting means SM through the said hexagonalplate (HP1) and (HP2) with nuts and bolts (NB1). These supporting means SMpiand the hood (H) are removable to make the lantern foldable. Further, if the supporting means (SM) and the hood (H) are removed, the lantern becomes a lamp. The said supporting means (SM) are solid rods.<br>
It may thus be seen from the known invention and the instant invention that the supporting means connected between the hood and the base are solid rods and no air passes through the said supporting rods as in the known lantern. Further, the burner in the instant invention has holes at its bottom surface so that the air circulation in the lantern or the lamp is maintained through these holes.<br>
ADVANTAGES:<br>
When a person requires more light, he can convert the lantern into a lamp and when a person is walking outside the house or in the wind, he can make the lamp to lantern and easily move in the wind.<br>
3<br><br>
claim:<br>
1.	A foldable lantern cum lamp comprising:<br>
a spring-loaded hood portion having a handle,<br>
a base portion having a burner on its top for storing the fuel,<br>
 -      the said burner having holes at its bottom for circulation of air in the<br>
	lantern/lamp<br>
 -      the said hood portion  and the base portion  are provided with<br>
	preferably hexagonal plates,<br>
      -      the said hood portion and the base portion are connected with supporting means through the said hexagonal plates,<br>
a chimney is provided between the burner and the hood without any<br>
	support.<br>
 - the arrangement between the hood and the base is such that when the supporting means and the hood are removed, it acts as a lamp and when the supporting means and the hood are there it forms a lantern.<br>
2.	Afoldable  lantern cum lamp as claimed in claim 1 wherein the said<br>
supporting means are semi-circular solid rods and are connected by nut<br>
 bolts with the said hexagonal plates and the shape of the said rods are such    that it will not obstruct the chimney to be inserted.<br>
3.	A fobldable antern cum lamp as claimed in claim 1 wherein the said burner<br>
has holes at its bottom for providing air circulation in the lamp/ lantern.<br>
4.	A foldable  lantern cum lamp as claimed in claim 2 wherein three semi<br>
circular solid rods are used.<br>
4<br>
5.	Afoldable lantern cum lamp substantially as herein described with<br>
reference to and as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
This invention relates to a foldable lantern cum lamp comprising:<br>
-a spring-loaded hood portion having a handle,<br>
-a base portion having a burner on its top for storing the fuel,<br>
-the said burner having holes at its bottom for circulation of air in the lantern/lamp.<br>
-the  said hood portion  and the  base  portion  are  provided with preferably hexagonal plates,<br>
-the said hood portion and the base portion are connected with supporting means through the said hexagonal plates,<br>
-a chimney is provided between the burner and the hood without any support.<br><br>
-the arrangement between the hood and the base is such that when the supporting means and the hood are removed, it acts as a lamp and when the supporting means and the hood are there it forms a lantern.<br></td>
