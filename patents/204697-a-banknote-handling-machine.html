COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13] "A BANKNOTE HANDLING MACHINE"<br>
NYBOHOV   DEVELOPMENT   AB,   P.O.   Box   47041,   S-10074,   S-10074 Stockholm, Sweden,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to banknote handling machine of the kind comprising a machine which is closed when in operation and which includes a unit for receiving banknotes fed externally into the machine, a unit for checking the  validity, quality and denomination of deposited banknotes, and a unit for bundling and encasing or packaging checked banknotes. The banknote encasing means is adapted to encase banknotes to provide a closed package in a manner which effectively makes it difficult to unnoticeably re-close a banknote package which has been sealed in the equipment and then broken open. The equipment also includes means for printing information that discloses the contents of the pa'ckage with respect to each bundling/encasing function.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Equipment of the aforedescribed kind is known to the art. See for instance U.S. Patent Specifications 5,031,379 and 5,468,941 in this respect. The ever increasing risk of  robbery and burglary in conjunction with money handling' procedures in general and handling of banknotes in particular makes it necessary to improve earlier known methods, apparatus and equipment with the intention of reducing the incitement to criminal activities in this respect. The present invention endeavours to provide an improvement in earlier known banknote handling equipment of a given kind.<br>
SUMMARY OF TEE INVENTION<br>
In the case of banknote handling equipment of the aforedescribed kind, the printing device is adapted to print information disclosing the contents of a closed and sealed banknote package in mirror image on the inside of transparent encasement material intended for encasing banknotes to form a  closed package so that information relating to the closed<br><br>
package will be the right side up, durable and visible from outside said package. This is believed to considerably reduce the possibility of resealing a package of banknotes in a man¬ner that cannot be noticed, or of manipulating the informa¬tion.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The invention will now be described in more detail with<br>
reference to the accompanying schematic drawings, in which<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a banknote handling machine according to<br>
the invention;<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates in slightly larger scale a unit for<br>
storing and encasing banknotes and included in the machine<br>
shown in Fig. 1; and<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates an encasement mechanism included in the<br>
machine shown in Fig. 1.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The inventive banknote handling machine has an infeed part 1 and an outfeed part 2. The infeed part 1 includes a deposit compartment 10, a detector means 11, a process unit 12, a conveyor path 13', 13", 13, first storage means 14, second storage means 15, first stacker means 16, second stacker means 17 and an encasement or packaging unit 18.<br>
When banknotes are deposited, a bundle of banknotes, optionally of different denominations, are placed in the deposit compartment 10, which can accommodate up to 500 banknotes. These banknotes are separated one after the other, and moved along an upper conveyor path 13', past the detector means 11 and up to a guide means (direction changing means) 13", which leads the banknotes down to a lower conveyor path 13.<br>
The detector means means 11 is placed in the close proximity of the deposit compartment 10 and is adapted to sort out any<br><br>
non-genuine banknotes, banknotes of poor quality, and other banknotes. By sorting is meant here that passing banknotes are "marked" in some way so that they can be treated as "possibly non-genuine" banknotes, banknotes of "poor" quality, or as accepted banknotes during their subsequent transportation.<br>
The storage device 14, and also a plurality of other similar storage devices in the machine, includes two belts between which banknotes are stored, a storage 141 and two unreeling drums 142 and 143. The leading edge of a banknote arriving at the device activates a sensor 144 which therewith starts three motors each of which drives a respective drum 141-143. The banknote is drawn about 120 mm in between the belts and the belts are wound up on the storage drum 141, which has room for about 500 banknotes. Information relating to the banknotes is sent to the process unit 12 as the belts are coiled onto the storage drum. This enables an account to be kept of the sequence between the banknotes. Banknotes are taken from the device 14, by sending pulses to the motors which cause the drums to rotate in opposite directions.<br>
A manipulator 19 provided along the conveyor path close to the storage devices 14, 15 functions to correct the positions of any banknotes that may have been twisted or displaced laterally during their transportation.<br>
The stacker devices 16, 17 each include a so-called stacker wheel which bundles together mutually sequential banknotes fed in to a storage compartment. When the bundle contains an intended number of banknotes, the bundle is clamped by a pair of arms and fed down to the encasing unit or packaging 18.<br>
The encasing unit 18 includes two rollers that carry encasing material (plastic). A banknote bundle to be encased, or packaged, is pulled down into a pocket that includes plastic<br><br>
strips of mutually the same length and width, one from each roller. The plastic strips are pressed together around the bundle and welded together along their edges with the aid of a Teflon®-coated heating wire. The reader is referred to U.S. Patent specification 5,031,379 for a more detailed explanation of this known technique.<br>
The process unit 12 controls transportation of poor-quality banknotes along the conveyor path 13 to a unit 16-18 for storing and encasing these banknotes. This unit comprises the stacker device 16 and the encasing device 18.<br>
The process unit 12 also controls the transportation of at least some of the remaining genuine and accepted banknotes to unit 14-17-18 for storing and encasing these banknotes in denominational order. This unit is comprised of the storage device 14, the stacker device 17 and the encasing unit 18.<br>
The manner in which the process unit 12 controls the passage of banknotes along different parts of the conveyor path 13 to different destinations with the aid of path selectors, detectors, sensors, etc., is well known to the art and will not therefore be described in more detail here.<br>
Any non-genuine (false) banknotes detected in the detector device 11 may be transported, for instance, to the stacker device 16 and then to the encasing unit 18 in which they are encased or packaged and in which there is dispensed automa¬tically a receipt on which the number of banknotes, the date, etc., is written together with information showing who has deposited the banknotes, e.g. through an account number. This enables the source of false or suspect banknotes to be investigated.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the stacker device 16 and the encasing device 18 in modes in which a unit 16-18 stores and encases any false<br><br>
banknotes. A printing device 181 is provided for mirror-image printing of information relating to customers and any detected false banknotes (possibly several banknotes) directly onto the inner surface of the encasing material (the plastic strip) 180. The process unit 12 controls the transportation of the banknote (banknotes) and the printing of said information. Thus, if several suspect banknotes are detected on one and the same infeed occasion, these banknotes will be collected in one and the same package on which durable information relating to the contents of the package is printed.<br>
Naturally, the printing procedure will be the same for genuine and accepted banknotes, these banknotes being transported to unit 14-17-18 for storage and encasement as earlier mentioned.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the actual packaging mechanism, which includes the rolls 182, 183 carrying said plastic or packaging material 184. The ends of the packaging material taken from the two rolls are welded together at 184 (after a preceding packaging operation) and form the bottom of a disposable cassette or encasement for receiving a banknote (banknotes) fed down from above. The printing device 181 is mounted above and close to the roll 182, with the printing head 1811 of said device close to a guide roller 186 and at the upper side of the plastic material 184, this side thus being the inside of the cassette or encasement when a banknote (banknotes) is fed down from above between two lengths of plastic, one from each roll, whereafter these lengths are then welded together to form a closed cassette or encasement. It is thus important that the print is applied close to the weld join 185.<br><br>
