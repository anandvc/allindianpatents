STRUCTURE FOR A BOARD GAME<br>
The present invention refers to a structure for a board game, allowing the development of highly attractive game, with the participation of two competing players.<br>
The structure of the invention is designed for the development of a game with simple rules, which can be played by anyone, and which at the same time constitutes a game allowing each player to apply developmental techniques to achieve, on one hand, the highest possible score, and on the other, to obstruct or create barriers for the other player, to prevent the attainment of points.<br>
The game of the invention comprises a support having an infinity of recesses dimensioned for housing in each one of them a game piece, the game being based on the placement by the player of the largest number of game piece alignments, in a preset number, for example four.<br>
According to the invention, the structure serving as a base for the development of the game comprises a regular geometrically shaped body, with a vertical axis of symmetry. This body is horizontally subdivided into independent levels, which can rotate about a shaft coinciding with the vertical axis of symmetry, these levels having equal recesses on the their side surface, in each one of which recesses a game piece of the same contour can be coupled.<br>
The geometrically shaped body defining the support for the development of the game can adopt, for example, a pyramidal, frustoconical, cylindrical, prismatic, shape, etc., and generally any geometric shape with a vertical axis of symmetry.<br>
Preferably all the levels will be of equal height, and the recesses will be arranged in horizontal alignment on the side surface thereof. The side surface of each level will be of a height slightly exceeding the diameter of the recesses, such that on each level there is a horizontal alignment of recesses.<br>
The body forming the support of the game can be extended in the lower portion, under the lower level, into a base or hollow pedestal which laterally opens to the exterior through opposing surfaces, through which two extractive drawers are coupled which are intended for containing the game pieces.<br>
As indicated, the game is based on achieving the alignment of the preset number of game pieces, for example four, the greatest amount of times possible, this alignment being able to run horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Rather than this alignment, the game can consist of creating a certain geometric drawing by means of the game pieces. At the same time that each player tries to achieve the greatest<br><br>
possible number of combinations, he or she must try to prevent the opponent from being able to achieve such alignments or drawings.<br>
In order to be able to distinguish the game pieces of either player, these game pieces will have two different colors, each player choosing one of these colors. Furthermore, each game piece can include on one of its sides an indication corresponding to the score obtained by placing this game piece and completing an alignment or the geometric drawing to be made therewith.<br>
Each player will place the game pieces such that he or she can achieve the alignment or geometric drawing sought after. On the other hand, he or she must try to arrange his or her game pieces such that they block the other player from obtaining an alignment of consecutive game pieces.<br>
The game can be played under different rules and introducing different levels of difficulty, which can further be increased by means of the rotational possibility of each level, with regard to the adjacent rotations, once certain conditions have been complied with, the rotational possibility of each level furthermore being variable.<br>
In order to more easily understand the constitution of the structure of the invention, as well as the possibilities of the development of play therewith, a more detailed description of the structure will be made below with the aid of the attached drawings, in which a non-limiting embodiment is shown.<br>
In the drawings:<br>
Figure 1 shows a perspective view of a structure for a board game, constituted according to the invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows a vertical sectional view of the structure of Figure 1.<br>
Figure 3 shows a perspective view of the structure of Figure 1, with the lower level rotated 90Â° with regard to the lower base and the adjacent upper level.<br>
The structure of the invention comprises a regular geometrically shaped support or body with a vertical axis of symmetry which, in the example shown in the drawings, adopts a regular quadrangular pyramidal shape. This pyramidal body is horizontally subdivided into levels indicated with reference numbers 1 to 6, all of them being of the same height. As can be understood, the number of levels can be different, and the height can also vary among them.<br>
Each one of these levels has recesses 7 on their side surface, the number of these recesses on the surfaces of each level varying, increasing from the upper level 1, including only one recess, to the lower level 6, including eleven recesses. The side<br><br>
surface of each level will be of a sufficient height so that a horizontal alignment of recesses 7 can be arranged on each side.<br>
The body with the described constitution can be assembled on a lower hollow base or pedestal 8, open on two of its opposing sides, through which two drawers 9 can be coupled for placing the game pieces 10 and 11.<br>
The game pieces 10 and 11 contained in the two drawers, each one of them intended for a player, can be of different colors. Furthermore, these came pieces can include an indication or score for the development of the game on one of their sides or surfaces.<br>
As can be seen in Figure 2, the different levels 1 to 6 are assembled on a shaft 12, with independent rotation ability with regard thereto, this shaft 12 coinciding with the axis of symmetry of the pyramid. To allow the rotation, each one of the levels can include a bushing 13 and a washer 14, which will ensure the successive support of the different levels through these components, such that the rotation of each level with regard to the adjacent levels can be easily carried out.<br>
The shaft 12 can be anchored at one of its ends to the upper level or apex 1 and fixed to the base 8 through a nut 15.<br>
With this constitution, during the development of the game, any of the levels, for example the level with reference number 6 in Figure 3, can be rotated a certain angle, for example 90Â°, with regard to the base 8 and/or adjacent levels.<br>
As has already been indicated, the described structure allows the development of a game in which the aim is to arrange a certain number of game pieces of each player forming a certain composition, which furthermore can be an impediment, in a certain path, for the formation of said composition by the opposing player.<br>
By means of numbering of the different surfaces, the rotational possibility of the levels, etc., different manners of development and degrees of difficulty in the game can be introduced.<br>
Although in the described example the structure is pyramidal shaped, the structure could adopt any other geometric shape with a vertical axis of symmetry, for example a conical, cylindrical, prismatic shape, etc., in all cases the geometric body being horizontally divided into levels, which bear the recesses 7 on their side surfaces for the placement of the game pieces.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
CLAIMS<br>
1.- A structure for a board game, comprising a body with a pyramidal shape having a regular quadrangular base and with a vertical axis of symmetry, which body is horizontally subdivided into independent levels (1-6), which are rotational about a shaft (12) coinciding with the vertical axis of symmetry, each of said levels having four side surfaces and having, in said side surfaces, a plurality of equal recesses (7), in each one of which recesses a game piece of an equal contour (10-11) can be coupled,<br>
characterized in that<br>
the upper level (1), which constitutes the vertex of the pyramidal body, has one recess (7) in each of its side surfaces;<br>
and in that each one of said levels (1-6) has recesses (7) on their side surfaces, the number of said recesses on the surfaces of each level varying, increasing frm the upper level (1), including only one recess, to the lower level (6), including eleven recesses.<br>
