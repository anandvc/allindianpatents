				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to an indolinone compound useful to treat depression and/or anxiety.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Throughout this application, various publications are referenced in parentheses by author and year. Full citations for these references may be found at the end of the specification immediately preceding the claims. The disclosures of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application to describe more fully the art to which this invention pertains.<br>
Depression is the most common of mental disorders and yet is often underdiagnosed and undertreated, inflicting substantial morbidity and psychosocial impairment on its sufferers. Depression is mainly characterized by sadness, flatness, loss of feeling, anhedonia (lack of pleasure), tearfulness, .agitation or retardation, thoughts of guilt, and worthlessness; m severe cases, suicide, hallucinations and delusions.<br>
Depression can be mainly categorized into bipolar disorders, identifying wide swings of mood; major depressive illness, marked by severe depressive symptoms but without manic swings; and less defined milder forms of bipolar and major depression that fall short of the specific diagnostic criteria e.g. dysthymic disorder (formerly called depressive neurosis). The symptomatology and diagnostic criteria for depression are<br>
set out in the DSMIV guidelines (American Psychiatric Association (1994) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders). Although many patients have single episodes of major depressive illness, the condition also can be repetitive, and this recurrent condition is frequently called unipolar depressive illness .<br>
The key features of depressive illness are a markedly gloomy mood in which there is a loss of interest in life, and general feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness. Depressive symptoms range in severity from mild mood swings to severe delusions about self-worth, accomplishments, and the future.<br>
The "blackness" of the presentation in the depressed patient is most often accompanied by severe motor retardation with profound sleep and appetite disturbance and suicidal ideation. Furthermore, depressive illness can also present in a highly anxious or agitated state.<br>
The degree to which the underlying brain mechanisms in anxiety and depression differ or overlap remains unknown. The  fact,  however,  that  to  some  extent  the  same neurotransmitter systems are involved in depression and anxiety does not mean that the mechanisms are identical. However, the majority of people in an episode of either depression or anxiety also meet criteria for at least one other psychiatric disorder.   But by far the strongest comorbidities in both cases are between depression and anxiety disorders. Therefore, it is now becoming common clinical  practice  to  treat  both  indications  with antidepressants such as SSRIs.<br>
The key clinical features of anxiety disorders relate to various combinations of psychological and physical manifestations of anxiety, not attributable to real danger and occurring either in attacks (panic disorder -PD) or as a persisting state (generalized anxiety disorder -GAD). Other neurotic features may be present (obsessional or hysterical symptoms) but do not dominate the clinical picture.<br>
The Pathophysiology of Depression<br>
Theories underlying the pathophysiology of depression have developed from several lines of evidence including: 1) changes in neurotransmitter monoamine levels,-2)endocrine imbalance; and 3) electrophysiological studies on sleep functions.<br>
Evidence implicating the role of neurotransmitters  in depression,  in  particular  the  monoamines  serotonin, noradrenaline  and  dopamine,  include  the  success  of pharmacological agents in treating depressive disorders. Many of the tricylic antidepressants  (TCAs), selective serotonin  re-uptake  inhibitors  (SSRIs)  and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) effective in the treatment of depression   increase    the   availability   of    the catecholamines    (noradrenaline   and   dopamine)    and indolamines  (serotonin)  in the central nervous  system (CNS) .  The clinical efficacy of these agents has given rise  to  the  catecholamine-indolamine  hypothesis  of depression.  This theory postulates that a certain level of amines and/or receptor sensitivity to catecholamines functions  to  generate  a  normal  mood.  A  receptor<br>
insensitivity, a depletion of monoamines, or a decrease in their release, synthesis or storage have been postulated to lead to depression.<br>
Current Treatments for Depression<br>
A variety of pharmacological agents have been employed to treat depression based on the catecholamine-indolamine hypothesis of depression. Drugs used to treat depression include MAOIs, atypical antipsychotics, lithium, TCAs, and SSRIs. In addition, a number of off-label agents such as antiepileptics are used to treat depression in treatment-resistant patients.<br>
Tricyclic antidepressants are about equal  to SSRIs in effectiveness   against   depression   thus   providing supporting  evidence  for  the  catecholamine-indolamine hypothesis of depression.  However,  SSRIs  have largely displaced TCAs because of side effects associated with TCAs  and  the  need  to  monitor  EKG  and  plasma  drug concentration.  Although  the  SSRIs  are  viewed  as  an improvement  over  other  antidepressants,  they are  not without  their  clinical  problems.  Adverse  effects  on sexual  function,  primarily  anorgasmia  and  delayed ejaculation,  have  been  consistently  reported.  Other, common  side-effects  include sleep  disorders,  yawning, weight changes, suicidal ideation and extrapyramidal-like side-effects  such  as  dystonic  reactions.  Thus,  there clearly remains a medical need for new treatments  of depression,  without the adverse side-effect profile of existing agents and with improved efficacy.<br>
Current treatments for anxiety<br>
There is now considerable direct evidence for the efficacy of the SSRIs both in depression and in anxiety disorders.<br>
Of the current SSRIs approved for marketing in the USA all have shown sufficient efficacy to be further approved for the treatment of at least one anxiety disorder, for example; obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Compounds such as paroxetine and sertraline are also indicated for the treatment of panic disorder (PD).<br>
However, it is clear from the issues raised earlier relating to the efficacy and side- effect profile of SSRIs and for that matter the more widely prescribed benzodiazapines, there still exists a real medical need for novel approaches for the treatment of anxiety and depression.<br>
Discovery Of GAL3  Receptor  Subtype And  Its Role  In Depression and Anxiety<br>
The investigations leading to the present invention arose from the discovery that mRNA for the GAL3 receptor is localized to areas of the rat brain associated with mood and emotion (see PCT International Publication No. WO 98/15570, published April 16, 1998), thus supporting the expression of GAL3 in those regions. Protein for the GAL3 receptor is also shown to localize to areas of the rat brain associated with mood and emotion (see Table 11 and discussion herein).<br>
This  discovery  led  to  the  hypothesis  that  the  GAL3 receptor may play a role in controlling the activity of catecholamine and indolamine neurons in the CNS. Galanin is   known   to   hyperpolarize   neurons,    including monoaminergic neurons (Seutin, et ai. , 1989) and to have inhibitory effects on 5-HT neurons  (Xu, et al., 1998), and dopamine neurons (Gopalan, et al. , 1993; De Weille, et al . , 198S; Jansson, et al. , 1989; Nordstrom, et al . , 1987; Weiss, et al., 1998).  In light of these reports, a series of m vivo behavioral experiments were carried out to evaluate the antidepressant properties of a selective GAL3 receptor antagonist.  The rat Forced Swim Test and the rat Social Interaction Test were employed to evaluate the use of selective GAL3 receptor antagonists to treat depression and anxiety. These models are considered by experts in the field to reflect the potential of agents to treat depression and anxiety.<br>
Rat Forced Swim Test (FST)<br>
The rat Forced Swim Test (FST) is a behavioral test that is used to screen compounds for antidepressant efficacy (Porsolt et al., 1977, 1978; Porsolt, 1981). This test is widely used as it is reliable across laboratories, relatively easy to perform and is sensitive to the effects of some of the major classes of antidepressant drugs, including TCAs and MAOIs, and various atypical antidepressants. Furthermore, this test is relatively selective for antidepressant drugs, as few psychoactive drugs produce similar behavioral actions in the FST.<br>
In the rat FST,  animals are placed in a cylinder of<br>
water, from which there is no escape,  for an extended period of time.  Typically, animals will display a range of behaviors such as immobility, climbing, swimming, and diving, with immobility being predominant after several minutes of immersion in the water.   Consequently, many past  studies have only measured or scored immobility after   the   administration   of   the   test   agent . Unfortunately,  this  method does not  score  any other active  behaviors  that  may  be  produced  by potential antidepressants.    Thus,  if  a  particular  class  of antidepressant  were  to  have  very  little  effect  on immobility,  yet produce characteristic behaviors during the FST,  these behaviors would not be scored and the conclusion would be that the compound in question does not possess antidepressant action.<br>
Recently, however, a sampling technique was developed to score active behaviors in the FST, such as swimming, climbing and diving, in addition to immobility (Detke, et al. , 1995; Lucki, 1997; Page, et al. , 1999; Reneric and Lucki, 1998) . This modified sampling technique has indicated that SSRIs, such as fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline, significantly decrease immobility and increase swimming time (Detke, et al. , 1995; Page, et al., 1999) . In contrast, selective reuptake inhibitors of norepinephrine (NE) increase climbing behavior but do not alter swimming time (Detke, et al. , 1995; Page, et al . , 1999) .<br>
Rat Social Interaction Test (SIT)<br>
There are a number of paradigms that have been used to<br>
determine whether a compound possesses anxiolytic action.<br>
A number of these tests involve food or water deprivation, punishment or measurement of consummatory behavior (see File, et al., 1980; File, 1985; Rodgers, et al. , 1997; and Treit, 1985, for review). In addition, in these models, prior conditioning reduces the uncertainty or anxiety. In general, these tests lack ethological validity.<br>
One model that is based upon an unconditioned response that does not involve punishment or deprivation is the Social  Interaction  Test  (SIT)  (File  and  Hyde,  1978, 1979) .   In this model, rats previously housed singly are placed in a familiar, dimly lit, test arena with weight -matched,  novel  partners.     The  principal  anxiogenic stimulus under these conditions is the partner novelty, which involves an unconditioned response to a potential threat. After pharmacological treatments, the following behaviors  are  scored  as  active  social  interaction: grooming, sniffing, biting, boxing, wrestling, following, crawling  over  and  crawling  under.  A  wide  range  of psychoactive drugs have been examined in this paradigm and it has been shown that the social interaction test can   distinguish   anxiolytics   from   antidepressants, antipsychotics,  analeptics  and  sedative  agents  (File, 1985;  Guy and Gardner,  1985) .  This  test  can  detect anxiolytic agents such as the benzodiazepines (File and Hyde, 1978; File and Hyde, 1979; File, 1980), in addition to non-benzodiazepines,  including paroxetine and other SSRIs  (Lightowler,  et al. ,  1994). Finally,  the social interaction test can detect anxiogenic agents, including the inverse benzodiazepine receptor agonists  (File,  et al., 1982; File and Pellow, 1983; File and Pellow, 1984;<br>
File, 1985).<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the synthesis of novel pyrimidines which bind selectively to the cloned human GAL3 receptor, compared to other cloned human G-protein coupled receptors, as measured in in vitro assays, is disclosed. In a further embodiment of the present invention the synthesis of indolones which bind selectively to the cloned human GAL3 receptor, compared to other cloned human G-protein coupled receptors, as measured in in vitro assays, is disclosed. The in vitro receptor assays described hereinafter were performed using various cultured cell lines, each transfected with and expressing only a single galanin-type receptor.<br>
From the binding information described hereinafter, it has unexpectedly been discovered that compounds which are specific for the human GAL3 receptor with a binding affinity greater than ten-fold higher than the binding affinity with which the compounds bind to a human GAL1 receptor are effective in animal models of depression and anxiety which are predictive of efficacy in humans. Thus, we demonstrate that the GAL3 receptor antagonists, which may be classified as neutral antagonists, inverse agonists or allosteric modulators, provide a novel method to treat depressive disorders and/or anxiety.<br>

Figure 5: Western Blot Results<br>
In order to establish the specificity of the anti-GAL3 antiserum,   membranes   prepared   from   COS-7   cells transiently transfected with the rat recombinant GAL3 (Borowsky et al. ,  1999)  (Lane 2)  or mock-transfected (vector only)  (Lane 3) were applied to an SDS-PAGE gel and blotted using the GAL3 receptor polyclonal antibody. Lane 1 corresponds to molecular weight marker. The anti-GAL3 antiserum labeled proteins in membranes only from rat GAL3-transfected cells (Lane 2) ; a predominant band was  evident  with  an  apparent  molecular  weight  of approximately 56 kDa,  (somewhat higher than the amino acid-derived value of- 40.4 kDa).  The apparently high molecular  weight  observed  for  rat  GAL3  very  likely reflects  post -translational   processing  such  as glycosylation; note that rat GAL3 contains multiple N-terminal  glycosylation  sites  (Smith  et  al.,  1998). Relative to the predominant band, additional species of higher molecular weight as well as lower molecular weight were labeled by the GAL3 antiserum. These are interpreted as protein aggregates of C-terminal fragments, as they are absent in mock-transfected cells.<br>

For the purposes of this invention the term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" has been defined herein.<br>
The term "antagonist" refers to a compound which binds to, and decreases the activity of, a receptor in the presence of an agonist. In the case of a G-protein coupled receptor, activation may be measured using an appropriate second messenger system which is coupled to<br>
the receptor in a cell or tissue in which the receptor is expressed.    Some  specific but  by no means  limiting examples  of  well-known second messenger  systems  are adenylate  cyclase,  intracellular calcium mobilization, ion  channel  activation,  guanylate  cyclase,  inositol phospholipid  hydrolysis,  and  MAP  kinase  activation. Conversely, the term "agonist" refers to a compound which binds to, and increases the activity of, a receptor as compared with the activity of the receptor in the absence of  any agonist.  Methods  to perform second messenger assays are described in PCT International Publication No. 97/46250  and  in  PCT  International  Publication  No. 98/15570, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
In the case that a receptor has activity in the absence of  an  agonist  (constitutive  receptor  activity)  the antagonist may act as an inverse agonist or an allosteric modulator,  as  opposed  to  a  neutral  antagonist,  and suppress receptor signaling independent of the agonist (Lutz and Kenakin, 1999).  The categories of "antagonist compounds"  are therefore seen to include 1)  neutral antagonists  (which block agonist actions but do not affect constitutive activity); 2) inverse agonists (which block agonist actions as well as constitutive activity by stabilizing an inactive receptor conformation); 3) and allosteric modulators (which block agonist actions to a limited extent and which may also block constitutive activity through allosteric regulation). The probability that an antagonist is neutral and therefore of "zero efficacy"  is  relatively  low,  given  that  this  would require  identical  affinities  for  different  tertiary<br>
conformations of the receptor. Thus, Kenakin proposed in 1996  that,  "with  the  development  of  sensitive  test systems for the detection of inverse agonism will come a reclassification of many drugs. It might be observed that numerous previously classified neutral antagonists may be inverse agonists" (Kenakin, 1996) .  Indeed, there is now evidence from studies with known pharmacological agents to support the existence of inverse agonists for numerous receptors, including histamine, 5HT1A, 5HT2c/ cannabinoid, dopamine, calcitonin and human formyl peptide receptors, among others (de Ligt, et al, 2000; Herrick-Davis, et al, 2000; Bakker, et al, 2000) .   In the case of the 5HT2C receptor,  clinically effective atypical  antipsychotics drugs   such  as  sertindole,   clozapine,   olanzapine, ziprasidone,    risperidone,    zotepine,    tiospirone, fluperlapine and  tenilapine   displayed potent inverse activity whereas  typical  antipsychotic  drugs  such  as chlorpromazine,  thioridazine,  spiperone and thiothixene were classified as neutral antagonists (Herrick-Davis et al, 2000) . In the case of the histamine Hi receptor, the therapeutically    used    anti-allergies    cetirizine, loratadine  and  epinastine  were  found  to  be  inverse agonists.   These findings further extend the idea that many  compounds  previously  thought  of  as  neutral antagonists will be reclassified as inverse agonists when tested in a constitutively active receptor system  (de Ligt et al, 2000).<br>
For the purpose of the claimed invention, a GAL3 antagonist useful in the treatment of depression is one which a) selectively binds to the GAL3 receptor, and b) displays antidepressant activity in the rat Forced Swim<br>
Test. Furthermore, a GAL3 antagonist useful in the treatment of anxiety is one which a) selectively binds to the GAL3 receptor, and b) displays anxiolytic activity in the rat Social Interaction. Also for the purpose in the present invention, a GAL3 antagonist useful in the treatment of depression and anxiety, is one which a) selectively binds to the GAL3 receptor, b) displays antidepressant activity in the rat Forced Swim Test, and c) displays anxiolytic activity in the rat Social Interaction Test.<br>
In order to test compounds for selective binding to the human GAL3 receptor the cloned cDNAs encoding both the human and rat GAL1 and GAL2 receptors have been used. The cloning and assay methods for the human and rat GAL1 receptors may be found in PCT International Publication No. WO 95/22608, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The cloning and assay methods for the human and rat GAL2 receptors may be found in PCT International Publication No. WO 97/26853, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The present invention provides for a method of determining the binding affinity of a GAL3 antagonist, wherein the GAL3 antagonist is dissolved in a "suitable solvent". A "suitable solvent" means one which permits the measurement of binding affinity of the GAL3 antagonist to the human GAL3 receptor at concentrations less than 1 uM, preferably less than 100 nM. Examples of solvents include, but are not limited to, DMSO, ethanol, N,N-dimethylacetamide,  or  water.  For  indolones,  the<br><br>
preferred solvent is 3% DMSO (final concentration in the assay). For pyrimidines, the preferred solvent is 1% ethanol/0.09% polypuronic acid F-127 (final concentration in the assay) . For any other type of compounds, the preferred solvent is the solvent which permits the measurement of binding affinity of a GAL3 antagonist at the lowest concentration. Once a suitable solvent is ascertained for the binding assay of the human GAL3 receptor, the same solvent is used in assays to determine the binding affinity at the GAL1 receptor, the serotonin transporter, the norepinephrine transporter, and the dopamine transporter. A solvent of 0.4% DMSO is used in the central monoamine oxidase enzyme assay.<br>

In  the  present  invention  the  term  " pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" is any pharmaceutical carrier known to those of ordinary skill in the art as useful  in formulating pharmaceutical compositions.  On December 24, 1997  the Food and Drug Administration of  the United States Department of Health and Human Services published a guidance entitled "Q3C Impurities: Residual Solvent". The guidance recommends acceptable amounts of residual solvents  in  pharmaceuticals  for  the  safety  of  the patient, and recommends the use of less toxic solvents in the manufacture of drug substances and dosage forms. Table 1 of the guidance lists "Class 1 Solvents" .   The guidance then states that the use of Class 1 Solvents should be avoided in the production of drug substances, excipients,  or drug products unless their use can be strongly justified  in a  risk-benefit  assessment.  The guidance further states that Class 2 Solvents should be limited in order to protect patients from potentially adverse  effects.     The  guidance  characterized  the following solvents as Class 1 Solvents: benzene, carbon tetrachloride,   1,2-dichloroethane,   1,1-dichloroethene, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane.   The guidance characterized the following solvents as Class 2 Solvents: acetonitrile, chlorobenzene,     chloroform,     cyclohexane,     1,2-dichloroethene,   dichloromethane,   1,2-dimethoxyethane, N,N-dimethylacetamide,     N,N-dimethylf ormamide,     1/4-dioxane,   2-ethoxyethanol,   ethyleneglycol,   formamide, hexane,  methanol,  2-methoxyethanol,  methylbutyl ketone, methylcyclohexane,   N-methylpyrrolidone,   nitromethane, pyridine,    sulfolane,    tetralin,    toluene,    1,1,2-<br>
trichloroethene and xylene. As used in this invention the term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" shall not include Class 1 or Class 2 Solvents.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the pharmaceutical carrier may be a liquid and the pharmaceutical composition would be in the form of a solution. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is a solid and the composition is in the form of a powder or tablet. In a further embodiment, the pharmaceutical carrier is a gel and the composition is in the form of a suppository or cream. In a further embodiment the compound may be formulated as a part of a pharmaceutically acceptable transdermal patch. In yet a further embodiment, the compound may be delivered to the subj ect by means of a spray or inhalant.<br>
A solid carrier can include one or more substances which may also act as endogenous carriers  (e.g. nutrient or micronutrient carriers),  flavoring agents,  lubricants, solubilizers,   suspending  agents,   fillers,   glidants, compression  aids,   binders  or  tablet-disintegrating agents;  it can also be an encapsulating material.  In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in admixture with the finely divided active ingredient. In tablets, the active ingredient is mixed with a carrier having the necessary compression properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired. The powders and tablets preferably contain up to 99% of the active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers include, for example, calcium phosphate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugars,  lactose,  dextrin,  starch,  gelatin,  cellulose,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidine, low melting waxes and ion exchange resins.<br>
Liquid  carriers  are  used  in  preparing  solutions, suspensions, emulsions, syrups, elixirs and pressurized compositions.  The active ingredient can be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier such as water, an organic solvent, a mixture of both or pharmaceutically acceptable oils or fats.   The liquid carrier  can  contain  other  suitable  pharmaceutical additives  such as  solubilizers,  emulsifiers,  buffers, preservatives,  sweeteners,  flavoring agents,  suspending agents, thickening agents, colors, viscosity regulators, stabilizers or osmoregulators.    Suitable  examples  of liquid carriers for oral and parenteral administration include water (partially containing additives as above, e.g.    cellulose    derivatives,    preferably    sodium carboxymethyl  cellulose  solution),  alcohols  (including monohydric  alcohols  and  polyhydric  alcohols,   e.g. glycols)   and   their  derivatives,   and  oils   (e.g. fractionated  coconut  oil  and  arachis  oil) .     For parenteral administration,  the carrier can also be an oily ester such as ethyl oleate or isopropyl myristate. Sterile liquid carriers are useful in sterile liquid form compositions for parenteral administration.

Experimental Details<br>
I.   Synthesis of Chemical Compounds<br>
The following examples are for the purpose of illustrating methods useful for making compounds of this invention.<br>
General Methods: All reactions were performed under an Argon atmosphere and the reagents, neat or in appropriate solvents,  were transferred to the reaction vessel via syringe and cannula techniques.  Anhydrous solvents were purchased from the Aldrich Chemical Company and used as received.   The examples described in the patent were named using the ACD/Name Program (version 4.01, Advanced Chemistry Development  Inc.,  Toronto,  Ontario,  M5H2L3, Canada) .  The 1H NMand 13C NMR spectra were recorded at either 300 MHz (GEQE Plus) or 400 MHz (Bruker Avance) in CDCl3 as solvent and tet ramethylsilane as the internal standard unless otherwise noted. Chemical shifts (5) are expressed in ppm, coupling constants (J) are expressed in Hz, and splitting patterns are described as follows: s = singlet; d = doublet; t = triplet; q = quartet; quintet; sextet; septet; br = broad; m = mutiplet; dd = doublet of doublets; dt = doublet of triplets.  Elemental analyses were performed by Robertson Microlit Laboratories, Inc. Unless  otherwise,  mass  spectra  were  obtained  using electrospray ionization (ESI, Micromass Platform II) and MH+ is  reported.   Thin-layer Chromatography  (TLC)  was carried out on glass plates pre-coated with silica gel 60 F254 (0.25 mm, EM Separations Tech.) . Preparative TLC was carried out on glass sheets pre-coated with silica gel GF (2  mm,  Analtech).  Flash  column  chromatography  was<br>
performed on Merck silica gel 60 (230 -400 mesh). Melting points (mp) were determined in open capillary tubes on a Mel-Temp apparatus and are uncorrected.<br>
The following additional abbreviations are used: HOAc, acetic acid; DIPEA, diisopropylethylamine; DMF, N,N-dimethylformamide; EtOAc, ethyl acetate; MeOH, methanol; TEA, triethylamine; THF, tetrahydrofuran; All solvent ratios are volume/volume unless stated otherwise.<br>
A.   General Procedures for Preparing Pyrimidines<br>
The  compounds  of  this  invention  were  prepared  by sucessively displacing the three chlorine atoms  of a 2,4,6-trichloropyrimidine with amines.  It was found that some amines (i.e. anilines) selectively displace the 2-position chlorine of 2,4,6-trichloropyrimidine,  whereas other amines (e.g. piperidine) selectively displace the 4- or 6-position chlorine first (note that the 4- and 6-positions are chemically equivalent) .  Some amines react non-selectively at both the 2- and 4- positions of 2,4,6-trichloropyrimidine.  It  was  also  found  that  if  the pyrimidine is substituted at the 4- or 6-position with an amine (mono- or di-substituted, or unsubstituted), then the  next  amine  (mono-  or  di-substituted)  undergoes substitution at the 2-position of the pyrimidine.  Thus, several  different  Procedures were used to obtain the compounds described by this invention.   The following Procedures are representative of the methods that are useful for making compounds of this invention.<br>

I.   In-Vivo Models<br>
A.   Materials and Methods<br>
1.   Forced Swim Test (FST)<br>
The procedure used in this study was similar to that previously described (Porsolt, et al. , 1978), except the water depth (30 cm in this procedure) . The greater depth in this test prevented the rats from supporting themselves by touching the bottom of the cylinder with their feet. Swim sessions were conducted by placing rats in individual plexiglass cylinders (46 cm tall x 20 cm in diameter) containing 23-25°C water 30 cm deep (Porsolt, et al. used a depth of only 15 cm; also, see Detke, et al., 1995). Two swim tests were conducted always between 1200 and 1800 hours: an initial 15-min pretest followed 24 h later by a 5-minute test. Drug treatments were administered 60 minutes before the 5-minute test period. All other test sessions were conducted between 1300 to 1700 hours. Following all swim sessions, rats were removed from the cylinders, dried with paper towels and placed in a heated cage for 15 minutes and returned to their home cages. All test sessions were videotaped using a Panasonic color video camera and recorder for scoring later.<br>
Animals<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic Farms, NY) were used in all experiments. Rats were housed in pairs and maintained on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle. Rats were handled for 5 minutes each day for 5 days prior to behavioral testing.<br>
Behavioral Scoring<br>
The rat's behavior was rated at 5 second intervals during<br>
the 5 minute test as one of the following:<br>
1.	Immobility- rat remained floating in the water without struggling and was only making those movements necessary to keep its head above water;<br>
2.	Climbing - rat was making active movements with its forepaws in and out of the water, usually directed against the walls;<br>
3.	Swimming - rat was making active swimming motions, more than necessary to merely maintain its head above water, e.g. moving around in the cylinder; and<br>
4.	Diving -    entire body of the rat was submerged.<br>
All of the behavior scoring was done by a single rater, who was blind to the treatment condition. The rater was also present in the room throughout the entire test period.<br>
Drug Administration<br>
Animals were randomly assigned to receive a single i.p.<br>
administration of Example 92 (1, 3, 10 or 3 0 mg/kg, dissolved in 100% DMSO), fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, dissolved in distilled water) or vehicle (equal mixture of DMSO and distilled water) 30 minutes before the start of the 5 minute test period. All injections were given using 1 cc tuberculin syringe with 26 3/8 gauge needles (Becton-Dickinson, VWR Scientific, Bridgeport, NJ) . The volume of injection was 1 ml/kg.<br>
In another set of experiments, animals were randomly assigned to receive a single p.o. administration of one of the following treatments: Example 151 (1, 3 or 10 mg/kg), fluoxetine (5 or 10 mg/kg) or vehicle (1 ml/kg of 100% N,N-dimethylacetamide) δ0 minutes before the start of the 5 minute test period. The drugs were dissolved in 100% N,N-dimethylacetamide. All administrations were given using 1 cc tuberculin syringes, to which a 3 inch, curved, stainless steel gavage needle was attached. The volume of administration was 1 ml/kg.<br>
In other sets of experiments, animals were randomly assigned to receive a single p.o. administration of one of the following treatments: Example 103 (3, 10 and 30 mg/kg), fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) or vehicle (1 ml/kg of 100% N,N-dimethylacetamide) δ0 minutes before the start of the 5 minute test period; or Example 272 (3 mg/kg), fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) or vehicle (1 ml/kg of 100% N,N-dimethylacetamide) 24 hours before the start of the 5 minute test period; or Example 98 (3, 10 and 30 mg/kg), fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) or vehicle (1 ml/kg of 100% N,N-dimethylacetamide) δ0 minutes before the start of the 5 minute test period; or Example 3 4  (0.3,  1, 3 and 10<br>
mg/kg), fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) or vehicle (1 ml/kg of a 100% solution of dimethylacetamide) δ0 minutes before the start of the 5 minute test period; or Example 49 (3, 10 and 30 mg/kg) , fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) or vehicle (1 ml/kg of  100% N,N-dimethylacetamide) δ0  minutes before  the start of the 5 minute test period; or Example 22 (3, 10 and 3 0 mg/kg) , fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) or vehicle (1 ml/kg of  100% N,N-dimethylacetamide) δ0 minutes before the start of the 5 minute test period. The compounds were dissolved    in    100%    N,N-dimethylacetamide.    All administrations  were  given  using  1  cc  tuberculin syringes, to which a 3 inch, curved,  stainless steel gavage needle was attached.  The volume of administration was 1 ml/kg.<br>
The effect of 5 or 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine was utilized in the FST as a positive control.<br>
Data Analysis<br>
The forced swim test data (immobility, swimming, climbing, diving) were subjected to a randomized, one-way ANOVA and post hoc tests conducted using the Student-Newman-Keuls test. The data were analyzed using the GBSTAT program, version 6.5 (Dynamics Microsystems, Inc., Silver Spring, MD, 1997) . All data are presented as means ± S.E.M.<br>
2.   Social Interaction Test (SIT)<br>
Rats were allowed to acclimate to the animal care facility for 5 days and were housed singly for 5 days prior to testing. Animals were handled for 5 minutes per day. The design and procedure for the Social Interaction<br>
Test was carried out as previously described by Kennett, et al. (1997). On the test day, weight matched pairs of rats  (±  5%),  unfamiliar to  each other,  were  given identical treatments and returned to their home cages. Animals were randomly divided into 5 treatment groups, with 5 pairs per group,  and were given one of the following i.p. treatments: Example 92  (10,  30 or 100 mg/kg), vehicle (1 ml/kg) or chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg). Dosing  was  1  hour  prior  to  testing.  Rats  were subsequently placed in a white perspex test box or arena (54 x 37 x 26 cm) , whose floor was divided up into 24 equal squares, for 15 minutes.  An air conditioner was used to generate background noise and to keep the room at approximately 74°F.  All sessions were videotaped using a JVC camcorder  (model GR-SZ1,  Elmwood Park,  NJ)  with either  TDK  (HG  ultimate  brand)  or  Sony  30  minute videocassettes.  All sessions were conducted between 1:00 4:30  P.M.   Active social  interaction,  defined as grooming, sniffing, biting, boxing, wrestling, following and crawling over or under, was scored using a stopwatch (Sportsline model no. 226, 1/100 sec. discriminability) . The number of episodes of rearing  (animal completely raises up its body on its hind limbs) , grooming (licking, biting, scratching of body), and face washing (i.e. hands are moved repeatedly over face), and number of squares crossed were scored. Passive social interaction (animals are lying beside or on top of each other) was not scored. All behaviors were assessed later by an observer who was blind as to the treatment of each pair. At the end of each test, the box was thoroughly wiped with moistened paper towels.<br>

Male albino Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic Farms, NY) were housed in pairs under a 12 hr light dark cycle (lights on at 0700 hrs.) with free access to food and water.<br>
Drug Administration<br>
Example 92 was dissolved in 100% DMSO (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). Chlordiazepoxide (purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in double distilled water. The vehicle consisted of 50% DMSO (v/v) . All drug solutions were made up 10 minutes prior to injection and the solutions were discarded.<br>
Example 34 was dissolved in 5% lactic acid, v/v. The vehicle consisted of 100% dimethylacetamide (DMA) and this was used to make up all drug solutions. All drug solutions were made up fresh each day and any unused solutions were discarded at the end of the test day. The volume of drug solution administered was 1 ml/kg.<br>
Data Analysis<br>
The social interaction data (time interacting, rearing and squares crossed) were subjected to a randomized, oneway ANOVA and post hoc tests conducted using the Student-Newman-Keuls test. The data were subjected to a test of normality (Shapiro-Wilk test). The data were analyzed using the GBSTAT program, version 6.5 (Dynamics Microsystems, Inc., Silver Spring, MD, 1997). All data are presented as means ± S.E.M.<br>

A. The Effect Of Vehicle, Fluoxetine and Example 92 On<br>
Immobility, Climbing and Swimming In The Forced Swim Test<br>
Immobility<br>
Statistical analysis indicated that there was a significant drug effect [F(4,45) = 12.1, p 
Climbing<br>
The statistical analysis of the climbing counts indicated that there was a significant drug effect [F(4,45) = 4.4, p = 0.004] . Post hoc analysis indicated that a single injection of 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine did not significantly alter climbing counts compared to vehicle-treated animals (Table 5 and Figure 2) . In contrast, a single injection of 10 mg/kg of Example 92 produced a significant increase (16.8 + 0.6) in climbing counts (Student-Newman-Keuls value = 11.6,  p 
animals (12 ± 0.8) . Example 92 dosed at 1, 3 &amp; 30 mg/kg did not significantly alter climbing.<br>
Swimming<br>
The statistical analysis of the swimming data indicated that there was a significant drug effect [F(4,45) = 6.6, p 
Diving<br>
This behavior was rarely observed following a single injection of vehicle (0.1 + 0.1, one animal dove once), fluoxetine (0.1 ± 0.1, one animal out of 10 dove once), 1 mg/kg of Example 92 (0.6 + 0.2; 5 animals had counts of 2, 1, 1, 1, and 1), 3 mg/kg of Example 92 (0.6 ± 0.3; 3 animals had counts of 3, 2 and 1) or 10 mg/kg of Example 92 (0.5 + 0.5; note: only one animal at this dose showed diving behavior and the score was 5) . At 30 mg/kg i.p. of Example 92 diving behavior was only observed in two animals (mean = 0.2 + 0.2). Thus there was no significant drug effect on diving [F(4,45) = 0.77, p = 0.55].<br>

The results of the Forced Swim Test indicate that using a modified version of the Lucki forced swim test, a single injection of 10 mg/kg i.p. of fluoxetine produced a significant decrease in immobility and an increase in swimming in male Sprague-Dawley rats. This is consistent with findings from previous studies using the Lucki version (Detke, et al. , 1995; Kirby and Lucki, 1997; Lucki, 1997; Page, et al., 1999; Reneric and Lucki, 1998) . In addition, the results obtained using fluoxetine are consistent with those using other SSRIs (Detke, et al., 1995). Thus, a modified version of the Lucki forced swim test can consistently detect the antidepressant action of SSRIs such as fluoxetine.<br>
Interestingly, at doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg i.p., Example 92, significantly decreased immobility compared to vehicle-treated animals. The magnitude of the decrease was not significantly different than that of fluoxetine. Thus, based on past interpretations of the Forced Swim Test, our results suggest that Example 92 has antidepressant-like properties.<br>
A single injection of either 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg i.p. of Example 92 did not significantly alter swimming behavior. This is in contrast to the results obtained with fluoxetine, which increased swimming at 10 mg/kg i.p. Previously, it has been reported that compounds which selectively block serotonin uptake significantly increase swimming but not climbing whereas selective NE uptake blockers significantly increase climbing but not swimming behavior (Reneric and Lucki, 1998) .   Thus, the present<br>
findings suggest that Example 92 exhibits a profile similar to NE and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) depending on the dose tested.<br>
Finally, as previously reported by Lucki, diving behavior was rarely observed in vehicle or fluoxetine-treated animals (1 dive in one rat for each group). Example 92 at all doses tested did not produce a significant effect on diving behavior. It is possible that antidepressant drugs do not induce diving behavior.<br>
In conclusion, compared to vehicle-treated animals, Example 92, at doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg, produced a significant decrease in immobility and a significant increase in climbing at the 10 mg/kg dose. At 3 0mg/kg i.p. Example 92 produced a significant increase in swimming behavior comparable with that observed with the antidepressant fluoxetine, thus supporting the antidepressant-like profile of Example 92.<br>
B. The effect of Example 151, fluoxetine, and vehicle on swimming, climbing, immobility, and diving in the forced swim test.<br>
Immobility<br>
Statistical analysis indicated a significant effect of treatment on immobility (ANOVA, F(5,46) = 3.5, p = 0.0095) . Post hoc analyses revealed that a single p.o. administration of 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine significantly decreased immobility (Fisher's LSD value of 2.9) compared to vehicle-treated animals (Table 5a) . In contrast, a single p.o. administration of 5 mg/kg of fluoxetine did<br>
not significantly alter immobility compared to vehicle-treated animals.<br>
A single p.o. administration of 1 mg/kg of Example 151 did not significantly alter immobility compared to vehicle-treated animals (Table 5a). In contrast, a single p.o. administration of either 3 or 10 mg/kg of Example 151 significantly decreased immobility compared to animals treated with vehicle (Fisher's LSD values of 2.8 and 2.6, respectively) or 5 mg/kg p.o. of fluoxetine (Fisher's LSD values of 2.6 and 2.4, respectively). There was no significant difference in the reduction in immobility between 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine and 3 and 10 mg/kg of Example 151.<br>
Swimming<br>
Statistical analysis indicated a significant treatment effect on swimming behavior (ANOVA, F(5,46) = 5.5, p = 0.0005). Post hoc analyses revealed that a single p.o. administration of 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine produced a significant increase in swimming behavior compared to vehicle-treated animals (Student-Newman-Keuls value of 16.8 (Table 5a) . In contrast, a single p.o. administration of 5 mg/kg of fluoxetine did not significantly alter swimming compared to vehicle-treated animals.<br>
A single p.o. administration of either 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg of Example 151 significantly increased swimming (Student-Newman-Keuls values of 6.9, 14.8 and 13.4, respectively) compared  to vehicle-treated  animals.    There was  no significant difference in the magnitude of the increase<br>
in swimming between the doses of Example 151. The 3 and 10 mg/kg doses of Example 151 produced a significantly-greater increase in swimming compared to animals treated with 5 mg/kg p.o. of fluoxetine. There was no significant difference in the increase in swimming between animals treated with 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine and those treated with Example 151.<br>
Climbing behavior<br>
Statistical analysis revealed that climbing was not significantly altered by a single p.o administration of 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg of Example 151 or 5 or 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine compared to vehicle-treated animals (ANOVA, F(5,46) = 0.81, p = 0.55)(Table 5a).<br>
Diving<br>
Statistical analysis revealed that diving was not significantly altered by a single p.o. administration of 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg of Example 151 or 5 or 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine compared to vehicle-treated animals (ANOVA, F(5,46) = 0.36, p = 0.87)(Table 5a).<br>
TABLE 5a. The effect of a single p.o. administration of vehicle, 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg of Example 151 and 5 and 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine on immobility, climbing, diving and swimming in the forced swim test in male Sprague-Dawley rats.<br>

The results of this study indicate that a single p.o. administration of Example 151, at doses of 1,3 and 10 mg/kg,  produces  a  significant  increase  in  swimming behavior.   There was no significant difference in the magnitude of the increase in swimming between the doses of Example 151, although the 1 mg/kg dose produced a lower increase.   In contrast, only the 3 and 10 mg/kg doses of Example 151 significantly decreased immobility compared to vehicle-treated animals.   Thus, it appears that a single p.o. administration of either 3 or 10 mg/kg, compared to 1 mg/kg of Example 151, produce a more robust antidepressant profile in the FST in male Sprague-Dawley rats.  Our results also indicate that Example 151 produced changes in swimming and immobility that were not significantly different from that of 10 mg/kg p.o. of fluoxetine.  This  suggests  that  Example  151  produces behavioral  effects  similar  to that  of  10 mg/kg of fluoxetine in the FST.<br>
A single p.o. administration of 5 mg/kg of fluoxetine did not significantly alter swimming, climbing, diving or immobility compared to vehicle treated animals. This finding, together with the data indicating that 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine produces a significant effect on swimming<br>
and immobility in the FST, suggest that the threshold dose of fluoxetine is greater than 5, but less than 10 mg/kg. This is consistent with ex vivo data indicating that a p.o. dose of 7 mg/kg of fluoxetine is required to inhibit 5-HT uptake in the CNS by 50% (Leonard, 1996) .<br>
In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that a single p.o. administration of Example 151 (particularly the 3 and 10 mg/kg doses) produces behavioral effects in the FST in rats that resemble those of antidepressants.<br>
C. The Effect of a Single P.O. Administration of Example 103, Fluoxetine and Vehicle on Swimming, Immobility, Climbing and Diving in the Forced Swim Test<br>
Immobility<br>
Statistical analysis indicated a significant effect of treatment on immobility (ANOVA, F(4,40) = 6.3, p = 0.0005). Post hoc analyses revealed that a single p.o. administration of 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine significantly decreased immobility (Student-Newman-Keuls value of 8.3) compared to vehicle-treated animals (Table 5b) . The decrease in immobility produced by fluoxetine was significantly greater than that of either 3 or 10 mg/kg p.o. of Example 103 (Student-Newman-Keuls values of 9.1 and 6.1, respectively).<br>
A single p.o. administration of either 3 or 10 mg/kg of Example 103 did not significantly alter immobility compared to vehicle-treated animals. However, the 30 mg/kg dose of Example 103 produced a significant decrease in  immobility  (Student-Newman-Keuls  values  of  13.9)<br>
compared to vehicle-treated animals. In addition, the decrease in immobility produced by 30 mg/kg of Example 103 was significantly greater than that of 3 and 10 mg/kg of Example 103 (Student-Newman-Keuls values of 14.4 and 10.6, respectively). There was no significant difference between fluoxetine and 3 0 mg/kg of Example 103 in the reduction of immobility.<br>
Swimming<br>
Statistical analysis indicated a significant treatment effect on swimming behavior (ANOVA, F(4,40) = 9.2, p 
A single p.o. administration of either 3 or 10 mg/kg of Example 103 did not significantly alter swimming behavior compared to vehicle-treated animals. A single p.o. administration of 3 0 mg/kg of Example 103 produced a significantly greater increase in swimming behavior compared to animals treated with either vehicle, 3 or 10 mg/kg of Example 103 (Student-Newman-Keuls values of 18, 18.6 and 14.5 respectively).<br>
Climbing behavior<br>

Diving<br>
Statistical analysis revealed that diving was not significantly altered by a single p.o. administration of 3, 10 or 3 0 mg/kg of Example 103 or 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine compared to vehicle-treated animals (ANOVA, F(4,40) = 1.1, p = 0.36)(Table 5b).<br>

The results of this study indicated that as previously reported, a single p.o. administration of 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine produced a significant increase in swimming and a significant decrease in immobility in male rats in the FST compared to vehicle-treated animals. The magnitude of these changes are similar to those reported of our past studies with 10 mg/kg p.o. of fluoxetine. In contrast, neither climbing nor diving behavior was significantly altered by a single p.o. administration of 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine.<br>
A single p.o. administration of either 3 or 10 mg/kg of Example  103  did  not  significantly  alter  swimming, climbing, immobility or diving in male rats in the FST, indicating that at these doses using the p.o. route. Example 103 does not exhibit antidepressant action in the FST.   In contrast, a single p.o. administration of 3 0 mg/kg of Example 103 produced a significant increase in swimming  and  a  significant  decrease  in  immobility compared to animals treated with vehicle or 10 mg/kg of Example 103.  However, the 30 mg/kg p.o. dose of Example 103 did not significantly alter diving or climbing counts compared to vehicle-treated animals.   The increase in swimming counts produced by 30 mg/kg p.o. of Example 103 was comparable to that for 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine.<br>
In conclusion, a single p.o. administration of 3 0 mg/kg of Example 103  (one hour before the last swim test)<br>
increases swimming and decreases immobility counts in the FST, suggesting that Example 103 has antidepressant properties.<br>
D. Effect of a single p.p. administration of Example 272, fluoxetine and vehicle on swimming, climbing, immobility and diving in the forced swim test<br>
Immobility<br>
Statistical analysis indicated a significant effect of treatment on immobility (ANOVA, F(2,27) = 5.2, p = 0.0126). Post hoc analyses revealed that a single p.o. administration of 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine and 3 mg/kg of Example 272 significantly decreased immobility (Student-Newman-Keuls values of 5.4 and 9.8, respectively) compared to vehicle-treated animals (Table 5c) . There was no significant difference between fluoxetine and 3 mg/kg of Example 272 in the reduction of immobility (Student-Newman-Keuls value of 0.53).<br>
Swimming<br>
Statistical analysis indicated a significant treatment effect on swimming behavior (ANOVA, F(2,27) = 9.9, p 
Climbing behavior<br>
Statistical  analysis  revealed  that  diving  was  not significantly altered by a single p.o. administration of either 3 mg/kg of Example 272 or 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine compared to vehicle-treated animals  (ANOVA,  F(2,27) 1.8, p = 0.19)(Table 5c).<br>
Diving<br>
Statistical analysis revealed that diving was not significantly altered by a single p.o. administration of 3 mg/kg of Example 272 or 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine compared to vehicle-treated animals (ANOVA, F(2,27) = 0.65, p = 0.53)(Table 5c).<br>

The finding of this study indicate that a single p.o. administration of 3 mg/kg of the compound Example 272 produced a significant increase in swimming and a significant decrease in immobility 24 hours after administration compared to vehicle-treated animals. However, the administration of Example 272 did not significantly  alter  climbing  or  diving  compared  to<br>
vehicle-treated animals. These results are similar to those of a single p.o. administration of 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine. Our finding suggest that a single p.o. administration of 3 mg/kg of Example 272 has the profile of an antidepressant in male Sprague-Dawley rats in the Lucki version of the FST.<br>
E. Effect of a single p.O. administration of Example 98, fluoxetine and vehicle on swimming, climbing, immobility and diving in the forced swim test.<br>
Immobility<br>
Statistical analysis indicated a significant effect of treatment on immobility (ANOVA, F(4,43) = 7.5, p = 0.0001) . Post hoc analyses revealed that a single p.o. administration of 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine significantly decreased immobility (Student-Newman-Keuls value of 23.8) compared to vehicle-treated animals (Table 5d) .<br>
A single p.o. administration of 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg of Example 98 significantly decreased immobility compared to vehicle-treated animals (Student-Newman-Keuls values of 19.3, 9.7 and 13.7, respectively). There was no significant difference between fluoxetine and 3, 10 or 3 0 mg/kg of Example 98 in the magnitude of the reduction of immobility. There were no significant differences between the doses of Example 98 regarding the magnitude of the decrease in immobility.<br>
Swimming<br>
Statistical analysis indicated a significant treatment<br>
effect on swimming behavior (ANOVA, F(4,43) = 11, p 
0.0001) .   Post hoc analyses revealed that a single p.o. administration of 10 mg/kg of  fluoxetine produced a significant increase in swimming behavior compared to vehicle-treated animals  (Student-Newman-Keuls value of 35.1) (Table 5d) .<br>
A single p.o. administration of 3, 10 or 3 0 mg/kg of Example 98 significantly increased swimming compared to vehicle-treated animals (Student-Newman-Keuls values of 24.4, 14.7 and 25.1, respectively) (Table 5d). There was no significant difference between fluoxetine and 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg of Example 98 in the magnitude of the increase in swimming. There were no significant differences between the doses of Example 98 regarding the magnitude of the increase in immobility.<br>
Climbing behavior<br>
There was a significant treatment effect on climbing behavior (ANOVA, F(4,43) = 2.8, p = 0.04) (Table 5d) . Post hoc tests indicated that this was the result of the 3 mg/kg dose of Example 98 producing a significantly greater increase in climbing compared to 30 mg/kg of Example 98 (Table 5d; Student-Newman-Keuls value of 8.6). There was no significant difference in the number of climbing counts between animals treated with vehicle and Example 98.<br>
Diving<br>
Statistical analysis revealed that diving was not significantly altered by a single p.o. administration of 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg of Example 98 or 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine<br>
compared to vehicle-treated animals (ANOVA, F(4,43) = 1.29, p = 0.29)(Table 5d).<br>

The results of this study clearly indicate that in male Sprague-Dawley rats, a single p.o. administration of 3, 10 or 3 0 mg/kg of Example 98 produces a significant increase in swimming and a significant decrease in immobility compared to vehicle-treated animals in the FST. In addition, the Example 98 induced alterations were similar in magnitude to that of a single p.o. administration of 10 mg/kg p.o. of fluoxetine. However, neither fluoxetine nor Example 98 produced a significant alteration in climbing or diving compared to vehicle-treated animals.<br>
In conclusion, these results indicate that a single p.o. administration of Example 98 produces a profile in the modified Lucki version of the FST resembling that of the clinically established antidepressant fluoxetine.<br>
F. Effect of a single p.o. administration of Example 34, fluoxetine and vehicle on swimming, climbing, immobility and diving in the forced swim test.<br>
Immobility<br>
Statistical analysis indicated a significant effect of treatment on immobility (ANOVA, F(5,44) = 18.1, p 
administration of 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine significantly decreased immobility (Student-Newman-Keuls value of 39.6) compared to vehicle-treated animals (Table 5e). Fluoxetine also produced a significantly greater decrease in immobility compared to the 0.3 and 10 mg/kg doses of Example 34 (Student-Newman-Keuls values of 15.3 and 29.8, respectively). There was no significant difference in the magnitude of the decrease in immobility between fluoxetine and the 1 and 3 mg/doses of Example 34.<br>
A single p.o. administration of 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg of Example 34 significantly decreased immobility compared to vehicle-treated animals (Student-Newman-Keuls values of 7.03, 41.6 and 42.0, respectively)(Table 5e). However, a single p.o. administration of 10 mg/kg of Example 34 did not significantly decrease in immobility compared to vehicle-treated animals. The magnitude of the decrease in immobility produced by 1 and 3 mg/kg doses of Example 34 was significantly greater than that for the 0.3 (Student-Newman-Keuls values of 14.5 and 15.3) and 10 mg/kg (Student-Newman-Keuls of 30.6 and 31.3, respectively) doses of Example 34 (Student-Newman-Keuls of 21.3 and 10.8, respectively).<br>

A single p.o. administration of either 0.3, 1 or 3 mg/kg of Example 34 produced a significant increase in swimming behavior compared to vehicle-treated animals (Student-Newman-Keuls values of 12.1, 72.1 and 80.3, respectively)<br>
(Table 5e) . In addition, the magnitude of the increase in swimming was greater for the 1 and 3 mg/kg doses<br>
(Student- Newman -Keuls values of 5 0.4 and 57.9, respectively) compared to 0.3 mg/kg of Example 34.<br>
Climbing behavior<br>
Statistical analysis indicated a significant treatment effect on swimming behavior (ANOVA, F(5,44) = 3.2., p = 0.014) (Table 5e) . Post hoc analyses revealed that a single p.o. administration of 1 mg/kg of Example 34 produced a significant increase in climbing compared to vehicle-treated animals (Student-Newman-Keuls value of 9.2)  (Table 5e)<br>
Diving<br>
Statistical analysis revealed that diving was not significantly altered by a single p.o. administration of 0.3, 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg of Example 34 or 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine compared to vehicle-treated animals (ANOVA, F(5,44) = 0.75, p = 0.59)(Table 5e).<br>

However, a single p.o. administration of 10 mg/kg of Example 34 did not significantly alter swimming or climbing compared to vehicle-treated animals. Currently, the explanation for the lack of effect of 10 mg/kg p.o. of Example 34 is unknown. The 1 mg/kg dose of Example 34 produced a significant increase in climbing compared to vehicle-treated animals. The magnitude of the alterations in swimming and immobility produced by 1 and 3 mg/kg p.o. of Example 34 was significantly greater than that for the 0.3 and 10 mg/kg doses of Example 34. Finally, none of the doses of Example 34 significantly<br>
altered diving behavior compared to vehicle-treated controls.<br>
As previously reported, a single p.o. administration of 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine produced a significant increase in swimming and a significant decrease in immobility compared to vehicle-treated controls. The effect of fluoxetine on swimming and immobility was similar to that for the 1 and 3 mg/kg doses of Example 34 but was significantly greater than that of 0.3 and 10 mg/kg of Example 34. A single p.o. administration of 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine did not significantly alter climbing or diving behavior compared to vehicle-treated controls.<br>
In conclusion, these results indicate that a single p.o. administration of 0.3, 1 or 3 mg/kg Example 34 produces an effect in the FST that resembles that of antidepressants in male Sprague-Dawley rats.<br>
G. Effect of a single p.o. administration of Example 49, fluoxetine and vehicle on swimming, climbing, immobility and diving in the forced swim test.<br>
Immobility<br>
Statistical analysis indicated a significant effect of treatment on immobility (ANOVA, F(4,41) = 6.5, p = 0.0004). Post hoc analyses revealed that a single p.o. administration of 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine significantly decreased immobility (Student-Newman-Keuls value of 15.6) compared to vehicle-treated animals (Table 5f).<br>
A single p.o. administration of either 3 or 10 mg/kg of Example 49 did not significantly alter immobility compared to vehicle-treated animals. However, the 30 mg/kg dose of Example 49 produced a significant decrease in immobility (Student-Newman-Keuls values of 8.0) compared to vehicle-treated animals. In addition, the decrease in immobility produced by either fluoxetine or 30 mg/kg of Example 49 was significantly greater than that of the 10 mg/kg dose of Example 49. There was no significant difference between fluoxetine and 3 0 mg/kg of Example 49 in the reduction of immobility.<br>
Swimming<br>
Statistical analysis indicated a significant treatment effect on swimming behavior (ANOVA, F(4,41) = 16.2, p 
A single p.o. administration of either 3 or 10 mg/kg of Example 4 9 did not significantly alter swimming behavior compared to vehicle-treated animals. A single p.o. administration of 3 0 mg/kg of Example 49 produced a significantly greater increase in swimming behavior compared to animals treated with vehicle, 3 or 10 mg/kg of Example 49 (Student-Newman-Keuls values of 14 and 16.9, respectively).<br>
Climbing behavior<br>
There was a significant treatment effect on climbing behavior (ANOVA,' F(4,42) = 5.9, p = 0.007). Post hoc tests indicated that this was the results of the vehicle, 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg doses of Example 49 producing a significantly greater increase in climbing counts compared to fluoxetine-treated animals (Table 5f; Student-Newman-Keuls values of 7.9, 18.1, 14.05 and 12.9, respectively). There was no significant difference in the number of climbing counts between animals treated with vehicle and Example 49.<br>
Diving<br>
Statistical analysis revealed that diving was not significantly altered by a single p.o. administration of 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg of Example 49 or 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine compared to vehicle-treated animals (ANOVA, F(4,41) = 1.06, p = 0.38)(Table 5f).<br>

The results of this study indicated that as previously reported, a single p.o. administi tion of 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine produced a significant increase in swimming and a significant decrease in immobility in male rats in the FST compared to vehicle-treated animals. The magnitude of these changes are similar to those reported of our past studies with 10 mg/kg p.o. of fluoxetine. In contrast, climbing behavior was significantly decreased by a single p.o. administration of 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine compared to all other treatment groups. However, this could be related to the fact that fluoxetine has a much greater effect on swimming than climbing and it is likely that fluoxetine is not producing climbing as opposed to actually decreasing climbing. Finally, fluoxetine, as previously reported, does not significantly alter diving compared to vehicle-treated behavior.<br>
A single p.o. administration of either 3 or 10 mg/kg of Example 4 9 did not significantly alter swimming, climbing, immobility or diving in male rats in the FST, indicating that at these doses using the p.o. route, Example 49 does not exhibit antidepressant action in the FST.   In contrast, a single p.o. administration of 30<br>
mg/kg of Example 49 produced a significant increase in swimming and a significant decrease in immobility compared to animals treated with vehicle, or 3 and 10 mg/kg of Example 49. However, the 30 mg/kg p.o. dose of Example 49 did not significantly alter diving or climbing counts compared to vehicle-treated animals. The increase in swimming counts produced by 3 0 mg/kg p.o. of Example 49 was comparable to that of 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine, although Example 49 was less effective than fluoxetine in reducing immobility.<br>
In conclusion, a single p.o. administration of 30 mg/kg of Example 49 (one hour before the last swim test) increases swimming and decreases immobility counts in the FST, suggesting that Example 49 may have antidepressant properties in this model.<br>
H. Effect of a single p.o. administration of Example 22, fluoxetine and vehicle on swimming, climbing, immobility and diving in the forced swim test<br>
Immobility<br>
Statistical analysis indicated a significant effect of treatment on immobility (ANOVA, F(4,44) = 20.2, p 
A single p.o. administration of 10 or 3 0 mg/kg doses of Example 22 produced a significant decrease in immobility compared to vehicle-treated animals (Student-Newman-Keuls<br>
values of 12.2 and 55.0, respectively).    In addition, the decrease in immobility produced the either fluoxetine or the 10 and 30 mg/kg doses of Example 22 (Student-Newman-Keuls values of 21.2, 13.0 and 56.8, respectively) was significantly greater than that of the 3 mg/kg dose of Example 22.  The decrease in immobility produced by 30 mg/kg i.p. of  Example 22 was significantly greater than that of the 10 mg/kg dose  (Student-Newman-Keuls value 16.2).  In addition, the magnitude of the decrease in immobility produced by 30  mg/kg of  Example  22  was significantly greater than that of fluoxetine (Student-Newman-Keuls value of 9.3).<br>
Swimming<br>
Statistical analysis indicated a significant treatment effect on swimming behavior (ANOVA, F(4,44) = 35.00, p 
A single p.o. administration of 3 mg/kg did not significant alter swimming behavior compared to vehicle-treated animals (Table 5g). However, a single p.o. administration of 30 mg/kg of Example 22 produced a significantly greater increase in swimming behavior compared to animals treated with vehicle, 3 or 10 mg/kg of Example 22 and fluoxetine (Student-Newman-Keuls values of 85.9, 88.1, 22.7 and 5.84, respectively).<br>
Climbing behavior<br>
There was a significant treatment effect on climbing behavior (ANOVA, F(4,44) = 4.1, p = 0.0066). Post hoc tests indicated that a single p.o. administration of 3 0 mg/kg dose of Example 22 produced a significant increase in climbing compared to animals treated with vehicle, 3 or 10 mg/kg of Example 22 and fluoxetine (Student-Newman-Keuls values of 10.5, 11.1, 5.8 and 11.8, respectively).<br>
Diving<br>
Statistical analysis revealed that diving was not significantly altered by a single i.p. administration of 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg of Example 22 or 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine compared to vehicle-treated animals (ANOVA, F(4,44) = 0.58, p = 0.68)(Table 5g).<br>

The results of this study indicated that as previously reported, a single p.o. administration of 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine produced a significant increase in swimming and a significant decrease in immobility in male Sprague-Dawley rats in the FST compared to vehicle-treated animals. The magnitude of these changes are similar to those reported of our past studies with 10 mg/kg p.o. of fluoxetine.   In contrast, neither climbing nor diving<br>
behavior was significantly altered by a single  i.p. administration of 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine.<br>
A single p.o. administration of 3 mg/kg of Example 22 did not significantly alter swimming in male rats in the FST. In contrast, a single p.o. administration of 10 or 30 mg/kg of Example 22 produced a significant increase in swimming and a significant decrease in immobility compared to animals treated with vehicle or 3 mg/kg of Example 22. In addition, the magnitude of the increase in swimming behavior produced by 3 0 mg/kg p.o. of Example 22 was significantly greater than that of 10 mg/kg of Example 22 and 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine. The rank order of the treatments for increasing swimming is: 30 mg/kg Example 22 &gt; fluoxetine &gt; 10 mg/kg Example 22 &gt; 3 mg/kg Example 22<br>
Climbing behavior was significantly greater in animals treated with 30 mg/kg p.o. of Example 22 compared to animals treated p.o. with either vehicle, 3 or 10 mg/kg of Example 22 or 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine. None of the other treatments besides 30 mg/kg of Example 22 significantly altered climbing behavior compared to vehicle-treated animals. The rank order of the treatments for increasing climbing is: 30 mg/kg Example 22 &gt;&gt; 3 Mg/kg Example 22 = 10 mg/kg Example 22 = fluoxetine.<br>
A single p.o. administration of 3 mg/kg of Example 22 did not significantly alter swimming compared to vehicle-treated animals. However, the 10 and 30 mg/kg doses produced a significantly greater decrease in immobility<br>
compared to vehicle-treated animals, with the effect at 30 mg/kg being greater then that of 10 mg/kg. Furthermore, 3 0 mg/kg p.o. of Example 22 produced a significantly greater decrease in immobility than 10 mg/kg p.o. of fluoxetine. The rank order of the treatments for decreasing immobility is 30 mg/kg Example 22 &gt; 10 mg/kg Example 22 - fluoxetine &gt; 3 mg/kg Example 22.<br>
In conclusion, a single p.o. administration of 10 or 30 mg/kg of Example 22 significantly increases swimming and significantly decreases immobility in vehicle-treated male Sprague-Dawley rats. This suggests that at these doses, Example 22 has antidepressant properties.<br>
I. Effect of a single p.o. administration of Example 95, fluoxetine and vehicle on swimming, climbing, immobility and diving in the forced swim test<br>
Statistical analysis indicated that a single p.o. administration of 10 or 3 0 mg/kg Example 95 significantly increased rat immobility and significantly decreased swim behavior in the rat forced swim test at both doses (Table 5h, p 
TABLE 5h. The effect of a single p.o. administration of vehicle, 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine and 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg of Example 95 on Immobility, climbing, diving and swimming in the forced swim test in male Sprague-Dawley rats.<br>

A single p.o. administration of 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine produced a significant  increase in swimming behavior compared  to  vehicle-treated  animals.   In  addition, fluoxetine significantly decreased immobility compared to vehicle-treated animals. A single p.o. administration of 3  mg/kg  of  Example  95  did not  significantly  alter swimming,   climbing,   immobility  or  diving  behavior compared to vehicle-treated animals.   In contrast,  a single p.o. administration of either 10 or 30 mg/kg of Example 95 produced a significant increase in immobility and a significant decrease in swimming behavior compared to vehicle-treated animals.  There was  no  significant difference in the magnitude of change in swimming and immobility between the 10 and 30 mg/kg doses of Example 95.<br>
These data indicate that at a doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg p.o., Example 95 produced effects opposite of that seen with antidepressants in the rat forced swim test, suggesting that Example 95 does not produce antidepressant-like actions in the forced swim test in male Sprague-Dawley rats.<br>
2.   Social Interaction Test<br>
A.  The Effect Of Example 92 And Chlordiazepoxide On<br>
Behavior In The Rat Social Interaction Test<br>
A single i.p. administration of either 10 or 30 mg/kg of Example 92 significantly increased social interaction (Table 6 and Figure 4) , as did the benzodiazepine anxiolytic, chlordiazepoxide (Student-Newman-Keuls value of 31.3) compared to vehicle-treated animals [ANOVA, F(4,45) = 10.3, p

B. The Effect Of Example 92 And Chlordiazepoxide On Rearing Behavior, Locomotor Activity And Grooming In The Rat Social Interaction Test<br>
The administration of 10 and 30 mg/kg, but not 10 0 mg/kg of Example 92, significantly increased rearing behavior compared to either vehicle or chlordiazepoxide [ANOVA, F(4,45) = 2.6, p = 0.046; See Table 13]. In addition, the number of rearings at the 10 mg/kg dose of Example 92 was significantly greater than that produced by chlordiazepoxide (Table 13).<br>
The administration of either Example 92 or chlordiazepoxide did not significantly alter the number of grooming bouts compared to vehicle-treated animals [F(4,45) = .67, p = 0.62].<br>
A single injection of either 10 or 30 mg/kg i.p. of Example 92 or 5 mg/kg i.p. of chlordiazepoxide did not significantly alter the number of squares crossed (Table 13). However, the number of squares crossed following the 100 mg/kg dose of Example 92 was significantly lower than animals treated with either vehicle, 10 mg/kp i.p. of Example 92, 30 mg/kg i.p. of Example 92 or 5 mg/kg i.p. of chlordiazepoxide. [ANOVA, F(4,43) = 6.94, p = 0.0002] .<br>

At doses of 10 and 3 0 mg/kg i.p., Example 92 produced a significant increase in social interaction time in male rats  compared  to  vehicle-treated  animals.  Also,  the anxiolytic agent (5 mg/kg i.p. chlordiazepoxide) produced a significant increase in social interaction time compared to vehicle-treated animals.  The response produced by the 30 mg/kg dose of Example 92 was comparable to that of the positive control, chlordiazepoxide.  The 30 mg/kg dose of Example 92 produced a significant increase in rearing compared to vehicle- and chlordiazepoxide-treated animals. Previously,  it  has  been  shown  that  in  the  Social Interaction Test, psychostimulants such as amphetamine and caffeine,  increase  social  interaction  and  locomotor activity, whereas anxiolytics increase social interaction time. (File, 1985; File and Hyde, 1979; Guy and Gardner, 1985) . Consistent with an increase in social interaction. Example 92 increased rearing behavior.   However, it did not produce an increase in horizontal locomotor activity or grooming bouts. In addition, Example 92 did not elicit stereotypes or produce aggressive behaviors.  In fact, locomotor activity as measured by squares crossed was significantly reduced at  the 100 mg/kg i.p.  dose of Example  92  compared to vehicle-treated animals.  This decrease in locomotor activity did not appear to be accompanied by ataxia or sedation. Thus, it is unlikely that Example 92 is producing a non-specific effect on social interaction through motor stimulation. In order to justify this claim, in another study (not reported), the effect of Example 92 was dosed to familiar cage mates in the social interaction test and no significant increase in interaction in this variation of the Social Interaction Test was observed. In this test, the anxiogenic stimulus<br>
of a novel partner is removed and therefore only locomotor activity and normal behavior are observed (Guy and Gardner, 1985) . In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that Example 92, at doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg i.p., significantly increases social interaction time without producing an increase in horizontal locomotor activity or grooming bouts. Furthermore, the effect produced by the 30 mg/kg of Example 92 was comparable to that observed for 5 mg/kg of chlordiazepoxide, the active control. No increase in social interaction was observed at the 100 mg/kg dose of Example 92. However, a decrease in the number of squares crossed was observed. In summary, Example 92 has the profile of an anxiolytic drug in the Social Interaction Test.<br>
C. The effect of a single p.p. administration of Example 34, vehicle and chlordiazepoxide on the duration of social interaction in the rat social interaction test.<br>
There was a significant treatment effect on the duration of social interaction (ANOVA, F(5,40) = 11.8, p 
in the duration of social interaction between the various doses of Example 34 (Table 6a).<br>

D. The effect of a single p.o. administration of Example 34, vehicle and chlordiazepoxide on rearing behavior, locomotor activity and grooming in the social interaction test.<br>
Statistical analysis indicated a significant effect of treatment on rearing behavior (ANOVA, F(5,40) = 3.5, p = 0.01; Table 14). Post hoc analyses revealed that the the number of rears following 0.3 mg/kg of Example 34 was significantly lower than that of 0.1 and 1 mg/kg p.o. of Example 34 (Student-Newman-Keuls values of 8.8 amd 9.4, respectively).<br>
Statistical analysis indicated a significant effect of treatment on number of squares crossed (F(5,40) = 2.9, p = 0.03) . Post hoc analyses indicated that a single p.o. administration of 0.3 mg/kg of Example 34 produced a significantly greater effect on the number of squares crossed compared to vehicle-treated animals (Student-Newman-Keuls values of  10.4).<br>
Statistical analysis indicated a significant effect of treatment on grooming behavior (F(5,40) = 4.3, p = 0.004). Post hoc analyses indicated that the number of grooming episodes was significantly lower in the 0.03 mg/kg group compared to animals treated with 0.1, 0.3' or 1 mg/kg p.o. of Example 34 (Student-Newman-Keuls values of 11, 8 and 9.7, respectively (Table 14). In additon, the number of grooming episodes was significantly greater in animals treated with 0.1 mg/kg p.o. of Example 34 compared  to those  treated with vehicle  (Table  14).<br>

One of the main findings of this study was that in paired, unfamiliar male Sprague-Dawley rats, a single p.o. administration of either 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 or 1 mg/kg p.o. of Example 34 produced a significant increase (2-2.6 fold) in the duration of social interaction compared to animals treated with vehicle. In addition, there was no significant difference in the magnitude of increase in social interaction between the various doses of Example 34, i.e. there was no dose-response relationship. As previously reported, a single p.o. administration of 5 mg/kg of chlordiazepoxide produced a significant increase in the duration of social interaction compared to vehicle-treated animals.<br>
Rearing behavior was not significantly altered by any of the doses of Example 34 or by chlordiazepoxide compared to vehicle-treated animals, although there were differences between the doses of Example 34. The number of squares crossed was significantly greater following a single p.o. administration of l mg/kg of Example 34 compared to vehicle-treated animals, whereas there were no significant differences between the other doses of Example 34 and vehicle.  Thus, overall, Example 34 does<br>
not significantly alter locomotor activity, suggesting that it does not produce locomotor activation or stimulation.<br>
Grooming behavior following a single p.o. administration tended to be greater after 0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg of Example 34 compared to animals that had received vehicle, although this was only statistically significant for the 0.1 mg/kg dose. Furthermore, the number of grooming episodes was significantly lower after a single p.o. administration of 0.03 mg/kg of Example 34 compared to 0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg of Example 34.<br>
In conclusion, the above results suggest that a single p.o. administration of 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 or 1 mg/kg of Example 34 produces an anxioltyic action in the social interaction test in male Sprague-Dawley rats.<br>
III Binding Properties of Compounds at Cloned Receptors<br>
A.   Materials and Methods<br>
The binding properties of the compounds of the present invention were evaluated at one or more cloned receptors or native, tissue-derived transporters, using protocols described below.<br>
Cell Culture<br>
COS-7 cells were grown on 150 mm plates in D-MEM with supplements (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium with 10% bovine calf serum, 4 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 |xg/ml streptomycin) at 37°C with 5% CO2. Stock plates of COS-7 cells were trypsinized and split 1:6 every 3-4 days. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were grown on 150 mm plates in D-MEM with supplements (minimal essential medium) with Hanks' salts and supplements (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium with 10% bovine calf serum, 4 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg /ml streptomycin) at 37°C with 5% CO2. Stock plates of 293 cells were trypsinized and split 1:6 every 3-4 days. Mouse fibroblast LM(tk-) cells were grown on 150 mm plates in D-MEM with supplements (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium with 10% bovine calf serum, 4 mM glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin) at 37°C with 5% CO2. Stock plates of LM(tk-) cells were trypsinized and split 1:10 every 3-4 days. Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells were grown on 150 mm plates in HAM's F12 medium with (HAM's F-12 with 10% bovine calf serum, 4 mM glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin) at 37°C with 5% CO2. Stock plates of CHO cells were trypsinized and split 1:8 every 3-4 days.<br>
LM(tk-) cells were stably transfected with the human GALl or GAL3 receptor. CHO cells were stably transfected with the human GAL2 receptor.<br>
Stable Transfection<br>
cDNAs for the human and rat GAL1, and human and rat GAL3 receptors were transfected with a G-418 resistant gene into the mouse fibroblast LM(tk-) cell line by a calcium phosphate transfection method (Cullen, 1987). Stably transfected cells were selected with G-418. Human and rat GAL2 receptors were similarly transfected into CHO cells.<br>
Membrane Harvest<br>
Membranes were harvested from stably transfected LM(tk-) cells.   Adherent cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (138 mM NaCl, 8.1 mM Na2HPO4, 2.5 mM KC1, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 0.9 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4)  and lysed by sonication in ice-cold sonication buffer  (20  mM Tris-HCl,  5  mM EDTA,  pH  7.7).  Large particles  and  debris  were  cleared  by  low  speed centrifugation  (200 x g,  5 min,  4°C) .  Membranes were collected from the supernatant fraction by centrifugation (32,000 x g, 18 min, 4°C) , washed with ice-cold hypotonic buffer, and collected again by centrifugation (32,000 x g, 18 min, 4°C). The final membrane pellet was resuspended by sonication into a small volume of ice-cold binding buffer (-1 ml for every 5 plates: 10 mM NaCl,  20 mM HEPES,  0.22 mM KHaPO4, 1.26 mM CaCl2, 0.81 mM MgSO4, pH 7.4) . Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method  (Bradford,  1976)  using  Bio-Rad  Reagent,  with bovine serum albumin as a standard.  Membranes were held on ice for up to one hour and used fresh, or flash frozen<br>
and stored in liquid nitrogen. Membranes were prepared similarly from CHO cells.<br>
As  described  in  the  Background  of  the  Invention, compounds that block the effects of galanin on the GAL3 receptor  subtype  can  potentially  be  used  for  the treatment  of  depression  and  anxiety.  Biogenic  amine transmitter molecules that mediate neuronal signals are currently known in the art and include among others serotonin (5HT), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine (DA) . Recent  advances  in  the  molecular  studies  of  the mechanisms for these transmitter molecules, together with the characterization of their pharmacological properties, has enabled the identification of numerous potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Inhibitors of the 5HT, NE and DA transporter systems, and inhibitors of the enzyme, monoamine oxidase, have been widely studied and are  known to  enhance  the  action of  biogenic  amine neurotransmitters.  The  resultant  clinically effective antidepressant drugs are known today as TCAs, SSRIs and MAOIs. (Tatsumi et al., 1997; Iversen, 2000).<br>
In the case of galanin, the evidence presented in this invention suggests that GPCR-targeted molecules that bind to and antagonize the GAL3 receptor may be used for the treatment of depression and/or anxiety disorders. Another approach could involve the administration of an antagonist of the GAL3 receptor, such as those described herein, which also possesses 5HT4 receptor antagonist properties (Kennett et al. , 1997). A further approach could involve the administration of a GAL3 antagonist, such as those described herein, which also possesses 5HT1A<br>
receptor  binding  properties  (Razani  et  al. ,  1997). However, in any case the GAL3 antagonist (s) δhould be free of activity at the human GAL1 receptor and the 5HT, NE   and  DA  transporters.   Furthermore,   the  GAL3 antagonist(s) δhould not inhibit the enzymatic activity of monoamine oxidase A (N1AOA)  or monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) present in the brain (i.e. central MAO). The design of such compounds can be optimized by determining their binding affinity at the recombinant GAL3 , GAL1, 5HT4, and 5HTiA  receptors;  and  the  native  5HT,  NE  and  DA transporters. The design of such compounds can be further optimized by determining their interaction with central MAOA and central MAOB.<br>
Additionally, the GAL3 antagonist(s) would optimally not bind at the following receptors due to possible side effects: human GAL2; human Hi histamine; human aiA adrenergic, human aiB adrenergic, human CXID adrenergic, human oi2A adrenergic, human (X2B adrenergic, and human a2c adrenergic; human dopamine D^ D2, D3f D4, and D5; and the human 5HT1B, human 5HTiD, human 5HT1E, human 5HT1F, human 5HT2A, rat 5HT2C» human 5HT6, and human 5HT7 receptors.<br>
Radioligand Binding Assays and Enzymatic Assays The methods to obtain the cDNA of the receptors, express said receptors in heterologous systems, and carry out assays to determine binding affinity are described as follows.<br>
Galanin Receptors: Binding assays were performed according to the following published methods: human GAL3 (PCT International Publication No. WO 98/15570), human<br>
GAL1  (PCT International Publication No.  WO 95/2260), human  GAL2  (PCT  International  Publication  No.  WO 97/26853).<br>
Human 5HTiB, 5HTiD, 5HT1E, 5HT1Ff and 5HT7 Receptors-. The cell lysates of LM(tk-) clonal cell line stably transfected with the genes encoding each of these 5HT receptor-subtypes were prepared as described above. Cell membranes were suspended in 50mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4 at 3 7°C) containing 10 mM MgC12, 0.2 mM EDTA, 10 M pargyline, and 0.1% ascorbate. The affinities of compounds were determined in equilibrium competition binding assays by incubation for 3 0 minutes at 37 °C in the presence of 5 nM [3H] -serotonin. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 pM serotonin. The bound radioligand was separated by filtration through GF/B filters using a cell harvester.<br>
Human 5HT2A Receptor: The coding sequence of the human 5HT2A receptor was obtained from a human brain cortex cDNA library, and cloned into the cloning site of pCEXV-3 eukaryotic expression vector. This construct was transfected into COS-7 cells by the DEAE-dextran method<br>
(Cullen, 1987). Cells were harvested after 72 hours and lysed by sonication in 5 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.5. The cell lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4°C, and the supernatant was subjected to centrifugation at 3 0,000 x g for 20 minutes at 4°C.  The pellet was suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer<br>
(pH 7.7 at room temperature) containing 10 mM MgSO4, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 0.1% ascorbate. The affinity of compounds at 5HT2A receptors were determined in equilibrium competition<br>
binding assays using [3H]ketanserin (1 nM). Nonspecific binding was defined by the addition of 10 pM mianserin. The bound radioligand was separated by filtration through GF/B filters using a cell harvester.<br>
5-HTia Receptor: The cDNA corresponding to the 5-HTiA receptor open reading frames and variable non-coding 5'-and 3'-regions, was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCEXV-3. These constructs were transfected transiently into COS-7 cells by the DEAE-dextran method (Cullen, 1987), and harvested after 72 hours. Radioligand binding assays were performed as described above for the 5-HT2A receptor, except that 3H-8-OH-DPAT was used as the radioligand and nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of 10 uM mianserin.<br>
Other 5-HT Receptors: Other serotonin receptor binding<br>
assays were performed according to published methods: rat 5HT2C receptor (Julius et al. , 1988); and 5-HT6 (Monsma, et al. , 1993). The binding assays using the 5-HT4 receptor were performed according to the procedures described in U.S. Patent No. 5,766,879, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety into this application.<br>
Other receptors: Cell membranes expressing human dopamine Di, D2, D4 and rat D3 receptors were purchased through BioSignal, Inc. (Montreal, Canada). Binding assays using the histamine Hi receptor; dopamine receptors; and a1A, OCIB, and a2 adrenergic receptors may be carried out according to the procedures described in U.S. Patent No. 5,780,485, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety into this application. Binding assays using the dopamine D5 receptor may be carried out according to the procedures described in U.S. Patent No. 5,882,855, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety into this application. Binding assays for the human a1D adrenergic receptor may be carried out according to the procedures described in U.S. Patent No. 6,156,518, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety into this application.<br>
The methods to determine binding affinity at native transporters are described in the following publications: 5HT transporter and NE transporter (Owens<br>
et al.,  1997),  and DA transporter  (Javitch et al, 1984) .<br>
The methods to determine activity at monoamine oxidase enzymes (for example, central MAOA and MAOB) are described by Otsuka and Kobayashi, 1964, and were performed by NovaScreen (Hanover, MD) with the following modifications.<br>
Central Monoamine Oxidase A Enzyme Assay:    Rat  brain was used as the enzyme source. The enzyme source was pre-incubated with reference  compound  (RO 41-1049), test  compound  (Example  92),  and  subtype  selective blocker (100nM deprenyl) for 60 minutes at 37°C in 50 mM KPO4 containing 50 µM EDTA and 10 µM dithiothreitol (pH 7.2 at 25°C) . Substrate ( [14C] Serotonin, 45-60 Ci/mmol) was  then  added and  incubated  for  30 minutes.  The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml of 1-2M citric acid. Radioactive product was extracted into xylene/ethyl acetate fluor and compared to control values by scintillation spectrophotometry in order to ascertain  any  interactions  of  test  compound  with central MAOA.<br>
Central Monoamine Oxidase B Enzyme Assay: Rat brain was used as the enzyme source. The assay was performed as described above for central MAOA, except the reference compound was RO 166491 and the subtype selective blocker was 100 nM clorgyline. Also, the substrate ( [14C] Phenylethylamine, 0.056 Ci/mmol) was added and incubated for 10 minutes.<br>
Materials<br>
Cell culture media and supplements were from Specialty Media (Lavallette, NJ). Cell culture plates (150 mm and 96-well microtiter) were from Corning (Corning, NY) . Polypropylene 96-well microtiter plates were from Co-star (Cambridge, MA) . Bovine serum albumin (ultra-fat free, A-7511) was from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). All radioligands were from New England Nuclear (Boston, MA) . Commercially available peptides and peptide analogs were either from Bachem California (Torrance, CA) or Peninsula (Belmont, CA) . All other materials were reagent grade.<br>
Data Analysis<br>
Binding data were analyzed using nonlinear regression and statistical techniques available in the GraphPAD Prism package (San Diego, CA) . Enzymatic assay data were derived from a standard curve of reference compound data.<br>
The selectivity ratios for compounds of the claimed invention were calculated from the binding data presented in Tables 1-4, Table 7 and Table 9 of the subject application. More specifically, these ratios were calculated by dividing (a) the binding affinity (Ki value) of said compound to a particular receptor or transporter by (b) the binding affinity (Ki value) of said compound to the human GAL3 receptor. The data presented in Table 8 and Table 10, hereinafter, were calculated using the above described method.<br>
For example, the GAL3/GAL1 selectivity ratio of 10-fold recited in claim 110 of the subject application is characteristic of Example 34. This binding ratio was calculated by dividing (a) the Ki value of 912 for the binding of Example 34 to the GAL1 receptor (see Table 1) by (b) the KA value of 23 for the binding of Example 34 to the human GAL3 receptor, thus obtaining the result of 39. Therefore the GAL3/GAL1 binding ratio for Example 34 was determined to be greater than 10-fold.<br>
B.   Results<br>
The compounds described in the claimed invention were assayed using a panel of cloned receptors and native transporters. The preferred compounds were found to be selective GAL3 antagonists. The binding affinities and selectivity ratios of several compounds are illustrated in Tables 7-10 .<br>

IV.  GAL3 Receptor Localization<br>
A.   Materials And Methods<br>
Preparation of the anti-GAL3 Antiserum<br>
BioSource  International,  Hopkinton,  MA performed  the immunization and maintenance of rabbits.   Following a pre-immune bleed, one peptide for each GAL receptor was injected into a pair of New Zealand white rabbits. The peptide  sequences  was  chosen  based  on  sequence specificity and immunogenicity.   The rabbit anti-GAL3 antiserum  were  raised  against  C-terminal  epitopes corresponding to amino acids 357 - 370 (Genbank accession number AF073798) .   The peptides were conjugated to the carrier KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) by a cross linker and  subcutaneously  injected  into  the  rabbits.    The generation  of  the  anti-GAL3  antiserum  required  OVA followed by a third series of injections with the GAL3 peptide  conjugated  to  tetanus  toxoid  (TTOX).    All injections were done using the Freund's Adjuvant System. Once immunoreactivity was established (see below)  the antiserum was affinity purified by passing it over an agarose based column thiol  coupled to its antigenic peptide.   The column was washed and the antiserum was eluted using a low pH glycine buffer.   The purified material was dialyzed, the optical density is taken. at 280  and the purified antiserum was frozen.<br>
Characterization of the anti-GAL3 antiserum<br>
Recombinant GAL1,  GAL2,  and GAL3 receptor transfected<br>
cells<br>
To  determine the  ability of  the GAL3  antiserum  to recognize only the GAL3 receptor protein in vitro, COS-7 cells were grown on poly-1-lysine-coated plastic chamber slides  (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville,  IL)  and transfected with recombinant rat GAL receptors (Genbank accession    numbers    U30290,    AF010318,    AF073798, respectively)  or  expression  vector  only  (for  mock-transfected cells) as previously described by Borowsky et al.  (1999).    Receptor  expression  was  confirmed  by radioligand binding.   Briefly, a subset of slides was washed three times in binding buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% bacitracin)  and  incubated  in  500  µl  binding  buffer containing porcine 125I-galanin  (625,000 dpm)  plus or minus 10 uM porcine galanin.  After incubation at room temperature for 1 hour, the binding buffer was aspirated and slides were rinsed three times in ice cold 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5.  Cells were solubilized in 1 ml of 0.1 N NaOH and 0.05% sodium deoxycholate for 30 minutes then transferred to test tubes for gamma counting of 125I.  To evaluate antibody activity another subset of slides were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS)  (Sigma, St. Louis,  MO)  to remove the medium and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde  (PFA)  (Sigma,  St.  Louis,  MO)  then permeabilized using 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS and incubated in 3% normal goat serum for 30 minutes to minimize nonspecific binding of the primary antibody.  Cells were incubated overnight at 4°C with the anti-GAL3 antiserum (1:1000 dilution). The cells were rinsed three times with PBS,  incubated for 30 minutes at 25°C with goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200 dilution)  (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa  Cruz,  CA) ,  rinsed  and  processed  using  the<br>
peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) reaction of Sternberger et al. (1982). Control experiments for antibody-specificity were (1) incubation of the cells in primary antiserum that had been preabsorbed with the respective antigenic peptide (20 (ig/ml) , (2) incubation without the primary antiserum, or (3) incubation with the primary antiserum replaced by normal goat serum.<br>
Western Blotting<br>
Membranes were prepared from COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the rat recombinant receptors GAL1, GAL2, and GAL3 as previously described (Borowsky et al. , 1999) . Transfected cells were lysed by sonication in ice-cold sonication buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 5 mM EDTA) . Cell lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 4°C for 10 minutes at 200 g. The supernatant was then fractionated by centrifugation at 4°C for 18 minutes at 32,000 g. The resulting membrane pellet was suspended into 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA. Protein samples (1-10 p.g) were solubilized in 2 X Laemmli buffer<br>
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and fractionated by SDS-PAGE in 10% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes for immunoblot analysis in ice-cold 25 mM Tris, pH 8, 192 mM glycine, 20% methanol as previously described by Harlow and Lane<br>
(1999) . Blots were incubated"' for 1 hour at 25°C in blocking buffer composed of 5% non-fat dried milk in TTBS<br>
(0.1% Tween-20, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5) then for 16 hours at 25°C with the receptor-specific polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer) (0.25 mg/ml for GAL2 or 1.5 mg/ml for GAL3) . Immunoreactive bands were detected with the Phototope-HRP Detection Kit for<br>
Western Blotting (New England BioLab, Beverly, MA) according to the protocol. Briefly, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG then developed with a mixture of LumiGLO plus hydrogen peroxide and recorded by chemiluminescence on Kodak Biomax-ML film (Kodak, Rochester, NY).<br>
Immunohistochemistry<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats,  (200-250 g; Charles R1vers, Rochester,  NY)  were  anesthetized  by  intraperitoneal injection of ketamine 20 mg/kg  (RBI, Natick, MA)  and xylazine 0.2 mg/kg  (Bayer,  Shawnee Mission, KS)  then transcardially perfused with 200 ml PBS, pH 7.4 followed by 200 ml 4% PFA in PBS.   The brains and spinal cords were removed, blocked, and postfixed in the same fixative for 4 hours at 4°C then cryoprotected in 3 0% sucrose in PBS at 4°C for 48 hours before freezing on dry ice. Coronal  brain  sections  and  transverse  spinal  cord sections were cut at 30 urn using a freezing microtome. Tissue sections were immediately immersed in PBS and stored at 4°C until use.  Sections were processed free-floating according to the protocol outlined in NEN Life Science  Products  TSA  (Tyramide  Signal Amplification) Indirect   Kit.      Briefly,   tissue   sections   were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100  (Sigma,  St. Louis, MO)/PBS, incubated in 1% hydrogen peroxide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)/PBS to remove endogenous peroxidase activity then blocked in TNB Buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl,  and 0.5%  Blocking  Reagent.    Sections  were incubated for 24 hours at 4°C in either the anti-GAL2 or anti-GAL3 antiserum (1:100).   Following incubation with the primary antiserum, the tissue sections were washed in<br>
TNT Buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) followed by incubation at 25°C for 30 minutes with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (1:200) (Sternberger Monoclonals Inc., Lutherville, MD) . Tissue sections were rinsed in TNT Buffer and incubated in a solution containing biotinylated tyramide to amplify the signal then rinsed in TNT buffer and incubated with HRP-conjugated to streptavidin at 25°C for 30 minutes. An immunoperoxidase reaction was done by incubating the section in 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) (0.05%) in 0.1 mM Tris, pH 7.4 and adding hydrogen peroxide to 0.006% immediately before use. The reaction was stopped in water and the sections mounted on microscopic slide with mounting medium (40% ethanol: gelatin) and counterstained with Cresyl violet then coverslipped for light microscopy.<br>
Optimal GAL3 antibody concentrations (1:200) for rat brain sections were determined in preliminary titration experiments. Experimental controls in the tissue sections included (1) incubation in normal rabbit serum or (2) omission of the primary antiserum.<br>
Analysis<br>
COS-7 cells and tissue sections were examined using a Zeiss Axioscope. A total of 6 male rats were examined with the anti-GAL3 antiserum. The identification of GAL3-LI in the transfected cells and brain regions was based on the presence of immunoreactivity appearing as a brownish precipitate in individual cells and their projections or in the neuropil of the tissue by light<br>
microscopy. The descriptions of neuroanatomic boundaries are based on the atlas of Paxinos and Watson (1998).<br>
B.   Results<br>
Characterization of the GAL3 antiserum<br>
Recombinant GAL1,  GAL2, and GAL3 receptor transfected cells<br>
The ability of the anti-GAL3 antiserum to recognize only the GAL3 receptor protein in vitro was established by performing immunocytochemistry on COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the recombinant receptor proteins for the rat GAL1, GAL2, and GAL3, or mock-transfected with vector only. Specific porcine 125I-galanin binding was detected for all transfectants except mock-transfected cells. An immune response was detected only in the COS-7 cells incubated with the antiserum generated for the particular recombinant receptor. Specifically, no immune reaction was observed with the anti-GAL3 antiserum (1:1000) in GAL1 or GAL2 transfected cells. Furthermore, no visible immune reaction was detected in the mock-transfected cells. Incubation of the cells in primary antiserum that had been preabsorbed with the antigenic peptide (20 \ig/ml) or without the primary antiserum or with the primary replaced by normal goat serum did not result in an immune response.<br>
Taken together, these data demonstrate that the anti-GAL3 antiserum recognizes the receptor against which it was generated and does not show cross reactivity with other known GAL receptors.<br>
Western Blots<br>
To determine the specificity of the anti-GAL3 antiserum, COS-7  cells were transiently transfected either with recombinant rat GAL2 or GAL3 receptors or with expression vector only; membranes were then isolated for evaluation by immunoblotting (see Figure 5). The anti-GAL3 antiserum labeled  proteins  in  membranes  only  from  rat  GAL3-transfected cells; a predominant band was evident with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 56 kDa (Figure 5) , somewhat higher than the amino acid-derived value of 40.4 kDa.  (For comparison, apparent molecular weights determined by SDS-PAGE are 56 kDa (Servin et al. , 1987) or 54 kDa (Chen et al. , 1992) for native GAL receptors purified from rat brain and 54 kDa (Amiranoff et al. , 1989) for native GAL receptors purified from R1n m 5F cells.  These values are all higher than the amino acid-derived value any known GAL receptor subtype, including the value of 38.9 kDa for rat GAL1 (Parker et al., 1995). The apparently high molecular weight observed for rat GAL3   very   likely   reflects   post-translational processing such as glycosylation; note that rat GAL3 contains multiple N-terminal glycosylation sites (Smith et  al. ,  1998).   Relative to the predominant band, additional species of higher molecular weight as well as lower molecular weight were labeled by the corresponding antiserum (Figure 5) .   These are presumably receptor-related species composed of protein aggregates of C-terminal  fragments,  as  they  are  absent  in  mock-transfected cells.<br>
Immunohistochemical distribution of GAL3-LI in the CN5 GAL3-like immunoreactivity (GAL3-LI) was observed in many regions  of  the  brain,  specifically,  the  neocortex, septum, hippocampus, amygdala, and brainstem (see Table 12) .  Throughout the brain and spinal cord GAL3-LI was found to be associated with neuronal profiles however, there was neuropil staining observed in several brain regions. Several regions of the CNS almost exclusively expressed GAL3-LI, specifically the accumbens nucleus, dorsal raphe, ventral tegmental area (Table 12) .  There was no observable staining of the fiber tracts.<br>
The specificity of the anti-GAL3 antiserum was determined in tissue sections by (1) omission of the primary antiserum or (2) incubation with normal rabbit serum. No specific staining was observed in either condition. Preabsorption of the GAL3 primary antiserum with the antigenic peptide (10 µg/ml) decreased but did not completely block staining in the tissue sections as in the transfected cells. This was most likely related to the different localization approaches. In the transiently transfected COS-7 cells the expression of GAL3 receptor protein was relatively high therefore, indirect immunocytochemistry with no amplification was used. In contrast, GAL3 receptor protein expression is presumed to be relatively lower in the tissue sections and for that reason the TSA (amplification) technique was employed. It is possible that because of the amplification (1000-fold) in the TSA technique even small amounts of unabsorbed antiserum may result in a signal.<br>
Distribution of GAL3-LI in the rat CNS<br>
Cerebral cortex<br>
GAL3 -LI was widespread in the cerebral cortex and the distribution pattern extended rostrocaudally. A weak to moderate GAL3-LI was seen in numerous cell bodies in the anterior cingulate cortex.<br>
Septal region<br>
An extensive and densely stained fiber network was seen throughout the entire lateral, intermediate and medial septal nuclei. The dorsal division of the lateral septum contained scarce moderately GAL3-like immunoreactive somata.<br>
Basal ganglia<br>
Numerous moderately GAL3-like immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers were present in the shell and core of the accumbens nucleus. The cell bodies of the subthalamic nucleus, a relay nucleus in the basal ganglia, contained weak GAL3-LI.<br>
Amygdala and Extended Amygdala<br>
In general, GAL3-LI was weak throughout the amygdala. Scattered cell bodies and fibers exhibited weak staining in several nuclei. Very fine GAL3-like immunoreactive fibers with scattered moderately labeled cells were detected in the central amygdaloid nucleus.<br>
Midbrain/Mesencephalon<br>
Labeled cells were detected within the dorsal raphe and<br>
projections from these cells were seen converging toward<br>
the midline of the raphe. Moderately immunoreactive scattered cells were evident in the ventral tegmental area.<br>
Brain stem<br>
Intense staining was observed in cell bodies in the locus<br>
coeruleus.<br>
The distribution of rat GAL3 protein in the CNS using receptor subtype selective polyclonal antibodies and tyramide signal amplification (TSA) immunocytochemistry is illustrated in Table 12. These were qualitative evaluations for the rat GAL3 receptor protein distribution based on the relative intensity of the chromogen (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) observed in individual cells at the microscopic level.<br>
A total of 4 rat brains were analyzed for this study. As shown in Table 12, the strength of the signal obtained in various regions of the rat brain was graded as weak ( + ) , or      moderate       (++)       or      intense (+++) .<br>
Table   12<br>
(Table Removed)  <br>
The GAL3 antiserum was characterized using recombinant GAL receptors in transiently transfected COS-7 cells and Western blot analysis and the specificity of the GAL3 antiserum to recognize only the cognate receptor in vitro was established. The anatomical distribution of the GAL3 receptor protein in the rat CNS was determined using a modified immunohistochemical technique to enhance sensitivity and delectability via tyramide signal amplification (Toda et al. , 1999).<br>
The results indicate that the expression GAL3-LI was primarily found in neuronal profiles with neuropil labeling detectable in several areas. In general, the distribution of GAL3-LI is in good agreement with the reported distribution for galanin-LI, galanin binding sites, and GAL3 mRNA in the rat brain (for recent review, Branchek et al., 2000). Overall, GAL3-LI was extensively distributed throughout the brain. Paralleling the distribution of galanin binding sites GAL3-LI was observed in ventral regions of the brain.<br>
The localization of the GAL3 protein in the dorsal raphe and locus coeruleus suggests a potential therapeutic application of galanin receptor antagonists in the treatment of depression by attenuating galanin's inhibitory tone on both of these regions.<br>
A decrease in central serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission has been implicated in depression. GAL3 antagonists could possibly act via GAL3 receptors on the cell bodies of dorsal raphe neurons to increase firing rate of raphe neurons thus increasing 5-HT release in the telencephalon and diencephalon. Another possible site of action for a GAL3 antagonist could be on postsynaptic GAL3 receptors in the limbic forebrain to block the putative ability of galanin to negatively regulate 5-HT1A receptor transmission (Misane et al, 1998) .<br>
Unlike the dorsal raphe cells, the cells of the locus coeruleus express abundant galanin under normal conditions and it has been proposed that galanin may be released from dendrites and soma of the noradrenergic cell bodies (for review, Hokfelt et al. , 1998). The ascending afferent projections of the locus coeruleus are extensive throughout the brain. Changes in the noradrenergic system have been hypothesized to be involved in depression-related behaviors and symptoms (for review, Weiss et al., 1998). The ventral tegmental area (VTA) receives projections from the locus coeruleus that have been reported to co-localize galanin and noradrenaline. It has been proposed that in certain pathological states (ex. stress induced depression) galanin released from noradrenergic terminals in the VTA<br>
inhibits dopaminergic neurons in the region that results in decreased dopamine release in the forebrain regions, particularly the accumbens nucleus and prefrontal cortex. This decrease in dopamine release produces a decreased motor activation and anhedonia.  GAL3 has been identified in all of these regions and thus presents itself as a potential  therapeutic  target  in  the  treatment  of depression.    Drugs  that  would  effectively  decrease galanin's release in the VTA whether at the level of the locus  coeruleus  (somatodendritic  GAL3  receptors  to decrease the activity of LC cells) or in the VTA itself (presynaptically on NE/GAL terminals in the VTA or via GAL3  receptors  on  VTA-DA  neurons  to  prevent  the hyperpolarization VTA-DA cells by released galanin) would produce an antidepressant effect.<br>
