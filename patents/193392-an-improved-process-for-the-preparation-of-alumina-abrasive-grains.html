This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of alumina abrasive grains. The abrasive prepared by the process is used for both coated and bonded alumina abrasives  The conventional process for the production of alumina abrasive grains is through fusion using arc furnace. The calcined alumina is melted at temperatures above 2000 deg C or calcined bauxite is fused at temperatures above 2000 deg C in presence of carbon to reduce its impurities such as titania, iron oxide, silica, etc.<br>
In both the above cases the molten material is cooled, crushed, magnetite and graded to obtain the various grit sizes required for abrasive grain preparation. Here as this process requires melting of the raw material, the process becomes highly energy intensive and also the crystal size of the resulting abrasive grain would be more than 150 microns in size.<br>
Subsequently another process was developed through sol gel route yielding abrasive grains with small crystal sizes of about 0.5 microns consuming low energy. In this route the major steps so far employed include dispersing the hoehmite in water to form alumina in sol state, addition of seeds like alpha alumina either by milling using alumina grinding media or direct addition of microns alpha alumina particles. To this is added additives such as magnesia, titania, yttria, etc. and dried, crushed, calcined and sintered using conventional sintering furnace. The conventional sintering furnace could be an electric or oil or gas fired batch kiln /a rotary kiln. The heating rate would<br><br>
be about 20 deg / Minute as the system adopts external heating of the material<br>
The main objective of the posit invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of alumina abrasive grains employing microwave processing.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of alumina abrasive grains having low crystal sizes, high hardness and toughness and density overcoming the drawbacks of the hitherto known processes.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to produce an improved process for the preparation of alumina abrasive grains having Micro Vickers hardness above 2100 kg/ sq. mm, B8% thooretical density with crystalline uniformity and average crystal size less than 0.5 microns.<br>
The invention is based on our finding that it is possible to achieve very low crystal sizes with high hardness , toughness and density using the combination of sol gel and microwave processing.<br>
It is observed during the course of our continued research that as temperature increases above a point, the dielectric loss begins txÂ» increase rapidly and the material begins to absorb microwave more efficiently. This also raises the temperature and causes the dielectric loss to rise even faster.<br><br>
The net result is an exponential increase in temperature. Hence we get high heating rates as high as 300 deg / minute. More over as microwave is employed, the material is heated internally with in the material instead of external heating as in the other cases. Both batch and continuous processing can be employed.<br>
The raw material used in the process of the present invention is bohemia dispersed in water. The concentration may range from 15 to 30 weight percentage. The pH may be adjusted between 2 to 4 by addition of an acid such as nitric acid. The additives such as iron, silicon, titanium, magnesium, yttrium, neodymium, lanthanum etc. maybe added as their hydroxides, oxides or nitrates. The amount of additives may vary from 0.1 to 7 weight percentage when compared as their oxides. Seeding was done using sub-micron alpha alumina seeds preferably in an amount of 0.1 to 2.0% by weight. Drying control chemical additive such as polyethylene glycol may be added in the range of 0.1 to 2.0% to aid in pore free drying. The gel prepared was dried at low temperatures preferably in the range of 40 to 80 deg C. The dried gel is crushed to the required size giving allowance for the shrinkage during sintering. The shape of the grains were modified to suit the end use by selection of a suitable crushing system. The graded gel was calcined In the temperature range of 300 to 900 deg C. This may be done preferably for a period 30 minutes to drive away the volatiles. The calcined grains are then sintered using microwave at temperatures upto 1500 deg C. This comprises exposing the grains to microwave by placing them inside the microwave oven<br><br>
and taking them to temperatures between 1300 and 1500 deg C for a residence time varying between 0 to 60 minutes.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of alumina abrasives using a combination of sol gel and microwave processes which comprises<br>
i) dispersing boehmite ( mono hydroxy aluminium oxide, AlOOH) in water at a temperature in the range of 30 to BO deg C,<br>
U) adjusting the pH of the dispersed system in the range of 2 to 4,<br>
Hi) adding the additives to the system to improve hardness, toughness, sintering temperature, microstructure, etc.,<br>
iv) seeding the resulting system using micronised alpha alumina,<br>
v) drying at a temperature in the range of 40 to 80 deg C,<br>
vi) crushing the dried gel to the desired size and shape,<br>
vii) claiming the crashed gel in temperature range of 300 to 900 deg C for a period ranging form 30 to 120 minutes,<br><br>
viii) sintering the calcined grains by using microwave at temperature below 1500 deg C for a period ranging from 0 to SO minutes.<br>
The microwave oven employed may be equipped with a power control and a timer and produced microwave energy of 2.45 GHz frequency and power out put of 900 W. The calcined grain is placed in the closed insulating chamber, called the microwave packet The insulating material is aluminium silicate based material. An inner chamber of porous Zirconia cylinder is also used, the system ensures heat preservation and high temperature generation. The sheathed thermocouple is introduced for temperature measurement, and placed just near the sample. As a precaution the body of the oven is provided with water cooled tubes. This microwave oven used for batch processing of alumina abrasive grains. For a continuous set up the material is filled in a sintered alumina / or fused quartz tube in the microwave field. The material for sintering is continuously fed from top and sintered alumina grains are drained at the bottom of the tube.<br>
