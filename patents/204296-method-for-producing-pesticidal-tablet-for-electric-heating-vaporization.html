Next, the above premix is treated with diatomaceous earth to give a pesticidal liquid. The step treating the premix with diatomaceous earth can be, for example, performed by the following methods.<br>
(1)	Method of mixing the above premix with diatomaceous earth, allowing it to stand and then separating the generated supernatant.<br>
(2)	Method of mixing the above premix with diatomaceous earth, filtering it and obtaining the filtrate.<br><br>
(3) Method of filtering the above premix with a filter material pre-coated with diatomaceous earth and obtaining the filtrate.<br>
The method for treating the premix with diatomaceous earth includes any combination of these methods. Namely, the obtained liquid by an above-mentioned method may be subjected to another method mentioned above or repeated the treating method. Further, the present method may be mixing the premix with diatomaceous earth, and filtering with a filter material pre-coated with diatomaceous earth and obtaining the filtrate by combining the methods (2) and (3).<br>
Then, the pesticidal liquid obtained above are kept on a fibrous carrier or porous carrier at a rate of 20 to 800mg per 2.2cm3 of the carrier by impregnation or the like and further drying if needed to give the pesticidal tablet for electric heating vaporization of the present invention. In the above description, the volume of the carrier means apparent volume before keeping by impregnation or the like.<br>
Examples of the fibrous carrier used for the present invention include natural fibers such as pulp and cotton linter and synthetic fibers such as polyester and polyacrylate bound for producing a board. Examples of the porous carrier include pottery and ceramic board.<br>
The size of the fibrous carrier or porous carrier used for the present invention is usually in the rage of 2.0-2.5cm3 (e.g. approximately 2.2cmx 3.5cmx0.28cm) at the apparent volume before impregnation of the pesticidal liquid.<br>
In the pesticidal tablet for electric heating vaporization of the present invention, the contents of each component are usually at the ratio of 0.1-500mg of the pyrethroid compound, 0.1-lOmg of the coloring agent and l-600mg of the ester solvent per 2.2cm3 of the pesticidal tablet.<br>
The pesticidal tablet for electric heating vaporization of the present invention obtained above can be utilized by a conventional method for the<br><br>
pesticidal tablet. Namely, the pesticidal tablet ot tne present invention is heated at about 140-180oC on a hot plate set at a place where mosquitoes inhabit or its neighborhood to vaporize the pyrethroid compound as an active ingredient. At that time, the decrease of the active ingredient can be identified as the tablet color fades.<br>
