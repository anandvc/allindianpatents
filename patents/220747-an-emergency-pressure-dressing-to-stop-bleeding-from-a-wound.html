DESCRIPTION OF STATEMENT<br>
According to this invention, an emergency pressure dressing is provided which enables to stop bleeding from wounds. It is a multi purpose dressing, which can be used as a simple dressing, antiseptic dressing or as tourniquet. The male member of locking means is stitched on a piece of bandage which is itself folded around a plastic loop which can be slided along the length of bandage. The female member of locking means is provided on the rear of bandage on the back of adhesive portion. The first wrap of bandage is closed by fastening the movable male member to the fixed female member of locking means. This makes the first wrap of bandage as flexible according to the area of wound to be dressed ranging from small area to large area and also enables to accommodate post-injury swelling. The dressing has at its one end an adhesive portion, adjacent to which a medicated non-stick wound pad of an absorbent material covered with a non-stick lining is provided. Further, the dressing comprising of a housing or a pocket in which a removable pad called ridge is disposed through an opening provided on one side of the pocket. The ridge is inserted in<br><br>
housing (7) when localized pressure is desired to be applied to allow venous blood to return. The ridge (8) is removed when the dressing is to be used as an ordinary dressing.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION WITH RESPECT TO DRAWINGS:<br>
Fig. 1 shows the front view of an emergency pressure dressing for stopping bleeding from wounds. The dressing consists of a wrappable bandage (1) of required length sterilized by gamma rays, preferably, around 2 meters in length. A movable male member (2) of locking means such as loop and hook fastener, is stitched on a piece of bandage which is folded around one side of the loop (3) preferably made of plastic, in such a way that this movable locking means (2) can be slided to an fro along the length of the bandage. By keeping a member of locking means as movable, the first wrap of bandage becomes flexible enough to be applied to any area of wound ranging from a small area to large area and it also enables the dressing to accommodated post-injury swelling. The bandage (1) is preferably made of elastic material or any kind of synthetic rubber.<br>
At one end of the bandage, there is provided an adhesive portion (4) which bears a pressure sensitive adhesive material. The adhesive is kept covered with a removable protective paper to avoid contamination of the adhesive applied thereto. Adjoining to the adhesive portion (4), there is a non-stick wound pad (5) which has a non-stick lining which does not allow the bandage to stick to the wound area. The non-stick wound pad<br><br>
(5) has an absorbent padding (6) made of absorbent material like cotton and the non-stick lining applied thereupon is perforated plastic mesh preferably made of polypropylene. The non-stick wound pad is factory impregnated with suitable antiseptic material preferably povidone iodine or cetypyridinum. Around the middle of non-stick wound pad (5), there is a pocket (7) to house a ridge (8). This ridge (8) is a removable pad which can be introduced or removed in the dressing through an opening provided on one side of pocket (7). When the dressing is to be used for ordinary applications, the removable pad (8) is not inserted into the pocket (7). However when localised pressure is required, this removable pad (8) is introduced into the housing (7), which enables application of the localised pressure to the area of wound instead of applying pressure around the limb, whereby tourniquet effect is avoided and thus allowing the veinous blood to return. It is to be noted that pocket (7) as a housing is provided to support the removable pad (8). However, any support means may be provided like spaced channels to support the<br>
«	'	-—	v<br>
removable pad (8). At the other end of the bandage (1), there are two plastic hooks (9,10) to close the bandage and to prevent it from unfolding after the bandage (1) is completely wrapped around the wound.<br>
Referring to Fig, 2, which shows the rear view of the dressing, there is provided a female member (11) of locking means which is stitched on to the rear side of the dressing. This female member of locking means (11) is stitched on to the back of adhesive portion (4) of the bandage and also covers part of the back side of non-sick wound pad (5). When the bandage is to be wrapped around a wound, adhesive portion is applied to skin around the<br><br><br>
wound and then the movable male member (2) of locking means is slided along the length of the bandage, towards the female member (11) and fastened to the female member (11) with required pressure (Fig.6). The complete bandage is then wrapped around the first wrap made as above, with required pressure.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the detailed view of movable male member (2) of the locking means. This is constructed on a piece of bandage which is folded around the side (a) (fig.4) of the plastic loop (3). On this folded piece of bandage, (12), male member (2) of locking means is stitched leaving around 2cm as unstitched portion (13) on the side of loop (3) so that side (a) of the loop (3) can freely rotate within this unstitched portion (13) of the folded bandage (12).<br>
Fig. 4 shows the preferred construction of the plastic loop (3). The male member (2) of locking means, provided on the bandage folded on side (a), can be slided by holding the side (b) of the plastic loop (3).<br>
Fig. 5 shows the ridge (8), which is the removable pad which can be introduced into the housing (7) when localised pressure is required to be applied to the wound. It is removed through opening provided in the pocket (7) when the dressing is to be used as an ordinary dressing without applying any pressure to the wound. This ridge (8) is made of light weight material like polypropylene, polyethylene. It has smoothened surfaces and could<br><br>
preferably be rectangular parallelepiped shape, preferably with sides tapered down towards the top to facilitate insertion and removal of ridge (8) within the housing (7). The size of ridge (8) is according to the size of pocket (7) so that it fits well into the pocket (7).<br>
METHOD OF USE<br>
For using the dressing of the present invention as a pressure dressing for stopping bleeding form a wound, the medicated non-stick wound pad is placed over the wound, with pocket (7) containing ridge (8) being placed over the bleeding point/area of the wound. The dressing is then fixed on to the skin with the help of adhesive portion (4). As shown in Fig. 6, the movable male member (2) of locking means is slided along the length of the bandage with the help of loop (3) and closed on to the female member (11) of the locking means, with pressure as required. The complete bandage is then wrapped around the wound over the first wrap thus given.<br>
It is to be noted that the present invention is susceptible to adaptations, modifications, and changes by those skilled in the art. Such variant embodiments employing the concepts and features of this invention are intended to be within the scope of the present invention, which is further set forth under the following claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
