				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a securing device and more particularly, but not exclusively, to a securing device suitable for use in removably securing objects to a supporting surface.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
The need often arises to secure objects such as paintings, fittings, decorative articles and the like to vertical surfaces such as walls. Many securing devices have been proposed to satisfy this demand, with a common requirement of such devices being sufficient and reliable load bearing capacity.<br>
A typical prior art securing device includes a hook or other engagement formation that extends from a base, the base being securable to the supporting surface on which the securing device is mounted. The base and hook is often integrally formed, but the hook may also be attached to a flexible adhesive-bearing sheet. An object as described above is then suspended from the hook, thus imparting a downward gravitational force on the hook. The point of contact between the hook and the suspended object is usually spaced apart from the base, and more particularly from a securing surface of the base. 1 he distance between the securing surface of the base and the point where the downward force is imparted results in a moment being induced about the securing surface of the base. The moment about the base translates into forces, perpendicular to the supporting surface, being exerted on the base. At the operatively upper end of the base the force is directed away from the supporting surface, thus constituting a tensile force, whereas the force at the operatively lower end of the base is directed towards the supporting surface, thus constituting a compressive force.<br>
In many instances a load applied to the hook or engagement formation is not parallel relative to the base of the securing device, and may for instance be directed at an angle, away from the supporting surface. In this case the exerted force will be in the form of a force vector having both vertical and horizontal components. The horizontal component of this force vector will then also contribute to the tensile forces exerted on the base.<br>
it will be appreciated that due to the above configurations, an adhesive medium used to secure the base to the supporting surface, and more particularly an adhesive film<br>
 <br>
located on the adhesive medium, is exposed to tensile stress due to the tensile force at the upper end of the base, as well as shear stress due to the gravitational force. This combination of forces adversely affects the load capacity of the adhesive medium, which is substantially lower than it would be if the adhesive medium were exposed to pure tension or pure shear.<br>
Some solutions have been proposed to alleviate this problem, as is for instance disclosed in Dutch patent NL1028204 in the name of Peer Schools te Gemert ("Gemert Patent"). The Gemert patent shows a securing device having a first securing member in the form of a pin to be inserted into a wall, or into a gap between adjacent tiles, and a second securing member in the form of an adhesive member. The aim of the securing device is to prevent the adhesive member from being loaded in shear, but in order to achieve the same the pin must either be secured in the wall, or located in an aperture provided in the wall. It will be appreciated that it is often not desirable and/or practical to make an aperture in a wall or other supporting surface. Furthermore, existing apertures, such as the gap between adjacent tiles, usually do<br>
not exist Also, if the pin is secured in the wall as envisaged in the Gemert patent, a moment and large local forces will be induced in the wall surface about the pin. which may very likely damage the wall surface. In use, the outcome of resultant forces on the two securing members is quite unpredictable, depending entirely on the nature of the securing surface. Similar disadvantages are foreseen insofar as the securing devices disclosed in CH670366 Freimann and GB2373287 Story are concerned<br>
Many other securing devices, including those disclosed in DE8625361 Pagenberg. DE9108687 Westphal. DE29821567 Pagenberg and US2724568 Rabmovitch, have been proposed wherein the securing device includes more than one adhesive securing member However, in none of these cases is the securing device configured for tensile and shear forces to be separated, in order for each securing member only to be exposed to tensile or shear stresses.<br>
The problem of reduced load capacity is further exacerbated by the presence of peel loading and cleavage loading, which are described, and for the purposes of this specification defined, below<br>
 <br>
Peel loading typically occurs when the following conditions apply:<br>
•	The adhesive medium is carried by a base that is relatively flexible in bending.<br>
•	The base is subjected to a tensile force in a direction away from the surface to which it is bonded, i.e. there is a force component normal to the surface;<br>
•	The backing is sufficiently flexible in bending to bend under the tensile force, and<br>
•	The base is stronger in tension than the peel strength of the adhesive bond<br>
Under these conditions, the energy transmitted by the base as a result of the tensile force is focused on a line of high stress at the location where the backing is separating from the surface. The applied force is focused on this single bonding line, thus resulting in high-energy concentration, and adhesive failure in a progressive manner<br>
Cleavage is somewhat similar to peel, but occurs when the base is relatively rigid, so as not to bend or flex perceptibly under the applied loading However, a tensile force component normal to the surface is still present, and cleavage occurs when this tensile force is not uniformly distributed over the bond area under the backing. Moreover, cleavage loading situations are characterised in that the backing is usually not completely parallel to the surface to which it is bonded, or it is not constrained to remain parallel As a consequence of the non-uniform distribution of the pulling force or the non-parallel orientation or both, there will be places where the tensile stress in the adhesive bond peaks at its highest value If the tensile stress exceeds the local adhesive bond strength at any point, the adhesive bond may fail at that point and run in a progressive manner through the entire adhesive bond under the rigid backing In structures under static loading, once localised failure in the adhesive bond has started, the stress in the remaining adhesive bond increases, since progressively less bonded area remains to bear the load. Cleavage failure therefore typically starts off slowly and increases in tempo as failure progresses.<br>
It is clear from the above that cleavage and peel loading are undesirable where a durable adhesive bond is required. For maximum strength, cleavage and peel loading should thus be avoided as far as possible. If there is any possibility that a peel or<br>
 <br>
cleavage process may occur in a product where adhesive bond strength is important. such a product may be prone to premature failure.<br>
In addition to the need for high load bearing capacity, it is also preferable for a securing device to be easily removable from a surface on which it has been mounted, without damaging such surface. The well-known standard double-sided tape, comprising a backing material having adhesive films on opposing surfaces thereof, is often used as an adhesive medium for securing devices. However, removal of standard double-sided tape often proves to be troublesome because the backing material of the double-sided tape, usually comprising an elastomeric foam, tends to tear or break, thus preventing the double-sided tape from being removed as an intact section of tape. In addition, the bond between the double-sided tape and the supporting surface is often strong enough to result in the supporting surface being damaged when the securing device mounted by double-sided tape is pulled from the supporting surface.<br>
Several patents, including US 5,409J89 Luhmann. US 5,984.247 luhmann. US 5.989 JOS Kreckel and US 6,001.471 Bries. disclose the use of so-called stretch release double-sided tape in providing removable securing devices. Stretch release double-sided tape is a special type of double-sided tape, and is commercially available from companies such as Beiersdorf AG and 3M. Stretch release double- sided tape involves the progressive, controlled destruction of the adhesive bond on both adhesive sides of the double-sided tape when the tape is firmly pulled at one end of the tape along its length. As the tape material stretches, the adhesive bond is broken in progressive manner until the tape is fully stretched and the adhesive bond completely broken, thus releasing the securing device from the wall.<br>
However, stretch release tapes are beset with numerous problems, which are inter alia documented in the above patent specifications. A first problem is that the backing material may tear betbre the adhesive bond is completely broken. When the backing material, and thus the tape, tears, it becomes almost impossible to remove<br>
the securing device without damaging the surface on which it is mounted. Ageing of the tape increases the risk of tearing, as well as excessive pressure applied by a user onto the securing device as the user holds it during removal. A further problem is that<br>
 <br>
the tape may exhibit a substantial amount of recoil when the securing device is released. This recoil action may easily cause physical injury to a person trying to remove the securing device.<br>
As described hereinbefore, some securing devices utilise an adhesive-bearing sheet that bonds the securing device to the supporting surface. The adhesive-bearing sheet typically comprises some sort of backing material having an adhesive film on at least one surface thereof. In use the adhesive-bearing sheet is amongst others, subjected lo a force component substantially parallel to the supporting surface and the adhesive-bearing sheet so as to result in a shear loading, and thus shear stress, in the adhesive bond between the adhesive-bearing sheet and the supporting surface. One problem associated with existing adhesive-bearing sheets is that the backing material is often not sufficiently rigid to ensure uniform distribution of the shear loading over the entire adhesive film, which may result in excessive stretching of the backing material which causes non-uniform loading and thus premature failure of the adhesive bonds.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to the drawings, in which like numerals indicate like features, embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of non-limiting examples, in which a securing device is generally indicated by reference numeral 10<br>
The securing device, as shown in figures 1 to 3. comprises a base 20 that is mountable on a supporting surface 15. The base 20 has a loading region, typically in the form of a receiving formation 28 for receiving the object or alternatively attachment means for attaching the object, where a loading force is applied to the base when in use an object (not shown) is mounted on the supporting surface 15 by the securing device 10. The securing device also includes a first securing member 30 and a second securing member 50 and is configured such that a first component of the resultant force (Ry) is exerted on the first securing member 30 and is substantially perpendicular to a second component (Rx)  of the  force exerted  on the second securing member 50.  This<br>
 <br>
distribution of force components results in the first securing member 30 to be loaded in shear (S) and the second securing member 50 to be loaded in tension (N). The base 20 is pivotable connected to the first securing member 30 so as to transmit a force to the first securing member 30 substantially without inducing a moment about the first securing member 30. A compressive force, directed substantially perpendicular to the supporting surface 15. may be exerted on the first securing member 30 by the base 20. and more particularly by the pivot point of the base 20. The compressive force may not be distributed to the rest of the first securing member 30. and may remain a local force focused on the area where the pivot point of the base 20 engages the supporting surface 15. It should be noted that compressive forces are not of concern from a load bearing and reliability point of view, as long as there are no oppositely directed tensile forces present.<br>
I he base 20 is generally planar and includes an operatively upper end 22 as well as an operatively lower end 24. The base 20 can be of many different configurations, depending on the particular embodiment of the securing device 10. However, in the specific embodiments depicted in the specification the base 20 includes a receiving formation 28 as well as an edge 26 suitable for pivotably engaging the first securing member 30.<br>
The receiving formation 28 can be of many different variations. In figure 1 the receiving formation is in the form of a hook-like extension extending from the upper end 22 of the base 20. Figure 8 shows a different embodiment wherein a hook-like formation extends from a lower end 24 of the base. Other embodiments include an extension profiled complimentary to an object to be secured as seen in figure 12, a rigid loop as seen in figure 13, a flexible loop as shown in figure 14 as well as a knob-formation as shown in figures 15 and 16. It will also be appreciated that an upper edge 27 of the base can also be used as receiving formation when the object to be secured (not shown) has a hook formation extending there from.<br>
The securing device 10 includes a first securing member 30, with the base 20 and the first securing member 30 being pivotably connected. Referring to figures 2 and 3. the first securing member 30 includes a body 31 in the form of a planar section of sheet material and an adhesive medium 32 located on a surface of the body 31.<br>
 <br>
The adhesive medium 32 can be in the form of double-side tape as shown in figure β but it can also be in the form of a thin adhesive film or lamination provided on a surface of the sheet-like body 31 of the first securing member.<br>
The first securing member 30 is adapted to pivotably engage the base 20. and more particularly a lower edge 26 of the base. In figure 3 a lower end of the sheet-like body 31 defines an engagement formation 34. The lower end is folded back and attached to the base, in order for the lower edge 26 of the base 20 to locate in the elongate channel so formed, thus providing a pivotable connection. In a further embodiment shown in figure 7 the engagement formation 34 is in the form of a receiving formation extending from a lower end of the first securing member 30, The receiving formation includes an aperture of semi-circular profile being complimentary shaped to the lower edge 26 of the base, thus allowing the base to pivot in the aperture, In the particular embodiment the aperture is located in the receiving formation, but it will be appreciated that the inverse would also suffice. It will be appreciated that the pivotable connection between the base and the first securing member 30 may take many other forms.- but the overriding principle is that the base 20 is connected to the first securing member 30 in such a way that a downward force is transmitted without inducing a moment about the first securing member 30.<br>
For reasons that will become apparent later on. the first securing member 30 may also include a displacement zone 39 as shown in figure 4. the displacement zone 39 divides the first securing member in a primary section 37 and a secondary section 38, and allows the primary section 37 to be displaced without the displacement being carried over to the secondary section 38. A downward shearing force imparted on the primary section 37 will thus not be conveyed to the secondary section 38. The displacement zone 39 may adopt many different configurations such as a pleat 40 formed in the first securing member as shown in figure 4a or a plurality of perforations 41 forming a weakened zone as shown in figure 4b. Alternatively, as shown in figure 4c, the primary section 37 and the secondary section 38 of the first securing member may be separate from one another, and a bridging member 42 may connect the two sections so as to define the displacement zone 39.<br>
 <br>
The first securing member 30 may furthermore include guiding means 45 for assisting a user to correctly orientate the securing device 10 when the device is mounted on a supporting surface 15. In this embodiment the guiding means 45, shown in figure 4. is in the form of triangular apertures or notches provided in edges of the first securing member 30. The first securing member may furthermore include splitting formations 47 as shown in figure 11. The splitting formations 47, in this embodiment in the form of linear slits, assist a user to tear the first securing member 30 into separate strips when the securing device 10. and more particularly the first securing member 30 is removed form the supporting surface 15. Alternatively, the first securing member may utilise an adhesive being formulated to be removable without being destroyed during removal, and thus also to be reusable. The first securing member may for instance be peeled from the supporting surface by pulling at an edge of the securing member. In this case the splitting formations 47 will not be required, as the purpose will be to remove the first securing member 30 as an intact unit that can be reused.<br>
The second securing member 50, best seen in figure 3, includes a body 52 having an adhesive layer 54 provided on a surface thereof. Alternatively, the second securing member 50 may be in the form of a magnet being attachable to a magnetic surface. The second securing member 50 may be connected to the base 20 in a number of ways. Figures 2 and 3 show the second securing member 50 being directly secured to the base, whereas figure 6 includes a rigid connection 56 between the second securing member 50 and the base 20. In figure 5 the second securing member 50 is connected or connectable to the base by means of a flexible connector 56, which is rigid in tension. The flexible connector may for instance be a chain or a cord.<br>
The base 20, first securing member 30 and second securing member 50 may be configured in a number of ways, which all satisfy the basic requirements of this invention, A primary distinction can be made between a configuration where the first securing member 30 and the second securing member 50 are spaced apart but adjacent one another when the securing device 10 is mounted on the supporting surface 15. and a configuration where the second securing member 50 overlies and is mounted on the first securing member 30. One embodiment of the first configuration is shown in figure 1 . wherein the first securing member 30 extends upwardly from the lower end 24 of the base 20, but ends short of the second securing member 50 that is connected to an<br>
 <br>
upper end 22 of the base. In this configuration the first securing member 30 and the second securing member 50 are independently secured to the supporting surface. Further non-exhaustive embodiments of this configuration are shown in figures 8 to I 1 which all disclose the same basic configuration, but with different relative orientations of the first securing members 30 relative to the second securing members 50, with the base 20 also adopting the shape required to give effect to the required orientations.<br>
An example of the second configuration is shown in figure 4. In this configuration the second securing member 50 is mounted on the secondary section 38 of the first securing member 30. Downward forces, and thus shear stresses, on the primary section 37 of the first securing member 30 are not carried over to the secondary section 38 of the first securing member 30, due to the displacement zone 39 allowing for displacement of the primary section 37. This configuration ensures that the secondary section 38 is not exposed to the vertical component of the force vector acting on the securing device 10, and thus remains in pure tension. An additional benefit of this configuration is that the securing device 10 can more easily be removed without damaging the supporting surface, since the secondary section provides protection to the supporting surface when the second securing member is being removed.<br>
A further example of the second configuration involves a layout similar to that shown in Figure 4, but wherein the second securing member 50 is secured to the first securing member 30 by means other than an adhesive, such as for example by welding, The second securing member 50 may also be integrally made with the first securing member 30. In this instance the second securing member 50 may not be readily distinguishable from the first securing member 30. but a securing device configured in this manner would still embody the invention without deviating from the fundamental principles.<br>
In use an object (not shown) is suspended from the receiving formation 28 extending from or located in the base 20. The object exerts a loading force on the receiving formation, the composition and direction of which will vary according to the particular application. If an object is hanged from the securing device, the loading force will be predominantly gravitational, and will be directed in the direction Ry. A force in the direction Rx will also be induced due to a moment being induced about the second<br>
 <br>
securing member 50 because of the receiving formation being spaced apart from the supporting surface. However, if the securing device is used to retain an object relative to a supporting surface the force may be a vector in a direction R. which will then have components in directions Rx and Ry. An additional force in the direction Ry may again be present due to the induced moment.<br>
Irrespective of the application, it will be apparent that a resultant force R will be present, the force R having horizontal (or tensile) Rx and vertical (or shear) Ry components. These force components are substantially perpendicular, and will result in equal but opposite forces in the two securing members, A tensile force N, normal to the supporting surface, will be present in the second securing member 50, and will result in tensile stresses in the second securing member 50. The second securing member 50 will be substantially free from shear stresses, and the second securing member 50 will be subjected to pure tension. A shearing force S, parallel to the supporting surface, will be present in the first securing member 30. and will result in shear stresses in the first securing member 30. the first securing member 30 will be substantially free from tensile stresses, and the first securing member 30 will be subjected to pure shear.<br>
Although it is not a preferred embodiment, the inventor foresees that the normal force N may be slightly angularly displaced relative to a true normal plane extending from the supporting surface This may for instance result from use of a base having an angularly offset end section together with a wedge-shaped second securing member being locatable between the supporting surface and the angularly offset end section Although this configuration is not optimal, it is foreseen that it will also serve the primary function of substantially separating the force vector acting on the securing device in two discreet, substantially perpendicular force components.<br>
In the examples shown in figures 3 and 9a the base 20 is pivotably connected to the first securing member 30. so as to be pivotable about a fulcrum defined by a section of the base pressing against the first securing member 30 or supporting surface 15 This configuration allows for the downward or parallel force S to be carried over to the first securing member, but no moment is induced about the first securing member 30 due to the connection being freely pivotable. Also, no forces directed away from the supporting surface 15 are present. The first securing member 30 therefore only needs to<br>
 <br>
oppose the downward or parallel force S. and the adhesive bond is not exposed to tensile stresses that may result in peeling of the first securing member It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that the most beneficial location for a fulcrum formation is typically towards or at the bottom of the base, but that the fulcrum may be located anywhere on the base provided that no moment is induced, and that no force directed away from the base is present when a load is applied to the securing device.<br>
The upper end 22 of the pivoting base 20 is secured to the supporting surface 15 by way of the second securing member 50. Since the shear force S is borne by the first securing member, the force N exerted by the base 20 on the second securing member 50 is purely normal, and thus results only in tensile stresses in the adhesive bond of the second securing member Importantly, an inner face 25 of the base is parallel to the supporting surface 15 so as to ensure that the second securing member only needs to oppose normal forces, and thus to prevent peel or cleavage If the connection between the second securing member 50 and the base 20 is by way of a flexible connector 55, as shown in figure 5, it is not critical that the inner face 25 be parallel to the supporting surface, as long as the connector 55, when in use, is substantially normal to the second securing member 50. It will be appreciated that the base furthermore need not be as rigid in this embodiment.<br>
The principle remains the same irrespective of the location of the receiving formation 28 on the base 20 However, if the receiving formation is located towards the lower end 24 of the base 20. the pivot formation 29, as seen in figures 9a and 9b, may be located above the receiving formation The normal force N is therefore transmitted to the second securing member 50 by way of the pivotable base.<br>
Figures 15 and 16 show further embodiments of the invention wherein the base includes a plurality of edges being connected to the first securing member 30. I his allows the securing device 10 to be exposed to forces in various directions whilst still maintaining the same functionality as described hereinbefore The securing device of figure 15 can for instance be used to anchor objects to a substantially horizontal support surface. It will be appreciated that the overriding principle in all the embodiments and configurations shown is that the force vector exerted on the securing device 10 is separated into a shear force component being substantially parallel to the supporting<br>
 <br>
surface, and a tensile force being substantially perpendicular to the supporting surface The two forces are opposed or restrained by two separate and functionally independent securing members, thus preventing the securing members from being exposed to shear and tension simultaneously, and more importantly also preventing the occurrence of peel and/or cleavage. An additional advantage is that the securing device can more easily be removed, especially in the embodiment as shown in figure 4.<br>
In further examples of the invention the first securing member 30 and the second securing member 50 may be kinematicaly decoupled. This means that there may be limited relative displacement between certain components of the securing device, without thereby departing from the fundamental principles set out above. Firstly, limited rotation may be allowed between the upper end 22 and lower end 24 of the base 20. Functionally such rotation will be between a Fulcrum line of the base 20 relative to the first securing member 30 and the second securing member 50. Similarly, there may be limited rotation between the base 20 itself and the second securing member 50. Secondly, limited translation may be allowed between the base 20 and the second securing member 50. Thirdly, there may be a combination of the above degrees of freedom (e.g. combined limited rotation and translation).<br>
In order to optimise the functionality of the invention, the first securing member 30, as utilized in all embodiments, has specific performance characteristics, although the invention will still be effective if these characteristics are not strictly adhered to. Firstly, the body 31 is capable of distributing a pure shear loading in a substantially uniform manner over the adhesive film 32 along the length of the first securing member 30. The shear loading is caused by force S applied to the first securing member 30 in a direction parallel to a supporting surface 15. Secondly, the body 31 is stable in performing this near-uniform distribution over the life of the product, even if the loading persists continually. This consistent, near-uniform loading optimises performance of the adhesive by spreading the load over all of the adhesive on the first securing member 30, and maintains the near-uniform distribution consistently over a long period of time. In one embodiment the first securing member backing may be made of a metallic sheet that provides long term protection of the adhesive layer for extended durability of the bond under continuous high loading.<br>
 <br>
It is important that the body 20 remains stable, and thus preserves its shape, during extended long-term continuous loading so as to prevent the occurrence of cleavage and peeling on the securing members as a consequence of the body changing shape. To enable the same, the body may be made from a material with high stiffness and that does not creep significantly under long-term stress such as for instance a metal, a ceramic or carbon fibre, or it may be made from suitable composite materials. During design and experimental work it was found that the body is generally of sufficient rigidity for this particular application if the material used has a Young's modulus of at least 10GPa (giga Pascal). If the Young's modulus is in excess of 10GPa. it is furthermore possible to provide improved built-in characteristics in the body design, such as for example utilising a body that is substantially flat against the wall when in use. The material used must preferably have a Young's modulus of more than 2(mpa. and more preferably in excess of 50Gpa.<br>
Most regular adhesive tapes have a backing of unfilled elastomeric material, which is not sufficiently still for the purposes of the first securing member 30. Stiffness (Young's) modulus values for unfilled elastomerics range between about 7 MPa to about 3000 MPa. and even the stiffest of these materials would stretch by more than 150 microns in a typical application of the invention. The adhesive film thickness of typical adhesive tapes range between about 20 microns and about 120 microns. If stretch of the body 31 of the first securing member 30 is limited to the thickness of the adhesive film 32. the shear strain in the adhesive does not vary excessively throughout the length of the tape<br>
Stretch in the body 31 of the first securing member 30, in use, is given by:<br>
Δh- 1/2*( F/A )*(h/E) where<br>
Ah is the amount of stretch in the body 31 of the first securing member 30, F is the force applied at the end of the body 31 of the first securing member 30, A is the cross-sectional area of the body 31 of the first securing member 30. h is the length of the body 31 of the first securing member 30, and E is the Young's modulus of the body 3 1 of the first securing member 30<br>
 <br>
It has been found that if the stretch Ah has a value no more than the thickness of the adhesive used on the first securing member 30, the first securing member 30 performs very well.<br>
As mentioned above, another advantageous feature of this invention is that the securing device 10 can easily be removed from a supporting surface 15 without damaging the supporting surface 15. this functionality is in part a result of the configuration of the second securing member 50 relative to the first securing member 30 shown in figure 4 However, the composition of the second securing member 50 also contributes towards ease of removal of the securing device 10, irrespective of the securing device being of the configuration where the first securing member 30 and the second securing member are spaced apart but adjacent one another when the securing device 10 is mounted on the supporting surface 15, or the configuration where the second securing member 50 overlies and is mounted on the first securing member 30 More particularly, it was found that for the second securing member 50 to be more easily removable, it must have a backing sheet having a Young's modulus of at least 1000 MPa (mega Pascal). Preferably, the backing sheet must<br>
have a Young's modulus of more than 2000 MPa (mega Pascal). More preferably, the backing sheet must have a Young's modulus of more than 5000 MPa (mega Pascal).<br>
It is also foreseen that, due to the characteristics identified above, the second securing member can be used independently form the first securing member to secure objects to supporting surfaces, in this application the second securing member will typically include double-sided tape as referred to above, with backing sheets as defined above provided on both sides of the double-sided tape. The backing sheets are secured to opposite sides of the double sided tape, and the other sides of the backing sheets are secured to the supporting surface and object to be secured respectively, the sandwich like connection so formed can be assembled in any required order. A backing sheet may also be provided on only one side of the double-sided tape, as the object to be secured may for instance be secured directly to the double-sided tape.<br>
In removing the above securing arrangement, the first step will be to cut through the body of the double sided-tape. Once the body has been separated, the backing sheets<br>
 <br>
can be removed from the supporting surface and the object previously secured respectively.<br>
Many possible uses are foreseen for the securing device described hereinbefore. The uses can primarily be categorized as permanent use (where the securing device is not intended to be removed), semi-permanent use (where the securing device may be removed at any time, but with the intention that it can also remain in place for extended periods), and temporary use (where the securing device is used for short periods such as hours or days, but at relatively high loadings).<br>
Some specific applications include the following: Home. Office and Workplace environment:<br>
-	Hangers for pictures, mirrors, wall-hangings, artworks;<br>
-	Mountings / hangers for small appliances such as hairdryers, intercom handsets. cellular phones and chargers therefore, mixers, power tools, air conditioning controllers;<br>

-	Outdoor applications such as rock-climbing anchors and use in a camping<br>
environment.<br>
it is also foreseen that the securing device can be used on non-flat surfaces such as car dashboards, car panels, pillars and lamp posts.<br>
It will be appreciated that the above are only some embodiments of the invention, and that there may be many variations in detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
To name a few non-exhaustive examples, the receiving formation on the base may be of many different variations. In addition to those described above, the receiving formation may for instance also be in the form of a magnet, some adhesive bonding means, or any type of flexible attachment means.<br>
The engagement between the base and the first securing member may furthermore be of any type that allows the base to pivot relative to the first securing member, such as for example a hinge connection.<br>
The base itself may be of any suitable shape, in addition to the disclosed shapes also including T-, U-, O or X-shaped.<br>
Yet a further variation of the invention may provide for the second securing member to be of a multi-component structure wherein the second securing member comprises a plurality of smaller components that are linked to the base by way of interconnecting means. This configuration will be especially advantageous when the securing device is used on non-flat surfaces, as the plurality of smaller surfaces will<br>
 <br>
result in a reduction of any local cleavage loading on the adhesive resulting from the use of the securing device on a non-flat surface.<br>
