BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a<br>
 steam generator.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
The number of burners fixed to a steam generator (boiler) that burns a fossil fuel such as heavy oil, coal or fuel gas and generates steam by combustion heat are increased as a device becomes large in size. The arrangement of the burners are roughly classified into the front firing system in which the fossil fuel is burned from the front wall of the boiler as shown in Figs. 14(a) and 14(b), the opposed burning system in which the fossil fuel is burned from the front and back walls of the boiler as shown in Figs. 15(a) and 15(b), and the whirling burning system in which the fossil fuel is blown from the corner portions of a furnace toward the center thereof as shown in Figs. 16(a) and 16(b).<br>
Among them, the whirling burning system, as shown in Fig. 16(b), blows a fuel and a combustion air tangentially to a virtual circle in the center of the furnace, to thereby form a whirling flame in the center of the furnace. As a result, in the whirling burning system, combustion is stabilized, the load of the furnace is made relatively uniform, and the quantity of generated NOx is<br><br>
reduced. Burner boxes of this system, as shown in Figs. 16(a) and<br>
17,	are arranged vertically and longitudinally.<br>
The furnace is arranged and assembled, as shown in Fig.<br>
18,	so that a large number of generating tubes are connected by<br>
welding through a fin into a panel-like shape, and those<br>
generating tubes are vertically arranged and assembled. A boiler<br>
water is elevated within the generating tubes and absorb a heat<br>
generated within the furnace.<br>
In the variable pressure operation boiler that operates at a supercritical pressure at the time of a high load and at a subcritical pressure at the time of a low load, a gas-liquid two-phase flow mixing water with steam is produced in a high thermal load zone within the generating tube at the time of the low load, resulting in a film boiling phenomenon where the temperature of a tube wall is unstabilized, which may damage the generating tube. Therefore, up to now, there have been proposed a method of stabilizing the temperature of the tube wall by stirring a fluid within the tube at the time of the low load, using a so-called rifle tube which is a tube having a specific structure having spiral projections inside as shown in Fig. 19, and a method of stabilizing the temperature of the tube wall in which the generating tubes of the furnace in the high thermal load zone are inclined by about 30° with respect to the horizon, as shown in Fig. 20, and the number of the generating tubes at that portion is reduced to increase a flow rate within the tubes.<br><br>
In the conventional furnace shown in Fig. 18, because fuel, the boiler load, the position of the burner under use, and so on are different, the distribution of the thermal load within the furnace is always changed. As a result, the distribution of the thermal absorption for each vertical tube disposed on the peripheral wall of the furnace is largely different to the degree of from 60% to 140%, as indicated by a broken line in Fig. 11. Therefore, there is the possibility that the metal temperature at the outlet of the furnace wall is largely unbalanced. This tendency is not so different even though the level within the furnace is different.<br>
In case of the furnace using the inclined generating tube shown in Fig. 20, since the inclined generating tube is elevated with the furnace wall being in the spiral shape, the fluctuation of the distribution of the thermal load within the furnace is made uniform. However, since the weight of the furnace wall cannot be supported by the furnace wall tube per se, a specific pendant plate is necessarily used. Also, since the number of tubes is increased twice at a portion where the inclined generating tube is shifted to the vertical tube, a breeches pipe is used as shown in Fig. 21, or the tubes are necessarily connected by a communication header, resulting in a complicated structure.<br>
On the other hand, in the case where the burner wind boxes are vertically and longitudinally arranged as in the conventional device, since a certain specific generating pipe at the burner<br><br>
portion does not receive the radiation heat of the furnace gas over the entire length at all the time, and another specific generating pipe always receives a high thermal load, there occurs a large difference in thermal absorption at the outlet of the furnace as shown in Fig. 12, whereby a large thermal stress is exerted on the furnace wall by an unbalance of temperature generated between the tubes that form the furnace wall, with the result that the furnace wall is destroyed.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made to solve the above-mentioned problem, and therefore an object of the present invention is to provide a steam generator which is operated under both of the supercritical pressure and the subcritical pressure having generating tubes that form a furnace wall, in which upper and lower generating tubes are directed vertically, and the central generating tubes are inclined by 10 to 35° with respect to a vertical line, as first solving means.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a steam generator which is operated under both of the supercritical pressure and the subcritical pressure, in which a burner wind box is inclined along the inclination of said generating tubes and divided into a plurality of upper and lower stages, as second solving means.<br><br>
In the above first solving means, since the vertically central ones of the generating tubes that form the furnace wall are inclined by 10 to 35° with respect to a vertical line, the respective generating tubes extend over the central portion having a large thermal absorption and the corner portions having a small thermal absorption in the width direction of the furnace wall. Hence, the thermal absorption of the respective generating tubes is made uniform, to thereby reduce the unbalance of temperature at the outlet of the furnace wall.<br>
Then, since the inclined angle is small, it is not required that the number of tubes is changed between the upper and lower portions and the central portion of the furnace wall as in the conventional spiral wind boiler, and the pitches of tubes are merely slightly changed. Hence, it is unnecessary to use a breeches pipe or a communication pipe. Also, since the inclined angle is small, the self-weight of the inclined generating pipe can be supported by itself, thereby requiring no specific pendant fitting or the like.<br>
In the above second solving means, since the burner wind box is further inclined along the inclination of said generating tubes, the burner fixing positions are dispersed horizontally, and the thermal load is leveled. Also, since the burner wind box is divided into two upper and lower stages or three stages, the generating tubes disposed at the burner position can be dispersed<br><br>
so that the thermal absorption of the respective generating tubes is fiirther leveled.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a steam generate which is operated under both of the supercritical pressure and the subcritical pressure having generating tubes that form a fiimace wall, said steam generator is characterized by comfHising: upper and IOWCT gei^rating tubes vMch are directed vertically; and central generating tubes which are inclined by 10 to 35" with respect to a vertical line.<br><br>
The above and other objects and features of the present invention will be more apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Hereinafter,  a description will be given of the embodiments of the present invention with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
A first embodiment of the present invention will be described.<br>
In this embodiment, generating tubes that form a furnace wall 1 is so arranged that lower generating tubes 2 and upper generating tubes 4 are directed vertically, and central generating tubes 3 are inclined by 15° with respect to the<br><br>
vertical line. The distribution of a heat absorption within a furnace in a vertical direction, as shown in Fig. 10, has a high heat load band of from the position of a lowermost stage burner to the upper part of the uppermost stage burner. Therefore, in this embodiment, the upper portion of the furnace having a low heat absorption coefficient and the generating tubes 4 and 2 of from the furnace bottom to the lower portion of a burner wind box are located vertically, and the generating tubes 3 is located with an inclined angle of about 15° in a burner zone of a high heat absorption.<br>
Subsequently, a description will be given of the pitches of the generating pipes, the diameter of the pipes and a fin width in accordance with this embodiment with reference to Fig. 3. The lower generating pipe 2 is 28.6 mm in the outer diameter of the tuber and 44.5 mm in the pitches of the tube because a specific volume of fluid in the tube is small. Also, the fin width of the lower generating pipe 2 is 15.9 mm. The central generating tube 3 is 28.6 mm in the outer diameter, similarly, but 43.0 mm (44.5 mm X cos 15°) in the pitches of the tube and 14.4 mm in fin width. The upper generating tube 4 is increased in the outer diameter to 31.8 mm, and 44.5 mm in pitch as in the lower generating tube, and 12.7 in fin width. As a result, the distribution of the entire flow rate can be more readily adjusted.<br>
In this embodiment, since the burner zone (the central portion in the height direction of the furnace wall) highest in<br><br>
the heat load is made up of the generating tubes which are inclined by about 15° with respect to the vertical line, the accumulating total of the furnace heat absorption is made remarkably uniform. In other words, as indicated by a solid line in Fig. 11, it has been found as a result of a simulation calculation that the accumulating total of the furnace heat absorption is 120% at the maximum and 80% at the minimum, which are within the unbalance of about 1/2 of the conventional one, and thus it has been proved that the effect of restraining the unbalance of temperature is large.<br>
It has been proved through the experience that the heat absorption pattern of the furnace has the nearly same inclination between the lower portion of the furnace to the vicinity of the upper portion of the burner. In the width direction of the furnace wall, in the corner firing burner, the heat absorption pattern is of the nearly symmetric distribution such that the heat absorption is highest at the central portion of the respective furnace walls and low at the right and left corner portions. Therefore, when the furnace wall is made up of the generating tubes that are inclined by 15° with respect to the vertical line, the respective generating tubes are moved in the lateral direction by about 1/2 of the furnace width from the lower portion to the upper portion of the furnace. In other words, since one generating tube passes through both of a zone large in<br><br>
heat absorption and a zone small in heat absorption, the heat absorption is made uniform.<br>
In the case where the central generating tubes in the vertical direction as in this embodiment are inclined by 15° with respect to the vertical line, since a difference in pitch between the inclined tubes and the vertical tubes is slight, that is, 3.4% as indicated in the above-mentioned dimensional example, the inclined tubes and the vertical tubes can be connected with no use of a breeches pipe or a communication tube. Also, compared with the conventional inclined generating tube that is inclined by 30° with respect to the horizon as shown in Fig. 20, in this embodiment, since the stress to the vertical load is reduced to about 1/2, there is not required a specific pendant plate which has been conventionally used for reducing the stress applied to the furnace wall tube.<br>
The inclined angle with respect to the vertical line of the inclined generating tube in accordance with the present invention can be set to a range of from 10° to 35° in practical use. If it is less than 10°, the effect of correcting nonuniformity of the distribution of the heat load is lost, and if it exceeds 35°, the inclined pipe cannot support the weight itself.<br>
Next, a second embodiment of the present invention will be described.<br><br>
similarly to the above-mentioned first embodiment, in the second embodiment, generating tubes that form a furnace wall Lis so arranged that lower generating tubes 2 and upper generating tubes 4 are directed vertically, and central generating tubes 3 are inclined by 15° with respect to the vertical line. In this embodiment, additionally, a burner wind box 5 is inclined along the inclination of the above generating tubes 3 and vertically divided into three stages. The burner wind box 5 is arranged such that the center of the divided burner wind box 5 is on the nearly same vertical line. Hence, although the positions of the respective burners in the horizontal direction are different from each other, a fuel and a fuel air are injected from the respective burners toward the tangent to a virtual circle 6 with the horizontal cross-section in the center of the furnace. Also, the fuel and air nozzles are so structured as to be tilted vertically by ±30° along the plane which is inclined by 15°.<br>
As described above, in this embodiment, since the burner wind box 5 is vertically divided into three stages and inclined<br><br>
at an angle of 15° with respect to the vertical line, the burner fitting positions are different from each other in the horizontal direction of the furnace wall. Since the heat load of the burner level is high in the vicinity of a burner outlet, when injection portion is moved, the heat load tends to be leveled.<br>
Also, in the vicinity of the burner portion, tubes that do not receive a radiation heat generated within the furnace comes close to tubes that largely receive the radiation heat, there occurs a difference in temperature between those tubes. However, in this embodiment, since the center of the respective wind box 5 which is divided into a plurality of stages is disposed at the same distance from the side edge of the furnace wall and inclined by 15° with respect to the vertical line, the generating pipes that largely receive the radiation heat of the respective wind boxes and the generating pipes that do not receive the radiation heat are different, respectively, to thereby reduce the difference in temperature at the outlet of the furnace wall. In other words, the conventional device has a large nonuniform of 60 to 140% in the width direction of the furnace at the outlet of the furnace as shown in Fig. 12, whereas this embodiment remarkably improves to 85 to 120% as shown in Fig. 13. Hence, the unbalance of the metal temperature at the outlet of the furnace wall is further reduced, and the stress of the furnace wall is remarkably reduced.<br><br>
Moreover, in this embodiment, as a result that the wind box 5 is inclined along the inclination of the generating tubes 3 as described above, the bending of the tube at the burner portion is facilitated.<br>
Further, since the fuel and air nozzles of this embodiment can be tilted vertically ±30°, the burner is directed horizontally or downwardly when the boiler is at a high load, and upwardly from the viewpoint of controlling the steam temperature when it is at a low load. When the burner is directed upwardly, then the virtual circle 6 becomes reduced as shown in Fig. 9, to thereby stabilize combustion even at the lovj load because the whirling is strengthened.<br>
According to the present invention, since the distribution of the heat absorption of the generating tubes in the furnace in the width direction of the furnace wall is remarkably averaged, a difference in temperature between the tubes at the outlet of the generating tubes of the furnace can be remarkably reduced. Hence, the stress of the furnace wall caused by the difference in temperature is reduced, and the steam generator can be continuously operated safely for a long period. Furthermore, the breeches pipe, the communication pipe, a specific reinforcement part or the like as in the conventional spiral wind boiler is not required.<br>
The foregoing description of a preferred embodiment of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and<br><br>
description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed, and modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings or may be acquired from practice of the invention. The embodiment was chosen and described in order to explain the principles of the invention and its practical application to enable one skilled in the art to utilize the invention in various embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. It is intended that the scope of the invention be defined by the claims appended hereto, and their equivalents.<br><br><br><br><br>
STEAM GENERATOR<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1.     Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a supercritical variable pressure operation steam generator. 2 .      Description of the Related Art<br>
The number of burners fixed to a steam generator (boiler) that burns a fossil fuel such as heavy oil, coal or fuel gas and generates steam by combustion heat are increased as a device becomes large in size. The arrangement of the burners are roughly classified into the front firing system in which the fossil fuel is burned from the front wall of the boiler as shown in Figs. 14(a) and 14(b), the opposed burning system in which the fossil fuel is burned from the front and back walls of the boiler as shown in Figs. 15(a) and 15(b), and the whirling burning system in which the fossil fuel is blown from the corner portions of a furnace toward the center thereof cis shown in Figs. 16(a) and 16(b).<br>
Among them, the whirling burning system, as shown in Fig. 16(b), blows a fuel and a combustion air tangentially to a virtual circle in the center of the furnace, to thereby form a whirling flame in the center of the furnace. As a result, in the whirling burning system, combustion is stabilized, the load of the furnace is made relatively uniform, and the quantity of generated NOx is<br><br>
reduced. Burner boxes of this system, as shown in Figs. 16(a) and<br>
17,	are arranged vertically and longitudinally.<br>
The furnace is arranged and assembled, as shown in Fig.<br>
18,	so that a large number of generating tubes are connected by<br>
welding through a fin into a panel-like shape, and those<br>
generating tubes are vertically arranged and assembled. A boiler<br>
water is elevated within the generating tubes and absorb a heat<br>
generated within the furnace.<br>
In the variable pressure operation boiler that operates at a supercritical pressure at the time of a high load and at a subcritical pressure at the time of a low load, a gas-liquid two-phase flow mixing water with steam is produced in a high thermal load zone within the generating tube at the time of the low load, resulting in a film boiling phenomenon where the temperature of a tube wall is unstabilized, which may damage the generating tube. Therefore, up to now, there have been proposed a method of stabilizing the temperature of the tube wall by stirring a fluid within the tube at the time of the low load, using a so-called rifle tube which is a tube having a specific structure having spiral projections inside as shown in Fig. 19, and a method of stabilizing the temperature of the tube wall in which the generating tubes of the furnace in the high thermal load zone are inclined by about 30° with respect to the horizon, as shown in Fig. 20, and the number of the generating tubes at that portion is reduced to increase a flow rate within the tubes.<br><br>
In the conventional furnace shown in Fig. 18, because fuel, the boiler load, the position of the burner under use, and so on are different, the distribution of the thermal load within the furnace is always changed. As a result, the distribution of the thermal absorption for each vertical tube disposed on the peripheral wall of the furnace is largely different to the degree-of from 60% to 140%, as indicated by a broken line in Fig. 11. Therefore, there is the possibility that the metal temperature at the outlet of the furnace wall is largely unbalanced. This tendency is not so different even though the level within the furnace is different.<br>
In case of the furnace using the inclined generating tube<br>
shown in Fig. 20, since the inclined generating tube is elevated<br>
with the furnace wall being in the spiral shape, the fluctuation<br>
I of the distribution of the thermal load within the furnace is made<br>
uniform. However, since the weight of the furnace wall cannot be<br>
supported by the furnace wall tube per se, a specific pendant<br>
plate is necessarily used. ' Also, since the number of tubes is<br>
increased twice at a portion where the inclined generating tube<br>
is shifted to the vertical tube, a breeches pipe is used as shovm<br>
in Fig. 21, or the tubes are necessarily connected by a<br>
communication header, resulting in a complicated structure.<br>
On the other hand, in the case where the burner v/ind boxQS<br>
are vertically and longitudinally arranged as in the conventional<br>
device, since a certain specific generating pipe at the burner<br><br>
portion does not receive the radiation heat of the furnace gas over the entire length at all the time, and another specific generating pipe always receives a high thermal load, trfere occurs a large difference in thermal absorption at the outlet of the furnace as shown in Fig. 12, whereby a large thermal stress is exerted on the furnace wall by an unbalance of temperature generated between the tubes that form the furnace wall, with the result that the furnace wall is destroyed.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made to solve the above^ mentioned problem, and therefore an object of the present invention is to provide a steam generator which is operated under both of the supercritical pressure and the subcritical pressure having generating tubes that form a furnace wall, in which upper and lower generating tubes are directed vertically, and the central generating tubes are inclined by 10 to 35° with respect to a vertical line, as first solving means.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a steam generator which is operated under both of the supercritical pressure and the subcritical pressure, in which a burner wind box is inclined along the inclination of said generating tubes and divided into a plurality of upper and lower stages, as second solving means.<br><br>
In the above first solving means, since the vertically central ones of the generating tubes that forin the furnace v/all are inclined by 10 to 35° with respect to a vertical line, the respective generating tubes extend over the central portion having a large thermal absorption and the corner portions having a small thermal absorption in the width direction of the furnace wall. Hence, the thermal absorption of the respective generating tubes is made uniform, to thereby reduce the unbalance of temperature at the outlet of the furnace wall.<br>
Then, since the inclined ejngle is small, in is not<br>
required that the number of tubes is changed between the upper and<br>
lower portions and the central portion of the furnace wall as in<br>
the conventional spiral wind boiler, and the pitches of tubes are<br>
merely slightly changed. Hence, it is unnecessary to use a<br>
breeches pipe or a communication pipe. Also, since the inclined<br>
angle is small, the self-weight of the inclined generating pipe<br>
can be supported by itself, thereby requiring no specific pendant<br>
fitting or the like.	In the above second solving means, since the burner wind box is further inclined along the inclination of said generating tubes, the burner fixing positions are dispersed horizontally, and the thermal load is leveled. Also, since the burner wind box is divided into two upper and lower stages or three stages, the generating tubes disposed at the burner position can be dispersed<br><br>
so that the thermal absorption of the respective generating tubes is further leveled.<br>
The above and other objects and features of the present invention will be more apparent from the. following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Hereinafter, a description v;ill be given of the embodiments of the present invention with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
A first embodiment of the present invention will be described.<br>
Fig. 1 is a side view showing a furnace in accordance v;ith a first embodiment of the present invention, Fig. 2 is a horizontal cross-sectional view showing the furnace shown in Fig. 1, and Fig. 3 is a partially enlarged view of Fig. 1.<br>
In this embodiment, generating tubes that form a furnace wall 1 is so arranged that lower generating tubes 2 and upper generating tubes 4 are directed vertically, and central generating tubes 3 are inclined by 15° with respect to the<br><br>
vertical line. The distribution of a heat absorption within a furnace in a vertical direction, as shown in Fig. 10, has a high heat load band of from the position of a lowermost stage burner to the upper part of the uppermost stage burner. Therefore, in this embodiment, the upper portion of the furnace having a low heat absorption coefficient and the generating tubes 4 and 2 of from the furnace bottom to the lower portion of a burner wind box are located vertically, and the generating tubes 3 is located with an inclined angle of about 15" in a burner zone of a high, heat absorption.<br>
Subsequently, a description v/ill be given of the pitches of the generating pipes, the diameter of the pipes and a fin width in accordance with this embodiment with reference to Fig. 3. The lower generating pipe 2 is 28.6 mm in the outer diameter of the tuber and 44.5 mm in the pitches of the tube because a specific volume of fluid in the tube is small. Also, the fin width of the lower generating pipe 2 is 15.9 ram. The central generating tube 3 is 28,6 mm in the outer diameter, similarly, but 43.0 mm (44.5 mm X cos 15°) in the pitches of the tube and 14.4 mm in fin width. The upper generating tube 4 is increased in the outer diameter to 31.8 mm, and 44.5 mm in pitch as in the lower generating tube, and 12.7 in fin width. As a result, the distribution of the entire flow rate can be more readily adjusted.<br>
In this embodiment, since the burner zone (the central portion in the height direction of the furnace wall) highest in<br><br>
the heat load is made up of the generating tubes v;hich are inclined by about 15° v/ith respect to the vertical line, the accumulating total of the furnace heat absorption is made remarkably uniform. In other words, as indicated by a solid line in Fig. 11, it has been found as a result of a simulation calculation that the accumulating total of the furnace heAt absorption is 120% at the maximum and 80% at the minimum, which are within the unbalance of about 1/2 of the conventional one, and thus it has been proved that the effect of restraining the unbalance of temperature is large.<br>
It has been proved through the experience that the heat absorption pattern of the furnace has the nearly same inclination between the lower portion of the furnace to the vicinity of the upper portion of the burner. In the width direction of the furnace wall, in the corner firing burner, the heat absorption pattern is of the nearly symmetric distribution such that the heat absorption is highest at the central portion of the respective furnace walls and low at the right and left corner portions. Therefore, when the furnace wall is made up of the generating tubes that are inclined by 15" with respect to the vertical line, the respective generating tubes are moved in the lateral direction by about 1/2 of the furnace width from the lower portion to the upper portion of the furnace. In other words, since one generating tube passes through both of a zone large in<br><br>
heat absorption and a zone small in heat absorption, the heat absorption is made uniform.<br>
In the case where the central generating tubes in the vertical direction as in this embodiment are inclined by 15" with respect to the vertical line, since a difference in pitch between<br>
the inclined tubes and the vertical tubes is i^light, that is, 3.4%<br>
1 as indicated in the above-mentioned dimensional example, the<br>
inclined tubes and the vertical tubes can be connected with no use<br>
of a breeches pipe or a communication tube. Also, compared with<br>
the conventional inclined generating tube that is inclined by 30°<br>
with respect to the horizon as shown in Fig. 20, in this<br>
embodiment, since the stress to the vertical load is reduced to<br>
about 1/2, there is not required a specific pendant plate which<br>
has been conventionally used for reducing the stress applied to<br>
the furnace wall tube.<br>
The inclined angle with respect to the vertical line of the inclined generating tube in accordance with the present invention can be set to a range of from 10" to 35° in practical use. If it is less than 10°, the effect of correcting nonuniformity of the distribution of the heat load is lost, and if it exceeds 35°, the inclined pipe cannot support the weight itself.<br>
Next, a second embodiment of the present invention will be described.<br><br>
Fig. 4 is a side view showing a furnace in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention, Fig. 5 is a partially enlarged view of Fig. 4, Fig. 6 is a horizontal cross-sectional view showing the furnace shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 7 is a cross-sectional view taken along a line VII--VII of Fig, 5, and Fig. 8 is a perspective view showing a burner device in the second embodiment.<br>
Similarly to the above-mentioned first embodiment, in the second embodiment, generating tubes that form a furnace wall 1 is so arranged that lower generating tubes 2 and upper generating tubes 4 are directed vertically, and central generating tubes 3 are inclined by 15° with respect to the vertical line. In this embodiment, additionally, a burner wind box 5 is inclined along the inclination of the above generating tubes 3 and vertically divided into three stages. The burner wind box 5 is arranged such that the center of the divided burner wind box 5 is on the nearly same vertical line. Hence, although the positions of the respective burners in the horizontal direction are different from each other, a fuel and a fuel air are injected from the respective burners toward the tangent to a virtual circle 6 with the horizontal cross-section in the center of the furnace. Also, the fuel and air nozzles are so structured as to be tilted vertically by ±30° along the plane which is inclined by 15°.<br>
As described above, in this embodiment, since the burner wind box 5 is vertically divided into three stages and inclined<br><br>
at an angle of 15° with respect to the vertical line, the burner fitting positions are different from each other in the horizontal direction of the furnace wall. Since the heat load of the burner level is high in the vicinity of a burner outlet, when injection portion is moved, the heat load tends to be leveled.<br>
Also, in the vicinity of the burner portion, tubes that do not receive a radiation heat generated within the furnace comes close to tubes that largely receive the radiation heat, there occurs a difference in temperature between those tubes. However, in this embodiment, since the center of the respective wind box 5 which is divided into a plurality of stages is disposed at the same distance from the side edge of the furnace wall and inclined by 15° with respect to the vertical line, the generating pipes that largely receive the radiation heat of the respective wind boxes and the generating pipes that do not receive the radiation heat are different, respectively, to thereby reduce the difference in temperature at the outlet of the furnace wall. In other words, the conventional device haa a large nonuniform of 60<br>
to 140% in the width direction of the furnace at the out^let of the<br>
i<br>
furnace as shown in Fig. 12, whereas this embodiment remarkably improves to 85 to 120% as shown in Fig. 13. Hence, the unbalance of the metal temperature at the outlet of the furnace wall is further reduced, and the stress of the furnace wall is remarkably reduced.<br><br>
Moreover, in this embodiment, as a result that the wind box 5 is inclined along the inclination ol. the generating tubes 3 as described above, the bending of the tube at the burner portion is facilitated.<br>
Further, since the fuel and air nozzle^ of this embodiment can be tilted vertically ±30°, the burner is directed horizontally or downwardly when the boiler is at a high load, and upwardly from the viewpoint of controlling the steam temperature when it is at a low load. When the burner is directed upwardly, then the virtual circle 6 becomes reduced as shov/n in Fig. 9, to thereby stabilize combustion even at the lev; load because the whirling is strengthened.<br>
According to the present invention, since the distribution of the heat absorption of the generating tubes in the furnace in the width direction of the furnace wall is remarkably averaged, a difference in temperature between the tubes at the outlet of the generating tubes of the furnace can be remarkably reduced. Hence, the stress of the furnace wall caused by the difference in temperature is redviced, and the steam generator can be continuously operated safely for a long period. Furthermore, the breeches pipe, the communication pipe, a specific reinforcement part or the like as in the conventional spiral wind boiler is not required.<br>
