FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to fluorescent ink compositions for writing instruments and writing instruments making use of the ink composition. The ink compositions comprise a fluorescent pigment dispersed in a resin and a high boiling point organic solvent.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Current bright ink pens are either gel ink pens requiring a grease follower and point seal feature or free ink pens wherein the ink viscosity is low (less than 1000 cPs) and a flow control mechanism such as a baffle and/or capillary connectors is required. U.S. Patent No. 4,671,691 to Case et al. and 4,726,845 to Thompson et al. disclose aqueous gel ink pens. U.S. Patent Nos. 3,446,564 to Horie; 3,533,708 to Horie; 3,572,954 to Chevron; 3,873,218 to Yoshida; and U.S. Patent No. 3,951,555 to Wittnebert et al. disclose writing instruments utilizing liquid reservoirs employing porous ink feed rods. Disadvantages to using porous ink feed rods include a potential failure to provide a sufficiently continuous flow of ink through the writing instrument tip to the paper.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,753,921 to Noetzel et al. discloses fluorescent pigments dispersed in resins with an average particle size of 0.1 to 5 p for printing inks. Example 1 of the Noetzel patent also discloses that the daylight fluorescent pigment obtained was insoluble in heptane, xylene, ethanol, butanol, butyl acetate and acetone. U.S. Patent No. 3,753,921 does not disclose the use of these fluorescent pigments in writing instrument<br>
inks.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,455,856 to Voedisch discloses a printing ink and a method of manufacturing a pigment dispersion that contains pigmented resin particles suspended in an oil modified alkyd resin vehicle. Fluorescent and non-fluorescent pigments are disclosed U.S. Patent No. 3,455,856 does not disclose the organic solvents of the present invention nor does it disclose ink compositions for writing instruments.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,079,026 to Mone discloses oleoresinous base printing inks<br><br>
which contain pigments dispersed in an organic resin and an oil solvent. The pigments can be fluorescent or non-fluorescent Particularly preferred are daylight fluorescent-type dyes and oil solvents with boiling points about 200°C, such as those sold by Magie Bros. Oil Company. The ink is used for planographic or letterpress printing, not for writing instruments.<br>
U.S. Patent No, 5,290,348 to Auslander discloses non-aqueous fluorescent inks and non-aqueous pigment dispersions stabilized by rosin ester, linseed oil alkyds or other alkyds. The average particle size of the fluorescent pigment is 0.1 to 0.5p. The fluorescent inks of the Auslander patent fluoresce when exposed to ultraviolet light. U.S. Patent No. 5,290,348 does not disclose daylight fluorescent pigments or show their use in writing instrument inks.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,849,814 to Fujita discloses an eraseable ink composition for writing boards. The composition comprises a pigment, a pigment dispersion resin, nonaqueous ambient temperature non-volatile liquid removal agent and a non-aqueous ambient temperature volatile organic solvent, wherein the amount of pigment dispersion resin relative to pigment is from about 2 to about 10%. Pigments disclosed are fluorescent and non-fluorescent pigments. U.S. Patent No. 5,849,814 discloses the use of a volatile solvent at ambient temperature. Further, it states that the ink composition of Fujita is superior in time-erasion performance independent of the surface of the writing board. U.S. Patent No. 5,849,814 does not disclose ink compositions for writing instruments, nor does it disclose high boiling point organic solvents, nor does it disclose writing surfaces other than writing boards.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,919,858 to Loftin discloses erasable ink compositions comprising an aqueous-based marking ink comprising water, a colorant and a latex emulsion comprising a styrene-butadiene copolymer having a styrene content of less than about 35%. The colorant may be a fluorescent pigment with a particle size of less than 3 microns. U.S. Patent No. 5,919,858 does not disclose the non-aqueous compositions of the present invention.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,968,614 to Ueda et al. discloses a fluorescent ink composition comprising (1) an organic solvent comprising propylene glycol monomethyl ether, (2) a solution type fluorescent pigment dissolved in the organic solvent comprising propylene glycol monomethyl ether and (3) a ketone resin. The homogeneous ink composition of<br><br>
Ueda is particularly suitable for use in marking pens which have an ink reservoir composed of a bundle of fibers, wherein the ink composition is supplied from the ink reservoir by making use of capillary phenomenon. U.S. Patent No. 5,968,614 does not disclose the use of fluorescent pigments dispersed in a resin or the bright color effect within the transparent or translucent ink tube of a writing instrument or the heterogeneous ink compositions of the present invention.<br>

As used herein, the term "masscolor" is the color when viewed by reflected light of an ink of such thickness to obscure completely the background.<br>
As used herein, the term "stabilizer" is an additive for inks to prevent the discoloration and changes in the viscosity of the ink with the passage of time. Examples of stabilizers are dihydroxybenzene derivatives, hydroxy benzenes, such as butylated hydroxy toluene, and hydroquinone.<br>
As used herein, the term "plasticizer" is an organic additive and is used to make the ink film more flexible. Examples of plasticizers are nonvolatile organic liquids and low melting solids, such as phthalate, adipate and sebacate esters, tricresyl phosphate and castor oil.<br>
