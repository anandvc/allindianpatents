BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
In the electric power system 1 of FIG. 1, only the Power Units 11 to 15 are shown out of a plurality of POWER UNITS. The POWER UNITS 11 to 15 are interconnected via an electric power transmission line W.<br><br>
The POWER UNIT 11 comprises electric power generation equipment 101, electric power storage equipment 102, a plurality of loads (electric appliances) 103, and POWER CONTROL EQUIPMENT 104. The plurality of the electric appliances 103 are shown by Al, A2, . . . , An. Moreover, in FIG. 1, the other POWER UNITS 12, 13, 14 and the other POWER UNITS not shown comprise electric power generation equipment, electric power storage equipment, a plurality of loads (electric appliances) and POWER CONTROL EQUIPMENT like the POWER UNIT 11, with the appliances connected with a branched interior line.<br>
According to the present invention, the POWER UNITS are linked separately. That is, the POWER UNITS are basically independent with each other and they receive the electric power from the other POWER UNITS in case of occurring the electric power insufficiency and supply the electric power to the other POWER UNITS in case of occurring the electric power excess. The POWER UNIT 11 is for example, a common house, an apartment house, a small, middle or large scale factory, a low, middle or high-rise building, or the like. Furthermore, a group of a plurality of the common houses, the apartment houses, or the like can be counted as the POWER UNIT 11 of the present invention.<br>
Typically, the electric power generation equipment 101 have a DC power source such as a solar photovoltaic generator, a fuel cell and so on. The wind electric power generation may beusedas the electric power generation equipment 101. Although<br><br>
the wind electric power generation equipment has an AC power source in general, it can be used as the DC power source with the output AC/DC conversion. Moreover, the electric power storage equipment 102 has a DC power source. The load 103 is for example a DC appliance or an AC appliance such as a light, an air conditioner, a refrigerator, an electromagnetic cooker, and a rice cooker.<br>
In case of occurring the electric power excess at the POWER UNIT 11, for example, the electric power use amount of the load<br>
103	is reduced and the electric power storage equipment 102 gets to full charge or close to full charge, the POWER CONTROL EQUIPMENT<br>
104	supplies the electric power generated by the electric power generation equipment 101 to the other POWER UNITS connected with the electric power transmission line W or the POWER UNIT 15. Moreover, in case of occurring the electric power insufficiency at the POWER UNIT 11, the Power Control Equipment 104 , for example, the electric power use amount of the load 103 is increased drastically, the POWER CONTROL EQUIPMENT 104 receives the electric power from the POWER CONTROL EQUIPMENT of the other POWER UNITS pl2, 13, 14, with the electric power excess occurred, connected with the electric power transmission line W, or via the POWER CONTROL EQUIPMENT 153 of the POWER UNIT 15 tobe described later so as to drive the load 103 or charge the electric power in the electric power storage equipment 102.<br>
ThePOWERUNIT 15 comprises the electric power generation<br><br>
equipment 151, the electric power storage equipment 152 and the POWER CONTROL EQUIPMENT 153 .

The POWER UNIT 15 can supply the electric power via the POWER CONTROL EQUIPMENT 153 to the POWER UNIT 11 (or the other POWER UNITS 12 to 14, or the like) as mentioned above. Moreover, on the contrary, the POWER UNIT 15 can receive the electric power from the POWER UNIT 11 (or the other POWER UNITS 12 to 14, or the like).<br>
The electric power supplied from the POWER UNIT 15 to the POWER UNIT 11, or the like is the electric power generated by the electric power generation equipment 151 or the electric power charged in the electric power storage equipment 152. The electric power supplied from the POWER UNIT 11 or the like to the POWER UNIT 15 is charged in the electric power storage equipment 152.<br>
According to the electric power system shown in FIG. 1, in case of demand or supply of the electric power with the other POWER UNITS 12 to 15, the POWER CONTROL EQUIPMENT 104 exchanges the information with the POWER CONTROL EQUIPMENT of the other Power Units so as to determine the demand and supply conditions,<br><br>
or the like.<br>
According to the electric power system shown in FIG. 1, the electric power demand and supply among the POWER UNITS can be carried out by either current of AC or DC. In either case, it may be provided as a local electric power system, or as a large scale electric power system as a combination of the local electric power systems.<br>
According to the electric power system shown in FIG. 1, although it is not shown, the POWER UNIT comprising only the load can be connected with the electric power transmission line W. Moreover, according to the electric power system of FIG. 1, the electric power demand and supply can be evened according to the interconnection of a large number of various POWER UNITS.<br>
In case the cost is increased if the electric power storage equipment 102 of the POWER UNIT. 11 has a large capacity, it is possible to use an electric power storage equipment 102 having a small capacity (or without providing the having the electric power storage equipment 102) and use the electric power supplied from the other POWER UNITS for dealing with the load. In this case, it is preferable that the POWER UNITS having different time slot electric power consumption patterns (for example, houses and offices) are present in the electric power system 1. Moreover, it is preferable that the POWER UNIT 15 having different electricpower generation forms (for example, the solar photovoltaic generation equipment and the wind electric power<br><br>
generation equipment) are present.<br>
