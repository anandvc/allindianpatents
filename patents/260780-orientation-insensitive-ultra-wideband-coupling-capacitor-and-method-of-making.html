COUPLING CAPACITOR AND METHOD OF MAKING<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
The instant non-provisional application claims priority from provisional application<br>
number 60/503,183, filed September 15, 2003, and entitled ULTRA-WIDEBAND<br>
COUPLING CAPACITOR.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to an ultra-wideband coupling capacitor, and more<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to an orientation-insensitive ultra-wideband coupling<br>
capacitor and method of making.<br>
Description of the Prior Art:<br>
As shown in FIGURES 1 and 2, which are, respectively, a schematic diagram of a<br>
prior art ultra-wideband coupling capacitor, and an exploded diagrammatic perspective view<br>
of a prior art ultra-wideband coupling capacitor, a prior art ultra-wideband coupling capacitor<br>
10 is a parallel combination of a high value capacitor 12, typically 10 nanofarads or greater,<br>
and a low value capacitor 14, typically 20 picofarads to 250 picofarads. As can be seen,<br>
capacitors in parallel result in wider operating bandwidths.<br>
The prior art ultra-wideband coupling capacitor 10 is either composed of two or more<br>
physical items which require precise assembly or a single ceramic assembly which must<br>
internally include complex multiple capacitor configurations, and via holes that interconnect<br>
internal electrodes to external contacting pads. Both of these family of devices have larger<br>
than desired physical footprints and can only be mounted on one specific side of the device<br>
making them difficult to use where surface mount technology (SMT) is employed.<br>
Electrically, size limitations result in both high insertion and return losses and also cause<br>
excessive surface moding at higher microwave frequencies.<br>
The high value capacitor 12 is a multi-layer capacitor, while the low value capacitor<br>
14 is generally either a single layer capacitor or two single layer capacitors in a balanced<br>
configuration. The multi-layer capacitor is a multi-layer structure with interdigitated plates,<br>
each separated by a thin dielectric layer, while the single layer capacitor is a single layer<br>
structure with two plates separated by a thin dielectric layer.<br>
The high value capacitor 12, with its relatively low series resonance, is most effective<br>
on lower frequency signals, while the low value capacitor 14, with its relatively high series<br>
resonance, is most effective on high frequency signals.<br>
The high value capacitor 12 and the low value capacitor 14 of the prior art ultrawideband<br>
coupling capacitor 10 have different operating characteristics in different portions<br>
of an ultra-wideband operating spectrum, as will be discussed infra.<br>
As shown in FIGURE 3A, which is a schematic diagram of a prior art ultra-wideband<br>
coupling capacitor operating at a low frequency, when the prior art ultra-wideband coupling<br>
capacitor 10 is operating at a low frequency, the prior art ultra-wideband coupling capacitor<br>
10 electrodes exhibit insignificant skin effect. The ceramic structure looks like a bulk<br>
dielectric.<br>
As shown in FIGURE 3B, which is a schematic diagram of a prior art ultra-wideband<br>
coupling capacitor operating at a mid frequency, when the prior art ultra-wideband coupling<br>
capacitor 10 is operating at a mid frequency, the prior art ultra-wideband coupling capacitor<br>
10 electrodes exhibit significant skin effect. The dielectric region begins to take on the effect<br>
of a meandering parallel plate transmission line structure. Additional resonances emerge.<br>
As shown in FIGURE 3C, which is a schematic diagram of a prior art ultra-wideband<br>
coupling capacitor operating at a high frequency, when the prior art ultra-wideband coupling<br>
capacitor 10 is operating at a high frequency, the prior art ultra-wideband coupling capacitor<br>
10 electrodes exhibit full skin effect. The dielectric region acts as a lossy meandering parallel<br>
plate transmission line. Additional resonances emerge at the higher frequencies.<br>
The prior art ultra-wideband coupling capacitor 10 has a few associated shortcomings.<br>
Firstly, since the prior art ultra-wideband coupling capacitor 10 is a two-piece structure, the<br>
prior art ultra-wideband coupling capacitor 10 requires additional production assembly effort,<br>
which increases per unit cost. Secondly, the prior art ultra-wideband coupling capacitor 10<br>
is orientation-sensitive restricting it to being mounted only on one specific surface, creating<br>
surface mount technology (SMT) compatibility issues. Thirdly, the assembly height of the<br>
prior art ultra-wideband coupling capacitor 10 exceeds the 0.020" dimension of a standard<br>
0402 package by 0.012".<br>
Thus, there exists a need for an ultra-wideband coupling capacitor which is one-piece<br>
and thereby el iminates additional production assembly effort which thereby decreases per unit<br>
cost, which is orientation-insensitive and thereby eliminates restricting it to being mounted<br>
only on one specific surface which thereby eliminates surface mount technology (SMT)<br>
compatibility issues, and which does not exceed the 0.020" dimension of a standard 0402.<br>
Numerous innovations for high frequency capacitors have been provided in the prior<br>
art. Even though these innovations may be suitable for the specific individual purposes to<br>
which they address, they each differ in structure and/or operation and/or purpose from the<br>
present invention in that they do not present an ultra-wideband coupling capacitor which is<br>
one-piece and thereby eliminates additional production assembly effort which thereby<br>
decreases per unit cost, which is orientation-insensitive and thereby eliminates restricting it<br>
to being mounted only on one specific surface which thereby eliminates surface mount<br>
technology (SMT) compatibility issues, and which does not exceed the 0.020" dimension of<br>
a standard 0402.<br>
FOR EXAMPLE, U.S. Patent Number 5,576,926 to Monsorno has an assignee<br>
common with the instant application and presents a capacitor which has a superior ability to<br>
operate in the upper regions of the RP spectrum. The capacitor includes a planar electrode<br>
layer which is mounted between a pair of dielectric layers. The electrode layer generally is<br>
centered inwardly with respect to the dielectric layers leaving an outward margin of dielectric<br>
material. One of the dielectric layers has two spaced apart contact members, each having a<br>
different polarity from the other. The electrode layer is isolated from electrical contact with<br>
any conductor and is buried within the dielectric layers. The electrode layer, in combination<br>
with the dielectric layer on which the contact members are mounted and the contact members,<br>
allow development of a selected value of capacitance between the contact members. Providing<br>
trimmed contact members, as well as controlling their size and spacing, allow for convenient<br>
preselection of desired operative characteristics of the capacitor. The contact members could<br>
be positioned on a substrate to which a buried electrode is mounted.<br>
ANOTHER EXAMPLE, U.S. PatentNumber 6,690,572 to Liebowitz teaches an SLC<br>
which has a thin brittle ceramic dielectric layer less than 0.0035 inches thick and as low as<br>
0.0005 inches or less. Electrodes are thick and strong enough, either singly or together, to give<br>
the structure required physical strength for manufacture, handling, and usage. Electrodes are<br>
(1) a ceramic metal composite, (2) a porous ceramic infiltrated with metal or other conductive<br>
material, (3) a resin filled with metal or other conductive material, or (4) combinations of the<br>
above. The very thin and, in itself, fragile dielectric layer provides exceedingly high capacity<br>
per unit area with temperature stability and low losses. A 0.00001-inch thick dielectric of<br>
titanium dioxide is also used.<br>
It is apparent that numerous innovations for high frequency capacitors have been<br>
provided in the prior art that are adapted to be used. Furthermore, even though these<br>
innovations may be suitable for the specific individual purposes to which they address, they<br>
would not be suitable for the purposes of the present invention as heretofore described,<br>
namely, an ultra-wideband coupling capacitor which is one-piece and thereby eliminates<br>
additional production assembly effort which thereby decreases per unit cost, which is<br>
orientation-insensitive and thereby eliminates restricting it to being mounted only on one<br>
specific surface which thereby eliminates surface mount technology (SMT) compatibility<br>
issues, and which does not exceed the 0.020" dimension of a standard 0402.<br>

YET STILL ANOTHER OBJECT of the present invention is to provide an<br>

ultra-wideband coupling capacitor to work identically when mounted on any<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring now to the figures, in which like numerals indicate like parts, and<br>
particularly to FIGURES 4 and 5, which are, respectively, a diagrammatic perspective view<br>
of the orientation-insensitive ultra-wideband coupling capacitor of the present invention, and<br>
a diagrammatic cross sectional view taken along LINE 5-5 in FIGURE 4, the orientationinsensitive<br>
ultra-wideband coupling capacitor of the present invention is shown generally at<br>
20.<br>
The orientation-insensitive ultra-wideband coupling capacitor 20 typically operates in<br>
a range from below 20 KHz to over 40 Ghz, and fills a need for better blocking and decoupling<br>
components by finding a use in almost all ultra-wideband digital signal processing<br>
applications., e.g., optical systems and their associated test equipment, closely related DC<br>
returns and bias tees, fiber to the home (FTTH), and MMIC development, e.g., amplifiers, e.g,<br>
ultra-wideband MMIC amplifiers and those using related technology.<br>
The orientation-insensitive ultra-wideband coupling capacitor 20 comprises a plurality<br>
of external surfaces 22, a low frequency portion 24, and a high frequency portion 26. The high<br>
frequency portion 26 is so disposed on, and electrically connected to, the low frequency<br>
portion 24 so as to allow the orientation-insensitive ultra-wideband coupling capacitor 20 to<br>
work identically when mounted on any external longitudinal surface of the plurality of external<br>
surfaces 22 thereof and thereby be readily SMT compatible without regard to special orienting<br>
procedures.<br>
The orientation-insensitive ultra-wideband coupling capacitor 12 can operate below<br>
16 KHz by using a larger value for the low frequency portion 24 than that used for the range<br>
from below 20 KHz to over 40 Ghz, discussed supra.<br>
The low frequency portion 24 is functionally equivalent to the high value capacitor 12<br>
of the prior art ultra-wideband coupling capacitor 10, e.g., a multi-layer capacitor, while the<br>
high frequency portion 26 is functionally equivalent to the low value capacitor 14 of the prior<br>
art ultra-wideband coupling capacitor 10, e.g., a single-layer capacitor, so as to allow the<br>
orientation-insensitive ultra-wideband coupling capacitor 20 to have functions of both the high<br>
value capacitor 12 and the low value capacitor 14 solely in a single multi-layer ceramic body.<br>
The low frequency portion 24 is an unterminated multi-layer capacitor 28 having<br>
external surfaces 29, electrode layers 30, and dielectric layers 32, and preferably being 10 nF<br>
or higher. The dielectric layers 32 of the unterminated multi-layer capacitor 28 of the low<br>
frequency portion 24 alternate with the electrode layers 30 of the unterminated multi-layer<br>
capacitor 28 of the low frequency portion 24. The electrode layers 30 of the unterminated<br>
multi-layer capacitor 28 of the low frequency portion 24 extend at first ends 34 thereof from,<br>
and are open for external electrical communication from, opposing ends 36 of the external<br>
surfaces 29 of the unterminated multi-layer capacitor 28 of the low frequency portion 24, to<br>
second ends 38 thereof which alternatingly stop short of the opposing end 36 of the external<br>
surfaces 29 of the unterminated multi-layer capacitor 28 of the low frequency portion 24<br>
opposite to that from which they extend so as not to be open for external electrical<br>
communication therefrom.<br>
The high frequency portion 26 is a pair of conductors 40. The pair of conductors 40<br>
of the high frequency portion 26 cover the opposing ends 36 of the external surfaces 29 of the<br>
unterminated multi-layer capacitor 28 of the low frequency portion 24, respectively, and<br>
extend therefrom over the external surfaces 29 of the unterminated multi-layer capacitor 28<br>
of the low frequency portion 24, to j ust short of each other so as to form a circumferential slot<br>
42 therebetween and be separate from each other. The circumferential slot 42 is preferably<br>
formed by laser scribing5 but can be formed by either chemical etching, mechanical abrasing,<br>
or any similar procedure. Because the high frequency portion 26 does not employ additional<br>
internal electrodes with separating layers, i.e., does not employ a composite internal<br>
interdigital electrode array as a single floating electrode that is coupled to the pair of<br>
conductors 40 of the high frequency portion 26, there is less insertion and return losses.<br>
The pair of conductors 40 of the high frequency portion 26 form the plurality of<br>
external surfaces 22 and electrically communicate with the first ends 34 of the electrode layers<br>
30 of the unterminated multi-layer capacitor 28 of the low frequency portion 24 associated<br>
therewith so as to allow the orientation-insensitive ultra-wideband coupling capacitor 20 to<br>
work identically when mounted on any external longitudinal surface of the plurality of external<br>
surfaces 22 thereof. A set of coupled transmission lines is formed on the plurality of external<br>
surfaces 22 between the pair of conductors 40 of the nigh frequency portion 26 and the<br>
electrode layers 30 contained in the unterminated multi-layer capacitor 28 of the low frequency<br>
portion 24 so as to allow low frequency energy to pass through the low frequency portion 24,<br>
which is centrally located, and to allow high frequency energy to pass through the high<br>
frequency portion 26, which is peripherally located.<br>
The pair of conductors 40 of the high frequency portion 26 preferably comprise<br>
titanium-tungsten (TiW) followed by nominally three microns of copper (Cu) and a gold (Au)<br>
flash.<br>
The circumferential slot 42 is preferably nominally 1.5 mil wide, is constantly<br>
maintained completely through and completely around the high frequency portion 26 without<br>
destroying the unterminated multi-layer capacitor 28 of the low frequency portion 24, and is<br>
disposed substantially midway between exposed opposing ends 46 of the plurality of external<br>
surfaces 22 of the orientation-insensitive ultra-wideband coupling capacitor 20, thereby<br>
electrically separating the exposed opposing ends 46 of the orientation-insensitive ultrawideband<br>
coupling capacitor 20 from each other restoring capacitance thereto.<br>
The orientation-insensitive ultra-wideband coupling capacitor 20 further comprises a<br>
quick curing protective UV-curable solder dam coating 48. The quick curing protective UVcurable<br>
solder dam coating 48 covers all surfaces defining the circumferential slot 42 to protect<br>
the circumferential slot 42.<br>
The orientation-insensitive ultra-wideband coupling capacitor 20 further comprises a<br>
plating 50. The plating 50 covers the exposed opposing ends 46 of the plurality of external<br>
surfaces 22 of the orientation-insensitive ultra-wideband coupling capacitor 20 so as to form<br>
solderable connections 51 which extend up to the protective UV-curable solder dam coating<br>
48 which acts as a stop-off barrier for the solderable connections 51. The orientationinsensitive<br>
ultra-wideband coupling capacitor 20 is thereby formed having a resistance across<br>
the solderable connections 51 increased so that it exceeds 100 MegOhms. The plating 50 is<br>
preferably either pure tin or solder or gold. When the plating 50 is gold, the solderable<br>
connections 51 can also be gold/ribbon bonded or epoxy bonded.<br>
A circuit equivalent to the orientation-insensitive ultra-wideband coupling capacitor<br>
20 can best be seen in FIGURE 6, which is circuit equivalent to the orientation-insensitive<br>
ultra-wideband coupling capacitor of the present invention.<br>
The method of making the orientation-insensitive ultra-wideband coupling capacitor<br>
20 can best be seen in FIGURES 7A-7D, which are a flow chart of the method of making the<br>
orientation-insensitive ultra-wideband coupling capacitor of the present invention, and as such,<br>
will be discussed with reference thereto.<br>
The method of making the orientation-insensitive ultra-wideband coupling capacitor<br>
20 comprises the following steps:<br>
STEP 1: Secure the unterminated multi-layer capacitor 28 of the low frequency portion<br>
24.<br>
STEP 2; Coat completely the unterminated multi-layer capacitor 28 of the low<br>
frequency portion 24 with titanium-tungsten (TiW) followed by nominally<br>
three microns of copper (Cu) and a gold (Au) flash so as to form an adhesion<br>
layer 52 having opposing ends 54.<br>
STEP 3: Create by either laser scribing, chemical etching, mechanical abrasing, or<br>
similar procedure the circumferential slot 42 nominally 1.5 mil wide,<br>
