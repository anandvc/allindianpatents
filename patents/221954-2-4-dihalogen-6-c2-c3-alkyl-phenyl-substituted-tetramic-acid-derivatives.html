				<td>2,4-Dihalogen-6-(C7-Cyalkyl)phenyl substituted tetramic acid derivatives<br>
The invention relates to novel 2,4-dihalo-6-(C2-C3-alkyl)phenyl-substituted tetramic acid derivatives, to a plurality of processes and intermediates for their preparation and to their use as pesticides and/or herbicides. The invention also relates to selective herbicidal compositions comprising firstly the 2,4-dihalo-6-(C2-C3-alkyl)phenyl-substituted tetramic acid derivatives and secondly at least one crop plant compatibility-improving compound.<br>
3-Acylpyrrolidine-2,4-diones are described as having pharmaceutical properties (S. Suzuki et al. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 15 1120 (1967)). Furthermore, N-phenylpyrrolidine-2,4-diones were synthesized by R. Schmierer and H. Mildenberger (Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1985,1095). A biological activity of these compounds has not been described.<br>
EP-A-0 262 399 and GB-A-2 266 888 disclose compounds of a similar structure (3-aryl-pyrrolidine-2,4-diones); however, a herbicidal, insecticidal or acaricidal action of these compounds has hitherto not been described. Unsubstituted bicyclic 3-arylpyrrolidine-2,4-dione derivatives (EP-A-355 599 and EP-A-415 211) and substituted monocyclic 3-aryl-pyrrolidine-2,4-dione derivatives (EP-A-377 893 and EP-A-442 077) having herbicidal, insecticidal or acaricidal action are known.<br>
Also known are polycyclic 3-arylpyrrolidine-2,4-dione derivatives (EP-A-442 073) and IH-arylpyrrolidinedione derivatives (EP-A-456 063, EP-A-521334, EP-A-596298, EP-A-613884, EP-A-613 885, WO 94/01 997, WO 93/26954, WO 95/20 572, EP-A 0 668 267, WO 96/25 395, WO 96/31023, WO 96/35 664, WO 97/01535, WO 97/02 243, WO 97/36 868, WO 97/43275, WO 98/05638, WO 98/06721, WO 98/25928, WO 99/16748, WO 99/24437, WO 99/43649, WO 99/48869, WO 99/55673, WO 01/09092, WO 01/17972, WO 01/23354 and WO 01/74770).<br>
However, in particular at low application rates and concentrations, the activity and the activity spectrum of these compounds are not always entirely satisfactory. Moreover, the compatibility of these compounds with plants is not always sufficient.<br>

Depending inter alia on the nature of the substituents, the compounds of the formula (I) can be present as geometrical and/or optical isomers or isomer mixtures of varying composition, which, if desired, can be separated in a customary manner. The present invention provides both the pure isomers and the isomer mixtures, their preparation and use and compositions comprising them. However, for the sake of simplicity, hereinbelow only compounds of the formula (I) are referred to, although what is meant are both the pure compounds and, if appropriate, mixtures having varying proportions of isomeric compounds.<br>

Table 7: Examples of the combinations according to the invention (TableRemove) Surprisingly, it has now been found that the active compound combinations defined above of substituted ketoenols of the general formula (I) (component (a')) and also (I-a) (component (b') and safcncrs (antidotes) from the component (c') listed above, while having very good compatibility with useful plants, have a particularly high herbicidal activity and can be used in various crops, in particular in cereals (especially wheat), but also in soybeans, potatoes, corn and rice, for the selective control of weeds.<br>
Here, it has to be considered surprising that, from a large number of known safeners or<br>
antidotes capable of antagonizing the damaging effect of a herbicide on the crop plants, it is in particular the compounds of component (c') listed above which are suitable for compensating the damaging effect of substituted cyclic ketoenols on the crop plants almost completely, without negatively affecting the herbicidal activity against the weeds to any considerable extent.<br>
Emphasis may be given here to the particularly advantageous effect of the particularly preferred and most preferred combination partners made from component (c'), in particular with respect to sparing cereal plants, such as, for example, wheat, barley and rye, but also com and rice, as crop plants.<br>

A mixture with other known active compounds, such as herbicides, or with fertilizers and growth regulators, is also possible.<br>
When used as insecticides in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms prepared with these formulations, the active compounds according to the invention can furthermore exist in the form of a mixture with synergists. Synergists are compounds by which the activity of the active compounds is increased without it being necessary for the synergist added to be active itself.<br>
The active compound content of the use forms prepared from the commercially available formulations can vary within wide ranges. The active compound concentration of the use forms can be from 0.0000001 up to 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.0001 and 1% by weight.<br>
They are applied in a customary manner adapted to suit the use forms.<br>
When used again;:t hygiene pests and stored-product pests, the active compound or active compound combinations is/are distinguished by excellent residual action on wood and clay as well as good stal iliry to alkali on limed substrates.<br>
As already mcnlioncd above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts in accordance with the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species or plant varieties and plant cultivars which have been obtained by traditional biological breeding methods, such as hybridization or protoplast fusion, and the parts of these varieties and cultivars are treated. In<br><br>
a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars which have been obtained by recombinant methods, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (genetically modified organisms), and their parts are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been explained above.<br>
Plants which are treated particularly preferably in accordance with the invention are those of the plant cultivars which are in each case commercially available or in use. Plant cultivars are understood as meaning plants with new traits which have been bred either by conventional breeding, by mutagencsis or by recombinant DNA techniques. They may take the form of cultivars, biorypes and genotypes.<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, nutrition), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widened activity spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the substances and compositions which can be used in accordance with the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to salinity in the water or soil, increased flowering performance, facilitated harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher yields, higher quality and/or better nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage characteristics and/or processibility of the harvested products are possible which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The preferred transgenic plants or plant cultivars (those obtained by recombinant methods) to be treated in accordance with the invention include all those plants which, owing to the process of recombinant modification, were given genetic material which confers particular, advantageous, valuable traits to these plants. Examples of such properties are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to salinity in the water or soil, increased flowering performance, facilitated harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher yields, higher quality and/or higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage characteristics and/or processibility of the harvested products. Further examples of such traits, examples which must be mentioned especially, are better defense of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogcnic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses and an increased tolerance of the plants to certain hcibicidal active compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), corn, soybeans, potato, cotton,<br><br>
oilseed rape, beets, sugar cane and fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), with particular emphasis on corn, soybeans, potatoes, cotton and oilseed rape. Traits which are especially emphasized are the increased defense of the plants against insects, owing to toxins being formed in the plants, in particular toxins which are generated in the plants by the genetic material of Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a), CryIA(b), CrylA(c), CryHA, CrylllA, CryIIlB2, Cry9c, Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF and their combinations; hcreinbelow "Bt plants"). Other traits which are particularly emphasized are the increased defense of plants against fungi, bacteria and viruses by systemic acquired resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexins, elicitors and resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins. Other traits which are especially emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidal active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulfonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinothricin (for example "PAT" gene). The genes which confer the desired traits in each case may also be present in the transgenic plants in combination with one another. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are corn cultivars, cotton cultivars, soybean cultivars and potato cultivars wliich are commercially available under the trade names YIELD CARD® (for example corn, cotton, soya beans), KnockOut® (for example corn), StaiLink® (for example com), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLcaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants wliich may be mentioned are corn cultivars, cotton cultivars and soybean cultivars which are commercially available under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example corn, cotton, soybean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinothricin, for example oilseed rape), IMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulfonylureas, for example corn). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) wliich may be mentioned include also the varieties commercially available under the name Clearfield® (for example corn). Naturally, these statements also apply to plant cultivars having these genetic traits or genetic traits still to be developed, which plant cultivars will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated particularly advantageously with the compounds according to the invention or the active compound mixtures according to the invention. The preferred ranges stated above for the active compounds and mixtures also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis may be given to the treatment of plants with the compounds or mixtures specifically mentioned in the present text.<br><br>

Industrial materials are to be understood as meaning, in the present context, non-live materials, such as, preferably, synthetic materials, glues, sizes, paper and board, leather, wood and timber products, and paint.<br>
The materials to be very particularly preferably protected against attack by insects are wood and timber products.<br>
Wood and timber products which can be protected by the composition according to the invention or mixtures comprising such a composition are to be understood as meaning, for example:<br>
construction timber, wooden beams, railway sleepers, bridge components, jetties, wooden vehicles, boxes, pallets, containers, telephone poles, wood cladding, windows and doors<br><br>
made of wood, plywood, particle board, joiner's articles, or wood products which, quite generally, are used in the construction of houses or in joinery.<br>
The active compounds or active compound combinations can be used as such, in the form of concentrates or generally customary formulations, such as powders, granules, solutions, suspensions, emulsions or pastes.<br>
The formulations mentioned can be prepared in a manner known per se, for example by mixing the active compounds with at least one solvent or diluent, emulsifier, dispersant and/or binder or fixative, water repellent, if appropriate desiccants and UV stabilizers and, if appropriate, colorants and pigments and other processing auxiliaries.<br>
The insecticidal compositions or concentrates used for the protection of wood and wooden materials comprise the active compound according to the invention in a concentration of 0.0001 to 95% by weight, in particular 0.001 to 60% by weight<br>
The amount of the compositions or concentrates employed depends on the species and the occurrence of the insects and on the medium. The optimum rate of application can be determined upon use in each case by series of tests. However, in general, it suffices to employ 0.0001 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.001 to 10% by weight, of the active compound, based on the material to be protected.<br>
The solvent and/or diluent used is an organochemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or an oily or oil-type organochemical solvent or solvent mixture of low volatility and/or a polar organochemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or water and, if appropriate, an emulsifier and/or wetting agent.<br>
Organochemical solvents which are preferably employed are oily or oil-type solvents having an evaporation number of above 35 and a flashpoint of above 30CC, preferably above 45°C. Substances which are used as such oily and oil-type solvents which have low volatility and are insoluble in water are suitable mineral oils or their aromatic fractions, or mineral-oil-containing solvent mixtures, preferably white spirit, petroleum and/or alkylbenzene.<br>
Substances which are advantageously used are mineral oils with a boiling range of 170 to 220rC, white spirit with a boiling range of 170 to 220CC. spindle oil with a boiling range of<br><br>
250 lo 350°C, petroleum or aromatics of boiling range 160 to 2SO°C, essence of turpentine and the like.<br>

The organic oily or oil-type solvents of low volatility having an evaporation number of above 35 and a flashpoint of above 30°C, preferably above 45CC, can be partially replaced by organochemical solvents of high or medium volatility, with the proviso that the solvent mixture also has an evaporation number of above 35 and a flashpoint of above 30°C, preferably above 45CC, and that the insecticide/fungicide mixture is soluble or emulsifiable in this solvent mixture.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, part of the organochemical solvent or solvent mixture or an aliphatic polar organochemical solvent or solvent mixture is replaced. Substances which are preferably used are aliphatic organochemical solvents having hydroxyl and/or ester and/or ether groups, such as, for example, glycol ethers, esters and the like.<br>
The organochemical binders used within the scope of the present invention are the synthetic resins and/or binding drying oils which are known per se and can be diluted with water and/or are soluble or clispcrsible or emulsifiable in the organochemical solvents employed, in particular binders composed of, or comprising, an acrylate resin, a vinyl resin, for example polyvinyl acetate, polyester resin, polycondensation or polyaddition resin, polyurethane resin, alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin, phenol resin, hydrocarbon resin, such as indene/coumarone resin, silicone resin, drying vegetable and/or drying oils and/or physically drying binders based on a natural and/or synthetic resin.<br>
The synthetic resin used as the tinder can be employed in the form of an emulsion, dispersion or solution. Up to 10% by weight of bitumen or bituminous substances can also be used as binders. In addition, colorants, pigments, water repellents, odor-masking substances and inhibitors or anticorrosives known per se and the like can also be employed.<br>
The composition or the concentrate preferably comprises, in accordance with the invention, at least one alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin and/or a drying vegetable oil as the<br><br>
organochcinical binder. Preferably used according to the invention are alkyd resins with an , oil content of over 45% by weight, preferably 50 to 68% by weight.<br>
All or some of the abovcmentioncd binder can be replaced by a fixative (mixture) or a plasticizer (mixture). These additives are intended to prevent volatilization of the active compounds and crystallization or precipitation. They preferably replace 0.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100% of the binder employed).<br>
The plasticizers are from the chemical classes of the phthalic esters, such as dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate or benzyl butyl phthalate, the phosphoric esters, such as tributyl phosphate, the adipic esters, such as di-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, the stearates, such as butyl stearate or amyl stearate, the oleatcs, such as butyl oleate, the glycerol ethers or relatively high-molccular-weight glycol ethers, glycerol esters and p-toluenesulfonic esters.<br>
Fixatives are chemically based on polyvinyl alkyl ethers, such as, for example, polyvinyl methyl ether, or ketones, such as benzophenone or ethylenebenzophenone.<br>
Particularly suitable as a solvent or diluent is also water, if appropriate as a mixture with one or more of the abovementioned organochemical solvents or diluents, emulsifiers and dispcrsants.<br>
Particularly effective protection of wood is achieved by large-scale industrial impregnation processes, for example vacuum, double-vacuum or pressure processes.<br>

I.	Hcibicidal post-emergence action<br>
Seeds of inonocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weed and crop plants are placed into sandy loam in wood fiber pots or in plastic pots, covered with soil and cultivated in a greenhouse, during the vegetation period also outdoors outside of the greenhouse, under good growth conditions. The test plants are treated 2-3 weeks after sowing at the one- to three-leaf stage. The test compounds, formulated as wettable powders (WP) or emulsifiable concentrates (EC) are, in various dosages with a water application rate of 300 1/ha (converted), with wetting agent (0.2 to 0.3%) added, sprayed onto the plants and the surface of the soil. The effect of the preparations is rated visually 3-4 weeks after the treatment of the test plants in comparison to untreated controls (herbicidal effect in percent (%): 100% effect - the plants have died, 0% effect = like control plants).<br>
Use of safeners<br>
If it is additionally to be tested as to whether safeners can improve the plant compatibility of test substances in the case of crop plants, the following options are used for applying the safener:<br>
seeds of the crop plants are, before sowing, dressed with the safener substance (the amount of safener is stated in percent, based on the weight of the seed)<br>
before the application of the test substances, the crop plants are sprayed with the safener at a certain application rate per hectare (usually 1 day before the application of the test substances)<br>
the safener is applied together with the test substance as a tank mix (the amount of safener is stated in g/ha or as a ratio, based on the herbicide).<br>
By comparing the effect of the test substances on crop plants without or with safener treatment, il is possible to assess the effect of the safener substance.<br><br>
