3.    PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br>
The invention relates to a workstation of a winding machine according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
Feed bobbins, preferably spinning cops produced on ring spinning machines, which contain relatively small yarn volumes, are rewound to form large-volume cross-wound bobbins on the workstations of such winding machines. During the rewinding process, the yarn is also monitored for yarn defects, yarn defects being cut out and replaced by thread splices which are virtually identical to the yarn.<br>
The winding speeds, with which so-called automatic cross-winding machines of this type operate, in this case, are generally limited to below 2,000 m/min because of various physical factors, in particular owing to the thread tensile forces occurring during the rewinding process. In other words, during a rewinding process, in which the thread is taken off, for example, by means of a rotating thread balloon over the head of the spinning cop, the thread tensile force acting on the running thread increases sharply, in particular during the last third of the cop travel. If no effective counter measures are taken, the thread tensile force can increase, in this case, during the course of the cop travel, to a multiple of the starting thread tensile force and this substantially increases the risk of thread breaks. As thread breaks do not only negatively influence the quality of the cross-wound bobbin, but also reduce the degree of efficiency of automatic cross-winding machines of this type, there have been attempts for a long time to develop apparatuses, by means of which the run-off behaviour of feed bobbins during the rewinding process is improved, but at least the thread tensile forces that occur can be kept below a critical range.<br>
A device of this type for limiting the thread tensile force that increases during the course of the cop travel is described for example in CH-PS 669 177. In this known device, a control in the winding speed and therefore also in the thread take-off speed takes place as a function of the residual thread quantity on the feed bobbin. In other words, in this device, at the beginning of the cop travel, winding initially takes place<br>
-2-<br><br>
at a relatively high winding speed, but the winding speed at the end of the cop travel is reduced to a non-critical level.<br>
To limit the thread tensile force during the rewinding process, it has already been proposed to design the bobbin receiving mandrel, on which the feed bobbin is positioned during the rewinding process, to be drivable. A rotatably mounted bobbin receiving mandrel of this type for a feed bobbin is described, for example, in CH-PS 542 781 in conjunction with a precision cross-winding machine. The bobbin receiving mandrel is connected, in this case, via a drive belt to a drive drum, which is mounted on a constantly rotating drive shaft along the machine and can be connected in a targeted manner, to the drive shaft via an electromagnetic coupling. When the diameter of the take-up bobbin, for example a cross-wound bobbin, driven by its take-up spindle has reached a certain dimension and therefore there is a very high thread take-off speed, a corresponding device ensures that the bobbin receiving mandrel of the feed bobbin is rotated counter to the unwinding direction of the thread.<br>
Although a limitation or a reduction could be achieved with these known devices in the thread tensile force that continuously increases during a cop travel without corresponding measures, it was not, however, possible to eliminate a further disadvantageous physical factor, namely the strong variation in the take-off speed of the thread during the rewinding process by means of these devices. This strong variation in the thread take-off speed, which results from the traversing of the thread when winding a cross-wound bobbin, leads, during the rewinding process, to substantial thread tensile force peaks, which substantially limit the thread take-off speed which can be realised in practice. In other words, the running thread is alternately relatively sharply accelerated and decelerated during the production of a cross-wound bobbin by the traversing of the thread with the result that the thread is taken off the feed bobbin at constantly changing take-off speeds. The speed differences may be up to 40%, in this case, depending on the respective transfer angle of the thread on the cross-wound bobbin.<br>
-3-<br><br>
It is also known of spinning machines, for example open rotor spinning machines or friction spinning machines, to take off the threads that are produced in the spinning units of these textile machines at a constant speed, by means of an associated thread take-off device, in the interests of yarn parameters remaining the same, at a thread speed that is also constant.<br>
The winding speeds, in this case, are below the winding speeds of winding machines when rewinding feed bobbins, approximately by a power of ten.<br>
Winding machines are furthermore known from DE-AS 22 15 003 or DE-OS 20 18 375, the winding heads of which are equipped, in each case, with a thread take-off device arranged above a feed bobbin and a downstream device for temporarily receiving a substantial quantity of thread to, for example, allow a connection of two thread ends without an interruption of the rewinding process being necessary for this.<br>
In the device described in DE-OS 20 18 375 for controlling the yarn supply into a supply container, the winding heads in each case have a thread take-off device, which takes off the thread from the feed bobbin at a speed, which is 10 to 30% above the winding speed of the winding device. The thread taken off the feed bobbin, on its way to the supply container, runs, monitored by sensor, to an injector, which conveys the thread into the supply container, the filling state of which is also monitored and is supplemented if necessary.<br>
The winding heads of the winding machine described in DE-AS 22 15 003 in each case have a thread take-off device, a rotatably mounted thread storage device equipped with a brush-like surface and a drive drum for the frictional driving of a take-up bobbin. All the thread handling devices of the winding head are acted upon, in this case, by a common drive source.<br>
-4-<br><br>
Proceeding from the aforementioned prior art, the invention is based on the object of improving winding machines of the aforementioned type, in other words, to optimise the workstations of such winding machines with the effect that the workstations can operate at a significantly higher winding speed without the risk of thread breaks being significantly increased thereby.<br>
The object is achieved according to the invention by a workstation, as described in claim 1.<br>
Advantageous configurations of the invention are the subject of the sub-claims.<br>
In the workstations according to the invention it was possible to eliminate the problems described above in that the winding process is divided into two separate, simultaneously proceeding work processes. In other words, the take-off of the thread from the spinning cop and the winding of the cross-wound bobbin on the winding device are separated from one another in such a way that the take-off of the thread from the spinning cop is not influenced by the traversing of the thread during the production of the cross-wound bobbin. According to the invention, the thread is taken off the spinning cop by a thread take-off device at a speed which is independent of the variation caused by traversing and, on its way to the cross-wound bobbin, runs through a thread store, which ensures, on the one hand, that during the winding of the cross-wound bobbin, in other words, during the traversing of the thread running onto the cross-wound bobbin, there is always sufficient thread length available and which, on the other hand, prevents the variations in the thread speed occurring due to the traversing of the thread from negatively influencing the thread take-off at the spinning cop.<br>
As the thread store substantially only has to take up a quantity of thread which is matched to the thread requirement that changes owing to the thread traversing, the storage volume is to be managed non-critically and this is important, in particular at the high winding speeds.<br>
-5-<br><br>
Owing to the use of a thread store according to the invention, high thread tension peaks can be largely avoided, so the take-off speed, at which the thread is taken off the spinning cop, can be clearly increased.<br>
Furthermore, the thread store according to the invention ensures that, during the winding of the cross-wound bobbin, a minimum thread tension is always provided and this is very important for producing a proper cross-wound bobbin. The device according to the invention therefore leads not only to an improvement in the degree of efficiency of the winding machine, but also to an increase in quality of the finished cross-wound bobbins.<br>
As described in claim 2, in an advantageous embodiment, a sensor device is associated with the thread store and is connected to a workstation computer. Moreover, a control loop including the winding station computer and the drive of the thread take-off device is present and controls the thread take-off device in such a way that a quantity of thread which lies within predeterminable tolerance limits is always stored in the thread store. It is thus ensured that the thread store always stores a quantity of thread such that compensation of the quantity of thread required by the thread traversing is reliably ensured.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment described in claim 3, the thread store is arranged directly upstream from an upper thread guide in the thread running direction, which forms the starting point for the traversing triangle of the thread. In an arrangement of this type, the changing thread requirement that occurs during traversing of a thread to produce a cross-wound bobbin is reliably compensated.<br>
In an alternative embodiment it is also possible, however, to position the thread store in the region of the thread take-off device (claim 4). In an arrangement of this type, the thread take-off being negatively influenced by the thread traversing is also avoided.<br>
-6-<br><br>
The thread store is advantageously configured, as described in claim 5, as a pneumatically loadable thread store. Such pneumatic stores are economical to implement and, as long as a certain quantity of thread is not exceeded, allow reliable and simple storage of a running thread.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, instead of a pneumatically loadable thread store, the use of a mechanically operating thread store is also possible (claim 6). Such mechanically operating thread stores have the advantage that they can also reliably store relatively large quantities of thread if required and this can provide advantages, for example, in the production of conical cross-wound bobbins.<br>
As described in claim 7, a thread clearer is arranged in the region between the spinning cop and the thread take-off device and scans the thread running at a uniform speed in this region for irregularities and, if necessary, starts a thread cutting device. The measuring results of the thread clearer are, in this case, always very precise, in particular with regard to the length of the defect locations. When clearing out thread defects, the "safety allowances", which were previously conventional, can therefore be dispensed with, which becomes apparent in a positive manner by a reduction in the yarn waste and, correspondingly, by an increase in the degree of efficiency of the winding machine.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment described in claim 8 it is provided that the winding heads also have a drive device to rotate the spinning cop in the unwinding position and a further second thread store. The drive device for the spinning cop and the thread take-off device are, in this case, driven, for example by a single motor in such a way that the thread is removed at a predeterminable, uniform take-off speed from the spinning cop.<br>
The second thread store interposed between the spinning cop and the thread take-off device, in this case, reliably compensates variations in thread quantity, such as occur, for example, when unwinding a spinning cop, because of its cop winding. In the<br>
-7-<br><br>
embodiment described in claim 8, the thread clearer is preferably positioned either directly upstream from or directly downstream from the thread take-off device, but always upstream from the first thread store. In the two embodiments it is ensured that the thread clearer scans a thread, which runs at a virtually constant speed in this region.<br>
According to claim 9 it is provided that the spinning cop is advantageously positioned in a vertical or virtually vertical position during the unwinding process. When the spinning cop is positioned in this manner, the thread is taken off the thread take-off device over the head of the feed bobbin. In other words, the thread, when being taken off the spinning cop, forms a rotating thread balloon, which leads to a relatively gentle detachment of the thread from the winding of the feed bobbin. The vertical orientation of the feed bobbin also provides advantages in the positioning of the feed bobbin in the unwinding position. In other words, in so-called compound machines, the feed bobbins supplied on transporting plates to the winding heads can be driven directly into the unwinding position. The feed bobbins, in this case, already have the required orientation.<br>
In the case of round magazine machines, the feed bobbins configured as spinning cops are generally stored in a round magazine arranged above the winding position and can easily be brought via a cop slide into their working position on a bobbin receiving mandrel. A vertical orientation of the feed bobbins overall allows a compact, space-saving construction of the unwinding region.<br>
In an alternative embodiment described in claim 10, the supply bobbin is rotated in the unwinding direction and is arranged in such a way that its rotational axis adopts a substantially horizontal position. In an arrangement of this type, the thread is unwound tangentially from the driven feed bobbin.<br>
-8-<br><br>
A tangential unwinding of this type leads to a particularly gentle detachment of the thread from the supply bobbin and therefore makes very high thread take-off speeds possible with sharply reduced thread damage.<br>
In the vertical arrangement of the spinning cop described in claim 9, a special drive device may also be provided for the defined rotation of the feed bobbin. The thread tensile force, in particular in the case of high winding speeds, can be further reduced by a drive arrangement of this type.<br>
The invention will be described in more detail below with the aid of the embodiments shown in the drawings, in which:<br>

Fig. 2 shows a further embodiment of workstation of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins, with a first thread store in the region of a thread guide, which forms the starting point of a traversing triangle of the thread,<br>
Fig. 3 shows a front view of a further embodiment of a workstation of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins, with a thread traversing device configured as finger thread guide,<br>
Fig. 4 shows a further embodiment of a workstation of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins, with a drive device for rotating a feed bobbin positioned in a vertical orientation, a thread take-off device, a thread clearer arranged upstream from the thread take-off device in the thread running direction and first and second thread stores arranged upstream and downstream from the thread take-off device in the thread running path,<br>
-9-<br><br>
Fig. 5 shows a further embodiment of a workstation of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins, with the devices shown in Fig. 4 and a drivable feed bobbin, which has a horizontal orientation.<br>
Figs. 1, 2 and 4, 5 schematically show, in each case in a side view, a workstation 1 of an automatic cross-winding machine 22. Automatic cross-winding machines 22 of this type have a plurality of such workstations 1 arranged next to one another in a row between their end frames (not shown). Feed bobbins, generally spinning cops 2, which are produced, for example, on ring spinning machines (not shown), are rewound to form large-volume cross-wound bobbins 13 on these workstations or winding heads 1. The workstations 1 are equipped for this purpose with various handling and thread checking devices, which can be activated in a defined manner, in each case, by a workstation's own control device, a so-called winding head computer 5. In other words, the workstations 1 have a winding device for producing a cross-wound bobbin 13, a device 7 for the pneumatic connection of thread ends after a thread break or a clearer cut or further thread handling devices.<br>
The winding device has, for example, a creel 14 for rotatably holding a cross-wound bobbin 13 and a thread guide drum 12 for frictional driving of the cross-wound bobbin 13 and simultaneous traversing of the thread 30 running onto the cross-wound bobbin 13 in the thread running direction F. Instead of the thread guide drum 12 shown in Figs. 1, 2 and 4, 5, the use of a pure drive drum 33 as indicated in Fig. 3, is obviously also possible. In a case such as this, the thread traversing takes place by means of a separate thread guide 34. A separate thread guide of this type may, for example, as shown in Fig. 3 be configured as a finger thread guide 34.<br>
To handle the thread ends after a thread break or a controlled cut of the thread clearer, a suction nozzle 15 which can be loaded with negative pressure and is rotatably mounted about a pivot pin 17 and a gripper tube 19 which can be loaded by negative pressure and is pivotably mounted about a pivot pin 20 are provided. In other words, the suction nozzle 15 and the gripper tube 19, if necessary, transport<br>
-10-<br><br>
the thread ends to the pneumatically operating splicing device 7 in which the thread ends of the upper and lower thread are then intermingled to form a connection which is virtually identical to the yarn.<br>
In the region of the thread running path of such textile machines, a thread tensioner 6 and optionally a paraffin waxing device 10 are also provided.<br>
As can be seen in particular from the figures, a thread take-off device 16 is installed above the feed bobbin 2 and takes off the thread 30 from the spinning cop 2. The thread take-off device 16 preferably has a single drive 32, which is connected via a control line 26 to the workstation computer 5. The thread 30 which is taken off the spinning cop 2 by the thread take-off device 16 at a thread take-off speed Vconst. that is independent of variations caused by traversing, runs off, for example in the direction of rotation R, over the head of the spinning cop 2, and, in this case, forms a thread balloon 3, which is limited by a thread guide 4 arranged above the spinning cop 2. According to the embodiments of Figs. 1 and 2, the supply bobbin 2 is arranged, in this case, on a fixed bobbin receiving mandrel.<br>
A thread clearer 8 and a thread cutting device 9, which are connected to the winding head computer 5 via signal or control lines 27, 28, are preferably positioned in the thread running path upstream from the thread take-off device 16. According to the embodiment of Fig. 1, a thread store 23 is arranged in the thread running direction F downstream from the thread take-off device 16 and, as indicated, is preferably configured as a pneumatic thread store.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, a mechanical thread store (not shown) may also obviously be used.<br>
The thread store 23, for example, has a thread store tube 11, which is connected via a negative pressure line 29 to a negative pressure source (not shown) and can be loaded with a negative pressure in a defined manner. In addition, the thread store 23<br>
-11 -<br><br>
has a sensor device 24 for monitoring the filling state of the thread store tube 11. The sensor device 24 is also connected in this case to the winding head computer 5 via a signal line 25.<br>
Furthermore, a control loop including the winding head computer 5 and the drive 32 of the thread take-off device 16 is present, by means of which the thread take-off device 16 is activated in such a way that a quantity of thread lying within predeterminable tolerance limits is always stored in the thread store 23. In other words, the thread store 23 compensates the changing thread requirement that occurs during winding of a cross-wound bobbin 13 because of the thread traversing and prevents the thread speed variations triggered by the thread traversing from being able to be effective into the region of the spinning cop 2.<br>
The embodiment of a workstation shown in Fig. 2 differs from the embodiment according to Fig. 1 only with respect to the arrangement of the thread store 23. In other words, in the embodiment according to Fig. 2, the thread store 23 is arranged immediately upstream from an upper stationary thread guide 18 in the thread running direction, which forms the starting point of a traversing triangle 21 passed over by the thread 30. The thread store 29 is preferably also configured as a pneumatic thread store here, into which the thread 30 is drawn with the formation of a thread loop. As can be seen from Fig. 2 and already described above using the embodiment of Fig. 1, a pneumatic thread store 23 of this type known per se has a thread store tube 11, which can be loaded by means of a negative pressure line 29 in a defined manner with negative pressure. A sensor device 24 is also provided here in the region of the thread store tube 11 and monitors the respective filling state of the thread store tube 11 and controls the quantity of thread in the thread store 23 via a control loop, which comprises the winding head computer 5 and the drive 32 of the thread take-off device 16.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a front view of a slightly modified embodiment of a workstation 1 of an automatic cross-winding machine 22. In this embodiment, a cross-wound bobbin 13<br>
-12-<br><br>
rotatably held in a creel 14 rests with its surface on a drive roller 33, which is acted upon by a single drive 35. The drive 35 is connected, in this case, via a control line 37 to the winding head computer 5. To traverse the thread 30, a finger thread guide 34 is provided, the drive 36 of which is also connected to the winding head computer 5 via a control line 38. As shown, a pneumatic thread store 23, the thread store tube 11 of which is monitored by a sensor device 24, which is connected via a signal line 25 to the winding head computer 5, is arranged below a stationary thread guide 18, which forms the starting point for the traversing triangle 21.<br>
The thread 30 delivered by a thread take-off device 16, not shown in Fig. 3, at a takeoff speed (Vconst.) that is independent of variation caused by traversing in the thread running direction F before it is wound onto the cross-wound bobbin 13 in crossing layers by the thread guide 34, is also firstly sucked into the thread store 23 in this embodiment. In other words, the thread 30, on its way to the cross-wound bobbin, initially forms a thread loop inside the thread store tube 11. During the traversing of the thread 30, the constantly changing thread requirement is compensated automatically by means of a corresponding control loop by reducing or enlarging this thread loop. The thread section extending upstream from the thread store 23 in the thread running path remains completely unaffected by the speed variations of the running thread 30 triggered by the traversing. In other words, the thread take-off is not in any way impaired in the region of the supply bobbin 2.<br>
The embodiments shown in Figs. 4 and 5 of a workstation 1 of an automatic cross-winding machine 22 differ from the embodiments shown in Figs. 1 and 2, on the one hand, by the configuration of their unwinding device and, on the other hand, by the number and arrangement of the thread stores.<br>
In other words, in the embodiments according to Figs. 4 and 5, the supply bobbin 2 is no longer firmly fixed in its run-off position, but rotatably mounted in a defined manner, in each case, via a drive device 40.<br>
-13-<br><br>
The feed bobbin 2 in its run-off position, either has, as indicated in Fig. 4, a vertical orientation or is positioned, as can be seen in Fig. 5, in such a way that its rotational axis runs approximately horizontally.<br>
In the two cases, a drive device 40 is provided in each case in the region of the runoff position for the defined rotation of the supply bobbin 2. The drive device 40, the electric motor single drive 51 of which is connected to the winding head computer 5 via a control line 41, in this case, generally has a brake device 48, which, for example, allows rapid stopping of the supply bobbin 2 fixed on a rotatable bobbin receiving mandrel in the event of a thread break.<br>
As also indicated in Figs. 4 and 5, a further second thread store 61 is installed following a thread guide 4 arranged above the feed bobbin 2, in addition to the thread store 23 already described in connection with Figs. 1 to 3. The thread store 61, in this case, is preferably also configured as a pneumatic thread store, into which, as indicated, the thread 30 detached from the supply bobbin 2 is drawn with the formation of a thread loop. As can be seen from Figs. 4 and 5 and already described above using the embodiment of Fig. 1, a pneumatic thread store 61 of this type known per se, for example, has a thread store tube, which can be loaded via a negative pressure line 29, in a defined manner, with negative pressure. A sensor device 24 is also provided here in the region of the thread store tube and monitors the respective filling state of the thread store tube and, regulates, for example, the negative pressure in the thread store 21 preferably via the winding head computer 5, according to the filling state of the thread store 21. The sensor device 24 is connected for this purpose to the winding head computer 5 via a signal line 25.<br>
As known from the embodiment according to Fig. 1, a thread take-off device 16, the drive 32 of which is connected to the winding head computer 5 via a control line 26 is also provided for the uniform take-off of the thread 30 from the supply bobbin 2. As can also be seen from Figs. 4 and 5, a thread clearer 8 and a thread cutting device 9 are positioned, in each case, upstream from the thread take-off device 16 and are<br>
-14-<br><br>
connected, in each case, to the winding head computer 5 via signal or control lines<br>
27, 28.<br>
The thread clearer 8 and the thread cutting device 9 may, however, in an alternative embodiment, also be positioned directly downstream from the thread take-off device 16, but upstream from the thread store 23 already described above, viewed in the thread running direction.<br>
While the thread 30 runs off the spinning cop 2 as a thread balloon 3 as conventional, in the embodiment according to Fig. 4, the thread 30 is taken off tangentially from the supply bobbin 2 in the embodiment according to Fig. 5. In the two cases, the thread 30 is guided in a thread guide 4 before it is sucked into the thread store 61.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
The invention relates to a working spot of a winding frame, comprising a creel for rotatable supporting a cross-wound bobbin, a device for rotating the cross-wound bobbin, a thread guide for traversing and a thread take-off device which removes a thread from a spinning cop. According to the invention, the thread take-off device (16) removes the thread (30) from the spinning cop (2) at a take-off speed (Vconst.) which is independent of any deviations caused by the traversing. A thread storage (23) is disposed downstream of the thread take-off device (16), when seen in the direction of threadline, and is adapted to the changing thread requirement caused by the traversing of the thread (30)<br>
