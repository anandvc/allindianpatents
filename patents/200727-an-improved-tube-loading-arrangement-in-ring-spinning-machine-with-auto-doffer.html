				<td>Technical Field:<br>
The present invention relates to an improved tube loading arrangement in ring spinning machine with auto doffer which facilitates reduction in the cycle time required for loading the pre determined number of pegs with conical tubes by the tube loading arrangement before the completion of the cop built up cycle . This results in the elimination of the down time of the machine for want of required number of conical tubes underneath the spindle rail   for exchange with full bobbins.<br>
Background art <br>
The usage of ring spinning machines for the production of yam is known. Normally the ring spinning machine comprises a spindle rail to carry predetermined number of spindles arranged at predetermined pitch arranged on both side of the machine. The conical tubes on which the yam is wound are fitted to the spindles and driven by suitable drive means. Ring rails arranged coaxial to the spindle rail and carries spinning ring and traveler assembly of same number and pitch as that of spindle. The ring rails further provided with means for travel up and down in a direction traverse to the spindle axis for the built up of yam on to the conical tubes attached to the revolving spindles.<br>
Roving bobbins of equal number as that of the spindles are arranged in a creel member attached to the ring spinning machine for the introduction of roving into the drafting arrangement through suitable guide means and drafted . The drafting arrangement is normally provided with plurality of bottom drafting rollers driven by suitable drive means. Guide arms attached to the drafting system support the top rollers and provide the required drafting pressure to the drafting rollers through suitable means. The drafted roving is subsequently wound on the conical tubes attached to the revolving spindles by the ring and ring traveler assembly and the cop built up takes place.<br>
Soon after the conical tubes are filled with predetermined length of yam , the spindles are stopped and the cop is replaced with empty conical tubes and the machine is subsequently re started.<br>
Modem ring spirming machines are constmcted with spindles in the order 1200 and above. Replacing the cops with empty conical tubes which is normally known as doffing and manual doffing of such large number of spindles is uneconomical. Modem Ring Spinning machines employ auto doffers in which plurality of conical tubes are arranged along the row of spindles so that each conical tube is positioned in front of respective spindle, and the ftill bobbins otherwise known as cops on the spindle are exchanged with conical tubes.<br>
In certain doffers the removal of the cops from the spindles and preparation of conical tubes thereto are carried out by a common conveyor comprising a steel belt extending on each side of the spinning frame and driven by suitable drive means. The steel belt carries plurality of pegs     for  mounting    the cops/ conical tube thereon,<br><br>
which pegs are secured at an accurate pitch corresponding to the spindle pitch so that an exact correspondence between the peg and spindle is obtained when the doffing operation is carried out.<br>
Certain modem auto doffers employ mechanism of pegs moving in peg trays to carry and position the conical tubes and also to receive the cops at the exact location. The doffer comprises a tube loader, gripper rail , intermediate peg rail and peg tray. The peg tray forms a closed loop and carries pegs. Conical tubes are loaded into the pegs arranged in the peg tray by the tube loader and transported to the doffing zone. During the doffing cycle the pegs are exchanged with the cops and subsequently transported to the unloading zone of the machine. At the unloading end suitable means are provided to unload the cops and the pegs are transported to the tube loading area where the conical tubes are loaded on to the pegs by the tube loader and subsequently transported to the doffing zone. In this manner the pegs move around the machine to receive and transport the empty conical tubes or the cops as the case may be.<br>
Most of the modem ring spirming machines are provided with auto doffers for the exchange of cops with empty conical tubes at the end of the cop built up cycle . Pegs are arranged in peg tray and are being displaceable in a closed loop in between the tube loading zone and the cop un loading zone. It is necessary to provide equal number empty conical tubes arranged on pegs underneath the spindle rails before the end of the cop built up. The pegs carrying the cops are transported to the un loading zone of the ring spirming machine where the cops are unloaded and the empty pegs alone are displaced to the tube loading zone of the ring spinning machine. Tube loaders forms part of the auto doffer which is provided with means for stacking empty conical tubes . The tube loaders are fiarther provided with means for loading the empty conical tubes on to the empty pegs one after the other. The pegs loaded with the empty conical tubes are subsequently displaced underneath the spindle rail for exchange with the cops by the auto doffer of the ring spinning machine at the end of the cop built up cycle The known auto doffers employ unitary tube loading arrangement for loading the conical tubes into the peg which are subsequently positioned undemeath the spindle rail for the exchange with cops during doffing cycle. The known tube loaders are capable of loading 20 to 25 conical tubes per minute approximately. In the modem ring spinning machines having 1200 and above spindles ,the time required for loading the conical tubes is comparatively more. While processing coarser counts, the time required for loading of the conical tubes are much more than that of the time required for cop build up. This especially affects the efficiency of the machine while spinning coarser yam counts, since the spindles has to be stopped for a considerable duration of time for want of empty conical tubes for exchange with cops.<br><br>
Objective of the invention:<br>
In order to eliminate the aforesaid drawback, the present invention is directed towards the usage of plurality of tube loading arrangement for loading the conical tubes. This facilitates in the reduction of time required^ for loading of the conical tubes on the pegs there^by It is possible to bring down the cycle time required for loading of the conical tubes well within the cop build up time, even during spinning very coarser yam.<br>
The invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig 1 illustrates the auto doffer arrangement.<br>
Fig.2 illustrates the tube loading arrangement in ring spinning machine with   known auto doffer.<br>

tube loading arrangement comprising magazine (10) loaded with plurality of conical tubes (9), guide (13) , drum (11) to carry and transfer said conical tubes (9) through the said guide (13) on to plurality of pegs (8) present underneath the said guide (13), indexing means for indexing of said drum (11) ;<br>
characterized in that the improved tube loading arrangement comprising plurality of magazines (10), plurality of drums(l 1), plurality of guides (13) and indexing means (12) for indexing said plurality of drums(ll).<br>
Details of the invention:<br>
In figure 1, plurality of the spindle is indicated by reference numeral (1 ). Reference numeral (2 ) denotes plurality of the spindle rail. Plurality of gripper rail is represented by reference numeral (3) and plurality of the gripper by (4). Plurality of the intermediate peg rail is indicated by reference numeral<br>
(5 ) while (6 ) indicates the plurality of intermediates peg. Peg tray is represented by reference numeral (7) and the peg is shown by the reference numeral (8 ).<br><br>
In the tube loading arrangement in ring spinning machine with auto doffer of the known ring spinning frame shown in Fig 2, plurality of conical tubes (9 ) are loaded in the magazine(10 ) of the tube loader. Said conical tubes (9) are guided and loaded in the drum(ll ). Said drum (11) is indexed by indexing means , for example by the cylinder (12) by suitable means, for example by pneumatic means. Due to indexing of said drum (11) at a pre determined interval and pre determined angle, said conical tube (9) are guided by the guide (13) and dropped on said peg (8 ) present underneath the guide (13 ). Said plurality of pegs (8) are displaceable in a closed loop in said peg tray (7) and means are provided for displacing the plurality of pegs (8) . Soon after loading of said peg (8 ) with a conical tube , the next peg is displaced to the loading position for receiving the next conical tube delivered by said drum(l 1 ).<br>
In the improved tube loading arrangement in ring spinning machine with auto doffer according to the present invention shovm in Fig 3., plurality of conical tubes (9 ) are loaded in the plurality of magazines (10 ) of the tube loader. Said conical tubes (9) are guided and loaded in the plurality of drums (11). Said drums ( 11 ) are indexed by plurality of indexing means (12) for example by cylinders by suitable means, for example by pneumatic means .Due to indexing of said drums(ll) at a pre determined interval and predetermined angle, said conical tubes (9) present in the said plurality of drums (1 l)are guided by plurality of guides (13) and dropped on said pegs (8) present imdemeath said guides (13 ). Said plurality of pegs (8) being displaceable in a closed loop in said peg tray (7) and means being provided for displacing said plurality of pegs (8) exactly beneath the plurality of guides (13). Displacing means pushes the pegs loaded with the conical tubes and further two empty pegs are positioned beneath said plurality of guides (13 ) to receive further conical tubes (9) delivered by said plurality of drums (11).<br>
Working of the machine:<br>
The yam produced by the spinning machine is wound on the conical tubes mounted on the plurality of rotating spindles(l) shown in figure 1 and the cops are produced.<br>
While cop built up progresses, the 1^' phase of the doffing cycle is initiated . The tube loader is actuated and loading of plurality of conical tubes(9) on the plurality of pegs (8) progress till such time pre determined number of pegs loaded with conical tubes are displaced to a pre determined position underneath the spindle rail (2) for exchange with cops. The displacement of plurality of pegs (8) with conical tubes in the peg tray (7) also displaces the pegs loaded with cops during the previous doffing cycle , towards the unloading section of the machine where the plurality of cops are dropped from the pegs. The pegs alone are further displaced towards the tube loading section to receive and convey further conical tubes (9).<br>
The plurality of conical tubes (9) present in the pegs (8) present underneath the plurality spindle rails(2) are gripped by the plurality of grippers(4) and placed on the plurality of intermediate pegs (6) present in the plurality of intermediate peg rail (5).<br><br>
Soon after the cop built up is completed, the Z"** phase of doffing cycle is initiated. During this period the spindles (1) are halted, the cops are doffed by the plurality of grippers ( 4 ) present in the plurality of gripper rail (3) and loaded on the plurality of pegs (8) present underneath the spindle rail(2). Subsequently the plurality of conical tubes (9) present in the intermediate pegs (6) are transferred to the plurality of spindles (1). The spindles are then re-started and cop built up progresses.<br>
Advantage of the invention:<br>
Since plurality of tube loading arrangement is employed for loading the conical tubes, the time required for loading the pre-determined number of pegs are reduced. For example if "T" minutes is required for loading pre determined number of pegs in the known tube loader, the time required for loading the same number of pegs using the present invention, for example by using two tube loading arrangement, will be approximately 0,5 to 0,6 "T" minutes.<br>
By this invention it is possible to reduce the time required for loading plurality of conical tubes on the plurality of peg less than the cycle time required for the cop build up . This is true , even while spinning the coarsest possible sliver count. This enhances the efficiency of the machine, since the necessity of stopping the spindles for a considerable duration of time for want of empty conical tubes for exchange with cops is totally eliminated.<br>
