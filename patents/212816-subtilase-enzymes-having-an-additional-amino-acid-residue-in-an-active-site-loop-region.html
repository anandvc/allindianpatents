Title;  Subtilase enzymes of the I-Sl and I-S2 sub-groups having an additional amino acid residue in an active site loop region.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to novel subtilase enzymes of the I-Sl and I-S2 sub-groups having at least one additional amino acid residue in position 95 of the active site loop (b) region from position 95 to 103. These proteases are useful exhibiting excellent or improved wash performance when used in detergents; cleaning and detergent compositions. The invention further relates to genes coding for the expression of said enzymes when inserted into a suitable host cell or organism; and such host cells transformed therewith and capable of expressing said enzyme variants, and methods for producing the novel enzymes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the detergent industry enzymes have for more than 30 years been implemented in washing formulations* Enzymes used in such formulations comprise proteases, lipases, amylases, cellulases, as well as other enzymes, or mixtures thereof. Commercially most important enzymes are proteases.<br>
An increasing number of commercially used proteases are protein engineered variants of naturally occurring wild type proteases, e.g. DURAZYM* (Novo Nordisk A/S), RELASE* (Novo Nordisk A/S) , MAXAPEM* (Gist-Brocades N.V,), PURAFECT* (Genencor International, Inc.),<br>
Further a number of protease variants are described in the art, such as in EP 130756 (GENENTECH) (corresponding to US Reissue Patent No. 34,606 (GENENCOR));  EP 214435 (HENKEL) ; WO 87/04461 (AMGEN) ; WO 87/05050 (GENEX) ; EP 260105 (GENENCOR) ; Thomas, Russell, and Freshet (1985) Nature 318 375-376; Thomas,<br><br>
Russell, and Fersht (1987) J. Mol.   Biol.   193 803-813/ Russel and Fersht Nature  328 496-500 (1987); WO 88/08028 (Genex); WO 88/08033 (Amgen); WO 95/27049 (SOLVAY S.A.); WO 95/30011 (PROCTER     GAMBLE COMPANY) ; WO 95/30010 (PROCTER L   GAMBLE COMPANY); WO 95/29979 (PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE COMPANY); US 5.543.302 (SOLVAY S-A,); EP 251 446 (GENENCOR); WO 89/06279 (NOVO NORDISK A/S) ; WO 91/00345 (NOVO NORDISK A/S) ; EP 525 610 Al (SOLVAY); and WO 94/02618 (GIST-BROCADES N.V.).<br>
However, even though a number of useful protease variants have been described, there is still a need for new improved proteases or protease variants for a number of industrial uses.<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention, is to provide improved proteases or protein engineered protease variants, especially for use in the detergent industry.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVEITTIGN<br>
The present inventors have found that subtilisins wherein at least one of the active site loops are longer than those presently known, exhibit improved wash performance properties in detergent compositions. The identification thereof was done in constructing subtilisin variants, especially of the subtilisin<br>
309 (BLSAVI or Savinase®) , exhibiting improved wash performance properties in detergent compositions relative to the parent wild type enzyme. This has been described in our earlier application DK1332/97.<br>
It has now been found that certain subtilases or variants thereof of the I-Sl (true '* subtilisins" ) and I-S2 (high alkaline subtilisins) sub-groups having at least- one additional amino acid residue in position 95 (or rather between positions 35 and 96) of the active site loop (b) region from position 95 :o 103, exhibit surprisingly improved wash performance in<br><br>
comparison to those presently known and those described in said application.<br>
The improved proteases according to the invention may be obtained by isolation from natural resources or by the introduction of at least one further amino acid residue (an insertion) in the active site loop (b) between positions 95 and 96 in a wild type subtilase (for a definition of the active site loops and the numbering of positions see below) .<br>
Although this finding was done in subtilisin 3 09 it is predicted that it will be possible to produce or isolate similar advantageous subtilases or subtilase variants.<br>
Furthermore it will be possible to specifically screen natural isolates to identify novel wild type subtilases comprising an active site loop (b) which is longer than the corresponding active site loop in known wild type subtilases, such as subtilisin 309, which subtilases can be considered to have an inserted amino acid residue between positions 95 and 96, and exhibiting excellent wash performance in a detergent, in comparison to their closest related known subtilisin, such as subtilisin 309.<br>
Concerning alignment and numbering reference is made to Figs- 1, la, 2 and 2a below showing alignments between subtilisin BPN' (BASBPN) (a) and subtilisin 309 (BLSAVI) (b) , and alignments between subtilisin BPN' (a) (BASBPN) and subtilisin Carlsberg (g). In Figs. 1 and 2 the alignments were established by the use of the GAP routine of the GCG package as indicated below, whereas the alignments of Figs, la and 2a are the same as shown in WO 91/00345, These alignments are in this patent application used as a reference for numbering the residues.<br>
The seven active site loops (a) to (g) (including both the end amino acid residues indicated) are here defined to encompass the amino acid residues in the segments given below<br><br>
(a)	the region between amino acid	residue 33 and 43;<br>
(b)	the region between amino acid	residue 95 and 103;<br>
(c)	the region between amino acid	residue 125 and 132;<br>
(d)	'	the region between amino acid	residue 153 and 173;<br>
(e)	the region between amino acid	residue 181 and 195;<br>
(f)	the region between amino acid	residue 202 and 204;<br>
(g)	the region between amino acid	residue 218 and 219.<br>
Accordingly, in a first aspect the invention relates to an isolated {i.e.  greater than 10 % pure) subtilase enzymes of the I-Sl and I-S2 sub-groups having at least on’  additional amino acid residue in position 95 of the active site loop (b) region from position 95 to 103, whereby said additional amino acid residue (s) correspond to the insertion of at least one amino acid residue between positions 95 and 96.<br>
In a second aspect the invention relates to an isolated DNA sequence encoding a subtilase variant of the invention.<br>
In a third aspect the invention relates to an expression vector comprising an isolated DNA sequence encoding a subtilase variant of the invention.<br>
In a fourth aspect the invention relates to a microbial host cell transformed with an expression vector according to the fourth aspect.<br>
In a further aspect the invention relates to the production of the subtilisin enzymes of the invention-<br>
The enzymes of the invention can generally be produced b either cultivation of a microbial strain from which the enzyme was isolated and recovering the enzyme in substantially pure form; or by inserting an expression vector according to the fourth aspect of the invention into a suitable microbial host,<br><br>
cultivating the host to express the desired subtilase enzyme, and recovering the enzyme product.<br>
Further the invention relates to a composition comprising a subtilase or subtilase variant of the invention.<br>
Even further the invention relates to the use of the enzymes of the invention for a number of industrial relevant uses, in particular for use in cleaning compositions and cleaning compositions comprising the mutant enzymes, especially detergent compositions comprising the mutant subtilisin enzymes,<br>

U      =   Uracil (only in RNA)<br>
NOMENCLATURE AND CONVENTIONS FOR DESIGNATION OF VARIANTS<br><br>
In describing the various enzyme variants produced or contemplated according to the invention, the following nomenclatures and conventions have been adapted for ease of reference:<br>
A frame of reference is first defined by aligning the isolated or parent wild type enzyme with subtilisin BPN' (BASBPN),<br>
The alignment can be obtained by the GAP routine of the GCG package version 9.1 to number the variants using the following parameters; gap creation penalty = 8 and gap extension penalty = 8 and all other parameters kept at their default values.<br>
Another method is to use known recognized alignments between subtilases, such as the alignment indicated in WO 91/00345. In most cases the differences will not be of any importance.<br>
Such alignments between subtilisin BPN' (BASBPN) and subtilisin 309 (BLSAVI) and subtilisin Carlsberg (BLSCAR), respectively are indicated in Figs. 1, la, 2, and 2a, By this a number of deletions and insertions will be defined in relation to BASBPN. In Fig, 1 subtilisin 309 has 6 deletions in positions 36, 58, 158, 162, 163, and 164 in comparison to BASBPN, whereas in Fig. la subtilisin 309 has the same deletions in positions 36, 56, 159, 164, 165, and 166 in comparison to BASBPN, In Fig. 2 subtilisin Carlsberg has one deletion in position 58 in comparison to BASBPN, whereas in Fig. 2a subtilisin Carlsberg has the one deletion in position 56 in comparison to BASBPN. These deletions are in Figs. 1, la, 2, and 2a indicated by apteryxes (*) ,<br>
The various modifications performed in a wild type enzyme is indicated in general using three elements as follows:<br><br>
Original amino acid position substituted amino acid<br>
The notation G195E thus means a substitution of a glycine in position 195 with a glutei acid.<br>
In the case when the original amino acid residue may be any amino acid residue, a short hand notation may at times be used indicating only the position and substituted amino acid,<br>
Position substituted amino acid<br>
Such a notation is particular relevant in connection with modification(s) in homologous subtilases {vide  infra).<br>
Similarly when the identity of the substituting amino acid residue(s) is immaterial.<br>
Original amino acid position<br>
When both the original amino acid(s) and substituted amino acid(s) may comprise any amino acid, then only the position is indicated, e.g,;  170.<br>
When the original amino acid(s) and/or substituted amino acid(s) may comprise more than one, but not all amino acid(s), then the selected amino acids are indicated inside brackets { },<br>
Original amino acid position (substituted amino acidic, . . . , substituted amino acidn}<br>
For specific variants the specific three or one letter codes are used, including the codes Axe and X to indicate any amino acid residue.<br>
SUBSTITUTIONS:<br><br>
The substitution of Glutei acid for glycine in position 195 is designated as:<br>
Glyl95Glu   or  G195E or the substitution of any amino acid residue acid for glycine in position 195 is designated as:<br>
Glyl95Xaa  or  G195X or<br>
Glyl95     or  G195<br>
The substitution of serine for any amino acid residue in position 170 would thus be designated Xaal70Ser  or  X170S.<br>
or<br>
170Ser     or   170S<br>
Such a notation is particular relevant in connection with modification (s) in homologous subtilases {vide infra).   l70Ser is thus meant to comprise e.g. both a Lysl70Ser modification in BASBPN and Argl70Ser modification in BLSAVI (cf. Fig. 1) .<br>
For a modification where the original amino acid(s) and/or substituted amino acid{s) may comprise more than one, but not all amino acid(s) , the substitution of glycine, alanine, serine or threonine for argentine in position 170 would be indicated by<br>
Argl70{Gly,Ala,Ser,Thr}    or R170{G,A,S,T} to indicate the variants<br>
R170G, R170A, R17dS,. and R170T.<br>
DELETIONS:<br>
A deletion of glycine  in position 195 will be  indicated by:<br>
Glyl95*	or       G195*<br><br>
Correspondingly the deletion of more than one amino acid residue, such as the deletion of glycine and leonine in positions 195 and 196 will be designated<br>
Glyl95*+Leul96*  or  G195*+L196*<br>
INSERTIONS:<br>
The insertion of an additional amino acid residue such as e.g.   a lysine after G195 is ;<br>
Glyl95GlyLys     or   G195GK; or when more than one amino acid residue is inserted, such as e.g. a Lys, Ala and Ser after G195 this is :<br>
Glyl95GlyLysAlaSer    or  G195GKAS<br>
In such cases the inserted amino acid residue (s) are numbered by the addition of lower case letters to the position number of the amino acid residue preceding the inserted amino acid residue (s). In the above example the sequences 194 to 196 would thus be:<br>
194 195 196 BLSAVI      A - G - L<br>
194 195 195a 195b 195c 196 Variant    A-G-K-  A-  S-  L<br>
In cases where an amino acid residue identical to the existing amino acid residue is inserted it is clear that a degeneracy in the nomenclature arises* If for example a glycine is inserted after the glycine in the above example this would be indicated by G195GG. The same actual change could just as well be indicated as A194AG for the change from<br>
194 195 196 BLSAVI      A - G - L<br><br>
to<br>
194 195  195a 196<br>
Variant    A - G -  G -  L<br>
194 194a 195  196<br>
Such instances will be apparent to the skilled person, and the indication G195GG and corresponding indications for this type of insertions are thus meant to comprise such equivalent degenerate indications.<br>
FILLING A GAP:<br>
Where  a  deletion in an enzyme  exists   in  the  reference comparison with  the  subtilisin BPN'   sequence  used for the numbering,   an  insertion  in such a position  is   indicated as:<br>
*3 6Asp	or        *36D<br>
for the  insertion of  an aspartic  acid in position 36<br>
MULTIPLE  MODIFICATIONS<br>
Variants  comprising multiple modifications are  separated by pluses,   e.g. :<br>
Argl70Tyr+Glyl95Glu       or       R170Y+G195E representing modifications  in positions   170  and  195  substituting tyrosine and glutamic  acid for argentine  and glycine,   respectively.<br>
or  e.g.   Tyrl67{Gly,Ala,Ser,Thr}+Argl70{Gly,Ala,Ser,Thr} designates the variants<br>
Tyrl67Gly+Argl70Gly,	Tyrl67Gly+Argl70Ala,<br>
Tyrl67Gly+Argl70Ser,	Tyrl67Gly+Argl70Thr,<br>
Tyrl67Ala+Argl70Gly,	Tyrl67Ala+Argl70Ala,<br>
Tyrl67Ala+Argl70Ser,	Tyrl67Ala+Argl70Thr,<br>
Tyrl67Ser+Argl70Gly,	Tyrl67Ser+Argl70Ala,<br>
Tyrl67Ser+Argl70Ser,	Tyrl67Ser-f-Argl70Thr,<br><br>
Tyrl67Thr+Argl70Gly,       Tyrl67Thr+Argl70Ala, Tyrl67Thr+Argl70Ser,   and Tyrl67Thr+Argl70Thr. This nomenclature is particular relevant relating to modifications aimed at substituting, replacing, inserting or deleting amino acid residues having specific common properties, such as residues of positive charge (K, R, H) , negative charge (D, E) , or conservative amino acid modification (s) of egg, Tyrl67{Gly,Ala,Ser,Thr}+Argl70{Gly,Ala,Ser,Thr}, which signifies substituting a small amino acid for another small amino acid. See section ‘'Detailed description of the invention" for further details.<br>
Proteases<br>
Enzymes cleaving the amide linkages in protein substrates ire classified as proteases, or (interchangeably) peptidases (see Walsh, 1979, Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms.   W,H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco, Chapter 3) .<br>
Numbering of amino acid positions/residues<br>
If nothing else is mentioned the amino acid numbering used herein correspond to that of the subtilase BPN" (BASBPN) sequence. For further description of the BPN’ sequence see Figs. 1 and 2, or Siezen et a J. , Protein Engng,   4 (1991) 119-131.<br>
Serine proteases<br>
A serine protease is an enzyme which catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, and in which there is an essential serine residue at the active site (White, Handler and Smith, 1973 'Principles of Biochemistry,'   Fifth Edition, McGraw-Hill Book Company, NY, pp- 271-272) .<br>
The bacterial serine proteases have molecular weights in the 20,000 to 45,000 Dalton range. They are inhibited by<br><br>
diisopropylfluorophosphate. They hydrolyze simple terminal ■ esters and are similar in activity to eukaryotic chymotrypsin, also a serine protease, A more narrow term, alkaline protease, covering a sub-group, reflects the high pH optimum of some of the serine proteases, from pH 9.0 to 11,0 (for review, see Priest (1977) Bacteriological    Rev,   41 711-753) .<br>
Subtilases<br>
A sub-group of the serine proteases tentatively designated subtilases has been proposed by Siezen et al.,   Protein Engng,   4 (1991) 719-737 and Siezen et al. Protein Science  6 (1997) 501-523 . They are defined by homology analysis of more than 170 amino acid sequences of serine proteases previously referred to as subtilisin-like proteases, A subtilisin was previously often defined as a serine protease produced by Gram-positive bacteria or fungi, and according to Siezen et al. now is a subgroup of the subtilases. A wide variety of subtilases have been identified, and the amino acid sequence of a number of subtilases has been determined. For a more detailed description of such subtilases and their amino acid sequences reference is made to Siezen et al. (1997).<br>
One subgroup of the subtilases, I~S1 or ' true# subtilisins, comprises the "classical" subtilisins, such as subtilisin 168 (BSS168), subtilisin BPN*, subtilisin Carlsberg (ALCALASE*, NOVO NORDISK A/S) , and subtilisin DY (BSSDY) .<br>
A further subgroup of the subtilases, I-S2 or high alkaline subtilisins, is recognised by Siezen et al.   (supra). Sub-group I-S2 proteases are described as highly alkaline subtilisins and comprises enzymes such as subtilisin PB92 (BAALKP) (MAXACAL\ Gist-Brocades NV) , subtilisin 309 (SAVINASE', NOVO NORDISK A/S), subtilisin 147 (BLS147) (ESPERASE*, NOVO NORDISK A/S), and alkaline elastase YaB (BSEYAB).<br><br>

SAVINASE® is marketed by NOVO NORDISK A/S. It is subtilisin 309 from B. Lentus and differs from BAALKP only in<br>
one position (N87S, see Fig, 1 herein) .   SAVINASE® has the amino acid sequence designated b) in Fig. 1.<br>
Parent subtilase<br>
The term 'parent subtilase" describes a subtilase defined according to Siezen et al, (1991 and 1997) . For further<br><br>
details see description of ‘‘SUBTILASES' immediately above. A parent subtilase may also be a subtilase isolated from a natural source, wherein subsequent modification have been made while retaining the characteristic of a subtilase. Alternatively the 5 term 'parent subtilase" may be termed 'wild type subtilase".<br>
Modification(s) of a subtilase variant<br>
The term * *modif ication (s) " used herein is defined to include chemical modification of a subtilase as well as genetic I manipulation of the DNA encoding a subtilase. The modification (s) can be replacement (s) of the amino acid side chain(s), substitution(s), deletion(s) and/or insertions in or at the amino acid(s) of interest.<br>
Subtilase variant<br>
In the context of this invention, the term subtilase variant or mutated subtilase means a subtilase that has been produced by an organism which is expressing a mutant gene derived from a parent microorganism which possessed an original or parent gene and which produced a corresponding parent enzyme, the parent gene having been mutated in order to produce the mutant gene from which said mutated subtilase protease is produced when expressed in a suitable host.<br>
Homologous subtilase sequences<br>
Specific active site loop regions, and amino acid insertions in said loops of SAVINASE® subtilase are identified for modification herein to obtain a subtilase variant of the invention.<br>
However, the invention is not limited to modifications of this particular subtilase, but extend to other parent (wild-type) subtilases, which have a homologous primary structure to<br><br>
that of SAVINASE®, The homology between two amino acid sequences is in this context described by the parameter 'identity".<br>
In order to determine the degree of identity between two subtilases the GAP routine of the GCG package version 9.1 can be applied (infra)   using the same settings. The output from the routine is besides the amino acid alignment the calculation of the "Percent Identity" between the two sequences.<br>
Based on this description it is routine for a person skilled in the art to identify suitable homologous subtilases and corresponding homologous active site loop regions, which can be modified according to the invention.<br>
Wash performance<br>
The ability of an enzyme to catalyze the degradation of various naturally occurring substrates present on the objects to be cleaned during e.g.   wash or hard surface cleaning is often referred to as its washing ability, wash-ability, detergency, or wash performance. Throughout this application the term wash performance will be used to encompass this property.<br>
Isolated DNA sequence<br>
The term "isolated", when applied to a DNA sequence molecule, denotes that the DNA sequence has been removed from its natural genetic milieu and is thus free of other extraneous or unwanted coding sequences, and is in a form suitable for use within genetically engineered protein production systems. Such isolated molecules are those that are separated from their natural environment and include cDNA and genomic clones. Isolated DNA molecules of the present invention are free of other genes with which they are ordinarily associated, but may include naturally occurring 5' and 3* untranslated regions such as promoters and terminators. The identification of associated<br><br>
regions will be evident to one of ordinary skill in the art (see for example, Dynan and Tijan, Nature 316:774-78, 1985). The term 'an isolated DNA sequence" may alternatively be termed 'a cloned DNA sequence".<br>
Isolated protein<br>
When applied to a protein, the term "isolated" indicates that the protein has been removed from its native environment-<br>
In a preferred form, the isolated protein is substantially free of other proteins, particularly other homologous proteins {i.e.    'homologous impurities" (see below)).<br>
An isolated protein is greater than 10 % pure, preferably greater than 20 % pure, more preferably greater than 30 % pure, as determined by SDS-PAGE, Further it is preferred to provide the protein in a highly purified form, i.e., greater than 40% pure, greater than 60% pure, greater than 80% pure, more preferably greater than 95% pure, and even more preferably greater than 99% pure, as determined by SDS-PAGE.<br>
The term "isolated protein" may alternatively be termed "purified protein" .<br>
Homologous impurities<br>
The term "homologous impurities" means any impurity (e.g. another polypeptide than the polypeptide of the invention) which originate from the homologous cell where the polypeptide of the invention is originally obtained from.<br>
Obtained from<br>
The term "obtained from" as used herein in connection with a specific microbial source, means that the polynucleotide and/or polypeptide produced by the specific source, or by a cell in which a gene from the source has been inserted.<br><br>
Substrate<br>
The term 'Substrate" used in connection with a substrate for a protease is should be interpreted in its . broadest form as comprising a compound containing at least one peptide bond susceptible to hydrolysis by a subtilisin prouease.<br>
Product<br>
The term ‘'product" used in connection with a product derived from a protease enzymatic reaction should in the context of this invention be interpreted to include the products of a hydrolysis reaction involving a subtilase protease. A product may be the substrate in a subsequent hydrolysis reaction.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OP THE INVENTION<br>
The subtilases of the invention in a first aspect relates to an isolated (i.e. greater than 10 % pure) subtilase enzyme of the I-SI and I-S2 sub-groups having at least one additional amino acid residue in position 95 of the active site loop (b)<br><br>
region from position 95 to 103, whereby said additional amino acid residue (s) correspond to the insertion of at least one amino acid residue between positions 95 and 96.<br>
In other words the subtilases of the invention are characterized by comprising an active site loop (b) region of more than 9 amino acid residue and wherein the additional amino acid residue is or can be considered as being inserted between positions 95 and 96 as compared to the parent or a known wild type subtilase.<br>
A subtilase of the first aspect of the invention may be a parent or wildtype subtilase identified and isolated from nature,<br>
Such a parent wildtype subtilase may be specifically screened for by standard techniques known in the art.<br>
One preferred way of doing this may be by specifically PCR amplify DNA regions known to encode active site loops in subtilases from numerous different microorganism, preferably different Bacillus strains.<br>
Subtilases are a group of conserved enzymes, in the sense that their DNA and amino acid sequences are homologous. Accordingly it is possible to construct relatively specific primers flanking active site loops.<br>
One way of doing this is by investigating an alignment of different subtilases (see e.g. Siezen et al, Protein Science  6 (1997) 501-523) . It is from this routine work for a person skilled in the art to construct PCR primers flanking the active site loop corresponding to the active site loop (b) between amino acid residue 95 to 103 in any of the group I-SI or I-S2 groups, such as from BLSAVI. Using such PCR primers to amplify DNA from a number of different microorganism, preferably different Bacillus strains, followed by DNA sequencing of said amplified PCR fragments, it will be possible to identify strains<br><br>
which produce subtilases of these groups comprising a longer, as compared to e.g.   BLSAVI, active site region corresponding to the active site loop region from positions 95 to 103, and where an insertion can be considered to exist between positions 95 and J 96, Having identified the strain and a partial DNA sequence of such a subtilase of interest, it is routine work for a person skilled in the art to complete cloning, expression and purification of such a subtilase of the invention.<br>
However, it is envisaged that a subtilase enzyme of the invention predominantly is a variant of a parent subtilase-<br>
Accordingly, in one embodiment the invention relates to an isolated subtilase enzyme according to the first aspect of the invention, wherein said subtilase enzyme is a constructed variant having a longer active site loop (b) than its parent enzyme by having at least one amino acid insertion between amino acid residues 95 and 96.<br>
The subtilases of the invention exhibit excellent wash performance in a detergent, and if the enzyme is a constructed variant an improved wash performance in a detergent in comparison to its closest related subtilase, such as subtilisin 309.<br>
Different subtilase products will exhibit a different wash performance in different types of detergent compositions. A subtilase of the invention has improved wash performance, as compared to its closest relative in a majority of such different types of detergent compositions.<br>
Preferably a subtilase enzyme of the invention has improved wash performance, as compared to its closest relative in the detergent composition shown in Example 3 herein {vide infra).<br>
In order to determine if a given subtilase amino acid sequence (irrelevant whether said subtilase sequence is a parent<br><br>
wildtype subtilase sequence or a subtilase variant sequence produced by any other method than by site directed mutagenesis) is within the scope of the invention, the following procedure may be used:<br>
i)   align said subtilase sequence to the amino acid sequence of subtilisin BPN' (see section 'Definitions" herein (vide supra); ii)  based on the alignment performed in step i) identify the active site loop (b), in said subtilase sequence corresponding to the active site loop (b) region of subtilisin BPN' comprising the region (both of the end amino acids included) between amino acid residue from 95 to 103; iii) determine if the active site loop (b) in said subtilase sequence, identified in step ii) is longer than the corresponding active site loop in BLSAVI and if said prolongation corresponds to the insertion of at least one amino acid residue between positions 95 and 96. If this is the case the subtilase investigated is a subtilase within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The alignment perfonned in step i) above is performed as described above by using the GAP routine.<br>
Based on this description it is routine for a person skilled in the art to identify the active site loop (b) in a subtilase and determine if the subtilase in question is within the scope of the invention. If a variant is constructed by site directed mutagenesis, it is of course known beforehand if the subtilase variant is within the scope of the invention,<br>
A subtilase variant of the invention may be constructed by standard techniques known in the art such as by site-directed/random mutagenesis or by DNA shuffling of different subtilase sequences. See section 'PRODUCING A SUBTILASE<br><br>
VARIANT" and Material and methods herein (vide infra) for further details.<br>

PRODUCING A SUBTILASE VARIANT<br>
Many methods for cloning a subtilase of the invention and for introducing insertions into genes (e.g.   subtilase genes) are well known in the art, cf. the references cited in the ‘‘BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION" section.<br>
In general standard procedures for cloning of genes and introducing insertions (random and/or site directed) into said genes may be used in order to obtain a subtilase variant of the invention. For further description of suitable techniques reference is made to Examples herein [vide infra)   and (Sambrook et al. (1989) Molecular cloning: A laboratory manual, Cold Spring Harbor lab,, Cold Spring Harbor, NY; Ausubel, F. M. et al, (eds.) "Current protocols in Molecular Biology". John Wiley and Sons, 1995; Harwood, C, R., and Cutting, S, M. (eds.) "Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus". John Wiley and Sons, 1990); and WO 96/34946.<br>
Further a subtilase variant of the invention may be constructed by standard techniques for artificial creation of diversity, such as by DNA shuffling of different subtilase genes (WO 95/22625; Stemmer WPC, Nature 370:389-91 (1994)), DNA shuffling of e.g.   the gene encoding Savinase® with one or more partial subtilase secjuences identified in nature to comprise an active site (b) loop regions longer than the active site (b) loop of Savinase®, will after subsequent screening for improved wash performance variants, provide subtilase variants according to the invention-<br><br>
EXPRESSION VECTORS<br>
A recombinant expression vector comprising a DNA construct encoding the enzyme of the invention may be any vector which may conveniently be subjected to recombinant DNA procedures ,<br>
The choice of vector will often depend on  the host cell into which it is to be introduced. Thus’ the vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e. a vector which exists as 0  an extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication, e-g• a plasmid. Alternatively, the vector may be one that on introduction into a host cell is integrated into the host cell genome in part or in its entirety and replicated together with the chromosome (s) into which it has ; been integrated.<br>
The vector is preferably an expression vector in which the DNA sequence encoding the enzyme of the invention is operably linked to additional segments required for transcription of the DNA, In general, the expression vector is derived from plasmid or viral DNA, or may contain elements of both* The term, **operably linked" indicates that the segments are arranged so that they function in concert for their intended purposes, e.g. transcription initiates in a promoter and proceeds through the DNA sequence coding for the enzyme. The promoter may be any DNA sequence which shows transcriptional activity in the host cell of choice and may be derived from genes encoding proteins either homologous or heterologous to the host cell.<br>
Examples of suitable promoters for use in bacterial host cells include the promoter of the Bacillus stearothermophilus maltogenic amylase gene, the Bacillus lichenifoirmis  alpha-amylase gene, the Bacillus amyloliguefaciens  alpha-amylase gene.<br><br>
the Bacillus  subtilis  alkaline protease gen, or the Bacillus puxnilus  xylosidase gene, or the phage Lambda P’ or P’’ promoters or the E. coli lac, trp or tac promoters-<br>
The DNA sequence encoding the enzyme of the invention may also, if necessary, be operably connected to a suitable<br>
terminator-<br>
The recombinant vector of the invention may further comprise a DNA sequence enabling the vector to replicate in the host cell in question.<br>
The vector may also comprise a selectable marker, e.g* a gene the product of which complements a defect in the host cell, or a gene encoding resistance to e.g. antibiotics like kanamycin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, tetracycline, spectinomycine, or the like, or resistance to heavy metals or herbicides.<br>
To direct an enzyme of the present invention into the secretory pathway of the host cells, a secretory signal sequence (also known as a leader sequence, prepro sequence or pre sequence) may be provided in the recombinant vector. The secretory signal sequence is joined to the DNA sequence encoding the enzyme in the correct reading frame* Secretory signal sequences are commonly positioned 5' to the DNA sequence encoding the enzyme. The secretory signal sequence may be that aormally associated with the enzyme or may be from a gene sncoding another secreted protein.<br>
The procedures used to ligate the DNA sequences coding Eor the present enzyme, the promoter and optionally the terminator and/or secretory signal sequence, respectively, or to assemble these sequences by suitable PCR amplification schemes, and to insert them into suitable vectors containing the information necessary for replication or integration, are well<br><br>
known to persons skilled in the art (cf,, for instance, Sambrook et al., op.cit,)■<br>
HOST CELL<br>
The DNA sequence encoding the present enzyme introduced intc the host cell may be either homologous or heterologous to the host in question. If homologous to the host cell, i.e. produced by the host cell in nature, it will typically be operably connected to another promoter sequence or, if applicable, another secretory signal sequence and/or terminator sequence than in its natural environment. The term "homologous" is intended to include a DNA sequence encoding an enzyme native to the host organism in question. The term "heterologous" is intended to include a DNA sequence not expressed by the host cell in nature . 5 Thus, the DNA sequence may be from another organism, or it may be a synthetic sequence.<br>
The host cell into which the DNA construct or the recombinant vector of the invention is introduced may be any cell which is capable of producing the present enzyme and includes bacteria, yeast, fungi and higher eukaryotic cells including plants.<br>
Examples of bacterial host cells which, on  cultivation, are capable of producing the enzyme of the invention are gram-positive bacteria such as strains of Bacillus,   such as strains of B. sujbtilis, B. licheniformis,   B.   lentus,   B. brevis,   B. stearothermophilus,   B. alkalophilus,   B,   amyloliquefaciens,   B. coagulans,   B. circulans,   B.   lautus,   B* megatherium or B* thuringiensis,   or strains of Streptomyces,   such as 5. lividans or S. murinus, or gram-negative bacteria such as Echerichia coli.<br>
The transformation of the bacteria may be effected by protoplast transformation, electroporation, conjugation, or by<br><br>
using competent cells in ‘ manner known per se (cf. Sambrook et al., supra).<br>
When expressing the enzyme in bacteria such as E,   coli, the enzyme may be retained in the cytoplasm, typically as  insoluble granules (known as inclusion bodies), or may be directed to the periplasmic space by a bacterial secretion sequence. In the former case, the cells are lysed and the granules are recovered and denatured after which the enzyme is refolded by diluting the denaturing agent- In the latter case, the enzyme may be recovered from the periplasmic space by disrupting the cells, e.g. by sonication or osmotic shock, to release the contents of the periplasmic space and recovering the enzyme.<br>
When expressing the enzyme in gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus or Streptomyces strains, the enzyme may be retained In the cytoplasm, or may be directed to the extracellular medium 3y a bacterial secretion sequence. In the latter case, the snzyme may be recovered from the medium as described below,<br>
ffiTHQD OF PRODUCING SUBTILASE<br>
The present invention provides a method of producing an .solated enzyme according to the invention, wherein a suitable lost cell, which has been transformed with a DNA sequence incoding the enzyme, is cultured under conditions permitting the •reduction of the enzyme, and the resulting enzyme is recovered rom the culture•<br>
When an expression vector comprising a DNA sequence ncoding the enzyme is transformed into a heterologous host cell t is possible to enable heterologous recombinant production of he enzyme of the invention.<br>
Thereby it is possible to make a highly purified subtilase composition, characterized in being free from homologous impurities.<br><br>
In this context homologous impurities means any impurities (e*g. other polypeptides than the enzyme of the invention) which originate from the homologous cell where the enzyme of the invention is originally obtained from.<br>
The medium used to culture the transformed host cells may be any conventional medium suitable for growing the host cells in question. The expressed subtilase may conveniently be secreted into the culture medium and may be recovered therefrom by well-known procedures including separating the cells from the nnedium by centrifugation or filtration, precipitating proteinaceous components of the medium by means of a salt such as ammonium sulfate, followed by chromatographic procedures such as ion exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, or the like.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
CONSTRUCTION AND EXPRESSION OF ENZYME VARIANTS:<br>
SITE-DIRECTED MUTAGENESIS:<br>
Subtilase 309 site-directed variants of the invention comprising specific insertions in the active site loop (b) between positions 95 and 96  were made by traditional cloning of DNA fragments (Sambrook et al,, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed,, Cold Spring Harbor, 1989) produced by PCR of oligos containing the desired insertions (see below).<br>
The template plasmid DNA was pJS3, or an analogue of this containing a variant of Subtilase 309.<br>
Insertions were introduced by oligo directed mutagenesis ‘o the construction of V95VX insertion variants (X = any amino acid residue inserted between positions 95 and 96)   resulting in /95VX Subtilase 3 09 variants.<br>
The Subtilase 309 variants were transformed into E,   coli, )NA purified from a over night culture of these transformants /ere transformed into S* subtiliB  by restriction endonuclease ligestion, purification of DNA fragments, ligation,<br>
ransformation of S. subtilis. Transformation of B. subtilis was lerformed as described by Dubnau et al., 1971, J. Mol, Biol, 56, •p. 209-221-<br>
OCALIZED RANDOM MUTAGENESIS IN ORDER TO INSERT RANDOM NSERTIONS IN A LOCALIZED REGION:<br>
The overall strategy used to perform localized random utagenesis was:<br>
A mutagenic primer (oligonucleotide) was synthesized Drresponding to the DNA sequence flanking the site of insertion, separated by the DNA base pairs defining the insertion.<br><br>
Subsequently, the resulting mutagenic primer was used in a PCR reaction with a suitable opposite primer. The resulting PCR fragment was purified and extended in a second PCR-reaction, before being digested by endonucleases and cloned into the E. coli   " B, subtilis  shuttle vector (see below),<br>
Alternatively, and if necessary, the resulting PCR fragment is used in a second PCR reaction as a primer with a second suitable opposite primer to allow digestion and cloning of the mutagenized region into the shuttle vector. The PCR reactions are performed under normal conditions.<br>
Following this strategy a localized random library was constructed in SAVINASE wherein insertions were introduced in the active site loop region between positions 95 and 96.<br>
The mutations were introduced by mutagenic primers (see J below) , so that all 20 amino acids are represented (N ‘  25% of A, T, C, and G; whereas S = 50% C and G, The produced PCR fragment was extended towards the N-terminal of Savinase by another round of PCR by combination of a overlapping sequence with a PCR-fragment produced by PCR-amplification with primers; 5' CTA AAT ATT CGT GGTGGC GC 3' [sense)   and 5' GAC TTT AAC AGC GTA TAG CTC AGC 3' {antisense) . The extended DNA-fragments were cloned into the Hind III- and Mlu I- sites of the modified plasmid pJS3 (see above) , and ten randomly chosen JE’, coJi colonies were sequenced to confirm the mutations designed,<br>
The mutagenic primer (5* GCT GAG CTA TAG OCT GTT AAA GTC NNS CTA GGG GCG AGC GGT TCA GGT TC 3' {sense))   was used in a PCR reaction with a suitable anti-sense opposite primer, situated downstream of the Mlu I site in pJS3 (e.g, 5'- CCC TTT AAC CGC ACA GCG TTT -3' {anti-sense) )   and the plasmid pJS3 as template. This resulting PCR product was cloned into the pJS3 shuttle vector by using the restriction enzymes Hind III and Mlu I.<br><br>
The random library was transformed into E,   coli  by well known techniques.<br>
The library prepared contained approximately 100,000 individual clones/library.<br>
Ten randomly chosen colonies were sequenced to confirm the mutations designed.<br>
In order to purify a subtilase variant of the invention, the B.   subtilis  pJS3 expression plasmid comprising a variant of the invention was transformed into a competent B. subtilis strain and was fermented as described above in a medium containing 10 jug/ml Chloramphenicol (CAM) ,<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
PURIFICATION OF ENZYME VARIANTS:<br>
This procedure relates to purification of a 2 liter scale fermentation for the production of the subtilases of the invention in a Bacillus  host cell.<br>
Approximately 1.6 liters of fermentation broth were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 35 minutes in 1 liter beakers. The supernatants were adjusted to pH 6,5 using 10% acetic acid and filtered on Seitz Supra SlOO filter plates.<br>
The filtrates were concentrated to approximately 400 ml using an Amicon CH2A UF unit equipped with an Amicon SlYlO UF cartridge* The UF concentrate was centrifuged and filtered prior to absorption at room temperature on a Bacitracin affinity column at pH 7. The protease was eluted from the Bacitracin column at room temperature using 25% 2-propanol and 1 M sodium chloride in a buffer solution with 0.01 dimethylglutaric acid, 0.1 M boric acid and 0.002 M calcium chloride adjusted to pH 7.<br>
The fractions with protease activity from the Bacitracin purification step were combined and applied to a 750 ml Sephadex G25 column (5 cm dia.) equilibrated with a buffer containing<br><br>
0-01 dimethylglutaric acid, 0.2 M boric acid and 0.002 m calcium chloride adjusted to pH 6.5.<br>
Fractions with proteolytic activity from the Sephadex G25 column were combined and applied to a 150 ml CM Sepharose CL 6B cation exchange column (5 cm diaj equilibrated with a buffer containing 0.01 M dimethylglutaric acid, 0.2 M boric acid, and 0.002 M calcium chloride adjusted to pH 6.5.<br>
The protease was eluted using a linear gradient of 0-0,1 M sodium chloride in 2 litres of the same buffer (0-0.2 M sodium chloride in case of Subtilisin 147) .<br>
In a final purification step protease containing fractions from Che CM Sepharose column were combined and concentrated in an Amicon ultrafiltration cell equipped with a 3R81PP membrane (from the Danish Sugar Factories Inc.).<br>
By using the techniques of Example 1 for the construction and fermentation, and the above isolation procedure the following subtilisin 309 variants were produced and isolated:<br>
V95VT<br>
V95VS<br>
V95VD<br>
V95VE<br>
V95VP<br>
V95VG<br>
:V95VH<br>
V95Vi<br>
V95Vf+Y167A<br>
These variants were found to exhibit better wash performance than Savinase in a preliminary assay.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
WASH PERFORMANCE OF DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING ENZYME VARIANTS<br><br>
The following examples provide results from a number of washing tests that were conducted under the conditions indicated<br><br>
DETERGENTS:<br>
The detergents used were obtained from supermarkets in Denmark (OMO, datasheet ED-9745105) and the USA (Wisk, datasheet ED-9711893) , respectively. Prior to use all enzymatic activity in the detergents was inactivated by micro wave treatment .<br>
SWATCHES;<br>
The swatches used were EMPA116 and EMPA117, obtained from EMPA Testmaterialen, Movenstrasse 12, CH-9015 St. Gall, Switzerland.<br>
REFLECTANCE<br><br>
Measurement of reflectance (R) on the test material was done at 460 nm using a Macbeth ColorEye 7000 photometer. The measurements were done according to the manufacturers protocol.<br>
. EVALUATION<br>
The evaluation of the wash performance of a subtilase is determined by either the improvement factor or the performance factor for the subtilase iinvestigated*<br>
The improvement factor, l’Dose/response' ‘‘ defined as<br>
the ratio between the slopes of the wash performance curves for a detergent containing the subtilase investigated and the same detergent containing a reference subtilase at the asymptotic concentration of the subtilase goes to zero<br>
‘‘Dose/response= ‘/’ref<br><br>
R is the wash performance in reflectance units; Rg is the intercept of the fitted curve with y-axis (blind) ; a is the<br>
slope of the fitted curve as c —&gt; 0; c is the enzyme<br>
concentration; and ARj’ia’’ is the theoretical maximal wash effect<br>
as c —&gt; 00.<br><br><br>
‘variant i’ ‘‘e reflectance of test material washed with lOnM variant; Ravines   reflectance of test material washed with lOnM Savinase; Blank   reflectance of test material washed with no enzyme<br><br>
The subtilases of the inventions are thus seen to exhibit improved wash performance in comparison to Savinase*.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
