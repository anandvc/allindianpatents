COMPOSITIONS HAVING ENHANCED DEPOSITION OF A TOPICALLY ACTIVE COMPOUND ON A SURFACE<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Serial No. 09/578,020, filed May 24, 2000, allowed, which is a continuation of U.S. application Serial No. 09/338,654, filed June 23, 1999, now U.S. Patent Wo. 6,107,261.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to compositions, particularly personal care compositions,-having an improved ability to deposit topically active compounds on a surface, such as skin or hair. More particularly, the present invention is directed to compositions comprising a topically active compound, a'primary surfactant, a hydrotrope, a hydric solvent, an optional cosurfactant, and other optional ingredients.  The topically active compounds include antibacterial agents, sunscreens, vitamins, medicaments, fragrance materials, .antioxidants, conditioners, emollients, and the like.  The topically active compounds typically are insoluble in water, and the compositions deposit the topically active compounds to surfaces more effectively than present-day commercial compositions.<br><br>
BACKGROUND   OF   THE   INVENTION<br>
For many personal  care products,   it   is desirable not  only  to  provide  consumers  the basic function of cleansing  the skin or hair,   but  also to deposit   a  topically  active   compound that  provides   a predetermined benefit.     The paradoxical  problem of cleaning   skin,   or  other   surfaces,   such  as  hair, cloth,   or hard surfaces,   while  simultaneously  depositing a topically  active  compound has  been  investigated for decades.      Recent  publications   show that   simultaneous  cleaning  and  deposition  of  topically  active  ingredients   is  still  a  challenge,   for example,   see U.S.   Patent  Nos.   5,885,948;   6,080,707; and   6,080,708.<br>
The  need  for   cleansing  compositions   that efficiently deposit   topically  active  compounds   is magnified when  the  typically high  cost   of   the  topically active  compounds   is  considered,   because  a substantial portion  of   these  expensive  compounds   is wasted   in present-day   compositions.     In  addition, particular  topically  active  compounds,   like  antimicrobial   agents,   can  provide  both  quick-acting   and residual  benefits.     The   value  of  a  quick-acting antimicrobial  agent   is   evident,   and  the  residual benefit   of  antimicrobial   agents   is  discussed  in WO   98/55095  and U.S.   Patent  No.   6,113,933,    incorporated  herein by reference.<br>
Topically  active  compounds  encompass   a wide   range  of  materials,   including antibacterial agents,    sunscreens,   vitamins,   medicaments,    fragrance materials,   antioxidants,   conditioners,   emollients,<br><br>
and  other  hair-care  and  skin-care  ingredients.      Many of  these   compounds   are   relatively water  insoluble. Present-day  compositions  typically rely upon  solubilization  of  active   compounds   in  a  surfactant system.     Other systems   rely upon a dispersion  of emulsified active oil  droplets.<br>
A surfactant   solubilized active compound is   not   effectively  deposited unless  the  active   compound  is  present  at  a   very  high  level   o'f  saturation in  the   composition,   or  the  active  compound  is   chemically  and/or physically modified to  enhance  deposition.     However,   there   is  a  practical  limit  to  incorporating  a   high level   of  saturation  of  active   compound with  traditional   surfactant  systems  because  of cost   and/or  regulatory  constraints;     For  example,   a composition  containing   15%   ammonium  lauryl   sulfate can   require  about  3%  triclosan  to  form a  saturated system.     Because  of   the  high  cost  of  triclosan,   such a  composition  would be  too  expensive  to  commercialize.      Physical/chemical  modifications  of  the  active compounds,   while possibly  enhancing  deposition,   may not  be   desirable because  of  additional  cost  to  an already  expensive  ingredient  and/or  the  need  for regulatory   reapproval   and additional  testing  required   for  the modified  active  compound.<br>
The dispersion-type of emulsion composition typically operates by dilution deposition, and has the potential to deposit active compounds relatively well. However, this type of composition has limitations. For example, typical compositions are thickened   dispersions,   and  cannot  be  used  in  certain<br><br>
dispensers   (e.g.,   a  self-foaming pump).     In  addition,   some active compounds may not be biologically available  on  the   skin,   hair,   or  other  surface  when in the form of relatively  large  hydrophobic droplets or  dissolved  in a  carrier  oil.<br>
Other strategies  to  enhance  deposition include  the  addition  of  certain  materials  that  enhance   substantivity  of   active  compounds  by   "codepo-sition," 'i.e.,   a   "deposition aid"  which adheres to the   skin  or  hair  and  purportedly  enhances  deposition of  an  active  ingredient.     This  strategy  also  has  a limitation  of  decreased  bioavailability when  the active  compound/deposition  aid  complex  contacts  the skin  or  hair,   because   the  active  compound may be less  prone  to  diffuse   to  the  site  of  action  and/or may  not  be  uniformly  dispersed over  the  treated surface.<br>
While not  being bound  by  theory,   it   is envisioned  that a  present  composition  combines  two principles  to  enhance   deposition  of  active  compounds.     The  first  principle  is  the  use  of  high thermodynamic  activity   (i.e.,   high  percent   saturation)   to  enhance  the  tendency  of  the  active   compound to   deposit   on  surfaces.     Allawalla   et  al.,   J-   Amer. Pharmaceut.,  Assn.,   XLII,   pp.   267-274   (1953)   disclose  the   importance  of  this  factor  of  the  activity of   antimicrobial  agents.     In  fact,   as  illustrated herein,   thermodynamic  activity  is  an  important factor   in  enhancing   deposition  of  other  active  compounds   as  well.<br><br>
The  second principle that  contributes  to-enhanced deposition   is   the  surprising  and  unique property of  a  present  composition to  release   the active  compound upon  dilution-     While  the   novel   compositions containing  an  active  compound,   an  anionic surfactant,   a  hydrotrope,   a hydric  solvent,   an  optional  cosurfactant,   and  other  optional   ingredients form  clear,   mobile,   phase-stable  compositions,   the compositions  become  unstable  upon dilution  with water and deposit   the  active  compound to -a  surface in  a   highly effective  manner.     This  type  of  behavior is   in  sharp contrast  to  typical  solubilized  active systems  that   generally   remain  stable upon  dilution. The mechanism of deposition  also  is  different   from the  dilution  deposition   of  compositions  disclosed  in prior  art because  the  present  compositions  do  not contain  dispersed  oil   droplets  typical   in  existing emulsion   systems.<br>
Persons   skilled  in  the  art  have   evaluated numerous,   diverse  strategies  to  enhance  the  deposition  of  topically  active   compounds  on  the   skin  and hair.     A review  of  these   diverse  strategies   to  solve the  problem of  cleaning   a   surface  and depositing  a topically  active compound  on  the  surface   is   summarized below.     It  can be   seen  that  the  present   compositions  are novel  and nonobvious  even  over  the  art.<br>
Compositions   encompassed by the  present invention  include,   but   are  not  limited to,   skin care,   hair  care,   hard  surface  cleaning,   and  similar compositions  used to  cleanse  and/or  treat   a   surface. The  present  disclosure   is   directed primarily  to<br><br>
antibacterial compositions, but also applies to other compositions containing a topically active compound.<br>
With respect to antibacterial personal care compositions, such compositions are known in the art.  Especially useful are antibacterial cleansing compositions, which typically are used to cleanse the skin and to destroy bacteria and other microorganisms present on the skin, especially the hands, arms, and face of the user.<br>
Antibacterial compositions in general are used, for example, in the health care industry, food service industry, meat processing industry, and in the private sector by individual consumers -  The widespread use of antibacterial compositions indicates the importance consumers place on controlling bacteria and other microorganism populations on skin.  It is important, however, that antibacterial compositions provide a substantial and broad spectrum reduction in microorganism populations quickly and without problems associated with toxicity and skin irritation.<br>
In particular, antibacterial cleansing compositions typically contain an active antibacterial agent, a surfactant, and various other ingredients, for example, dyes, fragrances, pH adjusters, thickeners, skin conditioners, and the like, in an aqueous carrier.  Several different classes of antibacterial agents have been used in antibacterial cleansing compositions.  Examples of antibacterial agents include a bisguanidine (e.g.,<br><br>
chlorhexidine digluconate), diphenyl compounds, benzyl alcohols, trihalocarbanilides, quaternary ammonium compounds, ethoxylated phenols, and phenolic compounds, such as halo-substituted phenolic compounds, like PCMX (i.e., p-chloro-m-xylenol) and triclosan (i.e., 2,4,4'-trichloro-2'hydroxy-diphen-ylether) .  Present-day antimicrobial compositions based on such antibacterial agents exhibit a wide range of antibacterial activity, ranging from low to high, depending on the microorganism to be controlled and the particular antibacterial composition.<br>
Most commercial antibacterial compositions, however, generally offer a low to moderate antibacterial activity.  Antibacterial activity is assessed against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, including both Gram positive and Gram negative microorganisms.  The log reduction, or alternatively the percent reduction, in bacterial populations provided by the antibacterial composition correlates to antibacterial activity.  A log reduction of 3-5 is most preferred, a 1-3 reduction is preferred, whereas a log reduction of less than 1 is least preferred, for a particular contact time, generally ranging from 15 seconds to 5 minutes.  Thus, a highly preferred antibacterial composition exhibits a 3-5 log reduction against a broad spectrum of microorganisms in a short contact time.  Prior disclosures illustrate attempts to provide such antibacterial compositions, which, to date, do not pro-<br><br>
vide the rapid, broad range control of microorganisms desired by consumers. .<br>
It should be noted that high log reductions have been achieved at pH values of 4 and 9, but such log reductions are attributed at least in part to these relatively extreme pH values.  Compositions having such pH values can irritate the skin and other surfaces, and, therefore, typically are avoided.  It has been difficult to impossible to achieve a high log reduction using an antibacterial composition having, a neutral pH of about 5 to about 8, and especially about 6 to about 8.<br>
For example, WO98/01110 discloses compositions comprising triclosan, surfactants, solvents, chelating agents, thickeners, buffering agents, and water.  WO98/01110 is directed to reducing skin irritation by employing a reduced amount of surfactant .<br>
Fendler et al. U.S. 5,635,462 discloses compositions comprising PCMX and selected surfactants.  The compositions disclosed therein are devoid of anionic surfactants and nonionic surfactants .<br>
W097/46218 and WO96/06152 disclose compositions based on triclosan, organic acids or salts, hydrotropes, and hydric solvents.<br>
EP 0 505 935 discloses compositions containing PCMX in combination with nonionic and anionic surfactants, particularly nonionic block copolymer surfactants.<br><br>
WO95/32705 discloses a mild surfactant combination that can be combined with antibacterial compounds, like triclosan.<br>
WO95/09605 discloses antibacterial compositions containing anionic surfactants and alkyl-polyglycoside surfactants.<br>
WO98/55096 discloses antimicrobial wipes having a porous sheet impregnated with an antibacterial composition containing an active antimicrobial agent, an anionic surfactant, an acid, and water, wherein the composition has a pH of about 3.0 to about 6.0.<br>
N.A. Allawala et al., J.   Amer.   Pharm. Assoc.—Sci.   Ed.,   Vol.   XLII,   no. 5, pp. 267-275 (1953) discusses the antibacterial activity of active antibacterial agents in combination with surfactants.<br>
f	A.G. Mitchell, J.   Pharm.   Pharmacol., Vol.<br>
16,   pp. 533-537 (1964) discloses compositions containing PCMX and a nonionic surfactant that exhibit antibacterial activity.  The compositions disclosed in the Mitchell publication exhibit antibacterial activity in at least 47 minutes contact time, thus the compositions are not highly effective.<br>
Prior disclosures have not addressed the issue of which composition ingredient in an antibacterial composition provides bacterial control. Prior compositions also have not provided an effective, fast, and broad spectrum control of bacteria at a neutral pH of about 5 to about 8, and especially at about 6 to about 8.<br><br>
An  efficacious   antibacterial  composition has  been difficult  to  achieve because  of the  properties  of the  antibacterial  agents and the effects of   a   surfactant   on  an  antibacterial   agent.     For example,   several active   antibacterial  agents,   like phenols,   have  an exceedingly  low  solubility  in water,   e.g.,   triclosan   solubility  in  water  is  about 5  to   10  ppm   (parts  per  million).     The  solubility  of the  antibacterial  agent   is   increased by  adding  surfactants  to the  composition.     However,   an  increase in  solubility  of the  antimicrobial  agent,   and  in turn,   the  amount  of  antibacterial  agent   in the composition,   does not  necessarily  lead  to  an  increased  antibacterial  efficacy.<br>
Without being  bound  to  any particular theory,   it   is  theorized'that  the  addition  of  a surfactant   increases   antimicrobial   agent  solubility, but  also  typically  reduces   the  availability  of   the antibacterial  agent  because  a  surfactant  in  water forms  micelles  above  the   critical  micelle  concentration   of  the   surfactant.      The  critical  micelle  concentration  varies  from  surfactant  to  surfactant. The  formation  of micelles   is  important  because micelles  have  a   lipophilic  region   that  attracts   and solubilizes  the  antibacterial  agent,   and thereby renders   the  antibacterial   agent  unavailable  to immediately  contact  bacteria,   and  thereby  control bacteria   in  short time  period   (i.e.,   one minute  or less) .<br>
The  antibacterial   agent   soiubilized  in   the surfactant  micelles  will   control  bacteria,   but   in<br><br>
relatively long time frames.  The antibacterial agent, if free in the aqueous solution and not tied up in the surfactant micelle (i.e., is activated), is attracted to the lipophilic membrane of the bacteria and performs its function quickly.  If the antibacterial agent is tied up in the surfactant micelle (i.e., is not activated), the antibacterial agent is only slowly available and cannot perform its function in a time frame that is practical for cleaning the skin.<br>
In addition, an antibacterial agent solubilized in the micelle is readily washed from the skin during the rinsing process, and is not available to deposit on the skin to provide a residual antibacterial benefit.  Rather, the antibacterial agent is washed away and wasted.  The present invention is directed to enhancing the deposition of topically active compounds, like antibacterial agents.<br>
As previously discussed, prior investigators have employed various strategies to improve deposition of a topically active compound on a surface.  One strategy is to chemically modify the topically active compound, which is not a practical solution to compound deposition.  Other investigators considered the nature of surface being treated.  However, a commercially practicable composition should be useful on a variety of surfaces.<br>
Other investigators utilized water-soluble cationic polymers as deposition aids for the topically active compound.  See U.S. Patent Nos.<br><br>
3,489,686; 3,580,853; and 3,723,325, disclosing the use of polyethylenimine and the reaction product of polyethyleneimine and either ethylene oxide or propylene oxide, quaternary ammonium-substituted cellulose derivatives, and a polymer formed on tetraethylenepentamine and epichlorohydrin.  Other patents and applications directed to the use of a deposition aid for a topically active compound include W099/66886; U.S. Patent Nos. 3,726,815; 3,875,071; 4,894,220; 6,057,275; and 6,126,954; W099/63965; WOOO/33807; W099/63953.<br>
Still other investigators directed attention to dilution deposition of a topically active compound.  This is considered to be a primary deposition mechanism for many commercially available "two-in-one" conditioning shampoos.  Dilution deposition involves the use of a topically active compound in a composition that is phase stable during storage and application to the hair, but becomes phase unstable and separates during rinsing.  The additional water added to the composition during rinsing causes phase separation and deposition of the oil phase (which contains the topically active compound) onto the hair.  Examples of patents relating to dilution deposition include EP 0 552 024; WO99/32079; WC99/53889; U.S. Patent Nos. 5,981,465; 6,051,546; and 5,928,632; WO01/01949; W099/26585; W099/13854; W099/62477; WO00/43984; and WOOO/25739.<br>
Other strategies used to enhance deposition of topically active compounds include varying the amount and type of surfactant in the composi-<br><br>
tion, entrapping the topically active compound in a polymer matrix, utilizing separate cleansing and treatment compositions, using a wipe cloth to apply the topically active compound, and utilizing electrostatic sprays or liquid crystals.  These strategies are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,409,695 and 5,814,323; WO00/64406; EP 0 573 229; WOOO/00170; WO99/55303; W099/13861; W099/21532; W099/12519; WO01/12138; and WO01/13871.<br>
Accordingly, a need exists for a topically active composition that is highly efficacious in a short time period, and effectively deposits a topically active compound on a surface to provide residual benefits.  The present invention is directed to such compositions, including antibacterial compositions and skin- and hair-care compositions.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to topically active compositions that provide (a) a rapid and substantial benefit attributed to a topically active compound, and (b) an  efficacious deposition of the topically active compound on a surface to provide a residual benefit.  In particular, the present invention relates to topically active compositions containing a topically active compound, wherein (a) the topically active compound is present in the continuous aqueous phase (in contrast to being present in micelles), in an amount of at least 25% of saturation, when measured at room temperature, (b) provides a substantial beneficial result, e.g., a<br><br>
substantial reduction in Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, within one minute, and (c) effectively deposits the topically active compound on the treated surface to provide a residual benefit.<br>
Therefore, one aspect of the present invention is to provide a topically active composition having an enhanced deposition of a topically active compound to a surface during a cleansing and/or rinsing step.  More particularly, the present invention is directed to topically active compositions comprising a topically active compound, a primary surfactant, a hydrotrope, a hydric solvent, an optional cosurfactant, other optional ingredients, and water.<br>
Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention is to provide a liquid topically active composition comprising:<br>
(a)	about 0.001% to about 5%, by weight, of a topically active compound;<br>
(b)	about 0.1% to about 15%, by weight, of an anionic surfactant;<br>
(c)	about 0.5% to about 35%, by weight, of a hydrotrope;<br>
(d)	about 0.5% to about 25%, by weight, of a water-soluble hydric solvent;<br>
(e)	0% to about 5%-, by weight, of a co-surfactant selected from the group consisting of a nonionic surfactant, an ampholytic surfactant, and mixtures thereof; and<br>
(f)	water.<br><br>
The topically active compound is a water-insoluble compound that provides a benefit to a surface contacted by the composition.  The topically active compound can be, for example, an antibacterial agent, an antidandruff agent, a sunscreen, a medicament, a skin or hair conditioner, a vitamin, an emollient, an antioxidant, a fragrance, and other skin and hair care compounds.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a topically active composition comprising about 0.001% to about 5% of a water-insoluble topically active compound, about 5% to about 15% di-propylene glycol, about 10% to about 20% sodium xylene sulfonate, about 0.5% to about 5% ammonium lauryl sulfate, and 0% to about 5% cocamidopropyl-betaine.<br>
Yet another aspect of the present invention is to provide consumer products based on a , topically active composition of the present invention, for example, a skin cleanser, a conditioning shampoo, an antidandruff shampoo, a body splash, a topical medicament, a surgical scrub, a wound care agent, a hand sanitizer gel, a disinfectant, a mouth wash, a pet shampoo, a hard surface sanitizer, and other skin and hair-care compositions.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention is to provide a method of rapidly reducing the Gram positive and/or Gram negative bacteria populations on animal tissue, including human tissue, by contacting the tissue, like the dermis, with an antibacterial composition of the present invention for a<br><br>
sufficient time, such as about 15 seconds to 5 minutes, to reduce the bacteria level to a desired level, and depositing a substantial amount of the antibacterial agent on the tissue to provide a residual bacterial action.<br>
The above and other novel aspects and advantages of the present invention are illustrated in the following, nonlimiting detailed description of the preferred embodiments.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Personal care products incorporating a topically active compound have been used for many years.  Since the introduction of such personal care products, many claims have been made that these products provide a benefit attributed to a topically active compound, like an antibacterial agent, present in the composition.  With respect to antibacterial compositions, to be most effective, an antibacterial composition should provide a high log reduction against a broad spectrum of organisms in as short a contact time as possible, and also deposit on the skin to provide a residual antibacterial activity.  This dual function of rapid and residual activity for antibacterial agents, and other topically active compounds, is difficult to achieve in a water-based composition that is- applied to the skin, then rinsed off the skin in a  relatively short time.<br>
As presently formulated, commercial liquid antibacterial soap compositions provide a poor to<br><br>
marginal  time  kill  efficacy,   i.e.,   rate  of   killing bacteria.     Table  1   summarizes  the   kill  efficacy  of commercial  products,   each   of which', contains  about 0.2%   to  0.3%,   by weight,   triclosan   (an antibacterial agent).<br><br>
Present-day  products   especially   lack efficacy  against  Gram  negative  bacteria,   such  as   E. coll,   which  are  of  particular  concern  to  human health.      In  one  aspect,   the  present  invention, therefore,   is  directed  to   antibacterial  compositions having  an  exceptionally  high  broad  spectrum  antibacterial   efficacy,   as  measured  by  a   rapid  kill  of  bacteria   (i.e.,   time  kill),   which  is  to be  distinguished   from  persistent,   or  residual,   kill.<br>
In  addition,   as  presently formulated, commercial   cleansing  compositions  provide  a  poor   to marginal   deposition  of   topically active  compounds. Typically,    98%  or more   of   the   applied  topically active   compound  is  wasted  during  application. Accordingly,   there  is   a   need  to  improve  the  deposition   of   such   expensive   active  compounds   in  these<br><br>
compositions.  Therefore, the present invention also is directed to providing a residual benefit attributed to the topically active compound, while incorporating a relatively low amount of the active comound in the composition.<br>
The present antibacterial compositions provide significantly improved time kill.efficacy compared to prior compositions.  The basis of this improved time kill is the discovery that the antimicrobial efficacy of an active agent can be correlated to the rate at which the agent has access to an active site on the microbe.  The driving force that determines the rate of agent transport to the site of action is the difference in chemical potential between the site at which the agent acts and the external aqueous phase.  Alternatively stated, the microbicidal activity of an active agent is proportional to its thermodynamic activity in the external phase.  Accordingly, thermodynamic activity, as opposed to concentration, is the more important variable with respect to antimicrobial efficacy.  As discussed more fully hereafter, thermodynamic activity is conveniently correlated to the percent saturation of the active antibacterial agent in the continuous aqueous phase of the composition.<br>
Many compounds have a solubility limit in aqueous solutions termed the "saturation concentration, " which varies with temperature.  Above the saturation concentration, the compound precipitates from solution.'  Percent saturation is the measured<br><br>
concentration in solution divided by the saturation concentration.  The concentration of a compound in aqueous solution can be increased.over the saturation concentration in water by the addition of compounds like surfactants.  Surfactants not only increase the solubility of compounds in the continuous aqueous phase of the composition, but also form micelles, and can solubilize compounds in the micelles.<br>
The % saturation of an active antibacterial agent in any composition, including a surfactant-containing composition, ideally' can be expressed as:1<br>
% saturation = [C/Cs]xl00%<br>
wherein C is the concentration of antibacterial agent in the composition and Cs is the saturation concentration of the antibacterial agent in the composition at room temperature.  While not wishing to be bound,by any theory, it is contemplated that the continuous aqueous phase of a surfactant-containing composition is in equilibrium with the micellar pseudophase of said composition, and further that any dissolved species, such as an antibacterial active•agent, is distributed between the aqueous continuous phase and the micellar pseudophase according to a partition law.  Accordingly, the percent saturation, or alternatively the relative thermodynamic activity or relative chemical potential, of an antibacterial active agent dissolved in a surfactant-containing composition is the<br><br>
same everywhere within the composition.  Thus, the terms percent saturation of, the antibacterial agent "in a composition," "in the aqueous continuous phase of a composition," and "in the micellar pseudophase of a composition" are interchangeable, and are used as such throughout this disclosure.<br>
Maximum antibacterial efficacy is achieved when the difference in thermodynamic activities of the active antibacterial agent between the composition and the target organism is maximized (i.e., when the composition is more "saturated" with the active ingredient) .  A second factor affecting anti-bacterial activity is the total amount of available antibacterial agent present in the composition, which can be thought of as the "critical dose."  It has been found that the total amount of active agent in the continuous aqueous phase of a composition greatly influences the time in which a desired level of antibacterial efficacy is achieved, given equal thermodynamic activities.  Thus, the two key factors affecting the antibacterial efficacy of an active agent in a composition are:  (1) its availability, as dictated by its thermodynamic activity, i.e., percent saturation in the continuous aqueous phase of a composition, and (2) the total amount of available active agent in the solution.<br>
An important ingredient in antibacterial cleansing compositions is a surfactant, which acts £s a solubilizer, cleanser, and foaming agent.  Surfactants affect the percent saturation -of an antibacterial agent in solution, or more importantly,<br><br>
affect the percent saturation of the active agent in the continuous aqueous phase of the composition. This effect can  be explained in the case of a sparingly water-soluble antibacterial agent in an aqueous surfactant solution, where the active agent is distributed between the aqueous {i.e., continuous) phase and the micellar pseudophase-  For antibacterial agents of exceedingly low solubility in water, such as triclosan, the distribution is shifted strongly toward the micelles (i.e., a vast majority of the triclosan molecules are present in surfactant micelles, as opposed to the aqueous phase).<br>
The ratio of surfactant to antibacterial agent directly determines the amount of active agent present in the surfactant micelles, which in turn affects the percent saturation of the active agent in the continuous aqueous phase.  It has been found that as the surfactant:active agent ratio increases, the number of micelles relative to active molecules also increases, with the micelles being proportionately less saturated with active agent as the ratio increases.  Since the active agent in the continuous phase is in equilibrium with active agent in the micellar pseudophase, as the saturation of antibacterial agent in the micellar phase decreases, so does the saturation of the antibacterial agent in the continuous phase.  The converse also is true. Active agent solubilized in the micellar pseudophase is not immediately available to contact the microorganisms, and it is the percent saturation of<br><br>
active agent in the continuous aqueous phase that determines the antibacterial activity of the composition.  The active agent present in the surfactant micelles, however, can serve as a reservoir of active agent to replenish the continuous aqueous phase as the active agent is depleted.<br>
To summarize, the thermodynamic activity, or percent saturation, of an antibacterial agent in the continuous aqueous phase of a composition drives antibacterial activity.  Further, the total amount of available active agent determines the ultimate extent of efficacy.  In compositions wherein the active agent is solubilized by a surfactant, the active agent present in surfactant micelles is not directly available for antibacterial activity.  For such compositions, the percent saturation of the active agent in the composition, or alternatively the percent saturation of the active agent in the continuous aqueous phase of the composition, determines antibacterial efficacy.<br>
The present compositions are topically active compositions having an improved effectiveness with respect to imparting a rapid benefit and a residual benefit.  As illustrated in the following embodiments, a topically active composition of the present invention comprises:  (a) about 0.001% to about 5%, by weight, of a topically active compound; (b) about 0.1% to about 15%; by weight, of an anionic surfactant; (c) about 0.5% to about 35%, by weight, of a hydrotrope; (d)  about 0.5% to about 2 5%, by weight, of a water-soluble hydric solvent;<br><br>
(e) 0% to about 5%, by weight, of a cosurfactant selected from the group consisting of a nonionic surfactant, an ampholytic surfactant, and mixtures thereof; and (f) water.  The compositions have a percent saturation of topically active compound in the continuous aqueous phase of at least about 25%, when measured at room temperature.  Antibacterial compositions of the present invention exhibit a log reduction against Gram positive bacteria of at least about 2 after 30 seconds contact.  The compositions exhibit a log reduction against Gram negative bacteria of at least about 2.5 after 30 seconds contact.<br>
In addition to providing a rapid and efficient benefit, a residual topical efficacy also is desired.  To achieve a residual activity, the topically active compound must be deposited on the skin in the short time span between application of the composition to the skin and rinsing from the skin. It also is important that a variety of topically active compounds, such as medicaments, antibacterial agents, conditioners, fragrances, and the like, are effectively deposited on the skin prior to rinsing of the composition from the skin.<br>
The present invention, therefore, is directed to topically active compositions that effectively and rapidly deposit the topically active compound on a cleansed surface.  The following Table summarizes results of deposition tests comparing commercial products to examples of the present compositions.  The compositions contain triclosan (TCS)<br><br>
as the water-insoluble topically active compound. As seen from these test results, the present compositions have superior efficacy over commercial products in the deposition of the topically active compound.<br><br>
1J     As  determined by  a  pigskin  deposition  test   described below.<br>
The following illustrates important, nonlimiting embodiments of the present invention. In particular, compositions of the present invention comprise a topically active compound, a primary surfactant, a hydrotrope, a hydric solvent, an optional cosurfactant, and water.  The compositions can further include additional optional ingredients disclosed hereafter, like pH adjusters, dyes, and preservatives.<br>
The following is a nonlimiting description of ingredients that can be included in a present composition.<br>
1 .   Topically Active Compound<br>
A topically active compound is present in a composition of the present invention in an amount<br><br>
of about 0.001% to about 5%, and preferably about 0.01% to about 3%, by weight of the composition.  To achieve the full advantage of the present invention, the topically active compound is present in an amount of about 0.05% to about 2%, by weight, of the composition.<br>
The topically active compositions can be ready to use compositions, which typically contain 0.001% to about 2%, preferably 0.01% to about 1.5%, and most preferably about 0.05% to about 1%, of a topically active compound, by weight of the composition.  The topically active compositions also can be formulated as concentrates that are diluted before use with one to about 100 parts water to provide an end use composition.  The concentrated compositions typically contain greater than about 0.1% and up to about 5%, by weight, of the topically active compound.  Applications also are envisioned wherein the end use composition contains greater than 2%, by weight, of the topically active compound.<br>
As discussed above, the absolute amount of topically active compound present in the composition is not as important as the amount of available topically active compound in the composition, and the ability of,the composition to rapidly and effectively deposit the topically active compound on a treated surface.  The amount of available topically active compound in the composition, and the ability of the composition to deposit the topically active compound, is related to the identity of the surfactant in the composition, the amount of surfactant in<br><br>
the composition, and the presence of optional ingredients in the composition.<br>
For antibacterial agents, to achieve the desired bacteria kill in a short contact time, like 15 to 60 seconds, the continuous aqueous phase of the composition contains an amount of antibacterial agent that is at least about 50%, and preferably at least about 75%, of the saturation concentration of the antibacterial agent in water, when measured at room temperature.  To achieve the full advantage of the present invention, the continuous aqueous phase is about 95% to 100% saturated with the antibacterial agent.  The amount of antibacterial agent present in the continuous aqueous phase-can be defined as the total amount of antibacterial agent in the composition, less any antibacterial agent present in surfactant micelles.- The method of determining percent saturation of antibacterial agent in the composition is disclosed hereafter.<br>
To achieve the desired residual activity, the topically active compound is rapidly and effectively deposited on the surface contacted by a composition of the present invention.<br>

Examples of classes of nonionic surfactants include ethoxylated alkylphenols, ethoxylated and propoxylated fatty alcohols, polyethylene glycol ethers of methyl glucose, polyethylene glycol ethers of sorbitol, ethylene oxidepropyl-<br><br>
ene oxide block copolymers, ethoxylated esters of fatty (C8-C18) acids, condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain amines or amides, and mixtures thereof.<br>

In addition to an  optional nonionic co-surfactant, ampholytic and amphoteric surfactants can be used in the topically active compositions as the optional cosurfactant.<br>
Ampholytic surfactants can be broadly described as derivatives of secondary and tertiary amines having aliphatic radicals that are straight chain or branched, and wherein one of the aliphatic substituents contains from about 8 to 18 carbon atoms and at least one of the aliphatic substituents contains an anionic water-solubilizing group, e.g., carboxy, sulfonate, or sulfate.  Examples of compounds falling within this description are sodium 3-(dodecylamino)propionate, sodium 3- (dodecylamino)-propane-1-sulfonate, sodium 2- (dodecylamino)ethyl sulfate, sodium 2- (dimethylamino) octadecanoate, disodium 3-(N-carboxymethyldodecylamino)propane-1-sulfonate, disodium octadecyliminodiacetate, sodium l-carboxymethyl-2-undecylimidazole, and sodium N,N-bis (2-hydroxyethyl) -2-sulfato-3-dodecoxypropylamine.<br>
More particularly, -one class of ampholytic surfactants include sarccsinates and taurates having the general structural formula<br>
0 R1-C-N-(CH2)n-Y<br><br>
wherein R1 is C11 through C21 alkyl, R2 is hydrogen or<br>
C1-C2 alkyl, Y is C02M or ' S03M, M is an alkali metal, and n is a number 1 through 3.<br>
Another class of airtpholytic surfactants is the amide sulfosucci'nates having the structural formula<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Additional classes of ampholytic surfactants include the phosphobetaines and the phosphitaines.<br>

In addition, the topically active compositions of the present invention do not rely upon a low pH or a high pH to provide a rapid reduction in bacterial populations.  The topically active compositions of the present invention can have a pH of about 4   to about 9, but at the two extremes of this pH range, the compositions can be irritating to the skin or damaging to ether surfaces contacted by the composition.  Accordingly, topically active compositions of the present invention preferably have a pH of about 5 to about 8, and more preferably about 6 to about 8.  To achieve the full advantage of the present invention, the topically active compositions have a pH of about 6.5 to about 7.5.<br>
To demonstrate the new and unexpected results-provided by the topically active compositions of the present invention, the following Examples and Comparative Examples were prepared, and the ability of the compositions to control Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, and to deposit a topically active compound on a surface, were determined.  The<br><br>

The  following methods   were  used  in  the preparation  and  testing  of  the  examples:<br>
a)       Determination  of  Rapid Germicidal (Time  Kill)   Activity  of Antibacterial  Products,     The activity of  antibacterial   compositions' was  measured by  the  time   kill  method,   whereby  the  survival  of challenged  organisms  exposed  to  an  antibacterial test  composition  is determined  as   a  function  of time.      In  this test,   a  diluted  aliquot  of  the  composition   is  brought  into  contact   with  a  known population  of  test  bacteria   for  a   specified time  period  at a   specified  temperature.      The  test   composition  is neutralized  at the end of  the  time period,   which arrests   the   antibacterial   activity  of  the   composition .      The  percent  or,   alternatively,   log  reduction from  the  original bacteria  population  is   calculated. In   general,   the time  kill  method   is  known  to  those skilled  in  the art.<br>
The  composition  can  be   tested  at   any  concentration   from 0-100%.     The   choice  of  which  concentration  to use  is   at  the  discretion  of  the  investigator,   and  suitable   concentrations  are  readily determined  by those  skilled  in  the  art.      For example,   viscous   samples  usually  are  tested  at   50%<br><br>
dilution, whereas nonviscous samples are not diluted.  The test sample is placed in a sterile 250 ml beaker equipped with a' magnetic stirring bar and the sample volume is brought to 100 ml, if needed, with sterile deionized water.  All testing is performed in triplicate, the results are combined, and the average log reduction is reported.<br>
The choice of contact time period also is at the discretion of the investigatori     Any contact time period can be chosen.  Typical contact times range from 15 seconds to 5 minutes, with 30 seconds and 1 minute being typical contact times.  The contact temperature also can be any temperature, typically room temperature, or about 25 degrees Celsius.<br>
The bacterial suspension, or test inoculum, is prepared by growing a bacterial culture on any appropriate solid media (e.g., agar).  The bacterial population then is washed from the agar with sterile physiological saline and the population of the bacterial suspension is adjusted to about 108 colony forming units per ml (cfu/ml).<br>
The table below lists the test bacterial cultures used in the following tests and includes the name of the bacteria, the ATCC (American Type Culture Collection) identification number, and the abbreviation for the name of the organism vsed hereafter.<br><br><br>
S. aureus  is a Gram positive bacteria, whereas 5. coli,   K.   pneum,   and S.   choler.   are Gram negative bacteria.<br>
The beaker containing the test composition is placed in a water bath (if constant temperature is desired), or placed on a magnetic' stirrer (if ambient laboratory temperature is desired).  The sample then is inoculated with 1.0 ml of the test bacteria suspension.  The inoculum is stirred with the test composition for the predetermined contact time.  When the contact time expires, 1.0 ml of the test composition/bacteria mixture is transferred into 9.0 ml of Tryptone-Histidine-Tween Neutralizer Solution (THT).  Decimal dilutions to a countable range then are made.  The dilutions can differ for different organisms.  Plate selected dilutions in triplicate on TSA4 plates (TSA+ is Trypticase Soy Agar with Lecithin and Polysorbate 80).  The plates then are incubated for 25±2 hours, and the colonies are counted for the number of survivors and the calculation of percent or log reduction.  The control count (numbers control) is determined by conducting the procedure as described above with the exception that THT is used in place of the test composition.  The plate counts are converted to<br><br>
cfu/ml for the numbers control and samples, respectively, by standard microbiological methods.<br>
The log reduction is calculated using the formula<br>
Log reduction=logio (numbers control)-logio (test sample survivors)-<br>
The following table correlates percent reduction in bacteria population to log reduction:<br><br>
b)   Preparation of saturated solutions of TCS in water:  A four liter flask was equipped with a 3-inch magnetic stir bar and charged with approximately 7.5 grams (g) TCS and 3 liters (L) of water. The flask then was placed in a water bath, stirred, and heated (40~45°C) for at least 8 hours.  The flask containing the resulting TCS/water suspension was removed from the water bath, and the warm suspension filtered through a Coors #32-H porcelain Buchner funnel equipped with Whatman #40 (5.5cm) filter paper.  The filtering assembly was attached to a two liter vacuum filter flask, and filtration was conducted in batches.  The filtrate then was transferred to another four liter flask and allowed to cool.  Typically, fine needles of TCS  crystals<br><br>
formed after the filtrate was stored at room temperature for a few days.<br>
For some time kill studies, the TCS solution was refiltered at room temperature before use in the study.  For other time kill studies, a small amount of crystalline TCS was allowed to remain in the test container to ensure saturation in the event of a temperature change.  It was assumed that TCS crystals present in the time kill test vessel would not affect test results because crystalline TCS is unavailable to act on the bacteria (i.e., is not solubilized).<br>
To determine the concentration of TCS in the water solutions, filtered samples (in triplicate) were analyzed by HPLC.  The apparatus used to filter the solutions was a Whatman AUTOVIAL®, with 0.45*m PTFE membrane and glass microfiber prefilter, cat. No. AV12 5UORG.  TCS concentrations were calculated using a linear regression line fit (Microsoft EXCEL© software) to TCS/IPA standards included on the same HPLC run.<br>
c)   Preparation of aqueous TCS/surfactant compositions:  A French square bottle was charged with a solution containing a variable concentration of a surfactant and 0.3%, by weight, TCS.  The mixture was stirred and heated (35-40°C) for several hours until the TCS was solubilized.  Variable transformer-controlled heat lamps were used for warming and the temperature of the solution was monitored with a digital thermometer.  Stirring then was stopped, TCS seed  crystals (about 1 mg) were<br><br>
added to the solution, and the mixture was allowed to stand at about 20°C.  In a few .days, crystals were observed on the bottom of solution containers in which the maximum solubility of TCS was exceeded.<br>
The approximate concentration of surfactant necessary to almost completely solubilize the 0.3% TCS was determined by use of an experimental design in which the concentration of surfactant was serially reduced by a factor of two over a series of test samples until the approximate saturation point of TCS in the surfactant was observed.  Then the difference in concentration (saturated vs. just sol-ubilized) was halved until a close endpoint for TCS saturation could be determined.  The saturation point of TCS/surfactant compositions could be effectively estimated with small-scale (15 to 100 mL) samples, but about 600-800 g samples were required to obtain reliable final results.  The initial ranges, therefore, were established with small-scale samples, and the final concentrations were determined using larger-scale samples.<br>
d)   Preparation of compositions containing TCS and a solvent or solvent/hydrotrope combination:  TCS first was dissolved in the solvent used in the composition.  Water then was added to the TCS/solvent composition, followed' by the addition of about 1 mg of TCS seed crystals, and the resulting mixture was allowed to stand at about 20°C to crystallize.  In compositions containing a solvent, hydrotrope, and surfactant, the TCS was dissolved in the solvent as above, and then the hydrotrope and<br><br>
surfactant were added to the TCS/solvent solution. The resulting mixture then was diluted to the batch total with water-  Adjustment of pH also was performed, if required.  The mixture was stirred at room temperature for about an hour, seed TCS was added, and the mixture allowed to stand and crystallize as above.  The determination of the TCS saturation point described above also was used (i.e., halving surfactant concentrations).  Methods similar to the above for determination of maximum additive concentration have been described in the literature. For example, P.H. Elworthy et al.f "Solubilization by surface-active agents and its application in chemistry and biological sciences," Chapman and Hall, Ltd., London, pp. 62-65 (1968), describes determination of concentrations near saturation by observing turbidity of the mixture.  A similar technique was used by observing the sample at right angles with a high-intensity light from a small flashlight equipped with a beam focusing attachment (i.e., MINI MAGLITE® AA, MAG Instruments, California, USA).  This method also was used with solutions very near to saturation to enhance observation of small 'amounts of crystals formed on the bottom of containers.<br>
e)   Preparation' of samples:  The preparation of all samples involved equipment and procedures normally employed in formula development laboratories.  All percents were by weight based on the active level of each ingredient.<br><br>
f)	Summary formula descriptions in<br>
example tables:  A typical table entry for a test<br>
composition is "0."3TCS/5DPG/15SXS/0.75ALS."  This<br>
entry is defined as 0.3% triclosan (TCS), 5% di-<br>
propylene glycol (DPG), 15% sodium xylene sulfonate<br>
{SXS), 0.75% ammonium lauryl sulfate (ALS), and the remainder of the formula is water (typically with 0.2%, by total weight, of a citrate/phosphate buffer designed to provide a pH of about 6).<br>
g)	Pigskin deposition test:  The follow-'<br>
ing protocol is a general description of how the<br>
relative deposition efficiencies of various text<br>
compositions were determined.  The substrate was<br>
pigskin, which is similar to human skin in color and<br>
texture, and in having a layer of subcutaneous fat.<br>
Pigskin is well known in the art as a model sub<br>
strate for deposition assays.  The test samples<br>
(0.03 to 3 grams) first are weighed into 16 mL<br>
vials.  The sample size varied depending upon the nature of the test, i.e., different test protocols were used to simulate different use situations from high dilution to neat application.  Next, the pigskin samples (Brennen Medical, Inc., Mediskin I-Zenoderm, S-106) were cut into 3/8 inch diameter disks with a punch.  If the protocol required addition of water to the sample, a controlled amount of water was added to the sample in the vial just prior to exposure of the pigskin disks to the sample.  Typically, the water/sample mix was dispersed for 15 seconds by agitating the sample with a laboratory vortexer attached to a timer.  Four<br><br>
pigskin disks then were added, and the vial was agitated for another 30 seconds.  The sample/water mixture then was drained'with a pipette, and the pigskin was rinsed with 30 second vortexing in like fashion with 3x3 mL aliquots of distilled water.  On the last rinse, any remaining foam was carefully removed with a pipette.  The pigskins then were extracted overnight with isopropyl alcohol, and the extracts were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) for the amount of active ingredient extracted.  Control/recovery experiments were performed prior to testing to ensure that the isopropyl alcohol extraction procedure could adequately dissolve a known amount of active compound from the pigskin disks.<br>
h)   Dilution phase stability test:  This test provides an indication of the ability of various test compositions to deposit topically active compounds on the test substrate.  It also demonstrated the fundamental difference between the dilution behavior of a present composition and traditional compositions having solubilized actives. The test was conducted by diluting a given composition with a known amount of water (typically 25:50, 50:50, 75:25; all composition:water proportions weight/weight), then observing the formulation over an extended period of time.  The diluted samples were maintained at about 22°C to 25°C.  The appearance of a separate phase (e.g., turbidity, crystals, and/or precipitate) was considered an indication of active compound deposition.  As demonstrated by the<br><br>
examples, the compositions typically exhibited a sign of phase separation within-about 0,25 to 1 hour after dilution.<br>
i)   Volar forearm deposition test:  An in vivo  deposition test was performed using a small number of volunteer panelists and three sites on the volar forearms.  The sites were designated LI, L2, L3, and Rl, R2, R3f for left and right arms, respectively.  Site 1 was closest to the wrist, site 2 was in the middle of the forearm, and site 3 was near the inner elbow.<br>
Sites L3 and R3 were chosen as blank control sites to give baseline values on untreated skin.  These sites were treated as follows. A  glass sampling device was held over the test site.  One ml of isopropyl alcohol was placed on  the skin area confined by a glass cylinder, and the area (about 4.5 cm2) was scrubbed gently with a smooth glass rod for 60 seconds.  When scrubbing was complete, the isopropyl alcohol extract was transferred to a pre-weighed 16 mL vial using a fine-tipped 1 mL pipette.<br>
Treated sites {LI, L2, Rl, and R2) were processed as follows.  The skin site was wet by placing the site under running, warm water for about 15 seconds.  Test product was applied to the design-nated wet skin site, and the site was scrubbed gently for 30 seconds with the first and second fingers of the panelist's hand, followed by 15 seconds of rinsing with a gentle flow of warm tap )  water.  The site then was gently pat dried with a paper towel, and extracted as above for L3 and R3,<br><br>
except three 1 mL extractions were made at each site.<br>
The isopropyl alcohol extracts then were processed as described above in the "Pigskin Deposition Test" (HPLC analysis). The use of preweighed vials allowed for adjustments to be calculated for small solvent losses encountered in the extraction procedure.<br>
Table 2 summarizes the results of time kill tests performed on TCS/water compositions.  Two series of results, I and II, demonstrate the effect of % saturation in TCS/water compositions, i.e., that within a given test series, reduction in % saturation produces a concomitant reduction in time kill efficacy.<br><br><br><br>
Comparing the data in Tables 2 and, 3 shows that at the very lowest concentration of TCS (i.e., 5 to 10 ppm) , the efficacy of time kill is reduced compared to samples containing higher levels of TCS. For example, a sample in Table 2 containing 0.93 ppm TCS has a log reduction of 0.44 after 15 seconds vs. E.   coli,   whereas a sample in Table 3 containing 484 ppm TCS had a log reduction of 4.13 after 15 seconds vs. the same organism.  This effect is more apparent at shorter-contact time periods.  Another example, in more complex compositions is illustrated in samples in Table 3, i.e., 50 ppm TCS (est.&gt;/10%PG/-5%SXS vs. (448 ppm TCS (est.)/20%PG/10%SXS).  The sample with the higher TCS concentration showed at least a log improvement in bacterial reduction after 1 minute.  The data in Table 3 also show differences in efficacy when different solvents/hydrotropes are used with approximately the same TCS concentrations.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The compositions of the present invention contain a surfactant, which potentially can reduce the efficacy of the antibacterial agent.  The following examples show the unexpected benefits achieved by compositions of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
In this example, a composition of the present invention was compared to three commercially available antibacterial cleansing compositions in a time kill test using a contact time of 5 minutes.  A composition of the present invention (Product A) was a saturated solution containing 0.3% triclosan in a 1.5% aqueous sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)*  The three commercially available antibacterial compositions having unknown triclosan concentrations, were Jergens Antibacterial (JA) Hand Soap, a product of Andrew Jergens Inc.; Clean and Smooth (CS), a product of Benckiser; and Soft Soap (SSp), a product of Colgate Palmolive.<br><br><br>
Example 1 demonstrates the surprising improvement in log reduction of bacteria populations provided by an inventive composition compared to currently available commercial antibacterial compositions.  Thus, an aqueous composition containing triclosan in SLS, at 100% saturation, offers significantly greater antibacterial.efficacy than any of the three commercial products tested, against Gram positive and against Gram negative microorganisms, both of which can present a significant health threat to consumers.<br>
Example 2<br>
This example demonstrates that the antibacterial activity of an inventive composition is attributable to the active antibacterial agent, as opposed to the surfactant.  Test compositions A-l and A-2 were prepared-  Composition A-l is a solution containing 0.3% triclosan, 1.35% ammonium lauryl sulfate, with the balance being water. Composition A-l is 100% saturated with triclosan. Composition A-2 is a "placebo," i.e., an aqueous 1.35% ammonium lauryl sulfate solution that is free of the active antibacterial agent.<br><br><br>
The inventive composition A-l clearly provided an excellent, broad spectrum antibacterial activity, whereas the "placebo" composition A~2 exhibited an extremely limited spectrum of activity. Composition A-2 has especially poor efficacy against Gram negative organisms.  Control of Gram negative organisms is of particular concern to consumers because such organisms present a significant health threat.  The excellent broad spectrum activity of composition A-l clearly shows that the antibacterial activity is unambiguously attributed to the presence of the antibacterial agent in the continuous aqueous phase.<br>
Example 3<br>
In this example, a solvent, (i.e., propylene glycol (PG)) was used to solubilize triclosan in an aqueous carrier.  No hydrotrope or surfactant was present.  Composition A-3 contained 0.0872% by weight triclosan, 47.5% aqueous PG, and the balance being water.  Composition A-3 was 100% saturated with triclosan and is a composition of the present invention.  Test composition A-4 was a "placebo" consisting of 47.5% PG, by weight, and the balance water.  This example illustrates an added advantage of including an optional hydric solvent in the composition.  In particular, it was observed that the excellent broad spectrum activity illustrated in earlier examples at contact times of 1 and 5 minutes can be achieved in the presence of the hydric solvent at a contact time of 30 seconds.  This example.<br><br>
further demonstrates that the antibacterial activity of a present composition is unambiguously attributable to the presence of the antibacterial agent.<br><br>
Example 4<br>
This example illustrates the effect of the identity of the surfactant on the antibacterial activity of the composition.  The test results summarized below were performed on a wide variety of compositions containing either an anionic surfactant or representative cationic, anionic/nonionic, amphoteric, and nonionic surfactants.  The percent saturation of TCS in the compositions of this example is at least about 90%.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The results summarized above demonstrate, unexpectedly, that antibacterial agents and anionic surfactants form highly effective antibacterial compositions when the % saturation of antibacterial agent in the composition is high, i.e., at least 50%,  In addition, it was observed that, within a homologous series of surfactants, efficacy can vary (i.e., in the sodium alkyl sulfate homologous series, sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium octyl sulfate yielded high efficacy formulas).  The efficacy with respect to the cation also is unexpected {i.e., sodium, ammonium, and triethanolammonium lauryl sulfates provided high efficacy formulas, whereas lithium and magnesium lauryl sulfates did not).<br>
Example 5<br>
—<br>
The   following  table  summarizes  the   effect of   surfactant   identity  on  the  antibacterial   activity of  the  composition.     This   example  expands  upon   the data  provided  in Example   4.     The  table  includes   results   of  tests performed  on  a  wide  variety  of  compositions  containing  either  anionic  surfactants   or representative examples   containing  cationic, anionic/nonionic,   amphoteric,   and  nonionic   surfactants .<br>
The  results   demonstrate  that  various anionic   surfactants   form  highly  effective   systems. The   surfactants  associated with  very high  activity (i.e.,   a  high  log   reduction   for  both  Gram positive (S.   aureus)   and  Gram negative   (E.   coli)   bacteria) include   sodium lauryl   sulfate,   sodium  octyl   sulfate,<br><br>
sodium 2-ethylhexyl sulfate, and lauramine oxide. However, it is possible that the high activity of the lauramine oxide containing composition was due primarily to the surfactant.<br>
Series I (Lauryl Sulfates) demonstrates efficacy effects attributed to the cation.  The sodium lauryl sulfate had the highest efficacy, wherein ammonium, monoethanolammonium and tri-ethanolammonium exhibited intermediate efficacy. Lithium and magnesium sulfates exhibited low efficacy.  Potassium lauryl sulfate was not tested because of its low solubility at room temperature.<br>
Comparing Series I (Lauryl Sulfates) and Series II (Other Alkyl Sulfates) shows that efficacy varies within a homologous series (i.e., sodium n-alkyl sulfates). Sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium octyl sulfate yield high efficacy formulas, as does the branched chain surfactant, sodium 2-ethylhexyl sulfate.<br>
The data in Series III (Alkyl Carboxyl-ates) suggests that TCS/carboxylate compositions are not highly active against Gram negative bacteria, but are of acceptable activity against Gram positive bacteria.<br>
The results for Series IV (EO-Containing Surfactants) confirm observations that ethylene oxide (EO) in surfactants tends to inactivate TCS. The activity of SLES-1 and SLES-2 vs. 5. aureus is attributed to the anionic ("lauryl sulfate-like" character) of these anionic/nonionic surfactants.<br><br>
The results for Series V {Miscellaneous Surfactants) shows that these compositions exhibit moderate to low activity, with the exception of lauramine oxide.  The portion of high activity of LAO is attributed to the surfactant alone because of its quasi-cationic character.  The remaining surfac-tant/TCS compositions in Series V showed varied activity vs. S.   aureus   (Gram positive) and very little activity vs. E.   coli   (Gram negative).<br><br><br><br>
Example 6<br>
This example illustrates the effect of % 5  saturation of TCS in surfactant compositions (i.e., compositions free of a hydric solvent and hydro-trope) .  The data summarized in the following table illustrate the effect of % saturation of TCS on the efficacy of TCS in TCS/surfact'ant/water composi-<br>
10  tions.  Two sections of the table (i.e., TCS/ALS compositions vs. B.   cdli  and TCS/SOS compositions vs. S. aureus) show a substantial decrease in antibacterial activity with decreasing % saturation. Also, 100% saturated samples (0.15%TCS/0.67%ALS) and<br>
15  [0.15%TCS/4.0%SOS) have an antibacterial activity<br>
approaching that of 100% saturated samples contain-<br><br>
ing 0.3% TCS.  In these two examples, the effects are seen clearly for organisms wherein the surfactant does not show a strong placebo kill effect.<br><br>
This example illustrates a composition of the present invention that can be used as a hand cleanser.  This example further illustrates an embodiment of the invention wherein the antibacterial agent is present in combination with a surfactant, hydric solvent, and hydrotrope.  Composition A-5 contains, by weight, 0.3% triclosan, 0.5% ammonium lauryl sulfate, 20% propylene glycol, and 10% sodium xylene sulfonate, with the balance water.<br><br>
Composition A-6, by weight, contains 0.1% triclosan, 0.125% ammonium xylene sulfonate, ,20% propylene glycol, and 10% sodium xylene sulfonate the balance being water.  Compositions A-5 and A-6 were 100% saturated with triclosan-  Composition A-7 was a "placebo*' containing, by weight, 0.5% ammonium lauryl sulfate, 20% propylene glycol, 10% sodium xylene sulfate, and the balance being water.<br><br>
This example illustrates two important features of the present invention.  First, the absolute amount of triclosan, or other antibacterial agent, is less important than the percent saturation of antibacterial agent in the composition.  For example, composition A-6 (containing 0.10% triclosan) was at least as  effective as composition A-5 (containing 0.3% triclosan).  The important feature is that both compositions were 100% saturated with triclosan.  Second, Example 5 also clearly showed that the active antibacterial agent is responsible for the excellent broad soectrum antibacterial<br>
A.<br>
activity.  Compositions A-5 and A-6 of the invention clearly outperformed the "placebo" composition A-7, which did not contain an  active antibacterial agent.<br><br>
Example 8<br>
This example demonstrates that a hydric solvent and hydrotrope can impart activity to an otherwise inactive surfactant and antibacterial agent composition.  In the following table, all percentages are by weight, and the balance of all compositions is water.  Composition B contains 1.35% ammonium lauryl sulfate (ALS) and 0.3% triclosan (TCS).  Composition C contains 1.35% ALS and 0.0% TCS.  Composition D contains 0.25% ALS, 14.4% DPG, 10.0% SXS, and 0.3% TCS, and Composition E contains 0.25% ALS, 14.4% DPG, 10.0% SXS with 0.0% TCS. Compound F contains 2.5% alkyl polyglucoside (APGm) with 0.3% TCS.  Compound G contains 0.3% APG, 14.4% diprcpylene glycol (DPG), 10% sodium xylene sulfonate (SXS), and 0.3% TCS.  Compound H contains 0.3% APG with 14.4% DPG, 10% SXS, and 0.0% TCS. Composition I contains 1.25% sodium cocoamphoacetate (SCA) and 0.3% TCS.  Composition J contains 0.25% SCA, 14.4% DPG, 10.0% SXS, and 0.3% TCS.  Composition K contains 0.251 SCA, 14.4% DPG, 10.0% SXS, and 0.0% TCS.  Composition L contains 1.75% cocamido-propyl betaine (CAPB) and 0.3% TCS.  Composition M contains 0.25% CAPB, 14.4% DPG, 10% SXS, and 0.3% TCS.  Composition N contains 0.25% CAPB, 14.4% DPG, 10% SXS, and 0.0% TCS.  Composition 0 contains 4% octoxynol-9 (TRITON X-100™, TX100) .  Composition P contains 0.75% TX100, 14.4% DPG, 10.0% SXS, and 0.3% TCS.  Composition Q contains 1.25% sodium lauryl ether sulfate (1 EO, SLES-1) and 0.3% TCS.  Composi-<br><br>
tion R contains 0.25% SLES-1, 14.4% DPG, 10.0% SXS, and 0.3% TCS.<br><br>
The results of the time kill tests summarized in the above table very surprisingly show<br><br>
that the use of a hydric solvent and hydrotrope can impart a high antibacterial activity to surfactant/-TCS combinations which alone exhibit only low to moderate efficacy (i.e., compare efficacy of composition F vs. G; I vs. J; L vs. M; and Q vs. R).  The hydric solvent and hydrotrope also can render active compositions more active in shorter contact times (i.e., compare composition B vs. D).  Especially surprising is the observation that a hydric solvent and hydrotrope can impart antibacterial efficacy against E.   coli  even in a composition containing a nonionic surfactant, i.e., octoxynol-9 (compare compositions 0 vs. P) *  This result is unexpected because polyethoxylated surfactants are known to inactivate phenolic antibacterial agents.<br>
Example 9<br>
This example demonstrates the importance of % saturation in compositions containing a hydric solvent and hydrotrope.  As observed in surfactant/-TCS compositions, the relative % saturation of the antibacterial agent in the continuous aqueous phase of the composition also greatly influences the antibacterial activity of compositions containing a hydric solvent and hydrotrope.  As the results summarized below illustrate, this influence on antibacterial activity is especially apparent with respect to the Gram negative bacterium, K.   pneum.<br><br><br>
From the above data, it is clear that an increase in antibacterial efficacy, as measured by a time kill test, is associated with an increasing % saturation of the antibacterial agent in the aqueous phase of a given composition.  This example further shows that compositions containing an antibacterial agent, surfactant, hydric solvent, and hydrotrope are effective when a high % saturation of active antibacterial agent is maintained.<br>
1  Example 10<br>
This   example,   in   conjunction with   Example 9,    illustrates  the  effect  of   %   saturation  of  TCS  in<br><br>
compositions containing a hyciric solvent, hydro-trope, and surfactant.  As previously observed with simple surfactant/TCS compositions, the relative % saturation of the antibacterial agent in the composition also influences the antibacterial activity of a composition containing a hydric solvent and/or a hydrotrope.  From the data summarized in the table of Example 9 and the following table, it is clear that a substantial gain in antibacterial efficacy [as  measured by a time kill test) is associated with an increasing % saturation of the antibacterial agent in a given type of composition.  The tables demonstrate this effect from two different perspectives.  The table in Example 9 shows the effect of changing the concentration of surfactant while main-■ taining the amount of other composition components constant.  The following table shows the effect of varying the concentration of TCS while the concentration of all other components is kept constant. In the table of Example 9, the information relating to % saturation is relative because % saturation is difficult to directly calculate.  Even using this qualitative data, the effect of % saturation of TCS is clear from both tables for all organisms tested.<br><br><br><br>
Example 11<br>
This example illustrates the effect of different levels of hydric solvent and hydrotrope on antibacterial efficacy.  In particular, the data summarized below demonstrates the effect of varying the relative amounts of hydric solvent and hydro-trope.  It should further be noted that the addition 1  of a perfume (PF) and/or a preservative (DMDM) to the composition had only a modest effect, if any, on the antibacterial efficacy of the compositions.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
It was observed that for compositions S, T, and U, the antibacterial activity against S. aureus and K. pneum.   increases, especially, with a decreasing wt% of ALS surfactant (i.e., an increase in % saturation of TCS).  Compositions CC, HH, MM, and RR demonstrate that about 15% SXS, or more, is preferred to exhibit high activity against K.  pneum. in compositions containing a hydric solvent and a hydrotrope.  This observation suggests that the hydrotrope may be acting as an adjuvant for the TCS because the time required for a substantial antibacterial kill, i.e., log reduction of at least 2, is reduced.<br>
Example 12<br>
The data summarized in the following table support a theory that the two primary factors for improved antibacterial efficacy are the relative amounts of surfactant and hydrotrope to the amount of antibacterial agent in compositions containing a surfactant, hydric solvent, and antibacterial agent. h  higher percentage of surfactant can reduce the % saturation, and thereby decrease the antimicrobial activity of the composition.  On the other hand, a higher percentage of hydrotrope appears to provide a higher activity against certain organisms, like K. pneum.   and S.   choler.      It is theorized that the higher percentage of hydrotrope in the composition provides a greater amount of active antibacterial compound in the aqueous (i.e., nonmicellar) phase of the composition, thereby providing a higher time<br><br>
kill activity.  The solvent, therefore, may be acting as both an additive to enhance antimicrobial activity and to provide better physical stability in these compositions.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
In addition to the observation that other solvents (e.g., PG and TPG) can- be used in compositions of the present invention, products JJJJ through 0000 illustrate another effect of relative saturation of antibacterial agent in the system. The relative % saturation (highest to lowest) of the first three -compositions is JJJJ&gt;KKKK&gt;LLLL.  Composition KKKK has one-third the amount of TCS as composition JJJJ solubilized in the same level of ALS (0.5%), and compositions LLLL contains 0% TCS. Significant reductions in activity were observed, with respect to K. pneum.   and S. choler.   when the relative % saturation of TCS in the composition decreases.  It also was observed that when the relative % saturation is essentially equal (i.e., about 100%), the activity remains essentially constant even though the absolute amount of TCS in the composition is decreased (i.e., compare Compositions MMMM to NNNN).  These data further support the observations with respect to the importance of % saturation set forth in Example 6.<br>
In addition, a comparison of composition IIII to composition TTTT shows that composition TTTT contains slightly less ALS (0.9% vs. 1.0% for IIII), the same amount of PG (10.0%), and one-half the amount of SXS (5.0% vs. 10.0% for IIII).  Experimental observations indicated that compositions IIII and TTTT were at or near 100% saturation.  However, the log reductions of E.   coli   were considerably lower (about 4 log) for Composition TTTT.  This observation further supports the data set forth in<br><br>
Example 7 wherein minimum level of hydrotrope may be needed for a high antibacterial efficacy against at least some Gram negative bacteria.<br>
Example 13 Dilution Tests<br>
As described above, this test provides an indication of the ability of various compositions of the present invention to deposit topically active compounds on a test substrate.  It also demonstrates that there is a fundamental difference between the dilution behavior of the present compositions and traditional compositions having solubilized actives. In the table below, Samples 13A through 13F are compositions of the present invention.  Samples 13A through 13E show indications of phase separation very soon after dilution.  Sample 13F phase separated after about 2 weeks.  This observation is attributed to Sample 13F having a lower percent saturation of active ingredient than Samples 13A-13E.<br><br><br><br>
Samples 13G through 13K are examples of active compound solubilized in surfactant alone<br>
(ALS).  In those samples, the active compound does not phase separate from the composition upon dilution.  These samples illustrate a fundamental difference in the present compositions versus surfactant-solubilized actives, i.e., although the TCS is nearly 100% saturated in Samples 13G-13I<br>
(0.3%TCS/1.35ALS), no phase separation is observed upon dilution.  Therefore, percent saturation of topically active compound is one factor in the deposition performance of the present compositions, but not the only factor.  The unique ability of the present composition to phase separate upon dilution is also an important factor.  Note also, Samples 13L-130 behave like solubilized active systems in that they do not phase separate on dilution.<br>
Example 14 Deposition Test Using Triclosan (TCS)<br>
Examples of the present compositions were tested using the deposition test protocol described above.  The mean deposition values were determined and subjected to. statistical analysis (analysis of variance, ANOVA).  As indicated in the table below, means with different letters have statistically significant differences at the 95% confidence limit. Note that four examples of the present composition (Samples 14A-14D) surprisingly have exceptional deposition enhancement over Commercial Product C, and substantial enhancements over Commercial Products A and B.  Also note that although Sample<br><br>
14B contains 0.3% TCS and Commercial Product C contains 0.2% TCS, the improved deposition enhancement (12.6 times greater for Example 14B) cannot be expected from the TCS content difference alone {i.e., only 1.5 times more TCS).<br><br>
Note:  Means with different letters (3rd column) are i   significantly different at 95%.<br>
Example 15 Deposition Test Using Triclosan (TCS)<br>
A second set of examples of the present compositions was tested using the deposition test protocol described above.  The mean deposition<br>
&gt;  values were determined and are presented as above. As in Example 14, samples based on the present compositions outperformed the traditional solubil-ized compositions.  In this example, deposition enhancement was about fourteen times greater when<br>
)  compositions containing comparable amounts of TCS were compared (i.e., Example 15C vs. Example 15E,<br><br>
and Example 15D vs. Commercial Product C).  In addition, this example illustrates, the effect of percent saturation on deposition efficacy.  It was observed that relative deposition decreases with decreasing relative % saturation.  Comparative Sample 15E was a traditional, solubilized active composition having a base formulation very similar to Commercial Product C-<br><br>
Note:      Means   with  different   letters   (3rd  column)   are   significantly  different  at   95%<br>
Example   16  Deposition  Test Using the   Sunscreen   Benzophenone-3    (BPh-3)<br>
The  present   compositions  also were  tested for   sunscreen  deposition.     The mean  deposition values  were  determined   and  are presented  as  before. As   in  earlier  examples,   samples  which  are  based   on the  present   compositions    (i.e.,   Samples   16A,   163,<br><br>
 outperrormed the. traditional, solubil-ized composition (Samples 16C and 16G).<br><br>
Note:.    Means   with  different   letters   (3rd  column)   are   significantly  different  at   95%<br>
Example  16A Deposition   Test Using the   Sunscreen,   BenzophenonQ-3   (BPh-3)<br><br>
Note:     Means  with different   letters   (3rd column)   are  significantly  different  at   95%<br>
Example   17   Deposition   Test  Using   a Vitamin Derivative,   Vitamin  £  Acetate   (VitEOAc)<br>
The  present   compositions   also were  tested using  a   vitamin  derivative.     The  mean  deposition values   were  determined   and   are  presented  as   before,<br><br>
except the ANOVA test  was  not performed in this test.     The  values  are   approximate  because the  HPLC comparisons were  estimated by hand'analysis. Notwithstanding  the  approximations,   the  indications are  clear that samples   are based on the present compositions  outperformed  the  traditional,   solubil-ized  compositions,   i.e.,   Compare  Example   17A  to Example  17B,   and  Example   17C  to  Commercial   Product D.<br><br>
Example   18  Deposition   Test Using  a<br>
Perfume   Ingredient,   alpha-Hexyl-<br>
cinnamaldehyde   (AHCALD)	<br>
The   present   compositions  were  also  tested using  a  fragrance  ingredient.     The mean  deposition values  were  determined  and  are  presented  as  before. The   sample  based  on  the  present   compositions (Example  18A)   outperformed  a  traditional,   solubil-ized   composition   (Example   18B).<br><br><br>
Note:  Means with different letters (3rd column) are significantly different at 55%<br>
Example 19 Deposition Test Using Triclocan<br>
(TCS) Solubilized .in Solutions of Ammonium<br>
Lauryl Sulfate (ALS)	<br>
This examples shows the effect of percent saturation on the ability of the topically active ingredient to deposit on a surface.  These results indicate, surprisingly, that for topically active compounds solubilized in surfactant solutions, the relative deposition increases with increasing percent saturation.<br><br>
Example 20 Comparison of Pigskin vs. Volar Forearm Deposition Test Results<br>
This example includes tests showing a comparison of the Pigskin Deposition Test to a Volar<br><br>
Forearm Deposition Test, and contains additional examples illustrating improved deposition performance of compositions of the present invention over traditional compositions.  The volar forearm test validates the pigskin test.  Further, the additional examples include a thickened composition that can be dispensed from ordinary packages as opposed to more expensive self-foaming pumps.<br>
In particular, a composition of the present invention, i.e., Sample 20A, containing 0.975TCS/15SXS/5DPG/2.5ALS/0.75CAPB/0.20 Fragrance plus a pH buffer and colorants, was tested on human forearms.  In a separate test, a commercially available hand wash product containing 0.18% TCS was tested.  The test results for these tests are illustrated in the table below.<br><br><br>
For comparison, the samples used in the Volar Forearm Deposition Test were tested using the Pigskin Deposition Test, together with two additional compositions of the present invention, i.e.:<br>
Sample 20B (a thickened composition containing 1.OTCS/15.OSXS/5.ODPG/2.5ALS/-0.75CAPB/0.8 Natrosol 250 HHR Cs (hydroxy-ethylcellulose polymer)/0.20 Fragrance (plus a pH buffer and colorants); and<br>
Sample No. 20C (a composition containing additional skin care ingredients, i.e., 0.4 6TCS/15.OSXS/5.ODPG/2.91   glycerin/1.0 sodium PCA/0.75ALS/0.75CAPB/0.25 Poly-quaternium-10/0.1 Cetyl Alcohol/0.1 Aloe Barbadensis/(plus fragrance, a pH buffer, preservatives and colorants).<br><br>
The deposition results for Sample 20A in the pigskin test compared favorably with the data from the in   vivo  test.  However, the pigskin results showed a somewhat higher deposition of the commercial product than the in  vivo  test.  This has been attributed to an extraction technique for the pigskin test that may be more aggressive than in the<br><br>
in  vivo  test.  Further, lower amounts of topically active compound may be more difficult to extract completely from a surface,(i.e., binding "sites" are overwhelmed where more active compound is on the surface).  As such, retrieval of most of the sample from a high deposition formula like Sample 20A is expected, whereas complete recovery of the active compound from a low depositing formula, like the commercial product, is not expected, especially if the extraction technique for the in  vivo  test is less aggressive.  The pigskin deposition test, therefore, has been demonstrated as an effective screening model for deposition performance on human skin.<br>
In addition, it should be noted that all of the three examples of the invention composition deposited the active ingredient in an amount at least three times greater than the commercial product.<br>
The data presented in the above tables show that % saturation of a topically effective compound in a present composition can be directly correlated to a log reduction of bacteria, i.e., to efficacy.  For example, as shown in the prior tables, a composition having 50% saturation of TCS in the aqueous phase demonstrates a log reduction versus S. aureus  of 1.96 (30 seconds) and 3.05 (60 seconds) and a log reduction versus E.   coli  of 2.45 (30 seconds) and greater than 3.81 (60 seconds).  A 75% saturated and a 100% saturated composition exhibited a log reduction of greater than 4.55 (30<br><br>
and 60 seconds) vs. S. aureus (i.e., a log reduction in excess of.the detection limit of the assay).  The 75% and 100% saturated compositions, exhibited a log reduction of 3.40 (30 seconds) and greater than 3.81 (60 seconds) and greater than 3.81 (30 and 60 seconds) vs. E. coli,   respectively.  Accordingly, the present antibacterial compositions can be characterized as exhibiting a log reduction of at least about 2 (after 30 seconds) or at least about 3 (after 60 seconds) vs. S. aureus, or of at least about 2.5 (after 30 seconds) or at least about 3.5 (after 60 seconds) -vs. E. coli.<br>
In addition, the compositions have an enhanced ability to deposit the topically active compound on a treated surface, thereby providing an effective residual activity.  Prior compositions did not have an -ability to effectively deposit the topically active compound, and the topically active compound was removed during the rinsing step, and wasted.  The present compositions, therefore, have a dual benefit of a rapid, effective topical effect, and an excellent residual effect.<br>
The topically active compositions of the present invention have several practical end uses, including hand cleansers, mouthwashes, surgical scrubs, body splashes, hand sanitizer gels, hair care products, topical medicaments, skin care products, and similar personal care products.  Additional types of compositions include foamed compositions, such as creams, mousses, and the like, and compositions containing organic and inorganic filler<br><br>
materials, such as emulsions, lotions, creams, pastes, and the like.  The compositions further can be used as an antibacteriel cleanser for hard surfaces, for example, sinks and countertops in hospitals, food service areas, and meat processing plants.  The present antibacterial compositions can be manufactured as dilute ready-to-use compositions, or as concentrates that are diluted prior to use.<br>
The compositions also can be incorporated into a web material to provide an antibacterial wiping article.  The wiping article can be used to clean and sanitize skin or inanimate surfaces.<br>
The present compositions provide the advantages of a broad spectrum kill of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria in short contact times. The short contact time for a substantial log reduction of bacteria is important in. view of the typical 15 to 60 second time frame used to cleanse and sanitize the skin and inanimate surfaces.  The compositions also effectively deposit the topically active compound for a strong residual topical effect.<br>
The present compositions are effective in short contact time because the topically active compound is present in the aqueous continuous phase of the composition, as opposed to surfactant micelles. The active compound, therefore, is available to immediately begin providing a topical effect, and further effectively deposits on the skin, hair, or other surface to provide residual topical efficacy. In addition, because the topically effective com-<br><br>
pound is in solution as opposed to surfactant micelles, the absolute amount of topically effective compound in the composition can be',reduced without adversely affecting efficacy, and the topically active compound is not rinsed from the skin with the surfactant prior to performing its antibacterial function.  The topically active compound also is effectively deposited on the skin to provide an excellent residual effect.  In addition, the amount 1  of surfactant in the present topically active compositions typically is low, thereby providing additional environmental benefits.<br>
The following examples illustrate various compositions of the present invention.<br>
Example 21 Hand Wash Composition<br>
A  composition in accordance with the instant invention, suitable for use as a hand wash, was prepared.  The composition contained the following components in the indicated weight percentages:<br><br><br>
The composition was prepared by admixing 'the dipropylene glycol, TCS, and fragrance until homogeneous (about 5 minutes).  After the triclosan was completely dissolved, as evidenced by the absence of undissolved solid material, the sodium xylene sulfonate was added to the solution.  The resulting mixture then was stirred to completely dissolve the sodium xylene sulfonate (about 5 minutes).

Example 25 Hand Wash Composition<br>
A composition in accordance with the present invention, suitable for use as   a hand wash, was prepared.  The composition comprised the following components at the indicated weight percentages:<br><br><br>
The composition was prepared by first admixing the triclosan and dipropylene glycol until homogeneous (about 5 minutes).  After ,the triclosan was completely dissolved,* as evidenced by the absence of undissolved solid material, the sodium xylene sulfonate was added to the solution.  The mixture then was stirred to completely dissolve the sodium xylene sulfonate (about 5 minutes).  Finally, the ammonium lauryl sulfate and water were added to the resulting solution, and the composition was stirred until homogeneous (about 5 minutes).<br>
The composition had a weight ratio of surfactant;triclosan of 2.5:1 and was at least about 90% saturated with triclosan.  The composition was evaluated for its antibacterial efficacy against S. aureus,   E.   coli,   K.  pnevm.,   and S. choler.   using a time kill test, and a contact time of 30 seconds. The composition exhibited log reductions of &gt;3.59, &gt;4.49, &gt;3.20, and &gt;4.27 against the four test organisms , respectively.<br>
Thus, the composition exhibited an excellent broad spectrum antibacterial activity.  In addition, the composition was an excellent hand wash composition in an actual use test, providing both good cleansing and a smooth feel to the hands.<br><br>
Example 26 Comparison to a Previously Disclosed Composition<br>
This'example compares the antibacterial efficacy of a composition of the present invention to a previously disclosed composition.  Accordingly, the composition of Example 18 was compared to the sole example disclosed in WO98/01110.  In both compositions, the active antibacterial agent was tri-closan (TCS).  Both compositions were evaluated for antibacterial efficacy in a time kill test against S. aureusr   E.   colii   K.   pneum., and S. choler-  The example of WO98/01110 was tested at 50% dilution, in accordance with the test procedure for viscous' compositions .  The following data summarizes the percent of active antibacterial agent in each composition at the test dilution (i.e., test dilution is 100% for the composition of Example 18 and 50% for the example of WO98/01110), and the log reduction observed in the time kill test at a contact time of 30 seconds.<br><br>
This example demonstrates the superior time kill performance of a composition of the present invention compared to a prior composition, especially against Gram negative bacteria. 'This superiority is demonstrated even through the co'mpar-<br><br>
ative composition contained substantially more active antibacterial agent compared to the inventive composition.  Thus, an inventive composition utilizes the active agent .more efficiently, as illustrated in a higher log reduction using a reduced concentration of antibacterial agent.<br>
Example 27 Comparison to a Previously Disclosed Composition<br>
This example compares the -antibacterial efficacy of a composition of the present invention to a previously disclosed composition.  Accordingly, the composition of Example 25 was compared to a composition disclosed in WO96/06152.  WO96/06152 discloses effective compositions comprising TCS, an anionic surfactant, a hydrotrope, a hydric solvent, and further comprising an organic acid, specifically citric acid.  WO96/06152 contains additional pH adjusting agents, such as monoethanolamine and sodium hydroxide.  Further, the examples disclosed in WO96/06152 all have a pH of 4 or 9.1, with no examples having a desirable, neutral pH of about 7. A pH of about 7 is desired for compositions contacting skin or inanimate surfaces because compositions of pH substantially different from 7, such as 4 or 9.1, have a greater potential to damage the surfaces they contact.  Accordingly, the composition of Example 1 of WO96/06152 (hereafter referred to as composition 27-A) was prepared.  For comparison, composition 27-A was prepared as above, except that the pH was adjusted, to 7 by the addition of further<br><br>
monoethaholamine   (this   composition  hereafter   referred  to  as   composition  27-B).      To  provide  an<br>
j<br>
additional comparison,   the  composition of  Example  3 of  WO96/06152  was prepared,   except  that  it  was prepared at   a pH of  7  by the addition of  further monoethanolamine   (this  composition is hereafter referred to  as  composition  27-C).     The  table  below summarizes  the  results   of ' a  time■kill  test  on  the compositions  of this   example  against  the bacteria indicated  at  a  contact   time  of. 30  seconds.<br><br>
This  example   demonstrates   the  superior time   kill  performance   of   a .composition  of  the  present   invention  compared  to  prior   compositions,   especially with  respect   to  Gram negative  bacteria   at   a pH  of  about  7.     From the  data  presented  in this example,   it  can be  concluded that  the  compositions of  WO96/06152   rely  substantially  on  a  relatively extreme pH   (either  A   or  9,   as  disclosed)   to achieve a  desirable,   rapid  and  broad  spectrum reduction  of bacterial  populations.     This  is   in  contrast  to Example   18   of  the present   invention,   which  provides 3   rapid  broad  spectrum bacteria   kill   at   the  desirable   pH  of  about  7.<br><br>
Example 28 Antibacterial Composition Containing; PCMX<br>
An antibacterial' composition in accordance with the present invention containing p-chloro-m-xylenol (PCMX) as the active antibacterial agent was prepared.  The composition contained the following components in the indicated weight percentages:<br><br>
The composition was prepared by first mixing the PCMX and ethanol to completely solubilize the PCMX (about 5 minutes). After the PCMX was completely dissolved, as evidenced by the absence of undissolved solid material, the water was added, and the composition was stirred until homogeneous (about 5 minutes).<br>
The composition was at least about 90% saturated with PCMX.  The composition was evaluated for antibacterial efficacy against S. aureus,   E. coli,   K.  pneum.,   and S.   choler.   using a time kill test.  Against 5. aureus, the composition exhibited a log reduction of 4.16 in 30 seconds; against E. coli   the composition exhibited a log reduction of &gt;4.34 in 30 seconds; against K. pneum.   the composition exhibited a log reduction of 3.99 in 30 seconds; and against S. choler.   the composition exhibited a log reduction of &gt;4.04   in 30 seconds. Thus, the composition exhibited an  excellent broad spectrum antibacterial activity.<br><br>
Example'29 Antibacterial Composition Containing PCMX<br>
A composition in accordance with the present invention incorporating p-chloro-m-xylene as the active antibacterial ingredient was prepared.  The composition contained the following components in the indicated weight percentages:<br><br>
The composition was prepared by  first combining the PCMX and water, then adding the ammonium lauryl sulfate and mixing the components for such time as to completely admix the components and dissolve the PCMX (about 2 hours).<br>
The composition was at least about 90% saturated with PCMX.  The composition was evaluated for its antibacterial efficacy against S. aureus and E.   coli  using a time kill test.  Against S. aureus, the composition exhibited a log reduction of &gt;3.57 in 30 seconds; and against E,   coli  the composition exhibited a log reduction of &gt;4.17 in 30 seconds. Thus, the composition exhibited an excellent broad spectrum antibacterial activity.<br>
