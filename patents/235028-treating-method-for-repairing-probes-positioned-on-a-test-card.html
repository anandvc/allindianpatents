				<td>		TREATING METHOD FOR PROBES POSITIONED ON A TEST CARD<br>
		BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
		1. Field of the Invention<br>
5		This invention relates to a treating method for probes positioned on<br>
	a test card, particularly to one for plating a layer of film on the tips or the<br>
	shanks of probes positioned on a test card, and the film material may be a<br>
	metal, a metal alloy or a non-mental material depending on different<br>
	necessities, so the probes may be repaired or not attract much dirt and<br>
10	residue, upgrading electric conductivity or insulating property, and<br>
	preventing electromagnetic interference from occurring.<br>
		2, Description of the Prior Art<br>
		Common testees such as chip discs, IC, DRAM, etc. are to be<br>
	tested by a tester to find whether they possess the designed capability<br>
15	features required or not. Then unqualified products may be eliminated to<br>
	secure the quality of the products to be sold or used. A test card 1 used for<br>
	testing is shown in Figs. 1 and 2, provided with a circuit board 11, a<br>
	position base 12 mounted on the circuit board 11, and a plurality of probes<br>
	13 arranged on the position base 12. The probes 13 are connected<br>
20	electrically with the circuit board 11 by leads 14, made of conductive metal<br>
	or other conductive materials and each having a fix end 131 fixed on the<br>
	position base 12 and a contact end 132 bended and hanging over the<br>
	circuit board 11. The contact end 132 contacts a signal point of a testee<br>
	19 to directly receive the input signal and a tested output so as to transmit<br>
25	electrical parameter measuring signals so that the testee 19 may be tested<br>
	for its effectiveness,<br>
1<br><br>
		However, the probes 13 are made of conductive material, and<br>
	spaced apart so closely that an electromagnetic interference may arise<br>
	between two abutting probes 13, or an exterior thing may fall on a gap<br>
	between two probes 13 to let the probes 13 malfunctions. Generally<br>
5	speaking, the probes 13 may wear by frequent contacts with testees 19,<br>
	and the wear may affect seriously dependability of the testing and the<br>
	service life of the test card 1. The contact end 132 of each probe 13 has<br>
	its surface 133 liable to be worn down and grown uneven, as shown in Fig.<br>
	3B, so dirt and residue 18 easily sticks to the surface 133, being hard to<br>
10	be cleaned, extremely affecting effectiveness of the testee 19, increasing<br>
	retesting percentage. Therefore, dirt and residue 18 is to be first gotten rid<br>
	of the surface 133 of the probe 13, with the surface 133 polished cleanly,<br>
	or the probe 13 cannot be used. Besides, the probe 13 may shorten<br>
	gradually after frequently polished or ground and finally become too short<br>
15	to be used and to be discarded, resulting in a substantive loss.<br>
		SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
		The purpose of the invention is to offer a treating method for<br>
	probes positioned on a test card, increasing electrical conductivity,<br>
	reducing wear and dirt and residue possible to stick on a tip and the<br>
20	surface of the shank of probes so the probes may be easily repaired and<br>
	repe ate city used, having a long service life, and at same time boosting<br>
	effectiveness of the probes.<br>
		The main feature of a treating method for probes positioned on a<br>
	test card in the invention includes the following steps:<br>
25		(1). A first step is to cover a test card and portions of probes not to<br>
	be plated, only exposing surfaces of portions of the probes to be plated,<br>
2<br><br>
		(2). A second step is to place the test card and the probes in a<br>
	plating device.<br>
		(3). A third step is to plate a conductive layer of film on the surfaces<br>
	of the uncovered portions of the probes.<br>
5		The other feature of a treating method for probes positioned on a<br>
	test card in the invention includes the following steps:<br>
		(1). A first step is to cover a test card and portions of probes not to<br>
	be plated, only exposing surfaces of portions of the probes to be plated.<br>
		(2), A second step is to place the test card and the probes in a<br>
10	plating device,<br>
		(3). A third step is to plate an insulating layer of film on the<br>
	surfaces of the uncovered portions of the probes.<br>

		DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
		A first embodiment of a treating method for probes positioned on a<br>
20	test card in the present invention, as shown in Fig. 4, indudes six steps.<br>
		Probes 2 positioned on a test card are made of tungsten or<br>
	tungsten alloy having rigidity and etectric conductivity, as shown in Fig. 5A.<br>
		The first step is to cover the test card and the surfaces of shanks<br>
	22 of the probes 2, only exposing tips 21 of the probes 2.<br>
25		The second step is to place the test card and the prob&amp;s 2 in a<br>
	plating device, and the plating device is vacuum plating cefi,<br>
4<br><br>
		The third step is to plate a conductive Layer of film 3 on the<br>
	surfaces of the uncovered tips 21 of the probes 2 for protection, as shown<br>
	in Fig. 5B.<br>
		The fourth step is to repair or grind even the surfaces of the probes<br>
5	2 being worn after the probes 2 are used, by removing the dirt and residue<br>
	31 on the surface of the film 3 and grinding or repairing, as shown In Figs,<br>
	5C and 5D.<br>
		The fifth step is to cover the test card and the shanks 22 of the<br>
	probes 2 once again, only exposing the tips 21 of the probes 2.<br>
10		The sixth step is to plate a further conductive layer of film 32 on the<br>
	tips 21 of the probes 2. for protection and reuse, as shown in Fig- 5E.<br>
		Next, a second embodiment of a treating method for probes<br>
	positioned on a test card in the present invention, as shown in Fig, 6,<br>
	includes four steps, applied to the probes on the test card used and worn<br>
15	down, as shown in Fig. 5C.<br>
		The first step is to repair or grind even the surfaces of the probes<br>
	2; first clean dirt and residue 31 remained on the surface of the layer of<br>
	film 3, and then grind or repair it smooth, as shown n Fig, 5D.<br>
		The second step is to cover the test card and portions of the<br>
20	probes 2 not to be plated, only exposing the surfaces of portions of the<br>
	probes 2 to be plated.<br>
		The third step is to place the test card and the probes 2 in a p!ating<br>
	device, and the plating device is a vacuum electric plating cell.<br>
		The fourth step is to plate a conductive layer of film 32 on the<br>
25	surfaces of the uncovered portions of the probes 2 for protection, as<br>
	shown in Fig. 5E.<br>
		The materials of the layers of film 3 and 32 are not the same<br>
5<br><br>
	according to the objects or the using conditions, say, maybe meta!, alloy,<br>
	oxide, boron compound, fluoride, nitride, silicon compound, sulfide,<br>
	tellurium compound, etc. The pfating method can be electrical<br>
	(electrolysis) such as a common electrical plating, compound electrical<br>
5	plating, alloy electrical plating, or non-electrical (non-electrolysis) such as<br>
	physical vapor deposition including vacuum spattering, vacuum vapor<br>
	deposition, or, chemical vapor deposition including atmosphere pressure<br>
	chemical vapor deposition, low pressure chemical vapor deposition,<br>
	plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, etc.<br>
10		As described above, the probes 2 with the layer of film 3 plated on<br>
	their surfaces may not wear down so quickly, and only the layer of film 3<br>
	may be worn off, and further, if the layer of film 3 is worn off, it can be<br>
	repaired or ground even and plated once again with a further layer of film<br>
	32 for reuse. If the layer of film 32 is worn off, it can be again repaired and<br>
15	plated for reuse, and so on. So the service life of the probes may be<br>
	prolonged a great deal, reducing their cost.<br>
		Moreover, common conventional probes will wear down by<br>
	frequent contact, and the bad wear may affect dependability and the<br>
	service life of the test card, but using the treating method according to the<br>
20	invention probes may be repeatedly used, prolonged in the service life for<br>
	a great extent- In addition, in spite of frequent contact with testees (objects<br>
	to be tested), the probes 2 according to the invention have conductive and<br>
	friction-enduring layers of film 3 and 32 on their surfaces, thus making the<br>
	surfaces of the probes 2 smooth to reduce the amount of material of<br>
25	testees possibly sticking to the probes 2. And the stuck material may be<br>
	easily removed so the testing effectiveness may be boosted a great deal.<br>
	Further, the probes 2 positioned on a test card are not needed to be taken<br>
6<br><br>
	down even for proceeding plating a layer of film by covering the portions<br>
	not to be plated, but exposing the portions to be plated, and then putting<br>
	the test card and the probes 2 in the plating device, convenient for treating<br>
	for plating again and again.<br>
5		Next, a third embodiment of a treating method for probes<br>
	positioned on a test card in the present invention, as shown in Figs. 7 and<br>
	8, is designed for preventing electric interference between the probes 2<br>
	and short circuit caused by exterior matters faffing on the probes 2,<br>
	including six steps to be described below.<br>
10		The first step is to cover the shanks 22 of the probes 2; only<br>
	exposing the tips 21 of the probes 2.<br>
		The second step is to place the probes 2 in a plating cell. and the<br>
	plating device is a vacuum plating cell<br>
		The third step is to plate a conductive layer of film 3 on the<br>
15	uncovered tips 21 of the probes 2.<br>
		The fourth step is to cover the plated tips 21 of the probes 2 and let<br>
	the shanks 22 of the probes 22 exposed out.<br>
		The fifth step is to place the probes 2 in a plating device again.<br>
		The sixth step is to plate an insulating and nonconductive layer of<br>
20	film 4 on the uncovered surfaces of the shanks 22 of the probes 2 for<br>
	insufating protection.<br>
		Therefore, the tips 21 of the probes 2 have a conductive layer of<br>
	film 3 conductive to electricity, and the shanks 22 of the probes 2 have an<br>
	insulating and nonconductive layer of film 4 as shown in Fig. 8. So the<br>
25	probes 2 are not susceptible to electric Interference owning to the<br>
	insulating and nonconductive layer of film 4, and is protected from causing<br>
	short circuit also owing to the insulating and nonconductive layer of film 4<br>
7<br><br>
	even if an exterior matter should fall on the probes 2. Therefore, the<br>
	probes 2 may function normally, upgrading effectiveness of testing and<br>
	lessening retesting necessity.<br>
		The invention has the following advantages, as can be understood<br>
5	from the foresaid description.<br>
		1. The probes have anti-wear property owing to a layer of fiim<br>
	functioning as a protective means for reducing wear and tear.<br>
		2. The surface treatment of the probes can increase electric<br>
	conductivity and reduce possibility of sticking of residue or dirt on the<br>
10	surface of the probes, with stuck residue or dirt easily removable.<br>
		3. The layer of film plated on the surfaces of the probes is possible<br>
	to be repaired and plated once again for reuse, largely cutting possibility of<br>
	wearing-down of the probes, prolonging its service Ufe.<br>
		4. The probes positioned on a test card can be plated without<br>
15	taken off the test card, not needing covering the portions not to be plated,<br>
	but only exposing the portions to be piated in a plating device for plating,<br>
	facilitating plating process repeatedly.<br>
		White the preferred embodiments of the invention have been<br>
	described abover it will be recognized and understood that various<br>
20	rnodifications may be made therein and the appended ciaims are intended<br>
	to cover all such modifications that may fall within the spirit and scope of<br>
	the invention.<br>
