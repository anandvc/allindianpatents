				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>A PROCESS FOR PRODUCING A LIGHT METAL FOAM BODY<br>
The invention pertains to a process for manufacturing a metal foam body, whereby a gas-<br>
containing fused metal is produced and the fused metal is allowed to coagulate under<br>
formation of a metal foam body.<br>
Porous objects are referred to as metal foam bodies, in which gas-filled pores are embedded in<br>
a fixed matrix, which is made of metal or at least has a prominently large share by weight of<br>
metal. The embedded pores are generally shaped spherical and/or ellipsoidal and are<br>
separated from one another by walls of matrix material. Depending on the production, metal<br>
foam bodies can be designed in the region of the outer surface primarily compact or pore-free.<br>
In such a case, in a metal foam body a porous inner part is surrounded at least partly by a<br>
dense outer layer or a dense skin.<br>
On account of process-technically achievable high porosity and a low density, properties<br>
which are advantageous for many applications, e.g. good sound absorption, relatively low<br>
heat conductivity as compared to dense matrix material or high deformation capacity in case<br>
of impact, metal foam bodies can have a wide spectrum of possible applications as light-<br>
weight functional components.<br>
In order to completely exploit this potential application spectrum, it is desirable from the<br>
economic and technological point of view to be able to manufacture moulds of metal foam<br>
having high quality, as well as which could be manufactured in a simple and cost-effective<br>
manner. The main quality criteria are mould-density, number, shape, size of the pores and<br>
distribution of these in the mould, as well as in case of design of the metal foam body with a<br>
dense or pore-free outer layer, a surface quality of the outer surface.<br>
As a result of the well known high application potential of metal foam bodies, already<br>
significant efforts have been undertaken to present a process for its manufacture, which would<br>
fulfil the mentioned desired expectations.<br>
According to the state-of-the-art technology, presently several categories of processes are in<br>
use.<br>
Firstly, it has already been suggested to manufacture cellular metal bodies having pores by<br>
coating objects, e.g. by means of electro-chemical process. More precisely, with such a<br>
processes compound bodies are produced, which consist of dense substrate parts, which serve<br>
as coating base, and porous metal parts separated from these substrate portions. The<br>
disadvantage of this process is that, with coating technologies basically only small layer<br>
thicknesses can be achieved and hence an attainable volume of separated porous metal is<br>
limited. Also, in case of these compound bodies there could be adhesion problems of the type<br>
that during usage the separated metal foam parts get easily peeled off from the substrate<br>
portions.<br>
Secondly, powder-metallurgical processes have been suggested, e.g. in the US 3, 087, 807 or<br>
DE 4 018 360 Cl. In processes of this type, a metal powder is mixed with a blowing agent<br>
powder and the mixed powder material is made compact through pressing or deformation.<br>
Thereafter the compact material is heated till the point of splitting gas from the blowing agent<br>
which could thus form pores in the previously compacted material. With the help of such<br>
powder-metallurgical processes, metal foam bodies of high quality can be produced.<br>
However, these processes are complex with respect to the material used and the required<br>
devices, because a manufacture and the use of at least two powder components is necessary.<br>
The individual powder components also have to be internally mixed before heating and the<br>
powder grains must be welded with one another, e.g. by heat-isostatic pressing, in order to<br>
achieve pores with homogeneous distribution in the metal foam body.<br>
Thirdly, fused-metal processes are known. In these processes, a foamable fused metal is<br>
produced and then a gas is introduced into the fused metal, whereby fluid metal foam is<br>
generated, which collects on the fused surface. The metal foam present on the fused surface<br>
can, as published in EP 666 784 B, on account of its flow-capability be processed by careful<br>
pressing to moulds, retaining the porous structure. The disadvantage of such a fused-metal<br>
process is, that a fused metal cannot be foamed in its pure condition. For the purpose of<br>
achieving foamability, before conducting the foaming the molten material must be displaced<br>
with a viscosity-increasing agent, e.g. an inert gas (GB 1, 287, 994), or with ceramic particles<br>
(EP 0 666 784 B). As already mentioned, the metal foam collected on the fused surface is<br>
flow-capable. This is favourable for a mould processing of the metal foam; however, as a<br>
result of lacking stabilization of the metal walls, this could lead to particle collapse of the<br>
foamed metal foam and hence to an uncontrollable formation of dense zones in the interior of<br>
an object thus produced.<br>
With respect to fuse-metallurgical processes, also processes have been suggested which could<br>
be conducted without viscosity-enhancing additives. Thus it is known that in a metal fuse<br>
under high pressure and high temperatures hydrogen can be released, which on account of a<br>
solubility jump during coagulation of the fuse could get released under formation of bubbles.<br>
The bubbles can be locked in during coagulation of the fuse, whereby a porous metal object<br>
gets formed. With the help of such processes dense metallic starting materials can be<br>
immediately converted into bodies having pores, for which however significant complicated<br>
apparatus machinery is necessary. Particularly for introducing hydrogen into a melt<br>
autoclaves are required which can withstand high pressure and temperatures. Furthermore,<br>
use of hydrogen at high pressures and temperatures of at least a few hundred degrees bring<br>
about a significant safety risk for the operating personnel. Moreover, a portion of the formed<br>
bubbles or the released gas could exit during coagulation of a fuse, so that locking of the<br>
released gas does not take place in the melt and as a result the porosity of the object produced<br>
with this method is low.<br>
This is where the invention comes in and has the objective of presenting a generic process,<br>
with which metal foam bodies of high quality with low apparatus complexity and reduced<br>
safety risk of the operating personnel can be manufactured.<br>
This objective is achieved, in that in a process of the type mentioned above, introduced<br>
material under atmospheric pressure is melted and thereby and/or thereafter gas is introduced<br>
into the fluid, whereby the fluid metal is brought into a shape and is allowed to coagulate at<br>
reduced surrounding pressure at least for a period of time.<br>
The advantages of the invention lie therein, that metal foam bodies of high porosity can be<br>
produced with less complexity of apparatuses and in a surprisingly simple manner. It has<br>
been seen that on fusing an introduced material under atmospheric pressure in an open<br>
melting crucible without overpressure devices and a simultaneous and/or subsequent<br>
introduction of gas into the fluid phase of the introduced material can result in a sufficient gas<br>
load of the melt, in order to effect the formation of a metal foam body of low density during<br>
coagulation of the same. This effect can be utilised as per the invention for producing a metal<br>
foam body of desired shape in a beneficial manner, if the fluid metal is first brought into a<br>
shape and then allowed to coagulate under at least time-wise reduced surrounding pressure.<br>
Due to a hardening the melt at reduced surrounding pressure one gets a formation of several<br>
gas bubbles in the melt, which however on account of the setting and continuing coagulation<br>
of the melt get locked in it, as a result of which the metal foam bodies as per the invention<br>
have a low density.<br>
Furthermore, a process as per the invention has the advantage of a higher safety for the<br>
operating personnel, as use of gases at high pressures and high temperatures can be avoided<br>
till the conducting of a process as per the invention.<br>
It has proved to be particularly advantageous in the case of the process as per the invention, if<br>
at least parts of the introduced material is converted into at least one compound before fusing,<br>
which would give out in the region of and/or over the fusing interval of the same at least one<br>
gas which is soluble in fluid metal. As through this measure the pore-forming components, a<br>
gas, can already be made available before fusing of an introduced material in the form of a<br>
gas-emitting compound, one can totally do away with device agents for introducing the gas<br>
into a fuse. It is also advantageous that a conversion can take place at temperatures which are<br>
significantly below the melting temperature of the metal. In this way, a gas can be introduced<br>
in bound form at low temperatures and hence in effect also save energy. In order to<br>
subsequently introduce a gas into a fuse, only a brief heating of pre-treated introduction<br>
material has to be carried out up to a disintegration temperature of a gas-emitting or gas-<br>
splitting compound, whereby the dwell time in a furnace can be reduced and the material<br>
throughput can be increased.<br>
In a process as per the invention, a conversion of at least parts of the introduced material can<br>
take place before fusing in at least one compound, which in the region of and/or over the<br>
fusing interval of the same emits at least one gas which is soluble in fluid metal; in a preferred<br>
extension this takes place through contact with a gas or gas mixtures. It is advantageous that<br>
the extent of a conversion of the introduced material in the zones near the surface and hence a<br>
quantity of the gas(es) introduced during fusing can be controlled by means of the fed gas<br>
charge and the treatment duration can be precisely controlled.<br>
In a process as per the invention a conversion of at least parts of the introduced material into<br>
at least one compound which would emit gas soluble in the fluid metal in the region of and/or<br>
over the melting interval of the same can be conducted, in that a contact takes place with an<br>
aerosol. This is particularly advantageous if the reaction of an introduced material with a<br>
fluid as reaction partner would take place with great heat release. With the help of an aerosol,<br>
on the one hand, a reaction partner with a carrier gas can be thinned and fed in a fluid state<br>
and a high local heating of an introduced material during conversion can be avoided. On the<br>
other hand, the carrier gas effects a heat discharge or a cooling of the treated material.<br>
In a process as per the invention, with respect to a conversion of at least parts of the<br>
introduced material before fusing into at least one compound which emits a gas soluble in the<br>
fluid metal in the region of and/or over the melting interval of the same, it can be further<br>
foreseen that the compound emits gas(es) at a temperature of max. 250°C, preferably max.<br>
150°C, above the melting or coagulating temperature of the metal. This has the advantage<br>
that an overheating of the metal for the purpose of emitting gas(es) from the compound and<br>
the energy consumption involved in the process for manufacturing a metal foam body can be<br>
kept as low as possible.<br>
Moulds made of metal foam of high quality can be produced in a particularly simple manner,<br>
if the introduced material is formed from a light metal, especially magnesium or a magnesium<br>
alloy, because these metals have very good dissolving properties for gases. Hence, with the<br>
introduction of light metals in a process as per the invention one can achieve a high porosity<br>
of rrietal foam bodies.<br>
Maximum porosity of the produced metal foam bodies can be achieved with simple devices, if<br>
in a process as per the invention the coagulation of the fluid metal takes place at a surrounding<br>
pressure in the region of 0.03 bar to 0.2 bar. Surrounding pressures in this selected range are<br>
process-technically simple and can be precisely set and can be produced with the simplest<br>
devices, e.g. with so called water jet pumps.<br>
In a further advantageous variant of the process as per the invention, before introducing the<br>
fluid metal the mould is pre-heated. Through this measure one can achieve that a metal foam<br>
body with an at least largely dense outer layer gets formed, whereby simultaneously cracks on<br>
or in the dense outer layer or surface layer, which could appear in case of a shock, can be kept<br>
minimum.<br>
If in a process as per the invention a heat-insulated mould is used, then the density of the<br>
produced metal foam bodies can be significantly reduced. The reason for this effect is<br>
presently not clear. According to expert opinion a possibly effective discharge of the released<br>
coagulation heat of the fused mass and subsequently rapid cooling should be the objective in<br>
order to retain a gas introduced into a fuse on coagulation of the same, or prevent an exit from<br>
the same.<br>
Contrary to this opinion it has however been found now that in a process as per the invention<br>
use of a heat-insulated mould, whereby a heat discharge and hence a cooling gets delayed,<br>
leads to metal foam bodies with significantly lower density.<br>
The invention is explained below on the basis of examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
Blocks of alloy AZ 91 were produced, which is a magnesium alloy with approx. 9 percent by<br>
weight of aluminium and approx. 1 percent of by weight of zinc and the rest magnesium.<br>
Thereafter, the produced material was stored for several days in open air and thereby<br>
subjected to moist air and rain.<br>
After a storage the blocks were melted in melting crucibles under atmospheric pressure,<br>
whereby an atmosphere consisted of 1 vol.- % SF6 and 99 vol.-%argon. A fused metal was<br>
heated to 685°C; then approx. 70 gms of this fused metal was filled into a crucible pre-heated<br>
to a temperature of 300°C. Subsequently the filled crucible was brought into an under-<br>
pressure chamber, the chamber was closed and immediately thereafter an under-pressure of 80<br>
millibar was generated in the chamber. This under-pressure was retained for seven minutes,<br>
after which the chamber was ventilated and opened and the crucible was removed.<br>
In the crucible a porous metal foam body having pores in its interior got formed with a density<br>
of approx. 0.95 gm/cm3. An external surface of the body was mainly dense and formed<br>
without cracks. On cross-sectional observation of the foam body after cutting up the same, it<br>
was seen that the formed pores had a diameter of approx. 1 to 4 mm. and were uniformly<br>
distributed over the cross-sectional area. A dense outer layer or skin was approx. 1 mm.<br>
thick.<br>
Example 2<br>
In another experiment one proceeded analogous to example 1, whereby a heat-insulated<br>
crucible was used. One obtained a metal foam body with a mainly dense and crack-free<br>
surface. The pores structure corresponded to what was described in example 1. Compared to<br>
a metal foam body produced in a crucible which was not heat-insulated, as described in<br>
example 1, it could be determined here that the density of the metal foam body was<br>
significantly lower at approx. 0.75 gm/cm3.<br>
Example 3<br>
The experiments mentioned in example 1 and 2 were repeated with commercial magnesium<br>
scrap parts of the type AZ 91. One achieved analogous results to example 1 or example 2.<br>
Consequently, with the process as per the invention there is also a possibility of converting<br>
recycling material into high-value functional components in a simple manner.<br>
In further experiments with recycling material one could obtain particularly advantageous<br>
results with respect to low foam body density and pore formation with die-casting scrap of<br>
magnesium alloys as introducing material. Thereby, experiments conducted process-<br>
technically analogous to example 1 and example 2, yielded magnesium foam bodies with<br>
densities of 0.85 gms/cm3 and 0.65 gms/cm3. This is on account of the fact that during die-<br>
casting process, gas is introduced into the cast metal and hence die-cast parts are always<br>
porous. Now, if die-cast scrap is used in a process as per the invention, then gas can be<br>
introduced not only through disintegration of the compounds present on the surface but also<br>
through the pores or bubbles present in the introduced material. Thus one gets a double gas<br>
introduction. This is confirmed by experiments with sand-blasted die-cast scrap, which<br>
resulted in higher density in metal foam bodies.<br>
