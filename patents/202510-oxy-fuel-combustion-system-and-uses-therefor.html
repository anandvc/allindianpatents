AN OXYGEN FUELED COMBUSTION SYSTEM AND A COMBUSTION<br>
METHOD<br>
This invention relates to an oxygen fueled combustion system and a combustion method.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	The present invention pertains to an oxygen fueled combustion<br>
system. More particularly, the present invention pertains to an oxy-fueled combustion system in which the production of green-house gases is reduced and in which fossil fuel consumption is reduced.<br>
[0002]	Oxygen fueled burner systems are known, however, their use is<br>
quite limited. Oxy-fueled burner systems are generally only used in those<br>
applications in which extremely high flame temperatures are required. For<br>
example, these system may be used in the glass making industry in order to<br>
achieve the temperatures necessary to melt silica to a fusion temperature.<br>
Otherwise, it is commonly accepted that structural and material limitations dictate<br>
the upper temperatures to which may industrial systems can be subjected. To<br>
this end, air fueled or air fired combustion systems are used in boilers, furnaces<br>
and the like throughout most every industrial application including manufacturing,<br>
electric power generating and other process applications.<br>
[0003]	In particular, air fueled combustion systems or electric heating<br>
systems are used throughout the steel and aluminium making industries, as well as the power generation industry, and other industries that rely upon carbon based<br>
1<br><br>
WO 02/088400	PCT/US02/08701<br>
fuels. In air fueled systems, air which is comprised of about 79% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, is fed, along with fuel into a furnace. The air fuel mixture is ignited creating a continuous flame. The flame transfers energy in the form of heat from the fuel air mixture into the furnace.<br>
[0004]	In the steel and aluminium industries, air fueled furnaces and<br>
electric furnaces have been used as the primary heat source for creating molten metals. With respect to air fueled furnaces, it is conventionally accepted that the energy requirements, balanced against the thermal limitations of the process equipment, mandate or strongly support the use of these types of combustion systems. As to the use of electric furnaces in the aluminium industry, again, conventional wisdom supports this type of energy source to achieve the temperatures necessary for aluminium processing.<br>
1A<br><br>
WO 02/088400	PCT/US02/08701<br>
[0005]	One drawback 10 the use of air fueled combustion systems, is<br>
that these systems produce NOx and other green-house gases such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and the like, as an inherent result of the combustion process. NOx and other green-house gases are a large contributor to environmental pollution, including, but not limited to acid rain. As such, the reduction in emission of NOx and other green-house gases is desirable, and as a result of regulatory restrictions, emission is greatly limited. To this end, various devices must be installed on these combustion systems in order to limit and/or reduce the levels of NOx and other green-house gases produced.<br>
[0006]	Another drawback with respect to air fueled furnaces is that<br>
much of the energy released from the combustion process is absorbed or used to heat the gaseous nitrogen present in the air that is fed to the furnace. This energy is essentially wasted in that the heated nitrogen gas is typically, merely exhausted from the heat source, e.g., furnace. To this end, much of the energy costs are directed into the environment, through an off-gas stack or the like. Other drawbacks of the air fed combustion systems known will be recogruzed by skilled artisans.<br>
[0007]	Electric furnaces likewise have their drawbacks. For example,<br>
inherent in these systems as well is the need for a source of electricity that is available on a continuous basis, essentially without interruption. In that large amounts of electric power are required to operate electric furnaces, it is typically necessary to have these electric furnaces located in proximity to electric generating plants and/or large electrical transmission services. In addition, electric furnaces require a considerable amount of maintenance to assure that the furnaces are operated at or near optimum efficiency. Moreover, inherent in the use of electric furnaces is the inefficiency of converting a fuel into electrical power (most large fossil fueled power stations that use steam turbines operate at efficiencies of less than about 40 percent, and generally less than about 30 percent). In addition, these large fossil fueled stations produce extremely large quantities of NOx and other green-house gases.<br>
[0008]	For example, in the aluminum processing industry, and more<br>
specifically in the aluminum scrap recovery industry, conventional wisdom is that flame temperatures in furnaces should be maintained between about 2500째F and 3000째F. This range is thought to achieve a balance between the energy necessary for providing sufficient heat for melting the scrap aluminum, and maintaining adequate metal temperatures in the molten bath at about 1450째F. Known furnaces utilize a<br>
2<br><br>
WO 02/098400	PCT/US02/08701<br>
design in which flame temperatures typically do not exceed 3000째F to assure maintaining the structural integrity of these furnaces. That is, it is thought that exceeding these temperature limits can weaken the support structure of the furnace thus, possibly resulting in catastrophic accidents. In addition, stack temperatures for conventional furnaces are generally about I600째F. Thus, the temperature differential between the flame and the exhaust is only about 140Q째F. This results in inefficient energy usage for the combustion process.<br>
[0009]	It is also believed that heat losses and potential damage to<br>
equipment from furnaces in which flame temperatures exceed about 3000째F far outweigh any operating efficiency that may be achieved by higher flame temperatures. Thus, again conventional wisdom fully supports the use of air fueled furnaces in which flame temperatures are at an upper limit of about 3000째F (by flame stoichiometry) which assures furnace integrity and reduces energy losses.<br>
[0010]	Accordingly, there-exists a need for a combustion system that<br>
provides the advantages of reducing environmental pollution (attributable to NOx and other green-house gases) while at the same time providing efficient energy use. Desirably, such a combustion system can be used in a wide variety of industrial applications, ranging from the power generating/utility industry to chemical processing industries, metal production and processing and the like. Such a combustion system can be used in metal, e.g., aluminum, processing applications in which the combustion system provides increased energy efficiency and pollution reduction. There also exists a need, specifically in the scrap aluminum processing industry for process equipment (specifically furnaces) that are designed and configured to withstand elevated flame temperatures associated with such an efficient combustion system and to increase energy efficiency and reduce pollution production.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0011]	. An oxygen fueled combustion system includes a furnace having<br>
a controlled environment, and includes at least one burner. The combustion system includes an oxygen supply for supplying oxygen having a predetermined purity and a carbon based fuel supply for supplying a carbon based fuel. The present oxy fuel combustion system increases the efficiency of fuel consumed (i.e., requires less fuel), produces zero NOx (other than from fuel-bome sources) and significantly less other green-house gases.<br>
3<br><br>
WO 02/088400	PCT/US02/08701<br><br><br>
[0012]	The oxygen and the carbon based fuel are fed into the furnace<br>
in a stoichiometric proportion to one another to limit an excess of either the oxygen or the carbon based fuel to less than 5 percent over the stoichiometric proportion. The combustion of the carbon based fuel provides a flame temperature in excess of about 4500째F, and an exhaust gas stream from the furnace having a temperature of not more than about 1100째F.<br>
[0013]	The combustion system preferably includes a control system<br>
for controlling the supply of carbon based fuel and for controlling the supply of oxygen to the furnace. In the control system, the supply of fuel follows the supply of oxygen to the furnace. The supply of oxygen and fuel is controlled by the predetermined molten aluminum temperature. In this arrangement, a sensor senses the temperature of the molten aluminum.<br>
[0014]	The carbon based fuel can be any type of fuel. In one<br>
embodiment, the fuel is a gas, such as natural gas, methane and the like. Alternately, the fuel is a solidjiiel, such as coal or coal dust Alternately still, the fuel is a liquid fuel, such a fuel oil, including waste oils.<br>
[0015]	In one exemplary use, the combustion system is used in a scrap<br>
aluminum recovery system for recovering aluminum from scrap. Such a system includes a furnace for containing molten aluminum at a predetermined temperature, that has at least one burner. The recovery system includes an oxygen supply for-supplying oxygen to the furnace through the combustion system. To achieve<br>
maximum efficiency, the oxygen supply has an oxygen purity of at least about 85 percent.<br>
[0016]	A carbon based fuel supply supplies a carbon based fuel. The<br>
oxygen and the carbon based fuel are fed into the furnace in a stoichiometric proportion to one another to limit an excess of either the oxygen or the carbon based fuel to less than 5 percent over the stoichiometric proportion. The combustion of the carbon based fuel provides a flame temperature in excess of about 4500째F, and an exhaust gas stream from the furnace having a temperature of not more than about 1100째F.<br>
[0017]	In such a recovery system, the combustion of oxygen and fuel<br>
creates energy that is used for recovering aluminum from the scrap at a rate of about 1083 BTU per pound of aluminum recovered. The fuel can be a gas, such as natural gas, or it can be a solid fuel or a liquid fuel.<br>
4<br><br>
WO 02/088400	PCT/US02/08701<br>
[0018]	In the recovery system, heat from the furnace can be recovered<br>
in a waste heat recovery system. The recovered heat can be converted to electrical energy.<br>
[0019]	In a most preferred system, the combustion system includes a<br>
system for providing oxygen. One such system separates air into oxygen and nitrogen, such as a cryogenic separation system. Other systems include membrane separation and the like. Oxygen can also be provided by the separation of water into oxygen and hydrogen. In such systems, the oxygen can be stored for use as needed. Other systems are known for oxygen generation/separation.<br>
[0020]	The oxygen fueled combustion system, generally, can be used<br>
with any furnace that has a controlled environment. That is, with any furnace that has substantially no in-Ieakage from an external environment. Such a combustion system includes an oxygen supply for supplying oxygen having a predetermined purity and a carbon based fuel supply for supplying a carbon based fuel.<br>
[0021]	The oxygen in the oxygen supply and the carbon based fuel are<br>
fed into the furnace in a stoichiometric proportion to one another to limit an excess of either the oxygen or the carbon based fuel to less than 5 percent over the stoichiometric proportion. In such a furnace, an exhaust gas stream from the furnace has substantially zero nitrogen-containing combustion produced gaseous compounds. That is, because there is no nitrogen fed in with the fuel, unless there is fuel-bome nitrogen, the exhaust gas contains substantially no nitrogen containing combustion products (i.e., NOx), and significantly lowered levels of other green-house gases.<br>
[0022]	This combustion system can use any carbon based fuel<br>
including gas, such as natural gas or methane, any solid fuel such as coal or coal dust or any liquid fuel, such as oil, including waste and refined oils. In such a combustion system, any nitrogen-containing combustion produced gaseous compounds are formed from the fuel-borne nitrogen.<br>
[0023]	A method for recovering aluminum from scrap includes feeding<br>
aluminum scrap into a melting furnace and combusting oxygen and a carbon based fuel in the furnace. In the combustion of the oxygen and fuel, the oxygen and fuel are fed into the furnace in a stoichiometric proportion to one another to limit an excess of either the oxygen or the carbon based fuel to less than 5 percent over the stoichiometric proportion. The combustion provides a flame temperature in excess of<br>
5<br><br>
WO 02/088400	PCT/US02/08701<br>
about 4500째F, and an exhaust gas stream from the furnace having a temperature of not more than about 1100째F.<br>
[0024]	The aluminum is melted in the furnace, contaminant laden<br>
aluminum is removed from the furnace and substantially pure molten aluminum is discharged from the furnace. The method can include the step of recovering aluminum from the contaminant laden aluminum, i.e., dross, and charging the recovered aluminum into the furnace.<br>
[0025]	The method can include recovering waste heat from the<br>
furnace. The waste heat recovered can be converted to electricity.<br>
[0026]	A furnace for recovering aluminum from scrap aluminum<br>
includes a bath region for containing molten aluminum at a predetermined temperature, and at least one burner. An oxygen supply supplies oxygen having a purity of at least about 85 percent and a carbon based fuel supply supplies fuel, such as natural gas, coal, oil and the like.<br>
[0027J	The oxygen in the oxygen supply and the fuel are fed into the<br>
furnace in a stoichiometric proportion to one another to limit an excess of either the oxygen or the fuel to less than 5 percent over the stoichiometric proportion. The combustion of the fuel provides a flame temperature in excess of about 4500째F, and an exhaust gas stream from the furnace has a temperature of not more than about 1100째F,<br>
[0028]	In one embodiment, the furnace is formed from steel plate, steel<br>
beams and refractory materials. The furnace walls are configured having a steel beam<br>
and plate shell, at least one layer of a crushable insulating material, at least one layer<br>
of a refractory brick, and at least one layer of a castable refractory material. The<br>
furnace floor is configured having a steel beam and plate shell and at least two layers<br>
of refractory material, at least one of the layers being a castable refractory material.<br>
[0029]	; A salt-less method for separating aluminum from dross-laden<br>
aluminum is also disclosed that includes the steps of introducing the dross-laden aluminum into a furnace. The furnace has an oxygen fuel combustion system producing a flame temperature of about 5000째F, and having substantially no excess oxygen. The dross-laden aluminum melts within the furnace.<br>
[0030]	An upper portion of the melted dross-laden aluminum is   짝<br>
skimmed to produce a heavily dross-laden product. The heavily dross-laden product is pressed in a mechanical press to separate the aluminum from the heavily dross-<br>
6<br><br>
WO 02/088400	PCT/USO2/087GS<br>
laden product to produce a concentrated heavily dross-laden product. The method can include the step of returning ihe concentrated heavily dross~!aden product to the fiirnace. Introduction of the dross-laden aluminum into the furnace is carried out in near direct flame impingement to release the oxides from the dross.<br>
[0031]	These and other features and advantages of the present<br>
invention will be apparent from the following detailed description, in conjunction with the appended claims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0045]	While the present invention is susceptible of embodiment in<br>
various forms, there is shown in the drawings and will hereinafter be described a presently preferred embodiment with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered an exemplification of the invention and is not intended to limit the invention to the specific embodiment illustrated. It should be further understood that the title of this section of this specification, namely, "Detailed Description Of The Invention", relates to a requirement of the United States Patent Office, and does not imply, nor should be inferred to limit the subject matter disclosed herein.<br>
[0046]	An oxy-fuel combustion system uses essentially pure oxygen,<br>
in combination with a fuel source to produce heat, by flame production (i.e., combustion), in an efficient, environmentally non-adverse manner. Oxygen, which is supplied by an oxidizing agent, in concentrations of about 85 percent to about 99+ percent can be used, however, it is preferable to have oxygen concentration (i.e., oxygen supply purity) as high as possible. In such a system, high-purity oxygen is fed, along with the fuel source in stoichiometric proportions, into a burner in a furnace. The oxygen and fuel is ignited to release the energy stored in the fuel. For purposes of the present disclosure, reference to furnace is to be broadly interpreted to include any industrial or commercial heat generator that combusts fossil (carbon-based) fuels. In a preferred system, oxygen concentration or purity is as high as practicable to reduce green-house gas production.<br>
[0047]	It is contemplated that essentially any fuel source can be used.<br>
For example, in a present application, as will be described in more detail below, oxygen is fed along with natural gas, for combustion in a furnace. Other fuel sources<br>
8<br><br>
WO 02/088400	PCT/US02/0870]<br>
contemplated include oils including refined as well as waste oils, wood, coal, coal dust, refuse (garbage waste) and the like. Those skilled in the art will recognize the myriad fuel sources that can be used with the present oxy-ftiel system.<br>
[0048]	The present system departs from conventional processes in two<br>
principal areas. First, conventional combustion processes use air (as an oxidizing agent to supply oxygen), rather than essentially pure oxygen, for combustion. The oxygen component of air (about 21 percent) is used in combustion while the remaining components (essentially nitrogen) are heated in and exhausted from the furnace. Second, the present process uses oxygen in a stoichiometric proportion to the fuel. That is, only enough oxygen is fed in proportion to the fuel to assure complete combustion of the fuel. Thus, no "excess" oxygen is fed into the combustion system.<br>
[0049]	Many advantages and benefits are achieved using the present<br>
combustion system. It has been observed, as will be described below, that fuel consumption, to produce an equivalent amount of power or heat is reduced, in certain applications, by as much as 70 percent. Significantly, this can provide for a tremendous reduction in the amount of pollution that results. Again, in certain applications, the emission of NOx can be reduced to essentially zero, and the emission of other green-house gases reduced by as much as about 70 percent over conventional air-fueled combustion systems.<br>
An Exemplary Scrap Aluminum Recovery Process<br>
[0050]	In one specific use, the oxygen fueled combustion system (also<br>
referred to as oxy-fuel or oxy-fueled) is used in a scrap aluminum recovery plant 10. A flow process for an exemplary plant is illustrated in FIGS. 1 -2. Scrap aluminum, generally indicated at 12 is fed into a melting furnace 14, and is liquefied. The plant 10 can include multiple furnaces operated in parallel 14, one of which is illustrated. The liquefied or molten aluminum is drawn from the melting furnace 14 and is fed into a smaller holding furnace or holder 16. The holding furnace 16 is also an oxy-fueled furnace. The molten aluminum is drawn from the melting furnace 14 as necessary, to maintain a certain, predetermined level in the holding furnace 16. This can result in continuously drawing down from the melting furnace 14 or drawing down in "batches" as required.<br>
9<br><br>
WO 02/088400	PCT/US02/08701<br>
[0051]	In the holding furnace 16, chlorine and nitrogen (as gas), as<br>
indicated at 18 and 20, respectively, are fed into the holding furnace 16 to facilitate drawing the impurities from the molten aluminum. The chlorine and nitrogen function as a gaseous fluxing agent to draw the impurities from the aluminum. This can also be carried out in the melting furnaces 14 to increase cleaning of oily and dirty scrap. Other contemplated fluxing agents include gaseous argon hexafluoride. The holder 16 is actively heated and operates at a molten metal temperature of about 1300째F. The air temperature in the holder 16 is slightly higher.<br>
[0052]	The molten aluminum is then filtered. Presently, a bag-type<br>
paniculate filter 22 is used. However, other types of filters are known and can be used. The filtered, molten aluminum is then fed through a degasser 24.<br>
[0053]	In the degasser 24, a fluxing agent, such as an inert gas (again,<br>
nitrogen is used, as indicated at 26) is fed into the molten aluminum. The molten aluminum is agitated, such as by a mechanical stirrer 28 and the fluxing agent 26 bubbles up through the molten aluminum to draw impurities (e.g., oxides) from the aluminum.<br>
[0054]	The molten aluminum is then fed into an in-line caster 30- In<br>
the caster 30, the aluminum is cast into continuous plate. The cast thickness can be any where from .010 inches up to .750 inches or more. The aluminum can then be rolled into a coil, as indicated at 32, for use or further processing. In a present method, the aluminum proceeds from the caster 30 through a pair of hot milling machines 34 where the plate is milled to a final thickness or gauge, presently about 0.082 inches (82 mils) and is then rolled to form the coil 32. Those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate the various end forming and finishing processes that can be carried out on the metal. All such forming and finishing processes are within the scope and spirit of the present invention.<br>
[0055]	Returning to the melting furnace 14, as stated above, it is an<br>
oxy-fuel furnace. It is fed with a carbon based fuel, such as natural gas, in stoichiometric proportion with oxygen. This is unlike known furnaces which use fuel and air mixtures. The fuel/air mixtures feed nitrogen as well as oxygen into the furnace to support the combustion process. This results in the production of undesirable NOx off-gases. In addition, the nitrogen also absorbs energy from the molten aluminum, thus reducing the overall efficiency of the process. That is,<br>
10<br><br>
WO 02/088400	PCT/USO2/O87O1<br>
because the percentage of nitrogen in air is so great, a large amount of energy goes into heating the nitrogen rather than the aJuminum.<br>
[0056]	The oxygen/naturaJ gas proportions in the present melting and<br>
holding furnaces 14, ]6 are about 2.36:1. This ratio will vary depending upon the purity of the oxygen supply and the nature of the fuel. For example, under perfect conditions of 100 percent pure oxygen, the ratio is theoretically calculated to be 2.056:1. However, the oxygen supply can have up to about 15 percent non-oxygen constituents and natural gas is not always 100 percent pure. As such, those skilled in the art will appreciate and understand that the ratios may vary slightly, but the basis for calculating the ratios, that is stoichiometric proportions of fuel and oxygen, remains true.<br>
[0057]	This proportion of oxygen to fuel provides a number of<br>
advantages. First, this stoichiometry provides complete combustion of the fuel, thus resulting in less carbon monoxide, NOx and other noxious off-gas emissions (other green-house gases generally). In addition, the controlled oxygen proportions also reduce the amount of oxides present in the molten aluminum. This, in rum, provides a higher quality final aluminum product, and less processing to remove these undesirable oxide contaminants.<br>
[0058}	It is important to note that accurately controlling the ratio of<br>
oxygen to fuel assures complete bum of the fuel. This is in stark contrast to, for example, fossil fiieied power plants (e.g., utility power plants), that struggle with LOI (loss on ignition). Essentially, LOI equates to an incomplete burn of the fuel. In the present method, on the other hand, substantially pure oxygen, in tightly controlled' stoichiometric proportion to the fuel, minimizes and possibly eliminates these losses. In addition, in the present method, the only theoretical NOx available is from fuel-bome NOx, rather than that which could otherwise result from combustion using air. Thus, NOx, if not completely eliminated is reduced to an insignificant amount compared to conventional combustion systems.<br>
[0059]	Oxides in aJuminum come from two major sources. First, from<br>
the combustion process; second, from oxides that reside in the aJuminum. This is particularly so with poor grade scrap or primary metal. The present process takes into consideration both of these sources of oxides and reduces or eliminates their impact on the final aluminum product.   First, the present process reduces oxides that could form as a result of the oxygen fed for the combustion of the fuel. This is achieved by<br>
il<br><br>
WO 02/088400	PCT/US 02/08 701<br>
tightly controlling oxygen feed to only that necessary by stoichiometric proportion for complete combustion of the fuel.<br>
[0060]	The present process takes into consideration the second sources<br>
of oxides (that residing in the aluminum), and removes these oxides by virtue of the degassing and filtering processes. The benefits are two fold. The first is that less byproduct in the form of dross D is formed; second, the quality of the finished product is greatly enhanced.<br>
[0061J	It has also been found that using a fiiel/oxygen mixture (again,<br>
rather than a fuel/air mixture) results in higher flame temperatures in the melting furnace. Using oxy-fuel, flame temperatures in the furnace of about 5000째F are achieved. This is higher, by about 1500째F to 2000째F, than other, known furnaces. It has also been observed that using oxy-fuel, in conjunction with these higher flame temperatures, results in an extremely highly efficient process. In one measure of efficiency, the energy required (in BTU) per pound of processed aluminum is measured. In a known process, the energy required is about 3620 BTU/lb of processed product. In the present process and apparatus, the energy requirements are considerably less, about 1083 BTU/lb of metal processed. It should also be noted that although the "fuel" discussed above in reference to the present method is natural gas, any organic based fuel, such as oil (including waste oil), coal, coal dust and the like can be used.<br>
[0062]	For purposes of understanding the thermodynamics of the<br>
process, the theoretical energy required to melt a pound of aluminum is 504 BTUs. However, because specific process inefficiencies are inherent, the actual energy required was found to be about 3620 BTU/lb when using an air fired combustion system. These inefficiencies include, for example, actual processing periods being less than the actual time that the furnace is "fired", and other downstream process changes, such as caster width increases or decreases. In addition, other "losses" such as stack (heat) losses, and heat losses through the furnace walls, add to this energy difference.<br>
(0063]	Moreover, the value of 1083 BTU/lb is an average energy<br>
requirement, even taking into account these "losses". It has been found that when the process is running at a high efficiency rate, that is when aluminum is processed almost continuously, rather than keeping the furnace "fired" without processing, the "average" energy requirement can be reduced to about 750BTU/lb to 900BTU/lb.<br>

The Melting Furnace<br>
\0&amp;64)	A present melting furnace 14 is constructed primarily of steel<br>
and refractory materials. Referring to FIGS. 5-9, the furnace shell 42 has outside dimensions of about 20 feet in width by 40 feet in length by 12 feet in height. The steel shell structure 42 is formed from plates and beams. Plates and beams will be identified through as 44 and 46, respectively, for the fiimace shell 42 structure, except as indicated The floor 48 is fabricated from one-inch thick plate 44 steel that is welded together. Each weld is above a beam 46 to assure the integrity of the furnace shell 42.<br>
[0065J	Additional beams 46 are provided for furnace floor 48 support.<br>
Each beam 46 provides an 8 inch wide flange about every 18 inches on center. All of the beams 46 (exclusive of the joining beams which are completely seam welded) are stitched to the bosom plate 50. This permits "growth" in the steel due to thermal expansion during heating.<br>
[0066]	The beams 46 provide support and rigidity to the furnace<br>
bottom 52. The beams 46 maintain the furnace 14 rigid to reduce flexing during installation of the refractory and long-term use. The beams 46 also provide support so that during operation of the furnace 14 the mechanical loading on the refractory materials is minimized. The beams 46 also elevate the furnace bottom 52 from the floor on which the furnace 14 is mounted. This allows heat, which builds up under the furnace 14, to escape.<br>
(0067J	The furnace side walls 54 are likewise made of a steel plate and<br>
beam construction. Two wall regions are recognized, above metal line and below metal Ike. This distinction is made for both strength and thermal value considerations.<br>
[0068]	Below metal line, the plate is V* inch thick. Above metal line,<br>
the plate is 5/8 inch thick. In the present furnace, the first eight feet are considered (for design purposes) below metal line and the upper four feet are considered (for design purposes) above metal line.<br>
[0069]	Beams 46 are used to support the side wails 54 of the furnace<br>
14. The beams 46 are set on 18 inch centeriines running vertically along the fiimace 14, Horizontal beams 46 are placed at 18 inch centers below metal line and 24 inch centers above metal line. Although the metal line in the furnace 14 varies, it is, for<br>
13<br><br>
WO 02/088400	PCT7US02/0S701<br>
design considerations, the highest level of metal that will be in the furnace 14 during normal operation. Additional factors may be considered, in which, for example, the metal line can be assumed to be nine inches above the maximum fill line of the fiiraace 14.<br>
[0070]	The roof 56 of the furnace 14 is a hanging refractory design.<br>
Beams 46 are on 18 inch centers along the width of the furnace 14. Additional beams 46 are welded to beams extending across the width, which additional beams are oriented along the length of the furnace 14, Clips are mounted to the beams, to which precast refractory blocks are mounted.<br>
[6071]	The furnace 14 has two mala doors 58 on the furnace side 54.<br>
The doors 58 are used during operation for skimming or cleaning the main furnace heat chamber or bath ares 60 and for main furnace chamber 60 charging.   Dross D (the contaminant slag that forms of the surface of molten aluminum) builds up inside the furnace 14 and.must be cleaned out at least once a day to maintain heat transfer rates. The dross D is removed by opening the doors 58 and skimming the surface of the molten metal pool.<br>
[0072]	Although during typical operation, metal or scrap is placed in<br>
the charge well 62, and is subsequently melted and transferred to the ftirnace heat chamber 60, some types of scrap, such as sows or ingot, are better placed directly is the main heat chamber 60. The doors 58 can be opened to transfer these types of loads to the heat chamber 60.<br>
[0073]	The doors 60 are of steel and refractory construction. The<br>
doors 60 are hung on a mechanical pulley system (not shown) and are protected by safety chains to prevent them from falling to the ground in the event that the pulley system fails. Powered winches are used to operate the doors. The doors 60 are hung from a common cross member, which is supported from the side 54 of the fiirnace 14.<br>
[0074]	The main charge well 62 is located on the front 64 of the<br>
furnace 14, The well 62 is partitioned from the furnace heat chamber 60 and is partitioned into two areas: a charging area 66; and a circulation pump area 68, A circulation pump 70 circulates metal from the hot pool of molten aluminum in the rasin chamber 60 to the scrap charging area 62.<br>
[007S]	There are three openings, indicated at 72, 74 and 76, between<br>
the chambers 60, 66 and 68. The first opening 72 is in the partition between the main chamber 60 and the pump well 68, The second opening 74 is in the partition between<br>
H<br><br>
WO 02/088400	PCT/US02/08701<br>
the pump well 68 and the scrap charging area 66. The third opening 76 is in the partition between the charge well 66 and the main heat chamber 60.<br>
[0076)	All of the openings 72, 74 and 76 are about one foot below the<br>
physical or actual metal line of the furnace 14. The openings 72, 74 and 76 are below metal line to maintain the heat inside the main chamber 60, and to prevent the flow of oxides between the partitioned areas of the furnace 14 and to maintain the furnace airtight (i.e., maintain a controlled environment within the furnace 14). The pump 70 is located in an elevated area to prevent excessive furnace garbage, rocks and dross from accumulating in and around the pump 70.<br>
[0077]	An exhaust hood 78 is positioned above the charge chamber 66.<br>
The hood 78 is fabricated from steel and is mounted on beams 46 similar to those from which the side walls 54 are fabricated. The beams 46 are positioned on a plate that covers the side wall of the well, essentially capping it off. The hood 78 vents the main furnace chamber 60 through a stack 80 (see FIG. 4). The stack 80 exhausts gases from the furnace 14 and can be closed off to maintain pressure in the furnace 14.<br>
[0078]	Exhaust gases exit the furnace 14 and flow to a baghouse 82<br>
(FIG. 4). The baghouse 82 is used primarily for collection of unbumed carbon from paints, oils, solvents and the like inherent in scrap aluminum processing.<br>
(00791	The furnace 14 includes four oxy-fuel burners 84. The burners<br>
84 are installed on a side wall 54 of the furnace 14, opposite the doors 58. Steel is constructed surrounding the burners 84 to allow for mounting the burners 84 and maintaining the surrounding wall rigid.<br>
[0080]	The furnace 14 is lined with refractory materials. The floor 48<br>
is fabricated from two different refractory materials. The first material 86 is a poured slab, about six inches thick, of a high strength, castable refractory, such as AP Green KS-4, that forms a sub hearth. A floor material 88 is poured above the sub hearth 86 in monolithic fashion having a thickness of about thirteen to fourteen inches.   The floor material 88 is an AP Green 70AR refractory. It is a 70 percent alumina, aluminum resistant castable refractory.<br>
[0081]	The walls 54, 64 and 65 are fabricated from two layers of<br>
insulation 90 followed by the 70 AR castable or monolithic, phosphate bonded 85 percent alumina (MONO P85) plastic ramming refractory 92. The alumina content of this material is 85 percent. The backing insulation 90 is insulating board, about two inches thick in the side walls 54 of the furnace and about three inches thick on the<br>
15<br><br>
WO 02/088400	PCT/US02/08701<br>
front and rear walls 64, 65 of the furnace. The difference in insulation 90 thickness is to accommodate thermal expansion of the furnace 14. The rurnace walls 54, 64 and 65 will grow about 1/8 inch per linear foot. Thus, the furnace 14 will grow (along the 40 foot length) a total of about 5 inches. In that there is six inches of backing insulation 90 (each the front and rear has three inches), the insulation 90 will crush and allow for growth in the furnace walls 54,64 and 65 without damaging the furnace shell 42.<br>
[0082]	Insulating brick 94 is positioned between the crushable<br>
insulation board 90 and the cast refractory 92. The roof 56 is fabricated from 70 percent alumina castable refractory. The material is poured into six roof sections. Each door 58 frame is fabricated from 70 percent alumina AR refractory.<br>
[0083]	The furnace 14 has two sets of tap out blocks (not shown). The<br>
first set is positioned on the bottom 52 of the furnace and serve as drain blocks. A second set of blocks is positioned sixteen inches from the floor of the furnace and serves as a transfer set of blocks. The transfer blocks are set on the outside of the furnace for ease of replacement. The inside of the furnace is formed and the blocks are set on the outside and keyed in with a plastic ram.<br>
[0084]	There are two ramps (not shown) in the furnace, one at each of<br>
the main charge doors 58. The ramps are used for deslagging or skimming dross D from the molten metal and for allowing scrap aluminum to slide into the furnace. The ramps are composed of two materials. The base is a low grade aluminum resistant brick, stacked to form a ramp. The brick is covered with a castable refractory (about 18 inches thick), such as the 70AR material. The ramp extends from the edge of the sill into the furnace.<br>
[0085]	The wall 96 that separates the main rurnace chamber 60 and the<br>
charge well 62 is about 22 inches thick and is formed from 70AR material. The wall 96 is cast as a single monolithic structure.<br>
[0086]	The furnace 14 can operate in several modes from empty to<br>
holding and maintaining molten aluminum. When the furnace 14 is at peak operation it is about 80 percent to 90 percent full. The molten metal is at about 1400째F and the air temperature in the furnace is about 1800째F. The stack (exhaust) temperature is about 1000째F.   Air temperature is measured by a thermocouple 98 in the upper side wall 54 of the rurnace 14. Metal temperature is measured at the base of the circulating pump 70.<br>
16<br><br>
WO 02/088400<br><br>
PCT/US02/08701<br><br>
[0087]	Scrap is charged or introduced to the furnace in the charge well<br>
62 in increments of about 3,000 pounds. It will be understood that the size or weight of the introduced scrap will vary depending upon the size and capacity of the furnace 14.<br>
[0088]	Molten metal from the main chamber 60 is pumped onto the<br>
cool metal charge by the circulation pump 70. The molten metal transfers heat, by conductivity, to the cold metal charge. The charge metal rapidly heats and melts.<br>
{0089]	The primary mode of heat transfer to the charged aluminum is<br>
by conduction. The large heat sink provided by the full furnace enhances this effective method of heat transfer. When the furnace is 80 percent to 90 percent of capacity there is about 220,000 pounds of molten aluminum at about 1400째F. When scrap is charged into the furnace 14 the bath acts as a heat sink and provides the necessary energy for heat transfer to the charged metal. This is true regardless of the dimensions and capacity of the furnace, as adapted to the present oxy-fuel combustion system. The circulating pump 70 assists melt of the scrap by providing hot molten metal to the charge well 62 from the main furnace chamber 60. In addition, by circulating the molten metal, heat stratification throughout the furnace 14 is maintained low.<br>
[0090]	It has been found that by pumping or circulating the molten<br>
metal, the temperature differentia] between the top and the bottom of the furnace 14 (a height difference of about 42 inches) is only a few degrees Fahrenheit. Thus, the furnace 14 acts as a stable heat sink to provide a consistent heat source for conduction heat transfer to the charge metal.<br>
[0091]	Heat is input to the furnace 14 by the burners 84. It is believed<br>
that the principal mode of heat transfer to the furnace 14 is radiation, with some convective heat transfer. Because of the high flame temperatures, the oxy fuel combustion system provides efficient radiative heat transfer. The geometry of the furnace 14 is further designed to increase the heat transfer rate by maximizing the metal surface area over which heat transfer from the flame to the metal occurs.<br>
[0092]	In addition, the refractory materials above the metal line are<br>
made of a high alumina content material. These materials reflect the heat from the burners back into the molten metal. This is in contrast to conventional furnace designs which, rather than reflecting heat back into the molten metal pool, permit much of the heat to escape from the furnace.<br>
17<br><br>
WO 02/088400	1PCT/US02/0870K<br>
[0093]	For example, traditional furnaces use refractories that have a<br>
lower alumina content and a higher insulation value on the upper side walls. The present design, on.the other hand, uses higher alumina content refractories in order to reflect more of the radiative heat from the burners 84 to the bath area 60, Again, this is contrary to conventional furnace design. In traditional furnaces the lower side walls (defined as below metal line) use higher alumina refractories for strength. In contrast, the present design uses a Sower alumina castable refractory, which is more advanced and has a higher insulating value. In a sense the present design goes completely against the traditional application of refractories.<br>
{0094}	Moreover, because there is no nitrogen fed to the furnace 14<br>
(other than foel-bome nitrogen) the volume of hot gases (e.g., exhaust) going through the furnace 14 is very low. Advantageously, this increases the residence time of the gases in the furnace 14 providing additional opportunity for heat transfer to the molten metal. Convective heat transfer, while relatively low, is more efficient than in conventional furnaces. In that the hot gases in the present furnace 14 approach 5000째F and have a relatively long residence time, much of the heat is removed prior to exhaust.<br>
(0095]	A present furnace 14 operates at an energy input required to<br>
melt of about 1083 BTU per pound. The maximum heat input to the furnace 14 is about 40 million BTU (40 MMBTU) per hour, and typical heat input is about 10 to 12 MMBTU per hour. The heat input will, of course, depend upon the scrap being melted and the production requirements. The furnace is capable of melting up to 40,000 pounds per hour.<br>
The Combustion System<br>
[0096]	The combustion system, indicated in FIG. 3, generally at 100,<br>
is a dual combustion train that operates on a fuel, such as natural gas, foe! oil, waste oil, coal (pulverized, dust and liquefied), and an oxygen source. The system is designed as two complete combustion systems to facilitate maintenance, as well as to conserve energy during low use periods.   One oxygen train 102 and one exemplary natural gas fuel train 104 are shown in FIG. 3.<br>
[0097J	The combustion system 100 is controlled by a control system<br>
(illustrated in FIG. 11, indicated generally at 120) that includes a central processing unit ("CPU") 106 that monitors all data inputs from metal temperature, air<br>
IS<br><br>
WO 02/088400	PCT/USO 2/08 701<br>
temperature, fuel and oxygen flow, and provides an operator interface. Each combustion train can be operated individually or in tandem based on operating conditions and requirements.<br>
[0098]	The main process input variable used to control the combustion<br>
system 100 is the metal bath temperature as measured by a thermocouple 108. Alternative process input variables include signals from one of several air temperature sensors 98,110. The control scheme includes inputs from thermocouples (type K) located in the furnace upper wall, exhaust stack and furnace roof, indicated generally as inputs 112. The primary thermocouple 108 is located in the molten metal bath are 60. The air thermocouples 112 are sheathed with alumina or like materials to protect the measuring element from the atmosphere. The bath thermocouple 108 is protected from molten metal by a ceramic sheath that is resistant to heat and to the corrosive conditions found in molten metal. The bath thermocouple 108 is configured to signal initiation of the burner system only when the metal bath temperature falls below a preset level.<br>
[0099]	The stack thermocouple or the roof thermocouple 116 is<br>
designed for over temperature protection. This thermocouple 116 is connected to an over-temperature circuit that shuts down the combustion trains 102, 104 to protect the refractory and furnace 14 structure in the event that an over temperature limit is reached.<br>
[0100]	The upper wall thermocouple 98 is primarily used to monitor<br>
the furnace 14 air temperature. It can also be used to operate the furnace .14 in the absence of the molten bath thermocouple 108. The upper wall thermocouple 112 is also used as the process input variable when metal is first being charged in the furnace 14 or when the level of molten metal drops below the molten bath thermocouple 108.<br>
[0101]	An operator has full control over individual temperature set<br>
points.   A control panel 118 includes temperature indicators for all of the thermocouples 92, 108,110, 112,114, 116. The operator can adjust each thermocouple set point until operation limits are achieved. The operational set point limits can be internally set within the CPU so that any desired temperature range can be established.<br>
[0102]	The combustion system control system 120 is configured in<br>
two parts. The first part 122 includes hard wired safety devices, such as relays, limit switches and the like, as will be recognized by those skilled in the art. These include<br>
19<br><br>
WO 02/088400	PCT/US02/08701<br>
all gas pressure switches, shut off and blocking valves, and flame detectors. The second part 124 of the control system 120 is monitoring and automatic control functions carried out by the CPU 106.<br>
[0103]	The gas trains 104 are configured in pairs so that one train can<br>
be in service while the other is out of service for, for example, maintenance or low-load/use periods. Each gas train 104 is appropriately sized vis-a-vis oxygen flow requirements. Each gas train 104 commences at a ball-type shut off valve 130. Piping 132 routes the gas through a strainer 134 to remove any debris present in the line. A gas pilot line 136 extends from the piping 132 after the strainer 134.<br>
[0104]	A backpressure regulator 138 is used to lower the header<br>
pressure. Presently, the oxygen pressure is set at about 18 pounds per square inch (psig). A shut off valve 140 and safety valves 142 follow in line. A differential pressure flow meter 144 is located downstream of the safety valves 142. The flow meter 144 measures the temperature and differential pressure of the gas as it flows through an orifice 146. A present flow meter 144 is a Rosemount model 3095 differential pressure flow meter.<br>
[0105]	Through these measurements a flow rate is determined and a<br>
signal is transmitted to the control system 120. A control valve 148 is in line following the flow meter 144. In a present arrangement, a modulating control valve is used that receives an output signal from the control system 120. The valve 148 transmits a signal to the control system 120, and specifically, the CPU 106, indicating the actual valve 148 position.<br>
[0106]	The gas train 104 then splits into two separate lines 104a,b each<br>
having a vaive 150a,b. The valves 150a,b are used to balance each burner 84 so that the gas flow is evenly distributed.<br>
[0107J	The oxygen train 102 is similar to the gas train 104, except that<br>
the line sizes and components are larger to accommodate the larger flow rate of oxygen. An exemplary oxygen train 102 is illustrated in FIG. 3, in which those 짝 components corresponding to fuel train 104 components are indicated by 200 series number identifiers.<br>
[0108]	Referring to FIG. 10, the burners 84 are a fairly straight<br>
forward design. Each of the four burners 84 includes a main inlet nozzle body 152 that extends into the furnace 14. A fuel gas inlet 154 extends to the main inlet body 152 external of the furnace wall 54. Oxygen is input to the main inlet nozzle body<br>
20<br><br>
WO 02/088400	PCT/USO2/OS7O1<br>
152 and mixes with the fuel gas. An igniter (act shown) extends through a central opening 156 in the main inlet body 152. The igniter provides a spark for ignition of the fuel/oxygen mixture.<br>
10109)	Operation of the combustion system 100 is readily carried out<br>
by a combination of operated initiated action and automatic control by the CPU 106. Power is provided to the system controls which enables the CPU 106 and the hardwired safeties portion 122 of the control systeml 20. The CPU 106 initiates communication with the control valves, thermocouples, and relays that are part of the hard-wired safeties portion 122. The gas and oxygen pressure switches are of a dual hi/low switch design. The low-pressure switch is a normally closed signal while the high-pressure side is a normally open signal. The CPU 106 determines whether a the proper signal is present and allows the program to continue. If an improper signal is recognized, audible and visual alarms are actuated. The control scheme also monitors whether the gas and oxygen control valves 148,248 are in the "low-fire" position. If the control valves 148,24S are in the proper position, a signal is transmitted that allows the control system 120 to continue the startup procedure.   An over-temperature signal must also be clear to allow the system 120 to continue through the start up procedure.<br>
(0110]	When all of the startup conditions are met, a nitrogen parge<br>
cycle is initiated. Nitrogen is used to purge the furnace 14 of any combustible gases that may be remaining in the furnace 14. The nitrogen purge is timed so that the volume of nitrogen through ihe fiiraace 14 is about 2.5 times the volume of the furnace 14.<br>
(01I1J	Afler the purge is complete, one or both of the combustion<br>
trains is started. A control switch places either a pair of burners or all of the burners 84 into operation. A flame controller opens the pilot solenoids. The pilot solenoids are normally closed, however, upon starting, the solenoids are opened and gas and oxygen flow through a pilot assembly.<br>
(0112]	At the tip of the pilot assembly the gases mix and are ignited by<br>
a spark .emitted controlled by the flame controller. Upon ignition, a flame detector 126 detects the presence or absence of flame and transmits a signal to the control system 120. Once a flame is detected, the control system 120 opens the main blocking valves for both the gas and oxygen.<br>

WO 02/088400<br><br>
PCT/US02/08701<br><br>
[0113]	The main fuel and oxygen shut off valves 140, 240 operate<br>
independently.   The safety valves 142, 242 are configured such that if the gas valve 140 does not open, the safety valves 142,242 do not open. When the main gas valve 140 opens, the gas and oxygen safety valves open 142,242. With all of the main valves open, a control relay is energized as well as an indicator light for each gas train on the control panel 118. A pilot timer remains energized for a preset time period, about 30 seconds. Once the preset time duration has elapsed, the pilot circuit is de-energized and the normally closed solenoid valves are de-energized, isolating the pilot assemblies and the pilot indicator light for each burner train.<br>
[0114]	The flame detectors 126 continuously monitor the flame. Upon<br>
loss of flame indication, an alarm signal is transmitted to the CPU 106 and the control circuit isolates the gas and oxygen shut off valves 140, 240 and blocking valves 142, 242.<br>
[0115]	Once the pilots are de-energized, furnace automatic operation is<br>
assumed by the control system 120. While the system 120 is set to "low fire", the oxygen control valves 248 are maintained in the closed position regardless of process and set point values. The gas control valves 148 are not limited in their range since gas flow follows oxygen flow. The control system 120 maintains the gas at the preset ratio.<br>
[0116]	When operating in the automatic mode, the control system 120<br>
responds to deviations from the process and set point values. Furnace temperature is monitored and matched to the temperature set point When the process temperature deviates from the set point temperature, an error signal is generated, and the control system 120 transmits a signal to the oxygen control valve 248. The gas control valve 148'is also controlled by the control system 120; the set.point variable follows the (stoichiometrically correlated) flow rate of oxygen as established by the oxygen flow meter. The control system 120 is configured to limit the control valves 148,248 that, in turn, limit the output power of the burners 84.<br>
[0117]	The combustion system 100, and specifically the control<br>
system 120 can be configured to meet any desired application for and in any industry that relies on carbon based fuels. For example, in the present scrap aluminum processing plant 10, there are three applications or uses of the oxygen fueled combustion system 100. The first is for melting aluminum in a high production environment (i.e., in the melting furnace 14). Second, the system 100 is present in the<br>
22<br><br>
WO 02/088400	PCT/US02/0870!<br>
holding furnace 16 primarily for steady state temperature and aJloy mixing of the molten aluminum. The last application is in a dross-melting furnace 166 in which high temperature burners are used to release the metal units (aluminum which can be recovered for production) from the dross D (melt byproduct) by thermal shock. In each use, the burners are installed for energy conservation and environmental reasons.<br>
[0118]	Applications of the present combustion system 100 vary by<br>
thermal output (measured in maximum MMBTU per hour), size and orientation of the burners 84, as well as the temperatures at which the furnaces 14,16, 166 are designed to operate. Those skilled in the art will recognize that mechanical differences (e.g., line sizes and the like) are needed to accommodate these differing needs, and that the specific programming of the control system 120 and CPU 106 may vary.<br>
(0119)	The present combustion system 100 provides a number of<br>
advantages over known and presently used combustion systems. For example, it has been shown through operation that there is considerable energy savings using the present combustion system 100. The oxy-fusl burners 84 operate at a much higher temperature than conventional furnaces. Thus, there is an observed increase in the heat available for melt (in other industrial applications, this increased heat can be made available for, for example, steam generation , refuse incineration and the like). This provides a reduction in the amount of fuel required to operate the furnaces 14, 16, 166. In practice of the present invention, it has been observed that the average (and estimated) thermal input required per pound of aluminum melted is decreased from about 3620 BTU per pound (in a conventional furnace) to about 1083 BTU per pound in the melting furnace 14. This is a decrease of about 70 percent. In addition, the fuel needed to maintain temperature in the holding furnace 16 has been shown to be about one-half of that of a conventional furnace.<br>
[0120]	It is believed that the fuel savings is attributed to three principal<br>
factors. First, the increased heat of the combustion system 100 permits complete burn of all fuel without excess oxygen. Second, being held to theory, it is believed that the combustion system 100 operates within a radiative (or radiant) heat transfer zone, with some heat transfer by conduction.<br>
[0121]	The system 100 is designed to take advantage of the radiant<br>
heat transfer within the furnaces 14,16, 166 to transfer heal effectively to the metal baths. Third, because there is no nitrogen in the combustion process, the amount of gas flowing through the furnaces 14, 16, 166 is low. Thus, an increased residence<br>
23<br><br>
WO 02/088400	PCT/US02/0870S<br>
time of the hot gases permits the release of a larger proportion of energy (in the form of heat) prior to exhaust from the furnaces 14,16, 166.<br>
(0122]	Typical exhaust gas volume is fractional of that of conventional<br>
furnaces. In that there is about 80 percent less gases (essentially the nitrogen component of air) in an oxy-fueled furnace, combustion efficiency is greatly increased. In conventional furnaces, the nitrogen component of air absorbs much of the energy (again, in the form of heat) from the melt. In the present combustion system 100, oxygen (rather than air) and fuel are fed to the furnaces 14, 16, 166 and burned in a stochiometric ratio. This is carried out without excess oxygen. Thus, there is no energy absorbed by non-combustion related materials e.g., excess oxygen or nitrogen).<br>
[0123]	The present combustion system 100 also provides for increased<br>
production. When installed as part of a melting furnace, the melting capacity or throughput of the furnace will be increased. This again is attributed to the rapid and effective heat transfer in the furnace 14. As new metal is introduced into the furnace 14, the combustion system 100 responds rapidly to provide heat to melt the fed metal and to maintain the heat (temperature) of the molten metal in the pool 60 at the set point temperature. It has been found that aluminum accepts heat very efficiently from a radiative heat source.<br>
[0124]	Perhaps most importantly, is the reduced environmental impact<br>
of the present combustion system 100, compared to presently known and used combustion systems. The present system 100 advantageously uses no nitrogen (from air) in the combustion process. Typically, NOx production occurs in a furnace as a reaction product of the heated air that is fed by the combustion system. However, in that the present system 100 uses oxygen, rather than air, any NOx produced by the present combustion system is due solely to the amount of elemental nitrogen that is in the fuel (i.e., fuel-bome nitrogen). In that fuel-borne nitrogen levels are extremely low (compared to that contributed by air in conventional furnaces), the NOx levels of the present combustion system are well below any industry standards and governmental limitations. In addition to reducing NOx production, the production of other green-house gases, such as carbon monoxide, is also greatly reduced.<br>
[0125J	In addition, to the reduced environmental impact, the present<br>
oxy fuel combustion system conserves energy because significantly more aluminum can be processed at considerably less fuel input (any carbon based fuel, including<br>
24<br><br>
WO 02/0884(10	PCT/USn2/087"f<br>
coal, coal dust, natural gas or oil).   As a result of processing with less fuel usage, conservation of fuel resources is achieved. Essentially, less ruel is used in the aggregate, as well as on a per pound basis to produce aluminum. This reduces processing (e.g., fuel) costs, as well as the taxing use of fossil fuels.<br>
Oxygen Supply<br>
[0126]	As will be recognized by those skilled in the art, the oxygen<br>
requirements for the present combustion system 100 can be quite high. To this end, although oxygen can be purchased and delivered, and stored for use in the system, it is more desirable to have an oxygen production facility near or as part of an oxy fuel combustion system, such as the exemplary scrap aluminum processing plant.<br>
[0127]	Referring now to FIG. 4, there is shown a cryogenic plant 180<br>
for use with the present combustion system 100. The illustrated, exemplary cryogenic plant 180 produces 105 tons per day of at least 95 percent purity oxygen and 60,000 standard cubic feet per hour of nitrogen having less then 0.1 part per million oxygen. The plant 180 includes a 1850 horsepower three-stage compressor 182. The compressed air, at 71 psig enters a purifier/expander 184. The air exits the expander 184 at a pressure of 6.9 psig and a temperature of -264째F, and enters a cryogenic distillation column 186. In the column 186, air is separated (distilled) into gaseous nitrogen, liquid nitrogen, gaseous oxygen and liquid oxygen. The gaseous oxygen, indicated generally at 188, is fed directly to the combustion system 100 and the liquid oxygen, indicated generally at 190, is stored for example in tanks 191, for later use for in the combustion system 100. The oxygen pressure from the cryogenic plant 180 may be lower than that required for the combustion system 100. As such, an oxygen blower 192 is positioned between the oxygen discharge from the column 186 and the combustion system 100 feed to raise the pressure to that need for the combustion system 100.<br>
[0128]	The gaseous nitrogen, indicated generally at 194, is fed to a<br>
downstream annealing/stress relieving system (not shown) within the plant 10. These systems, which use nitrogen to treat aluminum to relieve stresses in the metal and to anneal the metal, will be recognized by those skilled in the art In addition, the nitrogen 194 is used in the degassing units 24. The plant 10 also includes a back up supply of oxygen and nitrogen 191, 196, respectively, in liquid form in the event of, for example, maintenance or other situations in which the cryogenic plant 180 cannot<br>
25<br><br>
WO 02/088400	PCT/US02/08701<br>
supply the plant requirements. The back-up systems 191,196 are configured to automatically supply oxygen and/or nitrogen as required, such as when the cryogenic plant l짠0 is off-line. Excess nitrogen can be stored, bortfed and sold. Systems such as these are commercially available from various manufacturers, such as Praxair, Inc. of Danbuxy, Connecticut.<br>
Heat Recovery<br>
J0129]	The aluminum processing system 10 also takes advantage of<br>
waste heat from the various processes. Specifically, the processing plant 10 can include a waste heat recovery system, indicated generally at 200 in FIG. 4. Exhaust gas, indicated at 202, from the melting furnace 14 and the holding furnace 16 is directed to one side of a waste heat recovery heat exchanger 204, In that the exhaust gas 202 is at a temperature of about 1000째F, the<br>
An oxygen fueled combustion system includes a furnace (14) having at least one burner, an oxygen supply for supplying oxygen having a predetermined purity, and a carbon based fuel supply for supplying a carbon based fuel. The oxygen and the carbon based fuel are fed into the furnace (14) in a stoichiometic proportion to one another to limit an excess of either the oxygen or the carbon based fuel to less than 5 percent over the stoichiometric proportion. The combustion of the carbon based fuel provides a flame temperature in excess of 4500째F. The exhaust gas stream from the furnace (14) has substantially zero nitrogen-containing combustion produced gaseous compounds from the oxidizing agent and reduced green-house gases. Substantially less carbon based fuel is required than conventional combustion systems without a loss of energy output.<br><br></td>
