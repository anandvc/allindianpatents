This application is being filed as a PCX International Patent Application in the name of Nokia Corporation, a Finland national corporation and resident. Applicant for all designated countries; and Nokia Inc., a U.S. national corporation and resident, Applicant for St. Lucia only; on 04 March 2003, designating all countries except the US, and claiming priority to U.S. Serial No. 60/362,156 filed 05 March 2002 and U.S. Serial No. 10/187,391 filed 28 June 2002.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to enabling a customer to access media over a digital subscriber line (DSL) connection, and more particularly to enabling a customer to quickly change channels of media provided over a DSL connection.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Twenty-five years ago, telephone carriers primarily used residential telephone lines to provide voice services to customers. For entertainment, customers typically went outside the home, to movie theatres, to restaurants or parks. Broadcast television was the staple diet for channelling entertainment to homes. The cable industry was nascent and consisted primarily of positioning a big antenna and hooking up the amplifiers to feed the received signals to multiple homes. At that time, telephone carriers were satisfied that their share of the voice services market was unchallenged. The cable operators were too small and too specialised to be of much interest.<br>
Today, the predominant service offered by telephone carriers is still voice services. However the boundary between the cable industry and the telecommunication industry is blurring. Cable companies have not stopped at delivering entertainment media. In particular, they are also delivering data services through cable modems and indicated their intentions to compete with the telephone carriers in the delivery of voice services to residential customers.<br>
As technology has advanced, telephone wires and cable wires to homes have become exactly that, wires. What makes each wire different from any other wire is the services that it can provide to customers. In turn, the service that a<br><br>
wire provides determines its importance and value. The more services-a single wire can provide a customer, the more valuable the wire is. Thus, separate wires to a home for each type of service has become less important and is often unnecessary.<br>
Over time, the type of access point/connection to the home has become less important than the services it can provide. While it is possible to evaluate the group psyche and examine human behaviour issues to try and determine why predominantly entertainment industries such as cable companies and Internet companies have seen exponential growth patterns, that is not the purpose of this discussion. However, it is important to note that the growth numbers indicate that a mass-market consumer audience when correlated to entertainment has resulted in a market segment that is profitable and is growing. An observation validated by the emergence of cable and Internet companies from humble beginnings to huge conglomerates today.<br>
That observation has two parts. The first part is the growth of a mass-market consumer audience for entertainment provided to the home. The second part is that entertainment has played an equally important role in the emergence of an entirely new revenue sector.<br>
Entertainment can be visual and aural, such as video or movies. Purely visual entertainment can take the form of a book, magazine or newspaper. Aural entertainment can include music, commentary, news broadcasts, and the like. The emergence of an open format for the exchange of visual entertainment over the Internet has been one of the comer stones in the emergence and establishment of dominant online service providers. Entertainment as described above does not differentiate it from information and pure entertainment. However, the differentiator between information and entertainment is more qualitative and subjective. The scope of delivery of these is not necessarily different. Hence, collectively, both visual and aural entertainment can be referred to as media.<br>
For telecommunication companies to compete effectively for customers in the future, they will have to deploy a compelling set of services that include media. These services must at least equate if not exceed the performance of similar services on other networks such as provided by cable companies. It is with respect to these considerations and others that the present invention has been made.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to addressing the above-mentioned shortcomings, disadvantages and problems, and will be understood by reading and studying the following specification.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, a method is provided for an authenticated, fast channel change for media such as video delivered over an Internet Protocol (IP) network to a customer. The invention allows channel changes to be made very quickly with validation at an access node. An example of an access node is a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM) that provides high speed access to a customer over which a channel is delivered. The reasons that a channel may not be available to the customer could be commercial, i.e., the customer may not have subscribed to or paid for the requested channel. It could also be because a lock has been placed on a requested channel to restrict its availability to the customer based upon either a time constraint or personal preferences. For example a child viewer may not be allowed by a customer to watch violent movies on a particular channel.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a method for enabling fast access to at least one channel over an xDSL connection. At least one multicast enabled Digital Subscriber Line Access and Multiplexer (DSLAM) is employed to enable access to at least one channel on a core network. At least one subscriber is coupled to the core network by the xDSL connection. At a multicast enabled DSLAM, a request is received for at least one channel from a subscriber. The receiving DSLAM locally serves the xDSL connection for the subscriber. Information stored at the receiving DSLAM is employed to determine whether the subscriber is authorized to access the requested channel. If the subscriber is determined to be authorized to access the requested channel, the DSLAM is employed to provide access to the requested channel on the core network, establishes a single instance of each channel that is selectable by subscribers.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is directed to providing at least one IGMP multicast protocol. Also, a set top box can be employed by the subscriber to provide an xDSL connection that is locally served by the receiving DSLAM. Additionally, the stored information can be included in a database at the receiving DSLAM.<br><br>
A still further aspect of the invention is directed to providing each instance of each channel to the core network through a router coupled to another network. Also, a remote process may be employed to maintain the stored information. Additionally, a remote process can be employed to update the stored information.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is directed to accessing the requested channel over the xDSL connection for the subscriber that is locally served by the receiving DSLAM. Also, the channel can include media for displaying, recording and playing with a set top box. Additionally, the media can include at least one of videos, graphics, pictures, text, talk shows, and television programs.<br>
In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, an apparatus, system and computer readable medium may be employed to practice substantially the same actions discussed above for the method.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanied drawings, which form a part hereof, and which is shown by way of illustration, specific exemplary embodiments of which the invention may be practiced. Each embodiment is described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.<br>
Throughout the specification and claims, the following terms take the meanings explicitly associated herein, imless the context clearly dictates otherwise. The term "packet" refers to an IP packet. The term "flow" means a flow of packets. The term "connection" refers to a flow or flows of packets that share a common path. The term "node" refers to a network element that interconnects one or more networks or devices. The term "user" refers to any person or customer such as a business or organization that employs a device to communicate or access resources over a network. The term "operator" refers to any technician or organization that maintains or services a packet-based network.<br>
The term "router" refers to a dedicated network element that receives packets and forwards them to their destination. In particular, a router is used to extend or segment networks by forwarding packets from one logical network to another. A router typically operates at layer 3 and below of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model for networking. However, some routers can provide additional functionality that operates above layer 3 of the OSI reference model.<br>
The term "xDSL" refers to any version of a Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) that communicates packets between an end-user's modem and an access node, e.g., a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM), connected to a core network. The versions of DSL include Asynchronous DSL, Synchronous DSL, Rate DSL, Hybrid DSL, very high bit rate DSL and the like.<br><br>
The term "core network" refers to any packet switched digital network. For example, Frame Relay, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Switched Megabit Data Service, and the like.<br>
The term DSLAM refers to a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer which is employed to split the signals from multiple local xDSL loops into analog voice signals for a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and data signals for a core network.<br>
The term set top box or "STB" refers to a device that enables a monitor, display screen, television, and the like, to become a user interface for a digital network such as a core network, the Internet, and the like. The set top box also enables the receiving and decoding of digital broadcasts for recording, playing and/or displaying.<br>
Referring to the drawings, like numbers indicate like parts throughout the views. Additionally, a reference to the singular includes a reference to the pural unless otherwise stated or is inconsistent with the disclosure herein.<br>
A method and system is provided for fast channel changes of media provided by carriers over an xDSL connection to a home. Each customer's subscriber information is stored at the DSLAM that supports the xDSL connection to the home. Also, each DSLAM supports multicast protocols so that only one instance of a channel is provided on the core network regardless of how many customers have requested access to the channel.<br>
When a customer at home is viewing media on a television set that receives a wireless signal from a terrestrial TV station, the channel changes occur quickly. Typically, channel changes occur in one second or less. Also, when a customer is viewing a channel on a television set that receives a signal over a cable network, the channel changes are very fast as well. As a result, customers expect relatively rapid responses to channel change requests. As the number of media channels increases, it becomes even more difficult to ensure that channel changes remain fast for the customer.<br>
Not all media channels are equal. Besides the obvious differences in the programming themes and the qualitative as well as subjective differences, some channels are considered premium channels. Premium channels carry a different cost structure for the customer. This cost structure could take the form of a different subscription price per time period (per week or per month) or may cost the viewer an<br><br>
additional charge for a single view. (Pay per view for a specific event). Different premium channels could be combined with standard channels to create different packages or subscription levels. A combination of a set of channels is often called a service package and is sometimes referred to as a subscription level. A service package can be a combination of any number of premium channels and standard channels. Some service packages can have no video channels as well.<br>
To ensure that charges can be collected for service packages, service providers typically employ a service package validation system. For example, in the cable TV industry this validation package is referred to as a conditional access system (CAS). Another example is a smart card that is often used by service providers who deliver their packages over a Satellite downlink. Service package validation is well established in the cable TV industry as well as the satellite TV industry. With cable TV service packages, it is possible to rapidly change channels (channel surf) and validation can be performed quickly in real time. However, service package validation systems are less well known in the telecommunication industry.<br>
For media service providers to effectively use wire-line access or wireless access to homes that is provided by a telephone carrier, a service package validation system is necessary. However, any service package validation system provided by a telephone carrier must process channel change requests as rapidly as those for terrestrial TV or cable TV systems. For telephone carriers, IP-based networks are a popular choice for communicating media to customers. Often the media is multicast from a single source in an effort to conserve bandwidth on a core network. Intemet multicasting protocols are well defined as an international standard by the Intemet Group Management Protocol (IGMP). See IETF RFC-2236, which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
While fast channel changes can be performed with IGMP protocols, it may not always be possible to quickly perform channel changes when the customer's request must first be authenticated and authorized. In the past, when media was distributed over an IP-based telephone carrier network using multicast methods, the authentication and authorization was separately processed by invoking explicit calls to an application level authorization agent or system. This separate processing often added significant delay in responding to channel change requests from customers.<br><br>
FIGURE 1 illustrates an overview of an exemplary system 100 for enabling a consumer to change/select media channels with set top boxes 110A-F) over an xDSL telephone line. DSLAMs 108A-C are coupled to core network 112 and they support xDSL telephone lines that are coupled to respective local set-top boxes 110A-F. On another network (not shown). Program Guide Server 104 is coupled to router 106 and Billing and Subscriber Management Server 102. Additionally, the type of media that is provided by a channel may include, but is not limited to, video, graphics, pictures, music, text, talk shows, television programs, and the like.<br>
In FIGURE 1, a consumer has requested/changed a channel from set top box 1 l0F. The channel request is received over an xDSL line by DSLAM 108C and conveyed to Program Guide Server 104 over core network 112 through router 106. Program Guide Server 104 processes the request by extracting a consumer Identification (ID) number and other characteristics of the request. Program Guide Server 104 requests Billing and Subscriber Management Server 102 to validate the channel request from the consumer. The Billing and Subscriber Management Server 102 determines if the consumer is validated to receive the requested channel and sends a validation response to Program Guide Server 104, which then either allows or disallows the change request based at least in part on the contents of the validation response.<br>
Also, when the channel request is allowed. Program Guide Server 104 will provide the media for the requested channel to DSLAM 108C, which then delivers the requested charmers media to set top box 11 OF. Alternatively, if the request is denied by Program Guide Server 104, then the media is not provided to DSLAM 108C which locally serves the consumer requesting a selected channel at set-top box UOF.<br>
The associated time measures are the following: Tc - the time for the<br>
consumer device (set-top box) to send the request; TCD - the transit time between the<br>
consumer and the DSLAM; Top - the transit time from the DSLAM to the Program<br>
guide server; Tp - processing time within the program guide server; TPB - transit time<br>
between the program guide server and the Billing and Subscriber Data Processing<br>
server; TB - the processing time within the Billing and Subscriber Data Processor;<br>
TBP - the transit time from B to P; TPD	- the transit time from P to D; TDC - the<br>
transit time from D to C; Tcs - the time required by C to establish the actions taken<br><br>
as result of the response.   Thus, the total time taken to fulfil consumer request is as follows:<br>
Toriginal = Tc + TcD +TDP + Tp +TpB + TB + TBP + TpD + TDC + Tcs.<br>
Alternatively, the program guide displayed to the consumer could make available choices that have been pre-validated. Hence, any request that comes from the consumer can be assumed to be valid. For this case, the total time taken is represented by the equation as follows:<br>
Taltenative =  Tc + TcD + TQC + Tcs-<br>
Also, there are two assumptions in this equation. First, the DSLAM is multicast enabled or that a multicast channel is available at the DSLAM. If the DSLAM is not multicast enabled then the request must be propagated as far as the program guide server or the video ingestion point. In this case the total time would increase to Tc + TCD "*~TDP + Tp + TDC + Tcs- Second, the program guide server can remotely control the consumer device to send it updated information without it being requested by the consumer device.<br>
The invention improves upon earlier solutions in at least two ways. First, each DSLAM is enabled for multicasting with IGMP, Second, channel requests from consumers are validated locally at the DSLAM serving a set-top box.<br>
FIGURE 2A shows an exemplary system 200 where at least a portion of the disadvantages in using non-multicast DSLAMs 206A-C are illustrated. An exemplary system 200 enables a consumer to change/select media channels with set top boxes 204 over an xDSL telephone line. Non-multicast enabled DSLAMs 206A-C are coupled to core network 208 and they support xDSL telephone lines that are coupled to their respective local set-top boxes 204. On another network, a Program Guide Server is coupled to router 202 and a Billing and Subscriber Management Server. Although not shown, these servers operate in substantially the same manner as discussed in FIGUREl.<br>
The throughput of media from another network (not shown here) to core network 208 at the media ingestion point, i.e., router 202, is directly proportional to the number of consumers requesting a channel at their set-top boxes<br><br>
204 through their respective DSLAMs 206A-C. Even if two consunvers served by the same non-multicast enabled DSLAM have requested the same channel, independent channels are established across the core network for each consumer to view that channel. In this case, a separate channel must be established for each consumer request, e.g., six set top boxes coupled to a core network through non-multicast enabled DSLAMs would require a six channel throughput at router 202 even if each set top box had requested the same channel.<br>
An equation expressing this relationship is as follows:<br>
(Core Network Utilization)SOMULTICASTJ_SIAM OC The number of Active Consumers<br>
FIGURE 2B illustrates an exemplary system where each DSLAM is multicast enabled. An exemplary system 220 enables a consumer to change/select media channels with set top boxes 224 over an xDSL telephone line. Multicast enabled DSLAMs 226A-C are coupled to core network 228 and they support xDSL telephone lines that are coupled to their respective local set-top boxes 224. On another network (not shown), a Program Guide Server is coupled to router 222 and a Billing and Subscriber Management Server. Although not shown, these servers operate in substantially the same manner as discussed in FIGUREL<br>
For this embodiment, there is no duplication of channel traffic across core network 228. Instead, the multicast enabled DSLAMs terminate a connection for each channel on core network 228 and then handle multicast requests among the consumers (set-top boxes 224) that it locally services. In this way, the throughput at the media ingestion point, i.e., router 222, and on core network 228 is directly proportional to the number of channels made available. For example, if six set top boxes are coupled to a core network through multicast enabled DSLAMs and each set top box is only requesting one of two different channels, only a two channel throughput is required at router 202 to provide media to the set top boxes 224.<br>
An equation expressing the operation of this embodiment is as follows:<br><br><br>
FIGURE 3 illustrates a combination of both the first and second improvements provided by the invention. In particular, the second improvement enables the consumer's requests from a set top box to be validated (authenticated/authorized) at the locally serving DSLAM, which is multicast enabled (supports IGMP), Subscriber information, billing information and additional information pertaining to the consumer is stored locally at the multicast enabled DSLAM. This information, in combination with a multicast facility in the DSLAM, enables a consumer's channel change request to be quickly evaluated, and if validated, almost immediately provide the media playing on the requested channel.<br>
In FIGURE 3, an overview of an exemplary system 300 is illustrated for enabling a consumer to change/select media chaimels with set top boxes 310A-F) over an xDSL telephone line. Multicast enabled DSLAMs 308A-C are coupled to core network 312 and they support xDSL telephone lines that are coupled to respective local set-top boxes 310A-F, On another network. Program Guide Server 304 is coupled to router 306 and Billing and Subscriber Management Server 302. These servers operate in substantially the same manner as discussed in FIGUREl except that they download the information necessary to validate and authorized a channel change request to each DSLAM in advance of the request.<br>
In this embodiment, a channel change request from set top box 31 OF is propagated only as far as the locally serving and multicast enabled DSLAM 308C. Also, core network 312 only has to supply one instance of each requested channel instead of separate channels for each validated and approved request.<br>
Hence, the total time for a chaimel change for the embodiment shown in FIGURE 3 can be expressed in an equation as follows:<br>
TNEW_METHOD= Tc + TcD+ Toe +Tcs<br><br>
While the total time to process a channel change request may at times be similar as some of the methods described above, the invention improves upon at least three vulnerabilities present in previous methods. In the invention, consumer/subscriber data that is used for authentication/validation is downloaded only as far as the DSLAM. The DSLAM is maintained and managed by the service provider such as a telephone carrier. The consumers do not have access to this information or to the management interfaces for the DSLAM. Hence it is difficult to illegally modify or hack the information for unauthorized access to media channels.<br>
In contrast, previous methods have downloaded the data used for authentication/validation and authorization for channel changes to a device, e.g., set top box that resides in the consumer's premises, which can be vulnerable to hacking and/or unauthorized changes. In this case, an unscrupulous consumer (hacker) could apply hacking practices such as channel sniffing. In channel sniffing, the hacker runs a program that issues seemingly valid channel change requests using the well established multicast protocols in the hope that at least one of the requests specifies the right set of channel identifiers. With enough time, the hacker could establish what the correct channel identifiers are. Further, if the DSLAM is not validating the channel change requests, it will respond to any request that has the right data in it. Thus, channel sniffing attacks, and the like, can be reduced with the invention.<br>
Additionally, previous methods relied upon a consumer identifier stored in a device such as a set top box at the consumer's premises. This method is not safe since this information can be spoofed. In contrast, the invention provides for authenticating/validating the consumer information based upon their access port on the DSLAM. Since the service provider maintains the access port information, it is easier to securely associate a subscription package with a specific consumer location.<br>
FIGURE 4 illustrates an overview 400 of one embodiment of the invention that includes at least two software components: an authentication module 402 that runs on IGMP enabled DSLAM 414 where this module authenticates consumer service requests; and an Operations Support System (OSS) module 408 that maintains the freshness of consumer authentication data stored on DSLAM 414 and is in communication with a remote application that processes authentication data for each DSLAM on a core network (not shown, but substantially similar to the system shown in FIGURE 3).<br><br>
In FIGURE 4, DSLAM 414 is shown receiving a request for a media (video) channel from consumer's set top box (STB) 404 in the form of an IGMP request. In this example, monitor 406 is coupled to STB 404 to play media (video) on the requested channel. Also, audio interface 412 is coupled to STB 404 for playing audio signals on a requested channel.<br>
Upon receipt of the channel change request, DSLAM 414 parses it and employs authentication module 402 to perform a look up function on authentication database 410 based on the STB's IP address or a suitable consumer identifier such as a port ID, and the channel's multicast address supplied in the content of the request. The consumer device identifier may be assumed to be valid and unique. In near real time, this information is checked against an STB identifier (e.g., a MAC address) and media service profile information cached in DSLAM 402.<br>
If the consumer is authorized to receive the requested channel, a copy of this channel will be provided to STB 404 until such time another channel is selected. In the case where the consumer has not yet subscribed to the requested channel, a generic service denial message can be provided. Under most conditions, the transaction time from the STB to send the channel request and a response to be returned by the DSLAM will be less than 250 milliseconds when the present invention is employed.<br>
As implied above, the consumer's channel privileges will be cached on multicast enabled DSLAM 414, In one embodiment, the invention can provide a documented SNMP northbound interface to allow OSS application 408 to maintain the accuracy of this information. This embodiment will be capable of maintaining the information on an STB by STB basis. Changes to this information can be supported during run time, and this information can be stored in a hash table to maintain expeditious info retrieval rates.<br>
Since the OSS component is typically remotely located, it could provide updates to the DSLAM on a per subscription change basis for each consumer. Under most circumstances, a service provider will wish to propagate subscription changes to the DSLAMs on the core network on a near real time basis. Therefore, when a consumer requests a new subscription for a channel or removal of an existing one, the OSS could immediately provide the changes to a DSLAM on the core network that is locally serving the consumer's STB.  It is understood that<br><br>
the remote OSS application can send service change messages based on SNMP requests to the DSLAM for processing.<br>
In one embodiment, the OSS module and/or its remote application can be written in the "JAVA" programming language for execution in the JAVA virtual runtime environment. In another embodiment, the DSLAM-based implementation of the authentication module would be coded in the C programming language and executed in the DSLAM's operating system.<br>
FIGURE 5 illustrates an overview 500 of actions that are performed by the authentication module. Moving from a start block, the process advances to block 502 where a DSLAM-based authentication module parses a channel change request (IGMP request) that is received from a locally served set top box in a consumer's premises. The process flows to block 504 where the authentication module performs a lookup function on a subscriber database that is stored on the DSLAM that is locally serving the set top box. The process advances to decision block 506 where a determination is made whether the channel request is approved by the authentication module based at least in part on the consumer's privileges included in the locally stored subscriber database. If negative, the process jumps to an end block and retums to processing other actions.<br>
However, if the determination at decision block 506 is true, the process advances to block 508, where the authentication module asynchronously receives subscriber database updates provided by the OSS module. Next, the process moves to an end block and retums to performing other actions.<br>
FIGURE 6 illustrates an overview 600 of actions that are perfomied by the OSS module. Moving from a start block, the process advances to block 602 where the OSS module asynchronously maintains each subscriber database that is locally stored on a DSLAM, The process steps to block 604 where the OSS module provides subscriber updates to each DSLAM-based subscriber database when media service characteristics are added, changed, or deleted. The process flows to block 606 where the OSS module asynchronously audits the subscriber data stored in the subscriber database on each DSLAM. Next, the process moves to an end block and retums to performing other actions.<br>
FIGURE 7 illustrates a schematic overview of an exemplary set top box (STB) 700. Power supply 720 provides electrical energy for the operation of each component included in STB 700.   Bus 710 enables signals to be shared<br><br>
between several components including Read and Write Memory (RAM)/02, WRITE Once Memory (ROM) 704, audio interface 706, output interface 708, storage interface 716, controller 714 and xDSL interface 712. Programs and data for controlling the operation of STB 700 can be stored m RAM 702, ROM 704 and/or storage device 718, which is coupled to storage interface 716. Although not shown, xDSL interface 712 is also coupled via an xDSL loop to a locally serving DSLAM. Audio interface 706 may be employed to play and/or record at least audio media included in a channel selected by an operator/consumer.<br>
Video interface 708 is employed to output video signals included in a channel selected by the operator/consumer. The outputted video signals can be provided in any one of several known formats for playing on a display device such as a monitor, display screen, television and the like.<br>
FIGURE 8 illustrates a schematic overview of an exemplary DSLAM 800. Core network interface 806 is employed to communicate with substantially the same core network discussed above and below. Multiple set top boxes (see FIGURE 7) can be served via xDSL interface 802, which is coupled to the local xDSL loops for each consumer. Authentication module 810 performs substantially the same actions discussed above and below and is in communication with xDSL interface 802, system controller 812, subscriber database 814, and media channel access module 808. In concert, the operation and interaction of each of the components of DSLAM 800 enable the multicast functionality and local authentication of consumer channel change requests as discussed above and below.<br>
