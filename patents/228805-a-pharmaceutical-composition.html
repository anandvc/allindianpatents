				<td>[0001] The present inventior relates to novel pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising an active vitamin D compound, wherein the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions are emulsion pre-concentrates The invention-also.relates,to<br>
emulsions and sub-micron dioplet emulsions produced upon dilution of the<br>
emulsion pre-concentrates with an aqueous solution.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002] Vitamin D is a fat scluble vitamin which is essential as a positive<br>
regulator of calcium homeostas is. (See Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine:<br>
Part Eleven, "Disorders of Bone and Mineral Metabolism," Chapter 335, pp.<br>
1860-1865, E. Braunwald et a'., (eds.), McGraw-Hill, New York (1987)). The<br>
active form of vitamin D is 1 a; 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, also known as calcitriol.<br>
Specific nuclear receptors for active vitamin D compounds have been discovered<br>
in cells from diverse organs no involved in calcium homeostasis. (Miller et al.,<br>
Cancer Res. 52:515-520 (1992)). In addition to influencing calcium homeostasis,<br>
active vitamin D compounds have been implicated in osteogenesis, modulation<br>
of immune response, modulal ion of the process of insulin secretion by the<br>
pancreatic B cell, muscle cell function., and the differentiation and growth of<br>
epidermal and hematopoietic tissues.<br>
[0003] Moreover, there have been many reports demonstrating the utility of<br>
active vitamin D compounds in the treatment of cancer. For example, it has been<br>
shown that certain vitamin D, compounds and analogues possess potent<br>
antileukemic activity by virtue of inducing the differentiation of malignant cells<br>
(specifically, leukemic cells) to non-malignant macrophages (monocytes) and are<br>
useful in the treatment of leukemia. (Suda et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,391,802;<br>
Partridge etal, U.S. Patent No. 4,594,340). Antiproliferative and differentiating<br>
actions of calcitriol and other vitamin D, analogues have also been reported with<br>
respect to the treatment of prostate cancer. (Bishop et al., U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,795,882). Active vitamin D compounds have also been implicated in the<br>
treatment of skin cancer (Chic la et al., Cancer Research 45:5426-5430 (1985)),<br>
colon cancer (Disman et al., Cancer Research 47:21 -25 (1987)), and lung cancer<br>
(Sato et al., Tohoku J. Exp. Me i. J 38:445-446 (1982)). Other reports suggesting<br>
important therapeutic uses of active vitamin D compounds are summarized in<br>
Rodriguez et al, U.S. Patent fro. 6,034,079.<br>
[0004] Although the administrition of active vitamin D compounds may result<br>
in substantial therapeutic benefits, the treatment of cancer and other diseases with<br>
such compounds is limited by the effects these compounds have on calcium<br>
metabolism. At the levels requ red in vivo for effective use as anti-proliferative<br>
agents, active vitamin D compounds can induce markedly elevated and<br>
potentially dangerous blood calcium levels by virtue of their inherent calcemic<br>
activity. That is, the clinical use of calcitriol and other active vitamin D<br>
compounds as anti-proliferative agents is precluded, or severely limited, by the<br>
risk of hypercalcemia.<br>
[0005] It has been shown that the problem of systemic hypercalcemia can be<br>
overcome by "pulse-dose" adminstration of a sufficient dose of an active vitamin<br>
D compound such that an anti-proliferative effect is observed while avoiding the<br>
development of severe hypercalcemia. (WO 99/49870). According to WO<br>
99/49870, the active vitamin D compound may be administered no more than<br>
every three days, for example, once a week at a dose of at least 0.12 µg/kg per day<br>
(8.4 µg in a 70 kg person). Pharmaceutical compositions used in the pulse-dose<br>
regimen of WO 99/49870 comprise 5-100 µg of active vitamin D compound and<br>
may be administered in the form for oral, intravenous, intramuscular, topical,<br>
transdermal, sublingual, intranasal, intratumoral or other preparations.<br>
[0006] ROCALTROL is the trade name of a calcitriol formulation sold by Roche<br>
Laboratories. ROCALTROL is available in the form of capsules containing 0.25<br>
and 0.5 µ.g calcitriol and as an oral solution containing 1 ug/mL of calcitriol. All<br>
dosage forms contain butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated<br>
hydroxytoluene (BHT) as anioxidants. The capsules also contain a fractionated<br>
triglyceride of coconut oil and the oral solution contains a fractionated<br>
triglyceride of palm seed oi. (Physician's Desk Reference, 54th Edition, pp<br>
2649-2651, Medical Economics Company, Inc., Montvale, NJ (2000)).<br>
[0007J It is known that calctriol is light-sensitive and is especially prone to<br>
oxidation. Moreover, calcitiol and other active vitamin D compounds are<br>
lipophilic, meaning that they are soluble in lipids and some organic solvents,<br>
while being substantially insoluble or only sparsely soluble in water. Because of<br>
the lipophilic nature of active vitamin D compounds, the dispersion of such<br>
compounds in aqueous solutions, such as the gastric fluids of the stomach, is<br>
significantly limited. Accordngly, the pharmacokinetic parameters of active<br>
vitamin D compound formulations heretofore described in the art are sub-optimal<br>
for use with high dose pulse administration regimens. In addition, the active<br>
vitamin D compound formulalions that are currently available tend to exhibit<br>
substantial variability of absorption in the small intestine. Moreover, for oral<br>
administration, the relationship between dosage and blood concentration that is<br>
observed with most active vitamin D compound formulations is not linear; that<br>
is, the quantity of compound ab sorbed into the blood stream does not correlate<br>
with the amount of compound that is administered in a given dose, especially at<br>
higher dosage levels.<br>
[0008] Thus, there is a need for improved pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising active vitamin D com pounds, particularly in the context of pulse-dose<br>
treatment regimens that are designed to provide anti-proliferative (e.g., anti-<br>
cancer) benefits while avoiding the consequence of hypercalcemia. In particular,<br>
a need exists in the art for a pharmaceutical composition comprising an active<br>
vitamin D compound that remain; stable over prolonged periods of time, even at<br>
elevated temperatures, while at the same time exhibiting improved<br>
pharmacokinetic parameters for the active vitamin D compound, and reduced<br>
variability in absorption, when ad ministered to a patient.<br>
[0013] The emulsions produced from the emulsion pre-concentrates of the<br>
present invention (upon dilution with water) include both emulsions as<br>
conventionally understood by those of ordinary skill in the art (i.e., a dispersion<br>
of an organic phase in water), is well as "sub-micron droplet emulsions" (i.e.,<br>
dispersions of an organic phase in water wherein the average diameter of the<br>
dispersion particles is less than 000 nm.)<br>
[0014] According to another aspect of the invention, methods are provided for the<br>
preparation of emulsion pre-concentrates comprising active vitamin D<br>
compounds. The methods encompassed within this aspect of the invention<br>
comprise bringing an active vitanin D compound, e.g., calcitriol, into intimate<br>
admixture with a lipophilic phase component and with one or more surfactants,<br>
and optionally, with a hydrophilic phase component.<br>
[0015] In yet another aspect of the invention, methods are provided for the<br>
treatment and prevention of hyperproliferative diseases such as cancer and<br>
psoriasis, said methods comprising administering an active vitamin D compound<br>
in an emulsion pre-concentrate formulation to a patient in need thereof.<br>
Alternatively, the active vitamin D compound can be administered in an emulsion<br>
formulation that is made by diluting an emulsion pre-concentrate of the present<br>
invention with an appropriate quantity of water. In a preferred embodiment of<br>
this aspect of the invention, the administration of the active vitamin D compound<br>
to a patient is accomplished by using, e.g., a pulse dosing regimen. For example,<br>
according to this aspect of the invention, an active vitamin D compound in an<br>
emulsion pre-concentrate formula ion is administered to a patient no more than<br>
once every three days at a dose of at least 0.12 µg/kg per day.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0022] The present invention is directed to pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising active vitamin D compounds in emulsion pre-concentrate<br>
formulations. The compositions c f the invention meet or substantially reduce the<br>
difficulties associated with active vitamin D compound therapy hitherto<br>
encountered in the art including, in particular, undesirable pharmacokinetic<br>
parameters of the compound upor administration to a patient.<br>
[0023] It has been found that the compositions of the invention permit the<br>
preparation of semi-solid and liquid compositions containing an active vitamin<br>
D compound in sufficiently high concentration to permit, e.g., convenient oral<br>
administration, while at the same time achieving improved pharmacokinetic<br>
parameters for the active vitamin D compound. For example, as compared to<br>
ROCALTROL, the compositions of the present invention exhibit a Cmax that is at<br>
least 1.5 to two times greater than the Cmax that is observed with ROCALTROL,<br>
and a shorter Tmax than that which is observed with ROCALTROL. Preferably,<br>
the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention provide a Cmax of at<br>
least about 900 pg/mL plasma, more preferably about 900 to about 3000 pg/mL<br>
plasma, more preferably about 1500 to about 3000 pg/mL plasma. In addition,<br>
the compositions of the invention preferably provide a Tmax of less than about 6.0<br>
hours, more preferably about 1.0 to about 3.0 hours, more preferably about 1.5 to<br>
about 2.0 hours. In addition, the compositions of the invention preferably provide<br>
a T1/2 of less than about 25 hours, more preferably about 2 to about 10 hours,<br>
more preferably about 5 to about 9 hours.<br>
[0024] The term Cmax is defined as the maximum concentration of active vitamin<br>
D compound achieved in the serum following administration of the drug. The<br>
term Tmax is defined as the time at which CmiU is achieved. The term T1/2 is<br>
defined as the time required for the concentration of active vitamin D compound<br>
in the serum to decrease by half. ' the disclosed values for pharmacokinetic data<br>
apply to the population of recipients of a composition comprising an active<br>
vitamin D compound as a whole, not individual recipients. Thus, any individual<br>
receiving a composition of the pre sent invention may not necessarily achieve the<br>
preferred pharmacokinetic parameters. However, when a composition of the<br>
present invention is administered to a sufficiently large population of subjects, the<br>
pharmacokinetic parameters will approximately match the values disclosed<br>
herein.<br>
[0025] According to one aspect of the present invention, a pharmaceutical<br>
composition is provided comprisin g (a) a lipophilic phase component, (b) one or<br>
more surfactants, (c) an active vitamin D compound; wherein said composition<br>
is an emulsion pre-concentrate, which upon dilution with water, in a water to<br>
composition ratio of about 1:1 or more of said water, forms an emulsion having<br>
an absorbance of greater than 0.3 at 400 nm. The pharmaceutical composition of<br>
the invention may further comprise a hydrophilic phase component.<br>
[0026] In another aspect of the invention, a pharmaceutical emulsion composition<br>
is provided comprising water (o • other aqueous solution) and an emulsion pre-<br>
concentrate.<br>
[0027J The term "emulsion pre-concentrate," as used herein, is intended to mean<br>
a system capable of providing an emulsion upon contacting with, e.g., water. The<br>
term "emulsion," as used herein., is intended to mean a colloidal dispersion<br>
comprising water and organic components including hydrophobic (lipophilic)<br>
organic components. The term "emulsion" is intended to encompass both<br>
conventional emulsions, as understood by those skilled in the art, as well as "sub-<br>
micron droplet emulsions," as defined immediately below.<br>
[0028] The term "sub-micron droplet emulsion," as used herein is intended to<br>
mean a dispersion comprising water and organic components including<br>
hydrophobic (lipophilic) organic components, wherein the droplets or particles<br>
formed from the organic components have an average maximum dimension of<br>
less than about 1000 nm.<br>
[0029] Sub-micron droplet emuls ions are identifiable as possessing one or more<br>
of the following characteristics. They are formed spontaneously or substantially<br>
spontaneously when their components are brought into contact, that is without<br>
substantial energy supply, e.g., in the absence of heating or the use of high shear<br>
equipment or other substantial agitation.<br>
[0030] The particles of a sub-micron droplet emulsion may be spherical, though<br>
other structures are feasible, e.g. liquid crystals with lamellar, hexagonal or<br>
isotropic symmetries. Generally, sub-micron droplet emulsions comprise droplets<br>
or particles having a maximum dimension (e.g., average diameter) of between<br>
about 50 nm to about 1000 nm, and preferably between about 200 nm to about<br>
300 nm.<br>
[0031] The term "pharmaceutical composition" as used herein is to be understood<br>
as defining compositions of which the individual components or ingredients are<br>
themselves pharmaceutically acceptable, e.g., where oral administration is<br>
foreseen, acceptable for oral use and, where topical administration is foreseen,<br>
topically acceptable.<br>
(0032] The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention will generally<br>
form an emulsion upon dilution with water. The emulsion will form according<br>
to the present invention upon the dilution of an emulsion pre-concentrate with<br>
water in a water to composition ratio of about 1:1 or more of said water.<br>
According to the present invention, the ratio of water to composition can be, e.g.,<br>
between 1:1 and 5000:1. For ex unple, the ratio of water to composition can be<br>
about 1:1,2:1, 3:1,4:1,5:1,10:1,200:1, 300:1, 500:1,1000:1, or 5000:1. The<br>
skilled artisan will be able to readily ascertain the particular ratio of water to<br>
composition that is appropriate for any given situation or circumstance.<br>
(0033] According to the present invention, upon dilution of said emulsion pre-<br>
concentrate with water, an emulsion will form having an absorbance of greater<br>
than 0.3 at 400 ran. The absorbance at 400 nm of the emulsions formed upon<br>
1:100 dilution of the emulsion pie-concentrates of the present invention can be,<br>
e.g., between 0.3 and 4.0. For example, the absorbance at 400 nm can "be, e.g.,<br>
about 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 1.0, 1.2, 1.6 2.0, 2.2, 2.4, 2.5, 3.0, or 4.0. Methods for<br>
determining the absorbance of a iquid solution are well known by those in the<br>
art. The skilled artisan will be able to ascertain and adjust the relative proportions<br>
of the ingredients of the emulsior s pre-concentrates of the invention in order to<br>
obtain, upon dilution with water, an emulsion having any particular absorbance<br>
encompassed within the scope of the invention.<br>
[0034] The pharmaceutical compsitions of the present invention can be, e.g., in<br>
a semi-solid formulation or in a liquid formulation. Semi-solid formulations of<br>
the present invention can be any semi-solid formulation known by those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art, including, e.g., gels, pastes, creams and ointments.<br>
[0035] The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a<br>

and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0050] Suitable lipophilic surfactants for use in the present pharmaceutical<br>
compounds also include trans-esterification products of natural vegetable oil<br>
triglycerides and polyalkylene polyols. Such trans-esterification products are<br>
known in the art and may be obtained e.g., in accordance with the general<br>
procedures described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,288,824. They include trans-esterification<br>
products of various natural (e.g., non-hydrogenated) vegetable oils for example,<br>
maize oil, kernel oil, almond oil, ground nut oil, olive oil and palm oil and<br>
mixtures thereof with polyethylene glycols, in particular polyethylene glycols<br>
having an average molecular weight of from 200 to 800. Preferred are products<br>
obtained by trans-esterification of 2 molar parts of a natural vegetable oil<br>
triglyceride with one molar part of polyethylene glycol (e.g., having an average<br>
molecular weight of from 200 to 800). Various forms of trans-esterification<br>
products of the defined class are known and commercially available under the<br>
trade name LABRAFIL.<br>
[0051 ] Additional lipophilic sur factants that are suitable for use with the present<br>
pharmaceutical compositions nclude oil-soluble vitamin derivatives, e.g.,<br>
tocopherol PEG-1000 succinate ("vitamin E TPGS").<br>
[0052] Also suitable as lipophilic surfactants for use in the present<br>
pharmaceutical compounds are mono-, di- and mono/di-glycerides, especially<br>
esterification products of capryli c or capric acid with glycerol; sorbitan fatty acid<br>

comprising sitosterol, campesterol or stigmasterol, and ethylene oxide adducts<br>
thereof, for example soya sterols and derivatives thereof.<br>
[0053] It is understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that several<br>
commercial surfactant compositions contain small to moderate amounts of<br>
triglycerides, typically as a resul t of incomplete reaction of a triglyceride starting<br>
material in, for example, a trans- esterification reaction. Thus, the surfactants that<br>
are suitable for use in the present pharmaceutical compositions include those<br>
surfactants that contain a triglyceride. Examples of commercial surfactant<br>
compositions containing triglycerides include some members of the surfactant<br>
families GELUCIRES, MAISINES, AND IMWITORS. Specific examples of<br>
these compounds are GELUCIRE 44/14 (saturated polyglycolized glycerides);<br>
GELUCIRE 50/13 (saturated polyglycolized glycerides); GELUCIRE 53/10<br>
(saturated polyglycolized glycerides); GELUCIRE 33/01 (semi-synthetic<br>
triglycerides of C8 -C18 saturatec fatty acids); GELUCIRE 39/01 (semi-synthetic<br>
glycerides); other GELUCIRE, such as 37/06,43/01,35/10,37/02,46/07,48/09,<br>
50/02, 62/05, etc.; MAISINE 85-I (linoleic glycerides); and IMWITOR 742<br>
(caprylic/capric glycerides). (See U.S. Patent No. 6,267,985).<br>
[0054] Still other commercial surfactant compositions having significant<br>
triglyceride content are known to those skilled in the art. It should be appreciated<br>
that such compositions, which contain triglycerides as well as surfactants, may<br>
be suitable to provide all or part of the lipophilic phase component of the of the<br>
present invention, as well as all or part of the surfactants.<br>
[00S5] The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention also comprise<br>
an active vitamin D compound. The term "active vitamin D compound," as used<br>
herein, is intended to refer to vitamin D which has been hydroxylated in at least<br>
the carbon-1 position of the A ring, e.g., 1a-hydroxyvitamin D3. The preferred<br>
active vitamin D compound in relation to the composition of the present<br>
invention is l a,25-hydroxyvitaminD3, also known as calcitriol. A large number<br>
of other active vitamin D compounds are known and can be used in the practice<br>
of the invention. Examples include la-hydroxy derivatives with a 17 side chain<br>
greater in length than the cholesterol or ergosterol side chains (see U.S. Patent<br>
No. 4,717,721); cyclopentano-vitamin D analogs (see U.S. Patent No. 4,851,401);<br>

(0056] The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may further<br>
comprise one or more additives. Additives that are well known in the art include,<br>
e.g., detackifiers, anti-foaming agents, buffering agents, antioxidants {e.g.,<br>
ascorbyl palmitate, butyl hydroxy anisole (BHA), butyl hydroxy toluene (BHT)<br>
and tocopherols, e.g., a-tocopherol (vitamin E)), preservatives, chelating agents,<br>
viscomodulators, toniciflers, flavorants, colorants odorants, opacifiers,<br>
suspending agents, binders, fillers, plasticizers, lubricants, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The amounts of such additives can be readily determined by one skilled in the art,<br>
according to the particular properties desired.<br>
|0057] The additive may also comprise a thickening agent. Suitable thickening<br>
agents may be of those known and employed in the art, including, e.g.,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable polymeric materials and inorganic thickening agents.<br>
Exemplary thickening agents for use in the; present pharmaceutical compositions<br>

including hydrophilic silicon dioxide products, e.g., alkylated (for example<br>
methylated) silica gels, in partic alar colloidal silicon dioxide products.<br>
[0058] Such thickening agents as described above may be included, e.g., to<br>
provide a sustained release effect. However, where oral administration is<br>
intended, the use of thickening agents as aforesaid will generally not be required<br>
and is generally less preferred. Use of thickening agents is, on the other hand,<br>
indicated, e.g., where topical application is foreseen.<br>
(0059] Compositions in accordance with the present invention may be employed<br>
for administration in any appropriate manner, e.g., orally, e.g., in unit dosage<br>
form, for example in a solution in hard or soft encapsulated form including<br>
gelatin encapsulated form, e.g., parenterally or topically, e.g., for application to<br>
the skin, for example in the form of a cream, paste, lotion, gel, ointment, poultice,<br>
cataplasm, plaster, dermal patch or the like, or for ophthalmic application, for<br>
example in the form of an eye-drop, -lotion or-gel formulation. Readily flowable<br>
forms, for example solutions and emulsions, may also be employed e.g., for<br>
intralesional injection, or may the administered rectally, e.g., as an enema.<br>
(0060] When the composition of the present invention is formulated in unit<br>
dosage form, the active vitamin D compound will preferably be present in an<br>
amount of between 10 and 75 µg per unit dose. More preferably, the amount of<br>
active vitamin D compound per unit dose will be about 10 µg, 15 µg, 20 µg, 25<br>
µg, 30 µg, 35 µg, 40 µg, 45 µg, 50 µg, 55 µg, 60 µg, 65 µg, 70 µg, or 75 µg.<br>
[0061] When the unit dosage form of the composition is a capsule, the total<br>
quantity of ingredients present n the capsule is preferably about 10-1000 µL.<br>
More preferably, the total quantity of ingredients present in the capsule is about<br>
100-300 µL.<br>
[0062] The relative proportion or ingredients in the compositions of the invention<br>
will, of course, vary considerably depending on the particular type of composition<br>
concerned. The relative proportions will also vary depending on the particular<br>
function of ingredients in the composition. The relative proportions will also vary<br>
depending on the particular ingredients employed and the desired physical<br>
characteristics of the product composition, e.g., in the case of a composition for<br>
topical use, whether this is to be a free flowing liquid or a paste. Determination<br>
of workable proportions in any particular instance will generally be within the<br>
capability of a person of ordinary skill in the art. All indicated proportions and<br>
relative weight ranges described below are accordingly to be understood as being<br>
indicative of preferred or individually inventive teachings only and not as not<br>
limiting the invention in its broacest aspect.<br>
[0063] The lipophilic phase component of the invention will suitably be present<br>
in an amount of from about 30% to about 90% by weight based upon the total<br>
weight of the composition. Preferably, the lipophilic phase component is present<br>
in an amount of from about 50% to about 85% by weight based upon the total<br>
weight of the composition.<br>
[0064] The surfactant or surfactants of the invention will suitably be present in<br>
an amount of from about 1 % to 50% by weight based upon the total weight of the<br>
composition. Preferably, the su rfactant(s) is present in an amount of from about<br>
5% to about 40% by weight based upon the total weight of the composition.<br>
[0065] The amount of active vitamin D compound in compositions of the<br>
invention will of course vary, e.g., depending on the intended route of<br>
administration and to what extent other components are present. In general,<br>
however, the active vitamin D compound of the invention will suitably be present<br>
in an amount of from about 0.005 % to 20% by weight based upon the total weight<br>
of the composition. Preferably, :he active vitamin D compound is present in an<br>
amount of from about 0.01% to 15% by weight based upon the total weight of<br>
the composition.<br>
[0066] The hydrophilic phase component of the invention will suitably be present<br>
in an amount of from about 2% to about 20% by weight based upon the total<br>
weight of the composition. Preferably, the hydrophilic phase component is<br>
present in an amount of from about 5% to 15% by weight based upon the total<br>
weight of the composition.<br>
[0067] The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be in a semisolid<br>
formulation. Semisolid formulations within the scope of the invention may<br>
comprise, e.g., a lipophilic phase component present in an amount of from about<br>
60% to about 80% by weight bas ;d upon the total weight of the composition, a<br>
surfactant present in an amount of from about 5% to about 35% by weight based<br>
upon the total weight of the composition, and an active vitamin D compound<br>
present in an amount of from about 0.01% to about 15% by weight based upon<br>
the total weight of the composition<br>
[0068] The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be in a liquid<br>
formulation. Liquid formulations within the scope of the invention may<br>
comprise, e.g., a lipophilic phase component present in an amount of from about<br>
50% to about 60% by weight based upon the total weight of the composition, a<br>
surfactant present in an amount of from about 4% to about 25% by weight based<br>
upon the total weight of the composition, an active vitamin D compound present<br>
in an amount of from about 0.01% to about 15% by weight based upon the total<br>
weight of the composition, and a hydrophilic phase component present in an<br>
amount of from about 5% to about 10% by weight based upon the total weight of<br>
the composition.<br>
[0069] In addition to the foregoing the present invention also provides a process<br>
for the production of a pharmaceutical composition as hereinbefore defined,<br>
which process comprises bringing the individual components thereof into<br>
intimate admixture and, when required, compounding the obtained composition<br>
in unit dosage form, for example filling said composition into gelatin, e.g., soft<br>
or hard gelatin, capsules, or non -gelatin capsules.<br>
[0070] In a more particular embodiment, the invention provides a process for the<br>
preparation of a pharmaceutica composition, which process comprises bringing<br>
an active vitamin D compourd, e.g., calcitriol, into close admixture with a<br>
lipophilic phase component and a surfactant as hereinbefore defined, the relative<br>
proportion of the lipophilic phase component and the surfactant being selected<br>
relative to the quantity of active vitamin D compound employed, such that an<br>
emulsion pre-concentrate is obtained.<br>
[0071] The present invention also provides methods for the treatment and<br>
prevention of hyperproliferative diseases such as cancer and psoriasis, said<br>
methods comprising administering an active vitamin D compound in an emulsion<br>
pre-concentrate formulation to a patient in need thereof. Alternatively, the active<br>
vitamin D compound can be administered in an emulsion formulation that is<br>
made by diluting an emulsion pre-concentrate of the present invention with an<br>
appropriate quantity of water.<br>
[0072] Cancers which can be treated with the formulations of the invention<br>
include any cancer treatable by an active vitamin D compound. Such cancers<br>
include without limitation cancers of the prostate, breast, colon, lung, head and<br>
neck, pancreas, endometrium, bladder, cervix, ovaries, squamous cell carcinoma,<br>
renal cell carcinoma, myeloid and lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoma, medullary<br>
thyroid carcinoma, melanoma, multiple myeloma, retinoblastoma and sarcomas<br>
of the soft tissues and bone.<br>
|0073] Preferably, the cancers are treated according to the pulse dose protocols<br>
disclosed in WO 99/49870. In this embodiment, the formulations are<br>
administered no more than once every three days, more preferably, no more than<br>
once a week, more preferably, 10 more than once every ten days. Preferably,<br>
about 5 to about 100 µg of calcitriol, more preferably, about 10 to 60 µg, more<br>
preferably, about 40-50 µg of calcitriol, or an equivalent amount of another active<br>
vitamin D compound, is administered to an animal in need thereof.<br>
[0074] Animals which may be treated according to the present invention include<br>
all animals which may benefit from administration of the formulations of the<br>
present invention. Such animals include humans, pets such as dogs and cats, and<br>
veterinary animals such as cows, pigs, sheep, goats and the like.<br>
(0075] The following examples are illustrative, but not limiting, of the method<br>
and compositions of the presen invention. Other suitable modifications and<br>
adaptations of the variety of conditions and parameters normally encountered in<br>
clinical therapy and which are obvious to those skilled in the art are within the<br>
spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Relative Chemical Compatibility of Calcitriol With Selected Components<br>
[0076] In this example, the relative chemical compatibility of calcitriol with<br>
selected lipophilic, hydrophilic and surfactant components was evaluated by<br>
measuring the percent recovery of; ntact calcitriol after storage at 40°C and 60°C.<br>
Calcitriol recovery was determined based on analyses of high-pressure liquid<br>
chromatography (HPLC). The results are presented in Table 1.<br>
(0077] The recovery data suggest that the most compatible components are<br>
Miglyol 812 (with or without BHT and BHA), Labrafac CC and Captex 200 in<br>
the lipophilic component group propylene glycol in the hydrophilic group, and<br>
vitamin E TPGS and GELUCIRE 44/14 in the surfactant group.<br>

[0081] One hundred gram quanti ties of the four liquid calcitriol formulations (LI -<br>
L4) and the five semi-solid calcitriol formulations (SS1-SS5) listed in Tables 2<br>
and 3, respectively, were prepared as follows.<br>
[0082] The listed ingredients, except for calcitriol, were combined in a suitable<br>
glass container and mixed until homogeneous. Vitamin E TPGS and GELUCIRE<br>
44/14 were heated and homogerized at 60°C prior to weighing and adding into<br>
the formulation.<br>
2. Preparation of Active Formulations<br>
[0083] The semi-solid vehicles were heated and homogenized at = 60°C. Under<br>
subdued light, 12 ± 1 mg of calcitriol was weighed out into separate glass bottles<br>
with screw caps, one bottle for each formulation. (Calcitriol is light-sensitive;<br>
subdued light/red light should be used when working with calcitriol/calcitriol<br>
formulations.) The exact weight was recorded to 0.1 mg. The caps were then<br>
placed on the bottles as soon as the calcitriol had been placed into the bottles.<br>
Next, the amount of each vehic e required to bring the concentration to 0.208<br>
mg/g was calculated using the following formula:<br>
Cw/0.208 = required weight of vehicle<br>
Where Cw = weight of calcitriol, in mg, and<br>
0.208 = final concentration of calcitriol (mg/g).<br>
[0084] Finally, the appropriate amount of each vehicle was added to the<br>
respective bottle containing the culcitriol. The formulations were heated (s 60°C)<br>
while being mixed to dissolve the calcitriol<br>
III. Stability of Calcitriol For mulations<br>
[0085] The rune calcitriol formulations (L1-L4 and SS1-SS5) were analyzed for<br>
stability of the calcitriol component at three different temperatures. Sample of<br>
the nine formulations were each placed at 25°C, 40°C, and 60°C. Samples from<br>
all three temperatures for all nine formulations were analyzed by HPLC after 1,<br>
2 and 3 weeks. In addition, samp] es from the 60°C experiment were analyzed by<br>
HPLC after 9 weeks. The percent of the initial calcitriol concentration remaining<br>
at each time point was determined for each sample and is reported in Table 4<br>
(liquid formulations) and Table 5 (semi-solid formulations).<br>
[0086] As illustrated by Tables 4 and 5, calcitriol remained relatively stable with<br>
very little degradation in all of the formulations (liquid and semi-solid) analyzed.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Appearance and UV/Visible Absorption Study of Calcitriol Formulations<br>
[0087] Calcitriol formulations L1 and SS3 were prepared prior to this study and<br>
stored at room temperature protected from light. Table 6 below shows the<br>
quantities of ingredients used to prepare the formulations.<br>
[0088] The formulations were w armed to 55°C prior to use. Both formulations<br>
(liquid #1 and semi-solid #3) were mixed well with a vortex mixer and appeared<br>
as clear liquids. Each calcitriol formulation (=250 µL) was added to a 25 mL<br>
volumetric flask. The exact weigh ts added were 249.8 mg for Liquid-1 and 252.6<br>
mg for semi-solid #3. Upon contact with the glass, the semi-solid-3 formulation<br>
became solidified. Deionized wa;er was then added to the 25 mL mark and the<br>
solutions were mixed with a vortex mixer until uniform. The appearance was<br>
observed at this point and the absorbance of the resulting mixtures at 400 nm was<br>
determined by UV/visible spectrophotometry. Deionized water was used as a<br>
blank and the measurements were taken at 400 nm. Each sample was measured<br>
10 times over a period of 10 minutes. The results are summarized in Table 7.<br>
Both formulations formed were w lite and opaque.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Diameter of Emulsion Droplets Formed From the Liquid and Semi-Solid<br>
Formulation Vehicles (without calcitriol)<br>
[0089] In this example, the average diameter of emulsion droplets was measured<br>
after dilution of the liquid (L1-14) and semi-solid (SS1-SS5) emulsion pre-<br>
concentrate vehicles (not containing calcitriol) with simulated gastric fluid (SGF)<br>
lacking enzyme. The average dianeter of the droplets was determined based on<br>
light scattering measurements. The appearance of the pre-concentrates and the<br>
resulting emulsions, determined by visual inspection, was also noted. The results<br>
are summarized in Table 8.<br>
[0090] From the results presented above, it is concluded that the droplets<br>
(particles) formed from the emulsion preconcentrate formulations were of sub-<br>
micron droplet size despite having an opaque appearance.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Diameter of Emulsion Droplets Formed From Liquid and Semi-Solid<br>
Calcitriol Formulation<br>
[0091 ] In this example, the average diameter of emulsion droplets was measured<br>
after dilution of the liquid #1 (L1) and semi-solid #3 (SS3) emulsion pre-<br>
concentrates in simulated gastric fluid (SGF) without enzyme. The formulations<br>
used in this example contained calcitriol at a concentration of 0.2 mg calcitriol/g<br>
of formulation. The diameter of the droplets was determined based on light<br>
scattering measurements. The appearance of the resulting emulsions, determined<br>
by visual inspection, was also noted. The results are summarized in Table 9.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
In Vitro Dispersion of Calcitriol From Emulsion Pre-Concentrates<br>
[0092] In this Example, the extent of calcitriol dispersion in various formulations<br>
in gelatin capsules was determined. A single capsule containing 250 mg of a<br>
calcitriol formulation in a size-2 gelatin capsule (each capsule containing 0.2mg<br>
calcitriol/g formulation) was added to 200 mL of simulated gastric fluid (SGF)<br>
without enzyme at 37°C and was mixed by a paddle at 200 RPM. Samples were<br>
then filtered through a 5 µm filter and analyzed for calcitriol concentration at 30,<br>
60, 90, and 120 minutes by HPLC. The results are shown in Table 10.<br>
TABLE 10: Percent Calcitriol Obtained in Filtrate After Dispersion in SGF<br>
and Filtration Through a 5 µm Filter<br>
[0093] As this Example illustrates, the dispersion of calcitriol in simulated gastric<br>
fluid from capsules containing either the L1 or the SS3 formulations was much<br>
more extensive than that which was observed with capsules containing the<br>
Comparison Formulation (which is similar to the ROCALTROL formulation<br>
available from Roche Laboratories).<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
Plasma Concentrations ar d Pharmacokinetics of Calcitriol in Dogs<br>
[0094] A pharmacokinetics study in dogs compared the plasma levels of calcitriol<br>
after administration of 1.0 µg/kg using 3 different formulations: ROCALTROL,<br>
a liquid formulation (liquid #1, and a semi-solid formulation (semi-solid #3).<br>
Four dogs received 1.0 µg/kg orally of ROCALTROL, the semi-solid<br>
formulation, or the liquid formulation. When dogs were used for more than one<br>
formulation a minimum 7-day washout period separated dosing with each<br>
formulation.<br>
[0095] Blood samples were obtained pre-dose, and 0.5, 1,2,4, 6, 8, 10,12,24,<br>
36, and 48 hours post-dose for analysis of calcitriol levels. Blood samples for<br>
clinical chemistry were obtained pre-dose, and at 24 and 48 hours post-dose for<br>
the ROCALTROL group; samples were obtained pre-dose, and at 4, 24,48, 72,<br>
96, and 120 hours for the semi-solid and liquid formulations. Samples were<br>
analyzed for calcitriol by radioimmunoassay and subjected to pharmacokinetics<br>
analyses.<br>
[0096] Plasma concentrations of calcitriol over time for the three formulations<br>
are shown graphically in Figure 1.<br>
[0097] A summary of the pharmacokinetics of calcitriol as one of three different<br>
formulations at a common dose of 1.0 µg/kg is presented in Tables 11-14.<br>
[0098] The results of this study show that there were some differences and<br>
similarities in the pharmacokinetics between these particular inventive<br>
formulations and ROCALTROL as follows:<br>
• Cma)t was approximately three times higher with the liquid and semi-solid<br>
formulations than with the ROCALTROL formulation.<br>
• Cmax was achieved sooner (1 to 2 hours) with the liquid and semi-solid<br>
formulations than with the ROCALTROL formulation (2 to 4 hours).<br>
• The overall systemic exposure (AUC0.00 )was comparable with the three<br>
formulations, although systemic exposure in the first 24-48 hours was<br>
greater with the liquid and semi-solid formulations than with<br>
ROCALTROL.<br>
[0099] The foregoing results show that the liquid #1 formulation produces the<br>
highest Cmax and the largest AUC calcitriol values, followed closely by the semi-<br>
solid #3 formulation. The ROCALTROL formulation has the lowest Cmax and<br>
AUC values. It appears that the liquid #1 and semi-solid #3 formulations were<br>
absorbed much faster and produced higher plasma concentration during the first<br>
twelve hours and a faster rate of elimination.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
Pharmacokinetics of the Semi-Solid #3 Formulation After Escalating Doses<br>
[0100] In this study the pharmacokinetics of the semi-solid formulation after<br>
escalating oral doses was studiec in dogs. Three male and three female Beagle<br>
dogs were dosed orally with single doses of 0.5 jig/kg (all six dogs), 0.1 ug/kg (1<br>
male and 1 female), 5.0 µg/kg (2 males and 2 females), and 10.0 µg/kg (all dogs).<br>
After the 10.0 µg/kg dose, 2 dogs per sex were euthanized. The remaining male<br>
and female dogs continued on study and received doses of 30.0 µg/kg and 100.0<br>
µg/kg. After each dose the aninnls were held for a 6-day recovery period.<br>
[0101] Blood samples (approximately 1 mL) were collected from each dog pre-<br>
dose and at 0, 2 (in all but the 0.5 µg/kg dose), 4, 8, 24, 48, and 96 hours<br>
following dose administration. Samples: were analyzed for calcitriol by<br>
radioimmunoassay and subjected to pharmacokinetic analyses. Plasma<br>
concentrations of calcitriol are shown graphically for males and females in<br>
Figs. 2A and 2B.<br>
[0102] After dosing with semi-sol id #3, maximum plasma concentrations usually<br>
occurred at the two hour sampling timepoint. At doses above 0.1 µg/kg, plasma<br>
concentrations appeared to decline at a more rapid rate during the first 8 hours<br>
than during the 24 to 96 hour time period.<br>
[0103] At the lowest dose of 0.1 µg/kg, plasma concentrations of calcitriol fell<br>
below the limit of quantitation after 24 hours. At 0.5 µg/kg and above,<br>
measurable concentrations of calcitriol persisted at the 96 hour sampling<br>
timepoint. There did not appear to be any remarkable differences between the<br>
male and the female dogs.<br>
[0104] Pharmacokinetic parameters for semi-solid #3 at doses ranging from 0.1<br>
to 100.0 µg/kg are summarized in Table 15.<br>
[0105] These pharmacokinetic results indicate the following:<br>
• The systemic exposure of calcitriol appeared to be fairly linear throughout<br>
the tested dose range of 0 1 to 100.0 µg/kg. No saturation of absorption<br>
was observed.<br>
• The half-life of calcitriol appeared to be dose-dependent. Formulations<br>
having a half life of greater than 24 hours are less suitable for high dose<br>
pulse administration.<br>
• Weekly dosing with semi-solid #3 at 5.0 µg/kg and above resulted in<br>
some accumulation in the plasma. Accumulation was not consistently<br>
observed at the lower doses of 0.1 and 0.5 µg/kg.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
A 28 Day Oral Toxicity Study in Dogs with Semi-Solid #3<br>
[0106] In this study a 28-day repeated dose toxicology study of semi-solid #3 was<br>
conducted in dogs to assess the pharmacokinetics of calcitriol after weekly oral<br>
capsule dosing. Semi-solid #3 or control article capsules were administered on<br>
study days 0,7,14,21, and 28. Twelve dogs (6 male, 6 female) received vehicle<br>
control (group 1), eight dogs (4 m ale, 4 female) received 0.1 µg/kg semi-solid #3<br>
(group 2), and eight dogs (4 male, 4 female) received 1.0 µg/kg semi-solid #3<br>
(group 3). Twelve dogs (6 male, 5 female) received 30.0 µg/kg semi-solid #3 on<br>
day 0 (group 4). Due to the severity of the clinical response observed after the<br>
first 30 µg/kg dose on day 0, dose levels were reduced in this group to 10 µg/kg<br>
(males on days 7,14,21, and 28) or 5 µg/kg (females on days 7,14,21, and 28).<br>
Blood samples were collected on each dog pre-dose and at 1,2,4,6,8,24, and 48<br>
hours following dosing on study days 0 (first dose) and 21 (fourth weekly dose).<br>
All animals were sacrificed on study day 29.<br>
[0107] The pharmacokinetic results for plasma calcitriol for groups 2-4 are<br>
summarized in Table 16.<br>
[0108] Figs. 3A and 3B show the adjusted plasma concentration-time curve for<br>
calcitriol after oral capsule dosing with semi-solid #3 on study days 0 and 21 in<br>
male (Fig. 3A) and female (Fig. 3B) Beagle dogs. Calcitriol values at time 0 on<br>
day 0 were subtracted from all subsequent timepoints to adjust for endogenous<br>
(baseline) plasma calcitriol<br>
[0109J The results of the study indicate that following:<br>
• After oral capsule dosing with semi-solid #3, plasma concentrations of<br>
calcitriol rose fairly rapidly, reaching peak plasma concentrations within<br>
two hours.<br>
• Plasma concentrations o f calcitriol decreased at a more rapid rate during<br>
the first 8 hours post-dosing than during the later timepoints (24-48<br>
hours), possibly indicating redistribution of calcitriol to extravascular<br>
spaces, with subsequent slow release of calcitriol back into the vascular<br>
spaces. This observation was more apparent at the higher dose levels than<br>
at the lower dose levels.<br>
• At 24 hours post-dosing, plasma concentration of calcitriol had declined<br>
to near-baseline values at the low dose of 0.1 µg/kg. However, at the<br>
higher doses of calcitriol, dose-related residual concentrations of calcitriol<br>
were still evident at the last sampling timepoint (48 hours), although all<br>
values returned to pre-dose (baseline) values by one week post-dosing.<br>
• Values for Cmax and AUC were fairly proportional to dose throughout the<br>
dose range tested (0.1-30 0 µg/kg).<br>
• Values for AUCo.24 at the low dose, which was the no observable adverse<br>
effect level (0.1 µg/kg) ranged from 1840.6 - 3283.0 pg-hr/mL.<br>
• Values for AUC0-24 at the mid dose, which was the maximum tolerated<br>
dose (1.0 µg/kg) ranged from 12,947.3 -23,259.7 pghr/mL.<br>
• Values for AUC0-24 at doses associated with weight loss and moderate<br>
signs of toxicity, ranged fiom 46,878.1 pg-hr/mL(5.0 µg/kg; females) to<br>
173,597.2pghr/mL(10.0 µg/kg; males).<br>
• Values for AUC0.24 at a dose associated with mortality (30.0 µg/kg)<br>
ranged from 323,573.1 - 496,044.6 pg-hr/mL.<br>
• There were no consistent sex differences in any pharmacokinetic<br>
parameter.<br>
(0110] Overall, the animals appeared to handle calcitriol similarly after the first<br>
dose and after repeated once-weeky dosing, with a few exceptions such as higher<br>
values for Cmax and AUC on Day 0 compared to Day 21 in the 1.0 µg/kg females<br>
(not evident in the males).<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
Acute Toxicity Stucy of Three Different Formulations<br>
[0111 ] In the study described in Example 7, several in-life parameters, including<br>
clinical chemistry parameters, vere monitored to assess the toxicity of the<br>
calcitriol formulations. Blood simples were analyzed for calcium, phosphorus,<br>
blood urea nitrogen (BUN), glucose, albumin, bilirubin (total), aspartate<br>
aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase<br>
(AP), and creatinine.<br>
[0112] No clinical toxicity was seen in any dog with any of the three<br>
formulations.<br>
[0113] Hypercalcemia was seer after dosing with 1.0 µg/kg with all three<br>
formulations. The group mean and the individual range of serum calcium levels<br>
of each of the three different formulations are presented in Table 17.<br>
[0114) In addition to elevations of calcium, elevations of ALT, AST, BUN, and<br>
creatinine were observed in all groups.<br>
[0115) In summary, the results of this study indicated that:<br>
• No treatment-related clinical signs were evident in any dog after dosing<br>
with any of the formula ions (ROCALTROL, liquid, or semi-solid).<br>
• Hypercalcemia at 1.0 µg/kg PC) was seen in dogs with all three<br>
formulations.<br>
• Time course of the hypercalcemia was comparable among all three<br>
formulations up to 48 hours; sampling for the ROCALTROL group did<br>
not extend beyond 48 hours.<br>
• Severity of the hypercalcemia was comparable among the three<br>
formulations; the highest serum calcium (17.0 mg/dL) occurred at 24<br>
hours in dogs receiving the liquid ibrmulation.<br>
• Mean values for ALT, AST, BUN, and creatinine were observed to be<br>
outside the historical nnge in all treatment groups at one or more<br>
timepoints.<br>
• Elevations for BUN and c 'eatinine were greater in the liquid or semi-solid<br>
groups; in the absence of a concurrent control group, the significance of<br>
this observation is unclear.<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
Acute Maximium Tolerated Dose Study<br>
[0116] In the study described above in Example 8, the acute toxicity and<br>
hypercalcemia effects of semi-solid #3 were also assessed to estimate the<br>
maximum tolerated dose and to provide data for dose selection of future studies.<br>
[0117] Calcium levels were increased in a dose-related manner at all dose levels<br>
in males (Fig. 4A) and females (Fig. 4B). Serum calcium data for the 0.001 and<br>
1.0 µ,g/kg dose was obtained in male dogs in the study describe in Example 10,<br>
and is included here for completeness.<br>
[0118) In summary, this study of semi-soliid #3 administered orally via a capsule<br>
to male and female Beagle dogs at 0.1, 0.5, 5.0, 10.0, 30.0, and 100.0 µg/kg<br>
showed:<br>
• Dose dependent hypetcalcemia was the most common laboratory<br>
abnormality.<br>
• Elevations of creatinine, urea nitrogen, cholesterol, erythrocytes,<br>
hemoglobin, hematocrit, and neutrophils, and a decrease in lymphocytes<br>
were seen at doses of 5.0 µg/kg or higher.<br>
• Body weights and food consumption decreased markedly after receiving<br>
the 30.0 and 100.0 µg/kg doses; after 100.0 µg/kg, dogs had a noticeable<br>
thin appearance and obvious decreased activity.<br>
[0119] Based on these results, the maximum tolerated dose of semi-solid #3 in<br>
dogs appeared to be 5.0 µg/kg.<br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>
A 28 Day Repeated Dose Toxicity Study<br>
[0120] In the study described above in Example 9, the dogs were also assessed<br>
for potential toxicity of the semi-solid #3 formulation when administered to dogs<br>
by the oral (capsule) route once every seven days for 28 days. The study included<br>
assessments of clinical signs, body weights, food consumption, toxicokinetics,<br>
clinical pathology including biochemistry, hematology, coagulation, and<br>
urinalysis, ophthalmology, cardielogy, gross necropsy, organ weight, and full<br>
histopathology on all animals. The study design is summarized in Table 18.<br>
[0121] Four of the group 4 arimals (1 male and 3 females) died or were<br>
euthanized moribund during the rist three days of the study. No deaths occurred<br>
following reduction of the dose level on day 7; there were no deaths in groups 1,<br>
2 or 3.<br>
[0122] In the group 4 animals that died, the: most notable clinical abnormalities<br>
preceding death primarily included red vomitus, few/no feces, soft stools<br>
containing red material, red nasal discharge, shallow/rapid breathing, decreased<br>
activity and lateral recumbency.<br>
[0123] Dose-related body weight oss, decreased weight gain, and decreased food<br>
consumption were observed in grc up 3 and 4 animals; group 3 animals were ~11 -<br>
12% below controls; group 4 animals were 17-24% below controls. No effects<br>
on weight gain or food consumption were apparent in group 2 animals.<br>
[0124] There was a trend towards an increase in several RBC and WBC<br>
parameters in the group 4 animals at day 29; no toxicologically significant<br>
hematological abnormalities were apparent in the group 2 and 3 animals.<br>
[0125] Dose related hypercalcemia was noted in group 3 and 4 animals. Calcium<br>
levels were increased by 6 hours )ost-dose, achieved a maximum by 24 hours<br>
post-dose, and decreased gradually at 48 and 96 hours post-dose. Other clinical<br>
chemistry abnormalities, in group 3 and 4 animals included increased serum<br>
proteins, cholesterol and kidney function parameters and decreased electrolytes<br>
and urine specific gravity. No toxicologically significant clinical chemistry<br>
abnormalities or notable increases in serum calcium were observed in group 2<br>
animals.<br>
[0126] There were no treatment- elated changes observed in the ocular tissues on<br>
study days 22/23 and there wen: no treatment-related changes observed in the<br>
ECG and blood pressure data obtained on this study.<br>
[0127] The most notable gross necropsy abnormalities occurred in group 4<br>
animals that were found dead or were euthanized and included lesions in the<br>
digestive system and related organs; dark red omentum, reddened to dark red<br>
mucosa, red fluid in the small intestine and stomach, reddened to dark red mucosa<br>
in the esophagus and large intestine, stained and thickened gall bladder, a<br>
thrombus in the heart, dark red and mottled areas on the lungs, a reddened to dark<br>
red pancreas, a dark red thymus, thickened urinary bladder and a pale spleen.<br>
Gross abnormalities were less severe in group 3 animals; no notable gross<br>
abnormalities were observed in the group 2 animals.<br>
[0128] The primary histopathobgical abnormality was dose related chronic<br>
interstitial nephritis: mild to moderate in group 3 animals and moderate to marked<br>
in group 4 animals. Other microscopic findings in these animals appeared to be<br>
secondary to chronic interstitial nephritis and included mineralization of various<br>
organs/tissues. No microscopic lesions were observed in the group 2 animals.<br>
[0129] The highest values for serum calcium usually occurred within 24 hours<br>
post-dose and returned to baseline levels by the next pre-dose sampling interval.<br>
Selected data (males on Day 21) or serum calcium along with plasma calcitriol<br>
are shown in Figs. 5A-5C. These data show that the maximum plasma<br>
concentrations of calcitriol usually occurred well in advance of the maximum<br>
serum concentrations of calcium.<br>
[0130] In summary, this study of &gt;emi-solid #3 administered orally to dogs once<br>
every 7 days to male and female Beagle dogs at 0,1.0 and 5.0 (females) or 10.0<br>
(males) ug/kg following the initii il dose of 30.0 u.g/kg showed:<br>
The no observed adverse effect level was 0.1 µg/kg; the maximum<br>
tolerated dose was 1.0 µg/kg; mortality was seen at 30 µg/kg.<br>
» Dose related lesions in he digestive system and related organs, reduced<br>
weight gain and decreased food consumption were seen in groups 3 and<br>
4.<br>
• Dose related chronic interstitial nephritis was seen in groups 3 and 4.<br>
EXAMPLE 13<br>
Human Pharmacokinetic Study<br>
[0131) Pharmacokinetics of semi-solid #3 in humans was evaluated in a clinical<br>
trial. Patients received semi-solid #3 on this study at doses of calcitriol up to 90<br>
µg. Preliminary pharmacokinetic results are discussed below.<br>
[0132] Blood samples were obtained pre-dose and at 0.5, 1.0,1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8,<br>
12,24,48 and 72 hours post initial dose of semi-solid #3. Calcitriol levels were<br>
analyzed using a commercial radioimmunoassay, with limited validation for<br>
dilution integrity.<br>
[0133] Mean plasma concentration-time curves were plotted for each group (Fig.<br>
6). Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated for each<br>
subject and then averaged (Table 19). Baseline calcitriol values were subtracted<br>
from the post-dosing values to adjust for endogenous calcitriol.<br>
[0134] Based on these data, pharmacokinetics of semi-solid #3 appear linear and<br>
predictable. There was no evidence of saturation of absorption.<br>
EXAMPLE 14<br>
Safety Results with Semi-Solid #3<br>
[0135] The safety of semi-solid 3 in humans was evaluated in a clinical trial.<br>
As of May 8,2002,12 patients received semi-solid #3 on this study: 3 in group<br>
1 (15 µg), 3 in group 2 (30 µg), and 6 in group 3 (60 µg). Preliminary<br>
pharmacokinetic results on the first 9 patients are discussed below.<br>
[0136] No deaths have occurred. Thirty-four (34) adverse events occurred in 8<br>
of the 9 patients; 20 of 34 adverse events were deemed possibly of probably<br>
related to semi-solid #3. One serious adverse event occurred in group 3 that was<br>
deemed not related by the Investigator. This patient developed a transient grade<br>
1 fever on day 1 that prolonged hospitalization. Grade 2 or 3 adverse events<br>
deemed related to study drug are presented in Table 20.<br>
[0137] The preliminary results from the phase 1 trial with semi-solid #3<br>
demonstrate:<br>
The maximum tolerated dose of semi-solid #3 has not yet been<br>
determined in the phase 1 trial; additional patients are being evaluated in<br>
group 3 (60 µg).<br>
Pharmacokinetics of semi -solid #3 appeared linear and predictable across<br>
the first three dose group:.<br>
