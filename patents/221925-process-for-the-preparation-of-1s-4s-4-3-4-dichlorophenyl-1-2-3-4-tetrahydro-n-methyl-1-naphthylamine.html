-PROCESS FOR THE PREFARATION Ot (lS,4S)-4-(3,4-DICHLOROPHENYL)-1,2,3,4-TETRAHYDRO-N-METHYL-l-NAPHTHYLAMINE<br>
SUN   PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES LTD.<br>
A company incorporated under the laws of India having their office at ACME PLAZA, ANDHERI-KURLA ROAD, ANDHERI (E), MUMBAI-400059, INDIA<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of (lS,4S)-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-N-methyl-l-naphthylamine, compound of formula 1. (1 S,4S)-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-N-methyl-1 -naphthylamine, commonly known as sertraline (INN name), is useful in the treatment of depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder.<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(1 S,4S)-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-N-methyl-1 -naphthylamine and a process for making it is disclosed in United States Patent No. 4,536,518 (hereinafter described as '518, Indian Reference not available) assigned to Pfizer, Inc. This patent discloses the preparation of N-[4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-l(2H)-napthalenylidene]methanamine, compound of formula 3, by reaction of 4-(3,4-dichlororphenyl)-3,4-dihydro-l(2H)-naphthalenone, compound of formula 2, with methylamine in tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a lewis acid viz. TiCU.<br>
2<br><br><br>
This invention uses TiCl4 as a catalyst and a dehydrating agent. It is very reactive with water and forms dense white fumes with slightest exposure to atmosphere making its handling and usage very inconvenient as it is hazardous and toxic. The process of the present invention prepares compound of formula 1 starting with preparation of compound of formula 3 without a dehydrating agent in an acyclic or cyclic polyether solvent.<br>
United States Patent No. 4855500, assigned to Pfizer, Inc. discloses preparation of compound of formula 3 by contacting the compound of formula 2 with methylamine in an inert aprotic organic solvent in the presence.of molecular sieves acting as dehydrating agent. This invention uses molecular sieves, which need to be regenerated, which means involving an additional step. The process of the present invention prepares compound of formula 1 starting with preparation of compound of formula 3 without the requirement of a dehydrating agent making it convenient.<br>
United States Patent No. 6232500, assigned to Pfizer, Inc., claims a process for preparing N-[4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-l(2H)-naphthalenylidene]methanamine, compound of formula 3, comprising reaction of the compound of formula 2 with monomethylamine in an alcohol solvent having a boiling point that is greater than about 55° C in 92% yield. The process of the present invention prepares compound of formula 1 starting with preparation of compound of formula 3 in a non-alcoholic solvent in almost<br>
3<br><br>
quantitative yields.<br>
WO 9957095, assigned to Egis Gyogyszergyar R.T., provides a process for the<br>
preparation	of	N-[4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-l(2H)-<br>
naphthalenylidenejmethanamine, compound of formula 3, by reacting the compound of formula 2 with methylamine in the absence of a dehydrating agent in a lower alkanol to yield 90-95% of compound of formula 1. The process of the present invention prepares compound of formula 1 starting with preparation of compound of formula 3 in a non¬alcoholic solvent in almost quantitative yields.<br>
WO 0136378, assigend to Ciba Speciality Chemicals Holding Inc., provides a process for the preparation of compound of formula 3 by reacting compound of formula 2 with methylamine in the presence of<br>
(a)	a C1-C24 amine or C1-C12 nitrile as solvent OR<br>
(b)	a sulfonic acid catalyst and a non-alcoholic solvent.<br>
Compound of formula 3 prepared by this published invention could contain traces of sulfur compounds (due to sulfonic acid), which would be detrimental for subsequent hydrogenation since these can poison the hydrogenation catalyst. The process of the present invention prepares compound of formula 1 starting with preparation of substantially pure compound of formula 3 in a non-alcoholic solvent in the absence of a catalyst.<br>
We have found a process for the preparation of compound of formula 1 in high yields by reaction of compound of formula 2 with methylamine in an acyclic or cyclic polyether followed by conversion to a mixture of compound of formula 1 and its stereoisomers and subsequent isolation of compound of formula 1. Whereas prior art United States Patent No. 4,536,518 used tetrahydrofuran an ether solvent, together with TiCLt as catalyst we<br>
4<br><br>
without the. need of a catalyst. The process of the present-invention'avoids the use of dehydrating agent like molecular sieves, TiCl4 etc. or a catalyst like sulfonic acid rendering it environmentally friendly and commercially viable. Also, the process of the present invention gives better conversion resulting in pure compound of formula 3 substantially free of compound of formula 2.<br>
The process of the present invention prepares compound of formula 3 in almost quantitative yields in an acyclic or cyclic polyether solvent, which is hitherto not reported.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to prepare, (lS,4S)-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-N-rnethyl-1-naphthylamine, compound of formula 1, starting with the preparation of compound of formula 3 in an environmentally friendly, non-hazardous reaction inert solvent without the use of dehydrating agent or catalyst.<br>
