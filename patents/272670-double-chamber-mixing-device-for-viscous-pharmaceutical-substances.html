				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a double-chamber mixing device allowing to achieve very good homogeneity in the case of a mixture of viscous substances, in particular in the pharmaceutical field.<br>
The invention also relates to the method for implementing the device.<br>
State of the art<br>
The incorporation of pharmaceutical substances in mixtures of high viscosity requiring perfect homogeneity is generally problematic with traditional mixing devices such as blade mixers, screw mixers, kneaders, planetary mixers and mixers with rotors/stators, etc.<br>
Indeed, the following problems are most often encountered:<br>
-	losses and under-dosages of the products incorporated;<br>
-	lack of motion in the mixer because the products to be<br>
mixed stick to the mixing tools and to the tank wall;<br>
-	harmful increase of the temperature of the mixture<br>
causing degradation of the products mixed;<br>
-	losses  upon  draining  of  the  mixing  tank  or<br>
impossibility of automatic draining.<br>
All these problems cause a lack of homogeneity of the mixture obtained that is not compatible with the strict quality requirements of a pharmaceutical finished product or may even cause the impossibility of producing the desired mixture.<br>

Main characteristic elements of the invention<br>
A first aim of the present invention mentioned in Claim 1 is to propose a double-chamber device for mixing at least two viscous substances, comprising:<br>
a first tank and a second tank, that are coaxial and cylindrical, each sealingly closed at a first end by a moving piston and provided at its second end with a slightly tapered bottom, both tanks being positioned,<br>
preferably vertically, in mirror-image symmetry relative to a plane that is perpendicular to their common axis; a central static mixing element connecting both tanks at the level of their slightly tapered bottoms; a  high-pressure  hydraulic  device  for  automatically activating  the  pistons  according  to  a  coordinated reciprocal motion.<br>
A second aim of the present invention mentioned in Claim 11 is to propose a method for mixing at least two viscous substances, preferably pharmaceutical, by means of the above-mentioned device, characterised by the following stages:<br>
the substances to be mixed are injected into the first tank by withdrawing the piston or with a worm screw injection;<br>
a  specified number of successive mixing cycles are achieved by pumping from the first tank to the second tank through the central static mixer, and vice versa; the final mixture is transferred to one of both tanks, which is then emptied.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention are described in Claims 2 to 10, 12 and 13, respectively.<br>
Brief description of the accompanying figures<br>
Figure 1 represents a cross-section view of the mixing device according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Figure 2 diagrammatically represents the various stages for implementing the device as in Fig.1.<br>
Figure 3 diagrammatically represents the stage of draining the mixing device of the invention, which occurs once the desired homogeneity is achieved.<br>
Description of a preferred embodiment of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a mixing unit that allows the incorporation and automatic mixing of pharmaceutical products in a closed circuit with a view to obtain a final mixture of high viscosity.<br>
The invented mixing unit comprises in the main two communicating, vertical and cylindrical tanks that are on the same axis and symmetrical relative to a median horizontal plane (both tanks being the mirror image of the other). These tanks are provided with sealed pistons which, when activated by a hydraulic system, allow the compounds to be mixed to pass in successive cycles through a mixing device with baffles. The assembly is totally automated by means of a programmable machine and may be thermostatically controlled for mixing thermosensitive substances requiring it.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention shown in Fig.l, the mixing unit comprises the following elements:<br>
1) a first upper tank 1, cylindrical with a vertical axis and made of stainless steel, and provided with:<br>
a double casing 3 in which a cooling or heating fluid<br>
may circulate;<br>
a slightly tapered bottom 11;<br>
a stainless steel cover 12 acting as a piston whose<br>
shape, adapted to the tapered bottom of the tank, and<br>
seal allow the tank to be completely drained;<br>
a high-pressure hydraulic device that allows the<br>
automatic activation of the cover/piston (not shown);<br>
various connections 4, possibly provided with valves,<br>
that allow to measure the temperature,  to create<br>
vacuum or to introduce an inert gas, to take samples<br>
during mixing, to inject or remove substances, etc.;<br>
2)	a second lower tank 2, cylindrical and vertical and made<br>
of stainless steel, that is coaxial with and identical<br>
to the first tank and positioned in mirror symmetry<br>
relative to the latter;<br>
3)	a mixing  element  5  also made  of  stainless  steel<br>
connecting both tanks 1,2 and provided with:<br>
a double casing 3 in which a cooling or heating fluid may circulate;<br>
a stainless steel element provided with baffles (static mixer) allowing to create a turbulent mixing flow at the level of the compounds to be mixed; various connections 4 allowing to measure the temperature, to create vacuum or to introduce an inert gas, to take samples during mixing, etc.;<br>
4)	a control device (not shown) allowing to control and<br>
synchronize the various motions of the pistons, the<br>
mixing cycles or even to inject the compounds for<br>
example by means of a worm screw.<br>
The mixing and draining methods as in the invention are carried out as described below.<br>
The mixing method whose stages (a) to (e) are shown in Fig. 2 is carried out by pumping the compounds to be mixed in successive cycles from the upper tank 1 to the lower tank 2 through the static mixer 5, and vice versa. The number of cycles required is determined by the type and viscosity of the compounds to be mixed.<br>
With viscous pharmaceutical substances, between 5 and 10 cycles of about 30 seconds are typically carried out according to this method, which corresponds to a total process time between 2 mins 30 and 5 mins. In the state of the art, a typical mixing time is 60 minutes.<br>
The compounds of the mixture are introduced into the upper tank 1 before the mixing process is started by withdrawing the cover 12 or they are injected into the<br>
system during the mixing process by means of a sealed worm screw device (not shown in the figures) that may equally be positioned on the upper tank 1 or on the central mixing element 5.<br>
When the mixing process is completed, the system allows its complete draining as shown in Fig.3. To this end, all the mixture is transferred in the upper I or lower 2 tank and then emptied out outwards.<br>
