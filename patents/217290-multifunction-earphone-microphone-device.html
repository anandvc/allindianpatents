				<td>The present invention relates to a multifunction earphone-microphone device for use with a portable cellular phone.<br><br>
An earphone-microphone device disclosed in Unexaminec Japanese Patent Publication (kokai) No. Hei-5-91584 has already been known as a conventional earphone-microphone device for use with a portable cellular phone. Fig. 3 shows the configuratior of a conventional earphone-microphone device. The earphone-microphone device has a four-pole plug l1b as an interface section 1, a microphone 21 and a push switch 23b as a display/operation section 2, and earphone 31 as a receiving section 3.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a wiring diagram of the earphone-microphone device shown in Fig. 3. The earphone/microphone device is connected to an unillustrated portable cellular phone by way of a four-electrode plug lib. When the earphone/microphone device is connected to the portable cellular phone, voice entered from a microphone 21 is fed to the portable cellular phone by way of a microphone signal plug 12. In contrast, received voice is output from an earphone 31 of the earphone-microphone device by way of a received signal plug 13.   Further, a push switch 23b is<br><br>
connected to a circuit provided in the portable cellular phone by way of a switch detector plug 18. Accordingly, the portable cellular phone is capable of detecting the pushing action of the push switch. Further, the origination of a call to or receipt of an incoming call from a specific called party can be effected through use of the push switch 23b. Reference numeral 17 designates a GND terminal.<br>
However, the aforementioned conventional earphone-microphone suffers several problems. For example, when the portable cellular phone is kept in a bag, the user cannot know a calling party without seeing a liquid crystal display (LCD) of a portable cellular phone every time there is an arrival of an incoming call. Further, when a vibrator is set to an ON state, the user can not realize the arrival of an incoming call unless he carries the portable cellular phone in his pocket or the like.<br><br>
The present invention is intended to solve the foregoing problem, and the object of the invention is to enable a multifunction earphone-microphone to perform most typical functions of a portable cellular phone by retrieving phone-number-related data stored in the cellular phone and displaying the thus-retrieved phone-number-related data onto a display/operation section at the time of origination of a call.<br><br>
or by actuation of a vibrator provided in the operation section at the time of arrival of an incoming call.<br>
In order to accomplish the foregoing object, there is provided a multifunction earphone-microphone device comprising:<br>
an interface to be connected to a portable cellular phone; and<br>
a display/operation section including a rotary jog dial, wherein<br>
phone-number-related data sets, each including the name and telephone number of a called party and the like stored in the portable cellular phone beforehand, are subsequently displayed on the display/operation section when the rotary jog dial is rotated while the interface is connected to the portable cellular phone. Further, when the portable cellular phone receives an incoming call, a vibrator may be actuated to indicate the incoming call.<br>
According to the present invention, since a phone-number-related data set of a called party is displayed on the display/operation section at the time of origination of a call, it is possible to make a call by only pressing the rotary jog dial. Further, when there is an arrival of an incoming call, the user can know the arrival of a call from vibration of the vibrator of the display/operation section.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br><br>
rig. i IS a blocK diagram snowing a multifunction earphone-microphone device according to one embodiment of the present invention;<br>
Fig. 2 is a wiring diagram showing the multifunction earphone-microphone device shown in Fig. 1;<br>
Fig. 3 is a block diagram showing an existing earphone-microphone device; and<br>
Fig. 4 is a wiring diagram showing the earphone-microphone device shown in Fig. 3.<br>
PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION Preferred embodiment according to the present invention will be described referring to the accompanying drawings as follows.<br>
As shown in the diagram of a multifunction earphone-microphone device provided in Fig. 1, a multifunction earphone-microphone device according to the present invention has a rotary jog dial 23a and a display/operation section 2. Called parties stored in memory dial are displayed subsequentially on the display/operation section 2 through use of the rotary jog dial 23a. A call can be made by pressing the rotary jog dial 23a after confirroing a desired called party on the display/operation section. Further, the display/operation section 2 of the earphone-microphone device has a built-in vibrator 24. When there is an arrival of an incoming call, the vibrator 24 is actuated under control of a microcomputer 25.<br><br>
Therefore, the present invention is possible to provide a superior multifunction earphone-microphone device capable of indicating the arrival of an incoming call even when the user does not carry the portable cellular phone.<br>
Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing a multifunction earphone-microphone device according to an embodiment of the present invention, and Fig. 2 is a wiring diagram showing the multifunction earphone-microphone device shown in Fig. 1.<br>
In Figs. 1 and 2, an interface 1 sends a signal to or receives a signal from a portable cellular phone and has a six-pole plug 11a. The plug has a microphone signal terminal 12, a receiver signal terminal 13, a serial data signal terminal 14, a serial clock signal terminal 15, a power signal terminal 16, and a ground terminal 17. A display/operation section 2 has a microphone 21, a liquid crystal display 22, a rotary jog dial 23a, a vibrator 24, and a microcomputer 25. The receiver 3 is formed of an earphone 31.<br>
With reference to Fig. 2, the operation of the multifunction earphone-microphone device having the foregoing configuration will now be described. The interface 1 of the multifunction earphone-microphone device is connected to an unillustrated portable cellular phone. In this state, the power source of the portable cellular phone is turned on, and the thus-activated cellular phone is held in a bag or the like. When an attempt is made to originate a call to a specific called party, phone-nuraber-related data sets registered in the<br><br>
cellular phone beforehand, each set including such as the name and telephone number of a called party, are sent to the interface 1. The thus-received data sets are displayed subsequentially on a liquid crystal display 22 of the display/operation section 2. A call can be made by pressing the rotary jog dial 23a while a desired called party is on the display.<br>
The microcomputer 25 provided in the multifunction earphone-microphone device controls the displaying action and other operations of the multifunction earphone-microphone device. By way of a pair of transmit/receive data signal lines, such as the serial data signal terminal 14 and the serial clock signal terminal 15, the microcomputer 25 sends data to or receives data from a microcomputer of the cellular phone and instructs the transmission/receipt of display data or the actuation of the vibrator.<br>
Table 1 shows a comparison between the characteristics of the multifunction earphone-microphone device according to the present embodiment of the present invention and those of the existing earphone-microphone device.<br>
As is apparent from Table 1, the multifunction earphone-microphone device according to the present embodiment is capable of originating a call by displaying a desired called party through utilization of the rotary jog dial and by pressing the switch. Alternatively, so long as the push switch is replaced with a rotary jog dial and the earphone-microphone<br><br>
device is provided with a liquid crystal device for displaying a stored phone number, a call to a specific called party can be made.<br>
