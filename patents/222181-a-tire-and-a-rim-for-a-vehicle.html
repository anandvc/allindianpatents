				<td>The present invention relates to a tire and rim for a vehicle.<br>
The present invention relates to a tire including a tire body and a tube mounted in the tire body and having a sealant.<br>
When a tube of a general tire is pierced with a<br>
nail or the like, air in the tube leaks from the pierced hole through a small gap between the tire body and the tube and then flows out through the nipple hole in the rim, resulting in a so-called puncture. It is known from Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 58-74342 to introduce a suitable amount of liquid sealant beforehand into a tube for automatically making a stopgap repair on a pierced hole when the tube is pierced. [0003]<br>
According to another known tire structure disclosed in Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 6-336103, a tube is mounted in a so-called tubeless tire and a space for holding air is defined between the outer surface of the tube and the inner surface of the tire body. Even when the tire body is damaged and the air in the space leaks out, the tire body is kept in its original shape by air which is held in the tube. [0004]<br>
[PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY *THE INVENTION] The tube disclosed in the former publication, however, is disadvantageous in that when the tube suffers an extensive damage and the sealant fails to be effective<br><br>
enough to repair the damage, air leaking from the tube into the tire body leaks out from the nipple hole in the rim, preventing the motor vehicle from continuing its running. The tire disclosed in the latter publication prevents the motor vehicle from continuing its running either when both the tire body and the tube are damaged by a long nail or the like.<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the above drawbacks. It is an object of the present invention to provide a tire which allows the motor vehicle to continue its running even when both a tire body thereof and a tube mounted therein are damaged.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a tire and rim for a vehicle comprising:<br>
a tire body including an opening formed therein;<br>
a tube mounted in the tire body, said tube having an inner circumferential air chamber filled with air and an outer circumferential sealant chamber filled with a sealant;<br>
a rim for mounting said tire body and tube relative thereto; lateral beads disposed adjacent to an inner circumferential portion of said opening of said tire, the lateral beads being held and sealed against lateral steps of the rim, said lateral beads preventing escape of air from said tire;<br>
a sealing member integrally mounted to said tube;<br>
an inlet pipe connected to said sealing member for supplying air to said tube;<br>
said sealing member having a base bonded to an outside surface of said tube, a tapered insert for positioning through an aperture in said rim, and a sealing neck located between said base and said tapered insert for hermetically fitting within said aperture in said rim, said sealing neck having a diameter smaller than a diameter of said base; and<br><br>
said inlet pipe is embedded in said sealing member and has an aperture extending therethrough and a check valve therein, said inlet pipe having a tapered flange formed on a first end adjacent said tube and within said base, said inlet pipe extending from within said base through said sealing neck and said tapered insert to an outside of said sealing member.<br>
EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
[FIG, 1] is a transverse cross-sectional view of a wheel on which a tire with a tube according to a first embodiment of the present invention is mounted;<br>
[FIG. 2] is an enlarged cross-sectional view showing an encircled portion "2" in FIG. 1; and<br>
[FIG, 3] is a transverse cross-sectional view of a wheel on which a tire with a tube according to a second embodiment of the present invention is mounted.<br>
[0008]<br>
FIGS. 1 and 2 show a tire according to a first embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 1 is a transverse cross-sectional view of a wheel on which a tire with a tube is mounted, and FIG. 2 is an enlarged cross-sectional view showing an encircled portion "2" in FIG. 1. [0009]<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, a rim R of a motorcycle wheel is coupled to a hub (not shown) by spokes S. On the rim R, there is mounted a tire T comprising a tire body 1 and a tube 2 housed in the tire body 1 and having a sealant. When the tire T is installed on the rim R, lateral beads li, 12 of the tire body 1 which are disposed adjacent to an inner circumferential opening thereof have respective outer<br>
surfaces held in intimate contact with lateral steps Rlf R2<br>
of the rim R, sealing the tire body 1 against leakage of air from the tire body 1. The tire body 1 and the rim R are sealed by the conventional sealing structure of so-called tubeless tires. [0010]<br>
The tube 2 has a circumferential wall 4 of annular cross-sectional shape which comprises an air chamber circumferential wall 4i positioned radially inwardly and a sealant chamber circumferential wall 4o positioned radially outwardly. The air chamber circumferential wall 4i and the sealant chamber circumferential wall 4o are joined to each other by a pair of junctions which are joined to each other by a partition 5 integral therewith. [0011]<br>
The air chamber circumferential wall 4i and the partition 5 jointly define therebetween an air chamber 3 of substantially circular cross-sectional shape which is filled with air. The sealant chamber circumferential wall 4o and the partition 5 jointly define therebetween a sealant chamber 7 substantially arcuate cross-sectional shape which is filled with a known liquid sealant 8. An<br>
air valve 6 for filling the air chamber 3 with air is mounted on the air chamber circumferential wall 4i. [0012]<br>
As can be seen from FIGS. 1 and 2, the air valve 6 is positioned in an inner circumferential region of the tube 2 and projects radially inwardly. The air valve 6 comprises a sealing member 11 of rubber, a pipe member 12 of metal embedded in the sealing member 11 and containing a check valve V, and a cap 13 of synthetic resin threaded over an end of the pipe member 12 which projects radially inwardly from the sealing member 11. The pipe member 12 has a radially outer end which communicates with the air chamber 3 through a hole 14 extending through the sealing member 11 and the tube 2. [0013]<br>
The sealing member 11 comprises a base ll1 bonded<br>
to the tube 2, a tapered insert 112 capable of being inserted through a hole R3 defined in the rim R, and a small-diameter sealing neck 113 disposed between the base ll1 and the tapered insert 112 and hermetically fitted in the hole R3. When a flange 12a on the radially outer end of the pipe member 12 is embedded in the base 111 of the<br><br>
sealing member 11, the pipe member 12 is prevented from<br>
being pulled out of the sealing member 11.<br>
[0014]<br>
Operation of the tire according to the first embodiment, which has the above structure, will be described below.<br>
[0015]<br>
The tire T is installed on the rim R as follows: First, the tube 2 from which air has been removed is put into the tire body 1, and the lateral beads l1, 12 of the tire body 1 are brought into engagement with inner surfaces of the steps R1, R2 of the rim R. At this time, the insert 112 of the sealing member 11 of the air valve 6 is elastically deformed, and passed, together with the cap 13, radially inwardly through the hole R3 in the rim R. The sealing neck 113 of the sealing member 11 is now fitted into the hole R3, hermetically sealing an outer circumferential edge of the hole R3. [0016]<br>
Then, the cap 13 is removed from the tip end of the pipe member 12, and air is supplied under high pressure into the air chamber 3 in the tube 2 through the pipe<br><br>
member 12, inflating the tube 2 in the tire body 1. Before the pressure in the tube 2 is applied to the beads 11, 12 of the tire body 1, since the beads li, 12 are not sufficiently sealed against the steps RI, R2, air remaining between the outer surface of the tube 2 and the inner surface of the tire body 1 flows between the beads 11, 12 and the steps Rl R2 and is discharged out. Therefore, the tube 2 can be inflated without fail in the tire body 1. When the tube 2 is fully inflated, the pressure in the tube 2 laterally spreads the beads l1, 12 into intimate contact with the steps Rlf R2, developing a sufficient sealing capability. [0017]<br>
Because the sealant chamber 7 of the tube 2 is held in a shape complementary to the inner surface of the tire body 1, the sealant 8 filled in the sealant chamber 7 is prevented from being localized radially outwardly under centrifugal forces produced upon rotation of the wheel and imposed on the sealant 8. Therefore, even when the tube 2 is pierced radially or laterally by a nail or the like, the sealant 8 immediately fills and repairs the pierced hole, delaying any leakage of air from the air chamber 3.<br><br>
Inasmuch as the sealant 8 held in the sealant chamber 7 does not flow into the air chamber 3, it does not clog the air valve 6 and a pressure gage or the like which may be applied to the air valve 6. [0018]<br>
As described above, even when the tube 2 is damaged, the sealant 8 filled in the sealant chamber 7 repairs the damage to prevent air from flowing out of the tube 2. Therefore, the motor vehicle can run continuously. Even when the tube 2 is extensively damaged, allowing air to leak from the air chamber 3 into a region between the tube 2 and the tire body 1, the leaking air does not leak out of the tire body 1. Accordingly, the motor vehicle can also run continuously. [0019]<br>
The reasons for the above operation are as follows: Since the pierced hole is repaired by the sealant 8 which leaks from the sealant chamber 7, air is prevented from leaking out of the tire body 1 through the pierced hole. Furthermore, the beads li, 12 are sealed against the steps R1, R2, and the air valve 6 is also sealed with respect to the hole R3 by the sealing member 11.<br><br>
[0020]<br>
Even when the tire T is pierced by a nail or the like, air is prevented from leaking from the tire body 1 by the repairing capability of the sealant 8 and the sealing capability of the tire body 1 which is hermetically sealed against the rim R. [0021]<br>
A tire according to a second embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to FIG. 2. Those parts of the tire according to the second embodiment which are identical to those of the tire according to the first embodiment are denoted by identical reference characters. [0022]<br>
The second embodiment resides in the structure of the air valve 6. The air chamber circumferential wall 4i of the tube 2 on which the air valve 6 is mounted has a thick portion 4X, and the flange 12a of the pipe member 12 is embedded in the thick portion 4j. The pipe 12 which is externally threaded is inserted into the hole R3 in the rim R, and is fastened to the rim R by nuts 15, 16. A sealing surface 42 of the thick portion 41 is held in intimate<br><br>
contact with the rim R around the hole R3, preventing air<br>
from leaking from the tire body 1.<br>
[0023]<br>
Other details of the tire according to the second embodiment are identical to those of the tire according to the first embodiment. The tire according to the second embodiment operates in the same manner and offers the same advantages as the tire according to the first embodiment. [0024]<br>
While the embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail above/ various changes or modifications may be made therein without departing from the scope of the present invention. [0025]<br>
[ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION]<br>
According to the present invention, as described above, since the tire includes the tube having the inner circumferential air chamber filled with air and the outer circumferential sealant chamber filled with the sealant, even when the tube is pierced, the pierced hole is repaired by the sealant filled in the sealant chamber for thereby preventing air from leaking out of the tube. Even if air<br>
leaks from the tube into the tire body, because the pierced hole is repaired by the sealant and the beads of the tire body are sealed against the rim, the air that has leaked into the tire body is prevented from leaking out of the tire body. Therefore, the motor vehicle equipped with the tire is allowed to run continuously.<br>
