				<td>The present invention relates to a mould for use in packing a foodstuff<br>
Nuts  such  as  cashew nuts  are  generally packed in metal drums for transport around the world.     The nuts are introduced into the drums through an opening.      The opening is closed and the nuts then purged with a gas such as carbon dioxide.      Although the drums are robust, this method of packing nuts does give rise to several problems.    There is inevitably some ullage space in the drum allowing the nuts ,to move during transport and this movement can cause attrition of the nuts.    The shelf-life of the nuts packed in this way is, at best, six to eight months.     Metal containers are expensive and relatively heavy. According  to   the  present  invention,   there  is  provided   a method   for producing a packaged foodstuff, the process including the steps of: placing a flexible bag having an opening into a mould; introducing the foodstuff into the bag through the opening; creating a vacuum in the bag thereby providing a substantially oxygen-free atmosphere in the bag; and<br>
sealing the bag to close the opening while maintaining the vacuum in the bag, thereby forming a packaged foodstuff of a configuration substantially defined by the mould.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a mould for use in packing a foodstuff, comprising an open-topped box defining a cavity for receiving a bag a peripheral edge defining an open top, slits formed in the peripheral edge on opposite sides of the box, and a lid, in two sections, each section being moveable between a first position in which it is removed from the open top and a second position in which it closes a portion of the open top, the sections in the second position leaving a gap substantially in register with the slits adapted to accommodate the bag, in collapsed form.<br>
According a preferred form of the mould, it comprises an open topped box defining a cavity for receiving the bag, a peripheral edge defining the open top, slits formed in the peripheral edge on opposite sides of the box, and a lid, in two sections, each section being moveable between a first position in which it is removed from the open top and a second position in which it closes a portion of the open top, the sections in this position leaving a gap substantially in register with the slits adapted to accommodate the bag, in collapsed form.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figures 1 to 4 illustrate the sequence of steps in an embodiment of the<br>
method of the invention,<br>
Figure 5 is a perspective view of a bag packed with nuts according to the<br>
invention, and<br>
Figure 6 is a perspective view of a box containing a number of the<br>
packed bags of Figure 5.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS<br>
The method of the invention provides an efficient and effective means of packing foodstuffs such as nuts. The vacuum which is created in the bag ensures that the contents thereof are held in essentially fixed and immovable form. The presence of a vacuum, generally such as to allow for no more than 0,1 percent by mass oxygen, ensures that the contents of the bag are maintained in an essentially oxygen-free atmosphere. It is possible, while maintaining the vacuum, to introduce a minor amount of a purging gas such as carbon dioxide. The shelf-life of the foodstuff packed in the bag is enhanced.<br>
The use of a mould allows for packed bags to be formed to a desired shape. Typically this shape will take the form of a block allowing the packed bag to be self-standing. A plurality of such bags may be processed and packed in a cardboard box.<br>
The opening in the bag will generally be provided at an end thereof.<br>
The bag will typically be a flexible plastic bag. Examples of suitable plastics are low density polyethylene and low density polyethylene co-extruded with another polymer. A particularly suitable bag is one which comprises at least two layers of low density polyethylene co-extruded with a polymeric barrier layer sandwiched therebetween. The barrier layer may be a layer of polyamide.<br>
The wall thickness of the bag will vary according to the size of the bag and the nature of the foodstuff being packed therein. The thickness will<br>
generally be less than 250 microns.<br>
Sealing of the bag will typically be achieved by means of heat, alone or in combination with pressure. Standard heat impulse sealing apparatus may be used.<br>
An embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. Figures 1 to 4 illustrate the various steps involved in packing a flexible polyethylene bag with nuts. Referring to these drawings, a flexible polyethylene bag 10 is provided. The bag 10 has elongate sides 12, a closed end 14 and an open end 16. The bag is dimensioned to be received by a mould.<br>
The mould comprises a rectangular-shaped box 18 having major side surfaces 20, side surfaces 22 joining the major side surfaces 20 and an end 24 (not shown). The box has an open top 26. The top edges 28 of the sides 22 have slits 30 formed therein. The slits 30 each have a wide section 32 and a narrow section 34. The top edges of the sides 20 each have one section 36 a lid hinged at 38 to it. The lids sections 36 move between an open position illustrated by Figure 1 and a closed position illustrated by Figure 2. When in the closed position, as shown in Figure 2, a gap is provided between the leading edges 40 of lid sections 36. The lid sections 36 may be releaseably held in their closed positions by means of catches 42.<br>
The bag 10 is placed in the box 18 and the edges 12 of the bag engaged in the narrow sections 34 of the slits 30. The wide sections 32 of the slits 30 facilitate this engagement.   Nuts are then poured into the bag<br>
through the open end 16 to fill the bag substantially to the level of the narrow sections 34 of the slits 30.<br>
Thereafter, the lid sections 36 are rotated to their closed positions, as shown by Figure 2, and the latches 42 engaged. In this position, the open end 16 of the bag protrudes beyond the lid sections 36. Engagement of the top end of the bag in the slits 30 and in the gap between the leading edges 40 of the lid sections 36 ensures that a substantially flat region 44 is presented outside of the box.<br>
A vacuum-creating apparatus, shown diagrammatically at 46, is now brought into engagement with the open end 16 of the bag, as shown by Figure 3. A vacuum is created in the bag and, while maintaining the vacuum, heating platens 48 are brought into contact with the bag, as shown by Figure 4, to seal and close the open end 16 of the bag.<br>
The latches 42 are disengaged, the lid sections 36 rotated to their open positions and the vacuum-packed bag withdrawn from the box. This vacuum-packed bag, sealed along line 50, is illustrated by Figure 5.<br>
A plurality of these bags may now be processed simultaneously and then loaded into a box 52, generally a cardboard box, as shown by Figure 6. The block shape of the moulded vacuum-packed bags allows them to fit neatly into the box.<br>
The invention gives rise to several advantages over the prior art methods of packing nuts. First, the vacuum packing of the nuts ensures a long shelf-life of up to 60 months. It is possible to introduce a small quantity<br>
of carbon dioxide into the bag under the vacuum conditions. This has the effect of increasing the shelf-life of the nuts. Second, no movement of the nuts in the bag is possible, reducing the risk of damage to the nuts in transport. Third, a much larger quantity of nuts can be loaded into a standard container using this method than is the case with conventional metal drums. Fourth, each and every bag will be self-standing, facilitating group packaging and enhancing display properties.<br>
The invention has particular application to the packing of cashew nuts. However, it may be used for the packing of other nuts such as pecan and macadanium nuts and other foodstuffs.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
