				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Particulate trap with coated fiber layer<br>
The invention relates to a high-temperature-resistant fiber<br>
layer for a particulate trap for purifying exhaust gases from<br>
mobile internal combustion engines, and to a particulate trap<br>
of this type itself.<br>
If we consider the purification of exhaust gases, in<br>
particular from diesel engines, it is known that hydrocarbons<br>
(HC) and carbon monoxides (CO) in the exhaust gas can be<br>
oxidized, for example by bringing them into contact with<br>
components which may have a catalytically active surface.<br>
However, the reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) is more<br>
difficult under oxygen-rich conditions. A three-way catalytic<br>
converter, as is used, for example, in spark-ignition engines,<br>
does not on its own achieve the desired effects for diesel<br>
engines. For this reason, by way of example, the selected<br>
catalytic reduction (SCR) process has been developed.<br>
Furthermore, storage catalytic converters have been tested for<br>
use for the reduction of nitrogen oxides. The coating of a<br>
storage catalytic converter contains, in addition to the<br>
standard precious metal components, barium carbonate or barium<br>
oxide. This makes it possible to store NOx when there is an<br>
excess of oxygen. On the precious metal components, nitrogen<br>
monoxide (NO) from the exhaust gas is oxidized to form<br>
nitrogen dioxide (NO2) . This is then stored on the catalytic<br>
converter by forming barium nitrate. During this storage<br>
process, a nitrate layer, which slows storage, since NO2 for<br>
further storage has to penetrate through this layer, is formed<br>
on the barium nucleus. Since the storage capacity is therefore<br>
limited, the catalytic converter has to be regenerated at<br>
regular intervals. This is effected, for example, by briefly<br>
producing a rich exhaust gas, i.e. by operating under<br>
substoichiometric conditions for a short period of time. In a<br>
reduced atmosphere, the nitrate is converted back into (for<br>
example) carbonate and nitrogen monoxide is released. This is<br>
immediately reduced to form nitrogen. Since the regeneration<br>
takes place more quickly than the storage, the regeneration<br>
periods can be significantly shorter than the storage periods.<br>
To reduce particulate emissions, it is known to use<br>
particulate traps which are constructed from a ceramic<br>
substrate. They have passages, so that the exhaust gas which<br>
is to be purified can flow into the particulate trap. Adjacent<br>
passages are alternately closed up, so that the exhaust gas<br>
enters the passage on the inlet side, passes through a ceramic<br>
wall and escapes again on the outlet side through an adjacent<br>
passage. Filters of this type achieve an effectiveness of<br>
approx. 95% over the entire range of particulate sizes which<br>
occur.<br>
In addition to chemical interactions with additives and<br>
special coatings, the reliable regeneration of the filter in<br>
the exhaust system of an automobile still presents problems.<br>
It is necessary to regenerate the particulate trap, since the<br>
increasing accumulation of particulates in the passage walls<br>
through which the exhaust gas is to flow leads to a constantly<br>
rising pressure Toss, which has adverse effects on the engine<br>
performance. The regeneration step substantially comprises<br>
brief heating of the particulate trap and the particulates<br>
which have accumulated therein, so that the carbon<br>
particulates are converted into gaseous constituents. This can<br>
also be achieved, for example, by using an upstream exothermic<br>
reaction (e.g. oxidation of fuel which has additionally been<br>
injected into the exhaust pipe in an oxidation catalytic<br>
converter ("after burning")) to ensure that the exhaust gas<br>
briefly reaches the temperatures which are sufficient to<br>
convert the particulates which are stuck in the particulate<br>
trap. However, this high thermal load on the particulate trap<br>
has adverse effects on the service life.<br>
To avoid this discontinuous regeneration, which in thermal<br>
terms leads to a high likelihood of wear, a system for the<br>
continuous regeneration of filters has been developed (CRT:<br>
"continuous regeneration trap"). In a system of this type, the<br>
particulates are burnt at temperatures of over 200°C by means<br>
of oxidation with NO2. The NO2 required for this purpose is<br>
often generated by an oxidation catalytic converter which is<br>
arranged upstream of the particulate trap. In this case,<br>
however, the problem has arisen, in particular with a view to<br>
use in motor vehicles which use diesel fuel, that there is<br>
only an insufficient level of nitrogen monoxide (NO) which can<br>
be converted into the desired nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the<br>
exhaust gas. Consequently, it has not hitherto been possible<br>
to ensure that the particulate trap will be continuously<br>
regenerated in the exhaust system.<br>
It should also be taken into account that in addition to<br>
particulates which cannot be converted, oil or additional<br>
residues of additives also accumulate in a particulate trap<br>
and cannot readily be regenerated. For this reason, known<br>
filters have to be replaced and/or washed at regular<br>
intervals.<br>
In addition to a minimum reaction temperature and a specific<br>
residence time, it is also necessary for sufficient nitrogen<br>
oxide to be provided for the continuous regeneration of<br>
particulates using NO2. Tests relating to the dynamic emission<br>
of nitrogen monoxide (NO) and particulates have clearly<br>
demonstrated that the particulates are emitted in particular<br>
if there is no nitrogen monoxide or only a very small amount<br>
of nitrogen monoxide in the exhaust gas, and vice versa. This<br>
means that a filter with real continuous regeneration<br>
substantially has the function as a compensator or store, so<br>
that it is ensured that the two reaction partners are<br>
simultaneously present in the required quantities in the<br>
filter at a given time. Furthermore, the filter is to be<br>
arranged as close as possible to the internal combustion<br>
engine, in order to allow it to reach temperatures which are<br>
as high as possible immediately after a cold start. To provide<br>
the required nitrogen dioxide, an oxidation catalytic<br>
converter, which reacts carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons<br>
(HC) , and in particular also converts nitrogen monoxide (NO)<br>
into nitrogen dioxide (NO2) , is to be connected upstream of<br>
the filter. If this system comprising oxidation catalytic<br>
converter and filter is arranged close to the engine, a<br>
position upstream of a turbocharger, which is often used in<br>
diesel motor vehicles to increase the boost pressure in the<br>
combustion chamber, is especially suitable.<br>
On looking at these fundamental considerations, the question<br>
arises, for actual use in automobile construction, as to how a<br>
filter of this type, which in such a position and in the<br>
presence of extremely high thermal and dynamic loads has a<br>
satisfactory filter efficiency, is constructed. In this<br>
context, it is necessary to take into account in particular<br>
the spatial conditions, which require a new design of filter.<br>
Whereas with conventional filters, which were arranged in the<br>
underbody of a motor vehicle, the primary factor was to<br>
achieve as large a volume as possible, in order to ensure a<br>
long residence time of the as yet unconverted particulates in<br>
the filter and therefore a high efficiency, with a filter<br>
arranged close to the engine insufficient space or room is<br>
available.<br>
In view of this, a new concept has been developed,<br>
substantially known by the name "open filter system". These<br>
open filter systems are distinguished by the fact that it is<br>
possible to dispense with an inbuilt, alternating closure of<br>
the filter passages. In this case, the passage walls are<br>
constructed at least partially from porous or highly porous<br>
material and the flow passages of the open filter have<br>
diversion or guide structures. These internal fittings cause<br>
the flow or the particulates contained therein to be deflected<br>
toward the regions made from porous or more highly porous<br>
material. In this context, surprisingly, it has emerged that<br>
the particulates continue to adhere on and/or in the porous<br>
passage wall as a result of interception and/or impaction. The<br>
pressure differences in the flow profile of the flowing<br>
exhaust gas are of importance in connection with the<br>
combination of these effects. The diversion may additionally<br>
give rise to local subatmospheric or superatmospheric pressure<br>
conditions, which lead to a filtration effect through the<br>
porous wall, since it is necessary to compensate for the<br>
abovementioned pressure differences.<br>
The particulate trap is in this case, unlike with the known<br>
closed screen or filter system, open, since no flow blind<br>
alleys are provided. Therefore, this property can also be used<br>
to characterize particulate filters of this type, so that, for<br>
example, the parameter "freedom of flow" is suitable for<br>
describing such a particulate trap. Therefore, a "freedom of<br>
flow" of 20% means that when viewed in cross section it is<br>
possible to see all the way through approx. 20% of the surface<br>
area. In the case of a particulate filter with a passage<br>
density of approx. 600 cpsi (cells per square inch) with a<br>
hydraulic diameter of 0.8 mm, this freedom of flow would<br>
correspond to a surface area of over 0.1 mm2. In other words,<br>
this means that a particulate trap can be referred to as open<br>
if particulates can in principle pass all the way through it,<br>
specifically including particulates which are considerably<br>
larger than the particulates which are actually to be filtered<br>
out (in particular the particulate size range which is<br>
characteristic of diesel fuel and/or gasoline). As a result, a<br>
filter of this type cannot become blocked even in the event of<br>
an agglomeration of particulates during operation. A suitable<br>
method for measuring the openness of particulate traps is, for<br>
example, to test the diameter up to which spherical<br>
particulates can still pass through a filter of this type. In<br>
current applications, a particulate trap is "open" in<br>
particular if spheres with a diameter of greater than or equal<br>
to 0.1 mm can still pass through it, preferably spheres with a<br>
diameter of over 0.2 mm. "Open" filter elements of this type<br>
are known, for example, from documents DE 201 17 873 U1, DE<br>
201 17 659 Ul, WO 02/00326, WO 01/92692, WO 01/80978, the<br>
content of disclosure of which is hereby incorporated in its<br>
entirety in the subject matter of the present description.<br>
By way of example, German Utility Model DE 89 08 738 Ul gives<br>
indications as to the general configuration of honeycomb<br>
bodies with internal flow-guiding surfaces. This document<br>
describes honeycomb bodies, in particular catalyst support<br>
bodies for motor vehicles, made from metal sheets which are<br>
arranged in layers, are structured at least in partial regions<br>
and form the walls of a multiplicity of passages through which<br>
a fluid can flow. This document describes that in most<br>
applications and given the standard dimensions of honeycomb<br>
bodies of this type, the flow in the passages is substantially<br>
laminar, i.e. very small passage cross sections are used.<br>
Under these conditions, relatively thick boundary layers,<br>
which reduce contact between the core flow in the passages and<br>
the walls, are built up on the passage walls. To swirl up the<br>
exhaust-gas stream inside the passages and thereby to ensure<br>
intensive contact between the entire exhaust-gas stream and a<br>
catalytically active surface of the passages, it is proposed<br>
in this document to use protuberances which form surfaces<br>
which face the flow in the interior of the passage, so that<br>
the exhaust gas is deflected transversely with respect to the<br>
main direction of flow.<br>
In particular with a view to realizing an open particulate<br>
trap of this nature, therefore, it is an object of the present<br>
invention to improve the effectiveness with regard to the<br>
conversion of pollutants contained in the exhaust gas. In<br>
particular, it is intended to open up the possibility of<br>
providing exhaust-gas systems of particularly small design in<br>
particular for automobiles with a diesel engine. Moreover, the<br>
production, assembly and maintenance of exhaust-gas systems of<br>
this type is to be significantly simplified and thereby made<br>
less expensive.<br>
These objects are achieved by a high-temperature-resistant<br>
fiber layer for a particulate trap for purifying exhaust gases<br>
from an internal combustion engine having the features of<br>
patent claim 1 and by a corresponding particulate trap having<br>
the features of patent claim 8. Further advantageous<br>
configurations are described in the dependent patent claims,<br>
and the features disclosed therein can be employed<br>
individually or in any desired and suitable combination with<br>
one another.<br>
The high-temperature-resistant fiber layer according to the<br>
invention made from metal for a particulate trap for purifying<br>
exhaust gases from mobile internal combustion engines is<br>
distinguished by the fact that, at least in a section, there<br>
is a coating which at least in part corresponds to that of an<br>
oxidation catalyst and/or a three-way catalyst and/or an SCR<br>
catalyst.<br>
The provision of a catalytically active coating of this type<br>
has numerous advantages, which will be briefly outlined below.<br>
For example, it is possible to ensure that the components for<br>
oxidation and/or reduction and/or storage of pollutants<br>
contained in the exhaust gas which were originally provided in<br>
the exhaust system can be constructed with a smaller volume or<br>
can even be dispensed with altogether. This means that the<br>
exhaust system per se can be of significantly more streamlined<br>
or smaller design, so that a simple structure, simple<br>
maintenance and inexpensive production of the exhaust system<br>
become possible. Moreover, surprisingly, synergistic effects<br>
are also achieved. For example, exhaust-gas constituents which<br>
are helpful to the conversion or elimination of the<br>
accumulated particulates are generated directly in the<br>
interior of a particulate trap equipped with a fiber layer of<br>
this type. These exhaust-gas constituents are therefore<br>
produced and provided in the immediate vicinity of the surface<br>
of the fiber layer to which the particulates adhere.<br>
Therefore, by way of example, it is also possible to<br>
considerably reduce the regeneration temperature of the<br>
particulate trap, for example from over 900°C to temperatures<br>
below 600°C.<br>
With regard to the arrangement of the at least one section of<br>
the fiber layer, it should be noted that this section may also<br>
extend over the entire surface of the fiber layer. However, it<br>
is also possible to provide a plurality of sections, which may<br>
be coated and/or in some cases also uncoated, in which case if<br>
appropriate it is also possible to select different types of<br>
coating, different shapes of section or section areas. It is<br>
also possible for the at least one section to be located only<br>
on one outer surface or outer side of the high-temperature-<br>
resistant fiber layer.<br>
With regard to the properties of the coating of an oxidation<br>
catalyst, it should be noted that catalysts of this type are<br>
used to increase the rate of certain reactions without<br>
themselves being consumed. Suitable catalyst substances allow<br>
the oxidation reactions for CO (carbon monoxide) and HC<br>
(hydrocarbons) in the exhaust gas to take place at lower<br>
temperatures. Coatings of this type, which generally contain<br>
catalyst substances belonging to the platinum group, allow<br>
gaseous hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide to be oxidized at<br>
exhaust-gas temperatures in the diesel engine exhaust gas of<br>
only 250°C and above. One particular feature of oxidation<br>
coatings of this type is that under certain circumstances the<br>
hydrocarbons which still adhere to carbon particulates undergo<br>
afterburning, with the result that the particulate emissions<br>
can be reduced further. Hitherto, a combination of oxidation-<br>
promoting coatings and filter elements of this type has not<br>
been provided in a unit since it was feared that the<br>
catalytically active substances would be adversely affected by<br>
an increasing coverage with particulates. The present<br>
invention ignored this commonly held prejudice in the<br>
specialist field and developed a high-temperature-resistant<br>
fiber layer which makes it possible to produce particularly<br>
effective particulate traps.<br>
If the levels of the three pollutant components CO, HC and NOX<br>
(nitrogen oxide) are to be lowered by further reaction, this<br>
can be achieved by coating the fiber layer with the coating of<br>
a three-way catalyst. The active catalyst substance in this<br>
case comprises platinum metal (Pt), palladium metal (Pd)<br>
and/or rhodium metal (Rh) distributed finely over a large<br>
surface area. At a lambda value of 1, CO is oxidized to form<br>
carbon dioxide (CO2) , CH is oxidized to form CO2 and water<br>
(H2O) , and NOx is reduced to form nitrogen (N2) . In this<br>
context, the following coating is recommended for the<br>
oxidation catalyst:<br>
Pt/Pd = 2/1<br>
0.93 - 1.2 gram Pt/litercatalyst support volume<br>
0.46 - 0.6 gram Pt/litercatalyst support volume<br>
With regard to the multifunctional catalyst (reduction) , it is<br>
proposed for the following relationships to apply:<br>
Pt/Rh = 5/1<br>
1.16 - 1.5 gram Pt/litercatalyst support volume<br>
1.23 - 0.3 gram Rh/litercatalyst support volume<br>
The catalyst support body volume is to be understood as<br>
meaning the volume of the material of the support (honeycomb<br>
structure, etc.) and the cavities, passages, etc. formed by<br>
the support.<br>
The coating of an SCR catalyst may if appropriate also be of<br>
multilayer and/or multistage form. One possible urean SCR<br>
catalyst system comprises a plurality of partial regions of<br>
the coating which are arranged in succession and are applied<br>
to the fiber layer. The partial regions may in this case be<br>
arranged as follows, as seen in the direction of the flow of<br>
the exhaust gas:<br>
a coating of an oxidation catalyst (optional),<br>
the coating of a hydrolysis catalyst,<br>
the coating of an SCR catalyst, and<br>
if appropriate a downstream oxidation catalyst.<br>
The oxidation catalyst which is optionally provided upstream<br>
is used to increase the SCR activity at low exhaust-gas<br>
temperatures (in particular in the case of a diesel<br>
automobile) . By increasing the NO2 content (optimum: 50% by<br>
vol.) in the exhaust gas by means of partial oxidation of NO,<br>
it is possible to significantly increase the reaction rate of<br>
the SCR reaction in a temperature range below approximately<br>
573 K. In addition, carbon monoxide is oxidized to form carbon<br>
dioxide and incompletely burnt hydrocarbons are reacted to<br>
form carbon dioxide and water at the catalyst surface. If an<br>
upstream region with an oxidation coating of this type were<br>
not used, the oxidation of the hydrocarbons would take place<br>
in part at the SCR catalyst and would therefore reduce the<br>
nitrogen oxide conversion rate.<br>
The coating of a hydrolysis catalyst allows an aqueous urea<br>
solution to be completely broken down even at low<br>
temperatures, for example around 470 K. Decomposition of the<br>
urea has proven difficult below approx. 470 K, since<br>
undesirable by-products may form on account of incomplete<br>
decomposition. The coating of the SCR catalyst serves for the<br>
selective reduction of the nitrogen oxides NOX with ammonia to<br>
form the harmless products nitrogen and water.<br>
According to a further configuration of the high-temperature-<br>
resistant fiber layer, the coating comprises washcoat. Coating<br>
the relatively smooth surfaces of the fibers with washcoat<br>
causes the catalytically active surface area to be increased.<br>
This fissured surface on the one hand ensures that sufficient<br>
space is available for fixing a catalyst (e.g. platinum,<br>
rhodium, etc.) and on the other hand serves to swirl up the<br>
exhaust gas flowing through, effecting particularly intensive<br>
contact with the catalyst.<br>
The washcoat layer with a large surface area promoting<br>
catalysis is applied in a known way by the fiber layer (or<br>
subsequently the entire particulate trap comprising fiber<br>
layers and metal foils) being immersed in a liquid washcoat<br>
dispersion or sprayed with such a dispersion. Then, the excess<br>
washcoat dispersion is removed, the washcoat in the fiber<br>
layer is dried and finally the entire assembly is calcined at<br>
temperatures of generally over 450°C. During calcining, the<br>
volatile constituents of the washcoat dispersion are expelled,<br>
so that a temperature-resistant, catalysis-promoting layer<br>
with a high specific surface area is produced. If appropriate,<br>
this operation is repeated a number of times in order to<br>
achieve a desired layer thickness. The mean layer thickness is<br>
preferably in a range from 0.001 to 0.02 mm, in particular<br>
between 0.005 and 0.012 mm.<br>
The washcoat usually consists of a mixture of an aluminum<br>
oxide and at least one promoter oxide, such as for example<br>
rare-earth oxides, zirconium oxide, nickel oxide, iron oxide,<br>
germanium oxide and barium oxide. The washcoat dispersion must<br>
have optimum flow properties during its application during its<br>
application to the honeycomb body, in order to achieve a<br>
desired uniform layer thickness over the entire passage<br>
length.<br>
To achieve flow properties of this nature, known washcoat<br>
dispersions have a specified pH, and only a limited solids<br>
content is permitted. However, tests have shown that a<br>
washcoat dispersion of this nature has a time-dependent<br>
viscosity. This means that the washcoat dispersion very<br>
quickly forms a gel, preventing a uniform layer thickness frorr.<br>
being generated. This gelation can be delayed by keeping the<br>
washcoat dispersion in motion, i.e. moving, in particular<br>
vibrating, the dispersion or the filter layer which it wets.<br>
According to yet a further configuration of the fiber layer,<br>
the latter consists of a porous sintered and/or fiber material<br>
(e.g. steel). In this context, in particular high-temperature-<br>
resistant, corrosion-resistant steels with relatively high<br>
chromium, nickel, aluminum and/or molybdenum contents are<br>
recommended. In this context, it is particularly advantageous<br>
for the fiber layer to include fibers with a mean diameter of<br>
less than 0.082 mm, in particular in a range from 0.01 to 0.05<br>
mm. To prevent a filter layer of this type from generating a<br>
high dynamic pressure in the exhaust-gas stream, it is<br>
proposed for the fiber layer to have a porosity of at least<br>
50%, in particular at least 75%, preferably at least 85% and<br>
for preference even at least 95%. In this context, it should<br>
be noted that fiber layers of this type can be produced<br>
relatively successfully using fibers with a mean length of 0.4<br>
mm to 0.05 mm, in which case it is preferable to select<br>
shorter fiber lengths for thicker fibers.<br>
Furthermore, it is proposed for the fiber layer, in a<br>
longitudinal section substantially parallel to the largest<br>
outer surface, to have openings which on average have a size<br>
of 0.01 mm to 0.5 mm, in particular 0.05 mm to 0.25 mm. At<br>
this point, it should be pointed out that the fiber layer may<br>
fundamentally include fibers in virtually any desired<br>
arrangement, and is to be understood as encompassing in<br>
particular random layers, woven fabrics or other similar<br>
structures. In this case, regular structures may also be<br>
present only in regions, whereas a more chaotic arrangement of<br>
the fibers is present in the remaining regions.<br>
To ensure that sufficiently large cavities for particulates<br>
and/or their agglomerates are provided, it is proposed here,<br>
in particular for use in exhaust systems of diesel engines,<br>
for a certain pore size to be provided. A longitudinal section<br>
through the material which shows small cross sections of the<br>
pores or cavities, referred to here as openings, is used to<br>
determine the pore size. On average, all these openings have<br>
an extent in the range mentioned above. What is meant in this<br>
context is a mean of all the maximum extents of the openings<br>
which can be seen in longitudinal section. Since the dimension<br>
of the opening relates to the fiber layer which has already<br>
been coated, it is also possible to use a corresponding mean<br>
fiber spacing which is preferably to be selected as less than<br>
0.6 mm, in particular between 0.05 mm and 0.35 mm.<br>
Furthermore, it is proposed for the fiber layer to have a<br>
thickness of less than 3 mm, in particular less than 1.5 mm,<br>
preferably less than 0.5 mm and for preference less than 0.1<br>
mm. The thicknesses mentioned here are selected in particular<br>
with a view to the use of the fiber layer for particulate<br>
traps for the purification of exhaust gases from mobile<br>
internal combustion engines.<br>
A further aspect of the invention proposes a particulate trap<br>
for purifying exhaust gases from mobile internal combustion<br>
engines which has at least one partially structured metal foil<br>
and at least one high-temperature-resistant fiber layer of the<br>
type described above, in which, preferably, a plurality of<br>
structured metal foils and a plurality of fiber layers are<br>
arranged alternately and in particular wound together in a<br>
housing. This forms in particular an "open" particulate trap,<br>
as described in the introduction. Accordingly, it is<br>
especially advantageous to form an "open" filter element as<br>
described in documents DE 201 17 873 U1, DE 201 17 659 U1, WO<br>
02/00326, WO 01/92692, WO 01/80978.<br>
Furthermore, it is proposed for the particulate trap to form<br>
passages running substantially parallel to the axis, with<br>
guide surfaces, preferably guide surfaces of the metal foil,<br>
projecting into at least some of the passages and diverting<br>
gas streams flowing through the passages toward the fiber<br>
layer. Guide surfaces of this type may be formed by<br>
projections, bosses, micro-undulations, vanes or similar<br>
structures. It is also possible for these guide surfaces to be<br>
formed by edges of holes in metal foils of this type. The<br>
guide surfaces themselves may likewise have holes.<br>
According to a further configuration, the particulate trap has<br>
a volume, and the quantity of coating of the particulate trap<br>
based on this volume is in the range from 20 to 300 g/1 (grams<br>
per liter), preferably even between 50 and 120 g/1. In this<br>
context, the term volume is to be understood as meaning the<br>
volume which is composed of the metal foils, the fiber layers<br>
and the passages formed. A volume of this type is usually in<br>
the range from 0.01 1 to 1.5 1, preferably between 0.3 1 and<br>
0.8 1.<br>
Furthermore, it is proposed for the at least one, at least<br>
partially structured metal foil to have apertures which extend<br>
over at least one structure width, preferably even over 2, in<br>
particular 3 structure widths. This means that, for example,<br>
an aperture of this type connects a plurality of adjacent<br>
passages formed by the structure to one another. This ensures<br>
particularly effective mixing between the partial exhaust-gas<br>
streams without an undesirably high dynamic pressure being<br>
generated upstream of the particulate trap. In this context,<br>
it should also be noted that the apertures extend<br>
substantially in the plane of the metal foil.<br>
The invention will now be explained in more detail with<br>
reference to the figures. In this context, it should be noted<br>
that the figures show particularly preferred exemplary<br>
embodiments of the invention, but the invention is not<br>
restricted to these embodiments. In the accompanying figures.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a diagrammatic, exploded view of a detail of a<br>
particulate trap according to the invention,<br>
Fig. 2 shows a further detail of a configuration of the<br>
particulate trap according to the invention,<br>
Fig. 3 diagrammatically depicts a configuration of an exhaust<br>
system of a mobile internal combustion engine,<br>
Fig. 4 shows a diagrammatic and perspective illustration of a<br>
further configuration of the particulate trap according to the<br>
invention,<br>
Fig. 5 diagrammatically depicts a longitudinal section through<br>
a configuration of the fiber layer in accordance with the<br>
invention, and<br>
Fig. 6 shows a further longitudinal section through a fiber<br>
layer in the coated state.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a diagrammatic, exploded view of a detail of a<br>
particulate trap as is used, for example, to treat the exhaust<br>
gas from mobile internal combustion engines. The figure<br>
illustrates two fiber layers 1 according to the invention,<br>
between which a metal foil 14 is arranged. The fiber layers 1<br>
each have a section 3 in which a coating 4 is arranged. This<br>
coating 4 may be the coating of an oxidation catalyst, of a<br>
three-way catalyst and/or of an SCR catalyst. It is preferable<br>
for the metal foils 14 (at least in partial regions) to have a<br>
catalytically active and/or storing coating. It is usual for<br>
the adjacent layers to bear against one another, and they are<br>
preferably connected to one another by a joining technique, in<br>
particular by soldering. For this purpose it is necessary, for<br>
example, for a partial region, in particular the edge of the<br>
fiber layer 1, not to be coated, in order to ensure that the<br>
possibility of forming connections by a joining technique is<br>
preserved in this partial region.<br>
The structuring of the metal foil 14 allows an exhaust gas to<br>
flow through this "sandwich" of smooth layers (fiber layer 1)<br>
and corrugated layer (metal foil 14) in a direction of flow<br>
21. Guide surfaces 18 are arranged in the passages 17, causing<br>
the partial gas stream to be swirled up, so that they are<br>
guided in particular onto the coated fiber layer 1. The<br>
structure of the metal foil 14 is in this case a corrugated<br>
structure with a predetermined structure width 36. It is<br>
preferable for the guide surfaces 18 and/or apertures 19 below<br>
to be designed to be larger than the structure width 36, so<br>
that a plurality of adjacent passages 17 can be connected to<br>
one another through the apertures 19.<br>
Fig. 2 shows an arrangement of metal foils 14 and a fiber<br>
layer 1 in detail. Once again, the metal foils 14 and the<br>
fiber layer 1 are arranged alternately, the structure of the<br>
metal foils 14 in combination with the fiber layer 1 forming<br>
passages 17 through which the exhaust gas can flow in a<br>
direction of flow 21. Guide surfaces 18, which are produced<br>
from the metal foil 14 itself by stamping, pressing or in some<br>
other way, project into the passages 17. This simultaneously<br>
creates apertures 19, so that a partial edge flow "peels off"<br>
from the gas flowing through a passage 17 and can be diverted<br>
toward the fiber layer 1. In this way, the particulates 22 are<br>
also entrained and guided toward the fiber layer 1, where they<br>
remain on the outer surface 9, for example sticking to it or<br>
accumulating in cavities, pores or similar openings in the<br>
fiber layer 1. The fiber layer 12 illustrated here has a<br>
plurality of chaotically arranged fibers 6 which are provided<br>
with a coating 4. Overall, the fiber layer 1 has a thickness<br>
12 of less than 3 mm.<br>
Fig. 3 diagrammatically depicts the structure of an exhaust<br>
system of an automobile internal combustion engine 13. The<br>
exhaust gas which is generated in the internal combustion<br>
engine 13 is fed via an exhaust pipe 23 to the numerous<br>
components for exhaust-gas treatment before ultimately being<br>
released to the environment. The exhaust system illustrated in<br>
Fig. 3 includes the following components in succession in the<br>
direction of flow 21: a starting catalytic converter 24, a<br>
turbo charger 25, an oxidation catalytic converter 26, a<br>
reducing-agent feed 27, a mixer 28, a particulate trap 2<br>
according to the invention and a main catalytic converter 29.<br>
The starting catalytic converter 24 is distinguished by its<br>
particularly small volume (for example less than 0.1 liter)<br>
and, on account of its low heat capacity and its immediate<br>
proximity to the engine, has been heated up sufficiently for<br>
it to be possible to catalytically convert pollutants<br>
contained in the exhaust gas just a short time after the<br>
engine has started (e.g. to temperatures of over 230°C after a<br>
few seconds). The function of the oxidation catalytic<br>
converter 26 upstream of a particulate trap 2 for regeneration<br>
has already been explained extensively above. The reducing-<br>
agent feed 27 and the mixer 28 are used, for example, to<br>
supply solid or liquid urea, so that it is also possible to<br>
convert pollutants using the SCR method. The mixer 28 may be<br>
designed as a guide surface, a grate, a honeycomb body or in<br>
some similar form. However, it is also possible to omit the<br>
mixer 28 upstream of the particulate trap 2, since the<br>
particulate filter 2 itself is also responsible for swirling<br>
up the exhaust-gas stream and/or finely distributing the<br>
reducing agent which has been introduced. The downstream main<br>
catalytic converter 29 usually has a relatively large volume,<br>
in particular of greater than 1.5 liters.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a perspective and diagrammatic view of the<br>
structure of a particulate trap 2. The particulate trap 2 for<br>
the purification of exhaust gases from mobile internal<br>
combustion engines comprises a structured metal foil 14 and a<br>
high-temperature-resistant fiber layer 1, which are arranged<br>
helically around an axis 16 of the particulate trap 2 (simple<br>
stacked arrangements, S-shaped loops or other wound<br>
arrangements of the metal foils and/or fiber layers are also<br>
possible as alternatives). The metal foil 14 and the fiber<br>
layer 1 form passages 17 which extend through the particulate<br>
trap 2 substantially parallel to the axis 16. The assembly<br>
comprising metal foil 14 and fiber layer 1 is accommodated in<br>
a housing 15 and is advantageously also connected to this<br>
housing by a joining technique. In the embodiment of the<br>
particulate trap 2 which is illustrated, the housing 15<br>
projects beyond the end face 34 of the particulate trap 2 or<br>
the metal foil 14 and the fiber layer 1. The material<br>
thickness 30 of the corrugated metal foil 14 is preferably in<br>
a range below 0.05 mm, preferably even below 0.02 mm. In this<br>
context, it is recommended in particular for the material<br>
thickness 30 or the coating 4 (not shown) or other parameters<br>
of the particulate trap 2 not to be constant over the entire<br>
length 31 of the particulate trap 2, which means, for example,<br>
that in a first length section 32, the particulate trap 2 has<br>
a lower heat capacity, a higher porosity, a higher loading<br>
with regard to the catalytically active coating, a greater<br>
number/size of apertures 19, guide surfaces 18 or fibers than<br>
in a second length section 33. In principle, it is also<br>
possible for the particulate trap 2 to be divided into more<br>
than two length sections.<br>
The particulate trap 2 illustrated has a volume 20 which is<br>
characterized by the volume in the interior of the housing 20<br>
which is filled by the fiber layer 1 and the metal foil 14,<br>
also encompassing the volume of the passages 17. With regard<br>
to the coating 4, the particulate trap according to the<br>
invention is provided with a quantity in the range from 20 to<br>
300 g/1. In this context, it is possible for this quantity to<br>
be arranged over the entire length 31 uniformly on the outer<br>
surfaces 9 of the fiber layer 1 and/or the metal foil 14, but<br>
it is also possible for only the fiber layer 1 or only partial<br>
regions of the metal foil 14 to be provided with a<br>
catalytically active coating 4. It is also possible for<br>
different types or quantities of the coating 4 to be provided<br>
in different length sections.<br>
Fig. 5 diagrammatically depicts the longitudinal section 8<br>
through the fiber layer 1. In this context, it can be seen<br>
that the fiber layer 1 is formed by a multiplicity of fibers<br>
6, which are in this case connected to one another in<br>
partially ordered and partially random fashion. The fibers 6<br>
preferably have a diameter 7 in the range from 0.012 to 0.03 5<br>
mm. Openings 10 are formed by the arrangement of the fibers 6<br>
in the longitudinal section 8. These openings in practice<br>
constitute a cross section through the cavities which are<br>
formed in the interior of the fiber layer 1.<br>
Fig. 6 likewise diagrammatically depicts a longitudinal<br>
section 8 through the fiber layer 1, the fibers 6 now being<br>
designed with a coating 4. The coating 4 comprises washcoat 5,<br>
which on account of its fissured surface offers sufficient<br>
options for the accumulation of the catalytically active<br>
substances 35. Despite the coating 4, the longitudinal section<br>
8 still has openings 10 with an extent 11. This extent 11 of<br>
all the openings 10 on average is between 0.05 and 0.4 mm. At<br>
the same time, it is preferable to maintain a porosity of<br>
approx. 87%.<br>
The present invention is the result of a large number of<br>
technically complex attempts to improve the efficiency of<br>
particulate traps in the exhaust systems of automobile<br>
internal combustion engines.<br>
