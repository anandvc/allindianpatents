				<td>HIGH MECHANICAL AND OPTICAL PERFORMANCE ILLUMINATION<br>
SYSTEM<br>
The present invention relates to the special shaping of<br>
phosphore particles known elsewhere, capable of<br>
guaranteeing, on the one hand, high mechanical and<br>
optical properties, such as mechanical strength under<br>
the most exacting handling conditions, strength impact<br>
resistance, abrasion resistance, crush and crack<br>
resistance and, possibly, delamination in the case of a<br>
deposit on a substrate, shear strength, flexural<br>
strength, etc. and, on the other hand, transparency,<br>
the virtual absence of haze, controlled light<br>
transmission between values that can approach 100% and<br>
low values in the case of highly scattering materials,<br>
optical homogeneity, absence of degradation and<br>
yellowing, particularly under the effect of excitation,<br>
etc.<br>
The term phosphore particles refers to particles that<br>
are able to emit light, particularly in the long<br>
wavelength region of the visible spectrum, under the<br>
effect of excitation by UV radiation, an electron beam,<br>
X-rays, gamma radiation or an electric field, these<br>
particles having a size, for example, that lies between<br>
a few nanometers and a few microns, and being used<br>
particularly in lamps in the form of powdered masses.<br>
In addition, application FR-A1-2 829 4 81 mentions<br>
separately the coating of "phosphore particles with a<br>
stabilizing sodium silicate film on the one hand and,<br>
on the other hand, the deposition of dispersions<br>
possibly with other phosphores, in the form of<br>
transparent films on a glass substrate. However, the<br>
document does not specify how a film, or all the more a<br>
transparent film, is to be obtained.<br>
The invention now provides composites of phosphore<br>
particles capable of preserving integrity of state and<br><br>
shape over long periods, under normal conditions of use<br>
(assembly, installation, cleaning, etc.).<br>
This objective is achieved by the invention, the<br>
subject of which is an illumination system consisting<br>
of phosphore particles dispersed in a solid, durable<br>
matrix, while enabling it to be handled by a user.<br>

These phosphore particles or these mixtures of<br>
phosphore particles are characterized by the emission<br>
of long wavelength radiation in the visible region,<br>
corresponding to different colors, white light, or in<br>
the IR or UV. The last three mentioned in the above<br>
list are notable for the intensity, persistence and<br>
duration of their activity, after any excitation source<br>
has been removed, in particular at night.<br>
The invention therefore makes it possible to provide<br>
handlable, reliable, strong solid illuminating objects<br>
that can coat a multitude of forms, such as a coating<br>
on a substrate, capable of illuminating in various<br>
colors, opening the way to the most novel and varied<br>
esthetic or artistic creations.<br>
Preferably, the particles are phosphores within the<br>
visible region, in which most of the applications<br>
envisaged below present the greatest interest.<br>
The particles can be excited by electromagnetic<br>
radiation in the UV, visible, IR region or by X-rays or<br>
by gamma rays, or by a beam of particles (electrons,<br>
ions) or by an electric field. Excitation by UV may be<br>
derived from the deexcitation of a plasma or of an<br>
ionized gas.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the matrix is<br>
inorganic and comprises, in a particularly preferred<br>
manner, lithium silicate. It should be stated that<br>
sodium silicates, and to a lesser extent potassium<br>
silicates, are suitable if need be for an opaque<br><br>
illumination system, lithium silicate being<br>
particularly recommended for a transparent illumination<br>
system. Accordingly, it has been observed with sodium<br>
silicate that there is a migration to the surface of a<br>
very hygroscopic and scattering crust based on sodium<br>
hydroxide that is continually regenerated. Lithium<br>
silicate proves to be notable for the possibility of<br>
distributing therein, in a uniform manner, high<br>
concentrations of phosphore particles in the most<br>
separated state possible, as well as for its<br>
compatibility with many substrates, including glass. On<br>
account of the fact that the matrix comprises lithium<br>
silicate, it will be understood that, in reality, the<br>
matrix is a product of the partial or total conversion<br>
of lithium silicate, in particular into silica, in<br>
which lithium silicate and/or lithium remain entirely<br>
detectable.<br>
According to another embodiment, the matrix comprises a<br>
product of the polymerization/polycondensation of a<br>
silicon alkoxide such as tetraethoxysilane (TEOS),<br>
tetramethoxysilane (TMOS), methyltriethoxysilane<br>
(MTEOS) and the like. These precursors of the matrix<br>
provide excellent conditions for compatibility with<br>
many phosphore particles, among those previously<br>
mentioned.<br>
In a practical and effective embodiment of the<br>
invention, the matrix is in the form of a thin layer<br>
adhering to a substrate consisting in particular of<br>
glass, for example in the form of a sheet, but also of<br>
a slab intended to constitute an electronic display<br>
screen, a tube, in particular for lighting, fiber or<br>
fabric or plastic. For the latter, reference may be<br>
made to any generally transparent plastic such as<br>
polycarbonate, polyvinyl butyral, a polyolefin such as<br>
polyethylene or polypropylene, poly(ethylene<br>
terephthalate) , polyurethane, acrylic polymer such as<br>
poly(methyl methacrylate), an ionomer resin, various<br><br>
copolymers, etc., the use of which is of course limited<br>
by possible formation of a thin layer at. a temperature<br>
capable of affecting or degrading the plastic.<br>
The invention comprises two main variants.<br>
According to the first variant, the phosphore particles<br>
are in aqueous suspension and their size is at most<br>
equal to 100 nm, preferably 3 0 nm, preferably 10 nm,<br>
and the assembly that they form with the matrix is<br>
transparent.<br>
According to the second variant, the size of the<br>
phosphore particles lies between 0.5 and 10 nm, it<br>
being possible for particles scattering visible light<br>
to be then advant advantageously incorporated in the matrix<br>
(particles may be involved other than phosphore<br>
particles having a size of, in particular, between<br>
100 nm and 1 µm, in particular between 300 and 700 nm,<br>
such as alumina, or phosphore particles themselves;<br>
these light-scattering particles are dielectric,<br>
semiconduction or conducting particles).<br>
Thus, phosphore particles with a size between 30 and<br>
500 nm are not excluded from the invention, those<br>
having in particular a size at least equal to 400 nm<br>
that are capable of scattering visible light making it<br>
unnecessary to add other scattering particles.<br>
In a particularly advantageous embodiment of the<br>
illumination system of the invention, in the case where<br>
the matrix is in the form of a thin layer adhering to a<br>
substrate, the latter is capable of exciting phosphore<br>
particles, and is in particular an electroconductor, in<br>
particular of the UV electroluminescent type.<br>
In an equally advantageous embodiment, the substrate is<br>
capable of emitting radiation with a waveletngth in the<br>
visible region under suitable excitation. It is then,<br><br>
for example, made of glass with a cerium content,<br>
capable of emitting blue light under ultraviolet<br>
radiation.<br>
According to another alternative of the design of the<br>
illumination system, two cases may be distinguished in<br>
which:<br>
the phosphore particles emitting different<br>
wavelengths are associated, separated from each<br>
other and homogenized, so as to produce white<br>
light, yellow light, etc., on the one hand; and<br>
the phosphore particles that are identical or emit<br>
different wavelengths are combined in variable<br>
compositions and/or concentrations, so as to form<br>
signs such as written or similar signs, or for any<br>
other, especially decorative, purpose.<br>
The main processes for preparing the illumination<br>
system of the invention consist of:<br>
cold deposition processes by means of a liquid,<br>
such as spray coating, flow coating, dip coating,<br>
spin coating, screen printing, followed by a heat<br>
treatment at 100-650°C, for example (annealing,<br>
tempering, etc.) according to the nature of the<br>
matrix; or<br>
a vacuum deposition process.<br>
In addition, other subjects of the invention are:<br>
the application of an illumination system as<br>
described above to a transparent device;<br>
the application of the illumination system to a<br>
light-scattering device;<br>
the application of the illumination system to a<br>
lamp, in particular a thin one, or to a device<br>
illuminating at night, in particular for signs, or<br>
for decorative purposes or to a flat lamp as<br>
described in the application WO 04/15739;<br>
the application of the illumination system to<br>
monolithic, laminated, single glazing or multiple<br><br>
glazing designed for buildings, to a transport<br>
vehicle, such as an automobile rear window, side<br>
window or roof, to any other terrestrial or<br>
aquatic vehicle or aircraft, to street furniture,<br>
such as a bus shelter, to a road sign or to an<br>
advertisement panel, to an aquarium, to a store<br>
window, to a glasshouse, to interior furniture, to<br>
a mirror, to a screen for a display system of the<br>
computer type, to a television, to a telephone, to<br>
electrically controllable glazing such as<br>
electrochromic glass, to liquid crystals, to<br>
electroluminescent material or to photovoltaic<br>
glass.<br>
It is stated that in this last application, the<br>
association of the illumination system with glazing is<br>
compatible with all known practical applications<br>
thereof, either on the same face as that supporting the<br>
illumination system, above or below, or on other faces<br>
of the glazing, namely a hydrophobic/oleophobic,<br>
hydrophilic/oleophilic, anti-soiling photocatalytic<br>
layer, a multilayer reflecting thermal radiation (solar<br>
protection layer) or IR (low-e layer), antireflection<br>
layer, etc.<br>
As a valuable example, mention may be made of glazing<br>
that separating, for example, an enclosure in a<br>
building from the outside atmosphere, the inner face of<br>
which is illuminating according to the invention, and<br>
the outer face of which is electrochromic, that is to<br>
say capable of being darkened by applying a voltage to<br>
the layer. In this way, the functionality obtained is<br>
that of illuminating the interior while blocking off<br>
external light.<br>
In the illuminating glazing application according to<br>
the invention, the glazing guarantees maximum<br>
transparency and maximum optical quality in the absence<br><br>
of excitation, and constitutes an illuminating surface<br>
in the presence of excitation.<br>
The screen application for a display system can be<br>
generalized to any application requiring a light source<br>
and means of treatment thereof, in the form of a light<br>
box.<br>
It consists in particular of backlight.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the following examples<br>
of embodiments.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
YVO4:Eu nanoparticles were first of all synthesized by<br>
a colloidal method.<br>
The entire synthesis of colloidal solutions was carried<br>
out in water at a temperature of 60°C. The insoluble<br>
citrate complex was formed by mixing 0.75 equivalents<br>
of sodium citrate (0.1 mol/1, 15 ml) with 1 equivalent<br>
of (Y,Eu) (NO3)3 (0.1 mol/1, 20 ml). Addition of 0.75<br>
equivalents of an Na3VO4 solution with a pH of 12.5<br>
(0.1 mol/1, 15 ml) caused the precipitate to dissolve<br>
and the reaction to start. The pH of the clear solution<br>
obtained was 7.6. At the end of 30 minutes of reaction,<br>
heating was stopped. The colloidal solution obtained<br>
was then dialyzed in water at neutral pH so as to<br>
eliminate various counterions (Na+, NO3-) or any<br>
unreacted species. Following the dialysis step, the<br>
concentration of the colloidal solution was of the<br>
order 10-2 mol/1.<br>
The colloidal solutions were then concentrated by<br>
evaporation to dryness under mild conditions (40°C<br>
under vacuum). The powder obtained was easily<br>
redispersed in a very small quantity of water which<br>
enabled very concentrated colloidal solutions to be<br><br>
obtained (up to 2 mol/1, that is 400 g/1) Moreover, the<br>
size measured by light scattering after redispersion<br>
(10V3 nm) was identical to that of the colloid obtained<br>
after dialysis: the colloids underwent no aggregation<br>
during the concentration step. As a consequence, the<br>
concentrated colloidal solutions were optically<br>
transparent.<br>
Transparent luminescent films were prepared in the<br>
following way: 0.2 to 1 ml of lithium silicate (30% by<br>
mass in water, pH 12) was added to 4 ml of the<br>
concentrated colloidal solution of YVO4:Eu<br>
nanoparticles. The sol obtained was filtered (glass<br>
fiber prefilter and 0.45 µm filter) and then deposited<br>
by centrifuging (speed of rotation 1000 rpm for 60<br>
seconds) onto a float glass substrate (5x5 cm2). The<br>
thin films obtained were finally annealed at 450°C for<br>
12 hours. The purpose of this heat treatment was to<br>
consolidate the film mechanically and to increase the<br>
luminescence (elimination of hydroxyl groups that<br>
inhibit the luminescence of europium ions). After<br>
annealing, the thin films were perfectly transparent<br>
and had a thickness of between 0.2 and 0.7 µm.<br>
The thin films were placed under a UV lamp emitting at<br>
254 nm. Red luminescence, characteristic of europium<br>
ions, was observed within the YVO4 matrix. Luminance<br>
measurements were carried out and confirmed what was<br>
visually observed: light emission was more intense on<br>
the cut edge of the film than in the center. Indeed,<br>
the luminance was 5 Cd/m2 at the center whereas it was<br>
2 0 Cd/m2 at the cut edge.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
This example describes the preparation of scattering<br>
luminescent layers.<br><br>
12.8 g of alumina particles with a mean diameter of<br>
500 nm were added to 176 g of deionized water together<br>
with 0.24 g of polyacrylic acid (50% by weight solution<br>
in water). Sodium hydroxide was then added until a pH<br>
of 10 was reached. 5 g of LaPO4:Ce,Tb particles with a<br>
mean diameter of 2 µm, sold by Nichia, were then added.<br>
The mixture was then homogenized in a turbine for 5<br>
minutes. 11 g of lithium silicate (30% by weight<br>
solution in water) were then added. After 5 minutes of<br>
homogenization in a turbine, the mixture was deposited<br>
on a 10 x 10 cm2 glass substrate by flow coating.<br>
Drying was carried out under an IR lamp (temperature of<br>
the coating approximately 80°C). The coating obtained<br>
had a TL of 60% and haze close to 100%.<br>
Green luminescence produced in the coating was observed<br>
under photoexcitation at 257 nm.<br><br>
