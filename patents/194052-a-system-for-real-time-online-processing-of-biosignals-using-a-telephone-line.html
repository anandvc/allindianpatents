BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Telemedicine is a term used to describe a type of medical service involving monitoring of a patient's condition by a healthcare worker located at a healthcare facility, which is remote with respect to the location of the patient. Telemedicine is capable of providing enormous benefits to society by bridging the gap between the availability of the medical service by competent medical personnel as well as the acute need for the medical service in rural and remote areas.<br>
India with majority of the population living in rural and remote areas do not have proper access to medical facilities and interpretation of bio*signals acquired during medical processes by competent medical personnel. A timely intervention by medical personnel in the process could be very helpful in delivering appropriate medical care saving lives in many cases.<br>
In the event of non-availability of competent medical services in the remote, rural and semi-urban areas, the needy are required to travel long distances, spend valuable time and money in getting access to proper medical services. The situation could assume very difficult propositions when there are medical emergencies, which need to be attended to immediately.<br>
The current telemedicine models being employed in the country do not provide relief to the needy by analyzing and interpreting their bio-signals. Hence, the current technology platform is invented which takes into account the available telecommunication infrastructure in the country and readily available information technology products and medical devices for processing of bio-signals on-line and real time mode.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
In developing countries there are three basic barriers,<br>
1.	Lack of telecommunication infrastructure.<br>
2.	Funds.<br>
3.	Trained medical practitioners &amp; paramedical staff.<br><br>
This invention has resolved the barrier of telecommunication infrastructure by a breal through technology using an ordinary telephone that is commonly available in rural areas today for transmission between both the ends.<br>
This invention has broken the barrier of the cost by supplying the hardware and software to all the nursing homes &amp; small clinics with very low of capital cost on pay-per-use model, making every nursing home &amp; small clinics eligible to upgrade its services.<br>
It is, however, true that the human factor is the biggest barrier-lack of knowledge and skills in telemedicine, lack of familiarity or discomfort with technology, lack of acceptance in clinical practice style. This technology is so user-friendly that doctors and paramedical staff feel very comfortable after 2 days of training. Continuous contact with specialist doctors shall improve the style of clinical practice of primary care doctors.<br>
The subject invention provides methods of Acquiring, transmitting, receiving, viewing, forwarding, Reporting, Storing and retrieving all types of Bio-signals (like 12 Lead ECG Signals, EEG, Spirometry, Heart and lung sounds being the output from an electronic stethoscope, SPO2, NIBP, Temperature, Respiration, IBP, Et C02 etc.,) along with present, past personal and family medical history of subjects and images either stationery (or) mobile using Phone line, (pulse/tone phone) Mobile Phones (GSM, GPRS,CDMA) ISDN, leased line, VSAT, world wide web. The bio-signals (12 Lead ECG Signals) are sent either automatically (or) as chosen by user to a central server (or) a stand-alone computer for interpretation, review of the subject's clinical conditions either locally (or) from remote site for automatic retrieval of the interpreted bio-signals, offered informal clinical advise by the Remote center in a printable format chosen by the user<br>
This system is the efficient convergence of medical, computer and telecommunication technologies to bring the medical expertise to the patient, irrespective of the place, distance and the time.<br><br>
Medical technology - deploys the system enabled dual purpose ECG recorder-cum-monitor that saves time during the first critical moments of an emergency as both the applications are performed by the same system using a software switch.<br>
Computer technology - uses proprietary interactive technology enabling transmission of bio signals and data online in real time using low and ultra low bandwidth telecommunication technologies. This software is scalable and adaptable to all kinds of communication networks.<br>
Telecommunication technology - this system is designed to use the existing low and ultra low bandwidth telecommunication technology i.e., ordinary phone line for transmitting the ECG, vita! signs, text and online chat in real time.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION:<br>
We have already discussed the objects, which are beneficial to the human kind by using this technology, and there exists unmatched benefits especially to the nursing homes, small clinics and primary care doctors,<br>
1.	While using this technology by the medical staff, nursing homes and clinics they are empowered to treat the patients more appropriate.<br>
2.	While using this technology by the medical staff, nursing homes and clinics they are upgraded to an emergency care center and ability to offer specialists' services anytime, without large capital investment.<br>
3.	While using this technology by the medical staff, nursing homes and clinics they are decreased morality and morbidity through improved quality of care.<br>
4.	While using this technology by the medical staff, nursing homes and clinics they is interaction with the specialists leads to improved local standards of health care in the rural areas.<br>
5.	While using this technology by the medical staff, nursing homes and clinics the primary care doctor becomes the value-adding partner in the treatment chain and can retain and attract more number of patients.<br>
6.	While using this technology by the medical staff, nursing homes and clinics they is increased market share resulting in better earnings.<br><br>
7.	While using this technology by the medical staff, nursing homes and clinics they serve as an informal continuous medical education programme for medical and paramedical staff and as a health education medium for the patients.<br>
8.	While using this technology by the medical staff, nursing homes and clinics they are in the process of professional interaction involving the data capture and transfer there is an automatic up gradation of medical documentation into electronic format.<br>
