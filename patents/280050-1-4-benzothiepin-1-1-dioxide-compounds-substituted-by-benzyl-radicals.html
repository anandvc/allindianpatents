Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are, because their solubility in water is greater than that of the initial or basic compounds, particularly suitable for medical applications. These salts must have'a pharmaceutically acceptable anion or cation. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of the invention are salts of inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic, phosphoric, metaphosphoric, nitric and sulfuric acids, and organic acids such as, for example, acetic acid, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, citric, ethanesulfonic, fumaric, gluconic, glycolic, isethionic, lactic, lactobionic, maleic, malic, methanesulfonic, succinic, p-toluenesulfonic and tartaric acids. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable basic salts are ammonium salts, alkali metal salts (such as sodium and potassium salts), alkaline earth metal salts (such as magnesium and calcium salts), trometamol (2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-propanediol), diethanolamine, lysine or ethylenediamine.<br>
!<br>
Salts with a pharmaceutically unacceptable anion such as, for example, trifluoroacetate likewise belong within the framework of the invention as useful intermediates for preparing or purifying pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or for use in nontherapeutic, for example in vitro applications.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also exist in various polymorphous forms, e.g. as amorphous and crystalline polymorphous forms. All polymorphous forms of the compounds according to the invention belong within the framework of the invention and are a further aspect of the invention.<br>
All references to "compound(s) of formula I" hereinafter refer to compound(s) of the formula I as described herein, and the salts and solvates thereof as described herein.<br>
An alkyl radical means a straight-chain or branched hydrocarbon chain having up to '     eight carbons, such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, tert-butyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl. The alkyl radicals may be substituted once or more than once as described above.<br>
M<br>
 <br>
The compound(s) of the formula I can also be administered in combination with further active ingredients.<br>
The amount of a compound of formula I necessary to achieve the desired biological effect depends on a number of factors, for example the specific compound chosen, the intended use, the mode of administration and the clinical condition of the patient. The daily dose is generally in the range from 0.3 mg to 100 mg (typically from 3 mg and 50 mg) per day and per kilogram of body weight, for example 3-10 mg/kg/day. An intravenous dose may be for example in the range from 0.3 mg to 1.0 mg/kg, which can suitably be administered as infusion of from 10 ng to 100 ng per kilogram per minute. Suitable infusion solutions for these purposes may comprise for example from 0.1 ng to 10 mg, typically from 1 ng to 10 mg, per milliliter. Single doses may comprise for example from 1 mg to 10 g of the active ingredient. Thus, ampoules for injections may comprise for example from 1 mg to 100 mg, and single-dose formulations which can be administered orally, such as, for example, tablets or capsules, may comprise for example from 1.0 to 1000 mg, typically from 10 to 600 mg. For the therapy of the abovementioned conditions, the compounds of formula I may be used as the compound itself, but they are preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition with an acceptable carrier. The carrier must, of course, be acceptable in the sense that it is compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and is not harmful for the patient's health. The carrier may be a solid or a liquid or both and is preferably formulated with the compound as a single dose, for example as a tablet, which may contain from 0.05% to 95% by weight of the active ingredient. Other pharmaceutically active substances may likewise be present, including other compounds of formula I. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be produced by one of the known pharmaceutical methods, which essentially consist of mixing the ingredients with pharmacologically acceptable carriers and/or excipients.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are those suitable for oral, rectal, topical, peroral (for example sublingual) and parenteral (for example subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal or intravenous) administration, although the most suitable mode of administration depends in each individual case on the nature and severity of<br>
\%<br>
 <br>
the condition to be treated and on the nature of the compound of formula I used in each case. Coated formulations and coated slow-release formulations also belong within the framework of the invention. Preference is given to acid- and gastric juice-resistant formulations. Suitable coatings resistant to gastric juice comprise cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate and anionic polymers of methacrylic acid and methyl methacrylate.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical compounds for oral administration may be in the form of separate units such as, for example, capsules, cachets, suckable tablets or tablets, each of which contains a defined amount of the compound of formula I; as powders or granules; as solution or suspension in an aqueous or nonaqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion. These compositions may, as already mentioned, be prepared by any suitable pharmaceutical method which includes a step in which the active ingredient and the carrier (which may consist of one or more additional ingredients) are brought into contact. The compositions are generally produced by uniform and homogeneous mixing of the active ingredient with a liquid and/or finely divided solid carrier, after which the product is shaped if necessary. Thus, for example, a tablet can be produced by compressing or molding a powder or granules of the compound, where appropriate with one or more additional ingredients. Compressed tablets can be produced by tableting the compound in free-flowing form such as, for example, a powder or granules, where appropriate mixed with a binder, glidant, inert diluent and/or one (or more) surface-active/dispersing agent(s) in a suitable machine. Molded tablets can be produced by molding the compound, which is in powder form and is moistened with an inert liquid diluent, in a suitable machine.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions which are suitable for peroral (sublingual) administration comprise suckable tablets which contain a compound of formula I with a flavoring, normally sucrose and gum arabic or tragacanth, and pastilles which comprise the compound in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerol or sucrose and gum arabic.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for parenteral administration comprise preferably sterile aqueous preparations of a compound of formula I, which are<br>
»3<br>
 <br>
preferably isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. These preparations are preferably administered intravenously, although administration may also take place by subcutaneous, intramuscular or intradermal injection. These preparations can preferably be produced by mixing the compound with water and making the resulting solution sterile and isotonic with blood. Injectable compositions of the invention generally contain from 0.1 to 5% by weight of the active compound.<br>

The cDNA (complementary deoxyribonucleic acid) of human IBAT was cloned by standard methods of molecular biology as described for example in Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual by Joseph Sambrook and David Russell, and introduced into the pcDNAI vector from Invitrogen. The subsequent sequencing of the insert revealed complete identity with bases 599 to 1645 of the base sequence for human IBAT which was described by P.A. Dawson and is deposited in the GenBank sequence database (GenBank Accession Number: U10417). Bases 599 to 1645 correspond to the complete coding region of human IBAT.<br>
2.	Preparation of a recombinant cell line with constitutive expression of human<br>
IBAT<br>
The expression vector for human IBAT was introduced by stable transfection into CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells. To select single cell clones, 400 ug/ml Geneticin was added to the cell culture medium (Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin). The functionality of the single cell clones resulting from the selection was assayed via their uptake activity for radiolabeled taurocholic acid ([3H]-TCA). The cell clone with the highest uptake activity for [3H]-TCA, referred to hereinafter as CHO-hlBAT, was selected for the further assays and further cultured in the presence of 400 ug/ml Geneticin.<br>
3.	Measurement of the inhibitory effect of the compound of the invention on the<br>
IBAT-dependent uptake of taurocholic acid into cells<br>
CHO-hlBAT cells were seeded in a concentration of 40 000 cells per well in poly-D-lysine-coated 96-well plates in cell culture medium and cultured for 24 h. The cells were then washed once with sodium-free transport assay buffer (140 mM choline chloride, 2 mM potassium chloride, 1 mM magnesium chloride, 1 mM calcium chloride, 10 mM HEPES/Tris, pH 7.5) and subsequently incubated either with sodium-free transport assay buffer as negative control or with sodium-containing transport assay buffer (140 mM sodium chloride, 2 mM potassium chloride, 1 mM magnesium chloride, 1 mM calcium chloride, 10 mM HEPES/Tris, pH 7.5) as positive control at room temperature for 30 min. At the same time, the assay wells were also<br>
37<br>
 <br>
incubated in the presence of the compound to be investigated in varying concentration in sodium-containing transport assay buffer at room temperature for 30 min. The test substances were appropriately diluted in transport assay buffer (40 ul/well) starting from a 10 mM stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide. The assay was then started by adding 10 ul/well of a mixture of radiolabeled taurocholic acid ([3H]-TCA) and unlabeled taurocholic acid. The final concentration of taurocholic acid in the assay was 10 uM. After an incubation time of 60 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 ul/weli of sodium-free transport assay buffer (4°C), and each well was washed three times with sodium-free transport assay buffer. Finally, 100 pi of scintillation fluid were added to each well, and the radioactivity taken up into the celts was determined in a MicroBeta Scintillation Microplate Reader from Wallac.<br>
The half-maximum inhibitory effect of the test compound (IC50 value, inhibitory concentration 50) was determined in the following way:<br>
1.	Determination of the value for 0% inhibition. This is the measurement in the<br>
absence of substance, measured in sodium-containing transport assay buffer.<br>
i<br>
2.	Determination of the value for 100% inhibition. This is the measurement in the<br>
absence of substance, measured in sodium-free transport assay buffer.<br>
3. Calculation of the percentage inhibitions of those measurements carried out in the presence of various concentrations of the compound to be investigated. It was then possible to find therefrom the concentration of the compound which reduces the uptake of taurocholic acid by 50% (IC50 value).<br>
 <br>

The ion exchange resin is then separated off and washed twice with methanol. The solvent is evaporated, and 9 g of crude product are obtained. This is<br>
 <br>
dissolved in 40 ml of methanol and diluted with 150 ml of ethanol. 4.5 g of potassium salt Ex. 4 having a melting point of 220°C (with decomposition) crystallize out overnight at room temperature. By slow crystal growth from a solution of 2.5 of potassium salt Ex. 4 in 50 ml of methanol and 100 ml of ethanol (over 2 days), single crystals are obtained, with the aid of which it was possible to confirm the structure and stereochemistry of Ex. 4 by single crystal X-ray structure.<br>
Preparation of the zinc salt<br>
1.1 g of Ex! 4 (ammonium salt) areidissolved in 11 ml of water (yellowish clear solution) and admixed with a solution of 120 mg of zinc chloride in 13 ml of water. The precipitate which separates out spontaneously is stirred for a further 2 hours at room temperature and then filtered off with suction. Crystalline zinc salt (977 mg 88%) Ex. 4 is obtained.<br>
Preparation of the calcium salt<br>
In analogy to the preparation of the zinc salt, a voluminous precipitate of the calcium<br>
salt is obtained after addition of a solution of 85 mg of calcium chloride in 13 ml of<br>
if water, which precipitate proves difficult to filter off with suction and is hydroscopic<br>
(937 mg, 85%).<br>
Preparation of the magnesium salt<br>
In analogy to the preparation of the zinc salt, a colorless precipitate of the magnesium salt is obtained after addition of a solution of 72 mg of magnesium chloride in 11 ml of water, which magnesium salt is hydroscopic (977 mg, 89%).<br>
