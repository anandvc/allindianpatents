				<td>The present invention relates to methods and kits useful in the detection of<br>
autoantibodies reactive with pancreatic islet cell antigenac molecules and / or insulin,<br>
for example methods and kits useful in me detection of autoantibodies indicative of<br>
the onset or presence of insulin dependent diabetes mellius (IDDM, type 1 diabetes).<br>
Type 1 diabetes is one of the more prevalent autoimmune diseases affecting man, with<br>
more man 2 million individuals in Europe and North America suffering from the<br>
disease (M A Atkinson, G S Eisenbarth. Type 1 diabetes: new perspectives oa disease<br>
pathogenesis and treatment. The Lancet, 2001 358: 221-229). Furthermore, the<br>
incidence of type 1 diabetes is increasing worldwide by 2.5% per year aad it is<br>
estimated mat the incidence of this disease will be 40% higher in 2010 that in 1998<br>
(M A Atkinson, G S Eisenbarth. Type 1 diabetes: new perspectives on disease<br>
pathogenesis and treatment. The Lancet, 2001 358: 221-229).<br>
Autoantibodies to pancreatic β cell antigens are well recognised serological markers<br>
of type 1 diabetes and these include: autoantibodies reactive with islet eels in<br>
immunofluorescence tests (ICA), autoantibodies to ghitamic acid decarboxylase<br>
(GAD, in particular the 65 kDa isoform thereof,GAD65), autoaatibodies to protein<br>
tyrosine phosphatase-like islet cell antigen (which can be referred to as IA-2 or<br>
ICA512) and autoantibodies to insulin. GAD65 autoantibodies and IA-2<br>
autoantibodies are components of ICA reactivity (M A Atkinson, G S Eisenbarth.<br>
Type 1 diabetes: new perspectives on disease pathogenesis and treatment The<br>
Lancet, 2001 358: 221-229). At least one of the three types of autoantibodies to<br>
GAD65, IA-2 and insulin ate present at diagnosis in sere from about 90% of patients<br>
with type 1 diabetes (M A Atkinson, G S Eisenbarm. Type 1 diabetes: new<br>
perspectives on disease pathogenesis and treatment. The Lancet, 2001 358: 221-229).<br>
Measurement of the above mentioned autoantibodies being serotogical matters of<br>
autoimmunity to pancreatic β cells can also be useful in monitoring patients involved<br>
in trials for prevention of diabetes (M A Atkinson, G S Eisenbarth. Type 1 diabetes:<br><br>
new perspectives on disease pathogenems and treatment. The Lancet, 2001 358: 221-<br>
229).<br>
Currently, GAD65 autoantibodies are measured using imnamnopcerapitation assays<br>
(IPA) employing GAD65 radiaactfveiy labelled with 35S, 3H or 125I GAD65 labelled<br>
with 35S or 3H has been produced in an in vitro transcription/translation system (C E<br>

Recombinant fusion proteins of GAD65 and IA-2 have alao beea used in IP As for<br><br>

Chemistry, 2001 47(5):926-934).<br>
Currently available IP As based on 35S-GAD65 have, however, been technically<br>
demanding, difficult to standardise, relatively expensive and have not been adaptable<br>
to a kit format. Assays based on human recombinant 125I-GAD65 have been of equal<br>
sensitivity and specificity to assays bated on 35S-GAD65, aad have exhibited the<br>
added advantage of good reproductbility, technical simplicity, lower costs and have<br>
been easily adapted into a kit Unfortunately, however, assays based on 125I-GAD65<br>
isolated from rat or porcine brain tissue have suffered from lower specificity due to<br>
contamination with GAD65 isoform.<br>
GAD65 autoantibodies have also been measured by differed types of ELISAs (A M<br>
Gronowski, E C C Wong, T R Wilhite, D L Martin, C H Smith, C A Parvin, M Landt.<br>
Detection of glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies with the varelisa ELISA.<br>

risk-assessment marker for insulin-dependent diabetes mettitus. Clinical Chemistry,<br>
1996 42(2): 263-269).<br>
However, currently available tests to measure GAD65 autoantibodies by ELISA have<br>
poorer sensitivity and specificity than the above meotioaed IP As aad do not compare<br>
well with the IP As in proficiency studies (R S SchmidH, P G Cofanan, E Bonifacio,<br>
Participating Laboratories. Disease sensitivity and specificity of 52 assays for<br>
glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies. The second international GADAb workshop.<br>
Diabetes, 1995 44: 636-640).<br>
The present invention, however, alleviates me problems hitherto associted with<br>
methods aad kits employed in the screening of autoaatibodies indicative of the onset<br><br>
or presence of type 1 diabetes and have general applicability in the detection of<br>
autoantibodies reactive with pancreatic islet cell antigenic molecules and / or insulin.<br>
In particular, the present invention employs methods and kits having unproved<br>
specificity and sensitivity when compared to prior art techniques as discussed above.<br>

It may be preferred in a method according to the present invention that the antigenic<br>
molecules of the first and second sources when present in said one or more complexes<br>
substantially as hereinbefore described both comprise one or more common antigenic<br>
molecules. For example, antigenic molecules of said first and second sources when<br>
present in the one or more complexes can comprise GAD65 or GAD67; alternatively<br>
the antigenic molecules of the first and second sources when present in the one or<br>
more complexes can comprise IA-2.<br>
Alternatively, it may be preferred that one antigenic molecule, of either the first or<br>
second source, when present in the one or more complexes comprises an antigenic<br>
molecule selected from pancreatic islet cell antigenic molecules and insulin, and the<br>
other antigenic molecule when present in the one or more complexes comprises one<br>
or more variants, analogues, derivatives or fragments of the above mentioned one<br>
antigenic molecule with which analyte autoantibodies when present in said sample of<br>
body fluid can interact For example, where one of the antigenic molecules of the<br>
first or second source when present in the one or more complexes comprises GAD65<br><br>
or GAD67, the other antigenic molecule when present in the one or more complexes<br>
can comprise one or more variants, analogues, derivatives or fragments of GAD65 or<br>
GAD67 with which analyte autoantibodies when present in said sample of body fluid<br>

complexes comprise a variant, analogue, derivative or fragment, which may be the<br>
same or different, of a common antigenic molecule, with which analyte<br>
autoantibodies when present in said sample of body fluid can interact. For example,<br>

more complexes can comprise a variant, analogue, derivative or fragment, which may<br>
be the same or different, of GAD65 or GAD67, with which analyte autoantibodies<br>

one or more complexes comprise a variant, analogue, derivative or fragment, which<br>
may be the same or different, of IA-2, with which analyte autoantibodies when<br>
present in said sample of body fluid can interact. It will be appreciated from the<br>
above that where both antigenic molecules when present in the complexes formed<br>
according to a method of the present invention comprise variants, analogues,<br>
derivatives or fragments derived from a common antigenic molecule, such variants,<br>
analogues, derivative or fragments may be the same or different (for example variant<br>
1 and variant 2, where variants 1 and 2 may respectively represent different variants<br>
of GAD65 or GAD67, or fragment 1 and fragment 2, where fragments 1 and 2 may<br>
respectively represent different fragments of GAD65 or GAD67, such as distinct, or<br>
possibly overlapping, epitopes of GAD65 or GAD67).<br>
In the case where fusion molecules are employed in a method according to the present<br>
invention, it will be appreciated that such fusion molecules can comprise -distinct<br>
antigenic molecules (for example GAD65 and IA-2) but that in a complex formed<br><br>
according to the present invention the binding regions of antigenic fusion molecules<br>
for an analyte autoantibody as respectively provided by the first and second sources<br>
will be present in, or will be derived from, a common antigenic molecule. Examples<br>
of complexes that may be formed employing one or more fusion molecules according<br>
to the present invention can include (i) [GAD-IA-2imm]-[analyte autoantibody]-[GAD-<br>
IA-2label] where in the case where the autoantibody comprises a GAD autoantibody<br>
this autoantibody interacts with binding regions of GAD present in [GAD-IA-2imn]<br>
and [GAD-IA-2label], or where the autoantibody comprises a IA-2 autoantibody this<br>
autoantibody interacts with binding regions of IA-2 present in [GAD-IA2imm] and<br>
[GAD-IA-2label], or (ii) [GAD(fragment)imm]-[analyte autoantibody]-[GAD-IA-2label]<br>
where a GAD analyte autoantibody interacts with binding regions of GAD present in<br>
[GAD(fragment)imm] and [GAD-IA-2iabd], or (iii) [IA-2(fogment)imm]-[analyte<br>
autoantibody]-[GAD-IA-2label] where a IA-2 analyte autoantibody interacts with<br>
binding regions of IA-2 present in [IA-2(fragment)imm] and [GAD-IA-2label], where<br>
GAD can represent GAD65 or GAD67.<br>

peroxidase conjugate or the like), whereby the resulting conjugates can be detected<br>
suitably by measurement of optical density or the like.<br>
The detectable labelling means may be directly provided to the one or more antigenic<br>

one or more fusion molecules thereof, with which analyte autoantibodies when<br>
present in said sample of body fluid can interact, can be contacted with the sample of<br>
body fluid being screened either simultaneously or successively with contact of the<br>
sample of body fluid with antigenic molecules of one or more second sources, or<br>
more one or more variants, analogues, derivatives or fragments thereof, or one or<br>
more fusion molecules thereof, with which analyte autoantibodies when present in<br>
said sample of body fluid can interact. Particularly preferably, contacting means are<br>
provided whereby immobilised antigenic molecules of the one or more first sources,<br>
or one or more variants, analogues, derivatives or fragments thereof, or one or more<br>
fusion molecules thereof, with which analyte autoantibodies when present in said<br>
sample of body fluid can interact, are contacted with the sample of body fluid being<br>
screened so as to form an intermediate complex comprising [antigenic molecule] -<br>
[analyte autoantibody] where the antigenic molecule is immobilised to a solid support<br>
and the thus formed immobilised intermediate complex is subsequently contacted<br>
with molecules of the one or more second sources, or one or more variants, analogues,<br>
derivatives or fragments thereof, or one or more fusion molecules thereof, with which<br>
analyte autoantibodies when present in said sample of body fluid can interact, present<br>
in solution phase, so as to form the hitherto described complex comprising [antigenic<br>
molecule of said first source]-[analyte autoantibody]-[antigenic molecule of said<br>
second source] immobilised to a solid support via the antigenic molecule of said first<br>
source.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a kit for screening a sample of body fluid<br>
obtained from an animal subject for analyte autoantibodies reactive with one or more<br>

insulin, or one or more variants, analogues, derivatives or fragments thereof, said kit<br>
comprising:<br>

autoantibodies when present in said sample of body fluid can interact and<br>
which antigenic molecules are selected from pancreatic islet cell antigenic<br>
molecules, insulin, one or more variants, analogues, derivatives or fragments<br>
of said pancreatic islet cell antigenic molecules or insulin, and fusion<br>
molecules comprising two or more directly or indirectly fused antigenic<br>
molecules selected from pancreatic islet cell antigenic molecules, insulin and<br>
said one or more variants, analogues, derivatives or fragments thereof,<br>
wherein said antigenic molecules of said one or more first sources are<br>
immobilised to a solid support;<br>
(b)	one or more second sources of antigenic molecules with which analyte<br>

solution phase and are provided with labelling means as defined in (d);<br>
(c)	means for contacting said antigenic molecules as provided by (a) and (b)<br>
simultaneously or successively with said sample of body fluid being screened,<br>
whereby analyte autoantibodies when present in said sample of body fluid can<br>
interact with said antigenic molecules so as to form one or more immobilised<br>
complexes comprising [antigenic molecule of said first source]-[analyte<br>
autoantibody]-[antigenic molecule of said second source], wherein said<br><br>
antigenic molecules of said first and second sources when present in said one<br>

provide an indication of analyte autoantibodies present in said sample.<br>
Other contacting means may, however, be present in a kit according to the present<br>
invention, for example it is possible according to the present invention not to provide<br>
means for initially immobilising the antigenic molecules, or one or more variants,<br>
analogues, derivatives or fragments thereof, or one or more fusion molecules thereof,<br>
of the one or more first antigen sources, prior to a contacting step as described above,<br>
but to provide means to initially contact the solid support substantially as hereinbefore<br>
described with a binder for the antigenic molecules, or one or more variants,<br>
analogues, derivatives or fragments thereof, or one or more fusion molecules thereof,<br>
of the one or more first antigen sources and for the kit to comprise means for<br>
subsequently contacting the so treated solid support with the above described<br>
antigenic molecules or the one or more first and second sources, or one or more<br>
variants, analogues, derivatives or fragments thereof, or one or more fusion molecules<br>
thereof, and the sample of body fluid being screened.<br>
In respect of the solid supports and conditions employed in a kit according to the<br>
present invention, the supports and conditions do not generally fundamentally differ<br>
from conventional supports and conditions employed in known immunoassay<br><br>
techniques. A solid support for use in a kit according to the present invention can<br>
comprise an ELISA plate as currently employed in known ELISA techniques, or may<br>
employ any other suitable support for use in the present invention, such as tubes,<br>
particles, magnetic beads, nitrocellulose or the like.<br>
Detection of analyte autoantibodies reactive with one or more antigenic molecules<br>
selected from pancreatic islet cell antigenic molecules and insulin according to a<br>
method provided by the present invention, or employing a kit provided by the present<br>
invention, can be useful in the diagnosis of a number of disease states with which the<br>
presence of such analyte autoantibodies is associated. In particular, the present<br>
invention can be employed in screening a sample of body fluid from an animal subject<br>
suspected of suffering from, susceptible to or having any of the following disease<br>
states - type 1 diabetes mellitus and / or stiff man syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus,<br>
one or more autoimmune thyroid diseases, celiac disease, one or more connective<br>
tissue diseases, adrenal autoimmunity, or a combination of two or more different<br>
autoimmune diseases and the present invention further provides a method of<br>
diagnosing any of the above disease states in an animal subject.<br>
It will be appreciated from the foregoing description that the present invention<br>
provides assay methods and kits for detecting, in a sample of body fluid obtained<br>
from an animal subject, analyte autoantibodies reactive with one or more antigenic<br>
molecules selected from pancreatic islet cell antigenic molecules and insulin and<br>
indicative of the onset or presence of the above disease states. The detection of such<br>
autoantibodies in the sample of body fluid (or at least the level of such autoantibodies<br>
in the sample) is indicative of the likely onset or presence of such disease states in the<br>
subject from which the sample is obtained and can, therefore, enable the diagnosis of<br>
the likely onset or presence of such disease states.<br>
There is, therefore, further provided by the present invention a method of diagnosing<br>
the likely onset or presence of disease states, associated with the presence of<br>
autoantibodies reactive with one or more antigenic molecules selected from pancreatic<br>
islet cell antigenic molecules and insulin, in an animal subject (in particular a human<br>
subject); suspected of having or being susceptible to these disease states, the method .<br>
comprising detecting autoantibodies reactive with one or more antigenic molecules<br><br>
selected from pancreatic islet cell antigenic molecules and insulin, and-being<br>
indicative of the likely onset or presence of these disease states in a sample of body<br>
fluid from the subject substantially as hereinbefore described, and whereby the<br>
detected autoantibodies can provide a diagnosis of the likely onset or presence of<br>
these disease states.<br>
There is, therefore, still further provided by the present invention a method of<br>
delaying or preventing the onset of disease states, associated with the presence of<br>
autoantibodies reactive with one or more antigenic molecules selected from pancreatic<br>
islet cell antigenic molecules and insulin, in an animal subject (in particular a human<br>
subject), or treating an animal subject (in particular a human subject) having or<br>
recovering from such disease states, which method comprises initially detecting<br>
autoantibodies reactive with one or more antigenic molecules selected from pancreatic<br>
islet cell antigenic molecules and insulin, and being indicative of the onset or presence<br>
of such disease states, in a sample of body fluid obtained from the subject<br>
substantially as hereinbefore described, thereby providing a diagnosis of the likely<br>
onset or presence of such disease states in the subject, and administering to the subject<br>
a therapeutically effective amount of at least one therapeutic agent effective in<br>
delaying onset, obviating, preventing and/or treating these disease states.<br>
There is, therefore, still further provided by the present invention a method of<br>
assessing the effectiveness of delaying or preventing the onset of disease states,<br>
associated with the presence of autoantibodies reactive with one or more antigenic<br>
molecules selected from pancreatic islet cell antigenic molecules and insulin, in an<br>
animal subject (in particular a human subject), or assessing the effectiveness of<br>
treating an animal subject (in particular a human subject) having or recovering from<br>
such disease states, which method comprises administering to the subject a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of at least one therapeutic agent effective in delaying<br>
onset, obviating, preventing and/or treating such disease states associated with the<br>
presence of autoantibodies reactive with one or more antigenic molecules selected<br>
from pancreatic islet cell antigenic molecules and insulin, and detecting<br>
autoantibodies indicative of the onset or presence of such disease states in a sample of<br>
body fluid obtained from the subject, so as to provide an indication of the presence of<br>
said autoantibodies in said sample, thereby providing an indication of the<br><br>
effectiveness of treating the subject, or of delaying or preventing the onset of such<br>
disease states in the subject.<br>
There is still further provided by the present invention, in combination, a kit<br>
substantially as hereinbefore described, together with a therapeutically effective<br>
amount of at least one therapeutic agent effective in the treatment of disease states<br>
associated with the presence of autoantibodies reactive with one or more antigenic<br>
molecules selected from pancreatic islet cell antigenic molecules and insulin.<br>
A sample of body fluid being screened by the present invention will typically<br>
comprise blood samples or other fluid blood fractions, such as in particular serum<br>
samples or plasma samples, but the sample may in principle be another biological<br>
fluid, such as saliva or urine or solubilised tissue extracts.<br>
The term "antigen" or "antigenic molecules" as used herein denotes a compound with<br>
which antibodies as described herein can interact and which is capable of binding to<br>
an antibody to form specific antibody-antigen complexes. The antigen or antigenic<br>
molecules may be natural or synthetic and modifications thereto are preferably such<br>
as to not detrimentally affect the binding properties thereof to a specific antibody.<br>
As indicated above, the present invention covers the use of "variants", "analogs",<br>
"derivatives" and "fragments" of antigenic molecules as described herein and the<br>
terms "variants", "analogs", "derivatives" and "fragments" as used herein can be<br>
characterised as polypeptides which retain essentially the same biological function or<br>
activity as naturally occurring antigenic molecules and in particular in respect of the<br>
binding properties thereof for a specific antibody. Suitably, variants, analogs,<br>
derivatives and fragments, and variants, analogs and derivatives of the fragments as<br>
described herein, have a primary structural conformation of amino acids in which<br>
several or a few (such as 5 to 10, I to 5 or 1 to 3) amino acid residues of the naturally<br>
occurring antigenic molecules are substituted, deleted or added, in any combination.<br>
Especially preferred among these are silent substitutions, additions are deletions<br>
which do not alter or substantially alter the biological activity or function of the<br>
naturally occurring antigenic molecules. Conservative substitutions can be preferred<br>
as hereinafter described in greater detail.<br><br>
More particularly, variants, analogs or derivatives of antigenic molecules suitable for<br>
use according to the present invention may be ones in which one or more of the amino<br>
acid residues are substituted with a conserved or non-conserved amino acid residue<br>
(preferably a conserved amino acid residue), or ones in which one or more of the<br>
amino acid resides includes a substituent group or the like. Such variants, derivatives<br>
and analogs are deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art from the<br>
teachings herein.<br>
Most typically, variants, analogs or derivatives are those that vary from a reference<br>
(such as naturally occurring antigenic molecules as referred to herein) by conservative<br>
amino acid substitutions. Such substitutions are those that substitute a given amino<br>
acid in a polypeptide by another amino acid of like characteristics. Typically seen as<br>
conservative substitutions are the replacements, one for another, among the aliphatic<br>
amino acids A, V, L and I; among the hydroxyl residues S and T; among the acidic<br>
residues D and E; among the amide residues N and Q; among the basic residues K and<br>
R; and among the aromatic residues F and Y.<br>
More particularly, the term "fragment" as used herein denotes a polypeptide having<br>
an amino acid sequence that entirely is the same as part but not all of the amino acid<br>
sequence of naturally occurring amino acids as referred to herein, and variants or<br>
derivatives thereof and such fragments may be "free standing", i.e. not part of or<br>
fused to other amino acids or polypeptides, or they may be comprised within a larger<br>
polypeptide of which they form a part or region. In the context of the present<br>
invention, it will be appreciated that particularly preferred fragments for use<br>
according to the present invention may be one or more epitopes of antigenic<br>
molecules as referred to herein and as described above such epitope fragments may be<br>
used in "free standing" form or may be used within a larger polypeptide, such as a<br>
scaffold polypeptide, of which they form a part or region. The use of such epitope<br>
fragments in substantially isolated or free standing form according to the present<br>
invention can be advantageous in terms of enhanced stability of such substantially<br>
isolated or free standing epitope fragments when compared with the use of a full<br>
length antigen and / or enhanced specificity associated, with the use of such<br><br>
substantially isolated or free standing epitope fragments compared with the use of a<br>
full length antigen.<br>
The present invention will now be further illustrated by the following example, which<br>
does not limit the scope of the invention in any way.<br>
Example:<br>
Preparation of GAD65 coated ELISA plates<br>
Human recombinant GAD65 of &gt;95% purity as assessed by SDS-PAGE (M Powell, L<br>
Prentice, T Asawa, R Kato, J Sawicka, H Tanaka, V Petersen, A Munkley, S Morgan,<br>
B Rees Smith, J Furmaniak. Clinica Chimica Acta, 1996 256: 175-188) was diluted<br>
to 150ug/L in a coating buffer comprising 1.59g/L Na2CO3, 2.94g/L NaHCO3, 0.1g/L<br>
NaN3, 0.01g/L Phenol Red, and 5mg/L BSA (pH 9.2) and 150uL of the resulting<br>
solution was added to 96-well ELISA plates (available under the trade mark Nunc F8<br>
MaxiSorp). The plates were then incubated overnight at 4°C, the contents of the wells<br>
aspirated and the wells washed three times with a high salt buffer (HSB) comprising<br>
10g/L BSA, lg/L NaN3, 11.69g/L NaCl, 18.17g/L Tris, and 10mL/L<br>
Polyoxyethylene-Sorbitan Monolaurate (available under the trade mark Tween 20 (pH<br>
8.3). A post-coat buffer comprising 3g/L BSA, 9g/L NaCl, 20g/L sucrose and 0.2g/L<br>
NaN3 was added to the wells (250uL per well) and incubated for 30 minutes at room<br>
temperature. The post-coat buffer was then aspirated, the plates dried under vacuum<br>
and stored in sealed bags with silica gel at 4°C until use.<br>
Labelling of GAD65 with bio tin<br>
Human recombinant GAD65 in PBS (1.15g/L Na2HPO4, 0.2g/L KH2PO4, 0.2g/L KCl,<br>
8g/L NaCl) was reacted with a commercial biotinylation reagent (Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-<br>
Biotin available under the trade mark EZ-Link from Perbio Science), at a molar ratio<br>
of 1 part GAD65 to 24 parts biotinylation reagent for 30 minutes at room temperature.<br>
The reaction was stopped by dialysis against PBS at 4°C and the resulting material<br>
was stored at -70°C in small aliquots.<br>
The resulting GAD65 labelled with bio tin according to the above techniques (GAD65-<br>
Bi) was diluted to 3mg/L in 20g/L BSA, filtered through a 0.22m filter, aliquotted at<br><br>
1mL per vial, freeze dried and then stored at -20°C. To use, 7.5mL of HSB was<br>
added to the vial, giving a final concentration of GAD65-Bi of 400g/L.<br>
Preparation of calibrators for GAD65 autoannbody assay<br>

to give an absorbance at OD450nm from 4.0 to 0.1. These monoclonal antibodies are<br>
known to be representative of GAD65 autoantibodies found in sera from patients with<br>
type 1 diabetes (M J Powell, N Hayakawa, M Masuda, J Sanders, M Evans, LDKE<br>

GAD65 Autoantibodv Detection<br>
Plates coated with GAD65 prepared according to the above techniques were brought to<br>
room temperature and 25L of undiluted serum sample obtained from test donors, or<br>
calibrators prepared according to the above techniques, were added to the plate wells<br>
in duplicate and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with shaking at 200rpm.<br>
The samples were then aspirated, the wells washed three times with buffer (8.7g/L<br>
NaCl, 2.4g/L Tris, 0.5mL/L Tween 20, pH 7.6), followed by addition of lOOuL of<br>
GAD65-Bi diluted in HSB (400g/L) prepared according to the above techniques and<br>
incubation for 1 hour at room temperature, with shaking at 200rpm. After the<br>
incubation the contents of the wells were aspirated and wells washed three times with<br>
buffer (8.7g/L NaCl, 2.4g/L Tris, 0.5mL/L Tween 20, pH 7.6). Thereafter, lOOuL of<br>
a streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate diluted to 1g/mL was added and<br>
incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature, with shaking at 200rpm. After<br>
aspiration, the wells were washed three times with buffer (8.7g/L NaCl, 2.4g/L Tris,<br>
0.5mL/L Tween 20, pH 7.6) and once with water.. lOOuL of tetramethyl benzidine<br>
was then added and incubated for 20 minutes in the dark, followed by addition of<br><br>
50uL of 0.5 mol/L H2SO4. The absorbance of the wells was then measured in an<br>
ELISA plate reader at 450nm or in the case of samples giving an OD 450nm&gt;4.0,<br>
absorbance was also measured at 405nm.<br>
The above procedures were applied to IA-2 autoantibodies and also to the combined<br>
detection of GAD65 and IA-2 autoantibodies (in particular, involving the preparation<br>
of IA-2 labelled with biotin, IA-2-Bi). Reference preparations of IA-2 autoantibodies<br>
for generation of a calibration curve were prepared from polyclonal IA-2<br>
autoantibodies.<br>
Results<br>
A typical calibration curve for GAD65 obtained at OD 450nm is shown in Figure la.<br>
Seven calibrators of arbitrarily assigned GAD65 autoantibody ELISA units from 0<br>
ELISA units/mL to 512 ELISA units/mL were included. OD 450nm values for the<br>
calibrators were 0.033, 0.168, 0.310, 1.020, 3.187, &gt;4.0 and &gt;4.0 for calibrators 0,<br>
1.0, 2.0, 8.0, 32, 128 and 512 respectively. OD 405nm values were 0.008, 0.048,<br>
0.090, 0.290, 0.929, 1.385 and 1.620 for calibrators 0, 1.0, 2.0, 8.0, 32, 128 and 512<br>
respectively as shown in Figure 1b. Consequently, samples that gave OD 450nm<br>
values &gt;4.0 could be measured within the calibration curve range at OD 405nm as<br>
shown in Figure lb. The mean ±SD absorbance at 450nm for n=25 sera from healthy<br>
blood donors was 0.04 ± 0.015.<br>
Results of GAD65 autoantibody measurement according to the present invention are<br>
shown in Tables 1 and 2. Results of GAD65 autoantibodies in sera from n=18 patients<br>
with type 1 diabetes mellitus and n=14 patients with Graves' disease are shown in<br>
Table 1. All 18 diabetic sera were positive for GAD65 autoantibodies when ELISA<br>
based techniques according to the present invention were employed (levels &gt;1.0<br>
ELISA units/mL), however only 13 of these patients were positive in<br>
radioimmunoassay (RIA). The 5 samples which were negative in RIA showed low<br>
levels of GAD65 autoantibodies in ELISA based techniques according to the present<br>
invention with OD 450nm between 0.117 to 0.980 (1.3 to 10.7 ELISA units/mL). In<br>
the case of samples with low levels in RIA (1.0 to 7.5 RIA units/mL), the OD 450nm<br>
values in ELISA based techniques according to the present invention were between<br>
0.290 and 1.060 (12.0 to 105.8 ELISA units/mL). In the case of samples with higher<br><br>
levels of GAD65 autoantibodies in RIA (26.8 to 118.8 RIA units/mL), OD 450nm in<br>
ELISA based techniques according to the present invention were very high&gt;4.0(&gt;128<br>
ELISA units/mL) and, therefore, the relationship between the GAD65 autoantibody<br>
levels in the sample and the calibration curve was calculated after measurement at<br>
405nm. Preincubation of test sera with non-labelled GAD65 (at final concentration<br>
from 0.0005 to 0.01g/mL) prior to performing the ELISA resulted in a dose<br>
dependent reduction of OD 450nm values. These experiments confirmed the<br>
specificity of the GAD65 autoantibody ELISA based techniques according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
In the case of n=14 sera from patients with Graves' disease, OD 450nm values for all<br>
samples were below 0.05 (
to the present invention); all these samples were negative for GAD65 autoantibodies in<br>
RIA (
Comparison of the lowest detection limit for GAD65 autoantibodies in ELISA based<br>
techniques according to the present invention and RIA is shown in Table 2. In the<br>
RIA dilutions of WHO reference preparation for islet cell autoantibodies [NIBSC<br>
97/550] from 250 to 31.25 WHO units/mL, detectable levels of GAD65 autoantibodies<br>
were seen. However, in the ELISA based techniques according to the present<br>
invention, GAD65 autoantibodies were detectable in the case of WHO standard<br>
dilutions from 250 to 3.91 WHO units/mL. Further, an example of the dilution profile<br>
of a serum sample Z (from a patient with high levels of GAD65 autoantibodies) is<br>
shown in Table 2. In the case of RIA, GAD65 autoantibodies were detectable in the<br>
sample Z in the range from 1/8 to 1/8192 dilution. In the case of ELISA based<br>
techniques according to the present invention, GAD65 autoantibodies were detectable<br>
in the range from 1/8 to 1/32768 dilution. Consequently, the end point dilution<br>
analyses of WHO standard and patient's serum indicated that a 4-fold to 8-fold<br>
greater dilutions were detectable in ELISA based techniques according to the present<br>
invention compared to RIA.<br>
An example of results of IA-2 autoantibody measurement by ELISA based techniques<br>
according to the present invention is shown in Table 3. Typical OD 450nm values for<br>
the set of IA-2 autoantibody calibrators (0, 1:0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 16, 32, 64, 128 ELISA<br><br>
units/mL) were from 0.054 to &gt;4.0 and OD405 values were from 0.008 to 1.874. Sera<br>
from n=10 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus who had IA-2 autoantibody levels in<br>
RIA from 2.0 to 38.9 RIA units/mL were all positive in ELISA based techniques<br>
according to the present invention. These samples gave OD 450nm values between<br>
0.209 to &gt;4.0 (2.6 to &gt;32 ELISA units/mL). WHO standard was detectable in IA-2<br>
autoantibody RIA at 250 WHO units/mL and 125 WHO units/mL however, further<br>
dilutions (62.5 WHO units/mL and 31.25 WHO units/mL) were detectable in ELISA<br>
based techniques according to the present invention. OD 450nm values in the case of<br>
n=10 sera from healthy blood donors (all negative for IA-2 autoantibodies in RIA)<br>
were between 0.030 and 0.071 (
Results of a combination assay for GAD65 autoantibodies and IA-2 autoantibodies are<br>
shown in Tables 4 and 5. Table 4 shows results of combined measurement of GAD65<br>
autoantibodies and IA-2 autoantibodies in ELISA based techniques according to the<br>
present invention, when IA-2-Bi or GAD65-Bi or IA-2-Bi plus GAD65-Bi were used in<br>
the assay. In the case of IA-2 autoantibody calibrators, no signal in the ELISA based<br>
techniques according to the present invention was detected when GAE&gt;65-Bi was used,<br>
whereas dose dependent increase of OD 450nm was observed when IA-2-Bi or IA-2-<br>
Bi plus GAL&gt;65-Bi were used. The OD 450nm signal with IA-2-Bi alone was<br>
essentially the same as signal with IA-2-Bi plus GAD65-Bi. In the case of GAD65<br>
autoantibody calibrators, no signal was detected when IA-2-Bi was used in the assay<br>
while dose dependent response of OD 450nm was observed with GAD65-Bi and IA-2-<br>
Bi plus GAD65-BL The OD 450nm signals in the case of GAD65-Bi alone and IA-2-<br>
Bi plus GAD65-Bi plus GAD65-Bi were comparable. Measurement of both<br>
autoantibodies in different dilutions of serum sample Z showed a good agreement<br>
with the results of IA-2 autoantibodies or GAD65 autoantibodies alone. Serum from<br>
an individual healthy blood donor or healthy blood donor pool serum gave very low<br>
OD 450nm values from 0.006 to 0.046 irrespective of which biotinylated antigen was<br>
used. This experiment shows that in the combined assay to measure IA-2<br>
autoantibodies and GAD65 autoantibodies, the results are specific and reflect the<br>
presence of the two autoantibodies in the test sample.<br>
More detailed results of the combined measurement of IA-2 autoantibodies and<br>
GAD65 autoantibodies are shown in Table 5. Sera from patients with Type 1 diabetes<br><br>
were tested in the assay. IA-2 autoantibodies and GAD65 autoantibodies wore<br>
assessed in these sera by RIA; sera 1-3 were positive for both IA-2 autoantibodies and<br>
GAD65 autoantibodies, sera 4-6 were negative for GAD65 autoantibodies but positive<br>
for IA-2 autoantibodies, sera 7-9 were positive for GAD65 autoantibodies but negative<br>
for IA-2 autoantibodies and sera 10-12 were negative for both IA-2 or GAD65<br>
autoantibodies. As shown in Table 5, in the combined assay one or the other or bom<br>
autoantibodies were detected in serum samples. Furthermore, in the case of serum 6<br>
that had borderline levels of IA-2 autoantibodies by RIA (0.9 RIA units/mL), the<br>
signal in the combined ELISA based techniques according to the present invention<br>
was clearly positive.<br>
Additional examples of results with ELISA for GAD65 autoantibodies, IA-2<br>
autoantibodies and combined G AD65 and IA-2 autoantibodies according to the present<br>
invention for different patient subgroups are shown in Tables 6, 7 and 8 respectively.<br>
Conclusions<br>
The above results show that the non-radioactive based techniques according to the<br>
present invention allow measurement of GAD65 autoantibodies in test samples. The<br>
non-radioactive based techniques according to the present invention can also be<br>
employed to measure IA-2 autoantibodies separately or simultaneously. The<br>
measurements are specific and they are in agreement with the results of GAD65<br>
autoantibodies and IA-2 autoantibodies measurements by established radioactive<br>
reference methods (M Powell, L Prentice, T Asawa, R Kato, J Sawicka, H Tanaka, V<br>
Petersen, A Munkley, S Morgan, B Rees Smith, J Furmaniak. Clinica Chimica Acta,<br>
1996 256: 175-188; and M Masuda, M Powell, S Chen, C Beer, P Fichna, B Rees<br>
Smith, J Furmaniak. Autoantibodies to IA-2 in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.<br>
Measurements with a new immunoprecipitation assay. Clinica Chimica Acta, 2000<br>
291: 53-66). Furthermore, measurements of GAD65 autoantibodies and IA-2<br>
autoantibodies by non-radioactive based techniques according to the present invention<br>
are at least as sensitive compared to results by RIA (Tables 1, 2 and 3).<br>
The techniques according to the present invention provide a non-radioactive assay to<br>
measure GAD65 autoantibodies or IA-2 autoantibodies with a high sensitivity that is<br>
convenient to use for diagnostic and screening purposes. A combination assay for<br><br>
GAD65 and IA-2 autoantibodies according to the present invention can be of particular<br>
benefit for use in large population screening programmes.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

autoimmunity, or a combination of two or more different autoimmune<br>
diseases.+++++<br><br>
1. A method of screening a sample of body fluid obtained from an animal<br>
subject for analyte autoantibodies reactive with one or more pancreatic<br>
islet cell antigenic molecules selected from the group consisting of<br>
GAD65, GAD67 and protein tyrosine phosphatase-like islet cell antigen<br>
(IA-2), or one or more variants, analogues, derivatives or fragments<br>
thereof, said method comprising:<br>
(a)	providing one or more first sources of antigenic molecules with<br>
which analyte autoantibodies when present in said sample of body<br>
fluid can interact and which antigenic molecules are selected from<br>
said group of pancreatic islet cell antigenic molecules, one or more<br>
variants, analogues, derivatives or fragments of said pancreatic islet<br>
cell antigenic molecules and fusion molecules comprising two or<br>
more directly or indirectly fused antigenic molecules selected from<br>
pancreatic islet cell antigenic molecules, and said one or more<br>
variants, analogues, derivatives or fragments thereof;<br>
(b)	providing one or more second sources of antigenic molecules with<br>
which analyte autoantibodies when present in said sample of body<br>
fluid can interact and which antigenic molecules are selected from<br>
said group of pancreatic islet cell antigenic molecules, one or more<br>
variants, analogues, derivatives or fragments of said group of<br>
pancreatic islet cell antigenic molecules, and fusion molecules<br>
comprising two or more directly or indirectly fused antigenic<br>
molecules selected from pancreatic islet cell antigenic molecules,<br>
and said one or more variants, analogues, derivatives or fragments<br>
thereof;<br><br>
(c)	contacting said antigenic molecules as provided by steps (a) and (b)<br>
simultaneously or successively with said sample of body fluid<br>
being screened, whereby analyte autoantibodies when present in<br>
said sample of body fluid can interact with said antigenic molecules<br>
so as to form one or more complexes comprising [antigenic<br>
molecule of said first source]-[analyte autoantibody]-[antigenic<br>
molecule of said second source], wherein said molecules of said<br>
first and second sources when present in said one or more<br>
complexes comprise, or are derived from, a common antigenic<br>
molecule, or wherein binding regions of said antigenic molecules of<br>
said first and second sources, for said analyte autoantibody, when<br>
present in said one or more complexes are present in, or are<br>
derived from, a common antigenic molecule;<br>
(d)	prior to, or concurrent with, or subsequent to, step ( c ), providing<br>
