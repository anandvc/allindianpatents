				<td>[Detailed Description of the Invention]<br>
[Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to n/stomprea n ibrr ; spring formed of an elastic body made from a resin or rubber. [-0002]'.<br>
[ Related Art]<br>
As for the compression spring of this type, there is known a type in which an elastic body of the compression spring is formed into a cylindrical shape, wherein a compression energy generated when the compression spring is pressed in the radial direction is absorbed by elastic deformation of the elastic body in the direction where the elastic body is flattened.<br>
For example, a compression spring shown in Fig. 9<br>
is disclosed in Japanese Patent (PCT international<br>
application) Laid-open No. He! 7-502698 /"&gt;/herein a<br>
cylindrical main body comprises two cylindrical elastic bodies 01 and 02 stacked in the radial direction, a connecting portion 03 formed into neck-shape therebetween, and a flat top plate 04 and a flat bottom plate 05.<br>
The top plate 04, the bottom plate 05 and the connecting portion 03 respectively have circular holes 04a, 05a and 03a through which a bolt coaxially passes.<br>
A compression energy generated when the compression spring is pressed in the radial direction is absorbed by elastic deformation of the cylindrical elastic bodies 01 and 02 in the direction where the elastic bodies 01 and 02 are flattened. [0005]-<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
The above compression spring is used in a state in which a bolt passes through the circular holes 04a, 05a and 03a respectively formed in the top plate 04, bottom plate 05 and connecting portion 03 for stabilizing the shape of the compression spring when the compression spring is deformed.  In other words, if the compressing spring is not supported by the above bolt, the cylindrical main body is possibly bent at the necked connecting portion 03, with a result that the compression spring is difficult to always ensure a specific load-deformation characteristic because of instability of the shape upon deformation.<br>
In this way, the related art compression spring cannot stably absorb a compression energy unless it is supported by a supporting member such as a bolt.<br>
The related art compression spring requiring such a supporting member makes it poor in applicability and<br>
general-versatility.<br>
in view of the  foregoing,   the present invention has been made,   and an object of the present  invention-is  to provide an elastic body made compression spring capable of stabilizing the  shape upon deformation without use of  any supporting member,  thereby always  ensuring a specific  load-deformation characteristic.<br>
To achieve the above object, According to the present invention, there is provided an elastic compression spring comprising a cylindrical spring main body for absorbing compression energy when the compression spring is pressed in a radial direction by elastic deformation of said cylindrical spring main body, characterized in that:<br>
a base is formed on a side receiving a pressing force from said spring main body and has a flat bottom surface swelled along a plane perpendicular to the pressing direction; and<br>
a reinforcing wall for connecting the swelled portion of said base to a side portion of said cylindrical spring main body.<br>
Since the swelled portion of the base is connected to a side portion of the cylindrical spring main body by means of the reinforcing wall so as to reinforce the connecting portion between the spring main body and the base, when the compression spring is pressed in the radial direction, the connecting portion between the spring main body and the base is prevented from being bent in one direction without requiring any supporting member, to prevent the spring main body from being tilted in an unbalanced state, thereby stabilizing the shape of the compression spring upon deformation and always ensuring a specific load-deformation characteristic.<br>
The compression spring, which does not require any supporting member, is excellent in applicability and general-versatility.<br>
According to an invention described in claim 2, there is provided an elastic body made compression spring comprising a cylindrical spring main body, wherein a compression energy generated when the compression spring is pressed in the radial direction is absorbed by elastic deformation of the cylindrical spring main body, characterized in that the spring main body is formed of a plurality of cylindrical elastic bodies stacked in the<br>
radial direction; and one or more of reinforcing walls for connecting adjacent side portions of the plurality of cylindrical elastic bodies to each other are formed integrally with the spring main body. {.0011]<br>
Since the spring main body is formed of the plurality of cylindrical elastic bodies stacked in the radial direction and each connecting portion between adjacent cylindrical elastic bodies is reinforced by connecting the side portions of the adjacent cylindrical elastic bodies by means of the reinforcing wall, when the compression spring is pressed in radial direction, the connecting portion between the adjacent cylindrical elastic bodies is prevented from being bent in one direction without requiring any supporting member, avoiding the spring main body to be tilted in an unbalanced state, thereby stabilizing the shape of the compression spring upon deformation and always ensuring a specific load-deformation characteristic.<br>
The compression spring, which does not require any supporting member, is excellent in applicability and general-versatility .<br>
According to an invention described in claim 3,<br>
there is provided an elastic body made compression spring comprising a cylindrical spring main body, wherein a compression energy generated when the compression spring is pressed in the radial direction is absorbed by elastic deformation of the cylindrical spring main body, characterized in that a base which has a flat bottom surface swelled along a plane perpendicular to the pressing direction is formed on the pressing force receiving side of the spring main body; and the base forms part of the cylindrical spring main body in a state that a flat upper surface thereof partially cuts a circular hollow of the cylindrical portion of the cylindrical spring main body. fQ013]-<br>
Since the base forms part of the cylindrical spring main body in the state that the flat upper surface thereof partially cuts a circular hollow of the cylindrical portion of the cylindrical spring main body, both side portions of the spring main body, serving as leg portions, are connected to the flat plate like base, so that when the compression spring is pressed in the radial direction, the spring main body is prevented from being tilted in an unbalanced state without requiring any supporting member, thereby stabilizing the shape of the compression spring main body upon deformation and always ensuring a specific<br>
load-deformation characteristic.<br>
The compression spring, which does not require any supporting member is excellent in applicability and general-versatility.<br>

[Embodiment of the Invention]<br>
Hereinafter, one embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Figs. 1 to 7.<br>
Fig. 1 is a side view, with components partly omitted, of a scooter type motorcycle 1 in which a damping force generating mechanism in this embodiment is applied to a wheel suspension. [0015]<br>
A low floor 4 is formed between a front body 2 and a rear body 3.  A down frame 6 extends downward from a head pipe 5 mounted to the front body 2, being bent at its lower end, and extends rearward.  The rear portion of the down frame 6 constitutes a main part of the floor 4.<br>
t-0016.]<br>
A steering shaft 7 is turnably fitted in the head pipe 5.  A pair of right and left front forked portions 8 are integrally mounted to the lower end of the steering shaft 7 and extend downward therefrom.  Two link members configured as swinging arms 9 are swingably supported at<br>
the lower ends of the front forked portions 8 by means of a pivot arm bolt 11.<br>
A front wheel 13 is rotatably supported by the free ends of the swinging arms 9 via a front axle 12.<br>
The front forked portion 8 is formed into a U-shape in cross-section with a front wall and right and left side walls.  The lower end portions of both the side walls have bolt holes.  A base end pivot portion 9a, in which a bush 14 is mounted, of the swinging arm 9 is fitted between both the side walls of the forked portion 8 in such a manner that the bush 14 is aligned with the bolt holes formed in the side walls.  The pivot arm bolt 11 is allowed to pass through the bolt holes and the bush 14 mounted in the base end pivot portion 9a.  In this way, the base end pivot portion 9a of the swinging arm 9 is rotatably supported by the pivot arm bolt 11.<br>
The base end pivot portion 9a of the swinging arm 9 is formed into an irregular cylindrical shape with its both sides extended in diameter.  A plate-like lever 10 is integrally formed on the outer peripheral surface of the cylinder portion of the base end pivot portion 9a in such a manner as to extend therefrom in the centrifugal direction. •[•OOlOj<br>
In the case where the swinging arm 9 extends rearward from the base end pivot portion 9a, the lever 10 extends obliquely upward from the swinging arm 9 forming an angle of about 60° therebetween, that is, it extends between the front forked portion 8 and the swinging arm 9. [0010]-<br>
A fan-shaped case 15 is fixedly fitted in the front forked portion 8 in such as manner as to be adjacent to the upper side of the base end pivot portion 9a of the swinging arm 9 pivotably supported at the lower end of the front forked portion 8. {0020h<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the case 15 is formed into a box-like shape with a fan-shaped side wall 15a, an outer peripheral wall 15b, and a front wall 15c and a rear wall 15d extending along the radial direction.  A slot 15e is formed in the side wall 15a along the front edge portion of the side wall 15a.  Three circular holes 15f are respectively formed in upper and lower ends of the front wall 15c and the upper end of the rear wall 15d in such a manner that each circular hole passes through the associated wall from right to left, that is, in the width direction.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, an opening of the case 15, opposite to the side wall 15a, is closed with a plate-like lid member 16.  The lid member 16 is formed into the same fan-shape as that of the side wall 15a, and has a slot 16e corresponding to the slot 15e and three circular-holes 16f corresponding to the three circular-holes 15f. [-0022]<br>
A locking piece 17 is engaged with the slots 15e and 16e opposed to each other.<br>
When the lid member 16 is assembled with the case 15, only the lower side of the case 15 is opened. [0023]<br>
An elastic body made compression spring 20 is contained in the case 15 covered with the lid member 16.<br>
An elastic body of the compression spring 20, which is made from a polyester elastomer material, is formed into a shape shown in Figs. 4 and 5.<br>
(0021t<br>
Two cylindrical elastic bodies 22 and 23 are<br>
stacked in the radial direction to form a spring main body 21.  A base 24 which has a flat bottom surface swelled along a plane perpendicular to the pressing direction is formed on the pressing force receiving side of the cylindrical elastic body 22.<br>
The base 24 is provided with a slot 24a passing through the base in the width direction.  The slot 24a corresponds to the slot 15e of the case 15.<br>
A cylindrical projection 25 is formed on the pressing portion of the cylindrical elastic body 23 in such a manner as to project therefrom at a certain angle.<br>
The cylindrical projection 25 is provided with a slot 25a which passes through the cylindrical projection 25 in the direction perpendicular to the width direction. [0020]<br>
The swelled portion of the base 24 is integrally connected to a side portion of the cylindrical elastic body 22 via a reinforcing wall 26, and the side portion of the cylindrical elastic body 22 is integrally formed for connecting to a side portion of the cylindrical elastic body 23 via a reinforcing wall 27. .{0027}-<br>
The compression spring 20 having the above configuration is assembled in the case 15 and the like in the following procedure.  First, the lever 10 integrated with the swinging arm 9 is allowed to pass through the slot 25a of the cylindrical projection 25 of the compression spring 20.  The compression spring 20 is thus mounted to<br>
the lever 10. [0028 ]<br>
At this time, the compression spring 20 is mounted to the lever 10 in such a manner that the reinforcing walls 26 and 27 are directed on the base end pivot portion 9a side.<br>
The cylindrical projection 25 of the compression spring 20 is fixed to the lever 10 by fastening a screw 31 to the end surface of the lever 10 via a washer 30 (see Figs. 6 and 7). [002 9 ]<br>
The compression spring 20 is covered with the case 15 in such a manner as to be fitted in the case 15, and the case 15 is then covered with the lid member 16.<br>
In this mounting state, the lever 10 is inserted in the case 15 through the lower side opening of the case 15. [0030]-<br>
The locking piece 17 is fittingly inserted in the slots 15e of the case 15, the slot 20e of the compression spring 20, and the slot 16e of the lid member 16.  A screw 35 is screwed in the circular-hole 15f at the upper end of the rear wall 15d of the case 15 and the corresponding circular-hole 16f of the lid member 16, to fix the lid member 16 to the case 15.<br>
[003 1 ]<br>
The case 15, covered with the lid member 16, which is mounted to the lever 10 via the compression spring 20 is inserted in the recess portion on the rear side of the front forked portion 8 in such a manner that the front wall 15c of the case 15 is brought in contact with the bottom surface of the recess.<br>
[0032]<br>
Each of the right and left side walls of the front forked portion 8 has two circular-holes at specific upper and lower positions along the front edge portion.  The circular-holes 15f of the case 15 and the circular-holes 16f of the lid member 16 are aligned with the above circular-holes of the right and left side walls of the front forked portion 8.  Bolts 36 are allowed to pass through these circular-holes and then tightly screw with nuts.<br>
In this way, the case 15 and lid member 16 are co-fastened to the front forked portion 8 by bolts 36.<br>
After assembly, the compression spring 20 is contained in the case 15 with the reinforcing walls 26 and 27 directed on the base end pivot portion 9a side as shown in Fig. 6.<br>
The front end portion of the compression spring 20 is positioned by locking with the locking piece 17 through the holes, and the rear portion of the compression spring 20 is also positioned in such a state that the lever 10 is inserted in the slot 25a of the cylindrical projection 25. Further, the rear portion 25b of the cylindrical projection 25 is in contact with the rear wall 15d of the case 15. [0034]<br>
In this way, the compression spring 20 is simply interposed between the front forked portion 8 and the lever 10 in the state that the front portion is locked with the locking piece 17 and the rear portion is locked with the lever 10.<br>
When the front wheel 13 is applied with shock due to irregularities of the ground or applied with a load upon braking, the swinging arm 9 is swung.  At this time, the swinging arm 9 integrated with the lever 10 is moved from the state shown in Fig. 6 to the state shown in Fig. 7, so that the compression spring 20, which is pressed forwardly toward the front forked portion 8 side by the lever 10, is elastically deformed.<br>
When the spring main body 21 is pressed in the<br>
radial direction, the necked connecting portion between the base 24 and the cylindrical elastic body 22 prevents the spring main body 21 from being bent in one direction with the aid of the reinforcing wall 26 provided on the compression spring 20 arranged on the side facing the swinging center of the lever 10.  As a result, the spring main body 21 is prevented from being tilted in an unbalanced state.<br>
In the state that the spring main body 21 is pressed in the radial direction, the necked connecting portion between the cylindrical elastic body 22 and the cylindrical elastic body 23 is also prevented from being bent in one direction, particularly, toward the swinging center side, with the aid of the reinforcing wall 27 provided between both side portions of the elastic bodies 22 and 23 arranged on the side facing the swinging center of the lever 10.  As a result, the spring main body 21 is prevented from being deformed such as a bend at its midpoint.<br>
As described above, the compression spring 20 is able to stabilize its shape upon elastic deformation and always obtain a specific load-deformation characteristic<br>
without necessity of provision of any additional supporting member, and to absorb a compression energy and ensure a damping force by the stable elastic deformation of the compression spring 20.<br>
The compression spring 20 is excellent in applicability and general-versatility because it does not require any supporting member. [ 0039 ]<br>
Next, a compression spring 50 according to another embodiment will be described with reference to Fig. 8.<br>
In the compression spring 50, two cylindrical elastic bodies 52 and 53 are stacked in the radial direction to form a spring main body 51.<br>
A base 54 which has a flat bottom surface 54b swelled along a plane perpendicular to the pressing direction is formed on the pressing force receiving side of the cylindrical elastic body 52.  The base 54 has a slot 54a passing through the base 54 in the width direction. The base 54 also forms part of the cylindrical elastic body 52 in a state that a flat upper surface 54c partially cuts the circular hollow 52a of the cylindrical elastic body 52.<br>
A cylindrical projection 55 is formed on the<br>
pressing portion of the cylindrical elastic body 53 in such a manner as to project therefrom at a certain angle.  The cylindrical projection 55 has a slot 55a extending in the direction perpendicular to the width direction.<br>
A side portion of the cylindrical elastic body 52 is integrally connected to a side portion of the cylindrical elastic body 53 by means of a reinforcing wall 57.<br>
Since the base 54 forms part of the cylindrical elastic body 52 in the state that the flat upper surface 54c partially cuts the circular hollow 52a of the cylindrical elastic body 52, both side portions of the cylindrical elastic body 52, serving as leg portions, are connected to the flat plate like base 54.  As a result, the connecting portion between the cylindrical elastic body 52 and the base 54 has not any necked portion.<br>
Accordingly, when being pressed in the radial direction, the cylindrical elastic body 52, that is, the spring main body 51 is prevented from being tilted in an unbalanced state.<br>
In the state that the spring main body 51 is pressed in the radial direction, the necked connecting<br>
portion between the cylindrical elastic body 52 and the cylindrical elastic body 53 is also prevented from being bent in one direction, particularly, toward the swinging center side, with the aid of the reinforcing wall 57 provided between both side portions of the elastic bodies 52 and 53 arranged on the side facing to the swinging center of the lever 10.  As a result, the spring main body 21 is prevented from being deformed such as a bend at its midpoint. [0044]<br>
As described above, the compression spring 50 is able to stabilize its shape upon elastic deformation and always obtain a specific load-deformation characteristic without necessity of provision of any additional supporting member, and to absorb a compression energy, ensuring a damping force by the stable elastic deformation of the compression spring 50.<br>
The compression spring 50 is excellent in applicability and general-versatility because it does not require any supporting member. [•0045]<br>
While the compression spring is made from a polyester elastomer in the above embodiments, it may be made from a material selected from other resins and<br>
rubbers.<br>
