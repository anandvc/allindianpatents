				<td>METHOD OF AND APPARATUS FOR SETTING UP ELECTRONIC DEVICE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a method of and an apparatus for setting up an electronic devise such ao a video camera (including a video tape recorder integrally combined with a video camera) for home use or a video cameid. for use in broadcasting stations. Description of the Related Art:<br>
Video cameras have many parameters including white, black, gamma, knee, detail and other parameters to be established, it has been customary for the usor of a video camera to establish thos parameters by adjusting volumes or variable resistors in the video camera or pressing an incre¬mental or decremental button on the video camera to incre¬ment or decrement parameter settings.<br>
However, the conventional practice :o establish many parameters of an electronic device such ass a video cam¬era is not an efficient process. Furthermore, when there are stringent standards imposed on video images outputted from video cameras for use in broadcasting stations, the user is required to actually shoot a reference image with the video camera and judge the reference image thus shot in order to confirm whether the parameters that have been es tablished satisfy those standards which have b€sen intended or imposed.<br>
There has been a demand for a process of estab¬lishing parameters for an electronic device such as a video camera more efficiently, reliably, and accurately than be¬fore.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the present inven¬tion to provide a method of and an apparatus for setting up an electronic device such as a video Cemara by establishing parameters thereof more efficiently, reliably, and accu¬rately than before.<br>
According to the present invention, there is pro¬vided a method of setting up an electronic device by trans¬mitting parameters indicated by a controller to a controlled device to set up the controlled device, comprising the steps of displayir^f a parameter setting image of a plurality of parameters that can be established with respect to the con¬trolled device, deciding whether input information is en¬tered or not while the parameter setting image is being dis¬played, changing a portion of the parameter setting image which corresponds to input information if such input infor¬mation is entered, establishing parameter data according to the input information, and transmitting the established pa¬rameter data or a change in the parameter data to the con¬trolled device to change a parameter in the controlled de¬vice.<br>
According to the present invention, there is also provided an apparatus for setting up an electronic device,<br>
comprising storage means for storing parameter setting image data for establishing one or more parameters with respect to a controlled device, the parameter setting im?ige including parameter changing switch image data and setting state dis¬play image data, display means for displaying a parameter setting image based on the parameter setting image data read from the storage means, input means for entering input in¬formation indicating changes in display states of a parame¬ter changing switch image data and a setting state display image which are displayed by the display means and a parame¬ter to be established, and control means for changing the<br>
diaplay   states   of   the  parameter  changing   switch image  data<br>
and the setting state display image which are displayed by the display means and the parameter to be established, based on the input information entered by the input means, and transmitting changed parameter data or a change in the pa¬rameter to the controlled device.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a method of setting up an electronic device by transmitting parameters indicated by a controller to said electronic device to set up the electronic device, said electronic device being positioned separate from the controller, the method comprising the steps of (a) displaying (Sal) on a display associated with the controller, a parameter setting image of a plurality of parameters that can be established with respect to the electronic device wherein said parameter setting image includes a parameter changing switch image and a setting state display image which moves or changes in the parameter setting image depending on the input information, (b) deciding (Sa4) whether input information has been entered into said controller while the parameter setting image is being displayed on said display associated with said controller, (c) changing (Sa5, Sa6) the display state of said parameter changing switch image depending on the input information, and/or changing the setting state display image displayed on said display associated with said controller in dependence upon the input information if such input information is entered, (d) establishing parameter data according to the input information and (e) transmitting (Sa7) the established parameter data or a change in the parameter data from the controller to the controlled device to the effect a change to a parameter in the electronic device.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also relates to a controller apparatus for setting up an electronic device, said controller being positioned separate from said electronic device and comprising storage means (8, 350) for storing parameter setting image data for establishing one or more parameters with respect to the electronic device, said parameter setting image including<br>
parameter changing switch image data and setting state display image data, display means (6, 50) for displaying a parameter setting image based on the parameter setting image data read from said storage means, input means (10, 11, 250, 300) for entering input information indicating changes in display states of a parameter changing switch image data and a setting state display image which are displayed by said display means and a parameter to be established and control means (1, 100) for changing the display states of the parameter changing switch image data and the setting state display image which are displayed at the controller by said display means for changing the value of the parameter to be established, based on the input information entered by said input means, and for transmitting changed parameter data or a change in the parameter to the controlled device to effect a change to the corresponding parameter in the electronic device.<br>

positional data from the position indicator 11, in the pa¬rameter setting image 7 which is being displayed on the dis¬play unit 6, and a parameter data generator 5 for generating or modifying parameter data represented by the parameter setting image 7 displayed on the display unit 6, based on the input data entered from the data input unit 10 or the positional data entered from the position indicator 11.<br>
The parameter setting image 7 comprises an image group 7a for displaying a setting status based on parameter settings, and a switch image group 7b for changing parame¬ters. The image group 7a comprises graphic images such as tables, graphs, or the like which correspond to the parame¬ters of the controlled device 13, and the switch image group 7b comprises visual switch images.<br>
The electronic device setup system has two opera¬tion modes, in one of the operation modes, the displayed state of the image group 7a for parameter valuos and parame¬ter settings is changed when the displayed state of the switch image group 7b is changed by the data input unit 10 or the position indicator 11.<br>
specifically, when input data are altered from the data input unit 10 or positional data are entered from the position indicator 11, the switch image group 7b dis¬played on the display unit 6 is changed depending on the entered input data or positional data as if a real switch or lever were moved by the operator, and the parameter data generator 5 generates or modifies the corresponding parame-<br>
ter data for changing the displayed state of the image group 7a.<br>
in the other operation mode, the displayed state of the image group 7a is changed by the data input unit 10 or the position indicator 11, the parameter values and the displayed state of the switch image group 7b is changed.<br>
Specifically, when input data are entered from the data input unit 10 or positional data are entered from the position indicator 11, the image group 7a displayed on the display unit 2 is changed depending on the entered input data or positional data, the corresponding parameter data are generated or modified by the parameter data generator 5, and the displayed state of the switch image group 7b is changed. Thus, the input data entered from the data input unit 10 or the positional data entered from the position indicator 11 are used as parameter setting information as shown in FIG. 1.<br>
The protocol converter 12 is indicated by the broken line in FIG. 1 because the protocol converter 12 will not be required if a protocol converting processs is carried out by the controlled device 13 rather than the protocol converter 12. Stated otherwise, the protocol converter 12 is required only if the controlled device 13 is incapable of carrying out a protocol converting process.<br>
For the sake of brevity, image data for selecting parameters are omitted from illustration. A parameter se¬lection image is an image for selecting the setting of a<br>
parameter among many parameters of the controlled device 13, and its data are held in the external memory 8. Operation:<br>
When a parameter of the controlled device 13 is selected by the data input unit 10 or the position indicator 11, the controller 1 reads parameter setting image data 9 corresponding to the selected parameter. Iiom the external memory 8 as indicated by the solid-line arrow Yl, and sup¬plies the read parameter setting image data 9 to the display unit 6 as indicated by the solid-line arrow Y2. The display unit 6 displays on its display panel a parameter setting image 7 represented by the parameter setting image data 9.<br>
Then, when input data are entered from the data input unit 10 as indicated by the solid-line arrow Y3, the input value recognizer 4 recognizes the value of the entered input data.. When positional data are entered from the posi¬tion indicator 11, the position recognizer 3 recognizes the position of a pointer in the parameter setting image 7, which corresponds to the entered positional data.<br>
Based on the pointer position recognized by the position recognizer 3 and the value of the entered input data recognized by the input value recognizer 1, the parame¬ter setting image display device 2 changes corresponding data of the parameter setting image data 9 representing the parameter setting image 7 displayed on the display unit 2, i.e., data of the image group 7a and data of the switch im¬age group 7b, and supplies the changed parameter setting<br>
image data 9 to the display unit 6 as indicated by the solid-line arrow Y2, thereby changing the displayed state of the image group 7a and the switch image group 7b on the dis¬play unit 2.<br>
The parameter data generator 5 generates or modi¬fies parameter data based on the pointer position recognized by the position recognizer 3 and the value of the entered input data recognized by the input value recognizer 4, and supplies the generated or modified parameter data to the protocol converter 12 as indicated by the solid-line arrow Y4.<br>
The protocol converter 12 converts the communica¬tion protocol of the parameter data supplied f::om the con¬troller 1 into a communication protocol which can be re¬ceived by the controlled device 13. The parameter data con¬verted by the protocol converter 12 are supplied therefrom to the controlled device 13 as indicated by th solid-line arrow Y5. The controlled device 13 changes this correspond¬ing value of parameters of its own using the parameter data supplied from the protocol converter 12. B. Operation of the electronic device setup system (see FIG.<br>
2):<br>
FIG. 2 shows an operation sequence of the an electronic device setup system shown in PIG. 1. The opera¬tion sequence comprises steps Sal - Sa8 which eire executed by the controller 1, steps Sbl - Sbll which arei executed by the protocol converter 12, and steps scl - Scl3 which are<br>
executed by the controlled device 13. The greater the nu¬merals contained in the reference characters which denote the above steps, the more subsequent the corresponding steps are in the entire operation sequence. Bl, Processing operation of the controller 1:<br>
in the step Sal, the parameter setting image dis¬play device 2 reads parameter selecting image data from the external memory 8, and supplies the read parameter selecting image data to the display unit 6. The display unit 6 now displays on its display panel a parameter selection image for selecting one or more of many parameters of the con¬trolled device 13. Thereafter, control proceeds to the step Sa2.<br>
In the step Sa2, the position recoqnizer 3 and the input value recognizer 4 decide whether parameter set¬ting information is fint.ored from the data input unit 10 and the position indicator 11. If parameter setting information is entered (YES), then control proceeds to the step Sa3.<br>
In the step Sa3, the parameter setting image dis¬play device 2 reads parameter setting image data 9 corre¬sponding to the selected parameter or parameters from the external memory 8 based on the data recognized by the posi¬tion recognizer 3 and the input value recognizer 4, and sup¬plies the read parameter setting image data 9 to the display unit 6. The display unit 6 now displays on its display panel a parameter setting image represented by the supplied<br>
parameter setting image data 9. Thereafter, control pro¬ceeds to the step Sa4.<br>
In the step Sa4, the position recognizer 3 and the input value recognizer 4 decide whether parameter set¬ting information is entered from the data inpu-i unit 10 and the position indicator 11. If parameter setting information is entered (YES), then control proceeds to the step Sa5.<br>
in the step sa5, the parameter data generator 5 generates or modifies parameter data based on the data rec¬ognized by the position recognizer 3 and the input value recognizer 4. Then, control proceeds to the step Sa6.<br>
In the step Sa6, the parameter sett-rig image dis¬play device 2 changes the image, displayed on the display unit 2, of the corresponding displayed data. Then, control proceeds to the step Sa7.<br>
in the step Sal, the parameter setting image dis¬play device 2 transmits the parameter data to the protocol converter 12, Then, control proceeds to the step Safi.<br>
In the step SaS, the position recognizer 3 and the input value recognizer 4 decide whether the entering of parameter setting information is from the data input unit 10 and the position indicator 11 is finished or not. If the entering of parameter setting information is finished (YES), then the processing comes to an end, B2. Processing operation of the protocol converter 12i<br>
In the step Sbl, the protocol converter 12 ia held in a standby condition. Then, control proceeds to the step Sb2.<br>
in the step sb2, the protocol converter 12 de¬cides whether parameter data are transmitted f::om the con¬troller 1 or not. if parameter data are transmitted (YES), then control proceeds to the step Sb9. If parameter data are not transmitted (NO), then control returns to the step Sbl.<br>
In the step Sb9, the protocol converter 12 re¬ceives the parameter data transmitted from the controller 1. Then, control proceeds to the step SblO. The sttep number jumps from "2" in the step Sb2 to "9" in the step Sb9 be¬cause the numerals contained in the steps represent the op¬erating sequence and the step Sb9 is carried out after the step Sa7,<br>
In the step SblO, the protocol converter 12 con¬verts the communication protocol of the parameter data re¬ceived in the st*p Sh9 into a communication protocol which can be received by the controlled device 13, Then, control proceeds to the step Sbll.<br>
In the step Sbll, the protocol converter 12 transmits the converted parameter data to the controlled device 13. Thereafter, control goes back to the step Sbl, B3, Processing operation of the controlled device 131<br>
In the step Scl, the controlled device 13 is held in a standby condition, Then, control proceeds to the step Sc2.<br>
in the step Sc2, the controlled device 13 decides whether parameter data are transmitted from tho protocol converter 12 or not. if parameter data are transmitted (YES), then control proceeds to the atep Scl2. If parameter data are not transmitted (NO), then control returns to the step Scl.<br>
In the step Scl2, the controlled device 13 re¬ceives the parameter data transmitted from the protocol con¬verter 12. Then, control proceeds to the step Scl3. The step number jumps from "2" in the step Sc2 to "12" in the step Scl2 because the numerals contained in thu steps repre¬sent the operating sequence and the step 5ul2 is carried out after the step Sbil.<br>
In the step Scl3, the controlled device 13 changes the value of the parameter or parameters of a corre¬sponding circuit or circuits based on the received parameter data. Then, control goes back to the step Scl. Advantages offered by the electronic device setup system shown in FIGS. 1 and 2:<br>
As described above, for establishing' a parameter or parameters of the controlled device 13 with the control¬ler 1, the electronic device setup system operates in either an operation mode in which the displayed state of the image group 7a is changed when the displayed state of the switch<br>
image group 7b is changed by the data input unit 10 or the position indicator 11, or an operation node in which the displayed state of the switch image group 7b 113 changed when the displayed state of the image group 7a is changed by the data input unit 10 or the position indicator 111, for thereby changing the parameter or parameters in a graphical environ¬ment. Consequently, th* enviroiuuunt for establishing pa¬rameters is improved, and the operator is prevented from changing parameters in error and allowed to confirm changed parameters.<br>
Specific details of the method of and the appara¬tus for setting up an electronic device according to the present invention will be described below. C, Arrangement and operation of a camera setup system (see FIG. 31i<br>
FIG. 3 shows in block form a camera setup system which incorporates the principles of the electronic device setup system shown in FIG. 1, Connections and structure!<br>
The camera setup system shown in FIG. 3 comprises a display unit 50 for displaying a parameter setting image 51 and a monitor image 52, a computer 100, a keyboard 250, a pointing device 300, a disk drive 350 for storing data of the parameter setting image 51 and program data, a data con¬verter 400 for converting the protocol of data transmitted from the computer 100, a system controller 1100, a plurality of controllers 1200-1, •••, 1200-n (one shown) connected to<br>
the system controller 1100, and a plurality of cameras 1000 (ona shown; connected respectively to the controllers 1200-1, '••, 1200-n. The system controller 1100 serves to supply data outputted from the data converter 400 selectively to the controllers 1200-1, •••, 1200-n and the caraeras 1000.<br>
The computer 100 and the disk drive 350 are in¬terconnected by a cable CA1. The computer 100 and the data converter 400 are interconnected by a cable CA2. The data converter 400 and the system controller 1100 are intercon¬nected by a cable CA3. The system controller 1100 and the controllers 1200-1, •••, 1200-n are interconnected by cables CA4. The controllers 1200-1, •••, 1200-n and the cameras 1000 are interconnected by cables CAS. The computer 100 and the cameras 1000 are interconnected by cables CA6.<br>
The parameter setting image 51 corresponds to the parameter setting image 7 shown in PIG, 1, The display unit 50 corresponds to the display unit 6 shown in FIG, 1. The computer 100 corresponds to the controller 1 shown in FIG. 1. The keyboard 250 corresponds to the data input unit 10 shown in FIG, 1. The pointing device 300 corresponds to the position indicator 11 shown in FIG, 1. The disk drive 350 corresponds to the external memory 8 shown in FIG. 1. Th data converter 400 corresponds to the protocol converter 12 shown in FIG. 1. The controllers 1200-1, •••, 1200-n and the cameras 1000 correspond to the controlled device 13 shown in FIG. 1.<br>
As with the protocol converter 12 shown in FIG. 1, the data converter 40 may be dispensed with if the system controller 1100 has a protocol conversion capability.<br>
Each of the controllers 1200-1, •••, 1200-n is generally referred to as a ecu (Camera Control unit). These controllers 1200-1, •••, 1200-n serve to control the cameras 1000 and handle part of a signal processing opwration for processing video and audio signals produced by the cameras 1000.<br>
Camera systems which comprise the controllers 1200-1, •••, 1200-n and the cameras 1000 are not used as single systems as is the case with VTRs integral with video cameras for home use. For this reason, each of the cameras 1000 is referred to as a CHU {Camera Head Unit) in broad¬casting stations.<br>
In FIG. 3, each of the camera systems in the cam¬era setup system comprises a CCU and a CHU. However, the camera setup system may be used with respect to a video cam¬era which is used as a single unit, in such a modification, the controllers 1200-1, •••, 1200-n may be dispensed with,<br>
The pointing device 300 may comprise a digitizer, a mouse, a track ball, a cursor key, a joy stick, or the like, for example.<br>
Each of the cameras 1000 has a videc system 500 and an audio system 600 disposed inside of its housing, and also has an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) unit 700, a control<br>
key group 750, a lens assembly 800, and a microphone 850 mounted on its housing.<br>
The disk drive 350 should preferably comprise a hard disk drive in view of its high access spend. Of course, the disk drive 350 may comprise an optical disk drive employing an recordable and reproducible optical disk which also has a relatively high access speed/ or a magnetic disk drive.<br>
The monitor image 52 is displayed on the display unit 50 based on a video signal captured by each of the cam¬eras 1000. Operation;<br>
When a parameter or parameters are selected, the computer 100 reads parameter setting image date stored in the disk drive 350. The parameter setting imace data read from the disk drive 350 are supplied through the cable CA1 and the computer 100 to the display unit 50, which displays the parameter setting image 51 on its display panel based on the supplied parameter setting image data.<br>
when a parameter change is indicated, in the pa¬rameter setting image 51 by the keyboard 250 or the pointing device 300, the computer 100 changes parameter data and the displayed state of a corresponding portion of the parameter setting image 51 based on the controlling information from the keyboard 250 or the pointing device 300.<br>
The computer 100 transmits the changed parameter data (absolute data) or data (relative data) indicative of<br>
the change through the cable CA2 to the data converter 400, The parameter data or the data indicative of the change which are supplied to tha data converter 400 the converted in protocol, and then supplied to the system controller 1100, which supplies the data to one of the controllers 1200-1, •••, 1200-n or one of the cameras 1000,,<br>
The manner in which the system controller 1100 recognizes one of the controllers 1200-1, •••, 1200-n or one of the cameras 1000 to which it should transmit; the data will be described later on with respect to a deita transmis¬sion format with reference to FIGS. 23A through 23E.<br>
While parameters are being established with re¬spect to one of the controllers 1200-1, •••, 1200-n or one of the cameras 1000 based on the parameter data, an output video signal from the camera 1000 is supplied to the com¬puter 100. Alternatively, an output video signal from one of the controllers 1200-1, •••, 1200-n may be supplied to the computer 100.<br>
After the output video signal from the camera 1000 is supplied to the computer 100, it is supplied to the display unit 50, which then displays the monitor image 52 based on the supplied output video signal.<br>
internal arrangements and operations of the indi¬vidual components of the camera setup system shown in PIG. 3 will be described below.<br>
D. Arrangement of the computer 100 in the camera setup sys¬tem shown in FIG. 3 (see FIG. 4<br>
FIG, 4 shows in block form the computer 100 in the camera setup system shown in FIG. 3. Connections and structure:<br>
The computer 100 comprises a CPU 101, a bus as¬sembly 102 connected to the CPU 101 and comprising address, data, and control buses, a ROM (Read-Only Memory) 103 con¬nected to the bus assembly 102 for storing a basic in¬put/output control system, etc., a working RAM (Random-Access Memory) 104 connected to the bus assembly 102, a VRAM (Video Random-Access Memory) 104 connected to the bus assem¬bly 102 for storing video images to be displayed, and an input/output port 106 connected to the bus assembly 102. To the input/output port 106, there are connected a floppy disk interface 108 connected to a floppy disk drive 107, an 1C card interface 110 connected to a card slot 109, a pointing device interface 111 connected to an input/output terminal 112 which is coupled to the pointing device 300 shown in FIG. 3, a keyboard interface 113 connected to an in¬put/output terminal 114 whi^h is coupled to the keyboard 250 shown in FIG, 3, an image display accelerator 115 for con¬trolling the display of images instead of the CPU 101, the image display accelerator 115 being connected to an output terminal 116 which is coupled to the display unit 50 shown in FIG. 3, a video capture unit 117 for capturing video im¬ages, the video capture unit 117 being connected to an input terminal 118 which is coupled to the cameras 1000 or the controllers 1200-1, •••, 1200-n shown in PIG, 3, a communi-<br>
cation interface 119 connected to an input/output terminal 120 which is coupled to the data converter 400 shown in FIG. 3, a SCSI (Small Computer Systems interface) 121 connected to an input/output terminal 122 which is coupld to the disk drive 350 shown in FIG, 3, and an audio input/output circuit 123 connected to an input terminal 125 which iss coupled to the cameras 1000 or the controllers 1200-1, • ••, 1200-n shown in FIG. 3. A loudspeaker 124 is connected to the audio input/output circuit 123.<br>
The communication interface 119 may comprise an RS-232C interface or an RS-422 interface, for example. The image display accelerator 115 is capable of displaying im¬ages with 12SO x 1024 dots in 16770 thousand colors on the display unit 50 shown in FIG. 3.<br>
when the computer 100 is turned on/ the CPU 101 reads a basic input/output control system 126 (BIOS) which is stored in the ROM 103, and then reads program data of an operating system from the disk drive 350 shown in FIG, 3, and further reads program data of drivers.<br>
when a camera setup system (described later on) is selected on a displayed image of the operating system, the CPU 101 reads program data of the camera sebup system from the disk drive 350. Blocks enclosed in a .rectangular frame which is indicated by the dot-and-dash li:ie represent functions of the CPU 101 which can be performed by the basic input/output control system, the operating system, the driv-<br>
era, and the camera setup system which are resident in a main memory of the CPU 101,<br>
The basic input/output control aysturn 126 serves to control input and output data, e.g., to receive and rec¬ognize input data from the keyboard 250, to receive and rec¬ognize positional data from the pointing devic 300, and to send display data to the display unit 50, The basic in¬put/output control system 126 is normally stored as a con¬version table in the ROM 103. In this embodiment, however, the basic input/output control system 126 is resident in the main memory of the CPU 101,<br>
An 1C card driver 127 allows the computer 100 to send data to and receive data from an 1C card which is in¬serted in the card slot 109. An accelerator driver 128 per¬mits data to be transmitted between the computer 100 and the image display accelerator 115, A video capture driver 130 permits data to be transmitted between the computer 100 and the video capture unit 117. An audio driver 131 permits data to be transmitted between the computer 100 and the audio input/output circuit 123.<br>
An operating system 129 should preferably com¬prise an operating system capable of managing file data, controlling the disk drive 350, and otherwise providing a graphical user interface. For example, the operating system 129 may comprise an operation system such as MS-WINDOW pro¬vided by Microsoft, SYSTEM 7.5 provided by Appl-3 CompuLei, or OS/2 provided by IBM. Alternatively, an operating system<br>
with no graphical user interface may be realized by the above camera setup system.<br>
The other functions include an instruction ana¬lyzer 132, a command analyzer 133, a display controller 134, a parameter controller 138, a command generator 139, a file manager 14 C, and an arithmetic unit 141 which are performed by the camera setup system.<br>
The instruction analyzer 132 is capable of ana¬lyzing instructions based on input data from the pointing device interface 111 and the keyboard interface: 113.<br>
The command analyzer 132 is capable of analyzing commands in input data from the interface 119.<br>
The display controller 134 is capable of changing data stored in the VRAM 105 according to instructions ana¬lyzed by the instruction analyzer 132.<br>
The parameter controller 138 is capable of chang¬ing parameter data according to instructions analyzed by the instruction analyzer 132.<br>
The command genftrator 139 is capable of transmit¬ting parameter data or data indicative of changes through the interface 119 and the input/output terminal 120 to the controllers 1200-1, •••, 1200-n or the cameras 1000, and also of issuing commands.<br>
The file manager 140 is capable of holding and managing files of parameter data for the controllers 1200-1, •••, 1200-n and the cameras 1000.<br>
The arithmetic unit 141 ia capable of carrying out arithmetic operations for changing parameter data and display data according to instructions analyzed by the in¬struction analyzer 132.<br>
Operation of the computer 100 shown in FIG, 4 will be described in detail later on with reference to FIGS. 6A, 6B through 23A - 23E.<br>
E. Control operation according to a main routine of the com¬puter 100 shown in FIG. 4 (see FIG. 5)i<br>
FIG, 5 shows a control sequence according to a main routine of the computer 100 shown in FIG. 4. The con¬trol sequence is started when the computer 100 is turned on,<br>
In a step 8101, an initializing procram stored in the ROM 103 is read, dud causes the cyu 101 to checJc a con¬nected device, Then, control proceeds to a step SI02,<br>
in the step S102, the CPU 101 initializes the RAM 104 and the VRAM 105. Thereafter, control proceeds to a step S103.<br>
in the step S103, the basic input/output control system 126 starts to operate, Then, control proceeds to a step S104.<br>
In the step S104, the basic input/output control system 126 reads the program data of the operating system 129 from the disk drive 350, thereby starting t/ie operating system 129. Then, control proceeds to a step SL05.<br>
In the step S105, the operating system 129 reads the program data of the 1C card driver 127, the accelerator<br>
driver 128,, the video capture unit 130, and this audio driver 131 from the disk drive 350, and starts the 1C card driver 127, the accelerator driver 128, the video capture unit 130, and the audio driver 131. Then, control proceeds to a step S106.<br>
in the step 8106, the operating system 129 con¬firms the camera setup system, Then, control proceeds to a step S107. Specifically, the operating system 129 confirms the camera setup system by reading information relative to the program data registered in the operating system 126 from files which are owned by the operating system 126. For ex¬ample, such information includes information indicating that the camera setup system is registered as a starting program and information as to icons of the camera setup system.<br>
In the step S107, the operating system 129 writes image data of the operation system 129 in the VRAM 105. The image data of the operating system 129 written in the VRAM 105 are supplied through the image display accelerator 115 and the output terminal 116 to the display unit 50. There¬after, control proceeds to a step S108,<br>
if the camera setup system is registared with respect to the operating system 129, an icon indicative of the camera setup system is also displayed.<br>
In the step S108, the operating system 129 de¬cides whether the camera setup system is selected or not. If the camera setup system is selected (YES), then control<br>
proceeds to a step S150. if the camera setup system is not selected (NOT), then control jumps to a step s:i09.<br>
The camera setup system is selected when the pointer image of the pointing device 300 is superposed on the icon of the camera setup system in the imaqe of the op¬erating system 129 displayed on the display un:.t 50 and also when the pointing device 300 is double-clicked by the opera¬tor. The pointing device 300 is double-clicked when a but¬ton on the pointing device 300 is pressed successively twice by the operator.<br>
In the step S150, the processing operation of the camera setup system is executed. Then, control goes to the step si09.<br>
In the step S109, the operating system 129 de¬cides whether a setup program of the camera setup system is finished or not. If the setup program is finished (YES), then control proceeds to a step S110. If the setup program is not finished (NO), then control returns to the step S150.<br>
In the step 8110, the operating system 129 de¬cides whether its operation is finished or not. If the op¬eration of the operating system 129 is finished (YES), then control proceeds to a step Sill. If the operation of the operating system 129 is not finished (NOT), then control goes back to the step S107,<br>
In the step Sill, the operating system 129 is finished by making itself non-resident in the main memory of the CPU 101.<br>
F. Initial images produced by the operating system 129 in the computer 100 shown in FIG. 4 (see FIGS. 6A and 6B)i<br>
FIG. 6A shows a window image Wa in <an uppermost layer produced by the operating system ami fig. shows manner in which camera setup is started.></an>

The menu bar MBa has a plurality of menu images representing menus "ICON", "OPTION", "WINDOW", and "HELP". When one of the menu images is selected, it displays a pull¬down menu comjjiising related commands. To select one of the menu images, the operator may press a certain key on the keyboard 250 shown in FIG. 3, and then press a cursor key on the keyboard 250. Alternatively, the operator nay move the pointing device 300 to bring a pointer PO to a desired one of the words, and then click the word. The operator then selects and clicks a desired one of the command;* displayed on the pull-down menu which is displayed as a rosult of the selection of one of the menu images.<br>
The alphabetic letters in lower case, which are contained in the window image Wa, indicate the levels of<br><br><br>
layers. The alphabetic letter "a" indicates trie highest level of layer, and the alphabetic letters "b", "c", "d", ••• indicate the progressively lower levels of layers. The window image Wa contains the button images CB, IB, EB at all times.<br>
in the window image Wa shown in FIG, 6A, the pointer Po is moved by the pointing device 300 to a position over the icon iCa marked with "CAMERA SETUP", and thereafter the button on the pointing device 300 is clicked once. Then, as shown in FIG. 6B, a window image wb in a next lower layer is displayed on the display unit 50.<br>
In the window image Wb shown in FIG, 6B, the pointer Po is moved by the pointing device 300 to a position over an icon ICb marked with "CAMERA SETUP", and thereafter the button on the pointing device 300 is double-clicked, thereby executing the camera setup system. G. connection configuration window which is displayed at first when the camera setup system shown in FIG. 3 starts to operate (see FIG. 7):<br>
FIG, 7 shows a connection configuration window which is displayed at first when the camera setjp system shown in FIG. 3 starts to operate.<br>
A window image We shown in FIG. 7 is displayed when a file of connection configuration information is read which was generated when the camera setup system started the last time, The window image we contains icon images Cal -Ca6 of cameras, icon images Cul - Cu6 of CCUs connected re-<br>
spctivoly to tho icon images Cal - Ca6, an icon image Cnl of a GNU (Camera Network Unit) which is connected to the icon images Cul *• Cu6, an icon image vcl of a VCS (Video Camera Selector) connected to the icon image Cnl, and a menu bar MBc which contains menus "FILE", "EDIT", "JSETUP", and "HELP".<br>

L. Basics of a parameter setting window of the camera setup system (see FIG. 13).<br>
FIG. 13 illustrates basics of a parameter setting window We which is displayed as a parameter setting window for setting the parameters of a camera or a CCU which are described above.<br>
The parameter setting window we showr in FIG. 13 is displayed by placing the pointer Po over one of the icon images shown in FIG. 8 and double-clicking the button of the pointing device 300 or placing the pointer Po over one of the commands on the pull-down menus shown in FIGS. 10A - IOC through 12A - 12D while the button of the pointing device 300 is being pressed and thereafter releasing the button of the pointing device 300. The monitor image 52 shown in FIG, 3 is omitted from illustration in FIG. 13.<br>
?or illustrative purpose, it is assumed that set¬tings are to be established with respect to an audio signal in the parameter setting window we. The parameter setting window We has an area Arl containing a title image Ti and a button image BU. The title image Ti represents a title "SOLO", indicating that the selected audio signal is output-ted singly. The button BU switches between "ON" and "OFF" each time the button of the pointing device 300 is clicked after the pointer PO is placed on the button BU. That is, various data are established with respect to tho button BU, and switched each time the button of the pointing device 300 is clicked, In the illustrated example, the button BU is set to "ON", and hence the title "SOLO" represented by the title image Ti is "ON", i.e., effective.<br>
The parameter setting window We has nm area Ar2 containing a title image Ti and switch images SK' represented by numerical values "l" - "5". The title image Ti repre¬sents a title "OUTPUT", indicating an "output terminal". The numerical values "1" - "5" indicate the numters of out¬put terminals for an audio signal. One of the switch images SW is selected by placing the pointer Po over that switch image SW and thereafter clicking the button of the pointing device 300. At this time, one of the numerical values "1" -"5" which is indicated by the selected switch image SW, i.e., the corresponding number of the output terminal, is selected.<br>
The parameter setting window we has nm area Ar3 containing a slide lever image SL and a numeral image dis¬played in an area Ar indicated by the broken lir.es. The slide lever image SL comprises a lever image Ma and a refer¬ence point image PO which is displayed at a central position if a value to be set is an absolute value and displayed at a position before being changed if a value to be set is a relative value. The area Ar3 also displays a numeral image indicating a negative maximum value and a numeral image in¬dicating a positive maximum value, respectively on the oppo¬site ends of the slide lever image SL.<br>
The lever image Ma is moved with the pointing device 300 when the pointing device 300 is moved while the pointer Po is being placed over the lever image Ma and the button of th» pointing device 300 ie being pressed. The area Ar displays a numerical value depending on the distance which the pointing device 300 is moved,<br>
The parameter setting window We has an area Ar4 which displays therein a graph corresponding to a parameter being presently set as shown or a waveform image Li when the pointer Po is placed over a button image WBU below the area Ar4 and thereafter the button of the pointing device 300 is clicked. When the pointer Po is placed over the button im¬age WBU and thereafter the button of the pointing device 300 is clicked again, the waveform image Li displayed in the area Ar4 disappears.<br>
It should be noted that when the pointing device 300 is moved up and down while the button of the pointing device 300 is pressed with the pointer Po placec, over a cir¬cular point P indicated by the broken line on the waveform image Li, the waveform image Li is also moved up and down as indicated by the solid-line arrow, and that when the wave¬form im*g» Li is thus moved up and down, the value of the parameter data held in the computer varies, the lever Ma of the slide lever image SL moves, and the numeral image dis¬played in the area Ar varies. This process is controlled by the instruction analyzer 132, the display controller 134, and the parameter controller 138 shown in FIG. 4.<br>
The operator can thus control the parameters of the cameras and the CCUs with the camera setup system which has a graphical user interface as shown in FIG. 13.<br>
Displayed examples of the parameter setting image We which correspond to the respective parameters will be described later on with reference to FIGS. 30 through 87. in those displayed examples of the parameter setting image We, only the parameters differ, but the basic method of us¬ing the button BU, the switch images SW, the numeral image in the area Ar, the slide lever image SL, the waveform image Li, and the button image WBU, and the basis processing car¬ried out when these images are controlled by the pointing device 300 remain the same. Therefore, those basic method and processing which have been described above with respect to FIG. 13 will not be repeated in the description of dis-<br>
'played examples of the parameter setting image We shown in FIGS. 30 through 87.<br>
M. A main processing sequence of the camera setup system (see FIGS. 14 through 16).<br>
FIGS. 14 through 16 shows a main processing se¬quence of the camera setup system in the step SI 50 shown in FIG. 5,<br>
in a step si51 shown in FIG. 14, the parameter controller 138 shown in PIG. 4 initializes the BAM 103, etc. Also in the step S151, the file manager 140 reads the image data of the connection configuration window shown in PIG. 7 from the disk drive 350 shown in FIG, 3. The display con¬troller 134 writes the image data of the connection configu¬ration window in the VRAM 105. The image data cf the con¬nection configuration window written in the VRAM 105 are supplied through the image display accelerator 115 and the output terminal 116 to the display unit 50, which displays the connection configuration window on its display panel. Then, control proceeds to a step SI52.<br>
in the step S152, when the operator selects one of the icon images Cal - Ca6 of cameras or the icon images Cul - Cu6 of ecus in the displayed uunneution configuration window, the command generator 152 issues a command for re¬questing the transmission of device type ID data to one of the cameras 1000 or the controllers 1200-1, •••, 1200-n shown in FIG. 4. Then, control proceeds to a step S153.<br><br>
In the step S153, the command generator 152 de¬cides whether it has acquired the device type IE' data or not. if it has acquired the device type ID data (YES), then control proceeds to a step si55. if it has not acquired the device type ID data (NO), then control goes to a step S154.<br>
in the step S154, the display controller 134 writes in tha VRAM 105 alarm image data for prompting the operator to confirm whether one of the cameras 1000 or the controllers 1200-1, •••, 1200-n, which the operator has se¬lected, is connected or not. The alarm image data written in the VRAM 105 are displayed as an alarm image on the dis¬play unit 50. The command generator 139 transmits a command for requesting the transmission of device type ID data to the selected one of the cameras 1000 or the controllers 1200-1, •••, 1200-n. Thereafter, control returns to the step S153.<br>
In the step S155, the file manager 402 confirms the acquired device type ID data by specifying a device type setting file corresponding to the acquired device type ID data. Then, control proceeds to a step si56.<br>
in the step 3156, the file manager 402 reads the device type setting file corresponding to the acquired de¬vice type ID which is confirmed in the step S155 from the disk drive 350. Thereafter, control returns to the step S157.<br>
in the step S157, the file manager 402 decides whether it has properly read file data from the device type<br>
setting file or not. if it has properly read the file data (YES), then control proceeds to a step S159. If it has not properly read the file data (NO), then control goes to a step S158.<br>
In the step S158, the display controller 134 writes in the VRAM 105 alarm image data indicating that the file manager 402 has failed to read the file data. The alarm image data written in the VRAM 105 are displayed as an alarm image on the display unit 50. Then, control goes back to the step S156.<br>
In. the step S159, the parameter controller 138 establishes setting items based on the device type setting file data read by the file manager 140, and the display con¬troller 134 writes window image data in the VRAK 105 based on the device type setting file data. The window image data written in the VRAM 105 are displayed as a window image on the display unit 50, Then, control proceeds to a step S160.<br>
In the step S160, the command generator 139 is¬sues a command for confirming a connection to the data con¬verter 400. The command generator 139 decides whether the data converter 400 is connected or not based on whether it has received a response to the command or not. If the data converter 400 is connected (YES), then control proceeds to a step S161 shown in FIG. 15. If the data converter 400 is not connected (NO), then control jumps to a step S162 shown in FIG. 15.<br>
In the step S161, the command generator 139 is¬sues a command for requesting the transmission cf setup data indicating a present setup status to the selected one of the cameras 1000 or the controllers 1200-1, •••, 1200-n. Then, control goes to a step S163.<br>
in the step S163, the command generator 139 de¬cides whether it has acquired the setup data or not. If it has acquired the setup data (YES), then control proceeds to a step S164, if it has not acquired the setup data (NO), then control goes back to the step S162,<br>
In the step S164, the file manager 140 stores the transmitted present setup data as a file in the RAM 103. Thereafter, control proceeds to a step S165.<br>
In the step S165, the file manager 140 verifies<br>
the contents of the setup data stored in the RAM 103. Then, control proceeds to a step si66.<br>
In the step S166, the file manager 140 decides, as a result of the verification process in the step S165, whether the contents of the transmitted setup data and the contents of the setup data stored in the RAM 103 agree with each other or not. if they agree with each other (YES), then control jumps to a step S174 shown in FIG. 16. If they do not agree with each other (NO), then control proceeds to a atep S167.<br>
in the step S167, the display controller 134 writes disagreement information image data indicative of the disagreed data contents in the VRAM 105. The disagreement<br>
information .image data written in the VRAM 105 are displayed as an image on the display unit 50. Thereafter, control proceeds to a step 8168.<br>
in the step S168, the command analyzer 133 de¬cides whether it has been instructed by the operator to set up the device according to the present setup data or not. If it has been instructed to set up the device (YES), then control goes to a step S169. if it has not been instructed to set up the device (NO), then control goes to a step S170.<br>
In the step S169, the display controller 134 writes in the VRAM 105 image data indicative of the contents of setup items according to the present setup data. The image data written in the VRAM 105 are displayed as an image on the display unit 50. Thereafter, control goes to the step S174 shown in FIG. 16.<br>
In the step S170, the display controller 134 writes in the VRAM 105 image data indicative of the contents of setup items according to the contents of a setting file.

In FIG. 37B, the button "WAVEFORM »" for output-ting a waveform is turned on by clicking the button of the pointing device 300. Therefore, a waveform image is dis¬played. KP represents a knee point, and WC OFF represents a white clip off. As shown in FIG. 37B, the button "KNEE" is "OFF", when the button "KNEE" is "ON", a level in excess of<br>
the knee point is adjusted as shown by the broken lines in the waveform image as indicated by the arrow.<br>
FIG. 33A shows, by way of example, a displayed image for establishing detail level parameters/<br>
FIG. 3SB shows, by way of example, a displayed image for establishing detail level parameters, the dis¬played image including a displayed waveform.<br>
As shown in FIG. 38B, the detail level can be adjusted by moving a point P with the pointing device 300 in the directions indicated by the solid-line arrow. However, the width of the waveform cannot be varied as indicated by the broken lines at the bottom of the waveform.<br>
The distance between the two intermediate broken lines represents the detail level. When the numerical value is 0 %, the detail level is 0 %, and when the numerical value is 100 %, the detail level is 100 %.<br>
FIG. 39A shows, by way of example, a displayed image for establishing ratio parameters.<br>
In FIG. 39A, the parameter "H/V RATIC", which represents 130 I as a whole, is divided into H and v areas by the slide lever, and each of the H and v areas indicates a percentage. For a relative representation of 99 %, the entire parameter range extends from - 99 to 0 - 99, with no H and v percentage representations, and the parameter is represented by a relative value as with other slide levers.<br>
The parameter "H/L RATIO" may present a relative representation of i 99, and increases as it goes toward 100 I.<br>
FIG, 39B shows, by way of example, a displayed image for establishing a gamma mix ratio parameter.<br>
FIG. 40 shows, by way of example, a displayed image for establishing a gamma mix ratio parameter, the dis¬played image including a displayed waveform.<br>
As shown in FIG. 40, the letters "PRE", "POST" are displayed above the slide lever. The parameter "PRE" is "100 %", i.e., the pre-to-post ratio of the gamma mix is 100 % as a pre value. Therefore, the amount of detail remains the same when the video level is low or high as indicated by the elliptical broken lines.<br>
The slide lever is displayed in a relative repre¬sentation.<br>
When the slide lever represents 0, the pre-to-post ratio cf the gamma mix is 50 % : 50 %.<br>
When the slide lever represents - 99, the pre-to-post ratio cf the gamma mix is 100 % : 0 %,<br>
When the slide lever represents + 99, the pre-to-post ratio of the gamma mix is 0 % : 100 %.<br>
FIG. 41 shows, by way of example, a displayed image for establishing a gaiwna mix ratio parameter, the diM-played image including a displayed waveform.<br>
Since the parameter "POST" is "100 I", i.e., the pre-to-post ratio of the gamma mix is 100 % as a post value.<br>
Therefore, The amount of detail is smaller when the video level is lower, and the amount of detail is greater when the video level is higher, as indicated by the elliptical broken lines.<br>
FIG. 42 shows, by way of example, a displayed image for establishing R, G, B mix parameters.<br>
As shown in FIG, 42, the parameter "MIX RAIO" for "H-DTL" includes an area having a fixed value of 50 4 for G (green), and a remaining area divided into variable % values for R (red) and B (blue) by the slide lever.<br>
The parameter "V-DTL MODE" for "V-DTL" has two buttons "MIX", "NAM". When the button "NAM" is selected, contrary to the selection in the illustrated example, the mix ratio has no bearing on this parameter, and the data cannot be changed.<br>
In the parameter "MIX RATIO", two slide levers are displayed, dividing Lhe entire Lai into variable % val¬ues for R, G, B. The slide levers represent ratios R s B and RB : G. when the ratio R : B is changed, the lever of the ratio RB : G is not moved. When the lever of the ratio RB s G is mcved, the lever of the ratio R : B isi also moved therewith because the ratio R : B varies at the same ratio.<br>

in FIG. 44B, a parameter setting im,ge is dis¬played when a waveform display button is turned on by the pointing device 300. As shown in FIG. 44B, when the button of the pointing device 300 is pressed at a pointer PI or P2 and then moved in the directions indicated by the arrow, the width w of a white level or the width B of a black level in a horizontal direction can be changed. At the same time, the displayed slide levers and numerical values are also changed.<br>
The parameter "MASTER LIMIT LEVEL" nay not be used depending uu the type of a camera connected.  In such a case, this parameter is not displayed or masked in its dis¬play by shading or the like, so that it cannot be accessed.<br>
The slide lever may be displayed in a relative representation of t 99, when the slide lever moves toward +, it moves in a limiting direction, and when the slide lever moves toward -, it moves in an unlimitinci direction.<br>
When the limit level is 0 %, no lim:.t is applied, and the detail may be applied up to a maximum detail level.<br>
When the limit level is 100 %, a maximum limit is applied, and hence no detail is applied.<br>
FIG. 45A shows, by way of example, i displayed image for establishing v limiter parameters.<br>
FIG. 45B shows, by way of example, .1 displayed image for establishing v limiter parameters, the displayed image including a displayed waveform.<br>
In FIG. 45B, a parameter setting image is dis¬played when a waveform display button is turned on by the pointing device 300. As shown in FIG. 45B, whan the button of the pointing device 300 is pressed at a pointer PI or P2 and then moved in the directions indicated by the arrow, the width w of a white level or the width B of a black level in a vertical direction can be changed. At the same time, the displayed slide levers and numerical values are also changed.<br>
FIG. 46 shows, by way of example, a displayed image for establishing knee aperture parameters.<br>
FIG. 47 shows, by way of example, a displayed image for establishing knee aperture parameters, the dis¬played image including a displayed waveform.<br>
As shown in'FIG. 47, when the button "KNEE" is "OFF", the displayed KP (knee point) disappears, and the displayed waveform image becomes a linear step-like waveform image. Detail levels for H, v, black, and white are applied at x 1.0. When the button "KNEE" is "ON" and the* button "KNEE APERTURE" is "OFF", the knee is applied at a step higher than the knee point, but the detail level remains fixed at x l.o,<br>
Data may be established by moving the slide lev¬ers or changing the displayed numerical values. While the waveform image varies in unison with the slide lervers, the settings cannot not be varied by moving the waveform image in this parameter setting image.<br>
The detail l&amp;vel of x 1.0 is the same as a detail level lower than the knee point. The detail level of x 2.0 is twice a detail level lower than the knee point. The de¬tail level of x 0 eliminates details above the knee pcdnt.<br>
In broken-line elliptical areas in the displayed waveform image, the detail levels of black and white a.re adjusted with respect to details above the knee point.<br>
The buttons "H", "V" ("V" is shown as selected) displayed below the waveform image serve to switch between H and V displayed waveform images.<br>
