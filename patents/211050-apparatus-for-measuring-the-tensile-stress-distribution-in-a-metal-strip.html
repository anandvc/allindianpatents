				<td>Description<br>
Apparatus for measuring the tensile stress distribution<br>
in a metal strip<br>
The invention relates to a method and an appara<br>
tus for measuring the tensile stress distribution in a<br>
metal strip between two roll stands or between a roll<br>
stand and a coiler. In addition, the invention can be<br>
used in conjunction with S rolls and blooming-mill<br>
stands.<br>
During the rolling of metal strips, in particular<br>
during cold rolling, the tensile stress distribution in<br>
the metal strip, along the metal width, has to be deter-<br>
mined on line, that is to say it usually has to be<br>
measured, since the tensile stress distribution is the<br>
decisive variable for controlling the flatness of the<br>
metal strip.<br>
For example, it is known to guide the metal strip<br>
over a so-called measuring roll, that is to say a seg-<br>
mented guide roll, which has piezoelectric pressure<br>
sensors at intervals of about 2-5 cm. The force acting on<br>
the sensors in this case is a measure of the tensile<br>
stress distribution. The method involves contact - and<br>
can therefore leave behind impressions in the metal -<br>
and, in addition, involves wear and is thus maintenance-<br>
intensive.<br>
Furthermore, DE-A-26 17 958 discloses an<br>
apparatus for measuring the tensile stress of a metal<br>
strip, oscillatory waves being generated in the metal<br>
strip by means of electric hammers and their propagation<br>
being measured. This method is also subject to the<br>
disadvantages mentioned above.<br>
Furthermore, DE-C-31 30 572 discloses the opera-<br>
tion of measuring the tensile stress of a metal strip by<br>
means of ultrasound. To this end, the metal strip is made<br>
to oscillate by means of ultrasound, and the propagation<br>
of this oscillation is measured. However, it has been<br>
shown that this method is suitable only in exceptional<br>
cases, in particular in the case of particularly thin<br>
metal strips, because of the low energy transmission by<br>
means of ultrasound.<br>
The object of the invention is to specify an<br>
apparatus for avoiding the disadvantages described above.<br>
According to the invention, the object is <br>
achieved by an apparatus according to (Claim l, The<br>
apparatus according to the invention for measuring the<br>
tensile stress distribution in a metal strip between two<br>
roll stands, between a roll stand and a coiler, in a<br>
blooming-mill stand or upstream or downstream of a guide<br>
roll has a deflection device (arranged upstream or down-<br>
stream of a roll) for deflecting the metal strip, a<br>
measuring device for measuring the deflection of the<br>
metal strip and a computing device for calculating the<br>
tensile stress distribution as a function of the deflec-<br>
tion of the metal strip, the deflection device being<br>
designed as a suction device to apply suction to the<br>
metal strip. This apparatus, on the one hand, makes it<br>
possible to measure the tensile stress or tensile stress<br>
distribution without damaging the metal strip and, on the<br>
other hand, supplies a particularly strong and precise<br>
measurement signal, which permits particularly precise<br>
determination of the tensile stress or tensile stress<br>
distribution in the metal strip. The apparatus according<br>
to the invention is also considerably more straight-<br>
forward and cost-effective than a measuring roll.<br>
Further advantages and details emerge from the<br>
following description of exemplary embodiments and from<br>
the subclaims. Specifically:<br>
FIG 1 shows an exemplary configuration of a suction<br>
device,<br>
FIG 2 shows an alternative configuration of a suction<br>
device,<br>
FIG 3 shows a further alternative configuration of a<br>
suction device,<br>
FIG 4 shows an advantageous configuration of plates of<br>
a suction device,<br>
FIG 5 shows an arrangement of sensors,<br>
PIG 6 shows an alternative arrangement of sensors, and<br>
FIG 7 shows a comparison between ascertained tensile<br>
stress and actual tensile stress.<br>
FIG 1 shows an exemplary configuration of an<br>
apparatus according to the invention for measuring the<br>
tensile stress distribution in a metal strip 1. The metal<br>
strip 1 runs out of a roll stand 3 and is guided in the<br>
direction of the arrow 5 by means of a guide roll 4. A<br>
suction device 6 is arranged at a distance a,<br>
advantageously 10 to 30 cm, from the guide roll 4. By<br>
selecting the distance a to be 10 to 30 cm, particularly<br>
good spatial resolution of the tensile stress over the<br>
strip width is achieved. Plates 9 and 10 are arranged at<br>
the upper end of the suction device 6. The air stream<br>
that is taken in by the suction device effects a deflec-<br>
tion of the metal strip 1. This deflection is indicated<br>
by the dashed line 2. Integrated into the plates 9 and 10<br>
of the suction device are deflection sensors 7 and 8,<br>
which measure the deflection 2 of the metal strip 1. The<br>
deflection sensors 7 and 8 are designed as eddy-current<br>
sensors, capacitive distance sensors, optical distance<br>
sensors or ultrasonic distance sensors. The design as<br>
eddy-curzrent sensors, in particular time-synchronized<br>
eddy-current sensors, is particularly advantageous. The<br>
distance sensors are particularly advantageously designed<br>
as rows of sensors over the width of the metal strip 1.<br>
The suction device 6 has a rotary throttle 11, by<br>
means of which the air stream which has been taken in is<br>
modulated.. The air stream is advantageously modulated at<br>
a frequency of 5 to 40 Hz, in particular at a frequency<br>
of 5 to 20 Hz. In this way, without additional damping,<br>
a virtually quasi-static deflection is achieved, so that<br>
the result, even without additional damping measures, is<br>
a deflection that is essentially proportional to the<br>
exciting force and inversely proportional to the tensile<br>
stress distribution. The tensile stress distribution may<br>
be measured particularly precisely in this way. It has<br>
proven to be particularly advantageous to excite the<br>
metal strip 1 at a frequency which lies below its reson-<br>
ant frequency. Surprisingly, a more precise measurement<br>
of the tensile stress distribution may be achieved in<br>
this frequency range.<br>
The plates 9 and 10 are arranged at a distance b<br>
of advantageously 1 to 10 mm, in particular 5 mm, from<br>
the metal strip 1. A gap of width c is provided between<br>
the metal plates 9 and 10. This gap is advantageously 0.5<br>
to 5 cm wide. A gap width c = 2 cm is particularly<br>
advantageous. between 5 and 30 cm, in particular<br>
The plates 9 and 10 are about 20 cm wide, with<br>
the result that the vacuum produced by the suction device<br>
6 acts on a finite area of the metal strip 1.<br>
In order to evaluate the measurement signals<br>
supplied by the distance sensors 7 and 8, provision is<br>
made for an evaluation device (not illustrated).<br>
The suction device 6 is dimensioned such that a<br>
vacuum between 5 and 50 mbar is produced between the<br>
plates 9 and 10 and the metal strip 1.<br>
FIG 2 shows an alternative configuration of a<br>
suction device 21. In FIGS 2 and 3, the arrows identified<br>
by reference symbol 20 indicate the movement of the air<br>
(an air stream pulsed at a frequency between 5 and<br>
20 Hz) , and the arrows designated by 30 indicate the<br>
forces acting on the metal strip 1 on account of the air<br>
movement. By means of the suction device 21, air is blown<br>
towards the metal strip 1 and led away laterally<br>
parallel, and counter, to the strip running direction 5.<br>
The velocity of the air and the distance b between plates<br>
22 and 23, which are arranged on the suction device 21,<br>
and the metal strip 1 are in such a relationship that the<br>
hydrodynamic paradox is in effect. This means that,<br>
although air is blown towards the metal strip 1, the<br>
metal strip 1 is attracted by the suction device 21<br>
because of the high air velocity.<br>
This principle also forms the basis of the<br>
configuration of a suction device 24 according to FIG 3,<br>
FIG 3 illustrating a particularly advantageous<br>
configuration of the basic principle described in FIG 2.<br>
By means of the suction device 24, air is blown towards<br>
the metal strip 1. The pressure of this air is so high<br>
that the flow velocity of the air allows the hydrodynamic<br>
paradox to take effect: the metal strip 1 is attracted by<br>
the suction device 24. In addition, provision may be made<br>
for a suction duct 25, by means of which air is addi-<br>
tionally taken in. The configuration according to PIG 3<br>
allows high flow velocities of the air between metal<br>
strip 1 and suction device 24, which in turn leads to the<br>
metal strip being attracted to a pronounced extent.<br>
FIG 4 shows a cross section through a metal strip<br>
1 and a plate 26. The plate 26 is a particularly advan-<br>
tageous configuration for the plates 9, 10, 22 and 23 and<br>
for that surface of the suction device 24 which faces the<br>
metal strip 1. Milled into the plate 26 are channels 27<br>
that extend in the direction in which the strip runs. The<br>
flow direction of the air under the metal strip 1 can be<br>
influenced in this way. In addition, provision may be<br>
made to control the flow velocity of the air in the<br>
channels 27 individually, and thus to define measurement<br>
zones which may be subjected to a specific force.<br>
In the case of hot-rolling stands, there is the<br>
possibility, instead of using air, of spraying a liquid<br>
(water, emulsion or the like) in a pulse manner at high<br>
pressure onto the material being rolled, in order to<br>
produce a periodic force in this way. This emulsion<br>
simultaneously effects cooling of the deflection sensors,<br>
which do not withstand the high temperatures during hot<br>
rolling (up to 1000°C) without cooling.<br>
As a result of various interfering influences<br>
during the deflection of the metal strip 1, the distance<br>
sensors 7 and 8 supply very noisy measurement signals.<br>
The measurement signals are therefore filtered. The<br>
signal filtering is advantageously effected by means of<br>
a digital fit algorithm or an FFT analysis. The metal<br>
strip 1 is deflected sinusoidally. The time profile of<br>
the measurement signal for each period is therefore<br>
ideally a sine wave. However, interference signals, in<br>
particular the resonant oscillations of the metal strip<br>
1, are superimposed on this sine-wave signal. After each<br>
complete period, therefore, a sine curve is fitted to the<br>
measurement signal (minimization of the squares of the<br>
errors): of the arrors Since the phase and frequency<br>
are known, the signal offset (basic distance between the<br>
sensors) and the amplitude are the only fit parameters.<br>
The amplitude value AF ascertained is then converted into<br>
the tensile stress.<br>
A further distinct improvement in the filtering<br>
is achieved by using two distance sensors 7 and 8 in<br>
accordance with the exemplary embodiment from FIG 1 and<br>
FIG 5 and evaluating the expression<br><br>
A" is a measure of the curvature of the metal strip 1 at<br>
the location where the force is introduced. The curvature<br>
is low for long-wave resonant oscillations. These are<br>
therefore effectively filtered out. The forced deflec-<br>
tion, on the other hand, produces a "kink" in the metal<br>
strip 1 at the location where force is introduced. In the<br>
expression A", therefore, the information content in<br>
relation to the metal-strip deflection that is forced by<br>
the suction device is considerably greater than in the<br>
measurement signals A1 and A2 which are supplied by the<br>
sensors 8 and 7.<br>
FIG 6 shows the arrangement of three distance<br>
sensors, which are designed in particular as rows of<br>
sensors. In this case, a third distance sensor 50 is<br>
provided to measure the distance A3.<br>
In the case of using three distance sensors, the<br>
value for A" is advantageously corrected in accordance<br>
with <br>
In this way, errors as a result of non-round rolls or<br>
sagging of a roll may be compensated for.<br>
By means of an FFT or a fit algorithm, an<br>
amplitude value A"F is formed from the values A", this<br>
amplitude value A"F corresponding in principle to the<br>
amplitude value Ap but being formed from the values A"<br>
rather than from direct measurement values.<br>
The amplitude distribution A"F(x) into a tensile<br>
stress distribution s(x) is effected in accordance with<br>
s(x) = C(x) F(x) [1/A"F(x) - 1/AO] (3).<br>
Here, x designates the location coordinate along the<br>
width of the metal strip 1.<br>
A"F(x) is the measured amplitude distribution of<br>
the deflection, which is calculated in accordance with<br>
Equation 1 or Equation 2 and by means of the digital fit<br>
algorithm. F(x) is the force distribution with which the<br>
metal strip 1 is deflected and has to be determined once<br>
experimentally. C (x) is a proportionality factor, which<br>
includes the elastic constants of the material of the<br>
metal strip 1. Because of the transverse contraction,<br>
given a homogeneous tensile stress distribution, the<br>
amplitude at the edge of the metal sheet is greater than<br>
in the centre. Therefore, C(x) is a function of x. C(x)<br>
can be determined from finite-element calculations.<br>
1/AO is a term that takes into account the<br>
flexural rigidity of the metal sheet. Ao is the amplitude<br>
that is measured when the tensile stress is zero. Because<br>
of the flexural rigidity of the metal strip 1, Ao is<br>
finite. For thin metal strips, that is for metal strips<br>
that are thinner than 1 mm, 1/AO can be set to be equal<br>
to zero.<br>
FIG 7 shows a curve 40, determined within the<br>
context of a finite-element simulation by means of the<br>
method according to the invention, for tensile stress s<br>
in N/mm2 in a metal strip, plotted against the position x<br>
in mm on the metal strip in the transverse direction, in<br>
comparison with a curve 41 for tensile stress a in N/mm2<br>
to which the metal strip is subjected. The curve illus-<br>
trates that, by means of the method according to the<br>
invention, it is possible to ascertain the tensile stress<br>
s in a metal strip particularly precisely.<br>
