				<td>A METHOD AND DEVICE FOR DISTRIBUTING HYDROKINETIC ENERGY IN<br>
LARGE VOLUMES OF FLUIDS<br>
The invention lies in the field of the cleaning of crude oil tanks and is concerned with a<br>
method and a device for the recovery of thickened, sedimented crude oil by way of liquefaction<br>
of the sediment with non-sedimented crude oil. The method is furthermore isuitable for mixing<br>
processes in fluids, for example in large to very large chemical reactors.<br>
In the field of the cleaning of crude oil tanks there are known various methods with<br>
which, by way of introducing crude oil which is located above the sediment and/or is freshly<br>
supplied, the sediment is successively suspended and is partly dissolved in the crude oil. Two<br>
groups of methods are at the forefront: method 1 which with rotating nozzles whirls up and<br>
suspends the sediment, for example disclosed in EP-0'160'805, and method 2 which with<br>
stationary nozzles cooperating as a group erode the sediment, whirl it up and suspend it, for<br>
example disclosed in EP-0'912'262.<br>
The invention relates to the method EP 0'912'262 mentioned under group 2. In this<br>
method, by way of a multitude of nozzles one forces a main flow direction which has the task of<br>
releasing and suspending the sediment in an eroding manner. Auxiliary arranged nozzles which<br>
are not orientated in the main flow direction effect additional shear surfaces by way of which the<br>
turbulence may be increased further. The invention also relates to the use of the method in<br>
chemical reactors, in large tanks and wherever large volumes need to be intimately mixed.<br>
Each immersed jet, due to the resistance in the medium in which it is immersed, produces<br>
turbulences and at the end of its range all the introduced energy is broken up into movement and<br>
turbulent flows. These turbulent flows from the point of view of a large volume are local, thus<br>
are small-scale. It is however indeed these small-scale turbulences which have a strong eroding<br>
effect and it is the object of the invention to produce a high number of small-scale turbulences as<br>
possible and to distribute these over a large volume. Large volumes are to be understood as ones<br>
for example of 8000 m3 on a surface of 2000 m2 and a height of 4 m, such as is the case with a<br>
storage tank of 50 m diameter and a fluid column of 3-4 m. Such volumes may also be weakly<br>
"decoupled" in part volumes via shear surfaces. The problem thus lies in the optimal distribution<br>
of the introduced energy over a desired volume.<br>
The hydrokinetic energy to be consumed for such large volumes lies in the order of<br>
several thousand horsepower. Roughly 30% is consumed by the pumps up to the nozzles, the<br>
rest, for example 2000 horsepower is introduced into the medium via the nozzles. In the example<br>
which is yet to be discussed more than 3000 nozzles are aligned to one another such that there<br>
arises a maximum of turbulence. The main flow functions as a transport mechanism for local<br><br>
turbulences which are thus distributed over the volume. The effect is a flowing swirling bed of<br>
high turbulence, thus chaos directed in a targeted manner.<br>
The subsequently cited figures underscore the discussion of one embodiment example of<br>
the method in two variations. Furthermore, a few embodiment examples of the device used for<br>
the method are shown.<br>
Figure 1	schematically shows a first arrangement for achieving a flowing field of<br>
turbulence.<br>
Figure 2	schematically shows a second arrangement for achieving a flowing field of<br>
turbulence.<br>
Figure 3	likewise schematically shows a flowing field of turbulence produced according to<br>
the arrangement according to the Figures 1 and 2, observed from the side, as well<br>
as an arrangement for recirculation of the medium for maintaining the mass in the<br>
volume into which the energy is introduced.<br>
Figure 4	shows the core piece of the device, a lance which here is shown schematically,<br>
with nozzles for the formation of the main flow and for forming local turbulences<br>
together with the other equally designed lances in an assembly for carrying out<br>
the method for distributing the turbulences.<br>
Figure 5	schematically shows in the form of pictograms some possible arrangements of the<br>
nozzles on the lances for producing a flowing field of turbulence.<br>
As already mentioned, it is primarily the case of the production of a multitude of local<br>
turbulences and of distributing these over a desired volume. An immersed jet is dependent on the<br>
pressure and on the through-flow quantity. Thus in water for example at a pressure behind the<br>
nozzles of approx. 2 bar and a nozzle cross section of approx. 20 mm2, a jet between 5-7 m is<br>
formed. The same is the case with a nozzle of 110 mm2. If one arranges the nozzle with the<br>
larger through-flow quantity in a first plane into a main flow direction to be achieved, for<br>
example 90 nozzles, and a further number of nozzles with a smaller through-flow quantity in a<br>
second plane, for example 180 nozzles additionally at an angle at for example 120° counter to<br>
the main flow direction, as is shown in Figure 1 and one directs a further 90 nozzles with any<br>
through-flow quantity in a third plane downwards transverse to the main flow direction, then<br>
firstly turbulences are formed locally in the field of influence of the nozzles, which are then<br>
transported away in the direction of the main flow.<br><br>
Figure 1 viewed from above onto a container shows an example of an assembly of a<br>
multitude of lances 5 arranged annularly in the container 10 of which each comprises 4 nozzles,<br>
specifically: 1 nozzle for the jet 1 with 200 mm2 in the main flow direction whose jet is drawn<br>
with a bold dash; 2 nozzles for the jet 2 with 110 mm2 at a 120 degree angle in its own plane<br>
obliquely to the rear whose jets 2 are drawn in as a thin dash; 1 nozzle for the jet 3 perpendicular<br>
to the plane of the paper which in the medium points in the z direction, here downwards, is not<br>
visible. The jets drawn out of the vessel edge 10 in operation of course hit the wall of the vessel<br>
and are reflected in a turbulent manner. In the figure the approximate length of the jets is<br>
essentially represented, in practise they may be 5 - 7 metres long. Next to the vessel in the figure<br>
there is shown a single lance 5 with three jets: 1 main jet and 2 auxiliary jets for an improved<br>
overview. In a later figure it is discussed how it is physically constructed.<br>
In order to achieve a main flow direction, as for example is shown here the lances are<br>
aligned such that the nozzle with the larger through-flow quantity points to the next lance, but all<br>
in the same orientation. Only the lances in the innermost circle are directed opposite one another<br>
in order to prevent a motionless zone in the eye of the flow. Since the radii of the circles become<br>
smaller from circle to circle the direction changes from the outside to the inside (but not the<br>
orientation). The figure then shows a well-covered field of immersed jets, wherein the main<br>
direction jet reaches downstream roughly to the next lance. The figure however also shows three<br>
hatched areas which are to represent all intermediate spaces between the jets. These areas<br>
represent a type of "backwater", thus somewhat quiet zones which measure roughly 9-15 m2.<br>
Over the whole area or over the whole volume this is roughly 80-90% of the volume which is not<br>
directly subjected to the turbulence. With a system with which the turbulences are not distributed<br>
an equilibrium would set in, thus a pattern of turbulent and non-turbulent zones. One then speaks<br>
of a static chaos. The flow which runs by way of the method according to the invention prevents<br>
such patterns. It carries the turbulences into the mentioned spaces or zones and past these beyond<br>
the next turbulence sources downstream into the next spaces until, with regard to these enormous<br>
volumes, there no longer exist any turbulent free space after a very short time. The directed<br>
transport of the turbulences is thus an essential procedure in order to permit the method to take<br>
its course in the specified enormous volumes in process times which are of commercial interest.<br>
The method displays an extraordinary rapidity. Within a short period of time one<br>
succeeds in introducing a large quantity of energy into the fluid volume. For example in<br>
recirculation within 24-30 hours one may introduce the energy quantity of 2000 horsepower<br>
hours (1472 kWh) into 7-10'000 tons of fluid, wherein it heats up after 20 to 30 hours. Such<br>
procedures of intimate thorough mixing are also desired in chemical processing technology,<br>
wherein one may lead off undesired heat by way of cooling. Larger chemical reactors may be<br>
operated with the help of this method with a very high thorough mixing effect, wherein the<br><br>
device which is yet to be discussed is moreover very easy to clean and in its handling is well<br>
adapted to the field of chemical processing technology.<br>
Figure 2 shows the same assembly as Figure 1 but in another form of orientation. With<br>
this orientation for achieving the main flow direction the nozzles of each lance are not aligned to<br>
the next one but to the next but one lance situated downstream. Compared to the arrangement in<br>
Figure 1 a stronger "crossing of jets" takes place without the overriding flow distributing the<br>
energy disappearing. The stagnant zones drawn in by way of hatching remain essentially equally<br>
large. It thus becomes clear that by way of merely aligning the lances these backwater-like<br>
regions may not be intensively processed. One thus needs to distribute a directed transport of the<br>
produced turbulences over the whole space to be processed.<br>
Figure 3 shows the effect of the immersed jets in a perpendicular section to the two<br>
Figures 1 and 2 discussed above, thus observed from the side. The most intensive local<br>
turbulence formation is effected at the shear surfaces of the opposed jet direction, here drawn in<br>
as an imagined shear surface 20. Although the immersed jet per se, or its energy finally also<br>
dissolves into turbulences due to the resistance of the surrounding medium, the turbulence<br>
formation at the macroscopic shear surfaces is considerably stronger. Figure 3 attempts to show<br>
this procedure by picture. The boldly drawn arrows 1 represent jets of a higher through-flow,<br>
thus of a larger mass movement, the more thinly drawn arrows 2 represent jets of a lower mass<br>
movement, for example only half that of the jets driving the overriding flow. The influence of the<br>
immersed jet on its surroundings is illustrated and represented schematically by the envelopes<br>
1*, 2* and 3* as diverging lines at each arrow. Most local turbulences 21 form at the shear<br>
surface drawn in with a dashed line 20, and here they are drawn more densely or closer to one<br>
another in order to illustrate this. The resulting superimposed flow is represented by flow arrows<br>
24 and by small arrows on the curls representing the turbulences and the compacting is thus<br>
represented with the arrows lying closer to one another, grouped with the bracket 25. The figure<br>
furthermore shows the axially directed flow exiting at the lower lance shank by arrow 3, whose<br>
envelopes 3* reflect on the bottom of the vessel and thus also contribute to the formation of<br>
eddies. A single jet without so to say being reinforced by the assembly in this manner would only<br>
be lost in the surrounding medium by which means its energy is constantly diluted without being<br>
able to be effective as a turbulence generator. This would not fulfil the purpose! of the invention.<br>
It is the targeted cooperation which produces the desired effect.<br>
It is men shown that the influence of the jet with the larger mass movement and the<br>
influence of the opposing jet with the low mass movement, for example half of this, in a limited<br>
space produces a strong shear on account of which local turbulences arise, that is to say local<br>
regions are formed which one may describe as turbulence generators, said turbulences being<br>
carried further with the flow effected by the jets with the larger mass movement and being<br><br>
distributed over regions in which no strong turbulences arise. In place of a nozzle with a larger<br>
cross section and more mass movement capability one may also use two or three nozzles with<br>
the same cross section as the nozzles effecting the opposing movement, for example 3x100 mm2<br>
in the main flow direction and 2x100 mm2 in the counter-flow direction. It is essential that a<br>
transport and thus a distribution of the locally produced turbulences is effected.<br>
Whilst with the figure it was mainly the formation of turbulence which was discussed,<br>
Figure 3 in a likewise schematic representation shows the recirculation of the material to be<br>
thoroughly mixed, hi a layer 30 above the zone in which the formation and distribution of the<br>
turbulence takes place, by way of a pump 31 via a suction union 32 one removes so much as is<br>
fed into the micro-swirl bed via feed conduits 33 or 33' and 33", by which means the demanded<br>
continuity or retention of the masses is fulfilled. The flow conditions is the upper-lying medium<br>
are much less intensive. Indeed according to the arrangement of the suction stations with regard<br>
to the flowing turbulent layer they effect a certain shielding of the main flow to the top. In other<br>
words, the effect propagated upwards by the fluid friction, specifically the joining of the flow<br>
direction, is disturbed or damped. The vertical effects are however further encouraged by the<br>
heating of the medium by way of the internal friction, by which means a convection upwards<br>
arises. On the whole all these phenomena contribute to the thorough mixing, but not as<br>
intensively as the formation of turbulence generators and the transport the local turbulences over<br>
the desired volume which is determined by the height and the arrangement of the nozzles in the<br>
medium.<br>
If it is merely the question of a thorough mixing of a fluid, then the suctioning for the<br>
recirculation may also be effected at locations close to or in the turbulence bed or micro-swirl<br>
bed. It is however to be noted that the suctioned turbulent medium has calmed down on the way<br>
to the pump.<br>
The device for carrying out the method consists of an assembly of a plurality of<br>
cooperating lances, thus of an arrangement effecting a flow system, and an example of such is<br>
shown in Figure 4, with nozzles of various through-flow quantities or also of the same through-<br>
flow quantities with correspondingly more nozzles which are orientated to one another according<br>
to the method. The nozzles may also have orientations which only effect a component opposed<br>
to or in the main direction. One recognises the lance shank of the lance 5 with a nozzle for the jet<br>
1 generating the main flow and the nozzles for the jets 2 forming opposing components with<br>
respect to the flow. At the lower end of the lance in Figure 5 there is arranged the nozzle for the<br>
fourth jet 3. A diffuser 9 is arranged at the upper end which here is drawn schematically as an<br>
elbow bend, and to this via a flange there is attached a feed flexible tubing 6 for the fluid as a<br>
hose connection. The lance is introduced through a casing 15 in the lid 11 of the container 10,<br><br>
which is shown in section, and is orientated to the multitude of other lances which are arranged<br>
in the same lid, and is fixed.<br>
Such lances are very efficient in manufacture, assembly and in operation. They are<br>
preferably hollow bodies without parts which move during operation, simple tubes with nozzles<br>
which at the one side are supplied with the medium and escape at the other side through the<br>
nozzles. A preferred embodiment form of the lance comprises a "neutral" nozzle arranged in its<br>
axis, a nozzle arranged transversely to the longitudinal axis of the lance for the main flow<br>
direction, thus a nozzle with a large cross section and two further nozzles at a distance to this<br>
towards the side of supply and transverse to the longitudinal axis of the lance, as Figure 4 shows,<br>
to the nozzle for the main flow direction, wherein the active cross section of both nozzles<br>
together is at least a third smaller than the cross section of the nozzle for the main flow direction.<br>
The main flow may also be accomplished with several nozzles. It is merely a question of the total<br>
cross section in the main direction being larger than in the opposing direction, which also<br>
concerns any direction component.<br>
Figure 5 in the form of 6 pictograms A, B, C, D, E, F shows some arrangements of<br>
nozzles on a lance, wherein the nozzles although being drawn next to one another are arranged in<br>
different planes or along the lance shank. The nozzles for the main flow direction or their active<br>
cross section in the picture are drawn upwards and indicated at H, the nozzles for the counter<br>
direction flow or their active cross section is indicated at G. Each of these planes (see also Figure<br>
4) may comprise one or more nozzles. Here merely the principle is shown.<br>
Pictogram A for example shows 3 nozzles each with 100 mm2 cross section and a nozzle<br>
in the counter direction with 100 mm2 for example arranged in the plane of the uppermost main<br>
flow direction nozzle. Pictogram B shows, similar to Figure 5 a total cross section in the main<br>
flow direction and 2/3 the total flow cross section in each case at a 120 degree angle which<br>
produces a component in the counter direction which is the same as with the pictogram A,<br>
wherein another turbulence formation arises. Pictogram C shows a ratio of 3:2, thus 2/3 of the<br>
effect in the counter direction. Pictogram D shows a variant in which purely numerically no<br>
essentially larger flow is to arise in the main flow direction, but despite this there forms a slight<br>
flow opposed to the counter flow. Pictogram E shows the same, wherein it is clear that these two<br>
variants are not very process-intensive. Pictogram F for the sake of completeness and as<br>
discussed initially shows that instead of 2 or 3 nozzles each with a cross section of for example<br>
100 mm2 in the main flow direction one may use a nozzle with 200 mm2 or even 300 mm2. This<br>
is important inasmuch as larger mass flows as a rule display a larger effect. Thus in each case<br>
one needs to weigh up whether more individual jets with a smaller mass flow, thus a smaller<br>
cross section, or less individual jets with a larger cross section are to be applied.<br><br>
This method and the device may thus be used for processes which require an intimate<br>
thorough mixing of large volumes. These may, as initially cited be crude oil tanks of any size,<br>
thus up to 100 m diameter or more or chemical reactors of a few metres diameter of large mixing<br>
tanks or likewise. With reactors the lid would comprise a suitable quantity of injectors which are<br>
dimensioned and orientated to one another according to the invention, which may be easily<br>
exchanged and may be well cleaned. The cleaning of the injectors is no problem since it is<br>
essentially the case of tubes. In applications where contamination is significant such an injector<br>
may be designed in a manner such that where possible it has no undercuts in which substances<br>
may settle. The cleaning procedure should allow the substances of the previous processing to be<br>
completely washed away by way of the through-flow in the injector and the intensive mixing.<br><br>

nozzles with different cross sections that are arranged such that the nozzle with<br>
the largest cross section points in one direction, and the other nozzles point in<br>
another direction.<br>
13.	A tubular body for use in the device according to claim 10, comprising the<br>
nozzles and wherein the nozzles all have a same cross section and are arranged<br>
such that at least two nozzles point in one common direction and two nozzles<br>
point in other directions, these two nozzles pointing in other directions having an<br>
angle of 120° in between their directions, wherein the at least two nozzles<br>
pointing in one common direction have a larger summed cross section than the<br>
effective cross section of the two nozzles pointing in other directions.<br>
14.	A tubular body for use in the device as claimed in claim 10, comprising the<br>
nozzles and wherein the nozzles all have a same cross section and are arranged<br>
such that at least one nozzle points in one direction and at least two nozzles<br><br>
point in other directions, wherein the two nozzles that point in other directions<br>
have an angle of 120° in between their directions and have a larger common<br>
effective cross section than the cross section of the one nozzle pointing in one<br>
direction.<br>
15.	The use of the method as claimed in any one of claims 1-8 for the<br>
thorough mixing and/or cleaning of storage tanks.<br>
16.	The use of the method as claimed in any one of claims 1-8 for liquefying<br>
sediments in crude oil tanks.<br>
17.	The use of the method as claimed in any one of claims 1-8 for the<br>
intensive mixing of fluid components in mixing containers.<br>
18.	The use of the method as claimed in any one of claims 1-8 for the<br>
intensive mixing processing of a fluid material in chemical reactors.<br><br>
According to the invention, every immersed Jet (1,2) provokes turbulences (21) as a<br>
result of resistance in the medium in which it is submerged. All the energy applied is<br>
distributed in turbulent flows at the end of its working range. These turbulent flows<br>
are generally local, that is small scale. Yet these small scale turbulences have a<br>
strong eroding effect. The invention aims at producing the highest possible amount<br>
of small scale turbulences and at distributing said turbulences over a large volume,<br>
large meaning, for example, 3000-4000 m3 on a surface of 2000m2 and a height of 2<br>
m, as is the case, for instance of a storage tank (10) with a 50 m diameter and a<br>
liquid column of 3 m. The problem then lies in the optimal distribution of the energy<br>
applied.</td>
