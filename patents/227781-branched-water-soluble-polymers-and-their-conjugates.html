Application No.60/454,993, filed March 14, 2003, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No.<br>
60/474,094, filed May 29,2003, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/509,752,<br>
filed October 7, 2003, the contents of each which are incorporated herein by reference in the<br>

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to branched water-soluble polymers and conjugates<br>
formed from these branched polymers.<br>
Introduction<br>
[0003] The conjugation of the hydrophilic polymers, such as poly(ethylene glycol),<br>
abbreviated PEG, also known as poly(ethylene oxide), abbreviated PEO, to molecules and<br>
surfaces is of considerable utility in biotechnology and medicine. In its most common form,<br>
PEG is a linear polymer terminated at each end with hydroxyl groups:<br>
HO-CH2CH20-(CH2CH2O)n-CH2CH2-OH<br>
where n typically ranges from about 3 to about 4000. Many end-functionalized derivatives<br>
are known in the literature and commercially available. See, for example, Shearwater<br>
Polymers, Inc. Catalog "Polyethylene Glycol Derivatives."<br>
[0004] PEG species with a different group at each of the two termini are particularly useful<br>
compounds. For example, heterobifunctional PEGs are of use as cross-linking agents.<br>
Moreover, PEG molecules that are "capped" at one terminus, e.g., an alkyl group, such as<br>
methoxy allow the hydroxyl terminus of the molecule to be converted into any one of a large<br>
number of reactive organic functional groups.<br><br>
[0005] Random or block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, shown below,<br>
are closely related to PEG in their chemistry, and they can be substituted for PEG in many of<br>
its applications.<br>
HO-CH2CHRO(CH2CHRO)nCH2CHR-OH<br>
in which each R is independently H or CH3.<br>
[0006] The formation of conjugates between therapeutically active species and water-<br>
soluble polymers has proven a productive strategy for improving the pharmacokinetics and<br>
pharmacodynamics of therapeutic agents. See, for example, Dunn and Ottenbrite, "Polymeric<br>
Drugs and Drug Delivery Systems:" ACS Symposium Series 469, American Chemical<br>
Society, Washington, D.C. 1991. For example, the use of PEG to derivatize peptide<br>
therapeutics has been demonstrated to reduce the immunogenicity of the peptides and prolong<br>
the clearance time from the circulation. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,179,337 (Davis et al.)<br>
concerns non-immunogenic peptides, such as enzymes and peptide hormones coupled to<br>
polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polypropylene glycol. Between 10 and 100 moles of polymer<br>
are used per mole peptide and at least 15% of the physiological activity is maintained.<br>
[0007] Many other examples of PEG-peptide conjugates are known in the art. The<br>
principal mode of attachment of PEG, and its derivatives, to peptides is a non-specific<br>
bonding through a peptide amino acid residue. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,088,538<br>
discloses an enzymatically active polymer-enzyme conjugate of an enzyme covalently bound<br>
to PEG. Similarly, U.S. Patent No. 4,496,689 discloses a covalently attached complex of a-1<br>
protease inhibitor with a polymer such as PEG or methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) ("niPEG").<br>
Abuchowski et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 252: 3578 (1977) discloses the covalent attachment of<br>
mPEG to an amine group of bovine serum albumin. WO 93/15189 (Veronese et al.)<br>
concerns a method to maintain the activity of polyethylene glycol-modified proteolytic<br>
enzymes by linking the proteolytic enzyme to a macromolecularized inhibitor. The<br>
conjugates are intended for medical applications. U.S. Patent No. 4,414,147 discloses a<br>
method of rendering interferon less hydrophobic by conjugating it to an anhydride of a<br>
dicarboxylic acid, such as poly(ethylene succinic anhydride). PCT WO 87/00056 discloses<br>
conjugation of PEG and poly(oxyethylated) polyols to such proteins as interferon-,<br>
interleukin-2 and immunotoxins. EP 154,316 discloses and claims chemically modified<br>
lymphokines, such as IL-2 containing PEG bonded directly to at least one primary amino<br>
group of the Iymphokine. U.S. Patent No. 4,055,635 discloses pharmaceutical compositions<br><br>
of a water-soluble complex of a proteolytic enzyme linked covalently to a polymeric<br>
substance such as a polysaccharide.<br>
[0008] Another mode of attaching PEG to peptides is through the non-specific oxidation of<br>
glycosyl residues on a peptide. The oxidized sugar is utilized as a locus for attaching a PEG<br>
moiety to the peptide. For example M'Timkulu (WO 94/05332) discloses the use of a<br>
hydrazine- or amino-PEG to add PEG to a glycoprotein. The glycosyl moieties are randomly<br>
oxidized to the corresponding aldehydes, which are subsequently coupled to the amino-PEG.<br>
[0009] In each of the methods described above, poly(ethyleneglycol) is added in a random,<br>
non-specific manner to reactive residues on a peptide backbone. Frequently, derivatization<br>
with PEG results in a loss of peptide activity that is directly attributable to the non-selective<br>
nature of the chemistries utilized to conjugate the water-soluble polymer.<br>
[0010] Another difficulty associated with forming conjugates between water-soluble<br>
polymers and biomolecules is the ability of the reactive water-soluble polymer reagent to<br>
label the biomolecule at more than one site. Though it is often desirable to include more than<br>
one water-soluble polymer moiety per conjugate, the degree of diminution of biomolecule<br>
activity is often proportional to the number of polymer moieties bound to the biomolecule.<br>
Accordingly, there is interest in obtaining reactive, branched species that include two or more<br>
water-soluble polymer moieties per molecule. Through the use of branched molecules, more<br>
than one water-soluble polymer can be conjugated to a biomolecule without the necessity of<br>
interfering with more than one site on the biomolecule.<br>
[0011 ] Branched polymers based upon poly(ethyIene glycol) are known in the art. For<br>
example, Greenwald et al. (WO 98/41562) disclose a branched PEG that is based on a 1,3-<br>
diamino-2-propanol core. Morpurgo and co-workers discuss the use of branched PEG based<br>
on a lysine core is discussed in Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 56: 59-72 (1996). A similar<br>
lysine-based branched PEG was prepared by Guiotto et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett 12: 177-<br>
180 (2002). Harris et al. (U.S. Patent No. 5,932,462) also prepared a branched PEG that is<br>
based upon lysine. Martinez et al. (U.S. Patent No. 5,643,575) describe a number of<br>
branched PEG species that are based upon various core structures and the conjugation of<br>
these species with a biologically active material (U.S. Patent No. 6,113,906).<br>
[0012] Polymers, such as poly(ethylene glycol) are known to exist as heterodisperse<br>
populations, which include a range of polymer chain lengths and molecular weights. When<br>
preparing therapeutic formulations, it is clearly desirable to utilize polymers with minimal<br><br>
heterodispersity to ensure consistency and reproducibility between preparations. Few<br>
methods of preparing mono-disperse PEG samples are known in the art. Loiseau et al. have<br>
published a synthesis of well-defined PEG molecules. The method utilizes a<br>
protection/deprotection strategy that is less than optimal for the preparation of large<br>
quantitities of substantially mono-disperse PEGs. Thus, in addition to branched<br>
poly(ethylene glycol) polymers, a method for preparing mono-disperse PEG and<br>
incorporating the mono-disperse material into the branched polymers would be highly<br>
desirable.<br>
[0013] The present invention answers the need for both branched water-soluble polymers<br>
and mono-disperse PEG species, opening a route to new therapeutic conjugates, e.g., peptide<br>
conjugates, and addressing the need for more stable and therapeutically effective therapeutic<br>
species. There remains still a need for an industrially practical method for the modification<br>
of therapeutic biomolecules with modifying groups such as water-soluble polymers. Of<br>
particular interest are methods in which the conjugate has improved properties relative to the<br>
unmodified therapeutic agent. The present invention fulfills these and other needs.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0014] The present invention provides branched water-soluble polymers that are based on<br>
cores of diverse structure. The branched polymers of the invention provide a means to attach<br>
two or more water-soluble polymer moieties to another species through a single locus of<br>
attachment. The invention is illustrated by reference to branched PEG molecules. The focus<br>
on PEG as a representative water-soluble polymer is for clarity of illustration and should not<br>
be interpreted to limit the invention. Those of skill will appreciate that the branched species<br>
described herein can be prepared with essentially any water-soluble polymer. In addition to<br>
PEG, other exemplary water-soluble polymer include poly(propylene glycol).<br>
[0015] In a first aspect, the invention provides a branched water-soluble polymer having<br>
the formula:<br>
WSP—Y—Rx<br>
in which WSP is a water-soluble polymer. The symbol Y represents a linker, e.g., a bond, or<br>
a moiety comprising an amide, carboxylic acid ester, urethane, mercaptan, substituted or<br>
unsubstituted alkyl, and the like. Exemplary linkers include: a bond, (CH2)n,<br>
(CH2)mC(O)O(CH2)n, (CH2)mC(0)NH(CH2)n, (CH2)mOC(O)NH(CH2)n, (CH2)mO(CH2)n,<br><br>
(CH2)mNH(CH2)n and (CH2)mS(CH2)n in which m and n are integers independently selected<br>
from 0 to 6. Rx is a water-soluble polymer, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl moiety linked<br>
to a water-soluble polymer; an amino acid or dimer of an amino acid linked to a water-<br>
soluble polymer; or a sugar or a sugar nucleotide linked to a water-soluble polymer. WSP<br>
and the water-soluble polymer component of Rx may be the same water-soluble polymer or<br>
different water-soluble polymers.<br>
[0016] Exemplary water-soluble polymers of use in the compounds of the invention include<br>
m-PEG, PEG, m-PPG, PPG, polysialic acid, polyglutamate, polyaspartate, polylysine,<br>
polyethyeleneimine, biodegradable polymers (e.g., polylactide, polyglyceride), and<br>
functionalized PEG, e.g., terminal- functionized PEG.<br>
[0017] In an exemplary embodiment, Y is substituted alkyl and the invention provides a<br>
branched water-soluble polymer having the formula:<br><br>
in which X and Y are members independently selected from OR1, NR2R3, SR4, COOR5,<br>
CONR6R7, OCONR6R7, substituted and unsubstituted alkyl, and substituted and unsubstituted<br>
aryl. Z1 is a member selected from OR1', NR2R3', SR4', COOR5', CONR6R7, substituted and<br>
unsubstituted alkyl, and substituted and unsubstituted aryl. The symbols R1, R4, and R5<br>
represent a water-soluble polymer. R2, R3, R6, and R7 are members independently selected<br>
from H, substituted and unsubstituted alkyl, substituted and unsubstituted aryl, substituted<br>
and unsubstituted heteroaryl, substituted and unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, a reactive<br>
functional group, and a water-soluble polymer with the proviso that these groups are selected<br>
such that the compound according to Formula I includes at least two water-soluble polymer<br>
moieties. The symbols R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, and R7 represent groups that are<br>
independently selected from H, substituted and unsubstituted alkyl, substituted and<br>
unsubstituted aryl, substituted and unsubstituted heteroaryl, substituted and unsubstituted<br>
heterocycloalkyl, a reactive functional group, a carrier molecule, and a water-soluble<br>
polymer.<br>
[0018] In another exemplary embodiment, Z1 comprises a saccharyl moiety. The saccharyl<br>
moiety can be an activated saccharyl moiety, e.g., a nucleotide sugar. Still further, Z1 can<br><br>
comprise a saccharyl moiety that is directly bound to an amino acid of a peptide, or indirectly<br>
bound to an amino acid of a peptide by its conjugation to a glycosyl residue attached to the<br>
amino acid.<br>
[0019] The invention also provides a branched polymer that is based on an amino acid or<br>
oligo-amino acid (e.g., di-, tri-, tetra-peptide). Exemplary amino acid-based branched<br>
polymers have a formula selected from:<br><br>
wherein R11, R11', R12, R12', R13 and R13' are independently selected from H, substituted or<br>
unsubstituted alkyl and water-soluble polymers, with the proviso that these groups are<br>
selected such that the compound set forth above includes at least two water-soluble polymer<br>
moieties. R14 is a member selected from OH, reactive functional groups, a group comprising<br>
a saccharide moiety or a group that is linked to a carrier molecule. A is a member selected<br>
from NH, O and S. The index "s" represents and integer from 1 to 5.<br>
[0020] Each of the compounds set forth in the formulae above are of use for the chemical<br>
PEGylation of another species (e.g., nucleic acid, peptide, saccharide, etc.). Methods of<br>
forming conjugates between PEG (and species containing PEG) are generally known in the<br>
art. See, for example, Hermanson, BIOCONJUGATE TECHNIQUES, Academic Press, San Diego,<br>
1996; and Feeney et al, MODIFICATION OF PROTEINS; Advances in Chemistry Series, Vol.<br>
198, American Chemical Society, Washington, D.C., 1982.<br>
[0021] In another exemplary embodiment, R14 comprises a saccharyl moiety. The<br>
saccharyl moiety can be an activated saccharyl moiety, e.g., a nucleotide sugar. Still further,<br>
R14 can comprise a saccharyl moiety that is directly bound to an amino acid of a peptide, or<br>
indirectly bound to an amino acid of a peptide by its conjugation to a glycosyl residue<br>
attached to the amino acid.<br><br>
[0022] In yet another aspect, the invention provides a branched water-soluble polymer that<br>
is based upon a saccharide nucleus ("branch core"). Those of skill will appreciate that the<br>
saccharide nucleus can be of any structure. Exemplary saccharides of use in this aspect of the<br>
invention include GlcNAc, Gal, Sia, Fuc, Glc, GalNAc, GalNH2, GlcNH2 and the like.<br>
[0023] An exemplary compound of the invention has the formula:<br>
Sugar-0—(L—WSP)2<br>
in which L is a linker and WSP is a water-soluble polymer.<br>
[0024] In another exemplary embodiment, the saccharide-based branched water-soluble<br>
polymer of the invention has the formula:<br>
Nucleotide-Sugar-0—(L-WSP)2<br><br>
in which R16 and R16 are members selected from H, acetyl, and:<br><br>
[0025] A further exemplary compound according to this aspect of the invention, which is<br>
based upon a sialic acid nucleus has the formula:<br>
and R7,R8,R9and R19' are members independently selected from H, OH, NH2, NHAc and<br>
the moiety according to Formula I. In Formula I, Z is a member selected from O, S, CH2<br>
and S. R11 is as described above, and the index "a" represents an integer from 0 to 20, with<br>
the proviso that at least two of R16, R16, R17, R18 and R19 have a structure according to<br>
Formula I. Rl1 can also be a group linked to a carrier molecule or a bond to a carrier<br>
molecule. R15 is a member selected from H and activating groups, e.g., a nucleotide<br>
phosphate.<br><br>
[0026] In another aspect, the branched polymer is based upon galactose or N-acetyl<br>
galactose and it has the formula:<br><br>
wherein R15-R19 are as described above and at least two of R15-R19 are a moiety according to<br>
Formula I.<br>
[0027] Other exemplary sugar-derived structures having a formula such as that above are<br>
mannose and glucose-based branched water-soluble polymers.<br>
[0028] Still further, R15 can comprise a bond to an amino acid of a peptide or to a glycosyl<br>
moiety that is directly bound to an amino acid of a peptide, or indirectly bound to an amino<br>
acid of a peptide by its conjugation to a glycosyl residue attached to the amino acid.<br>
[0029] The invention also provides a method of preparing an essentially mono-disperse<br>
population of poly(ethylene glycol) molecules. The method includes contacting a PEG<br>
molecule with a well-defined molecular weight, e.g., PEG200 with at least two equivalents of<br>
a bifunctional activated PEG that also has a well-defined molecular weight, e.g., PEG200,<br>
thereby producing a mono-disperse sample of a PEG, e.g., PEG600:<br><br>
G is a leaving group, such as a sulfonate or tresylate ester. The mono-disperse sample of<br>
PEG600 can then be contacted with the bifunctional activated PEG200 to form a mono-<br>
disperse PEG100. Alternatively, the mono-disperse PEG600 can be converted to the<br>
corresponding bifunctional derivative and reacted with at least two equivalents of a mono-<br>
disperse di-hydroxy-PEG600, producing a mono-disperse PEG 1800. The process of the<br>
invention is repeated until a mono-disperse PEG of the desired size is obtained. The<br><br>
synthesis can be designed such that the molecular weight differences between the starting<br>
material and the product allow for the separation of any unreacted or partially reacted<br>
materials by size exclusion chromatography.<br>
[0030] Moreover, in response to the need for improved methods of preparing modified<br>
water-soluble polymers, such as poly(ethylene glycol), the present invention provides<br>
methods for the chemical activation and elongation of the polymer backbone. The mono-<br>
activated PEG molecules are of use to conjugate PEG to a wide variety of species, e.g,<br>
targeting moieties, therapeutic moieties, anti-tumor drugs, cytotoxins, radioactive agents,<br>
amino acids, saccharides and the like.<br>
[0031] Thus, in another aspect, the present invention provides a method for the step-wise<br>
assembly of activated water-soluble polymers, particularly poly(ethylene glycol) and its<br>
structural analogues. The method provides easy access to both mono- and bi-functionalized<br>
PEG molecules.<br>
[0032] Thus, in an exemplary embodiment, the invention provides a method of preparing a<br>
derivative of poly(ethylene glycol). The method is outlined below:<br><br>
a. R-Y / (acid or base); b. Activation, e.g., tosylation, halo-de-<br>
hydroxylation, e.g, HX or SOX2 and reaction with PEGm; c.<br>
Activation (R1), e.g., with p-nitro-phenylohloroformate.<br>
in which the indexes m and n independently represent integers from 1 to 100,000.<br>
[0033] In step a, the starting glycol is contacted with an activated group (R-Y) that reacts<br>
with a hydroxyl moiety of the glycol. Y is generally a leaving group, allowing placement of<br>
R on one of the hydroxyl moieties of the PEG molecule. In step b, the free hydroxyl of the<br>
resulting adduct is activated by its conversion to a group such as a sulfonate ester. The<br>
activated PEG species is contacted with another PEG moiety of the same or different degree<br>
of polymerization as the starting PEG ("PEGm"). To allow its attachment to another species,<br>
the RO-PEG(n+m) is optionally activated at the free hydroxyl moiety.<br><br>
[0034] The compounds of the invention are of use in forming water-soluble polymer<br>
conjugates of a substrate, such as a therapeutic agent, e.g., peptides, lipids, glycolipids,<br>
through direct chemical PEGylation of one or more available reactive residue on the<br>
therapeutic agent. The compounds of the invention are also readily incorporated into<br>
activated sugar conjugates that can be utilized in enzymatically-mediated glyco-PEGylation<br>
of a substrate, e.g., a therapeutic agent.<br>
[0035] The invention also provides pharmaceutical formulations of therapeutic agents to<br>
which are conjugated one or more branched water-soluble polymer of the invention. Also<br>
provided are methods of treating diseases that are ameliorated or cured by administration of a<br>
conjugate between a therapeutic agent and a branched water-soluble polymer of the<br>
invention.<br>

conjugation of a modified sugar species to an amino acid or glycosyl residue of a peptide. A<br>
subgenus of "glycoconjugation" is "glyco-PEG-ylation," in winch the modifying group of the<br>
modified sugar is poly(ethylene glycol), and alkyl derivative (e.g., m-PEG) or reactive<br>
derivative (e.g., H2N-PEG, HOOC-PEG) thereof.<br>
[0040] The term "sialic acid" refers to any member of a family of nine-carbon carboxylated<br>
sugars. The most common member of the sialic acid family is N-acetyl-neuraminic acid (2-<br>
keto-5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-D-glycero-D-galactononulopyranos-1 -onic acid (often<br>
abbreviated as Neu5Ac, NeuAc, or NANA). A second member of the family is N-glycolyl-<br>
neuraminic acid (Neu5Gc or NeuGc), in which the N-acetyl group of NeuAc is hydroxylated.<br>
A third sialic acid family member is 2-keto-3-deoxy-nonulosonic acid (KDN) (Nadano et al.<br>
(1986) J. Biol Chan. 261:11550-11557; Kanamori et al., J. Biol. Client. 265: 21811-21819<br>
(1990)). Also included are 9-substituted sialic acids such as a 9-0-C1-C6acyl-Neu5Ac like<br>
9-0-lactyl-Neu5Ac or 9-0-acetyl-Neu5Ac, 9-deoxy-9-fluoro-Neu5Ac and 9-azido-9-deoxy-<br>
Neu5Ac. For review of the sialic acid family, see, e.g., Varki, Glycobiology 2: 25-40 (1992);<br>
Sialic Acids: Chemistry, Metabolism and Function, R. Schauer, Ed. (Springer-Verlag, New<br>
York (1992)). The synthesis and use of sialic acid compounds in a sialylation procedure is<br>
disclosed in international application WO 92/16640, published October 1, 1992.<br>
[0041] "Peptide" refers to a polymer in which the monomers are amino acids and are joined<br>
together through amide bonds, alternatively referred to as a polypeptide. Additionally,<br>
unnatural amino acids, for example, P-alanine, phenylglycine and homoarginine are also<br>
included. Amino acids that are not gene-encoded may also be used in the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, amino acids that have been modified to include reactive groups, glycosylation<br>
sites, polymers, therapeutic moieties, biomolecules and the like may also be used in the<br>
invention. All of the amino acids used in the present invention may be either the D - or L -<br>
isomer. The L -isomer is generally preferred. In addition, other peptidomimetics are also<br>
useful in the present invention. As used herein, "peptide" refers to both glycosylated and<br>
unglycosylated peptides. Also included are petides that are incompletely glycosylated by a<br><br>
system that expresses the peptide. For a general review, see, Spatola, A. F., in CHEMISTRY<br>
AND BIOCHEMISTRY OF AMINO ACIDS, PEPTIDES AND PROTEINS, B. Weinstein, eds., Marcel<br>
Dekker, New York, p. 267 (1983).<br>
[0042] The term "peptide conjugate," refers to species of the invention in which a peptide<br>
is glycoconjugated with a modified sugar as set forth herein. In a representative example, the<br>
peptide is a mutant peptide having an O-linked glycosylation site not present in the wild-type<br>
peptide.<br>
[0043] The term "amino acid" refers to naturally occurring and synthetic amino acids, as<br>
well as amino acid analogs and amino acid mimetics that function in a manner similar to the<br>
naturally occurring amino acids. Naturally occurring amino acids are those encoded by the<br>
genetic code, as well as those amino acids that are later modified, e.g., hydroxyproline, -<br>
carboxyglutamate, and O-phosphoserine. Amino acid analogs refers to compounds that have<br>
the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid, i.e., and carbon that is<br>
bound to a hydrogen, a carboxyl group, an amino group, and an R group, e.g., homoserine,<br>
norleucine, methionine sulfoxide, methionine methyl sulfonium. Such analogs have modified<br>
R groups (e.g., norleucine) or modified peptide backbones, but retain the same basic chemical<br>
structure as a naturally occurring amino acid. Amino acid mimetics refers to chemical<br>
compounds that have a structure that is different from the general chemical structure of an<br>
amino acid, but that function in a manner similar to a naturally occurring amino acid.<br>
[0044] As used herein, the term "modified sugar," refers to a naturally- or non-naturally-<br>
occurring carbohydrate, modified with a branched water-soluble polymer of the invention,<br>
that can be enzymatically added onto an amino acid or a glycosyl residue of a peptide, lipid,<br>
glycolipid and the like. The modified sugar is selected from a number of enzyme substrates<br>
including, but not limited to sugar nucleotides (mono-, di-, and tri-phosphates), activated<br>
sugars (e.g., glycosyl halides, glycosyl mesylates) and sugars that are neither activated nor<br>
nucleotides. The "modified sugar" is covalently functionalized with a "modifying group,"<br>
which is a branched polymer of the invention. The locus of functionalization with the<br>
modifying group is selected such that it does not prevent the "modified sugar" from being<br>
added enzymatically to a peptide or other substrate.<br>
[0045] The term "water-soluble" refers to moieties that have some detectable degree of<br>
solubility in water. Methods to detect and/or quantify water solubility are well known in the<br>
art. Exemplary water-soluble polymers include peptides, saccharides, poly(ethers),<br><br>
poly(amines), poly(carboxylic acids) and the like. Peptides can have mixed sequences of be<br>
composed of a single amino acid, e.g., poly(lysine). An exemplary polysaccharide is<br>
poly(sialic acid). An exemplary poly(ether) is poIy(ethy!ene glycol), e.g., m-PEG.<br>
Poly(ethylene imine) is an exemplary polyamine, and poly(acrylic) acid is a representative<br>
poly(carboxylic acid).<br>
[0046] The terms "poly(ethylene glycol)", "PEG", "polypropylene glycol)" and "PPG" are<br>
used in their generic sense and they also encompass derivatives of the parent compounds,<br>
e.g., mono-alkyl species, e.g., m-PEG, m-PPG, reactive species, N-hydroxysuccinimide, p-<br>
nitrophenylcarbonate (p-NP), HOBT derivatives, and amines. Also included within these<br>
terms are species that include two or more modifications, e.g., p-NP-PEG-OMe, and the like.<br>
[0047] The term, "glycosyl linking group," as used herein refers to a glycosyl residue to<br>
which an agent {e.g., water-soluble polymer, therapeutic moiety, biomolecule) is covalently<br>
attached. In the methods of the invention, the "glycosyl linking group" becomes covalently<br>
attached to a glycosylated or unglycosylated peptide, thereby linking the agent to an amino<br>
acid and/or glycosyl residue on the peptide. A "glycosyl linking group" is generally derived<br>
from a "modified sugar" by the enzymatic attachment of the "modified sugar" to an amino<br>
acid and/or glycosyl residue of the peptide. An "intact glycosyl linking group" refers to a<br>
linking group that is derived from a glycosyl moiety in which the individual saccharide<br>
monomer that links the conjugate is not degraded, e.g., oxidized, e.g., by sodium<br>
metaperiodate. "Intact glycosyl linking groups" of the invention may be derived from a<br>
naturally occurring oligosaccharide by addition of glycosyl unit(s) or removal of one or more<br>
glycosyl unit from a parent saccharide structure.<br>
[0048] As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" includes any material, which<br>
when combined with the conjugate retains the conjugates' activity and is non-reactive with<br>
the subject's immune systems. Examples include, but are not limited to, any of the standard<br>
pharmaceutical carriers such as a phosphate buffered saline solution, water, emulsions such<br>
as oil/water emulsion, and various types of wetting agents. Other carriers may also include<br>
sterile solutions, tablets including coated tablets and capsules. Typically such carriers contain<br>
excipients such as starch, milk, sugar, certain types of clay, gelatin, stearic acid or salts<br>
thereof, magnesium or calcium stearate, talc, vegetable fats or oils, gums, glycols, or other<br>
known excipients. Such carriers may also include flavor and color additives or other<br><br>
ingredients. Compositions comprising such carriers are formulated by well known<br>
conventional methods.<br>
[0049] As used herein, "administering" means oral administration, administration as a<br>
suppository, topical contact, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intralesional, or<br>
subcutaneous administration, administration by inhalation, or the implantation of a slow-<br>
release device, e.g., a mini-osmotic pump, to the subject. Adminsitration is by any route<br>
including parenteral and transmucosal (e.g., oral, nasal, vaginal, rectal, or transdermal),<br>
particularly by inhalation. Parenteral administration includes, e.g., intravenous,<br>
intramuscular, intra-arteriole, intradermal, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intraventricular, and<br>
intracranial. Moreover, where injection is to treat a tumor, e.g., induce apoptosis,<br>
administration may be directly to the tumor and/or into tissues surrounding the tumor. Other<br>
modes of delivery include, but are not limited to, the use of liposomal formulations,<br>
intravenous infusion, transdermal patches, etc.<br>
[0050] The term "isolated" refers to a material that is substantially or essentially free from<br>
components, which are used to produce the material. For peptide conjugates of the invention,<br>
the term "isolated" refers to material that is substantially or essentially free from components,<br>
which normally accompany the material in the mixture used to prepare the peptide conjugate.<br>
"Isolated" and "pure" are used interchangeably. Typically, isolated peptide conjugates of the<br>
invention have a level of purity preferably expressed as a range. The lower end of the range<br>
of purity for the peptide conjugates is about 60%, about 70% or about 80% and the upper end<br>
of the range of purity is about 70%, about 80%, about 90% or more than about 90%.<br>
[0051] When the peptide conjugates are more than about 90% pure, their purities are also<br>
preferably expressed as a range. The lower end of the range of purity is about 90%, about<br>
92%, about 94%, about 96% or about 98%. The upper end of the range of purity is about<br>
92%, about 94%, about 96%, about 98% or about 100% purity.<br>
[0052] Purity is determined by any art-recognized method of analysis (e.g., band intensity<br>
on a silver stained gel, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, HPLC, or a similar means).<br>
[0053] "Essentially each member of the population," as used herein, describes a<br>
characteristic of a population of peptide conjugates of the invention in which a selected<br>
percentage of the modified sugars added to a peptide are added to multiple, identical acceptor<br>
sites on the peptide. "Essentially each member of the population" speaks to the<br>
"homogeneity" of the sites on the peptide conjugated to a modified sugar and refers to<br><br>
conjugates of the invention, which are at least about 80%, preferably at least about 90% and<br>
more preferably at least about 95% homogenous.<br>
[0054] "Homogeneity," refers to the structural consistency across a population of acceptor<br>
moieties to which the modified sugars are conjugated. Thus, in a peptide conjugate of the<br>
invention in which each modified sugar moiety is conjugated to an acceptor site having the<br>
same structure as the acceptor site to which every other modified sugar is conjugated, the<br>
peptide conjugate is said to be about 100% homogeneous. Homogeneity is typically<br>
expressed as a range. The lower end of the range of homogeneity for the peptide conjugates<br>
is about 60%, about 70% or about 80% and the upper end of the range of purity is about 70%,<br>
about 80%, about 90% or more than about 90%.<br>
[0055] When the peptide conjugates are more than or equal to about 90% homogeneous,<br>
their homogeneity is also preferably expressed as a range. The lower end of the range of<br>
homogeneity is about 90%, about 92%, about 94%, about 96% or about 98%. The upper end<br>
of the range of purity is about 92%, about 94%, about 96%, about 98% or about 100%<br>
homogeneity. The purity of the peptide conjugates is typically determined by one or more<br>
methods known to those of skill in the art, e.g., liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry<br>
(LC-MS), matrix assisted laser desorption mass time of flight spectrometry (MALDITOF),<br>
capillary electrophoresis, and the like.<br>
[0056] "Substantially uniform glycoform" or a "substantially uniform glycosylation<br>
pattern," when referring to a glycopeptide species, refers to the percentage of acceptor<br>
moieties that are glycosylated by the glycosyltransferase of interest (e.g., fucosyltransferase).<br>
For example, in the case of a  1,2 fucosyltransferase, a substantially uniform fucosylation<br>
pattern exists if substantially all (as defined below) of the Galpl,4-GIcNAc-R and sialylated<br>
analogues thereof are fucosylated in a peptide conjugate of the invention. It will be<br>
understood by one of skill in the art, that the starting material may contain glycosylated<br>
acceptor moieties (e.g., fucosylated Gall,4-GlcNAc-R moieties). Thus, the calculated<br>
percent glycosylation will include acceptor moieties that are glycosylated by the methods of<br>
the invention, as well as those acceptor moieties already glycosylated in the starting material.<br>
[0057] The term "substantially" in the above definitions of "substantially uniform"<br>
generally means at least about 40%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, or more<br>
preferably at least about 90%, and still more preferably at least about 95% of the acceptor<br>
moieties for a particular glycosyltransferase are glycosylated.<br><br>
[0058] The terms "large-scale" and "industrial-scale" are used interchangeably and refer to<br>
a reaction cycle that produces at least about 250 mg, preferably at least about 500 mg and<br>
more preferably at least about 1 gram of glycoconjugate at the completion of a single reaction<br>
cycle.<br>
[0059] The symbol , whether utilized as a bond or displayed perpendicular to a bond<br>
indicates the point at which the displayed moiety is attached to the remainder of the molecule,<br>
solid support, etc.<br>
[0060] Certain compounds of the present invention can exist in unsolvated forms as well as<br>
solvated forms, including hydrated forms. In general, the solvated forms are equivalent to<br>
unsolvated forms and are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Certain<br>
compounds of the present invention may exist in multiple crystalline or amorphous forms. In<br>
general, all physical forms are equivalent for the uses contemplated by the present invention<br>
and are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0061] Certain compounds of the present invention possess asymmetric carbon atom's<br>
(optical centers) or double bonds; the racemates, diastereomers, geometric isomers and<br>
individual isomers are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0062] The compounds of the invention may be prepared as a single isomer (e.g.,<br>
enantiomer, cis-trans, positional, diastereomer) or as a mixture of isomers. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the compounds are prepared as substantially a single isomer. Methods of<br>
preparing substantially isomerically pure compounds are known in the art. For example,<br>
enantiomerically enriched mixtures and pure enantiomeric compounds can be prepared by<br>
using synthetic intermediates that are enantiomerically pure in combination with reactions<br>
that either leave the stereochemistry at a chiral center unchanged or result in its complete<br>
inversion. Alternatively, the final product or intermediates along the synthetic route can be<br>
resolved into a single stereoisomer. Techniques for inverting or leaving unchanged a<br>
particular stereocenter, and those for resolving mixtures of stereoisomers are well known in<br>
the art and it is well within the ability of one of skill in the art to choose and appropriate<br>
method for a particular situation. See, generally, Fumiss et al. (eds.),V0GEL'S<br>
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 5TH ED., Longman Scientific and<br>
Technical Ltd., Essex, 1991, pp. 809-816; and Heller, Ace. Chem. Res. 23: 128 (1990).<br>
[0063] The compounds of the present invention may also contain unnatural proportions of<br>
atomic isotopes at one or more of the atoms that constitute such compounds. For example,<br><br>
the compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium<br>
(3H), iodine-125 (125I) or carbon-14 (14C). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the<br>
present invention, whether radioactive or not, are intended to be encompassed within the<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
[0064] Where substituent groups are specified by their conventional chemical formulae,<br>
written from left to right, they equally encompass the chemically identical substituents, which<br>
would result from writing the structure from right to left, e.g., -CH2O- is intended to also<br>
recite -OCH2-.<br>
[0065J The term "alkyl," by itself or as part of another substituent means, unless otherwise<br>
stated, a straight or branched chain, or cyclic hydrocarbon radical, or combination thereof,<br>
which may be fully saturated, mono- or polyunsaturated and can include divalent ("alkylene")<br>
and multivalent radicals, having the number of carbon atoms designated (i.e. C1-C10 means<br>
one to ten carbons). Examples of saturated hydrocarbon radicals include, but are not limited<br>
to, groups such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl,<br>
cyclohexyl, (cyclohexyl)methyl, cyclopropylmethyl, homologs and isomers of, for example,<br>
n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, and the like. An unsaturated alkyl group is one having<br>
one or more double bonds or triple bonds. Examples of unsaturated alkyl groups include, but<br>
are not limited to, vinyl, 2-propenyl, crotyl, 2-isopentenyl, 2-(butadienyI), 2,4-pentadienyl, 3-<br>
(1,4-pentadienyl), ethynyl, 1- and 3-propynyI, 3-butynyl, and the higher homologs and<br>
isomers. The term "alkyl," unless otherwise noted, is also meant to include those derivatives<br>
of alkyl defined in more detail below, such as "heteroalkyl." Alkyl groups that are limited to<br>
hydrocarbon groups are termed "homoalkyl".<br>
[0066] Exemplary alkyl groups of use in the present invention contain between about one<br>
and about twenty five carbon atoms (e.g. methyl, ethyl and the like). Straight, branched or<br>
cyclic hydrocarbon chains having eight or fewer carbon atoms will also be referred to herein<br>
as "lower alkyl". In addition, the term "alkyl" as used herein further includes one or more<br>
substitutions at one or more carbon atoms of the hydrocarbon chain fragment.<br>
[0067] The terms "alkoxy," "alkylamino" and "alkylthio" (or thioalkoxy) are used in their<br>
conventional sense, and refer to those alkyl groups attached to the remainder of the molecule<br>
via an oxygen atom, an amino group, or a sulfur atom, respectively.<br>
[0068] The term "heteroalkyl," by itself or in combination with another term, means, unless<br>
otherwise stated, a straight or branched chain, or cyclic carbon-containing radical, or<br><br>
combinations thereof, consisting of the stated number of carbon atoms and at least one<br>
heteroatom selected from the group consisting of O, N, Si, P and S, and wherein the nitrogen,<br>
phosphorous and sulfur atoms are optionally oxidized, and the nitrogen heteroatom is<br>
optionally be quaternized. The heteroatom(s) O, N, P, S and Si may be placed at any interior<br>
position of the heteroalkyl group or at the position at which the alkyl group is attached to the<br>
remainder of the molecule. Examples include, but are not limited to, -CH2-CH2-O-CH3, -<br>
CH2-CH2-NH-CH3, -CH2-CH2-N(CH3)-CH3, -CH2-S-CH2-CH3, -CH2-CH2,-S(O)-CH3, -CH2-<br>
CH2-S(O)2-CH3, -CH=CH-O-CH3, -Si(CH3)3, -CH2-CH=N-OCH3, and -3H=CH-N(CH3)<br>
CH3. Up to two heteroatoms may be consecutive, such as, for example, -CH2-NH-OCH3 and<br>
-CH2-O-Si(CH3)3. Similarly, the term "heteroalkylene" by itself or as part of another<br>
substituent means a divalent radical derived from heteroalkyl, as exemplified, but not limited<br>
by, -CH2-CH2-S-CH2-CH2- and -CH2-S-CH2-CH2-NH-CH2-. For heteroalkylene groups,<br>
heteroatoms can also occupy either or both of the chain termini (e.g., alkyleneoxy,<br>
alkylenedioxy, alkyleneamino, alkylenediamino, and the like). Still further, for alkylene and<br>
heteroalkylene linking groups, no orientation of the linking group is implied by the direction<br>
in which the formula of the linking group is written. For example, the formula-C(O)2R'-<br>
represents both -C(O)2R'- and -R'C(O)2-.<br>
[0069] The terms "cycloalkyl" and "heterocycloalkyl", by themselves or in combination<br>
with other terms, represent, unless otherwise stated, cyclic versions of "alkyl" and<br>
"heteroalkyl", respectively. Additionally, for heterocycloalkyl, a heteroatom can occupy the<br>
position at which the heterocycle is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples of<br>
cycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, l-cyclohexenyl, 3-<br>
cyclohexenyl, cycloheptyl, and the like. Examples of heterocycloalkyl include, but are not<br>
limited to, 1 -(1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridyl), 1-piperidinyl, 2-piperidinyl, 3-piperidinyl, 4-<br>
morpholinyl, 3-morpholinyl, tetrahydrofuran-2-yl, tetrahydrofuran-3-yl, tetrahydrothien-2-yl,<br>
tetrahydrothien-3-yl, 1 -piperazinyl, 2-piperazinyl, and the like.<br>
[0070] The term "aryl" means, unless otherwise stated, a polyunsaturated, aromatic moiety<br>
that can be a single ring or multiple rings (preferably from 1 to 3 rings), which are fused<br>
together or linked covalently. The term "heteroaryl" refers to aryl groups (or rings) that<br>
contain from one to four heteroatoms selected from N, O. and S, wherein the nitrogen and<br>
sulfur atoms are optionally oxidized, and the nitrogen atom(s) are optionally quaternized. A<br>
heteroaryl group can be attached to the remainder of the molecule through a heteroatom.<br>
Non-limiting examples of aryl and heteroaryl groups include phenyl, 1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl,<br><br>
4-biphenyl, 1-pyrrolyl, 2-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrazolyl, 2-imidazoIyl, 4-imidazolyl,<br>
pyrazinyl, 2-oxazolyl, 4-oxazolyl, 2-phenyl-4-oxazolyl, 5-oxazolyl, 3-isoxazolyl, 4-<br>
isoxazolyl, 5-isoxazolyl, 2-thiazolyl, 4-thiazolyl, 5-thiazolyI, 2-furyl, 3-furyl, 2-thienyI, 3-<br>
thienyl, 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl, 4-pyridyl, 2-pyrimidyl, 4-pyrimidyl, 5-benzothiazolyl, purinyl,<br>
2-benzimidazolyl, 5-indolyl, 1-isoquinolyl, 5-isoquinolyl, 2-quinoxalinyl, 5-quinoxalinyl, 3-<br>
quinolyl, tetrazolyl, benzo[b]furanyl, benzo[b]thienyl, 2,3-dihydrobenzo[l,4]dioxin-6-yl,<br>
benzo[l,3]dioxol-5-yl and 6-quinolyl. Substituents for each of the above noted aryl and<br>
heteroaryl ring systems are selected from the group of acceptable substituents described<br>
below.<br>
[0071] For brevity, the term "aryl" when used in combination with other terms (e.g.,<br>
aryloxy, arylthioxy, arylalkyl) includes both aryl and heteroaryl rings as defined above.<br>
Thus, the term "arylalkyl" is meant to include those radicals in which an aryl group is<br>
attached to an alkyl group (e.g., benzyl, phenethyl, pyridylmethyl and the like) including<br>
those alkyl groups in which a carbon atom (e.g., a methylene group) has been replaced by, for<br>
example, an oxygen atom (e.g., phenoxymethyl, 2-pyridyloxymethyl, 3-(l-<br>
naphthyloxy)propyl, and the like).<br>
[0072] Each of the above terms (e.g., "alkyl," "heteroalkyl," "aryl" and "heteroaryl")<br>
includes both substituted and unsubstituted forms of the indicated radical. Preferred<br>
substituents for each type of radical are provided below.<br>
[0073] Substituents for the alkyl and heteroalkyl radicals (including those groups often<br>
referred to as alkylene, alkenyl, heteroalkylene, heteroalkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl,<br>
heterocycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, and heterocycloalkenyl) are generically referred to as "alkyl<br>
group substituents," and they can be one or more of a variety of groups selected from, but not<br>
limited to: -OR', =O, =NR\ =N-OR', -NR'R", -SR', -halogen, -SiR'R"R"\ -OC(O)R', -<br>
C(O)R\ -CO2R', -CONR'R", -OC(O)NR'R", -NR"C(O)R', -NR'-C(O)NR"R"', -<br>
NR"C(O)2R\ -NR-C(NR'R"R'")=NR"", -NR-C(NR'R")=NR'", -S(O)R\ -S(O)2R\ -<br>
S(O)2NR'R", -NRSO2R', -CN and -NO2 in a number ranging from zero to (2m'+1), where<br>
m' is the total number of carbon atoms in such radical. R', R", R'" and R"" each preferably<br>
independently refer to hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or<br>
unsubstituted aryl, e.g., aryl substituted with 1-3 halogens, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl,<br>
alkoxy or thioalkoxy groups, or arylalkyl groups. When a compound of the invention<br>
includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected<br><br>
as are each R', R", R'" and R"" groups when more than one of these groups is present. When<br>
R' and R" are attached to the same nitrogen atom, they can be combined with the nitrogen<br>
atom to form a 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring. For example, -NR'R" is meant to include, but not<br>
be limited to, 1-pyrrolidinyl and 4-morphoIinyl. From the above discussion of substituents,<br>
one of skill in the art will understand that the term "alkyl" is meant to include groups<br>
including carbon atoms bound to groups other than hydrogen groups, such as haloalkyl (e.g.,<br>
-CF3 and -CH2CF3) and acyl (e.g., -C(O)CH3, -C(O)CF3, -C(O)CH2OCH3, and the like).<br>
[0074] Similar to the substituents described for the alkyl radical, substituents for the aryl<br>
and heteroaryl groups are generically referred to as "aryl group substituents." The<br>
substituents are selected from, for example: halogen, -OR', =O, =NR', =N-OR', -NR'R", -<br>
SR', -halogen, -SiR'R"R"\ -OC(O)R\ -C(O)R\ -CO2R', -CONR'R", -OC(O)NR'R", -<br>
NR"C(O)R', -NR'-C(O)NR"R"\ -NR"C(O)2R', -NR-C(NR'R"R'")=NR"",<br>
-NR-C(NR'R")=NR'", -S(O)R', -S(O)2R', -S(O)2NR'R", -NRSO2R', -CN and -NO2, -R', -<br>
N3, -CH(Ph)2, fluoro(C1-C4)aIkoxy, and fluoro(C1-C4)alkyl, in a number ranging from zero to<br>
the total number of open valences on the aromatic ring system; and where R', R", R'" and<br>
R"" are preferably independently selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl,<br>
substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl and substituted or<br>
unsubstituted heteroaryl. When a compound of the invention includes more than one R<br>
group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R', R", R'"<br>
and R"" groups when more than one of these groups is present. In the schemes that follow,<br>
the symbol X represents "R" as described above.<br>
[0075] Two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may<br>
optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula -T-C(O)-(CRR')q-U-, wherein T and<br>
U are independently -NR-, -O-, -CRR'- or a single bond, and q is an integer of from 0 to 3.<br>
Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may<br>
optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula —A-(CH2)r-B-, wherein A and B are<br>
independently -CRR'-, -O-, -NR-, -S-, -S(O)-, -S(O)2-, -S(O)2NR'- or a single bond, and r is<br>
an integer of from 1 to 4. One of the single bonds of the new ring so formed may optionally<br>
be replaced with a double bond. Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of<br>
the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula -<br>
(CRR')5-X-(CR"R'")d-, where s and d are independently integers of from O to 3, and X is -O-<br>
, -NR'-, -S-, -S(O)-, -S(O)2-, or-S(O)2NR'-. The substituents R, R', R" and R"' are<br>
preferably independently selected from hydrogen or substituted or unsubstituted (C1-C*6*)alkyl.<br><br>
[0076] As used herein, the term "heteroatom" includes oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S),<br>
phosphorus (P) and silicon (Si).<br>
[0077] The term "amino" or "amine group" refers to the group -NR'R' (or -N+RR'R")<br>
where R, R' and R" are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl,<br>
substituted alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, aryl alkyl, substituted aryl alkyl, heteroaryl, and<br>
substituted heteroaryl. A substituted amine is an amine group wherein R' or R" is other than<br>
hydrogen. In a primary amino group, both R' and R" are hydrogen, whereas in a secondary<br>
amino group, either, but not both, R' or R" is hydrogen. In addition, the terms "amine" and<br>
"amino" can include protonated and quaternized versions of nitrogen, comprising the group -<br>
N+RR'R" and its biologically compatible anionic counter ions.<br>
[0078] The terms "halo" or "halogen," by themselves or as part of another substituent,<br>
mean, unless otherwise stated, a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom. Additionally,<br>
terms such as "haloalkyl," are meant to include monohaloalkyl and polyhaloalkyl. For<br>
example, the term "halo(C1-C4)alkyl" is mean to include, but not be limited to,<br>
trifluoromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, 4-chlorobutyI, 3-bromopropyl, and the like.<br>
[0079] The term "Linker" or "L", as used herein, refers to a single covalent bond or a series<br>
of stable covalent bonds incorporating 1-20 nonhydrogen atoms selected from the group<br>
consisting of C, N, O, S and P that covalently attach the water-soluble polymers or branched<br>
water-soluble polymers to another moiety such as a chemically reactive group or a<br>
conjugated substance including biological and non-biological substances. Exemplary linking<br>
members include a moiety that includes -C(O)NH-, -C(O)O-, -NH-, -S-, -O-, and the like. A<br>
"cleavable linker" is a linker that has one or more cleavable groups that may be broken by the<br>
result of a reaction or condition. The term "cleavable group" refers to a moiety that allows<br>
for release of a portion, e.g., a water-soluble polymer, of a conjugate from the remainder of<br>
the conjugate by cleaving a bond linking the released moiety to the remainder of the<br>
conjugate. Such cleavage is either chemical in nature, or enzymatically mediated.<br>
Exemplary enzymatically cleavable groups include natural amino acids or peptide sequences<br>
that end with a natural amino acid.<br>
[0080] In addition to enzymatically cleavable groups, it is within the scope of the present<br>
invention to include one or more sites that are cleaved by the action of an agent other than an<br>
enzyme. Exemplary non-enzymatic cleavage agents include, but are not limited to, acids,<br>
bases, light (e.g., nitrobenzyl derivatives, phenacyl groups, benzoin esters), and heat. Many<br><br>
cleaveable groups are known in the art. See, for example, Jung et ai, Biochem. Biophys.<br>
Acta, 761: 152-162 (1983); Joshi et al, J. Biol. Chem., 265: 14518-14525 (199O); Zarling et<br>
al., J. Immunol, 124: 913-92O (198O); Bouizar et al, Eur. J. Biochem., 155: 141-147 (1986);<br>
Park et al, J. Biol. Chem., 261: 2O5-21O (1986); Browning et al, J. Immunol, 143: 1859-<br>
1867 (1989). Moreover a broad range of cleavable, bifunctional (both homo- and hetero-<br>
bifunctional) spacer arms are commercially available.<br>
[0081] An exemplary cleavable group, an ester, is cleavable group that may be cleaved by a<br>
reagent, e.g. sodium hydroxide, resulting in a carboxylate-containing fragment and a<br>
hydroxyl-containing product.<br>
[0082] The linker can be used to attach the compound to another component of a conjugate,<br>
such as a targeting moiety (e.g., antibody, ligand, non-covalent protein-binding group, etc.),<br>
an analyte, a biomolecule, a drug and the like.<br>
[0083] "Non-covalent protein binding groups" are moieties that interact with an intact or<br>
denatured polypeptide in an associative manner. The interaction may be either reversible or<br>
irreversible in a biological milieu. The incorporation of a "non-covalent protein binding<br>
group" into a fluorogenic compound of the invention provides the compound with the ability<br>
to interact with a polypeptide in a non-covalent manner. Exemplary non-covalent<br>
interactions include hydrophobic-hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Exemplary<br>
"non-covalent protein binding groups" include anionic groups, e.g., phosphate,<br>
thiophosphate, phosphonate, carboxylate, boronate, sulfate, sulfone, thiosulfate, and<br>
thiosulfonate.<br>
[0084] As used herein, "nucleic acid" means DNA, RNA, single-stranded, double-stranded,<br>
or more highly aggregated hybridization motifs, and any chemical modifications thereof.<br>
Modifications include, but are not limited to, those providing chemical groups that<br>
incorporate additional charge, polarizability, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction, and<br>
fluxionality to the nucleic acid ligand bases or to the nucleic acid ligand as a whole. Such<br>
modifications include, but are not limited to, peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), phosphodiester<br>
group modifications {e.g., phosphorothioates, methylphosphonates), 2'-position sugar<br>
modifications, 5-position pyrimidine modifications, 8-position purine modifications,<br>
modifications at exocyclic amines, substitution of 4-thiouridine, substitution of 5-bromo or 5-<br>
iodo-uracil; backbone modifications, methylations, unusual base-pairing combinations such<br>
as the isobases, isocytidine and isoguanidine and the like. Nucleic acids can also include<br><br>
non-natural bases, such as, for example, nitroindole. Modifications can also include 3' and 5'<br>
modifications such as capping with a quencher, a fluorophore or another moiety.<br>
[0085] The term "reactive group" as used herein refers to a group that is capable of reacting<br>
with another chemical group to form a covalent bond, i.e. is covalently reactive under<br>
suitable reaction conditions, and generally represents a point of attachment for another<br>
substance. The reactive group is a moiety, such as carboxylic acid or succinimidyl ester, on<br>
the compounds of the present invention that is capable of chemically reacting with a<br>
functional group on a different compound to form a covalent linkage resulting in a<br>
fluorescent or fluorogenic labeled component. Reactive groups generally include<br>
nucleophiles, electrophiles and photoactivatable groups.<br>
[0086] Exemplary reactive groups include, but not limited to, olefins, acetylenes, alcohols,<br>
phenols, ethers, oxides, halides, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, amides,<br>
cyanates, isocyanates, thiocyanates, isothiocyanates, amines, hydrazines, hydrazones,<br>
hydrazides, diazo, diazonium, nitro, nitriles, mercaptans, sulfides, disulfides, sulfoxides,<br>
sulfones, sulfonic acids, sulfinic acids, acetals, ketals, anhydrides, sulfates, sulfenic acids<br>
isonitriles, amidines, imides, imidates, nitrones, hydroxylamines, oximes, hydroxamic acids<br>
thiohydroxamic acids, allenes, ortho esters, sulfites, enamines, ynamines, ureas, pseudoureas,<br>
semicarbazides, carbodiimides, carbamates, imines, azides, azo compounds, azoxy<br>
compounds, and nitroso compounds. Reactive functional groups also include those used to<br>
prepare bioconjugates, e.g., N-hydroxysuccinimide esters, maleimides and the like. Methods<br>
to prepare each of these functional groups are well known in the art and their application to or<br>
modification for a particular purpose is within the ability of one of skill in the art (see, for<br>
example, Sandler and Karo, eds. ORGANIC FUNCTIONAL GROUP PREPARATIONS, Academic<br>
Press, San Diego, 1989).<br>
[0087] The term "targeting group" refers to a moiety that is: (1) able to actively direct the<br>
entity to which it is attached (e.g., a fluorogenic moiety) to a target region, e.g., a cell; or (2)<br>
is preferentially passively absorbed by or entrained within a target region. The targeting<br>
group can be a small molecule, which is intended to include both non-peptides and peptides.<br>
The targeting group can also be a macromolecule, which includes, but is not limited to,<br>
saccharides, lectins, receptors, ligand for receptors, proteins such as BSA, antibodies,<br>
poly(ethers), dendrimers, poly(amino acids) and so forth.<br><br>
[0088] "Carrier molecule," as used herein refers to any molecule to which a compound of<br>
the invention is attached. Representative carrier molecules include a protein (e.g.., enzyme,<br>
antibody), glycoprotein, peptide, saccharide (e.g., mono- oliogo- and poly-saccharides),<br>
hormone, receptor, antigen, substrate, metabolite, transition state analog, cofactor, inhibitor,<br>
drug, dye, nutrient, growth factor, etc., without limitation. "Carrier molecule" also refers to<br>
species that might not be considered to fall within the classical definition of "a molecule,"<br>
e.g., solid support (e.g., synthesis support, chromatographic support, membrane), virus and<br>
micr00rganism.<br>
Introduction<br>
[0089] The present invention provides branched water-soluble polymers and conjugates of<br>
the branched water-soluble polymers. The conjugates are formed between the branched<br>
water-soluble polymers of the invention and a species that includes a reactive group to which<br>
the branched water-soluble polymer can be conjugated. Exemplary conjugation partners for<br>
the water-soluble polymers of the invention include peptides, glycopeptides, lipids and<br>
glycolipids. An exemplary conjugate is one in which a modified sugar bearing a branched<br>
water-soluble polymer of the invention is attached either directly or indirectly (e.g., through<br>
an intervening glycosyl residue) to a glycosylation site on a peptide. Also provided are<br>
methods for producing the conjugates of the invention.<br>
[009O] The conjugates and methods of forming the conjugates of the invention are<br>
illustrated herein by reference to peptide and glycopeptide conjugates. The focus of the<br>
discussion is for clarity of illustration and it should not be interpreted as limiting the utility of<br>
the branched water-soluble polymers disclosed herein to use in the formation of such<br>
conjugates. Those of skill in the art will recognize that the branched water-soluble polymers<br>
of the present invention are of use in forming a wide variety of branched water-soluble<br>
polymer conjugates.<br>
[0091] As discussed in the preceding section, art-recognized chemical methods of covalent<br>
PEGylation rely on chemical conjugation through reactive groups on amino acids or<br>
carbohydrates. Through careful design of the conjugate and the reaction conditions, useful<br>
conjugates have been prepared using chemically-mediated conjugation strategies. A major<br>
shortcoming of chemical conjugation of polymers to proteins or glycoproteins is the lack of<br>
selectivity of the activated polymers, which often results in attachment of polymers at sites<br>
implicated in protein or glycoprotein bioactivity. Several strategies have been developed to<br><br>
address site selective conjugation chemistries, however, only one universal method suitable<br>
for a variety of recombinant proteins has been developed.<br>
[0092] In contrast to art-recognized methods, the present invention provides a novel<br>
strategy for highly selective site directed glycoconjugation of branched water-soluble<br>
polymers, e.g., glyco-PEGylation. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, site<br>
directed attachment of branched water-soluble polymers is accomplished by in vitro<br>
enzymatic glycosylation of specific peptide sequences. Glyco-conjugation can be performed<br>
enzymatically utilizing a glycosyltransferase, e.g., a sialyltransferase, capable of transferring<br>
the species branched water-soluble polymer-glycosyl, e.g., PEG-sialic acid, to a glycosylation<br>
site ("glyco-PEGylation").<br>
Branched Water-Soluble Polymers<br>
[0093] In a first aspect, the invention provides a branched water-soluble polymer having<br>
the formula:<br>
WSP—Y—Rx<br>
in which WSP is a water-soluble polymer. The symbol Y represents a linker, e.g., a bond, or<br>
a moiety comprising an amide, carboxylic acid ester, urethane, mercaptans, substituted or<br>
unsubstituted alkyl, and the like. Exemplary linking groups include a bond, (CH2)n,<br>
(CH2)mC(O)O(CH2)n, (CH2)mC(O)NH(CH2)n, (CH2)mOC(O)NH(CH2)n, (CH2)mO(CH2)n,<br>
(CH2)mNH(CH2)n and (CH2)mS(CH2)n in which m and n are integers independently selected<br>
from O to 6. Rx is a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl moiety linked to a water-soluble<br>
polymer; an amino acid or dimer of an amino acid linked to a water-soluble polymer; or a<br>
sugar or a sugar nucleotide linked to a water-soluble polymer. WSP and the water-soluble<br>
polymer component of Rx may be the same water-soluble polymer or different water-soluble<br>
polymers.<br>
[0094] Exemplary water-soluble polymers of use in the compounds of the invention include<br>
m-PEG, PEG, m-PPG, PPG, polysialic acid, polyglutamate, polyaspartate, polylysine,<br>
polyethyeleneimine, polylactide, polyglyceride, and functionalized PEG, e.g., terminal-<br>
functionized PEG.<br>
[0095] In an exemplary embodiment, Y is substituted alkyl and the invention provides a<br>
branched water-soluble polymer having the formula:<br><br><br>
in which X and Y are members independently selected from OR1, NR2R3, SR4, C00R5,<br>
CONK6R7, OCONR6R7, substituted and unsubstituted alkyl, and substituted and unsubstituted<br>
aryl. Z1 is a member selected from OR1', NR2R3', SR4', C00R5", CONR6R7', substituted and<br>
unsubstituted alkyl, and substituted and unsubstituted aryl. The symbols R1, R4, and R5<br>

from H, substituted and unsubstituted alkyl, substituted and unsubstituted aryl, substituted<br>
and unsubstituted heteroaryl, substituted and unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, a reactive<br>
functional group, and a water-soluble polymer with the proviso that these groups are selected<br>
such that the compound according to Formula I includes at least two water-soluble polymer<br>
moieties. The symbols R1, R2', R3', R4', R5', R6', and R7' represent groups that are<br>
independently selected from H, substituted and unsubstituted alkyl, substituted and<br>
unsubstituted aryl, substituted and unsubstituted heteroaryl, substituted and unsubstituted<br>
heterocycloalkyl, a reactive functional group, a carrier molecule, and a water-soluble<br>
polymer.<br>
[0096] In another exemplary embodiment, Z1 comprises a saccharyl moiety. The saccharyl<br>
moiety can be an activated saccharyl moiety, e.g., a nucleotide sugar. Still further, Z1 can<br>
comprise a saccharyl moiety that is directly bound to an amino acid of a peptide, or indirectly<br>
bound to an amino acid of a peptide by its conjugation to a glycosyl residue attached to the<br>
amino acid.<br>
[0097] Exemplary compounds of the invention according to Formula 1 are set forth below:<br><br><br>
in which R14 is OH or a reactive functional group. An exemplary reactive functional group is<br>
C(O)Q', in which Q' is selected such that C(O)Q' is a reactive functional group. Q' can also<br>
comprise a carrier molecule ("Ligand"). Exemplary species for Q' include halogen, NHS,<br>
pentafluorophenyl, HOBT, HOAt, and p-nitrophenyl. The index "m" and the index "n" are<br>
integers independently selected from 1 to 20,000.<br>

[0101] The invention also provides a branched polymer that is based on an amino acid or<br>
oligo-amino acid (e.g., di-, tri-, tetra-peptide). Exemplary amino acid-based branched<br>
polymers have a formula selected from:<br><br>
wherein R1', R11', R12, R12', R13 and R13' are independently selected from H, substituted or<br>

moieties. R14 is a member selected from OH, reactive functional groups, a group comprising<br>
a saccharide moiety or a group that is linked to a carrier molecule. A is a member selected<br>
from O and S. The index "s" represents and integer from 1 to 5. A is a member selected<br>
from NH, O and S.<br>
[0102] Each of the compounds set forth in the formulae above are of use for the chemical<br>
PEGylation of another species (e.g., nucleic acid, peptide, saccharide, etc.). Methods of<br>
forming conjugates between PEG (and species containing PEG) are generally known in the<br>
art. See, for example, Hermanson, BIOCONJUGATE TECHNIQUES, Academic Press, San Diego,<br>
1996; and Feeney et al, MODIFICATION OF PROTEINS; Advances in Chemistry Series, Vol.<br>
198, American Chemical Society, Washington, D.C., 1982.<br>
[0103] In another exemplary embodiment, R14 comprises a saccharyl moiety. The<br>
saccharyl moiety can be an activated saccharyl moiety, e.g., a nucleotide sugar. Still further,<br>
R14 can comprise a saccharyl moiety that is directly bound to an amino acid of a peptide, or<br>
indirectly bound to an amino acid of a peptide by its conjugation to a glycosyl residue<br>
attached to the amino acid.<br>
[0104] Exemplary compositions of the invention include:<br><br><br>

below.<br><br><br>
[0107] In the figures set forth in the table above the symbols a and b independently<br>
represent numbers between 1 and 10. The symbols m and o independently represent numbers<br>
between 1 and 10,000. The symbol X represents OH, H, Q (an activating group), and a<br>
biological moiety, such as a protein, sugar, lipid, or nucleotide.<br>
[0108] In another exemplary embodiment, R14 comprises a saccharyl moiety. The<br>
saccharyl moiety can be an activated saccharyl moiety, e.g., a nucleotide sugar. Still further,<br>
R14 can comprise a saccharyl moiety that is directly bound to an amino acid of a peptide, or<br>
indirectly bound to an amino acid of a peptide by its conjugation to a glycosyl residue<br>
attached to the amino acid.<br>
[0109] In yet another aspect, the invention provides a branched water-soluble polymer that<br>
is based upon a saccharide nucleus ("branch core"). Those of skill will appreciate that the<br>
saccharide nucleus can be of any structure. Exemplary saccharides of use in this aspect of the<br>
invention include GlcNAc, Gal, Sia, Fuc, Glc, GalNAc, GalNH2, GlcNH2 and the like.<br>
[0110] An exemplary compound of the invention has the formula:<br>

in which L is a linker and WSP is a water-soluble polymer.<br>
[0111] A further exemplary compound of the invention has the formula:<br>
(C6H10O4)—(OC(O)—L—WSP)2<br>
in which C6H10O4 is a saccharide branch core in which two of the saccharide OH moieties are<br>
converted to OC(O)-linker-WSP.<br><br>

polymer of the invention has the formula:<br><br>

based upon a sialic acid nucleus has the formula:<br><br>
in which R16 and R16 are members selected from H, acetyl, and:<br>
  (I)<br>
and R17,R18,RI9and R19' are members independently selected from H, OH, NH2, NHAc and<br>
the moiety according to Formula I. In Formula I, Z2 is a member selected from O, S, CH2<br>
and S. R11 is as described above, and the index "a" represents an integer from 0 to 20, with<br>
the proviso that at least two of R16, R16, R17, R18 and R19 have a structure according to<br>
Formula I. R1' can also be a group linked to a carrier molecule or a bond to a carrier<br>
molecule. R15 is a member selected from H and activating groups, e.g., a nucleotide<br>
phosphate.<br>
[0115] In another exemplary embodiment, the linker of Formula I has the structure:<br><br><br>
[0116] In yet another exemplary embodiment, the linker of Formula I has the structure:<br><br>
in which Z3 is a member selected from NH, O and S.<br>
[0117] In an exemplary embodiment, Z2 is NH.<br>
[0118] In a still further exemplary embodiment, the invention provides a compound having<br>
the structure:<br><br>
in which L is a linker as defined herein.<br>
[0119] In another aspect, the branched polymer is based upon galactose or N-acetyl<br>
galactose and it has the formula:<br><br>
wherein R1 -R are as described above and at least two of R15-R19 are a moiety according to<br>
Formula I.<br>
[0120] Still further, R15 can comprise a bond to an amino acid of a peptide or to a glycosyl<br>
moiety that is directly bound to an amino acid of a peptide, or indirectly bound to an amino<br>
acid of a peptide by its conjugation to a glycosyl residue attached to the amino acid.<br>
[0121] An exemplary scheme for preparing the branched saccharide core water-soluble<br>
polymers of the invention is provided below:<br><br><br>
[0122] Another exemplary scheme for preparing the saccharide core branched water-<br>
soluble polymers of the invention is set forth below:<br><br><br>
Mono-Dispersed Poly(Ethylene Glycol)<br>
[0123] The invention also provides a mono-dispersed high molecular weight PEG and a<br>
method of preparing an essentially mono-disperse population of poly(ethylene glycol)<br>
molecules. The method includes contacting a PEG molecule with a well-defined molecular<br>
weight, e.g., PEG200 with at least two equivalents of a bifunctional activated PEG that also<br>
has a well-defined molecular weight, e.g., PEG200, thereby producing a mono-disperse<br>
sample of a PEG, e.g., PEG600:<br><br>
G is a leaving group, such as a sulfonate or tresylate ester. The mono-disperse sample of<br>
PEG600 can then be contacted with the bifunctional activated PEG200 to form a mono-<br>
disperse PEG 100. Alternatively, the mono-disperse PEG600 can be converted to the<br>
corresponding bifunctional derivative and reacted with at least two equivalents of a mono-<br>
disperse di-hydroxy-PEG600, producing a mono-disperse PEG 1800. The process of the<br>
invention is repeated until a mono-disperse PEG of the desired size is obtained. The syntheis<br>
can be designed such that the molecular weight differences between the starting material and<br>
the product allow for the separation of any unreacted or partially reacted materials by size<br>
exclusion chromatography.<br>
[0124] Moreover, in response to the need for improved methods of preparing modified<br>
water-soluble polymers, such as poly(ethylene glycol), the present invention provides<br>
methods for the chemical activation and elongation of the polymer backbone. The mono-<br>
activated PEG molecules are of use to conjugate PEG to a wide variety of species, e.g,<br>
targeting moieties, therapeutic moieties, anti-tumor drugs, cytotoxins, radioactive agents,<br>
amino acids, saccharides and the like.<br>
[0125] Thus, in another aspect, the present invention provides a method for the step-wise<br>
assembly of activated water-soluble polymers, particularly poly(ethylene glycol) and its<br>
structural analogues. The method provides easy access to both mono- and bi-functionalized<br>
PEG molecules.<br><br>
[0126] In step a, the starting glycol is contacted with an activated group (R-Y) that reacts<br>
with a hydroxyl moiety of the glycol. Y is generally a leaving group, allowing placement of<br>
R on one of the hydroxyl moieties of the PEG molecule. In step b, the free hydroxyl of the<br>
resulting adduct is activated by its conversion to a group such as a sulfonate ester. The<br>
activated PEG species is contacted with another PEG moiety of the same or different degree<br>
of polymerization as the starting PEG ("PEGm")- To allow its attachment to another species,<br>
the RO-PEG(n+m) is optionally activated at the free hydroxyl moiety.<br>
[0127] The mono-disperse PEGs of the invention are readily activated by art-recognized<br>
methods and the activated derivatives can be used to form conjugates. Alternatively, the<br>
mono-disperse PEG is incorporated into a branched PEG of the invention, which is used to<br>
form a conjugate.<br>
Water-Soluble Polymers<br>
[0128] The hydrophilicity of a selected peptide is enhanced by conjugation with polar<br>
molecules such as amine-, ester-, hydroxyl- and polyhydroxyl-containing molecules.<br>
Representative examples include, but are not limited to, polylysine, polyethyleneimine, and<br>
polyethers, e.g., poly(ethyleneglycol), m-poly(ethylene glycol), poly(propyleneglycol), m-<br>
poly(ethylene glycol), and other O-alkyl poly(alkylene glycol) moieties. Preferred water-<br>
soluble polymers are essentially non-fluorescent, or emit such a minimal amount of<br>
fluorescence that they are inappropriate for use as a fluorescent marker in an assay.<br>
Moreover, it is generally preferred to use polymers that are not naturally occurring sugars.<br>
An exception to this preference is the use of an otherwise naturally occurring sugar that is<br>
modified by covalent attachment of another entity {e.g., poly(ethylene glycol),<br>
poly(propylene glycol), biomolecule, therapeutic moiety, diagnostic moiety, etc.). In another<br>
exemplary embodiment, a therapeutic sugar moiety is conjugated to a linker ami and the<br>
sugar-linker arm cassette is subsequently conjugated to a peptide via a method of the<br>
invention.<br>
[0129] Methods and chemistry for activation of water-soluble polymers and saccharides as<br>
well as methods for conjugating saccharides and polymers to various species are described in<br>
the literature. Commonly used methods for activation of polymers include activation of<br>
functional groups with cyanogen bromide, periodate, glutaraldehyde, biepoxides,<br>
epichlorohydrin, divinylsulfone, carbodiimide, sulfonyl halides, trichlorotriazine, etc. (see, R.<br>

[O13O] Many water-soluble polymers are known to those of skill in the art and are useful in<br>
practicing the present invention. The term water-soluble polymer encompasses species such<br>
as saccharides (e.g., dextran, amylose, hyalouronic acid, poly(sialic acid), heparans, heparins,<br>
etc.); poly (amino acids); nucleic acids; synthetic polymers (e.g., poly(acrylic acid),<br>
poly(ethers), e.g., poly(ethylene glycol); peptides, proteins, and the like. The present<br>
invention may be practiced with any water-soluble polymer with the sole limitation that the<br>
polymer must include a point at which the remainder of the conjugate can be attached.<br>
[0131] Methods for activation of polymers can also be found in WO 94/17039, U.S. Pat.<br>

conjugation between activated polymers and peptides, e.g. Coagulation Factor VIII (WO<br>
94/15625), haemoglobin (WO 94/09027), oxygen carrying molecule (U.S. Pat. No.<br>
4,412,989), ribonuclease and superoxide dismutase (Veronese at al, App. Biochem. Biotech.<br>
11: 141-45(1985)).<br>
[0132] Preferred water-soluble polymers are those in which a substantial proportion of the<br>
polymer molecules in a sample of the polymer are of approximately the same molecular<br>
weight; such polymers are "mono-disperse."<br>
[O133] The present invention is further illustrated by reference to a poly(ethylene glycol) or<br>
monomethoxy-poly(ethylene glycol) (m-PEG) conjugate. Several reviews and monographs<br>
on the functionalization and conjugation of PEG are available. See, for example, Harris,<br>

[0134] The poly(ethylene glycol) useful in forming the conjugate of the invention is either<br>
linear or branched. PEG moieties of any molecular weight, e.g., 5 Kd, 10 Kd, 20 Kd and<br>
30kD are of use in the present invention.<br><br>
Reactive Functional Groups<br>
[0135] The use of reactive derivatives of PEG (or other linkers) to attach one or more<br>
peptide moieties to the linker is within the scope of the present invention. The invention is<br>
not limited by the identity of the reactive PEG analogue. Many activated derivatives of<br>
poly(ethyleneglycol) are available commercially and in the literature. It is well within the<br>
abilities of one of skill to ch00se, and synthesize if necessary, an appropriate activated PEG<br>
derivative with which to prepare a substrate useful in the present invention. See, Abuchowski<br>

[0136] Reactive groups and classes of reactions useful in practicing the present invention<br>
are generally those that are well known in the art of bioconjugate chemistry. Currently<br>
favored classes of reactions available with reactive sugar moieties are those, which proceed<br>
under relatively mild conditions. These include, but are not limited to nucleophilic<br>
substitutions {e.g., reactions of amines and alcohols with acyl halides, active esters),<br>
electrophilic substitutions (e.g., enamine reactions) and additions to carbon-carbon and<br>
carbon-heteroatom multiple bonds (e.g., Michael reaction, Diels-Alder addition). These and<br>
other useful reactions are discussed in, for example, March, ADVANCED ORGANIC<br><br>
CHEMISTRY, 3rd Ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1985; Hermanson, BIOCONJUGATE<br>
TECHNIQUES, Academic Press, San Diego, 1996; and Feeney et al, MODIFICATION OF<br>
PROTEINS; Advances in Chemistry Series, Vol. 198, American Chemical Society,<br>

[0137] Useful reactive functional groups pendent from a sugar nucleus or modifying group<br>
include, but are not limited to:<br>
(a)	carboxyl groups and various derivatives thereof including, but not limited to,<br>
N-hydroxysuccinimide esters, N-hydroxybenztriazole esters, acid halides, acyl<br>
imidazoles, thioesters, p-nitrophenyl esters, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl and<br>
aromatic esters;<br>
(b)	hydroxyl groups, which can be converted to, e.g., esters, ethers, aldehydes, etc.<br>
(c)	haloalkyl groups, wherein the halide can be later displaced with a nucleophilic<br>
group such as, for example, an amine, a carboxylate anion, thiol anion,<br>
carbanion, or an alkoxide ion, thereby resulting in the covalent attachment of a<br>
new group at the functional group of the halogen atom;<br>
(d)	dienophile groups, which are capable of participating in Diels-Alder reactions<br>
such as, for example, maleimido groups;<br>
(e)	aldehyde or ketone groups, such that subsequent derivatization is possible via<br>
formation of carbonyl derivatives such as, for example, imines, hydrazones,<br>
semicarbazones or oximes, or via such mechanisms as Grignard addition or<br>
alkyllithium addition;<br>
(f)	sulfonyl halide groups for subsequent reaction with amines, for example, to form<br>
sulfonamides;<br>
(g)	thiol groups, which can be, for example, converted to disulfides or reacted with<br>
acyl halides;<br>
(h) amine or sulfhydryl groups, which can be, for example, acylated, alkylated or<br>
oxidized;<br>
(i) alkenes, which can undergo, for example, cycloadditions, acylation, Michael<br>
addition, etc; and<br>
(j) epoxides, which can react with, for example, amines and hydroxyl compounds.<br><br>
[0138] The reactive functional groups can be chosen such that they do not participate in, or<br>
interfere with, the reactions necessary to assemble the reactive sugar nucleus or modifying<br>
group. Alternatively, a reactive functional group can be protected from participating in the<br>
reaction by the presence of a protecting group. Those of skill in the art understand how to<br>
protect a particular functional group such that it does not interfere with a chosen set of<br>
reaction conditions. For examples of useful protecting groups, see, for example, Greene et<br>
 al, PROTECTIVE GROUPS IN ORGANIC SYNTHESIS, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1991.<br>
Peptide Conjugates<br>
[0139] The use of the compounds of the invention is exemplified by their use in forming<br>
peptide conjugates of branched water-soluble polymers. The focus of the discussion is for<br>
clarity of illustration. Those of skill will appreciate that the discussion is relevant to the<br>
formation of a variety of conjugates using the branched water-soluble polymers of the<br>
invention. In an exemplary embodiment, a chemically reactive branched water-soluble<br>
polymer is conjugated to a complementary reactive group on the peptide by a method known<br>
in the art or a modification thereof.<br>
[0140] In another exemplary embodiment, the branched water-soluble polymer includes a<br>
saccharide moiety as the branch core or, alternatively, the branched water-soluble polymer is<br>
attached to a saccharide. The saccharide is a substrate for an enzyme that transfers the<br>
saccharide-based branched water-soluble polymer (or the saccharide-branched water-soluble<br>
polymer conjugate) onto an amino acid or glycosyl residue of the peptide. Those of skill in<br>
the art will appreciate that the methods set forth above are not limited to practice with<br>
peptides but are widely applicable to other species, e.g., lipids, glycolipids, saccharides and<br>
other therapeutic moieties.<br>
[0141 ] The conjugates of the invention are formed by the enzymatic attachment of a<br>
branched water-soluble polymer-modified sugar to a glycosylated or an unglycosylated<br>
peptide. The modified sugar is directly added to a glycosylation site, or to a glycosyl residue<br>
attached either directly or indirectly (e.g., through one or more glycosyl residue) to a<br>
glycosylation site.<br>
[0142] The branched water-soluble polymer-modified sugar, when interposed between the<br>
peptide (or glycosyl residue) and the modifying group on the sugar becomes what is referred<br>
to herein as "a glycosyl linking group." The glycosyl linking group can be "intact", or it may<br><br>
be altered during the attachment of the branched water-soluble polymer to the sugar, e.g.,<br>
oxidized and reductively aminated. Using the exquisite selectivity of enzymes, such as<br>
glycosyltransferases, the present method provides peptides that bear a branched water-soluble<br>
polymer at one or more specific locations. Thus, according to the present invention, a<br>
modified sugar is attached directly to a selected locus on the peptide chain or, alternatively,<br>
the modified sugar is appended onto a carbohydrate moiety of a glycopeptide. Peptides in<br>
which modified sugars are bound to both a glycopeptide carbohydrate and directly to an<br>
amino acid residue of the peptide backbone are also within the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0143] In contrast to known chemical and enzymatic peptide elaboration strategies, the<br>
invention provides peptide- and glycopeptide-conjugates that have a substantially<br>
homogeneous derivatization pattern; the enzymes used in the invention are generally<br>
selective for a particular amino acid residue or combination of amino acid residues of the<br>
peptide. The conjugates of the invention can also be prepared using on a large-scale. Thus,<br>
the methods of the invention provide a practical means for large-scale preparation of<br>
glycopeptides having preselected uniform derivatization patterns. The methods are<br>
particularly well suited for modification of therapeutic peptides, including but not limited to,<br>
glycopeptides that are incompletely glycosylated during production in cell culture cells (e.g.,<br>
mammalian cells, insect cells, plant cells, fungal cells, yeast cells, or prokaryotic cells) or<br>
transgenic plants or animals.<br>
[0144] The branched water-soluble polymer conjugates of peptides are generally<br>
characterized as having increased therapeutic half-life due to, for example, reduced clearance<br>
rate, or reduced rate of uptake by the immune or reticuloendothelial system (RES).<br>
Moreover, antigenic determinants on the peptide component of the conjugates of the<br>
invention are masked by the branched water-soluble polymer, reducing or eliminating a host<br>
immune response to the peptide. Selective attachment of targeting agents to a peptide using<br>
an appropriate modified sugar can also be used to target a peptide to a particular tissue or cell<br>
surface receptor that is specific for the particular targeting agent.<br>
[0145] The in vivo half-life of therapeutic glycopeptides can also be enhanced with<br>
branched water-soluble polymers that include polyethylene glycol (PEG, m-PEG) and<br>
polypropylene glycol (PPG). For example, chemical modification of proteins with branched<br>
PEG (PEG-ylation, m-PEG-ylation) increases their molecular size and decreases their<br>
surface- and functional group-accessibility, each of which are dependent on the size of the<br><br>
PEG attached to the protein. Modification of peptides with water-soluble polymers is<br>
generally recognized as a promising strategy for improving plasma half-lives and in<br>
proteolytic-stability, and a decrease in immunogenicity and hepatic uptake (Chaffee et al. J.<br>
Clin. Invest. 89: 1643-1651 (1992); Pyatak et al. Res. Commun. Chen. Pathol Pharmacol.<br>
29: 113-127 (1980)). PEGylation of interleukin-2 has been reported to increase its antitumor<br>
potency in vivo (Katre et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 84: 1487-1491 (1987)) and PEG-<br>
ylation of a F(ab')2 derived from the monoclonal antibody A7 has improved its tumor<br>
localization (Kitamura et al. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 28: 1387-1394 (1990)). Thus,<br>
in another preferred embodiment, the in vivo half-life of a peptide derivatized with a water-<br>
soluble polymer by a method of the invention is increased relevant to the in vivo half-life of<br>
the non-derivatized peptide.<br>
[0146] The increase in peptide in vivo half-life of conjugates of the invention is best<br>
expressed as a range of percent increase in this quantity. The lower end of the range of<br>
percent increase is about 40%, about 60%, about 80%, about 100%, about 150% or about<br>
200%. The upper end of the range is about 60%, about 80%, about 100%, about 150%, or<br>
more than about 250%.<br>
[0147] In an exemplary embodiment, the link between the peptide and the selected moiety<br>
includes an intact glycosyl linking group interposed between the peptide and the water-<br>
soluble polymer. As discussed herein, attachment of the water-soluble polymer to a sugar<br>
moiety (or the use of a sugar branch core) provides a "modified sugar" that is recognized by<br>
an appropriate transferase enzyme, which appends the modified sugar onto the peptide. The<br>
saccharide component of the modified sugar, when interposed between the peptide and a<br>
selected moiety, becomes a "glycosyl linking group," e.g., an "intact glycosyl linking group."<br>
The glycosyl linking group is formed from any mono- or oligo-saccharide that, after<br>
modification with a water-soluble polymer, is a substrate for an appropriate transferase.<br>
[0148] The conjugates of the invention will typically correspond to the general structure:<br><br>
in which the symbols a, b, c, d and s represent a positive, non-zero integer; and t is either 0 or<br>
a positive integer. The "agent" is a branched water-soluble polymer of the invention.<br>
Alternatively, the sugar-agent is provided by a branched water-soluble polymer based on a<br>
saccharide branch core. The linker can be any of a wide array of linking groups, infra.<br><br>
Alternatively, the linker may be a single bond or a "zero order linker." The identity of the<br>
peptide is without limitation.<br>
[0149] In an exemplary embodiment, the water-soluble polymer is PEG, m-PEG, PPG, or<br>
m-PPG, and the branched water-soluble polymer is covalently attached to the peptide via an<br>
intact glycosyl linking group. The glycosyl linking group is covalently attached to either an<br>
amino acid residue or a glycosyl residue of the peptide. Alternatively, the glycosyl linking<br>
group is attached to one or more glycosyl units of a glycopeptide. The invention also<br>
provides conjugates in which the glycosyl linking group (e.g., GalNAc) is attached to an<br>
amino acid residue (e.g., Thr or Ser).<br>
[0150] hi addition to providing conjugates that are formed through an enzymatically added<br>
intact glycosyl linking group, the present invention provides conjugates that are highly<br>
homogenous in their substitution patterns. Using the methods of the invention, it is possible<br>
to form peptide conjugates in which essentially all of the modified sugar moieties across a<br>
population of conjugates of the invention are attached to a structurally identical amino acid or<br>
glycosyl residue. Thus, in a second aspect, the invention provides a peptide conjugate having<br>
a population of branched water-soluble polymer moieties, which are covalently bound to the<br>
peptide through a glycosyl linking group, e.g., an intact glycosyl linking group. In a<br>
preferred conjugate of the invention, essentially each member of the population is bound via<br>
the glycosyl linking group to a glycosyl residue of the peptide, and each glycosyl residue of<br>
the peptide to which the glycosyl linking group is attached has the same structure.<br>
[0151] Also provided is a peptide conjugate having a population of branched water-soluble<br>
polymer moieties covalently bound thereto through an intact glycosyl linking group. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, essentially every member of the population of branched water soluble<br>
polymer moieties is bound to an amino acid residue of the peptide via an intact glycosyl<br>
linking group, and each amino acid residue having an intact glycosyl linking group attached<br>
thereto has the same structure.<br>
[0152] The present invention also provides conjugates analogous to those described above<br>
in which the peptide is further conjugated to a therapeutic moiety, diagnostic moiety,<br>
targeting moiety, toxin moiety or the like via an intact glycosyl linking group. Each of the<br>
above-recited moieties can be a small molecule, natural polymer (e.g., polypeptide) or<br>
synthetic polymer.<br><br>
[0153] In a still further embodiment, the invention provides conjugates that localize<br>
selectively in a particular tissue due to the presence of a targeting agent as a component of the<br>
conjugate. In an exemplary embodiment, the targeting agent is a protein. Exemplary<br>
proteins include transferrin (brain, blood-pool), HS-glycoprotein (bone, brain, blood pool),<br>
antibodies (brain, tissue with antibody-specific antigen, blood pool), coagulation factors V-<br>
XII (damaged tissue, clots, cancer, blood pool), serum proteins, e.g., -acid glycoprotein,<br>
fetuin, -fetal protein (brain, blood pool), p2-glycoprotein (liver, atherosclerosis plaques,<br>
brain, blood pool), G-CSF, GM-CSF, M-CSF, and EPO (immune stimulation, cancers, blood<br>
pool, red blood cell overproduction, neuroprotection), albumin (increase in half-life), IL-2<br>
and IFN-.<br>
[0154] In exemplary embodiments, the conjugate is formed between a branched water-<br>
soluble polymer and a glycosylated or non-glycosylated peptide. The polymer, therapeutic<br>
moiety or biomolecule is conjugated to the peptide via an intact glycosyl linking group,<br>
which is interposed between, and covalently linked to both the peptide and the modifying<br>
group (e.g. water-soluble polymer). The method includes contacting the peptide with a<br>
mixture containing a modified sugar and a glycosyltransferase for which the modified sugar<br>
is a substrate. The reaction is conducted under conditions sufficient to form a covalent bond<br>
between the modified sugar and the peptide. The sugar moiety of the modified sugar is<br>
preferably selected from nucleotide sugars, activated sugars and sugars, which are neither<br>
nucleotides nor activated.<br>
[0155] The acceptor peptide (glycosylated or non-glycosylated) is typically synthesized de<br>
novo, or recombinantly expressed in a prokaryotic cell {e.g., bacterial cell, such as E. coli) or<br>
in a eukaryotic cell such as a mammalian, yeast, insect, fungal or plant cell. The peptide can<br>
be either a full-length protein or a fragment. Moreover, the peptide can be a wild type or<br>
mutated peptide. In an exemplary embodiment, the peptide includes a mutation that adds<br>
one or more consensus glycosylation sites to the peptide sequence.<br>
[0156] The method of the invention also provides for modification of incompletely<br>
glycosylated peptides that are produced recombinantly. Many recombinantly produced<br>
glycoproteins are incompletely glycosylated, exposing carbohydrate residues that may have<br>
undesirable properties, e.g., immunogenicity, recognition by the RES. Employing a modified<br>
sugar in a method of the invention, the peptide can be simultaneously further glycosylated<br>
and derivatized with, e.g., a water-soluble polymer, therapeutic agent, or the like. The sugar<br><br>
moiety of the modified sugar can be the residue that would properly be conjugated to the<br>
acceptor in a fully glycosylated peptide, or another sugar moiety with desirable properties.<br>
[0157] Exemplary peptides components of the conjugates of the invention are set forth in<br>
Table 1.<br><br>
[0158] Other exemplary peptides components of conjugates of the invention include<br>
members of the immunoglobulin family (e.g., antibodies, MHC molecules, T cell receptors,<br>
and the like), intercellular receptors (e.g., integrins, receptors for hormones or growth factors<br>
and the like) lectins, and cytokines (e.g., interleukins). Additional examples include<br>
tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), renin, clotting factors such as factors V-XII,<br><br>
bombesin, thrombin, hematopoietic growth factor, colony stimulating factors, viral antigens,<br>
complement proteins, 1-antitrypsin, erythropoietin, P-selectin glycopeptide ligand-1<br>
(PSGL-1), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, anti-thrombin HI, interleukins,<br>
interferons, proteins A and C, fibrinogen, herceptin, leptin, glycosidases, HS-glycoprotein,<br>
serum proteins (e.g., -acid glycoprotein, fetuin, -fetal protein), p2-glycoprotein, among<br>
many others. This list of polypeptides is exemplary, not exclusive. The peptide component<br>
of the conjugate can also include fusion and chimeric proteins, including, but not limited to,<br>
chimeric proteins that include a moiety derived from an immunoglobulin, such as IgG, or a<br>
fragment of an immunoglobin, e.g., FAb (Fc domain). Still further exemplary peptides,<br>
which can be modified by the methods of the invention are set forth in Appendix 1. The<br>
exemplary peptides provided herein are intended to provide a selection of the peptides with<br>
which the present invention can be practiced; as such, they are non-limiting. Those of skill<br>
will appreciate that the invention can be practiced using substantially any peptide from any<br>
source.<br>
[0159] Peptides components of the conjugates of the invention can be synthetic or wild-<br>
type peptides or they can be mutated peptides, produced by methods known in the art, such as<br>
site-directed mutagenesis. Glycosylation of peptides is typically either N-linked or O-linked.<br>
An exemplary N-linkage is the attachment of the modified sugar to the side chain of an<br>
asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-<br>
threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for<br>
enzymatic attachment of a carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the<br>
presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential<br>
glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one sugar (e.g., N-<br>
aceylgalactosamine, galactose, mannose, GlcNAc, glucose, fucose or xylose) to a the<br>
hydroxy side chain of a hydroxyamino acid, preferably serine or threonine, although 5-<br>
hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.<br>
[0160] Moreover, in addition to peptides, component of the conjugate that is conjugated<br>
with the branched water-soluble polymer of the present invention can be a biological<br>
structure other than a peptide (e.g., glycolipids, lipids, sphingoids, ceramides, whole cells,<br>
and the like).<br>
[0161 ] Addition of glycosylation sites to a peptide or other structure is conveniently<br>
accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more<br>
glycosylation sites. The addition may be made by mutation or by full chemical synthesis of<br><br>
the peptide. The peptide amino acid sequence is preferably altered through changes at the<br>
DNA level, particularly by mutating the DNA encoding the peptide at preselected bases such<br>
that codons are generated that will translate into the desired amino acids. The DNA<br>
mutation(s) are preferably made using methods known in the art.<br>
[0162] In an exemplary embodiment, the glycosylation site is added by shuffling<br>
polynucleotides. Polynucleotides encoding a candidate peptide can be modulated with DNA<br>
shuffling protocols. DNA shuffling is a process of recursive recombination and mutation,<br>
performed by random fragmentation of a pool of related genes, followed by reassembly of the<br>
fragments by a polymerase chain reaction-like process. See, e.g., Stemmer, Proc. Natl. Acad.<br>
Sci. USA 91:10747-10751 (1994); Stemmer, Nature 370:389-391 (1994); and U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 5,605,793, 5,837,458, 5,830,721 and 5,811,238.<br>
[0163] The conjugates of the invention may also include a peptide to which has been<br>
added, or from which has been removed, one or more selected glycosyl residues, after which<br>
a modified sugar is conjugated to at least one of the selected glycosyl residues of the peptide.<br>
The present embodiment is useful, for example, when it is desired to conjugate the modified<br>
sugar to a selected glycosyl residue that is either not present on a peptide or is not present in a<br>
desired amount. Thus, prior to coupling a modified sugar to a peptide, the selected glycosyl<br>
residue is conjugated to the peptide by enzymatic or chemical coupling. In another<br>
embodiment, the glycosylation pattern of a glycopeptide is altered prior to the conjugation of<br>
the modified sugar by the removal of a carbohydrate residue from the glycopeptide. See, for<br>
example WO 98/31826.<br>
[0164] Addition or removal of any carbohydrate moieties present on the glycopeptide is<br>
accomplished either chemically or enzymatically. Chemical deglycosylation is preferably<br>
brought about by exposure of the polypeptide variant to the compound<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, or an equivalent compound. This treatment results in the<br>
cleavage of most or all sugars except the linking sugar (N-acetylglucosamine or N-<br>
acetylgalactosamine), while leaving the peptide intact. Chemical deglycosylation is<br>
described by Hakimuddin et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 259: 52 (1987) and by Edge et al.,<br>
Anal. Biochem. 118: 131 (1981). Enzymatic cleavage of carbohydrate moieties on<br>
polypeptide variants can be achieved by the use of a variety of endo- and exo-glycosidases as<br>
described by Thotakura et al, Meth. Enzymol. 138: 350 (1987).<br><br>
[0165] Chemical addition of glycosyJ moieties is carried out by any art-recognized method.<br>
Enzymatic addition of sugar moieties is preferably achieved using a modification of the<br>
methods set forth herein, substituting native glycosyl units for the modified sugars used in the<br>
invention. Other methods of adding sugar moieties are disclosed in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,876,980, 6,030,815,5,728,554, and 5,922,577.<br>
[O166] Exemplary attachment points for selected glycosyl residue include, but are not<br>
limited to: (a) consensus sites for N- and O-glycosylation; (b) terminal glycosyl moieties that<br>
are acceptors for a glycosyltransferase; (c) arginine, asparagine and histidine; (d) free<br>
carboxyl groups; (e) free sulfhydryl groups such as those of cysteine; (f) free hydroxyl groups<br>
such as those of serine, threonine, or hydroxyproline; (g) aromatic residues such as those of<br>
phenylalanine, tyrosine, or tryptophan; or (h) the amide group of glutamine. Exemplary<br>
methods of use in the present invention are described in WO 87/05330 published Sep. 11,<br>
1987, and in Aplin and Wriston, CRC CRIT. REV. BIOCHEM., pp. 259-306 (1981).<br>
[0167] In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for linking two or more<br>
peptides through a linking group. The linking group is of any useful structure and may be<br>
selected from straight-chain and branched chain structures. Preferably, each terminus of the<br>
linker, which is attached to a peptide, includes a modified sugar (i.e., a nascent intact glycosyl<br>
linking group).<br>
[0168] In an exemplary method of the invention, two peptides are linked together via a<br>
linker moiety that includes a branched water-soluble polymer linker. The construct conforms<br>
to the general structure set forth in the cart00n above. As described herein, the construct of<br>
the invention includes two intact glycosyl linking groups (i.e., s +t = 1). The focus on a PEG<br>
linker that includes two glycosyl groups is for purposes of clarity and should not be<br>
interpreted as limiting the identity of linker arms of use in this embodiment of the invention.<br>
Modified Sugars<br>
[0169] Modified glycosyl donor species ("modified sugars") are preferably selected from<br>
modified sugar nucleotides, activated modified sugars and modified sugars that are simple<br>
saccharides that are neither nucleotides nor activated. Any desired carbohydrate structure can<br>
be incorporated into a conjugate of the invention. Typically, the structure will be a<br>
monosaccharide, but the present invention is not limited to the use of modified<br>
monosaccharide sugars; oligosaccharides and polysaccharides are useful as well.<br><br>
[0170] The modifying group is attached to a sugar moiety by enzymatic means, chemical<br>
means or a combination thereof, thereby producing a modified sugar. The sugars are<br>
substituted at any position that allows for the attachment of the modifying moiety, yet which<br>
still allows the sugar to function as a substrate for the enzyme used to ligate the modified<br>
sugar to the peptide. In a preferred embodiment, when sialic acid is the sugar, the sialic acid<br>
is substituted with the modifying group at either the 9-position on the pyruvyl side chain or at<br>
the 5-position on the amine moiety that is normally acetylated in sialic acid.<br>
[0171] In certain embodiments of the present invention, a modified sugar nucleotide is<br>
utilized to add the modified sugar to the peptide. Exemplary sugar nucleotides that are used<br>
in the present invention in their modified form include nucleotide mono-, di- or triphosphates<br>
or analogs thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the modified sugar nucleotide is selected<br>
from a UDP-glycoside, CMP-glycoside, or a GDP-glycoside. Even more preferably, the<br>
modified sugar nucleotide is selected from an UDP-galactose, UDP-galactosamine, UDP-<br>
glucose, UDP-glucosamine, GDP-mannose, GDP-fucose, CMP-sialic acid, or CMP-NeuAc.<br>
N-acetylamine derivatives of the sugar nucletides are also of use in the method of the<br>
invention.<br>
[0172] The invention also provides methods for synthesizing a modified peptide using a<br>
modified sugar, e.g., modified-galactose, -fucose, -GalNAc and -sialic acid. When a<br>
modified sialic acid is used, either a sialyltransferase or a trans-sialidase (for 2,3-linked<br>
sialic acid only) can be used in these methods.<br>
[0173] In other embodiments, the modified sugar is an activated sugar. Activated modified<br>
sugars, which are useful in the present invention are typically glycosides which have been<br>
synthetically altered to include an activated leaving group. As used herein, the term<br>
"activated leaving group" refers to those moieties, which are easily displaced in enzyme-<br>
regulated nucleophilic substitution reactions. Many activated sugars are known in the art.<br>
See, for example, Vocadlo et al., In CARBOHYDRATE CHEMISTRY AND BIOLOGY, Vol. 2, Ernst<br>
et al. Ed., Wiley-VCH Verlag: Weinheim, Germany, 2O00; Kodama et al., Tetrahedron Lett.<br>
34: 6419 (1993); Lougheed, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 274: 37717 (1999)).<br>
[0174] Examples of activating groups (leaving groups) include fluoro, chloro, bromo,<br>
tosylate ester, mesylate ester, triflate ester and the like. Preferred activated leaving groups,<br>
for use in the present invention, are those that do not significantly sterically encumber the<br>
enzymatic transfer of the glycoside to the acceptor. Accordingly, preferred embodiments of<br><br>
activated glycoside derivatives include glycosyl fluorides and glycosyl mesylates, with<br>
glycosyl fluorides being particularly preferred. among the glycosyl fluorides, -galactosyl<br>
fluoride, -mannosyl fluoride, -glucosyl fluoride, -fucosyl fluoride, -xylosyl fluoride, -<br>
sialyl fluoride, -N-acetylglucosaminyl fluoride, -N-acetylgalactosaminyl fluoride, -<br>
galactosyl fluoride, -mannosyl fluoride, -glucosyl fluoride, -fucosyl fluoride, -xylosyl<br>
fluoride, -sialyl fluoride, -N-acetylglucosaminyl fluoride and -N-acetylgalactosaminyl<br>
fluoride are most preferred.<br>
[0175] By way of illustration, glycosyl fluorides can be prepared from the free sugar by<br>
first acetylating the sugar and then treating it with HF/pyridine. This generates the<br>
thermodynamically most stable anomer of the protected (acetylated) glycosyl fluoride (i.e.,<br>
the -glycosyl fluoride). If the less stable anomer (i.e., the -glycosyl fluoride) is desired, it<br>
can be prepared by converting the peracetylated sugar with HBr/HOac or with HCI to<br>
generate the anomeric bromide or chloride. This intermediate is reacted with a fluoride salt<br>
such as silver fluoride to generate the glycosyl fluoride. acetylated glycosyl fluorides may<br>
be deprotected by reaction with mild (catalytic) base in methanol (e.g. NaOMe/MeOH). In<br>
addition, many glycosyl fluorides are commercially available.<br>
[0176] Other activated glycosyl derivatives can be prepared using conventional methods<br>
known to those of skill in the art. For example, glycosyl mesylates can be prepared by<br>
treatment of the fully benzylated hemiacetal form of the sugar with mesyl chloride, followed<br>
by catalytic hydrogenation to remove the benzyl groups.<br>
[0177] In a further exemplary embodiment, the modified sugar is an oligosaccharide having<br>
an antennary structure. In a preferred embodiment, one or more of the termini of the<br>
antennae bear the modifying moiety. When more than one modifying moiety is attached to<br>
an oligosaccharide having an antennary structure, the oligosaccharide is useful to "amplify"<br>
the modifying moiety; each oligosaccharide unit conjugated to the peptide attaches multiple<br>
copies of the modifying group to the peptide. The general structure of a typical conjugate of<br>
the invention as set forth in the drawing above, encompasses multivalent species resulting<br>
from preparing a conjugate of the invention utilizing an antennary structure. Many antennary<br>
saccharide structures are known in the art, and the present method can be practiced with them<br>
without limitation.<br>
[0178] In general, the sugar moiety and the modifying group are linked together through<br>
the use of reactive groups, which are typically transformed by the linking process into a new<br><br>
organic functional group or unreactive species. The sugar reactive functional group(s), is<br>
located at any position on the sugar moiety.<br>
[0179] In the discussion that follows, a number of specific examples of modified sugars<br>
that are useful in practicing the present invention are set forth. In the exemplary<br>
embodiments, a sialic acid derivative is utilized as the sugar nucleus to which the modifying<br>
group is attached. The focus of the discussion on sialic acid derivatives is for clarity of<br>
illustration only and should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention. Those of<br>
skill in the art will appreciate that a variety of other sugar moieties can be activated and<br>
derivatized in a manner analogous to that set forth using sialic acid as an example. For<br>
example, numerous methods are available for modifying galactose, glucose, N-<br>
acetylgalactosamine and fucose to name a few sugar substrates, which are readily modified<br>
by art recognized methods. See, for example, Elhalabi et ah, Curr. Med. Chem. 6: 93 (1999);<br>
and Schafer et al., J. Org. Chem. 65: 24 (2000)).<br>
[0180] In an exemplary embodiment, the peptide that is modified by a method of the<br>
invention is a glycopeptide that is produced in prokaryotic cells (e.g., E. coli), eukaryotic<br>
cells including yeast and mammalian cells (e.g., CHO cells), or in a transgenic animal and<br>
thus contains N- and/or O-linked oligosaccharide chains, which are incompletely sialylated.<br>
The oligosaccharide chains of the glycopeptide lacking a sialic acid and containing a terminal<br>
galactose residue can be glyco-PEG-ylated, glyco-PPG-ylated or otherwise modified with a<br>
modified sialic acid.<br>
[0181] In Scheme 2, the amino glycoside 1, is treated with the active ester of a protected<br>
amino acid (e.g., glycine) derivative, converting the sugar amine residue into the<br>
corresponding protected amino acid amide adduct. The adduct is treated with an aldolase to<br>
form -hydroxy carboxylate 2. Compound 2 is converted to the corresponding CMP<br>
derivative by the action of CMP-SA synthetase, followed by catalytic hydrogenation of the<br>
CMP derivative to produce compound 3. The amine introduced via formation of the glycine<br>
adduct is utilized as a locus of PEG or PPG attachment by reacting compound 3 with an<br>
activated (m-) PEG or (m-) PPG derivative (e.g., PEG-C(O)NHS, PPG-C(O)NHS),<br>
producing 4 or 5, respectively.<br><br><br>
in which X-BWSP is an activated branched water-soluble polymer of the invention, and<br>
BWSP is a branched water-soluble polymer.<br>
[0182] Table 2 sets forth representative examples of sugar monophosphates that are<br>
derivatized with a PEG or PPG moiety. Certain of the compounds of Table 2 are prepared by<br>
the method of Scheme 4. Other derivatives are prepared by art-recognized methods. See, for<br>
example, Keppler et al., Glycobiology 11: 11R (2001); and Charter et al., Glycobiology 10:<br>
1049 (2000)). Other amine reactive PEG and PPG analogues are commercially available, or<br>
they can be prepared by methods readily accessible to those of skill in the art.<br><br><br><br><br>
in which R is a branched water-soluble polymer of the present invention.<br>
[0183] The modified sugar phosphates of use in practicing the present invention can be<br>
substituted in other positions as well as those set forth above. Presently preferred<br>
substitutions of sialic acid are set forth below:<br><br>
in which X is a linking group, which is preferably selected from -O-, -N(H)-, -S, CH2-, and -<br>
N(R)2, in which each R is a member independently selected from Rl-R5. The symbols Y, Z,<br>
A and B each represent a group that is selected from the group set forth above for the identity<br><br>
of X. X, Y, Z, A and B are each independently selected and, therefore, they can be the same<br>
or different. The symbols R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 represent H, or a branched water-soluble<br>
polymer. Alternatively, these symbols represent a linker that is bound to a branched water-<br>
soluble polymer.<br>
Cross-linking Groups<br>
[0184] Preparation of the modified sugar for use in the methods of the present invention<br>
includes attachment of a modifying group to a sugar residue and forming a stable adduct,<br>
which is a substrate for a glycosyltransferase. The sugar and modifying group can be coupled<br>
by a zero- or higher-order cross-linking agent. Exemplary bifunctional compounds which<br>
can be used for attaching modifying groups to carbohydrate moieties include, but are not<br>
limited to, bifunctional poly(ethyleneglycols), polyamides, polyethers, polyesters and the<br>
like. General approaches for linking carbohydrates to other molecules are known in the<br>
literature. See, for example, Lee et al., Biochemistiy 28: 1856 (1989); Bhatia et al, Anal.<br>
Biochem. 178: 408 (1989); Janda et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 112: 8886 (1990) and Bednarski et<br>
al, WO 92/18135. In the discussion that follows, the reactive groups are treated as benign on<br>
the sugar moiety of the nascent modified sugar. The focus of the discussion is for clarity of<br>
illustration. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that the discussion is relevant to reactive<br>
groups on the modifying group as well.<br>
[0185] An exemplary strategy involves incorporation of a protected sulfhydryl onto the<br>
sugar using the heterobifunctional crosslinker SPDP (n-succinimidyl-3-(2-<br>
pyridyldithio)propionate and then deprotecting the sulfhydryl for formation of a disulfide<br>
bond with another sulfhydryl on the modifying group.<br>
[0186] If SPDP detrimentally affects the ability of the modified sugar to act as a<br>
glycosyltransferase substrate, one of an array of other crosslinkers such as 2-iminothiolane or<br>
N-succinimidyl S-acetylthioacetate (SATA) is used to form a disulfide bond. 2-<br>
iminothiolane reacts with primary amines, instantly incorporating an unprotected sulfhydryl<br>
onto the amine-containing molecule. SATA also reacts with primary amines, but<br>
incorporates a protected sulfhydryl, which is later deacetaylated using hydroxylamine to<br>
produce a free sulfhydryl. In each case, the incorporated sulfhydryl is free to react with other<br>
sulfhydryls or protected sulfhydryl, like SPDP, forming the required disulfide bond.<br>
[0187] The above-described strategy is exemplary, and not limiting, of linkers of use in the<br>
invention. Other crosslinkers are available that can be used in different strategies for<br><br>
crosslinking the modifying group to the peptide. For example, TPCH(S-(2-thiopyridyl)-L-<br>
cysteine hydrazide and TPMPH ((S-(2-thiopyridyl) mercapto-propionohydrazide) react with<br>
carbohydrate moieties that have been previously oxidized by mild periodate treatment, thus<br>
forming a hydrazone bond between the hydrazide portion of the crosslinker and the periodate<br>
generated aldehydes. ITCH and TPMPH introduce a 2-pyridylthione protected sulfhydryl<br>
group onto the sugar, which can be deprotected with DTT and then subsequently used for<br>
conjugation, such as forming disulfide bonds between components.<br>
[0188] If disulfide bonding is found unsuitable for producing stable modified sugars, other<br>
crosslinkers may be used that incorporate more stable bonds between components. The<br>
heterobifunctional crosslinkers GMBS (N-gama-malimidobutyryloxy)succiriimide) and<br>
SMCC (succinimidyl 4-(N-maIeimido-methyl)cyclohexane) react with primary amines, thus<br>
introducing a maleimide group onto the component. The maleimide group can subsequently<br>
react with sulfhydryls on the other component, which can be introduced by previously<br>
mentioned crosslinkers, thus forming a stable thioether bond between the components. If<br>
steric hindrance between components interferes with either component's activity or the ability<br>
of the modified sugar to act as a glycosyltransferase substrate, crosslinkers can be used which<br>
introduce long spacer arms between components and include derivatives of some of the<br>
previously mentioned crosslinkers (i.e., SPDP). Thus, there is an abundance of suitable<br>
crosslinkers, which are useful; each of which is selected depending on the effects it has on<br>
optimal peptide conjugate and modified sugar production.<br>
[0189] A variety of reagents are used to modify the components of the modified sugar with<br>
intramolecular chemical crosslinks (for reviews of crosslinking reagents and crosslinking<br>
procedures see: Wold, F., Meth. Enzymol. 25: 623-651, 1972; Weetall, H. H., and C00ney, D.<br>
A., In: ENZYMES AS DRUGS. (Holcenberg, and Roberts, eds.) pp. 395-442, Wiley, New York,<br>
1981; Ji, T. H., Meth. Enzymol 91: 58O-6O9, 1983; Mattson et al, Mol. Biol. Rep. 17: 167-<br>
183, 1993, all of which are incorporated herein by reference). Preferred crosslinking reagents<br>
are derived from various zero-length, homo-bifunctional, and hetero-bifunctional crosslinking<br>
reagents. Zero-length crosslinking reagents include direct conjugation of two intrinsic<br>
chemical groups with no introduction of extrinsic material. Agents that catalyze formation of<br>
a disulfide bond belong to this category. Another example is reagents that induce<br>
condensation of a carboxyl and a primary amino group to form an amide bond such as<br>
carbodiimides, ethylchloroformate. W00dward's reagent K (2-ethyl-5-phenylisoxazolium-3'-<br>
sulfonate), and carbonyldiimidazole. In addition to these chemical reagents, the enzyme<br><br>
transglutaminase (glutamyl-peptide -glutamyltransferase; EC 2.3.2.13) may be used as zero-<br>
length crosslinking reagent. This enzyme catalyzes acyl transfer reactions at carboxamide<br>
groups of protein-bound glutaminyl residues, usually with a primary amino group as<br>
substrate. Preferred homo- and hetero-biflinctional reagents contain two identical or two<br>
dissimilar sites, respectively, which may be reactive for amino, sulfhydryl, guanidino, indole,<br>
or nonspecific groups.<br>
i. Preferred Specific Sites in Crosslinking Reagents<br>
1. Amino-Reactive Groups<br>
[0190] In one preferred embodiment, the sites on the cross-linker are amino-reactive<br>
groups. Useful non-limiting examples of amino-reactive groups include N-<br>
hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters, imidoesters, isocyanates, acylhalides, arylazides, p-<br>
nitrophenyl esters, aldehydes, and sulfonyl chlorides.<br>
[0191] NHS esters react preferentially with the primary (including aromatic) amino groups<br>
of a modified sugar component. The imidazole groups of histidines are known to compete<br>
with primary amines for reaction, but the reaction products are unstable and readily<br>
hydrolyzed. The reaction involves the nucleophilic attack of an amine on the acid carboxyl<br>
of an NHS ester to form an amide, releasing the N-hydroxysuccinimide. Thus, the positive<br>
charge of the original amino group is lost.<br>
[0192] Imidoesters are the most specific acylating reagents for reaction with the amine<br>
groups of the modified sugar components. At a pH between 7 and 10, imidoesters react only<br>
with primary amines. Primary amines attack imidates nucleophilically to produce an<br>
intermediate that breaks down to amidine at high pH or to a new imidate at low pH. The new<br>
imidate can react with another primary amine, thus crosslinking two amino groups, a case of<br>
a putatively monofunctional imidate reacting bifunctionally. The principal product of<br>
reaction with primary amines is an amidine that is a stronger base than the original amine.<br>
The positive charge of the original amino group is therefore retained.<br>
[0193] Isocyanates (and isothiocyanates) react with the primary amines of the modified<br>
sugar components to form stable bonds. Their reactions with sulfhydryl, imidazole, and<br>
tyrosyl groups give relatively unstable products.<br>
[0194] Acylazides are also used as amino-specific reagents in which nucleophilic amines of<br>
the affinity component attack acidic carboxyl groups under slightly alkaline conditions, e.g.<br>
pH 8.5.<br><br>
[0195] Arylhalides such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene react preferentially with the<br>
amino groups and tyrosine phenolic groups of modified sugar components, but also with<br>
sulfhydryl and imidazole groups.<br>
[0196] p-Nitrophenyl esters of mono- and dicarboxylic acids are also useful amino-reactive<br>
groups. Although the reagent specificity is not very high, - and -amino groups appear to<br>
react most rapidly.<br>
[0197] Aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde react with primary amines of modified sugar.<br>
Although unstable Schiff bases are formed upon reaction of the amino groups with the<br>
aldehydes of the aldehydes, glutaraldehyde is capable of modifying the modified sugar with<br>
stable crosslinks. At pH 6-8, the pH of typical crosslinking conditions, the cyclic polymers<br>
undergo a dehydration to form - unsaturated aldehyde polymers. Schiff bases, however,<br>
are stable, when conjugated to another double bond. The resonant interaction of both double<br>
bonds prevents hydrolysis of the Schiff linkage. Furthermore, amines at high local<br>
concentrations can attack the ethylenic double bond to form a stable Michael addition<br>
product.<br>
[0198] Aromatic sulfonyl chlorides react with a variety of sites of the modified sugar<br>
components, but reaction with the amino groups is the most important, resulting in a stable<br>
sulfonamide linkage.<br>
2. Sulfhydryl-Reactive Groups<br>
[0199] In another preferred embodiment, the sites are sulfhydryl-reactive groups. Useful,<br>
non-limiting examples of sulfhydryl-reactive groups include maleimides, alkyl halides,<br>
pyridyl disulfides, and thiophthalimides.<br>
[0200] Maleimides react preferentially with the sulfhydryl group of the modified sugar<br>
components to form stable thioether bonds. They also react at a much slower rate with<br>
primary amino groups and the imidazole groups of histidines. However, at pH 7 the<br>
maleimide group can be considered a sulfhydryl-specific group, since at this pH the reaction<br>
rate of simple thiols is 1O00-fold greater than that of the corresponding amine.<br>
[0201] Alkyl halides react with sulfhydryl groups, sulfides, imidazoles, and amino groups.<br>
At neutral to slightly alkaline pH, however, alkyl halides react primarily with sulfhydryl<br>
groups to form stable thioether bonds. At higher pH, reaction with amino groups is favored.<br><br>
[0202] Pyridyl disulfides react with free sulfhydryls via disulfide exchange to give mixed<br>
disulfides. As a result, pyridyl disulfides are the most specific sulfhydryl-reactive groups.<br>
(0203] Thiophthalimides react with free sulfhydryl groups to form disulfides.<br>
3. Carboxyl-Reactive Residue<br>
[0204] In another embodiment, carbodiimides soluble in both water and organic solvent,<br>
are used as carboxyl-reactive reagents. These compounds react with free carboxyl groups<br>
forming a pseudourea that can then couple to available amines yielding an amide linkage<br>
teach how to modify a carboxyl group with carbodiimde (Yamada et ah, Biochemistry 20:<br>
4836-4842,1981).<br>
ii. Preferred Nonspecific Sites in Cross linking Reagents<br>
[0205] In addition to the use of site-specific reactive moieties, the present invention<br>
contemplates the use of non-specific reactive groups to link the sugar to the modifying group.<br>
[0206] Exemplary non-specific cross-linkers include photoactivatable groups, completely<br>
inert in the dark, which are converted to reactive species upon absorption of a photon of<br>
appropriate energy. In one preferred embodiment, photoactivatable groups are selected from<br>
precursors of nitrenes generated upon heating or photolysis of azides. Electron-deficient<br>
nitrenes are extremely reactive and can react with a variety of chemical bonds including N-H,<br>
O-H, C-H, and C=C. Although three types of azides (aryl, alkyl, and acyl derivatives) may<br>
be employed, arylazides are presently preferred. The reactivity of arylazides upon photolysis<br>
is better with N-H and O-H than C-H bonds. Electron-deficient arylnitrenes rapidly ring-<br>
expand to form dehydroazepines, which tend to react with nucleophiles, rather than form C-H<br>
insertion products. The reactivity of arylazides can be increased by the presence of electron-<br>
withdrawing substituents such as nitro or hydroxyl groups in the ring. Such substituents push<br>
the absorption maximum of arylazides to longer wavelength. Unsubstiruted arylazides have<br>
an absorption maximum in the range of 260-280 nm, while hydroxy and nitro arylazides<br>
absorb significant light beyond 305 nm. Therefore, hydroxy and nitroarylazides are most<br>
preferable since they allow to employ less harmful photolysis conditions for the affinity<br>
component than unsubstiruted arylazides.<br>
[0207] In another preferred embodiment, photoactivatable groups are selected from<br>
fluorinated arylazides. The photolysis products of fluorinated arylazides are arylnitrenes, all<br><br>
of which undergo the characteristic reactions of this group, including C-H bond insertion,<br>
with high efficiency (Kemaet al., J. Org. Chem. 55: 364O-3647, 199O).<br>
[0208] In another embodiment, photoactivatable groups are selected from benzophenone<br>
residues. Benzophenone reagents generally give higher crosslinking yields than arylazide<br>
reagents.<br>
[0209] In another embodiment, photoactivatable groups are selected from diazo<br>
compounds, which form an electron-deficient carbene upon photolysis. These carbenes<br>
undergo a variety of reactions including insertion into C-H bonds, addition to double bonds<br>
(including aromatic systems), hydrogen attraction and c00rdination to nucleophilic centers to<br>
give carbon ions.<br>
[0210] In still another embodiment, photoactivatable groups are selected from<br>
diazopyruvates. For example, the p-nitrophenyl ester of p-nitrophenyl diazopyruvate reacts<br>
with aliphatic amines to give diazopyruvic acid amides that undergo ultraviolet photolysis to<br>
form aldehydes. The photolyzed diazopyruvate-modified affinity component will react like<br>
formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde forming crosslinks.<br>
iii. Homobifunctional Reagents<br>
1. Homobifiinctional crosslinkers reactive with primary amines<br>
[0211] Synthesis, properties, and applications of amine-reactive cross-linkers are<br>
commercially described in the literature (for reviews of crosslinking procedures and reagents,<br>
see above). Many reagents are available (e.g., Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, III.;<br>
Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo.; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR.).<br>
[0212] Preferred, non-limiting examples of homobifiinctional NHS esters include<br>
disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG), disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)<br>
suberate (BS), disuccinimidyl tartarate (DST), disulfosuccinimidyl tartarate (sulfo-DST), bis-<br>
2-(succinimidooxycarbonyloxy)ethylsulfone (BSOCOES), bis-2-(sulfosuccinimid00xy-<br>
carbonyloxy)ethylsulfone (sulfo-BSOCOES), ethylene glycolbis(succinimidylsuccinate)<br>
(EGS), ethylene glycolbis(sulfosuccinimidylsuccinate) (sulfo-EGS), dithiobis(succinimidyl-<br>
propionate (DSP), and dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate (sulfo-DSP). Preferred, non-<br>
limiting examples of homobifiinctional imidoesters include dimethyl malonimidate (DMM),<br>
dimethyl succinimidate (DMSC), dimethyl adipimidate (DMA), dimethyl pimelimidate<br>
(DMP), dimethyl suberimidate (DMS), dimethyl-3,3'-oxydipropionimidate (DODP),<br>
dimethyl-3,3'-(methylenedioxy)dipropionimidate(DMDP), dimethyl-,3'-<br><br>
(dimethylenedioxy)dipropionimidate(DDDP), dimethyl-3,3'-(tetramethylenedioxy)-<br>
dipropionimidate (DTDP), and dimethyl-3,3'-dithiobispropionimidate (DTBP).<br>
[0213] Preferred, non-limiting examples of homobifunctional isothiocyanates include: p-<br>
phenylenediisothiocyanate (DITC), and 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2,-disulfonic acid stilbene<br>

literature (for reviews of crosslinking procedures and reagents, see above). Many of the<br>
reagents are commercially available (e.g., Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, III.; Sigma<br>

[0228] Synthesis, properties, and applications of such reagents are described in the<br>
literature. Preferred, non-limiting examples of hetero-bifunctional reagents with a maleimide<br>
moiety and an amino-reactive NHS ester include succinimidyl maleimidylacetate (AMAS),<br>

3. Amino-Reactive HeteroBifunctional Reagents with an Alkyl Halide Moiety<br>
[0229] Synthesis, properties, and applications of such reagents are described in the<br>
literature Preferred, non-limiting examples of hetero-bifunctional reagents with an alkyl<br>
halide moiety and an amino-reactive NHS ester include N-succinimidyl-(4-<br>

SDBP introduces intramolecular crosslinks to the affinity component by conjugating its<br>
amino groups. The reactivity of the dibromopropionyl moiety towards primary amine groups<br>

(1988)).<br>
[0231] Preferred, non-limiting examples of hetero-bifunctional reagents with an alkyl<br>
halide moiety and an amino-reactive p-nitrophenyl ester moiety include p-nitrophenyl<br>

[0232] Other cross-linking agents are known to those of skill in the art. See, for example,<br>
Pomato et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,965,106. It is within the abilities of one of skill in the art to<br>
choose an appropriate cross-linking agent for a particular application.<br>
v. Cleavable Linker Groups<br>
[0233] In yet a further embodiment, the linker group is provided with a group that can be<br>
cleaved to release the modifying group from the sugar residue. Many cleaveable groups are<br>
known in the art. See, for example, Jung et al., Biochem. Biophys. Acta 761: 152-162 (1983);<br><br>
Joshi et al, J. Biol. Chem. 265: 14518-14525 (1990); Zarling et al, J. Immunol. 124: 913-920<br>
(1980); Bouizar et al, Eur. J. Biochem. 155: 141-147 (1986); Park et al, J. Biol. Chem. 261:<br>
205-210 (1986); Browning et al.,J. Immunol. 143: 1859-1867 (1989). Moreover a broad<br>
range of cleavable, bifunctional (both homo- and hetero-bifunctional) linker groups is<br>
commercially available from suppliers such as Pierce.<br>
[0234] Exemplary cleaveable moieties can be cleaved using light, heat or reagents such as<br>
thiols, hydroxylamine, bases, periodate and the like. Moreover, certain preferred groups are<br>
cleaved in vivo in response to being endocytized (e.g., cis-aconityl; see, Shen et al., Biochem.<br>
Biophys. Res. Commun. 102: 1048 (1991)). Preferred cleaveable groups comprise a<br>
cleaveable moiety which is a member selected from the group consisting of disulfide, ester,<br>
imide, carbonate, nitrobenzyl, phenacyl and benzoin groups.<br>
The Methods<br>
[0235] The invention also provides a method of preparing an essentially mono-disperse<br>
population of poly(ethylene glycol) molecules. The method includes contacting a PEG<br>
molecule with a well-defined molecular weight, e.g., PEG200 with at least two equivalents of<br>
a bifunctional activated PEG that also has a well-defined molecular weight, e.g., PEG200,<br>
thereby producing a mono-disperse sample of a PEG, e.g., PEG600:<br><br>
G is a leaving group, such as a sulfonate or tresylate ester. The mono-disperse sample of<br>
PEG600 can then be contacted with the bifunctional activated PEG200 to form a mono-<br>
disperse PEG 100. Alternatively, the mono-disperse PEG600 can be converted to the<br>
corresponding bifunctional derivative and reacted with at least two equivalents of a mono-<br>
disperse di-hydroxy-PEG600, producing a mono-disperse PEG 1800. The process of the<br>
invention is repeated until a mono-disperse PEG of the desired size is obtained. The<br>
synthesis can be designed such that the molecular weight differences between the starting<br>
material and the product allow for the separation of any unreacted or partially reacted<br>
materials by size exclusion chromatography.<br><br>
Activated PEG Derivatives<br>
[0236] The present invention also provides a method of preparing a derivative of<br>
poly(ethylene glycol). The method is outlined in Scheme I:<br><br>
a. R-Y / (acid or base); b. Activation, e.g., tosylation, halo-de-<br>
hydroxylation, e.g, HX or SOX2 and reaction with PEGm; c.<br>
Activation (R'), e.g., with p-nitro-phenylchloroformate.<br>
in which the indexes m and n independently represent integers from 1 to 100,000. R is a<br>
member selected from substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted<br>
heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, alkylamine, protected alkylamine, or an<br>
activating group, e.g., triflate, tosylate and the like.<br>
[0237] R' is selected from substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted<br>
heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl<br>
and substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl. When R does not include a leaving group for<br>
activating the CH2-0 moiety to which it is attached, R' generally is, or includes, a leaving<br>
group.<br>
[0238] In an exemplary embodiment, R is lower alkyl, such as methyl. In another<br>
exemplary embodiment, R' is substituted alkyl, such a p-nitrophenyl chloroformate.<br>
[0239] In step a, the starting glycol is contacted with an activated group (R-Y) that reacts<br>
with a hydroxyl moiety of the glycol. Y is generally a leaving group, allowing placement of<br>
R on one of the hydroxyl moieties of the PEG molecule. In step b, the free hydroxyl of the<br>
resulting adduct is activated by its conversion to a group such as a halide, e.g., chloro or<br>
sulfonate ester, e.g., tosylate. The activated PEG species is contacted with another PEG<br>
moiety of the same or different degree of polymerization as the starting PEG ("PEGm"). To<br>
allow its attachment to another species, the RO-PEG(n+m) is optionally activated at the free<br>
hydroxyl moiety.<br><br>
[0240] In general, the R group is attached to the PEG moiety via a species that includes a<br>
reactive functional group. Moreover, the two poly(ethylene glycol) fragments are linked<br>
together through the use of reactive functional groups, which are typically transformed by the<br>
linking process into a new organic functional group or unreactive species. The reactive<br>
functional group(s), is located at any position on the of the poly(ethylene glycol) moiety, but<br>
is preferably at one of the termini.<br>
Conjugation of Branched Polymer-Modified Sugars to Peptides<br>
[0241] The modified sugars are conjugated to a glycosylated or non-glycosylated peptide<br>
using an appropriate enzyme to mediate the conjugation. Preferably, the concentrations of<br>
the modified donor sugar(s), enzyme(s) and acceptor peptide(s) are selected such that<br>
glycosylation proceeds until the acceptor is consumed. The considerations discussed below,<br>
while set forth in the context of a sialyltransferase, are generally applicable to other<br>
glycosyltransferase reactions.<br>
[0242] A number of methods of using glycosyltransferases to synthesize desired<br>
oligosaccharide structures are known and are generally applicable to the instant invention.<br>
Exemplary methods are described, for instance, WO 96/32491, Ito et al., PureAppl. Chew.<br>
65: 753 (1993), and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,352,670, 5,374,541, and 5,545,553.<br>
[0243] The present invention is practiced using a single glycosyltransferase or a<br>
combination of glycosyltransferases. For example, one can use a combination of a<br>
sialyltransferase and a galactosyltransferase. In those embodiments using more than one<br>
enzyme, the enzymes and substrates are preferably combined in an initial reaction mixture, or<br>
the enzymes and reagents for a second enzymatic reaction are added to the reaction medium<br>
once the first enzymatic reaction is complete or nearly complete. By conducting two<br>
enzymatic reactions in sequence in a single vessel, overall yields are improved over<br>
procedures in which an intermediate species is isolated. Moreover, cleanup and disposal of<br>
extra solvents and by-products is reduced.<br>
[0244] In a preferred embodiment, each of the first and second enzyme is a<br>
glycosyltransferase. In another preferred embodiment, one enzyme is an endoglycosidase. In<br>
an additional preferred embodiment, more than two enzymes are used to assemble the<br>
modified glycoprotein of the invention. The enzymes are used to alter a saccharide structure<br>
on the peptide at any point either before or after the addition of the modified sugar to the<br>
peptide.<br><br>
[0245] The O-linked glycosyl moieties of the conjugates of the invention are generally<br>
originate with a GalNAc moiety that is attached to the peptide. Any member of the family of<br>
GalNAc transferases can be used to bind a GalNAc moiety to the peptide (Hassan H, Bennett<br>
EP, Mandel U, Hollingsworth MA, and Clausen H (2000). Control of Mucin-Type O-<br>
Glycosylation: O-Glycan Occupancy is Directed by Substrate Specificities of Polypeptide<br>
GalNAc-Transferases. (Eds. Ernst, Hart, and Sinay). Wiley-VCH chapter "Carbohydrates in<br>
Chemistry and Biology - a Comprehension Handb00k", 273-292). The GalNAc moiety itself<br>
can be the intact glycosyl linker. Alternatively, the saccharyl residue is built out using one<br>
more enzyme and one or more appropriate glycosyl substrate for the enzyme, the modified<br>
sugar being added to the built out glycosyl moiety.<br>
[0246] In another embodiment, the method makes use of one or more exo- or<br>
endoglycosidase. The glycosidase is typically a mutant, which is engineered to form glycosyl<br>
bonds rather than cleave them. The mutant glycanase typically includes a substitution of an<br>
amino acid residue for an active site acidic amino acid residue. For example, when the<br>
endoglycanase is endo-H, the substituted active site residues will typically be Asp at position<br>
130, Glu at position 132 or a combination thereof. The amino acids are generally replaced<br>
with serine, alanine, asparagine, or glutamine.<br>
[0247] The mutant enzyme catalyzes the reaction, usually by a synthesis step that is<br>
analogous to the reverse reaction of the endoglycanase hydrolysis step. In these<br>
embodiments, the glycosyl donor molecule (e.g., a desired oligo- or mono-saccharide<br>
structure) contains a leaving group and the reaction proceeds with the addition of the donor<br>
molecule to a GlcNAc residue on the protein. For example, the leaving group can be a<br>
halogen, such as fluoride. In other embodiments, the leaving group is a Asn, or a Asn-<br>
peptide moiety. In yet further embodiments, the GlcNAc residue on the glycosyl donor<br>
molecule is modified. For example, the GlcNAc residue may comprise a 1,2 oxazoline<br>
moiety.<br>
[0248] In a preferred embodiment, each of the enzymes utilized to produce a conjugate of<br>
the invention are present in a catalytic amount. The catalytic amount of a particular enzyme<br>
varies according to the concentration of that enzyme's substrate as well as to reaction<br>
conditions such as temperature, time and pH value. Means for determining the catalytic<br>
amount for a given enzyme under preselected substrate concentrations and reaction<br>
conditions are well known to those of skill in the art.<br><br>
[0249] The temperature at which an above process is carried out can range from just above<br>
freezing to the temperature at which the most sensitive enzyme denatures. Preferred<br>
temperature ranges are about 0 °C to about 55 °C, and more preferably about 20 ° C to about<br>
30 °C. In another exemplary embodiment, one or more components of the present method<br>
are conducted at an elevated temperature using a thermophilic enzyme.<br>
[0250] The reaction mixture is maintained for a period of time sufficient for the acceptor to<br>
be glycosylated, thereby forming the desired conjugate. Some of the conjugate can often be<br>
detected after a few hours, with recoverable amounts usually being obtained within 24 hours<br>
or less. Those of skill in the art understand that the rate of reaction is dependent on a number<br>
of variable factors (e.g, enzyme concentration, donor concentration, acceptor concentration,<br>
temperature, solvent volume), which are optimized for a selected system.<br>
[0251] The present invention also provides for the industrial-scale production of modified<br>
peptides. As used herein, an industrial scale generally produces at least about 25O mg,<br>
preferably at least about 500 mg, and more preferably at least about 1 gram of finished,<br>
purified conjugate, preferably after a single reaction cycle, i.e., the conjugate is not a<br>
combination the reaction products from identical, consecutively iterated synthesis cycles.<br>
[0252] In the discussion that follows, the invention is exemplified by the conjugation of<br>
modified sialic acid moieties to a glycosylated peptide. The exemplary modified sialic acid is<br>
labeled with (m-) PEG. The focus of the following discussion on the use of PEG-modified<br>
sialic acid and glycosylated peptides is for clarity of illustration and is not intended to imply<br>
that the invention is limited to the conjugation of these two partners. One of skill understands<br>
that the discussion is generally applicable to the additions.of modified glycosyl moieties other<br>
than sialic acid. Moreover, the discussion is equally applicable to the modification of a<br>
glycosyl unit with agents other than PEG including other water-soluble polymers, therapeutic<br>
moieties, and biomolecules.<br>
[0253] An enzymatic approach can be used for the selective introduction of branched<br>
polymer mmodified-carbohydrates onto a peptide or glycopeptide. The method utilizes<br>
modified sugars containing a branched water-soluble polymer, and is combined with the<br>
appropriate glycosyltransferase or glycosynthase. By selecting the glycosyltransferase that<br>
will make the desired carbohydrate linkage and utilizing the modified sugar as the donor<br>
substrate, the branched water-soluble polymer can be introduced directly onto the peptide<br><br>
backbone, onto existing sugar residues of a glycopeptide or onto sugar residues that have<br>
been added to a peptide.<br>
[0254] An acceptor for the sialyltransferase is present on the peptide to be modified by the<br>
methods of the present invention either as a naturally occurring structure or one placed there<br>
recombinantly, enzymatically or chemically. Suitable acceptors, include, for example,<br>
galactosyl acceptors such as GalNAc, Gall,4GlcNAc, Gall,4GalNAc, Gall,3GalNAc,<br>
lacto-N-tetraose, Gall,3GlcNAc, Gall,3Ara, Gall,6GlcNAc, Gall,4Glc (lactose), and<br>
other acceptors known to those of skill in the art (see, e.g., Paulson et al, J. Biol. Chem. 253:<br>
5617-5624 (1978)).<br>
[0255] In one embodiment, an acceptor for the sialyltransferase is present on the<br>
glycopeptide to be modified upon in vivo synthesis of the glycopeptide. Such glycopeptides<br>
can be sialylated using the claimed methods without prior modification of the glycosylation<br>
pattern of the glycopeptide. Alternatively, the methods of the invention can be used to<br>
sialylate a peptide that does not include a suitable acceptor; one first modifies the peptide to<br>
include an acceptor by methods known to those of skill in the art.<br>
[0256] In an exemplary embodiment, the galactosyl acceptor is assembled by attaching a<br>
galactose residue to an appropriate acceptor linked to the peptide, e.g., a GalNAc. The<br>
method includes incubating the peptide to be modified with a reaction mixture that contains a<br>
suitable amount of a galactosyltransferase (e.g., Gall,3 or Gall,4), and a suitable<br>
galactosyl donor (e.g., UDP-galactose). The reaction is allowed to proceed substantially to<br>
completion or, alternatively, the reaction is terminated when a preselected amount of the<br>
galactose residue is added. Other methods of assembling a selected saccharide acceptor will<br>
be apparent to those of skill in the art.<br>
[0257] In yet another embodiment, glycopeptide-linked oligosaccharides are first<br>
"trimmed," either in whole or in part, to expose either an acceptor for the sialyltransferase or<br>
a moiety to which one or more appropriate residues can be added to obtain a suitable<br>
acceptor. Enzymes such as glycosyltransferases and endoglycosidases (see, for example U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,716,812) are useful for the attaching and trimming reactions.<br>
[0258] In an exemplary embodiment, a carbohydrate residue is "trimmed" prior to the<br>
addition of the modified sugar. For example a GalNAc-Gal residue is trimmed back to<br>
GalNAc. A modified sugar bearing a water-soluble polymer is conjugated to one or more of<br>
the sugar residues exposed by the "trimming." In one example, a glycopeptide is "trimmed"<br><br>
and a water-soluble polymer is added to the resulting O-side chain amino acid or<br>
glycopeptide glycan via a saccharyl moiety, e.g., Sia, Gal or GalNAc moiety conjugated to<br>
the water-soluble polymer. The modified saccharyl moiety is attached to an acceptor site on<br>
the "trimmed" glycopeptide. Alternatively, an unmodified saccharyl moiety, e.g., Gal can be<br>
added the terminus of the O-linked glycan.<br>
[0259] In another exemplary embodiment, a branched water-soluble polymer is added to a<br>
GalNAc residue via a modified sugar having a galactose residue. Alternatively, an<br>
unmodified Gal can be added to the terminal GalNAc residue.<br>
[0260] In yet a further example, a branched water-soluble polymer is added onto a Gal<br>
residue using a modified sialic acid.<br>
[0261] The exemplary embodiments discussed above provide an illustration of the power of<br>
the methods set forth herein. Using the methods of the invention, it is possible to "trim back"<br>
and build up a carbohydrate residue of substantially any desired structure. The modified<br>
sugar can be added to the termini of the carbohydrate moiety as set forth above, or it can be<br>
intermediate between the peptide core and the terminus of the carbohydrate.<br>
[0262] In an exemplary embodiment, the branched water-soluble polymer is added to a<br>
terminal Gal residue using a polymer modified sialic acid. An appropriate sialyltransferase is<br>
used to add a modified sialic acid. The approach is summarized in Scheme 3.<br><br><br>
[0263] In yet a further approach, summarized in Scheme 4, a masked reactive functionality<br>
is present on the sialic acid. The masked reactive group is preferably unaffected by the<br>
conditions used to attach the modified sialic acid to the peptide. After the covalent<br>
attachment of the modified sialic acid to the peptide, the mask is removed and the peptide is<br>
conjugated with an agent such as PEG, PPG, a therapeutic moiety, biomolecule or other<br>
agent. The agent is conjugated to the peptide in a specific manner by its reaction with the<br>
unmasked reactive group on the modified sugar residue.<br><br>
[0264] Any modified sugar can be used with its appropriate glycosyltransferase, depending<br>
on the terminal sugars of the oligosaccharide side chains of the glycopeptide (Table 3). As<br>
discussed above, the terminal sugar of the glycopeptide required for introduction of the<br>
branched water-soluble polymer structure can be introduced naturally during expression or it<br>
can be produced post expression using the appropriate glycosidase(s), glycosyltransferase(s)<br>
or mix of glycosidase(s) and glycosyltransferase(s).<br><br><br>
[0265] In an alternative embodiment, the modified sugar is added directly to the peptide<br>
backbone using a glycosyltransferase known to transfer sugar residues to the O-linked<br>
glycosylation site on the peptide backbone. This exemplary embodiment is set forth in<br>
Scheme 5. Exemplary glycosyltransferases useful in practicing the present invention include,<br>
but are not limited to, GalNAc transferases (GalNAc Tl-2O), GlcNAc transferases,<br>
fucosyltransferases, glucosyltransferases, xylosyltransferases, mannosyltransferases and the<br>
like. Use of this approach allows the direct addition of modified sugars onto peptides that<br>
lack any carbohydrates or, alternatively, onto existing glycopeptides. In both cases, the<br><br>
addition of the modified sugar occurs at specific positions on the peptide backbone as defined<br>
by the substrate specificity of the glycosyltransferase and not in a random manner as occurs<br>
during modification of a protein's peptide backbone using chemical methods. An array of<br>
agents can be introduced into proteins or glycopeptides that lack the glycosyltransferase<br>
substrate peptide sequence by engineering the appropriate amino acid sequence into the<br>
polypeptide chain.<br><br>
[0266] In each of the exemplary embodiments set forth above, one or more additional<br>
chemical or enzymatic modification steps can be utilized following the conjugation of the<br>
modified sugar to the peptide. In an exemplary embodiment, an enzyme {e.g.,<br>
fucosyltransferase) is used to append a glycosyl unit {e.g., fucose) onto the terminal modified<br>
sugar attached to the peptide. In another example, an enzymatic reaction is utilized to "cap"<br>
{e.g., sialylate) sites to which the modified sugar failed to conjugate. Alternatively, a<br>
chemical reaction is utilized to alter the structure of the conjugated modified sugar. For<br>
example, the conjugated modified sugar is reacted with agents that stabilize or destabilize its<br>
linkage with the peptide component to which the modified sugar is attached. In another<br>
example, a component of the modified sugar is deprotected following its conjugation to the<br>
peptide. One of skill will appreciate that there is an array of enzymatic and chemical<br>
procedures that are useful in the methods of the invention at a stage after the modified sugar<br>
is conjugated to the peptide. Further elaboration of the modified sugar-peptide conjugate is<br>
within the scope of the invention.<br>
[0267] In another exemplary embodiment, the glycopeptide is conjugated to a targeting<br>
agent, e.g., transferrin (to deliver the peptide across the blood-brain barrier, and to<br>
endosomes), carnitine (to deliver the peptide to muscle cells; see, for example, LeBorgne et<br>
 al., Biochem. Pharmacol. 59: 1357-63 (2000), and phosphonates, e.g., bisphosphonate (to<br>
target the peptide to bone and other calciferous tissues; see, for example, Modern Drug<br><br>
Discovery, August 2002, page 10). Other agents useful for targeting are apparent to those of<br>
skill in the art. For example, glucose, glutamine and IGF are also useful to target muscle.<br>
[0268] The targeting moiety and therapeutic peptide are conjugated by any method<br>
discussed herein or otherwise known in the art. Those of skill will appreciate that peptides in<br>
addition to those set forth above can also be derivatized as set forth herein. Exemplary<br>
peptides are set forth in the Appendix attached to copending, commonly owned US<br>
Provisional Patent Application No. 60/328,523 filed October 1O, 2001.<br>
[0269] In an exemplary embodiment, the targeting agent and the therapeutic peptide are<br>
coupled via a linker moiety. In this embodiment, at least one of the therapeutic peptide or the<br>
targeting agent is coupled to the linker moiety via an intact glycosyl linking group according<br>
to a method of the invention. In an exemplary embodiment, the linker moiety includes a<br>
poly(ether) such as poly(ethylene glycol). In another exemplary embodiment, the linker<br>
moiety includes at least one bond that is degraded in vivo, releasing the therapeutic peptide<br>
from the targeting agent, following delivery of the conjugate to the targeted tissue or region<br>
of the body.<br>
[0270] In yet another exemplary embodiment, the in vivo distribution of the therapeutic<br>
moiety is altered via altering a glycoform on the therapeutic moiety without conjugating the<br>
therapeutic peptide to a targeting moiety. For example, the therapeutic peptide can be<br>
shunted away from uptake by the reticuloendothelial system by capping a terminal galactose<br>
moiety of a glycosyl group with sialic acid (or a derivative thereof).<br>
i. Enzymes<br>
1. Glycosyltransferases<br>
[0271] Glycosyltransferases catalyze the addition of activated sugars (donor NDP-sugars),<br>
in a step-wise fashion, to a protein, glycopeptide, lipid or glycolipid or to the non-reducing<br>
end of a growing oligosaccharide. N-linked glycopeptides are synthesized via a transferase<br>
and a lipid-linked oligosaccharide donor Dol-PP-NAG2Glc3Man9 in an en block transfer<br>
followed by trimming of the core. In this case the nature of the "core" saccharide is<br>
somewhat different from subsequent attachments. A very large number of<br>
glycosyltransferases are known in the art.<br>
[0272] The glycosyltransferase to be used in the present invention may be any as long as it<br>
can utilize the modified sugar as a sugar donor. Examples of such enzymes include Leloir<br>
pathway glycosyltransferase, such as galactosyltransferase, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase,<br><br>
N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, fucosyltransferase, sialyltransferase, mannosyltransferase,<br>
xylosyltransferase, glucurononyltransferase and the like.<br>
[0273] For enzymatic saccharide syntheses that involve glycosyltransferase reactions,<br>
glycosyltransferase can be cloned, or isolated from any source. Many cloned<br>
glycosyltransferases are known, as are their polynucleotide sequences. See, e.g., "The WWW<br>
Guide To Cloned Glycosyltransferases," (http://www.vei.co.uk/TGN/gt guide.htm).<br>
Glycosyltransferase amino acid sequences and nucleotide sequences encoding<br>
glycosyltransferases from which the amino acid sequences can be deduced are also found in<br>
various publicly available databases, including GenBank, Swiss-Prot, EMBL, and others.<br>
[0274] Glycosyltransferases that can be employed in the methods of the invention include,<br>
but are not limited to, galactosyltransferases, fucosyltransferases, glucosyltransferases, N-<br>
acetylgalactosaminyltransferases, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases, glucuronyltransferases,<br>
sialyltransferases, mannosyltransferases, glucuronic acid transferases, galacturonic acid<br>
transferases, and oligosaccharyltransferases. Suitable glycosyltransferases include those<br>
obtained from eukaryotes, as well as from prokaryotes.<br>
[0275] DNA encoding glycosyltransferases may be obtained by chemical synthesis, by<br>
screening reverse transcripts of mRNA from appropriate cells or cell line cultures, by<br>
screening genomic libraries from appropriate cells, or by combinations of these procedures.<br>
Screening of mRNA or genomic DNA may be carried out with oligonucleotide probes<br>
generated from the glycosyltransferases gene sequence. Probes may be labeled with a<br>
detectable group such as a fluorescent group, a radioactive atom or a chemiluminescent group<br>
in accordance with known procedures and used in conventional hybridization assays. In the<br>
alternative, glycosyltransferases gene sequences may be obtained by use of the polymerase<br>
chain reaction (PCR) procedure, with the PCR oligonucleotide primers being produced from<br>
the glycosyltransferases gene sequence. See, U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,195 to Mullis et al. and U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 4,683,202 to Mullis.<br>
[0276] The glycosyltransferase may be synthesized in host cells transformed with vectors<br>
containing DNA encoding the glycosyltransferases enzyme. Vectors are used either to<br>
amplify DNA encoding the glycosyltransferases enzyme and/or to express DNA which<br>
encodes the glycosyltransferases enzyme. An expression vector is a replicable DNA<br>
construct in which a DNA sequence encoding the glycosyltransferases enzyme is operably<br>
linked to suitable control sequences capable of effecting the expression of the<br><br>
glycosyltransferases enzyme in a suitable host. The need for such control sequences will<br>
vary depending upon the host selected and the transformation method chosen. Generally,<br>
control sequences include a transcriptional promoter, an optional operator sequence to control<br>
transcription, a sequence encoding suitable mRNA ribosomal binding sites, and sequences<br>
which control the termination of transcription and translation. Amplification vectors do not<br>
require expression control domains. AH that is needed is the ability to replicate in a host,<br>
usually conferred by an origin of replication, and a selection gene to facilitate recognition of<br>
transformants.<br>
[0277] In an exemplary embodiment, the invention utilizes a prokaryotic enzyme. Such<br>
glycosyltransferases include enzymes involved in synthesis of lipooligosaccharides (LOS),<br>
which are produced by many gram negative bacteria (Preston et al, Critical Reviews in<br>
Microbiology 23(3): 139-180 (1996)). Such enzymes include, but are not limited to, the<br>
proteins of the rfa operons of species such as E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium, which<br>
include a ,6 galactosyltransferase and a ,3 galactosyltransferase (see, e.g., EMBL<br>
Accession Nos. M80599 and M86935 (E. coli); EMBL Accession No. S56361 (S.<br>
typhimurium)), a glucosyltransferase (Swiss-Prot Accession No. P25740 (E. coli), an ,2-<br>
glucosyltransferase (rfJ)(Swiss-Prot Accession No. P27129 (E. coli) and Swiss-Prot<br>
Accession No. PI9817 (S. typhimurium)), and an ,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase<br>
(rfK)(EMBL Accession No. U00039 (E. coli). Other glycosyltransferases for which amino<br>
acid sequences are known include those that are encoded by operons such as rfB, which<br>
have been characterized in organisms such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli, Salmonella<br>
typhimurium, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia enterocolitica, Mycobacterium leprosum, and the<br>
rhl operon of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.<br>
[0278] Also suitable for use in the present invention are glycosyltransferases that are<br>
involved in producing structures containing lacto-N-neotetraose, D-galactosyl--l,4-N-<br>
acetyl-D-glucosaminyl--l,3-D-galactosyl-,4-D-glucose, and the Pk blood group<br>
trisaccharide sequence, D-galactosyl--l,4-D-galactosyl-P-l,4-D-glucose, which have been<br>
identified in the LOS of the mucosal pathogens Neisseria gonnorhoeae and N. meningitidis<br>
(Scholten et al., J. Med. Microbiol. 41: 236-243 (1994)). The genes from N. meningitidis and<br>
N. gonorrhoeae that encode the glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of these<br>
structures have been identified from N. meningitidis immunotypes L3 and L1 (Jennings et al.,<br>
Mol. Microbiol. 18: 729-740 (1995)) and the N. gonorrhoeae mutant F62 (Gotshlich, J. Exp.<br>
Med. 180: 2181-2190 (1994)). In N. meningitidis, a locus consisting of three genes, IgtA,<br><br>
 lgtB and lg E, encodes the glycosyltransferase enzymes required for addition of the last three<br>
of the sugars in the lacto-N-neotetraose chain (Wakarchuk et al, J. Biol. Chem. 271: 19166-<br>
73 (1996)). Recently the enzymatic activity of the lgtB and lgtA gene product was<br>
demonstrated, providing the first direct evidence for their proposed glycosyltransferase<br>
function (Wakarchuk et al, J. Biol. Chem. 271(45): 28271-276 (1996)). in N. gonorrhoeae,<br>
there are two additional genes, lgtD which adds -D-GalNAc to the 3 position of the terminal<br>
galactose of the lacto-N-neotetraose structure and lgtC which adds a terminal -D-Gal to the<br>
lactose element of a truncated LOS, thus creating the Pk blood group antigen structure<br>
(Gotshlich (1994), supra.). In N. meningitidis, a separate immunotype L1 also expresses the<br>
Pk blood group antigen and has been shown to carry an lgtC gene (Jennings et al, (1995),<br>
supra). Neisseria glycosyltransferases and associated genes are also described in USPN<br>
5,545,553 (Gotschlich). Genes for ,2-fucosyltransferase and al,3-fucosyltransferase from<br>
Helicobacter pylori has also been characterized (Martin et al, J. Biol Chem. 272: 21349-<br>
21356 (1997)). Also of use in the present invention are the glycosyltransferases of<br>
Campylobacter jejuni (see, for example, http://afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/~pedro/CAZY/gtf_42.html).<br>
a) Fucosyltransferases<br>
[0279] In some embodiments, a glycosyltransferase used in the method of the invention is a<br>
fucosyltransferase. Fucosyltransferases are known to those of skill in the art. Exemplary<br>
fucosyltransferases include enzymes, which transfer L-fucose from GDP-fucose to a hydroxy<br>
position of an acceptor sugar. Fucosyltransferases that transfer non-nucleotide sugars to an<br>
acceptor are also of use in the present invention.<br>
[0280] In some embodiments, the acceptor sugar is, for example, the GlcNAc in a<br>
Gal3,4)GlcNAc- group in an oligosaccharide glycoside. Suitable fucosyltransferases<br>
for this reaction include the Gal(l3,4)GlcNAcl-(l3,4)fucosyltransferase (FTIII E.C.<br>
No. 2.4.1.65), which was first characterized from human milk (see, Palcic, et al,<br>
Carbohydrate Res. 190: 1-11 (1989); Prieels, et al, J. Biol Chem. 256: 10456-10463 (1981);<br>
and Nunez, et al, Can. J. Chem. 59: 2086-2095 (1981)) and the Gal(l4)GlcNAc-<br>
fucosyltransferases (FTIV, FTV, FTVI) which are found in human serum. FTVII (E.C. No.<br>
2.4.1.65), a sialyl (23)Gal((l3)GlcNAc fucosyltransferase, has also been<br>
characterized. A recombinant form of the Gal(l3,4) GlcNAc-<br>
(l3,4)fucosyltransferase has also been characterized (see, Dumas, et al, Bioorg. Med.<br>
Letters 1: 425-428 (1991) and Kukowska-Latallo, et al, Genes and Development 4: 1288-<br><br>
1303 (1990)). Other exemplary fucosyltransferases include, for example, l,2<br>
fucosyltransferase (E.C. No. 2.4.1.69). Enzymatic fucosylation can be carried out by the<br>
methods described in Mollicone, et al, Eur. J. Biochem. 191: 169-176 (1990) or U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,374,655. Cells that are used to produce a fucosyltransferase will also include an<br>
enzymatic system for synthesizing GDP-fucose.<br>
b) Galactosyltransferases<br>
[0281] In another group of embodiments, the glycosyltransferase is a galactosyltransferase.<br>
Exemplary galactosyltransferases include (l,3) galactosyltransferases (E.C. No. 2.4.1.151,<br>
see, e.g., Dabkowski et al, Transplant Proc. 25:2921 (1993) and Yamamoto et al. Nature<br>
345: 229-233 (1990), bovine (GenBank j04989, Joziasse et al, J. Biol. Chem. 264: 14290-<br>
14297 (1989)), murine (GenBank m26925; Larsen et al, Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA 86:<br>
8227-8231 (1989)), porcine (GenBank L36152; Strahan et al, Immunogenetics 41: 101-105<br>
(1995)). Another suitable ,3 galactosyltransferase is that which is involved in synthesis of<br>
the blood group B antigen (EC 2.4.1.37, Yamamoto et al, J. Biol. Chem. 265: 1146-1151<br>
(1990) (human)). Yet a further exemplary galactosyltransferase is core Gal-T1.<br>
[0282] Also suitable for use in the methods of the invention are (l,4)<br>
galactosyltransferases, which include, for example, EC 2.4.1.90 (LacNAc synthetase) and EC<br>
2.4.1.22 (lactose synthetase) (bovine (D'Agostaro et al, Eur. J. Biochem. 183: 211-217<br>
(1989)), human (Masri et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 157: 657-663 (1988)), murine<br>
(Nakazawa et al, J. Biochem. 104: 165-168 (1988)), as well as E.C. 2.4.1.38 and the<br>
ceramide galactosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.45, Stahl et al, J. Neurosci. Res. 38: 234-242<br>
(1994)). Other suitable galactosyltransferases include, for example, l,2<br>
galactosyltransferases (from e.g., Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Chapell et al, Mol Biol. Cell<br>
5:519-528(1994)).<br>
c) Sialyltransferases<br>
[0283] Sialyltransferases are another type of glycosyltransferase that is useful in the<br>
recombinant cells and reaction mixtures of the invention. Cells that produce recombinant<br>
sialyltransferases will also produce CMP-sialic acid, which is a sialic acid donor for<br>
sialyltransferases. Examples of sialyltransferases that are suitable for use in the present<br>
invention include ST3Gal III (e.g., a rat or human ST3Gal III), ST3Gal IV, ST3Gal I, ST6Gal<br>
I, ST3Gal V, ST6Gal II, ST6GalNAc I, ST6GalNAc II, and ST6GalNAc III (the<br><br>
sialyltransferase nomenclature used herein is as described in Tsuji et ah, Glycobiology 6: v-<br>
xiv (1996)). An exemplary (2,3)sialyltransferase referred to as (2,3)sialyltransferase (EC<br>
2.4.99.6) transfers sialic acid to the non-reducing terminal Gal of a Galj313Glc disaccharide<br>
or glycoside. See, Van den Eijnden et al, J. Biol. Chem. 256: 3159 (1981), Weinstein et ah,<br>
J. Biol. Chem. 257: 13845 (1982) and Wen et ah, J. Biol. Chem. 267: 21011 (1992). Another<br>
exemplary 2,3-sialyltransferase (EC 2.4.99.4) transfers sialic acid to the non-reducing<br>
terminal Gal of the disaccharide or glycoside, see, Rearick et ah, J. Biol. Chem. 254: 4444<br>
(1979) and Gillespie et ah, J. Biol. Chem. 267: 21004 (1992). Further exemplary enzymes<br>
include GaI--l,4-GlcNAc -2,6 sialyltransferase {See, Kurosawa et al. Eur. J. Biochem.<br>
219: 375-381 (1994)).<br>
[0284] Preferably, for glycosylation of carbohydrates of glycopeptides the sialyltransferase<br>
will be able to transfer sialic acid to the sequence Gal1,4GlcNAc-, the most common<br>
penultimate sequence underlying the terminal sialic acid on fully sialylated carbohydrate<br>
structures (see, Table 4).<br><br>
1)	G00chee et ah, Bio/Technology 9: 1347-1355 (1991)<br>
2)	Yamamoto et ah, J. Biochem. 120: 104-110 (1996)<br>
3)	Gilbert et ah, J. Biol. Chem. 271: 28271-28276 (1996)<br>
[O285] An example of a sialyltransferase that is useful in the claimed methods is ST3Gal<br>
III, which is also referred to as (2,3)sialyltransferase (EC 2.4.99.6). This enzyme catalyzes<br>
the transfer of sialic acid to the Gal of a Gall,3GlcNAc or Gall,4GlcNAc glycoside (see,<br>
e.g., Wen et ah, J. Biol. Chem. 267: 21011 (1992); Van den Eijnden et ah, J. Biol. Chem.<br><br>
256: 3159 (1991)) and is responsible for sialylation of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides in<br>
glycopeptides.. The sialic acid is linked to a Gal with the formation of an -linkage between<br>
the two saccharides. Bonding (linkage) between the saccharides is between the 2-position of<br>
NeuAc and the 3-position of Gal. This particular enzyme can be isolated from rat liver<br>
(Weinstein et al, J. Biol. Chan. 257: 13845 (1982)); the human cDNA (Sasaki et al. (1993)<br>
j. Biol. Chem. 268: 22782-22787; Kitagawa &amp; Paulson (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269: 1394-<br>
1401) and genomic (Kitagawa et al. (1996) j. Biol. Chem. 271: 931-938) DNA sequences are<br>
known, facilitating production of this enzyme by recombinant expression. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the claimed sialylation methods use a rat ST3Gal III.<br>
[0286] Other exemplary sialyltransferases of use in the present invention include those<br>
isolated from Campylobacter jejuni, including the (2,3). See, e.g, WO99/49O51.<br>
[0287] Sialyltransferases other those listed in Table 5, are also useful in an economic and<br>
efficient large-scale process for sialylation of commercially important glycopeptides. As a<br>
simple test to find out the utility of these other enzymes, various amounts of each enzyme<br>
(1-100 mU/mg protein) are reacted with asialo- AGP (at 1-10 mg/ml) to compare the<br>
ability of the sialyltransferase of interest to sialyl ate glycopeptides relative to either bovine<br>
ST6Gal I, ST3Gal III or bdth sialyltransferases. Alternatively, other glycopeptides or<br>
glycopeptides, or N-linked oligosaccharides enzymatically released from the peptide<br>
backbone can be used in place of asialo- AGP for this evaluation. Sialyltransferases with<br>
the ability to sialylate N-linked oligosaccharides of glycopeptides more efficiently than<br>
ST6Gal I are useful in a practical large-scale process for peptide sialylation (as illustrated for<br>
ST3Gal III in this disclosure).<br><br>
d) GalNAc transferases<br>
[0288] N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases are of use in practicing the present invention,<br>
particularly for binding a GalNAc moiety to an amino acid of the O-linked glycosylation site<br>
of the peptide. Suitable N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases include, but are not limited to,<br>
(l,3) N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, (l,4) N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (Nagata<br>
et al, J. Biol. Chem. 267: 12082-12089 (1992) and Smith et al, J. Biol Chem. 269: 15162<br>
(1994)) and polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (Homa et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268:<br>
12609 (1993)).<br>
[0289] Production of proteins such as the enzyme GalNAc T1-xx from cloned genes by<br>
genetic engineering is well known. See, eg., U.S. Pat. No. 4,761,371. One method involves<br>
collection of sufficient samples, then the amino acid sequence of the enzyme is determined<br>
by N-terminal sequencing. This information is then used to isolate a cDNA clone encoding a<br>
full-length (membrane bound) transferase which upon expression in the insect cell line Sf9<br>
resulted in the synthesis of a fully active enzyme. The acceptor specificity of the enzyme is<br>
then determined using a semiquantitative analysis of the amino acids surrounding known<br>
glycosylation sites in 16 different proteins followed by in vitro glycosylation studies of<br>
synthetic peptides. This work has demonstrated that certain amino acid residues are<br>
overrepresented in glycosylated peptide segments and that residues in specific positions<br>
surrounding glycosylated serine and threonine residues may have a more marked influence on<br>
acceptor efficiency than other amino acid moieties.<br>
2. Sulfotransferases<br>
[0290] The invention also provides methods for producing peptides that include sulfated<br>
molecules, including, for example sulfated polysaccharides such as heparin, heparan sulfate,<br>
carragenen, and related compounds. Suitable sulfotransferases include, for example,<br>
chondroitin-6-sulphotransferase (chicken cDNA described by Fukuta et al, J. Biol. Chem.<br>
270: 18575-18580 (1995); GenBank Accession No. D49915), glycosaminoglycan N-<br>
acetylglucosamine N-deacetylase/N-sulphotransferase 1 (Dixon et al, Genomics 26: 239-241<br>
(1995); UL18918), and glycosaminoglycan N-acetylglucosamine N-deacetylase/N-<br>
sulphotransferase 2 (murine cDNA described in Orellana et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269: 2270-<br>
2276 (1994) and Eriksson et al, J. Biol. Chem. 269: 10438-10443 (1994); human cDNA<br>
described in GenBank Accession No. U2304).<br><br>
3. Cell-Bound Glycosyltransferases<br>
[0291] In another embodiment, the enzymes utilized in the method of the invention are<br>
cell-bound glycosyltransferases. Although many soluble glycosyltransferases are known<br>
(see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,032,519), glycosyltransferases are generally in membrane-<br>
bound form when associated with cells. Many of the membrane-bound enzymes studied thus<br>
far are considered to be intrinsic proteins; that is, they are not released from the membranes<br>
by sonication and require detergents for solubilization. Surface glycosyltransferases have<br>
been identified on the surfaces of vertebrate and invertebrate cells, and it has also been<br>
recognized that these surface transferases maintain catalytic activity under physiological<br>
conditions. However, the more recognized function of cell surface glycosyltransferases is for<br>
intercellular recognition (Roth, MOLECULAR APPROACHES to SUPRACELLULAR PHENOMENA,<br>
1990).<br>
[0292] Methods have been developed to alter the glycosyltransferases expressed by cells.<br>
For example, Larsen et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86: 8227-8231 (1989), report a genetic<br>
approach to isolate cloned cDNA sequences that determine expression of cell surface<br>
oligosaccharide structures and their cognate glycosyltransferases. A cDNA library generated<br>
from mRNA isolated from a murine cell line known to express UDP-galactose:..-D-<br>
galactosyl-l,4-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminide -l,3-galactosyltransferase was transfected into<br>
COS-1 cells. The transfected cells were then cultured and assayed for  1-3<br>
galactosyltransferase activity.<br>
[0293] Francisco et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89: 2713-2717 (1992), disclose a<br>
method of anchoring -lactamase to the external surface of Escherichia coli. A tripartite<br>
fusion consisting of (i) a signal sequence of an outer membrane protein, (ii) a membrane-<br>
spanning section of an outer membrane protein, and (iii) a complete mature -lactamase<br>
sequence is produced resulting in an active surface bound -lactamase molecule. However,<br>
the Francisco method is limited only to procaryotic cell systems and as recognized by the<br>
authors, requires the complete tripartite fusion for proper functioning.<br>
4. Fusion Proteins<br>
[0294] In other exemplary embodiments, the methods of the invention utilize fusion<br>
proteins that have more than one enzymatic activity that is involved in synthesis of a desired<br>
glycopeptide conjugate. The fusion polypeptides can be composed of, for example, a<br><br>
catalytically active domain of a glycosyltransferase that is joined to a catalytically active<br>
domain of an accessory enzyme. The accessory enzyme catalytic domain can, for example,<br>
catalyze a step in the formation of a nucleotide sugar that is a donor for the<br>
glycosyltransferase, or catalyze a reaction involved in a glycosyltransferase cycle. For<br>
example, a polynucleotide that encodes a glycosyltransferase can be joined, in-frame, to a<br>
polynucleotide that encodes an enzyme involved in nucleotide sugar synthesis. The resulting<br>
fusion protein can then catalyze not only the synthesis of the nucleotide sugar, but also the<br>
transfer of the sugar moiety to the acceptor molecule. The fusion protein can be two or more<br>
cycle enzymes linked into one expressible nucleotide sequence. In other embodiments the<br>
fusion protein includes the catalytically active domains of two or more glycosyltransferases.<br>
See, for example, 5,641,668. The modified glycopeptides of the present invention can be<br>
readily designed and manufactured utilizing various suitable fusion proteins (see, for<br>
example, PCT Patent Application PCT/CA98/01180, which was published as WO 99/31224<br>
on June 24, 1999.)<br>
5. Immobilized Enzymes<br>
[0295] In addition to cell-bound enzymes, the present invention also provides for the use of<br>
enzymes that are immobilized on a solid and/or soluble support. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, there is provided a glycosyltransferase that is conjugated to a PEG via an intact<br>
glycosyl linker according to the methods of the invention. The PEG-linker-enzyme conjugate<br>
is optionally attached to solid support. The use of solid supported enzymes in the methods of<br>
the invention simplifies the work up of the reaction mixture and purification of the reaction<br>
product, and also enables the facile recovery of the enzyme. The glycosyltransferase<br>
conjugate is utilized in the methods of the invention. Other combinations of enzymes and<br>
supports will be apparent to those of skill in the art.<br>
Purification of Peptide Conjugates<br>
[0296] The products produced by the above processes can be used without purification.<br>
However, it is usually preferred to recover the product. Standard, well-known techniques for<br>
recovery of glycosylated saccharides such as thin or thick layer chromatography, column<br>
chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, or membrane filtration can be used. It is<br>
preferred to use membrane filtration, more preferably utilizing a reverse osmotic membrane,<br>
or one or more column chromatographic techniques for the recovery as is discussed<br>
hereinafter and in the literature cited herein. For instance, membrane filtration wherein the<br><br>
membranes have molecular weight cutoff of about 3000 to about 10,000 can be used to<br>
remove proteins such as glycosyl transferases. Nanofiltration or reverse osmosis can then be<br>
used to remove salts and/or purify the product saccharides (see, e.g., WO 98/15581).<br>
Nanofilter membranes are a class of reverse osmosis membranes that pass monovalent salts<br>
but retain polyvalent salts and uncharged solutes larger than about 100 to about 2,000<br>
Daltons, depending upon the membrane used. Thus, in a typical application, saccharides<br>
prepared by the methods of the present invention will be retained in the membrane and<br>
contaminating salts will pass through.<br>
[0297] If the modified glycoprotein is produced intracellularly, as a first step, the<br>
particulate debris, either host cells or lysed fragments, is removed, for example, by<br>
centrifugation or ultrafiltration; optionally, the protein may be concentrated with a<br>
commercially available protein concentration filter, followed by separating the polypeptide<br>
variant from other impurities by one or more steps selected from immunoaffinity<br>
chromatography, ion-exchange column fractionation (e.g., on diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) or<br>
matrices containing carboxymethyl or sulfopropyl groups), chromatography on Blue-<br>
Sepharose, CM Blue-Sepharose, MONO-Q, MONO-S, lentil lectin-Sepharose, WGA-<br>
Sepharose, Con A-Sepharose, Ether Toyopearl, Butyl Toyopearl, Phenyl Toyopearl, SP-<br>
Sepharose, or protein A Sepharose, SDS-PAGE chromatography, silica chromatography,<br>
chromatofocusing, reverse phase HPLC (e.g., silica gel with appended aliphatic groups), gel<br>
filtration using, e.g., Sephadex molecular sieve or size-exclusion chromatography,<br>
chromatography on columns that selectively bind the polypeptide, and ethanol or ammonium<br>
sulfate precipitation.<br>
[0298] Modified glycopeptides produced in culture are usually isolated by initial extraction<br>
from cells, enzymes, etc., followed by one or more concentration, salting-out, aqueous ion-<br>
exchange, or size-exclusion chromatography steps, e.g., SP Sepharose. Additionally, the<br>
modified glycoprotein may be purified by affinity chromatography. HPLC may also be<br>
employed for one or more purification steps.<br>
[0299] A protease inhibitor, e.g., methylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF) may be included in any of<br>
the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the<br>
growth of adventitious contaminants.<br>
[0300] Within another embodiment, supematants from systems which sproduce the<br>
modified glycopeptide of the invention are first concentrated using a commercially available<br><br>
protein concentration filter, for example, an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit.<br>
Following the concentration step, the concentrate may be applied to a suitable purification<br>
matrix. For example, a suitable affinity matrix may comprise a ligand for the peptide, a lectin<br>
or antibody molecule bound to a suitable support. Alternatively, an anion-exchange resin<br>
may be employed, for example, a matrix or substrate having pendant DEAE groups. Suitable<br>
matrices include acrylamide, agarose, dextran,- cellulose, or other types commonly employed<br>
in protein purification. Alternatively, a cation-exchange step may be employed. Suitable<br>
cation exchangers include various insoluble matrices comprising sulfopropyl or<br>
carboxymethyl groups. Sulfopropyl groups are particularly preferred.<br>
[0301] Finally, one or more RP-HPLC steps employing hydrophobic RP-HPLC media, e.g.,<br>
silica gel having pendant methyl or other aliphatic groups, may be employed to further purify<br>
a polypeptide variant composition. Some or all of the foregoing purification steps, in various<br>
combinations, can also be employed to provide a homogeneous modified glycoprotein.<br>
[0302] The modified glycopeptide of the invention resulting from a large-scale<br>
fermentation may be purified by methods analogous to those disclosed by Urdal et ah, J.<br>
Chromatog. 296: 171 (1984). This reference describes two sequential, RP-HPLC steps for<br>
purification of recombinant human IL-2 on a preparative HPLC column. Alternatively,<br>
techniques such as affinity chromatography may be utilized to purify the modified<br>
glycoprotein.<br>
[0303] In addition to the conjugates discussed above, the present invention provides<br>
methods for preparing these and other conjugates. Moreover, the invention provides methods<br>
of preventing, curing or ameliorating a disease state by administering a conjugate of the<br>
invention to a subject at risk of developing the disease or a subject that has the disease.<br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
[0304] Therapeutic moieties that are conjugated to branched water-soluble polymers of the<br>
present invention have a broad range of pharmaceutical applications. For example, modified<br>
erythropoietin (EPO) may be used for treating general anemia, aplastic anemia, chemo-<br>
induced injury (such as injury to bone marrow), chronic renal failure, nephritis, and<br>
thalassemia. Modified EPO may be further used for treating neurological disorders such as<br>
brain/spine injury, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease.<br><br>
[0305] A second example is interferon- (IFN-), which may be used for treating AIDS<br>
and hepatitis B or C, viral infections caused by a variety of viruses such as human papilloma<br>
virus (HBV), coronavirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus<br>
(HSV), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cancers such as hairy cell leukemia, AIDS-related<br>
Kaposi's sarcoma, malignant melanoma, follicular non-Hodgkins lymphoma, Philladephia<br>
chromosome (Ph)-positive, chronic phase myelogenous leukemia (CML), renal cancer,<br>
myeloma, chronic myelogenous leukemia, cancers of the head and neck, bone cancers, as<br>
well as cervical dysplasia and disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) such as multiple<br>
sclerosis. In addition, IFN- modified according to the methods of the present invention is<br>
useful for treating an assortment of other diseases and conditions such as Sjogren's symdrome<br>
(an autoimmune disease), Behcet's disease (an autoimmune inflammatory disease),<br>
fibromyalgia (a musculoskeletal pain/fatigue disorder), aphthous ulcer (canker sores), chronic<br>
fatigue syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis.<br>
[0306] Another example is interferon-, which is useful for treating CNS disorders such as<br>
multiple sclerosis (either relapsing/remitting or chronic progressive), AIDS and hepatitis B or<br>
C, viral infections caused by a variety of viruses such as human papilloma virus (HBV),<br>
human immunodeficiency virus (HTV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and varicella-zoster<br>
virus (VZV), otological infections, musculoskeletal infections, as well as cancers including<br>
breast cancer, brain cancer, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck<br>
cancer, basal cell cancer, cervical dysplasia, melanoma, skin cancer, and liver cancer. EFN-<br>
modified according to the methods of the present invention is also used in treating other<br>
diseases and conditions such as transplant zejection (e.g., bone marrow transplant),<br>
Huntington's chorea, colitis, brain inflammation, pulmonary fibrosis, macular degeneration,<br>
hepatic cirrhosis, and keratoconjunctivitis.<br>
[0307] Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a further example. G-CSF<br>
modified according to the methods of the present invention may be used as an adjunct in<br>
chemotherapy for treating cancers, and to prevent or alleviate conditions or complications<br>
associated with certain medical procedures, e.g., chemo-induced bone marrow injury;<br>
leucopenia (general); chemo-induced febrile neutropenia; neutropenia associated with bone<br>
marrow transplants; and severe, chronic neutropenia. Modified G-CSF may also be used for<br>
transplantation; peripheral blood cell mobilization; mobilization of peripheral blood<br>
progenitor cells for collection in patients who will receive myeloablative or myelosuppressive<br>
chemotherapy; and reduction in duration of neutropenia, fever, antibiotic use, hospitalization<br><br>
following induction/consolidation treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Other<br>
condictions or disorders may be treated with modified G-CSF include asthma and allergic<br>
rhinitis.<br>
[0308] As one additional example, human growth hormone (hGH) modified according to<br>
the methods of the present invention may be used to treat growth-related conditions such as<br>
dwarfism, short-stature in children and adults, cachexia/muscle wasting, general muscular<br>
atrophy, and sex chromosome abnormality (e.g., Turner's Syndrome). Other conditions may<br>
be treated using modified hGH include: short-bowel syndrome, lipodystrophy, osteoporosis,<br>
uraemaia, burns, female infertility, bone regeneration, general diabetes, type II diabetes,<br>
osteo-arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and insomia. Moreover,<br>
modified hGH may also be used to promote various processes, e.g., general tissue<br>
regeneration, bone regeneration, and wound healing, or as a vaccine adjunct.<br>
[0309] Thus, in another aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition. The<br>
pharmaceutical composition includes a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent and a covalent<br>
conjugate between a non-naturally-occurring, water-soluble polymer, therapeutic moiety or<br>
biomolecule and a glycosylated or non-glycosylated peptide. The polymer, therapeutic<br>
moiety or biomolecule is conjugated to the peptide via an intact glycosyl linking group<br>
interposed between and covalently linked to both the peptide and the polymer, therapeutic<br>
moiety or biomolecule.<br>
[0310] Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are suitable for use in a variety of<br>
drug delivery systems. Suitable formulations for use in the present invention are found in<br>
Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mace Publishing Company, Philadelphia, PA, 17th<br>
ed. (1985). For a brief review of methods for drug delivery, see, Langer, Science 249:1527-<br>
1533 (1990).<br>
[0311] The pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated for any appropriate manner of<br>
administration, including for example, topical, oral, nasal, intravenous, intracranial,<br>
intraperitoneal, subcutaneous or intramuscular administration. For parenteral administration,<br>
such as subcutaneous injection, the carrier preferably comprises water, saline, alcohol, a fat, a<br>
wax or a buffer. For oral administration, any of the above carriers or a solid carrier, such as<br>
mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, talcum, cellulose, glucose,<br>
sucrose, and magnesium carbonate, may be employed. Biodegradable matrises, such as<br>
microspheres (e.g., polylactate polyglycolate), may also be employed as carriers for the<br><br>
pharmaceutical compositions of this invention. Suitable biodegradable microspheres are<br>
disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,897,268 and 5,075,109.<br>
[0312] Commonly, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered subcutaneously or<br>
parenterally, e.g., intravenously. Thus, the invention provides compositions for parenteral<br>
administration which comprise the compound dissolved or suspended in an acceptable<br>
carrier, preferably an aqueous carrier, e.g., water, buffered water, saline, PBS and the like.<br>
The compositions may also contain detergents such as Tween 20 and Tween 80; stablizers<br>
such as mannitol, sorbitol, sucrose, and trehalose; and preservatives such as EDTA and m-<br>
cresol. The compositions may contain pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances as<br>
required to approximate physiological conditions, such as pH adjusting and buffering agents,<br>
tonicity adjusting agents, wetting agents, detergents and the like.<br>
[0313] These compositions may be sterilized by conventional sterilization techniques, or<br>
may be sterile filtered. The resulting aqueous solutions may be packaged for use as is, or<br>
lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous carrier prior to<br>
administration. The pH of the preparations typically will be between 3 and 11, more<br>
preferably from 5 to 9 and most preferably from 7 and 8.<br>
[0314] In some embodiments the glycopeptides of the invention can be incorporated into<br>
liposomes formed from standard vesicle-forming lipids. A variety of methods are available,<br>
for preparing liposomes, as described in, e.g., Szoka et al, Ann. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 9: 467<br>
(1980), U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,235,871, 4,501,728 and 4,837,028. The targeting of liposomes using<br>
a variety of targeting agents {e.g., the sialyl galactosides of the invention) is well known in<br>
the art (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,957,773 and 4,603,044).<br>
[0315] Standard methods for coupling targeting agents to liposomes can be used. These<br>
methods generally involve incorporation into liposomes of lipid components, such as<br>
phosphatidylethanolamine, which can be activated for attachment of targeting agents, or<br>
derivatized lipophilic compounds, such as lipid-derivatized glycopeptides of the invention.<br>
[0316] Targeting mechanisms generally require that the targeting agents be positioned on<br>
the surface of the liposome in such a manner that the target moieties are available for<br>
interaction with the target, for example, a cell surface receptor. The carbohydrates of the<br>
invention may be attached to a lipid molecule before the liposome is formed using methods<br>
known to those of skill in the art (e.g., alkylation or acylation of a hydroxyl group present on<br>
the carbohydrate with a long chain alkyl halide or with a fatty acid, respectively).<br><br>
Alternatively, the liposome may be fashioned in such a way that a connector portion is first<br>
incorporated into the membrane at the time of forming the membrane. The connector portion<br>
must have a lipophilic portion, which is firmly embedded and anchored in the membrane. It<br>
must also have a reactive portion, which is chemically available on the aqueous surface of the<br>
liposome. The reactive portion is selected so that it will be chemically suitable to form a<br>
stable chemical bond with the targeting agent or carbohydrate, which is added later. In some<br>
cases it is possible to attach the target agent to the connector molecule directly, but in most<br>
instances it is more suitable to use a third molecule to act as a chemical bridge, thus linking<br>
the connector molecule which is in the membrane with the target agent or carbohydrate which<br>
is extended, three dimensionally, off of the vesicle surface.<br>
[0317] The compounds prepared by the methods of the invention may also find use as<br>
diagnostic reagents. For example, labeled compounds can be used to locate areas of<br>
inflammation or tumor metastasis in a patient suspected of having an inflammation. For this<br>
use, the compounds can be labeled with 125I,14C, or tritium.<br>
[0318] The following examples are provided to illustrate the compounds, and methods and<br>
of the present invention, but not to limit the claimed invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br><br>
[0320] Combinations of primary PEG subunits can be alternatively written with the<br>
rounded molecular weight shown between the functionalized ends as shown below.<br><br>
[0321] The following nomenclature is used to represent a monofunctionalized<br>
methoxy-PEG subunit:<br><br>
[0319] The following nomenclature is employed in Examples 1-3. The primary PEG<br>
subunit consists of four ethylene glycol units. This molecule has a molecular weight of 194,<br>
which has been rounded to 200 in the figures. The following nomenclature is used to<br>
represent the primary PEG subunit:<br><br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
The Preparation of Mono-Dispersed PEGs and Their Activated Forms<br>
[0322] Mono-dispersed or single molecular weight PEGs are prepared as shown below. By<br>
adjusting the size of the fragments generated, any size PEG is prepared. The diols are then<br>
mono-terminated via alkylation and activated for conjugation to a biological moiety such as a<br>
protein, sugar, lipid, or nucleotide.<br><br>
[0326] The third generation PEG extension is created as shown below.<br>
[0323] Leaving groups can be attached to the primary PEG subunit in order to create an<br>
activated primary PEG as shown below. In this reaction, Q can be any leaving group that is<br>
compatible with the chemistry of this invention. Exemplary leaving groups include halides,<br>
tresylates, tosylates and mesylates.<br><br><br>
[0328] The PEG extension process is terminated by reacting a mono-functionalized moiety<br>
with one of the bi-functional compounds. In this reaction, the mono-fimctionalized moiety is<br>
any group that is compatible with the chemistry of this invention. Exemplary terminating<br>
groups include alkoxy-PEG and alkyl.<br>
[0329] In the following exemplary embodiment, a leaving group is added to a methoxy-<br>
PEG subunit. This molecule is then reacted with a fourth generation PEG extension.<br><br>
[0330] In another exemplary embodiment, a methyl subunit is added to a fourth generation<br>
PEG extension.<br><br><br>
[0331] After terminating one end, the other end of the PEG extension is activated for<br>
bioconjugation as shown below. In this reaction, X is any leaving group that enables the<br>
formation of an ester. The symbol X is independently selected from imidazolyl, HOBt,<br>
HOAt, NHS, and p-nitrophenyl ester.<br><br>
[0332] Finally, the PEG extension molecule is conjugated to a biological moiety as shown<br>
below.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
[0333] There is no requirement that the activated mono-dispersed PEG must have the same<br>
number of PEG subunits as the extension molecules to which it reacts. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, the activated mono-dispersed PEG has a larger number of PEG subunits than<br>
the extension molecule to which it reacts. In another exemplary embodiment shown below,<br>
the activated mono-dispersed PEG has a smaller number of PEG subunits than the extension<br>
molecule to which it reacts.<br><br>
[0334] The termination process for these molecules is similar to the process described in<br>
Example 1.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
[0335] An excess of the activated PEG subunit can be added to create the mono-dispersed<br>
PEG shown below:<br><br>
[0336] By varying the ratio of reactants, the based used, temperature, solvent, and<br>
concentration, one can adjust the reaction to give the predominant size (n) desired.<br>
[0337] This approach provides a simple, fast, efficient way to prepare mono-dispersed<br>
PEGs of any size. Purification is simplified by this approach because of the differences in<br>
size (and therefore physicochemical characteristics) of the mono-dispersed PEGs. This<br>
allows the use of simple, standard purification techniques such as silica gel, reverse phase<br>
cellulose, membrane filtration (nanofiltration and ultrafiltration). The purified PEG diols are<br>
then derivatized into any functional form that is desired.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
The Production of AlkoxyPEGs<br>
[0338] The general approach shown below is used to prepare alkoxy-PEGs or other mono-<br>
functionalized PEGs.<br>
[0339] In a first embodiment, an activated bifunctionalized PEG molecule is created as<br>
shown below:<br><br>
wherein the symbol n represents a number between 1 and 100,000. The symbol Q represents<br>
any leaving group that is compatible with the chemistry of this invention. Exemplary leaving<br><br>
groups include halides, tresylates, tosylates and mesylates. The symbol X represents any<br>
counter ion that is compatible with the leaving group.<br>
[0340] This activated bifunctionalized PEG molecule is used to extend the length of a PEG<br>
molecule as shown below.<br><br><br><br>
wherein the symbol m represents a number between 1 and 100,000.<br>
[0341] In a second embodiment, a mono-functionalized PEG is extended and then activated<br>
for use in conjugation with a biological moiety as shown below.<br>
[O342] In a first step, a mono-functionalized PEG is tosylated.<br><br>
wherein the symbol n represents a number between 1 and 100,000.<br>
[0343] In a second step, the mono-functionalized PEG is extended<br><br>
wherein the symbol m represents a number between 1 and 100,000.<br>
[0344] In a final step, the extended mono-functionalized PEG compound is activated for<br>
conjugation to a biological moiety as shown below.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Additional Compositions and Methods for the Preparation of Bi-Antennary Polymers<br>
[0345] Additional bi-antennary structures of the invention have the following general<br>
formula:<br><br>
wherein the symbol X represents OH, H, Q (an activating group), and a biological moiety,<br>
such as a protein, sugar, lipid, or nucleotide. The symbol n represents a number between 1<br>
and 10. The term "polymer" can be PEG, mPEG (methoxy polyethylene glycol), PPG<br>
(polypropylene glycol), mPPG, polyglutamate, polyaspartate, polylactate, and polysialic acid.<br>
[O346] In an exemplary embodiment, the bi-antennary .structure has the following formula:<br><br>
wherein the symbols m and o independently represent numbers between 1 and 10,000. The<br>
symbol X represents OH, H, Q (an activating group), and a biological moiety, such as a<br>
protein, sugar, lipid, or nucleotide.<br>
[0347] In another exemplary embodiment, the bi-antennary structure has the following<br>
formula:<br><br><br>
wherein the symbols a and b independently represent numbers between 1 and 24. The<br>
symbols m and o independently represent numbers between 1 and 10,000. The symbol X<br>
represents OH, H, Q (an activating group), and a biological moiety, such as a protein, sugar,<br>
lipid, or nucleotide.<br>
[0348] While this invention has been disclosed with reference to specific embodiments, it is<br>
apparent that other embodiments and variations of this invention may be devised by others<br>
skilled in the art without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
