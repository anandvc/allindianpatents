Th= present: invention relates to means for sup¬porting a screening device in a frame structure with fr5.::.e rr.er.bers comprising top and bottorri mex.bers as well as side -embers and lining an opening in a building, in particular a door or a window, said means comprising a firsc pair of bracket members for mounting en each of a pair cz opposed parallel frame surfaces of said frame structure and a second pair of coupling members each provided wich means engageable by engaging means on said screening device, each of said bracket members and eSiCh of said coupling members further comprising engaging means for engagement of a coupling member with a bracket  member.<br>
Screening devices for v;indows and doors such as roller blinds, Venetian blinds, pleated blinds and iniernal and external shutters are conventionally supplied together with supporting brackets which are specifically adapted to the particular form of screen¬ing device and are engageable by engaging means pro¬vided on the screening device, typically at either end thereof. During installation of the screening device the sunporting brackets must be mounted by the user himself which frequently results in errors, in par¬ticular if different left-hand and right-hand brackets are mixe'd up.<br>
Alchouah it is also knovjn to incorporate support¬ing brackets for a specific type of screening devices in the frame structures of doors and windows during Che prcduccion thereof, so that the door or v;indow frame structure is supplied with premounted supporting brackets, such brackets have normally been designed for use with a specific kind of screening devices such as roller   blinds.     If    installation    of    another    kind    of<br><br>
screening devices such as a Venetian, blind is desired it has been necessary in such case tc replace the premounted supporting brackets by brackets specifically designed for the desired screening device.<br>
In addition, unavoidable production tolerances for the door or v/indov; frame structure may result in difficulties with respect to correct mounting of a screening device, whereby safe mounting of a screening device to the frame structure may occasionally only be obtained by use of additional fastening screv/s.<br>
In DE patent no. 30 48 333 supporting means for a roller blind is disclosed comprising two suoport plates, one of which is provided with a slot for receiving a square pin in one end of the spring roller tube of the roller blind in a rotationally locked manner and the other one is provided with a circular hole. For alternative mounting of a Venetian blind, each support plate is provided v/ith protrusions for engaging grooves in coupling mem.bers connected with the top casing of the Venetian blind, said members being pushed over the support plates. Subsequently, the side guide lists of the blind are mounted, said lists serving simultaneously as support for the coupling members and the cop casing of Che blind, i.e. as a safety against disconnection of the coupling m.ember from the support plate.<br>
Although this support arrangement allows for use of the same supporting brackets for different screening devices, a disadvantage of this design has been thac for use with a roller blind supporting brackets of different design for receiving the spring roller tube of the roller blind, i.e. the slot and the circular hole, respectively, are required.<br>
In US-A-3,614,045  a  supporting arrangement  is disclosed comprising elongate slotted rails secured to<br><br>
the side members of che frame structure ar.d exzendina throughout the height thereof and coupling nenbers pro¬vided with hook-shaped engaging members to engags in slots of said rails and projecEing ac righz angles in front of che frame structure. The less attractive appearance of this arrangem.enc limits its apolicacion to draperies, which v/ill hide the supporting arrange¬ment, and does noc qualify to meec current demands for an aesthetical and functional design of v;indov;3 and accessories like screening devices.<br>
EP-Al-0 , 465 , 433 discloses an arrangemen:: ccmcris-ing a pair cf identical tubus-shaped supoorting brackets secured to opposed surfaces of frarr.e side members, in each of v;hich a transverse recess is form.ed to receive a resilient clamping member of a form restoring the outer cylindrical form of the supporting brackets. This design is intended only for roller blinds having engaging means in the form of projecting cylindrical pins at either end.<br>
WO 96/07007 discloses a roller shade mounted between a pair cf supporting brackets projeccing at right angles from the front side of the frame structure and formed v;ith an undercut groove to receive a coupling member in the form of a slide engaged by the roller shade.<br>
In SE-B-415,904 a roller blind suppcrc is dis¬closed comprising a pair of L-shaped bracken m.embers in which edge flange portions on eicher side of a rec¬tangular slit are engaged by resilient legs of an insert slide which can be pushed into the recess and is engageable by engaging means on the roller blind.<br>
On this background it is the object of che inven¬tion to provide supporting means for mounting a screen¬ing device in a rectangular fram.e structure lining a building opening,  preferably on Che frame or sash<br><br>
structure of a windov;, which has an attractive design meeting rrodern days user demands in respect cf design quality and is easy and cheap to manufacture and the installation of '.vhich is simplified by a self-aligning design that may to a large extent compensate for production tolerances.<br>
An additional object is to provide a standard design of the first pair of supporting brackets which can be premounted on the frame structure at the produc¬tion site whereby simple installation of a variety of screening devices using various form of couoling members is made possible.<br>
According to the invention these objects are met by supporting means as identified above, characterized in that the bracket members of said first pair are identical standard members for mounting on said opposed frame surfaces, each comprising a relatively flat front part protruding from said frame surface in the mounted position of said bracket member and having a substan¬tially smooth external surface, and that said engaging means is provided by each coupling member and comprises first engaging means in the form of at least one contact surface on the coupling member engaging a circumferential surface part of a bracket member to provide temporary engagement therewith and non-resil¬ient second engaging means providing stable engagement of the coupling member viith respect to the frame structure.<br>
By forming the bracket members as identical standard m&gt;em.ber3 the production thereof will become simple and cheap. The bracket members may t^'pically be mounted on oppossd surfaces of the sash or fram.e side members facing the light area of a v/indow and immedi¬ately below the top member of the sash or frame. Alternatively, the bracket members may also be mounted.<br><br>
however, en opposed surfaces of the sash or zrane too and boo torn meT,bers for accomrriodacior. of a screening device '.-;hioh is rovabie in the horizontal direction. Moreover the bracket rr.embers may be raounced with the circumferenniaZ surface part providing for texoorary engagement with the contact surface of the coupling member expending either in the longitudinal direction of the frame or sash m.embars on v;hich they are m.ounted or transversely thereto. By the latter orientation the subsequent mouncing of the coupling members on the bracket members becomes particularly simple, since the coupling members miay be pushed onco che brackec members from the in::ernal side of the v/indov; in a direction at right angles to the plane of the window pane.<br>
Moreover, the provision of the engagemenc mieans in the form of first and second engagement m.eans for temporary and stable engagement of the coupling member with respecz co the bracket member and the framie or sash structure, respectively, facili;iates the installa¬tion of a screening device. As v/ill be further apparent from the following description the first engaging means can be designed for very easy temporary arrangement of the screening device with coupling members fcllov;ed by provision or a stable and reliable fastening cf the coupling members wich respect to frame or sash struc¬ture, while the coupling members are held in eem.porary engagem.ent v;ith respect to the bracket: m.embers.<br>
In general, the bracket members serve a tv/ofold purpose, namely on one hand to provide for accurate positioning of nhe coupling members and thereby the screening arrangement v;ith respect to the fram.e struc¬ture and, on !:he other hand, to accommodate the load of the screening arrangement after establishment of the stable engagement of the coupling member wich respect to the frame structure and transfer this load to the<br><br>
frame structure.<br>
Preferred, but non-limiting er.bodimencs of the supporting means according to the invention are stated in the dependen- claims.<br>
The invention will be described in the followina with reference to the schematic drawings, in which<br>
Fig. 1 shows an embodiment of the supporting means arranged on a side member of the frame or sash struc¬ture of a roof v;indow,<br>
Fig. 2 is a sectional view of the arrangement of the supporting means illustrated in Fig. 1,<br>
Figs. 3 and 4 show two alternative designs of a coupling member of the supporting means.<br>
Figs. 5 to 7 show further alternative embodiments of the supporting means.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a perspective view of an alternative embodiment of the supporting means arranged in the upper left-hand corner of a roof window,<br>
Fig. 9 shov;s a perspective view of a screening device, and<br>
Fig. 10 is a view corresponding to Fig. a but of the upper right-hand corner of the v/indow.<br>
Fig. 1 shov;s the upper right hand corner of a roof v.'indow with a frame structure including a horizontal top member 1 and a side member 2 extending in a verti¬cal plane. Conventicnally, the frame structure, which may constitute either the main frame of a stationary v;indow or the sash of an openable window, will comprise a bottom member opposed to and parallel v;ith the top member 1 and a left-hand side member opposed to the illustrated right-ha.nd side member 2, so that the top, bottom and side members together form a generally rectangular structure framing the v/indow pane 3.<br>
For installation of a screening arrangement such as a roller blind, a pleated blind, a Venetian blind or<br><br>
the like on the internal side of the v;indov.' pane 3 a bracket member 4 is secured to the side member 2 cf the frame structure close to horizontal top member 1 as vjeil as to the opposed left-hand side mem.ber, not illustrated in Fig. 1. The bracket members 4 are formed as a pair of identical standard members vjhich can be used for installation of various types of screening arrangements.<br>
As shown in the sectional view in Fig. 2 each bracket member 4 comprises a relatively flat front part 5 having a substantially smooth external surface and protruding from the surface of the frame side member 2 and a base section 6 secured in a hole or recess 7 in the fram.e side member 2 by means of pins 8 provided with external threading 5 or other suitable profiling to secure firm retainment of the pins in corresponding predrilled bores 10 in the fram.e side member 2, once the bracket member 4 has been pushed or driven into the side member 2. Typically, the front part 5, the base section 6 and the projecting profiled pins 8 of the bracket m.ember 4 are formed in a single integrated piece, e.g. as a cast or moulded member of a suitable metal or plastic or a composite material.<br>
In the embodiment in Figs. 1 and 2 the front part 5 of the bracket mem.ber is formed as a generally rectangular flat plate member v;ith two pairs of mutual¬ly parallel sides 11 and 12, respectively, but as v;ill appear from the following description various alterna¬tive shapes of the front part of the bracket member are equally possible.<br>
The projecting front part 5 of each bracket member 4, v/hich v/ill tyoically be pre-mounted on the v;indow frame in connection v/ith the production of v/indov;s, serves to receive and support a coupling member 13 supplied as one of a pair of coupling members together<br><br>
v;ith the screening arrangement. As shown m Fics. 3 to 10 the coupling member is provided v,-ith means engaae-abie by engaging means on the screening device typical¬ly provided at either end of the screening device. For a screening device in the form of a roller blind the coupling member may e.g. be provided v;ith a scuare hole 14 as shown in Fig. 3 to receive an end shafc of the v;inding rod or tube of the blind in a rotationally locked manner.<br>
In accordance with the present invention the bracket and coupling members are provided v.'ith engaging means which comprises first engaging means in the form of at least one contact surface on the coupling member engaging a circumferential surface part of the bracket member to provide temporary engagement therev.dth and non-resilient second engaging means providing stable engagement of the coupling m.ember with respect to the v;indov,' frame structure.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figs. 1 to 3 the square hole  14 constituting the means engageable by the screening arrangement is provided in a rigid plate section 15 of the coupling member 13 v/hich is connected V7lth an L-shaped arrangement of two legs 16 and 17, which as shQv;n by the arrov; A in Fie. 1 can be pushed onto the bracket member 4 from the internal side of the frame structure in a direction at right angles to the side member 2 with the legs 16 and 17 engaging adjoin¬ing side edges 11 and 12 of the projecting front part 5 of the bracket m.ember 4. Thereby, the surfaces of legs 16 and 17 facing the open recess 18 defined by legs 16 and 17 and plate section 15 form contact surfaces of the coupling member 13 engaging circumfer¬ential surface parts of the bracket member 4 form.ed by side edges 11 and 12 to provide temporary engagement of the couolina member 13 with the bracket member 4.<br><br>
Subsequently, stable engagement of the coupling member 13 with respecc to the fran-e scructiure is established by second engaging means v^hich as shown may comprise a nail or screw 19 introduced through a hole 20 in one of legs 16 and 17 in^o the underlvina side member 2 .<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 and 3 the temporary position¬ing of rhs coupling m.ember 13 may be further facili¬tated by forming the free end of one of the legs such as the leg 15 with snap engagement means such as a short hook 21 engaging the onher of the shore sides 12 of the bracket member 4.<br>
In the embodiraenc shown in Fig. 4 the L-shaped arrangement of legs 16 and 17 connected with the plate section 15 in Fig. 3 has been, replaced by a U-shaped configuration of legs 22 projecting from a bottom piece 23 of the coupling member 24 . As in the emibodiment in Fig. 3 the free end of each of projecting legs 22 is formed with hook-shaped snap engagement means 25.<br>
The coupling member 24 in Fig. 4 may be easily brought into tem.porary engagement v/ith the rectangular front part 5 of the bracket member 4 in Fig. 1 by sliding the U-shaped configuration of legs 22 upv/ards in the longitudinal direction of the frame side member 2 as illustrated by the arrow B. Thereby, the project¬ing legs 22 will provide sufficient elastic deform.a-bility to allow the snap engagement means 2 5 at the free end of each of legs 22 to get into snap engagement with the upper long side 11 of the front part 5 of the bracket member, when the coupling member 24 is pushed upwards to bring the bottom piece 23 inco contact with the lower long side 11. Subsequently, stable engagement of the coupling member with respect to the frame structure may be established in the same way as described above by m.eans of a nail or screw introduced<br><br>
into the frame side member 2 through a hole 27 in tha bottom piece 23.<br>
As shown in Figs. 5 to 10 various other designs of the bracket and coupling TTiarr.bers is possible. In Fig. 5 the front part 23 of the bracket member is formed generally as a trapeze v;ith upper and lower sides 29 and 30 converging towards each other in the direction from the window pane 31 towards the internal side of the frame structure with the horizontal top member 32 and the side rr.ember 23. As in the embodiment in Fig. 3 the coupling member comprises an L-shaped configuration of legs 34 and 35, of which the leg 34 is formed, however, with a wedge-like shape, v/hereby temporary engagement of the coupling member with the bracket member can be provided by sliding the coupling m.ember onto the bracket member from the internal side of the window frame in the direction of arrow C, until the wedge-like leg 34 is squeezed between the inclining upper side 29 of the front-part 28 and the underside of the horizontal frame top member 32. Stable engagement of the coupling member with respect to the frame structure may then be provided in the same way as described in the foregoing by introducing a nail or screw into the frame side member 33 through a hole 35 formed e.g. in leg 3 5 of the coupling member.<br>
A temporary engagement of the coupling memiber with the bracket member by squeezing a leg of the coupling member may also be obtained e.g. with bracket and coupling members formed as shown in Figs. 1 and 3 by mounting the bracket member 4 on the frame side member 2 with a spring bias in the direction tov/ards the horizontal frame top m.ember 1 corresponding to the direction of arrow B, whereby the hook-shaped snap engagement m,eans 25 in Fig. 3 may be dispensed with. The sDrina bias of the bracket m.ember may be obtained<br><br>
as shov;n in dashed lines in Fig. 2 by means of a soring such as a leaf spring 37 interposed becv/een che under¬side 3 8 of the base section 6 of the bracket member 4 and the opposed edge part 3 9 of the hole or recess 7 in the frame side member 2.<br>
Alternatively, a spring bias can be provided by means of a spring acting between the upper side of the bracket member and the contact surface of the coupling member in engagement therewith, e.g. by means of a leaf spring mounted in the underside of the corresponding leg 34 of the coupling member, or as described in further detail below in connection with the embodiment of Figs. 8 to 10 .-<br>
In Fig. 6 an embodiment is shown, in which the front part 40 of the bracket member is generally circu¬lar and the coupling member 41 comprises a generally L-shaped configuration of legs 4 2 and 43, in which the underside of leg 42 forming a contact surface for engagement with the upper circumferential edge part 44 of the bracket member is formed with a curvature matching the circular curvature of the front part 40. In the same way as described above the teiriporary engagement betv/een the coupling and bracket m.embers may be assisted by mouncing the bracket member in the frame side member 45 v/ith a spring bias in the direction of arrow D.<br>
As shown in Fig. 7 the temporary engagement of the couDling memher with respect to the bracket member may alternatively be obtained by forming the contact surface 4 6 provided by one leg 4 7 of an L - shaped configuration and the circumferential surface part 48 of the front oart 4 9 of the bracket member with interfitting crofile shapes such as a projecting notch 50 from the contact surface 4 6 and a recess 51 for receiving said notch in the surface part 4S.<br><br>
whereas in Figs. 4 to 7 only the part of ccuplinc mambers serving to provide temporary and stable engage¬ment with respect to the bracket members and the frama structure, respectively, are shown, it is understood that in each embodiment the coupling member v;ili also comprise means, such as the square hole 14 in the plate section 15 shown in Fig. 3, engageable by ir,atirj.g m.eans o£ the screening device.<br>
An alternative embodiment is shown in Figs. 8 to 10, in which the coupling members 73,83 to be arranged on bracket members 64 each comprises a mainly disc-shaped configuration. The bracket members 64 may be of substantially the same design as described in connec¬tion with the above embodiments, eg. as the one of Figs.  1 to 3,  and is r:\ounted or. the side members 62a,62b of the frame structure close to the adjoining horizontal frame member 61. Each coupling member 73,83 has on its back side, not shown, contact surfaces for engaging at least the upper of the long sides 71 of the front part 65 of the bracket m.ember 64 for providing the  temporary  engagement  therewith.  In  order  to increase the effect of the temporary engagement, each coupling member 73,83 has at its upper side mieans for squeezing the coupling member 73,33 between the upper long side 71 of the front part 65 of the bracket member 64 and the adjoining horizontal frame member 61. In the embodiment shown, these means comprise a flap 75,85 protruding at an angle from the upper side of the coupling members 73 and 83, respectively, and providing a spring bias between the upper frame member 61 and the bracket member 64. Of course, two or more flaps may be provided, either side by side, successively or in other geometrical arrangements. Alternatively, the squeezing means may comprise a wedge-like protrusion on the upper side of each couolinq m.ember.<br><br>
As ir. the embodiments described in the above, stable engagement of the coupling r.embsr '3,83 wich respect to the frame structure is subsequently estab¬lished by second engaging means which may comprise a nail or screw introduced through a hole £0, 9C and into the underlying side member 62a,£2b.<br>
In order to further facilitate zha arrangement of the screening device on the supporting means, each of the holes SO, 90 is provided v/ith a circunferential fin 81, 91 for temporary retention of the fastening m.err'.ber.<br>
In Fig. 9 is shov;n a screening device in the shaoe of a roller blind 100 having ac one end a square or rectangular pin 101. The means en the coupling member 73 which are engageable by said pin 101 comprise an adapter piece 76 having a cross-section v/hicb is asymmetric with respect to at least one axis and fitting into a socket 74 on the coupling mieraber 73. As indicated, the adapter piece 76 may be provided together with the screening device and may comprise an arc-shaped slit 73. The engaging m^eans on the opposite coupling member S3 may as shown comprise &amp; pin 84 v;hich fits into a corresponding hole, not shov/n, in the end of the roller blind v/hich is opposite the end having the square or rectangular pin 101.<br><br><br>
