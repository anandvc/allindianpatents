2.	DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART:<br>
Optical disks are classified into a read-only type which only allows for re~roduotion of recorded data and ~ rewritable type whioh allows the user to record data thereon. A read-only optical disk has tracks formed<br>
a sp±r~l or shape on a disk substrate. An array o~ pita are pt~ysioally formed along the tracks in a0~ordan~* i4ith i c~rm~t4.oz~ ~o be recozded. A rewritabl. ord data on the disk, the disk i. irradisted with a laser b!~rn along the tracks, and the intensity of the laser beam is modulated in accordance with the data to be reQorded so a~ to form regions with different optical properties (recording marks) on the recordIng layer.<br><br>
In an optical disk, generally, one treck corresponding to one rotation of the optical disk 4 divided irLtQ a pli~ra1ity of sectors as units for recording and ~~p~o4uc±ng d~ts (data units) so as to manage the posit~r~p oi necessary data on the cpticsl disk end realize high-ppeed data retrieval.<br><br>
A read-only optical disk and a rewr±table optical d±s~c hays dift~rsnt d*ta formats and modulation codes from each other. In order to allow the user to record data every vector, the data format of th~ rewritable optical disk is required to have, for example, a region for  the laser power at the head of a recording rsg~.o~ of each sector and a region for absorbing a var±at±0~i of th~ rotation of a spindle motor at the end of th~ r~oor4±ng ±egion. In the ease of the read-only 0~tic~l d±~ where no 4ata 4.s rewritten by the user, ±nforniat±on has been rsc~rded on th. optical disk at the pro~oticn of the opticel disk with high precision, and no by <br>
Mv$n~ a ~-~~ritable ar~ and a read-only area. The ~tc~ d4g1~ 301 has a r*oord±ng ~.ayer formed on a disk<br>
aubstrate so that the uwer can record and reproduce data on ~~id from the optic4 disk. Referring to Figure 21, the.ca± 4isk 301.u4.s read-only areas 302 and 303 The oviter en4 inner portions thereof, respectiv4y, mr4 a area 305 located between the areas 3Q2 and 303.<br><br>
Xra the read-only areas 302 and 303, information and ~ata heve b~en previously recorded by forming physi-. cal pit arrays 304. In the rewritable area 305, grooveshaped guide tracks 30P have been praviously formed so that ~he user cap record and reproduce information and data by tracking the grooves of the tracks (groove<br>
adjacent grooves (land tracks).<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PJtEFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br><br>
The present invention will be described by way of exaspisa with referenc, to the accompanying drawings.<br><br>
(Eternple 1)<br>
An d~tioal disk of Example 1 according to the vr~s*t~t tnvAntibn has a ~'*.or4tnq ~.tyar formed on S disk sul~$trete sq a* to al4ow the u;er to record and reproduce data o~i and from the optical 4$*k.<br><br>
Referring tQ Figure Z, an optical disk 1. of<br><br>
Example 1 ±rieluds4 repd-only areas 2 and S located on the<br>
outer and inner portions thereof, respectively, end a<br>
rewritable area 5 located between the read-only areas 2<br>
and 3.<br><br>
In the reed-only areas 2 and 3, pit rows are physically formed ~s tracks. The length and position of each pit in thR pit robes have been determined in actordeno0 with reed-only data rpcordAd on the reed-only<br>
2 end 3. In the rewritabla area B, guide grooves (gui4~ trac$~s) 6 are formed in a spiral or concentric shape on the disk substrate. Information and data are<br><br><br>
ecorded along the grooves (groove tracks) or lends between adjacent grooves (lend tracks). Hereinbelow, the groove tracks and th* ~.and tracks are collectively ref erred to ~ information tracku. In Figure 1, the optics], disk 2. is shown to have spiral tracks on either area.<br><br>
Each Qt the information tracks in the rswr±tabls 6154 5 is div±4ed into a ~lutaJ4ty of sectors. Each seo~o$~ ti~o~r4es a ttret he;d.r region having identificati~ri data Lot id*nt±tying the sector and a first data rep$on for •tot4.ng ta.er d4ta b~ tcr~itng reoor~ing marks fri ~hazginq tht optical propsrtteb o~ the recording lay0t.

In this we~y, t~y 4±viding cRab track correspon4$ng to one rotation o42 the optiopi disk into a plurality of sectors C date uriit~), 41aha~eIn0nt ot th; positions at necessary date on th'~ 0pt*0&amp;.L 4i@~t and hi~h-#peed data retrieval can be realised.<br><br>
Figures 2k to 211 shows data formats of the op*±opl disk 2. of this example. A data format in the reVritable area 5 will be first described. Figure 2A shows an exemplified data format of each sector 10 in the rewtitable area 5, and Figure ZC shows a ~hysica1 configuration of the information track corresponding to the sector 10 of Figure 2k. Figure 2k shows data formats of two ad3apent intormation trsckp, i.e., a groove track 7<br><br>
od~rpond~n~ to th, gu4.de track 6 and a lend track S adjacent to the groov* track 7, for comparison' with the phy~cal corifig~.zrat±ons thereof shown in Figure 2C. Such 4 groove track 7 and ],and track B alternately appear in th~ rew~itable area S of the optical disk 1. The user can record desired information (user data) on both the groove tr4ck 7 end the land track 8 by tracking the groove track 7 and the land track 8 separately.<br><br>
~efe~ring to Figure 2A, the sector 10 includes a first head•~ region 12. (sector identification data PIDi ~n4 PZt~~) er~4 ~ infor~nat4.on region ~0 A mirror mark<br>
~ (P.1) 4r$4 a g~p reg±ot~ 13 (GAPe and cAPb) are foriitad ~t~eri lhe first h~e4er region 11 and the inforniat*cr~ ±*~ion ~Q. The 4.~fortnat±on region 20 includes a first durtuny 4sta region 15 (VPO region (VPOa and VFOb)), a first data region 17 (DATAa and DATAb), and a guard de~a region ±5 (ODe and Gob) e~ will be described later in detail. A b4ffer region ~ (BUFa and BU?b) is formed between the information region 20 and a first header region 12.' of a next ueot~r 10'. The affix a of the above abbreviated codes (e.g., VFOa and DATAa) indicates that the regions are formed on the groove track 7, while the affix b (e.g., VFOb and DATAb) indicates that the r•g~o~s are formed on the lpnd tzaok B. This i~ also app iC4~.. in t~0 *ollowirig description un~ems otherwise<br><br><br>
~eferring to Figure 2C, the first header regio~ 1 ir~olude* a phy~±oa],].y formed pit row 21. (21a and Zib). The wi4~b of each pit of the pit row 21 in the radi4,di~rsction of thC optioaZ disk ~. is substantially equal to the width of t:h~ guide groove 6 (groove<br><br><br>
track 7). The pit rows 21a and 22.b are displaoed outward end inward from the Center line of the guide groove 6 (i.e~., wobbled) by abo4t a qu~rter of the pitch of the g'44e groove 6 (i.e., groove pitch Tp). In this example, ~ 4rst hea4~r region 4 is divided, into a former half ~.2.e and ~ latter half lib. The pit row 21a correspond±~ t~ ~e fox'me~ half 24.. i* displaced outward to th~ p~r*phe~y of the opt4.oal disk 1, while the pit rc$~ 214, o respr~n4inp to the latter half lib in displaced i~wax'd.<br><br>
With this displaa~~r~t of the pit rows 21. and ~ ~x'om t~ oenter line of the guide groove 6 (groove track 7), tho first beader regIon 12. can be commonly used ~pv *ex'vp tr~ck~.ng of both the groove track 7 and the 1,eri~ track 8. Th~is, ~~arat• exclu~±ve header regionu<br>
t~a groove traQk 7 arid the land track 8 are not r~iq4rs~~.<br><br>
Zf esolusive header regions ~re requ±red for the gx'oove track 7 and the lend track 8, a width of the pit rows eh~uld be smaller than the width of the guide groove 6 so that the respective pit rows on the groove track 7 and the lend track 8 do not overlap each other. Suoh ~ narrow pit may be formed by using a light beam different from a light beam for cutting the guide groove 6. It is difficult, however, to keep stable the positional precision between the two beams.<br><br>
In th±~ ~xan~ple, a l.{g~t beam for cutting the gui4p groove ~ is ~o~bled 4~htwerd aM leftward from the ce~.in~ of the ;~4de groove ~ (gr~ove track 7) using an AO m~4ulato~ atid the ii~ to form the pit row 21 of<br><br>
..the first header region 11. Thus, the pit row 21 can be farmed on the optical diSk 1 easily with high .precision withoUt using another b~am for cutting.<br><br>
The mirror mark region ~.2 following the header region 11 is used to determine whether the groove track 7 or the land track 8 is being tracked.<br><br>
The ~ap region 13 (~.3a and 13b) i. formed on the<br>
~	7 ~M the lan4 track S to avoid a head 14 of<br>
t~p i o~t.ic~ ~*g*.on 20 from overlapping the mirror<br>
m~ar~ ~gi~h ~ ot 'the ii~st header region 11 when a<br>
jL~er o~cure due to the rotation 0f the optl.oal disk 1.<br><br>
Veer da~a is reoo~ded on the information reg~on 20, which indludes t~ first dummy data region 15 (VPOa and VFQb), th~ first data region 17 (DATAa and DATAb), and the guard data region 18 (~Da and GDb) as deScribed above (see Figure ~). Information is recorded on the information region ~0 by irradiating the recording layer formed on the optical disk 2. with a laser beam to ohange the optical properties (reflectance) of the repordi~g la~'er. for exafl~ple, an irradiated portion of the r~Q~r4~.11g layer n~ay b~ changed from a cryutalline state to St~ Q~phOua state so as to form a recording mark with a reflectance different from the other per<br>
~	As ~hown In ~ur~ 2C, a recording mark array 22.<br>
is ~ ofl th~ groo~~• treok 7. whilS a recording mark a~'r~t ~*b is ferm~d on the land track 8.<br><br>
Th~ iikst dummy data region IB is a VFO region a speoi~o pattern is recorded so as to promptly<br>
~~biJ.ize clock the Pt4~ of the r~pro44ctiork signal pro-<br><br><br>

Desired User data including an error correction code Is r~0ordsd on the tirat data region, 17. The gu4rd data rept0n 15 is formed at the end of the first 4iste rpgion 17 to ensure ths stability of the reproduction 5ignAl processing circuit,<br><br>
The )~uf*er rSg±on 19 ino~.u4es no data but is forTn~d to pvoi4 the end of the information region 20 from ovsrlepp*ng the hea4er region ii' of the next sector 10' When * jitter occurs due to the rotation of the optical disk 1.<br><br>
Thub, in the rewritable area B. data is recorded on the groove track 7 and the land track B in accordance with the c~ata formats described above.<br><br>
Then, a data format in the read-only areas 2 and 3 will be described with reference to FIgures 25 and 2D. Figure 28 shows Sn exemplified data .format of each ssoto~ 30 of th~ read-only areas 2 and 3, and Figure 3D schematically illustrates a physical configuration of the track corresponding to the sector 30 of Figure 23.<br><br>
Zn thp read-only arpas 3 and ~, a track 9 is ccIiflpQ0e4 0~ S $~t0-reoorqed pit row 29 (a pro-pit row). As shown 4.n Pigurt 2~, the pit rows are formed in accor4e.ncp w4.th thp tsarfle physicp.l format over the entire data rj~ion $fl thp rpfl4-only e;eas 2 and 3. More specifically, the width of the pit row 29 ,in the radial direction of th. optical disk 2. is smaller than the width (groove<br><br>
width) of the guide groQvs 6 (groove track 7) formed in the rewritable area 5, and all the pits are lined substant±41y along the center line o~ the track.<br><br>

It will be p~-ef~rable fat. pract4.cRl infor~nation recording/reproduction 4.* the septors in the read-only areas 2 and 3 and the rewritable area 5 can ~e mAnaged in a same manner and the processing such as sector retrieval are unified. To realize thi$ unified processing, in this exampi., the length of each sector and the lengths of the header ~gion and the data region of each sector in the read-only area 2 and 3 are made squal to those in the<br>
i~r$ta~e a:~a 5 to match the data form&amp;t in the readonly ~ with that in th~ rswritabl~ area.<br><br>
A specific data ~orznat in the read-only areas 2 ar4 3 wi-lI. be described as an example. Referring to F~u~4 35, the Sector 30 inoludes a second header reg4on 31 (~eotor id.ntifica~±on data PI~l and P1D2) and a peoohd data region 37. A pRoond dummy data region 35 (VFOl) is fa~m~d between the ~~cond header region 31 and t~. ~eccr~ data rpgion 37. A third dummy data region 38 (VFO2) is Lormed between th9 sRccnd data region 37 and a s~cond header region i3' of a next sector 30'.<br><br>
Referrizig to 1~ig~re ZD, the pit row 29 of the eecon4.head~r reg~on ~2. t~ ~.ined eubstantially along the cent~ 1in~ o~ the track 9, not di-ipleced outward or<br><br>
±nw~rd a~ in the first he~d~r region 11 in the rewritable ares. 5~ Th. width of ths pit row ~9 in the read-only a~*4~ 3 or 3 ~ the radial dirsotion of the optical di~k 1 is ~llsz then th~ groove width unlike the width ~t th* p4.t row 31 in t~ rewr4.table area 5 which is sub~r~t±al.ty ~q'4pl to th~ groove width.<br><br>
In t~e second data region 37, p1-so, the pit row Ms ~,en prsviously formed substantially along the center lir~ of the tr*ok 9 on th0 optical disk 2. in accordance wi-th the d~'ta tot recording.<br><br>
Ae is observed fron~ F±~ures 2k and 28, the first header ie~ion 11 in the rewritpble area 5 and the second header region 31 in the read-only areas 2 and 3 are the same in the data capacity, the data format (signal sequence), and the modulation codes. Also, the first data region 17 in the rewritsble area 5 and the second d4~ta region 37 in the read-only areas 2 and 3 are the same in the data capacity, the data format (signal ~o~uence), and the modulation codes.<br><br>
Further, as shown in Figures 2A and 21, a head (at*xt ~ing) 16 of the first data region 17 in the<br>
wr4.te$ie area ~ and a ~ad (wtart timing) 36 in the uecon4 4ata r~ion 37 ir~ the ;ead-on2.y areas 2 and 3 are matched with each other.<br><br>
Thug, by vising th~ same ~formpts (signal sequences) ~or the first and second header regions ii and 31 and for the first and second data regions 17 and 37 in the rewrj,tebls area S and th~ read-only areas 2 and 3, one reproduction signal processing circuit car. be shared by<br><br>
both the rewr4.tabl~ area S an4 the read-only areas 2 and 3, •nd thus th~ circuit size can be reduced.<br><br>
Tbe ~econ4 dumx~iy data r~gicn 35 ~s formed to prevent the eervo traok±n~ from becoming unstable due to d±soon~±nuat±on of trso~ng error signals which may occur if no pit row i~ formed bot~een the second header region 31 aM th~ seobnd data region 37. The second dummy data region 35 includes, for example, a specific data pattern of the same modulation code as that used for the f±rpt dummy data ~epion (VFO region) 15 ±n the rewritable area 5. With this arrangement, it is possible to promptly and stably clock the FLL of the reproduction signal processing circuit. Random data or any other data may also be us*d to stabilize the servo tracking.<br><br>
~bm third d4m~ny date region 38 is formed to p~event th• servo track±r~ from becoming unstable due to discontinuation of tracking error signals, as in the sI3coM dummy data region 35.<br><br>
As above, in the r!ad-oril.y areas 2 and 3, t~ pit rows both in th* second hsader region 31 and ~ie sscon4 da~A region 37 a~o lined ~ubstantial1y along t~ip oent~r lt~s of the t~aok 9. Turther, the second and t~i~d d#~ reg~on~ ~ and 38 £411 the apace between the •econd header region 21 of tM sector 30 and the s*cc*$ detp ~ior~ 37 o~ the sector 30 and the space bet~~p th~ ~cor~4 data ~eg±on 37 ~f the meOtor 30 and t~hs p~oon~j t~a4#r r~gi.or~ 32.' of the next sector 30'. As a t~*u1t, the phy8ical arrangement of the pit row 29 is ur~iforrn alon~ the track 9 o~sr the entire read-only a~e~s 2 3r~d 3.<br><br>
Thus, according to the data format of the optical d4.*ft 1 o~ ~xe~t~p2.e 1, the first header region 11 is ai~p~n~n2.y ~.i*e4 ~ the treoking of both of the groove t~k 7 and the l*nd trao~ 8. Thus, separate exclusive h',o~~r ~ ~or the groove track 7 and the land trRo~( ~ ar~ ~ot required.<br><br>
~hs ~ header region 12. can be easily aM pr~ci~~y fo~rfled oh the optical disk by wobbling a l.t~ht bea~n for o'.~tting the guide groove 6 (groove traC)c 7) v±ghtward and l~ftward from the track center, a s~,parate exclusive light source for forming 'the first header region is not required. Thus, the preformat in the rewritable area 5 of the optical disk 1 of this example can be easily formed by use of a single light source for c~.itting, reducing the circuit size of the recording/reproduoing apparatus for this optical disk.<br><br>
F±g~Vire 3 is a b~.ock diagram schematically showing ~ r~producti0n signal processing section of an optical di~1~ r*o0r~±rig/reprOducing apppjratus 2.00 for recordi~q/r.$~roduoing c~eta on/from the optical dlsk 1 of this e~~niplp. R~t~rriflg to Vigure ~, the reproduction signal p~oceesing s*ct4~n of the optical disk recordi~g/rspro4uOiflg •~paratu* 100 includes a 2-part optical deteotp~ 1~, a summing amplifier 12.1, a differential ampJ4fier 2.12, a switoh circuit 2.13, a digitizing circuit 114, &amp; PLL (phase-locked loop) 2.15, a PID reproductIon circuit 116, a timing generator 117, a demodulator 118, and an envelope detector 120.<br><br>
The 2-part optical detector 2.10 (parts llOa and liob)' which is disposed in an optical head (not ehown)<br><br><br><br><br>
ri~cive~ ~eotwc~ light from the groove t.r'~ck 7 and the lend trpCl% ~ (the recording n~ar1~ arrays 22 and the pit rowe 22.) in the rewr±t~4e area 5 o~ the eptical disk 1 and z-e~lecte~i light from the tx'aok 9 (the pit row 29) in the read-only ~reas 2 and 3, and converts the reflected light into a reproduction signal.<br><br>
The swtirning amplifier 111 generates a sum signa4. 81 indic&amp;t±ng the sum of two detection signals obtained from the two parts liQa and ilOb of the 2-part optical detector 110 to supply to the switch circuit 113. Thp d±ff~rential amplifier 112 generates a difference signal 8~ ~epz~e~en'ting the dif~erence between the two 4s~ect4.on si0nali to su~p2.y to the envelope detector 120.<br><br>
~rfr 5~itoh circuit 113 switches between the sum<br>
~	$1 ~n4 t~e differ*noe signal 12 to supply either si~n4 to th~ dig±t±ziitg circuit 114. The envelope &amp;~t~ctor 1~O 4etects en •nvelop0 in the difference<br>
•i~na1 S~. ~har~ en a~np~.ittad~ el~oeeding a predetermined ~hrs~hold i~ observed iz~ the dift~rerkoe signal 82, a cc,ntrc~1 s4gpal 83 Lu uupp:Lied to the switch circuit 113 ~Q force t~i~ switch cirouit 113 to sw4tch to output the 444 e~enc~ ~ig~al 52 as an output signal 14.<br><br>
t~ the case of u~±ng the data formats shown in Fig~irep 2A to 2~, the difference signal 82 is obtained OrxJ4' whprx the reproduction signal is obtained from the first header region 2.1 in the rewritable area 5, as will bo deacr±be~ later ±n ~ptail. Accordingly, as shown in Figure 2~, the control signal 83 output from the envelope ds~ector 120 becomes high only when the first header region 2.1 in the rewritable area 5 is detected. The<br><br>
output ui~na1- 64 f±'on~ the switch circuit 113 is therefore equa~ to the &amp;Lff~r,nce ~ignal 82 Qnly when- the first hsad.r r~gIor~ ~.l is d~tected, Otherwise, the output signal 84 i~ oqua2. to the sum signal 51. That is, the 5u311 signq~. $2. is output ~rorn the ewitch circuit 113 as the outpl.at signal 84 when the reproduction signal is obtained from th~ information region 20 in the rewritable ares 5 ~nd the entire re~d-only areas 2 and 3.<br><br>
The output signal 84 from the switch circuit 113 (the •surn signal Si or the difference signal 52) is supplied to the digitizing circuit 114. The digitizing circuit 114 digitizes the output signal 84 into a binary signal in accordance with a threshold set for each of the suni signal 81 and the difference signal 52, for example, an~ outputs a digital signal S5 to the PLL 115.<br><br>
P~4. l1~ ~tr~ci-tu a reproduction clock from the 4$gi.t4~. p4.gnal $8 axi4 outputs the reproduction clock tc th~ ~D r~product4.pn Oircuit 12.6 which reproduces a sector ±dent~.f±cation signal from the header region. The titnin~ gen0ratOr 12.7 det~rznines the start timing (the heeds 16 and 36 of the data regions shown in Figures 2A and 25) for reading the u~er data recorded on the data regions 17 and 37 based on the sector identification signal from the PID reproduction circuit 2.16, to initiate the demodulator 118 by supplying a control signal 16. The demodulator 2.18 demodulates the user data and outputs the r~sults.<br><br>
~ereinbelow, the wavefor~tis of the signals obts~n~d whAr~ reoord*4 det~ on the information track in the r~i#z'tt~b1e area ~ (i.e.. user data already recorded on<br><br>
the information r~g±on 20) is reproduced until it is c~nvertsd into a binary ~ign~l will be. described. Figure 20 is an output waveform of the sum signal Si obtained fxom the rewritable area 8, and Figure 27 is an outpvt waveform of the ~i~ferenca signal 82.<br><br>
Au shown in Figure 20, the portion of the sum signal 81 corresponding to the first header region 11 in the rewr±t~b1-e area 5 is not detected by t~±e digitizing ~:Lro1V1it 114 because an amplitude 42. thereof is smaller ihan a ~r*determin.d ~hrpuhold 40 for digitizing. The reft~~on why the amplitu4e 4Z iii small is that the pit row of the first header reqion 11 is slightly displaced outward (the forwar 1~a~t ila) or inward (the latter hedf lib) frott th~ center line of the groove track. This c~ses a 14.~ht beam ~c~m th, optical head to be 4i~rWcted by the pit ro~ 21a and lib and thus reduces ~ie light amount received by the optical detector 110.<br><br><br>
Orj the contrary, an amplitude 42 of the sum<br>
•4~gnal 81 corr~spcnding ~o the information region 20 in the r~writa~l~ area B •~c.Cdo the threshold 40 for dicing beceu~e the recording mark array 22 is formed along th~ c~nt0r line of the ±nform~tion track. The sum signal 81 is therefore deteoted by the digitizing circtiit 114, and the reprod~ction signal is obtained.<br><br>
Figure 2F shows an output of the difference signal 82 obtained from the rewritable area 5. Since the pit row 21. in the former half ha of the first header region 11 is displaced outward, a larger amount of refiected light from the pit row 21a is diffracted to the outward part ilDa of the 2-part optical detector 110.<br><br><br><br>
Aooozdingly, the d4Vff~r.nos signal 52 output from the 2-part optical. 4e~ootor 110 ha~ an ampl±tude 51a which e.~oaedo a po*it4.ve thrashold 50. ~or d*gitizing as shown in F±gur~ 2?. The difference signal 52 is therefore di*tecte~ by the digitizing oircuit 114, and the reproduct4.on signal is obtained.<br><br>
Likewise, since the pit row 21h in the latter half llb o~ the first header region 13. is displaced inward, a J.ar~er s.mount of reflected light from the pit ~QW 21b is diffracted to the inward part liOb of the 2-<br>
part optical detector 110. Accordingly, the difference s.L~na1 $2 output from the 2-part optical detector 13.0 has<br>
azi ~mplitud~ 81~ which exoe~4g a negative threshold SOb ~ ~i±~itiz±~g s~ shown in F4,gure 27. 'Vhs difference s:L~n4 52 is there~or~ detected by the digitizing ciroui* ~.14, s.r~4 1~il~ re~ro4uotion •ignal is obtained.<br><br>
On th~ contrary, in the information region 20 in the rewritable area 5, since the recording mark array 22 is formed aJong the center line of the information track, the light amounts received by the outward and inward<br>
parts hOp and hlOb Qf the 2-part optical detector 110 are substantially the same~ Therefore, an amplitude 52 o1 the difference signal 82 is too small to reach the thre~hold 52.~ (5Th) for digitizing as shown in Figure 27. Likewise, in the r~ad-o~ly areas 2 and 3. since the pit rc~w ~9 ie forc~ie4 alor~g the center line of the track 9, th. light amQunts received by the outward and inward p~±ts IlOa and 2.10~ c~ the 2-pert optical detector 110<br>
•~ subota~t4elly the s4.jne. The d±~ference signal S2 is ~u~1anti,lly z~ot otatpw~. Therefore, in the regions oth~r then the first header region 11, the difference<br><br>
signal $2 i. not detected by the binary detector 114, and thus no reproduotion i±gnal is obtained.<br><br>
Figure 211 shows en output waveform of th. sum s:Lgnal $2. obtained from the read-only areas 2 and 3. Referring to Figure ~H, since the pit row 29 i* formed 4~.dn~ th~ cen*!r line ~f the track 9 for servo tracking<br>
*n the re~d".on~.y areas ~ and 3, the sum signal 51 has an ar~plitud~ 4~ suff±c±ent3.y large to be detected by the b~nary detsctor 114. Thersf ore, si~na2.s from all the regions in tile repro4~ction-on2.y area~ 2 and 3 including the second header region 31 and the ~eoond data' region 37<br>

Thus, in the optical disk recording/reproducing ~pparatus iQO for rep'oducing information from the o~tic&amp;l di~1~ 1 with th~ abQve~.described data formats, i~4~ ~he convenflon~l •pparat~s, separate reproduction<br>
s4gnai p±oosseinp circuits for the rewritable area and th~ r~p~odi.~otion-v~2.y area are not required, but a common signal pr~ces~ing section can b0 used. This reduces the circuit ~i:e of the optical disk recording/reproducing apparatus, and realizes a reproduction signal processing circuit with a simpler configuration and higher reliability.<br><br>
(Example 2)<br>
Figure~ 4A to.4H show data formats of an optical disk of Example 2 according to the present invention. Th~ basic configur~t±on oi che optical disk of this e~ample is the same ~s that of the optical disk 1 of<br><br>
same cornpopents as those of the optical d*sk J~. are denoted by the same refetence numerals, and the description thereof is omitted here. In this exampie, ~ in Example ~., one track corresponding to one rotation of the optical disk is divided into a plurality of sectors. Each sector starts with a header region including sCotor identification data representing address information of the sector. In thie example, the data format in the read-only area will mainly be described.<br><br>
figure 4k is an exemplified data format of each s~ctor 2.0 in the rgwritable area 5, and Figure 4C shows ~ ~h~v~ioal do 4.~u~at4.on o~ the inforin~tion track correspon~ir~g '~o t1x~ a~cto~ 10 of Figure 4k. As shown in ~ 4~, th~ ~roova guide track 6 constitutes the ~oove t~eck 7 and s land between adjacent grooves coz~gtit~.1tee th~ land jrsok 8. $uoh groove tracks 7 and li~n4 tracks 8 alternately appear in the rewritable area 5 of the optical disk 1. The user can record desired information (User data) on both the groove track 7 and the lend treck 8 by tracking the groove track 7 and the land track B separately.<br><br>
~n this example, as Shown in Pigure 45, the groove ttsck 7 and the land track 8 ae described collectively ~ an information trsck 6'. The sector 3.0 in the tewr4.t*ble aro~ ~ includes the first header region 11. at th~ head th~teof, '~'he first header region 13. Lu divided into the former half ha (sector identification dat~i PIDi) and tile latter half 2.2.b (sector identification data PI~2)9 As uhow~ i~ Figure dC, the physical pit rowS 22.. and ~1b are ~or~ied in corrempondence with the ~o~xfler half 1~ sr~ the 4.att.r he~.f hib, respectively.<br><br><br><br>
AS shown in Figure 4C, tile width of each pit of thp pit rowp Zta art~ $1t~ in th! radial direction of the optical d4si.e 1 ii ~ubStantially equal to the width of the ~uid~ groove 6 (groove track 7). The pit rows 21a and Vt ar~ 4ispleoed outward or inward (i.e.. in the oppoaite di~ect4pn0) from the Center line of the guide groove 6, i.e., wobbled, by about a ~.zarter of the pitch at' the gu±4t groove 6 (groove pitch Tp). In this examp~e, the pit r0w 21. 4s displaced inward, while the pit row ~24~ ±~ displaced outward.<br><br>
Thus, by displacing the pit rows 21. and 21b from the center line of the guide groove 6 (the groove track '7), the first hea4er region 12. is commonly used to track either of the groove track 7 and the land track 8. Separate exclusive header regions for the groove track 7 and the land track B are not required.<br><br>
Referring to Figure 4k, the mirror region 12 (Id) follows the first header region 12.. The mirror region 12 is flat with no groove oz pit formed thereon and used to dpterm±ne en otfset of the servo tracking.<br><br>

The information reg±on 20 which stores information and data includes a first guard data region 23 (ODI), the first dummy data region 2.5 (VFO), the first<br><br><br>
date regioti 17 (DATA), and a eccond guard data region 18<br>
('3D2). The buffer region 19 (BUF) is formid between the i.nf0rrnation region 20 and the first header region 11' of the nect sector 10'.<br><br>
The first guard data region 23 i. formed to<br>
e:neura the stability of the reproduction signal processing circuit. The first dummy data region 15 is a VFO region where a specific pattern (a specific bit length) of the n'iodulation code usec5 for modulation of data is 4~W,nt±allY reoord*d to promptly and stably clock the ~'LZi ~if th* reproduction s4.gn~1 processing oircuit.<br>
uSat' ~ ±ncludir~g ~n error correction code is ~i~cor4~d oti the fl.rpt d~t~ region 17. The second guard data region 18 ~s for~nad fqllQwing the first data re~Lon 17 to ensur, the pteb$I.±ty of the production signal pro~susing c~rcu±t. The bu~qr region 19 which includes no 4ata is formed to #vod.4 the and of the information region 2Q from overlapping the header regl.on 11' of the next sector ~.Q' when a Jitter oQcur~ du• to the rotation of the optical disk 1. like the gap region 13.<br><br>
~nformat±on is recorded on the information t'E~giQfl 2Q ~r ir~adiatir~g the reoording layer formed on t~ di~k 5u~~tr4to cC the optical disk 1 to change the optic~1 Vpert$05 (re~•ctanoe) of the recording layer. Jror eae~'p~.0, an irzadiated portion of the recording layer niay be changed from a crystalline state to an amorphous state so as to form a r~oording mark with a reflectance di~erent fro~n that of the other portions. As shown in ~i.gurs 4C, the recordinc~ mark array 22a is formed on the g~rpove track 7, whil* t~e rsco~d±ng mark array 22b is form&amp;I on the- J arid track 8<br><br>
Thus, in the rewritablg area 5, the groove track 7 and the 1-and track 8 are formed in accordance with the above-~escribed dat* fo~,nat to record data in th. area,<br><br>
fe~'r~.r~g to Figures 4~ •nd 4P, a data format in<br>
~ ~esd-on2.y areas ~ and S will be described. In this p~%Sm~le, as in ~camp1e 1, the data format in the read~ly areas i~ matchpd with the dete format in the r~,writ~b~ area. Fipt~r~ 4~ shows an exemplified data ~orm~t of eE~ch sector SQ in the read-only areas 2 and 3, and F~igure 4D sohematic4ly sh~wu a physical configuretion of the track compon~d of the pit row 2g correspondirig to th~ •ecto~z 30 oI?

~	and ~ a::a formed in accordance with a uniform p~ysic~l format. Moz!e specifically, the width (pit width) Qf the pit row 39 in the radipl direction of the optical disk 1 is small~r than the width (groove width) of the guide groove 6 (groove track 7) formed iz~ the ri~writab1-e area 5, and all the pits are lined substantially along the center line of the track for servo tracking.<br><br>
~eferring to Figure 43, the sector 30 in the reacl-only armas 2 and 3 includes the second header ~gton ~1- (pe~tor Identification data PIDi and PID2) and th~ 0~cQM 4~ta ~region ~'7 (1~At~A). A second dummy data r~±Ofl ~$ (p$y~) is fo~m.d between the second header he eecpnd data region 37. A third dummy<br><br>
data ~sgion 34 (DMY2) is formed between the second data region 37 and the second header region 31' of the next ssctor SO'.<br><br>
The sector identification data PIDi and PZD2 of the secon" h~?~ader region 31 are repeatedly recorded on the former half and the latter half of the second header region ~1, respectively, in compliance with the sector id*nt±4catJ1.on data PIDi and PID2 of the £irst header ~gion 1±, so that ~hs 1-qngth ~f the second header ri~1.oti 32. becomes sukatantially the same as that of the ~rst header region 11. In t)~e second header region 31, however, the pit row is not wobbled as the pit rows 21a Srid 21b of the ~irst header region 11, but is lined sub~tantially along the center line of the track 9 for servo tracking.<br><br>
The 4.nforniation amount recorded on the second data region 37 of one sector 30 is made equal to that of the first data region 2.7 of one sector 10 in the rewritable area 5, and the same format as that in the rewritable ~-ea ~ is ,.ised for an addit±on~l error correct~.on code and the like, With this arrangement the length ~f the ~eoopd d~ta region 37 is substantially the same as that of the ~rst data region 17.<br><br>
Z~ general, data recording in the read-only area ip perfor~ne4 by embossing with high precision at the te4,ricetion ot the dis~c. Zn the read-only area, data is only repro4uca4 ~nd no nrrangCfl~ent to respond to rewritirig by the user is required. Th~rsfore, regions such as the gap region l~, the fi.r~t guard data region 23, the peicond gu~rd data region lB. and the buffer region 2.9<br><br>
formed in the rewr4,t~ble atee are not required. These r~gion8 sh~uld be d.l~ted if the recordAng capacity of t~e pp'~ica1 ~isk is considered with priority. However, if these ~egionu are deleted, the data format in the ~'aad-on1y area becomes different from that in the  This r0quires to p~~ovide two separate 4.~4u~ive •4.~r~al proo~p~1.ng •~ct±c)ns each including a t~.ming gsn4r4.~Pr ar~d a deni~1ulatoZ' for the read-only area or the rew~itab2.e area, and switch the two processing !e0tiOfl~ SpPrOr~at!~.y, as in the conventional apparatus, and the buffer region 19 in the r;awr4t~Lble 5Z'5, 5 ~re formed in the read-only area so au to ~ync~rp~±~ the r~production timing and no pit row is ttn~4 4.n ~he~e r~gio~3, the tracking error signal is<br>
d{scontinued at these regions, making the servo tracking in the r~ad'-only area unstab).e.<br><br>
In order t~ overcome the above problems, in this example, the second dummy data region 33 is formed b~tween the header region 31 and the second data region 37 of each sector 30, and the third dummy data regi~n 34 is formed between the second data region 37 and th~ second header region 31' of the next sector 30'.<br><br>
A bpecifiv pattern of the modulation code used ~ ~1ohi1.StiOfl of dat~ (a pattern of a specific bit ~ngth co±r*~POfldir~g to a specific pulse width and pulse i~erv~l) p~ ~ the 4z'~t dumm~' data region 15 (VFO) in tt~e rewrit~ble ar~a 5~ for example, can be sequentially z~e~orded on the second ~nd third dummy data regions 33 and 34. Using suvh a apecific pattern, prompt and stable<br><br>
clocking of the PLL of th~ reproduction signal proce~jsing circuit can be realized.<br><br>
A mirror region, may be formed between the second header region 32. and the second dummy data region 33 as in the rewritable area.<br><br>
When ~ r~cord~4 on th~ optical disk of this 5215!1$C i~ to be ~e~roduo~, the Same procedure as that de.r1A~e~ in kxamp2.e ~ w4.th the optio~l disk record±n~/zeproductr~ apParatt~s iQO s~iown in Figure 3 can be er~1-oyec~. In this ease, the waveforms of the envelope detection signal, the diffqrenoe signal obtained from the rewr±tab1-e ares, the suni signal obtained from the rewritable area, and th~ sum signal obtained from the reed-only area are as sh~WV~ in ?igures 4~ to 411, respectively.<br><br>
Thus, in thi..S e fl~ple, the sector lengths and main port±~n~ of the 4ata formats of the rewritable area ~nd the re~d-QT4y ar~as are made substantially equal to each other. With this arrp*,gsment, the sectors in the read-on~.y areas and the rewrita~1-e area can be managed in the ssme me~per, aM the processing ~uch as sector re'~riaval c~r~ be unified. Thus, one reproduction signal p±o~ising circuit t~an ha commonly used for the ~e~4jsble a~•~ a~d t~e ro*d-only areas. This reduces the o~.rcui~ size.<br><br>
In th~p enAmplqa. the first data region 17 in the rewrit*ble ares and the second data region 37 in the ~?4.ad-c~ly area are ~rran~jed to start ~t the same timing ap shown in Figures 4k and 49. The unified sector<br><br>

In gsnerql, the tr~oking control along a track of ~ optic~. 4iqk 0sh be %~erformed by a variety of methods. For e~psplp, p phase difference detection method is Rfl'plO?04 as an effpctive tracking method for the track qcr~pipt4.ng ot the pit row 29 shown in F'igure 4D, for extmple,<br><br>
As de;cribed in Enample 2, each of the second and third dunupy data reg$ons 33 and 34 shown in Figure 43 includes a specific repetition pattern of modulation codes used for mo4ulatiori of data (a pattern of a specifiv bit ler~qth corresponding to a specif to pulse width and pulse interval). When puph a specific repetition pattern i.e formed on adJao*nt trao)%s, however, the servo tracking by the $4WSA difference deteQtion method becomes unstable.<br><br>
The repSon why tile servo tracking becomes unstable will be described $n d9tpil as follow..<br><br>
The principl0 for obtaining a tracking error<br><br><br><br>
signal by the phase difference detection method will be first described with reference to Figure 5. A beam Spot 57 tracks the pit row 29 constituting the track 9. Light ~f the beam spot 57 is ref lected by the pit row 29 end the ~-efl~otsd light is detected by a 4-part optical d0tec~ot 58. ~he 4-~att opticaJ. detector 58 oonverts the reo~4.v~4 light into ~rz electric signal.

A pha~s cQmpar~tor 81 oompares the phases of the two sum signals ~11 and 812 to generate a tracking error signal S1~.<br><br>
When the beam spot 57 is displaced outward from the center line of the track 9, the reflected light is diffr~ote4 at the edge of the pit row 29, and thus the ph~ps of the sum signal 511 of the parts A and C prooeed~. O~ ~e co~t~a~y, wh~ the beaii spot 57 is displ~~d ±~W~rd from the centor line of the track 9, the phese of the sum signal 512 of the parts B and D procje~ds. ~he phase 4±fferenoe between the sum signals 811<br>

As shown in F±g~4re 6, a path 64 of tt~~ beep spot 57 is~ dim%leo~d from the target track 9a.<br><br>
Xr~ the above case, li~t of the beam spot 57 is 44.f~radt~d towed the ports A and U by the outward edge<br>

As &amp; result, as shown in Fipu±-e 6, no phase difference exists between the sum signal 811 of the parts A + C and the sum signal 812 of the ports U + D. Thus, the output of the tracking error signal 813 is zero though the beam spot 57 is actually displaced from the target track 9a.<br><br>
Ain described above, when the tracks 9a and 9b ad~aoent to each other have pit rows with completely the ~a~a pattern, the tra~king error signal 813 is not ~u~er~tp4 even wh~~ the b~em spot deviates from the<br>

Data sequence suitable for servo tracking can be also used for the third dummy data region 34 in a manner s.Lnvilar to that describad above for the second dummy data region 33.

In ~xample 3 above, the pattern of data (code.) rocorded en the dummy datg regions can be directly generated at the data reproduction. In this example, a modulation code is used to reduce the correlation between dummy data recorded on adjacent tracks.<br><br>

Ba~ed on this value, data can be ea~ily gener~ted, Scrambling is realized by Zirst generating random d4ta such as an M series from a certa4.n initial value and calculating exclusive-OR between this randOm data and data to be recorded. The method of generating scr~mbled data idll be described in ~etail in a later example.<br><br>
Zn the case wheze the same data to be recorded<br>
~r4 tile same initial values are used, data obtained after t~ Bcramblin~ ar~ ~he SSme, I~owever, if the initial vat~0 are di~~r~nt  the data to be recorded are thp same, t1~e oo~we1ation between two data obtained after the scrambling can be re~uced. Uowever, using different 4itial Values for all the sectors is difficult since a cQr~m±dsrab1y J.~rge number o~ initial ~ra1-ues are ree~uired. 1Z~ p~0tiq0, ~ow~ver, uui~ d4-fferent initial values f~r adjaoent a~otors is enau~ to reduce the correlation between the ~u~nmy ~ i~eg±on5 of the adjacent tracks. 'rMt is, the s~e in4.t~.a1- values can be used for sectors Q~ ~ aeme t~-aoJ, X~ the osee whs~'e the number of ~aotc~s ir~c1u~e4 in cn~ trao)~ varies, the number of con V~uc,us s~tors hav4.n~ the same initial value should<br>

The actual values of M ahd N can be co1ver~iently deterirtined based on sector address information included in the sector identification data.<br><br><br><br>
For e~mple, if $.s~~yte data is ~jsed as the sector addx.ss in~ormation, a~ou* 18,770,000 sectors can be opver~. I~ the values of M and N are powers of 2, s~r~ii~Xqd 4at, ~n ~s a~~i1-y ger~ereted. Zn this example, the case of N~ w 16 and N m ~ will be described. N in4t4al va1-'i4es oan be obtained in the following manner, ~oz e~e. F$rSt, th~ ad~zeins information included in th~ per4d~ tieio,tiora data is represented in the ~ no~t±on, and 4-bit data corresponding to the fifth t0 eighth bits from th~ learnt significant bit are u~ed. U~±ng this 4-b4t data, N • 16 initial values can be obtained. Th~ initial value is renewed every M • 16 sectors, and one track i~icludes 256 sectors at maximum.<br><br>
Since 16 contin4ous sectors have the same initial value, it iS ensured that the initial values for scrambling are different between adjacent sectors for tracks ~aoh having 1-6 to 256 sectors. Pata to be recorded is scrambled using one of these initial values, modulated with reoordinp code, ar~d recorded on the dummy data rU~g4 on.<br><br>
Zn this war, by scr4mbl±~g the same data using differeht initial val~s b4twe~n aor~eP~onding sectors of &amp;djacent tr~oks, different data series can be recorded on the dummy dp~a regions of the corresponding sectors of ad:jacent tracks.<br><br>
Thus, in this example, since random data series can be effectively obtained for the dummy data regions of adjacent tracks, the servo tracking by the phase error detection method can be relatively stably controlled in the read-only area.<br><br>
(~xen1plG 5)<br>
In this exarnp~.e, data Series ±r~ the rewritable atep or the reed-only ereas for realizing effective s~ictor management will be described.<br><br>
Au described with reference to Figures 4K and 43, for example, data to be recorded on the optical disk is divided into parts for a predetermined data capacity corresponding to the data region 17 (the rewritable area) or 37 (the reae~-only areb) of each sector. An error correction code is added to the data for each sector. Puoh ar~ error o~rreet±on code may be complete within each 0~ictOZ~. ~lternat4-vely, error correction coding may be<br>
rf~Z~ned for a set of a plurality of sectors. Such a ~Xito$~ of ~ ~l~rs~41~yof sectors i~ referred to as an ECC b1QC~, which is a unit for error oorre~tion coding. When one ~Cd ~ iw rnpo~4 of k sectors (e.g., k • 16), an errox~ hpvin~ A length of about ~ne epotor can be corrected. Using such an error correction code, the number of psotor~ ii~ the rewrit~~.e area end that in the read-only ar*a are ~ult4-p~ss of th~ number of Sectors in one 2CC blor.*, i.e., multiples ~f k.<br><br>
Zn order to effectively manage sectors of an o~icel di~k, tne sectors in the rewritable area and the r~Rd~-OnXy ~zea ar~ preferably managed with track basis.<br>
H3wever, th~ number of sectors included in one track is not neo$ssan$ly a multi-plc of the number of sectors included in one ECC block. Accordingly, when data is recorded on a plurality of ECC blocks of sectors, the data i~ not necessarily completed appropriately at the er~d of one track, but often ends midway of one track. In the rewritable area, the tracking control is possible<br><br>
•v~n i~ 4zhe~e are re~eir~ed sectors with no data recorded thpreon be~a4sb t~e groove or land track has been formed as a guide tr*ck. Zn the read-only area, however, the p~.t row is discqntir&amp;t~ed by the sector with no data recorded th~rson, and thus the tracking control becomes unstable.<br><br>
In order to overcome the above problem, in this example, dummy data is recorded on sectors left unrecorded after completion of recording data to fill the entire track with data so as to realize sector management with track basis, An example of such dummy data is a specific repetitiQn pattern of a modulation code (a specific pulse width and p4lse interval) as in the VTO region 15 in the r~w~i.tabl0 area. tiui~g such a pattern as the dummy data,<br>

Figure 9 shows an optical disk 1? of this e~amp4e. As shown in Figure 9, dummy data is recorded on sectors 71 in the read-only area 3 at the junction with the rewrit.ble area 5. Likewise, dummy data is recorded on sectori 72 in the read-Qnly area 2 at the junction with the rewritabl, area 5.<br><br>
Thu., in this e~cample, when data is recorded by<br>
•very p~edet~rt~ined recording unit ~uch as the error corxection b.~ock (~CC), a sector left with no data recorded thereon i~ fi-lied with dummy data. With this<br><br>
arrangement, the rewritabls aZ~ea and the read-only areas always start at the ilead of a track. This ensures effective management of sectors on thp optical disk.<br><br>
(Example 6)<br>
In Example 6, specific eacamples of data formats of the sector 10 in the rewritable area and the sector 30 i~i the read-only areas will be described.<br><br>

The information data portion (2048B) i. then scrambled in the manner as described below which is the same as that used tor the dummy data region in Example 4.<br><br><br>
First, a shift register is constructed so that s5.o4led N-series data can be generated, and an initial<br>
v~.ue is 4et~rmin~d. ~~bis initial value is sequentially ahiftsc~ through the s~itt regist0: tn synchronizatd.on with t~ ± orxnat4~~i~ data so as to generate pseudorandom dets~ Exclus4.ve-O1~ is opsrat~4 between the pseudorandom di~ta and the information datp to be recorded bit by bit thareby to realize scrambling.<br><br>
Since the ~.nformnati~n data is 20488 which is the eleventh power of 2, a prirn~.tive polynominal expression with the eleventh or higher power of 2 is required as the M s~r±s5. The next higher degree in trinominal to qnquenomi~a). expresu±o~is having a term of the eleventh or hiUh0r power o~ ~ ~niong t~e p~itnitive polynominal<br>

Figure 12 shows the FI*ali~atiOn of thi; pr~p~itive polyn9m±nal expression by u~e o~ a shift register 150.<br><br>
As shown in Fi~:e 12, the length of the shift register 1.50 is 15 bi~~ (entries :14 to rO). The shift resister 150 calculates exclusive-OR between the bit in the entry r14 and the bit in the entry r1.0 and feeds back the reS4lt to the entry rO. A predetermined 15-bit initial value is set f~r the shift register 150 and is s~uent±ally ~tiifted in response to a bit clock, so as to gqherats p0sudorandof4 data. Then, exclusive-OR is eE.oulated betWean the eight least significant bits (entries :7 to rQ) of th~ shift register 150 and eight b4.ts (1~) of th~ ±nfo~ma~ion data every eight clocks, and th~0 op *tiOn ie repeAted 2048 times. As a result, inf0X~flat±~n dat~ f~r one Osotor is scrambled. The shift<br><br>
register 150 is reset every sector to reset the initial value, so that the information data of each sector is independently scrambled with n~ substantial correlation with one another.<br><br>
Ase'sme that the nu$ber of continuous sectors having the sem* i~itiat value is H and the number of initial v4jaes is N. The valu~p of lvi and N can be obtaihed from ths sector addres* information included in thp ±dent1.~4czetion date. U the values of N and N are ~c'wsr~ of a. sor4tflblsd data can be easily generated. In this euarnp$, the case of H • 10 and N - 16 will be dpscribeq. N initial values c~n be obtained in the fol1c~y4,n~ menotr, tar example.

value and the initial value ±s previously determined in the form of a table and the like. The initial value is renewed every N - 16 sectors, and one track includes 256 aecto;s at maximum.<br><br>
The scrarnb24d first data unit! of 16 sectors are put together to constitute error correction codes by Reed-Solomon coding. The data unit of one sector is arranged in an array ot 172B x 12 rows and such units of 18 sectorp •;e put together to form an array of l72~ x<br>
292 rows. A 18~ external code is added to each column of tt4e atrey, and a 10! .tnt~rnal code is added to each row of thit array. A data block of 1825 x 208 rows (378588)<br><br>

i~ thus formed, which is referred to as an ECC block.<br><br>
Then, the ~QC block is intarle5vmd so that the 165 external code is incl~dsd in each sector. The data of !ach sector is then 1823 x 13 rowa - 23663.<br><br>
The data is then modulated with a recording code.<br>

In the first dt±mmy 4ate region 15', the VFO region 15 preoeding the PS region 44 has a specific ppttbrn for promptly and stably clocking the PLL of the reproduction signa3. pr~oes;ing circuit. For prompt and stable clocking of the PLL, it is better that the cods includes mor~ inversions (i.e., more "l~s" as represented in the NRZI code). For high-density recording, however, when the shortest bit length of a modulation code ±3 repeate4, both the applitude of the reproduction signal and the C/N are reduced, making it 4±fficult to obtain si;p4~ oleokiflg. Thetefore, the repetition of a pattern<br>

From the reb4lt~ of experiments by the inventors of the present invention, it has been found preferable that the lengths o~ the first and second guard data regions 23 and 19 are (1~+k)B end (4~-k)B, respectively, and the shift amount is k 0 to 75. The total of th* lengths of the two guard data regions is fixed to 609.

The PIDi a1'4 PI~2 constituting tl~~ 843 fozmer half is displaced outward, while the PIE~3 and PID4 constituting the 64B latter half is displaced inward, for example.<br><br>
In each sector identification data PID, 43 is allocated for a Pid region representing the sector address ±nformptlon, 33 for the sector number, and 13 for var±ous types of information of the sector such as the number of the Pid region. The addres~ information of the sector on the groove trac)c 7, from which the header region is diaplac~d With ~espact t~ the ce:~ter line, is rsoo~d~d on a ~id3 reqio~ 213 in the PZD3 and a Pid4<br><br>

This pattern includes two 1,4-channel-bit patterns longer than the longest bi~ length, i.e., 11,-channel-bit length, of the mo~iu1ation code. Therefore, the possibility of erroneouS detection of the address mark at the reproduction of normal data reduces.<br><br>
A V~O r5g±on is provided at the heed of each sector identification data PIP. The VFO region has data<br>

As described above, the former half PIDi and PID2 and ~he latter half PID3 and ~ID4 of the header region 80 are displaced toward the opposite directions from the canter line of the groove track. The first VFO regions ~01 and 22.2. wl~ich are the hepds of the former and the latter hel.ves of the header regiQn 80 need to give more than one chance for bit synchronization to ensure the bit synchronizatiQn. Accordingly, the first VFO re~ione 202. and 211 are made longer than the second VFO regions 206 and 2~.6 which are uSed only for re-synchro~iaation and therefore c~n ~e short. In this example, the 2.en~ths of the ~ V~0 ~eqions 201 and 224. are 363, wh$le the ~er~gth~ of t~ie second V~'0 regions 206 and 216 ~ ~.<br><br>
Thus, the P101, for example, includes the VFO region 201 (vFol), the AM reg~on ~02, the ~id region 203, the IEfl region 204, and th~ pQstamble region 205 in this order, and has a len~tb of 46B. Likewise, the P1D2 includes the VFO region 2P~ (VFO2), the AM region 207, the Pid regior~ 208, the I~D region 209, and the postamble region 2~.O 4-n this order, and has a Xen~th of 189. The P103 ~nd th~ PID4 of the latter half have the similar ooz-1figuration~ to the above.<br><br>
The heed~r zsgi-pn 90 in the r.~d-only areas will b~ d~sqribed with refersnc* to Figures ilk and 113. As described in ~ample 2 with reference to Figures 4K and 4M, the d~t~ prrAngement Qf the headpr region 31 in the reid-only aree~ is matched with the data arrangement of<br><br>
the header region 11 in the rewritable area, but the pit row on the header region 31 is lined along the center line of the tracl 9. The header region 90 in this example i~ fc.~rnied in the manner described in Example 2. That is, the data sequence and the length (bit length) of the header region 90 in the read-only areas are made equal to those of the header region 80 in the rewritable ~rea (Figure 10K). More specifically, as shown in F$g~rSs I.1~ ~M ±2.R, *h~ header region 90 with a length of 4.p c~npope4 of fo~ sector identification data ~ (?~i to PZfl4). The PIDi, fo~ example, includes a ~ir~t VP'O r~iot~ ~32. (VFOX), an AM region 232, a Pid region ~ an ~fl regio~i *34, and A postamble region 235 4n this order, •nd .has • length of 46B. Likewise, the P~D2 inc2.i~des a eecond VP~Q region 236 (VFO2), an AM region ~7, a Pid region Z38, an tED region 239, and a postarnble region 240 in this order, and has a length of<br>
183. The PI~3 and the PID4 Of the latter half have the s~.rnilar configurations to the above.<br><br>
Thus, in this example, different data series can ~s fo~-mec~ on the dummy data regions 33 or 34 on adjacent tz~k* in the read-only areas. This oem be realized by ~oran1bli~ pred~t*rniine4 fixed data (e.g., FF) in the aaz1~e manner a~ tha'~ fbr data recorded on the second data ~eg4.on 37, using 4i~erent initial values between adjacent se~o~s. The re~u1tant ,cran~b1ed data is then modulatSd with the reoord4ng cods used for the date on th~ ~acor4 data r.g*on 47 and recorded on the pad regioi'~ ~ or ~. in 1hi5 ~ the servo tracking by the ph~~ err~v 4et.otic~n ~*~ho~ can be relatively stably oontz-oJ4ed 4.n ~hC read-o4y arees, A scrambling circuit and • reoo~4tng codiig ci~eu4.t used for generating data<br><br>

In ~iample 6~ exemplified data series on the seotot~S ~.O and 30 in the rewritab1,e area and the readon~' areas were described. As shown in Figures 10K and ~ the pre~yrW region 44 is formed 'following the VFO region ~ and preceding the first data region 2.7 in the<br>
-	reWrit*~le area, while the presync region 46 is formed following the VFO region B4 and preceding the 5econd data region 37 in the read-only areas.<br><br>
In the conventional optical 'disk as shown in Figure ~3, for example, the data region 450 immediately follQWR the VFO region 403. The data region 450 is composed of a plurality of data blocks 405a, 405b, w~4h tM date •ynchroriQus 5e2~ieS 404a, 404b, ... precedi~ t~ cort'ss~o~~dirig data blool4ii.<br><br>
In such a co~v,htLOnPl 4~ta format, at the reproductiOn, at ~O± stAbl~ clocking of the PLL circuit by th% ~VF0 r0g4-ofl 403, the data synchronous series 404a is<br><br>
detected. By the detection of the data synchronous series 404a, the head of the data region 450 is identifled to repi'oducs the first data block 405a.<br><br>
The above conventional configuration has a drawbeck as follows. If the recording layer of the optical disk is dam~ed at tM portion of the first data ;yr~ohtonous eerie! 4O4~ which Specifies the start timing for the fir*t ~Sta klock 4055, for example, an error &amp;zi-e~s in the ~ynchrono~s data to be read, failing to<br>
~r4~ the start position of the firSt data block 405a.<br><br>
Moreover, when the start position of the first data block 405a is failed to be specified, not only the start pps±tion of the firpt data block 405a but also the block number of the subsequent data b~.oo1c 405b cannot be specified. Errors therefore arise over the entire data region 450 of the sector, and reading of tbr data becomes impossible.<br><br>
flowever, according to the data format in Example 6 deecri~ed ~bpve, which has the presync region fQ1,i.owin~ the VFO region, the start timing of the first data ~Xock can be detected with high reliability even if an error 4r4.ses it~ ~he first data synchronous series of the 4~ta region.<br><br>

~erxing to Ti~Ur~ 14K, the sector 10 includes the h*ade~ region 80 (Sector 4.den~ification data PID), the ~iirr~ ~-~g4-on l~ (M), t~e gap region 13 (GAP), the firSt guard 4~te region 23 (GOl), the VFO region 15, the pre~yno ~-egio~ 44 (PpY), the fizst data region 17 (DATA), the pp~1ambte rCgion 45 (PA), the •econd guard data region 18 (0~2), •nd the buffez regio~i 19 (StYF).

Th~ mirror regi~n 12 is a flat portion with no pit o~ groove formed thereon and used to obtain an offset of the tracking. The first and second guard data regions 23 and ~.B have predetermined data patterns for compensating a oy~le de~radation due to heat load. The first guard data region 23 is located at the head of the recor4ing data while the second guard data region 18 is 1ocate~ at the end of the recording data. The gap region<br>
13 absorbs signal disturbance at the start and end of datp recording and sets ths recording laser power. The V~'C~ reg±~n 2.S includes a third data synchronous series<br>
a ~ra~e~t4~d cod~ of a single period is sequent*~i.Zy ~s~ox~d~d. ~ P~0UYflC region 44 includes a second ~at* s1rn~hror1ous seri~ for ~pecifying a start position o~ data reproduction, which w41 be descr [bed in this example in detail. Th~ pogtam~le region 45 terminates a modulation code and allows the reproduction signal<br><br>

Referring to ~igure 143, in the read-only areas, the sector 30 include, the pad region 82 (DMY) and the postambla ragion 83 (PA), in place of the gap region 1~ end ~he ti~st gl4ard data region 23 in the rewritable Ar~a, a~d ~ p~d r~g4.o~ PS (DMY) and the postamble<br>

The second dat~ synchronous series recorded on the presyno region 44 o~ the sector 10 in the rewritable area and the presyno region 46 of the sector 30 in the rsad-only areas will be described in detail. Hereinbelow, t~a presyno region 44 of the sector 10 will be described as an example. It should be understood that the sen~e is also wp~4ceble to the presyno region 46 of the spot0r ~o.<br><br>
As described above, the data format of this 0xar~ple inQludes the uAo~nd data synchronous series (the prs~no region 44 or 46) between t~~ first data synchrono~ ~er4.~s 4~ as the head of the data region and the th$r4 data ~ynohrono14* se4es (the V~0 region 15 or 84). ~ ,4pt*rrn4.r~d ~~at~e~n whiOh has high autocorrelation and does not a~ear in the othar data portions is used ~ ~ spoond data ~ynch~onQus seri~s So that a specific p4t4.~r~ o~n be dst!cted in the code sequence.<br><br>
At th* signal ~eproduot±on, the third data<br><br>
s~rnchronoua series (the VFO region 15) is first repro~1uoed to ~llow the P~4J oi~-cuit to be clocked stab±1±~ed by detecting the single-period repetition pattern. After the s~f~ioi~tv~ C bilizCtior~ of the clocking, the positio~ of t~a p~ooi~d datC Cynohronous series (the presync<br>

I~ the ~e~e where the data re~ion 17 is divided intO a plurality of data blocks as shown in Figure 14K, a plurality of first data synchronous series 4a, 4b, Corresponding to the respective data blocks are formed on the data regi~n 17. This increases the redundancy, and ther~fo~e, in order to secure a sufficient recording region for user data, each data synchronous series should be ahort. On the contrary, since only one second data synchronous •erie~ (~SY 44) exists in one sector, the second data *ynchrono~s series can be made long.<br><br>
Thus, in thiS ex~mple, the position of the ~tiv*ly Lor~ ~coM q~e*a pynchronous series (PSY 44)<br>
b~ d~teot~d withc~ut *42.. ~o~n the detected position of th~ second date *ynoI~ronoU5 s.z4A. (PSY 44), the read start position o~ the fir5t data synchronous series 4a located at the he*d of the data region 2.7 can be identified. 'This allows the first data synchronous series 4a to.be shortened without reducing stable detection thereef.<br><br>
An exemplified code pattern of the second data syr~chrOnou5 series will be described. Zr~ this example, ai~ the recording code, the 8/16 code is used, which ocnv~~-ts S bits of 4~te into ~-6 channel bits of the<br>
ddng co4~ hewing a bit length of 3 channel bits at 14.nizhuiTl to 11 chAnnel bits at maximuni. The interval of on~ ohsnn~l ~±t iv re~ireSented by T. The data is reprevented in the N~ZZ QQd* where the signal level i. inverted at bit "1" while it i~ not inverted at bit "0". The second date syno~ronouA sezias needs to satisfy the limit of the mark/Space lengthy of the recording code.<br><br>
A~ord~.ngly, thO shortest recording bit length is "100". In cr2~r to ensure stable reproduction, the third data synchronouS series (VFO 15) needs to have a period longer then the shortest recording bit and include much ~dge in*ormstion (level inversion) which ensures the o~1~ir~ of the ~LL. Zn this ex~fl~ple, therefore, a code ~*ri*s ~o~ipo~e4 of repetition of "1000" 4.s used as the tfrLz4 ~*ta synchronous series to be recorded on the VFO rapien l~, T~s mark/space lengths of the VFO region 15 are *h~re*ore 4T.<br><br>
S±noe the Second 4ata syr~chronous series of the p;QYT~O re~ior~ 44 is 4et~oted ~fter the clock synchroni~a~4.o*~ by thC third 4a1~ synchrcnous series of the VFO region 15 aa ~eso4bed above, using the code capable of ,ynoh~oni~4.ng every 4T further •nsures the synchronous ~pro0i.i~tCon. Con~equently, it is effective to use a combinAtion of a 4-channel-bit patters as the second data ~ynchr7c~nC~i~ ~rip~.<br><br>
in tne case where the average of 'the mark/Space<br><br>
langths of the second data synch~onou5 uurss ~-s ciose to th~ period Qf the repetition pat~ern of the third data<br>
nch~or~ous esriep of the V$0 region (hereihafter, such<br>
~ pattern i~ fer~?ec1 t0 0 t1~s VFO pattern), symbols "1" present~d in the N~I cods are boated at similar posit±Q~C bAtwaen th~ ti~0 4ata syn~h~o~ous series. This mnorq~eee the p~o~abi~4ty of z4etakenly detecting the VFO pa~tte~n for the 0eoond data pynchro~ous series. In this example, th~refo~e, t~as inter-code distance between the second data sy~chrono4s series and the VPO pattern is msde l~ge. fl~weVer, *n order to make the average of the m5~J~/spsoe length3 of th~ second data synchronous series gn~lJ,~r than the pe~±o4 4T o~ the VFO pattern, a pattern 3V which is the mh~test recording bit length needs to be included frequently. This reduces the stability at the data reproduction. In prder to overcome this problem, the average of the ~nark/space lengths of the second data synchronous series is made longer than the period 4T of the VEC pattern.<br><br>
The s~cond da~a synchronous series in this example is 4 ~it long, ~nd domposed of a combination of p~4r~lity o~ Oode ~b01S including a code symbol having a single level inversion, i.e., "0001", '~O010", "0100", end ~'1C00'~ ~nd p dodA p~bol h~ving no level inversion, i~4, "0000".<br><br>
A turt~er specific example of the code series constituting the second data synchronous series will be described. In this ex~~iple, the above-described 8/16 oonver~icn code is used. As will bC described later, since a 2-byte code is u~*d as the first data synchronous ~e~ies, three bytes are used for the second data synchro<br><br>
nous sezies. When converted with the B/16 conversion code, t~ s~cond data Cynohronous eerie, has a length of 4~ ~it long as the ~eoordin~ channel bits. That is, in t.4~rh~s of the •~ove comb4n~tiQn of 4.~it long code s~'m~,01S, it hat a J~eng'th o~ 12 symbols. Hereinbelow, four ~peci±ic examples of t~A code ~eries will be described.<br><br>

Pstt~rn 4 is also composed of the same five types ot ~ymbo1s as P*ttern 2. This unique' pattern was first discovered by the Inventors ~f the present invention, and' exhikits resistance to errors and excellent detection<br><br><br><br>

Figure 15 showi the cotnpariuon of the character4-sties o~ the above p~tternu I to 4 with respect to the avera~ ~f thA rn~r1~/~~oe ler~gthu, the maximum and JllThiml4zn of the maz'k/epaoe lengths, the number of symbols oon$titUtIn~ the pettern, and the absolute value of the 4ig±tal stimming value (~SV).<br><br>

The averages at ~ i~ark/apaoe lengths of pattern 1 to 4 a~e prefez~abt~ dif~erCnt from the repetition ~4p4 4'~ of the th4-rd data synchronous series as de~oribed ~boVe. AC is observed from Figure 15, the ~vera~ ~f th* mazk/space lengths of pattern 1 is 3.7T which i~ relatively close to 4?. ThiB is because all of ths three types of symbols constituting the code series of pattern 1 include "1" among the four bits. Since pattern I does not include the symbol "0000", it is d4fi-cult to obtain the average of the mark/space lengths la:rger than 4T.<br><br>
On the contrary, since the code series of patterh~ 2 to 4 •re ob~t~possd Qf fivs types of symbols J4wlv44.'n~ the eymbo2. "0000", the average of the ~/apads lengths can be made longer than 4T,<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Th* digital summing value (DHV) can be used as an in4ibpto± representing th~ cMtaoteriutics of the recording codA. The DSV is obta~.ned ~y converting "1" and "0" as represented ir~ the ?jRZI code into "1" and "-1", respectively, and summing all the bits of the code. When the DSV is zero, the DC ~ompopent included in the recording code is zpro, aM thus the ~C component in the reproduction sigr~al 4oaB not vary. This makes it possible to stably convert the reproduction signal into a binary yalue. As is observed from Figure 15, the DSV is 0 for pattern 4.<br><br>

As long as no error arises in the reproduction signal, all of the 12 symbols should match with the signal value of the first shift register 91 when the second data synchronous ~4i~4.~5 i~ *~ctly detected by shifting each bit of the f~-t~ Ch4t ~~ister 92. on~ by one. The synchronous d*o~s4s~ p A ior~ ~n~~~ting ci~cuit 95 outputs a gate 54.gnAl in~i~ting the ti~ie period during which the second<br>

s~nies during this detecjion time period, the detection<br>
signal for the second data synchronous series is output from the AND c~.rou±t 96 to a system control circuit (not shown).<br><br>
In this example, the pattern match was performed every 4-bit symbol. The pattern mAtch may also be performed for another number of bits, e.g., every bit.<br><br>

Ref~rrin~ to Figure 17, the VFO region 15 has at ±eagt 64 bits of ~ re t±~c~ pattern of "1000" as the third data synchronous series. The first data synchronous series 4a of the data region 17 following the second d~te ~ynch~-onous series of -the PSY region 44 has a 32-bit pattern 4-1 of "OOO1001QQ1,000l00 OOOOOOOOOOOOOloool" or<br>
a	3~-b~	pat~ern	4a-2	of	"OOOlOOtOOOOOoloo<br>

~	ah~. ~ in Figure 2.7, the detection of the we~ond data Cvnchronous senS, is pereormned using a 48 ~,it q±de '.ete~ticn windo~' ~7. A reference position is de~*n*4 as th* ~os4.tion Where the match of all of the 12 ~ ~ould ~e obt~ined es long ap no error arises. At th# 4*tection, the detection win4ow 97 i. shifted within th~ r4nge ~f -64 bits leftward to +48 bits ri~ht.~ard from the reference position. Every four bits of the input signal are compared "~~th each symbol of the se'~ond data synchronous series as described above, to obtain the number of p~ttern matches. The results are sh3wn in Figu~es 19K and 19E, which are graphs generally referred to as autocorrelation function diagrams. The<br><br><br>
thrpsho$ of th~ number of the pattern matches is preset at B, and th~ position where eight symbols cr more have mnt~t0h*d iu 4qt*r~iioe4 as a 4etection position for the<br>
•SOOi$ d*t&amp; •yhchronotis asriem.<br><br>
Zn order to consider the influence of the first da~u Synchronous series 4a and the data block St at the praqtic4 detection of the second data synchronous series, the results shown in Figures 19K and lOb have 1~een determined in the following manner. One of the patterns 4a-l and 4a-2 of the first data synchronous series is selected so that the selected erie gives the larger number of pattern matches at each time (i.e., the one which nine adversely influences the detection of the q*oOhd data synchronous ~r±es is selected). When the 4,*eotion window 91 *hifts rightw~r4 from the reference p0SittQp ~y about 40 btte or more, the data block 5. #o~.low4vag the t$rat d~ta bypchronous series 4a is includ.4 i~ the rtng* at the detection window 97 as shown in flgure 4 Zn thiS cap~, the pattern of the data biocic St (first 16 bits) greatly influences the detection of the second data *yn0hrcncus series. To prepare for the worst case, a p4ttern of the data block 5a (16 bits) where th! number of pett*rn matches is largest is used in this flample.<br><br>
As a result, ~s will, be observed from Figures lOX and 19~, when the dpteotion window 97 is shifted leftward ft~)il the ref qtaace pqu±tiori (i.e. the position of bit shift 0), the ma~*mwn ~unWer of pattern matches is 5 for pstt.rr~ 1, while ±t is 4 for pattern 4. Also, when the det~ction window 97 is shifted rightward from the referqnc~ position within thS range of 40 bits from the<br><br>
reference pc~ition, t~ie m~ximum number of pattern matches is 6 for pattern 1., while it i~ 4 for pattern 4. The number of pattern matohew when the detection window 97 is shifted from the reference position is desirably as small as possible so as to pre~re~t the second data synchronous s~riss Crr~ b~i~ig $staken~.y detected. Accordingly, with w~p~ct to the bit ~hift, the autooorz~elat±on characteri~tics ~f th~ s~q~o~d 4e*s sy~ohronous series is batter when paj~rn 4 is used.<br><br>

The slice l~ve1 is normally set at the center of the amplitude of the reproduction signal as shown in Figure iBA. However, the slice level may riee or fall, as shown in Figures 185 and lOC, varying the measure for digit±~ing into a binary value. As a result, th~ signal series which should be r~produc~d as "10001000" in the NRZI code as shown in Figure iSA is reproduced as "10010000" when the slice level. r4.s~s as •how~ in F'igure 183 or reproduced as "l00001'00" when t~e g~.io~ level falls am shown in FigLr~ t~C.<br><br>
