				<td>The present invention relates to a fluid flow sensor using centrifugal force type flow<br>
transducer. More particularly this invention pertains to a system or arrangement for accurately<br>
measuring the rate of flow of a fluid through a pipeline which is one of the most important<br>
requirements in any process plant in order to run the plant at optimum efficiency resulting in<br>
higher output with consequent cost saving.<br>
Heretofore various effects like the effect of energy associated with a fluid flowing<br>
through a pipeline have been attempted to be utilized, such as for instance, Doppler effect and<br>
effect of speed of the fluid on the rate of flow and the like, in designing various flow meters. In<br>
the coriolis flow meter, the effects of velocity of a flowing fluid and the extent of vibration of a<br>
pipeline section through which the fluid flows are put to use to produce a coriolis force which<br>
acts on the pipe wall in the opposite directions in the upstream and downstream sides. As a<br>
result, the resultant oscillation of the upstream side will lag with respect to the centre of the<br>
pipeline section, and that of the downstream side will lead. The delay in time between the<br>
vibrations of these two sides is directly proportional to the mass flow rate, and the results in an<br>
accurate measurement of the flow rate. Effect of different factors like properties of fluid,<br>
operating conditions, installation technique, etc. on coriolis mass flow meters have been studied<br>
and improved versions of such flow meters have been designed.<br>
In anemometer type mass flow meters, the cooling effect of a flowing fluid on a heating<br>
element inside the fluid is utilized in terms of change in resistance of the element with flow rate.<br>
In the vortex flow meter, frequency of vortices produced behind a blunt post in a pipeline<br>
under the turbulent condition is directly proportional to the volume flow rate of the fluid passing<br>
through the pipeline. B. Rodgers and his co-workers (IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits, Vol.<br>
33, No.12, pp.2121-2133, 1998) have developed a flow sensor module consisting of an<br>
application-specific-integrated-circuit (ASIC) with a fluidic oscillation element and a<br>
differential capacitive pressure sensor (SCS) mounted in a sealed aluminium casing. N. Svedin<br>
and his co-workers (Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems, Vol, 12, No.6, pp 937-946,<br>
December 2003) have developed a micro machined silicon torque sensor which senses the torque<br>
produced at the bearing surface of static turbine placed in a flow tube, and have shown that this<br>
torque is linearly related to the volume flow rate through the pipeline.<br><br>
Despite sensitivity of the instruments and reproducibility of the results obtained, the<br>
instruments in question require careful handling and periodic servicing,-apart from being costly<br>
and power â€” intensive.<br>
This invention aims at overcoming the above drawbacks of the prior art and provides a<br>
novel type of flow sensor which is simple in construction, easy to operate and is cost-effective.<br>
The principal objective of this invention is to provide a fluid flow sensor using<br>
centrifugal force type flow transducer.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a fluid flow sensor which incorporates<br>
simple components like common pan-balance for measuring the rate of flow of fluid through a<br>
pipeline.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a fluid flow sensor which is fabricated<br>
from simple components available indigenously, is user friendly and cost-effective.<br>
The foregoing objects are achieved by the present invention which relates to a fluid flow<br>
sensor using centrifugal force type flow transducer, comprising-<br>
(a)	a common balance swinging on a fulcrum and having an weighing tray and a second<br>
tray for placing weights;<br>
(b)	a hollow u- tube carrying bellows on upper parts of both limbs and having two bent<br>
portions serving as inlet and outlet for the fluid flowing through it;<br>
(c)	a soft iron core attached to one of the pans and executing vertical movement in the<br>
upward or downward direction through an opening provided in the upper surface of a<br>
container/receptacle;<br>
(d)	the said container or receptacle being provided with inductive pick-up coil carrying<br>
lead wires for attachment with a Maxwell's bridge arrangement which in turn is<br>
provided with a magnetic shielding to eliminate any extraneous interference.<br>
Theoretical consideration in respect of the present invention and the drawings<br>
accompanying these specifications are referred to hereinafter for illustrating the invention.<br>
Let us consider a fluid of density 'p' flowing with a velocity V through a semi-circular<br>
cylindrical pipe of radius r and cross-section 'A' placed in a vertical plane as shown in Fig. 1 of<br>
the accompanying drawings.<br><br>
Let us consider an elementary length ds=rd8of the circular pipe at an angle 0 from the<br>
horizontal X-axis as shown in Fig.1 of the drawings. The centrifugal force by this element acting<br>
radially outwards is given by<br><br>
In order to measure this force and reduce the effect of turbulence, the two ends of the<br>
above semicircular pipe line section are extended in the form of the straight long vertical pipe<br>
line sections so that the sensor takes the form of a vertical U-tube section as shown in Fig. 2 of<br>
the drawings. This U-tube is connected with the main pipeline through metallic or non-metallic<br>
bellows junctions and rests on the pan at one end of the beam of a common balance as shown in<br>
this figure. At no flow condition of the fluid, the beam is made horizontal by placing fixed dead<br>
weights on the weighing pan at the other end. The end carrying the U-tube section is rigidly<br>
attached with the soft iron core of an inductive pick-up coil as shown therein.<br><br>
When the liquid flows through this U-tube section via the bellows junction, the upper<br>
straight part of the U-tube reduces the turbulence of the liquid and the lower semicircular part<br>
senses the centrifugal force produced by the fluid. So when the fluid flows, the end of the beam<br>
of the common balance carrying the U-tube section moves downwards along with the core of the<br>
inductive pickup coil by the action of the centrifugal force as shown in equation no. (6).The<br>
pickup coil consists of two parallel magnetic paths which decreases the effective reluctance and<br>
hence increases the sensitivity of the coil. This pickup coil is connected to one of the ratio arms<br>
of a Maxwell's bridge circuit as shown in Fig. 3 of the drawings, whereas the other end of the<br>
ratio arms consists of identical dummy inductance coil so that at no flow condition of the fluid,<br>
the bridge is almost at balanced condition when the resistances in the other ratio arms are<br>
identical.<br>
From the construction of the pickup coil as shown in Fig.2 of the drawings, it is found<br>
that the coil along with its movable core has two parallel magnetic reluctance paths like a shell<br>
type transformer. The effective reluctance 'R' of this magnetic circuit is given by<br><br>
where x1=x0+Î”x,Âµ=reIative permeability of the movable core material, Âµ1=relative<br>
permeability of iron frame material, A=effective area of the movable core, Ai=effective area of<br>
the magnetic path in the frame material, Ll=effective length of the magnetic path in the frame at<br>
one side, d=length of the small air gap between the core and the frame, X0=length of the core at<br>
no flow condition inside the pickup coil and Î”x = displacement of the core U-tube due to the<br>
centrifugal force produced by the flow.<br>
Hence a fluid flow rate 'Q, the effective magnetic reluctance of the coil can be written as<br><br>
where, K1 and K2 are constants given by<br><br><br><br>
where n is the number of turns of the coil.<br>
Since LÂ»Î”x, so from eqns. (9) and (10), K1Â»K2 Î”x. Hence the above equation is<br>
reduced to<br><br>
where Lx0=n2/K1 is the inductance of the pickup coil at no flow condition and Î”Lx<br>
=n2K2Î”x/K12 is the change in inductance of this coil due to the fluid flow through the pipeline.<br>
From Fig. 3 of the drawings the bridge output voltage Eo for sinusoidal supply voltage Vs is<br>
given by<br><br>
Now the bridge is balanced at no flow condition when the beam of the common balance<br>
is horizontal so that R2LX0=R1L0. Hence putting this condition in the above equation, the bridge<br>
output at flow condition of the fluid is given by<br><br>
Now the displacement Ax of the core is due to the centrifugal force (Fy) only. Since the<br>
beam of the balance is initially made horizontal at no flow condition of the fluid and the<br>
centrifugal force due to the flowing liquid is generally small, so the displacement Ax of the core<br>
may be assumed to be directly proportional to the centrifugal force (Fy).<br><br>
where K3 is the constant of proportionality. Combining the foregoing eqn. nos. (6), (15)<br>
and (16) one would arrive at -<br><br>
Hence for a given fluid the bridge output will have almost a parabolic relation with the fluid flow<br>
rate (Q)<br><br>
As mentioned earlier, the invention is illustrated by the accompanying drawings, wherein<br>
Fig. 1 represents semicircular pipe line section;<br>
Fig. 2 shows a centrifugal force type flow transducer is fully assembled form;<br>

flow-chart;<br>
Fig. 5 is the static characteristic graph of the proposed flow sensor and<br>
Fig. 6 shows the percentage deviation graph from best fit static characteristic of the flow sensor.<br>
The subject invention will now be further described in specific details by means of the<br>
undernoted working example which is given by way of illustration and not by way of limitation.<br>
Example<br>
The flow sensor of the subject invention has been designed and fabricated by using a<br>
common pan balance and a U-tube flow sensor made from 12mm (0.5 inch) dia PVC tube. The<br>
lower semi-circular part of the U-tube has a mean diameter of around 100mm and length of the<br>
vertical parts of the U-tube is around 250mm. This U-tube is connected with the main 25mm (1")<br>
dia. water supply line through bellows usually made of metal, as illustrated in Fig. 2 of the<br>
drawings. The U- tube is placed vertically on one of the weighing pans at one end of the beam of<br>
a common balance and on the other pan suitable weights are placed so that the beam is horizontal<br>
when there is no flow of water through the U-tube which is filled with water at rest. Under this<br>
condition the soft iron core attached to the bottom of the pan carrying U-tube assumes a<br>
particular position inside the inductive pick-up coil upto a length X0, as shown in Fig. 2 of the<br>
drawings. Next values of resistance R1 and R2 in the ratio arm of the Maxwell's bridge as shown<br>
in Fig. 3 of the drawings are adjusted until the bridge output is minimum. The bridge output is<br>
measured with the help of a multimeter and a cathode ray oscillograph (CRO) as the detector.<br>
The foregoing experimental setup has been illustrated in the form of a sequential flow-<br>
sheet diagram in Fig. 4 of the drawings. In the aforesaid experimental set-up, an overhead water<br>
tank is maintained at a constant level by ensuring that the rate of inflow is greater than the<br>
exhaust rate of water. Water from this tank is allowed to flow into the U-tube sensor through a<br><br>
valve, usually operated manually. Flow through the U-tube is changed in steps of increasing and<br>
decreasing modes, and at each step the bridge output is measured. The flow rate is monitored by<br>
direct water collection procedure, and results obtained are found to be reproducible and identical<br>
The bridge output voltage has been plotted against flow, giving rise to a parabolic static<br>
characteristic graph as shown in Fig. 5 of the drawings. The percentage deviation of the<br>
experimental data from the best-fit prabolie characteristics has been calculated, a plot of which<br>
is shown in Fig. 6 of the drawings.<br>
The static characteristic graph of the flow sensor of the present invention as shown in Fig.<br>
5 of the drawings has a parabolic nature, which substantially follows and conforms to equation<br>
(17} given above. In the course of increasing and decreasing modes of experiments, identical<br>
results were obtained for the same flow rate, and this establishes a satisfactory repeatability of<br>
the flow sensor. The non-linear characteristic graph can be easily lenearised by using<br>
microprocessor or PC-based linearization technique developed by the Applicant and his co-<br>
workers.<br>
Advantages:<br>
(i) Construction of the transducer is very simple, and measurements involve no contact<br>
with the process fluid,<br>
(ii) Fabrication of the equipment or part(s) thereof can be done by using material(s) and<br>
machineries available indigenously, resulting in a very cost-effective, user-friendly<br>
transducer, particularly when compared with the existing sophisticated flow meters<br>
like coriolis-flow meter, vortex flow meter etc.<br>
(iii) Use of bellows element is another unique feature of the invention, selection of which<br>
may be conveniently varied, depending on the pressure of the fluid material flowing<br>
through the sensor;<br>
(iv) Compactness of the transducer may be further enhanced by using a compact lever<br>
system in lieu of the common pan balance;<br>
(v) From equation (6) given earlier, it follows that the sensitivity of the sensor increases<br>
with the reduction of the cross-sectional area (A) of the sensing pipe. Hence to<br>
measure flow rate in large diameter pipeline, a flow sensor of very small cross-section<br>
may be used in a by-pass line of the main pipe line and a suitable correction factor<br><br>
may be applied for the flow rate measurement in a large pipe line, which is further<br>
evidence of the versatility of the transducer of the present invention.<br>
As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without departing or<br>
deviating from the spirit and/or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be understood that<br>
the above-described example is not limited by any of the details of the foregoing description,<br>
unless otherwise specified, bat rather should be construed broadly within its spirit and scope as<br>
defined in the appended claims and, therefore, all changes and modifications that fall within the<br>
meets and bounds of the claims, or equivalences of such meets and bounds are therefore intended<br>
