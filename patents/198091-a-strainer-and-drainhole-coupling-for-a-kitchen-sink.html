				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>A kitchen rink of known generally has a drain hole to drain water off from the sink.<br><br>
This invention relates to a strainer and drain hole coupling for a kitchen sink. The term "KITCHEN SINK" in this specification also means and includes sinks other than those used in the kitchen, as for the instance, sinks used in laboratories; wash basins. In the known kitchen sinks a plug is normally provided for closing and opening the drain hole, hi the closed position of the drain hole water is retained within the bowl, while in the opened position, water and other substances, if any, are allowed to passed through.<br>
la the known kitchen sinks a strainer is sometime provided for preventing large size substances within the bowl from passing in to the drain hole and clogging the drainage system.<br>
Thus, in the known kitchen sinks, where the strainers are used, to close the drain hole, it is necessary to remove the strainer and keep it aside, before inserting the plug into the drain hole. To open the drain hole, the reverse sequence of steps is followed, by removing the plug from the drain hole and then keeping the strainer in place over the drain hole.<br><br>
The above procedure is cumbersome. The strainer, once removed from the position, to make way for the plug, is quit often misplaced. The plug is also liable to be misplaced, unless it is chained to the bowl which gives the system an unseemly look.<br>
This invention proposes to do away with the above mentioned drawbacks, dosing and opening the drain hole, while rendering the strainer operative in the opened position of the drain hole, is a simple one-handed operation. Neither the strainer nor the plug ever leaves the bowl.<br>
Various other advantages of this invention wQl be apparent from the following further description thereof.<br>
The drainer and drain hole coupling for a kitchen sink, according to this invention, comprises the strainer member and a drain hole member, wherein the strainer member has a perforated cup at its top, a plug at its base for snugly mating with the drain hole, and a plurality of peripheral fins provided between the cup and the plug, while the drain hole member has a plurality of peripheral ledge, corresponding to the fins, provided above the drain hole, said ledges being separated by peripheral clefts also corresponding to the fins, whereby whenever the strainer member is placed over the drain hole member with the fins resting on the corresponding ledges, the plug is raised above, and out of contact with, the drain hole, to allow passage of water, through   the<br><br>
perforations, to Hie drain hole ; and whereby whenever the strainer member is placed over the drain hole member, with the fins inserted in to the clefts, the plug is simultaneously lowered into the drain hole to close it<br><br>
The coupling proposed herein will now be described in further detail by referring to the accompanying drawing which illustrate, by way of example, one of possible embodiments of this invention, wherein<br>
Fif.1 illustrates a perspective view of the Strainer member showing the perforation, the fins and the plug.<br>
Fif. 3 illustrates a perspective view of the drain hole member showing the ledges and the clefts in between.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates (in sectional elevation) the strainer member placed over the drain hole Member with the fins of the former resting on the   ledges of the latter and<br>
Fif. 4 illustrates (in sectional elevation) the strainer member placed over the drain hole member with the fins of the former located in the clefts.<br><br>
The strainer member S has a perforated cup E, the perforations serving the strain substance which cannot pass there through.<br>
The drainer member has a plug P at its base, for snugly mating with the drain hole H In the drain hole member D.<br>
A plurality of peripherals fins F are provided, for the strainer member 8, between the cup £ and the plug P, while the drain hole member D has a plurality of peripherals ledges L» corresponding to the fins, provided above the drain hole H, said ledges being separated by peripheral clefts C corresponding to the fins, whereby whenever the strainer member is placed over the drain hole member with the fins F resting on the corresponding ledges (Flg.3), the plug is raised above, that is to say, in a raised position with respect to, and out of contact with, the drain hole, to allow passage of water, through the perforation in the cup E, to the drain hole. This corresponds to the open position of the drain hole with the strainer operative.<br>
However, when it is required to close the drain hole, all that has to be done is lift the strainer member, rotate it slightly and lower it once again, so that the fins F are no longer seated on the ledges L, but, on the other hand, inserted in to the clefts C The plug P is consequently lowered into the drain hole H to close it.<br>
A knob K provided for the strainer member enables the said member to be manually lifted, rotated and set down.<br><br>
The reverse sequence of steps, opens the drain hole and simultaneously makes the strainer operative.<br>
In use, the drain hole member is fixed to tile base portion  of the bowl of the sink and communicates with the drain pipe.<br>
The terms and expression in this specification are of description and not of limitation, having regard to the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1. A strainer and drain hole coupling for  strainer member and a drain hole member a perforated cup at its top, a plug at it be drain hole,   and a plurality of peripheral<br>
and the plug, while Hie drain hole member has a plurality ox pwii&gt;uK»« ledges, corresponding to the fins, provided above the drain hole, said ledges being separated by peripheral clefts also corresponding to the fins, whereby whenever the strainer member is placed over the drain hole member with the fins resting on the corresponding ledges, the plug is raised above, and out of contact with, the drain hole, to allow passage of water, through the perforation, to the drain hole; and whereby whenever the strainer member is placed over the drain hole member, with the fins inserted into the clefts, the plug is simultaneously lowered into the drain hole to close it.<br>
2.	A strainer and drain hole coupling for a kitchen sink as claimed in claim<br>
1 wherein the strainer member is provided with a knob.<br>
3.	A strainer and drain hole coupling for a kitchen sink, substantially as<br>
herein described with reference to, and as illustrated in, the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br><br></td>
