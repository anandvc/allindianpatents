				<td>CUTTING TOOL AND CUTTING INSERT THEREFOR<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a cutting tool and particularly to a milling<br>
cutting tool capable of performing face milling operations at a high feed rate and a<br>
long tool shank. The invention also discloses an indexable cutting insert for use<br>
with the cutting tool.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Japanese Publication No. 2000202703 A to Masaharu discloses a boring tool<br>
having two identical nearly parallelogrammatic plate form tips. Bach tip has a pair<br>
of first cutting edges 15 and a pair of second cutting edges 16 arranged in a<br>
rotational symmetry and connected via a nose part 17. The first cutting edge 15<br>
having a circular arcing cutting edge 15a at the side of the nose part 17 and a<br>
rectilinear cutting edge 15b merging with the cutting edge 15a via a first bending<br>
part 15. The second cutting edge 16 having two rectilinear cutting edges 16a and<br>
16b merging via a second bending part 16c.<br>
Each of the tips used in "703 is disposed differently with respect to the tool<br>
since each of the cutting edges has different characteristics. Since the cutting edges<br>
are arranged in 180° rotational symmetry, each tip can be indexed only two times at<br>
its pocket Furthermore, if the tips used in "703 ate used to perform ramp-down<br>
milling they are not properly supported against radially outwardly directed cutting<br>
forces that tend to withdraw each tip out of its pocket<br>
Japanese Publication No. 2000-005921 to Yoshimitsu shows, in Fig. 4<br>
thereof, a three-corner cutting insert Each of the three cutting edges comprises a<br>
small curved cutting edge portion 7 and a large straight cutting edge portion 8. The<br>
cutting insert of "921 does not have a cutting edge specifically designed for<br>
performing ramp-down milling. Furthermore, the cutting insert is not properly<br>
supported against radially outwardly directed cutting forces mat tend to withdraw<br>
the cutting insert out of its pocket during a ramp-down milling operation.<br>
Another kind of tool, having means for preventing rotation of the cutting<br>
insert around the axis of the clamping screw, is shown in European Patent No. EP 0<br>
091 408 Bl to Bylund. In "408 there is disclosed a cutting insert 12 having three<br>
convex cutting edges 16, 17 and 18. Each of the cutting edges is connected, at a<br>
rear end thereof, to an auxiliary cutting edge 32, which extends transversely to the<br>
cutting edge and forms an obtuse angle therewith. The auxiliary cutting edge 32 is<br>
intended to cut the workpiece during reversed relative movement between the insert<br>
and the workpiece. The cutting edges of the cutting insert 12 are not peripherally<br>
continuous around the top face of the cutting insert Instead, they are separated by<br>
an intermediate peripheral space 24, 25 and 26. The cutting insert 12 is not<br>
provided with a cutting edge for performing ramp-down milling operations and is<br>
not especially supported against radially outwardly directed cutting forces that tend<br>
to withdraw the cutting insert out of its pocket For preventing rotation of the<br>
cutting insert, the cutting insert is provided with a supporting surface 27 that is<br>
directed substantially towards the center of the cutting insert The supporting<br>
surface 27 abuts against an abutment surface 28 on the tool body that fits into the<br>
intermediate peripheral surface.<br>
A disadvantage of thE tool of "408 is that in order to prevent rotation of the<br>
cutting insert, the cutting edges are formed with recesses which complicate and<br>
weaken the cutting insert.<br>
DE-A-10052963 discloses a cutting tool, having a longitudinal axis, the cutting<br>
tool comprising a tool body having a mounting leg formed at a front end thereof,<br>
the mounting leg having an insert pocket with a cutting insert (5) retained<br>
therein, the insert pocket comprising a base wall and first and second rear<br>
sidewall sections transversely directed to the base wall, the cutting insert<br>
comprising an upper surface, a tower surface and a side surface extending<br>
therebetween, the upper and side surfaces intersecting at a cutting edge<br>
(6a,6b,6c).<br>
DE - A -10052963 further discloses a cutting insert comprising an upper surface,<br>
a tower surface and a side surface extending therebetween, the upper and side<br>
surfaces intersecting at a cutting edge (6a,6b,6c), the cutting insert having an<br>
insert axis passing through the upper and bottom surfaces, the cutting edge<br>
comprising three cutting edge portions that are separated from each other by<br>
comer cutting edges (6b), whereby each cutting edge portion comprises a first<br>
convex cutting edge (6a) that extends between a second cutting edge (6c) and<br>
an adjacent corner cutting edge (6b).<br>
DE-C-680 231 suggests a cutting insert provided with a cylindrical protrusion (g).<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a cutting tool and a cutting<br>
insert therefore that significantly reduce or overcome the aforementioned<br>
disadvantages.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Attention is drawn to the drawings. A cutting tool 10 comprises a tool body<br>
12 having a plurality of mounting legs 14 formed at a front end 16 of the tool body<br>
12. Each mounting leg 14 has an insert pocket 18 in which a cutting insert 20 is<br>
retained by means of a retaining screw 22. The cutting tool 10 has a rear end 23<br>
opposite the front end 16 with an axis of rotation A passing through the front and<br>
rear ends 16, 23 defining a front to rear direction.<br>
The insert pocket comprises a base wall 24 and a sidewall 26 that is<br>
transversely directed to the base wall 24. A generally circular recess 28 extends<br>
downwardly from the base wall 24. The recess 28 has a lower wall 30 bounded by a<br>
peripheral wall 32 extending uprightly from the lower wall 30 to the base wall 24.<br>
The peripheral wall 32 of the recess 28 preferably comprises two circular portions of<br>
differing radii, but having the same center. The peripheral wall 32 comprises a<br>
major portion 34 having a major radius Rl, and a minor portion 36 having a minor<br>
radius R2. The minor radius R2 is smaller than the major radius Rl. According to<br>
a specific application of the present invention, the minor radius R2 is 0.25 mm<br>
smaller than the major radius Rl. The angular extent of the minor portion 36 is<br>
smaller than the angular extent of the major portion 34. In accordance with a<br>
specific application, the minor portion 36 of the peripheral wall 32 has an angular<br>
extent ? of approximately 40°. A threaded bore 38, having a pocket axis C, for<br>
receiving the retaining screw 22, extends downwardly from the lower wall 30 of the<br>
recess 28. The centers of the two circles on which the major and minor portions 34,<br>
36 lie coincide with the axis C.<br>
The sidewall 26 comprises three sidewall sections, two rear sidewall sections,<br>
a first rear sidewall section 40 and a second rear sidewall section 42 separated by a<br>
first recessed region 44 and a side sidewall section 46. The first rear sidewall<br>
section 40 is adjacent the side sidewall section 46 and separated from it by a second<br>
recessed region 48. The first rear sidewall section 40 has a region 50 adjacent the<br>
first recessed region 44, at least a portion of which constitutes a first abutment<br>
surface 52 for abutting the cutting insert 20. Similarly, the second rear sidewall<br>
section 42 has a region 54 adjacent the first recessed region 44, at least a portion of<br>
which constitutes a second abutment surface 56 for abutting (he cutting insert 20.<br>
Also, at least a portion of the minor portion 36 constitutes a third abutment surface<br>
58 for abutting the cutting insert 20. As will be explained in greater detail below,<br>
the first, second and third abutment surfaces are designed to retain the cutting insert<br>
20 in the insert pocket 18 in a well defined and secure manner.<br>
Attention is drawn to Fig. 5. It will be noted mat the minor portion 36, and<br>
therefore the third abutment surface 58, is located adjacent the side sidewall 46<br>
towards the front of the insert pocket 18. In terms of an analog dock, the minor<br>
portion is located approximately between 7 and 8 O" clock. It will be appreciated<br>
mat the precise location of the minor portion 36 is a question of design and<br>
distribution of forces. In practice, the illustrated location of the minor portion 36 is<br>
a preferred location. However, it can also be located at other locations between the<br>
preferred location up to approximately adjacent the second recessed region 48.<br>
The cutting insert 20 comprises an upper surface 60, a lower surface 62 and a<br>
side surface 64 mat extends between the upper and lower surfaces 60, 62. The<br>
upper surface 60 and the side surface 64 intersect at a cutting edge 66 comprising<br>
three cutting edge portions 68 separated from each other by corner cutting edges 70.<br>
Each of the three cutting edge portions comprises a convex first cutting edge 72 that<br>
extends between a straight second cutting edge 74 and an adjacent corner cutting<br>
edge 70. The side surface 64 is divided into sections corresponding to the various<br>
cutting edges. Accordingly, the side surface 64 has a first side surface section 76<br>
adjacent the first cutting edge 72, a second side surface section 78 adjacent the<br>
second cutting edge 74 and side surface corner section 80 adjacent corner cutting<br>
edge 70. A cylindrical protrusion 82 having a cylindrical peripheral surface 84<br>
extends downwardly from the lower surface 62 to a bottom surface 86 of the<br>
protrusion 82. The peripheral surface 84 is perpendicular to the lower surface 62.<br>
A centrally located through bore 88, having an insert axis B, extends between the<br>
upper surface 60 and the bottom surface 86. The protrusion 82 has a protrusion<br>
radius R3. The protrusion radius R3 is smaller than the major radius Rl and<br>
approximately equal to the minor radius R2.<br>
The three cutting edge portions 68 are rotationally symmetrically arranged<br>
with respect to the insert axis B. The first cutting edge 72 is substantially larger<br>
than the second cutting edge 74. According to a preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the first cutting edge 72 subtends a first angle a of 70° at the<br>
insert axis B and the second cutting edge 74 subtends a second angle b of 35° at the<br>
insert axis B. The first and second cutting edges 72, 74 of a given cutting edge<br>
portion 68 make an obtuse interior third angle d of 153° between each other. The<br>
cutting insert 20 is indexable and has three indexing positions.<br>
In order to secure the cutting insert 20 in the insert pocket 18, the protrusion<br>
82 is inserted into the recess 28 until the lower surface 62 of the cutting insert abuts<br>
the base wall 24 of the insert pocket, with a portion of a given side surface corner<br>
section 80 located in the first recessed region 44. The retaining screw 22 is then<br>
placed in the through bore 88 of the cutting insert and threadingly engaged with the<br>
threaded bore 38 and tightened for securely retaining the cutting insert in the insert<br>
pocket 18. When the cutting insert 20 is securely retained in the insert pocket 18 the<br>
first and second abutment surfaces 52, 56 abut the first and second side surface<br>
sections 76, 78 located on either side of the given side surface comer 80, being<br>
common to the first and second side surface sections 76, 78, at first and second<br>
support surfaces 52", 56", respectively and the third abutment surface 58 abuts the<br>
cylindrical peripheral surface 84 of the protrusion 82 at a third support surface 58".<br>
The pocket axis C of the threaded bore 38 is slightly offset with respect to<br>
the insert axis B. This offset, i.e., eccentricity, is provided so that when the retaining<br>
screw 22 is tightened, abutment forces are exerted by the abutment surfaces 52, 56,<br>
58 on the cutting insert providing a pre-tensioning of the cutting insert 20 in order to<br>
obtain a well defined location of the cutting insert 20 in the insert pocket 18. Since<br>
the third abutment surface 58 lies on a surface which is concentric with the pocket<br>
axis C the abutment force applied by it on the protrusion 82 of fee cutting insert is<br>
directed towards the insert axis B and therefore cannot contribute to the rotation of<br>
the cutting insert about the insert axis B. The location and direction of each of the<br>
first and second abutment surfaces 52, 56 are designed so that the under working<br>
conditions net abutment force applied by these abutments surfaces to the side<br>
surface 64 of the insert does not give rise to rotation of the cutting insert about the<br>
insert axis B. In other words, the lines of action of the abutment forces of the first<br>
and second abutment surfaces 52, 56 operate in opposite senses about the insert axis<br>
B and cancel out. Hence, the present invention guarantees unique and stable<br>
location of the cutting insert 20 in the insert pocket 18.<br>
The cutting tool 10 is particularly suitable for performing face milling by the<br>
first cutting edge 72 and ramp-down milling operations by the second cutting edge<br>
74. Since the first cutting edge 72 is convex and has a relatively large radius of<br>
curvature, the cutting insert 20 can cut at a relatively high feed speed at a small<br>
depth of cut The cutting forces acting on the cutting insert in such a case are<br>
directed substantially axially, therefore, it is possible to cut with a tool having a<br>
relatively long overhang without exceeding the allowed radial forces that tend to<br>
bend the tool and cause vibrations.<br>
Although the present invention has been described to a certain degree of<br>
particularity, it should be understood that various alterations and modifications<br>
could be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as<br>
hereinafter claimed.<br>
