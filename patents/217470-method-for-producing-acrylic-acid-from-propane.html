				<td>           The present invention relates to the production of acrylic acid from propane in the<br>
presence or in the absence of molecular oxygen.<br>
It is known from European patent application No. EP-A-608838 to prepare an<br>
unsaturated carboxylic acid from an alkane with a catalytic oxidation reaction, in<br>
vapour phase, in the presence of a catalyst containing a mixed metal oxide comprising<br>
10 as essential components, Mo, V, Te, O, as well as at least one element chosen from<br>
the group constituted by niobium, tantalum, tungsten, titanium, aluminium,<br>
zirconium, chromium, manganese, iron, ruthenium, cobalt, rhodium, nickel,<br>
palladium, platinum, antimony, bismuth, boron, indium and cerium, these elements<br>
being present in very precise proportions. The reaction can be implemented using a<br>
15 gaseous mixture composed of the alkane, oxygen, an inert gas and water vapour<br>
presenting the following molar proportions:<br>
alkane/oxygen/inert gas/water vapour = 1/0.1-10/0-20/0.2-70<br>
and preferably 1/1-5/0-10/5-40.<br>
Moreover, European patent application No. EP-A-895809 describes catalysts<br>
20 based on oxides comprising molybdenum, vanadium, niobium, oxygen, tellurium<br>
and/or antimony, as well as at least one other element such as iron or aluminium.<br>
These catalysts can be used for the conversion of propane to acrylic acid, in the<br>
presence of molecular oxygen, as illustrated in Examples 9 and 10. Example 9, in<br>
particular, describes the oxidation of propane using a catalyst having the formula<br>
25                                                   Mo1Vo33Nb0.11Te0.22Ou<br>
from a gas flow composed of propane, oxygen, helium and a flow of water vapour,<br>
according to a molar ratio propane/oxygen/helium/water vapour of approximately<br>
1/3.2/12.1/143. In such a gas flow, the flow of reactive gas has a very low<br>
concentration of propane. Consequently the recycling of the unconverted propane is<br>
30 much more difficult because this unconverted propane is too diluted in the reaction<br>
flow.<br>
The aim of the invention is to propose a process for the production of acrylic acid<br>
from propane, in the presence or in the absence of molecular oxygen, which allows a<br><br>
R:/Brevels/20200/20293US-22/02/05<br><br>
2<br>
higher conversion of propane to be obtained while retaining good acrylic acid<br>
selectivity.<br>
The inventors have discovered that this aim can be achieved by passing a gaseous<br>
mixture comprising propane, water vapour, as well as optionally an inert gas and/or<br>
5     molecular oxygen, over a particular catalyst. When operating in the presence of<br>
molecular oxygen the oxidation is carried out under conditions such that the oxygen<br>
of the gaseous mixture is in a substoichiometric proportion in relation to the propane<br>
introduced, which allows the catalyst to act in a similar way to a redox system and<br>
provides the oxygen which is lacking so that the reaction is carried out in a<br>
10     satisfactory way.<br>
The advantages of this novel process are the following: -<br>
-    the limitation of the overoxidation of the products formed which takes place in<br>
the presence of too great a quantity of molecular oxygen; according to the<br>
present invention, due to the fact of operating in substoichiometry, the<br>
15                formation of COX (carbon monoxide and carbon  dioxide),  degradation<br>
products, is reduced, which allows the acrylic acid selectivity to be increased;<br>
-    the acrylic acid selectivity is maintained at a good level;<br>
-    the conversion is increased without loss of selectivity;<br>
-     the catalyst undergoes only a low reduction and therefore a small loss of its<br>
20                activity; it can easily be regenerated by heating in the presence of oxygen or a<br>
gas containing oxygen after a certain period of use; after regeneration, the<br>
catalyst regains its initial activity and can be used in another reaction cycle;<br>
-     moreover, the separation of the stages of reduction of the catalyst and of<br>
regeneration of the latter can be provided which allows the partial pressure of<br>
25                propane to be increased, such a partial supply pressure of propane being little<br>
limited by the existence of an explosive zone created by the propane + oxygen<br>
mixture, because the later is present in molecular form in substoichiometric<br>
proportions;<br>
-    moreover, this process allows reduction of the formation of products produced<br>
30                by hydration, in particular propionic acid, acetone and acetic acid.<br>
The subject of the present invention is therefore a process for the production of<br>
acrylic acid from propane, in which a gaseous mixture containing propane, water<br>
vapour, optionally an inert gas, and/or molecular oxygen is passed over a catalyst of<br>
formula (I):<br><br>
3<br>
                                      Mo1VaSbbNbcSidOI                                   (I)<br>
in which:<br>
-     a is comprised between 0.006 and 1, inclusive;<br>
-     b is comprised between 0.006 and 1, inclusive;<br>
5                  -    c is comprised between 0.006 and 1, inclusive;<br>
-     d is comprised between 0 and 3.5, inclusive; and<br>
-     x is the quantity of oxygen bound lo the other elements and depends on<br>
their oxidation state.<br>
in order to oxidize the propane to acrylic acid, and when operating in the presence of<br>
10     molecular oxygen, the molar ratio propane/molecular oxygen in the initial gaseous<br>
mixture is greater than 0.5.<br>
Such a process allows an acrylic acid selectivity of close to 60 % and a high<br>
conversion of propane to be obtained simultaneously. Moreover, it can easily be<br>
implemented in a fluidized bed or in a moving bed and the injection of the reagents<br>
15 can be carried out at different points of the reactor, so as to be outside of the<br>
flammability zone white having a high propane concentration and, consequently, a<br>
high catalyst productivity.<br>
According to a particularly advantageous embodiment, the process according to<br>
the invention comprises the following stages:<br>
20     I/ In the absence of molecular oxygen<br>
When the initial gaseous mixture is devoid of molecular oxygen, the propane is<br>
oxidized according to the following redox reaction (A):<br>
SOLIDoxidized + PROPANE     SOLIDreduced + ACRYLIC ACID              (A)<br>
II/ In the presence of molecular oxygen<br>
25                   a)  the initial gaseous mixture is introduced into a first reactor with a<br>
moving catalyst bed,<br>
b)  at the outlet of the first reactor, the gases are separated from the catalyst;<br>
c)   the catalyst is returned into a regenerator;<br>
d)   optionally the gases are introduced into a second reactor with a moving<br>
30                        catalyst bed;<br>
e)   if appropriate, at the outlet of the second reactor, the gases are separated<br>
from the catalyst and the acrylic acid contained in the separated gases is<br>
recovered;<br>
f)   if appropriate, the catalyst is returned into the regenerator; and<br><br><br>
                  4<br>
g) the regenerated catalyst from the regenerator is reintroduced into the first<br>
reactor and, if appropriate, the second reactor;<br>
According to another advantageous embodiment of the invention, the reactor or<br>
reactors are also provided with a cocatalyst.<br>
5           According to another advantageous embodiment of the invention, the process<br>
comprises the repetition, in a reactor provided with the catalyst of formula (I) and, if<br>
appropriate, with a cocatalyst, of the cycle comprising the following successive stages:<br>
1)      a stage of injection of the gaseous mixture as defined above;<br>
2)      a stage of injection of water vapour and, if appropriate, of inert gas;<br>
10                3)     a stage of injection of a mixture of molecular oxygen, water vapour and,<br>
if appropriate, inert gas; and<br>
4)     a stage of injection of water vapour and, if appropriate inert gas.<br>
According to an improvement of the advantageous embodiment which has just<br>
been described, the cycle comprises an additional stage which precedes or follows<br>
15     stage 1) and during which a gaseous mixture corresponding to that of stage 1) is<br>
injected but without the molecular oxygen, the molar ratio propane/ molecular oxygen<br>
then being calculated globally for stage 1) and this additional stage.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the improvement which has just<br>
been presented, the additional stage precedes stage 1) in the cycle.<br>
20 Other characteristics and advantages of the invention will now be described in detail<br>
in the following description which is given with reference to the single attached figure<br>
which diagraraatically represents an apparatus which is suitable for the<br>
implementation of an advantageous embodiment of the process according to the<br>
invention.<br>
25     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the invention, in the alternatives where molecular oxygen is<br>
introduced, because the molar ratio propane/molecular oxygen in the initial gaseous<br>
mixture is greater than or equal to 0.5, the conversion of the propane to acrylic acid<br>
using the catalyst is carried out by oxidation, probably according to the following<br>
30     concurrent reactions (A) and (B):<br>
-    the standard catalytic reaction (B):<br>
CH3-CH2-CH3 + 2O2     CH2=CH-COOH +- 2H2O (B)<br>
- and the aforementioned redox reaction (A):<br>
SOLIDoxidzed + CH3-CH2-CH3      SOLIDreduced + CH2 = CH-COOH   (A)<br><br>

The propane/water vapour volume ratio in the initial gaseous mixture is not<br>
critical and can vary within wide limits-<br>
Similarly, the proportion of inert gas, which can be helium* krypton, a mixture of<br>
these two gasses, or nitrogen, carbon dioxide, etc., is also not critical and can also<br>
5     vary within wide limits.<br>
The proportions of the constituents of the initial gaseous mixture are generally as<br>
follows (in molar ratios):<br>
propane/oxygen/inert (He-Kr)/H2O (vapour) = 1/0.05-2/1-10/1-10<br>
Preferably, they are 1/0.1-1/1-5/1-5.<br>
10     Yet more preferably, they are  1/0,167-0.667/2-5/2-5. As particularly beneficial<br>
proportions the following may also be cited:<br>
1/0,2-0.4/4-5/4-5.<br>

preferably from 250 to 450°C, yet more preferably from 350 to 400ºC, The pressure<br>
15     in the reactor or reactors is generally from l.OlxlO4 to I,01xl06 Pa (0.1 to 10<br>
atmospheres), preferably from 5.05xl04 to 5.05x10s Pa (0.-5 atmospheres).<br>
The residence time in the reactor, or if there are several, in each reactor* is<br>
generally from 0.01 to 90 seconds, preferably from 0,1 to 30 seconds.<br>
The catalyst corresponds to the following formula (I):<br>
20                                        MoaSbbNbcSidOx,                      (I)<br>
in which;<br>

-     c is comprised between 0.01 and 0.4, inclusive; and<br>
-     d is comprised between 0.4 and 1.6, inclusive.<br>
The oxides of the different metals included in the composition of the catalyst of<br>
formula (1) can be used as raw materials in the preparation of this catalyst, but the raw<br>
R:/Brevels/20200/20293US-22/02/05<br><br>
materials are not limited to the oxides; among the raw materials which can be used<br>
there may be mentioned, as non-limitative examples:<br>
-    in   the   case   of   molybdenum,   ammonium   molybdate,    ammonium<br>
paramolybdate, ammonium heptarnolybdate, molybdic acid, molybdenum<br>
5                   halides  or oxyhatides  such  as M0Cl5,  organometallic  compounds  of<br>
molybdenum  such  as  molybdenum   alkoxides   such  as  Mo(OC2H5)5,<br>
acetylacetone molybdenyl;<br>
-    in the case of vanadium, ammonium metavanadate, vanadium halides or<br>
oxyhalides such as VC4, VC5 or VOCl3, organometallic compounds of<br>
10                   vanadium such as vanadium alkoxides such as VO(OC2H5)3;<br>
-     in the case of antimony for example antimony oxide (antimony trioxide), in<br>
particular of the senannontite variety, antimony trisulphate, (Sb2SO4)3 or<br>
an antimony cnloride (antimony trichloride, antimony pentachloride);<br>
-    in the case of niobium, niobic acid, niobium tartrate, niobium hydrogen<br>
15                   oxaiate, oxotrioxalatoammonium niobate   {(NH4[NbO(C2O4)]l.5H2O}<br>
niobium and ammonium oxalate, niobium oxalate and tartrate, niobium<br>
nalides or oxyhalides such as NbCl3, NbCl5 and organometallic compounds<br>
of niobium such as niobium alkoxides such as Nb(OC2H5)5, Nb(O-n-Bu)5;<br>
and, generally,, all the compounds which are able to form an oxide by calcination,<br>
20     namely, the metallic salts of organic acids, the metallic salts of mineral acids, the<br>
metal complex compounds, etc.<br>
The source of silicon is generally constituted by colloidal silica and/or<br>
polysiticic acid.<br>
According to particular embodiments, the catalyst of formula (I) can be prepared<br>
25     by mixing aqueous solutions of niobic acid, oxalic acid, ammonium heptamolybdate,<br>
ammonium metavanadate, antimony oxide, under stirring, by the addition, if<br>
appropriate, of colloidal silica, then by precalcinating under air at a temperature<br>
comprised between 280 and 340 C preferably at approximately 300 - 320 C and by<br>
calcinating under nitrogen at approximately 600 C<br>
30             Preferably, in the thus-prepared catalyst of formula (I):<br>
-     a is comprised between 0.09 and 0.8, inclusive;<br>
-     b is comprised between 0.04 and 0.6, inclusive;<br>
-     c is comprised between 0.01 and 04, inclusive; and<br>
-     d is comprised between 0.4 and 1 -6, inclusive.<br><br>
More particularly, the process for the preparation of the catalyst of formula (1) is<br>
implemented by the preparation of a solution of niobic acid, oxalic acid, preparation<br>
of a solution of molybdenum, vanadium, antimony and optionally silica, a mixture of<br>
the 2 solutions produces the formation of a get, drying of the gel obtained produces<br>
5     the formation of a precursor of formula (I') below, precalculation then calcination.<br>
More precisely, according to a particularly preferred process, the catalyst can be<br>
prepared by implementing the following stages:<br>
1)     dissolution in water of a source of vanadium,  for example, ammonium<br>
metavanadate, under stirring and optionally by heating;<br>
10     2)     addition to the previously obtained solution of a source of antimony, for<br>
example antimony oxide in particular the senarmonite variety;<br>
3)      addition of a source of molybdenum, for example, ammonium heptamolybdaie;<br>
4)      reaction of the solution obtained, under reflux;<br>
5)      addition of an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide;<br>
15     6)     if appropriate, addition of silica;<br>
7)      addition of a solution prepared by mixing, under heating, a source of niobium,<br>
for example, niobic acid, with oxalic acid;<br>
8)      reaction of the reaction mixture under reflux and preferably under inert<br>
atmosphere, until a gel is obtained;<br>
20              drying of the gel obtained which leads to a precursor;<br>
9)      precalculation of the precursor; and<br>
10)    calcination of the precalcinated gel in order to obtain the catalyst.<br>
As a variant, instead of having three successive stages 1), 2) and 3), these stages are<br>
combined by introducing the sources of vanadium, antimony and molybdenum into<br>
25     cold water and stirring in order to obtain a solution.<br>
Preferably, in stage 5), hydrogen peroxide is added until an orange-coloured<br>
limpid solution is obtained.<br>
In the alternative processs below:<br>
-     the drying (for example of stage 9) can be carried out in an oven in a thin layer, by<br>
30           atomtzation, freeze-drying, zeodration, with microwaves, etc,<br>
-     the precalculation can be carried out under air flow at 280 - 300°C or under static<br>
air at 320°C, in a fluidized bed, in a rotary furnace in a so-called aerated fixed<br>
bed, so that the catalyst pellets are separated from each other in order to prevent<br>
them from fusing during precatcination or possibly during calcination;<br>
R:/Brevels/20200/20293US-22/02/05<br><br>
8<br>
the calcination is preferably carried out under very pure nitrogen and at a<br>
temperature close to 600°C, for example in a rotary furnace or in a fluidized bed<br>
and for a duration which can be 2 hours.<br>
The catalyst obtained at the end of the calcination can be ground in order to<br>
5 produce smaller particles. If the grinding is continued until a powder constituted by<br>
particles of approximately the size of a micron is obtained, the powder can<br>
subsequently be returned to its form using a binding agent such as for example silica<br>
in the form of poly silicic acid, the suspension then being dried again, for example by<br>
atomrzation.<br>
10                  According to a more particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the<br>
precalcination is carried out:<br>
-     either at a temperature of less than 300ºC under an air flow of at least 10 ml/min/g<br>
of catalyst;<br>
-     or at a temperature ranging from 300 to 350°C under an air flow less than 10<br>
15           ml/min/g of catalyst.<br>
According to a particularly preferred embodiment, the precalculation is carried<br>
out:<br>
-     at approximately 32O°C under an air flow less than 10 ml/min/g; or<br>
-     at approximately 290°C under an air flow of approximately 50 ml/min/g.<br>
20     Regeneration of the catalyst<br>
During the redox reaction (B), the catalyst undergoes reduction and a progressive<br>
loss of its activity. This is why, omce the catalyst has at least partially changed to the<br>
reduced state, its regeneration is carried out according to reaction (C):<br>
SOLIDreduced + O2 → SOLIDoxidized             (C)<br>
25     by heating in the presence of oxygen or a gas containing oxygen at a temperature of<br>
250 to 500 C, for a time necessary for the reoxidation of the catalyst.<br>
The proportions of the constituents of the regeneration gaseous mixture are<br>
generally as follows (in molar ratios):<br>
oxygen/inert(He-Kr)H2O(vapour) =1/1=10/0-10<br>
30     Preferably, they are 1/1-5/0-5.<br>
Instead of using the oxygen alone, dry air (21 % O2) can be used. Instead of or<br>
in addition to the water vapour, moist air can thus be used.<br>
The regeneration temperature is generally from 250 to 500 C.<br><br>
9<br>
Generally the process is carried out until the reduction ratio of the catalyst is<br>
comprised between 0.1 and 10 g of oxygen per kg of catalyst.<br>
This reduction ratio can be monitored during the reaction through the quantity of<br>
products obtained. Then the equivalent quantity of oxygen is calculated. It can also<br>
5     be monitored through the exothermicity of the reaction. The reduction ratio can also<br>
be monitored through the quantity of oxygen consumed in the regenerator.<br>
After regeneration, which can be carried out under temperature and pressure<br>
conditions which are identical to, or different from those of the reactions (A) and (B),<br>
the catalyst regains an initial activity and can be reintroduced into the reactors.<br>
10              The reactions (A) and (B) and the regeneration (C) can be carried out in a standard<br>
reactor, such as a fixed bed reactor, a fluidized bed reactor or a moving bed reactor.<br>
Thus the reactions (A) and (B) and the regeneration (C) can be carried out in a<br>
device  with  two  stages,  namely  a  reactor  and  a  regenerator  which  operate<br>
simultaneously and in which two catalyst loadings alternate periodically.<br>
15              The reactions (A) and (B) and the regeneration (C) can also be carried out in the<br>
same reactor by alternating the periods of reaction and regeneration.<br>
Preferably, the reactions (A) and (B) and the regeneration (C) are carried out in<br>
a reactor with a moving catalyst bed, in particular in a vertical reactor, the catalyst<br>
then preferably moving from the bottom upwards.<br>
20             An operating process with only one passage of the gas or with recycling of the<br>
gas can be used.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the propylene produced and/or the<br>
propane which has not reacted are recycled (or returned) to the inlet of the reactor, i.e.<br>
they are reintroduced at the inlet of the reactor, in a mixture or in parallel with the<br>
25     initial mixture of propane, water vapour and if appropriate inert gas or gases.<br>
Use of an apparatus with two reactors and a regenerator<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the process according<br>
to the invention is used in an apparatus such as the one represented in the attached<br>
30     figure.<br>
The initial gaseous mixture comprising propane, molecular oxygen, water vapour<br>
as well as, if appropriate, an inert gas, is introduced into a first reactor (Riser 1)<br>
containing the moving catalyst bed.<br><br><br><br>
R:/Brevels/20200/20293US-22/02/05<br><br>
10<br>
Then, at the outlet of the first reactor, the effluents are separated into gases and the<br>
moving catalyst bed.<br>
The catalyst is sent into a regenerator.<br>
The gases are introduced into a second reactor (Riser 2) also containing a moving<br>
5     catalyst bed.<br>
At the outlet of the second reactor, the effluents are separated into gases and the<br>
moving bed catalyst.<br>
The catalyst is sent into a regenerator.<br>
The gases are treated in a known way, generally by absorption and purification,<br>
10     with a view to recovering the acrylic acid produced.<br>
The regenerated catalyst is reintroduced into the first reactor as well as into the<br>
second reactor.<br>
The process thus operates continuously, the circulation of the catalyst between the<br>
reactors and the regenerator is earned out in a regular and generally continuous way.<br>
15           Of course, the single regenerator can be replaced by two or more regenerators.<br>
Moreover, it is possible to add, after the second reactor, other reactors which also<br>
have a catalyst circulating between each of these reactors and the regenerator or other<br>
regenerators.<br>
Preferably, the first and second reactors are vertical and the catalyst is transported<br>
20     upwards by the gas flow.<br>
An operating process with only one passage of gases or with recycling of the<br>
products leaving the second reactor can be used.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention,, after treatment of the gas<br>
originating from the second reactor, the propylene produced and/or the propane which<br>
25 has not reacted are recycled (or returned) to the inlet of the reactor, i.e. they are<br>
reintroduced at the inlet of the first reactor, in a mixture or in parallel with the initial<br>
mixture of propane, oxygen, water vapour and, if appropriate, inert gas or gases.<br>
Use of a cocatalvst<br>
According to another advantageous embodiment of the invention, the gaseous<br>
30     mixture also passes over a cocatal yst.<br>
This has the advantage of reducing the production of propionic acid, which is<br>
generally a by-product of the conversion reaction and which poses problems in certain<br>
applications of acrylic acid when it is present in too great a quantity.<br><br><br>
R:/Brevels/20200/20293US-22/02/05<br><br>
11<br>
Thus, the prcpionic acid /acrylic acid ratio is greatly reduced at the outlet of the<br>
reactor.<br>
Moreover, the formation of acetone, which is also a by-product of the<br>
production of acrylic acid from propane, is reduced.<br>
S              To this end, at least one of the reactors comprises a cocatalyst with the following<br>
formula (II):<br>

preferably at least 1.<br>

5.35 g of ammonium paramolybdate and 1.33 g of antimony trisulphate (Sb2SO4)<br>
are successively added under stirring to 30 ml of water heated to 80°C. Stirring is<br>
continued for 15 minutes. Separately, a solution containing 10 µmoles of vanadium is<br>
prepared by dissolving 2,63 g of hydrated vanadyl sulphate in 10 ml of distilled water<br>
15 heated to 80 C. The second solution is added to the first and the mixture is stirred for<br>
15 minutes before being introduced into a 70 ml autoclave covered with Teflon®.<br>
Then nitrogen is bubbled through for 5 minutes so that it substitutes the air present in<br>
the autoclave, before it is closed. The autoclave is then set at 175°C for 24 hours.<br>
After this period, the autoclave is cooled down with tap water for 10 minutes. The<br>
20 black-purple solid obtained in the autoclave is separated from the solution by<br>
filtration, thoroughly washed with distilled water and dried for 12 hours at 80°C. The<br>

stirred continuously for 5 minutes. Finally, the solution containing niobium is added.<br>
20 The mixture is stirred for 10 minutes before being introduced into a 70 ml autoclave<br>
covered with Teflon®. Then nitrogen is bubbled through for 5 minutes so that it<br>
substitutes the air present in the autoclave, before the latter is closed. The autoclave is<br>
then set at 175°C for 48 hours.<br>
After this period, the autoclave is cooled down with tap water for 10 minutes. The<br>
25     black-purple solid obtained in the autoclave is separated from the solution by<br>

substitutes the air present m the autoclave, before the latter is closed. The autoclave is<br>
10     then set at 175°C for 4S hours.<br>
After this period, the autoclave is cooled down with tap water for 10 minutes.<br>
The black-purple solid obtained in the autoclave is separated from the solution by<br>
filtration, thoroughly washed with distilled water and dried for 12 hours at 80°C. The<br>

conditions as catalyst 3. The results are shown in Tables 2 and 3-<br>
Example 5 (comparative)<br>
A catalyst was prepared in the following way.<br>
2.0008 g of hot (90°C) ammonium metavanadate is dissolved in 45 ml of water. Then<br>
20 1.2149 g of antimony trioxide (senarmontite phase) and 10.0142 g of ammonium<br>
heptamolybdate are added. The mixture is taken to reflux under argon, the<br>
temperature is set at 70°C and the solution is left under stirring for 14 hours. The<br>
resulting mixture is opaque blue-black. 2 ml of 30 % hydrogen peroxide is added<br>
using a syringe and the solution is left under stirring. The colour progressively<br>
25 changes to orange passing through khaki green tones. A light precipitate is then<br>
distinguished in a dark orange solution. In parallel, 1.7254 g of oxalic acid was<br>
dissolved in 20 ml of water and this solution is added to the first, which remained at<br>
70ºC, without a change of colour or appearance being observed. The pH of the<br>
solution is then 3 to 4. The mixture is left to mature for another 30 minutes, then it is<br>
30 dried in the oven for 12 hours at 110°C. The amorphous precursor is then<br>
precaicinated under air (15 ml/min/g) at 300°C, for 4 hours, then calcinated under<br>
nitrogen flow (15 ml/min/g) for 2 hours at 600CC. in this way catalyst 5 is obtained.<br>

(0.0528 mol Sb) of Sb2O3 are added to the limpid solution (small addition of water in<br>
order to rinse the funnel), then 61.8 g of ammonium heptamolybdate (AHM, 03501<br>
moles of Mo) are added. After the addition of AHM, the reactor is flushed with<br>
nitrogen, the reaction is stirred continuously, at reflux, for 4 hours. Gradually a blue-<br>
10     black solution is obtained.<br>
Solution B<br>
6 g (0.0530 mol) of an aqueous solution of H2O2 at 30 wt-% is then added slowly<br>
(approximately 30 minutes). In order to obtain a limpid orange solution, two drops of<br>
pure oxygenated water are added.<br>
15     Solution C<br>
Then 49.1 g of Ludox® AS40 silica (nSi = 0.327 mole) is added in one go, and the<br>
solution becomes slightly cloudy. The solution formed is called solution C<br>
Solution D<br>
A solution D is prepared at the same time as solution A. 100 g of distilled water, 5.9 g<br>
20 of niobic acid marketed by the Brazilian company CBMM i.e. nnb = 0.035 mol, and<br>
13.2 g of Prolabo oxalic acid i.e. noxaiatc = 0.105 mole is introduced into a 500 ml<br>
beaker. The mixture is heated at 60°C under stirring for 2 hours, then taken to 30ºC<br>
The solution is then centrifuged at 6200 r.p.in. for 12 minutes in order to obtain a<br>
limpid solution.<br>
25              Solution D is added to solution C in one go- A fluid gel is obtained which is orange<br>
then yellow. Stining is continued for 30 minutes under nitiogen flow, under reflux.<br>
Staee 2: Drying<br>
The gel is then dried in a ventilated oven overnight, on plates covered with Teflon®,<br>
at 130ºC. 863 g of dry precursor are recovered. The precursor is in the form of sheets,<br>
30     black on the top and a thin green film underneath- In this way a precursor is obtained.<br>
Staze 3: Beat treatment<br>
30 g of precursor obtained previously are precalcinated at 305°C with an air flow rate<br>
of 18.7 ml/min/g.<br><br><br><br>
R:/Brevels/20200/20293US-22/02/05<br><br>
After calcination, at 601°C under a nitrogen flow rate of 49.8 ml/min/g, a weight of<br>
calcinated solid of 24.6 g is obtained. This catalyst is called CATALYST A,<br>

The process is carried out as in Example 8, but with;<br>
- 3075 g (0.2630 mole of V} of ammonium metavanadate (MVA);<br>
-19.25 g (0.1321 mole of Sb) of Sb2O3;<br>
-154.5 g (0.8753 mole of Mo) of ammonium heptatnolybdate (AHM);<br>
10           -15.25 g (0 .1 46 mol) of an aqueous sol ution o fH2O2 at 3 0 wt -%;<br>
-  100 g of Ludox® AS40 silica (nsi, = 0.6667 mole);<br>
-  14.75 g of CBMM niobic acid i.e. nNb = 0.088 mole; and<br>
- 33-0 g of Prolabo® oxalic acid i.e. noxalate = 0262 mol.<br>
259 g of dry precursor are recovered. The precursor is in the form of black sheets on<br>
15     the top and thin yellow-green films underneath.<br>
25 g of this precursor are precalcinated at 321°C under static air for 4 hours, then<br>
calcinated at 598°C at a flow rate of nitrogen of 51.85 ml/min/g for 2 hours.<br>
A weight of 20.30 g of calcinated solid is obtained. This catalyst is called catalyst B,<br>
Example 10<br>

Synthesis of the precursor<br>
A 10 litre reactor with a double jacket is used. The diagram of the installation is given<br>
in Figure 2. The installation comprises the reactor with a double jacket 1, equipped<br>
with a draw off 2 and an oil bath 3 thermostatically controlled at 140°C (so that the<br>
25 temperature inside the reactor is approximately 99°C), a stirrer 4 designed to operate<br>
at 125 r.p.in,, an inlet 5 for the reagents, an inlet 6 for the nitrogen, a cooler 7<br>
connected to a vent 8.<br>
2600 % of water, 123 g of ammonium metavanadate (1.052 mole), 77 g of antimony<br>
oxide (0.528 mol), and 618 g of ammonium heptamolybdate (3.501 mole) is<br>
30     introduced cold under stirring and under nitrogen flow. After the start of heating, the<br>
mixture quickly changes to green, then to blue-black.<br>
After stabilisation of the internal temperature of the reactor (T = 99°C), 4 hours of<br>
stirring of the solution allow it to be perfectly homogeneous. 60 g of oxygenated<br><br><br>
R:/Brevels/20200/20293US-22/02/05<br><br>
20<br>
water dilated in 500 g of water are added so as to obtain a limpid orange solution<br>
(oxidation of all the cations present).<br>
30 minutes laterT 491 g (3.27 mole) of colloidal silica is introduced as well as a<br>
solution of niobic acid (59 g, 0.5 mol) and oxalic acid (132 g, 1.05 mol) previously<br>
5     heated for two hours and centriiuged (12 minutes at 6200 r.p .in.).<br>
Another 30 minutes later, the heating is stopped but stirring is continued overnight in<br>
order to retain a homogeneous solution. The mixture has taken on a yellow colouring<br>
and the consistence of a gel.<br>
Forming<br>
10     A laboratory atomizer (ATSELAB® by Sodeva) is used.<br>
The atomization takes place in an air atmosphere.<br>
The working parameters are globally:<br>
- flow rate of nitrogen of the order of 40 m3/h;<br>
- flow rate of slurry of the order of 2600 g/h;<br>
15             - inlet temperature of the gas; 290°C;<br>
- outlet temperature of the gas: 134°C.<br>
The increase in the rate of dry material in the slurry is carried out in a rotary<br>
evaporator to 30.8 wt.-%.<br>
A fraction comprised between 40 and 160 µm is recovered in the chamber which<br>
20     corresponds to the precursor.<br>
Heat treatment<br>
26.6 g of the fraction obtained previously, i.e. the precursor, are precalcinated foe 4<br>
hours at 316QC under static air in order to produce a precalcinated solid.<br>
The precalcinated solid is then calcinated for 2 hours at 598° C under a flow rate of<br>
2 5     nitrogen o f 49.83 mVg/min and thus produces 21 g of catalyst called CATALYST C.<br>
Example tl<br>
Catalyst tests<br>
a) Apparatus<br>
In order to simulate the process according to the invention, simulations were<br>
30     carried out in the laboratory in a laboratory fixed bed reactor, by generating propane<br>
pulses and oxygen pulses.<br>
The following are loaded from the bottom to the top of a vertical reactor with<br>
cylindrical shape and made of pyrex;<br><br><br>
R:/Brevels/20200/20293US-22/02/05<br><br>
                                                                            21<br>
-     a first height of 2 ml of silicon carbide in the form of particles of 0,125 mm in<br>
diameter,<br>
-     a second height of 5.00 g of catalyst in the form of particles of 0.02 to 1 mm<br>
diluted with 10 ml of silicon carbide in the form of particles of 0.125 mm in<br>
5                diameter,<br>
-     a third height of 2 ml of silicon carbide in the form of particles of 0.125 mm in<br>
diameter, and<br>
-     a fourth height of silicon carbide in the form of particles of 1.19 mm in<br>
diameter, so as to fill all of the reactor.<br>
10     b\ Tests of catalyst A<br>
I) Operating process<br>
The reactor is heated to 250°C and the vaporizer to 20G'C- The electric<br>
initiation of the water pump is initiated.<br>
Once the reactor and the vaporizer have reached the temperatures given above,<br>
15     the water pump is actuated and the reactor temperature is raised to 400ºC and it is left<br>
for 30 minutes so that the hot point is stabilized.<br>
Then, oxygen is introduced in 10 pulses of 23 seconds each in order to<br>
sufficiently oxidize the catalyst. The catalyst is considered to be totally oxidized<br>
when the temperature of the hot spot has stabilized, i.e, when there is no more<br>
20 exothermal activity due to the reaction (by monitoring the catalyst temperature<br>
measured using a thermocouple placed in the catalyst bed, the fluctuations in<br>
temperature can be seen as a function of the pulses).<br>
Then the measurements relating to the production of acrylic acid itself can be<br>
carried out.<br>
25             For each balance, liquid samples are taken.   Gas samples are also taken using<br>
gas bags, each sample representing a certain number of cycles.<br>
-    Each small gas-washing bottle (with a 25 ml capacity and filled with 20 ml of<br>
water) is equipped with a gas bag, and when the bottle is connected to the outlet of the<br>
reactor (as soon as the liquid bubbles), the bag is open and the chronometer is started.<br>
30             In order to verify the oxidation state of the catalyst, another series of ten 23-<br>
second puises of oxygen is carried out. It shows that the oxidation state of the solid<br>
has been maintained during the balancing.<br>
The liquid effluents are analyzed on a HP 6890 chromatograph, after having<br>
carried out a specific calibration.<br>
R:/Brevels/20200/20293US-22/02/05<br><br>
                                  22<br>
                 The gases are analyzed during the balancing on a Chrompack micro-GC<br>
chromatograph.<br>
An assay of the acidity is carried out on each bottle, in order to determine the<br>
exact number of moles of acid produced during each microbalancing and to validate<br>
5     the chromatographic analyses,<br>
i) Test TA1<br>
This is a test of the oxidation of propane carried out in the absence of molecular<br>
oxygen.   This test was carried out with partial pressures of propane and oxygen<br>
corresponding to the following ratios:<br>
10             For the ox idation: propane/He-Kr/H2O: 10/45/45<br>
For the regeneration: O/He-Kr/H3O: 20/45/45, with a flow rate of He-Kr of<br>
4.262 Nl/h (Nl/h = normal litres per hour), i.e. litres/h at 0 C and at atmospheric<br>
pressure) and at a temperature of 400 C.<br>
In this test, aredox balance is composed of 60 cycles. A redox cycle represents'.<br>
15              -12.2 seconds of propane in a continuous flow of helium-krypton/water,<br>
- 45 seconds of continuous flow of helium-krypton/water,<br>
- 20 seconds of oxygen in a continuous flow of helium-fcrypton/water,<br>
- 45 seconds of continuous flow of helium-krypton/water.<br>
For each balance, 4 liquid samples are carried out, each representing 15 cycles and 4<br>
20     gas samples using gas bags, each sample representing 15 cycles.<br>
ii) Test TA2<br>
This is also a test of the oxidation of propane carried out in the absence of molecular<br>
oxygen.<br>
In this test, the duration of the propane pulse (as well as that of the oxygen) is<br>
25     modified during the balance thus allowing observation of the behavior of the catalyst<br>
when in a more or less rich redox mixture. The duration of the oxygen pulse is still<br>
twice as great as that of propane, and with a double flow rate, in order to keep the<br>
catalyst oxidized.<br>
The partial pressures of propane and oxygen remain the same as in the preceding<br>
30     test TA1:<br>
For the oxidation: propane/He-Kr/H2O: 10/45/45<br>
For the regeneration: O2/He-Kr/H2O; 20/45/45, with a flow rate of He-Kr of<br>
4.262 Nl/h at a temperature of 400 C.<br><br><br>
R:/Brevels/20200/20293US-22/02/05<br><br>
                                     23<br>
                 In this example of 60 cycles the balance is divided into six microbalances in the<br>
following way;<br>
2 first microbalances of 7 and 8 cycles:<br>
10 seconds of propane in a flow of He-Kr/H2O,<br>
5     45 seconds under He-Kr,<br>
20 seconds of O2 in a flow of He-Kr,<br>
45 seconds under He-Kr.<br>
3rd microbalance of 15 cycles:<br>
5 seconds of propane in a flow of He-Kr/H2O,<br>
10     50 seconds under He-Kr,<br>
10 seconds of O^ in a flow of He-Kr,<br>
55 seconds under He-Kr.<br>
4® microbalance of 8 cycles:<br>
2 seconds of propane in a flow of He-Kr/H2O,<br>
15     50 seconds under He-Ki,<br>
4 seconds of O3 in a flow of He-Kr,<br>
55 seconds under He-Kr.<br>
5th microbalance of 8 cycles:<br>
20 seconds of propane in a flow of He-Kr/H2O,<br>
20     45 seconds under He-Kr,<br>
40 seconds of O2 in a flow of He-Kr,<br>
45 seconds under He-Kr.<br>
6th microbalance of 7 cycles:<br>
30 seconds of propane in a flow of He-Kr/H2O,<br>
25     45 seconds tinder He-Kr,<br>
60 seconds of O2 in a flow of He-Kr,<br>
45 seconds under He-Kr.<br>
The durations of the pulses which have just been given are theoretical<br>
iii)Test TA3<br>
30             In this test the oxidation of propane is carried out in the presence of molecular<br>
oxygen, at 400 C.<br>
The duration of the injection of oxygen in the propane pulse is varied by<br>
preserving the constant pressures of propane and of oxygen.<br>
The balance of 40 cycles in this case is broken down as follows:<br><br>
R:/Brevels/20200/20293US-22/02/05<br><br>
 10 cycles of 30 s of propane + 5 s of O2 (the oxygen being injected at the start of the<br>
injection of propane), with the proportions propane/O2/He-Kr/H2O of 30/30/45/45,<br>
with a flow of helium-krypton of 4.262 Nl/h.<br>
Then there is an intermediate pulse composed only of the flow of carrier gas He-<br>
5     KI/H2O of 60 s, then an oxygen pulse with the proportions O2/He-Kr/H2O of<br>
20/45/45, for 60 s and another intermediate pulse of He-Kr/H2O of 60 s.<br>
Then there in another series of 10 cycles of 30 s of propane + 10 s of oxygen,<br>
with the proportions propane/O2/He-Kr/H2Oof 30/30/45/45, with a flow of helium-<br>
krypton of 4.262 Nl/h. Then there is an intermediate pulse composed only of the flow<br>
10     of carrier gas He-Kr/H2O of 60s, then an oxygen pulse with the proportions o2/He-<br>
Kr/H2O =20/45/45, for 60 s and another intermediate pulse of He-Kr/H2O of 60 s.<br>
Then, there is another series of 10 cycles of 30 s of propane + 15 s of O2, with<br>
the proportions propane/O2/He-Kr/H2O of 30/30/45/45, with a flow of helium-<br>
kiypton of 4.262 Nl/h. Then there is an intermediate pulse composed only of the flow<br>
15     of carrier gas He-Kr/H2O of 60 s, then an oxygen pulse with the proportions O2He-<br>
Kr/H2O = 20/45/45, for 60 s and another intermediate pulse of He-Kr/H2O of 60 s.<br>
Then, there is another series of 10 cycles of 30 s of propane + 20 s of O2, with<br>
the proportions propane/O2/He-Kr/H2O of 30/30/45/45, with a flow of helium-<br>
krypton of 4.262 Nl/h. Then there is an intermediate pulse composed only of the flow<br>
20     of carrier gas He-Kr/H2O of 60 s, then an oxygen pulse with the proportions 02/He-<br>
Kr/H2O of 20/45/45, for 60 s and another intermediate pulse of He-Kr/H2O of 60 s.<br>
As in the test TA2, the durations of the pulses which have just been given are<br>
theoretical.<br>
2) Results<br>
25             The results of the tests TA1, TA2 and TA3 are shown in the tables below.<br>

                                   27<br>
                In test TA3, where the operation takes place in the presence of molecular<br>
             oxygen, it is noted that the yields of acid acrylic increase much more quickly, as a<br>
function of the addition of oxygen in the propane pulse, than the yields in COx and<br>
acetic acid.  A substantial gain in acrylic acid selectivity results.  A lowering of the<br>
5     selectivity of hydration products is also observed (acetone, propionic acid).<br>
The addition of oxygen also leads to a gain in conversion ratio which thus<br>
changes from 1107 to 803 kg/kg.<br>
c) Tests of catalyst B<br>
1) Operating process<br>
10              The apparatus used is the one described in Example 11a).<br>
i) Tests TB t and TB2<br>
Catalyst B is tested under the same conditions and in the same way as for test<br>
TA1.<br>
ii) Test TB3<br>
15           Catalyst B is tested under the same conditions and in the same way as for test TA3<br>
(presence of molecular oxygen).<br>
iii) Tests TB4 to TB6<br>
In the case of test TB4, catalyst B is tested under the same conditions and in the<br>
same way as for test TA2, at 420 C.<br>
20           In the case of tests TBS and TB6, there is simply modification of the content of<br>
propane during the oxidation and of oxygen during the regeneration.<br>
iv) Tests TB7<br>
in this test, the oxidation of propane is carried out in the presence of molecular<br>
oxygen, at 420 C.<br>
25           The duration of the injection of oxygen in the propane pulse is varied by keeping<br>
the pressures of propane and of oxygen constant.<br>
The oxygen is injected at the end of the propane pulse to see if there is an<br>
influence on the catalytic performances compared to an injection at the start of the<br>
pulse.<br>
30           The balance of 40 cycles is broken down as follows:<br>
10 cycles of 30 s of propane + 20 s of O2 (the oxygen being injected at the end of the<br>
propane pulse), with the proportions propane/O2/He-Kr/H2O of 30/30/45/45, with a<br>
flow of helium-krypton of 4.27 Nl/h.<br>
R:/Brevels/20200/20293US-22/02/05<br><br>
                Then there is an intermediate pulse composed only of the flow of carrier gas He-<br>
Kr/H2O of 60 s, then a pulse of O2 with the proportions O2/He-Kr/H2O = 20/45/45,<br>
for 60 s and another pulse of carrier gas of 60 s.<br>
Then, there is another series of 10 cycles of 30 s of propane + 15 s of oxygen,<br>
5     with the proportions propane/Oj/He-Kr/H^0 of 30/30/45/45, with a flow of helium-<br>
krypton of 4.27 Nl/h. Then there is an intermediate pulse composed only of the flow<br>
of carrier gas He-Kr/H2O of 60 s, then an oxygen pulse with the proportions O2/He-<br>
Kr/H2O = 20/45/45, for 60 s and another intermediate pulse of carrier gas of 60 s.<br>
Then, there is another series of 10 cycles of 30 s of propane + 10 s of O2, with the<br>
10     proportions propane/O2/He-Kr/H2Oof 30/30/45/45, with a flow of helium-krypton of<br>
4.27 Nl/h. Then there is an intermediate pulse composed only of the flow of carrier<br>
gas He-Kr/H2O of 60 s, then a pulse of O2 with the proportions O2/He-Kr/H2O =<br>
20/45/45, for 60 s and another intermediate pulse of carrier gas of 60 s.<br>
Then, there is another series of 10 cycles of 30 s of propane + 5 s of O2, with the<br>
15     proportions propaneO2/He-Kr/H2O of 30/30/45/45, with a flow of helium-krypton of<br>
4,27 Nl/h. Then there is an intermediate pulse composed only of the flow of carrier<br>
gas He-Kr/H2O of 60 s, then a pulse of O2 with the proportions O2/He-Kr/H2O=<br>
20/45/45, for 60 s and another intermediate pulse of carrier gas of 60 s,<br>
V) Tests TB8<br>
20           In this test, there is also oxidation of the propane in the presence of molecular<br>
oxygen.<br>
There is comparison of the effect of the injection of oxygen at the end and at the start<br>
of the propane pulse by keeping constant pressures of propane and of oxygen but also<br>
a constant duration of injection of oxygen in the propane pulse.<br>
25           The balance of 40 cycles is broken down as follows:<br>
10 cycles of 30 s of propane + 20 s of O2 (the oxygen being injected at the end of the<br>
propane pulse), with the proportions propane/O2/He-Kr/H2O of 30/30/45/45, with a<br>
flow of helium-krypton of 4.27 Nl/h. Then there is an intermediate pulse composed<br>
only of the flow of carrier gas He-Kr/H2O of 60 s, then an intermediate pulse of O2<br>
30     with the proportions O2/He-Kr/H2O = 20/45/45, for 60 s and another intermediate<br>
pulse of carrier gas of 60 s.<br>
Then, there is another series of 10 cycles of 30 s of propane + 20 s of oxygen (O2<br>
being injected at the end of the propane pulse), with the proportions propane/O2/He-<br>
Kr/H2O of 30/30/45/45, with a flow of helium-krypton of 4.27 Nl/h. Then there is an<br>
R:/Brevels/20200/20293US-22/02/05<br><br>
                                 29<br>
 intermediate pulse composed only of the flow of carrier gas He-Kr/H2O of 60 sf then<br>
an intermediate pulse of oxygen with the proportions O2/He-Kr/H2O =20/45/45, for<br>
60 s and another intermediate pulse of carrier gas of 60 s.<br>
10 cycles of 30 s of propane + 20 s of 0; (the oxygen being injected at the start of<br>
5 the propane pulse), with the proportions propane/O2/He-Kr/H2O of 30/30/45/45, with<br>
a flow of helium-krypton of 4.27 Nl/h. Then, there is an intermediate pulse composed<br>
only of the flow of carrier gas He-Kr/H2O of 60 s, then, an intermediate pulse of O2<br>
with the proportions O2/He-Kr/H2O = 20/45/45, for 60 s and another intermediate<br>
pulse of carrier gas of 60 s.<br>
10           Then, there is another series of 10 cycles of 30 s of propane + 20 s of O2 (the<br>
oxygen being injected at the start of the propane pulse), with the proportions<br>
propane/O2/He-Kr/H2O of 30/30/45/45, with a flow of helium-krypton of 4.27 Nl/h.<br>
Then, there is an intermediate pulse composed only of the flow of carrier gas He-<br>
Kr/H2O of 60 s, then an intermediate pulse of O2 with the proportions O2/He-Kr/H2O<br>
15     =20/45/45, for 60 s and another intermediate pulse of carrier gas of 60 s.<br>

A better conversion is observed at 420 C than at 400 C.    The acrylic acid<br>
selectivity changes from 57.4% to 52.2% when the temperature is modified. A clear<br>
decrease (division by two) of the selectivityes of acetone and propionic acid is<br>
5     observed.<br>
The fact of increasing the temperature allows the conversion to be increased and<br>
the formation of hydration products as well as the conversion ratio to be decreased.<br>
The conversion ratio changes from 3300 to 2900 kg/kg by changing from 400 to<br>
420 C<br>
10     b) Tests TB4 to TB6<br>
The results appear in the two tables below.<br>
It is observed that the increase in the partiai pressure of propane and/or of the duration<br>
of the injection of propane leads to a decrease in the yield of acrylic acid, but to the<br>
same yield of hydration products. The selectivities of hydration products therefore<br>
15 increase with the reduction of the catalyst. The selectivities of acrolein and propylene<br>
also increase with the reduction of the catalyst. The reduced catalyst becomes less<br>
active.<br>

C) Tests TB3.TB7 and TB8<br>
The results appear in the three tables below.<br>
It is observed that the addition of molecular oxygen allows a clear decrease in<br>
the conversion ratio while maintaining a good selectivity.   There is a change from<br>
5     2904 kg of catalyst/kg of converted propane for a standard test to 1019 kg of<br>
catalyst/kg of converted propane for a test with variation of pulse duration (30 s of<br>
propane with propane or oxygen/He-Kr/H2O: 30 or 30/45/45).  With the addition of<br>
oxygen it is from 460 to 500 kg of catalyst/kg of converted propane-<br>
It is advantageous to add oxygen which allows not only a further decrease of the<br>
10     conversion ratio, but also an increase in the acrylic acid selectivities. It is observed<br>
that the catalyst, even reduced, can remain dehydrogenating.<br>

        d) Tests of catalyst C<br>
1) Operating process<br>
The apparatus used is that described in Example 11 a).<br>
i) Test TC1<br>
5     Catalyst C is tested in the same way as for test TA1. The conditions are the same with<br>
the exception of the flow rate of He-Kr which is 4.27 Nl/h and the temperature of the<br>
test which is 420 C.<br>
ii) Tests TC2 to TC4<br>
In the case of test TC2. the catalyst C is tested under the same conditions and in the same<br>
10     way as for test TA2. In the case of tests TC 3 and TC4. there is simply modification of the<br>
content of propane during the oxidation and of oxygen during the regeneration.<br>
These three tests were carried out at 420 C and with a flow rate of He-Kr of 4.27 Nl/h.<br>
iii) Test TC5<br>
Catalyst C is tested in the same way as for test TA3 (presence of molecular oxygen).<br>
15     The conditions are also identical except for the flow rate of He-Kr which is now 4.27<br>
Nl/h. The temperature is 420 G<br>
iv) Test TC6<br>
Catalyst C is tested in the same way as for test TB7. The conditions are identical.<br>
v) Test TC7<br>
20     Catalyst C is tested in the same way as for test TBS. The conditions are identical except Ibr<br>
the flow rate of He-Kr which is 4.27 Nl/h and the temperature of the test which is 420 C.<br>
2) Results<br>
a) Tests TC1 to TC4<br>
The results are shown in the two tables below.<br>
25     It is observed. as for catalyst B, that the selectivity of propionic acid and acetone<br>
increases with the partial pressure of propane. i.e. the more the catalyst is reduced the<br>
less selective it is.<br>
The Knetics of initial oxygen consumption is very fast. then appears to develop as a<br>
function of the time.<br>

Example 12<br>
Preparation of the precursor of a catalyst of formula: Mo1V0.3Sb0.15Nb0.1Si0,. 76Ox<br>
Stage 1: dissolution-precipitation<br>
Solution A<br>
5     The assembly illustrated in Figure 2 is used which comprises a 1 litre reactor of the<br>
SVL type equipped with a stiner connected to a motor and a water cooler containing<br>
Raschig rings.<br>
A nitrogen supply is installed on the reactor and a gas washing bottle is placed at the<br>
outlet of the cooler. The heating is ensured by a thermostatically controlled oil bath.<br>
10     12.3 g of ammonium metavanade (AMV) (i.e. 0.1052 mole of vanadium) are placed<br>
in solution in 260ml of demineralised water. in the reactor. under stirring.  A yellow<br>
solution is obtained. 7.7g of Sb2O3 (i.e. 0.0528 mole of antimony) are added to the<br>
limpid solution. then 61.8 g of ammonium heptamolybdate (AHM) (i.e. 0.3501 mole<br>
of molybdenum) are added.  After the addition of AHM. the reactor is placed under<br>
15     nitrogen flow. the reaction is maintained under stilting. at reflux. for 4 hours. A black<br>
solution is gradually obtained; the reaction is considered lo be complete after 1 hour.<br>
The solution obtained is called solution A.<br>
Solution B<br>
6.1g (0.0532 mole) of an aqueous solution of H2O2 at 30% by weight is dissolved in<br>
20     98 g of water. and are then added to solution A over 2 to 3 minutes.  The solution<br>
becomes limpid orange in 4-5 minutes. Then 40 g of Ludox silica (0.2663 mole of Si)<br>
are added in one go and the solution becomes cloudy. The solution formed is called<br>
solution B.<br>
Solution C<br>
25     Solution C is prepared at the same time as solution A: 13.2 g (0.1047 mole) of oxalic<br>
acid and 5.9 g of niobic acid (i.e. 0.0351 mole of Nb) are dissolved under stirring at<br>
80 C. in 100 g of water. over 2 hours. This solution is then centrifuged at 6200 r.p.in.<br>
for 12 minutes. in order to obtain a limpid solution C<br>
Then. solution C is added to solution Bf in one go. A fluid gel is obtained which is<br>
30     orange then yellow. Stirring is continued for 30 minutes under nitrogen flow. under<br>
reflux.<br>
2) Stage 2: drying<br><br>
R:/Brevels/20200/20293US-22/02/05<br><br>
            The gel obtained previously is dried in a ventilated oven. on Teflon-covered plates.<br>
overnight. at 130 C 104.2 g of dry precursor are recovered. This precursor. hereafter<br>
called PI, is in the form of sheets. black on the top with a green film underneath<br>

Precalcination and calcination of the precursors PJ to P15<br>
The precalcinations and the calcinations are carried out in combustion boats under<br>
flow of air and of nitrogen respectively. in steel capacitors.   These capacitors are<br>
5     directly installed in muffle furnaces and the air or nitrogen is supplied via the flue.<br>
An internal thermometer well allows precise monitoring of the temperature.   The<br>
cover prevents air returning towards the catalyst (see Figure 3)-<br>
The precursors P1 to P15 obtained in Examples 12 and 13 arc prccalcinated at 300 C.<br>
for 4 hours. under air flow. then calcinated at 600 C, for 2 hours under nitrogen flow<br>
10     of 50 ml/mn/g in a muffle furnace. The calcinations<br>
The following conditions for heat treatment of the precursors are studied:<br>
- calciner;<br>
- flow rate of precalcination air in ml/min/g;<br>
- calcination temperature variation gradient in  C/min.<br>
15     These conditions are shown in Table 15 below.<br>

Example 15<br>
Tests of the catalysts obtained<br>
a) Apparatus<br>
In order to simulate the process according to the invention. simulations were<br>
carried out in the laboratory in a laboratory fixed bed reactor.<br>
The following are therefore loaded from the bottom to the top of a vertical reactor<br>
with cylindrical shape and made of pyrex:<br>
R:/Brevels/20200/20293US-22/02/05<br><br>
49<br>
-     a first height of 1 ml of silicon carbide in the form of particles of 0.125 mm in<br>
diameter.<br>
-     a second height of 8 g of catalyst in the form of particles of 0.02 to 1 mm<br>
diluted with 10 ml of silicon carbide in the form of particles of 0.125 mm in<br>
5                 diameter.<br>
     a third height of 1 ml of silicon carbide in the form of particles of 0.125 mm in<br>
diameter. and<br>
-     a fourth height of silicon carbide in the form of particles of 1.19 mm in<br>
diameter. so as to fill all of the reactor.<br>
10<br>
b) Test conditions<br>
The catalyst is simultaneously supplied with propane and with oxygen.   The<br>
helium acts as diluent gas and water is vaporized in the gaseous flow.<br>
The catalysts are tested at 380 C, 390 C and 400 C with a ratio propane/O2/He-<br>
15     Kr/H20 of 10/10/45/45. The total flow rate of the gaseous flow rises to 8.65 Nl/h.<br>
The reactor is placed in an isothermal furnace. It is supplied with propane.<br>
oxygen and helium by mass flow meters. An HPLC pump and a vaporizer ensure the<br>
production of vapour.<br>
Thermocouples are placed in the furnace to allow their regulation. and in the reactor<br>
20     to measure the '"hot spot". i.e. the highest temperature in the catalyst bed.<br>
c) Results of the tests<br>
Only the results of the tests carried out at 400 C are given.    It is at this<br>
temperature that it was observed that the best results were generally obtained.<br>
The results of the tests are recorded in Tables 16 and 17 below in which the yields are<br>
25 only calculated on the basis of the routine chromatographic analyses. The selectivities<br>
are calcuiated as being the yield of a given product over the sum of the yields of<br>
products.<br>
The carbon balances are used to ensure the homogeneity of the data.   They are<br>
considered to be acceptable for values comprises between 95 and 105 %.<br>
30 The yield calculations are based on the krypton content of the gas. Measurement of<br>
the flow rate of dry gas at the outlet of the reactor allows calculations to he made<br>
based on this flow rate of gas. The yield calculations can thus be validated.<br>
R:/Brevels/20200/20293US-22/02/05<br><br>

The yields and selectivities of each of the products assayed are given. as well as the<br>
yield of acid. obtained by assay with 0.1N soda. This is a pseudo-yield obtained<br>
supposing that all the acids formed have 3 carbon atoms.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Example 16<br>
Precursors P16 of the catalyst of formula Mo1V0.3Sb0.15Nb0.1Si0.76Ox are prepared<br>
according to the operating process given in Example 12.<br>
5           From these precursors P16. a series of catalysts is prepared which are tested.<br>
The precalculation and calcination conditions of the precursor PI 6 are shown in<br>
Tables 18 and 19 below.<br>
1) Stage 1: dissolution.precipitation<br>
Solution A<br>
10           The assembly illustrated in Figure 2 is used which comprises a 1 litre reactor of<br>
the SVL type equipped with a stirrer connected to a motor and a water cooler<br>
containing Raschig rings. A nitrogen supply is installed on the reactor and a gas<br>
washing bottle is placed at the outlet of the cooler. The healing is ensured by a<br>
thermostatically controlled oil bath.<br>
15      30.75g of ammonium metavanade (AMV) (i.e. 0.2629 mole of vanadium) is placed in<br>
solution in 650 ml of dematerialized water. in the reactor. under stirring.<br>
A yellow solution is obtained.  19.25 g of Sb2Os (i.e. 0.1321 mole of antimony) are<br>
added. with 154.5 g of ammonium heptamolybdate (AHM) (i.e. 0.8753 mole of<br>
molybdenum) are added. After the addition. the reactor is placed under nitrogen flow.<br>
20     the reaction is maintained under stirring. al reflux. for 4 hours.   A black solution is<br>
gradually obtained; the reaction is considered to be complete after 1 hour.<br>
The solution obtained is called solution A.<br>
Solution B<br>
15.25 g (0.1346 mole) of an aqueous solution of H2O2 30% by weight is dissolved<br>
25 in 90 g of water. and is then added to solution A over 5 minutes. The solution<br>
becomes limpid orange in 4.5 minutes. Then 100 g of Ludox AS 40® silica (0.6667<br>
mole of Si) is added in one go and the solution becomes slightly cloudy. The solution<br>
formed iscalledsolution B.<br>
Solution C<br>
30           Solution C is prepared at the same time as solution A: 33.0 g (0.261 8 mole) of<br>
oxalic acid and 14.75 g of niobic acid (i.e. 0.0877 mole of Mb) are dissolved under<br>
Stirring at 66 C. in 250 g of water. Over 2 hours. This solution is then centrifuged at<br>
6200 r.p.m. for 12 minutes. in order to obtain a limpid solution C.<br>
R:/Brevels/20200/20293US.22/02/05<br><br>
54<br>
Then. solution C is added to solution B, in one go. A fluid gel is obtained which is<br>
orange then yellow. Stirring is continued for 30 minutes under nitrogen flow. under<br>
reflux.<br>
21 Stage 2: drying<br>
5                The gel obtained previously is dried in a ventilated oven. on Teflon.covered<br>
plates. overnight. at 130 C 259 g of dry precursor are recovered. This precursor is in<br>
the form of sheets. black on the top with a green film underneath.<br>
Thus the precursor is obtained which is hereafter called P16.<br>
Table 18 shows the yields of carbon (TTUc). with TTGC =ΣTTUC and TTG02 .<br>
10     ΣTTU02. the acidities measured by assay with soda. the carbon and oxygen balances.<br>
