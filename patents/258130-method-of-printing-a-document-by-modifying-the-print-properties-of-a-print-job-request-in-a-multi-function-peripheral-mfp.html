				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention in general relates to the printer or multifunction peripherals. This invention further relates to the properties such as quality, Priority and other properties which can be decided at the Printer, based on the previous log report stores in the Printer or MFP (With Print Facility). This invention further relates to document print properties at the run time. More specifically this invention relates to a method and system for deciding the run time print properties and applying them on the submitted job, decision on those are based on the origin of Job and previous usages of the submitted job user.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
There is considerable amount of work done in this field since deciding the properties of a job is a hot field in printer domain. Following is the patent and related literature that is already available in this domain.<br>
The US patent number 20040163049 teaches a very generic system that can decide the print properties of the document based on the print template. To achieve the object, the related art is capable of registering the print settings for a document being currently edited as template information and reading the registered template information as print settings for the document being currently edited or a new document. Thus, in this invention, the print settings for an existing document can be utilized as print settings for printing a document. More preferably, the contents of a registered template can be edited. Though the claim is deciding<br><br>
the print document based on the previous properties but there is no mention about how to change the properties of a job after submitting. More preferably it modifies the print setting by changing the print template.<br>
In short, the related art invention relates to a document processing method providing a function of making print settings for document data generated by a document processing program<br>
According to this invention, a document processing method wherein print settings for printing a document are changeable, the method comprises: a registration process for registering print settings for a document being edited as template information; and a reading process for reading the template information registered by the registration process as print settings for the document being edited or a new document.<br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
1.	The related art is more about the deciding the print properties at the time of submission of a job. Hence it is more like submitting a job in fixed format.<br>
2.	It decides the print properties based on the template. In order to change the properties of a print job, either editing the current or use another existing template is required.<br>
3.	This art doesn't decide the various print properties at the printer; all properties are static in this case.<br>
4.	Properties of print document are not depending on the user usage frequency.<br><br>
5.  Properties of the print are independent of the origin of job.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention describes a method and a system for determining the print properties for a print job in a shared printer or a Multi Function Peripheral (MFP). Various properties for a print job are dynamically determined by an MFP at the time of actual print out. These properties for the print job can include priority of the print job, quality of printing, paper sizes, etc. These properties are determined by the MFP using various known parameters about the print job. These parameters can include owner of the print job, point of origin of the print job, past usage profile of the owner, priority of the owner of the print job, etc. The MFP stores past usage profile of users that are used to determine the print properties of new print jobs. Print properties specified in the print job can be used to update the usage profile of the owner of the print job. If required, the print properties determined by the MFP can override the print properties originally specified in the print job. Hence, optimal print properties for the print job can be determined and implemented at the time of print out.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a system and method of that can decide the various properties of a submitted job at the time of printing based on the past usage.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a system and method of deciding the print properties based on the knowledge obtained by applying the knowledge<br><br>
discovering algorithms on the previous data.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a system and method of keeping the device up-to-date with the updating log report and knowledge after every job getting printed.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a system and methods, where the properties of a print document get decide at the run time not only at the time of submitting hence a better system in the case of network printing.<br>
Accordingly this invention explains a method for determining the print properties for a print job in a network printer or an MFP comprising the steps of:<br>
submitting a print job on the network printer;<br>
checking the priority of the user and past usage of the printer if dynamic<br>
setting/change of print properties is allowed;<br>
checking the properties of the submitted job;<br>
allowing the desired properties and rescheduling the print document, without<br>
any change in print properties and updating the user log data if the priority of<br>
the user is very high or usage is very low; and<br>
executing the entire print job without change in properties by taking rules from<br>
the past usage of printer by the user if it allow the desired properties and if the<br>
priority of the user is not high.<br><br>
The printer/MFP stores past usage profile of users that are used to determine the print properties of new print jobs. The print properties specified in the print job are used to update the usage profile of the owner of the print job. The print properties determined by the printer/MFP is adapted to override the print properties originally specified in the print job thereby determining and implementing optimal print properties for the print job at the time of print out.<br>
Accordingly this invention explains a system for determining the print properties for a print job in a network printer or an MFP comprising:<br>
means for submitting a print job on the network printer;<br>
means for checking the priority of the user and past usage of the printer if<br>
dynamic setting/change of print properties is allowed;<br>
means for checking the properties of the submitted job;<br>
means for allowing the desired properties and rescheduling the print document,<br>
without any change in print properties and updating the user log data if the<br>
priority of the user is very high or usage is very low; and<br>
means for executing the entire print job without change in properties by taking<br>
rules from the past usage of printer by the user if it allow the desired properties<br>
and if the priority of the user is not high.<br>
BREIF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is a flow chart which illustrates the various steps involved in the present invention.<br><br>
BREIF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The objective of the invention is to make the printing device usage more efficiently and effectively in a common environment, i.e. network environment. By using the current technique based on the origin of the job and prior usage by the job submitter, properties of the print can be decided. This is achieved by applying a method best suited for the document under consideration. The invention is aware of the drastically changing scenarios in today's world and hence allows the user to decide on adding any new criteria for making the decision on print properties.<br>
The working of the invention is based on the fact that the based on the prior usage and origin of the job, certain properties of a print document can be changed. Its apply the fuzzy logic or data mining algorithms on the previous stored data and based on that whenever a job is submitted for the printing, its manipulate and make the necessary changes in the printing properties.<br>
As soon as the user submits a Print job in the proposed system, system will check the origin and the past usage of the printer by the job submitter. If the properties of the document are required by using some known algorithms of data mining or fuzzy logic, it will make the necessary change in the print properties (some are mention above) and based on that perform the print operation. After printing the system will update the log report so that it can be used for the future decision.<br>
The invention is about deciding the print properties of the job, submitted to the printing device at the actual time of printing i.e. the properties of the print get<br><br>
changes based on the origin of the job and past usage of printer by the job submitter.<br>
Various steps are as follow:<br>
1.	Submit a Print job on network printer.<br>
2.	If dynamic setting/change of print properties is allow, Check the priority of the user and past usage of the printer.<br>
3.	Check the properties of the submitted job.<br>
4.	If the priority of the user is very high or usage is very low allows the desired properties, reschedule the print document, without any change in print properties and update the user log data.<br>
5.	If the priority of the user is not high and rules drawn from the past usage of printer by the user allow the desired properties, then the entire print job without change in properties. Otherwise make the change in the print properties based on the rules draws from the past usage. Change the properties of the job and reschedule. After printing update the log table.<br>
Example:<br>
Case 1: User Priority is very high or the past usage of the printer by the job submitter is very low.<br>
In this case the properties of the print will remain same what is set by the end user. Case 2: Print Properties are required to change i.e. feature is enabled:<br>
In this case two major factor to decide the print properties of a document are the user priority and past printer usage.<br><br>
If the user is a normal user that is the priority of the user is not very high (A simple Employee) the print properties will get changed based on the various rules drawn from the log table containing past usage of the user and system administrator setting. And in case if the user priority is very high (Manager) or usage is very low the print properties will remain unchanged.<br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
•	The system uses better method like fuzzy logic and data mining algorithms to decide the properties of print document, hence better utilization of printer resource is possible.<br>
•	The system decide the properties based on the past usage of the job submitter and as well from the origin of the job, hence waiting time as well as quality of print for the job submitted depend on the past usage by the submitter and origin of the job.<br>
•	It uses the origin of the job as one parameter to decide the print quality hence response time for the higher priority people is much faster then the normal system.<br>
•	Unlike the prior art, the system makes decide the properties of the printing job at the run time that is after submission and a better dynamic system compare to the related arts.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
