				<td>A PY -RICH IMMUNOSTIMULATORY NUCLEIC ACID<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Bacterial DNA, but not vertebrate DNA, has direct immunostimulatory effects on<br>
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in vitro (Krieg et al, 1995). Bacterial DNA has<br>
immune stimulatory effects to activate B cells and natural killer cells, but vertebrate DNA<br>
does not (Tokunaga, T., et al., 1988. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 79:682-686; Tokunaga, T., et al.,<br>
1984, JNCI 72:955-962; Messina, J.P., et al., 1991, J. Immunol. 147:1759-1764; and reviewed<br>
in Krieg, 1998, In: Applied Oligonucleotide Technology, C.A. Stein and A.M. Krieg, (Eds.),<br>
John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, NY, pp. 431-448). It is now understood that these<br>
immune stimulatory effects of bacterial DNA are a result of the presence of unmethylated<br>
CpG dinucleotides in particular base contexts (CpG motifs), which are common in bacterial<br>
DNA, but methylated and underrepresented (CpG suppression, 1/50 to 1/60) in vertebrate<br>
DNA (Krieg et al, 1995 Nature 374:546-549; Krieg, 1999 Biochim. Biophys. Acta 93321:1-<br>
10). The immune stimulatory effects of bacterial DNA can be mimicked with synthetic<br>
oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) containing these CpG motifs. It appears likely that the rapid<br>
immune activation in response to CpG DNA may have evolved as one component of the<br>
innate immune defense mechanisms that recognize structural patterns specific to microbial<br>
molecules.<br>
CpG ODN have highly stimulatory effects on human and murine leukocytes, inducing<br>
proliferation of almost all (&gt;95%) B cells and increases immunoglobulin (Ig) secretion;<br>
cytokine secretion; natural killer (NK) cell lytic activity and IFN-Î³ secretion; and activation of<br>
dendritic cells (DCs) and other antigen presenting cells to express costimulatory molecules<br>
and secrete cytokines, especially the Thl-like cytokines that are important in promoting the<br>
development of Thl-like T cell responses. B cell activation by CpG DNA is T cell<br>
independent and antigen non-specific. However, B cell activation by low concentrations of<br>
CpG DNA has strong synergy with signals delivered through the B cell antigen receptor for<br>
both B cell proliferation and Ig secretion (Krieg et al, 1995). This strong synergy between<br>
the B cell signaling pathways triggered through the B cell antigen receptor and by CpG DNA<br>
promotes antigen specific immune responses. In addition to its direct effects on B cells, CpG<br><br>
DNA also directly activates monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells to secrete a variety<br>
of cytokines, including high levels of IL-12 (Klinman et al, 1996; Halpem et al, 1996;<br>
Cowdery et al, 1996). These cytokines stimulate natural killer (NK) cells to secrete g-<br>
interferon (IFN-y) and have increased lytic activity (Klinman et al, 1996, supra; Cowdery et<br>
al, 1996, supra; Yamamoto et al, 1992; Ballas et al, 1996). Overall, CpG DNA induces a<br>
Thl like pattern of cytokine production dominated by IL-12 and IFN-y with little secretion of<br>
Th2 cytokines (Klinman et al, 1996). The strong direct effects (T cell independent) of CpG<br>
DNA on B cells, as well as the induction of cytokines which could have indirect effects on B-<br>
cells via T-help pathways, suggests utility of CpG DNA in the form of ODN as a vaccine<br>
adjuvant. (See PCT Patent Application Publication No.: WO98/40100.)<br>
These immune stimulatory effects of native phosphodiester backbone CpG ODN are<br>
highly CpG specific in that the effects are essentially abolished if the CpG motif is<br>
methylated, changed to a GpC, or otherwise eliminated or altered (Krieg et al, 1995 Nature<br>
374:546-549; Hartmann et al, 1999 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 96:9305-10). Phosphodiester<br>
CpG ODN can be formulated in lipids, alum, or other types of vehicles with depot properties<br>
or improved cell uptake in order to enhance the immune stimulatory effects (Yamamoto et al,<br>
1994 Microbiol. Immunol. 38:831-836; Gramzinski et al, 1998 Mol. Med. 4:109-118).<br>
In early studies, it was thought that the immune stimulatory CpG motif followed the<br>
formula purine-purine-CpG-pyrimidine-pyrimidine (Krieg et al, 1995 Nature 374:546-549;<br>
Pisetsky, 1996 J. Immunol. 156:421-423; Hacker et al., 1998 EMBO J. 17:6230-6240;<br>
Lipford et al, 1998 Trends in Microbiol. 6:496-500). However, it is now clear that mouse<br>
lymphocytes respond quite well to phosphodiester CpG motifs that do not follow this<br>
"formula" (Yi et al., 1998 J. Immunol. 160:5898-5906) and the same is true of human B cells<br>
and dendritic cells (Hartmann et al, 1999 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 96:9305-10; Liang, 1996<br>
J. Clin. Invest. 98:1119-1129).<br>
Several past investigators have looked at whether the nucleotide content of ODN may<br>
have effects independently of the sequence of the ODN. Interestingly, antisense ODN have<br>
been found to be generally enriched in the content of GG, CCC, CC, CAC, and CG<br>
sequences, while having reduced frequency of TT or TCC nucleotide sequences compared to<br>
what would be expected if base usage were random (Smetsers et al., 1996 Antisense Nucleic<br><br>
Acid Drug Develop. 6:63-67). This raised the possibility that the over-represented sequences<br>
may comprise preferred targeting elements for antisense oligonucleotides or visa versa. One<br>
reason to avoid the use of thymidine-rich ODN for antisense experiments is that degradation<br>
of the ODN by nucleases present in cells releases free thymidine which competes with 3H-<br>
thymidine which is frequently used in experiments to assess cell proliferation (Matson et al.,<br>
1992 Antisense Research and Development 2:325-330).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates in part to pyrimidine rich (Py-rich) and in some<br>
embodiments thymidine (T) rich imrnunostimulatory nucleic acids which do not require the<br>
presence of a CpG motif. The present invention also relates in part to the discovery that<br>
nucleic acids which contain a TG dinucleotide motif are also immunostimulatory. The<br>
invention is based in part on the unexpected finding that nucleic acid sequences which do not<br>
contain CpG motifs are immunostimulatory. It was discovered upon analysis of the immune<br>
stimulation properties of many nucleic acid sequences that these sequences may be Py-rich<br>
e.g., T-rich or that they may contain TG motifs. It was also discovered that these sequences<br>
preferentially activate non-rodent immune cells. The Py-rich and TG sequences are only<br>
minimally immunostimulatory with respect to rodent immune cells, compared to non-rodent<br>
immune cells. Thus, it is possible according to the methods of the invention to induce an<br>
immune response in a non-rodent subject by administering Py-rich or TG immunostimulatory<br>
nucleic acids. The Py-rich and TG immunostimulatory nucleic acids of the invention may<br>
optionally include CpG motifs. These findings have important implications for the clinical<br>
development of immunostimulatory CpG containing and non-CpG containing nucleic acids.<br><br>
In one aspect the invention is a pharmaceutical composition comprising an<br>
effective amount for stimulating aft immune response of isolated Py-rich or TG<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acids, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In other<br>
aspects the invention is a composition of matter, comprising an isolated Py-rich or TG<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acid. In other embodiments, the immunostimulatory nucleic<br>
acid may be T-rich. In still other embodiments, the immunostimulatory nucleic acid may<br>
be T-rich and also have at least one TG motif.<br>
Preferably the Py-rich nucleic acid is a T-rich nucleic acid. In some<br>
embodiments the T-rich immunostimulatory nucleic acid is a poly T nucleic acid<br>
comprising 5' TTTT 3'. In yet other embodiments the poly T nucleic acid comprises 5'<br>
X1 X2TTTTX3 X4 3' wherein X1, X2, X3 and X4 are nucleotides. In some embodiments<br>

consisting of TA, TG, TC, AT, AA, AG, AC, CT, CC, CA, CG, GT, GG, GA, and GC;<br>
and/or X3X4 is selected from the group consisting of TA, TG, TC, AT, AA, AG, AC,<br>
CT, CC, CA, CG, GT, GG, GA, and GC.<br>
The T-rich immunostimulatory nucleic acid may have only a single poly T motif<br>
or it may have a plurality of poly T nucleic acid motifs. In some embodiments the T-rich<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acid comprises at least 2, at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, at<br>
least 6, at least 7, or at least 8 T motifs. In other embodiments it comprises at least 2, at<br>

motifs and wherein at least 3 motifs each comprises at least 3 contiguous T nucleotide<br>
residues or the plurality of poly T motifs is at least 4 motifs and wherein the at least 4<br>
motifs each comprises at least 3 contiguous T nucleotide residues.<br>
In some cases the T-rich immunostimulatory nucleic acid may be free of poly T<br>
motifs but may rather comprise a nucleotide composition of greater than 25% T. In other<br>
embodiments the T-rich immunostimulatory nucleic acids have poly T motifs and also<br>
comprise a nucleotide composition of greater than 25% T. In preferred embodiments the<br>

than 35% T, greater than 40% T, greater than 50% T, greater than 60% T, greater than<br>
80% T, or greater than 90% T nucleotide residues. In important embodiments, the<br>
nucleic acid is at least 50% T.<br>

the entire length or some fragment thereof of the TG nucleic acid is a non-palindromic<br>
sequence, and in other embodiments it is a palindromic sequence.<br>
In some preferred embodiments, the TG nucleic acid is also T-rich.<br>
The Py-rich and TG immunostimulatory nucleic acids in some embodiments have<br>
a nucleotide backbone which includes at least one backbone modification, such as a<br>
phosphorothioate modification. The nucleotide backbone may be chimeric, or preferably<br>
the nucleotide backbone is entirely modified. In one preferred embodiment, the<br>

nucleic acid and an anti-microbial agent, wherein the Py-rich or TG nucleic acid is free<br>
of unmethylated CpG motifs. Preferably the anti-microbial agent is selected from the<br>
group consisting of an anti-viral agent, an anti-parasitic agent, an anti-bacterial agent<br>
and an anti-fungal agent.<br>
A composition of a sustained release device including a Py-rich and/or TG<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acid, wherein the Py-rich and/or TG nucleic acid is free of<br>
unmethylated CpG motifs, is provided according to another aspect of the invention.<br>
The invention also includes nutritional supplements of a Py-rich or TG<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acid in a delivery device selected from the group consisting<br>
of a capsule, a pill, and a sublingual tablet, wherein the Py-rich or TG nucleic acid is free<br>
of unmethylated CpG motifs.<br>
It should be understood that when it is useful to administer a Py-rich e.g., poly T,<br>
T-rich, C-rich, or TG oligonucleotide and a CpG oligonucleotide, it may also be<br>
desirable to co-administer a Py-rich or a TG oligonucleotide together with a physically<br>
separate CpG, Py-rich or TG oligonucleotide. Alternatively, the CpG, Py-rich or TG<br><br>
motif may be present on the same contiguous nucleic acid as the Py-rich or TG<br>
oligonucleotide. In yet a further embodiment, all or some combination of Py-rich, TG<br>
and CpG nucleic acids may be co-administered either on separate nucleic acids or in the<br>
same nucleic acid molecule. By co-administer it is intended that the nucleic acids be<br>
administered close enough in time to one another to achieve a combined benefit of both<br>
oligonucleotides, preferably more than the benefit achieved by administering each of the<br>
oligonucleotides alone at the same dose.<br>
CpG oligonucleotides have, in general, the formula 5'X1X2CGX3X43', wherein<br>
X1, X2, X3 and X4 are nucleotides and wherein at least the C of CpG is unmethylated.<br>
Preferred CpG oligonucleotides are 8-100 nucleotides in length and have modified back<br>
bones. Particular structures are detailed in the published PCT applications, U.S.<br>
applications and references cited herein, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein<br>
in their entirety. In one embodiment, the CpG oligonucleotide is free of poly T and TG<br>
motifs and is not T-rich.<br>
In other embodiments, the CpG oligonucleotide has a sequence selected from the<br>
group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 4, 14-16, 18-24,28,29, 33-46,49, 50, 52-56, 58,<br>

In another embodiment, the Py-rich or TG oligonucleotide is free of a CpG<br>
motifs. This embodiment of the invention also involves pharmaceutical compositions<br>
and kits which contain both a CpG oligonucleotide (which can be free of poly T and TG<br>
motifs and not be T-rich) and a Py-rich and/or TG oligonucleotide physically separate<br><br>
from the CpG oligonucleotide. The pharmaceutical preparations are in effective amounts<br>
and typically include pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, all as set forth in detail herein<br>
with respect to Py-rich and TG oligonucleotides. The kits include at least one container<br>
containing an oligonucleotide which is a Py-rich or TG oligonucleotide (or some<br>
combination thereof). The same container, or in other embodiments, a second container,<br>
may contain an oligonucleotide with a CpG motif, which may be tree of Py-rich and/or<br>
TG motifs. The kit also contains instructions for administering the oligonucleotides to a<br>
subject. The kits also may include a container containing a solvent or a diluent.<br>
In summary, as if fully recited herein, a CpG oligonucleotide physically separate<br>
from the Py-rich or TG oligonucleotide can be used together with the Py-rich or TG<br>
oligonucleotides in the methods, compositions and products described above.<br>
The invention relates in other aspects to immunostimulatory oligonucleotides<br>
which have chimeric backbones and which do not require the presence of a CpG motif.<br>
The invention is based in part on the discovery that nucleic acid sequences which did not<br>
contain CpG motifs were immunostimulatory, and that those which have chimeric<br>
backbones have unexpectedly enhanced immune stimulating properties. Thus the<br>
invention in one aspect relates to a composition of an oligonucleotide having a formula:<br>
5' Y1N1ZN2Y2 3', wherein Y1 and Y2 are, independent of one another, nucleic acid<br>
molecules having between 1 and 10 nucleotides, wherein Y1 includes at least one<br>
modified internucleotide linkage and Y2 includes at least one modified internucleotide<br>
linkage and wherein N1 and N2 are nucleic acid molecules, each independent of one<br>
another, having between 0 and 5 nucleotides, but wherein N1ZN2 has at least 6<br>
nucleotides in total and wherein the nucleotides of N1ZN2 have a phosphodiester<br>
backbone, and wherein Z is an immunostimulatory nucleic acid motif but does not<br>
include a CG. In one embodiment Z is a nucleic acid sequence selected from the group<br>
consisting of TTTT, TG, and a sequence wherein at least 50% of the bases of the<br>
sequence are Ts.<br>
In some embodiments Y1 and/or Y2 have between 3 and 8 nucleotides. In other<br>
embodiments Y1 and/or Y2 are comprised of at least three Gs, at least four Gs, least<br>
seven Gs, or all Gs. In other embodiments Y1 and/or Y2 are selected from the group<br>
consisting of TCGTCG, TCGTCGT, and TCGTCGTT (SEQ ID NO: 1145). In yet other<br><br>
embodiments Y1 and/or Y2 include at least one, two, three, four, or five poly-A, poly-T,<br>
or poly-C sequences.<br>
The center nucleotides (N1ZN2) of the formula Y1N1ZN2Y2 have phosphodiester<br>
internucleotide linkages and Y1 and Y2 have at least one modified intemucleotide<br>
linkage. In some embodiments Y1 and/or Y2 have at least two modified internucleotide<br>
linkages. In other embodiments Y1 and/or Y2 have between two and five modified<br>
internucleotide linkages. In yet other embodiments Y| has two modified internucleotide<br>
linkages and Y2 has five modified internucleotide linkages or Y1 has five modified<br>
internucleotide linkages and Y2 has two modified internucleotide linkages. The modified<br>
internucleotide linkage, in some embodiments is a phosphorothioate modified linkage, a<br>
phosphorodithioate modified linkage or a p-ethoxy modified linkage.<br>
Portions of the formula Y1N1ZN2Y2 may optionally form a palindrome. Thus, in<br>
some embodiments the nucleotides of N1ZN2 form a palindrome. In some embodiments<br>
the palindrome is not a direct repeat. In yet other embodiments the nucleotides of N1ZN2<br>
do not form a palindrome.<br>
According to other embodiments N1ZN2 has a sequence of nucleotides selected<br>

In another aspect the invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions and kits<br>
which contain both an oligonucleotide having the formula Y1N1ZN2Y2 and a CpG<br>
oligonucleotide (which optionally may be free of poly T and TG motifs and not be Py-<br>
rich), a Py-rich and/or TG oligonucleotide physically separate from the oligonucleotide<br>
having the formula Y1N1ZN2Y2. The pharmaceutical preparations are in effective<br>
amounts and typically include pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, all as set forth in<br>
detail herein. The kits include at least one container containing an oligonucleotide<br>
having the formula Y1N1ZN2Y2. The same container, or in other embodiments, a second<br>
container, may contain an oligonucleotide with a CpG motif, which optionally may be<br>
free of Py-rich and/or TG motifs and/or a Py-rich or TG oligonucleotide (or some<br>
combination thereof). The kit also contains instructions for administering the<br>
oligonucleotides to a subject. The kits also may include a container containing a solvent<br>
or a diluent.<br>
In summary, as if fully recited herein, an oligonucleotide having the formula<br>
Y1N1ZN2Y2 which is physically separate from the CpG, Py-rich or TG oligonucleotide<br>
can be used together with the CpG, Py-rich, TG oligonucleotides, in the methods,<br>
compositions and products described herein.<br><br>
In another aspect the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition including<br>
at least two oligonucleotides of the invention, wherein the at least two oligonucleotides<br>
have different sequences from one another and a pharmaceutically acceptable-carrier.<br>
A vaccine formulation is provided according to another aspect of the invention.<br>
The vaccine includes any of the compositions of the invention in combination with an<br>
antigen.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention a method of stimulating an immune<br>
response is provided. The method involves administering a Py-rich or a TG<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acid to a non-rodent subject in an amount effective to induce<br>
an immune response in the non-rodent subject. Preferably the Py-rich or TG<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acid is administered orally, locally, in a sustained release<br>
device, mucosally to a mucosal surface, systemically, parenterally, or intramuscularly.<br>
When the Py-rich or TG immunostimulatory nucleic acid is administered to the mucosal<br>
surface it may be delivered in an amount effective for inducing a mucosal immune<br>
response or a systemic immune response. In preferred embodiments the mucosal surface<br>
is selected from the group consisting of an oral, nasal, rectal, vaginal, and ocular surface.<br>
In some embodiments the method includes exposing the subject to an antigen<br>
wherein the immune response is an antigen-specific immune response. The antigen may<br>
be encoded by a nucleic acid vector which can be delivered to the subject. In some<br>
embodiments the antigen is selected from the group consisting of a tumor antigen, a viral<br>
antigen, a bacterial antigen, a parasitic antigen and a peptide antigen.<br>
Py-rich and TG immunostimulatory nucleic acids are capable of provoking a<br>
broad spectrum of immune response. For instance these immunostimulatory nucleic<br>
acids can be used to redirect a Th2 to a Thl immune response. Py-rich and TG nucleic<br>
acids may also be used to activate an immune cell, such as a leukocyte, a dendritic cell,<br>
and an NK cell. The activation can be performed in vivo, in vitro, or ex vivo, i.e., by<br>
isolating an immune cell from the subject, contacting the immune cell with an effective<br>
amount to activate the immune cell of the Py-rich or TG immunostimulatory nucleic acid<br>
and re-administering the activated immune cell to the subject. In some embodiments the<br>
dendritic cell expresses a cancer antigen. The dendritic cell can be exposed to the cancer<br>
antigen ex vivo.<br><br>
The immune response produced by Py-rich or TG nucleic acids may also result in<br>
induction of cytokine production, e.g., production of IL-6, IL-12, IL-18 TNF, IFN-Î± and<br>
IFN-Î³.<br>
In still another embodiment, the Py-rich and TG nucleic acids are useful for<br>
treating cancer. The Py-rich and TG nucleic acids are also useful according to other<br>
aspects of the invenion in preventing cancer (e.g., reducing a risk of developing cancer)<br>
in a suject at risk of developing a cancer. The cancer may be selected from the group<br>
consisting of biliary tract cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, choriocarcinoma, colon<br>
cancer, endometrial cancer, gastric cancer, intraepithelial neoplasms, lymphomas, liver<br>
cancer, lung cancer (e.g. small cell and non-small cell), melanoma, neuroblastomas, oral<br>
cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreas cancer, prostate cancer, rectal cancer, sarcomas, thyroid<br>
cancer, and renal cancer, as well as other carcinomas and sarcomas. In some important<br>
embodiments, the cancer is selected from the group consisting of bone cancer, brain and<br>
CNS cancer, connective tissue cancer, esophageal cancer, eye cancer, Hodgkin's<br>
lymphoma, larynx cancer, oral cavity cancer, skin cancer, and testicular cancer.<br>
Py-rich and TG nucleic acids may also be used for increasing the responsiveness<br>
of a cancer cell to a cancer therapy (e.g., an anti-cancer therapy), optionally when the Py-<br>
rich or TG immunostimulatory nucleic acid is administered in conjunction with an anti-<br>
cancer therapy. The anti-cancer therapy may be a chemotherapy, a vaccine (e.g., an in<br>
vitro primed dendritic cell vaccine or a cancer antigen vaccine) or an antibody based<br>
therapy. This latter therapy may also involve administering an antibody specific for a<br>
cell surface antigen of, for example, a cancer cell, wherein the immune response results<br>
in antigen dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In one embodiment, the antibody<br>
may be selected from the group consisting Ributaxin, Herceptin, Quadramet, Panorex,<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention in one aspect involves the finding that pyrimidine (Py) rich and<br>
preferably thymidine (T) rich nucleic acids as well as nucleic acids that contain TG<br>
dirtucleotide motifs are effective in mediating immune stimulatory effects. It was known<br>
in the prior art that CpG containing nucleic acids are therapeutic and prophylactic<br>
compositions that stimulate the immune system to treat cancer, infectious diseases,<br>
allergy, asthma and other disorders and to help protect against opportunistic infections<br>
following cancer chemotherapies. The strong yet balanced, cellular and humoral<br>
immune responses that result from CpG stimulation reflect the body's own natural<br>
defense system against invading pathogens and cancerous cells. CpG sequences, while<br>
relatively rare in human DNA are commonly found in the DNA of infectious organisms<br>
such as bacteria. The human immune system has apparently evolved to recognize CpG<br>
sequences as an early warning sign of infection, and to initiate an immediate and<br>
powerful immune response against invading pathogens without causing adverse reactions<br>
frequently seen with other immune stimulatory agents. Thus CpG containing nucleic<br>
acids, relying on this innate immune defense mechanism, can utilize a unique and natural<br>
pathway for immune therapy. The effects of CpG nucleic acids on immune modulation<br>
were discovered by the inventor of the instant patent application and have been described<br>
extensively in co-pending patent applications, such as U.S. Patent Application Serial<br>
Nos: 08/386,063 filed on 02/07/95 (and related PCT US95/0I570); 08/738,652 filed on<br>

PCT/US99/09863). The entire contents of each of these patents and patent applications<br>
is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The findings of the instant invention are applicable to all of the above described<br>
uses of CpG containing nucleic acids as well as any other known use for CpG nucleic<br>
acids. The invention involves, in one aspect, the discovery that Py-rich and preferably T-<br>
rich and TG nucleic acids have similar immune stimulatory properties to CpG<br>
oligonucleotides regardless of whether a CpG motif is present. Thus the invention is<br><br>
useful for any method for stimulating the immune system using Py-rich or TG nucleic<br>
acids. It was also discovered surprisingly according to the invention that chimeric<br>
oligonucleotides which lack a CpG motif are immune stimulatory and have many of the<br>
same prophylactic and therapeutic activities as a CpG oligonucleotide.<br>
A Py-rich nucleic acid is a T-rich or C-rich immunostimulatory nucleic acid. In<br>
some embodiments T-rich nucleic acids are preferred. A T-rich nucleic acid is a nucleic<br>
acid, which includes at least one poly T sequence and/or which has a nucleotide<br>
composition of greater than 25% T nucleotide residues. A nucleic acid having a poly-T<br>
sequence includes at least four Ts in a row, such as 5'TTTT3\ Preferably the T-rich<br>
nucleic acid includes more than one poly T sequence. In preferred embodiments the T-<br>
rich nucleic acid may have 2, 3, 4, etc poly T sequences, such as oligonucleotide #2006<br>
(SEQ ID NO:246). One of the most highly immunostimulatory T-rich oligonucleotides<br>
discovered according to the invention is a nucleic acid composed entirely of T nucleotide<br>
residues, e.g., oligonucleotide #2183 (SEQ ID NO.-433). Other T-rich nucleic acids<br>
according to the invention have a nucleotide composition of greater than 25% T<br>
nucleotide residues, but do not necessarily include a poly T sequence. In these T-rich<br>
nucleic acids the T nucleotide resides may be separated from one another by other types<br>
of nucleotide residues, i.e., G, C, and A. In some embodiments the T-rich nucleic acids<br>
have a nucleotide composition of greater than 35%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%,<br>
and 99%, T nucleotide residues and every integer % in between. Preferably the T-rich<br>
nucleic acids have at least one poly T sequence and a nucleotide composition of greater<br>
than 25% T nucleotide residues.<br>
It was discovered according to the invention that the T content of an ODN has a<br>
dramatic effect on the immune stimulatory effect of the ODN and that T-rich ODN can<br>
activate multiple human immune cell types in the absence of any CpG motifs. An<br>
oligonucleotide having a 3' poly-T region and 2 5'CGs e.g., ODN 2181 (SEQ ID<br>
NO:431) is highly immune stimulatory. An oligonucleotide of similar length, ODN<br>
2116 (SEQ ID NO:357) which contains two CG dinucleotides at the 5* end and a poly-C<br>
region at the 3' end was also immune stimulatory but to a lesser extent than the T-rich<br>
oligonucleotide using standard experimental conditions. Thus, although C and T have<br>
almost identical structures, their effects on the immune properties of an ODN are varied.<br>
They both are capable of inducing an immune response but to different extents. Thus<br><br>
both T-rich and C-rich oligonucleotides are useful according to the invention, but T-rich<br>
oligonucleotides are preferred. Furthermore, if the T content of the ODN is reduced by<br>
incorporating other bases such as G, A, or C, then the immune stimulatory effects are<br>
reduced (ODN #2188 (SEQ ID NO:905), 2190 (SEQ ID NO.907), 2191 (SEQ ID<br>
NO:908), and 2193 (SEQ ID NO:910)).<br>
A C-rich nucleic acid is a nucleic acid molecule having at least one or preferably<br>
at least two poly-C regions or which is composed of at least 50% C nucleotides. A poly-<br>
C region is at least four C residues in a row. Thus a poly-C region is encompassed by<br>
the formula 5'CCCC 3'. In some embodiments it is preferred that the poly-C region<br>
have the formula 5'CCCCCC 3'. Other C-rich nucleic acids according to the invention<br>
have a nucleotide composition of greater than 50% C nucleotide residues, but do not<br>
necessarily include a poly C sequence. In these C-rich nucleic acids the C nucleotide<br>
residues may be separated from one another by other types of nucleotide residues, i.e., G,<br>
T, and A. In some embodiments the C-rich nucleic acids have a nucleotide composition<br>
of greater than 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 99%, C nucleotide residues and every integer<br>
% in between. Preferably the C-rich nucleic acids have at least one poly C sequence and<br>
a nucleotide composition of greater than 50% C nucleotide residues, and in some<br>
embodiments are also T-rich.<br>
As shown in the Examples, several ODN previously believed to be non-<br>
immunostimulatory, including two ODNs SEQ ID NO.: 225 and SEQ ID NO.: 282<br>
previously described to be non-stimulatory and mainly used as control ODNs<br>
(Takahashi, T et al 2000. J. Immunol 164:4458) were found to be immunostimulatory.<br>
Our experiments, demonstrated that these ODNs can stimulate B cells, although at higher<br>
concentrations compared to CpG ODNs (Fig. 6). A long Poly T ODN (30mer) induced,<br>
at least in some experiments, comparable strong activation of B cells to one of the<br>
strongest CpG ODN activators of B cells. These experiments also revealed the<br>
surprising finding that even Poly C ODNs can lead to stimulation of B cells.<br>
Immunostimulation by these ODNs, however, was not limited to human B cells.<br>
Different experimental assays clearly demonstrated in addition that monocytes, NK cells<br>
and even NKT cells can be activated by such non-CpG ODNs (Fig. 7-10). In contrast<br>
to Poly T and Poly C sequences, immunostimulation by Poly A sequences (at least for<br>
monocytes, B and NK cells) was not achieved. Interestingly it was found that the<br><br>
introduction of a CpG motif into SEQ ID NO.: 225 enhanced the immunostimulatory<br>
activity whereas the elongation with a Poly T stretch did not enhance<br>
immunostimulation. This suggests that CpG and T-rich ODN may operate through<br>
different mechanisms or pathways. It is also possible that insertion of a poly-T motif<br>
into a different position of SEQ ID NO.: 225 may result in a change in<br>
immunostimulatory properties.<br>
A "TG nucleic acid" or a "TG immunostimulatory nucleic acid" as used herein is<br>
a nucleic acid containing at least one TpG dinucleotide (thymidine-guanine dinucleotide<br>
sequence, i.e. "TG DNA" or DNA containing a 5' thymidine followed by 3' guanosine<br>
and linked by a phosphate bond) and activates a component of the immune system.<br>
In one embodiment the invention provides a TG nucleic acid represented by at<br>
least the formula:<br>
wherein X1 and X2 are nucleotides and N is any nucleotide and N1 and N2 are<br>
nucleic acid sequences composed of any number of N provided that the sum total of N1<br>
and N2 is in the range of 11 to 21. As an example, if N1 is 5, then N2 may be 6 (leading<br>
to a total length for the oligonucleotide of 15 nucleotides). The TG may be located<br>
anywhere within the oligonucleotide stretch, including the 5' end, the center and the 3'<br>
end. Thus, N1 may be zero through to 21, inclusive, provided that N2 is appropriately<br>
chosen to give a sum of N2 and N1 equal to 11 through to 21, inclusive. Similarly, N2<br>
may be zero through to 21, inclusive, provided that the sum total of N1 and N2 equals 11<br>
to 21, inclusive. In some embodiments X1 is adenine, guanine, or thymidine and X2 is<br>
cytosine, adenine, or thymidine. In one preferred embodiment, X2 is thymidine. In other<br>
embodiments X1 is cytosine and/or X2 is guanine. In other embodiments, as discussed<br>
herein, the nucleic acid may encompass other motifs, provided it is long enough to do so.<br>
In other embodiments the TG nucleic acid is represented by at least the formula:<br>
5'N1X1X2TGX3X4N23'<br>
wherein X1, X2, X3, and X4 are nucleotides. In some embodiments, X1X2 are<br>
nucleotides selected from the group consisting of: GpT, GpG, GpA, ApA, ApT, ApG,<br>
CpT, CpA, TpA and TpT; and X3X4 are nucleotides selected from the group consisting<br>
of: TpT, CpT, ApT, ApG, TpC, ApC, CpC, TpA, ApA, and CpA; N is any nucleotide<br>
and N1 and N2 are nucleic acid sequences composed of any number of nucleotides<br><br>
provide that the sum total of N, and N2 is in the range of 9 to 19. In some embodiments,<br>
X1X2 are GpA or GpT and X3X4 are TpT. In other embodiments X1 or X2 or both are<br>
purines and X3 or X4 or both are pyrimidines or X,X2 are GpA and X3 or X4 or both are<br>
pyrimidines. In one preferred embodiment, X3X4 are nucleotides selected from the<br>
group consisting of: TpT, TpC and TpA.<br>
The immunostimulatory nucleic acid may be any size (i.e., length) provided it is<br>
at least 4 nucleotides. In important embodiments, the immunostimulatory nucleic acids<br>
have a length in the range of between 6 and 100. In still other embodiments, the length<br>
is in the range of between 8 and 35 nucleotides. Preferably, the TG oligonucleotides<br>
range in size from 15 to 25 nucleotides.<br>
The size (i.e., the number of nucleotide residues along the length of the nucleic<br>
acid) of the immunostimulatory nucleic acid may also contribute to the stimulatory<br>
activity of the nucleic acid. It has been discovered, surprisingly that even for highly<br>
immune stimulating immunostimulatory nucleic acids, the length of the nucleic acid<br>
influences the extent of immunostimulation that can be achieved. It has been<br>
demonstrated that increasing the length of a T-rich nucleic acid up to 24 nucleotides<br>
causes increased immune stimulation. The experiments presented in the examples<br>
demonstrate that when the length of the T-rich nucleic acid is increased from 18 to 27<br>
nucleotides the ability of the nucleic acid to stimulate an immune response is increased<br>
significantly (compare ODN #2194,2183,2195, and 2196 decreasing in size from 27-18<br>
nucleotides). Increasing the length of the nucleic acid up to 30 nucleotides had a<br>
dramatic impact on the biological properties of the nucleic acid but increasing the length<br>
beyond 30 nucleotides did not appear to further influence the immune stimulatory effect<br>
(e.g., compare ODN 2179 to 2006).<br>
It has been shown that TG nucleic acids ranging in length from 15 to 25<br>
nucleotides in length may exhibit an increased immune stimulation. Thus, in one aspect,<br>
the invention provides an oligonucleotide that is 15-27 nucleotides in length (i.e., an<br>
oligonucleotide that is 15,16,17, 18,19,20, 21,22, 23, 24, 25,26 or 27 nucleotides in<br>
length) that may be a T-rich nucleic acid or may be a TG nucleic acid, or may be both a<br>
T-rich and a TG nucleic acid. In one embodiment, the oligonucleotide is not a T-rich<br>
nucleic acid nor is it a TG nucleic acid. In other embodiments, the oligonucleotide does<br>
not have a CG motif. The invention similarly provides oligonucleotides that are 15-27<br><br>
nucleotides in length, oligonucleotides that are 18-25 nucleotides in length,<br>
oligonucleotides that are 20-23 nucleotides in length, and oligonucleotides that are 23-<br>
25 nucleotides in length. Any of the foregoing embodiments relating to oligonucleotides<br>
15-27 in length also relate to the oligonucleotides of these differing lengths. The<br>
invention further embraces the use of any of these foregoing oligonucleotides in the<br>
methods recited herein.<br>
Although a maximal level of immune stimulation is achieved with some T-rich<br>
nucleic acids when the nucleic acid is 24-30 nucleotide residues in length, as well as with<br>
some TG nucleic acids that range from 15 to 25 nucleotides in length, shorter or longer<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acids can also be used according to the methods of the<br>
invention. For facilitating uptake into cells immunostimulatory nucleic acids preferably<br>
have a minimum length of 6 nucleotide residues. Nucleic acids of any size greater than 6<br>
nucleotides (even many kb long) are capable of inducing an immune response according<br>
to the invention if sufficient immunostimulatory motifs are present, since larger nucleic<br>
acids are degraded inside of cells. Preferably the immunostimulatory nucleic acids are in<br>
the range of between 8 and 100 and in some embodiments T-rich containing<br>
irnmunostirnulatory nucleic acids are between 24 and 40 nucleotides in length and TG<br>
containing immunostimulatory nucleic acids are between 15 and 25 nucleotides in<br>
length.<br>
In one embodiment the T-rich nucleic acid is represented by at least the formula:<br>
5lX1X2TTTTX3X43'<br>
wherein X1, X2,X3, and X4 are nucleotides. In one embodiment X1X2 is TT<br>
and/or X3X4 is TT. In another embodiment X1X2 are any one of the following nucleotides<br>
TA, TG, TC, AT, AA, AG, AC, CT, CC, CA, GT, GG, GA, and GC; and X3X4 are any<br>
one of the following nucleotides TA, TG, TC, AT, AA, AG, AC, CT, CC, CA, GT, GG,<br>
GA, and GC.<br>
In some embodiments it is preferred that the immunostimulatory nucleic acids do<br>
not contain poly-C (CCCC), or poly-A (AAAA). In other embodiments it is preferred<br>
that the immunostimulatory nucleic acid include poly-C, poly-A, poly-G (GGGG) or<br>
multiple GGs. In particular poly-G or multiple GG motifs have dramatic effects on some<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acids. The effect of these non-T sequences depends in part<br>
on the status of the nucleic acid backbone. For instance, if the nucleic acid has a<br><br>
phosphodiester backbone or a chimeric backbone the inclusion of these sequences in the<br>
nucleic acid will only have minimal if any effect on the biological activity of the nucleic<br>
acid. If the backbone is completely phosphorothioate (or other phosphate modification)<br>
or significantly phosphorothioate then the inclusion of these sequences may have more<br>
influence on the biological activity or the kinetics of the biological activity, causing a<br>
decrease in potency of the T-rich and TG immunostimulatory nucleic acids.<br>
Although C-rich nucleic acids have been demonstrated to have immune<br>
stimulating properties, insertion of Poly-C sequences into a T-rich nucleic acid in a<br>
manner that would reduce the relative proportion of T nucleotides in the nucleic acid can<br>
have a negative impact on the nucleic acid. Although applicants are not bound by a<br>
proposed mechanism, it is believed that the immune system has developed a mechanism<br>
for distinguishing nucleic acids having different nucleotide properties, possibly resulting<br>
from different sets of binding proteins which recognize different sequences or specific<br>
binding proteins which recognize all the immunostimulatory sequences but with different<br>
affinities. In general nucleic acids including unmethylated CpG motifs are the most<br>
immunostimulatory, followed by T-rich nucleic acids, TG nucleic acids and C-rich<br>
nucleic acids. This generalization, however, has many exceptions. For instance a strong<br>
T-rich nucleic acid like SEQ ID NO.: 886 is more immune stimulatory in some assays<br>
than some CpG containing nucleic acids (e.g., a phosphorothioate CpG nucleic acid<br>
containing a single CpG motif).<br>
It has also been discovered that the addition of a poly-A tail to an<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acid can enhance the activity of the nucleic acid. It was<br>
discovered that when a highly immune stimulatory CpG nucleic acid (SEQ ID NO.: 246)<br>
was modified with the addition of a poly-A tail (AAAAAA) or a poly-T tail (TTTTTT),<br>
the resultant oligonucleotides increased in immune stimulatory activity. The ability of<br>
the poly-A tail and the poly-T tail to increase the immunostimulating properties of the<br>
oligonucleotide was very similar. SEQ ID NO.: 246 is a T-rich oligonucleotide. It is<br>
likely that if poly-A and poly-T tails are added to a nucleic acid which is not T-rich, it<br>
would have a bigger impact on the immune stimulating capability of the nucleic acid.<br>
Since the poly-T tail was added to a nucleic acid that was already highly T-rich the<br>
immune stimulating properties of the poly-T addition was diluted somewhat, although<br>
not completely. This finding has important implications for the use of poly-A regions.<br><br>
Thus in some embodiments the immunostimulatory nucleic acids include a poly-A<br>
region and in other embodiments they do not.<br>
Some of the immunostimulatory nucleic acids of the invention include one or<br>
more CG motifs. The presence of CG motifs in the immunostimulatory nucleic acids<br>
also has an influence on the biological activity of the nucleic acids. If the total length of<br>
an immunostimulatory nucleic acid is 20 nucleotide residues or less, then CpG motifs are<br>
important in determining the immune effect of the nucleic acid, and methylation of these<br>
motifs reduces the potency of the immune stimulatory effects of the nucleic acid. If the<br>
length of the immunostimulatory nucleic acid is increased to 24, then the immune<br>
stimulatory effects of the nucleic acid become less dependent on the CpG motifs, and are<br>
no longer abolished by methylation of the CpG motifs or by their inversion to GC<br>
dinucleotides, provided the other immune-stimulatory properties described herein are<br>
present.<br>
For example, ODN 2006 (SEQ ID NO:246) is a highly immune stimulatory T-<br>
rich nucleic acid of 24 nucleotide residues in length with four CpG dinucleotides.<br>
However, ODN 2117 (SEQ ID NO.358), in which the CpG motifs are methylated is also<br>
highly immune stimulatory. ODN 2137 (SEQ ID NO:886), in which the CpG motifs of<br>
ODN 2006 are inverted to GpC, and which as a result possesses six TG dinucleotides is<br>
also immune stimulatory. The immune stimulatory effects of nucleic acids such as ODN<br>
2117 and 2137 are regulated by their T and TG content. Each of these three nucleic<br>
acids is T-rich and ODN 2137 is additionally TG rich. If their T content is reduced by<br>
inserting other bases such as A (ODN 2117 (SEQ ID NO:358)) or if their TG content is<br>
reduced by substituting TG with AG, then the immune stimulatory effects are somewhat<br>
reduced. In another example, a nucleic acid 24 nucleotides in length in which all of the<br>
positions are randomized has only a modest immune stimulatory effect (ODN 2182<br>
(SEQ ID NO:432)). Likewise, a nucleic acid 24 nucleotides in length with other,<br>
nucleotide compositions have variable immune stimulatory effects, depending on their T<br>
content (ODN 2188 (SEQ ID NO:905), 2189 (SEQ ID NO:906), 2190 (SEQ ID<br>
NO:907), 2191 (SEQ ID NO:908), 2193 (SEQ ID NO:910), 2183 (SEQ ID NO:433), and<br>
2178 (SEQ ID NO:428)). ODN 2190 which contains TGT motifs is more immune<br>
stimulatory than ODN 2202 which possesses TGG motifs. Thus, in some embodiments,<br>
TGT motifs are preferred. In still other embodiments, the number of TG motifs is<br><br>
important in that an increase in the number of TG motifs leads to an increase in immune<br>
stimulation. Some preferred TG nucleic acids contain at least three TG motifs.<br>

In some embodiments of the invention the immunostimulatory nucleic acids<br>
include CpG dinucleotides and in other embodiments the immunostimulatory nucleic<br>
acids are free of CpG dinucleotides. The CpG dinucleotides may be methylated or<br>
unmethylated. A nucleic acid containing at least one unmethylated CpG dinucleotide is<br>
a nucleic acid molecule which contains an unmethylated cytosine-guanine dinucleotide<br>
sequence (i.e. "CpG DNA" or DNA containing an unmethylated 5' cytosine followed by<br>
3' guanosine and linked by a phosphate bond) and activates the immune system. A<br>
nucleic acid containing at least one methylated CpG dinucleotide is a nucleic acid which<br>
contains a methylated cytosine-guanine dinucleotide sequence (i.e., a methylated 5'<br>
cytosine followed by a 3' guanosine and linked by a phosphate bond).<br>
Examples of T rich nucleic acids that are free of CpG nucleic acids include but<br>
are not limited to those listed in Table A, such as SEQ ID NO: 59-63,73-75,142,215,<br>
226,241,267-269,282, 301,304,330,342,358, 370-372, 393,433,471,479,486,491,<br>

908, and 910-913. Examples of T rich nucleic acids that include CpG nucleic acids<br>
include but are not limited to those listed in Table A, such as SEQ ID NO: 64,98,112,<br><br>
146, 185, 204, 208, 214, 224,233,244,246, 247,258, 262,263,265,270-273, 300, 305,<br>

The immunostimulatory nucleic acids can be double-stranded or single-stranded.<br>
Generally, double-stranded molecules are more stable in vivo, while single-stranded<br>
molecules have increased immune activity. Thus in some aspects of the invention it is<br>
preferred that the nucleic acid be single stranded and in other aspects it is preferred that<br>
the nucleic acid be double stranded.<br>
The term T-rich nucleic acid and TG nucleic acid, as used herein, refers to an<br>
immunostimulatory T-rich nucleic acid and an immunostimulatory TG nucleic acid,<br>
respectively, unless otherwise indicated. The T-rich nucleic acid sequences of the<br>
invention are those broadly described above as well as the nucleic acids shown in Table<br>
A that have at least one poly T motif and/or have a composition of greater than 25% T<br>
or preferably 35% nucleotide residues. The C-rich nucleic acids are those having at least<br>
one and preferably at least two poly-C regions. The TG nucleic acids of the invention<br>
are those broadly described above as well as the specific nucleic acids shown in Table A<br>
that have at least one TG motif.<br>
The nucleic acids of the invention may, but need not, also include a poly G motif.<br>
Poly G containing nucleic acids are also immunostimulatory. A variety of references,<br>
including Pisetsky and Reich, 1993 Mol Biol. Reports, 18:217-221; Krieger and Herz,<br>

Biochem. 116, 991-994 also describe the immunostimulatory properties of poly G<br>
nucleic acids.<br>
Poly G nucleic acids preferably are nucleic acids having the following formulas:<br>
5'X1X2GGGX3X4 3'<br>
wherein X1, X2,X3, and X4 are nucleotides. In preferred embodiments at least one of X3<br>
and X4 are a G. In other embodiments both of X3 and X4 are a G. In yet other<br>
embodiments the preferred formula is 5' GGGNGGG3', or 5' GGGNGGGNGGG 3'<br>
wherein N represents between 0 and 20 nucleotides. In other embodiments the poly G<br>
nucleic acid is free of unmethylated CG dinucleotides, such as, for example, the nucleic<br><br>
acids listed below as SEQ ID NO: 5, 6, 73, 215,267-269,276,282,288,297-299,355,<br>
359, 386, 387, 444,476, 531, 557-559, 733, 768, 795, 796, 914-925, 928-931, 933-936,<br>
and 938. In other embodiments the poly G nucleic acid includes at least one<br>
unmethylated CG dinucleotide, such as, for example, the nucleic acids listed above as<br>
SEQ ID NO: 67, 80-82, 141,,147, 148, 173, 178, 183, 185,214,224,264,265,315,329,<br>

825, 856, 857, 876, 892,909, 926, 927, 932, and 937.<br>
The terms "nucleic acid" and "oligonucleotide" are used interchangeably to mean<br>
multiple nucleotides (i.e. molecules comprising a sugar (e.g. ribose or deoxyribose)<br>
linked to a phosphate group and to an exchangeable organic base, which is either a<br>
substituted pyrimidine (e.g. cytosine (C), thymidine (T) or uracil (U)) or a substituted<br>
purine (e.g. adenine (A) or guanine (G)). As used herein, the terms refer to<br>
oligoribonucleotides as well as oligodeoxyribonucleotides. The terms shall also include<br>
polynucleosides (i.e. a polynucleotide minus the phosphate) and any other organic base<br>
containing polymer. Nucleic acid molecules can be obtained from existing nucleic acid<br>
sources (e.g., genomic or cDNA), but are preferably synthetic (e.g. produced by nucleic<br>
acid synthesis).<br>
The terms nucleic acid and oligonucleotide also encompass nucleic acids or<br>
oligonucleotides with substitutions or modifications, such as in the bases and/or sugars.<br>
For example, they include nucleic acids having backbone sugars which are covalently<br>
attached to low molecular weight organic groups other than a hydroxyl group at the 3'<br>
position and other than a phosphate group at the 5' position. Thus modified nucleic acids<br>
may include a 2'-O-alkylated ribose group. In addition, modified nucleic acids may<br>
include sugars such as arabinose instead of ribose. Thus the nucleic acids may be<br>
heterogeneous in backbone composition thereby containing any possible combination of<br>
polymer units linked together such as peptide- nucleic acids (which have amino acid<br>
backbone with nucleic acid bases). In some embodiments, the nucleic acids are<br>
homogeneous in backbone composition. Nucleic acids also include substituted purines<br>
and pyrimidines such as C-5 propyne modified bases (Wagner et al., Nature<br>
Biotechnology 14:840- 844,1996). Purines and pyrimidines include but are not limited<br>
to adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymidine, 5-methylcytosine, 2-aminopurine,<br>
2-amino-6-chloropurine, 2,6-diaminopurine, hypoxanthine, and other naturally and<br><br>
non-naturally occurring nucleobases, substituted and unsubstituted aromatic moieties.<br>
Other such modifications are well known to those of skill in the art.<br>
For use in the instant invention, the nucleic acids of the invention can be<br>
synthesized de novo using any of a number of procedures well known in the art. For<br>
example, the b-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite method (Beaucage, S.L., and Caruthers,<br>
M.H., Tet. Let. 22:1859,1981); nucleoside H-phosphonate method (Garegg etai, Tet.<br>
Let. 27:4051-4054,1986; Froehler etal.,Nucl Acid. Res. J4:5399-5407, 1986,; Garegg<br>
etai, Tet. Let. 27:4055-4058, 1986, Gaffney etal., Tet. Let. 29:2619-2622, 1988).<br>
These chemistries can be performed by a variety of automated nucleic acid synthesizers<br>
available in the market. These nucleic acids are referred to as synthetic nucleic acids.<br>
Alternatively, T-rich and/or TG dinucleotides can be produced on a large scale in<br>
plasmids, (see Sambrook, T., et al, "Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual", Cold<br>
Spring Harbor laboratory Press, New York, 1989) and separated into smaller pieces or<br>
administered whole. Nucleic acids can be prepared from existing nucleic acid sequences<br>
{e.g., genomic or cDNA) using known techniques, such as those employing restriction<br>
enzymes, exonucleases or endonucleases. Nucleic acids prepared in this mariner are<br>
referred to as isolated nucleic acid. An isolated nucleic acid generally refers to a nucleic<br>
acid which is separated from components which it is normally associated with in nature.<br>
As an example, an isolated nucleic acid may be one which is separated from a cell, from<br>
a nucleus, from mitochondria or from chromatin. The terms Py-rich nucleic acids and<br>
TG nucleic acids encompasses both synthetic and isolated Py-rich nucleic acids and TG<br>
nucleic acids.<br>
For use in vivo, the Py-rich and TG nucleic acids may optionally be relatively<br>
resistant to degradation (e.g., are stabilized). A "stabilized nucleic acid molecule" shall<br>
mean a nucleic acid molecule that is relatively resistant to in vivo degradation (e.g. via an<br>
exo- or endo-nuclease). Stabilization can be a function of length or secondary structure.<br>
Nucleic acids that are tens to hundreds of kbs long are relatively resistant to in vivo<br>
degradation. For shorter nucleic acids, secondary structure can stabilize and increase<br>
their effect. For example, if the 3' end of an nucleic acid has self-complementarity to an<br>
upstream region, so that it can fold back and form a sort of stem loop structure, then the<br>
nucleic acid becomes stabilized and therefore exhibits more activity.<br><br>
Alternatively, nucleic acid stabilization can be accomplished via phosphate<br>
backbone modifications. Preferred stabilized nucleic acids of the instant invention have<br>
a modified backbone. It has been demonstrated that modification of the nucleic acid<br>
backbone provides enhanced activity of the Py-rich and TG nucleic acids when<br>
administered in vivo. These stabilized structures are preferred because the Py-rich and<br>
TG molecules of the invention have at least a partial modified backbone. Py-rich and<br>
TG constructs having phosphorothioate linkages provide maximal activity and protect<br>
the nucleic acid from degradation by intracellular exo- and endo-nucleases. Other<br>
modified nucleic acids include phosphodiester modified nucleic acids, combinations of<br>
phosphodiester and phosphorothioate nucleic acid, methylphosphonate,<br>
methylphosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, p-ethoxy, and combinations thereof. Each<br>
of these combinations and their particular effects on immune cells is discussed in more<br>
detail with respect to CpG nucleic acids in PCT Published Patent Applications<br>
PCT/US95/01570 (WO 96/02555) and PCT/US97/19791 (WO 98/18810) claiming<br>
priority to U.S. Serial Nos. 08/386,063 and 08/960,774, filed on February 7, 1995 and<br>
October 30, 1997 respectively, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by<br>
reference. It is believed that these modified nucleic acids may show more stimulatory<br>
activity due to enhanced nuclease resistance, increased cellular uptake, increased protein<br>
binding, and/or altered intracellular localization.<br>
The compositions of the invention may optionally be chimeric oligonucleotides.<br>
The chimeric oligonucleotides are oligonucleotides having a formula: 5' Y1N1ZN2Y2 3'.<br>
Y1 and Y2 are nucleic acid molecules having between 1 and 10 nucleotides. Y1 and Y2<br>
each include at least one modified intemucleotide linkage. Since at least 2 nucleotides of<br>
the chimeric oligonucleotides include backbone modifications these nucleic acids are an<br>
example of one type of "stabilized immunostimulatory nucleic acids."<br>
With respect to the chimeric oligonucleotides, Y1 and Y2 are considered<br>
independent of one another. This means that each of Y1 and Y2 may or may not have<br>
different sequences and different backbone linkages from one anther in the same<br>
molecule. The sequences vary, but in some cases Y1 and Y2 have a poly-G sequence. A<br>
poly-G sequence refers to at least 3 Gs in a row. In other embodiments the poly-G<br>
sequence refers to at least 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 Gs in a row. In other embodiments Y1 and Y2<br>
may be TCGTCG, TCGTCGT, or TCGTCGTT (SEQ ID NO:1145). Y1 and Y2 may also<br><br>
have a poly-C, poIy-T, or poly-A sequence. In some embodiments Y1 and/or Y2 have<br>
between 3 and 8 nucleotides.<br>
N1 and N2 are nucleic acid molecules having between 0 and 5 nucleotides as long<br>
as N1ZN2 has at least 6 nucleotides in total. The nucleotides of N1ZN2 have a<br>
phosphodiester backbone and do not include nucleic acids having a modified backbone.<br>
Z is an immunostimulatory nucleic acid motif but does not include a CG. For<br>
instance, Z may be a nucleic acid a T-rich sequence, e.g. including a TTTT motif or a<br>
sequence wherein at least 50% of the bases of the sequence are Ts or Z may be a TG<br>
sequence.<br>
The center nucleotides (N1ZN2) of the formula Y1N1ZN2Y2 have phosphodiester<br>
intemucleotide linkages and Y1 and Y2 have at least one, but may have more than one or<br>
even may have all modified intemucleotide linkages. In preferred embodiments Y!<br>
and/or Y2 have at least two or between two and five modified intemucleotide linkages or<br>
Y1 has two modified intemucleotide linkages and Y2 has five modified intemucleotide<br>
linkages or Y\ has five modified intemucleotide linkages and Y2 has two modified<br>
intemucleotide linkages. The modified intemucleotide linkage, in some embodiments is<br>
a phosphorothioate modified linkage, a phosphorodithioate modified linkage or a p-<br>
ethoxy modified linkage.<br>
Modified backbones such as phosphorothioates may be synthesized using<br>
automated techniques employing either phosphoramidate or H-phosphonate chemistries.<br>
Aryl-and alkyl-phosphonates can be made, e.g., as described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,469,863; and alkylphosphotriesters (in which the charged oxygen moiety is alkylated<br>
as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,023,243 and European Patent No. 092,574) can be<br>
prepared by automated solid phase synthesis using commercially available reagents.<br>
Methods for making other DNA backbone modifications and substitutions have been<br>
described (Uhlmann, E. and Peyman, A., Chem. Rev. 90:544,1990; Goodchild, J.,<br>
Bioconjugate Chem. 1:165, 1990).<br>
Other stabilized nucleic acids include: nonionic DNA analogs, such as alkyl- and<br>
aryl-phosphates (in which the charged phosphonate oxygen is replaced by an alkyl or<br>
aryl group), phosphodiester and alkylphosphotriesters, in which the charged oxygen<br>
moiety is alkylated. Nucleic acids which contain diol, such as tetraethyleneglycol or<br><br>
hexaethylenegjycol, at either or both termini have also been shown to be substantially<br>
resistant to nuclease degradation.<br>
In the case when the Py-rich or TG nucleic acid is administered in conjunction<br>
with an antigen which is encoded in a nucleic acid vector, it is preferred that the<br>
backbone of the Py-rich or TG nucleic acid be a chimeric combination of phosphodiester<br>
and phosphorothioate (or other phosphate modification). The cell may have a problem<br>
taking up a plasmid vector in the presence of completely phosphorothioate nucleic acid.<br>
Thus when both a vector and a nucleic acid are delivered to a subject, it is preferred that<br>
the nucleic acid have a chimeric backbone or have a phosphorothioate backbone but that<br>
the plasmid be associated with a vehicle that delivers it directly into the cell, thus<br>
avoiding the need for cellular uptake. Such vehicles are known in the art and include, for<br>
example, liposomes and gene guns.<br>
The nucleic acids described herein as well as various control nucleic acids are<br>
presented below in Table A.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
While CpG effects in mice are well characterized, information regarding the<br>
human system is limited. CpG phosphorothioate oligonucleotides with strong stimulatory<br>
activity in the mouse system show lower activity on human and other non-rodent<br>
immune cells. In the examples the development of a potent human CpG motif and the<br>
characterization of its effects and mechanisms of action on human primary B-cells is<br>
described. DNA containing this CpG motif strongly stimulated primary human B-cells<br>
to proliferate, to produce IL-6 and to express increased levels of CD86, CD40, CD54 and<br>
MHC II. It increased DNA binding activity of the transcription factors NFKB and AP-1,<br>
as well as phosphorylation of the stress activated protein kinases JNK and p38, and the<br>
transcription factor ATF-2. B-cell signaling pathways activated by CpG DNA were<br>
different from those activated by the B-cell receptor which activated ERK and a different<br>
isoform of JNK, but did not activate p38 and ATF-2. In general the data on CpG DNA-<br>
initiated signal transduction are consistent with those obtained in mice (Hacker H., et al.<br>
1998. Embo J 17:6230, Yi A. K., and Krieg A. M. 1998. JImmunol 161:4493).<br>
The preferred non-rodent motif is 5' TCGTCGTT 3'. Base exchanges within the<br>
most potent 8mer CpG motif (5' TCGTCGTT 3') diminished the activity of the<br>
oligonucleotide. The thymidines at the 5' and the 3' position of this motif were more<br>
important than the thymidine at the middle position. An adenine or guanosine at the<br>
middle position produced a decrease in the activity.<br>
Of note, our studies demonstrate that one human CpG motif within a<br>
phosphodiester oligonucleotide (2080) is sufficient to produce the maximal effect, and<br>
that additional CpG motifs (2059) did not further enhance the activity. The<br>
oligonucleotide with the 8mer motif 5' TCG TCG TT 3' (2080) containing two CpG<br>
dinucleotides showed the highest activity in the studies. Replacement of the bases<br>
flanking the two CpG dinucleotides (5' position, middle position, 3' position) reduced<br>
the activity of this sequence. Both CpG dinucleotides within the 8mer CpG motif were<br>
required for the optimal activity (2108, 2106). Cytidine methylation of the CpG<br>
dinucleotides (2095) abolished the activity of 2080, while methylation of an unrelated<br><br>
cytidine (2094) did not. The addition of two CpG motifs into the sequence of 2080<br>
resulting in 2059 did not further increase the activity of the phosphodiester<br>
oligonucleotide. The sequence of 2080 with a phosphorothioate backbone (2116)<br>
â¢ demonstrated less activity, suggesting that additional CpG motifs are preferred for a<br>
potent phosphorothioate oligonucleotide.<br>
It has been discovered according to the invention that the immunostimulatory<br>
nucleic acids have dramatic immune stimulatory effects on human cells such as NK<br>
cells, B cells, and DCs in vitro. It has been demonstrated that that the in vitro assays<br>
used herein predict in vivo effectiveness as a vaccine adjuvant in non-rodent vertebrates<br>
(Example 12), suggesting that immunostimulatory nucleic acids are effective therapeutic<br>
agents for human vaccination, cancer immunotherapy, asthma immunotherapy, general<br>
enhancement of immune function, enhancement of hematopoietic recovery following<br>
radiation or chemotherapy, and other immune modulatory applications.<br>
Thus the immunostimulatory nucleic acids are useful in some aspects of the<br>
invention as a prophylactic vaccine for the treatment of a subject at risk of developing an<br>
infection with an infectious organism or a cancer in which a specific cancer antigen has<br>
been identified or an allergy or asthma where the allergen or predisposition to asthma is<br>
known. The immunostimulatory nucleic acids can also be given without the antigen or<br>
allergen for shorter term protection against infection, allergy or cancer, and in this case<br>
repeated doses will allow longer term protection. A subject at risk as used herein is a<br>
subject who has any risk of exposure to an infection causing pathogen or a cancer or an<br>
allergen or a risk of developing cancer. For instance, a subject at risk may be a subject<br>
who is planning to travel to an area where a particular type of infectious agent is found or<br>
it may be a subject who through lifestyle or medical procedures is exposed to bodily<br>
fluids which may contain infectious organisms or directly to the organism or even any<br>
subject living in an area where an infectious organism or an allergen has been identified.<br>
Subjects at risk of developing infection also include general populations to which a<br>
medical agency recommends vaccination with a particular infectious organism antigen.<br>
If the antigen is an allergen and the subject develops allergic responses to that particular<br>
antigen and the subject may be exposed to the antigen, i.e., during pollen season, then<br>
that subject is at risk of exposure to the antigen. A subject at risk of developing an<br>
allergy to asthma includes those subjects that have been identified as having an allergy or<br><br>
asthma but that don't have the active disease during the immunostimulatory nucleic acid<br>
treatment as well as subjects that are considered to be at risk of developing these diseases<br>
because of genetic or environmental factors.<br>
A subject at risk of developing a cancer is one who is who has a high probability<br>
of developing cancer. These subjects include, for instance, subjects having a genetic<br>
abnormality, the presence of which has been demonstrated to have a correlative relation<br>
to a higher likelihood of developing a cancer and subjects exposed to cancer causing<br>
agents such as tobacco, asbestos, or other chemical toxins, or a subject who has<br>
previously been treated for cancer and is in apparent remission. When a subject at risk of<br>
developing a cancer is treated with an antigen specific for the type of cancer to which the<br>
subject is at risk of developing and a immunostimulatory nucleic acid, the subject may be<br>
able to kill the cancer cells as they develop. If a tumor begins to form in the subject, the<br>
subject will develop a specific immune response against the tumor antigen.<br>
In addition to the use of the immunostimulatory nucleic acids for prophylactic<br>
treatment, the invention also encompasses the use of the immunostimulatory nucleic<br>
acids for the treatment of a subject having an infection, an allergy, asthma, or a cancer.<br>
A subject having an infection is a subject that has been exposed to an infectious<br>
pathogen and has acute or chronic detectable levels of the pathogen in the body. The<br>
imrnunostimulatory nucleic acids can be used with an antigen to mount an antigen<br>
specific systemic or mucosal immune response that is capable of reducing the level of or<br>
eradicating the infectious pathogen. An infectious disease, as used herein, is a disease<br>
arising from the presence of a foreign microorganism in the body. It is particularly<br>
important to develop effective vaccine strategies and treatments to protect the body's<br>
mucosal surfaces, which are the primary site of pathogenic entry.<br>
A subject having an allergy is a subject that has or is at risk of developing an<br>
allergic reaction in response to an allergen. An allergy refers to acquired<br>
hypersensitivity to a substance (allergen). Allergic conditions include but are not limited<br>
to eczema, allergic rhinitis or coryza, hay fever, conjunctivitis, bronchial asthma,<br>
urticaria (hives) and food allergies, and other atopic conditions.<br>
Currently, allergic diseases are generally treated by the injection of small doses of<br>
antigen followed by subsequent increasing dosage of antigen. It is believed that this<br>
procedure induces tolerization to the allergen to prevent further allergic reactions. These<br><br>
methods, however, can take several years to be effective and are associated with the risk<br>
of side effects such as anaphylactic shock. The methods of the invention avoid these<br>
problems.<br>
Allergies are generally caused by IgE antibody generation against harmless<br>
allergens. The cytokines that are induced by systemic or mucosal administration of<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acids are predominantly of a class called Thl (examples are<br>
IL-12 and IFN-Î³) and these induce both humoral and cellular immune responses. The<br>
types of antibodies associated with a Thl response are generally more protective because<br>
they have high neutralization and opsonization capabilities. The other major type of<br>
immune response, which is associated with the production of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10<br>
cytokines, is termed a Th2 immune response. Th2 responses involve predominately<br>
antibodies and these have less protective effect against infection and some Th2 isotypes<br>
(e.g., IgE) are associated with allergy. In general, it appears that allergic diseases are<br>
mediated by Th2 type immune responses while Thl responses provide the best<br>
protection against infection, although excessive Thl responses are associated with<br>
autoimmune disease. Based on the ability of the immunostimulatory nucleic acids to<br>
shift the immune response in a subject from a Th2 (which is associated with production<br>
of IgE antibodies and allergy) to a Thl response (which is protective against allergic<br>
reactions), an effective dose for inducing an immune response of a immunostimulatory<br>
nucleic acid can be administered to a subject to treat or prevent an allergy.<br>
Thus, the immunostimulatory nucleic acids have significant therapeutic utility in<br>
the treatment of allergic and non-allergic conditions such as asthma. Th2 cytokines,<br>
especially IL-4 and IL-5 are elevated in the airways of asthmatic subjects. These<br>
cytokines promote important aspects of the asthmatic inflammatory response, including<br>
IgE isotope switching, eosinophil chemotaxis and activation and mast cell growth. Thl<br>
cytokines, especially IFN-Î³ and IL-12, can suppress the formation of Th2 clones and<br>
production of Th2 cytokines. Asthma refers to a disorder of the respiratory system<br>
characterized by inflammation, narrowing of the airways and increased reactivity of the<br>
airways to inhaled agents. Asthma is frequently, although not exclusively associated<br>
with atopic or allergic symptoms.<br>
A subject having a cancer is a subject that has detectable cancerous cells. The<br>
cancer may be a malignant or non-malignant cancer. Cancers or tumors include but are<br><br>
not limited to biliary tract cancer; brain cancer; breast cancer; cervical cancer;<br>
choriocarcinoma; colon cancer; endometrial cancer; esophageal cancer; gastric cancer;<br>
intracpithelial neoplasms; Iymphomas; liver cancer; lung cancer (e.g. small cell and<br>
non-small cell); melanoma; neuroblastomas; oral cancer; ovarian cancer; pancreas<br>
cancer; prostate cancer; rectal cancer; sarcomas; skin cancer; testicular cancer; thyroid<br>
cancer; and renal cancer, as well as other carcinomas and sarcomas. In one embodiment<br>
the cancer is hairy cell leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, cutaneous T-cell<br>
leukemia, multiple myeloma, follicular lymphoma, malignant melanoma, squamous cell<br>
carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, bladder cell carcinoma, or colon<br>
carcinoma.<br>
A subject according to the invention is a non-rodent subject. A non-rodent<br>
subject shall mean a human or vertebrate animal including but not limited to a dog, cat,<br>
horse, cow, pig, sheep, goat, chicken, primate, e.g., monkey, and fish (aquaculture<br>
species), e.g. salmon, but specifically excluding rodents such as rats and mice.<br>
Thus, the invention can also be used to treat cancer and tumors in non human<br>
subjects. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in companion animals (i.e., cats<br>
and dogs). Cancer usually strikes older animals which, in the case of house pets, have<br>
become integrated into the family. Forty-five % of dogs older than 10 years of age, are<br>
likely to succumb to the disease. The most common treatment options include surgery,<br>
chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Others treatment modalities which have been used<br>
with some success are laser therapy, cryotherapy, hyperthermia and immunotherapy.<br>
The choice of treatment depends on type of cancer and degree of dissemination. Unless<br>
the malignant growth is confined to a discrete area in the body, it is difficult to remove<br>
only malignant tissue without also affecting normal cells.<br>
Malignant disorders commonly diagnosed in dogs and cats include but are not<br>
limited to lymphosarcoma, osteosarcoma, mammary tumors, mastocytoma, brain tumor,<br>
melanoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, carcinoid lung tumor, bronchial gland tumor,<br>
bronchiolar adenocarcinoma, fibroma, myxochondroma, pulmonary sarcoma,<br>
neurosarcoma, osteoma, papilloma, retinoblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, Wilm's tumor,<br>
Burkitt's lymphoma, microglioma, neuroblastoma, osteoclastoma, oral neoplasia,<br>
fibrosarcoma, osteosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. Other neoplasias in dogs include<br>
genital squamous cell carcinoma, transmissable veneral tumor, testicular tumor,<br><br>
seminoma, Sertoli cell tumor, hemangiopericytoma, histiocytoma, chloroma<br>
(granulocytic sarcoma), corneal papilloma, corneal squamous cell carcinoma,<br>
hemangiosarcoma, pleural mesothelioma, basal cell tumor, thymoma, stomach tumor,<br>
adrenal gland carcinoma, oral papillomatosis, hemangioendothelioma and cystadenoma.<br>
Additional malignancies diagnosed in cats include follicular lymphoma, intestinal<br>
lymphosarcoma, fibrosarcoma and pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma. The ferret, an<br>
ever-more popular house pet is known to develop insulinoma, lymphoma, sarcoma,<br>
neuroma, pancreatic islet cell tumor, gastric MALT lymphoma and gastric<br>
adenocarcinoma.<br>
Neoplasias affecting agricultural livestock include leukemia,<br>
hemangiopericytoma and bovine ocular neoplasia (in cattle); preputial fibrosarcoma,<br>
ulcerative squamous cell carcinoma, preputial carcinoma, connective tissue neoplasia<br>
and mastocytoma (in horses); hepatocellular carcinoma (in swine); lymphoma and<br>
pulmonary adenomatosis (in sheep); pulmonary sarcoma, lymphoma, Rous sarcoma,<br>
reticulendotheliosis, fibrosarcoma, nephroblastoma, B-cell lymphoma and lymphoid<br>
leukosis (in avian species); retinoblastoma, hepatic neoplasia, lymphosarcoma<br>
(lymphoblastic lymphoma), plasmacytoid leukemia and swimbladder sarcoma (in fish),<br>
caseous lumphadenitis (CLA): chronic, infectious, contagious disease of sheep and goats<br>
caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, and contagious lung<br>
tumor of sheep caused by jaagsiekte.<br>
The subject is exposed to the antigen. As used herein, the term exposed to refers<br>
to either the active step of contacting the subject with an antigen or the passive exposure<br>
of the subject to the antigen in vivo. Methods for the active exposure of a subject to an<br>
antigen are well-known in the art. In general, an antigen is administered directly to the<br>
subject by any means such as intravenous, intramuscular, oral, transdermal, mucosal,<br>
intranasal, intratracheal, or subcutaneous administration. The antigen can be<br>
administered systemically or locally. Methods for administering the antigen and the<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acid are described in more detail below. A subject is<br>
passively exposed to an antigen if an antigen becomes available for exposure to the<br>
immune cells in the body. A subject may be passively exposed to an antigen, for<br>
instance, by entry of a foreign pathogen into the body or by the development of a tumor<br>
cell expressing a foreign antigen on its surface.<br><br>
The methods in which a subject is passively exposed to an antigen can be<br>
particularly dependent on timing of administration of the immunostimulatory nucleic<br>
acid. For instance, in a subject at risk of developing a cancer or an infectious disease or<br>
an allergic or asthmatic response, the subject may be administered the<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acid on a regular basis when that risk is greatest, i.e., during<br>
allergy season or after exposure to a cancer causing agent. Additionally the<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acid may be administered to travelers before they travel to<br>
foreign lands where they are at risk of exposure to infectious agents. Likewise the<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acid may be administered to soldiers or civilians at risk of<br>
exposure to biowarfare to induce a systemic or mucosal immune response to the antigen<br>
when and if the subject is exposed to it.<br>
An antigen as used herein is a molecule capable of provoking an immune<br>
response. Antigens include but are not limited to cells, cell extracts, proteins,<br>
polypeptides, peptides, polysaccharides, polysaccharide conjugates, peptide and non-<br>
peptide mimics of polysaccharides and other molecules, small molecules, lipids,<br>
glycolipids, carbohydrates, viruses and viral extracts and muticellular organisms such as<br>
parasites and allergens. The term antigen broadly includes any type of molecule which is<br>
recognized by a host immune system as being foreign. Antigens include but are not<br>
limited to cancer antigens, microbial antigens, and allergens.<br>
A cancer antigen as used herein is a compound, such as a peptide or protein,<br>
associated with a tumor or cancer cell surface and which is capable of provoking an<br>
immune response when expressed on the surface of an antigen presenting cell in the<br>
context of an MHC molecule. Cancer antigens can be prepared from cancer cells either<br>
by preparing crude extracts of cancer cells, for example, as described in Cohen, et al.,<br>
1994, Cancer Research, 54:1055, by partially purifying the antigens, by recombinant<br>
technology, or by de novo synthesis of known antigens. Cancer antigens include but are<br>
not limited to antigens that are recombinantly expressed, an immunogenic portion of, or<br>
a whole tumor or cancer. Such antigens can be isolated or prepared recombinantly or by<br>
any other means known in the art.<br>
A microbial antigen as used herein is an antigen of a microorganism and includes<br>
but is not limited to virus, bacteria, parasites, and fungi. Such antigens include the intact<br>
microorganism as well as natural isolates and fragments or derivatives thereof and also<br><br>
synthetic compounds which are identical to or similar to natural microorganism antigens<br>
and induce an immune response specific for that microorganism. A compound is similar<br>
to a natural microorganism antigen if it induces an immune response (humoral and/or<br>
cellular) to a natural microorganism antigen. Such antigens are used routinely in the art<br>
and are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Examples of viruses that have been found in humans include but are not limited<br>
to: Retroviridae (e.g. human immunodeficiency viruses, such as HIV-1 (also referred to<br>
as HTLV-III, LAV or HTLV-III/LAV, or HIV-III; and other isolates, such as HIV-LP;<br>

varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes virus; Poxviridae (variola viruses,<br>
vaccinia viruses, pox viruses); and Iridoviridae (e.g. African swine fever virus); and<br>
unclassified viruses (e.g. the etiological agents of Spongiform encephalopathies, the<br>
agent of delta hepatitis (thought to be a defective satellite of hepatitis B virus), the agents<br>
of non-A, non-B hepatitis (class 1 = internally transmitted; class 2 = parenterally<br>
transmitted (i.e. Hepatitis C); Norwalk and related viruses, and astroviruses).<br>
Both gram negative and gram positive bacteria serve as antigens in vertebrate<br>
animals. Such gram positive bacteria include, but are not limited to, Pasteurella species,<br>

Britain 1983, the entire contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Although many of the microbial antigens described above relate to human<br>
disorders, the invention is also useful for treating other nonhuman vertebrates.<br>
Nonhuman vertebrates are also capable of developing infections which can be prevented<br>
or treated with the Imrnunostimulatory nucleic acids disclosed herein. For instance, in<br>
addition to the treatment of infectious human diseases, the methods of the invention are<br>
useful for treating infections of animals.<br><br>
As used herein, the term treat, treated, or treating when used with respect to an<br>
infectious disease refers to a prophylactic treatment which increases the resistance of a<br>
subject (a subject at risk of infection) to infection with a pathogen or, in other words,<br>
decreases the likelihood that the subject will become infected with the pathogen as well<br>
as a treatment after the subject (a subject who has been infected) has become infected in<br>
order to fight the infection, e.g., reduce or eliminate the infection or prevent it from<br>
becoming worse.<br>
Many vaccines for the treatment of non-human vertebrates are disclosed in<br>

Each of the foregoing lists is illustrative, and is not intended to be limiting.<br>
In addition to the use of the immunostimulatory nucleic acids to induce an<br>
antigen specific immune response in humans, the methods of the preferred embodiments<br>
are particularly well suited for treatment of birds such as hens, chickens, turkeys, ducks,<br>
geese, quail, and pheasant. Birds are prime targets for many types of infections.<br>
Hatching birds are exposed to pathogenic microorganisms shortly after birth.<br>
Although these birds are initially protected against pathogens by maternal derived<br>
antibodies, this protection is only temporary, and the bird's own immature immune<br>
system must begin to protect the bird against the pathogens. It is often desirable to<br>
prevent infection in young birds when they are most susceptible. It is also desirable to<br>
prevent against infection in older birds, especially when the birds are housed in closed<br>
quarters, leading to the rapid spread of disease. Thus, it is desirable to administer the<br>
Immunostimulatory nucleic acid and the non-nucleic acid adjuvant of the invention to<br>
birds to enhance an antigen-specific immune response when antigen is present.<br>
An example of a common infection in chickens is chicken infectious anemia<br>
virus (CIAV). CIAV was first isolated in Japan in 1979 during an investigation of a<br>
Marek's disease vaccination break (Yuasa et al., 1979, Avian Dis. 23:366-385). Since<br>
that time, CIAV has been detected in commercial poultry in all major poultry producing<br>
countries (van Bulow et al., 1991, pp.690-699) in Diseases of Poultry, 9th edition, Iowa<br>
State University Press).<br>
CIAV infection results in a clinical disease, characterized by anemia,<br>
hemorrhage and immunosuppression, in young susceptible chickens. Atrophy of the<br>
thymus and of the bone marrow and consistent lesions of CIAV-infected chickens are<br>
also characteristic of CIAV infection. Lymphocyte depletion in the thymus, and<br>
occasionally in the bursa of Fabricius, results in immunosuppression and increased<br>
susceptibility to secondary viral, bacterial, or fungal infections which then complicate the<br>
course of the disease. The immunosuppression may cause aggravated disease after<br>
infection with one or more of Marek's disease virus (MDV), infectious bursal disease<br>
virus, reticuloendotheliosis virus, adenovirus, or reovirus. It has been reported that<br>
pathogenesis of MDV is enhanced by CIAV (DeBoer et al., 1989, p. 28 In Proceedings<br><br>
of the 38th Western Poultry Diseases Conference, Tempe, Ariz.). Further, it has been<br>
reported that CIAV aggravates the signs of infectious bursal disease (Rosenberger et al.,<br>
1989, Avian Dis. 33:707-713). Chickens develop an age resistance to experimentally<br>
induced disease due to CAA. This is essentially complete by the age of 2 weeks, but<br>
older birds are still susceptible to infection (Yuasa, N. et al., 1979 supra; Yuasa, N. et al.,<br>
Arian Diseases 24,202-209, 1980). However, if chickens are dually infected with CAA<br>
and an immunosuppressive agent (IBDV, MDV etc.), age resistance against the disease<br>
is delayed (Yuasa, N. et al., 1979 and 1980 supra; Bulow von V. et al., J. Veterinary<br>
Medicine 33, 93-116, 1986). Characteristics of CIAV that may potentiate disease<br>
transmission include high resistance to environmental inactivation and some common<br>
disinfectants. The economic impact of CIAV infection on the poultry industry is clear<br>
from the fact that 10% to 30% of infected birds in disease outbreaks die.<br>
Vaccination of birds, like other vertebrate animals can be performed at any age.<br>
Normally, vaccinations are performed at up to 12 weeks of age for a live microorganism<br>
and between 14-18 weeks for an inactivated microorganism or other type of vaccine.<br>
For in ovo vaccination, vaccination can be performed in the last quarter of embryo<br>
development. The vaccine may be administered subcutaneously, by spray, orally,<br>
intraocularly, intratracheally, nasally, or by other mucosal delivery methods described<br>
herein. Thus, the immunostimulatory nucleic acids of the invention can be administered<br>
to birds and other non-human vertebrates using routine vaccination schedules and the<br>
antigen can be administered after an appropriate time period as described herein.<br>
Cattle and livestock are also susceptible to infection. Diseases which affect these<br>
animals can produce severe economic losses, especially amongst cattle. The methods of<br>
the invention can be used to protect against infection in livestock, such as cows, horses,<br>
pigs, sheep, and goats.<br>
Cows can be infected by bovine viruses. Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a<br>
small enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus and is classified, along with hog cholera<br>
virus (HOCV) and sheep border disease virus (BDV), in the pestivirus genus. Although,<br>
Pestiviruses were previously classified in the Togaviridae family, some studies have<br>
suggested their reclassification within the Flaviviridae family along with the flavivirus<br>
and hepatitis C virus (HCV) groups (Francki, et al., 1991).<br><br>
BVDV, which is an important pathogen of cattle can be distinguished, based on<br>
cell culture analysiS, into cytopathogenic (CP) and noncytopathogenic (NCP) biotypes.<br>
The NCP biotype is more widespread although both biotypes can be found in cattle. If a<br>
pregnant caw becomes infected with an NCP strain, the cow can give birth to a<br>
persistently infected and specifically immunotolerant calf that will spread virus during<br>
its lifetime. The persistently infected cattle can succumb to mucosal disease and both<br>
biotypes can then be isolated from the animal. Clinical manifestations can include<br>
abortion, teratogenesis, and respiratory problems, mucosal disease and mild diarrhea. In<br>
addition, severe thrombocytopenia, associated with herd epidemics, that may result in<br>
the death of the animal has been described and strains associated with this disease seem<br>
more virulent than the classical BVDVs.<br>
Equine herpes viruses (EHV) comprise a group of antigenically distinct<br>
biological agents which cause a variety of infections in horses ranging from subclinical<br>
to fatal disease. These include Equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1), a ubiquitous pathogen in<br>
horses. EHV-1 is associated with epidemics of abortion, respiratory tract disease, and<br>
central nervous system disorders. Primary infection of upper respiratory tract of young<br>
horses results in a febrile illness which lasts for 8 to 10 days. Immunologically<br>
experienced mares may be re-infected via the respiratory tract without disease becoming<br>
apparent, so that abortion usually occurs without warning. The neurological syndrome is<br>
associated with respiratory disease or abortion and can affect animals of either sex at any<br>
age, leading to lack of co-ordination, weakness and posterior paralysis (Telford, E. A. R.<br>
et al., Virology 189,304-316, 1992). Other EHV's include EHV-2, or equine<br>
cytomegalovirus, EHV-3, equine coital exanthema virus, and EHV-4, previously<br>
classified as EHV-1 subtype 2.<br>
Sheep and goats can be infected by a variety of dangerous microorganisms<br>
including visna-maedi.<br>
Primates such as monkeys, apes and macaques can be infected by simian<br>
immunodeficiency virus. Inactivated cell-virus and cell-free whole simian<br>
immunodeficiency vaccines have been reported to afford protection in macaques (Stott et<br>
al. (1990) Lancet 36:1538-1541; Desrosiers et al. PNAS USA (1989) 86:6353-6357;<br>
Murphey-Corb et al. (1989) Science 246:1293-1297; and Carlson et al. (1990) AIDS<br>
Res. Human Retroviruses 6:1239-1246). A recombinant HIV gpl20 vaccine has been<br><br>
reported to afford protection in chimpanzees (Berman et al. (1990) Nature<br>
345:622-625).<br>
Cats, both domestic and wild, are susceptible to infection with a variety of<br>
microorganisms. For instance, feline infectious peritonitis is a disease which occurs in<br>
both domestic and wild cats, such as lions, leopards, cheetahs, and jaguars. When it is<br>
desirable to prevent infection with this and other types of pathogenic organisms in cats,<br>
the methods of the invention can be used to vaccinate cats to protect them against<br>
infection.<br>
Domestic cats may become infected with several retroviruses, including but not<br>
limited to feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline sarcoma virus (FeSV), endogenous type<br>
Concornavirus (RD-114), and feline syncytia-forming virus (FeSFV). Of these, FeLV is<br>
the most significant pathogen, causing diverse symptoms, including lymphoreticular and<br>
myeloid neoplasms, anemias, immune mediated disorders, and an immunodeficiency<br>
syndrome which is similar to human acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).<br>
Recently, a particular replication-defective FeLV mutant, designated FeLV-AIDS, has<br>
been more particularly associated with immunosuppressive properties.<br>
The discovery of feline T-lymphotropic lentivirus (also referred to as feline<br>
immunodeficiency) was first reported in Pedersen et al. (1987) Science 235:790-793.<br>
Characteristics of FIV have been reported in Yamamoto et al. (1988) Leukemia,<br>
December Supplement 2:204S-215S; Yamamoto et al. (1988) Am. J. Vet. Res.<br>
49:1246-1258; and Ackley et al. (1990) J. Virol. 64:5652-5655. Cloning and sequence<br>
analysis of FIV have been reported in Olmsted et al. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA<br>
86:2448-2452 and 86:4355-4360.<br>
Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a sporadic disease occurring unpredictably in<br>
domestic and wild Felidae. While FIP is primarily a disease of domestic cats, it has been<br>
diagnosed in lions, mountain lions, leopards, cheetahs, and the jaguar. Smaller wild cats<br>
that have been afflicted with FIP include the lynx and caracal, sand cat, and pallas cat.<br>
In domestic cats, the disease occurs predominantly in young animals, although cats of all<br>
ages are susceptible. A peak incidence occurs between 6 and 12 months of age. A<br>
decline in incidence is noted from 5 to 13 years of age, followed by an increased<br>
incidence in cats 14 to 15 years old.<br><br>
Viral, bacterial, and parasitic diseases in fin-fish, shellfish or other aquatic life<br>
forms pose a serious problem for the aquaculture industry. Owing to the high density of<br>
animals in the hatchery tanks or enclosed marine farming areas, infectious diseases may<br>
eradicate a large proportion of the stock in, for example, a fin-fish, shellfish, or other<br>
aquatic life forms facility. Prevention of disease is a more desired remedy to these<br>
threats to fish than intervention once the disease is in progress. Vaccination of fish is the<br>
only preventative method which may offer long-term protection through immunity.<br>
Nucleic acid based vaccinations are described in US Patent No. 5,780,448 issued to<br>
Davis.<br>
The fish immune system has many features similar to the mammalian immune<br>
system, such as the presence of B cells, T cells, lymphokines, complement, and<br>
immunoglobulins. Fish have lymphocyte subclasses with roles that appear similar in<br>
many respects to those of the B and T cells of mammals. Vaccines can be administered<br>
by immersion or orally.<br>
Aquaculture species include but are not limited to fin-fish, shellfish, and other<br>
aquatic animals. Fin-fish include all vertebrate fish, which may be bony or cartilaginous<br>
fish, such as, for example, salmonids, carp, catfish, yellowtail, seabream, and seabass.<br>
Salmonids are a family of fin-fish which include trout (including rainbow trout), salmon,<br>
and Arctic char. Examples of shellfish include, but are not limited to, clams, lobster,<br>
shrimp, crab, and oysters. Other cultured aquatic animals include, but are not limited to<br>

The antigen may be an antigen that is encoded by a nucleic acid vector or it may<br>
be not encoded in a nucleic acid vector. In the former case the nucleic acid vector is<br>
administered to the subject and the antigen is expressed in vivo. In the latter case the<br>
antigen may be administered directly to the subject. An antigen not encoded in a nucleic<br>
acid vector as used herein refers to any type of antigen that is not a nucleic acid. For<br>
instance, in some aspects of the invention the antigen not encoded in a nucleic acid<br><br>
vector is a polypeptide. Minor modifications of the primary amino acid sequences of<br>
polypeptide antigens may also result in a polypeptide which has substantially equivalent<br>
antigenic activity as compared to the unmodified counterpart polypeptide. Such<br>
modifications may be deliberate, as by site-directed mutagenesis, or may be spontaneous.<br>
All of the polypeptides produced by these modifications are included herein as long as<br>
antigenicity still exists. The polypeptide may be, for example, a viral polypeptide.<br>
The term substantially purified as used herein refers to a polypeptide which is<br>
substantially free of other proteins, lipids, carbohydrates or other materials with which it<br>
is naturally associated. One skilled in the art can purify viral or bacterial polypeptides<br>
using standard techniques for protein purification. The substantially pure polypeptide<br>
will often yield a single major band on a non-reducing polyacrylamide gel. In the case of<br>
partially glycosylated polypeptides or those that have several start codons, there may be<br>
several bands on a non-reducing polyacrylamide gel, but these will form a distinctive<br>
pattern for that polypeptide. The purity of the viral or bacterial polypeptide can also be<br>
determined by ammo-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. Other types of antigens not<br>
encoded by a nucleic acid vector such as polysaccharides, small molecule, mimics etc are<br>
described above, and included within the invention.<br>
The invention also utilizes polynucleotides encoding the antigenic polypeptides.<br>
It is envisioned that the antigen may be delivered to the subject in a nucleic acid<br>
molecule which encodes for the antigen such that the antigen must be expressed in vivo.<br>
Such antigens delivered to the subject in a nucleic acid vector are referred to as antigens<br>
encoded by a nucleic acid vector. The nucleic acid encoding the antigen is operatively<br>
linked to a gene expression sequence which directs the expression of the antigen nucleic<br>
acid within a eukaryotic cell. The gene expression sequence is any regulatory nucleotide<br>
sequence, such as a promoter sequence or promoter-enhancer combination, which<br>
facilitates the efficient transcription and translation of the antigen nucleic acid to which it<br>
is operatively linked. The gene expression sequence may, for example, be a mammalian<br>
or viral promoter, such as a constitutive or inducible promoter. Constitutive mammalian<br>
promoters include, but are not limited to, the promoters for the following genes:<br>
hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPTR), adenosine deaminase, pyruvate<br>
kinase, b-actin promoter and other constitutive promoters. Exemplary viral promoters<br>
which function constitutively in eukaryotic cells include, for example, promoters from<br><br>
the cytomegalovjrus (CMV), simian virus (e.g., SV40), papilloma virus, adenovirus,<br>
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Rous sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, the long<br>
terminal repeats (LTR) of Moloney leukemia virus and other retroviruses, and the<br>
thymidine kinase promoter of herpes simplex virus. Other constitutive promoters are<br>
known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The promoters useful as gene expression<br>
sequences of the invention also include inducible promoters. Inducible promoters are<br>
expressed in the presence of an inducing agent. For example, the metallothionein<br>
promoter is induced to promote transcription and translation in the presence of certain<br>
metal ions. Other inducible promoters are known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
In general, the gene expression sequence shall include, as necessary, 5'<br>
non-transcribing and 5' non-translating sequences involved with the initiation of<br>
transcription and translation, respectively, such as a TATA box, capping sequence,<br>
CAAT sequence, and the like. Especially, such 5' non-transcribing sequences will<br>
include a promoter region which includes a promoter sequence for transcriptional control<br>
; of the operably joined antigen nucleic acid. The gene expression sequences optionally<br>
include enhancer sequences or upstream activator sequences as desired.<br>
The antigen nucleic acid is operatively linked to the gene expression sequence.<br>
As used herein, the antigen nucleic acid sequence and the gene expression sequence are<br>
said to be operably linked when they are covalently linked in such a way as to place the<br>
expression or transcription and/or translation of the antigen coding sequence under the<br>
influence or control of the gene expression sequence. Two DNA sequences are said to<br>
be operably linked if induction of a promoter in the 5' gene expression sequence results<br>
in the transcription of the antigen sequence and if the nature of the linkage between the<br>
two DNA sequences does not (1) result in the introduction of a frame-shift mutation, (2)<br>
interfere with the ability of the promoter region to direct the transcription of the antigen<br>
sequence, or (3) interfere with the ability of the corresponding RNA transcript to be<br>
translated into a protein. Thus, a gene expression sequence would be operably linked to<br>
an antigen nucleic acid sequence if the gene expression sequence were capable of<br>
effecting transcription of that antigen nucleic acid sequence such that the resulting<br>
transcript is translated into the desired protein or polypeptide.<br>
The antigen nucleic acid of the invention may be delivered to the immune system<br>
alone or in association with a vector. In its broadest sense, a vector is any vehicle<br><br>
capable of facilitating the transfer of the antigen nucleic acid to the cells of the immune<br>
system so that the antigen can be expressed and presented on the surface of the immune<br>
cell. The vector generally transports the nucleic acid to the immune cells with reduced<br>
degradation relative to the extent of degradation that would result in the absence of the<br>
vector. The vector optionally includes the above-described gene expression sequence to<br>
enhance expression of the antigen nucleic acid in immune cells. In general, the vectors<br>
useful in the invention include, but are not limited to, plasmids, phagemids, viruses,<br>
other vehicles derived from viral or bacterial sources that have been manipulated by the<br>
insertion or incorporation of the antigen nucleic acid sequences. Viral vectors are a<br>
preferred type of vector and include, but are not limited to, nucleic acid sequences from<br>
the following viruses: retrovirus, such as Moloney murine leukemia virus, Harvey<br>
murine sarcoma virus, murine mammary tumor virus, and Rous sarcoma virus;<br>
adenovirus, adeno-associated virus; SV40-type viruses; polyoma viruses; Epstein-Barr<br>
viruses; papilloma viruses; herpes virus; vaccinia virus; polio virus; and RNA virus such<br>
as a retrovirus. One can readily employ other vectors not named but known in the art.<br>
Preferred viral vectors are based on non-cytopathic eukaryotic viruses in which<br>
non-essential genes have been replaced with the gene of interest. Non-cytopathic viruses<br>
include retroviruses, the life cycle of which involves reverse transcription of genomic<br>
viral RNA into DNA with subsequent proviral integration into host cellular DNA.<br>
Retroviruses have been approved for human gene therapy trials. Most useful are those<br>
retroviruses that are replication-deficient (i.e., capable of directing synthesis of the<br>
desired proteins, but incapable of manufacturing an infectious particle). Such genetically<br>
altered retroviral expression vectors have general utility for the high-efficiency<br>
transduction of genes in vivo. Standard protocols for producing replication-deficient<br>
retroviruses (including the steps of incorporation of exogenous genetic material into a<br>
plasmid, transfection of a packaging cell lined with plasmid, production of recombinant<br>
retroviruses by the packaging cell line, collection of viral particles from tissue culture<br>
media, and infection of the target cells with viral particles) are provided in Kriegler, M.,<br>
Gene Transfer and Expression, A Laboratory Manual W.H. Freeman CO., New York<br>
(1990) and Murry, E.J. Methods in Molecular Biology, vol. 7, Humana Press, Inc.,<br>
Cliffton, New Jersey (1991).<br><br>
A preferred virus for certain applications is the adeno-associated virus, a<br>
double-stranded DNA virus. The adeno-associated virus can be engineered to be<br>
replication -deficient and is capable of infecting a wide range of cell types and species.<br>
It further has advantages such as, heat and lipid solvent stability; high transduction<br>
frequencies in cells of diverse lineages, including hemopoietic cells; and lack of<br>
superinfection inhibition thus allowing multiple series of transductions. Reportedly, the<br>
adeno-associated virus can integrate into human cellular DNA in a site-specific manner,<br>
thereby minimizing the possibility of insertional mutagenesis and variability of inserted<br>
gene expression characteristic of retroviral infection. In addition, wild-type<br>
adeno-associated virus infections have been followed in tissue culture for greater than<br>
100 passages in the absence of selective pressure, implying that the adeno-associated<br>
virus genomic integration is a relatively stable event. The adeno-associated virus can<br>
also function in an extrachromosomal fashion.<br>
Other vectors include plasmid vectors. Plasmid vectors have been extensively<br>
described in the art and are well-known to those of skill in the art. See e,g., Sambrook et<br>
ah, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor<br>
Laboratory Press, 1989. In the last few years, plasmid vectors have been found to be<br>
particularly advantageous for delivering genes to cells in vivo because of their inability to<br>
replicate within and integrate into a host genome. These plasmids, however, having a<br>
promoter compatible with the host cell, can express a peptide from a gene operatively<br>
encoded within the plasmid. Some commonly used plasmids include pBR322, pUC18,<br>
pUC19, pRC/CMV, SV40, and pBlueScript. Other plasmids are well-known to those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art. Additionally, plasmids may be custom designed using<br>
restriction enzymes and ligation reactions to remove and add specific fragments of DNA.<br>
It has recently been discovered that gene carrying plasmids can be delivered to<br>
the immune system using bacteria. Modified forms of bacteria such as Salmonella can<br>
be transfected with the plasmid and used as delivery vehicles. The bacterial delivery<br>
vehicles can be administered to a host subject orally or by other administration means.<br>
The bacteria deliver the plasmid to immune cells, e.g. B cells, dendritic cells, likely by<br>
passing through the gut barrier. High levels of immune protection have been established<br>
using this methodology. Such methods of delivery are useful for the aspects of the<br><br>
invention utilizing systemic delivery of antigen, Immunostimulatory nucleic acid and/or<br>
other therapeutic agent.<br>
Thus, the immunostimulatory nucleic acids are useful as vaccine adjuvants. It<br>
was previously established that CpG oligonucleotides are excellent vaccine adjuvants. It<br>
was also demonstrated, however, that CpG ODN which are superb vaccine adjuvants in<br>
mice are not the preferred adjuvants in non-rodent animals. In order to identify the best<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acids for use as a vaccine adjuvant in humans and other non-<br>
rodent animals, in vivo screening of different nucleic acids for this purpose was<br>
conducted. Several in vitro assays were evaluated in mice for their predictive value of<br>
adjuvant activity in vivo in mice. During the course of this study, an in vitro test that is<br>
predictive of in vivo efficacy was identified. It was discovered, rather surprisingly, that<br>
both B cell and NK cell activation correlated particularly well with the ability of an<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acid to enhance an in vivo immune response against an<br>
antigen.<br>
The good predictive value of B cell activation for in vivo vaccine adjuvant<br>
activity is most likely linked to the central role of B cells in the establishment of a<br>
specific immune response. Polyclonal proliferation of B cells (induced by<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acids) increases the likelihood of an antigen specific B cell/T<br>
helper cell match. Furthermore, enhanced expression of the co-stimulatory molecule<br>
CD86 on polyclonally expanded B cells activates antigen specific T helper cells. B cells<br>
also increase their CD40 expression in response to immunostimulatory nucleic acids<br>
improving the capability of CD40L expressing activated T helper cells to stimulate B<br>
cells. Increased ICAM-1 synthesis on B cells facilitates the cell to cell contact. Thus,<br>
the activation status of polyclonal B cells plays a critical role during the initiation of a<br>
specific antibody response.<br>
The contribution of NK cell activity for the establishment of specific antibodies<br>
was, however, surprising. NK cells are part of the innate immune system and as such are<br>
involved in the first line of defense against pathogens. Most likely the cytokine pattern<br>
produced by NK cells upon activation is closely related to the initiation of a specific<br>
immune response. Thus, in one aspect the invention relates to a method of identifying an<br>
adjuvant, by detecting NK cell activation. The NK cell activation assay may be carried<br>
out as described in the Examples below or using other known NK cell activity assays. It<br><br>
is preferred, however that a mixed cell population such as PBMC be used because of the<br>
likelihood that NK cell activation is an indirect effect. The assay is preferably useful for<br>
identifying immunostimulatory nucleic acids which are useful as adjuvants in human and<br>
other non-rodent animals.<br>
Cytokine induction was also identified as an important predictor of in vivo<br>
adjuvant activity. As there is a 2 log higher endotoxin sensitivity of human than mouse<br>
primary monocytes, some caution, however, is required to avoid endotoxin<br>
contamination of immunostimulatory nucleic acids used for testing in the human system<br>
(Hartmann G., and Krieg A. M. 1999. Gene Therapy 6:893). Since TNF-Î±, IL-6 and IL-<br>
12 are produced by human monocytes in response to even low amounts of endotoxin,<br>
their value for high throughput in vitro screening assays is limited. On the other hand,<br>
human B cells and NK cells show only minor activation by endotoxin and thus are far<br>
more useful in testing for immunostimulatory activity.<br>
Stimulation of cellular function in either NK or B cells (i.e., lytic activity,<br>
proliferation) requires a stronger immunostimulatory nucleic acid than the induction of<br>
activation markers at their surface (CD69, CD86). For both cell types, the use of cell<br>
surface activation markers showed a higher nonspecific background attributable to the<br>
phosphorothioate backbone compared to the functional assays. This high sensitivity of<br>
surface markers requires the use of low immunostimulatory nucleic acid concentrations<br>
for optimal discrimination between immunostimulatory nucleic acid of similar activity.<br>
Thus, the use of surface markers allows the comparison of immunostimulatory nucleic<br>
acids with weak activity, while functional assays are preferred for comparing<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acids with high activity. It is of note that the optimal<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acid concentrations for stimulating B cells and NK cells<br>
differ. While 0.6 ug/ml ODN is already maximal to stimulate B cells, optimal NK cell<br>
activation may Tequire 6 ug/ml ODN. Both B cell activation and NK cell functional<br>
activity were measured within freshly isolated PBMC. It was previously found that<br>
highly purified human primary B cells are activated by CpG DNA. The existence of a<br>
direct effect of CpG DNA on NK cells is less clear, and a secondary mechanism<br>
mediated by another cell type within PBMC might contribute to CpG-induced functional<br>
activity of NK cells.<br><br>
The nucleic acids of the invention may be administered to a subject with an anti-<br>
microbial agent. An anti-microbial agent, as used herein, refers to a naturally-occurring<br>
or synthetic compound which is capable of killing or inhibiting infectious<br>
microorganisms. The type of anti-microbial agent useful according to the invention will<br>
depend upon the type of microorganism with which the subject is infected or at risk of<br>
becoming infected. Anti-microbial agents include but are not limited to anti-bacterial<br>
agents, anti-viral agents, anti-fungal agents and anti-parasitic agents. Phrases such as<br>
"anti-infective agent", "anti-bacterial agent", "anti-viral agent", "anti-fungal agent",<br>
"anti-parasitic agent" and "parasiticide" have well-established meanings to those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art and are defined in standard medical texts. Briefly, anti-bacterial<br>
agents kill or inhibit bacteria, and include antibiotics as well as other synthetic or natural<br>
compounds having similar functions. Antibiotics are low molecular weight molecules<br>
which are produced as secondary metabolites by cells, such as microorganisms. In<br>
general, antibiotics interfere with one or more bacterial functions or structures which are<br>
specific for the microorganism and which are not present in host cells. Anti-viral agents<br>
can be isolated from natural sources or synthesized and are useful for killing or inhibiting<br>
viruses. Anti-fungal agents are used to treat superficial fungal infections as well as<br>
opportunistic and primary systemic fungal infections. Anti-parasite agents kill or inhibit<br>
parasites.<br>
Examples of anti-parasitic agents, also referred to as parasiticides useful for<br>
human administration include but are not limited to albendazole, amphotericin B,<br>
benznidazole, bithionol, chloroquine HC1, chloroquine phosphate, clindamycin,<br>
dehydroemetine, diethylcarbamazine, diloxanide furoate, eflornithine, furazolidaone,<br>

Parasiticides used in horses include mebendazole, oxfendazole, febantel,<br>
pyrantel, dichlorvos, trichlorfon, ivermectin, piperazine; for S. wesleri: ivermectin,<br>
benzimiddazoles such as thiabendazole, cambendazole, oxibendazole and fenbendazole.<br>
Useful parasiticides in dogs include milbemycin oxine, ivermectin, pyrantel pamoate and<br>
the combination of ivermectin and pyrantel. The treatment of parasites in swine can<br>
include the use of levamisole, piperazine, pyrantel, thiabendazole, dichlorvos and<br>
fenbendazole. In sheep and goats anthelmintic agents include levamisole or ivermectin.<br>
Caparsolate has shown some efficacy in the treatment of D. immitis (heartworm) in cats.<br>
Antibacterial agents kill or inhibit the growth or function of bacteria. A large<br>
class of antibacterial agents is antibiotics. Antibiotics, which are effective for killing or<br>
inhibiting a wide range of bacteria, are referred to as broad spectrum antibiotics. Other<br>
types of antibiotics are predominantly effective against the bacteria of the class gram-<br>
positive or gram-negative. These types of antibiotics are referred to as narrow spectrum<br>
antibiotics. Other antibiotics which are effective against a single organism or disease<br>
and not against other types of bacteria, are referred to as limited spectrum antibiotics.<br>
Antibacterial agents are sometimes classified based on their primary mode of action. In<br>
general, antibacterial agents are cell wall synthesis inhibitors, cell membrane inhibitors,<br>
protein synthesis inhibitors, nucleic acid synthesis or functional inhibitors, and<br>
competitive inhibitors.<br>

Antiviral agents are compounds which prevent infection of cells by viruses or<br>
replication of the virus within the cell. There are many fewer antiviral drugs than<br>
antibacterial drugs because the process of viral replisation is so closely related to DNA<br>
replication within the host cell, that non-specific antiviral agents would often be toxic to<br>
the host. There are several stages within the process of viral infection which can be<br><br>
blocked or inhibited by antiviral agents. These stages include, attachment of the virus to<br>
the host cell (immunoglobulin or binding peptides), uncoating of the virus (e.g.<br>
amantadine), synthesis or translation of viral mRNA (e.g. interferon), replication of viral<br>
RNA or DNA (e.g. nucleoside analogues), maturation of new virus proteins (e.g.<br>
protease inhibitors), and budding and release of the virus.<br>
Nucleotide analogues are synthetic compounds which are similar to nucleotides,<br>
but which have an incomplete or abnormal deoxyribose or ribose group. Once the<br>
nucleotide analogues are in the cell, they are phosphorylated, producing the triphosphate<br>
formed which competes with normal nucleotides for incorporation into the viral DNA or<br>
RNA. Once the triphosphate form of the nucleotide analogue is incorporated into the<br>
growing nucleic acid chain, it causes irreversible association with the viral polymerase<br>
and thus chain termination. Nucleotide analogues include, but are not limited to,<br>
acyclovir (used for the treatment of herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus),<br>
gancyclovir (useful for the treatment of cytomegalovirus), idoxuridine, ribavirin (useful<br>
for the treatment of respiratory syncitial virus), dideoxyinosine, dideoxycytidine, and<br>
zidovudine (azidothymidine).<br>
The interferons are cytokines which are secreted by virus-infected cells as well as<br>
immune cells. The interferons function by binding to specific receptors on cells adjacent<br>
to the infected cells, causing the change in the cell which protects it from infection by the<br>
virus, a and p-interferon also induce the expression of Class I and Class IIMHC<br>
molecules on the surface of infected cells, resulting in increased antigen presentation for<br>
host immune cell recognition, a and P-interferons are available as recombinant forms<br>
and have been used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B and C infection. At the<br>
dosages which are effective for anti-viral therapy, interferons have severe side effects<br>
such as fever, malaise and weight loss.<br>
Immunoglobulin therapy is used for the prevention of viral infection.<br>
Immunoglobulin therapy for viral infections is different than bacterial infections, because<br>
rather than being antigen-specific, the immunoglobulin therapy functions by binding to<br>
extracellular virions and preventing them from attaching to and entering cells which are<br>
susceptible to the viral infection. The therapy is useful for the prevention of viral<br>
infection for the period of time that the antibodies are present in the host. In general<br>
there are two types of immunoglobulin therapies, normal immunoglobulin therapy and<br><br>
hyper-immunoglobulin therapy. Normal immune globulin therapy utilizes a antibody<br>
product which is prepared from the serum of normal blood donors and pooled. This<br>
pooled product contains low titers of antibody to a wide range of human viruses, such as<br>
hepatitis A, parvovirus, enterovirus (especially in neonates). Hyper-immune globulin<br>
therapy utilizes antibodies which are prepared from the serum of individuals who have<br>
high titers of an antibody to a particular virus. Those antibodies are then used against a<br>
specific virus. Examples of hyper-immune globulins include zoster immune globulin<br>
(useful for the prevention of varicella in immuno-compromised children and neonates),<br>
human rabies immunoglobulin (useful in the post-exposure prophylaxis of a subject<br>
bitten by a rabid animal), hepatitis B immune globulin (useful in the prevention of<br>
hepatitis B virus, especially in a subject exposed to the virus), and RSV immune globulin<br>
(useful in the treatment of respiratory syncitial virus infections).<br>
Another type of immunoglobulin therapy is active immunization. This involves<br>
the administration of antibodies or antibody fragments to viral surface proteins. Two<br>
types of vaccines which are available for active immunization of hepatitis B include<br>
serum-derived hepatitis B antibodies and recombinant hepatitis B antibodies. Both are<br>
prepared from HBsAg. The antibodies are administered in three doses to subjects at high<br>
risk of infection with hepatitis B virus, such as health care workers, sexual partners of<br>
chronic carriers, and infants.<br>
Thus, anti-viral agents useful in the invention include but are not limited to<br>
immunoglobulins, amantadine, interferon, nucleoside analogues, and protease inhibitors.<br>

Anti-fungal agents are useful for the treatment and prevention of infective fungi.<br>
Anti-fungal agents are sometimes classified by their mechanism of action. Some anti-<br>
fungal agents function as cell wall inhibitors by inhibiting glucose synthase. These<br>
include, but are not limited to, basiungin/ECB. Other anti-fungal agents function by<br>
destabilizing membrane integrity. These include, but are not limited to, immidazoles,<br>
such as clotrimazole, sertaconzole, fiuconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, miconazole,<br>
and voriconacole, as well as FK 463, amphotericin B, BAY 38-9502, MK 991,<br>
pradimicin, UK 292, butenafine, and terbinafine. Other anti-fungal agents function by<br>
breaking down chitin (e.g. chitinase) or immunosuppression (501 cream). Some<br>

Immunostimulatory nucleic acids can be combined with other therapeutic agents<br>
such as adjuvants to enhance immune responses. The immunostimulatory nucleic acid<br>
and other therapeutic agent may be administered simultaneously or sequentially. When<br>
the other therapeutic agents are administered simultaneously they can be administered in<br>
the same or separate formulations, but are administered at the same time. The other<br>
therapeutic agents are administered sequentially with one another and with<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acid, when the administration of the other therapeutic agents<br>
and the immunostimulatory nucleic acid is temporally separated. The separation in time<br>
between the administration of these compounds may be a matter of minutes or it may be<br>
longer. Other therapeutic agents include but are not limited to adjuvants, cytokines,<br>
antibodies, antigens, etc.<br>
The immunostimulatory nucleic acids are useful as adjuvants for inducing a<br>
systemic immune response. Thus either can be delivered to a subject exposed to an<br>
antigen to produce an enhanced immune response to the antigen.<br>
In addition to the immunostimulatory nucleic acids, the compositions of the<br>
invention may also be administered with non-nucleic acid adjuvants. A non-nucleic acid<br>
adjuvant is any molecule or compound except for the immunostimulatory nucleic acids<br>
described herein which can stimulate the humoral and/or cellular immune response.<br><br>
Non-nucleic acid adjuvants include, for instance, adjuvants that create a depo effect,<br>
immune stimulating adjuvants, and adjuvants that create a depo effect and stimulate the<br>
immune system.<br>
An adjuvant that creates a depo effect as used herein is an adjuvant that causes<br>
the antigen to be slowly released in the body, thus prolonging the exposure of immune<br>
cells to the antigen. This class of adjuvants includes but is not limited to alum (e.g.,<br>
aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate); or emulsion-based formulations including<br>
mineral oil, non-mineral oil, water-in-oil or oil-in-water-in oil emulsion, oil-in-water<br>
emulsions such as Seppic ISA series of Montanide adjuvants (e.g., Montanide ISA 720,<br>
AirLiquide, Paris, France); MF-59 (a squalene-in-water emulsion stabilized with Span 85<br>
and Tween 80; Chiron Corporation, Emeryville, CA; and PRO VAX (an oil-in-water<br>
emulsion containing a stabilizing detergent and a micelle-forming agent; IDEC,<br>
Pharmaceuticals Corporation, San Diego, CA).<br>
An immune stimulating adjuvant is an adjuvant that causes activation of a cell of<br>
the immune system. It may, for instance, cause an immune cell to produce and secrete<br>
cytokines. This class of adjuvants includes but is not limited to saponins purified from<br>
the bark of the Q. saponaria tree, such as QS21 (a glycolipid that elutes in the 21st peak<br>
with HPLC fractionation; Aquila Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., Worcester, MA);<br>
poly[di(carboxylatophenoxy)phosphazene (PCPP polymer; Virus Research Institute,<br>
USA); derivatives of lipopolysaccharides such as monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL; Ribi<br>
ImmunoChem Research, Inc., Hamilton, MT), muramyl dipeptide (MDP; Ribi) and<br>
threonyl-muramyl dipeptide (t-MDP; Ribi); OM-174 (a glucosamine disaccharide related<br>
to lipid A; OM Pharma SA, Meyrin, Switzerland); and Leishmania elongation factor (a<br>
purified Leishmania protein; Corixa Corporation, Seattle, WA).<br>
Adjuvants that create a depo effect and stimulate the immune system are those<br>
compounds which have both of the above- identified functions. This class of adjuvants<br>
includes but is not limited to ISCOMS (Immunostimulating complexes which contain<br>
mixed saponins, lipids and form virus-sized particles with pores that can hold antigen;<br>
CSL, Melbourne, Australia); SB-AS2 (SmithKline Beecham adjuvant system #2 which<br>
is an oil-in-water emulsion containing MPL and QS21: SmithKline Beecham Biologicals<br>
[SBB], Rixensart, Belgium); SB-AS4 (SmithKline Beecham adjuvant system #4 which<br>
contains alum and MPL; SBB, Belgium); non-ionic block copolymers that form micelles<br><br>
such as CRL 1005 (these contain a linear chain of hydrophobic polyoxpropylene flanked<br>
by chains of polyoxyethylene; Vaxcel, Inc., Norcross, GA); and Syntex Adjuvant<br>
Formulation (SAF, an oil-in-water emulsion containing Tween 80 and a nonionic block<br>
copolymer; Syntex Chemicals, Inc., Boulder, CO).<br>
The immunostimulatory nucleic acids are also useful as mucosal adjuvants. It<br>
has previously been discovered that both systemic and mucosal immunity are induced by<br>
mucosal delivery of CpG nucleic acids. The systemic immunity induced in response to<br>
CpG nucleic acids included both humoral and cell-mediated responses to specific<br>
antigens that were not capable of inducing systemic immunity when administered alone<br>
to the mucosa. Furthermore, both CpG nucleic acids and cholera toxin (CT, a mucosal<br>
adjuvant that induces a Th2-like response) induced CTL. This was surprising since with<br>
systemic immunization, the presence of Th2-like antibodies is normally associated with a<br>
lack of CTL (Schirmbeck et al, 1995). Based on the results presented herein it is<br>
expected that the immunostimulatory nucleic acids will function in a similar manner.<br>
Additionally, the immunostimulatory nucleic acids induce a mucosal response at<br>
both local (e.g., lung) and remote (e.g., lower digestive tract) mucosal sites. Significant<br>
levels of IgA antibodies are induced at distant mucosal sites by the immunostimulatory<br>
nucleic acids. CT is generally considered to be a highly effective mucosal adjuvant. As<br>
has been previously reported (Snider 1995), CT induces predominantly IgGl isotype of<br>
antibodies, which are indicative of Th2-type response. In contrast, the<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acids are more Thl with predominantly IgG2a antibodies,<br>
especially after boost or when the two adjuvants are combined. Thl-type antibodies in<br>
general have better neutralizing capabilities, and furthermore, a Th2 response in the lung<br>
is highly undesirable because it is associated with asthma (Kay, 1996, Hogg, 1997).<br>
Thus the use of immunostimulatory nucleic acids as a mucosal adjuvant has benefits that<br>
other mucosal adjuvants cannot achieve. The immunostimulatory nucleic acids of the<br>
invention also are useful as mucosal adjuvants for induction of both a systemic and a<br>
mucosal immune response.<br>
Mucosal adjuvants referred to as non-nucleic acid mucosal adjuvants may also be<br>
administered with the Immunostimulatory nucleic acids. A non-nucleic acid mucosal<br>
adjuvant as used herein is an adjuvant other than a immunostimulatory nucleic acid that<br>
is capable of inducing a mucosal immune response in a subject when administered to a<br><br>
mucosal surface in conjunction with an antigen. Mucosal adjuvants include but are not<br>
limited to Bacterial toxins e.g., Cholera toxin (CT), CT derivatives including but not<br>
limited to CT B subunit (CTB) (Wu et al., 1998, Tochikubo et al., 1998); CTD53 (Val to<br>
Asp) (Fontana et al., 1995); CTK97 (Val to Lys) (Fontana et al., 1995); CTK104 (Tyr to<br>

(Douce et al., 1997, Fontana et al., 1995); and CTK63 (Ser to Lys) (Douce et al., 1997,<br>
Fontana et al., 1995), Zonula occludens toxin, zot, Escherichia coli heat-labile<br>
enterotoxin, Labile Toxin (LT), LT derivatives including but not limited to LT B subunit<br>
(LTB) (Verweij et al., 1998); LT7K (Arg to Lys) (Komase et al., 1998, Douce et al.,<br>
1995); LT61F (Ser to Phe) (Komase et al., 1998); LT112K (Glu to Lys) (Komase et al.,<br>
1998); LT118E (Gly to Glu) (Komase et al., 1998); LT146E (Arg to Glu) (Komase et al.,<br>
1998); LT192G (Arg to Gly) (Komase et al., 1998); LTK63 (Ser to Lys) (Marchetti et<br>
al., 1998, Douce et al., 1997,1998, Di Tommaso et al., 1996); and LTR72 (Ala to Arg)<br>
(Giuliani et al., 1998), Pertussis toxin, PT. (Lycke et al., 1992", Spangler BD, 1992,<br>
Freytag and Clemments, 1999, Roberts et al., 1995, Wilson et al., 1995) including PT-<br>
9K/129G (Roberts et al., 1995, Cropley et al., 1995); Toxin derivatives (see below)<br>
(Holmgren et al., 1993, Verweij et al., 1998, Rappuoli et al., 1995, Freytag and<br>
Clements, 1999); Lipid A derivatives (e.g., monophosphoryl lipid A, MPL) (Sasaki et al.,<br>
1998, Vancott et al., 1998; Muramyl Dipeptide (MDP) derivatives (Fukushima et al.,<br>
1996, Ogawa et al., 1989, Michalek et al., 1983, Morisaki et al., 1983); Bacterial outer<br>
membrane proteins (e.g., outer surface protein A (OspA) lipoprotein of Borrelia<br>
burgdorferi, outer membrane protine of Neisseria meningitidis)(Mairinaio et al., 1999,<br>
Van de Verg et al., 1996); Oil-in-water emulsions (e.g., MF59) (Barchfield et al., 1999,<br>
Verschoor et al., 1999,0'Hagan, 1998); Aluminum salts (Isaka et al., 1998,1999); and<br>
Saponins (e.g., QS21) Aquila Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., Worster, MA) (Sasaki et al.,<br>
1998, MacNeal et al., 1998), ISCOMS, MF-59 (a squalene-in-water emulsion stabilized<br>
with Span 85 and Tween 80; Chiron Corporation, Emeryville, CA); the Seppic ISA<br>
series of Montanide adjuvants (e.g., Montanide ISA 720; AirLiquide, Paris, France);<br>
PROVAX (an oil-in-water emulsion containing a stabilizing detergent and a micelle-<br><br>
forming agent; IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation, San Diego, CA); Syntext Adjuvant<br>
Formulation (SAP; Syntex Chemicals, Inc., Boulder, CO);<br>
poly[di(carboxylatophenoxy)phosphazene (PCPP polymer; Virus Research Institute,<br>
USA) and Leishmania elongation factor (Corixa Corporation, Seattle, WA)_<br>
Immune responses can also be induced or augmented by the co-administration or<br>
co-linear expression of cytokines (Bueler &amp; Mulligan, 1996; Chow et al, 1997; Geissler<br>
et al, 1997; Iwasaki et al, 1997; Kim et al, 1997) or B-7 co-stimulatory molecules<br>
(Iwasaki et al, 1997; Tsuji et al, 1997) with the Immunostimulatory nucleic acids. The<br>
cytokines can be administered directly with Immunostimulatory nucleic acids or may be<br>
administered in the form of a nucleic acid vector that encodes the cytokine, such that the<br>
cytokine can be expressed in vivo. In one embodiment, the cytokine is administered in<br>
the form of a plasmid expression vector. The term cytokine is used as a generic name for<br>
a diverse group of soluble proteins and peptides which act as humoral regulators at nano-<br>
to picomolar concentrations and which, either under normal or pathological conditions,<br>
modulate the functional activities of individual cells and tissues. These proteins also<br>
mediate interactions between cells directly and regulate processes taking place in the<br>
extracellular environment. Examples of cytokines include, but are not limited to IL-1,<br>
IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, granulocyte-macrophage colony<br>
stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferon-<br>
Î³ (Î³-IFN), IFN-Î±, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), TGF-p, FLT-3 ligand, and CD40 ligand.<br>
Cytokines play a role in directing the T cell response. Helper (CD4+) T cells<br>
orchestrate the immune response of mammals through production of soluble factors that<br>
act on other immune system cells, including other T cells. Most mature CD4+ T helper<br>
cells express one of two cytokine profiles: Thl or Th2. The Thl subset promotes<br>
delayed-type hypersensitivity, cell-mediated immunity, and immunoglobulin class<br>
switching to IgG2a. The Th2 subset induces humoral immunity by activating B cells,<br>
promoting antibody production, and inducing class switching to IgG1 and IgE. In some<br>
embodiments, it is preferred that the cytokine be a Thl cytokine.<br>
The nucleic acids are also useful for redirecting an immune response from a Th2<br>
immune response to a Thl immune response. Redirection of an immune response from a<br>
Th2 to a Thl immune response can be assessed by measuring the levels of cytokines<br>
produced in response to the nucleic acid (e.g., by inducing monocytic cells and other<br><br>
cells to produce Thl cytokines, including IL-12, IFN-y and GM-CSF). The redirection<br>
or rebalance of the immune response from a Th2 to a Thl response is particularly useful<br>
for the treatment or prevention of asthma. For instance, an effective amount for treating<br>
asthma can be that amount; useful for redirecting a Th2 type of immune response that is<br>
associated with asthma to a Thl type of response. Th2 cytokines, especially IL-4 and IL-<br>
5 are elevated in the airways of asthmatic subjects. These cytokines promote important<br>
aspects of the asthmatic inflammatory response, including IgE isotype switching,<br>
eosinophil chemotaxis and activation and mast cell growth. Thl cytokines, especially<br>
IFN-y and IL-12, can suppress the formation of Th2 clones and production of Th2<br>
cytokines. The immunostimulatory nucleic acids of the invention cause an increase in<br>
Thl cytokines which helps to rebalance the immune system, preventing or reducing the<br>
adverse effects associated with a predominately Th2 immune response.<br>
The nucleic acids are also useful for improving survival, differentiation,<br>
activation and maturation of dendritic cells. The immunostimulatory nucleic acids have<br>
the unique capability to promote cell survival, differentiation, activation and maturation<br>
of dendritic cells. Dendritic precursor cells isolated from blood by immunomagnetic cell<br>
sorting develop morphologic and functional characteristics of dendritic cells during a two<br>
day incubation with GM-CSF. Without GM-CSF these cells undergo apoptosis. The<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acids are superior to GM-CSF in promoting survival and<br>
differentiation of dendritic cells (MHCII expression, cell size, granularity). The<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acids also induce maturation of dendritic cells. Since<br>
dendritic cells form the link between the innate and the acquired immune system, by<br>
presenting antigens as well as through their expression of pattern recognition receptors<br>
which detect microbial molecules like LPS in their local environment, the ability to<br>
activate dendritic cells with immunostimulatory nucleic acids supports the use of these<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acid based strategies for in vivo and ex-vivo immunotherapy<br>
against disorders such as cancer and allergic or infectious diseases. The<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acids are also useful for activating and inducing maturation<br>
of dendritic cells.<br>
Immunostimulatory nucleic acids also increase natural killer cell lytic activity<br>
and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). ADCC can be performed using a<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acid in combination with an antibody specific for a cellular<br><br>
target, such as a cancer cell. When the immunostimulatory nucleic acid is administered<br>
to a subject in conjunction with the antibody the subject's immune system is induced to<br>
kill the tumor cell. The antibodies useful in the ADCC procedure include antibodies<br>
which interact with a cell in the hody. Many such antibodies specific for cellular targets<br>
have been described in the art and many are commercially available. Examples of these<br>
antibodies are listed below among the list of cancer immunotherapies.<br>
The immunostimulatory nucleic acids may also be administered in conjunction<br>
with an anti-cancer therapy. Anti-cancer therapies include cancer medicaments,<br>
radiation and surgical procedures. As used herein, a "cancer medicament" refers to a<br>
agent which is administered to a subject for the purpose of treating a cancer. As used<br>
herein, "treating cancer" includes preventing the development of a cancer, reducing the<br>
symptoms of cancer, and/or inhibiting the growth of an established cancer. In other<br>
aspects, the cancer medicament is administered to a subject at risk of developing a cancer<br>
for the purpose of reducing the risk of developing the cancer. Various types of<br>
medicaments for the treatment of cancer are described herein. For the purpose of this<br>
specification, cancer medicaments are classified as chemotherapeutic agents,<br>
immunotherapeutic agents, cancer vaccines, hormone therapy, and biological response<br>
modifiers.<br>

methods of the invention are intended to embrace the use of more than one cancer<br>
medicament along with the immunostimulatory nucleic acids. As an example, where<br>
appropriate, the immunostimulatory nucleic acids may be administered with a both a<br>
chemotherapeutic agent and an immunotherapeutic agent. Alternatively, the cancer<br>
medicament may embrace an immunotherapeutic agent and a cancer vaccine, or a<br><br>
chemotherapeutic agent and a cancer vaccine, or a chemotherapeutic agent, an<br>
immunotherapeutic agent and a cancer vaccine all administered to one subject for the<br>
purpose of treating a subject having a cancer or at risk of developing a cancer.<br>
Cancer medicaments function in a variety of ways. Some cancer medicaments<br>
work by targeting physiological mechanisms that are specific to tumor cells. Examples<br>
include the targeting of specific genes and their gene products (i.e., proteins primarily)<br>
which are mutated in cancers. Such genes include but are not limited to oncogenes (e.g.,<br>
Ras, Her2, bcl-2), tumor suppressor genes (e.g., EGF, p53, Rb), and cell cycle targets<br>
(e.g., CDK4, p21, telomerase). Cancer medicaments can alternately target signal<br>
transduction pathways and molecular mechanisms which are altered in cancer cells.<br>
Targeting of cancer cells via the epitopes expressed on their cell surface is accomplished<br>
through the use of monoclonal antibodies. This latter type of cancer medicament is<br>
generally referred to herein as immunotherapy.<br>
Other cancer medicaments target cells other than cancer cells. For example,<br>
some medicaments prime the immune system to attack tumor cells (i.e., cancer<br>
vaccines). Still other medicaments, called angiogenesis inhibitors, function by attacking<br>
the blood supply of solid tumors. Since the most malignant cancers are able to<br>
metastasize (i.e., exist the primary tumor site and seed a distal tissue, thereby forming a<br>
secondary tumor), medicaments that impede this metastasis are also useful in the<br>
treatment of cancer. Angiogenic mediators include basic FGF, VEGF, angiopoietins,<br>
angiostatin, endostatin, TNFoc, TNP-470, thrombospandin-l, platelet factor 4, CAI, and<br>
certain members of the integrin family of proteins. One category of this type of<br>
medicament is a metalloproteinase inhibitor, which inhibits the enzymes used by the<br>
cancer cells to exist the primary tumor site and extravasate into another tissue.<br>
Some cancer cells are antigenic and thus can be targeted by the immune system.<br>
In one aspect, the combined administration of immunostimulatory nucleic acids and<br>
cancer medicaments, particularly those which are classified as cancer immunotherapies,<br>
is useful for stimulating a specific immune response against a cancer antigen. A "cancer<br>
antigen" as used herein is a compound, such as a peptide, associated with a tumor or<br>
cancer cell surface and which is capable of provoking an immune response when<br>
expressed on the surface of an antigen presenting cell in the context of an MHC<br>
molecule. Cancer antigens, such as those present in cancer vaccines or those used to<br><br>
prepare cancer immunotherapies, can be prepared from crude cancer cell extracts, as<br>
described in Cohen, et al., 1994, Cancer Research, 54:1055, or by partially purifying the<br>
antigens, using recombinant technology, or de novo synthesis of known antigens.<br>
Cancer antigens can be used in the form of immunogenic portions of a particular antigen<br>
or in some instances a whole cell or a tumor mass can be used as the antigen. Such<br>
antigens can be isolated or prepared recombinantly or by any other means known in the<br>
art.<br>
The theory of immune surveillance is that a prime function of the immune system<br>
is to detect and eliminate neoplastic cells before a tumor forms. A basic principle of this<br>
theory is that cancer cells are antigenically different from normal cells and thus elicit<br>
immune reactions that are similar to those that cause rejection of immunologically<br>
incompatible allografts. Studies have confirmed that tumor cells differ, either<br>
qualitatively or quantitatively, in their expression of antigens. For example, "tumor-<br>
specific antigens" are antigens that are specifically associated with tumor cells but not<br>
normal cells. Examples of tumor specific antigens are viral antigens in tumors induced<br>
by DNA or RNA viruses. "Tumor-associated" antigens are present in both tumor cells<br>
and normal cells but are present in a different quantity or a different form in tumor cells.<br>
Examples of such antigens are oncofetal antigens (e.g., carcinoembryonic antigen),<br>
differentiation antigens (e.g., T and Tn antigens), and oncogene products (e.g.,<br>
HERAieu).<br>
Different types of cells that can kill tumor targets in vitro and in vivo have been<br>
identified: natural killer cells (NK cells), cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs), lymphokine-<br>
activated killer cells (LAKs), and activated macrophages. NK cells can kill tumor cells<br>
without having been previously sensitized to specific antigens, and the activity does not<br>
require the presence of class I antigens encoded by the major histocompatibility complex<br>
(MHC) on target cells. NK cells are thought to participate in the control of nascent<br>
tumors and in the control of metastatic growth. In contrast to NK cells, CTLs can kill<br>
tumor cells only after they have been sensitized to tumor antigens and when the target<br>
antigen is expressed on the tumor cells that also express MHC class I. CTLs are thought<br>
to be effector cells in the rejection of transplanted tumors and of tumors caused by DNA<br>
viruses. LAK cells are a subset of null lymphocytes distinct from the NK and CTL<br>
populations. Activated macrophages can kill tumor cells in a manner that is not antigen<br><br>
dependent nor MHC restricted once activated. Activated macrophages are through to<br>
decrease the growth rate of the tumors they infiltrate. In vitro assays have identified<br>
other immune mechanisms such as antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxic<br>
reactions and lysis by antibody plus complement. However, these immune effector<br>
mechanisms are thought to be less important in vivo than the function of NK, CTLs,<br>
LAK, and macrophages in vivo (for review see Piessens, W.F., and David, J., "Tumor<br>
Immunology", In: Scientific American Medicine. Vol. 2, Scientific American Books,<br>
N.Y.,pp. 1-13,1996.<br>
The goal of immunotherapy is to augment a patient's immune response to an<br>
established tumor. One method of immunotherapy includes the use of adjuvants.<br>
Adjuvant substances derived from microorganisms, such as bacillus Calmette-Guerin,<br>
heighten the immune response and enhance resistance to tumors in animals.<br>
Immunotherapeutic agents are medicaments which derive from antibodies or<br>
antibody fragments which specifically bind or recognize a cancer antigen. As used<br>
herein a cancer antigen is broadly defined as an antigen expressed by a cancer cell.<br>
Preferably, the antigen is expressed at the cell surface of the cancer cell. Even more<br>
preferably, the antigen is one which is not expressed by normal cells, or at least not<br>
expressed to the same level as in cancer cells. Antibody-based immunotherapies may<br>
function by binding to the cell surface of a cancer cell and thereby stimulate the<br>
endogenous immune system to attack the cancer cell. Another way in which antibody-<br>
based therapy functions is as a delivery system for the specific targeting of toxic<br>
substances to cancer cells. Antibodies are usually conjugated to toxins such as ricin<br>
(e.g., from castor beans), calicheamicin and maytansinoids, to radioactive isotopes such<br>
as Iodine-131 and Yttrium-90, to chemotherapeutic agents (as described herein), or to<br>
biological response modifiers. In this way, the toxic substances can be concentrated in<br>
the region of the cancer and non-specific toxicity to normal cells can be minimized. In<br>
addition to the use of antibodies which are specific for cancer antigens, antibodies which<br>
bind to vasculature, such as those which bind to endothelial cells, are also useful in the<br>
invention. This is because generally solid tumors are dependent upon newly formed<br>
blood vessels to survive, and thus most tumors are capable of recruiting and stimulating<br>
the growth of new blood vessels. As a result, one strategy of many cancer medicaments<br><br>
is to attack the blood vessels feeding a tumor and/or the connective tissues (or stroma)<br>
supporting such blood vessels.<br>
The use of immunostimulatory nucleic acids in conjunction with<br>
immunotherapeutic agents such as monoclonal antibodies is able to increase long-term<br>
survival through a number of mechanisms including significant enhancement of ADCC<br>
(as discussed above), activation of natural killer (NK) cells and an increase in IFNÎ±<br>
levels. The nucleic acids when used in combination with monoclonal antibodies serve to<br>
reduce the dose of the antibody required to achieve a biological result.<br>
Examples of cancer immunotherapies which are currently being used or which<br>
are in development are listed in Table C.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Yet other types of chemotherapeutic agents which can be used according to the<br>
invention include Aminoglutethimide, Asparaginase, Busulfan, Carboplatin,<br>
Chlorombucil, Cytarabine HCI, Dactinomycin, Daunorubicin HC1, Estramustine<br>
phosphate sodium, Etoposide (VP16-213), Floxuridine, Fluorouracil (5-FU), Flutamide,<br>
Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide), Ifosfamide, Interferon Alfa-2a, Alfa-2b, Leuprolide<br>
acetate (LHRH-releasing factor analogue), Lomustine (CCNU), Mechlorethamine HCI<br>
(nitrogen mustard), Mercaptopurine, Mesna, Mitotane (o.p'-DDD), Mitoxantrone HCI,<br>
Octreotide, Plicamycin, Procarbazine HCI, Streptozocin, Tamoxifen citrate,<br>
Thioguanine, Thiotepa, Vinblastine sulfate, Amsacrine (m-AMSA), Azacitidine,<br>
Erthropoietin, Hexamethylmelamine (HMM), Interleukin 2, Mitoguazone (methyl-GAG;<br>
methyl glyoxal bis-guanylhydrazone; MGBG), Pentostatin (2'deoxycoformycin),<br>
Semustine (methyl-CCNU), Teniposide (VM-26) and Vindesine suifate.<br>
Cancer vaccines are medicaments which are intended to stimulate an endogenous<br>
immune response against cancer cells. Currently produced vaccines predominantly<br>
activate the humoral immune system (i.e., the antibody dependent immune response).<br>
Other vaccines currently in development are focused on activating the cell-mediated<br>
immune system including cytotoxic T lymphocytes which are capable of killing tumor<br>
cells. Cancer vaccines generally enhance the presentation of cancer antigens to both<br>
antigen presenting cells (e.g., macrophages and dendritic cells) and/or to other immune<br>
cells such as T cells, B cells, and NK cells.<br>
Although cancer vaccines may take one of several forms, as discussed infra, their<br>
purpose is to deliver cancer antigens and/or cancer associated antigens to antigen<br>
presenting cells (APC) in order to facilitate the endogenous processing of such antigens<br>
by APC and the ultimate presentation of antigen presentation on the cell surface in the<br>
context of MHC class I molecules. One form of cancer vaccine is a whole cell vaccine<br>
which is a preparation of cancer cells which have been removed from a subject, treated<br>
ex vivo and then reintroduced as whole cells in the subject. Lysates of tumor cells can<br><br>
also be used as cancer vaccines to elicit an immune response. Another form cancer<br>
vaccine is a peptide vaccine which uses cancer-specific or cancer-associated small<br>
proteins to activate T cells. Cancer-associated proteins are proteins which are not<br>
exclusively expressed by cancer cells (i.e., other normal cells may still express these<br>
antigens). However, the expression of cancer-associated antigens is generally<br>
consistently upregulated with cancers of a particular type. Yet another form of cancer<br>
vaccine is a dendritic cell vaccine which includes whole dendritic cells which have been<br>
exposed to a cancer antigen or a cancer-associated antigen in vitro. Lysates or<br>
membrane fractions of dendritic cells may also be used as cancer vaccines. Dendritic<br>
cell vaccines are able to activate antigen-presenting cells directly. Other cancer vaccines<br>
include ganglioside vaccines, heat-shock protein vaccines, viral and bacterial vaccines,<br>
and nucleic acid vaccines.<br>
The use of immunostimulatory nucleic acids in conjunction with cancer vaccines<br>
provides an improved antigen-specific humoral and cell mediated immune response, in<br>
addition to activating NK cells and endogenous dendritic cells, and increasing IFNcc<br>
levels. This enhancement allows a vaccine with a reduced antigen dose to be used to<br>
achieve the same beneficial effect. In some instances, cancer vaccines may be used<br>
along with adjuvants, such as those described above.<br>
As used herein, the terms "cancer antigen" and "tumor antigen" are used<br>
interchangeably to refer to antigens which are differentially expressed by cancer cells<br>
and can thereby be exploited in order to target cancer cells. Cancer antigens are antigens<br>
which can potentially stimulate apparently tumor-specific immune responses. Some of<br>
these antigens are encoded, although not necessarily expressed, by normal cells. These<br>
antigens can be characterized as those which are normally silent (i.e., not expressed) in<br>
normal cells, those that are expressed only at certain stages of differentiation and those<br>
that are temporally expressed such as embryonic and fetal antigens. Other cancer<br>
antigens are encoded by mutant cellular genes, such as oncogenes (e.g., activated ras<br>
oncogene), suppressor genes (e.g., mutant p53), fusion proteins resulting from internal<br>
deletions or chromosomal translocations. Still other cancer antigens can be encoded by<br>
viral genes such as those carried on RNA and DNA tumor viruses.<br>
Other vaccines take the form of dendritic cells which have been exposed to<br>
cancer antigens in vitro, have processed the antigens and are able to express the cancer<br><br>
antigens at their cell surface in the context of MHC molecules for effective antigen<br>
presentation to other immune system cells.<br>
The immunostimulatory nucleic acids are used in one aspect of the invention in<br>
conjunction with cancer vaccines which are dendritic cell based. A dendritic-cell is a<br>
professional antigen presenting cell. Dendritic cells form the link between the innate and<br>
the acquired immune system by presenting antigens and through their expression of<br>
pattern recognition receptors which detect microbial molecules like LPS in their local<br>
environment. Dendritic cells efficiently internalize, process, and present soluble specific<br>
antigen to which it is exposed. The process of internalizing and presenting antigen<br>
causes rapid upregulation of the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)<br>
and costimulatory molecules, the production of cytokines, and migration toward<br>
lymphatic organs where they are believed to be involved in the activation of T cells.<br>
Table D lists a variety of cancer vaccines which are either currently being used or<br>
are in development.<br><br><br><br>
As used herein, chemotherapeutic agents embrace all other forms of cancer<br>
medicaments which do not fall into the categories of immunotherapeutic agents or cancer<br>
vaccines. Chemotherapeutic agents as used herein encompass both chemical and<br>
biological agents. These agents function to inhibit a cellular activity which the cancer<br>
cell is dependent upon for continued survival. Categories of chemotherapeutic agents<br>
include alkylating/alkaloid agents, antimetabolites, hormones or hormone analogs, and<br>
miscellaneous antineoplastic drugs. Most if not all of these agents are directly toxic to<br>
cancer cells and do not require immune stimulation. Combination chemotherapy and<br><br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acid administration increases the maximum tolerable dose of<br>
chemotherapy.<br>
Chemotherapeutic agents which are currently in development or in use in a<br>
clinical setting are shown in Table E.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
administration of some immunostimulatory nucleic acids, these nucleic acids can be used<br>
to generate IFNÎ± endogenously.<br>
The invention also includes a method for inducing antigen non-specific innate<br>
immune activation and broad spectrum resistance to infectious challenge using the<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acids. The term antigen non-specific innate immune<br>
activation as used herein refers to the activation of immune cells other than B cells and<br>
for instance can include the activation of NK cells, T cells or other immune cells that can<br>
respond in an antigen independent fashion or some combination of these cells. A broad<br>
spectrum resistance to infectious challenge is induced because the immune cells are in<br>
active form and are primed to respond to any invading compound or microorganism.<br>
The cells do not have to be specifically primed against a particular antigen. This is<br>
particularly useful in biowarfare, and the other circumstances described above such as<br>
travelers.<br>
The stimulation index of a particular immunostimulatory nucleic acid can be<br>
tested in various immune cell assays. Preferably, the stimulation index of the<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acid with regard to B cell proliferation is at least about 5,<br>
preferably at least about 10, more preferably at least about 15 and most preferably at<br>
least about 20 as determined by incorporation of 3H uridine in a murine B cell culture,<br>
which has been contacted with 20 uM of nucleic acid for 20h at 37Â°C and has been<br>
pulsed with 1 ï­Ci of 3H uridine; and harvested and counted 4h later as described in detail<br>
in PCT Published Patent Applications PCT/US95/01570 (WO 96/02555) and<br>
PCT/US97/19791 (WO 98/18810) claiming priority to U.S. Serial Nos. 08/386,063 and<br>
08/960,774, filed on February 7, 1995 and October 30,1997 respectively. For use in<br>
vivo, for example, it is important that the immunostimulatory nucleic acids be capable of<br>
effectively inducing an immune response, such as, for example, antibody production.<br>
Immunostimulatory nucleic acids are effective in non-rodent vertebrate.<br>
Different immunostimulatory nucleic acid can cause optimal immune stimulation<br>
depending on the type of subject and the sequence of the immunostimulatory nucleic<br>
acid. Many vertebrates have been found according to the invention to be responsive to<br>
the same class of immunostimulatory nucleic acids, sometimes referred to as human<br>
specific immunostimulatory nucleic acids. Rodents, however, respond to different<br>
nucleic acids. As shown herein an immunostimulatory nucleic acid causing optimal "<br><br>
stimulation in humans may not generally cause optimal stimulation in a mouse and vice<br>
versa. An immunostimulatory nucleic acid causing optimal stimulation in humans often<br>
does, however, cause optimal stimulation in other animals such as cow, horses, sheep,<br>
etc. One of skill in the art can identify the optimal nucleic acid sequences useful for a<br>
particular species of interest using routine assays described herein and/or known in the<br>
art, using the guidance supplied herein.<br>
The immunostimulatory nucleic acids may be directly administered to the subject<br>
or may be administered in conjunction with a nucleic acid delivery complex. A nucleic<br>
acid delivery complex shall mean a nucleic acid molecule associated with (e.g. ionically<br>
or covalently bound to; or encapsulated within) a targeting means (e.g. a molecule that<br>
results in higher affinity binding to target cell (e.g., B cell surfaces and/or increased<br>
cellular uptake by target cells). Examples of nucleic acid delivery complexes include<br>
nucleic acids associated with a sterol (e.g. cholesterol), a lipid (e.g. a cationic Iipid,<br>
virosome or liposome), or a target cell specific binding agent (e.g. a ligand recognized by<br>
target cell specific receptor). Preferred complexes may be sufficiently stable in vivo to<br>
prevent significant uncoupling prior to internalization by the target cell. However, the<br>
complex can be cleavable under appropriate conditions within the cell so that the nucleic<br>
acid is released in a functional form.<br>
Delivery vehicles or delivery devices for delivering antigen and nucleic acids to<br>
surfaces have been described. The Immunostimulatory nucleic acid and/or the antigen<br>
and/or other therapeutics may be administered alone (e.g., in saline or buffer) or using<br>
any delivery vehicles known in the art. For instance the following delivery vehicles have<br>
been described: Cochleates (Gould-Fogerite et al., 1994,1996); Emulsomes (Vancott et<br>
al., 1998, Lowell et al., 1997); ISCOMs (Mowat et al., 1993, Carlsson et al., 1991, Hu<br>
et., 1998, Morein et al., 1999); Liposomes (Childers et al., 1999, Michalek etal., 1989,<br>
1992, de Haan 1995a, 1995b); Live bacterial vectors (e.g., Salmonella, Escherichia coli,<br>
Bacillus calmatte-guerin, Shigella, Lactobacillus) (Hone et al., 1996, Pouwels et al.,<br>
1998, Chatfield et al., 1993, Stover et al., 1991, Nugent et al., 1998); Live viral vectors<br>
(e.g., Vaccinia, adenovirus, Herpes Simplex) (Gallichan et al., 1993, 1995, Moss et al.,<br>
1996, Nugent et al., 1998, Flexner et al., 1988, Morrow et al., 1999); Microspheres<br>
(Gupta et al., 1998, Jones et al., 1996, Maloy et al., 1994, Moore et al., 1995, O'Hagan et<br>
al., 1994, Eldridge et al., 1989); Nucleic acid vaccines (Fynan et al., 1993, Kuklin et al.,<br><br>
1997, Sasaki et al., 1998, Okada et al., 1997, Ishii et al., 1997); Polymers (e.g.<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, chitosan) (Hamajima et al., 1998, Jabbal-Gill et al., 1998);<br>
Polymer rings (Wyatt et al., 1998); Proteosomes (Vancott et al., 1998, Lowell et al.,<br>
1988, 1996, 1997); Sodium Fluoride (Hashi et al., 1998); Transgenic plants (Tacket et<br>
al., 1998, Mason et al., 1998, Haq et al., 1995); Virosomes (Gluck et al., 1992,<br>
Mengiardi et al., 1995, Cryz et al., 1998); Virus-like particles (Jiang et al., 1999, Leibl et<br>
al., 1998). Other delivery vehicles are known in the art and some additional examples<br>
are provided below in the discussion of vectors.<br>
The term effective amount of a immunostimulatory nucleic acid refers to the<br>
amount necessary or sufficient to realize a desired biologic effect. For example, an<br>
effective amount of a immunostimulatory nucleic acid for inducing mucosal immunity is<br>
that amount necessary to. cause the development of IgA in response to an antigen upon<br>
exposure to the antigen, whereas that amount required for inducing systemic immunity is<br>
that amount necessary to cause the development of IgG in response to an antigen upon<br>
exposure to the antigen. Combined with the teachings provided herein, by choosing<br>
among the various active compounds and weighing factors such as potency, relative<br>
bioavailability, patient body weight, severity of adverse side-effects and preferred mode<br>
of administration, an effective prophylactic or therapeutic treatment regimen can be<br>
planned which does not cause substantial toxicity and yet is entirely effective to treat the<br>
particular subject. The effective amount for any particular application can vary<br>
depending on such factors as the disease or condition being treated, the particular<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acid being administered, the antigen, the size of the subject,<br>
or the severity of the disease or condition. One of ordinary skill in the art can<br>
empirically determine the effective amount of a particular immunostimulatory nucleic<br>
acid and/or antigen and/or other therapeutic agent without necessitating undue<br>
experimentation.<br>
Subject doses of the compounds described herein for mucosal or local delivery<br>
typically range from about 0.1 ï­g to 10 mg per administration, which depending on the<br>
application could be given daily, weekly, or monthly and any other amount of time<br>
therebetween. More typically mucosal or local doses range from about 10 ï­g to 5 mg<br>
per administration, and most typically from about 100 ï­g to 1 mg, with 2-4<br>
administrations being spaced days or weeks apart. More typically, immune stimulant<br><br>
doses range from 1 ï­g to 10 mg per administration, and most typically 10ï­g to 1 mg,<br>
with daily or weekly administrations. Subject doses of the compounds described herein<br>
for parenteral delivery for the purpose of inducing an antigen-specific immune response,<br>
wherein the compounds are delivered with an antigen but not another therapeutic agent<br>
are typically 5 to 10,000 times higher than the effective mucosal dose for vaccine<br>
adjuvant or immune stimulant applications, and more typically 10 to 1,000 times higher,<br>
and most typically 20 to 100 times higher. Doses of the compounds described herein for<br>
parenteral delivery for the purpose of inducing an innate immune response or for<br>
increasing ADCC or for inducing an antigen specific immune response when the<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acids are administered in combination with other therapeutic<br>
agents or in specialized delivery vehicles typically range from about 0.1 ï­g to 10 mg per<br>
administration, which depending on the application could be given daily, weekly, or<br>
monthly and any other amount of time therebetween. More typically parenteral doses for<br>
these purposes range from about 10 ï­g to 5 mg per administration, and most typically<br>
from about 100 ï­g to 1 mg, with 2-4 administrations being spaced days or weeks apart.<br>
In some embodiments, however, parenteral doses for these purposes may be used in a<br>
range of 5 to 10,000 times higher than the typical doses described above.<br>
For any compound described herein the therapeutically effective amount can be<br>
initially determined from animal models. A therapeutically effective dose can also be<br>
determined from human data for CpG oligonucleotides which have been tested in<br>
humans (human clinical trials have been initiated) and for compounds which are known<br>
to exhibit similar pharmacological activities, such as other mucosal adjuvants, e.g., LT<br>
and other antigens for vaccination purposes, for the mucosal or local administration.<br>
Higher doses are required for parenteral administration. The applied dose can be<br>
adjusted based on the relative bioavailability and potency of the administered compound.<br>
Adjusting the dose to achieve maximal efficacy based on the methods described above<br>
and other methods as are well-known in the art is well within the capabilities of the<br>
ordinarily skilled artisan.<br>
The formulations of the invention are administered in pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable solutions, which may routinely contain pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
concentrations of salt, buffering agents, preservatives, compatible carriers, adjuvants,<br>
and optionally other therapeutic ingredients.<br><br>
For use in therapy, an effective amount of the immunostimulatory nucleic acid<br>
can be administered to a subject by any mode that delivers the nucleic acid to the desired<br>
surface, e.g., mucosal, systemic. Administering the pharmaceutical composition of the<br>
present invention may be accomplished by any means known to the skilled artisan.<br>
Preferred routes of administration include but are not limited to oral, parenteral,<br>
intramuscular, intranasal, intratracheal, inhalation, ocular, vaginal, and rectal.<br>
For oral administration, the compounds (i.e., immunostimulatory nucleic acids,<br>
antigens and other therapeutic agents) can be formulated readily by combining the active<br>
compound(s) with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art. Such<br>
carriers enable the compounds of the invention to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees,<br>
capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a<br>
subject to be treated. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained as solid<br>
excipient, optionally grinding a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of<br>
granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores.<br>
Suitable excipients are, in particular, fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose,<br>
mannitol, or sorbitol; cellulose preparations such as, for example, maize starch, wheat<br>
starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose,<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). If desired, disintegrating agents may be added, such as the<br>
cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium<br>
alginate. Optionally the oral formulations may also be formulated in saline or buffers for<br>
neutralizing internal acid conditions or may be administered without any carriers.<br>
Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated<br>
sugar solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl<br>
pyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer<br>
solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may<br>
be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different<br>
combinations of active compound doses.<br>
Pharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally include push-fit capsules<br>
made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as<br>
glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in<br>
admixture with filler such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as<br><br>
talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active<br>
compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid<br>
paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In addition, stabilizers may be added.<br>
Microspheres formulated for oral administration may also be used. Such microspheres<br>
have been well defined in the art. All formulations for oral administration should be in<br>
dosages suitable for such administration.<br>
For buccal administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets or<br>
lozenges formulated in conventional manner.<br>
For administration by inhalation, the compounds for use according to the present<br>
invention may be conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation<br>
from pressurized packs or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g.,<br>
dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon<br>
dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit may be<br>
determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of<br>
e.g. gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder<br>
mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.<br>
The compounds, when it is desirable to deliver them systemically, may be<br>
formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or<br>
continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form,<br>
e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The<br>
compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or<br>
aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing<br>
and/or dispersing agents.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous<br>
solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of<br>
the active compounds may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions.<br>
Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic<br>
fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection<br>
suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such<br>
as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may<br>
also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds<br>
to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions.<br><br>
Alternatively, the active compounds may be in powder form for constitution with<br>
a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.<br>
The compounds may also be formulated in rectal or vaginal compositions such as<br>
suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such<br>
as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
In addition to the formulations described previously, the compounds may also be<br>
formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be formulated<br>
with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an<br>
acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example,<br>
as a sparingly soluble salt.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions also may comprise suitable solid or gel phase<br>
carriers or excipients. Examples of such carriers or excipients include but are not limited<br>
to calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives,<br>
gelatin, and polymers such as polyethylene glycols.<br>
Suitable liquid or solid pharmaceutical preparation forms are, for example,<br>
aqueous or saline solutions for inhalation, microencapsulated, encochleated, coated onto<br>
microscopic gold particles, contained in liposomes, nebulized, aerosols, pellets for<br>
implantation into the skin, or dried onto a sharp object to be scratched into the skin. The<br>
pharmaceutical compositions also include granules, powders, tablets, coated tablets,<br>
(micro)capsules, suppositories, syrups, emulsions, suspensions, creams, drops or<br>
preparations with protracted release of active compounds, in whose preparation<br>
excipients and additives and/or auxiliaries such as disintegrants, binders, coating agents,<br>
swelling agents, lubricants, flavorings, sweeteners or solubilizers are customarily used as<br>
described above. The pharmaceutical compositions are suitable for use in a variety of<br>
drug delivery systems. For a brief review of methods for drug delivery, see Langer,<br>
Science 249:1527-1533, 1990, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The immunostimulatory nucleic acids and optionally other therapeutics and/or<br>
antigens may be administered per se (neat) or in the form of a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt. When used in medicine the salts should be pharmaceutically acceptable,<br>
but non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts may conveniently be used to prepare<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Such salts include, but are not limited to,<br>
those prepared from the following acids: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, nitric,<br><br>
phosphoric, maleic, acetic, salicylic, p-toluene sulphonic, tartaric, citric, methane<br>
sulphonic, formic, malonic, succinic, naphthalene-2-sulphonic, and benzene sulphonic.<br>
Also, such salts can be prepared as alkaline metal or alkaline earth salts, such as sodium,<br>
potassium or calcium salts of the carboxylic acid group.<br>
Suitable buffering agents include: acetic acid and a salt (1-2% w/v); citric acid<br>
and a salt (1-3% w/v); boric acid and a salt (0.5-2.5% w/v); and phosphoric acid and a<br>
salt (0.8-2% w/v). Suitable preservatives include benzalkonium chloride (0.003-0.03%<br>
w/v); chlorobutanol (0.3-0.9% w/v); parabens (0.01-0.25% w/v) and thimerosal (0.004-<br>
0.02% w/v).<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention contain an effective amount of<br>
a Immunostimulatory nucleic acid and optionally antigens and/or other therapeutic<br>
agents optionally included in a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier. The term<br>
pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier means one or more compatible solid or liquid filler,<br>
diluents or encapsulating substances which are suitable for administration to a human or<br>
other vertebrate animal. The term carrier denotes an organic or inorganic ingredient,<br>
natural or synthetic, with which the active ingredient is combined to facilitate the<br>
application. The components of the pharmaceutical compositions also are capable of<br>
being commingled with the compounds of the present invention, and with each other, in<br>
a manner such that there is no interaction which would substantially impair the desired<br>
pharmaceutical efficiency.<br>
The immunostimulatory nucleic acids useful in the invention may be delivered in<br>
mixtures with additional adjuvant(s), other therapeutics, or antigen(s). A mixture may<br>
consist of several adjuvants in addition to the Immunostimulatory nucleic acid or several<br>
antigens or other therapeutics.<br>
A variety of administration routes are available. The particular mode selected<br>
will depend, of course, upon the particular adjuvants or antigen selected, the particular<br>
condition being treated and the dosage required for therapeutic efficacy. The methods of<br>
this invention, generally speaking, may be practiced using any mode of administration<br>
that is medically acceptable, meaning any mode that produces effective levels of an<br>
immune response without causing clinically unacceptable adverse effects. Preferred<br>
modes of administration are discussed above.<br><br>
The compositions may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be<br>
prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include<br>
the step of bringing the compounds into association with a carrier which constitutes one<br>
or more accessory ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly<br>
and intimately bringing the compounds into association with a liquid carrier, a finely<br>
divided solid carrier, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product. Liquid dose<br>
units are vials or ampoules. Solid dose units are tablets, capsules and suppositories. For<br>
treatment of a patient, depending on activity of the compound, manner of administration,<br>
purpose of the immunization (i.e., prophylactic or therapeutic), nature and severity of the<br>
disorder, age and body weight of the patient, different doses may be necessary. The<br>
administration of a given dose can be carried out both by single administration in the<br>
form of an individual dose unit or else several smaller dose units. Multiple<br>
administration of doses at specific intervals of weeks or months apart is usual for<br>
boosting the antigen-specific responses.<br>
Other delivery systems can include time-release, delayed release or sustained<br>
release delivery systems. Such systems can avoid repeated administrations of the<br>
compounds, increasing convenience to the subject and the physician. Many types of<br>
release delivery systems are available and known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
They include polymer base systems such as poly(lactide-glycolide), copolyoxalates,<br>
polycaprolactones, polyesteramides, polyorthoesters, polyhydroxybutyric acid, and<br>
polyanhydrides. Microcapsules of the foregoing polymers containing drugs are<br>
described in, for example, U.S. Patent 5,075,109. Delivery systems also include<br>
non-polymer systems that are: lipids including sterols such as cholesterol, cholesterol<br>
esters and fatty acids or neutral fats such as mono-di-and tri-glycerides; hydrogel release<br>
systems; sylastic systems; peptide based systems; wax coatings; compressed tablets<br>
using conventional binders and excipients; partially fused implants; and the like.<br>
Specific examples include, but are not limited to: (a) erosional systems in which an agent<br>
of the invention is contained in a form within a matrix such as those described in U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 4,452,775,4,675,189, and 5,736,152, and (b) diffusional systems in which<br>
an active component permeates at a controlled rate from a polymer such as described in<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 3,854,480,5,133,974 and 5,407,686. In addition, pump-based hardware<br>
delivery systems can be used, some of which are adapted for implantation.<br><br>

no way should be construed as further limiting. The entire contents of all of the<br>

Examples<br>
Materials and Methods:<br>
Oligodeoxynucleotides: Native phosphodiester and phosphorothioate-modified<br>
ODN were purchased from Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA) and Hybridon<br>
Specialty Products (Milford, MA). ODN were tested for endotoxin using the LAL-assay<br>
(LAL-assay BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD; lower detection limit 0.1 EU/ml). For in<br>
vitro assays, ODN were diluted in TE-buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA), and<br>
stored at -20Â° C. For in vivo use, ODN were diluted in phosphate buffered saline (0.1 M<br>
PBS, pH 7.3) and stored at 4Â°C. All dilutions were carried out using pyrogen-free<br>
reagents.<br>
Isolation of human PBMC and cell culture: Peripheral blood mononuclear<br>
cells (PBMC) were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers by Ficoll-Paque<br>
density gradient centrifugation (Histopaque-1077, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO)<br>
as described (Hartmann et al., 1999 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 96:9305-10). Cells were<br>
suspended in RPMI 1640-culture medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated<br>
(56Â°C, 1 h) FCS (HyClone, Logan, UT), 1.5 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and<br>
100 ï­g/ml streptomycin (all from Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY) (complete medium).<br>
Cells (final concentration 1 x 106 cells/ml) were cultured in complete medium in a 5%<br>
CO2 humidified incubator at 37Â°C. ODN and LPS (from Salmonella typhimurium, Sigma<br>
Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) or anti-IgM were used as stimuli. For measurement of<br>
human NK lytic activity, PBMC were incubated at 5 x 106/well in 24-well plates.<br>
Cultures were harvested after 24 hours, and cells were used as effectors in a standard 4<br>
hours 51Cr-release assay against K562 target cells as previously described (Ballas et al.,<br>
1996 J. Immunol. 157:1840-1845). For B cell proliferation, 1 ï­Ci of 3H thymidine was<br>
added 18 hours before harvest, and the amount of 3H thymidine incorporation was<br>
determined by scintillation counting at day 5. Standard deviations of the triplicate wells<br>
were 
 <br>
Flow cytometry on human PBMC: Surface antigens on primate PBMC were<br>
stained as previously described (Hartmann et al., 1998 J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 285:920-<br>
928). Monoclonal antibodies to CD3 (UCHT1), CD14 (M5E2), CD19 (B43), CD56<br>
(B159), CD69 (FN50) and CD86 (2331 [FUN-1]) were purchased from Pharmingen, San<br>
Diego, CA. IgG,,K (MOPC-21) and IgG2b,K (Hartmann et al., 1999 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci<br>
USA 96:9305-10) were used to control for non-specific staining. NK cells were<br>
identified by CD56 expression on CD3, CD14 and CD19 negative cells, whereas B cells<br>
were identified by expression of CD19. Flow cytometric data of 10000 cells per sample<br>
were acquired on a FACScan (Beckton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose,<br>
CA). The viability of cells within the FSC/SSC gate used for analysis was examined by<br>
propidium iodide staining (2 ug/ml) and found to be higher than 98%. Data were<br>
analyzed using the computer program FlowJo (version 2.5.1, Tree Star, Inc., Stanford,<br>
CA).<br>
Results:<br>
Example 1: CpG-dependent stimulation of human B cells depends on<br>
methylation and ODN length.<br>
Human PBMC were obtained from normal donors and cultured for five days at 2<br>
x 105 cells/well with the indicated concentrations of the indicated ODN sequences. As<br>
shown in Table F, human PBMCs proliferate above the background when cultured with a<br>
variety of different CpG ODN, but also show some proliferation even with ODN that do<br>
not contain any CpG motifs. The importance of unmethylated CpG motifs in providing<br>
optimal immune stimulation with these ODN is demonstrated by the fact that ODN 1840<br>
(SEQ ID NO. 83) induces 56,603 counts of ^H-thymidine incorporation whereas the<br>
same T-rich ODN with the CpG motifs methylated (non-CpG), 1979 (SEQ ID NO. 222),<br>
induces lower, but still increased over background, activity (only 18,618 counts) at the<br>
same concentration of 0.6 ï­g/ml. The reduced proliferation at higher ODN<br>
concentrations may be an artifact of the cells becoming exhausted under these<br>
experimental conditions or could reflect some toxicity of the higher ODN concentrations.<br>
Interestingly, shorter ODN containing CpG motifs, such as the 13-14 mers 2015 and<br>
2016, are less stimulatory despite the fact that their molar concentration would actually<br>
be higher since the ODNs were added on the basis of mass rather than molarity. This<br>
demonstrates that ODN length may also be an important determinant in the immune<br><br>
effects of the ODN. A non-CpG ODN but slight T-rich ODN (about 30% T), 1982 (SEQ<br>
ID NO. 225), caused only a small amount of background cell proliferation.<br><br><br>
Human PBMCs were cultured for 24 hours with a panel of different CpG or non-<br>
CpG ODN at two different concentrations, and then tested for their ability to kill NK<br>
target cells as described previously (Ballas et al., 1996 J. Immunol. 157:1840-1845).<br>
Killing is measured as lytic units, or L.U. The human donor used in this experiment had<br>
a background level of 3.69 L.U. which increased to 180.36 L.U. using the positive<br>
control, IL-2. A CpG oligo, 2006 (SEQ ID NO. 246), induced high levels of NK lytic<br>
function at a low concentration of 0.6, and a lower level at a concentration of 6.0.<br>
Surprisingly, a T-rich ODN in which the CpG motifs of 2006 were methylated (ODN at<br>
2117 (SEQ ID NO. 358)) or inverted to GpCs (ODN 2137 (SEQ ID NO. 886)) retained<br>
strong immune stimulatory function at the higher ODN concentrations, as shown in<br>
Table G. These concentration-dependent immune stimulatory effects are not a general<br>
property of the phosphorothioate backbone since the experiments described below<br>
demonstrate that a poly-A ODN, is nonstimulatory above background levels. Some<br>
stimulation is seen with a 24-base long ODN in which all of the base positions are<br>
randomized so that A, C, G, and T will occur at a frequency of 25% in each of the base<br>
positions (ODN 2182 (SEQ ID NO. 432)). However, the stimulatory effect of such a 24-<br>
base ODN is greatly enhanced if it is pure poly-T, in which case stimulation is also seen<br>
at the lowest concentration of 0.6 ï­g/ml (ODN 2183 (SEQ ID NO. 433)). In fact, the<br>
stimulatory activity of ODN SEQ ID NO. 433 at this low concentration is higher than<br>
that of any other ODN tested at this low concentration, aside from the optimal human<br>
immune stimulatory ODN of SEQ ID NO. 246. In fact, the higher concentration of ODN<br>
SEQ ID NO. 433 stimulated more NK activity than any other phosphorothioate ODN<br>
except for the strong CpG ODN 2142 (SEQ ID NO. 890), which was marginally higher.<br>
If the G content of ODN SEQ ID NO. 246 is increased relative to the T content by<br>
addition of more Gs, thus resulting in a decrease in the proportion of T nucleotides the<br>
immune stimulatory effect of the ODN is reduced (see ODN 2132 (SEQ ID NO. 373)).<br>
Thus, the T content of an ODN is an important determinant of its immune stimulatory<br>
effect. Although a poly-T ODN is the most stimulatory of the non-CpG ODN, other<br>
bases are also important in determining the immune stimulatory effect of a non-CpG<br>
ODN. ODN 2131 (SEQ ID NO. 372), in which slightly more than half of the bases are T<br>
and in which there are no Gs, is immune stimulatory at a concentration of 6 ï­g/ml but<br>
has less activity than other T-rich ODN. If the 6 A's in ODN 2131 (SEQ ID NO. 372)<br><br>
are replaced by 6 Gs, the immune stimulatory effect of the ODN can be increased (see<br>
ODN 2130 (SEQ ID NO. 371)).<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 3: Induction ofB cell proliferation by T-rich non-CpGODN.<br>
To assess the ability of T-rich ODN to activate B cell proliferation, human<br>
PBMCs were stained with the cytoplasmic dye CSFE, incubated with five days with the<br>
indicated ODN at either 0.15 or 0.3 ï­g/ml, and then analyzed by flow cytometry. B<br>
cells were identified by gating on cells positive for the lineage marker CD19). CpG<br>
ODN 2006 was a strong inducer of B cell proliferation, and this effect was reduced if the<br>
CpG motifs were methylated or inverted to GpC as shown in Figure 1 at an ODN<br>
concentration of 0.3 ug/ml. The base composition of the ODN appears to be important in<br>
determining the immune stimulatory effect. Reducing the T content of an ODN<br>
substantially reduces immune stimulatory effect, as exemplified by ODN 2177 (SEQ ID<br>
NO. 427) in which 6 of the Ts present in ODN 2137 (SEQ ID NO. 886) have been<br>
switched to A's, resulting in a greatly reduced immune stimulatory effect. The<br>
importance of T's in the immune stimulatory effect of an ODN is also shown by<br>
comparison of ODN 2116 (SEQ ID NO. 357) and 2181 (SEQ ID NO. 431), which differ<br>
in the 3' end of the ODN. ODN 2181, in which the 3' end is poly-T is more stimulatory<br><br>
than ODN 2116, in which the 3' end is poly-C, despite the fact that both ODN have a<br>
TCGTCG at the 5' end.<br>
Example 4: B Cell Proliferation Induced by TG Oligonucleotides<br>
The stimulatory effects of TG motifs are shown in Figure 2. ODN 2137 has the<br>
identical base composition as ODN 2006, but the CG motifs have all been inverted to<br>
GC's resulting in a CG-free nucleic acid. ODN does however contain 6 TG<br>
dinucleotides. In ODN 2177, all the TG dinucleotides of ODN 2137 have been changed<br>
to AG. Although ODN 2177 contains only 6 adenines, it is virtually nonstimulatory at a<br>
concentration of 0.2 ï­g/ml. For comparison, an ODN 24 bases in length in which each<br>
position is randomized to be any of the four bases (ODN 2182) induces &gt; 12% of B cells<br>
to proliferate at a concentration of 0.2 ï­g/ml. These results indicate that the stimulatory<br>
effects of ODN 2137 are not simply those of a phosphorothioate backbone, but relate to<br>
the presence of TG dinucleotides.<br>
In order to determine the effect of varying the number of TG dinucleotide motifs,<br>
ODN 2200 and ODN 2202 were compared, as shown in Figure 2. Both ODN contain 18<br>
Ts and 6 Gs, but in ODN 2200 all of the Gs are consecutive, so that there is only one TG<br>
dinucleotide, whereas in ODN 2202, the Gs are split up as GG dinucleotides throughout<br>
the ODN so that there are three TGs. ODN 2202 is significantly more stimulatory than<br>
ODN 2200, consistent with the model that at least three TG motifs in an ODN are<br>
required for optimal stimulatory activity. It is likely that even higher levels of<br>
stimulation could be achieved if the TG motifs had been optimized as taught herein.<br>
Example 5: Effects of TTG versus TTG motifs.<br>
Figure 3 shows the results of experiments conducted to study TG content in terms<br>
of the relative levels of Ts versus Gs as it relates to the stimulatory effect of an ODN.<br>
The Figure shows that an ODN in which all of the bases are randomized to be either T or<br>
G (ODN 2188 (SEQ ID NO. 905)) is nonstimulatory at a concentration of 0.2 jag/ml,<br>
similar to an ODN in which all of the bases are randomized to be either A or G (ODN<br>
2189 (SEQ ID NO. 906)). However, at the higher concentration of 2 jig/ml, the<br>
randomized T/G ODN 2188 is significantly more stimulatory. This latter level of<br>
stimulation is still lower than that which occurs with a totally randomized ODN (ODN<br>
2182 (SEQ ID NO. 432)). The highest stimulation at low concentrations is seen with an<br><br>
ODN in which half of the bases are fixed at T and the other half of the bases are<br>
randomized to be either T or G (ODN 2190 (SEQ ID NO. 907)). Since every other' base<br>
is fixed to be a T, there cannot be any TG motifs. The data in Figure 3 show that<br>
increasing the TG content of an ODN improves its stimulatory activity.<br>
In yet other experiments, the results of which are not diagrammed herein, ODN<br>
2190 (SEQ ID NO. 907) exhibited a stimulation, of NK activity compared to ODN 2188<br>
(SEQ ID NO. 905) or ODN 2189 (SEQ ID NO. 906).<br>
Examples 6-8<br>
Introduction:<br>
Above, we demonstrated that Poly T sequences are able to enhance stimulation of<br>
B and NK cells. Here and below we investigate the effect of a variety of non-CpG T-<br>
rich ODN as well as Poly C ODN for their ability to stimulate human B cells, NK cells<br>
and monocytes.<br><br><br>
Cell preparation and cell culture: Human PBMC were isolated from peripheral<br>
blood of healthy volunteers, obtained by the German Red Cross (Ratingen, Germany), as<br>
described above in Example 1, but all material were purchased from Life Technologies,<br>
Germany and were endotoxin-tested., For the B cell, NK cell and monocyte activation<br>
assays PBMC were cultured in complete medium at a concentration of 2x106 cells/ml in<br>
200ï­l in 96 round bottom plates in a humidified incubator at 37Â°C. Different ODNs,<br>
LPS (Sigma) or IL-2 (R&amp;D Systems, USA) were used as stimuli. At the indicated time<br>
points, cells were harvested for flow cytometry.<br>
Flow cytometry: MAbs used for staining of surface antigens were: CD3, CD14,<br>
CD19, CD56, CD69, CD80 and CD86 (all obtained from Pharmingen/Becton Dickinson,<br>
Germany). For monocytes Fc receptors were blocked using human IgG (Myltenyi,<br>
Germany) as previously described (Bauer, M et al 1999 Immunology 97:699). Flow<br>
cytometric data of at least 1000 cells of a specified subpopulation (B cells, monocytes,<br>
NK cells, NKT cells or T cells) were acquired on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson).<br>
Data were analyzed using the program CellQuest (Becton Dickinson).<br>
NK-mediated cytotoxicity: PBMC were cultured overnight with or without<br>
6ï­g/ml ODN or 100U/ml IL-2 at 37Â°C, 5% CO2. The next morning, K-562 target cells<br>
were labeled with a fluorescent dye, CFSE, as described previously for human B cells<br>
(Hartmann, G., and A. M. Krieg. 2000 J. Immunol 164:944). PBMC were added in<br>
different ratios (50:1, 25:1 and 12.5:1) to 2x105 target cells and incubated for 4h at 37Â°C.<br>
Cells were harvested and incubated with the DNA-specific dye 7-AAD (Pharmingen) for<br>
detection of apoptotic cells. Results were measured by flow cytometry.<br>
ELISA: PBMC (3x106 cells/ml) were cultured with the specified concentrations<br>
of ODN or LPS for 24h (IL-6,-IFNÎ³ and TNFÎ±) or 8h (IL-1Î²) in 48 well plates in a<br>
humidified atmosphere at 37Â°C. Supernatants were collected and cytokines were<br>
measured using OPTeia ELISA Kits (Pharmingen) for IL-6, IFNy and TNFa or an Eli-<br>
pair ELISA assay (Hoelzel, Germany) for IL-1Î² according to the manufacturer protocols.<br>
Example 6: B cell activation induced by ODNs lacking CpG motifs<br>
In the Experiments described above in Example 3, we demonstrate that T-rich<br>
ODN were capable of activating B cells. We expand those studies here using additional<br>
ODN and different cell and reagent sources. In a first set of experiments, we compared<br>
the activation potential of different non-CpG T-rich ODNs with the very potent known<br><br>
CpG ODN 2006 (SEQ ID NO.: 246). PBMC (2xl06cells/ml) of a blood donor (n=2)<br>
were incubated with the indicated concentrations of ODNs 2006 (SEQ ID NO.: 246),<br>
2117 (SEQ ID NO.: 358), 2137 (SEQ ID NO.: 886), 5126 (SEQ ID NO.: 1058), an9<br>
5162 (SEQ ID NO.: 1094). Cells were incubated for 48h at 37Â°C as described above and<br>
stained with mAb for CD 19 (B cell marker) and CD86 (B cell activation marker, B7-2).<br>
Expression was measured by flow cytometry.<br>
Using different concentrations of ODNs, we showed (Fig. 4) that T-rich ODNs<br>
without a CpG motif, can induce stimulation of human B cells. ODN 5126 (SEQ ID<br>
NO.: 1058) which contains only a single poly-T sequence but is greater than 50% T,<br>
caused high levels of human B cell activation. Although there are some similarities to<br>
SEQ ID NO.: 246 (e.g. more than 80% TIG content), this ODN clearly lacks any known<br>
immunostimulatory CpG motif. Surprisingly, for all tested T-rich ODNs, the highest<br>
stimulatory index was obtained at concentrations between 3 and lOug/ml. The highest<br>
stimulatory index of the tested ODNs was achieved by CpG/T-rich ODN SEQ ID NO.:<br>
246 at 0.4Î¼g/ml. Interestingly, the activity decreased at high concentrations.<br>
Poly A, Poly C and Poly T sequences were synthesized and tested for biological<br>
activity. PBMC (2xl06cells/ml) of one representative donor (n=3) were stimulated as<br>
described above by 0.4fig/ml, 1.0Î¼g/ml or 10.0Î¼g/ml of the following ODNs: 2006 (SEQ<br>
ID NO.: 246), 2196 (SEQ ID NO.: 913) (Poly T, 18 bases), 2194 (SEQ ID NO.: 911)<br>
(Poly T, 27 bases), 5162 (SEQ ID NO.: 1094) (Poly T, 30 bases), 5163 (SEQ ID NO.:<br>
1095) (Poly A, 30 bases), 5168 (SEQ ID NO.: 1096) (Poly C, 30 bases) and 5169 (SEQ<br>
ID NO.: 1097) (Poly CG, 30 bases). Expression of the activation marker CD86 (B7-2)<br>
on CD19-positive B cells was measured by flow cytometry.<br>
Fig. 5 demonstrates that the length of the sequence, at least for Poly T ODNs, has<br>
an important impact on its activity. A Poly T sequence containing only 18 bases (SEQ<br>
ID NO.: 913) was shown to be less stimulatory than one with 27 bases (SEQ ID NO.:<br>
911) or one with 30 bases (SEQ ID NO.: 1094) with a clear rank of stimulation: SEQ ID<br>
NO.: 1094&gt; SEQ ID NO.: 911&gt; SEQ ID NO.: 913. Poly A (SEQ ID NO.: 1095) or Poly<br>
CG (SEQ ID NO.: 1097) sequences, in contrast, do not induce activation of human B<br>
cells. Surprisingly it was also discovered that Poly C sequences (SEQ ID NO.: 1096)<br>
can activate human B cells at least at high concentrations (lOug/ml) (Fig. 5).<br><br>
Two other T-rich ODNs, namely 1982 (SEQ ID NO.: 225) and 2041 (SEQ ID<br>
NO.: 282) lacking CpG motifs were tested for their effect on human B cells. PBMC<br>
(n=2) were incubated with the indicated concentrations of ODN 2006 (SEQ ID NO.:<br>
246), 1982 (SEQ ID NO.: 225) and 2041 (SEQ ID NO.: 282) as described above. B cell<br>
activation (expression of the activation marker CD86) was measured by flow cytometry.<br>
Fig. 6 demonstrates that T-rich non-CpG ODN are immunostimulatory at<br>
concentrations higher than 1Î¼g/ml. Incorporation of a CpG motif into 1982 enhanced the<br>
immunostimulatory activity. Elongation with a Poly T sequence did not enhance the<br>
immunostimulatory activity of this already T-rich ODN but rather, decreased the<br>
activation potential slightly.<br>
Example 7: Immunostimulation of non-CpG ODNs is reflected in the<br>
enhancement of NK activation, NK cytotoxicity and monocyte activation<br>
NK cells as well as monocytes were tested for their response to non-CpG ODNs.<br>
PBMC (2x106 cells/ml) were incubated with 6Î¼g/ml of the following ODNs (n=4): 2006<br>
(SEQ ID NO.: 246), 2117 (SEQ ID NO.: 358), 2137 (SEQ ID NO.: 886), 2183 (SEQ ID<br>
NO.: 433), 2194 (SEQ ID NO.: 911) and 5126 (SEQ ID NO.: 1058). After 24h of<br>
cultivation at 37Â°C cells were harvested and stained with mAb for CD3 (T cell marker),<br>
CD56 (NK cell marker) and CD69 (early activation marker) as described above.<br>
Expression of CD69 on CD56-positive NK cells was measured by flow cytometry.<br>
Fig. 7 shows that for Poly T ODNs similar effects can be observed as described<br>
in Fig. 5. The stimulation of NK cells, like B cells, may be influenced by the length of<br>
the ODN. ODN 2183 (SEQ ID NO.: 433) (21 bases) induced activation of NK cells but<br>
to a lesser extent than the longer ODN 2194 (SEQ ID NO.: 911) (27 bases), as measured<br>
by enhanced expression of the early activation marker CD69. ODN 5126 (SEQ ID NO.:<br>
1058) was also demonstrated to activate human NK cells (Fig. 7).<br>
It is believed that the anti-tumor activity of CpG ODNs can be assessed by the<br>
ability of the ODN to enhance NK-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro. ODNs containing at<br>
the 5' and 3' ends stretches of Poly G were shown to result in the highest induction of<br>
cytotoxicity (Ballas, Z. K., et al. 1996 J. Immunol. 157:1840). To investigate the<br>
influence of non-CpG T-rich ODN on NK cytotoxicity, we analyzed the effect of the<br><br>
ODNs 2194 (SEQ ID NO.: 911) and 5126 (SEQ ID NO.: 1058) on NK-mediated lysis<br>
(Fig. 8). NK-mediated lysis of K.-562 target cells was measured after over night<br>
incubation of PBMC with 6Î¼g/ml of the ODN 2006 (SEQ ID NO.: 246), SEQ ID NO.:<br>
911 (SEQ ID NO.: 911 ) (Poly T, 27 bases) and 5126 (SEQ ID NO.: 1058) as described<br>
above. SEQ ID NO.: 1058 demonstrated small increases in lysis by human NK cells as<br>
compared to no ODN. SEQ ID NO.: 911 and SEQ ID NO.: 246 enhanced human NK<br>
cell cytotoxicity to an even higher extent.<br>
Previous reports demonstrated that not only NK cells but also NKT cells are<br>
mediators of cytotoxic responses to tumor cells (14). We, therefore, looked at the<br>
potential activation of human NKT cells by T-rich non-CpG ODN. PBMC of one<br>
representative donor (n=2) were incubated with 6ng/ml ODN 2006 (SEQ ID NO.: 246),<br>
2117 (SEQ ID NO.: 358), 2137 (SEQ ID NO.: 886), 2183 (SEQ ID NO.: 433), 2194<br>
(SEQ ID NO.: 913) and 5126 (SEQ ID NO.: 1058) for 24h as described above.<br>
Activation of NKT cells was measured by flow cytometry after staining of cells with<br>
mAb for CD3 (T cell marker), CD56 (NK cell marker) and CD69 (early activation<br>
marker). Shown is the expression of CD69 on CD3 and CD56 double-positive cells<br>
(NKT cells).<br>
In Fig. 9, SEQ ID NO.: 911 as well as SEQ ID NO.: 1058 were found to<br>
stimulate NKT cells. Similar to NK cells SEQ ID NO.: 911 (Poly T) was more active<br>
than SEQ ID NO. 1058. In addition, as described above for B cells and NK cells, the<br>
length of the ODN has some influence on the immunostimulatory potential, with the<br>
longer ODN having stronger effects on NKT cells. Similar results were observed for<br>
human T cells.<br>
Another type of cell of the immune system involved in fighting infections is the<br>
monocytes. These cells release upon activation a variety of cytokines and can mature<br>
into dendritic cells (DC), professional antigen-presenting cells (Roitt, I., J. Brostoff, and<br>
D. Male. 1998. Immunology. Mosby, London). Fig. 10 shows activation of human<br>
monocytes after culturing of PBMC with different ODNs. PBMC (2x106 cells/ml) were<br>
incubated with 6Î¼g/ml 2006 (SEQ ID NO.: 246), 2117 (SEQ ID NO.: 358), 2137 (SEQ<br>
ID NO.: 886), 2178 (SEQ ID NO.:1096), 2183 (SEQ ID NO.: 433), 2194 (SEQ ID NO.:<br>
911), 5126 (SEQ ID NO.: 1058) and 5163 (SEQ ID NO.: 1095) overnight at 37Â°C as<br><br>
described above (n=3). Cells were harvested and stained for CD 14 (monocyte marker)<br>
and CD80 (B7-1, activation marker). Expression was measured by flow cytometry.<br>
As demonstrated above for NK and B cells, T-rich sequences (e.g., SEQ ID NO.:<br>
433, SEQ ID NO.: 911) of different length induce monocyte stimulation but have<br>
different levels of activity e.g., SEQ ID NO.: 433&gt; SEQ ID NO.: 911. Poly A (SEQ ID<br>
NO.: 1095) as well as Poly C (SEQ ID NO.: 1096 (2178) sequences, in contrast, did not<br>
lead to activation of monocytes (measured by the upregulation of CD80 at a<br>
concentration of 6ug/ml ODN).<br>
Example 8: Induction ofcytokine release by non-CpG ODNs<br>
Next the ability of different T-rich ODNs to influence the cytokine milieu was<br>
examined. PBMC (3xl06cells/ml) were cultured for 24h with or without 6Î¼g/ml of the<br>
indicated ODNs or 1Î¼g/ml LPS as positive control (n=2). After incubation supematants<br>
were collected and TNFÎ± measured by ELISA as described above and the results are<br>
shown in Fig. 11. PBMC were cultured with the indicated ODNs (1.0ï­g/ml) as<br>
described in Fig. 11 and IL-6 was measured in the supematants by ELISA and the results<br>
are shown in Fig. 12.<br>
Fig. 11 and 12 demonstrate that T-rich non-CpG and T-rich/CpG ODNs can<br>
induce the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFa and IL-6. For both<br>
cytokines, ODN 5126 (SEQ ID NO.: 1058) was found in most assays to be as potent as<br>
ODN 2194 (SEQ ID NO.: 911). It is known that CpG ODNs influence the Thl/Th2<br>
balance by preferentially inducing Thl cytokines (Krieg, A. M. 1999 Biochemica et<br>
Biophysica Acta 93321:1). To test whether T-rich ODN caused a similar shift to Thl<br>
cytokines, IFNy production in PBMC was measured. In a first set of experiments, it was<br>
demonstrated that, as described for IL-6 and TNFa, ODNs SEQ ID NO.: 1058 and SEQ<br>
ID NO.: 911 induced the release of comparable amounts of this Thl cytokine IFNy. In<br>
addition, it was demonstrated that another pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1ï¢, was<br>
released upon culture of PBMC with these two ODNs. Although the amount of these<br>
cytokines induced by the T-rich ODN lacking CpG motifs was less than when CpG ODN<br>
SEQ ID NO.: 246 was used the amounts induced by T-rich ODN were significantly<br>
higher than the-control.<br><br>
Examples 9-11<br>
Introduction:<br>
An optimal CpG motif for immune system activation in non-rodent vertebrates is<br>
described herein. A phosphodiester oligonucleotide containing this motif was found to<br>
strongly stimulate CD86, CD40, CD54 and MHCII expression, IL-6 synthesis and<br>
proliferation of primary human B-cells. These effects required internalisation of the<br>
oligonucleotide and endosomal maturation. This CpG motif was associated with the<br>
sustained induction of the NFKB p50/p65 heterodimer and of the transcription factor<br>
complex activating protein-1 (AP-1). Transcription factor activation by CpG DNA was<br>
preceded by increased phosphorylation of the stress kinases c-jun NH2 terminal kinase<br>
(JNK) and p38, and of activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2). In contrast to CpG,<br>
signaling through the B-cell receptor led to activation of extracellular receptor kinase<br>
(ERK) and to phosphorylation of a different isoform of JNK.<br>
Materials and Methods:<br>
Oligodeoxynudeotides: Unmodified (phosphodiester, PE)and modified<br>
nuclease-resistant (phosphorothioate, PS) ODN were purchased from Operon<br>
Technologies (Alameda, CA) and Hybridon Specialty Products (Milford, MA). The<br>
sequences used are provided in Table H. E. coli DNA and calf thymus DNA were<br>
purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO. Genomic DNA samples were<br>
purified by extraction with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25/24/1) and ethanol<br>
precipitation. DNA was purified from endotoxin by repeated extraction with triton x-114<br>
(Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) and tested for endotoxin using the LAL-assay<br>
(LAL-assay BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD; lower detection limit 0.1 EU/ml) and the<br>
high sensitivity assay for endotoxin described earlier (lower detection limit 0.0014<br>
EU/ml) (Hartmann G., and Krieg A. M. 1999. CpG DNA and LPS induce distinct<br>
patterns of activation in human monocytes. Gene Therapy 6:893). Endotoxin content of<br>
DNA samples was below 0.0014 U/ml. E. coli and calf thymus DNA were made single<br>
stranded before use by boiling for 10 minutes, followed by cooling on ice for 5 minutes.<br>
DNA samples were diluted in TE-buffer using pyrogen-free reagents.<br>
Table H: Oligonucleotide panel used1<br><br><br><br>
Cell preparation and cell culture: Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells<br>
(PBMC) were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers by Ficoll-Paque<br>
density gradient centrifugation (Histopaque-1077, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO)<br>
as described (Hartmann G., et al 1996 Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev 6:291)). Cells<br>
were suspended in RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with 10 % (v/v) heat-<br>
inactivated (56Â°C, 1 h) FCS (HyClone, Logan, UT), 1.5 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml<br>
penicillin and 100 ï­g/ml streptomycin (all from Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY)<br>
(complete medium). All compounds were purchased endotoxin-tested. Viability was<br>
determined before and after incubation with ODN by trypan blue exclusion<br>
(conventional microscopy) or by propidium iodide exclusion (flow cytometric analysis).<br>
In all experiments, 96 % to 99 % of PBMC were viable. Cells (final concentration 1 x<br>
106 cells/ml) were cultured in complete medium in a 5 % CO2 humidified incubator at<br>
37Â°C. Different oligonucleotides (see table I, concentration as indicated in the figure<br>
legends), LPS (from salmonella typhimurium, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) or<br>
anti-IgM were used as stimuli. Chloroquine (5 ï­g/ml; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis,<br>
MO) was used to block endosomal maturation/acidification. At the indicated time points,<br>
cells were harvested for flow cytometry as described below.<br>
For signal transduction studies, human primary B-cells were isolated by<br>
immunomagnetic cell sorting using the VARIOMACS technique (Miltenyi Biotec Inc.,<br>
Auburn, CA) as described by the manufacturer. In brief, PBMC obtained from buffy<br>
coats of healthy blood donors (Elmer L. DeGowin Blood Center, University of Iowa)<br>
were incubated with a microbeads-conjugated antibody to CD 19 and passed over a<br>
positive selection column. Purity of B-cells was higher than 95%. After stimulation,<br>
whole cellular extracts (Western blot) and nuclear extracts (EMSA) for signal<br>
transduction studies were prepared.<br>
For CpG binding protein studies, Ramos cells (human Burkitt lymphoma B cell<br>
line, ATCC CRL-1923 or CRL-1596; Intervirology 5: 319-334,1975) were grown in<br>
complete medium. Untreated cells were harvested and cytosolic protein extracts were<br>
prepared and analyzed for the presence of CpG oligonucleotide binding proteins by<br>
EMSA and UV-crosslink as described below.<br>
Flow cytometry: Staining of surface antigens was performed as previously<br>
described (Hartmann G. et al. 1998 J Pharmacol Exp Ther 285:920). Monoclonal<br><br>
antibodies to HLA-DR were purchased from Immunotech, Marseille, France. All other<br>
antibodies were purchased from Pharmingen, San Diego, CA: mABs to CD 19 (B43),<br>
CD40 (5C3), CD54 (HA58), CD86 (2331 (FUN-1)). IgG1,k (MOPC-21) and IgG2b,k<br>
were used to control for specific staining. Intracellular cytokine staining for IL-6 was<br>
performed as described (Hartmann G., and Krieg A. M. 1999. CpG DNA and LPS<br>
induce distinct patterns of activation in human monocytes. Gene Therapy 6:893). In<br>
brief, PBMC (final concentration 1 x 106 cells/ml) were incubated in the presence of<br>
brefeldin A (final concentration 1 ug/ml, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). After<br>
incubation, cells were harvested and stained using a FITC-labeled mAB to CD 19 (B43),<br>
a PE-labeled rat anti-human IL-6 mAb (MQ2-6A3, Pharmingen) and the Fix and Perm<br>
Kit (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Flow cytometric data of 5000 cells per<br>
sample were acquired on a FACScan (Beckton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems,<br>
San Jose, CA). Non-viable cells were excluded from analysis by propidium iodide<br>
staining (2 ug/ml). Data were analyzed using the computer program FlowJo (version<br>
2.5.1, Tree Star, Inc., Stanford, CA).<br>
Proliferation assay: CFSE (5-(and-6-) carboxyfluorescein diacetate<br>
succinimidyl ester, Molecular Probes, USA) is a fluorescein-derived intracellular<br>
fluorescent label which is divided equally between daughter cells upon cell division.<br>
Staining of cells with CFSE allows both quantification and immunophenotyping<br>
(phycoerythrin-labeled antibodies) of proliferating cells in a mixed cell suspension.<br>
Briefly, PBMC were washed twice in PBS, resuspended in PBS containing CFSE at a<br>
final concentration of 5 uM, and incubated at 37Â°C for 10 minutes. Cells were washed<br>
three times with PBS and incubated for five days as indicated in the figure legends.<br>
Proliferating CD19-positive B-cells were identified by decreased CFSE content using<br>
flow cytometry.<br>
Preparation of whole cell, nuclear and cytosolic protein extracts: For Western<br>
blot analysis, whole cell extracts were prepared. Primary B-cells were treated with<br>
medium, the phosphodiester oligonucleotides 2080 (SEQ ID NO.: 321) or 2078 (SEQ ID<br>
NO.: 319) at 30 ug/ml, or anti-IgM (10 ug/ml). Cells were harvested, washed twice with<br>
ice-cold PBS containing 1 mM Na3VO4, resuspended in lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 10<br>
mM TRIS pH 7.4, 1 % NP40, 1 mM Na3VO4, 50 mM NaF, 30 mg/ml leupeptin, 50<br>
mg/ml aprotinin, 5 mg/ml antipain, 5 mg/ml pepstatin, 50 ï­g/ml<br><br>
phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF)), incubated for 15 min on ice and spun at 14000<br>
rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was frozen at -80 C. For the preparation of nuclear<br>
extracts, primary B-cells were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mM HEPES/KOH<br>
(pH 7.9), 10 mM KC1, 0.05 % NP40,1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothfeitol (DTT), 0.5<br>
mM PMSF, 30 mg/ml leupeptin, 50 mg/ml aprotinin, 5 mg/ml antipain, 5 mg/ml<br>
pepstatin). After 15 minutes incubation on ice, the suspension was centrifuged at 1000 x<br>
g for 5 minutes. The pelleted nuclei were resuspended in extraction buffer (20 mM<br>
HEPES (pH 7.9), 450 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 20% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM<br>
EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 30 mg/ml leupeptin, 50 mg/ml aprotinin, 5 mg/ml<br>
antipain, 5 mg/ml pepslatin) and incubated on ice for one hour. The nuclear suspension<br>
was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 16,000 g at 4Â°C. Supernatant was collected and stored<br>
at -80Â°C. Cytosolic extracts for the CpG binding protein studies were prepared from<br>
unstimulated Ramos cells, which were lysed with hypotonic buffer as described for the<br>
preparation of the nuclear extract. After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed as<br>
cytoplasmic fraction and stored at -80Â°C. Protein concentrations were measured using a<br>
Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturer.<br>
Western blot analysis: Equal concentrations of whole cell protein extracts (25<br>
fig/lane) were boiled in SDS sample buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 6.8; 1% p-<br>
mercaptoethanol; 2% SDS; 0.1% bromphenolblue; 10% glycerol) for 4 min before being<br>
subjected to electrophoresis on a 10 % polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1 % SDS (SDS-<br>
PAGE). After electrophoresis; proteins were transferred to Immobilion-P transfer<br>
membranes (Millipore Corp. Bedford, MA). Blots were blocked with 5 % nonfat dry<br>
milk. Specific antibodies against the phosphorylated form of extracellular receptor kinase<br>
(ERK), c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 and activating transcription factor-2<br>
(ATF-2) were used (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). Blots were developed in<br>
enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL; Amersham International, Aylesbury, U.K.)<br>
according to the manufacturer's recommended procedure.<br>
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA): To detect the DNA-binding<br>
activity of the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1) and NFKB, nuclear extracts<br>
(1 jig/lane) were analyzed by EMSA using the dsODNs 5' GAT CTA GTG ATG AGT<br>
CAG CCG GAT C 3' (SEQ ID NO.: 838) containing the AP-1 binding sequence, and the<br>
NFKB URE from the c-myc promotor region 5' TGC AGG AAG TCC GGG TTT TCC<br><br>
CCA ACC CCC C 3' (SEQ ID NO.: 1142), as probes. ODNs were end labeled with T4-<br>
polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and (ï§- P) ATP (Amersham, Arlington<br>
Heights, IL). Binding reactions were performed with 1 ug nuclear protein extract in<br>
DNA-binding buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 40 mM MgCl2, 20 mM EDTA, 1 mM<br>
dithiothreitol, 8% glycerol and 100 - 400 ng of poly (dI-dC) with 20.000 - 40.000 cpm<br>
labeled ODN in 10 ï­l total volume. Specificity of the NFKB bands was confirmed by<br>
competition studies with cold oligonucleotides from unrelated transcription factor<br>
binding sites (10-100 ng). For the supershift assay, 2 ug of specific antibodies for c-Rel,<br>
p50 and p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were added into the<br>
reaction mixture for 30 min before the radiolabeled probe was added. Following<br>
incubation for 30 minutes at room temperature loading buffer was added and the probes<br>
were electrophoresed on a 6 % polyacrylamide gel in Tris-borate-EDTA running buffer<br>
(90 mM Tris, 90 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Gels were dried and then<br>
autoradiographed.<br>
UV-crossIinking and denaturing protein electrophoresis: Nuclear extracts<br>
were incubated with labeled phosphodiester oligonucleotide as described for the EMSA.<br>
DNA-protein complexes were crosslinked with UV-light in a Stratalinker (Stratagene)<br>
for 10 minutes. Probes were mixed with SDS-sample buffer, boiled for 10 minutes and<br>
loaded on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried on Whatman paper and<br>
autoradiographed. Plotting the distance against the molecular weight of the marker<br>
proteins yielded a standard curve which was used to calculate the approximate molecular<br>
weight of the crosslinked protein-ODN complexes. The molecular weight of the<br>
oligonucleotide was subtracted from this value to give the size.<br>
Example 9: Identification of an Optimal CpG motif for use alone or in<br>
combination with a T-rich ODN<br>
Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides containing the murine CpG motif GACGTT<br>
(SEQ ID NO.: 1143) (for example 1826 (SEQ ID NO.: 69)) and used at concentrations<br>
which are active in murine B-cells (Yi A. K., Chang M., Peckham D. W., Krieg A. M.,<br>
and Ashman R. F. 1998. CpG oligodeoxyribonucleotides rescue mature spleen B cells<br>
from spontaneous apoptosis and promote cell cycle entry. J Immunol 160:5898), have<br>
showed little or no immunostimulatory activity on human immune cells. At higher<br><br>
concentrations this ODN was found to demonstrate some stimulatory effect on human B<br>
cells.<br>
In earlier studies on B-cell activation in mice, it was found that a CpG-<br>
dinucleotide flanked by two 5' purines and two 3' pyrimidines and preferably the 6mer<br>
motif 5' GACGTT 3' (SEQ ID NO: 1143) was optimal for a phosphodiester<br>
oligonucleotide to be active (Krieg A. M., et al. 1995 Nature 374:546, Yi A. K., Chang<br>
M.,etaL 1998 J Immunol 160:5898).<br>
In order to identify an optimal motif for stimulation of an immune response in<br>
humans and non-rodent vertebrates we designed a series of ODN and tested their<br>
activity. First we designed a 20 mer phosphodiester oligonucleotide with a TC<br>
dinucleotide at the 5' end preceding the optimal murine CpG motif 5* GACGTT 3'<br>
(SEQ ID NO.: 1143) and foHowed by a poly C tail (2079: 5' TCG ACG TTC CCC CCC<br>
CCC CC 3'(SEQ ID NO.: 320)). This oligonucleotide if added to human primary B-cells<br>
under the same conditions as found to be optimal for E. coli DNA (repeated addition at 0<br>
hours, 4 hours and 18 hours; 30 ï­g/ml for each time point) stimulated high levels of<br>
CD86 expression on human primary B-cells after two days. To determine the structure-<br>
function relationship of the CpG motifs, we replaced the bases adjacent to the CpG<br>
dinucleotides while maintaining the two CpG dinucleotides within the sequence.<br>
Exchange of the adenine located between both CpG dinucleotides by thymidine (2080<br>
(SEQ ID NO.: 321)) resulted in slightly higher activity. Replacement by guanosine<br>
(2100 (SEQ ID NO.: 341)) or cytidine (2082 (SEQ ID NO.: 323)) at this position showed<br>
no major changes compared to 2079 (SEQ ID NO.: 320). In contrast, replacement of the<br>
thymidine 3' to the second CpG dinucleotide by the purines guanosine (2099 (SEQ ID<br>
NO.: 340)) or adenine (2083 (SEQ ID NO.: 324)) resulted in a major drop in activity of<br>
the oligonucleotide, while the pyrimidine cytidine caused only a minor decrease. The<br>
thymidine immediately 5' to the first CpG dinucleotide was also important.<br>
Replacement of the thymidine by any other base (2105 (SEQ ID NO.: 346), guanosine;<br>
2107 (SEQ ID NO.: 348), adenine; 2104 (SEQ ID NO.: 345), cytidine) led to a marked<br>
decrease in activity of the oligonucleotide. Elimination of the first (2108 (SEQ ID NO.:<br>
349)) or the second (2106 (SEQ ID NO.: 347)) CpG dinucleotide also partially reduced<br>
the activity.<br><br>
The addition of more 5' GTCGTT 3' (SEQ ID NO.: 1144) CpG motifs to the<br>
phosphodiester oligonucleotide containing the 8mer duplex CpG motif (5' TCGTCGTT<br>
3' (SEQ ID NO:1145) , 2080 (SEQ ID NO.: 321)) did not further enhance CD86<br>
expression on B-cells (2059 (SEQ ID NO.: 300)). An oligonucleotide with the same<br>
sequence as 2080 (SEQ ID NO.: 321) but with a phosphorothioate backbone showed no<br>
activity above background (2116 (SEQ ID NO.: 357)). This was surprising since the<br>
phosphorothioate backbone has been reported to greatly stabilize oligonucleotides and<br>
enhance CpG-induced stimulation (Krieg A. M., Yi A. K., Matson S., Waldschmidt T. J.,<br>
Bishop G. A., Teasdale R., Koretzky G. A., and Klinman D. M. 1995. CpG motifs in<br>
bacterial DNA trigger direct B-cell activation. Nature 374:546). We therefore performed<br>
further structure-function analysis of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides containing the 5'<br>
GTCGTT 3' (SEQ ID NO:1144) and 5' TCGTCGTT 3' (SEQ ID NO:1145) motifs,<br>
which showed that additional CpG motifs (2006 (SEQ ID NO.: 246)) tended to increase<br>
the activity of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides.<br>
Purified B-cells isolated from peripheral blood by immunomagnetic cell sorting<br>
were activated by CpG DNA to the same extent as unpurified B-cells within PBMC.<br>
Thus, activation of B-cells is a primary response and not a secondary effect caused by<br>
cytokines secreted by other cells.<br>
In addition to the co-stimulatory molecule CD86, the functional stage of B-cells<br>
is characterized by other surface markers. For example, activated T helper cells stimulate<br>
B-cells by CD40 ligation, the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1, CD54)<br>
mediates binding to other immune cells, and major histocompatibility complex II (MHC<br>
II) is responsible for antigen presentation. We found that B cell expression of CD40,<br>
CD54 and MHC II was upregulated by the CpG oligonucleotide 2080 (SEQ ID NO.:<br>
321). The non-CpG control oligonucleotide 2078 (SEQ ID NO.: 319) showed no activity<br>
compared to medium alone.<br>
When PBMC were incubated for 5 days in the presence of 2080 (SEQ ID NO.:<br>
321) (added at 0 hours, 4 hours, 18 hours and every subsequent morning), it was<br>
intriguing that a subpopulation of lymphocytes increased in cell size (FSC) and became<br>
more granular (SSC). To examine if this subpopulation represented proliferating B-cells,<br>
we stained freshly isolated PBMC with CFSE (5-(and-6-) carboxyfluorescein diacetate<br>
succinimidyl ester) at day 0 and incubated them for 5 days with 2080 (SEQ ID NO.: 321)<br><br>
as above. CFSE is a fluorescent molecule that binds irreversibly to cell proteins. Each<br>
cell division decreases CFSE stain by 50 %. Cells staining low with CFSE (proliferating<br>
cells) were found to be mainly CD 19-positive B-cells. Thcoligonucleotide 2080 (SEQ<br>
ID NO.: 321) induced 60 to 70 % of CD} 9 positive B-cells to proliferate within 5 days.<br>
The control oligonucleotide 2078 (SEQ ID NO.: 319) induced less than 5 % of B-cells to<br>
proliferate. Proliferating B-cells (CFSE low) showed a larger cell size (FSC) and higher<br>
granularity.<br>
Proliferating B-cells expressed higher levels of CD86 than non-proliferating cells<br>
(not shown). In agreement with this finding, the oligonucleotide panel tested above for<br>
induction of CD86 expression resulted in an almost identical pattern of B-cell<br>
proliferation. Replacement of the 3' thymidine reduced activity more than changing the<br>
thymidine in the middle position.<br>
Example 10: B-cell activation requires endosomal maturation/acidification<br>
It has previously been shown that chloroquine, an inhibitor of endosomal<br>
acidification, blocks CpG-mediated stimulation of murine antigen presenting cells and B-<br>
cells, while not influencing LPS-mediated effects (Hacker H., et al 1998 Embo J<br>
17:6230, Yi A. K.et al 1998 J Immunol 160:4755, Macfarlane D. E., and Manzel L.<br>
1998 J Immunol 160:1122). We found that the addition of 5 ï­g/ml chloroquine<br>
completely blocked CpG DNA-mediated induction of CD86 expression on primary B-<br>
cells (MFI CD86: 2006 (SEQ ID NO.: 246), 4.7 vs 1.4; E. coH DNA, 3.4 vs. 1.4;<br>
medium only, 0.9; n=4). Furthermore, chloroquine completely inhibited the induction of<br>
B-cell proliferation by the phosphorothioate oligonucleotide 2006 (SEQ ID NO.: 246)<br>
measured with the CFSE proliferation assay as well as with the standard . These results<br>
suggest that as with murine cells, activation of human B-cells by CpG DNA requires the<br>
uptake of DNA in endosomes and subsequent endosomal acidification.<br>
Example 11: Analysis of sub-cellular events resulting upon human B cell<br>
stimulation with optimal human ODN.<br>
Since the CpG motif requirement for maximal B-cell activation is substantially<br>
different between mouse (GACGTT) (SEQ ID NO: 1143) and humans (TCGTCGTT)<br>
(SEQ ID NO: 1145), we were interested if the basic intracellular signaling events are<br><br>
comparable. Rapid induction of NFKB binding activity has been found earlier in murine<br>
B-cells and macrophages (Stacey K. J., et al 1996 J Immunol 157:2116, Yi A. K et al<br>
1998 J Immunol 160:4755). To investigate the NFKB response to CpG DNA in humans,<br>
human primary B-cells were isolated from peripheral blood by immunomagnetic cell<br>
sorting and incubated with the CpG oligonucleotide 2080 (SEQ ID NO.: 321), the non-<br>
CpG control oligonucleotide 2078 (SEQ ID NO.: 319), or medium. At the indicated time<br>
points, cells were harvested and nuclear extracts were prepared. In the presence of CpG<br>
oligonucleotide, NFKB binding activity was increased within one hour and maintained up<br>
to 18 hours (latest time point examined). The non-CpG control oligonucleotide 2078<br>
(SEQ ID NO.: 319) did not show enhanced NFKB activity compared to cells incubated<br>
with medium only. The NFKB band was identified by cold competition, and shown to<br>
consist of p50 and p65 subunits by supershift assay.<br>
The activating protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor is involved in the regulation<br>
of immediate early genes and cytokine expression (Karin M. 1995. The regulation of AP-<br>
1 activity by mitogen-activated protein kinases. J Biol Chem 270:16483). In murine B-<br>
cells, AP-1 binding activity is induced in response to CpG DNA (Yi A. K., and Krieg A.<br>
M. 1998. Rapid induction of mitogen-activated protein kinases by immune stimulatory<br>
CpG DNA. J Immunol 161:4493). To determine whether this transcription factor would<br>
also be induced by CpG DNA in humans, we examined AP-1 DNA binding activity in<br>
human primary B-cells. Cells were incubated with the CpG oligonucleotide 2080 (SEQ<br>
ID NO.: 321) or the control oligonucleotide 2078 (SEQ ID NO.: 319). Nuclear extracts<br>
were prepared and the AP-1 binding activity was analyzed by EMS A. AP-1 binding<br>
activity was enhanced within one hour, and increased up to 18 hours (latest time point<br>
examined), showing a sustained response.<br>
Since AP-1 activity is induced by many stimuli (Angel P., and Karin M. 1991.<br>
The role of Jun, Fos and the AP-1 complex in cell-proliferation and transformation.<br>
Biochim Biophys Acta 1072:129), we were interested in signal transduction pathways<br>
upstream of AP-1. The AP-1 transcription factor complex integrates different mitogen<br>
activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways (Karin M. 1995. The regulation of AP-1<br>
activity by mitogen-activated protein kinases. J Biol Chem 270:16483). Western blots<br>
were performed using whole cell extracts from primary B-cells incubated with the CpG<br>
oligonucleotide 2080 (SEQ ID NO.: 321), the controf 2078 (SEQ ID NO.: 319), or<br><br>
medium only. Specific antibodies to the phosphorylated form of JNK, p38, ATF-2 and<br>
ERK were used. Strong induction of JNK phosphorylation was found 30 min and 60 min<br>
after exposure to CpG-DNA, while the non-CpG oligonucleotide showed no activity<br>
above background. The protein kinase p38, another stress activated protein kinase<br>
(SAPK), was also phosphorylated in response to CpG DNA within 60 min. ATF-2, a<br>
substrate of both p38 and JNK (Gupta S., Campbell D., Derijard B., and Davis R. J.<br>
1995. Transcription factor ATF2 regulation by the JNK signal transduction pathway.<br>
Science 267:389) and a component of the AP-1 complex, showed weak phosphorylation<br>
after 30 min which increased after 60 min. CpG DNA failed to induce substantial<br>
phosphorylation of ERK. In contrast, anti-IgM, stimulating the B-cell receptor, did<br>
trigger phosphorylation of ERK. Anti-IgM activated different isoforms of JNK than CpG<br>
DNA.<br>
Example 12: Assay for in vivo adjuvant activity.<br>
An in vitro screening assay to identify ODN useful as an adjuvant in vivo in<br>
humans and other non-rodent animals was developed. Since we saw not only<br>
quantitative but also qualitative differences in activities of different CpG ODN in mice,<br>
we first screened a panel of CpG and non-CpG control ODN on mouse cells to find in<br>
vitro assays with reliable and strong correlation to in vivo adjuvant activity with hepatitis<br>
B surface antigen (HBsAg). We then systematically tested a panel of more than 250<br>
ODN in corresponding human assays to identify sequences with in vitro<br>
immunostimulatory activity. We next examined if the ODN with the highest activity in<br>
these human assays also activate B cell proliferation in chimpanzees and monkeys, and<br>
finally, if they are active as adjuvants with HBsAg in chimpanzees and cynomolgus<br>
monkeys in vivo. These studies revealed that the sequence, number and spacing of<br>
individual CpG motifs contribute to the immunostimulatory activity of a CpG<br>
phosphorothioate ODN. An ODN with a TC dinucleotide at the 5' end followed by three<br>
6mer CpG motifs (5' GTCGTT 3') separated by TT dinucleotides consistently showed<br>
the highest activity for human, chimpanzee, and rhesus monkey leukocytes.<br>
Chimpanzees or monkeys vaccinated once against hepatitis B with this CpG ODN<br>
adjuvant developed 15 times higher anti-HBs antibody titers than those receiving vaccine<br>
alone.<br><br>
Materials and Methods<br>
Oligodeoxynucleotides: Phosphorothioate-modified ODN were purchased from<br>
Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA) and Hybridon Specialty Products (Milford, MA).<br>
ODN were tested for endotoxin using the LAL-assay (LAL-assay BioWhittaker,<br>
Walkersville, MD; lower detection limit 0.1 EU/ml). For in vitro assays, ODN were<br>
diluted in TE-buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA), and stored at -20Â° C. For in<br>
vivo use, ODN were diluted in phosphate buffered saline (0.1 M PBS, pH 7.3) and stored<br>
at 4Â°C. All dilutions were carried out using pyrogen-free reagents.<br>
Mouse spleen cell cultures: Spleens were removed from 6-12 week old female<br>
BALB/c (The Jackson Laboratory), 2 x 106 splenocytes were cultured with 0.2 ï­M ODN<br>
for 4 hours (TNF-a) or 24 hours (IL-6, IFN-ï§, IL-12), and cytokines were detected by<br>
ELISA as previously described (Yi A. K., Klinman D. M., Martin T. L., Matson S., and<br>
Krieg A. M. 1996. Rapid immune activation by CpG motifs in bacterial DNA. Systemic<br>
induction of IL-6 transcription through an antioxidant-sensitive pathway. J Immunol<br>
157:5394). To evaluate CpG-induced B cell proliferation, spleen cells were depleted of T<br>
cells with anti-Thy-1.2 and complement and centrifugation over lympholyte MÂ®<br>
(Cedarlane Laboratories, Hornby, ON, Canada), cultured for 44 hours with the indicated<br>
ODN, and then pulsed for 4 hours with 1 ï­Ci of 3H thymidine as described previously<br>
(Krieg A. M., Yi A. K., Matson S., Waldschmidt T. J., Bishop G. A., Teasdale R.,<br>
Koretzky G. A., and Klinman D. M. 1995. CpG motifs in bacterial DNA trigger direct B-<br>
cell activation. Nature 374:546). To examine NK cell lytic activity murine spleen cells<br>
were depleted of B cells using magnetic beads coated with goat anti-mouse Ig as<br>
previously detailed (Ballas Z. K., and Rasmussen W. 1993. Lymphokine-activated killer<br>
cells. VII. IL-4 induces anNKl.l+CD8 ct+P' TCR-ap B220+ lymphokine-activated killer<br>
subset. J Immunol 150:17). Cells were cultured at 5 x 106/well in 24-well plates and<br>
harvested at 18 hours for use as effector cells in a standard 4 hour 51Cr-release assay<br>
against YAC-1 target cells. One unit (LU) was defined as the number of cells needed to<br>
effect 30 % specific lysis.<br>
Immunization of mice against HBsAg and evaluation of the humoral<br>
response: Groups of 6-8 week old female BALB/c mice (n = 5 or 10, Charles River,<br>
Montreal, QC) were immunized against HBsAg as previously described (Davis H. L., et<br><br>
al 1998 J Immunol 160:870). In brief, each mouse Teceived a single IM injection of 50<br>
ï­l PBS containing 1 ï­g recombinant HBsAg (Medix Biotech, Foster City, CA) and 10<br>
jag of CpG ODN or non-CpG ODN as a sole adjuvant or combined with alum<br>
(AlhydrogeL"85'; Superfos Biosector, Vedbaek, Denmark; 25 mg Al34Ymg HBsAg).<br>
Control mice were immunized with HBsAg without adjuvant or with alum. Plasma was<br>
recovered from mice at various times after immunization and Abs specific to HBsAg<br>
(anti-HBs) were quantified by end-point dilution ELISA assay (in triplicate) as described<br>
previously (Davis H. L et al 1998 J Immunol 160:870). End-point titers were defined as<br>
the highest plasma dilution that resulted in an absorbance value (OD450) two times<br>
higher than that of non-immune plasma with a cut-off value of 0.05.<br>
Isolation of primate PBMC and cell culture: Peripheral blood mononuclear<br>
cells (PBMC) were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers, chimpanzees or<br>
rhesus or cynomolgus monkeys by Ficoll-hypaque density gradient centrifugation<br>
(Histopaque-1077, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) as described (Hartmann G., et al<br>
1996 Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev 6:291). Cells were suspended in RPMI1640<br>
culture medium supplemented with 10 % (v/v) heat-inactivated (56Â°C, 1 h) FCS<br>
(HyClone, Logan, UT), 1.5 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 ï­g/ml<br>
streptomycin (all from Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY) (complete medium). Cells (final<br>
concentration 1 x 106 cells/ml) were cultured in complete medium in a 5 % CO2<br>
humidified incubator at 37Â°C. GDN and LPS (from Salmonella typhimurium, Sigma<br>
Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) or anti-IgM were used as stimuli. For measurement of<br>
human NK lytic activity, PBMC were incubated at 5 x 106/well in 24-well plates.<br>
Cultures were harvested after 24 hours, and cells were used as effectors in a standard 4<br>
hours 51Cr-release assay against K562 target cells as previously described (Ballas Z. K.,<br>
Rasmussen W. L., and Krieg A. M. 1996. Induction of NK activity in murine and human<br>
cells by CpG motifs in oligodeoxymicleotides and bacterial DNA. J Immunol 157:1840;<br>
Ballas Z. K., and Rasmussen W. 1993. Lymphokine-activated killer cells. VII. IL-4<br>
induces an NK1.1+CD8 ï¡+(ï¢ TCR-aP B220+ lymphokine-activated killer subset. J<br>
Immunol 150:17). For B cell proliferation, 1 ï­Ci of 3H thymidine was added 18 hours<br>
before harvest, and the amount of 3H thymidine incorporation was determined by<br>
scintillation counting at day 5. Standard deviations of the triplicate wells were 
 <br>
Flow cytometry on primate PBMC: Surface antigens on primate PBMC were<br>
stained as previously described (Hartmann G et al 1998 JPharmacol Exp Ther<br>
285:920). Monoclonal antibodies to CD3 (UCHT1), CD14 (M5E2), CD19 (B43), CD56<br>
(B159), CD69 (FN50) and CD86 (2331 (FUN-1)) were purchased from Pharmingen, San<br>
Diego, CA. IgG1,K (MOPC-21) and IgG2b,K (Hartmann G et al 1999 PNAS 96:9305)<br>
were used to control for non-specific staining. NK cells were identified by CD56<br>
expression on CD3, CD14 and CD19 negative cells, whereas B cells were identified by<br>
expression of CD 19. Flow cytometric data from 10000 cells per sample were acquired on<br>
a FACScan (Beckton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA). The<br>
viability of cells within the FSC/SSC gate used for analysis was examined by propidium<br>
iodide staining (2 ug/ml) and found to be higher than 98 %. Data were analyzed using<br>
the computer program FlowJo (version 2.5.1, Tree Star, Inc., Stanford, CA).<br>
Immunization of chimpanzees and cynomolgus monkeys against HBsAg and<br>
evaluation of the humoral response: Fourteen cynomolgus monkeys (2.0-3.5 kg) were<br>
immunized with a pediatric dose of Engerix-B (SmithKline Beecham Biologicals,<br>
Rixensart, BE) containing 10 ï­g HBsAg adsorbed to alum (25 mg Al3+/mg HBsAg).<br>
This was administered alone (n=5), or combined with CpG ODN 1968 (n=5, 500 ï­g) or<br>
CpG ODN 2006 (SEQ ID NO.: 246) (n=4, 150 ï­g). Four chimpanzees (10-20 kg) were<br>
immunized in the same fashion with two receiving control vaccine (Engerix-B only) and<br>
two receiving experimental vaccine (Engerix-B plus 1 mg CpG ODN 2006). All vaccines<br>
were administered IM in the right anterior thigh in a total volume of 1 ml. Monkeys were<br>
maintained in the animal facility of the Primate Research Center (Bogor, Indonesia) and<br>
chimpanzees were housed at Bioqual (Rockville, MD). Animals were monitored daily by<br>
animal care specialists. No symptoms of general ill health or local adverse reactions at<br>
the injection site were noted. Plasma was recovered by IV puncture prior to and at<br>
various times after immunization and was stored frozen (-20Â°C) until assayed for<br>
antibodies. Anti-HBs antibodies were detected using a commercial ELISA kit (Monolisa<br>
Anti-HBs; Sanofi-Pasteur, Montreal, QC) and titers were expressed in mlU/ml based on<br>
comparison with WHO defined standards (Monolisa Anti-HBs Standards; Sanofi-<br>
Pasteur).<br>
Results<br><br>
Identification of CpG ODN with different profiles of in vitro immune activities:<br>
Our studies showed that the precise bases on the 5' and 3' sides of a CpG dinucleotide<br>
within a CpG motif may have an impact on the level of immune activation of a synthetic<br>
ODN, but it has been unclear whether different CpG motifs might display different<br>
immune effects. To evaluate this possibility, we tested a panel of CpG ODN for their<br>
ability to induce NK lytic activity, B cell proliferation, and to stimulate synthesis of<br>
TNF-ï¡, IL-6, IFN-Î and IL-12 in murine spleen cells . Immunostimulatory activity of<br>
ODN without CpG motifs (ODN 1982 (SEQ ID NO.: 225), ODN 1983 (SEQ ID NO.:<br>
226)) was negative or weak compared to CpG ODN. ODN with non optimal CpG<br>
motifs (ODN 1628 (SEQ ID NO.: 767), ODN 1758 (SEQ ID NO.: 1)) were less active<br>
than ODN containing CpG motifs flanked by two 5' purines and two 3' pyrimidines<br>
(ODN 1760 (SEQ ID NO.: 3), ODN 1826 (SEQ ID NO.: 69), ODN 1841 (SEQ ID NO.:<br>
84)). ODN 1826 containing two optimal murine CpG motifs (5' GACGTT 3') (SEQ ID<br>
NO:1143) had the highest activity for 5 of 6 measured endpoints. Except for ODN 1628,<br>
all ODN showed a generally similar pattern of activity (NK cell-mediated lysis, B cell<br>
proliferation, IL-12, IL-6, TNF a, IFN-Î). Of note, ODN 1628, which was unique in this<br>
panel for containing two G-rich regions, showed preferential induction of IFN-Î³<br>
synthesis but relatively low stimulation of the other activities.<br>
Identification of in vitro assays which correlate with in vivo adjuvant activity:<br>
Since adjuvant activity is an in vivo endpoint, we were interested in identifying in vitro<br>
assays that would predict the adjuvant activity of a CpG ODN in vivo. The same ODN<br>
used for in vitro endpoints therefore were tested for their adjuvant activity to immunize<br>
mice against HBsAg. This was carried out both with ODN alone and with ODN<br>
combined with alum, since earlier studies had shown strong synergy for CpG ODN and<br>
alum adjuvants (PCT Published Patent Application WO98/40100).<br>
B ALB/c mice immunized with HBsAg without adjuvant attained only low titers<br>
of anti-HBs by 4 weeks, and this was not affected by addition of control ODN. In<br>
contrast, addition of CpG ODN raised anti-HBs titers by 5 to 40 fold, depending on the<br>
sequence used. When alum was added, titers of anti HBs were approximately 6 times<br>
higher than with HBsAg alone. Specifically, control ODN had no effect and the various<br>
CpG ODN augmented these titers 2 to 36 fold. Results obtained with the different ODN<br><br>
alone correlated very strongly (r = 0.96) with those obtained using the same ODN plus<br>
alum. When linear regression was performed, a very high degree of correlation was<br>
found between certain in vitro assays and in vivo augmentation of anti-HBs titers. Of all<br>
the in vitro endpoints examined, the induction of NK lytic activity showed the best<br>
correlation to in vivo adjuvant activity (without alum, r = 0.98; with alum, r = 0.95; p 
0.0001). A good correlation regarding adjuvant activity was also obtained for B-cell<br>
stimulation (r= 0.84 and 0.7), as well as secretion of TNF-a (r= 0.9 and 0.88), IL-12 (r=<br>
0.88 and 0.86) and IL-6 (r= 0.85 and 0.91). The one in vitro assay that did not correlate<br>
well with the in vivo results was IFN-y secretion (r = 0.57 and 0.68). These data<br>
demonstrate that in vitro assays for NK lytic activity, B cell activation and production of<br>
TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-12 provide valuable information in vitro to predict the adjuvant<br>
activity of a given ODN in vivo.<br>
Screening of a phosphorothioate ODN panel to activate human NK cells: In<br>
previous studies we found that synthesis of inflammatory cytokines by human PBMC is<br>
induced by extremely low amounts of endotoxin (induced TNF-a secretion is detectable<br>
with just 6 pg/ml endotoxin, 2 logs more sensitive than murine immune cells). In<br>
contrast, activation of human B cells and induction of human NK cell lytic activity with<br>
endotoxin is low even at high endotoxin concentrations. Based on these results we<br>
selected activation of NK cells (lytic activity and CD69 expression) and B cells<br>
(proliferation and CD86 expression) as the most highly specific and reproducible assays<br>
with low inter-subject variability and used these assays for in vitro screening of a pool of<br>
ODN.<br>
First we studied the effect of phosphorothioate ODN containing various<br>
combinations and permutations of CpG motifs on NK cell-mediated lysis of target cells.<br>
For clarity and ease of presentation, only data with selected representative CpG and<br>
control ODN are shown. Human PBMC were incubated with different phosphorothioate<br>
ODN (6 ng/ml) for 24 hours and tested for their ability to lyse 51Cr-labeled K562 cells.<br>
ODN with two 6-mer CpG motifs (either 5' GACGTT 3' (SEQ ID NO.: 1143) or 5'<br>
GTCGTT 3' (SEQ ID NO.: 1144)) in combination with a TpC at the 5'end of the ODN<br>
(ODN 1840 5' TCCATGTCGTTCCTGTCGTT 3' (SEQ ID NO.: 83), ODN 1851 5'<br>
TCCTGACGTTCCTGACGTT 3' (SEQ ID NO.: 94) or with at least three 6-mer motifs<br>
without a TpC at the 5' end (ODN 2013 (SEQ ID NO.: 253)) show intermediate activity.<br><br>
High activity was found when the 5' TpC directly preceded a 6-mer human CpG motif<br>
(5' TCGTCGTT 3' (SEQ ID NO.: 1145)) and was followed by two 6-mer motifs (ODN<br>
2005 (SEQ ID NO.: 245), ODN 2006 (SEQ ID NO.: 246) and ODN 2007 (SEQ ID NO.:<br>
247)). The best results were obtained when the 6-mer CpG motifs were separated from<br>
each other and from the 5' 8-mer CpG motif by TpT (ODN 2006 (SEQ ID NO.: 246)).<br>
Expression of the activation marker CD69 is rapidly upregulatedon the surface<br>
of NK cells subsequent to stimulation. To confirm the results from the NK cell lysis<br>
assay, PBMC were incubated for 18 hours with ODN (2 ug/ml). CD69 expression was<br>
examined on CD56 positive NK cells (CD3, CD14 and CD19 negative). Although<br>
induction of CD69 expression was less sequence restricted than stimulation of NK cell<br>
functional activity, control ODN (ODN 1982, ODN 2116, ODN 2117, ODN 2010)<br>
showed only low activity similar to background levels. ODN with two human CpG<br>
motifs separated by 5' TTTT 3' (ODN 1965 (SEQ ID NO.: 208)) or four human CpG<br>
motifs without spacing (ODN 2013 (SEQ ID NO.: 253)) were relatively more active at<br>
inducing CD69 expression than at stimulating NK cell lytic activity. Optimal NK cell<br>
functional activity, as well as CD69 expression, was obtained with ODNs containing a<br>
TpC dinucleotide preceding the human CpG motif, and additional human motifs within<br>
the sequence (ODN 2006 (SEQ ID NO.: 246), ODN 2007 (SEQ ID NO.: 247)).<br>
Activity of phosphorothioate ODN for stimulating human B cells: In preliminary<br>
experiments we found that the percentage of proliferating B cells (CFSE assay, see<br>
methods section) correlated with the surface expression of the co-stimulatory CD86 B<br>
cells, as measured by flow cytometry. Thus we used CD86 expression on B cells to<br>
screen a panel of ODN for their immunostimulatory activity. PBMC were incubated with<br>
0.6 ï­g/ml ODN. Expression of CD86 (mean fluorescence intensity, MFI) was examined<br>
on CD19 positive B cells. A poly C ODN (ODN 2017 (SEQ ID NO.: 257)) or ODN<br>
without CpG cHnucleotides (ODN 1982 (SEQ ID NO.: 225)) failed to stimulate human B<br>
cells under these experimental conditions. A phosphorothioate ODN (ODN 2116 (SEQ<br>
ID NO.: 256)) with one optimal human CpG motif preceded by a TpC (5' TCGTCGTT<br>
3' (SEQ ID NO.: 1145)) had low activity. The presence of one human 6-mer CpG motif<br>
(5' GTCGTT 3' (SEQ ID NO.: 1144)) had no activating effect. Two of these CpG<br>
motifs within the sequence showed no (ODN 1960 (SEQ ID NO.: 203), ODN 2016 (SEQ<br>
ID NO.: 256)) or intermediate (ODN 1965 (SEQ ID NO.: 208)) activity dependent on the<br><br>
sequence context. If the ODN was composed of three or four copies of this motif (ODN<br>
2012 (SEQ ID NO.: 252), ODN 2013 (SEQ ID NO.: 253), ODN 2014 (SEQ ID NO.:<br>
254)), intermediate activity on B cells could be detected. The combination of the human<br>
8-mer CpG motif on the 5' end of the ODN with two 6-mer CpG motifs (ODN 2005<br>
(SEQ ID NO.: 245), ODN 2006 (SEQ ID NO.: 246), ODN 2007 (SEQ ID NO.: 247),<br>
ODN 2102 (SEQ ID NO.: 343), ODN 2103 (SEQ ID NO.: 344)) led to a considerable<br>
increase in the ability of the ODN to stimulate B cells. The spacing between the single<br>
motifs was critical. The separation of CpG motifs by TpT was preferable (ODN 2006<br>
(SEQ ID NO.: 246)) compared to unseparated CpG motifs (ODN 2005 (SEQ ID NO.:);<br>
also compare ODN 1965 (SEQ ID NO.: 208) to ODN 1960 (SEQ ID NO.: 203)). The<br>
human 6-mer CpG motif (5' GTCGTT 3') was better than the optimal mouse 6-mer CpG<br>
motif (5' GACGTT 3' (SEQ ID NO.: 246)) when combined with the human 8-mer CpG<br>
motif on the 5' end (ODN 2006 vs. ODN 2102 (SEQ ID NO.: 343) and ODN 2103 (SEQ<br>
ID NO.: 344)). A (TCG)poly ODN was inactive or only weakly active, as were ODN<br>
containing CpG dinucleotides flanked by guanines or other CpG dinucleotides (ODN<br>
2010 (SEQ ID NO.: 250)). Taken together, the findings for NK cells and B cells showed<br>
consistently that of the ODN tested, ODN 2006 (SEQ ID NO.: 246) has the highest<br>
immunostimulatory activity on human immune cells.<br>
Comparative analysis of potency of CpG phosphorothioate ODNs in different<br>
primates: Different CpG motifs are optimal to activate murine and human immune cells.<br>
Furthermore, the number and location of CpG motifs within an active phosphorothioate<br>
ODN is different in mice and humans. We were interested to know if CpG<br>
phosphorothioate ODN show a similar activity among different species of primates. We<br>
compared a panel of CpG ODN for their ability to induce B cell proliferation in humans,<br>
chimpanzees and rhesus or cynomolgus monkeys. The capability of ODN to stimulate<br>
human B cell proliferation (Table J) correlated well with their ability to induce CD86<br>
expression on B cells. ODN 2006 (SEQ ID NO.: 246), which showed the highest activity<br>
in human B cells and NK cells, was also the most active in stimulating chimpanzee and<br>
rhesus monkey B cell proliferation (Table J). ODN 1968 (SEQ ID NO.: 211) and ODN<br>
2006 (SEQ ID NO.: 246) gave the highest activation of cynomolgus monkey B-cells in<br>
vitro (SI of 25 and 29 respectively at 6 ï­g ODN/ml). Surprisingly, CpG ODN 2007<br>
(SEQ ID NO.: 247), which displayed similarly high activity as the optimal ODN 2006<br><br>
(SEQ ID NO.: 246) in human cells, did not stimulate Rhesus monkey or chimpanzee B<br>
cell proliferation, and the ODN 1968 (SEQ ID NO.: 211) showed low activity. CpG<br>
ODN originally identified with high activity in mice (ODN 1760 (SEQ ID NO.: 3), ODN<br>
1826 (SEQ ID NO.: 69)) showed little activity in monkeys (Table J).<br>
Table J: Proliferative response of PBMC to phosphorothioate CpG ODN in primates<br><br>
PBMC were prepared from peripheral blood and incubated with ODN (0.6 jig/ml) as<br>
indicated for five days. Proliferation was measured by uptake of 3H/thymidm5<br>
(cpm/1000) during the last 18 hours. More than 95 % of proliferating cells were B-cells<br>
10 as determined using the CFSE assay. Four human probands, six chimpanzees and two<br>
rhesus monkeys were tested.<br>
In vivo adjuvant activity of CpG ODN in chimpanzees and cynomolgus<br>
monkeys: In order to evaluate whether CpG ODN with strong in vitro stimulatory<br>
effects on primate cells had detectable adjuvant activity in vivo, Cynomolgus monkeys<br>
15 and chimpanzees were immunized with Engerix B, which comprises HBsAg adsorbed to<br><br>
alum, alone or with added ODN 1968 (500 ï­g) or ODN 2006 (SEQ ID NO.: 246) (1 mg)<br>
respectively. Compared to controls not receiving CpG ODN, anti-HBs titers at 4 weeks<br>
post-prime and 2 weeks post-boost were 66- and 16-fold higher respectively in the<br>
monkeys, and 15- and 3-fold higher in the chimpanzees (Table K). Thus a clear adjuvant<br>
effect of CpG ODN was seen, and this was particularly striking after a single<br><br>
3Animals were immunized by IM injection of Engerix B containing 10 ï­g HBsAg<br>
adsorbed to alum, alone or with added CpG ODN. Cynomolgus monkeys were boosted<br>
at 10 wks and chimpanzees were boosted at 4 wks post-prime. Anti-HBs was determined<br>
by ELISA assay; values for monkeys are GMT Â± SEM (n=5) whereas individual values<br>
for the two chimpanzees in each group are provided.<br>
