PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following complete specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a device for lifting and moving the vehicle. Particularly for lifting and moving the vehicle to place it on a raised position or on 4-poster for conducting tests.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Vehicle road simulation has been an effective development and validation tool within the ground-vehicle industry for many years. Full-vehicle road simulation facilities generally fall into two primary configurations: tire-coupled simulators, known as 4-Posters, and spindle-coupled simulators. A 4-Poster tire-coupled simulator has four posts each with a platform onto which a tire of a vehicle is attached. The 4-Poster has traditionally been used for body and body-component structural durability testing, particularly for lifting vehicle to place on 4 posters for conducting structural durability test in laden and unladen condition.<br>
Various lifting devices are used to lift the vehicles in laden and unladen condition on 4 poster for durability test. Vehicles such as cars, LCV and small utility vehicles are been tested on 4 poster for durability of body-component structural. To lift vehicles various methods/devices are used.<br>
The vehicle can be lifted either on wheel rim or on frame of the vehicle. For lifting on wheel rim the bolts are being removed and an adaptor is fitted to hook it. Overhead crane is used to raise the vehicle with help of chains. A cradle is used to lift the vehicle on frame. The cradle is pushed under the vehicle body and hooked to lift the vehicle. The above two methods have various demerits. It increases manual work and setup time. Manpower required is more. Various adaptors are required for various vehicles.     The fixtures used are not universal and need separate setup<br><br><br>
accordingly. The methods can be are also unsafe and if design is not correct may damage the vehicles during lifting. The loading and unloading time is more for testing in laden conditions.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide device for lifting and moving vehicle comprising, a space frame having at least four horizontal and four vertical members, said horizontal members form a closed horizontal frame, said vertical members extending downwardly from said horizontal frame, a telescopic arm rotatably connected to bottom of said vertical member and projecting horizontally, and a jack connected to end of said telescopic arm.<br>
The proposed device is simple in construction and universal in use. It also has the advantages of less fatigue work, less manpower and less time.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for the purpose of illustrating a preferred embodiment of the invention only, and not for the purpose of limiting the same.<br>
Referring to Figures, different components of proposed universal tackle are shown in figures 1 to 10. The tackle is having a rigid space frame with four horizontal members (1) forming as rectangular frame and four vertical members (2) connected at each corner of the rectangular frame and extending downwards. The top horizontal frame is having member running in longitudinal and lateral direction of the device. Further two horizontal members are connected to the bottom of the vertical members to strengthen the space frame. Connections are made using angle sections. Four hooks at each corner are provided to the raise the arrangement using any lifting mechanism such as overhead crane. Details of the hooks shown in Figs 8 to 10. The hook having two vertical elements (10a, 10b) with recess (10c) to insert a pin (10d) and these elements (10a, 10b) are connected to the horizontal members by any conventional methods. Hooks are provided on the top horizontal members of the space frame. Top rectangular frame further strengthened with another two horizontal member. At the bottom end of each vertical member a telescopic arm (3) is rotatably fixed. The telescopic arm is projecting horizontally and can be rotatable in vertical axis about the hinge located at bottom of the vertical members. The telescopic arm is having an internal (5) and an external member (4) and internal member sliding inside of the external member to get a telescopic action. A locking member (9) is provided with the inside member to restrict the movement of the internal member between a maximum and minimum extension possible. To swivel the telescopic member about vertical axis of the tackle the member is hinged to bottom of the vertical members. The external member (4) of telescopic arm (3) is fixed to a channel bracket member (7) where said bracket member can be rotated on a pin fixed on another bracket member (8)<br><br><br>
attached to the vertical frame. At the end of the internal member (5) of the telescopic arm (3) a jack is welded for vertical adjustment. The horizontal and vertical members (1,2) are made from metallic tubular members and connected by any conventional methods. The inner and outer members of the telescopic arm (3) are also made from tubular members and said outer member having higher cross sectional area compared to inner member so that the inner member can be moved freely inside the outer member.<br>
The telescopic arm (3) is adjusted manually to locate the jack (6) below the vehicle long member. The space frame is having sufficient height, width and length to accommodate vehicles meant for lifting. The tackle is brought to the location of the vehicle and placed so that the vertical members located outside body of the vehicle and the top horizontal frame located above the vehicle. The telescopic arm is manually adjusted to fix the jack (6) below the long member of the vehicle. The telescopic arm (3) can extend or rotate horizontally to fix the jack (6) below the long member. This will suit the device to use it for different kinds of vehicles. After fixing jack (6) the tackle is hooked and lifted using a crane. The hooks provided on the space frame are used for this purpose.<br>
The device is universal and can be used for lifting vehicles with different dimensions. It is easy to fix and man power required can be minimize with high safety operation.<br>
The foregoing description is a specific embodiment of the present invention. It should be appreciated that this embodiment is described for purpose of illustration only, and that numerous alterations and modifications may be practiced by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is intended that all such modifications and alterations be included insofar as they come within the scope of the invention as claimed or the equivalents thereof.<br><br><br>
