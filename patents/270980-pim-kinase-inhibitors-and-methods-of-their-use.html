				<td>PIM KINASE INHIBITORS AND METHODS OF THEIR USE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to new compounds and their tautomers and stereoisomers, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, metabolites or prodrugs thereof, compositions of the new compounds together with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, and uses of the new compounds, either alone or in combination with at least one additional therapeutic agent, in the prophylaxis or treatment of cancer.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] Infection with the Maloney retrovirus and genome integration in the host cell genome results in development of lymphomas in mice. Provirus Integration of Maloney Kinase (PIM-Kinase) was identified as one of the frequent proto-oncogenes capable of being transcriptionally activated by this retrovirus integration event (Cuypers HT etal., "Murine leukemia virus-induced T-cell lymphomagenesis: integration of proviruses in a distinct chromosomal region," Cell 37(l):141-50 (1984); Selten G, et al., "Proviral activation of the putative oncogene Pim-1 in MuLV induced T-cell lymphomas" EMBO J 4(7): 1793-8 (1985)), thus establishing a correlation between over-expression of this kinase and its oncogenic potential. Sequence homology analysis demonstrated that there are 3 highly homologous Pim-Kinases (Piml, 2 &amp; 3), Piml being the proto-oncogene originally identified by retrovirus integration. Furthermore, transgenic mice over-expressing Piml or Pim2 show increased incidence of T-cell lymphomas (Breuer M etal., "Very high frequency of lymphoma induction by a chemical carcinogen in pim-1 transgenic mice" Nature 340(6228):61-3 (1989)), while over-expression in conjunction with c-myc is associated with incidence of B-cell lymphomas (Verbeek S et al., "Mice bearing the E mu-myc and E mu-pim-1 transgenes develop pre-B-cell leukemia prenatally" Mol Cell Biol 11(2):1176-9 (1991)). Thus, these animal models establish a strong correlation between Pirn over-expression and oncogenesis in hematopoietic malignancies. In addition to these animal models, Pirn over-expression has been reported in many other human malignancies. Piml, 2 &amp; 3 over-expression is frequently observed in many hematopoietic malignancies (Amson R etal., "The human protooncogene product p33pim is expressed during fetal hematopoiesis and in diverse leukemias," PNAS USA 86(22):8857-61 (1989); Cohen AM et al., "Increased expression of the hPim-2 gene<br>
in human chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma," Leuk Lymph 45(5):951-5 (2004), Huttmann A etal., "Gene expression signatures separate B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia prognostic subgroups defined by ZAP-70 and CD38 expression status," Leukemia 20:1774-1782 (2006)) and in prostate cancer (Dhanasekaran SM, et al., "Delineation of prognostic biomarkers in prostate cancer," Nature 412(6849):822-6 (2001); Cibull TL, etal., "Overexpression of Pirn-1 during progression of prostatic adenocarcinoma," J Clin Pathol 59(3):285-8 (2006)), while over-expression of Pim3 is frequently observed in hepatocellular carcinoma (Fujii C, etal., "Aberrant expression of serine/threonine kinase Pim-3 in hepatocellular carcinoma development and its role in the proliferation of human hepatoma cell lines," Int J Cancer 114:209-218 (2005)) and pancreatic cancer (Li YY et al., "Pim-3, a proto-oncogene with serine/threonine kinase activity, is aberrantly expressed in human pancreatic cancer and phosphorylates bad to block bad-mediated apoptosis in human pancreatic cancer cell lines," Cancer Res 66(13):6741-7 (2006)).<br>
[0003] Piml, 2 &amp; 3 are Serine/Threonine kinases normally function in survival and proliferation of hematopoietic cells in response to growth factors and cytokines. Cytokines signaling through the Jak/Stat pathway leads to activation of transcription of the Pirn genes and synthesis of the proteins. No further post-translational modifications are required for the Kinase Pirn activity. Thus, signaling down stream is primarily controlled at the transcriptional/translational and protein turnover level. Substrates for Pirn kinases include regulators of apoptosis such as the Bcl-2 family member BAD (Aho T etal., "Pim-1 kinase promotes inactivation of the pro-apoptotic Bad protein by phosphorylating it on the Serll2 gatekeeper site,: FEBS Letters 571: 43-49 (2004)), cell cycle regulators such as p2iWFA1/CIP1 (Wang Z, etal., "Phosphorylation of the cell cycle inhibitor p21Cipl/WAFl by Pim-1 kinase," Biochim Biophys Acta 1593:45- 55 (2002)), CDC25A (1999), C-TAK (Bachmann M et al., "The Oncogenic Serine/Threonine Kinase Pim-1 Phosphorylates and Inhibits the Activity of Cdc25C-associated Kinase 1 (C-TAK1). A novel role for Pim-1 at the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint," J Biol Chem 179:48319-48328 (2004)) and NuMA (Bhattacharya N, etal., "Pim-1 associates with protein complexes necessary for mitosis," Chromosoma lll(2):80-95 (2002)) and the protein synthesis regulator 4EBP1 (Hammerman PS et al., "Pirn and Akt oncogenes are independent regulators of hematopoietic cell growth and survival," Blood 105(11):4477-83 (2005)).   The effects of Pim(s) in these regulators are consistent with a role in<br>
protection from apoptosis and promotion of cell proliferation and growth. Thus, over-expression of Pim(s) in cancer is thought to play a role in promoting survival and proliferation of cancer cells and, therefore, their inhibitions should be an effective way of treating cancers on which they are over-expressed. In fact several reports indicate that knocking down expression of Pim(s) with siRNA results in inhibition of proliferation and cell death (Dai JM, et al., "Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeting the serine/threonine kinase Pim-2 inhibited proliferation of DU-145 cells," Acta Pharmacol Sin 26(3):364-8 (2005); Fujii et al. 2005; Li et al. 2006). Furthermore, mutational activation of several well know oncogenes in hematopoietic malignancies are thought exert its effects at least in part through Pim(s). For example, targeted down regulation of pirn expression impairs survival of hematopoietic cells transformed by Flt3 and BCR/ABL (Adam et al. 2006). Thus, inhibitors to Piml, 2 &amp;3 would be useful in the treatment of these malignancies. In addition to a potential role in cancer treatment and myeloproliferative diseases, such inhibitor could be useful to control expansion of immune cells in other pathologic condition such as autoimmune diseases, allergic reactions and in organ transplantation rejection syndromes. This notion is supported by the findings that differentiation of Thl Helper T-cells by IL-12 and IFN-a results in induction of expression of both Piml&amp;2 (Aho T et al., "Expression of human Pirn family genes is selectively up-regulated by cytokines promoting T helper type 1, but not T helper type 2, cell differentiation," Immunology 116: 82-88 (2005)). Moreover, Pim(s) expression is inhibited in both cell types by the immunosuppressive TGF-p (Aho et al. 2005). These results suggest that Pirn kinases are involved in the early differentiation process of Helper T-cells, which coordinate the immunological responses in autoimmune diseases, allergic reaction and tissue transplant rejection.<br>
[0004] In addition to PIM-Kinase, several other kinases have been shown to be directly involved in cancer, such as Flt3, KDR and PKCe. For example, several types of activating mutations in Flt3 are found in 20-30 % of patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). These activating mutations are thought to be the most relevant transformation event on these patients and currently several Flt3 inhibitors are being tested for the treatment on these patients in clinical trials (for a recent review see Tichenbrock L et al., "Emerging Flt3 kinase inhibitors in the treatment of leukaemia," Expert Opin Emerg Drugs 11:153-165 (2006)). KDR is one of the receptors for VEGF that plays a critical role in tumor angiogenesis and it's the target for the clinically<br>
validated bevacizumab drug (for a recent review see Ranieri G etal., "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a target of bevacizumab in cancer: from the biology to the clinic," Curr Med Chem 13: 1845-1857 (2006)). Finally, over-expression in NIH3T3 cells of PKCe has been shown to transform cell in vitro and promote tumor formation in vivo (Perletti etal. Oncogene 12: 847 (1996); Mischak etal., J Biol Chem 268: 6090 (1993)). In addition, over-expression of PKCs in the LNCaP cell line results in its transformation to an androgen-independent tumor growth in nude nice (Wu et al., Cancer Research 62: 2423 (2002)). Furthermore, over-expression of PKCe in transgenic mouse epithelium accelerates the development of highly malignant and rapidly metastasizing squamous cell carcinomas (Jansen et al., Cancer Research 61: 808 (2001)). Finally, clinically if has been observed that high PKCe expression in human tumors is associated with poor disease-free and poor overall survival (Pan et al., Cancer Research 65: 8366 (2005)). Thus, the compounds described here could be useful in treating cancer by inhibiting these well validated targets of cancer drugs.<br>
[0005] A continuing need exists for compounds that inhibit the proliferation of capillaries, inhibit the growth of tumors, treat cancer, modulate cell cycle arrest, and/or inhibit molecules such as Piml, Pim2, Pim3, Flt3, KDR and PKCe, and pharmaceutical formulations and medicaments that contain such compounds. A need also exists for methods of administering such compounds, pharmaceutical formulations, and medicaments to patients or subjects in need thereof.<br>

[0069] The term "cancer" refers to cancer diseases that can be beneficially treated by the inhibition of Pirn kinase, including, for example, solid cancers, such as carcinomas (e.g., of the lungs, pancreas, thyroid, ovarian, bladder, breast, prostate, or colon), melanomas, myeloid disorders (e.g., myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma and erythroleukemia), adenomas (e.g., villous colon adenoma) and sarcomas (e.g., osteosarcoma).<br>
[0070] In other aspects, the present invention relates to the processes for preparing the compounds of Formulas (I), (II) f(III) or IV, and to the synthetic intermediates useful in such processes, as described in detail below.<br>
Synthetic Methods<br>
[0071] The compounds of the invention can be obtained through procedures known to the skilled in the art. For example, as shown in Scheme 1, 4-chloro, 3-nitro pyridine can be reacted with a nucleophile yielding after nitro reduction a 4-substituted 3-amino pyridine I. Alternatively, 3-bromo 4-nitro pyridine N-oxide can be reacted with a<br>
nucleophile, yielding after nitro and N-oxide reduction a 3-substituted 4- amino pyridine II. The substituted amino pyridines I and II can be acylated with carboxylic acids with the aid of coupling agents, or with acid halides or acid anhydrides yielding 3, 4 disubstituted pyridines III and IV. Compounds of the invention containing 3, 4 disubstituted phenyls can be obtained using chemistry analogous to that in Scheme 1 when 3 halo 4 nitro benzenes are the starting materials. Scheme 1.<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
 [0072] Alternatively 3,4 disubstituted pyridines, as depicted in Scheme 2, can be obtained by reacting halo nitro pyridines with boronic acids under Suzuki conditions, followed by nitro or nitro and N-oxide reduction yielding amino substituted pyridines V and VII. Subsequent amine acylation yields 3,4-disubstituted pyridines VI and VIII. Compounds of the invention containing 3,4-disubstituted phenyls can be obtained using chemistry analogous to that in Scheme 2 when 3-halo, 4-nitro benzenes are the starting materials. Scheme 2.<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
[0073] In an alternative manner, 3,4-disubstituted pyridines can be obtained as depicted in Scheme 3. Formation of the bis-anion of N-Boc-3-aminopyridine or N-pivaloyl-3-aminopyridine and reaction with an electrophile yields 4-substituted, 3-N-protected amino pyridine IX. Acidic removal of the Boc or Piv protecting group and subsequent acylation yields the 3,4-substituted pyridine X. Compounds of the invention containing 3,4-disubstituted phenyls can be obtained using chemistry analogous to that in Scheme 3 when suitably protected anilines are the starting materials. Scheme 3.<br><br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
[0074]      Compounds of the invention containing 5-substituted, 4-aminoacyl pyrimidones such as XII and XIII can be obtained as depicted in Scheme 4. Nucleophilic substitution or Suzuki type coupling of 5-bromocytosine followed by N-acylation yields the 5-substituted, 4-aminoacyl pyrimidones. Scheme 4.<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
[0075] When the amide portion of substituted pyridines, benzenes or pyrimidones contains a haloheteroaryl group, the substituted pyridines, benzenes or pyrimidones can be modified as depicted in Scheme 5. Direct carbon linked groups (R')<br>
can be attached to the heteroaryl group using Suzuki, Neghishi, Grignard or other organometallic methodologies.    Alternatively nitrogen, oxygen,  sulfur and carbon nucleophiles can be attached to the heteroaryl group utilizing standard methodologies including SnAr or Buchwald/Hartwig conditions. Scheme 5.<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
 [0076] The compounds of the invention are useful in vitro or in vivo in inhibiting the growth of cancer cells. The compounds may be used alone or in compositions together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients include, for example, processing agents and drug delivery modifiers and enhancers, such as, for example, calcium phosphate, magnesium stearate, talc, monosaccharides, disaccharides, starch, gelatin, cellulose, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, dextrose, hydroxypropyl-p-cyclodextrin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, low melting waxes, ion exchange resins, and the like, as well as combinations of any two or more thereof. Other suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are described in "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences," Mack Pub. Co., New Jersey (1991), incorporated herein by reference.<br>
 [0077] Effective amounts of the compounds of the invention generally include any amount sufficient to detectably inhibit Pirn activity by any of the assays described herein, by other Pirn kinase activity assays known to those having ordinary skill in the art or by detecting an inhibition or alleviation of symptoms of cancer.<br>
[0078] The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy. The therapeutically effective amount for a given situation can be readily determined by routine experimentation and is within the skill and judgment of the ordinary clinician.<br>
[0079] For purposes of the present invention, a therapeutically effective dose will generally be a total daily dose administered to a host in single or divided doses may be in amounts, for example, of from 0.001 to 1000 mg/kg body weight daily and more preferred from 1.0 to 30 mg/kg body weight daily. Dosage unit compositions may contain such amounts of submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose.<br>
[0080] The compounds of the present invention may be administered orally, parenterally, sublingually, by aerosolization or inhalation spray, rectally, or topically in dosage unit formulations containing conventional nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, and vehicles as desired. Topical administration may also involve the use of transdermal administration such as transdermal patches or ionophoresis devices. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection, or infusion techniques.<br>
[0081] Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-propanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may<br>
be employed including synthetic mono- or di-glycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.<br>
[0082] Suppositories for rectal administration of the drug can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable nonirritating excipient such as cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols, which are solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum and release the drug.<br>
[0083] Solid dosage forms for oral administration may include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate. In the case of capsules, tablets, and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings.<br>
[0084] Liquid dosage forms for oral administration may include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water. Such compositions may also comprise adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, cyclodextrins, and sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.<br>
[0085] The compounds of the present invention can also be administered in the form of liposomes. As is known in the art, liposomes are generally derived from phospholipids or other lipid substances. Liposomes are formed by mono- or multilamellar hydrated liquid crystals that are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any nontoxic, physiologically acceptable and metabolizable lipid capable of forming liposomes can be used. The present compositions in liposome form can contain, in addition to a compound of the present invention, stabilizers, preservatives, excipients, and the like. The preferred lipids are the phospholipids and phosphatidyl cholines (lecithins), both natural and synthetic. Methods to form liposomes are known in the art. See, for example, Prescott, Ed., Methods in Cell Biology, Volume XIV, Academic Press, New York, N.W., p. 33 et seq. (1976).<br>
[0086] While the compounds of the invention can be administered as the sole active pharmaceutical agent, they can also be used in combination with one or more other agents used in the treatment of cancer. The compounds of the present invention are also useful in combination with known therapeutic agents and anti-cancer agents, and<br>
combinations of the presently disclosed compounds with other anti-cancer or chemotherapeutic agents are within the scope of the invention. Examples of such agents can be found in Cancer Principles and Practice of Oncology, V. T. Devita and S. Hellman (editors), 6th edition (Feb. 15, 2001), Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins Publishers. A person of ordinary skill in the art would be able to discern which combinations of agents would be useful based on the particular characteristics of the drugs and the cancer involved. Such anti-cancer agents include, but are not limited to, the following: estrogen receptor modulators, androgen receptor modulators, retinoid receptor modulators, cytotoxic/cytostatic agents, antiproliferative agents, prenyl-protein transferase inhibitors, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and other angiogenesis inhibitors, inhibitors of cell proliferation and survival signaling, apoptosis inducing agents and agents that interfere with cell cycle checkpoints. The compounds of the invention are also useful when coadministered with radiation therapy.<br>
[0087] Therefore, in one embodiment of the invention, the compounds of the invention are also used in combination with known anticancer agents including, for example, estrogen receptor modulators, androgen receptor modulators, retinoid receptor modulators, cytotoxic agents, antiproliferative agents, prenyl-protein transferase inhibitors, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, HIV protease inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and other angiogenesis inhibitors.<br>

Representative examples of androgen receptor modulators include finasteride and other 5a-reductase inhibitors, nilutamide, flutamide, bicalutamide, liarozole, and abiraterone acetate. Retinoid receptor modulators are compounds which interfere or inhibit the binding of retinoids to a retinoid receptor.

Other therapeutic agents that modulate or inhibit angiogenesis and may also be used in combination with the compounds of the instant invention include agents that modulate or inhibit the coagulation and fibrinolysis systems (see review in Clin. Chem. La. Med. 35:679-692 (2000)). Examples of such agents that modulate or inhibit the coagulation and fibrinolysis pathways include, but are not limited to, heparin (see Thromb. Haemost. 80:10-23 (1998)), low molecular weight heparins and carboxypeptidase U inhibitors (also known as inhibitors of active thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor [TAFIa]) (see Thrombosis Res. 101:329-354 (2001)). TAFIa inhibitors have been described in PCT Publication WO 03/013,526 and U.S. Ser. No. 60/349,925 (filed Jan. 18, 2002).  The invention also encompasses combinations of<br>

[0094] Agents that interfere with cell cycle checkpoints are compounds that inhibit protein kinases that transduce cell cycle checkpoint signals, thereby sensitizing the cancer cell to DNA damaging agents. Such agents include inhibitors of ATR, ATM, the Chkl and Chk2 kinases and cdk and cdc kinase inhibitors and are specifically exemplified by 7-hydroxystaurosporin, flavopiridol, CYC202 (Cyclacel) and BMS-387032.<br>
[0095] Inhibitors of cell proliferation and survival signaling pathway are pharmaceutical agents that inhibit cell surface receptors and signal transduction cascades downstream of those surface receptors. Such agents include inhibitors of inhibitors of EGFR (for example gefitinib and erlotinib), inhibitors of ERB-2 (for example trastuzumab), inhibitors of IGFR, inhibitors of cytokine receptors, inhibitors of MET, inhibitors of PI3K (for example LY294002), serine/threonine kinases (including but not limited to inhibitors of Akt such as described in WO 02/083064, WO 02/083139, WO 02/083140 and WO 02/083138), inhibitors of Raf kinase (for example BAY-43-9006 ), inhibitors of MEK (for example CI-1040 and PD-098059) and inhibitors of mTOR (for example Wyeth CCI-779). Such agents include small molecule inhibitor compounds and antibody antagonists.<br>
[0096] Apoptosis inducing agents include activators of TNF receptor family members (including the TRAIL receptors).<br>
[0097] In certain presently preferred embodiments of the invention, representative agents useful in combination with the compounds of the invention for the treatment of cancer include, for example, irinotecan, topotecan, gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin carboplatin, cisplatin, taxanes, tezacitabine, cyclophosphamide, vinca alkaloids, imatinib (Gleevec), anthracyclines, rituximab, trastuzumab, as well as other cancer chemotherapeutic agents.<br>
[0098] The above compounds to be employed in combination with the compounds of the invention will be used in therapeutic amounts as indicated in the<br>
Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR) 47th Edition (1993), which is incorporated herein by reference, or such therapeutically useful amounts as would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0099] The compounds of the invention and the other anticancer agents can be administered at the recommended maximum clinical dosage or at lower doses. Dosage levels of the active compounds in the compositions of the invention may be varied so as to obtain a desired therapeutic response depending on the route of administration, severity of the disease and the response of the patient. The combination can be administered as separate compositions or as a single dosage form containing both agents. When administered as a combination, the therapeutic agents can be formulated as separate compositions, which are given at the same time or different times, or the therapeutic agents, can be given as a single composition.<br>
[0100] Antiestrogens, such as tamoxifen, inhibit breast cancer growth through induction of cell cycle arrest, that requires the action of the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip. Recently, it has been shown that activation of the Ras-Raf-MAP Kinase pathway alters the phosphorylation status of p27Kip such that its inhibitory activity in arresting the cell cycle is attenuated, thereby contributing to antiestrogen resistance (Donovan etal., J. Biol. Chem. 27(5:40888, 2001). As reported by Donovan etal., inhibition of MAPK signaling through treatment with MEK inhibitor changed the phosphorylation status of p27 in hormone refactory breast cancer cell lines and in so doing restored hormone sensitivity. Accordingly, in one aspect, the compounds of formulas (I), (II), (III) and (IV) may be used in the treatment of hormone dependent cancers, such as breast and prostate cancers, to reverse hormone resistance commonly seen in these cancers with conventional anticancer agents.<br>
[0101] In hematological cancers, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), chromosomal translocation is responsible for the constitutively activated BCR-AB1 tyrosine kinase. The afflicted patients are responsive to Gleevec, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, as a result of inhibition of Abl kinase activity. However, many patients with advanced stage disease respond to Gleevec initially, but then relapse later due to resistance-conferring mutations in the Abl kinase domain. In vitro studies have demonstrated that BCR-Avl employs the Raf kinase pathway to elicit its effects. In addition, inhibiting more than one kinase in the same pathway provides additional protection against resistance-conferring mutations. Accordingly, in another aspect of the<br>
invention, the compounds of formulas (I), (II), (III) and (IV) are used in combination with at least one additional agent, such as Gleevec, in the treatment of hematological cancers, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), to reverse or prevent resistance to the at least one additional agent.<br>
[0102] In another aspect, the present invention relates to methods of inhibiting at least one serine/threonine kinase in the Jak/Stat signaling pathway in a subject, or treating a biological condition mediated by a serine/threonine kinase in the Jak/Stat signaling pathway in a subject, comprising administering a therapeutic composition comprising at least one compound of formula (I), (II), (III) or (IV) effective to inhibit the activity of the at least one serine/threonine kinase in the Jak/Stat signaling pathway in the subject.<br>
[0103] The therapeutic compositions in accordance with this aspect of the invention are useful for treating patients with a need for such inhibitors (e.g., those suffering from cancer mediated by abnormal Jak/Stat signaling). Cancer types mediated by abnormal Jak/Stat signaling include, for example, melanoma, papillary cancer, thyroid cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and acute myeloid leukemia.<br>
[0104] In one embodiment, the invention provides a method of inhibiting Piml, Pim2 Pim3, Flt3, KDR or PKCe in a human or animal subject. The method includes administering an effective amount of a compound, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, of any of the embodiments of compounds of formula (I), (II), (III) or (IV) to a subject in need thereof.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
[0107] Referring to the examples that follow, compounds of the preferred embodiments were synthesized using the methods described herein, or other methods, which are known in the art.<br>
 [0108] The compounds and/or intermediates were characterized by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Waters Millenium chromatography system with a 2695 Separation Module (Milford, MA). The analytical columns were reversed phase Phenomenex Luna C18 -5 µ, 4.6 x 50 mm, from Alltech (Deerfield, IL). A gradient elution was used (flow 2.5 mL/min), typically starting with 5% acetonitrile/95% water and progressing to 100% acetonitrile over a period of 10 minutes. All solvents contained 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Compounds were detected by ultraviolet light (UV) absorption at either 220 or 254 nm. HPLC solvents were from Burdick and Jackson (Muskegan, MI), or Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA).<br>
[0109] In some instances, purity was assessed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using glass or plastic backed silica gel plates, such as, for example, Baker-Flex Silica Gel 1B2-F flexible sheets. TLC results were readily detected visually under ultraviolet light, or by employing well-known iodine vapor and other various staining techniques.<br>

All masses were reported as those of the protonated parent ions.<br>
[0111] GCMS analysis was performed on a Hewlett Packard instrument (HP6890 Series gas chromatograph with a Mass Selective Detector 5973; injector volume: 1 µL; initial column temperature: 50°C; final column temperature: 250°C; ramp time: 20 minutes; gas flow rate: 1 mL/min; column: 5% phenyl methyl siloxane, Model No. HP 190915-443, dimensions: 30.0 m x 25 m x 0.25 m).<br>
 [0112] Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis was performed on some of the compounds with a Varian 300 MHz NMR (Palo Alto, CA). The spectral reference was either TMS or the known chemical shift of the solvent. Some compound samples were run at elevated temperatures (e.g., 75°C) to promote increased sample solubility.<br>
[0113] The purity of some of the compounds is assessed by elemental analysis (Desert Analytics, Tucson, AZ).<br>
[0114] Melting points are determined on a Laboratory Devices Mel-Temp apparatus (Holliston, MA).<br>
[0115] Preparative separations are carried out using a Flash 40 chromatography system and KP-Sil, 60A (Biotage, Charlottesville, VA), or by flash column chromatography using silica gel (230-400 mesh) packing material, or by HPLC using a Waters 2767 Sample Manager, C-18 reversed phase column, 30X50 mm, flow 75 mL/min. Typical solvents employed for the Flash 40 Biotage system and flash column chromatography are dichloromethane, methanol, ethyl acetate, hexane, acetone, aqueous ammonia (or ammonium hydroxide), and triethyl amine. Typical solvents employed for the reverse phase FIPLC are varying concentrations of acetonitrile and water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
