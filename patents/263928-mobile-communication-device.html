				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[001]The present invention relates generally to a mobile communication device capable of<br>
improving low sound performance and more particularly to a mobile communication device having a<br>
speaker module.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
[002]A mobile communication device including a mobile phone or a PDA is one of many mobile<br>
electronic devices allowing a user to wirelessly transmit, receive, read, or process information while<br>
traveling.<br>
[003]Spurred by the recent advancement of the information technologies, communication<br>
technologies, and memory technologies, mobile communication devices can directly create, transmit,<br>
or receive multimedia, in addition to their inherent call functions. For example, mobile<br>
communication devices can reproduce multimedia files such as music, movies or games, and even<br>
have a function of receiving digital multimedia broadcasting (DMB) using satellite or terrestrial<br>
television channels. For those mobile communication devices equipped with a digital camera, the<br>
devices can also capture images or videos, transmit images or video, or otherwise allow users to<br>
enjoy the images or video obtained using the digital cameras.<br>
[004]To help users enjoy the multimedia experience through the mobile communication devices,<br>
speakers mounted in the mobile communication devices are moving towards providing high sound<br>
performance. Meanwhile, the mobile communication devices are becoming lighter and thinner for<br>
user's convenience in carrying them around, which may cause problems as more sophisticated<br>
speakers are incorporated into the mobile communication devices. Therefore, there is a need to<br>
provide a speaker unit that does not take up unnecessarily excessive space in the mobile<br>
communication device but still provides higher sound performance.<br>
[005]The speaker unit of the related art mobile communication device will now be described with<br>
reference to FIG. 1. FIG. 1 is a sectional view showing a speaker portion of the related art mobile<br>
2<br><br>
communication device. As shown in FIG. 1, the mobile communication device 11 includes first and<br>
second housings 12 and 13 supporting internal components and forming the exterior thereof, and a<br>
speaker unit 16 is fixed at an inner side of the second housing 13.<br>
[006]Through holes 15 are formed on the second housing 13 to allow a sound (A) emitted from a<br>
front surface of the speaker unit 16 to pass therethrough, and accordingly, sound waves are<br>
discharged to the exterior after passing through the through holes 15.<br>
[007]Ribs 14 are formed on an inner surface of the second housing 13 to fix the speaker unit 16, and<br>
the speaker unit 16 is tightly attached to the ribs 14 so that the sound emitted from its front side<br>
cannot be leaked to the interior of the mobile communication device.<br>
[008] Gaskets 17 are installed at an inner side of the ribs 14 to ensure the speaker unit 16 to be tightly<br>
attached. With such a structure, the speaker unit 16 generates sounds A and B according to signals<br>
transmitted from a board 18 provided within the housings 12 and 13. However, one of the problems<br>
with the above configuration is that the sound (A) emitting from the front side of the speaker unit 16<br>
is interfered with by the sound (B) generated from the rear surface of the speaker unit 16 and having<br>
the opposite phase, thereby degrading the performance of the speaker unit 16. In other words, in case<br>
of a low band, because it has strong diffraction, the sound (A) generated from the front side and the<br>
sound (B) generated from the rear side having the opposite phase to that of the sound (A) are mixed<br>
and cancel each other out.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0039]The mobile communication device according to exemplary embodiments of the present<br>
invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
[0040]FIG. 2 is a perspective view of a mobile communication device according to a first exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention, FIG. 3 is a sectional view taken along line III—III in FIG. 2, and<br>
FIG. 4 is an exploded perspective view of the mobile communication device in FIG. 2.<br>
[0041]With reference to FIG. 2, a mobile communication device 100 includes a terminal body 110<br>
forming the exterior of the mobile communication device 100. The terminal body 110 includes a<br>
front housing 110A and a rear housing 110B assembled together.<br>
[0042]A keypad 114 including a plurality of input keys is installed to be exposed from a front<br>
surface of the front housing 110A, and a window 115 is provided at an upper side of the keypad 114<br>
to allow a user to watch a screen image outputted from a display module 1 13. A microphone 116 for<br>
inputting voice or other sound is provided at a lower end of the front housing 1 10A, and a battery<br>
117 that supplies power to the mobile communication device 110 is provided at a rear surface of the<br>
rear housing 11 OB.<br>
[0043]A speaker module 120 is provided at an upper end portion of the front housing 110A. As<br>
shown, the speaker module 120 may also have a function of a receiver or may be implemented as a<br>
separate component from the receiver. In addition, while the speaker module is shown at an upper<br>
end portion of the front housing 110A adjacent the display module 113, the speaker module may be<br>
located at other locations within the terminal body 110.<br>
[0044]While the mobile communication device 100 has been shown as a bar type mobile<br>
communication device, it is understood that other types of mobile communication devices can<br>
incorporate the speaker module 120, such as for example, sliding types, folding types, and<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
[0045]With reference to FIGS. 3 and 4, a speaker hole or mounting hole 1 1 1 is formed on a front<br>
surface of the front housing 110A, and a speaker module 120 is tightly attached at an inner side of<br>
the speaker hole 111.<br>
6<br><br>
[0046]The speaker module 120 includes an enclosure 122 fixed within the front housing 110A and<br>
having a chamber (C) therein. The speaker module also includes a speaker 121 mounted in the<br>
enclosure such that the speaker's front side is exposed and the speaker's rear side is positioned at the<br>
interior of the chamber (C) so that a sound (B) generated from the rear side can resonate within the<br>
chamber (C).<br>
[0047]The enclosure 122 includes a mounting hole 124 formed on a front surface thereof and having<br>
a size corresponding to the front side of the speaker 121, and the speaker 121 is located in the<br>
enclosure 122 such that its front side is exposed through the mounting hole 124.<br>
[0048]The enclosure 122 includes a front case 122A that holds the speaker 121 and a rear case 122B<br>
attached to the front case 122A to form the chamber (C). The front and rear cases 122A and 122B<br>
can be made of a resin material so as to be easily formed, and can be fixed by an adhesive or<br>
mutually fused to be combined to hermetically close the internal chamber (C).<br>
[0049]The speaker 121 may include a converter (e.g., a combination of a magnet and a coil) and a<br>
vibration plate that generate vibration by electricity or can be operated by a piezoelectric method<br>
(not shown).<br>
[0050]Gaskets 128 are provided on an edge of the front surface of the speaker 121 so that when the<br>
enclosure 122 is mounted in the speaker hole ill of the front housing 110A, sounds within the<br>
terminal body 110 cannot be directly leaked out into the terminal body 110. The gaskets 128 can be<br>
made of an elastic material such as a double-sided tape.<br>
[0051]Accordingly, the sound (A) generated from the front side of the speaker 121 is emitted<br>
through the speaker hole 111, while the sound (B) generated from the rear side of the speaker 121<br>
resonates within the chamber (C) to provide a low sound to the exterior of the mobile<br>
communication device 100.<br>
[0052]With reference to FIGS. 3 and 4, the enclosure 122 has a width corresponding to the width of<br>
the interior of the terminal body 110, and thus, volume of the interior of the chamber (C) is increased<br>
to facilitate implementation of the low sound by echoing.<br>
[0053]Connection protrusions 119 are fixed by a screw on an inner surface of the front and rear<br>
housings 110A and HOB, and through holes 123 are formed at both end portions of the enclosure<br>
7<br><br>
122 to allow the connection protrusions 119 to pass therethrough. Accordingly, the enclosure 122<br>
can lead to improvement of the performance of the speaker 121 without causing much change in<br>
designing the internal structure of the terminal body 110. In other words, the enclosure 122 can be<br>
adapted to interiors of mobile communication devices having many different configurations while<br>
still providing a sufficiently sized chamber (C).<br>
[0054]The enclosure 122 can be formed in a shape conforming to the upper end portion of the<br>
terminal body 110. Specifically, by tightly attaching the enclosure 122 to the inner surface of the<br>
terminal body 110 while enlarging the size of the chamber (C) for resonance effect, disused space<br>
can be minimized within the mobile communication device 100.<br>
[0055]The chamber (C) may have a size that can supplement pressure changes at the rear surface of<br>
the speaker 121 when the speaker 121 is operated. As shown in FIG. 3. the thickness (D) of the<br>
chamber (C) can be smaller than the width (W) and the width (W) substantially corresponds to the<br>
horizontal width of the mobile communication device 100, to thus lengthen the capacity of the<br>
chamber (C). This arrangement can reinforce the low sound performance by virtue of the lengthened<br>
capacity while implementing the slim mobile communication device 100 without affecting the space<br>
taken by other components.<br>
[0056]FIG. 5 is an exploded perspective view of a mobile communication device according to a<br>
second exemplary embodiment of the present invention. With reference to FIG. 5, a speaker module<br>
200 includes sound guides 230 and 240, each sound guide 230 and 240 having a certain length and<br>
communicating with a chamber (C) of an enclosure 222. The sound guides 230 and 240 guide the<br>
sound generated from a rear surface of a speaker 221, and as shown in FIG. 5, the sound resonates<br>
within the chamber (C), discharges to the interior of a mobile communication device 200 through the<br>
sound guides 230 and 240, and then transfers to the exterior through a front housing 210A or a rear<br>
housing 210B. With this structure, a low-band sound can be more abundantly outputted.<br>
[0057]There can be multiple units of the sound guides 230 and 240 and they can be disposed to be<br>
separated from each other.<br>
[0058]As shown in FIG. 5, electric wires 250 connected with the speaker 221 can be wired to pass or<br>
extend through the interior of the sound guide 230. Accordingly, no other space for connecting the<br>
speaker 221 is needed, thereby facilitating the processing and assembling of the speaker module 200.<br>
8<br><br>
[0059]In FIG. 5, the sound guides 230 and 240 are disposed between the enclosure 222 and a display<br>
module 213. Specifically, the sound guides 230 and 240 are formed with such a length as to be<br>
disposed within a space between the enclosure 222, which may be relatively narrow to enlarge the<br>
area of the display module 213 as much as possible, and the display module 213.<br>
[0060]Other components and members are the same as those in the first exemplary embodiment of<br>
the present invention. Equivalent (corresponding) components or members are given the same or<br>
similar reference numerals, and a detailed description thereof will be omitted. This is the same for<br>
third to sixth exemplary embodiments of the present invention.<br>
[0061]FIG. 6 is a vertical sectional view of a mobile communication device according to the third<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 6, an enclosure 322 is connected<br>
with a sound guide 330 extending with a certain length (L) from a chamber (C) to the interior of a<br>
mobile communication device 300. The sound guide 330 has an opened end portion to allow a<br>
second sound (B) generated from a rear side of a speaker 321 to be guided within the mobile<br>
communication device 300 and outputted.<br>
[0062]The sound guide 330 can be assembled by being inserted around an opening 325 of the<br>
chamber (C). The sound guide 330 can be disposed at edge portions of a display module 313 and the<br>
terminal body 310 so as not to affect the interior components of the mobile communication device<br>
300, such as the display module 313.<br>
[0063]Because the sound (B) generated from the rear side of the speaker 321 has the opposite phase<br>
to that of the sound (A) (refer to FIG. 3) generated from the front side of the speaker 321, the length<br>
(L) of the sound guide 330 can be obtained by following equation (1) in order to prevent the sounds<br>
from being interfered with each other to cancel each other. The length (L) can be tuned by a different<br>
factor:<br><br>
wherein 'S' is an opening section (cm2) of the sound guide 330 and 0.2 to 0.5 of a valid vibration<br>
radius of the speaker 321, fb, is tuning frequency (Hz), Vh is volume (1) of the hermetically closed<br>
space of the chamber (C), and the unit of length(L) is .<br>
9<br><br>
[0064]According to equation (1), as the sound to be tuned is turning into a low sound, fb becomes<br>
small while 'L' becomes long. Specifically, in order to improve the low sound, a sufficient length<br>
from the rear surface of the speaker 321 should be secured.<br>
[0065]Accordingly, a large amount of a high sound band of a sound emitted after being generated<br>
from the rear surface of the speaker dies away while a low sound band with strong diffraction is<br>
emitted in a phase-inverted state along the sound guide 330 providing an air path, and thus, the<br>
amount of cancellation of the low sound can be reduced on the whole and the low sound of the<br>
speaker module 320 can be improved.<br>
[0066]Table 1 shows data obtained by measuring low sound band improvement effects according to<br>
the construction of the present invention. In the corresponding experimentation, the chamber (C) has<br>
a volume of 0.4cc and the sound guide 330 has a length of about 1cm and an opening section of<br>
about 0.06cm2.<br>
[0067] [Table 1]<br><br>
Tuning Frequency (Hz)	300	500	700<br>
Sound Pressure without sound guide (dB)	34.7	47.2	54.8<br>
Sound Pressure with sound guide (dB)	38.8	53.0	59.7 *<br>
[0068]According to Table 1, comparing a mobile communication device with the sound guide 330 to<br>
a mobile communication device without the sound guide 330, the sound pressure levels at 300Hz,<br>
500Hz and 700Hz were higher by about 4.1dB, 5.8dB and 4.9dB, respectively. This means that the<br>
low sound is improved by providing the sound guide 330.<br>
[0069]FIG. 7 is a vertical sectional view of a mobile communication device according to a fourth<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0070]With reference to FIG. 7, an enclosure 422 includes first and second openings 425 and 426<br>
communicating with a chamber (C) and separately disposed from each other. First and second sound<br>
guides 430 and 440 are connected with the first and second openings 425 and 426. respectively. The<br>
second sounds B and B' are emitted through the first and second sound guides 430 and 440. In this<br>
10<br><br>
case, the first and second sound guides 430 and 440 have opening sections (S) that can be<br>
changeable to allow frequency tuning.<br>
[0071]The sound guide 430 is formed to be flexible so it can be disposed to be bent or curved along<br>
a remaining space within a mobile communication device 400. Specifically, as shown in FIG. 7, the<br>
first sound guide 430 may include a bent portion 432 formed to make a detour to avoid a component<br>
433 of the mobile communication device 400. Thus, despite the sound guides being required to have<br>
certain lengths, restrictions in designing and placing components in the mobile communication<br>
device 400 can be reduced to diversify the designs and allow for greater flexibility.<br>
[0072]FIG. 8 is a vertical sectional view of a mobile communication device according to a fifth<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 8, a sound guide 530 includes a<br>
length control portion 532 that may control its length (L). Because the length of the sound guide 530<br>
can be directly controlled, fine-tuning can be accomplished.<br>
[0073]The length control portion 532 will now be described in detail. The length control portion 532<br>
includes a crease portion 533 at a certain portion of the sound guide 530, the crease portion 533<br>
having a plurality of creases that are elastically extensible. Thus, without causing a change in a<br>
sectional area of the sound guide 530, the crease portion 533 can be folded or smoothed out to<br>
control the overall length (L) of the sound guide 530.<br>
[0074]FIG. 9 is a vertical sectional view of a mobile communication device according to a sixth<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. 10 is a vertical sectional view of the<br>
mobile communication device in FIG. 9, taken along line X-X.<br>
[0075]With reference to FIG. 9, on a front surface of a front housing 610A, there are formed a first<br>
speaker hole 611 and a second speaker hole 612 spaced apart from the first speaker hole 611.<br>
[0076]With reference to FIG. 10, a first enclosure 622 with a speaker 623 mounted therein is<br>
provided at an inner side of the first speaker hole 611, and a hollow second enclosure 650 is<br>
provided at an inner side of the second speaker hole 612.<br>
[0077]The first enclosure 622 is connected with first and second sound guides 630 and 640. The first<br>
sound guide 630 forms an open duct with a certain length at an inner space of the front housing<br>
610A and the rear housing 610B, constituting a main chamber, and the second sound guide 640<br>
11<br><br>
constitutes a sub-chamber connected with the second enclosure 650 to directly emit the second<br>
sound B' to the exterior, thereby implementing more direct low sound strengthening effects.<br>
[0078]As so far described, the speaker module according to the present invention is constructed to<br>
reduce the mutual interference between the sound generated from the front side of the speaker and<br>
the sound emitted from the rear side thereof, thereby improving the performance of the middle and<br>
low sound. In addition, because the enclosure has the sound guides, the performance of the low<br>
sound can be more enhanced. Moreover, because the enclosures can be formed in various shapes,<br>
their mounting characteristics and space utilization in the mobile communication device can be<br>
enhanced to make the mobile communication device thinner.<br>
[0079]As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without departing from the spirit<br>
or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be understood that the above-described<br>
embodiments are not limited by any of the details of the foregoing description, unless otherwise<br>
specified, but rather should be construed broadly within its spirit and scope as defined in the<br>
