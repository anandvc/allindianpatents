This invention relates to a process for producing aery1ic copolymers with pendant phenol functions.<br>
These, copolymers are useful as single component thermoplastic and two component thermoset film adhesive for bonding different substrates including metals and rubber.<br>
Film adhesives have great application potentiality in high-tech areas like aerospace. The bonding requirements in these areas are generally met by use of glue like and solvent-based resinous polymeric adhesives. Use of film adhesive faci1itates the bonding manoeuvre and helps regulate the glue  thickness and minimise wastage of adhesive and accumulation of dead weight which is very critical when weight saving; becomes a matter of concern. A few number of film adhesives for structural and nonstructural applications have been reported. Some of these film adhesive and their applications have been cited by E-Lavins and J A Snelgrove in the Hand Book of Adhesive (Editor, Skiest, Publisher, Van Nostrand and Reinold, 1977) and by L T Eby and H P Brown in Treatise on Adhesion and Adhesives (Editor, R L Patrick, Publisher, Marcel Dekker, 1966). Majority of the reported film adhesives ar&amp; based on high molecular weight epoxy resin and a few Ar» based on acrylic copolymers. Two component vinyl acetal-phenolics constitute another less-preferred film adhesive. The decreased preference is due to the condensation nature of the cure reaction which generates voids in the bond, thereby weakening it. Epoxy film adhesive dominate the industry and this system  invokes  need for blending with polymers such  as  nylon.<br><br>
rubber etc. to confer film-forming characteristics. The physical and adhesive properties are hence dictated by the nature of the additives. Those based on acrylic fi1ms uses vinyl polymerisation for crosslinking which is unpredictable in aerobic conditions due to interference of atmospheric oxygen acting as polymerisation inhibitor. Whereas the present invention dislcoses thermoplastic and thermoset film adhesives formed from phenol-functiona1 acrylic polymers with built—in film forming characteristics wherein  the thermoset adhesive undergoes faci1e cure by addition reaction without evolution of volatile byproducts and the thermoplastics, simply by melting and consolidation. Both systems have very good shelf-life at ambient conditions.<br>
The main objective of this invention is to provide a method for synthesising high molecular weight polymers with pendant phenol functions having built-in film-forming characteristics- Such phenol functional polymer is produced by free radica1 copolymerisation of a mixture of three vinyl monomers in a solvent - One such monomer is an alkeny1 cyanide monomer typically acrylonitrile or methacrylonitrile, preference being given to the former. The second monomer of the mixture is constituted by an acrylic acid ester of alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol, pentanol, isopentanol, or ethyl hexyl alcohol. Instead of acry1ates, the methacrylate esters of the above alcohols can also be  used.   The  preferred monomer is  butyl  acrylate  or  ethyl<br><br>
acrylate. The third component is a monomer containing both an unsaturation and a phenol group. The best example is ortho, para-, or meta- hydroxy phenyl maleimide or ortho-, para- or meta-hydroxy phenyl citraconimide- It may be optionally replaced by ortho-, para- or meta hydroxy phenyl itaconimide or ortho-, para- or meta hydroxy styrene. The free radical initiator used for polymerisation is one among the azo initiators typically azo bis-isobutyronitrile or azo bis cyanocyclohexane. Peroxides such as benzoyl peroxide, ditertiary butyl peroxide, diamy1 peroxide, eyelohexanone peroxide and butyl hydroperoxide can also be used as polymerisation catalysts. The polymerisation is done in an organic solvent selected among tetrahydrofuran (THF), dioxane, methyl ethyl ketone (MRK), methy 1 isobuty1 ketone (MIBK), dimethyol formamide (DMF) or dimethyl acetamide (DMAc) or their mixtures in any combination and proportion- Typically dimethyl f ormamide can be chosen as the solvent. The polymerisation is performed at temperatures between 60-90oC for 3 to 10 hours and the formed polymer is isolated by pouring the resinous solution to any nonsolvent. The nonsolvent can be chosen from among hydrocarbons, such as hexane, heptane, actane, cyclohexane or their mixtures in any combination and proportion. The nonsolvents can also be alcohols such as ethanol, methanol, propanol, isopropanol, or a mixtures of these in any combination and proportion. Typically, methanol can be chosen. In such a copolymer formulation, the alkyl acrylate part can vary from 55-65%,  by  weight, the ni tr i le  monomer  can vary between 20-35%. by<br><br>
weight and the	phenol functional monomer is varied	from 3 to	15%<br>
by   weight.	The  free  radical  initiator  is	taken   at	a<br>
concentration	ranging from 0.05 to 0.2 percent by	weight of	the<br>
total monomer -<br>
The phenol group in the polymer offers amenability for structural modifications and crosslinking through its reactions with other functional electrophiles. Thus, the polymer can be crosslinked through reaction of the phenol groups with any polyelectrophile such as polyepoxide typically a diepoxide.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides process for producing acrylic copolymers wi th pendant phenol functions comprising copolymerising in a manner known perse an alkeny1 cyanide monomer, an acrylic acid ester monomer and a monomer containing both an unsaturation and a phenol group in the presence of a known free radical initiator and isolating the copolymer produced by methods konwn in the art.<br>
The following examples illustrate the details of regarding the synthesis of the copolymer.<br>
Process for phenol-functional acrylic polymers(PFAP)<br>
59.5 parts of butyl acryllate and 31 parts of acrylonitrile are mixed with 9.5 parts of 4-maleimido phenol in 100 ml freshly distilled dimethyl formamide containing 0-10 part of  azobisi sobutyroni trile all taken in a 500 ml  round  bottomed<br><br>
flask fitted with a vacuum adaptor. The solution is cooled to -50°C or preferably -70°C and evacuated using a vacuum pump and then closed under vacuum. The solution is then kept in a water bath heated to 60-70°C and maintained at this temperature for 2 to 6 hours. The viscous solution is then poured drop-wise to 2 litres of methyl alcohol under agitation. The resinous polymer formed is separated by decanting the supernatant liquid- The entire precipitate is then dissolved in 150 parts of tetra hydro furan (THF) and then reprecipitated as described. The polymer is then dried at 40 to 50°C under vacuum for 4 to 7 hours. The polymer is formed in 80-9O% yield. The polymer is characterised by Gel Permeation Chromatography to determine the molecular weight (fin) in the range 50,000-60,000 with a polym dispersity index of 1.7 to 2.0. The infra red (IR) spectrum of the polymer shows an absorption at 1780 cm characteristic of the imide and at 1740 cm-1 due to ester carbonyl groups and a strong absorption at 2150 cm due to the nitrile group. The broad peak at 3300-3500 cm   is indicative of the hydroxy1 groups.<br>
Process for thermoplastic adhesive (TPA)<br>
The polymer (PFAP) is dissolved in methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) to form a 107. (by weight) solution and is then poured in to a rectangulr mould containing polypropylene sheet fixed at the bottom. It is allowed to evaporate at room temperature for 24 hours. The amount of solution poured to the mould is regulated so as to have a thickness of 50 to 100 micron for the dry film. This film can be served as a thermoplastic adhesive.<br><br>
The dry film is then cut into dumb-bell specimen for determining the tensile properties as per ASTM-method. Typically tensile strength, elongation and initial young's modulus are measured. Typica1 mechanical properties of the film are given in table 1.<br>
The formed film is tested for its mechanical properties but  after  curing it following a step-wise cure schedule  of  30 minutes each at 80°C, 100°C -  Mechanical properties are  included in table 1. Application of adhesive in bonding<br>
The adhesive properties. Lap Shear Strength (LSS) and T-Peel Strength (TPS) of the film adhesives are determined using chromic acid-etched B-51-SWP aluminium alloy as per ASTM D-1002 and ASTM- D872 methods respectively. The film of reguired are a is cut and interposed between the joints with contact pressure. The step-wise cure schedule of 30 minutes each at 80°C, 100°C and 150°C is adopted both for thermop1astic adhesive (TPA) and thermoset adhesive (TSA), The aluminium alloy can be replaced by bi trile rubber in which case no etching is given.<br>
Table gives the relative concentrations of the monomers employed for realising the phenol-functional acrylic polymers (PFAP) described therein.<br>
Table gives typical mechanical properties of both thermoplastic adhesive (TPA) and cured thermoset adhesive (TSA).<br>
Table 3 gives the LSS and TPS of both types of adhesive both for aluminium-aluminium and rubber-aluminium systems as described.<br><br>
