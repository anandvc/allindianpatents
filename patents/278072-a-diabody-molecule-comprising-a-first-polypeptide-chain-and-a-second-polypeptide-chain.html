60/671,657, filed April 15, 2005, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
1.	FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	The present invention is directed to diabody molecules and uses thereof in<br>
, the treatment of a variety of diseases and disorders, including immunological disorders and<br>
cancers. The diabody molecules of the invention comprise at least two polypeptide chains that associate to form at least two epitope binding sites, which may recognize the same or different epitopes. Additionally, the epitopes may be from the same or different molecules or located on the same or different cells. The individual polypeptide chains of the diabody molecule may be covalently bound through non-peptide bond covalent bonds, such as, but not limited to, disulfide bonding of cysteine residues located within each polypeptide chain. In particular embodiments, the diabody molecules of the present invention further comprise an Fc region, which allows antibody-like functionality to be engineered into the molecule.<br>
2.	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	The design of covalent diabodies is based on the single chain Fvconstruct<br>
(scFv) (Holliger et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-6448; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In an intact, unmodified IgG, the VL and VH domains are located on separate polypeptide chains, i.e., the light chain and the heavy chain, respectively. Interaction of an antibody light chain and an antibody heavy chain and, in particular, interaction of VL and VH domains forms one of the epitope binding sites of the antibody. In contrast, the scFv construct comprises a VL and VH domain of an antibody contained in a single polypeptide chain wherein the domains are separated by a flexible linker of sufficient length to allow self-assembly of the two domains into a functional epitope binding site. Where self assembly of the is impossible due to a linker of insufficient length (less than about 12 amino acid residues), two of the scFv constructs interact with each other to form a bivalent molecule, the VL of one chain associating with the VH of the other (reviewed in Marvin et al., 2005, Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 26:649-658). Moreover, addition of a cysteine residue to the c-terminus of the construct has been show to allow disulfide bonding of the polypeptide chains, stabilizing the resulting dimer without interfering with the binding characteristics of the bivalent molecule (see e.g., Olafsen et al., 2004, Prot. Engr. Des. Sel. 17:21-27). Further, where VL and VH domains of differing<br>
specificity are selected, not only a bivalent, but also a bispccific molecule may be constructed.<br>
[0004]	Bivalent diabodies have wide ranging applications including therapy and<br>
immunodiagnosis. Bivalency allows for great flexibility in the design and engineering of diabody in various applications, providing enhanced avidity to multimeric antigens, the cross-linking of differing antigens, and directed targeting to specific cell types relying on the presence of both target antigens. Due to their increased valency, low dissociation rates and rapid clearance from the circulation (for diabodies of small size, at or below ~50 kDa), diabody molecules known in the art have also shown particular use in the filed of tumor imaging (Fitzgerald et al., 1997, Protein Eng, 10:1221). Of particular importance is the cross linking of differing cells, for example the cross linking of cytotoxic T cells to tumor cells (Staerz et al., 1985, Nature 314:628-631, and Holliger et al., 1996, Protein Eng. 9:299-305).  Diabody epitope binding domains may also be directed to a surface determinant of any immune effector cell such as CD3, CD 16, CD32, or CD64, which are expressed on T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells or other mononuclear cells, In many studies, diabody binding to effector cell determinants, e.g., Fey receptors (FcyR), was also found to activate the effector cell (Holliger et al., 1996, Protein Eng. 9:299-305; Holliger et al., 1999, Cancer Res. 59:2909-2916).   Normally, effector cell activation is triggered by the binding of an antigen bound antibody to an effector cell via Fc-FcyR interaction; thus, in this regard, diabody molecules of the invention may exhibit Ig-like functionality independent of whether they comprise an Fc domain (e.g., as assayed in any efferctor function assay known in the art or exemplified herein (e.g., ADCC assay)). By cross-linking tumor and effector cells, the diabody not only brings the effector cell within the proximity of the tumor cells but leads to effective tumor killing (see e.g., Cao and Lam, 2003, Adv. Drug. Deliv. Rev. 55:171-197, hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).<br>
2.1      EFFECTOR CELL RECEPTORS AND THEIR ROLES IN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM<br>
[0005]	In traditional immune function the interaction of antibody-antigen complexes<br>
with cells of the immune system results in a wide array of responses, ranging from effector functions such as antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, mast cell degranulation, and phagocytosis to immunomodulatory signals such as regulating lymphocyte proliferation and antibody secretion. All these interactions are initiated through the binding of the Fc domain of antibodies or immune complexes to specialized cell surface receptors on hematopoietic cells. The diversity of cellular responses triggered by antibodies and immune complexes<br>
results from the structural heterogeneity of Fc receptors. Fc receptors share structurally<br>
related an antigen binding domains which presumably mediate intracellular signaling.<br>
[0006]	The Fey receptors, members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily of<br>
proteins, are surface glycoproteins that can bind the Fey portion of immunoglobulin<br>
molecules. Each member of the family recognizes immunoglobulins of one or more<br>
isotypes through a recognition domain on the alpha chain of the Fey receptor. Fey receptors<br>
are defined by their specificity for immunoglobulin subtypes. Fey receptors for IgG are<br>
referred to as FcyR, for IgE as FcsR, and for IgA as FcaR. Different accessory cells bear<br>
Fey receptors for antibodies of different isotype, and the isotype of the antibody determines<br>
which accessory cells will be engaged in a given response (reviewed by Ravetch J.V. et al<br>
1991, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 9: 457-92; Gerber J.S. et al. 2001 Microbes and Infection, 3:<br>
131-139; Billadeau D.D. et al. 2002, The Journal of Clinical Investigation, 2(109): 161-<br>
1681; Ravetch J.V. et al. 2000, Science, 290: 84-89; Ravetch J.V. et al, 2001 Annu. Rev.<br>
Immunol. 19:275-90; Ravetch J.V. 1994, Cell, 78(4): 553-60). The different Fey receptors,<br>
the cells that express them, and their isotype specificity is summarized in Table 1 (adapted<br>
from Immunobiology: The Immune System in Health and Disease, 4th ed. 1999, Elsevier<br>
Science Ltd/Garland Publishing, New York).<br>
[0007]	Fey Receptors<br>
[0008]	Each member of this family is an integral membrane glycoprotein,<br>
possessing extracellular domains related to a C2-set of immunoglobulin-related domains, a<br>
single membrane spanning domain and an intracytoplasmic domain of variable length.<br>
There are three known FcyRs, designated FcyRI(CD64), FcyRII(CD32), and<br>
FcyRIII(CD16). The three receptors are encoded by distinct genes; however, the extensive<br>
homology between the three family members suggest they arose from a common progenitor<br>
perhaps by gene duplication.<br>
[0009]	FcyRII(CD32)<br>
[0010]	FcyRII proteins are 40 kDa integral membrane glycoproteins which bind<br>
only the complexed IgG due to a low affinity for monomeric Ig (106 tvf1). This receptor is<br>
the most widely expressed FcyR, present on all hematopoietic cells, including monocytes,<br>
macrophages, B cells, NK. cells, neutrophils, mast cells, and platelets. FcyRII has only two<br>
immunoglobulin-like regions in its immunoglobulin binding chain and hence a much lower<br>
affinity for IgG than FcyRI. There are three human FcyRII genes (FcyRII-A, FcyRII-B,<br>
FcyRII-C), all of which bind IgG in aggregates or immune complexes.<br>
[0011]	Distinct differences within the cytoplasmic domains of FcyRII-A and<br>
FcyRII-B create two functionally heterogenous responses to receptor ligation. The<br>
fundamental difference is that the A isoforra initiates intracellular signaling leading to cell<br>
activation such as phagocytosis and respiratory burst, whereas the B isoform initiates<br>
inhibitory signals, e.g., inhibiting B-cell activation.<br>
[0012]	FcyRIIl(CD 16)<br>
[0013]	Due to heterogeneity within this class, the size of FcyRIIl ranges between 40<br>
and 80 kDa in mouse and man. Two human genes encode two transcripts, FcyRIIIA, an<br>
integral membrane glycoprotein, and FcyRIIIB, a glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol (GPI)-<br>
linked version. One murine gene encodes an FcyRIIl homologous to the membrane<br>
spanning human FcyRIIIA. The FcyRIIl shares structural characteristics with each of the<br>
other two FcyRs. Like FcyRH, FcyRIIl binds IgG with low affinity and contains the<br>
corresponding two extracellular Ig-like domains. FcyRIIIA is expressed in macrophagcs,<br>
mast cells and is the lone FcyR in NK cells. The GPI-linked FcyRIIIB is currently known<br>
to be expressed only in human neutrophils.<br>
[0014]	Signaling through FcyRs<br>
[0015]	Both activating and inhibitory signals are transduced through the FcyRs<br>
following ligation. These diametrically opposing functions result from structural differences among the different receptor isoforms. Two distinct domains within the cytoplasmic signaling domains of the receptor called immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motifs (ITAMs) or immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibitory motifs (ITIMS) account for the different responses. The recruitment of different cytoplasmic enzymes to these structures dictates the outcome of the FcyR-mediated cellular responses. ITAM-containing FcyR complexes include FcyRI, FcyRIIA, FcyRIIIA, whereas ITIM-containing complexes only include FcyRIIB,<br>
[0016]	Human neutrophils express the FcyRIIA gene. FcyRIIA clustering via<br>
immune complexes or specific antibody cross-linking serves to aggregate ITAMs along with receptor-associated kinases which facilitate ITAM phosphorylation. ITAM phosphorylation serves as a docking site for Syk kinasc, activation of which results in activation of downstream substrates (e.g., PIsK). Cellular activation leads to release of proinflammatory mediators.<br>
[0017]	The FcyRIIB gene is expressed on B lymphocytes; its extracellular domain is<br>
96% identical to FcyRIIA and binds IgG complexes in an indistinguishable manner. The presence of an ITIM in the cytoplasmic domain of FcyRIIB defines this inhibitory subclass of FcyR. Recently the molecular basis of this inhibition was established. When co-ligated along with an activating FcyR, the ITIM in FcyRIIB becomes phosphorylated and attracts the SH2 domain of the inosital polyphosphate 5'-phosphatase (SHIP), which hydrolyzes<br>
phosphoinositol messengers released as a consequence of ITAM-containing FcyR-mediated tyrosine kinase activation, consequently preventing the influx of intracellular Ca""". Thus crosslinking of FcyRIIB dampens the activating response to FcyR ligation and inhibits cellular responsiveness. B cell activation, B cell proliferation and antibody secretion is thus aborted.<br>

[0033]	hi certain aspects of the invention, the domains of the first and second<br>
polypeptid chain comprising an Fc domain, i.e., optionally, the third and sixth domains, respectively, can further comprise a hinge domain such that the domain comprises a hinge-Fc region.

In other aspects, the immunoglobulin from which the light and heavy chains are derived is humanized or chimerized.<br>
[0034]	Further, the first epitope and second epitopes, and, where applicable, third<br>
epitope and fourth epitope, to which the diabody or diabody molecule binds can be different epitopes from the same antigen or can be different epitopes from different antigens. The antigens can be any molecule to which an antibody can be generated. For example, proteins, nucleic acids, bacterial toxins, cell surface markers, autoimmune markers, viral proteins, drugs, etc. In particular aspects, at least one epitope binding site of the diabody is specific for an antigen on a particular cell, such as a B-cell, a T-cell, a phagocytic cell, a natural killer (NK) cell or a dendritic cell.<br>
[0035]	In certain aspects of the present embodiment, at least one epitope binding site<br>
of the diabody or diabody molecule is specific for a Fc receptor, which Fc receptor can be<br>
an activating Fc receptor or an inhibitory Fc receptor. In particular aspects, the Fc receptor<br>
is a Fey receptor, and the Fey receptor is a FcyRI, FcyRII or FcyRIII receptor. In more<br>
preferred aspects, the FcyRIII receptor is the FcyRIIIA (CD 16 A) receptor or the FcyRIIIB<br>
(CD16B) receptor, and, more preferably, the FcyRHI receptor is the FcyRIIIA (CD16A)<br>

a particularly preferred aspect, one binding site of the diabody is specific for CD32B and<br>

[0036]	In cases where one epitope binding site is specific for GDI 6A, the VL and<br>
VH domains can be the same as or similar to the VL and VH domains of the mouse antibody 3G8, the sequence of which has been cloned and is set forth herein. In other cases where one epitope binding site is specific for CD32A, the VL and VH domains can be the same as or similar to the VL and VH domains of the mouse antibody IV.3. In yet other cases where one epitope binding site is specific for CD32B, the VL and VH domains can be<br>

present invention is also directed to a bispecific diabody or diabody molecule wherein the<br>
first epitope is specific for CD32B, and the second epitope is specific for CD16A.<br>
[0037]	In other aspects, an epitope binding site can be specific for a pathogenic<br>
antigen. As used herein, a pathogenic antigen is an antigen involved in a specific<br>
pathogenic disease, including cancer, infection and autoimmune disease. Thus, the<br>
pathogenic antigen can be a tumor antigen, a bacterial antigen, a viral antigen, or an<br>
autoimmune antigen. Exemplary pathogenic antigens include, but are not limited to<br>
lipopolysaccharide, viral antigens selected from the group consisting of viral antigens from<br>
human immunodeficiency virus, Adenovirus, Respiratory Syncitial Virus, West Nile Virus<br>
(e.g., El6 and/or E53 antigens) and hepatitis vims, nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and<br>
collagen. Preferably, the pathogenic antigen is a neutralizing antigen. In a preferred aspect,<br>
where one epitope binding site is specific for CD16A or CD32A, the other epitope binding<br>
site is specific for a pathogenic antigen excluding autoimmune antigens. In yet another<br>
preferred aspect, where one epitope binding site is specific for CD32B, the other epitope<br>
binding site is specific for any pathogenic antigen. In specific embodiments, the diabody<br>
molecule of the invention binds two different antigen on the same cell, for example, one<br>
antigen binding site is specific for an activating Fc receptor while the other is specific for an<br>
inhibitory Fc receptor. In other embodiments, the diabody molecule binds two distinct viral<br>
neutralizing epitopes, for example, but not limited to, E16 and E53 of West Nile Virus.<br>

virion and at least one other binding site is specific for a Fc receptor, e.g., CD16A.<br>
[0039]	In yet another embodiment, the invention is directed to a method for treating<br>

[0042]	Unless otherwise defined, all terms of art, notations and other scientific<br>
terms or terminology used herein are intended to have the meanings commonly understood by those of skill in the art to which this invention pertains. In some cases, terms with commonly understood meanings are defined herein for clarity and/or for ready reference, and the inclusion of such definitions herein should not necessarily be construed to represent a substantial difference over what is generally understood in the art. The practice of the present invention will employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of molecular biology (including recombinant techniques), microbiology, cell biology, biochemistry, nucleic acid chemistry, and immunology, which are within the skill of the art. Such techniques are explained fully in the literature, such as, Current Protocols in Immunology (J. E. Coligan et ah, eds., 1999, including supplements through 2001); Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (F. M. Ausubel et al., eds., 1987, including supplements through 2001); Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, third edition (Sambrook and Russel, 2001); PCR: The Polymerase Chain Reaction, (Mullis et al., eds., 1994); The Immunoassay Handbook (D.

Staines, eds., Weinheim: VCH Verlags gesellschaft mbH, 1993), Harlow and Lane Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1999; and Beaucage et al. eds., Current Protocols in Nucleic Acid Chemistry John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, 2000).<br>
[0043]	As used herein, the terms "antibody" and "antibodies" refer to monoclonal<br>
antibodies, multispecific antibodies, human antibodies, humanized antibodies, synthetic antibodies, chimeric antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, camelized antibodies, single-chain Fvs (scFv), single chain antibodies, Fab fragments, F(ab') fragments, disulfide-linked bispecific Fvs (sdFv), intrabodies, and anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies (including, e.g., anti-Id and anti-anti-Id antibodies to antibodies of the invention), and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above. In particular, antibodies include immunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active fragments of immunoglobulin molecules, i.e., molecules that contain an antigen binding site. Immunoglobulin molecules can be of any type (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA and IgY), class (e.g., IgGj, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAi and IgAa) or subclass.<br>
[0044]	As used herein, the terms "immunospecifically binds," "immunospecifically<br>
recognizes," "specifically binds," "specifically recognizes" and analogous terms refer to molecules mat specifically bind to an antigen (e.g., eptiope or immune complex) and do not specifically bind to another molecule. A molecule that specifically binds to an antigen may bind to other peptides or polypeptides with lower affinity as determined by, e.g., immunoassays, BIAcore, or other assays known in the art. Preferably, molecules that specifically bind an antigen do not cross-react with other proteins. Molecules that specifically bind an antigen can be identified, for example, by immunoassays, BIAcore, or other techniques known to those of skill in the art.<br>
[0045]	As used herein, immune complex, refers to a structure which forms when at<br>
least one target molecule and at least one heterologous Fey region-containing polypeptide bind to one another forming a larger molecular weight complex. Examples of immune complexes are antigen-antibody complexes which can be either soluble or particulate (e.g., an antigen/antibody complex on a cell surface.).<br>
[0046]	As used herein, the terms "heavy chain," "light chain," "variable region,"<br>
"framework region," "constant domain," and the like, have their ordinary meaning in the immunology art and refer to domains in naturally occurring immunoglobulins and the corresponding domains of synthetic (e.g., recombinant) binding proteins (e.g., humanized antibodies, single chain antibodies, chimeric antibodies, etc.). The basic structural unit of naturally occurring immunoglobulins (e.g., IgG) is a tetramer having two light chains and two heavy chains, usually expressed as a glycoprotein of about 150,000 Da. The amino-terminal ("N") portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal ("C") portion of each chain defines a constant region, with light chains having a single constant<br>
domain and heavy chains usually having three constant domains and a hinge region. Thus,<br>
the structure of the light chains of an IgG molecule is n-V^-Ci-c and the structure of IgG<br>
heavy chains is n-VH-CHi-H-Cm-Cna-c (where H is the hinge region). The variable regions<br>
of an IgG molecule consist of the complementarity detenruning regions (CDRs), which<br>
contain the residues in contact with antigen and non-CDR segments, referred to as<br>
framework segments, which in general maintain the structure and determine the positioning<br>
of the CDR loops (although certain framework residues may also contact antigen). Thus,<br>
the VLand VHdomains have the structure n-FRl, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4-C. .<br>
[0047]	When referring to binding proteins or antibodies (as broadly defined herein),<br>
the assignment of amino acids to each domain is in accordance with the definitions of Kabat, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (National Institutes of Health, •Bethesda, Md., 1987 and 1991). Amino acids from the variable regions of the mature heavy and light chains of immunoglobulins are designated by the position of an amino acid in the chain. Kabat described numerous amino acid sequences for antibodies, identified an amino acid consensus sequence for each subgroup, and assigned a residue number to each amino acid. Rabat's numbering scheme is extendible to antibodies not included in his compendium by aligning the antibody in question with one of the consensus sequences in Kabat by reference to conserved amino acids. This method for assigning residue numbers has become standard in the field and readily identifies amino acids at equivalent positions in different antibodies, including chimeric or humanized variants. For example, an amino acid at position 50 of a human antibody light chain occupies the equivalent position to an amino acid at position 50 of a mouse antibody light chain.<br>
[0048]	As used herein, the term "heavy chain" is used to define the heavy chain of<br>
an IgG antibody. In an intact, native IgG, the heavy chain comprises the immunoglobulin domains VH, CHI, binge, CH2 and CHS. Throughout the,present specification, the numbering of the residues in an IgG heavy chain is that of the EU index as in Kabat et aL, Sequences of Proteins of Immunoloeical Interest'. 5th Ed. Public Health Service, NH1, MD (1991), expressly incorporated herein by references. The "EU index as in Kabat" refers to the numbering of the human IgGl EU antibody. Examples of the amino acid sequences containing human IgGl hinge, CH2 and CHS domains are shown in FIGS. 1A andlB as described, infra. FIGS. 1A and IB also set forth amino acid sequences of the hinge, CH2 and CH3 domains of the heavy chains of IgG2, IgGS and IgG4. The amino acid sequences of IgG2, IgGS and IgG4 isotypes are aligned with the IgGl sequence by placing the first and last cysteine residues of the respective hinge regions, which form the inter-heavy chain<br>
S-S bonds, in the same positions. For the IgG2 and IgG3 hinge region, not all residues are numbered by the Eu index.<br>
[0049]	The "binge region" or "hinge domain" is generally defined as stretching from<br>
Glu2l6 to Pro230 of human IgGl.  An example of the amino acid sequence of the human IgGl hinge region is shown in FIG. 1A (amino acid residues in FIG. 1A are numbered according to the Kabat system). Hinge regions of other IgG isotypes may be aligned with the IgGl sequence by placing the first and last cysteine residues forming inter-heavy chain S-S binds in the same positions as shown in FIG. 1A.<br>
[0050]	As used herein, the term "Fc region," "Fc domain" or analogous terms are<br>
used to define a C-terminal region of an IgG heavy chain.   An example of the amino acid sequence containing the human IgGl is shown in FIG. IB. Although boundaries may vary slightly, as numbered according to the Kabat system, the Fc domain extends from amino acid 231 to amino acid 447 (amino acid residues in FIG. IB are numbered according to the Kabat system). FIG. IB also provides examples of the amino acid sequences of the Fc regions of IgG isotypes IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4.<br>
[0051]	The Fc region of an IgG comprises two constant domains, CH2 and CHS.<br>
The CH2 domain of a human IgG Fc region usually extends from amino acids 231 to amino acid 341 according to the numbering system of Kabat (FIG. IB). The CHS domain of a human IgG Fc region usually extends from amino acids 342 to 447 according to the numbering system of Kabat (FIG. IB). The CH2 domain of a human IgG Fc region (also referred to as "Cy2" domain) is unique in that it is not closely paired with another domain. Rather, two N-linked branched carbohydrate chains are interposed between the two CH2 domains of an intact native IgG.<br>
[0052]	As used herein the terms "FcyR binding protein," "FcyR antibody," and<br>
"anti-FcyR antibody", are used interchangeably and refer to a variety of immunoglobulin-like or immunoglobulin-derived proteins. "FcyR binding proteins" bind FcyR via an interaction with VL and/or VH domains (as distinct from Fey-mediated binding). Examples of FcyR binding proteins include fully human, polyclonal, chimeric and humanized antibodies (e.g., comprising 2 heavy and 2 light chains), fragments thereof (e.g., Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, and Fv fragments), bifunctional or multifunctional antibodies (see, e.g., Lanzavecchia et al, 1987, Eur. J. Immunol. 17:105), single chain antibodies (see, e.g., Bird et at, 1988, Science 242:423-26), fusion proteins (e.g., phage display fusion proteins), "minibodies" (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,837,821) and other antigen binding proteins comprising a VL and/or VH domain or fragment thereof. In one aspect, the FcyRIIIA binding protein is a "tetrameric antibody" i.e., having generally the structure of a naturally<br>
occurring IgG and comprising variable and constant domains, i.e., two light chains<br>
comprising a VL domain and a light chain constant domain and two heavy chains<br>
comprising a VH domain and a heavy chain hinge and constant domains.<br>
[0053J	As used herein the term "FcyR antagonists" and analogous terms refer to<br>
protein and non-proteinacious substances, including small molecules which antagonize at<br>
least one biological activity of an FcyR, Q.g., block signaling. For example, the molecules<br>
of the invention block signaling by blocking the binding of IgGs to an FcyR.<br>
[0054]	As used herein, the term "derivative" in the context of polypeptides or<br>
proteins refers to a polypeptide or protein that comprises an amino acid sequence which has<br>
been altered by the introduction of amino acid residue substitutions, deletions or additions.<br>

5.        DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0091]	Each polypeptide chain of the diabody molecule comprises a VL domain and<br>
a VH domain, which are covalently linked such that the domains are constrained from self assembly. Interaction of two of the polypeptide chains will produce two VL-VH pairings, forming two eptipoe binding sites, i.e., a bivalent molecule. Neither the VH or VL domain is constrained to any position within the polypeptide chain, i.e., restricted to the amino (N) or carboxy (C) teminus, nor are the domains restricted in their relative positions to one another, i.e., the VL domain may be N-terminal to the VH domain and vice-versa. The only restriction is that a complimentary polypeptide chain be available in order to form functional diabody. Where the VL and VH domains are derived from the same antibody, the two complimentary polypeptide chains may be identical. For example, where the binding domains are derived from an antibody specific for epitope A (i.e., the binding domain is formed from a VLA-VHA interaction), each polypeptide will comprise a VHA and a VLA. Homodimerization of two polypeptide chains of the antibody will result in the formation two VLA-VHA binding sites, resulting in a bivalent monospecific antibody. Where the VL and VH domains are derived from antibodies specific for different antigens, formation of a functional bispecific diabody requires the interaction of two different polypeptide chains, i.e., formation of a heterodimer. For example, for a bispecific diabody,<br>
one polypeptide chain will comprise a VLA and a VLa; homodimerization of said chain will<br>
result in the formation of two VLA-VHB binding sites, either of no binding or of<br>
unpredictable binding. In contrast, where two differing polypeptide chains are free to<br>
interact, e.g., in a recombinant expression system, one comprising a VLA and a VHa and the<br>
other comprising a VLB and a VHA, two differing binding sites will form: VLA-VHA and<br>
VLu-VHu. For all diabody polypeptide chain pairs, the possibly of misalignment or mis-<br>
binding of the two chains is a possibility, i.e., interaction of VL-VL or VH-VH domains;<br>
however, purification of functional diabodies is easily managed based on the<br>
irnmunospecificity of the properly dimerized binding site using any affinity based method<br>
known hi the are or exemplified herein, e.g., affinity chromatography.<br>
[0092]	In other embodiments, one or more of the polypeptide chains of the diabody<br>
comprises an Fc domain. Fc domains in the polypeptide chains of the diabody molecules preferentially dimerize, resulting in the formation of a diabody molecule that exhibits immunoglobulin-like properties, e.g., Fc-FcyR, interactions. Fc comprising diabodies may be dimers, e.g., comprised of two polypeptide chains, each comprising a VH domain, a VL domain and an Fc domain. Dimerization of said polypeptide chains results in a bivalent diabody comprising an Fc domain, albeit with a structure distinct from that of an unmodified bivalent antibody (FIG.l 1). Such diabody molecules will exhibit altered phenotypes relative to a wild-type immunoglobulin, e.g., altered serum half-life, binding properties, etc. In other embodiments, diabody molecules comprising Fc domains may be tetramers. Such tertramers comprise two 'heavier' polypeptide chains, i.e. a polypeptide chain comprising a VL, aVH and an Fc domain, and two 'lighter' polypeptide chains, i.e., polypeptide chain comprising a VL and a VH. Said lighter and heavier chains interact to form a monomer, and said monomers interact via their unpaired Fc domains to form an Ig-like molecule. Such an Ig-like diabody is tetravalent and may be monospecific, bispecific or tetraspecific.<br>
[0093]	The at least two binding sites of the diabody molecule can recognize the<br>
same or different epitopes. Different epitopes can be from the same antigen or epitopes from different antigens. In one embodiment, the epitopes are from different cells. In another embodiment, the epitopes are cell surface antigens on the same cell or virus. The epitopes binding sites can recognize any antigen to which an antibody can be generated. For example, proteins, nucleic acids, bacterial toxins, cell surface markers, autoimmune markers, viral proteins, drugs, etc. In particular aspects, at least one epitope binding site of the diabody is specific for an antigen on a particular cell, such as a B-cell or T-cell, a phagocytotic cell, a natural killer (NK) cell or a dendritic cell.<br>
[0094]	Each domain of the polypcptide chain of the diabody, z. e., the VL, VH and<br>
FC domain may be separated by a peptide linker. The peptide linker may be 0,1,2, 3,4, 5,<br>
6,7,8, or 9. amino acids. In certain embodiments the amino acid linker sequence is<br>
GGGSGGGG (SEQ ID NO: 10) encoded by the nucleic acid sequence (SEQ ID N0:76),<br>
[0095]	In certain embodiments, each polypeptide chain of the diabody molecule is<br>
engineered to comprise at least one cysteine residue that will interact with a counterpart at least one cysteine residue on a second polypeptide chain of the invention to form an interchain disulfide bond. Said interchain disulfide bonds serve to stabilize the diabody molecule, improving expression and recovery in recombinant systems, resulting in a stable and consistent formulation as well as improving the stability of the isolated and/or purified product in vivo. Said at least one cysteine residue may be introduced as a single amino acid or as part of larger amino-acid sequence, e.g. hinge domain, in any portion of the polypeptide chain. In a specific embodiment, said at least one cysteine residue is engineered to occur at the C-terminus of the polypeptide chain. In some embodiments, said at least one cysteine residue in introduced into the polypeptide chain within the amino acid sequence LGGC. In a specific embodiment, the C-terminus of the polypeptide chain comprising the diabody molecule of the invention comprises the amino acid sequence LGGC. In another embodiment, said at least one cysteine residue is introduced into the polypeptide within an amino acid sequence comprising a hinge domain, e.g. SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID N0:4. In a specific embodiment, the C-terminus of a polypeptide chain of the diabody molecule of the invention comprises the amino acid sequence of an IgG hinge domain, e.g. SEQ ID NO: 1. In another embodiment, the C-terminus of a polypeptide chain of a diabody molecule of the invention comprises the amino acid sequence VEPKSC (SEQ ID NO:79), which can be encoded by nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID N0:80). In other embodiments, said at least one cysteine residue in introduced into the polypeptide chain within the ammo acid sequence LGGCFNRGEC (SEQ ID NO: 17), which can be encoded by the nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID N0:78). In a specific embodiment, the C-terminus of a polypeptide chain comprising the diabody of the invention comprises the amino acid sequence LGGCFNRGEC (SEQ ID NO: 17), which can be encoded by the nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID N0:78). In yet other embodiments, said at least one cysteine residue in introduced into the polypeptide chain within the amino acid sequence FNRGEC (SEQ ID N0:23), which can be encoded by the nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID NO-.77). In a specific embodiment, the C-terminus of a polypeptide chain comprising the diabody of the invention comprises the amino acid sequence FNRGEC (SEQ ID NO:23), which can be encoded by the nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID N0:77).<br>
[0096]	In certain embodiments, the diabody molecule comprises at least two<br>
polypeptide chains, each of which comprise the amino acid sequence LGGC and are covalently linked by a disulfide bond between the cysteine residues in said LGGC sequences. In another specific embodiment, the diabody molecule comprises at least two polypeptide chains, one of which comprises the sequence FNRGEC (SEQ ID NO:23) while the other comprises a hinge domain (containing at least one cysteine residue), wherein said at least two polypeptide chains are covalently linked by a disulfide bond between the cysteine residue in FNRGEC (SEQ ID NO:23) and a cysteine residue in the hinge domain. In particular aspects, the cysteine residue responsible for the disulfide bond located in the hinge domain is Cys-128 (as numbered according to Kabat EU; located in the hinge domain of an unmodified, intact IgG heavy chain) and the counterpart cysteine residue in SEQ ID NO:23 is Cys-214 (as numbered according to Kabat EU; located at the C-terminus of an unmodified, intact IgG light chain) (Elkabetz et al., 2005, J. Biol. Chem. 280:14402-14412; hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). In yet other embodiments, the at least one cysteine residue is engineered to occur at the N-terminus of the amino acid chain. In still other embodiments, the at least one cysteine residue is engineered to occur in the linker portion of the polypeptide chain of the diabody molecule. In further embodiments, the VH or VL domain is engineered to comprise at least one amino acid modification relative to the parental VH or VL domain such that said amino acid modification comprises a substitution of a parental amino acid with cysteine.<br>
[0097]	The invention encompasses diabody molecules comprising an Fc domain or<br>
portion thereof (e.g. a CH2 domain, or CH3 domain). The Fc domain or portion thereof may be derived from any immunoglobulin isotype or allotype including, but not limited to, IgA, IgD, IgG, IgE and IgM. In preferred embodiments, the Fc domain (or portion thereof) is derived from IgG. In specific embodiments, the IgG isotype is IgGl, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 or an allotype thereof. In one embodiment, the diabody molecule comprises an Fc domain, which Fc domain comprises a CH2 domain and CH3 domain independently selected from any immunoglobulin isotype (i.e. an Fc domain comprising the CH2 domain derived from IgG and the CH3 domain derived form IgE, or the CH2 domain derived from IgGl and the CHS domain derived from IgG2, etc.). Said Fc domain may be engineered into a polypeptide chain comprising the diabody molecule of the invention in any position relative to other domains or portions of said polypeptide chain (e.g., the Fc domain, or portion thereof, may be c-terminal to both the VL and VH domains of the polypeptide of the chain; may be n-terminal to both the VL and VH domains; or may be N-terminal to one domain and c-terminal to another (i.e., between two domains of the polypeptide chain)).<br>
[0098]	The present invention also encompasses molecules comprising a hinge<br>
domain. The hinge domain be derived from any immunoglobulin isotype or allotype including IgA, IgD, IgG, IgE and IgM. In preferred embodiments, the hinge domain is derived from IgG, wherein the IgG isotype is IgGl, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4, or an allotpye thereof. Said hinge domain may be engineered into a polypeptide chain comprising the diabody molecule together with an Fc domain such that the diabody molecule comprises a hinge-Fc domain. In certain embodiments, the hinge and Fc domain are independently selected from any immunoglobulin isotype known in the art or exemplified herein. In other embodiments the hinge and Fc domain are separated by at least one other domain of the polypeptide chain, e.g., the VL domain. The hinge domain, or optionally the hinge-Fc domain, may be engineered in to a polypeptide of the invention in any position relative to other domains or portions of said polypeptide chain. In certain embodiments, a polypeptide chain of the invention comprises a hinge domain, which hinge domain is at the C-terminus of the polypeptide chain, wherein said polypeptide chain does not comprise an Fc domain. In yet other embodiments, a polypeptide chain of the invention comprises a hinge-Fc domain, which hinge-Fc domain is at the C-terminus of the polypeptide chain.   In further embodiments, a polypeptide chain of the invention comprises a hinge-Fc domain, which hinge-Fc domain is at the N-terminus of the polypeptide chain.<br>
[0099]	As discussed above, the invention encompasses multimers of polypeptide<br>
chains, each of which polypeptide chains comprise a VH and VL domain. In certain<br>
aspects, the polypeptide chains in said multimers further comprise an Fc domain.<br>
Dimerization of the Fc domains leads to formation of a diabody molecule that exhibits<br>
irnmunoglobulin-like functionality, i.e., Fc mediated function (e.g., Fc-FcyR interaction,<br>
complement binding, etc.). In certain embodiments, the VL and VH domains comprising<br>
each polypeptide chain have the same specificity, and said diabody molecule is bivalent and<br>
monospecific. In other embodiments, the VL and VH domains comprising each<br>
polypeptide chain have differing specificity and the diabody is bivalent and bispecific.<br>
[00100]	In yet other embodiments, diabody molecules of the invention encompass<br>
tetramers of polypeptide chains, each of which polypeptide chain comprises a VH and VL domain. In certain embodiments, two polypeptide chains of the tetramer further comprise an Fc domain. The tetramer is therefore comprised of two 'heavier' polypeptide chains, each comprising a VL, VH and Fc domain, and two 'lighter' polypeptide chains, comprising a VL and VH domain. Interaction of a heavier and lighter chain into a bivalent monomer coupled with dimerization of said monomers via the Fc domains of the heavier chains will lead to formation of a tetravalent immunoglobulin-like molecule (exemplified in Example<br>
6.2 and Example 6.3). In certain aspects the monomers are the same, and the tetravalent<br>
diabody molecule is monospecific or bispecific. In other aspects the monomers are<br>
different, and the tetra valent molecule is bispecific or tetraspecific.<br>
[00101]	Formation of a tetraspecific diabody molecule as described supra requires<br>
the interaction of four differing polypeptide chains. Such interactions are difficult to achieve with efficiency within a single cell recombinant production system, due to the many variants of potential chain mispairings. One solution to increase the probability of mispairings, is to engineer "knobs-into-holes" type mutations into the desired polypeptide chain pairs. Such mutations favor heterodimerization over homodimerization. For example, with respect to Fc-Fc-interactions, an amino acid substitution (preferably a substitution with an amino acid comprising a bulky side group forming a 'knob', e.g., tryptophan) can be introduced into the CH2 or CHS domain such that steric interference will prevent interaction with a similarly mutated domain and will obligate the mutated domain to pair with a domain into which a complementary, or accommodating mutation has been engineered, i.e., 'the hole' (e.g., a substitution with glycine). Such sets of mutations can be engineered into any pair of polypeptides comprising the diabody molecule, and further, engineered into any portion of the polypeptides chains of said pair. Methods of protein engineering to favor heterodimerization over homodimerization are well known in the art, in particular with respect to the engineering of immunoglobulin-like molecules, and are encompassed herein (see e.g., Ridgway et al., 1996, Protein Engr. 9:617-621, Atwell et al., 1997, J. Mol. Biol. 270: 26-35, and Xie et al., 2005, J. Immunol. Methods 296:95-101; each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).<br>
[00102]	The invention also encompasses diabody molecules comprising variant Fc or<br>
variant hinge-Fc domains (or portion thereof), which variant Fc domain comprises at least one amino acid modification (e.g. substitution, insertion deletion) relative to a comparable wild-type Fc domain or hinge-Fc domain (or portion thereof). Molecules comprising variant Fc domains or hinge-Fc domains (or portion thereof) (e.g., antibodies) normally have altered phenotypes relative to molecules comprising wild-type Fc domains or hinge-Fc domains or portions thereof. The variant phenotype may be expressed as altered serum half-life, altered stability, altered susceptibility to cellular enzymes or altered effector function as assayed in an NK dependent or macrophage dependent assay. Fc domain variants identified as altering effector function are disclosed in International Application W004/063351, U.S. Patent Application Publications 2005/0037000 and 2005/0064514, U.S. Provisional Applications 60/626,510, filed November 10, 2004, 60/636,663, filed December 15,2004, and 60/781,564, filed March 10, 2006, and U.S. Patent Applications<br>

[00103]	The bispecific diabodies of the invention can simultaneously bind two<br>
separate and distinct epitopes. In certain embodiments the epitopes are from the same antigen. In other embodiments, the epitopes are from different antigens. In preferred embodiments, at least one epitope binding site is specific for a determinant expressed on an immune effector cell (e.g. CDS, CD 16, CD32, CD64, etc.) which are expressed on T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells or other mononuclear cells. In one embodiment, the diabody molecule binds to the effector cell determinant and also activates said effector cell. In this regard, diabody molecules of the invention may exhibit Ig-like functionality independent of whether they further comprise an Fc domain (e.g., as assayed in any effector function assay known in the art or exemplified herein (e.g., ADCC assay). In certain embodiments the bispecific diabody of the invention binds both a cancer antigen on a tumor cell and an effector cell determinant while activating said cell. In alternative embodiments, the bispecific diabody or diabody molecule of the invention may inhibit activation of a target, e.g., effector, cell by simultaneously binding, and thus linking, an activating and inhibitory receptor on the same cell (e.g., bind both CD32A and CD32B, BCR and CD32B, or IgERI and CD32B) as described supra (see, Background Section). In a further aspect of this embodiment, the bispecific diabody may exhibit anti-viral properties by simultaneously binding two neutralizing epitopes on a virus (e.g., RSV epitopes; WNV epitopes such as E16andE53).<br>
[00104]	In certain embodiments, bispecific diabody molecules of the invention offer<br>
unique opportunities to target specific cell types. For example, the bispecific diabody or diabody molecule can be engineered to comprise a combination of epitope binding sites that recognize a set of antigens unique to a target cell or tissue type. Additionally, where either or both of the individual antigens is/are fairly common separately in other tissue and/or cell types, low affinity biding domains can be used to construct the diabody or diabody molecule. Such low affinity binding domains will be unable to bind to the individual epitope or antigen with sufficient avidity for therapeutic purposes. However, where both epitopes or antigens are present on a single target cell or tissue, the avidity of the diabody or diabody molecule for the cell or tissue, relative to a cell or tissue expressing only one of the antigens, will be increased such that said cell or tissue can be effectively targeted by the invention.   Such a bispecific molecule can exhibit enhanced binding to one or both of its<br>
target antigens on cells expressing both of said antigens relative to a monospecific diabody<br>
or an antibody with a specificity to only one of the antigens.<br>
[00105]	Preferably, the binding properties of the diabodies of the invention are<br>
characterized by in vitro functional assays for determining binding activity and/or one or<br>
more FcyR mediator effector cell functions (mediated via Fc-FcyR interactions or by the<br>
immunospecific binding of a diabody molecule to an FcyR) (See Section 5.4.2 and 5.4.3).<br>
The affinities and binding properties of the molecules, e.g., diabodies, of the invention for<br>
an FcyR can be determined using in vitro assays (biochemical or immunological based<br>
assays) known in the art for determining binding domain-antigen or Fc-FcyR interactions,<br>
i.e., specific binding of an antigen to a binding domain or specific binding of an Fc region to<br>
an FcyR, respectively, including but not limited to ELISA assay, surface plasmon resonance<br>
assay, immunoprecipitation assays (See Section 5.4.2). In most preferred embodiments, the<br>
molecules of the invention have similar binding properties in in vivo models (such as those<br>
described and disclosed herein) as those in in vitro based assays. However, the present<br>
invention does not exclude molecules of the invention that do not exhibit the desired<br>
phenotype in in vitro based assays but do exhibit the desired phenotype in vivo.<br>
[00106]	hi some embodiments, molecules of the invention are engineered to comprise<br>
an altered glycosylation pattern or an altered glycoform relative to the comparable portion of the template molecule. Engineered glycoforms may be useful for a variety of purposes, including, but not limited to, enhancing effector function. Engineered glycoforms may be generated by any method known to one skilled in the art, for example by using engineered or variant expression strains, by co-expression with one or more enzymes, for example, DI N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnTIl 1), by expressing a diabody of the invention in various organisms or cell lines from various organisms, or by modifying carbohydrate(s) after the diabody has been expressed and purified. Methods for generating engineered glycoforms are known in the art, and include but are not limited to those described in Umana et al, 1999, Nat. Biotechnol 17:176-180; Davies etal, 2001 Biotechnol Bioeng 74:288-294; Shields et al, 2002, J Biol Chem 277:26733-26740; Shinkawa et al., 2003, J Biol Chem 278:3466-3473) US 6,602,684; USSN 10/277,370; USSN 10/113,929; PCT WO 00/61739A1; PCT WO 01/292246A1; PCT WO 02/311140A1; PCT WO 02/30954A1; Potillegent™ technology (Biowa, Inc.

 <br>
[00107]	The invention further encompasses incorporation of unnatural amino acids to<br>
generate the diabodies of the invention. Such methods are known to those skilled in the art such as those using the natural biosynthetic machinery to allow incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins, see, e.g., Wang et al, 2002 Chem. Comm, 1: 1-11; Wang et al, 2001, Science, 292: 498-500; van Hest et al, 2001. Chem. Comm. 19: 1897-1904, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Alternative strategies focus on the enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of amino acyl-tRNA, see, e.g., Tang et al., 2001, J. Am.

[00108]	In some embodiments, the invention encompasses methods of modifying a<br>
VL.VH or Fc domain of a molecule of the invention by adding or deleting a glycosylation site.

5.1      DIABODY BINDING DOMAINS<br>
[00109]	The diabodies of the present invention comprise antigen binding domains<br>
generally derived from immunoglobulins or antibodies. The antibodies from which the<br>
binding domains used hi the methods of the invention are derived may be from any animal<br>
origin including birds and mammals (e.g., human, non-human primate, murine, donkey,<br>
sheep, rabbit, goat, guinea pig, camel, horse, or chicken). Preferably, the antibodies are<br>
human or humanized monoclonal antibodies. As used herein, "human" antibodies include<br>
antibodies having the amino acid sequence of a human immunoglobulin and include<br>
antibodies isolated from human immunoglobulin libraries or libraries of synthetic human<br>
irnmunoglobulin coding sequences or from mice that express antibodies from human genes.<br>
{00110]	The invention contemplates the use of any antibodies known in the art for the<br>
treatment and/or prevention of cancer, autoimmune disease, inflammatory disease or infectious disease as source of binding domains for the diabodies of the invention. Non-limiting examples of known cancer antibodies are provided in section 5.7.1 as well as other antibodies specific for the listed target antigens and antibodies against the cancer antigens listed hi section 5.6.1; nonlimiting' examples of known antibodies for the treatment and/or prevention of autoimmune disease and inflammatory disease are provided in section 5.7.2. as well as antibodies against the listed target antigens and antibodies against the antigens<br>
listed in section 5.6.2; in other embodiments antibodies against epitopes associated with infectious diseases as listed in Section 5.6.3 can be used. In certain embodiments, the antibodies comprise a variant Fc region comprising one or more amino acid modifications, which have been identified by the methods of the invention to have a conferred effector function and/or enhanced affinity for FcyRIIB and a decreased affinity for FcyRIHA relative to a comparable molecule comprising a wild type Fc region, A non-limiting example of the antibodies that are used for the treatment or prevention of inflammatory disorders which can be engineered according to the invention is presented in Table 9, and a non-limiting example of the antibodies mat are used for the treatment or prevention of autoimmune disorder is presented in Table 10.<br>
[00111]	For some uses, including in vivo use of antibodies in humans and in vitro<br>
detection assays, it may be preferable to use diabodies with variable domains derived from human, chimeric or humanized antibodies. Variable domains from completely human antibodies are particularly desirable for therapeutic treatment of human subjects. Human antibodies can be made by a variety of methods known in the art including phage display methods described above using antibody libraries derived from human immunoglobulin sequences. See also U.S. Patent Nos. 4,444,887 and 4,716,111; and International Publication Nos. WO 98/46645, WO 98/50433, WO 98/24893, WO 98/16654, WO 96/34096, WO 96/33735, and WO 91/10741; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
[00112]	A humanized antibody is an antibody, a variant or a fragment thereof which<br>
is capable of binding to a predetermined antigen and which comprises a framework region<br>
having substantially the amino acid sequence of a human immunoglobulin and a CDR<br>
having substantially the amino acid sequence of a non-human immunoglobulin. A<br>
humanized antibody may comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two,<br>
variable domains in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of<br>
a non- human immunoglobulin (i.e., donor antibody) and all or substantially all of the<br>
framework regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence.<br>
[00113]	The framework and CDR regions of a humanized antibody need not<br>
correspond precisely to the parental sequences, e.g., the donor CDR or the consensus framework may be mutagenized by substitution, insertion or deletion of at least one residue so that the CDR or framework residue at that site does not correspond to either the consensus or the donor antibody. Such mutations, however, are preferably not extensive. Usually, at least 75% of the humanized antibody residues will correspond to those of the parental framework region (FR) and CDR sequences, more often 90%, and most preferably<br>
greater than 95%. Humanized antibodies can be produced using variety of techniques known in the art, including but not limited to, CDR-grafting (European Patent No. EP 239,400; International Publication No. WO 91/09967; and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,225,539, 5,530,101, and 5,585,089), veneering or resurfacing (European Patent Nos. EP 592,106 and EP 519,596; Padlan, 1991, Molecular Immunology 28(4/5):4S9-498; Studoicka et al., 1994, Protein Engineering 7(6):805-814; and Roguska et al., 1994, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 91:969-973), chain shuffling (U.S. Patent No. 5,565,332), and techniques disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 6,407,213, 5,766,886, 5,585,089, International Publication No. WO 9317105, Tan etal, 2002, J. Immunol. 169:1119-25, Caldas et al., 2000, Protein Eng. 13:353-60, Morea et al, 2000, Methods 20:267-79, Baca et al, 1997, J. Biol. Chern. 272:10678-84, Roguska et al, 1996, Protein Eng. 9:895-904, Couto et al, 1995, Cancer Res. 55 (23 Supp):5973s-5977s, Couto et al, 1995, Cancer Res. 55:1717-22, Sandhu, 1994, Gene 150:409-10, Pedersen et al, 1994, J.

Often, framework residues in the framework regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter, preferably improve, antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art, e.g., by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. (See, e.g.,- Queen et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,585,089; U.S. Publication Nos. 2004/0049014 and 2003/0229208; U.S. Patent Nos. 6,350,861; 6,180,370; 5,693,762; 5,693,761; 5,585,089; and 5,530,101 and Riechmann et al, 1988, Nature 332:323, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.).<br>
[00114]	In a most preferred embodiment, the humanized binding domain specifically<br>
binds to the same epitope as the donor murine antibody. It will be appreciated by one<br>
skilled in the art that the invention encompasses CDR grafting of antibodies in general.<br>
Thus, the donor and acceptor antibodies may be derived from animals of the same species<br>
and even same antibody class or sub-class. More usually, however, the donor and acceptor<br>
antibodies are derived from animals of different species. Typically the donor antibody is a<br>
non-human antibody, such as a rodent MAb, and the acceptor antibody is a human antibody.<br>
[00115]	In some embodiments, at least one CDR from the donor antibody is grafted<br>
onto the human antibody. In other embodiments, at least two and preferably all three CDRs of each of the heavy and/or light chain variable regions are grafted onto the human antibody. The CDRs may comprise the Kabat CDRs, the structural loop CDRs or a<br>
combination thereof. In some embodiments, the invention encompasses a humanized FcyRIIB antibody comprising at least one CDR grafted heavy chain and at least one CDR-grafted light chain.<br>
[00116]	The diabodies used in the methods of the invention include derivatives that<br>
are modified, i.e., by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule to the diabody. For example, but not by way of limitation, the diabody derivatives include diabodies that have been modified, e.g., by glycosylation, acetylation, pegylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to a cellular ligand or other protein, etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications may be carried out by known techniques, including, but not limited to, specific chemical cleavage, acetylation, formylation, metabolic synthesis of tunicamycin, etc. Additionally, the derivative may contain one or more non-classical amino acids.<br>
[00117]	A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody<br>
are derived from different immunoglobulin molecules such as antibodies having a variable<br>
region derived from a non-human antibody and a human immunoglobulin constant region.<br>
Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known hi the art. See e.g., Morrison, 1985,<br>
Science 229:1202; Oi et al, 1986, BioTechniques 4:214; Gillies et al, 1989, J. Immunol.<br>

4,816,397, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
[00118]	Often, framework residues in the framework regions will be substituted with<br>
the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter, preferably improve, antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known m the art, e.g., by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. (See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,585,089; and Riechmann et al, 1988, Nature 332:323, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.)<br>
[00119]	Monoclonal antibodies from which binding domains of the diabodies of the<br>
invention can be prepared using a wide variety of techniques known in the art including the use of hybridoma, recombinant, and phage display technologies, or a combination thereof. For example, monoclonal antibodies can be produced using hybridoma techniques including those known in the art and taught, for example, in Harlow et al, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988); Hammerling, et al, in: Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell Hybridomas, pp. 563-681 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981) (both of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties). The term "monoclonal antibody"<br>
as used herein is not limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology. The term "monoclonal antibody" refers to an antibody that is derived from a single clone, including any eukaryotic, prokaryotic, or phage clone, and not the method by which it is produced.<br>
[00120]	Methods for producing and screening for specific antibodies using<br>
hybridoma technology are routine and well known in the art. In a non-limiting example, mice can be immunized with an antigen of interest or a cell expressing such an antigen. Once an immune response is detected, e.g., antibodies specific for the antigen are detected hi the mouse serum, the mouse spleen is harvested and splenocytes isolated. The splenocytes are then fused by well known techniques to any suitable myeloma cells. Hybridomas are selected and cloned by limiting dilution. The hybridoma clones are then assayed by methods known in the art for cells that secrete antibodies capable of binding the antigen. Ascites fluid, which generally contains high levels of antibodies, can be generated by inoculating mice intraperitoneally with positive hybridoma clones. Antigens of interest include, but are not limited to, antigens associated with the cancers provided in section 5.8.1, antigens associated with the autoimmune diseases and inflammatory diseases provided in section 5.8.2, antigens associated with the infectious diseases provided in section 5.8.3, and the toxins provided in section 5.8.4,<br>
[00121]	Antibodies can also be generated using various phage display methods<br>
known hi the art. In phage display methods, functional antibody domains are displayed on    • the surface of phage particles which carry the polynucleotide sequences encoding them. In a particular embodiment, such phage can be utilized to display antigen binding domains, such as Fab and Fv or disulfide-bond stabilized Fv, expressed from a repertoire or combinatorial antibody library (e.g., human or murine). Phage expressing an antigen binding domain that binds the antigen of interest can be selected or identified with antigen, e.g., using labeled antigen or antigen bound or captured to a solid surface or bead. Phage used in these methods are typically filamentous phage, including fd and Ml3. The antigen binding domains are expressed as a recombinantly fused protein to either the phage gene III or gene VDI protein. Examples of phage display methods that can be used to make the immunoglobulins, or fragments thereof, of the present invention include those disclosed in Brinkman et al, J. Immunol. Methods, 182:41-50,1995; Ames et al, J. Immunol. Methods, 184:177-186,1995; Kettleborough et al, Eur. J. Immunol., 24:952-958, 1994; Persic et al, Gene, 187:9-18, 1997; Burton et al, Advances in Immunology, 57:191-280,1994; PCT Application No. PCT/GB91/01134; PCT Publications WO 90/02809; WO 91/10737; WO 92/01047; WO 92/18619; WO 93/11236; WO 95/15982; WO 95/20401; and U.S.<br>

[00122]	Phage display technology can be used to increase the affinity of an antibody<br>
for its antigen. This technique would be useful in obtaining high affinity antibodies. The<br>
technology, referred to as affinity maturation, employs mutagenesis or CDR walking and re-<br>
selection using the cognate antigen to identify antibodies that bind with higher affinity to<br>
the antigen when compared with the initial or parental antibody (See, e.g.,Glaser et al,<br>
1992, J. Immunology 149:3903). Mutagenizing entire codons rather than single nucleotides<br>
results in a semi-randomized repertoire of amino acid mutations. Libraries can be<br>
constructed consisting of a pool of variant clones each of which differs by a single amino<br>
acid alteration in a single CDR and which contain variants representing each possible amino<br>
acid substitution for each CDR residue. Mutants with increased binding affinity for the<br>
antigen can be screened by contacting the immobilized mutants with labeled antigen. Any<br>
screening method known in the art can be used to identify mutant antibodies, with increased<br>
avidity to the antigen (e.g., ELISA) (See Wu et al., 1998, Proc Natl. Acad Sci. USA<br>
95:6037; Yelton et al., 1995, J. Immunology 155:1994). CDR walking which randomizes<br>
the light chain is also possible (See Schier et al., 1996, J. Mol. Bio. 263:551).<br>
[00123]	The present invention also encompasses the use of binding domains<br>
comprising the amino acid sequence of any of the binding domains described herein or<br>
known in the art with mutations (e.g., one or more amino acid substitutions) in the<br>
framework or CDR regions. Preferably, mutations in these binding domains maintain or<br>
enhance the avidity and/or affinity of the binding domains for FcyRIIB to which they<br>
immunospecifically bind, Standard techniques known to those skilled in the art (e.g.,<br>
immunoassays) can be used to assay the affinity of an antibody for a particular antigen.<br>
[00124]	Standard techniques known to those skilled in the art can be used to<br>
introduce mutations in the nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody, or fragment thereof, including, e.g., site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis, which results in amino acid substitutions. Preferably, the derivatives include less than 15 amino acid substitutions, less than 10 amino acid substitutions, less than 5 amino acid substitutions, less than 4 amino acid substitutions, less than 3 amino acid substitutions, or less than 2 amino acid substitutions relative to the original antibody or fragment thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the derivatives have conservative amino acid substitutions made at one or more predicted non-essential amino acid residues.<br>

the invention may be further characterized by epitope mapping, so that antibodies may be<br>
selected that have the greatest specificity for FcyRIIB compared to FcyRIIA. Epitope mapping methods of antibodies are well known in the art and encompassed within the methods of the invention. In certain embodiments fusion proteins comprising one or more regions of FcyRIIB may be used in mapping the epitope of an antibody of the invention. In a specific embodiment, the fusion protein contains the amino acid sequence of a region of an FcyRIIB fused to the Fc portion of human IgG2, Each fusion protein may further comprise amino acid substitutions and/or replacements of certain regions of the receptor with the corresponding region from a homolog receptor, e.g., FcyRIIA, as shown in Table 2 below. pMGX125 and pMGX132 contain the IgG binding site of the FcyRIIB receptor, the former with the C-terminus of FcyRIIB and the latter with the C-terminus of FcyRIIA and can be used to differentiate C-terminus binding. The others have FcyRIIA substitutions in<br>
the IgG binding site and either the FcyllA or FcyllB N-terminus. These molecules can help determine the part of the receptor molecule where the antibodies bind.<br>

[00144]	The fusion proteins may be used in any biochemical assay for determination<br>
of binding to an anti-FcyRIIB antibody of the invention, e.g., an ELISA. In other<br>
embodiments, further confirmation of the epitope specificity may be done by using peptides<br>
with specific residues replaced with those from the FcyRIIA sequence.<br>
[00145]	The antibodies can be characterized using assays for identifying the function<br>
of the antibodies of the invention, particularly the activity to modulate Fey RUB signaling. For example, characterization assays of the invention can measure phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the ITIM motif of FcyRIIB, or measure the inhibition of B cell receptor-generated calcium mobilization. The characterization assays of the invention can be cell-based or cell-free assays.<br>
[00146]	It has been well established in the art that in mast cells coaggregation of<br>
FcyRIIB with the high affinity IgE receptor, FceRI, leads to inhibition of antigen-induced degranulation, calcium mobilization, and cytokine production (Metcalfe D.D. et al. 1997, Physiol. Rev. 77:1033; Long E.O. 1999 Annu Rev. Immunol 17: 875). The molecular details of this signaling pathway have been recently elucidated (Ott V. L., 2002, J. Immunol. 162(9):4430-9). Once coaggregated with FceRI, FcyRIIB is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine in its ITIM motif, and then recruits Src Homology-2 containing<br>
inositol-5-phosphatase (SHIP), an SH2 domain-containing inosital polyphosphate 5-<br>
phosphatase, which is in turn phosphorylated and associates with She and p62dok (p62dok is<br>
the prototype of a family of adaptor molecules, which includes signaling domains such as an<br>
aminoterminal pleckstrin homology domain (PH domain), a PTB domain, and a carboxy<br>
terminal region containing PXXP motifs and numerous phosphorylation sites (Carpino et<br>
a/., 1997 Cell, 88: 197; Yamanshi et at, 1997, Cell, 88:205).<br>
[00147]	The anti-FcyRIIB antibodies for use in the invention may likewise be<br>
characterized for ability to modulate one or more IgE mediated responses. Preferably, cells<br>
lines co-expressing the high affinity receptor for IgE and the low affinity receptor for<br>
FcyRHB will be used in characterizing the anti-FcyRIIB antibodies hi modulating IgE<br>
mediated responses. In a specific embodiment, cells from a rat basophilic leukemia cell line<br>
(RBL-H23; Barsumian E.L. et al. 1981 Eur. J. Immunol.l 1:317, which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference hi its entirety) transfected with full length human FcyRIIB will be used.<br>
RBL-2H3 is a well characterized rat cell line that has been used extensively to study the<br>
signaling mechanisms following IgE-mediated cell activation. When expressed in RBL-2H3<br>
cells and coaggregated with FceRI, FcyRIIB inhibits FcePJ-induced calcium mobilization,<br>
degranulation, and cytokine production (Malbec et al., 1998, J. Immunol. 160:1647; Daeron<br>
etal., 1995 J. Clin. Invest. 95:577; Ott et al, 2002 J. of Immunol. 168:4430-4439).<br>
[00148]	Antibodies for use in the invention may also be characterized for inhibition<br>
of FceRI induced mast cell activation. For example, cells from a rat basophilic leukemia cell<br>
line (RBL-H23; Barsumian E.L. et al, 1981 Eur. J. Immunol. 11:317) that have been<br>
transfected with FcyRIIB are sensitized with IgE and stimulated either with F(ab')a<br>
fragments of rabbit anti-mouse IgG, to aggregate FceRI alone, or with whole rabbit anti-<br>
mouse IgG to coaggregate FcyRIIB and FcsRI. In this system, indirect modulation of down<br>
stream signaling molecules can be assayed upon addition of antibodies of the invention to<br>
the sensitized and stimulated cells. For example, tyrosine phosphorylation of FcyRIIB and<br>
recruitment and phosphorylation of SHIP, activation of MAP kinase family members, ,<br>
including but not limited to Erkl, Erk2, INK, or p38; and tyrosine phosphorylation of<br>
p62dok and its association with SHIP and RasGAP can be assayed.<br>
[00149]	One exemplary assay for determining the inhibition of FceRI induced rnast<br>
cell activation by the antibodies of the invention can comprise of the following: transfecting RBL-H23 cells with human FcyRIIB; sensitizing the RBL-H23 cells with IgE; stimulating RBL-H23 cells with either F(ab')2 of rabbit anti-mouse IgG (to aggregate FceRI alone and elicit FceRI-mediated signaling, as a control), or stimulating RBL-H23 cells with whole rabbit anti-mouse IgG to (to coaggregate FcyRIIB and FcsRJ, resulting in inhibition<br>
of FceRI-mediated signaling). Cells that have been stimulated with whole rabbit anti-mouse<br>
IgG antibodies can be further pre-incubated with the antibodies of the invention. Measuring<br>
FceRI-dependent activity of cells that have been pre-incubated with the antibodies of the<br>
invention and cells that have not been pre-incubated with the antibodies of the invention,<br>
and comparing levels of FceRI-dependent activity in these cells, would indicate a<br>
modulation of FceRI-dependent activity by the antibodies of the invention.<br>
[00150]	The exemplary assay described above can be for example, used to identify<br>
antibodies that block ligand (IgG) binding to FcyRIIB receptor and antagonize FcyRHB-mediated inhibition of FceRI signaling by preventing coaggregating of FcyRIIB and FceRI. This assay likewise identifies antibodies that enhance coaggregation of FcyRIIB and FceRI and agonize FcyRIIB-mediated inhibition of FceRI signaling by promoting coaggregating of FcyRIIB and FceRI.<br>
[00151]	In some embodiments, the anti-FcyRIIB diabodies, comprising the epitope<br>
binding domains of anti-FcyRIIB antibodies identified described herein or known in the art, of the invention are characterized for their ability to modulate an IgE mediated response by monitoring and/or measuring degranulation of mast cells or basophils, preferably hi a cell-based assay. Preferably, mast cells or basophils for use in such assays have been engineered to contain human FcyRIIB   using standard recombinant methods known to one skilled in the art. In a specific embodiment the anti-FcyRIIB antibodies of the invention are characterized for their ability to modulate an IgE mediated response in a cell-based (3-hexosaminidase (enzyme contained in the granules) release assay. P-hexosaminidase release from mast cells and basophils is a primary event in acute allergic and inflammatory condition (Aketani et al., 2001 Immunol. Lett. 75: 185-9; Aketani et al., 2000 Anal. Chem. 72: 2653-8). Release of other inflammatory mediators including but not limited to serotonin and histamine may be assayed to measure an IgE mediated response in accordance with the methods of the invention. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, release of granules such as those containing p-hexosaminidase from mast cells and basophils is an intracellular calcium concentration dependent process that is initiated by the cross-linking of FcyRIs with multivalent antigen.<br>
[00152]'         The ability to study human mast cells has been limited by the absence of suitable long term human mast cell cultures. Recently two novel stem cell factor dependent human mast cell lines, designated LAD 1 and LAD2, were established from bone marrow aspirates from a patient with mast cell sarcoma/leukemia ( Kirshenbaum et al., 2003, Leukemia research, 27:677-82, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.).<br>
Both cell lines have been described to express FceRI and several human mast cell markers. LAD 1 and 2 cells can be used for assessing the effect of the antibodies of the invention on IgE mediated responses. In a specific embodiment, cell-based P-hexosaminidase release assays such as those described supra may be used hi LAD cells to determine any modulation of the IgE-mediated response by the anti-FcyRUB antibodies of the invention. In an exemplary assay, human mast cells, e.g., LAD 1, are pruned with chimeric human IgE anti-nitrophenol (NP) and challenged with BSA-NP, the polyvalent antigen, and cell degranulation is monitored by measuring the p-hexosaminidase released in the supernatant (Kirshenbaum et al, 2003, Leukemia research, 27:677-682, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).<br>
[00153]	In some embodiments, if human mast cells have a low expression of<br>
endogenous FcyRIIB, as determined using standard methods known hi the art, e.g., FACS staining, it may be difficult to monitor and/or detect differences in the activation of the inhibitory pathway mediated by the anti-FcyRIIB diabodies of the invention. The invention thus encompasses alternative methods, whereby the FcyRIIB expression may be upregulated using cytokines and particular growth conditions. FcyRIIB has been described to be highly up-regulated hi human monocyte cell lines, e.g., THP1 and U937, (Tridandapani et al., 2002, J. Biol. Chem., 277(7): 5082-5089) and in primary human monocytes (Pricop et al, 2001, J. of Immunol., 166: 531-537) by IL4. Differentiation of U937 cells with dibutyryl cyclic AMP has been described to increase expression of FcyRII (Cameron et al, 2002 Immunology Letters 83, 171-179). Thus the endogenous FcyRIIB expression in human mast cells for use hi the methods of the invention may be up-regulated using cytokines, e.g., IL-4, IL-13, in order to enhance sensitivity of detection.<br>
[00154]	The anti-FcyRIIB diabodies can also be assayed for inhibition of B-cell<br>
receptor (BCR)-mediated signaling. BCR-mediated signaling can include at least one or more down stream biological responses, such as activation and proliferation of B cells, antibody production, etc. Coaggregation of FcyRIIB and BCR leads to inhibition of cell cycle progression and cellular survival. Further, coaggregation of FcyRIIB and BCR leads to inhibition of BCR-mcdiated signaling.<br>
[00155]	Specifically, BCR-mediated signaling comprises at least one or more of the<br>
following: modulation of down stream signaling molecules (e.g., phosphorylation state of FcyRIIB, SHIP recruitment, localization of Btk and/or PLCy, MAP kinase activity, recruitment of Akt (anti-apoptotic signal), calcium mobilization, cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation.<br>
[00156]	Although numerous effector functions of FcyRIIB-mediated 'inhibition of<br>
BCR signaling are mediated through SHIP, recently it has been demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated B cells from SHIP deficient mice exhibit significant FcyRIIB-mediated inhibition of calcium mobilization, Ins(l,4,5)P3 production, and Erk and Akt phosphorylation (Brauweiler A. et at, 2001, Journal of Immunology, 167(1): 204-211). Accordingly, ex vivo B cells from SHIP deficient mice can be used to characterize the antibodies of the invention. One exemplary assay for determining FcyRIIB-mediated inhibition of BCR signaling by the antibodies of the invention can comprise the following: isolating splenic B cells from SHIP deficient mice, activating said cells with lipopolysachharide, and stimulating said cells with either F(ab')2 anti-IgM to aggregate BCR or with anti-IgM to coaagregate BCR with FcyRIIB.   Cells that have been stimulated with intact anti-IgM to coaggregate BCR with FcyRIIB can be further pre-incubated with the antibodies of the invention. FcyRIIB-dependent activity of cells can be measured by standard techniques known in the art. Comparing the level of FcyRIIB-dependent activity in cells that have been pre-incubated with the antibodies and cells that have not been pre-incubated, and comparing the levels would indicate a modulation of FcyRIIB-dependent activity by the antibodies.<br>
[00157]	Measuring FcyRIIB-dependent activity can include, for example, measuring<br>
intracellular calcium mobilization by flow cytometry, measuring phosphorylation of Akt and/or Erk, measuring BCR-mcdiated accumulation of PI(3,4,5)?3, or measuring FcyRIIB-mediated proliferation B cells.<br>
[00158]	The assays can be used, for example, to identify diabodies or anti-FcyRHB<br>
antibodies for use in the invention that modulate FcyRIIB-mediated inhibition of BCR<br>
signaling by blocking the ligand (IgG) binding site to FcyRIIB receptor and antagonizing<br>
FcyRIIB-mediated inhibition of BCR signaling by preventing coaggregation of FcyRIIB and<br>
BCR. The assays can also be used to identify antibodies that enhance coaggregation of<br>
FcyRIIB and BCR and agonize FcyRIIB-mediated inhibition of BCR signaling.<br>
[00159]	The anti-FcyRIIB antibodies can also be assayed for FcyRII-mediated<br>
signaling in human monocytes/macrophages. Coaggregation of FcyRIIB with a receptor bearing the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) acts to down-regulate FcyR-mediated phagocytosis using SHIP as its effector (Tridandapani et al. 2002, J. Biol. Chem. 277(7):5082-9). Coaggregation of FcyRIIA with FcyRIIB results in rapid phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue on FcyRIIB's ITIM motif, leading to an enhancement hi phosphorylation of SHIP, association of SHIP with She, and phosphorylation of proteins having the molecular weight of 120 and 60-65 kDa. In<br>
addition, coaggregation of FcyRIIA with FcyRIIB results in down-regulation of phosphorylation of Akt, which is a serine-threonine kinase that is involved In cellular regulation and serves to suppress apoptosis.<br>
[00160]	The anti-FcyRIIB diabodies can also be assayed for inhibition of FcyR-<br>
mediated phagocytosis hi human monocytes/macrophages. For example, cells from a human monocytic cell line, THP-1 can be stimulated either with Fab fragments of mouse monoclonal antibody IV.3 against FcyRH and goat anti-mouse antibody (to aggregate FcyRIIA alone), or with whole IV.3 mouse monoclonal antibody and goat anti-mouse antibody (to coaggregate FcyRIIA and FcyRIIB). In this system, modulation of down stream signaling molecules, such as tyrosine phosphorylation of FcyRIIB, phosphorylation of SHOP, association of SHIP with She, phosphorylation of Akt, and phosphorylation of proteins having the molecular weight of 120 and 60-65 kDa can be assayed upon addition of molecules of the invention to the stimulated cells. In addition, FcyRIIB-dependent phagocytic efficiency of the monocyte cell line can be directly measured in the presence and absence of the antibodies of the invention.<br>
3<br>
[00161]	Another exemplary assay for determining inhibition of FcyR-mediated<br>
phagocytosis in human monocytes/macrophages by the antibodies of the invention can comprise the following: stimulating THP-1 cells with either Fab of IV.3 mouse anti-FcyRII antibody and goat anti-mouse antibody (to aggregate FcyRIIA alone and elicit FcyRIIA-mediated signaling); or with mouse anti-FcyRII antibody and goat anti-mouse antibody (to coaggregate FcyRIIA and FcyRIIB and inhibiting FcyRIIA-mediated signaling.   Cells that have been stimulated with mouse anti-FcyRTI antibody and goat anti-mouse antibody can be further pre-incubated with the molecules of the invention. Measuring FcyRHA-dependent activity of stimulated cells that have been pre-incubated with molecules of the invention and cells that have not been pre-incubated with the antibodies of the invention and comparing levels of FcyRIIA-dependent activity hi these cells would indicate a modulation of FcyRIIA-dependent activity by the antibodies of the invention.<br>
[00162]	The exemplary assay described can be used for example, to identify binding<br>
domains that block ligand binding of FcyRIIB receptor and antagonize FcyRIIB-mediated<br>
inhibition of FcyRIIA signaling by preventing coaggregation of FcyRIIB and FcyRIIA.<br>
This assay likewise identifies binding domains that enhance coaggregation of FcyRIIB and<br>
FcyRIIA and agonize FcyRIIB-mediated Inhibition of FcyRIIA signaling.<br>
[00163]	The FcyRIIB binding domains of interest can be assayed while comprised I<br>
antibodies by measuring the ability of THP-1 cells to phagocytose fluoresceinated IgG-opsonized sheep red blood cells (SRBC) by methods previously described (Tridandapani et<br>
at, 2000, J. Biol. Chem. 275: 20480-7). For example, an exemplary assay for measuring phagocytosis comprises of: treating THP-1 cells with the antibodies of the invention or with a control antibody that does not bind to FcyRII, comparing the activity levels of said cells, wherein a difference in the activities of the cells (e.g., resetting activity (the number of THP-1 cells binding IgG-coated SRBC), adherence activity (the total number of SRBC bound to THP-1 cells), and phagocytic rate) would indicate a modulation of FcyRIIA-dependent activity by the antibodies of the invention. This assay can be used to identify, for example, antibodies that block ligand binding of FcyRIIB receptor and antagonize FcyRIIB-mediated inhibition of phagocytosis. This assay can also identify antibodies that enhance FcyRIIB-mediated inhibition of FcyPJIA signaling.<br>
[00164]	In a preferred embodiment, the binding domains modulate FcyRIIB-<br>
dependent activity in human monocytes/macrophages in at least one or more of the following ways: modulation of downstream signaling molecules (e.g., modulation of phosphorylation state of FcyRIIB, modulation of SHIP phosphorylation, modulation of SHIP and She association, modulation of phosphorylation of Akt, modulation of phosphorylation of additional proteins around 120 and 60-65 kDa) and modulation of phagocytosis.<br>
5.1.2   CD16A BINDING DOMAINS<br>
[00165]	The following section discusses GDI6A binding proteins which can be used<br>
as sources for light and heavy chain variable regions for covalent diabody production. In the present invention CD16A binding proteins includes molecules comprising VL and VH domains of anti-CD16A antibodies, which VH and VL domains are used in the production of the diabodies of the present invention.<br>
[00166]	A variety of CD16A binding proteins may be used in connection with the<br>
present invention. Suitable CD16A binding proteins include human or humanized monoclonal antibodies as well as CD16A binding antibody fragments (e.g., scFv or single chain antibodies, Fab fragments, minibodies) and another antibody-like proteins that bind to CD16A via an interaction with a light chain variable region domain, a heavy chain variable region domain, or both.<br>
[00167]	In some embodiments, the CD16A binding protein for use according to the<br>
invention comprises a VL and/or VH domain that has one or more CDRs with sequences derived from a non-human anti-CD 16A antibody, such as a mouse anti-CD 16A antibody, and one or more framework regions with derived from framework sequences of one or more human immunoglobulins. A number of non-human anti-CD16A monoclonal antibodies,<br>
from which CDR and other sequences may be obtained, are known (see, e.g., Tamm and Schmidt, 1996, J. Imm. 157:1576-81; Fleit et al., 1989, p.159; LEUKOCYTE TYPING II: HUMAN MYELOID AND HEMATOPOIETIC CELLS, Reinherz et al., eds. New York: Springer-Verlag; 1986; LEUCOCYTE TYPING III: WHITE CELL DIFFERENTIATION ANTIGENS McMichael A J, ed., Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1986); LEUKOCYTE TYPING IV: WHITE CELL DIFFERENTIATION ANTIGENS, Kapp et al., eds. Oxford Univ. Press, Oxford; LEUKOCYTE TYPING V: WHITE CELL DIFFERENTIATION ANTIGENS, Schlossman et al., eds. Oxford Univ. Press, Oxford; LEUKOCYTE TYPING VI: WHITE CELL DIFFERENTIATION ANTIGENS, Kishimoto, ed. Taylor &amp; Francis. In addition, as shown in the Examples, new GDI 6A binding proteins that recognize human CD16A expressed on cells can be obtained using well known methods for production and selection of monoclonal antibodies or related binding proteins (e.g., hybridoma technology, phage display, and the like). See, for example, O'Connel et al,, 2002, J. Mol. Biol. 321:49-56; Hoogenboom and Chames, 2000, Imm. Today 21:371078; Krebs et al., 2001, J. Imm. Methods 254:67-84; and other references cited herein. Monoclonal antibodies from a non-human species can be chimerized or humanized using techniques using techniques of antibody humanization known in the art.<br>
[00168]	Alternatively, fully human antibodies against CD16A can be produced using<br>
transgenic animals having elements of a human immune system (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos.<br>
5,569,825 and 5,545,806), using human peripheral blood cells (Casali et al., 1986, Science<br>
234:476), by screening a DNA library from human B cells according to the general protocol<br>
outlined by Huse et al., 1989, Science 246:1275, and by other methods.<br>
[00169]	In a preferred embodiment, the binding donor is from the 3G8 antibody or a<br>
humanized version thereof, e.g., such as those disclosed in U.S. patent application publication 2004/0010124, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. It is contemplated that, for some purposes, it may be advantageous to use CD16A binding proteins that bind the CD16A receptor at the same epitope bound by 3G8, or at least sufficiently close to this epitope to block binding by 3G8. Methods for epitope mapping and competitive binding experiments to identify binding proteins with the desired binding properties are well known to those skilled in the art of experimental immunology. See, for example, Harlow and Lane, cited supra; Stahl ct al., 1983, Methods in Enzymology 9:242-53; Kirkland et al., 1986, J. Immunol. 137:3614-19; Morel et al., 1988, Molec. Immunol. 25:7-15; Cheung et al., 1990, Virology 176:546-52; and Moldenhauer et al., 1990, Scand. J. Immunol. 32:77-82. For instance, it is possible to determine if two antibodies bind to the same site by using one of the antibodies to capture the antigen on an ELISA plate and then<br>
measuring tEe ability of the second antibody to bind to the captured antigen. Epitope comparison can also be achieved by labeling a first antibody, directly or indirectly, with an enzyme, radionuclide or fluorophore, and measuring the ability of an uulabeled second antibody to inhibit the binding of the first antibody to the antigen on cells, in solution, or on a solid phase.<br>
[00170]	It is also possible to measure the ability of antibodies to block the binding of<br>
the CD16A receptor to immune complexes formed on ELISA plates. Such immune<br>
complexes are formed by first coating the plate with an antigen such as fluorescein, then<br>
applying a specific anti-fluorescein antibody to the plate. This immune complex then serves<br>
as the ligand for soluble Fc receptors such as sFcRIIIa. Alternatively a soluble immune<br>
complex may be formed and labeled, directly or indirectly, with an enzyme radionuclide or<br>
fluorophore. The ability of antibodies to inhibit the binding of these labeled immune<br>
complexes to Fc receptors on cells, in solution or on a solid phase can then be measured.<br>
[00171]	CD 16A binding proteins of the invention may or may not comprise a human<br>
immunoglobulin Fc region. Fc regions are not present, for example, in scFv binding<br>
proteins. Fc regions are present, for example, in human or humanized tetrameric<br>
monoclonal IgG antibodies. As described supra, in some embodiments of the present<br>
invention, the CD16A binding protein includes an Fc region that has an altered effector<br>
function, e.g., reduced affinity for an effector ligand such as an Fc receptor or Cl<br>
component of complement compared to the unaltered Fc region (e.g., Fc of naturally<br>
occurring IgGl, proteins). In one embodiment the Fc region is not glycosylated at the Fc<br>
region amino acid corresponding to position 297. Such antibodies lack Fc effector function.<br>
[00172]	Thus, the CD16A binding protein may not exhibit Fc-mediated binding to an<br>
effector ligand such as an Fc receptor or the Cl component of complement due to the absence of the Fc domain in the binding protein while, in other cases, the lack of binding or effector function is due to an alteration in the constant region of the antibody.<br>
5.1.2.1    CD16A Binding Proteins Comprising CDR Sequences Similar to a mAb 3G8 CDR Sequences.<br>
[00173]	CD 16A binding proteins that can be used in the practice of the invention<br>
include proteins comprising a CDR sequence derived from (i.e., having a sequence the same as or similar to) the CDRs of the mouse monoclonal antibody 3G8. Complementary cDNAs encoding the heavy chain and light chain variable regions of the mouse 3G8 monoclonal antibody, including the CDR encoding sequences, were cloned and sequenced as described. The nucleic acid and protein sequences of 3G8 are provided below. Using the mouse variable region and CDR sequences, a large number of chimeric and humanized<br>
monoclonal antibodies, comprising complementary determining regions derived from 3G8 CDRs were produced and their properties analyzed. To identify humanized antibodies that bind CD16A with high affinity and have other desirable properties, antibody heavy chains comprising a VH region with CDRs derived from 3G8 were produced and combined (by coexpression) with antibody light chains comprising a VL region with CDRs derived from 3O8 to produce a tetrameric antibody for analysis. Properties of the resulting tetrameric antibodies were determined as described below. As described below, CD16A binding proteins comprising 3G8 CDRs, such as the humanized antibody proteins described herein, may be used according to the invention.<br>
5.1.2.1.1         VH Region<br>
[00174]	In one aspect, the CD16A binding protein of the invention may comprise a<br>
heavy chain variable domain in which at least one CDR (and usually three CDRS) have the sequence of a CDR (and more typically all three CDRS) of the mouse monoclonal antibody 3G8 heavy chain and for which the remaining portions of the binding protein are substantially human (derived from and substantially similar to, the heavy chain variable region of a human antibody or antibodies).<br>
[00175]	In an aspect, the invention provides a humanized 3G8 antibody or antibody<br>
fragment containing CDRs derived from the 3G8 antibody in a substantially human framework, but in which at least one of the CDRs of the heavy chain variable domain differs in sequence from the corresponding mouse antibody 3G8 heavy chain CDR. For example, in one embodiment, the CDR(S) differs from the 3G8 CDR sequence at least by having one or more CDR substitutions shown known in the art to affect binding of 3G8 to CD16A, as known in the art or as disclosed in Tables 3 and 4A-H. Suitable CD 16 binding proteins may comprise 0, 1,2, 3, or 4, or more of these substitutions (and often have from 1 to 4 of these substitutions) and optionally can have additional substitutions as well.

[00176]	In one embodiment, a CD16A binding protein may comprise a heavy chain<br>
variable domain sequence that is the same as, or similar to, the VH domain of the Hu3G8VH-l construct, the sequence of which is provided in SEQ ID N0:70. For example, the invention provides a CD 16A binding protein comprising a VH domain with a sequence that (1) differs from the VH domain of Hu3G8VH-l (SEQ ID NO:70) by zero, one, or more than one of the CDR substitutions set forth in Table 1; (2) differs from the VH domain of Hu3G8VH-l by zero, one or more than one of the framework substitutions set forth in Table 1; and (3) is at least about 80% identical, often at least about 90%, and sometimes at least about 95% identical, or even at least about 98% identical to the Hu3G8VH-l VH sequence at the remaining positions.<br>
[00177]         Exemplary VH domains of CD 16 binding proteins of the invention have the sequence of 3G8VH, Hu3G8VH-5 and Hu3G8VH-22 (SEQ ID NO:81, SEQ ID NO.71 and SEQ ID N0:72, respectively)e, Examplary nucleotide sequences encoding the sequences of 3G8VH and Hu3G8VH-5 (SEQ ID NO:81 and SEQ ID NOJ1, respectively) are provided by SEQ ID N0:82 and SEQ ID N0:83, respectively.<br>
[00178]	The VH domain may have a sequence that differs from that of Hu3G8VH-l<br>
(SEQ ID NO:70) by at least one, at least two, at least three, at least four 4, at least five, or at least six of the substitutions shown in Table 3. These substitutions are believed to result in increased affinity for CD 16 A and/or reduce the immunogenicity of a CD 16 A binding protein when administered to humans. In certain embodiments, the degree of sequence identity with the Hu3G8VH-l VH domain at the remaining positions is at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95% or at least about 98%.<br>
[00179]	For illustration and not limitation, the sequences of a number of CD 16A<br>
building protein VH domains is shown in Table 4. Heavy chains comprising these sequences fused to a human Cyl constant region were coexpressed with the hu3G8VL-l light chain (described below) to form tetrameric antibodies, and binding of the antibodies to CD16A was measured to assess the effect of ammo acid substitutions compared to the hu3G8VH-l VH domain. Constructs in which the VH domain has a sequence of hu3G8VH-l, 2,1, 4, 5, 8,12,14,16,17,18,19,20,22,23, 24,25,26, 27, 28,29, 30, 31, 32, 33,34,35, 36,37,42, 43, 44 and 45 showed high affinity binding, with hu3G8VH-6 and -40 VH domains showing intermediate binding. CD16A binding proteins comprising the VH domains of hu3G8VH-5 and hu3G8VH-22 (SEQ ID NO:71 and SEQ ID NO:72, respectively) are considered to have particularly favorable binding properties.<br>
5.1.2.2    VL Region<br>
[00180]	Similar studies were conducted to identify light chain variable domain<br>
sequences with favorable binding properties. In one aspect, the invention provides a<br>
CD16A binding protein containing a light chain variable domain in which at least one CDR<br>
(and usually three CDRs) has the sequence of a CDR (and more typically all three CDRs) of<br>
the mouse monoclonal antibody 3G8 light chain and for which the remaining portions of the<br>
binding protein are substantially human (derived from and substantially similar to, the<br>
heavy chain variable region of a human antibody or antibodies).<br>
[00181]	hi one aspect, the invention provides a fragment of a humanized 3G8<br>
antibody containing CDRs derived from the 3G8 antibody in a substantially human framework, but hi which at least one of the CDRs of the light chain variable domain differs<br>
in sequence from the mouse monoclonal antibody 3G8 light chain CDR. In one embodiment, the CDR(s) differs from the 3G8 sequence at least by having one or more amino acid substitutions in a CDR, such as, one or more substitutions shown in Table 2 (e.g., arginine at position 24 in CDRl; serine at position 25 in CDRl; tyrosine at position 32 in CDRl; leucine at position 33 in CDRl; aspartic acid, tryptophan or serine at position 50 in CDR2; serine at position 53 in CDR2; alanine or glutamine at position 55 in CDR2; threonine at position 56 in CDR2; serine at position 93 in CDR3; and/or threonine at position 94 in CDR3). In various embodiments, the variable domain can have 0,1,2,3,4, 5, or more of these substitutions (and often have from 1 to 4 of these substitutions) and optionally, can have additional substitutions as well.<br>
[00182]	In one embodiment, a suitable CD16A binding protein may comprise a light<br>
chain variable domain sequence that is the same as, or similar to, the VL domain of the Hu3G8VL-l (SEQ ID NO:73) construct, the sequence of which is provided in Table 6. For example, the invention provides a CD16A binding protein comprising a VL domain with a sequence that (1) differs from the VL domain of Hu3G8VL-l (SEQ ID NO:73) by zero, one, or more of the CDR substitutions set forth in Table 5; (2) differs from the VL domain of Hu3G8VL-l by zero, one or more of the framework substitutions set forth in Table 5; and (3) is at least about 80% identical, often at least about 90%, and sometimes at least about 95% identical, or even at least about 98% identical to the Hu3G8VL-l VL sequence (SEQ ID NO:73) at the remaining positions.<br>

[00183]	Exemplary VL domains of CD 16 binding proteins of the invention have the<br>
sequence of 3G8VL, Hu3G8VL-l or Hu3G8VL-43, (SEQ IDNO:84, SEQ IDNO:73 and SEQ ID N0:74, respectively) as shown in Tables 5 and 6. Exemplary nucleotide sequences encoding 3G8VL (SEQ ID NO:84) and Hu3G8VL-l (SEQ ID NO:73) are provided in SEQ ID N0:85 and SEQ ID NO:86, respectively.<br>
[00184]	The VL domain may have a sequence that differs from that of Hu3G8VL- 1<br>
(SEQ ID N0:73) by zero, one, at least two, at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 7, at least 8, or at least 9 of the substitutions shown in Table 2. These substitutions are believed to result in increased affinity for CD16A and/or reduce the immunogenicity of a CD16A binding protein when administered to humans. In certain embodiments, the degree of sequence identity at the remaining positions is at least about 80%, at least about 90% at least about 95% or at least about 98%.<br>
[00185]	For illustration and not limitation, the sequences of a number of CD 16 A<br>
binding proteins VL domains is shown in Table 6. Light chains comprising these sequences fused to a human CK. constant domain were coexpressed with a Hu3G8VH heavy chain (described above) to form tetrameric antibodies, and the binding of the antibodies to CD16A was measured to assess the effect of arnino acid substitutions compared to the Hu3G8VL-l VL domain (SEQ ID N0;73). Constructs in which the VL domain has a sequence of hu3G8VL-l, 2, 3,4, 5,10,16, 18,19,21,22,24,27, 28, 32,33,34, 35, 36, 37, and 42 showed high affinity binding and hu3G8VL-15,17,20,23,25,26,29,30,31, 38, 39,40 and 41 showed intermediate binding. CD16A binding proteins comprising the VL domains of hu3G8VL-l, hu3G8VL-22, and hu3G8VL-43 are considered to have particularly favorable binding properties (SEQ ID NO:73, SEQ ID NO:75 and SEQ ID N0:74, respectively).<br>
5.1.2.2.1 Combinations of VL and/or VII Domains<br>
[00186]	As is known in the art and described elsewhere herein, imrnunoglobulin light<br>
and heavy chains can be recombinantly expressed under conditions in which they associate<br>
to produce a diabody, or can be so combined in vitro. It will thus be appreciated that a 3G8-<br>
derived VL-domain described herein can be combined a 3G8-derived VH-domain described<br>
herein to produce a CD16A binding diabody, and all such combinations are contemplated.<br>
[00187]	For illustration and not for limitation, examples of useful CD16A diabodies<br>
are those comprising at least one VH domain and at least one VL domain, where the VH domain is from hu3G8VH-l, hu3G8VH-22 or hu3G8VH-5 (SEQ ID NO:70, SEQ ID N0:72 and SEQ ID NO:71, respectively) and the VL domain is from hu3G8VL-l, hu3G8VL-22 or hu3G8VL-43 (SEQ ID NO:73, SEQ ID NO:75 and SEQ ID NO:43, respectively). In particular, humanized antibodies that comprise hu3G8VH-22 (SEQ ID NO:22) and either, hu3G8VL-l, hu3G8VL-22 or hu3G8VL-43 (SEQ ID NO:73, SEQ ID N0:72 and SEQ ID NO:74, respectively), or hu3G8VH-5 (SEQ ID NO:71) and hu3G8VL-l (SEQ ID N0:73) have favorable properties.<br>
[00188]	It will be appreciated by those of skill that the sequences of VL and VH<br>
domains described here can be further modified by art-known methods such as affinity maturation (see Schier et al., 1996, J. Mol. Biol. 263:551-67; Daugherty et al., 1998, Protein Eng. 11:825-32; Boder et al., 1997, Nat. Biotechnol. 15:553-57; Boder et al., 2000, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A 97:10701-705; Hudson and Souriau, 2003, Nature Medicine 9:129-39). For example, the GDI 6A binding proteins can be modified using affinity maturation<br>
techniques to identify proteins with increased affinity for CD16A and/or decreased affinity for GDI6B.<br>
[00189]	One exemplary CD 16 binding protein is the mouse 3G8 antibody. Amino<br>
acid sequence comprising the VH and VL domains of humanized 3G8 are described in FIGS. 2, 9,14 and set forth in SEQ ID NO:9, SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID N0:14, SEQ ID N0:15, SEQ ID NO:16S SEQ ID N0:18, SEQ ID N0:19, SEQ ID N0:20, SEQ ID N0:21, SEQ ID N0:22, SEQ ID NO:70, SEQ ID N0:71, SEQ ID NO:72, SEQ ID NO:73andSEQIDNO:74.<br>
5.2      DIABODIES COMPRISING Fc REGIONS OR PORTIONS THEREOF<br>
[00190]	The invention encompasses diabody molecules comprising Fc domains or<br>
portions thereof (e.g., a CH2 or CHS domain). In certain embodiments the Fc domain, or portion(s) thereof, comprises one or more constant domain(s) of the Fc region of IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 (e.g., CH2 or CHS). In other embodiments, the invention encompasses molecules comprising and Fc domain or portion therof, wherein said Fc domain or portion thereof comprises at least one amino acid modification (e.g. substitution) relative to a comparable wild-type Fc domain or portion thereof. Variant Fc domains are well known in the art, and are primarily used to alter the phenotype of the antibody comprising said variant Fc domain as assayed in any of the binding activity or effector function assays well known in the art, e.g. ELISA, SPR analysis, or ADCC. Such variant Fc domains, or portions thereof, have use in the present invention by conferring or modifying the effector function exhibited by a diabody molecule of the invention comprising an Fc domain (or portion thereof) as functionally assayed, e.g., in anNK dependent or macrophage dependent assay. Fc domain variants identified as altering effector function are disclosed in International Application W004/063351, U.S. Patent Application Publications 2005/0037000 and 2005/0064514, U.S. Provisional Applications 60/626,510, filed November 10,2004, 60/636,663, filed December 15,2004, and 60/781,564, filed March 10, 2006, and U.S. Patent Applications 11/271,140, filed November 10, 2005, and 11/305,787, filed December 15,2005, concurrent applications of the Inventors, each of which is incorporated by reference hi its entirety.<br>
[00191]	In other embodiments, the invention encompasses the use of any Fc variant<br>
known in the art, such as those disclosed in Duncan et al, 1988, Nature 332:563-564; Lund et al., 1991, J. Immunol 147:2657-2662; Lund et al, 1992, Mol Immunol 29:53-59; Alegre et al, 1994, Transplantation 57:1537-1543; Hutchins et al., 1995, Proc Natl.

[00192]	In certain embodiments, said one or more modifications to the amino acids of<br>
the Fc region reduce the affinity and avidity of the Fc region and, thus, the diabody molecule of the invention, for one or more FcyR receptors. In a specific embodiment, the invention encompasses diabodies comprising a variant Fc region, or portion thereof, wherein said variant Fc region comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to a wild type Fc region, which variant Fc region only binds one FcyR, wherein said FcyR is FcyRHIA. In another specific embodiment, the invention encompasses diabodies comprising a variant Fc region, or portion thereof, wherein said variant Fc region comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to a wild type Fc region, which variant Fc region only binds one FcyR, wherein said FcyR is FcyRIIA. In another specific embodiment, the invention encompasses diabodies comprising a variant Fc region, or portion thereof, wherein said variant Fc region comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to a wild type Fc region, which variant Fc region only binds one FcyR, wherein said FcyR is FcyRIIB. In certain embodiments, the invention encompasses molecules comprising a variant Fc domain wherein said variant confers or mediates increased ADCC activity and/or an increased binding to FcyRIIA (CD32A), relative to a molecule comprising no Fc domain or comprising a wild-type Fc domain, as measured using methods known to one skilled in the art and described herein. In alternate embodiments, the invention encompasses molecules comprising a variant Fc domain wherein said variant confers or mediates decreased ADCC activity (or other effector function) and/or an increased binding to FcyRIIB (CD32B), relative to a molecule comprising no Fc domain or comprising a wild-type Fc domain, as measured using methods known to one skilled in the art and described herein.<br>
[00193]	The invention also encompasses the use of an Fc domain comprising<br>
domains or regions from two or more IgG isotypes. As known in the art, amino acid modification of the Fc region can profoundly affect Fc-mediated effector function and/or binding activity. However, these alterations in functional characteristics can be further<br>
refined and/or manipulated when implemented in the context of selected IgG isotypes. Similarly, the native characteristics of the isotype Fc may be manipulated by the one or more amino acid modifications. The multiple IgG isotypes (i.e., IgGl, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4) exhibit differing physical and functional properties including serum half-life, complement fixation, FcyR binding affinities and effector function activities (e.g. ADCC, CDC) due to differences in the amino acid sequences of their hinge and/or Fc domains.  In certain embodiments, the amino acid modification and IgG Fc region are independently selected based on their respective, separate binding and/or effector function activities in order to engineer a diabody with desired characteristics. In most embodiments, said amino acid modifications and IgG hinge/Fc regions have been separately assayed for binding and/or effector function activity as described herein or known in the art in an the context of an IgGl. In certain embodiments, said amino acid modification and IgG hinge/Fc region display similar functionality, e.g., increased affinity for FcyRIIA, when separately assayed for FcyR binding or effector function in the context of the diabody molecule or other Fc-containing molecule (e.g. and immunoglobulin). The combination of said amino acid modification and selected IgG Fc region then act additively or, more preferably, synergistically to modify said functionality in the diabody molecule of the invention, relative to a diabody molecule of the invention comprising a wild-type Fc region. In other embodiments, said amino acid modification and IgG Fc region display opposite functionalities, e.g., increased and decreased, respectively, affinity for FcyRIIA, when separately assayed for FcyR binding and/or effector function in the context of the diabody molecule or other Fc containing molecule (e.g., an immunoglobulin) comprising a wild-type Fc region as described herein or known in the art; the combination of said "opposite" amino acid modification and selected IgG region then act to selectively temper or reduce a specific functionality in the diabody of the invention relative to a diabody of the invention not comprising an Fc region or comprising a wild-type Fc region of the same isotype. Alternatively, the invention encompasses variant Fc regions comprising combinations of amino acid modifications known in the art and selected IgG regions that exhibit novel properties, which properties were not detectable when said modifications and/or regions were independently assayed as described herein.<br>
[00194]	The functional characteristics of the multiple IgG isotypes, and domains<br>
thereof, are well known in the art. The amino acid sequences of IgGl, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 are presented in FIGS. 1A-1B. Selection and/or combinations of two or more domains from specific IgG isotypes for use in the methods of the invention may be based on any known parameter of the parent istoypes including affinity to FcyR (Table 7; Flesch and<br>
Neppert, 1999, J. Clin. Lab. Anal. 14:141-156; Chappel et ah, 1993, J. Biol. Chem. 33:25124-25131; Chappel et al., 1991, Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:9036-9040, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). For example, use of regions or domains from IgG isotypes that exhibit limited or no binding to FcyRIIB, e.g., IgG2 or IgG4, may find particular use where a diabody is desired to be engineered to maximize binding to an activating receptor and minimize binding to an inhibitory receptor. Similarly, use of Fc regions or domains from IgG isotypes known to preferentially bind Clq or FcyRfflA, e.g., IgG3 (Bruggemann et al., 1987, J. Exp. Med 166:1351-1361), may be combined with Fc amino acid modifications of known in the art to enhance ADCC, to engineer a diabody molecule such that effector function activity, e.g., complement activation or ADCC, is maximized.<br>

5.3      MOLECULAR CONJUGATES<br>
[00196]	The diabody molecules of the invention may be rccombinantly fused or<br>
chemically conjugated (including both covalently and non-covalently conjugations) to<br>
heterologous polypeptides (i.e., an unrelated polypeptide; or portion thereof, preferably at<br>
least 10, at least 20, at least 30, at least 40, at least 50, at least 60, at least 70, at least 80, at<br>
least 90 or at least 100 amino acids of the polypeptide to generate fusion proteins. The<br>
fusion does not necessarily need to be direct, but may occur through linker sequences.<br>
[00197]	Further, the diabody molecules of the invention (i.e., polypeptides) may be<br>
conjugated to a therapeutic agent or a drug moiety that modifies a given biological response. As an alternative to direct conjugation, owing to the multiple epitope binding sites on the multivalent, e.g., tetravalent, diabody molecules of the invention, at least one binding region<br>
of the diabody may be designed to bind the therapeutic agent or desired drug moiety without affecting diabody binding.<br>
[00198]	Therapeutic agents or drug moieties are not to be construed as limited to<br>
classical chemical therapeutic agents. For example, the drug moiety may be a protein or polypeptide possessing a desired biological activity. Such proteins may include, for example, a toxin such as abrin, ricin A, pseudomonas exotoxin (Le., PE-40), or diphtheria toxin, ricin, gelonin, and pokeweed antiviral protein, a protein such as tumor necrosis factor, interferons including, but not limited to, a-interferon (IFN-a), p-interferon (IFN-P), nerve growth factor (NGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), an apoptotic agent (e.g., TNF-a, TNF-P, AIM I as disclosed in PCT Publication No. WO 97/33899), AIM E (see, PCT Publication No. WO 97/34911), Fas ligand (Takahashi et al, J. Immunol, 6:1567-1574,1994), and VEGI (PCT Publication No. WO 99/23105), a thrombotic agent or an anti-angiogenie agent (e.g., angiostatin or endostatin), or a biological response modifier such as, for example, a lymphokine (e.g., interleukin-1 ("IL-1"), interleukin-2 ("IL-2"), interleukin-6 ("IL-6"), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor ("GM-CSF"), and granulocyte colony stimulating factor ("G-CSF"), macrophage colony stimulating factor, ("M-CSF"), or a growth factor (e.g., growth hormone ("GH"); proteases, or ribonucleases.<br>
[00199]	The diabody molecules of the invention (/. e., polypeptides) can be fused to<br>
marker sequences, such as a peptide to facilitate purification. In preferred embodiments, the marker amino acid sequence is a hexa-histidine peptide, such as the tag provided in apQE vector (QIAGEN, Inc., 9259 Eton Avenue, Chatsworth, CA, 91311), among others, many of which are commercially available. As described in Gentz et al, 1989, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 86:821-824, for instance, hexa-histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. Other peptide tags useful for purification include, but are not limited to, the hemagglutinin "HA" tag, which corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein (Wilson et al., Cell, 37:767 1984) and the "flag" tag (Knappik et al, Biotechniques, 17(4):754-761, 1994).<br>
[00200]	Additional fusion proteins may be generated through the techniques of gene-<br>
shuffling, motif-shuffling, exon-shuffling, and/or codon-shuffling (collectively referred to as "DNA shuffling"). DNA shuffling may be employed to alter the activities of molecules of the invention (e.g., epitope binding sites with higher affinities and lower dissociation rates). See, generally, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,605,793; 5,811,238; 5,830,721; 5,834,252; and 5,837,458, and Patten e/ al., 1997, Curr. Opinion Biotechnol. 8:724-33; Harayama, 1998, Trends Biotechnol. 16:76; Hansson, et al, 1999, J. Uol BioL 287:265; and Lorenzo and<br>
Blasco, 1998, BioTechniques 24:308 (each of these patents and publications are hereby<br>
incorporated by reference in its entirety). The diabody molecules of the invention, or the<br>
nucleic acids encoding the molecules of the invention, may be further altered by being<br>
subjected to random mutagenesis by error-prone PCR, random nucleotide insertion or other<br>
methods prior to recombination. One or more portions of a polynucleotide encoding a<br>
molecule of the invention, may be recombined with one or more components, motifs,<br>
sections, parts, domains, fragments, etc. of one or more heterologous molecules.<br>
[00201]	The present invention also encompasses diabody molecules of the invention<br>
conjugated to or immunospecifically recognizing a diagnostic or therapeutic agent or any other molecule for which serum half-life is desired to be increased/decreased and/or targeted to a particular subset of cells. The molecules of the invention can be used diagnostically to, for example, monitor the development or progression of a disease, disorder or infection as part of a clinical testing procedure to, e.g., determine the efficacy of a given treatment regimen. Detection can be facilitated by coupling the molecules of the invention to a detectable substance or by the molecules immunospecifically recognizing the detectable substance. Examples of detectable substances include various enzymes, prosthetic groups, fluorescent materials, luminescent materials, biolumincscent materials, radioactive materials, positron emitting metals, and nonradioactive paramagnetic metal ions. The detectable substance may be coupled or conjugated either directly to the molecules of the invention or indirectly, through an intermediate (such as, for example, a linker known in the art) using techniques known in the art, or the molecule may immunospecifically recognize the detectable substance: immunospecifically binding said substance. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,741,900 for metal ions which can be conjugated to antibodies for use as diagnostics according to the present invention. Such diagnosis and detection can be accomplished designing the molecules to immunospecifically recognize the detectable substance or by coupling the molecules of the invention to detectable substances including, but not limited to, various enzymes, enzymes including, but not limited to, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, or acetylcholinestcrase; prosthetic group complexes such as, but not limited to, streptavidin/biotin and avidin/biotin; fluorescent materials such as, but not limited to, umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin; luminescent material such as, but not limited to, luminol; bioluminescent materials such as, but not limited to, luciferase, luciferin, and aequorin; radioactive material such as, but not limited to, bismuth (213Bi), carbon (14C), chromium (51Cr), cobalt (57Co), fluorine (18F), gadolinium (!53Gd, I59Gd), gallium (68Ga, 67Ga), germanium (68Gc), holmium<br>

various positron emission tomographies, and nonradioactive paramagnetic metal ions.<br>
[00202]	The diabody molecules of the invention may immunospecifically recognize<br>
or be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety such as a cytotoxin (e.g., a cytostatic or cytocidal agent), a therapeutic agent or a radioactive element (e.g., alpha-emitters, gamma-emitters, etc.}. Cytotoxins or cytotoxic agents include any agent that is detrimental to cells. Examples include paclitaxol, cytochalasin B, gramicidin D, ethidium bromide, emetine, mitomycin, etoposide, tenoposide, vincristine, vinblastine, colchicin, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, dihydroxy anthracin dione, mitoxantrone, mithramycin, actinomycin D, 1-dehydrotestosteronej glucocorticoids, procaine, tetracaine, Hdocaine, propranolol, and puromycin and analogs or homologs thereof.

designed to immunospecifically recognize therapeutic moieties such as a radioactive<br>
materials or macrocyclic chclators useful for conjugating radiometal ions (see above for<br>
examples of radioactive materials). In certain embodiments, the macrocyclic chelator is<br>

[00205]	The diabody molecule of the invention may be administered with or without<br>
a therapeutic moiety conjugated to it, administered alone, or in combination with cytotoxic factor(s) and/or cytokine(s) for use as a therapeutic treatment. Where administered alone, at least one epitope of a multivalent, e.g., tetravalent, diabody molecule may be designed to immunospecifically recognize a therapeutic agent, e.g., cytotoxic factor(s) and/or cytokine(s), which may be administered concurrently or subsequent to the molecule of the invention. In this manner, the diabody molecule may specifically target the therapeutic agent in a manner similar to direct conjugation. Alternatively, a molecule of the invention, can be conjugated to an antibody to form an antibody heteroconjugate as described by Segal in U.S. Patent No. 4,676,980, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Diabody molecules of the invention may also be attached to solid supports, which are particularly useful for immunoassays or purification of the target antigen. Such solid supports include, but are not limited to, glass, cellulose, polyacrylamide, nylon, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride or polypropylene.<br>
5.4      CHARACTERIZATION OF BINDING OF DIABODY MOLECULES<br>
[00206]	The diabody molecules of the present invention may be characterized in a<br>
variety of ways. In particular, molecules of the invention may be assayed for the ability to immunospecifically bind to an antigen, e.g., FcPJIIA or FcRIIB, or, where the molecule comprises an Fc domain (or portion thereof) for the ability to exhibit Fc-FcyR interactions, i.e. specific binding of an Fc domain (or portion thereof) to an FcyR. Such an assay may be performed in solution (e.g., Houghten, Bio/Techniques, 13:412-421, 1992), on beads (Lam, Nature, 354:82-84,1991, on chips (Fodor, Nature, 364:555-556,1993), on bacteria (U.S. Patent No. 5,223,409), on spores (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,571,698; 5,403,484; and 5,223,409), onplasmids (Cull etal,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89:1865-1869,1992) oronphage (Scott and Smith, Science, 249:386-390,1990; Devlin, Science, 249:404-406, 1990; Cwirla<br>
etal, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 87:6378-6382,1990; andFelici, J. Mol Biol,<br>
222:301-310,1991) (each of these references is incorporated by reference herein in its<br>
entirety). Molecules that have been identified to immunospecifically bind to an antigen,<br>
e.g., FcyRIILA, can then be assayed for their specificity and affinity for the antigen.<br>
[00207]	Molecules of the invention that have been engineered to comprise multiple<br>
epitope binding domains may be assayed for immunospecific binding to one or more antigens (e.g., cancer antigen and cross-reactivity with other antigens (e.g., FcyR)) or, where the molecules comprise am Fc domain (or portion thereof) for Fc-FcyR interactions by any method known in the art. Immunoassays which can be used to analyze immunospecific binding, cross-reactivity, and Fc-FcyR interactions include, but are not limited to, competitive and non-competitive assay systems using techniques such as western blots, radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), "sandwich" immunoassays, immunoprecipitation assays, precipitin reactions, gel diffusion precipitin reactions, immunodiffusion assays, agglutination assays, complement-fixation assays, immunoradiometric assays, fluorescent immunoassays, protein A immunoassays, to name but a few. Such assays are routine and well known in the art (see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, me., New York, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).<br>
[00208]	The binding affinity and the off-rate of antigen-binding domain interaction or<br>
Fc-FcyR interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled antigen, such as tetrameric FcyR (e.g., 3H or 125I, see Section 5.4.1) with a molecule of interest (e.g., molecules of the present invention comprising multiple epitope binding domains in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled epitope, such as tetrameric FcyR(see Section 5.4.1), and the detection of the molecule bound to the labeled antigen. The affinity of the molecule of the present invention for an antigen and the binding off-rates can be determined from the saturation data by Scatchard analysis.<br>
[00209]	The affinities and binding properties of the molecules of the invention for an<br>
antigen or FcyR may be initially determined using in vitro assays (biochemical or immunological based assays) known in the art for antigen-binding domain or Fc-FcyR, interactions, including but not limited to ELISA assay, surface plasmon resonance assay, immunoprecipitation assays. Preferably, the binding properties of the molecules of the invention are also characterized by in vitro functional assays for determining one or more FcyR mediator effector cell functions, as described in section 5.4.2. In most preferred<br>
embodiments, the molecules of the invention have similar binding properties in in vivo models (such as those described and disclosed herein) as those in in vitro based assays. However, the present invention does not exclude molecules of the invention that do not exhibit the desired phenotype in in vitro based assays but do exhibit the desired phenotype in vivo.<br>
[00210]	In some embodiments, screening and identifying molecules comprising<br>
multiple epitope binding domains and, optionally, Fc domains (or portions thereof) are done functional based assays, preferably in a high throughput manner. The functional based assays can be any assay known in the art for characterizing one or more FcyR mediated effector cell functions such as those described herein in Sections 5.4.2 and 5.4.3. Non-limiting examples of effector cell functions that can be used in accordance with the methods of the invention, include but are not limited to, antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent phagocytosis, phagocytosis, opsonization, opsouophagocytosis, cell binding, resetting, Clq binding, and complement dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity,<br>
[00211]	In a preferred embodiment, BIAcore kinetic analysis is used to determine the<br>
binding on and off rates of molecules of the present invention to an antigen or and FcyR. BIAcore kinetic analysis comprises analyzing the binding and dissociation of an antigen or FcyR from chips with immobilized molecules (e.g., molecules comprising epitope binding domains or Fc domains (or portions thereof), respectively) on their surface. BIAcore analysis is described in Section 5.4.3.<br>
[00212]	Preferably, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), using any of the<br>
techniques known to those skilled in the art, is used for immunological or functional based assay to characterize molecules of the invention. Flow sorters are capable of rapidly examining a large number of individual cells that have been bound, e.g., opsonized, by molecules of the invention (e.g., 10-100 million cells per hour) (Shapiro et al, Practical Flow Cytornetry, 1995). Additionally, specific parameters used for optimization of diabody behavior, include but are not limited to, antigen concentration (i.e., FcyR tetrameric complex, see Section 5.4.1), kinetic competition time, or FACS stringency, each of which may be varied in order to select for the diabody molecules comprising molecules of the invention which exhibit specific binding properties, e.g., concurrent binding to multiple epitopes. Flow cytometers for sorting and examining biological cells are well known in the art. Known flow cytometers are described, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,347,935; 5,464,581; 5,483,469; 5,602,039; 5,643,796; and 6,211,477; the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein. Other known flow cytometers are the FACS Vantage™<br>
system manufactured by Becton Dickinson and Company, and the COP AS™ system manufactured by Union Biometrica.<br>
[00213]	Characterization of target antigen binding affinity or Fc-FcyR binding<br>
affinity, and assessment of target antigen or FcyR density on a cell surface may be made by methods well known in the art such as Scatchard analysis or by the use of kits as per manufacturer's instructions, such as Quantum™ Simply Cellular ® (Bangs Laboratories, Inc., Fishers, IN). The one or more functional assays can be any assay known in the art for characterizing one or more FcyR mediated effector cell function as known to one skilled in the art or described herein. In specific embodiments, the molecules of the invention comprising multiple epitope binding domains and, optionally, and Fc domain (or portion thereof) are assayed in an ELISA assay for binding to one or more target antigens or one or more FcyRs, e.g., FcyRIIIA, FcyRIIA, FcyRIIA; followed by one or more ADCC assays. In some embodiments, the molecules of the invention are assayed further using a surface plasmon resonance-based assay, e.g., BIAcore.   Surface plasmon resonance-based assays are well known in the art, and are further discussed in Section 5.4.3, and exemplified herein, e.g., in Example 6.1.<br>
[00214]	In most preferred embodiments, the molecules of the invetion comprising<br>
multiple epitope binding domains and, optionally, and Fc domain (or portion thereof) is further characterized in an animal model for interaction with a target antigen (e.g., an FcyR) or for Fc-FcyR interaction. Where Fc-FcyR interactions are to be assessed, preferred animal models for use in the methods of the invention are, for example, transgenic mice expressing human FcyRs, e.g., any mouse model described in U.S. Patent No. 5,877,397, and 6,676,927 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Further transgenic mice for use in such methods include, but are not limited to, nude knockout FcyRIIIA mice carrying human FcyRIIIA; nude knockout FcyRIIIA mice carrying human FcyRIIA; nude knockout FcyRIIIA mice carrying human FcyRIIB and human FcyRIIIA; nude knockout FcyRIIIA mice carrying human FcyRIIB and human FcyRIIA; nude knockout FcyRIIIA and FcyRIIA mice carrying human FcyRIIIA and FcyRIIA and nude knockout FcyRIIIA, FcyRIIA and FcyRIIB mice carrying human FcyRIIIA, FcyRIIA and FcyRIIB.<br>
5.4.1    BINDING ASSAYS COMPRISING FcyR<br>
[00215]	Characterization of binding to FcyR by molecules comprising an Fc domain<br>
(or portion thereof) and/or comprising epitope binding domain specific for an FcyR may be done using any FcyR, including but not limited to polymorphic variants of FcyR. In some embodiments, a polymorphic variant of FcyRIIIA is used, which contains a phenylalanine<br>
at position 158. In other embodiments, characterization is done using a polymorphic variant of FcyRfflA which contains a valine at position 158. FcyRHIA 158V displays a higher affinity for IgGl than 158F and an increased ADCC activity (see, e.g., Koene et al, 1997, Blood, 90:1109-14; VfuetaL, 1997, J. din. Invest. 100:1059-70, both of which are incorporated herein by reference ha their entireties); this residue in fact directly interacts with the lower hinge region of IgGl as recently shown by IgGl-FeyRIIIA co-crystallization studies, see, e.g., Sonderman et al, 2000, Nature, 100: 1059-70, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Studies have shown that in some cases, therapeutic antibodies have improved efficacy in FcyRIIIA-158V homozygous patients. For example, humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody Rituximab was thcrapeutically more effective inFcyRIIIA158V homozygous patients compared to FcyRIIIA 158F homozygous patients (See, e.g., Cartron et al, 2002 Blood, 99(3): 754-8). In other embodiments, therapeutic molecules comprising this region may also be more effective on patients heterozygous for FcyRJIIA-158V and FcyRIIIA- 158F, and in patients with FcyRIIA-131H, Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, selection of molecules of the invention with alternate allotypes may provide for variants that once engineered into therapeutic diabodies will be clinically more efficacious for patients homozygous for said allotype.<br>
[00216]	An FcyR binding assay was developed for determining the binding of the<br>
molecules of the invention to FcyR, and, in particular, for determining binding of Fc domains to FcyR. The assay allowed detection and quantitation of Fc-FcyR interactions, despite the inherently weak affinity of the receptor for its ligand, e.g., in the micromolar range for FcyRJIB and FcyRIIIA. The method is described in detail in International Application W004/063351 and U.S. Patent Application Publications 2005/0037000 and 2005/0064514, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Briefly, the method involves the formation of an FcyR complex that may be sued in any standard immunoassay known in the art, e.g., FACS, ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, etc. Additionally, the FcyR complex has an improved avidity for an Fc region, relative to an uncomplexed FcyR. According to the invention, the preferred molecular complex is a tetrameric immune complex, comprising: (a) the soluble region of FcyR (e.g., the soluble region of FcyRIIIA, FcyRIIA or FcyRIIB); (b) a biotinylated 15 amino acid AVITAG sequence (AVITAG) operably linked to the C-terminus of the soluble region of FcyR (e.g., the soluble region of FcyRTIIA, FcyRIIA or FcyRIIB); and (c) streptavidin-phycoerytlirin (SA-PE); in a molar ratio to form a tetrameric FcyR complex (preferably in a 5:1 molar<br>
 <br>
ratio). The fusion protein is biotinylated enzymatically, using for example, the E.coli Bir A<br>
enzyme, a biotin ligase which specifically biotinylates a lysine residue in the 15 amino acid<br>
AVITAG sequence. The biotinylated soluble FcyR proteins are then mixed with SA-PE in a<br>
IX SA-PE.-5X biotinylated soluble FcyR molar ratio to form a tetrameric FcyR complex.<br>
[00217]	Polypeptides comprising Fc regions have been shown to bind the tetrameric<br>
FcyR complexes with at least an 8-fold higher affinity than the monomeric uncomplexed FcyR. The binding of polypeptidcs comprising Fc regions to the tetrameric FcyR complexes may be determined using standard techniques known to those skilled in the art, such as for example, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), radioimmunoassays, ELISA assays, etc.<br>
[00218]	The invention encompasses the use of the immune complexes comprising<br>
molecules of the invention, and formed according to the methods described above, for determining the functionality of molecules comprising an Fc region in cell-based or cell-free assays.<br>
[00219]	As a matter of convenience, the reagents may be provided in an assay kit,<br>
i.e., a packaged combination of reagents for assaying the ability of molecules comprising an Fc regions to bind FcyR tetrameric complexes. Other forms of molecular complexes for use in determining Fc-FcyR interactions are also contemplated for use in the methods of the invention, e.g., fusion proteins formed as described in U.S. Provisional Application 60/439,709, filed on January 13, 2003; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
5.4.2    FUNCTIONAL ASSAYS OF MOLECULES WITH VARIANT HEAVY CHAINS<br>
[00220]	The invention encompasses characterization of the molecules of the<br>
invention comprising multiple epitope binding domains and, optionally, Fc domains (or portions thereof) using assays known to those skilled in the art for identifying the effector cell function of the molecules. In particular, the invention encompasses characterizing the molecules of the invention for FcyR-mediated effector cell function. Additionally, where at least one of the target antigens of the diabody molecule of the invention is an FcyR, binding of the FcyR by the diabody molecule may serve t,o activate FcyR-mediated pathways similar to those activated by FcyR-Fc binding. Thus, where at least one eptiope binding domain of the diabody molecule recognizes an FcyR, the diabody molecule may elicit FcyR-mediated effector cell function without containing an Fc domain (or portion thereof), or without concomitant Fc-FcyR binding. Examples of effector cell functions that can be assayed in accordance with the invention, include but are not limited to, antibody-dependent cell<br>
mediated cytotoxicity, phagocytosis, opsonization, opsonophagocytosis, Clq binding, and<br>
complement dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Any cell-based or cell free assay known<br>
to those skilled in the art for determining effector cell function activity can be used (For<br>
effector cell assays,'see Perussia et at, 2000, Methods Mol Biol. 121:179-92; Baggiolini et<br>
at., 1998 Experientia, 44(10): 841-8; Lehmann etal., 2000 J. Immunol. Methods, 243(1-2):<br>
229-42; Brown EJ. 1994, Methods Cell Biol, 45: 147-64; Munn et al, 1990 J. Exp. Med.,<br>
172:231-237, Abdul-Majid et al, 2002 Sccmd. J, Immunol 55: 70-81; Ding et al, 1998,<br>
Immunity 8:403-411, each of which is incorporated by reference herein hi its entirety).<br>
[00221]	In one embodiment, the molecules of the invention can be assayed for FcyR-<br>
mediated phagocytosis in human monocytes. Alternatively, the FcyR-mediated phagocytosis of the molecules of the invention may be assayed in other phagocytes, e.g., neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leuckocytes; PMN); human peripheral blood monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, which can be obtained using standard procedures known to those skilled in the art (e.g., see Brown EJ. 1994, Methods Cell Biol, 45: 147-164). In one embodiment, the function of the molecules of the invention is characterized by measuring the ability of THP-1 cells to phagocytose fluoresceinated IgG-opsonized sheep red blood cells (SRBC) by methods previously described (Tridandapani et al, 2000, J. Biol. Chem, 275:20480-7).<br>
[00222]	Another exemplary assay for determining the phagocytosis of the molecules<br>
of the invention is an antibody-dependent opsonophagocytosis assay (ADCP) which can comprise the following: coating a target bioparticle such as Escherichia co/z-labeled FITC (Molecular Probes) or Staphylococcus aureus-FTTC with (i) wild-type 4-4-20 antibody, an antibody to fluorescein (See Bedzyk et al, 1989, J. Biol Chem, 264(3): 1565-1569, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety), as the control antibody for FcyR-dependent ADCP; or (ii) 4-4-20 antibody harboring the D265A mutation that knocks out binding to FcyRIII, as a background control for FcyR-dependent ADCP (iii) a diabody comprising the epitope binding domain of 4-4-20 and an Fc domain and/or an cpitopc binding domain specific for FcyRIII; and forming the opsonized particle; adding any of the opsonized particles described (i-iii) to THP-1 effector cells (a monocytic cell line available from ATCC) at a 1:1,10:1, 30:1, 60:1, 75:1 or a 100: 1 ratio to allow FcyR-mediated phagocytosis to occur; preferably incubating the cells and E. co//-FITC/antibody at 37°C for 1.5 hour; adding trypan blue after incubation (preferably at room temperature for 2-3 min.) to the cells to quench the fluorescence of the bacteria that are adhered to the outside of the cell surface without being internalized; transferring cells into a FACS buffer (e.g., 0.1%, BSA in PBS, 0.1%, sodium azide), analyzing the fluorescence of the THP1 cells using<br>
FACS (e.g., BD FACS Calibur). Preferably, the THP-1 cells used in the assay are analyzed by FACS for expression of FcyR on the cell surface. THP-1 cells express both CD32A and CD64. CD64 is a high affinity FcyR that is blocked in conducting the ADCP assay in accordance with the methods of the invention. The THP-1 cells are preferably blocked with 100 jag/mL soluble IgGl or 10% human serum. To analyze the extent of ADCP, the gate is preferably set on THP-1 cells and median fluorescence intensity is measured. The ADCP activity for individual mutants is calculated and reported as a normalized value to the wild type chMab 4-4-20 obtained. The opsonized particles are added to THP-1 cells such that the ratio of the opsonized particles to THP-1 cells is 30:1 or 60:1. In most preferred embodiments, the ADCP assay is conducted with controls, such as E. co//-FITC hi medium, E. co//-FITC and THP-1 cells (to serve as FcyR-independent ADCP activity), E. coli-FITC, THP-1 cells and wild-type 4-4-20 antibody (to serve as FcyR-dependent ADCP activity), E co/z-FITC, THP-1 cells, 4-4-20 D265A (to serve as the background control for FcyR-dependent ADCP activity).<br>
[00223]	In another embodiment, the molecules of the invention can be assayed for<br>
FcyR-mediated ADCC activity in effector cells, e.g., natural killer cells, using any of the standard methods known to those skilled in the art (See e.g., Perussia et al, 2000, Methods Mol Biol 121: 179-92; Weng et al., 2003, J. Clin. Oncol. 21:3940-3947; Ding et al, Immunity, 1998, 8:403-11). An exemplary assay for determining ADCC activity of the molecules of the invention is based on a 51Cr release assay comprising of: labeling target cells with [51Cr]Na2CrC-4 (this cell-membrane permeable molecule is commonly used for labeling since it binds cytoplasmic proteins and although spontaneously released from the cells with slow kinetics, it is released massively following target cell necrosis); opsonizing the target cells with the molecules of the invention comprising variant heavy chains; combining the opsonized radiolabeled target cells with effector cells in a microtitre plate at an appropriate ratio of target cells to effector cells; incubating the mixture of cells for 16-18 hours at 37°C; collecting supernatants; and analyzing radioactivity. The cytotoxicity of the molecules of the invention can then be determined, for example using the following formula: % lysis - (experimental cpm - target leak cpm)/(detergent lysis cpm - target leak cpm) x 100%. Alternatively, % lysis =(ADCC-AICC)/(maximum release-spontaneous release). Specific lysis can be calculated using the formula: specific lysis = % lysis with the molecules of the Invention - % lysis in the absence of the molecules of the invention. A graph can be generated by varying either the target: effector cell ratio or antibody concentration.<br>
[00224]	Preferably, the effector cells used in the ADCC assays of the invention arc<br>
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) that are preferably purified from normal human blood, using standard methods known to one skilled in the art, e.g., using Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation. Preferred effector cells for use in the methods of the invention express different FcyR activating receptors. The invention encompasses, effector cells, THP-1, expressing FcyRI, FcyRIIA and FcyRIIB, and monocyte derived primary macrophages derived from whole human blood expressing both FcyRIIIA and FcyRIIB, to determine if heavy chain antibody mutants show increased ADCC activity and phagocytosis relative to wild type IgGl antibodies.<br>
[00225]	The human monocyte cell line, THP-1, activates phagocytosis through<br>
expression of the high affinity receptor FcyRI and the low affinity receptor FcyRIIA (Flcit et al., 1991, J. Leuk. Biol. 49: 556). THP-1 cells do not constitutively express FcyRIIA or FcyRIIB. Stimulation of these cells with cytokines effects the FcR expression pattern (Pricop et al., 2000 J. Immunol. 166: 531-7). Growth of THP-1 cells in the presence of the cytokine IL4 induces FcyRIIB expression and causes a reduction in FcyRIIA and FcyRI expression. FcyRIIB expression can also be enhanced by increased cell density (Tridandapani et al, 2002, J. Biol Chem. 277: 5082-9). In contrast, it has been reported that IFNy can lead to expression of FcyRIIIA (Pearse et al, 1993 PNAS USA 90: 4314-8). The presence or absence of receptors on the cell surface can be determined by FACS using common methods known to one skilled in the art. Cytokine induced expression of FcyR on the cell surface provides a system to test both activation and inhibition in the presence of FcyRIIB. If THP-1 cells are unable to express the FcyRIIB the invention also encompasses another human monocyte cell line, U937. These cells have been shown to terminally differentiate into macrophages in the presence of IFNy and TNF (Koren et al, 1979, Nature 279:328-331).<br>
[00226],         FcyR dependent tumor cell killing is mediated by macrophage and NK cells in mouse tumor models (Clynes et al, 1998, PNAS USA 95: 652-656). The invention encompasses the use of elutriated monocytes from donors as effector cells to analyze the efficiency Fc mutants to trigger cell cytotoxicity of target cells in both phagocytosis and ADCC assays. Expression patterns of FcyRI, FcyRIIIA, and FcyRIIB are affected by different growth conditions. FcyR expression from frozen elutriated monocytes, fresh elutriated monocytes, monocytes maintained in 10% FBS, and monocytes cultured in FBS + GM-CSF and or in human scrum may be determined using common methods known to tiiose skilled in the art. For example, cells can be stained with FcyR specific antibodies and<br>
analyzed by FACS to determine FcR profiles. Conditions that best mimic macrophage in<br>
vivo FcyR expression is then used for the methods of the invention.<br>
[00227]	In some embodiments, the invention encompasses the use of mouse cells<br>
especially when human cells with the right FcyR profiles are unable to be obtained. In some<br>
embodiments, the invention encompasses the mouse macrophage cell line<br>
RAW264.7(ATCC) which can be transfected with human FcyRIIIA and stable transfectants<br>
isolated using methods known in the art, see, e.g., Ralph et al., L Immunol. 119: 950-4).<br>
Transfectants can be quantitated for FcyRIIIA expression by FACS analysis using routine<br>
experimentation and high expressors can be used in the ADCC assays of the invention. In<br>
other embodiments, the invention encompasses isolation of spleen peritoneal macrophage<br>
expressing human FcyR from knockout transgenic mice such as those disclosed herein.<br>
[00228]	Lymphocytes may be harvested from peripheral blood of donors (PBM)<br>
using a Ficoll-Paque gradient (Pharmacia). Within the isolated mononuclear population of cells the majority of the ADCC activity occurs via the natural killer cells (NK) containing FcyRIIIA but not FcyRIIB on their surface. Results with these cells indicate the efficacy of the mutants on triggering NK cell ADCC and establish the reagents to test with elutriated monocytes.<br>
[00229]	Target cells used in the ADCC assays of the invention include, but are not<br>
limited to, breast cancer cell lines, e.g., SK-BR-3 with ATCC accession number HTB-30 (see, e.g., Tremp et al, 1976, Cancer Res. 33-41); B-lymphocytes; cells derived from Burkitts lymphoma, e.g., Raji cells with ATCC accession number CCL-86 (see, e.g., Epstein et al, 1965, J. Nail. Cancer Inst. 34: 231-240), and Daudi cells with ATCC accession number CCL-213 (see, e.g., Klein et al, 1968, Cancer Res. 28: 1300-10). The target cells must be recognized by the antigen binding site of the diabody molecule to be assayed.<br>
[00230]	The ADCC assay is based on the ability of NK cells to mediate cell death via<br>
an apoptotic pathway. NK cells mediate cell death in part by FcyRIIIA's recognition of an IgG Fc domain bound to an antigen on a cell surface. The ADCC assays used in accordance with the methods of the invention may be radioactive based assays or fluorescence based assays. The ADCC assay used to characterize the molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions comprises labeling target cells, e.g., SK-BR-3, MCF-7, OVCAR3, Raji, Daudi cells, opsonizing target cells with an antibody that recognizes a cell surface receptor on the target cell via its antigen binding site; combining the labeled opsonized target cells and the effector cells at an appropriate ratio, which can be determined by routine<br>
experimentation; harvesting the cells; detecting the label in the supernatant of the lysed target cells, using an appropriate detection scheme based on the label used. The target cells may be labeled either with a radioactive label or a fluorescent label, using standard methods known in the art. For example the labels include, but are not limited to, [SICr]Na2Cr04; and the acetoxymethyl ester of the fluorescence enhancing ligand, 2,2':6',2"-terpyridine-6-6"-dicarboxylate (IDA).<br>
[00231]	In a specific preferred embodiment, a time resolved fluorimetric assay is<br>
used for measuring ADCC activity against target cells that have been labeled with the acetoxymethyl ester of the fluorescence enhancing ligand, 2,2':6&gt;,2"-terpvridine-6-6"-dicarboxylate (TDA). Such fluorimetric assays are known in the art, e.g., see, Dlomberg etal, 1996, Journal of Immunological Methods, 193: 199-206; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Briefly, target cells are labeled with the membrane permeable acetoxymethyl diester of TDA (bis(acetoxymethyl) 2,2':6',2"-terpyridine-6-6"-dicarboxylate, (BATDA), which rapidly diffuses across the cell membrane of viable cells. Intracellular esterases split off the ester groups and the regenerated membrane impermeable TDA molecule is trapped inside the cell. After incubation of effector and target cells, e.g., for at least two hours, up to 3.5 hours, at 37°C, under 5% CC&gt;2, the TDA released from the lysed target cells is chelated with Eu3+ and the fluorescence of the Europium-TDA chelates formed is quantitated in a time-resolved fluorometer (e.g., Victor 1420, Perkin Elmer/Wallace).<br>
[00232]	In another specific embodiment, the ADCC assay used to characterize the<br>
molecules of the invention comprising multiple epitope binding sites and, optionally, an Fc domain (or portion thereof) comprises the following steps: Preferably 4-5x106 target cells (e.g., SK-BR-3, MCF-7, OVCAR3, Raji cells) are labeled with bis(acetoxymethyl) 2,2':6',2"-terpyridine-t-6"-dicarboxylate (DELFIA BATDA Reagent, Perkin Elmer/Wallac). For optimal labeling efficiency, the number of target cells used in the ADCC assay should preferably not exceed 5xl06. BATDA reagent is added to the cells and the mixture is incubated at 37°C preferably under 5% CCh, for at least 30 minutes. The cells are then washed with a physiological buffer, e.g., PBS with 0.125 mM sulfinpyrazole, and media containing 0.125 mM sulfmpyrazole. The labeled target cells are then opsonized (coated) with a molecule of the invention comprising an epitope binding domain specific for FcyRIIA and, optionally, an Fc domain (or portion thereof). In preferred embodiments, the molecule used in the ADCC assay is also specific for a cell surface receptor, a tumor antigen, or a cancer antigen. The diabody molecule of the invetion may specifically bind any cancer or tumor antigen, such as those listed in section 5.6.1. The target cells in the<br>
ADCC asstiy are chosen according to the epltope binding sites engineered into the diabody of the invention, such that the diabody binds a cell surface receptor of the target cell specifically.<br>
[00233J	Target cells are added to effector cells, e.g., PBMC, to produce<br>
effectontarget ratios of approximately 1:1, 10:1, 30:1, 50:1, 75:1, or 100:1. The effector and target cells are incubated for at least two hours, up to 3.5 hours, at 37°C, under 5% COz. Cell supcrnatants are harvested and added to an acidic europium solution (e.g., DELFIA Europium Solution, Perkin Elmer/Wallac). The fluorescence of the Europium-TDA chelates formed is quantitated in a time-resolved fluorometer (e.g., Victor 1420, Perkin Elmer/Wallac). Maximal release (MR) and spontaneous release (SR) are determined by incubation of target cells with 1% TX-100 and media alone, respectively. Antibody independent cellular cytotoxicity (AICC) is measured by incubation of target and effector cells in the absence of a test molecule, e.g., diabody of the invention. Each assay is preferably performed in triplicate. The mem percentage specific lysis is calculated as: Experimental release (ADCC) - AICC)/(MR-SR) x 100.<br>
[00234]	The invention encompasses assays known in the art, and exemplified herein,<br>
to characterize the binding of Clq and mediation of complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) by molecules of the invention comprising Fc domains (or portions thereof). To determine Clq binding, a Clq binding ELISA may be performed. An exemplary assay may comprise the following: assay plates may be coated overnight at 4C with polypeptide comprising a molecule of the invention or starting polypeptide (control) in coating buffer. The plates may then be washed and blocked. Following washing, an aliquot of human Clq may be added to each well and incubated for 2 hrs at room temperature. Following a further wash, 100 uL of a sheep anti-complement Clq peroxidase conjugated antibody may be added to each well and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The plate may again be washed with wash buffer and 100 ul of substrate buffer containing OPD,(O-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma)) may be added to each well. The oxidation reaction, observed by the appearance of a yellow color, may be allowed to proceed for 30 minutes and stopped by the addition of 100 ul of 4.5 NH2 SO4. The absorbance may then read at (492-405) nm.<br>
[00235]	To assess complement activation, a complement dependent cytotoxicity<br>
(CDC) assay may be performed, e.g. as described in Gazzano-Santoro et al., J. Immunol. Methods 202:163 (1996), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Briefly, various concentrations of the molecule comprising a (variant) Fc domain (or portion thereof) and human complement may be diluted with buffer. Cells which express the<br>
antigen to which the diabody molecule binds may be diluted to a density of about 1x10 cells/ml. Mixtures of the diabody molecules comprising a (variant) Fc domain (or portion thereof), diluted human complement and cells expressing the antigen may be added to a flat bottom tissue culture 96 well plate and allowed to incubate for 2 hrs at 37C. and 5% C02 to facilitate complement mediated cell lysis. 50 uL of alamar blue (Accumed International) may then be added to each well and incubated overnight at 37 C. The absorbance is measured using a 96-well fluorometer with excitation at 530 mn and emission at 590 run. The results may be expressed in relative fluorescence units (RFU). The sample concentrations may be computed from a standard curve and the percent activity as compared to nonvariant molecule, i.e., a molecule not comprising an Fc domain or comprising anon-variant Fc domain, is reported for the variant of interest.<br>
5.4.3    OTHER ASSAYS<br>
[00236]	The molecules of the invention comprising multiple epitope binding domain<br>
and, optionally, an Fc domain may be assayed using any surface plasmon resonance based<br>
assays known in the art for characterizing the kinetic parameters of an antigen-binding<br>
domain or Fc-FcyR binding. Any SPR instrument commercially available including, but not<br>
limited to, BIAcore Instruments, available from Biacore AB (Uppsala, Sweden); lAsys<br>
instruments available from Affinity Sensors (Franklin, MA.); IBIS system available from<br>
Windsor Scientific Limited (Berks, UK), SPR-CELLIA systems available from Nippon<br>
Laser and Electronics Lab (Hokkaido, Japan), and SPR Detector Spreeta available from<br>
Texas Instruments (Dallas, TX) can be used in the instant invention. For a review of SPR-<br>
based technology see Mullet et al, 2000, Methods 22: 77-91; Dong et al., 2002, Review in<br>
Mol. Biotech, 82: 303-23; Fivash et al, 1998, Current Opinion in Biotechnology 9: 97-101;<br>
Rich et al., 2000, Current Opinion in Biotechnology 11: 54-61; all of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Additionally, any of the SPR instruments<br>
and SPR based methods for measuring protein-protein interactions described in U.S. Patent<br>
No.'s 6,373,577; 6,289,286; 5,322,798; 5,341,215; 6,268,125 are contemplated in the<br>
methods of the invention, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
[00237]	Briefly, SPR based assays involve immobilizing a member of a binding pan-<br>
on a surface, and monitoring its interaction with the other member of the binding pair in solution in real time. SPR is based on measuring the change in refractive index of the solvent near the surface that occurs upon complex formation or dissociation. The surface onto which the immobilization occur is the sensor chip, which is at the heart of the SPR technology; it consists of a glass surface coated with a thin layer of gold and forms the basis<br>
for a range of specialized surfaces designed to optimize the binding of a molecule to the surface. A variety of sensor chips are commercially available especially from the companies listed supra, all of which may be used in the methods of the invention. Examples of sensor chips include those available from DIAcore AB, Inc., e.g., Sensor Chip CMS, SA, NTA, and HPA. A molecule of the invention may be immobilized onto the surface of a sensor chip using any of the immobilization methods and chemistries known in the art, including but not limited to, direct covalent coupling via amine groups, direct covalent coupling via sulfhydryl groups, biotin attachment to avidin coated surface, aldehyde coupling to carbohydrate groups, and attachment through the histidine tag with NTA chips.<br>
[00238]	In some embodiments, the kinetic parameters of the binding of molecules of<br>
the invention comprising multiple epitope binding sites and, optionally, and Fc domain, to an antigen or an FcyR may be determined using a BIAcore instrument (e.g., BIAcore instrument 1000, BIAcore Inc., Piscataway, NJ). As discussed supra, see section 5.4.1, any FcyR can be used to assess the binding of the molecules of the invention either where at least one epitope binding site of the diabody molecule immunospecifically recognizes an FcyR, and/or where the diabody molecule comprises an Fc domain (or portion thereof). In a specific embodiment the FcyR is FcyRIIIA, preferably a soluble monomeric FcyRIIIA. For example, in one embodiment, the soluble monomeric FcyRIIIA is the extracellular region of FcyRIIIA joined to the linker-AVITAG sequence (see, U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/439,498, filed on January 9, 2003 (Attorney Docket No. 11183-004-888) and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/456,041 filed on March 19, 2003, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties). In another specific embodiment, the FcyR is FcyRIIB, preferably a soluble dimeric FcyRIlB. For example in one embodiment, the soluble dimeric FcyRIIB protein is prepared in accordance with the methodology described hi U.S. Provisional application No. 60/439,709 filed on January 13, 2003, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
[00239]	For all immunological assays, FcyR recognition/binding by a molecule of the<br>
invention may be effected by multiple domains: hi certain embodiments, molecules of the invention immunospecifically recognize an FcyR via one of the multiple epitope binding domains; in yet other embodiments, where the molecule of the invetion comprises an Fc domain (or portion thereof), the diabody molecule may immunospecifically recognize an FcyR via Fc-FcyR interactions; in yet further embodiments, where a molecule of the invetion comprises both an Fc domain (or portion thereof) and an epitope binding site that<br>
immunospecifically recognizes an FcyR, the diabody molecule may recognize an FcyR via one or both of an epitope binding domain and the Fc domain (or portion thereof). An exemplary assay for determining the kinetic parameters of a molecule comprising multiple epitope binding domains and, optionally, and Fc domain (or portion thereof) to an antigen and/or an FcyR using a BIAcore instrument comprises the following: a first antigen is immobilized on one of the four flow cells of a sensor chip surface, preferably through amine coupling chemistry such that about 5000 response units (RU) of said first antigen is immobilized on the surface. Once a suitable surface is prepared, molecules of the invention that immunospecifically recognize said first antigen are passed over the surface, preferably by one minute injections of a 20 jag/mL solution at a 5 uL/mL flow rate. Levels of molecules of the invention bound to the surface at this stage typically ranges between 400 and 700 RU. Next, dilution series of a second antigen (e.g., FcyR) or FcyR receptor in HBS-P buffer (20mM HEPES, 150 mMNaCl, 3mM EDTA, pH 7.5) are injected onto the surface at 100 uL/min Regeneration of molecules between different second antigen or receptor dilutions is carried out preferably by single 5 second injections of lOOmM NaHCOa pH 9.4; 3M NaCl. Any regeneration technique known in the art is contemplated in the method of the invention.<br>
[00240]	Once an entire data set is collected, the resulting binding curves are globally<br>
fitted using computer algorithms supplied by the SPR instrument manufacturer, e.g., BIAcore, Inc. (Piscataway, NJ). These algorithms calculate both the Kon and Koff, from which the apparent equilibrium binding constant, Kd is deduced as the ratio of the two rate constants (i.e., Kofj/Kon). More detailed treatments of how the individual rate constants are derived can be found in the BIAevaluaion Software Handbook (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). The analysis of the generated data may be done using any method known in the art. For a review of the various methods of interpretation of the kinetic data generated see Myszka, 1997, Current Opinion in Biotechnology 8: 50-7; Fisher et al, 1994, Current Opinion in Biotechnology 5: 389-95; O'Shannessy, 1994, Current Opinion in Biotechnology, 5:65-71; Chaikene/a/., 1992, Analytical Biochemistry, 201: 197-210; Morton etal, 1995, Analytical Biochemistry 227: 176-85; O'Shannessy et al, 1996, Analytical Biochemistry 236: 275-83; all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
[00241]	In preferred embodiments, the kinetic parameters determined using an SPR<br>
analysis, e.g., BIAcore, may be used as a predictive measure of how a molecule of the invention will function in a functional assay, e.g., ADCC. An exemplary method for predicting the efficacy of a molecule of the invention based on kinetic parameters obtained<br>
from an SPR analysis may comprise the following: determining the Revalues for binding of a molecule of the invention to FcyRIIIA and FcyRIIB (via an epitope binding domain and/or an Fc domain (or portion thereof)); plotting (1) Koff (wt)/Koff (mut) for FcyRIIIA; (2) Koff (mut)/K0ff (wt) for FcyRIIB against the ADCC data. Numbers higher than one show a decreased dissociation rate for FcyRIIIA and an increased dissociation rate for FcyRIIB relative to wild type; and possess and enhanced ADCC function.<br>
5.5      METHODS OF PRODUCING DIABODY MOLECULES OF THE INVENTION<br>
[00242]	The diabody molecules of the present invention can be produced using a<br>
variety of methods well known in the art, including de novo protein synthesis and recornbinant expression of nucleic acids encoding the binding proteins. The desired nucleic acid sequences can be produced by recornbinant methods (e.g., PCR mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant of the desired polynucleotide) or by solid-phase DNA synthesis. Usually recombinant expression methods are used. In one aspect, the invention provides a polynucleotide that comprises a sequence encoding a CD16A VH and/or VL; in another aspect, the invention provides a polynucleotide that comprises a sequence encoding a CD32B VH and/or VL. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a variety of nucleic acid sequences encode each immunoglobulin amino acid sequence, and the present invention includes all nucleic acids encoding the binding proteins described herein.<br>
5.5.1    POLYNUCLEOTIDES ENCODING MOLECULES OF THE INVENTION.<br>
[00243J	The present invention also includes polynucleotides that encode the<br>
molecules of the invention, including the polypeptides and antibodies. The polynucleotides<br>
encoding the molecules of the invention may be obtained, and the nucleotide sequence of<br>
the polynucleotides determined, by any method known in the art.<br>
[00244]	Once the nucleotide sequence of the molecules that are identified by the<br>
methods of the invention is determined, the nucleotide sequence may be manipulated using methods well known in the art, e.g., recombinant DNA techniques, site directed mutagenesis, PCR, etc. (see, for example, the techniques described in Sambrook et al., 2001, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY; and Ausubel et al, eds., 1998, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &amp; Sons, NY, which are both incorporated by reference herein in their entireties), to generate, for example, antibodies having a different amino acid sequence, for example by generating amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions.<br>
K one embodiment, human libraries or any other libraries available in the art, can be screened by standard techniques known in the art, to clone the nucleic acids encoding the molecules of the invention.<br>
5.5.2   RECOMBINANT EXPRESSION OF MOLECULES OF THE INVENTION<br>
[00246]	Once a nucleic acid sequence encoding molecules of the invention (i.e.,<br>
antibodies) has been obtained, the vector for the production of the molecules may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing the coding sequences for the molecules of the invention and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include, for example, in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques, and in vivo genetic recombination. (See, for example, the techniques described in Sambrook et a!., 1990, Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory, Manual, 2d Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY and Ausubel et al. eds., 1998, Current PrQtocolsJn Molecular Biology. John Wiley &amp; Sons, NY).<br>
[00247]	An expression vector comprising the nucleotide sequence of a molecule<br>
identified by the methods of the invention can be transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques (e.g., electroporation, liposomal transfection, and calcium phosphate precipitation) and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce the molecules of the invention. In specific embodiments, the expression of the molecules of the invention is regulated by a constitutive, an inducible or a tissue, specific promoter.<br>
[00248]	The host cells used to express the molecules identified by the methods of the<br>
invention may be either bacterial cells such as Escherichia coli, or, preferably, eukaryotic cells, especially for the expression of whole recombinant immunoglobulin molecule. In particular, mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO), in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for immunoglobulins (Foecking et al, 1998, Gene 45:101; Cockett et al, 1990, Bio/Technology 8:2).<br>
[00249]	A variety of host-expression vector systems may be utilized to express the<br>
molecules identified by the methods of the invention. Such host-expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of the molecules of the invention may be produced and subsequently purified, but also represent cells which may, when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences, express the molecules of<br>
the invention in situ. These include, but are not limited to, microorganisms such as bacteria (e.g., E. coll and B. subtilis) transformed withrecombinant bacteriophage DNA, plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing coding sequences for the molecules identified by the methods of the invention; yeast (e.g., Saccharomyces Pichid) transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing sequences encoding the molecules identified by the methods of the invention; insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., baclovirus) containing the sequences encoding the molecules identified by the methods of the invention; plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors (e.g., Ti plasmid) containing sequences encoding the molecules identified by the methods of the invention; or mammalian cell systems (e.g., COS, CHO, BHK, 293,293T, 3T3 cells, lymphotic cells (see U.S. 5,807,715), Per C.6 cells (human retinal cells developed by Crucell) harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells (e.g., metallothionein promoter) or from mammalian viruses (e.g., the adenovirus late promoter; the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter).<br>
[00250]	In bacterial systems, a number of expression vectors may be advantageously<br>
selected depending upon the use intended for the molecule being expressed. For example, when a large quantity of such a protein is to be produced, for the generation of pharmaceutical compositions of an antibody, vectors which direct the expression of high levels effusion protein products that are readily purified may be desirable. Such vectors include, but are not limited, to the E. coll expression vector pUR278 (Ruther et al., 1983, EMBO J. 2:1791), in which the antibody coding sequence may be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a fusion protein is produced; pIN vectors (Inouye &amp; Inouye, 1985, Nucleic Acids Res. 13:3101-3109; Van Heeke &amp; Schuster, 1989, J. Biol Chem. 24:5503-5509); and the like. pGEX vectors may also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST). In general, such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to a matrix glutathione-agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.<br>
[00251], In an insect system, Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) is used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in Spodoptera frugiperda cells. The antibody coding sequence may be cloned individually into non-<br>
essential regions (e.g., the polyhedrin gene) of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter (e.g., the polyhedrin promoter).<br>
[00252]	In mammalian host cells, a number of viral-based expression systems may be<br>
utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector, the antibody coding sequence of interest may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription/translation control complex, e.g., the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non-essential region of the viral genome (e.g., region El or E3) will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the immunoglobulin molecule in infected hosts (e.g., see Logan &amp; Shenk, 1984, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:355-359). Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore, the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins, both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements, transcription terminators, etc. (see Bittner et al, 1987, Methods in Enzymol. 153:51 -544).<br>
[00253]	In addition, a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression<br>
of the inserted sequences, or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications (e.g., glycosylation) and processing (e.g., cleavage) of protein products may be important for the function of the protein. For example, in certain embodiments, the polypeptides comprising a diabody molecule of the invention may be expressed as a single gene product (e.g., as a single polypeptide chain, i.e., as a polyprotein precursor), requiring proteolytic cleavage by native or recombinant cellular mechanisms to form the separate polypeptides of the diabody molecules of the invention. The invention thus encompasses engineering a nucleic acid sequence to encode a polyprotein precursor molecule comprising the polypeptides of the invention, which includes coding sequences capable of directing post translational cleavage of said polyprotein precursor. Post-translational cleavage of the polyprotein precursor results in the polypeptides of the invention. The post translational cleavage of the precursor molecule comprising the polypeptides of the invention may occur in vivo (i.e., within the host cell by native or recombinant cell systems/mechanisms, e.g. furin cleavage at an appropriate site) or may occur in vitro (e.g. incubation of said polypeptide chain in a composition comprising proteases or peptidases of known activity and/or in a composition comprising conditions or<br>
'reagents known to foster the desired proteolytic action). Purification and modification of recombinant proteins is well known in the art such that the design of the polyprotein precursor could include a number of embodiments readily appreciated by a skilled worker. Any known proteases or peptidases known in the art can be used for the described modification of the precursor molecule, e.g., thrombin (which recognizes the amino acid sequence LVPRAQS (SEQ ID NO:91)), or factor Xa (which recognizes the amino acid sequence I(E/D)GRA (SEQ ID NO:92) (Nagani et al., 1985, PNAS USA 82:7252-7255, and reviewed in Jenny et al, 2003, Protein Expr. Purif. 31:1-11, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety)), enterokinase (which recognizes the amino acid sequence DDDDKA (SEQ ID NO:93) (Collins-Racie et al., 1995, Biotechnol. 13:982-987 hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety)), furin (which recognizes the amino acid sequence RXXRA, with a preference for RX(K/R)RA (SEQ ID NO:94 and SEQ ID NO:95, respectively) (additional R at P6 position appears to enhance cleavage)), and AcTEV (which recognizes the amino acid sequence ENLYFQAQ (SEQ ID N0:96) (Parks et al., 1994, Anal. Biochem. 216:413 hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety)) and the Foot and Mouth Disease Virus Protease C3. See for example, section 6.4, supra.<br>
[00254]	Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post-<br>
translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell<br>
lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the<br>
foreign protein expressed. To this end, eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular<br>
machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript, glycosylation, and<br>
phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include but<br>
are not limited to CHO, VERY, BHK, Hela, COS, MDCK, 293, 293T, 3T3, WI38, BT483,<br>
Hs578T, HTB2, BT20 and T47D, CRL7030 and Hs578Bst.<br>
[00255]	For long-term, high-yield production of recombinant proteins, stable<br>
expression is preferred. For example, cell lines which stably express an antibody of the invention may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication, host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements (e.g., promoter, enhancer, sequences, transcription terminators, polyadenylation sites, etc.}, and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA, engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media, and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded<br>
into cell lines.' 'l/his method may advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express the antibodies of the invention. Such engineered cell lines may be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compounds that interact directly or indirectly with the molecules of the invention.<br>
[00256]	A number of selection systems may be used, including but not limited to the<br>
herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Wigler et al, 1977, Cell 11: 223), hypoxanthine-<br>
guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Szybalska &amp; Szybalski, 1992, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.<br>
USA 48:202), and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Lowy et al, 1980, Cell 22: 817)<br>
genes can be employed in tk-, hgprt- or aprt- cells, respectively. Also, antimetabolite<br>
resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes: dhfr, which confers<br>
resistance to methotrexate (Wigler etal, 1980, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:357; O'Hare<br>
etal, 1981, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 78: 1527); gpt, which confers resistance to<br>
mycophenolic acid (Mulligan &amp; Berg, 1981, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78: 2072); neo,<br>
which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G-418 Clinical Pharmacy 12: 488-505; Wu<br>

[00257]	The expression levels of a molecule'of the invention can be increased by<br>
vector amplification (for a review, see Bebbington and Hentschel, The use of vectors based<br>
on gene amplification for the expression of cloned genes in mammalian cells in DNA<br>
cloning. Vol. 3 (Academic Press, New York, 1987). When a marker in the vector system<br>
expressing an antibody is amplifiablc, increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of<br>
host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region<br>
is associated with the nucleotide sequence of a polypeptide of the diabody molecule,<br>
production of the polypeptide will also increase (Grouse et al, 1983, Mol Cell Biol 3:257).<br>
[00258]	The host cell may be co-transfected with two expression vectors of the<br>
invention, the first vector encoding the first polypeptide of the diabody molecule and the second vector encoding the second polypeptide of the diabody molecule. The two vectors may contain identical selectable markers which enable equal expression of both<br>
polypeptides. Alternatively, a single vector may be used which encodes both polypeptides. The coding sequences for the polypeptides of the molecules of the invention may comprise cDNA or genomic DNA.<br>
[00259]	Once a molecule of the invention (i. e., diabodies) has been recombinantly<br>
expressed, it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of polypeptides, polyproteins or diabodies (e.g., analogous to antibody purification schemes based on antigen selectivity) for example, by chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, particularly by affinity for the specific antigen (optionally after Protein A selection where the diabody molecule comprises an Fc domain (or portion thereof)), and sizing column chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of polypeptides, polyproteins or diabodies.<br>
5.6      PROPHYLACTIC AND THERAPEUTIC METHODS<br>
[00260]	The molecules of the invention are particularly useful for the treatment<br>
and/or prevention of a disease, disorder or infection where an effector cell function (e.g., ADCC) mediated by FcyR is desired (e.g., cancer, infectious disease). As discussed supra, the diabodies of the invetion may exhibit antibody-like functionality in eliciting effector function although the diabody molecule does not comprise and Fc domain. By comprising at least one epitope binding domain that immunospecifically recognizes an FcyR, the diabody molecule may exibit FcyR binding and activity analogous to Fc-FcyR interactions. For example, molecules of the invention may bind a cell surface antigen and an FcyR (e.g., FcyRIIIA) on an immune effector cell (e.g., NK cell), stimulating an effector function (e.g., ADCC, CDC, phagocytosis, opsonization, etc.) against said cell.<br>
[00261]	In other embodiments, the diabody molecule of the invention comprises an<br>
Fc domain (or portion thereof). In such embodiments, the Fc domain may further comprise at least one amino acid modification relative to a wild-type Fc domain (or portion thereof) and/or may comprise domains from one or more IgG isotypes (e.g., IgGl, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4). Molecules of the invetion comprising variant Fc domains may exhibit conferred or altered phenotypes relative to molecules comprising the wild type Fc domain such as an altered or conferred effector function activity (e.g., as assayed in an NK dependent or macrophage dependent assay). In said embodiments, molecules of the invention with conferred or altered effector function activity are useful for the treatment and/or prevention of a disease, disorder or infection where an enhanced efficacy of effector function activity is desired. In certain embodiments, the diabody molecules of the invention comprising an Fc domain (or portion thereof) mediate complement dependent cascade. Fc domain variants<br>
identified as altering effector function are disclosed in International Application WO04/063351, U.S. Patent Application Publications 2005/0037000 and 2005/0064514, U.S. Provisional Applications 60/626,510, filed November 10,2004, 60/636,663, filed December 15,2004, and 60/781,564, filed March 10,2006, and U.S. Patent Applications 11/271,140, filed November 10,2005, and 11/305,787, filed December 15, 2005, concurrent applications of the Inventors, each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
[00262]	The invention encompasses methods and compositions for treatment,<br>
prevention or management of a cancer in a subject, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of one or more molecules comprising one or more epitope binding sites, and optionally, an Fc domain (or portion thereof) engineered in accordance with the invention, which molecule further binds a cancer antigen. Molecules of the invention are particularly useful for the prevention, inhibition, reduction of growth or regression of primary tumors, metastasis of cancer cells, and infectious diseases. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, molecules of the invention mediate effector function resulting in tumor clearance, tumor reduction or a combination thereof. In alternate embodiments, the diabodies of the invention mediate therapeutic activity by cross-linking of cell surface antigens and/or receptors and enhanced apoptosis or negative growth regulatory signaling.<br>
[00263]	Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, the<br>
diabody molecules of the invention exhibit enhanced therapeutic efficacy relative to<br>
therapeutic antibodies known in the art, in part, due to the ability of diabody to<br>
immunospecifically bind a target cell which expresses a particular antigen (e.g., FcyR) at<br>
reduced levels, for example, by virtue of the ability of the diabody to remain on the target<br>
cell longer due to an improved avidity of the diabody-cpitopc interaction.<br>
[00264]	The diabodies of the invention with enhanced affinity and avidity for<br>
antigens (e.g., FcyRs) are particularly useful for the treatment, prevention or management of a cancer, or another disease or disorder, in a subject, wherein the Fc7Rs are expressed at low levels in the target cell populations. As used herein, FcyR expression in cells is defined in terms of the density of such molecules per cell as measured using common methods known to those skilled in the art. The molecules of the invention comprising multiple epitope binding sites and, optionally, and FcyR (or portion thereof) preferably also have a conferred or an enhanced avidity and affinity and/or effector function in cells which express a target antigen, e.g., a cancer antigen, at a density of 30,000 to 20,000 molecules/cell, at a density of 20,000 to 10,000 molecules/cell, at a density of 10,000 molecules/cell or less, at a density<br>
 <br>
of 5000 molecules/cell or less, or at a density of 1000 molecules /cell or less. The molecules of the invention have particular utility in treatment, prevention or management of a disease or disorder, such as cancer, in a sub-population, wherein the target antigen is expressed at low levels in the target cell population.<br>
[00265]	The molecules of the invention may also be advantageously utilized in<br>
combination with other therapeutic agents known in the art for the treatment or prevention of diseases, such as cancer, autoimmune disease, inflammatory disorders, and infectious diseases. In a specific embodiment, molecules of the invention may be used in combination with monoclonal or chimeric antibodies, lymphokines, or hematopoietic growth factors (such as, e.g., IL-2, IL-3 and IL-7), which, for example, serve to increase the number or activity of effector cells which interact with the molecules and, increase immune response. The molecules of the invention may also be advantageously utilized in combination with one or more drugs used to treat a disease, disorder, or infection such as, for example anti-cancer agents, anti-inflammatory agents or anti-viral agents, e.g., as detailed in Section 5.7.<br>
5.6.1    CANCERS<br>
[00266]	The invention encompasses methods and compositions for treatment or<br>
prevention of cancer in a subject comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of one or more molecules comprising multiple epitope binding domains. In some embodiments, the invention encompasses methods and compositions for the treatment or prevention of cancer in a subject with FcyR polymorphisms such as those homozygous for the FyRIIIA-158V or FcyRIIIA-158F alleles. hi some embodiments, the invention encompasses engineering at least one epitope binding domain of the diabody molecule to immunospecifically bind FcyRIIIA (158F). In other embodiments, the invention encompasses engineering at least one epitope binding domain of the diabody molecule to immunospecifically bind FcyRIIIA (158V).<br>
[00267]	The efficacy of standard monoclonal antibody therapy depends on the FcyR<br>
polymorphism of the subject (Carton etal., 2002 Blood, 99:'754-8; Weng etal, 2003 JClin 
engineered to comprise a variant Fc domain that exhibits enhanced affinity to FcyR (relative<br>
to a wild type Fc domain) on effector cells. The engineered molecules of the invention<br>
provide better immunotherapy reagents for patients regardless of their FcyR polymorphism.<br>
[00268]	Diabody molecules engineered in accordance with the invention are tested by<br>
ADCC using either a cultured cell line or patient derived PMBC cells to determine the ability of the Fc mutations to enhance ADCC. Standard ADCC is performed using methods disclosed herein. Lymphocytes are harvested from peripheral blood using a Ficoll-Paque gradient (Pharmacia). Target cells, i.e., cultured cell lines or patient derived cells, are loaded with Europium (PerkinElmer) and incubated with effectors for 4 hrs at 37°C. Released Europium is detected using a fluorescent plate reader (Wallac). The resulting ADCC data indicates the efficacy of the molecules of the invention to trigger NK cell mediated cytotoxicity and establish which molecules can be tested with both patient samples and elutriated monocytes. Diabody molecules showing the greatest potential for eliciting ADCC activity are then tested in an ADCC assay using PBMCs from patients. PBMC from healthy donors are used as effector cells.<br>
[00269]	Accordingly, the invention provides methods of preventing or treating cancer<br>
characterized by a cancer antigen by engineering the diabody molecule to<br>
immunospecifically recognize said cancer antigen such that the diabody molecule is itself<br>
cytotoxic (e.g., via crosslinking of surface receptors leading to increased apoptosis or<br>
downregulation of proliferative signals) and/or comprises an Fc domain, according to the<br>
invention, and/or mediates one or more effector function (e.g., ADCC, phagocytosis). The<br>
diabodies that have been engineered according to the invention are useful for prevention or<br>
treatment of cancer, since they have an cytotoxic activity (e.g., enhanced tumor cell killing<br>
and/or enhanced for example, ADCC activity or CDC activity).<br>
[00270]	Cancers associated with a cancer antigen may be treated or prevented by<br>
administration of a diabody that binds a cancer antigen and is cytotoxic, and/or has been engineered according to the methods of the invention to exhibit effector function.

[00275]	In some embodiments, molecules of the invention comprise an epitope<br>
binding domain specific for FcyRIIB and or/ a variant Fc domain (or portion thereof), engineered according to methods of the invention, which Fc domain exhibits greater affinity for FcyRIIB and decreased affinity for FcyRIIIA and/or FcyRIIA relative to a wild-type Fc domain. Molecules of the invention with such binding characteristics are useful in regulating the immune response, e.g., in inhibiting the immune response in connection with autoimmune diseases or inflammatory diseases. Although not intending to be bound by any mechanism of action, molecules of the invention with an affinity for Fey RUB and/or comprising an Fc domain with increased affinity for FcyRIIB and a decreased affinity for FcyRIIIA and/or FcyRIIA may lead to dampening of the activating response to FcyR and inhibition of cellular responsiveness, and thus have therapeutic efficacy for treating and/or preventing an autoimmune disorder.<br>

one or more symptoms associated with an inflammatory disorder in a subject further comprising, administering to said subject a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of one or more anti-inflammatory agents. The invention also provides methods for preventing, treating, or managing one or more symptoms associated with an autoimmune disease further comprising, administering to said subject a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of one or more immunomodulatory agents.

described herein in Section 2.2.2, some autoimmune disorders are associated with an<br>
inflammatory condition. Thus, there is overlap between what is considered an autoimmune<br>
disorder and an inflammatory disorder. Therefore, some autoimmune disorders may also be<br>
characterized as inflammatory disorders. Examples of inflammatory disorders which can be<br>
prevented, treated or managed in accordance with the methods of the invention include, but<br>
are not limited to, asthma, encephilitis, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic obstructive<br>
pulmonary disease (COPD), allergic disorders, septic shock, pulmonary fibrosis,<br>

certain embodiments, the molecules of the invention are toxic to the infectious agent,<br>
enhance immune response against said agent or enhance effector function against said<br>

5.6.4    DETOXIFICATION<br>
[00286]	The invention also encompasses methods of detoxification in a subject<br>
exposed to a toxin (e.g., a toxic drug molecule) comprising administering a therapeutically or prophylatically effective amount of one or more molecules of the invention comprising at least one epitope binding domain specific for the toxic drug molecule. In certain embodiments, binding of a molecule of the invention to the toxin reduces or eliminates the adverse physiological effect of said toxin. In yet other embodiments, binding of a diabody of the invention to the toxin increases or enhances elimination, degradation or neutralization of the toxin relative to elimination, degradation or neutralization in the absence of said diabody. Immunotoxicothcrapy in accordance with the methods of the invention can be used to treat overdoses or exposure to drugs including, but not limited to, digixin, PCP, cocaine, colchicine, and tricyclic antideprcssants.<br>
5.7      COMBINATION THERAPY<br>
[00287]	The invention further encompasses administering the molecules of the<br>
invention in combination with other therapies known to those skilled in the ait for the treatment or prevention of cancer, autoimmune disease, infectious disease or intoxication,<br>
including but not limited to, current standard and experimental chemotherapies, hormonal<br>
therapies, biological therapies, immunotherapies, radiation therapies, or surgery, hi some<br>
embodiments, the molecules of the invention may be administered in combination with a<br>
therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of one or more agents, therapeutic<br>
antibodies or other agents known to those skilled in the art for the treatment and/or<br>
prevention of cancer, autoimmune disease, infectious disease or intoxication.<br>
[00288]	In certain embodiments, one or more molecule of the invention is<br>
administered to a mammal, preferably a human, concurrently with one or more other therapeutic agents useful for the treatment of cancer. The term "concurrently" is not limited to the administration of prophylactic or therapeutic agents at exactly the same tune, but rather it is meant that a molecule of the invention and the other agent are administered to a mammal in a sequence and within a time interval such that the molecule of the invention can act together with the other agent to provide an increased benefit than if they were administered otherwise. For example, each prophylactic or therapeutic agent (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy or biological therapy) may be administered at the same time or sequentially in any order at different points in tune; however, if not administered at the same time, they should be administered sufficiently close in time so as to provide the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Each therapeutic agent can be administered separately, in any appropriate form and by any suitable route, hi various embodiments, the prophylactic or therapeutic agents are administered less than 1 hour apart, at about 1 hour apart, at about 1 hour to about 2 hours apart, at about 2 hours to about 3 hours apart, at about 3 hours to about 4 hours apart, at about 4 hours to about 5 hours apart, at about 5 hours to about 6 hours apart, at about 6 hours to about 7 hours apart, at about 7 hours to about 8 hours apart, at about 8 hours to about 9 hours apart, at about 9 hours to about 10 hours apart, at about 10 hours to about 11 hours apart, at about 11 hours to about 12 hours apart, no more than 24 hours apart or no more than 48 hours apart. In preferred embodiments, two or more components are administered within the same patient visit.<br>
[00289]	hi other embodiments, the prophylactic or therapeutic agents are<br>
administered at about 2 to 4 days apart, at about 4 to 6 days apart, at about 1 week part, at about 1 to 2 weeks apart, or more than 2 weeks apart. In preferred embodiments, the prophylactic or therapeutic agents are administered in a time frame where both agents are still active. One skilled in the art would be able to determine such a tune frame by determining the half life of the administered agents.<br>
[00290]	In certain embodiments, the prophylactic or therapeutic agents of the<br>
invention are cyclically administered to a subject. Cycling therapy involves the administration of a first agent for a period of time, followed by the administration of a second agent and/or third agent for a period of time and repeating this sequential administration. Cycling therapy can reduce the development of resistance to one or more of the therapies, avoid or reduce the side effects of one of the therapies, and/or improves the efficacy of the treatment.<br>
[00291]	In certain embodiments, prophylactic or therapeutic agents are administered<br>
in a cycle of less than about 3 weeks, about once every two weeks, about once every 10 days or about once every week. One cycle can comprise the administration of a therapeutic or prophylactic agent by infusion over about 90 minutes every cycle, about 1 hour every cycle, about 45 minutes every cycle. Each cycle can comprise at least 1 week of rest, at least 2 weeks of rest, at least 3 weeks of rest. The number of cycles administered is from about 1 to about 12 cycles, more typically from about 2 to about 10 cycles, and more typically from about 2 to about 8 cycles.<br>
[00292]	In yet other embodiments, the therapeutic and prophylactic agents of the<br>
invention are administered in metronomic dosing regimens, either by continuous infusion or<br>
frequent administration without extended rest periods. Such metronomic administration can<br>
involve dosing at constant intervals without rest periods. Typically die therapeutic agents,<br>
in particular cytotoxic agents, are used at lower doses. Such dosing regimens encompass<br>
the chronic daily administration of relatively low doses for extended periods of time. In<br>
preferred embodiments, the use of lower doses can minimize toxic side effects and<br>
eliminate rest periods. In certain embodiments, the therapeutic and prophylactic agents are<br>
delivered by chronic low-dose or continuous infusion ranging from about 24 hours to about<br>
2 days, to about 1 week, to about 2 weeks, to about 3 weeks to about 1 month to about 2<br>
months, to about 3 months, to about 4 months, to about 5 months, to about 6 months. The<br>
scheduling of such dose regimens can be optimized by the skilled oncologist.<br>
[00293]	In other embodiments, courses of treatment are administered concurrently to<br>
a mammal, i.e., individual doses of the therapeutics are administered separately yet within a tune interval such that molecules of the invention can work together with the other agent or agents. For example, one component may be administered one time per week in combination with the other components that may be administered one time every two weeks or one time every three weeks. In other words, the dosing regimens for the therapeutics are carried out concurrently even if the therapeutics are not administered simultaneously or within the same patient visit.<br>
When used in combination with other prophylactic and/or therapeutic agents, the molecules of the invention and the prophylactic and/or therapeutic agent can act additively or, more preferably, synergistically. In one embodiment, a molecule of the invention is administered concurrently with one or more therapeutic agents in the same pharmaceutical composition. In another embodiment, a molecule of the invention is administered concurrently with one or more other therapeutic agents in separate pharmaceutical compositions. In still another embodiment, a molecule of the invention is administered prior to or subsequent to administration of another prophylactic or therapeutic agent. The invention contemplates administration of a molecule of the invention in combination with other prophylactic or therapeutic agents by the same or different routes of administration, e.g., oral and parenteral. In certain embodiments, when a molecule of the invention is administered concurrently with another prophylactic or therapeutic agent that potentially produces adverse side effects including, but not limited to, toxicity, the prophylactic or therapeutic agent can advantageously be administered at a dose that falls below the threshold that the adverse side effect is elicited.<br>
[00295]	The dosage amounts and frequencies of administration provided herein are<br>
encompassed by the terms therapeutically effective and prophylactically effective. The dosage and frequency further will typically vary according to factors specific for each patient depending on the specific therapeutic or prophylactic agents administered, the severity and type of cancer, the route of administration, as well as age, body weight, response, and the past medical history of the patient. Suitable regimens can be selected by one skilled in the art by considering such factors and by following, for example, dosages reported in the literature and recommended in the Physician's Desk Reference (56th ed., 2002).<br>

5.8      VACCINE THERAPY<br>
[00305]	The invention further encompasses using a composition of the invention to<br>
induce an immune response against an antigenic or immunogenic agent, including but not limited to cancer antigens and infectious disease antigens (examples of which are disclosed infra). The vaccine compositions of the invention comprise one or more antigenic or immunogenic agents to which an immune response is desired, wherein the one or more antigenic or immunogenic agents is coated with a variant antibody of the invention that has<br>
an enhanced affinity to FcyRIILA.. The vaccine compositions of the invention arc particularly effective in eliciting an immune response, preferably a protective immune response against the antigenic or immunogenic agent.<br>
[00306]	In some embodiments, the antigenic or immunogenic agent in the vaccine<br>
compositions of the invention comprise a virus against which an immune response is desired. The viruses may be recombinant or chimeric, and are preferably attenuated, Production of recombinant, chimeric, and attenuated viruses may be performed using standard methods known to one skilled in the art. The invention encompasses a live recombinant viral vaccine or an inactivated recombinant viral vaccine to be formulated in accordance with the invention. A live vaccine may be preferred because multiplication in the host leads to a prolonged stimulus of similar kind and magnitude to that occurring in natural infections, and therefore, confers substantial, long-lasting immunity. Production of such live recombinant virus vaccine formulations may be accomplished using conventional methods involving propagation of the virus in cell culture or in the allantois of the chick embryo followed by purification.<br>
[00307]	In a specific embodiment, the recombinant virus is non-pathogenic to the<br>
subject to which it is administered. In this regard, the use of genetically engineered viruses<br>
for vaccine purposes may require the presence of attenuation characteristics in these strains.<br>
The introduction of appropriate mutations (e.g., deletions) into the templates used for<br>
transfection may provide the novel viruses with attenuation characteristics. For example,<br>
specific missense mutations which are associated with temperature sensitivity or cold<br>
adaptation can be made into deletion mutations. These mutations should be more stable<br>
than the point mutations associated with cold or temperature sensitive mutants and reversion<br>
frequencies should be extremely low. Recombinant DNA technologies for engineering<br>
recombinant viruses are known in the art and encompassed in the invention. For example,<br>
techniques for modifying negative strand RNA viruses are known hi the art, see, e.g., U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,166,057, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
[00308]	Alternatively, chimeric viruses with "suicide" characteristics may be<br>
constructed for use in the intradermal vaccine formulations of the invention. Such viruses would go through only one or a few rounds of replication within the host. When used as a vaccine, the recombinant virus would go through limited replication cycle(s) and induce a sufficient level of immune response but it would not go further in the human host and cause disease. Alternatively, inactivated (killed) virus may be formulated in accordance with the invention. Inactivated vaccine formulations may be prepared using conventional techniques to "kill" the chimeric viruses. Inactivated vaccines are "dead" in the sense that their<br>
infectivity has been destroyed. Ideally, the infectivity of the virus is destroyed without<br>
affecting its immunogenicity. In order to prepare inactivated vaccines, the chimeric virus<br>
may be grown in cell culture or in the allantois of the chick embryo, purified by zonal<br>
ultracentrifugation, inactivated by formaldehyde or p-propiolactone, and pooled.<br>
[00309]	In certain embodiments, completely foreign epitopes, including antigens<br>
derived from other viral or non-viral pathogens can be engineered into the virus for use in<br>
the intradermal vaccine formulations of the invention. For example, antigens of non-related<br>
viruses such as HIV (gp!60, gp!20, gp41) parasite antigens (e.g., malaria), bacterial or<br>
fungal antigens or tumor antigens can be engineered into the attenuated strain.<br>
[00310]	Virtually any heterologous gene sequence may be constructed into the<br>
chimeric viruses of the invention for use in the intradermal vaccine formulations.<br>
Preferably, heterologous gene sequences are moieties and peptides that act as biological<br>
response modifiers. Preferably, epitopes that induce a protective immune response to any of<br>
a variety of pathogens, or antigens that bind neutralizing antibodies may be expressed by or<br>
as part of the chimeric viruses. For example, heterologous gene sequences that can be<br>
constructed into the chimeric viruses of the invention include, but are not limited to,<br>
influenza and parainfluenza hemagglutinin neuraminidase and fusion glycoproteins such as<br>
the HN and F genes of human PIV3. In yet another embodiment, heterologous gene<br>
sequences that can be engineered into the chimeric viruses include those that encode<br>
proteins with immuno-modulating activities. Examples of immuno-modulating proteins<br>
include, but are not limited to, cytokines, interferon type 1, gamma interferon, colony<br>
stimulating factors, interleukin -1, -2, -4, -5, -6, -12, and antagonists of these agents.<br>
[00311]	In yet other embodiments, the invention encompasses pathogenic cells or<br>
viruses, preferably attenuated viruses, which express the variant antibody on their surface.<br>
[00312]	In alternative embodiments, the vaccine compositions of the invention<br>
comprise a fusion polypeptide wherein an antigenic or immunogenic agent is operau'vely linked to a variant antibody of the invention that has an enhanced affinity for FcyRUIA. Engineering fusion polypeptides for use in the vaccine compositions of the invention is performed using routine recombinant DNA technology methods and is within the level of ordinary skill.<br>
[00313]	The invention further encompasses methods to induce tolerance in a subject<br>
by administering a composition of the invention. Preferably a composition suitable for inducing tolerance in a subject, comprises an antigenic or immunogenic agent coated with a variant antibody of the invention, wherein the variant antibody has a higher affinity to FcyRIIB. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, such<br>
compositions are effective in inducing tolerance by activating the FcyRIIB mediatated inhibitory pathway.<br>
S.9      COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS OF ADMINISTERING<br>
[00314]	The invention provides methods and pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising molecules of the invention (i.e., diabodies) comprising multiple epitopc binding domains and, optionally, an Fc domain (or portion thereof). The invention also provides methods of treatment, prophylaxis, and amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with a disease, disorder or infection by administering to a subject an effective amount of a fusion protein or a conjugated molecule of the invention, or a pharmaceutical composition comprising a fusion protein or a conjugated molecule of the invention.

The compositions may be administered by any convenient route, for example, by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.} and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local. In addition, pulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 6,019,968; 5,985, 320; 5,985,309; 5,934,272; 5,874,064; 5,855,913; 5,290,540; and 4,880,078; and PCT Publication Nos. WO 92/19244; WO 97/32572; WO 97/44013;<br>
WO 98/31346; and WO 99/66903, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
[00316]	The invention also provides that the molecules of the invention, are packaged<br>
in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of antibody. In one embodiment, the molecules of the invention are supplied as a dry sterilized lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container and can be reconstituted, e.g., with water or saline to the appropriate concentration for administration to a subject. Preferably, the molecules of the invention are supplied as a dry sterile lyophilized powder in a hermetically sealed container at a unit dosage of at least 5 mg, more preferably at least 10 mg, at least 15 mg, at least 25 mg, at least 35 mg, at least 45 mg, at least 50 mg, or at least 75 mg. The lyophilized molecules of the invention should be stored at between 2 and 8°C in their original container and the molecules should be administered within 12 hours, preferably within 6 hours, within 5 hours, within 3 hours, or within 1 hour after being reconstituted, hi an alternative embodiment, molecules of the invention are supplied in liquid form in a hermetically sealed container indicating the quantity and concentration of the molecule, fusion protein, or conjugated molecule. Preferably, the liquid form of the molecules of the invention are supplied in a hermetically sealed container at least 1 mg/ml, more preferably at least 2.5 mg/ml, at least 5 mg/ml, at least 8 mg/ml, at least 10 mg/ml, at least 15 mg/kg, at least 25 mg/ml, at least 50 mg/ml, at least 100 mg/ml, at least 150 mg/ml, at least 200 mg/ml of the molecules.<br>
[00317]	The amount of the composition of the invention which will be effective in<br>
the treatment, prevention or amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with a<br>
disorder can be determined by standard clinical techniques. The precise dose to be<br>
employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration,'and the<br>
seriousness of the condition, and should be decided according to the judgment of the<br>
practitioner and each patient's circumstances. Effective doses may be extrapolated from<br>
dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.<br>
[00318]	For diabodies encompassed by the invention, the dosage administered to a<br>
patient is typically 0.0001 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg of the patient's body weight. Preferably, the dosage administered to a patient is between 0.0001 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, 0.0001 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, 0.0001 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, 0.0001 and 2 mg/kg, 0.0001 and 1 mg/kg, 0.0001 mg/kg and 0.75 mg/kg, 0.0001 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg, 0.0001 mg/kg to 0.25 mg/kg, 0.0001 to 0.15 mg/kg, 0.0001 to 0.10 mg/kg, 0.001 to 0.5 mg/kg, 0.01 to 0.25 mg/kg or 0.01 to 0.10 mg/kg of the patient's body weight. The dosage and frequency of administration of<br>
diabodies of the invention may be reduced or altered by enhancing uptake and tissue<br>
penetration of the diabodies by modifications such as, for example, lipidation.<br>
[00319]	In one embodiment, the dosage of the molecules of the invention<br>
administered to a patient are O.Olmg to lOOOmg/day, when used as single agent therapy. In another embodiment the molecules of the invention are used in combination with other therapeutic compositions and the dosage administered to a patient are lower than when said molecules are used as a single agent therapy.<br>
[00320]	In a specific embodiment, it may be desirable to administer the<br>
pharmaceutical compositions of the invention locally to the area in need of treatment; this may be achieved by, for example; and not by way of limitation, local infusion, by injection, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers. Preferably, when administering a molecule of the invention, care must be taken to use materials to which the molecule does not absorb.<br>
[00321]	In another embodiment, the compositions can be delivered in a vesicle, in<br>
particular a liposome (See Langer, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990); Treat et al, in Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer. Lopez-Bercstein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, New York, pp. 353- 365 (1989); Lopez-Berestein, ibid., pp. 3 17-327; see generally ibid.).<br>
[00322]	In yet another embodiment, the compositions can be delivered in a controlled<br>
release or sustained release system. Any technique known to one of skill in the art can be used to produce sustained release formulations comprising one or more molecules of the invention. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,526,938; PCT publication WO 91/05548; PCT publication WO 96/20698; Ning et al., 1996, "Intratumoral Radioimmunotheraphy of a Human Colon Cancer Xenograft Using a Sustained-Release Gel," Radiotherapy &amp; Oncology 39:179-189, Song et al., 1995, "Antibody Mediated Lung Targeting of Long-Circulating Emulsions," PDA Journal of Pharmaceutical Science &amp; Technology 50:372-397; Cleek et al, 1997, "Biodegradable Polymeric Carriers for a bFGF Antibody for Cardiovascular Application," Pro. Int'l. Symp. Control. Rel. Bioact. Mater. 24:853-854; and Lam et al, 1997, "Microencapsulation of Rccombinant Humanized Monoclonal Antibody for Local Delivery," Proc. Int'l Symp. Control Rel Bioact. Mater. 24:759-760, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In one embodiment, a pump may be used in a controlled release system (See Langer, supra; Sefton, 1987, CRC Grit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:20; Buchwald et al, 1980, Surgery 88:507; and Saudek et al., 1989, N. Engl J. Med. 321:574). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used to achieve<br>
controlled release of antibodies (see e.g., Medical Applications of Controlled Release.<br>
Longer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Florida (1974); Controlled Drug<br>
Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance, Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, New<br>
York (1984); Ranger and Peppas, 1983, J., Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol Chem. 23:61;<br>
See also Levy et al, 1985, Science 228:190; During et al, 1989, Ann. Neurol. 25:351;<br>
Howard etal, 1989, J. Newosurg. 1 1:105); U.S. Patent No. 5,679,377; U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,916,597; U.S. Patent No. 5,912,015; U.S. Patent No. 5,989,463; U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,128,326; PCT Publication No. WO 99/15154; and PCT Publication No. WO 99/20253).<br>
Examples of polymers used in sustained release formulations include, but are not limited to,<br>
poly(2-hydroxy ethyl methacrylate), poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(acrylic acid),<br>
poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate), poly(methacrylic acid), polyglycolides (PLG),<br>
polyanhydrides, poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone), poly(vinyl alcohol), polyacrylamide,<br>
poly(ethylene glycol), polylactides (PLA), poly(lactide-co-glycolides) (PLGA), and<br>
polyorthoesters. In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in<br>
proximity of the therapeutic target (e.g., the lungs), thus requiring only a fraction of the<br>
systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra,<br>
vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984)). In another embodiment, polymeric compositions useful as<br>
controlled release implants are used according to Dunn et al. (See U.S. 5,945,155). This<br>
particular method is based upon the therapeutic effect of the in situ controlled release of the<br>
bioactive material from the polymer system. The implantation can generally occur<br>
anywhere within the body of the patient in need of therapeutic treatment. In another<br>
embodiment, a non-polymeric sustained delivery system is used, whereby a non-polymeric<br>
implant in the body of the subject is used as a drug delivery system. Upon implantation in<br>
the body, the organic solvent of the implant will dissipate, disperse, or leach from the<br>
composition into surrounding tissue fluid, and the non-polymeric material will gradually<br>
coagulate or precipitate to form a solid, microporous matrix (See U.S. 5,888,533).<br>
[00323]	Controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer (1990,<br>
Science 249:1527-1533). Any technique known to one of skill in the art can be used to produce sustained release formulations comprising one or more therapeutic agents of the invention. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,526,938; International Publication Nos. WO 91/05548 and WO 96/20698; Ning et al, 1996, Radiotherapy &amp; Oncology 39:179-189; Song etal, 1995, PDA Journal of Pharmaceutical Science &amp; Technology 50:372-397; Cleek et al., 1997, Pro. Int'l. Symp. Control. Rel. Bioact. Mater. 24:853-854; and Lam et al., 1997, Proc. Int'l. Symp. Control Rel. Bioact. Mater. 24:759-760, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
[00324]	In a specific embodiment where the composition, of the invention is a nucleic<br>
acid encoding a diabody of the invention, the nucleic acid can be administered in vivo to promote expression of its encoded diabody, by constructing it as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that it becomes intracellular, e.g., by use of a retroviral vector (See U.S. Patent No. 4,980,286), or by direct injection, or by use of microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun; Biolistic, Dupont), or coating with lipids or cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, or by administering it in linkage to a homeobox-like peptide which is known to enter the nucleus (See e.g., Joliot et al, 1991, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 88:1864-1868), etc., Alternatively, a nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression by homologous recombination.<br>
[00325]	Treatment of a subject with a therapeutically or prophylactically effective<br>
amount of molecules of the invention can include a single treatment or, preferably, can include a series of treatments. In a preferred example, a subject is treated with molecules of the invention in the range of between about 0.1 to 30 mg/kg body weight, one time per week for between about 1 to 10 weeks, preferably between 2 to 8 weeks, more preferably between about 3 to 7 weeks, and even more preferably for about 4, 5, or 6 weeks. In other embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are administered once a day, twice a day, or three times a day. In other embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered once a week, twice a week, once every two weeks, once a month, once every six weeks, once every two months, twice a year or once per year. It will also be appreciated that the effective dosage of the molecules used for treatment may increase or decrease over the course of a particular treatment.<br>

[00334]	In a preferred aspect, a composition of the invention comprises nucleic acids<br>
encoding a diabody of the invention, said nucleic acids being part of an expression vector that expresses the antibody in a suitable host. In particular, such nucleic acids have promoters, preferably heterologous promoters, operably linked to the antibody coding region, said promoter being inducible or constitutive, and, optionally, tissue-specific. In another particular embodiment, nucleic acid molecules are used in which the antibody coding sequences and any other desired sequences are flanked by regions that promote homologous recombination at a desired site in the genome, thus providing for intrachromosomal expression of the antibody encoding nucleic acids (Koller and Smithies, 1989, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 86:8932-8935; and Zijlstra et al, 1989, Nature 342:435-438).<br>
[00335]	In another preferred aspect, a composition of the invention comprises nucleic<br>
acids encoding a fusion protein, said nucleic acids being a part of an expression vector that expresses the fusion protein in a suitable host. In particular, such nucleic acids have promoters, preferably heterologous promoters, operably linked to the coding region of a fusion protein, said promoter being inducible or constitutive, and optionally, tissue-specific. In another particular embodiment, nucleic acid molecules are used in which the coding sequence of the fusion protein and any other desired sequences are flanked by regions that<br>
promote homologous recombination at a desired site in the genome, thus providing for intrachromosomal expression of the fusion protein.<br>
[00336]	Delivery of the nucleic acids into a subject may be either direct, in which<br>
case the subject is directly exposed to the nucleic acid or nucleic acid-carrying vectors, or indirect, in which case, cells are first transformed with the nucleic acids in vitro, then transplanted into the subject. These two approaches are known, respectively, as in vivo or ex vivo gene therapy.<br>
[00337]	In a specific embodiment, the nucleic acid sequences are directly<br>
administered in vivo, where it is expressed to produce the encoded product. This can be<br>
accomplished by any of numerous methods known in the art, e.g., by constructing them as<br>
part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that they<br>
become intracellular, e.g., by infection using defective or attenuated retroviral or other viral<br>
vectors (see U.S. Patent No. 4,980,286), or by direct injection of naked DNA, or by use of<br>
microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun; Biolistic, Dupont), or coating with lipids or<br>
cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, or<br>
microcapsules, or by administering them in linkage to a peptide which is known to enter the<br>
nucleus, by administering it in linkage to a an antigen subject to receptor-mediated<br>
endocytosis (See, e.g., Wu and Wu, 1987, J. Biol. Chem. 262:4429-4432) (which can be<br>
used to target cell types specifically expressing the receptors), etc. In another embodiment,<br>
nucleic acid-an antigen complexes can be formed in which the an antigen comprises a<br>
fusogenic viral peptide to disrupt endosomes, allowing the nucleic acid to avoid lysosomal<br>
degradation. In yet another embodiment, the nucleic acid can be targeted in vivo for cell<br>
specific uptake and expression, by targeting a specific receptor (See, e.g., PCT Publications<br>
WO 92/06180; WO 92/22635; W092/20316; W093/14188; WO 93/20221). Alternatively,<br>
the nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for<br>
expression, by homologous recombination (Koller and Smithies, 1989, Proc. Natl. Acad.<br>
Sci. USA 86:8932-8935; and Zijlstra et al, 1989, Nature 342:435-438).<br>
[00338]	In a specific embodiment, viral vectors that contain nucleic acid sequences<br>
encoding a molecule of the invention (e.g., a diabody or a fusion protein) are used. For example, a retroviral vector can be used (See Miller et al., 1993, Meth. Enzymol. 217:581-599). These retroviral vectors contain the components necessary for the correct packaging of the viral genome and integration into the host cell DNA. The nucleic acid sequences encoding the antibody or a fusion protein to be used in gene therapy are cloned into one or more vectors, which facilitates delivery of the nucleotide sequence into a subject. More detail about retroviral vectors can be found in Boesen et al, (1994, Biotherapy 6:291-302),<br>
which describes the use ot a retroviral vector to deliver the mdr 1 gene to hematopoietic stem cells in order to make the stem cells more resistant to chemotherapy. Other references illustrating the use of retroviral vectors in gene therapy are: Clowes et al., 1994, J. Clin. Invest. 93:644-651; Klein et al, 1994, Blood 83:1467-1473; Salmons and Gunzbcrg, 1993, Human Gene Therapy 4:129-141; and Grossman and Wilson, 1993, Curr. Opin, in Genetics andDevel. 3:110-114.<br>
[00339]	Adenoviruses are other viral vectors that can be used in gene therapy.<br>
Adenoviruses are especially attractive vehicles for delivering genes to respiratory epithelia. Adenoviruses naturally infect respiratory epithelia where they cause a mild disease. Other targets for adenovirus-based delivery systems are liver, the central nervous system, endothelial cells, and muscle. Adenoviruses have the advantage of being capable of infecting non-dividing cells. Kozarsky and Wilson (Current Opinion in Genetics and Development 3:499-503, 1993, present a review of adenovirus-based gene therapy. Bout et al, (Human Gene Therapy, 5:3-10, 1994) demonstrated the use of adenovirus vectors to transfer genes to the respiratory epithelia of rhesus monkeys. Other instances of the use of adenoviruses in gene therapy can be found in Rosenfeld et al, 1991, Science 252:431-434; Rosenfeld et al, 1992, Cell 68:143-155; Mastrangeli et al, 1993, J. Clin. Invest. 91:225-234; PCT Publication W094/12649; and Wang et al, 1995, Gene Therapy 2:775-783. In a preferred embodiment, adenovirus vectors are used.<br>
[00340]	Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has also been proposed for use in gene<br>
therapy (see, e.g.,Walsh et al, 1993, Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol Med. 204:289-300 and U.S. Patent No. 5,436,146).<br>
[00341]	Another approach to gene therapy involves transferring a gene to cells in<br>
tissue culture by such methods as electroporation, lipofection, calcium phosphate mediated transfection, or viral infection. Usually, the method of transfer includes the transfer of a selectable marker to the cells. The cells are then placed under selection to isolate those cells that have taken up and are expressing the transferred gene. Those cells are then delivered to a subject.<br>
[00342]	In this embodiment, the nucleic acid is introduced into a cell prior to<br>
administration in vivo of the resulting recombinant cell. Such introduction can be carried out by any method known hi the art, Including but not limited to, transfection, electroporation, microinjcction, infection with a viral or bacteriophage vector, containing the nucleic acid sequences, cell fusion, chromosome-mediated gene transfer, microcellmediated gene transfer, spheroplast fusion, etc. Numerous techniques are known in the art for the introduction of foreign genes into cells (See, e.g., Loeffler and Behr, 1993,<br>
'Methl'Enzymol. 217:599-618, Cohen et al, 1993, Meth. Enzymol. 217:618-644; and CItn. Pharma. Thei: 29:69-92,1985) and may be used in accordance with the present invention, provided that the necessary developmental and physiological functions of the recipient cells are not disrupted. The technique should provide for the stable transfer of the nucleic acid to the cell, so that the nucleic acid is expressible by the cell and preferably heritable and expressible by its cell progeny.<br>
[00343]	The resulting recombinant cells can be delivered to a subject by various<br>
methods known in the art. Recombinant blood cells (e.g., hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells) are preferably administered intravenously. The amount of cells envisioned for use depends on the desired effect, patient state, etc., and can be determined by one skilled in the art.<br>
[00344]	Cells into which a nucleic acid can be introduced for purposes of gene<br>
therapy encompass any desired, available cell type, and include but are not limited to epithelial cells, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, muscle cells, hepatocytes; blood cells such as T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, megakaryocytes, granulocytes; various stem or progenitor cells, in particular hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells, e.g., as obtained from bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood, fetal liver, etc.<br>
[00345]	In a preferred embodiment, the cell used for gene therapy is autologous to<br>
the subject.<br>
[00346]	In an embodiment in which recombinant cells are used in gene therapy,<br>
nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody or a fusion protein are introduced into the cells such that they are expressible by the cells or their progeny, and'the recombinant cells are then administered in vivo for therapeutic effect. In a specific embodiment, stem or progenitor cells are used. Any stem and/or progenitor cells which can be isolated and maintained in vitro can potentially be used in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention (See e.g., PCT Publication WO 94/08598; Stemple and Anderson, 1992, Cell! 1:973-985; Rheinwald, 1980, Meth. Cell Bio. 21A:229; and Pittelkow and Scott, 1986, Afoyo Clinic Proc. 61:771).<br>
[00347]	In a specific embodiment, the nucleic acid to be introduced for purposes of<br>
gene therapy comprises an inducible promoter operably linked to the coding region, such that expression of the nucleic acid is controllable by controlling the presence or absence of the appropriate inducer of transcription.<br>
KITS<br>
[00348]	The invention provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more<br>
containers filled with the molecules of the invention. Additionally, one or more other<br>
prophylactic or therapeutic agents useful for the treatment of a disease can also be included<br>
in the pharmaceutical pack or Icit. The invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit<br>
comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the<br>
pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Optionally associated with such container(s)<br>
can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the<br>
manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products, which notice reflects<br>
approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale for human administration.<br>
[00349]	The present invention provides kits that can be used in the above methods.<br>
In one embodiment, a kit comprises one or more molecules of the invention. In another embodiment, a kit further comprises one or more other prophylactic or therapeutic agents useful for the treatment of cancer, in one or more containers. In another embodiment, a Icit further comprises one or more cytotoxic antibodies that bind one or more cancer antigens associated with cancer. In certain embodiments, the other prophylactic or therapeutic agent is a chemotherapeutic. In other embodiments, the prophylactic or therapeutic agent is a biological or hormonal therapeutic.<br>
5.10     CHARACTERIZATION AND DEMONSTRATION OF THERAPEUTIC UTILITY<br>
[00350]	Several aspects of the pharmaceutical compositions, prophylactic, or<br>
therapeutic agents of the invention are preferably tested in vitro, in a cell culture system,<br>
and in an animal model organism, such as a rodent animal model system, for the desired<br>
therapeutic activity prior to use in humans. For example, assays which can be used to<br>
determine whether administration of a specific pharmaceutical composition is desired,<br>
include cell culture assays in which a patient tissue sample is grown in culture, and exposed<br>
to or otherwise contacted with a pharmaceutical composition of the invention, and the effect<br>
of such composition upon the tissue sample is observed. The tissue sample can be obtained<br>
by biopsy from the patient. This test allows the identification of the therapeutically most<br>
effective prophylactic or therapeutic molecule(s) for each individual patient. In various<br>
specific embodiments, in vitro assays can be carried out with representative cells of cell<br>
types involved in an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder (e.g., T cells), to determine if a<br>
pharmaceutical composition of the invention has a desired effect upon such cell types.<br>
[00351]	Combinations of prophylactic and/or therapeutic agents can be tested in<br>
suitable animal model systems prior to use in humans. Such animal model systems include,<br>
but are not limited to, rats, mice, chicken, cows, monkeys, pigs, dogs, rabbits, etc. Any animal system well-known in the art may be used. In a specific embodiment of the invention, combinations of prophylactic and/or therapeutic agents are tested in a mouse model system. Such model systems are widely used and well-known to the skilled artisan. Prophylactic and/or therapeutic agents can be administered repeatedly. Several aspects of the procedure may vary. Said aspects include the temporal regime of administering the prophylactic and/or therapeutic agents, and whether such agents are administered separately or as an admixture.<br>
[00352]	Preferred animal models for use in the methods of the invention are, for<br>
example, transgenic mice expressing human FcyRs on mouse effector cells, e.g., any mouse model described in U.S. 5,877,396 (which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) can be used in the present invention. Transgenic mice for use in the methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, mice carrying human FcyRIIIA; mice carrying human FcyRIIA; mice carrying human FcyRIIB and human FcyRIIIA; mice carrying human FcyRIIB and human FcyRIIA. Preferably, mutations showing the highest levels of activity in the functional assays described above will be tested for use in animal model studies prior to use in humans. Sufficient quantities of antibodies may be prepared for use in animal models using methods described supra, for example using mammalian expression systems and purification methods disclosed and exemplified herein.<br>
[00353]	Mouse xenograft models may be used for examining efficacy of mouse<br>
antibodies generated against a tumor specific target based on the affinity and specificity of the epitope bing domains of the diabody molecule of the invention and the ability of the diabody to elicit an immune response (Wu et al., 2001, Trends Cell Biol. 11: S2-9). Transgenic mice expressing human FcyRs on mouse effector cells are unique and are tailor-made animal models to test the efficacy of human Fc-FcyR interactions. Pairs of FcyRIIIA, FcyRIIIB and FcyRIIA transgenic mouse lines generated in the lab of Dr. Jeffrey Ravetch (Through a licensing agreement with Rockefeller U. and Sloan Kettering Cancer center) can be used such as those listed in the Table 11 below.<br>
Table 11: Mice Strains<br>
(Table 11 Removed) <br>
[00354]	The anti-inflammatory activity of the combination therapies of invention can<br>
be determined by using various experimental animal models of inflammatory arthritis known in the art and described in Crofford L.J. and Wilder R.L., "Arthritis and Autoimmunjty in Animals", in Arthritis and Allied Conditions: A Textbook of Rheumatology, McCarty et a/.(eds.), Chapter 30 (Lee and Febiger, 1993). Experimental and spontaneous animal models of inflammatory arthritis and autoimmune rheumatic diseases can also be used to assess the and-inflammatory activity of the combination therapies of invention. The following are some assays provided as examples, and not by limitation.<br>
[00355]	The principle animal models for arthritis or inflammatory disease known in<br>
the art and widely used include: adjuvant-induced arthritis rat models, collagen-induced<br>
arthritis rat and mouse models and antigen-induced arthritis rat, rabbit and hamster models,<br>
all described in Crofford L.J. and Wilder R.L., "Arthritis and Autoimmunity in Animals",<br>
in Arthritis and Allied Conditions: A Textbook of Rheumatology, McCarty et «/.(eds.),<br>
Chapter 30 (Lee and Febiger, 1993), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
[00356]	The anti-inflammatory activity of the combination therapies of invention can<br>
be assessed using a carrageenan-induced arthritis rat model. Carrageenan-induccd arthritis has also been used in rabbit, dog and pig in studies of chronic arthritis or inflammation. Quantitative histomorphometric assessment is used to determine therapeutic efficacy. The methods for using such a carrageenan-induced arthritis model is described in Hansra P. et al, "Carrageenan-induced Arthritis in the Rat," Inflammation, 24(2): 141-155, (2000). Also commonly used are zymosan-induced inflammation animal models as known and described in the art.<br>
[00357]	The anti-inflammatory activity of the combination therapies of invention can<br>
also be assessed by measuring the inhibition of carrageenan-induced paw edema in the rat, using a modification of the method described in Winter C. A. et al, "Carrageenan-induced Edema in Hind Paw of the Rat as an Assay for Anti-inflammatory Drugs" Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol Med. Ill, 544-547, (1962). This assay has been used as a primary in vivo screen for the anti-inflammatory activity of mostNSAIDs, and is considered predictive of human efficacy. The anti-inflammatory activity of the test prophylactic or therapeutic agents is expressed as the percent inhibition of the increase in hind paw weight of the test group relative to the vehicle dosed control group.<br>
[00358]	Additionally, animal models for inflammatory bowel disease can also be<br>
used to assess the efficacy of the combination therapies of invention (Kim et al,, 1992,<br>
Scand. J. Gastroentrol. 27:529-537; Strober, 1985, Dig. Dis. Sci. 30(12 Suppl):3S-10S). Ulcerative cholitis and Crohn's disease are human inflammatory bowel diseases that can be induced hi animals. Sulfated polysaccharides including, but not limited to amylopectin, carrageen, amylopectin sulfate, and dextran sulfate or chemical irritants including but not limited to trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS) and acetic acid can be administered to animals orally to induce inflammatory bowel diseases.<br>
[00359]	Animal models for autoimmune disorders can also be used to assess the<br>
efficacy of the combination therapies of invention. Animal models for autoimmune<br>
disorders such as type 1 diabetes, thyroid autoimmunity, systemic lupus eruthematosus, and<br>
glomerulonephritis have been developed (Flanders et al, 1999, Autoimmunity 29:235-246;<br>
Kroghera/., 1999, Btochimie 81:511-515; Foster, 1999, Semin. Nephrol. 19:12-24).<br>
[00360]	Further, any assays known to those skilled in the art can be used to evaluate<br>
the prophylactic and/or therapeutic utility of the combinatorial therapies disclosed herein for autoimmune and/or inflammatory diseases.<br>
[00361]	Toxicity and efficacy of the prophylactic and/or therapeutic protocols of the<br>
instant invention can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LDso (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the EDso (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LDso/EDso. Prophylactic and/or therapeutic agents that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While prophylactic and/or therapeutic agents that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such agents to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.<br>
[00362]	The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used<br>
in formulating a range of dosage of the prophylactic and/or therapeutic agents for use in humans. The dosage of such agents lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the EDso with little or no toxiciry. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any agent used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the ICso (i.e., the concentration of the test compound that achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately<br>
determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, lor example, by high performance liquid chromatography.<br>
[00363]	The anti-cancer activity of the therapies used in accordance with the present<br>
invention also can be determined by using various experimental animal models for the study of cancer such as the SCID mouse model or transgenic mice or nude mice with human xenografts, animal models, such as hamsters, rabbits, etc. known in the art and described in Relevance of Tumor Models for Anticancer Drug Development (1999, eds. Fiebig and Burger); Contributions to Oncology (1999, Karger); The Nude Mouse in Oncology Research (1991, eds, Boven and Winograd); and Anticancer Drug Development Guide (1997 ed. Teicher), herein incorporated by reference in their entireties,<br>
[00364]	Preferred animal models for determining the therapeutic efficacy of the<br>
molecules of the invention are mouse xenograft models. Tumor cell lines that can be used as a source for xenograft tumors include but are not limited to, SKBR3 and MCF7 cells, which can be derived from patients with breast adenocarcinoma. These cells have both erbB2 and prolactin receptors. SKBR3 cells have been used routinely in the art as ADCC and xenograft rumor models. Alternatively, OVCAR3 cells derived from a human ovarian adenocarcinoma can be used as a source for xenograft tumors.<br>
[00365]	The protocols and compositions of the invention are preferably tested in<br>
vitro, and then in vivo, for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity, prior to use in<br>
humans. Therapeutic agents and methods may be screened using cells of a tumor or<br>
malignant cell line. Many assays standard in the art can be used to assess such survival<br>
and/or growth; for example, cell proliferation can be assayed by measuring 3H-thyrm'dine<br>
incorporation, by direct cell count, by detecting changes in transcriptional activity of known<br>
genes such as proto-oncogenes (e.g., fos, myc) or cell cycle markers; cell viability can be<br>
assessed by trypan blue staining, differentiation can be assessed visually based on changes<br>
hi morphology, decreased growth and/or colony formation in soft agar or tubular network<br>
formation in three-dimensional basement membrane or extracellular matrix preparation, etc.<br>
[00366]	Compounds for use in therapy can be tested in suitable animal model<br>
systems prior to testing in humans, including but not limited to in rats, mice, chicken, cows, monkeys, rabbits, hamsters, etc., for example, the animal models described above. The compounds can then be used in the appropriate clinical trials.<br>
[00367]	Further, any assays known to those skilled in the art can be used to evaluate<br>
the prophylactic and/or therapeutic utility of the combinatorial therapies disclosed herein for treatment or prevention of cancer, inflammatory disorder, or autoimmune disease.<br>
6.        EXAMPLES<br>
6.1      DESIGN AND CHARACTERIZATION OF COVALENT BISPECIFIC DIABODIES<br>
[00368]	A monospecific covalent diabody and a bispecific covalent diabody were<br>
constructed to asses the recombinant production, purification and binding characteristics of each. The affinity purified diabody molecules that were produced by the recombinant expression systems described herein were found by SDS-PAGE and SEC analysis to consist of a single dimerc species.  ELISA and SPR analysis further revealed that the covalent bispecific diabody exhibited affinity for both target antigens and could bind both antigens simultaneously.<br>
[00369]	Materials and Methods;<br>
[00370]	Construction ami Design of Polypeptide Molecules: Nucleic acid expression<br>
vectors were designed to produce four polypeptide constructs, schematically represented in FIG. 2 . Construct 1 (SEQ ID N0:9) comprised the VL domain of humanized 2B6 antibody , which recognizes FcyRIIB, and the VH domain of humained 3G8 antibody, which recognizes FcyRIIIA. Construct 2 (SEQ ID NO:11) comprised the VL domain of Hu3G8 and the VH domain of Hu2B6. Construct 3 (SEQ ID NO: 12) comprised the VL domain of Hu3G8 and the VH domain of Hu3G8. Construct 4 (SEQ ID NO: 13) comprised the VL domain of Hu2B6 and the VH domain of Hu2B6.<br>
[00371]	PCR and Expression Vector Construction: The coding sequences of the VL<br>
or VH domains were amplified from template DNA using forward and reverse primers<br>
designed such that the intial PCR products would contain overlapping sequences, allowing<br>
overlapping PCR to generate the coding sequences of the desired polypeptide constructs.<br>
[00372]	Initial PCR amplification of template DNA: Approximately 35 ng of<br>
template DNA, e.g. light chain and heavy chain of antibody of interest; 1 ul of lOuM forward and reverse primers; 2.5 ul of lOx pfuUltra buffer (Stratagene, Inc.); 1 ul of 10 mM dNTP; 1 ul of 2.5 units/ul of pfuUltra DNA polymerase (Stratagene, Inc.); and distilled water to 25 ul total volume were gently mixed in a microfuge tube and briefly spun in a microcentrifuge to collect the reaction mixture at the bottom of the tube. PCR reactions were performed using GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (PE Applied Biosystem) and the following settings: 94°C, 2 minutes; 25 cycles of 94°C, each 15 seconds; 58°C, 30 seconds; and 72°C, 1 minute.<br>
[00373]	The VL of Hu2B6 was amplified from the light chain of Hu2B6 using<br>
forward and reverse primers SEQ ID NO: 57 and SEQ ID N0:58, respectively. The VH of Hu2B6 was amplified from the heavy chain of Hu2B6 using forward and reverse primers<br>
S'EQ ID NO: 59 and SEQ ID N0:60, respectively. The VL of Hu3G8 was amplified from<br>
the light chain of Hu3G8 using forward and reverse primers SEQ ID NO: 57 and SEQ ID<br>
N0:61, respectively. The VH of Hu3G8 was amplified from the heavy chain of Hu3G8<br>
using forward and reverse primers SEQ ID NO: 62 and SEQ ID N0:63, respectively.<br>
[00374]	PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel for 30 minutes at<br>
120 volts. PCR products were cut from the gel and purified using MinElute GE1 Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Inc.).<br>
[00375]	Overlapping PCR: Intitial PCR products were combined as described below<br>
and amplified using the same PCR conditions described for initial amplification of template<br>
DNA. Products of overlapping PCR were also purified as described supra.<br>
[00376]	The nucleic acid sequence encoding construct 1, SEQ ID N0:9 (shown<br>
schematically in FIG. 2), was amplified by combining the PCR products of the<br>
amplifications of VL Hu2B6 and VH Hu3G8, and forward and reverse primers SEQ ID<br>
N0:57 and SEQ ID NO:63, respectively. The nucleic acid sequence encoding construct 2,<br>
SEQ ID NO:11 (shown schematically in FIG. 2), was amplified by combining the PCR<br>
products of the amplifications of VL Hu3G8 and VH Hu2B6, and forward and reverse<br>
primers SEQ ID NO:57 and SEQ ID N0:60, respectively. The nucleic acid sequence<br>
encoding construct 3, SEQ ID N0:12 (shown schematically in FIG. 2), was amplified by<br>
combining the PCR products of the amplifications of VL Hu3G8 and VH Hu3G8, and<br>
forward and reverse primers SEQ ID N0:57 and SEQ ID NO:63, respectively. The nucleic<br>
acid sequence encoding construct 4, SEQ ID NO: 13 (shown schematically in FIG. 2), was<br>
amplified by combining the PCR products of the amplifications of VL Hu2B6 and VH<br>
Hu2B6, and forward and reverse primers SEQ ID NO:57 and SEQ ID NO:60, respectively.<br>
[00377]	The forward primers of the VL domains (i.e., SEQ ID N0:57) and reverse<br>
primers of the VH domains (i.e., SEQ ID N0:60 and SEQ ID N0:63) contained unique restriction sites to allow cloning of the final product into an expression vector. Purified overlapping PCR products were digested with restriction endonucleases Nhc I and EcoR I, and cloned into the pCIneo mammalian expression vector (Promega, Inc.). The plasmids encoding constructs were designated as identified in Table 12: Table 12.      PLASMID CONSTRUCTS<br>
<br>
(Table  Removed) <br>
[00378]         " Polypeptide/diabody Expression: pMGX0669, encoding construct i.was cotransfected with pMGX0667, encoding construct 2, in HEK-293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's directions (Invitrogen). Co-transfection of tliese two plasmids was designed to lead to the expression of a covalent bispecific diabody (CBD) immunospecific for both FcvPJIB and FcyRIIIA (the h2B6-h3G8 diabody). pMGX0666 and pMGX0668, encoding constructs 3 and 4, respectively, were separately transfected into HEK-293 cells for expression of a covalent monospecific diabody (CMD), immunospecific for FcyRIIIA (h3G8 diabody) and FcyRIIB (h2B6 diabody), respectively. Following three days in culture, secreted products were purified from the conditioned media.<br>
[00379]	Purification: Diabodies were captured from the conditioned medium using<br>
the relevant antigens coupled to CNBr activated Sepharose 4B. The affinity Sepharose resin was equilibrated in 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0 prior to loading. After loading, the resin was washed with equilibration buffer prior to elution. Diabodies were eluted from the washed resin using 50 mM Glycine pli 3.0. Eluted diabodies were immediately neutralized with 1M Tris/HCl pH 8.0 and concentrated using a centrifugation type concentrator. The concentrated diabodies were further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 column equilibrated in PBS.<br>
[00380]	SEC: Size exclusion chromatography was used to analyze the approximate<br>
size and heterogeneity of the diabodies eluted from the column. SEC analysis was performed on a GE healthcare Superdex 200HR 10/30 column equilibrated with PBS. Comparison with the elution profiles of a full length IgG (~150 kDa), an Fab fragment (~50 kDa) and a single chain Fv (-30 kDa) were used as controls).<br>
[00381]	ELISA: The binding of eluted and purified diabodies was characterized by<br>
ELISA assay, as described in 5.4.2. 50 ul/well of a 2 ug/ml solution of sCD32B-Ig was coated on 96-well Maxisorp plate in Carbonate buffer at 4°C over night. The plate was washed three times with PBS-T (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20) and blocked by 0.5% BSA hi PBS-T for 30 minutes at room temperature. Subsequently, h2B6-h3G8 CBD, h2B6 CMD, or h3GS CMD were diluted into the blocking buffer in a serial of two-fold dilutions to generate a range of diabody concentrations, from 0.5 ug/ml to 0.001 ug/ml. The plate was then incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. After washing with PBS-T three tunes, 50 ul/well of 0.2 ug/ml sCD16A-Biotin was added to each well. The plate was again incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. After washing with PBS-T three times, 50 ul/well of a 1:5000 dilution of HRP conjugated streptavidin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for detection. The HRP-streptavidin was allowed to incubate for 45 minutes at room<br>
temperature. "The plate was washed with PBS-T three times and developed using 80 ul/well<br>
of 1MB substrate. After a 10 minute incubation, the HRP-TMB reaction was stopped by<br>
adding 40 ul/well of 1% H2S04. The OD450 nm was read by using a 96-well plate reader<br>
and SOFTmax software, and results plotted using GraphPadPrism 3.03 software.<br>
[00382]	BIAcore Assay: The kinetic parameters of the binding of eluted and purified<br>
diabodies were analyzed using a BIAcore assay (BIAcore instrument 1000, BIAcore Inc.,<br>
Piscataway, NJ.) and associated software as described in section 5.4.3.<br>
[00383]	sCD16A, sCD32B or sCD32A (negative control) were immobilized on one<br>
of the four flow cells (flow cell 2) of a sensor chip surface through ainine coupling chemistry (by modification of carboxymethyl groups with mixture of NHS/EDC) such that about 1000 response units (RU) of either receptor was immobilized on the surface. Following this, the unreacted active esters were "capped off with an injection of 1M Et-NH2. Once a suitable surface was prepared, covalent bispecific diabodies (h2B6-h3G8 CBD) or covalent monospecific diabodies (h2B6 CMD or h3G8 CMB) were passed over the surface by 180 second injections of a 6.25-200nM solution at a 70 mL/min flow rate. h3G8 scFV was also tested for comparison.<br>
[00384]	Once an entire data set was collected, the resulting binding curves were<br>
globally fitted using computer algorithms supplied by the manufacturer, BIAcore, Inc.<br>
(Piscataway, NJ). These algorithms calculate both the Kon and K0ir, from which the<br>
apparent equilibrium binding constant, KD is deduced as the ratio of the two rate constants<br>
(i.e., Kog/Kon). More detailed treatments of how the individual rate constants arc derived<br>
can be found in the BIAevaluaion Software Handbook (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ).<br>
[00385]	Association and dissociation phases were fitted separately. Dissociation rate<br>
constant was obtained for interval 32-34 sec of the 180 sec dissociation phase; association<br>
phase fit was obtained by a 1:1 Langmuir model and base fit was selected on the basis Rmax<br>
and chi2 criteria for the bispecific diabodies and scFv; Bivalent analyte fit was used for<br>
CMD binding.<br>
[00386]	Results<br>
[00387]	SDS-PAGE analysis under non-reducing conditions revealed that the<br>
purified product of the h3G8 CMD, h2B6 CMD and h2B6-h3G8 CBD expression systems were each a single species with an estimated molecular weight of approximately 50 IcDa (FIG. 3, lanes 4, 5 and 6, respectively). Under reducing conditions, the product purified from either of the CMD expression systems ran as a single band (lanes 1 and 2), while the product purified from the h2B6-h3G8 CBD system was revealed to be 2 separate proteins<br>
(FIG. 3, lane 3). All polypeptides purified from the expression system and visualized by<br>
SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions migrated at approximately 28 kDa.<br>
[00388]	SEC analysis of each of the expression system products also revealed a<br>
single molecular species (FIG. 4B), each of which eluted at the same approximate time as<br>
an Fab fragment of IgG (~50kDa) (FIG. 4A). The results indicate that affinity purified<br>
product was a homogenous covalent homodimer for the case of CMD expression system<br>
and a homogenous covalent heterodimer for the case of the h2B6-h3G8 CBD.<br>
[00389]	An ELISA sandwich assay was used to test binding of the h2B6-h3G8 CBD<br>
for specificity to either or both of CD32B and/or CD16A (FIG. 5). CD32B served as the<br>
target antigen and CD16A was used as the secondary probe. The positive signal in the<br>
ELIZA revealed that the heterodimeric h2B6-h3G8 CBD had specificity for both antigens.<br>
Similar testing of the h3G8 CMD (which should not bind CD32B) showed no signal.<br>
[00390]	SPR analysis indicated that h3G8 CMD immunospecifically recognized<br>
sCD16 but not sCD32B, that h2B6 CMD immunospecifically recognized sCD32B but not sCD16, and that h2B6-h3G8 CBD immunospecifically recognized both sCD16 and sCD32B (FIGS. 6A-B). None of the diabodies tested bound the control receptor, sCD32A (FIG. 6C).<br>
[00391]	SPR analysis was also used to estimate the kinetic and equilibrium constants<br>
of the CMDs and h2B6-h3G8 CBD to sCD16 and/or sCD32B. Results were compared to the same constants calculated for an h3G8 scFV. FIGS. 7A-E show the graphical results of the SPR analysis. The kinetic on and off rates, as well as the equilibrium constant, calculated from the results depicted in FIG. 7 are provided in Table 13.<br>

(Table 13 Removed) <br>
[00392]	Coupled with the results of the ELISA analysis, the studies confirm that the<br>
h2B6-h3G8 covalent heterodimer retained specificity for both CD32B and CD16, and was capable of binding both antigens simultaneously. The molecule is schematically represented in FIG. 8.<br>
6.2      DESIGN AND CHARACTERIZATION OF COVALENT BISPECIFIC DIABODIES COMPRISING Fc DOMAINS<br>
[00393]	In an effort to create an IgG like molecule, i.e., comprising an Fc domain,<br>
one of the polypeptides comprising the hetcrodimeric CBD molecule presented in Example<br>
6.1 was modified to further comprise an Fc domain (creating a 'heavier' and 'lighter' chain,<br>
analogous to an antibody heavy and light chain). The heterodimeric bispeciilc molecule<br>
would then contain an Fc domain that will dimerize with a homologous molecule, forming a<br>
tetrameric IgG-like molecule with tetravalency (i.e, formed by dimerization via the Fc<br>
domains of the heterodimeric bispecific molecules). Interestingly, such tetrameric<br>
molecules were not detected in the conditioned media of recombinant expression systems<br>
using functional assays, e.g., testing the conditioned media for imrnunospecific binding to<br>
target antigens. Instead, only a dimeric molecule, comprising monomers consisting of a<br>
VL, VH and Fc domain, were detected in such functional assays. To test whether stability<br>
of the theoretical tetrameric structure was at issue, polypeptides comprising the Fc domain<br>
were engineered to further comprise a hinge region while the polypeptides comprising the<br>
'lighter' chain were engineered to further comprise the 6 C-terminal amino acids of the<br>
constant domain of the human kappa light chain. When such reengineered 'heavier' and<br>
'lighter; chains were co-expressed in the recombinant expression systems, functional assays<br>
detected diabody molecules that were able to immunospecifically bind both of the target<br>
antigens and anti-Fc antibodies.<br>
[00394]	Materials and Methods<br>
[00395]	Construction and Design of Potypeptide Molecules: Nucleic acid expression<br>
vectors were designed to produce modified versions of constructs 1 and 2 presented in Example 6.1. Construct 5 (SEQ ID NO: 14) and 6 (SEQ ID NO: 15), were created by engineering construct 1 and 2, respectively to further comprise an Fc domain. Construct 7 (SEQ ID NO: 16) was created by engineering construct 1 was to further comprise the sequence FNRGEC (SEQ ID NO: 23) at its C-terminus. Construct 8 (SEQ ID N0:18) was created by engineering construct 2 to further comprise a hinge region and Fc domain (comprising V215A mutation). Schematic representation of constructs 5-8 is shown in FIG. 9.<br>
[00396]	PCR and Expression Vector Construction: All PCR and PCR product<br>
purification protocols were as described in Example 6.1 Plasmids pMGX0669 and pMGX0667 served as templates for the coding sequences of constructs 1 and 2, respectively.  The coding sequences for the of HulgG Fc domain and/or hinge domain were SEQ ID N0:5 or SEQ ID N0:l and SEQ ID NO:5, respectively. The coding sequences of<br>
the template DNAs were amplified using forward and reverse primers such that the PCR products would contain overlapping sequences, allowing overlapping PCR to generate the coding sequences of the desired products.<br>
[00397]	The coding sequence of construct 1 was amplified from pMGX0669 using<br>
forward and reverse primers SEQ ID NO:57 and SEQ ID N0:64, respectively. The coding sequence of construct 2 was amplified from pMGX0667 using forward and reverse primers SEQ ID N0:57 and SEQ ID NO:65, respectively. HulgG hinge-Fc was amplified using forward and reverse primers SEQ ID NO:67 and SEQ ID N0:68, respectively. Construct 7 (SEQ ID NO: 16) was amplified from pMGX0669 using forward and reverse primers SEQ ID NO:57 and SEQ ID NO:69.<br>
[00398]	Overlapping PCR: Initial PCR products were combined as described below,<br>
amplified and purified as described in example 6.1.<br>
[00399]	The nucleic acid sequence encoding construct 5, SEQ ID NO: 14 (shown<br>
schematically in FIG. 9), was amplified by combining the PCR products of the<br>
amplifications of construct 1 and HulgG Fc, and forward and reverse primers SEQ ID<br>

[00401]	Polypeptide/diabody Expression: Four separate cotransfections into in HEK-<br>
293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000, as described in section 6.1, were performed: pMGX0669 and pMGX0674, encoding constructs 1 and 6, respectively;; pMGX0667 and<br>
"pMGXCT676, encoding constructs 2 and 5, respectively; and pMGX0677 and pMGX0678, encoding constructs 7 and 8, respectively.<br>
[00402]	Co-transfection of these plasmids was designed to lead to the expression of a<br>
bispecific diabody (CBD) of tetravalency with IgG-like structure, immunospecific for both FcyRIIB and FcyRHIA, An additional cotransfection was also performed: pMGX0674 and pMGX0676, encoding constructs 6 and 5, respectively. Following three days in culture, conditioned media was harvested. The amount of secreted product in the conditioned media was quantitiated by anti IgG Fc ELISA using purified Fc as a standard. The concentrations of product in the samples was then normalized based on the quantitation, and the normalized samples used for the remaining assays.<br>
[00403]	ELISA: The binding of diabody molecules secreted into the medium was<br>
assayed by sandwich ELISA as described, supra. Unless indicated, CD32B was used to<br>
coat the plate, i.e., as the target protein, and HRP- conjugated CD 16 was used as the probe.<br>
[00404]	Results<br>
[00405]	An ELISA assay was used to test the normalized samples from the<br>
recombinant expression systems comprising constructs 1 and 6 (pMGX669-pMGX674), constructs 2 and 5 (pMGX667-pNGX676) and constructs 5 and 6 (pMGX674-pMGX676) for expression of diabody molecules capable of simultaneous binding to CD32B and CD16A (FIG. 10). The ELISA data indicated that co-transfection with constructs 1 and 6 or co-transfection with constructs 2 and 5 failed to produce a product that could bind either or both antigens (FIG. 10, D and A, respectively). However, co-transfection of constructs 5 and 6 lead to secretion of a product capable of binding to both CD32B and CD 16 antigens. The latter product was a dimer of constructs 5 and 6, containing one binding site for each antigen with a structure schematically depicted in FIG. 11.<br>
[00406]	In order to drive formation of an IgG like heterotetrameric structure, the<br>
coding sequence for six additional amino acids was appended to the C-terminal of construct 1, generating construct 7 (SEQ ID NO:16 and shown schematically in FIG. 9). The six additional amino acids, FNRGEC (SEQ ID NO.23), were derived from the C-terminal end of the the Kappa light chain and normally interact with the upper hinge domain of the heavy chain, in an IgG molecule. A hinge domain was then engineered into construct 6, generating construct 8 (SEQ ID NO: 18 and FIG. 9). Construct 8 additionally comprised an amino-acid mutation hi the upper hinge region, A215V. Expression plasmids encoding construct 7 and construct 8, pMGX677 and pMGX678, respectively, were then cotransfected into HEK-293 cells and expressed as described.<br>
[00407]	Diabody molecules produced from the recombinant expression system<br>
comprising constructs 7 and 8 (pMGX0677 + pMGX0678), were compared in an ELISA<br>
assay for binding to CD32B and CD16A to diabody molecules produced from expression<br>
systems comprising constructs 1 and 6 (pMGX669 + pMGX674), constructs 2 and 8<br>
(pMGX669 + pMGX67S), and constructs 6 and 7 (pMGX677 + pMGX674) (FIG. 12).<br>
[00408]	As before, the molecule produced by the expression system comprising<br>
constructs 1 and 6 (pMGX669 + pMGX674) proved unable to bind both CD32A and CD16A (FIG. 10 and FIG. 12). In contrast, the product from the co-expression of either constructs 7 and 6 (pMGX0677 + pMGX0674) or from the co-expression of constructs 7 and 8 (pMGX0677-pMGX0678) were able to bind both CD32B and GDI6 (FIG. 12). It is noted that construct 7 is analogous to construct 1, with the exception that construct 7 comprises the C-terminal sequence FNRGEC (SEC ID N0:23); and that construct 8 is analogous to construct 6, except that construct 8 comprises a hinge domain and the mutation A215V. The data indicate that the addition of the 6 extra amino-acids from the C-terminus of the C-kappa light chain (FNRGEC; SEQ ID NO:23) to the non-Fc bearing, 'lighter,' chain helped stabilize the formation of the tetrameric IgG-like diabody molecules, regardless of whether the corresponding heavier chain comprised a hinge domain (i.e., pMGX0677 + pMGX0674 and pMGX0677-pMGX0678, FIG. 12). The addition of the hinge domain to the Fc bearing 'heavier' polypeptide, without the addition of the FNRGEC (SEQ ID NO:23) C-terminal sequence to the corresponding 'lighter' chain, was apparently unable to effect similar stabilization (i.e., lack of binding by product of co-transfectibn of constructs 2 and 8 (pMGX669 + pMGX678)). The structure of the tetrameric diabody molecule is schematically represented in FIG. 13.<br>
6.3      EFFECT OF DOMAIN ORDER AND ADDITIONAL DISULFIDE<br>
BONDS ON FORMATION OF TETRAMERIC IgG-LIKE DIABODY<br>
[00409]	The effect of additional stabilization between the 'lighter' and 'heavier'<br>
polypeptide chains of the tetrameric IgG-like diabody molecule was investigated by substitution of selected residues on the polypeptide chains with cysteines. The additional cysteine residues provide for additional disulfide bonds between the 'heavier' and 'lighter' chains. Additionally, domain order on binding activity was investigated by moving the Fc domain or the hinge-Fc domain from the C-terminal end of the polypeptide chain to the N-terminus. Although the binding activity of the molecule comprising the additional disulfide bonds was not altered relative to earlier constructed diabody molecules with such bonds, transferring the Fc or hinge-Fc domain to the N-terminus of the 'heavier' polypeptide chain<br>
comprising the diabody surprisingly improved binding affinity and/or avidity of the<br>
bispecific molecule to one or both of its target antigens.<br>

[00411]	ConstriictionandDesisn ofPnlypeptide Molecules: Nucleic acid expression<br>

schematically in FIG. 13) were analogous to constructs 8 and 6, with the exception that Fc<br>
domain or hinge-Fc domain, respectively, was shifted from the C-terminus of the<br>
polypeptide to the N-terminus. Additionally all Fc domains used were wild-type IgGl Fc<br>
domains. Construct 11, SEQ ID N0:21, (shown schematically in FIG. 14) was analogous to<br>
construct 2 from Example 6.1 except that the C-terminus was designed to further comprise<br>
the sequence FNRGEC (SEQ ID N0:23). Construct 12, SEQ ID NO:22 (shown<br>
schematically in FIG. 14) was analogous to construct 5 from Example 6.2 except that the Fc<br>
domain further comprised a hinge region. Also, for constructs 11 and 12, the 2B6 VL<br>
domain and 2B6 VH domain comprised a single amino acid modification (G105C and<br>
G44C, respectively) such that a glycine in each domain was replaced by cysteine.<br>

[00419]	Conditioned media from the recombinant expression systems comprising<br>
constructs 1 and 9; constructs 1 and 10; and constructs 11 and 12 were analyzed by SDS-<br>
PAGE (under non reducing conditions) analysis and Western-blotting (using an anti-IgG as<br>

11 and 12 or comprising constructs 9 and 1 predominately formed a single species of<br>
molecule of approximately 150 kDa (FIG. 14, lanes 3 and 2, respectively). Both of these<br>
products have engineered internal disulfide bonds between the 'lighter' and 'heavier' chains<br>
comprising the diabody. In contrast, the molecule without engineered internal disulfide<br>
bonds between the 'lighter' and 'heavier' chains, formed of constructs 10 and 1, formed at<br>
least two molecular species of molecular weights -75 and ~100 kDa (FIG. 14, lane 1).<br>
[00420]	Despite the results of the Western Blot, each of the three products was found<br>
capable of binding both CD32A and CD 16 (FIG. 15). Surprisingly, relative to the product comprising a C-temiinal hinge-Fc domain (formed of constructs 11 and 12), the product from both systems wherein the Fc (or Fc-hinge) domain was at the ammo terminus of the Fc<br>
containing polypeptide chain (i.e., the 'heavier' chain) (constructs 9+1 and constructs 10+1) demonstrated enhanced affinity and/or avidity to one or both of its target peptides (/. e. CD32B and/or CD16).<br>
6.4      EFFECT OF INTERNAL/EXTERNAL CLEAVAGE SITE ON PROCESSING OF POLYPROTEIN PRECURSOR AND EXPRESSION OF COVALENT BISPECIFIC DIABODY; DESIGN AND CHARACTERIZATION OF BISPECIFIC DIABODY COMPRISING PORTIONS OF HUMAN IgG LAMBDA CHAIN AND HINGE DOMAIN<br>
[00421]	As described herein, the individual polypeptide chains of the diabody or<br>
diabody molecule of the invention may be expressed as a single polyprotein precursor molecule. The ability of the recombinant systems described in Examples 6.1-6.3 to properly process and express a functional CBD from such a polyprotein precursor was tested by engineering a nucleic acid to encode, both the first and second polypeptide chains of a CBD separated by an internal cleavage site, in particular, a furin cleavage site. Functional, CBD was isolated from the recombinant system comprising the polyprotein precursor molecule.<br>
[00422]	.As discussed in Example 6.3, addition of the 6 C-terminal amino acids from<br>
the human kappa light chain, FNRGEC (SEQ ID NO:23), was found to stabilize diabody<br>
formation — presumably through enhanced inter-chain interaction between the domains<br>
comprising SEQ ID N0:23 and those domains comprising an Fc domain or a hinge-Fc<br>
domain. The stabilizing effect of this lambda chain/Fc like interaction was tested in CBD<br>
wherein neither polypeptide chain comprised an Fc domain. One polypeptide chain of the<br>
diabody was engineered to comprise SEQ ID NO:23 at its C-terminus; the partner<br>
polypeptide chain was engineered to comprise the amino acid sequence VEPKSC (SEQ ID<br>
N0:79), which was derived from the hinge domain of an IgG. Comparison of this CBD to<br>
that comprised of constructs 1 and 2 (from example 6.1) revealed that the CBD comprising<br>
the domains derived from hinge domain and lambda chain exhibited slightly greater affinity<br>
to one or both of its target epitopes.<br>

Table 16.       PLASMID CONSTRUCTS<br>
<br>
(Table 16 Removed) <br>
[00429]	Polypeptide/'diabody Expression: One transfection and one cotransfection<br>
into in HEK-293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000, as described in section 6.1, were<br>
performed: single: pMGX0750, encoding construct 13; and cotranfection: pMGX0752 and<br>
pMGX0753, encoding constructs 15 and 16, respectively. Following three days in culture,<br>
conditioned media was harvested, and secreted product affinity purified as described.<br>
[00430]	ELISA: The binding of diabody molecules secreted into the medium was<br>
assayed by sandwich ELISA as described, supra. Murine CD32B was used to coat the<br>
plate, i.e., as the target protein, and HRP- conjugated CD16A was used as the probe for the<br>
product of the co-transfection of constructs 15 and 16. mCD32B was used as the target<br>
protein and biotin-conjugated CD16A was used as the probe for the recombinant system<br>
comprising construct 13.<br>
[00431]	Results<br>
[00432]	Conditioned media from the recombinant expression systems comprising<br>
constructs 13 was analysed by sandwich ELISA. The ELISA assay tested the binding of the CBD for specificity to either or both of mCD32B and/or CD16 (FIG. 18). CD32B served as the target antigen and GDI 6A was used as the secondary probe. The positive signal in the ELISA revealed that the heterodimeric h2.4G2-h3G8 CBD produced from the polyprotein precursor had specificity for both antigens.<br>
[00433]	Similarly, the purified product generated by cotransfection of the vectors<br>
encoding constructs 15 and 16 was tested in an ELISA assay and compared to the product comprised of contructs 1 and 2 (Example 6.1). CD32B served as the target antigen and CD16A was used as the secondary probe. As with the product comprised of constructs 1 and 2, the product of constructs 15 and 16 was found to be capable of simultaneously binding CD32B and CD16A. In fact, the product of constructs 15 and 16 showed slightly enhanced affinity for one or both of the target antigens, i,e. CD32B or CD16A. This is perhaps due to increased stability and or fidelity (relative to a wild type VH-VL domain interaction) of the interchain association afforded by the interaction of the lambda chain region, FNRGEC (SEQ ID N0:23) and hinge region VEPKSC (SEQ ID NO:79), which is absent in the product comprised of constructs 1 and 2.<br>
