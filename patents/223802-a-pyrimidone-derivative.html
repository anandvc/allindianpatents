SUBSTITUTED 8-PERFLUOROALKYL-6,7,8,9-TETRAHYDROPYRIMIDO[1,2-a]<br>
PYRIMIDIN-4-0NE DERIVATIVES<br>
Specification<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to compounds that are useful as an active<br>
ingredient of a medicament for preventive and/or therapeutic treatment of<br>
neurodegenerative diseases caused by abnormal activity of GSK3p.<br>
Background Art<br>
GSK3P (glycogen synthase kinase 3) is a proline directed serine,<br>
threonine kinase that plays an important role in the control of metabolism,<br>
differentiation and survival. It was initially identified as an enzyme able to<br>
phosphorylate and hence inhibit glycogen synthase. It was later recognized that<br>
GSK3 was identical to tau protein kinase 1 (TPK1), an enzyme that<br>
phosphorylates tau protein in epitopes that are also found to be<br>
hyperphosphorylated in Alzheimer's disease and in several taupathies.<br>
Interestingly, protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation of GSK3 results in a loss of<br>
its kinase activity, and it has been hypothesized that this inhibition may mediate<br>
some of the effects of neurotrophic factors. Moreover, phosphorylation by GSK3<br>
of -catenin, a protein involved in cell survival, results in its degradation by an<br>
ubiquitinilation dependent proteasome pathway.<br>
Thus, it appears that inhibition of GSK3 activity may result in neurotrophic<br>
activity. Indeed there is evidence that lithium, an uncompetitive inhibitor of GSK3<br>
enhances neuritogenesis in some models and also increases neuronal survival,<br>
through the induction of survival factors such as Bcl-2 and the inhibition of the<br>
expression of proapoptotic factors such as P53 and Bax.<br>
Recent studies have demonstrated that p-amyloid increases the GSK3p activity<br>
and tau protein phosphorylation. Moreover, this hyperphosphorylation as well as<br>
the neurotoxic effects of p-amyloid are blocked by lithium chloride and by a GSK3<br>
antisense mRNA. These observations strongly suggest that GSK3p may be the<br>
link between the two major pathological processes in Alzheimer's disease:<br>
abnormal APP (Amyloid Precursor Protein) processing and tau protein<br>
hyperphosphorylation.<br><br>
WO 2004/083210	PCT/EP2004/004013<br>
2<br>
Although tau hyperphosphorylation results in a destabilization of the neuronal<br>
cytoskeleton, the pathological consequences of abnormal GSK3 activity are,<br>
most likely, not only due to a pathological phosphorylation of tau protein because,<br>
as mentioned above, an excessive activity of this kinase may affect survival<br>
through the modulation of the expression of apoptotic and antiapoptotic factors.<br>
Moreover, it has been shown that p-amyloid-indueed increase in GSK3 activity<br>
results in the phosphorylation and, hence the inhibition of pyruvate<br>
dehydrogenase, a pivotal enzyme in energy production and acetylcholine<br>
synthesis.<br>
Altogether these experimental observations indicate that GSK3 may find<br>
application in the treatment of the neuropathological consequences and the<br>
cognitive and attention deficits associated with Alzheimer's disease, as well as<br>
other acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases. These include, in a non-<br>
limiting manner, Parkinson's disease, tauopathies (e.g. frontotemporoparietal<br>
dementia, corticobasal degeneration, Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear<br>
palsy) and other dementia including vascular dementia; acute stroke and others<br>
traumatic injuries; cerebrovascular accidents (e.g. age related macular<br>
degeneration); brain and spinal cord trauma; peripheral neuropathies;<br>
retinopathies and glaucoma.<br>
In addition GSK3 may find application in the treatment of other diseases<br>
such as:<br>
Non-insulin dependent diabetes (such as diabetes type II) and obesity; manic<br>
depressive illness; schizophrenia; alopecia; cancers such as breast cancer, non-<br>
small cell lung carcinoma, thyroid cancer, T or B-cell leukemia and several virus-<br>
induced tumors.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>

As a further object, the present invention concerns also methods for preparing the<br>
substituted-pyrimidone compounds represented by the aforementioned formula (I).<br>
These compounds can be prepared, for example, according to methods explained<br>
below.<br>
Preparation method<br>
Substituted-pyrimidone compounds represented by the aforementioned<br>
formula (I), may be prepared according to the method described in the scheme 1.<br><br>
Following this method, the pyrimidinone derivative represented by the<br>
above formula (III), wherein R1, R31R4,R5,p and q are as defined for compound of<br>
formula (I), is allowed to react with a base such as sodium hydride, sodium<br>
carbonate or potassium carbonate in a solvent such as N,N-dirnethylformamide,<br>
N-methylpyrrolidone, N,N-dimethylacetamide or chloroform at a suitable<br><br>
WO 2004/083210	PCT/EP2004/004013<br>
11<br>
temperature ranging from 0 to 130°C under ordinary air, then with a compound of<br>
formula (ll), wherein R2, X, Y and n are as defined for compound of formula (I) and<br>
L represents a leaving group preferably bromide or mesyl group, to obtain the<br>
compound of the aforementioned formula (I).<br>
Alternatively compounds of formula (I) wherein Y represents a carbonyi<br>
group may be prepared by oxydation of a compound of formula (I) wherein Y<br>
represents a methylene group substituted by a hydroxyl group according to well<br>
known methods to one skilled in the art.<br>
Compound of formula (II) is commercially available or may be synthesized<br>
according to well-known methods to one skilled in the art.<br>
Compound of formula (111) may be prepared according to the method<br>
defined in scheme 2.<br><br>
Scheme 2<br>
According to this method, the 3-ketoester of formula (IV), wherein R1 and<br>
R5 are as defined for compound of formula (I) and R is an alkyl group such as for<br>
example methyl or ethyl, is allowed to react with a compound of formula (V),<br>
wherein R3, R4, p and q are as described for compound of formula (I).<br>
The reaction may be carried out in the presence of a base such as<br>
potassium carbonate, in an alcoholic solvent such as methanol, ethanol and the<br>
like or without, at a suitable temperature ranging from 25° to 140°C under ordinary<br>
air.<br>
Alternatively, compound of formula (III) wherein R5 represents a hydrogen<br>
atom may be halogenated in order to give compounds of formula (111) wherein R5<br>
is a halogen atom such as a bromine atom or a chlorine atom. The reaction may<br><br>
WO 2004/083210	PCT/EP2004/004013<br>
12<br>
be carried out in an acidic medium such as acetic acid or propionic acid, in<br>
presence of bromosuccinimide or chlorosuccimide, or bromine.<br>
In addition, compounds of formula (III) wherein R5 represents a fluorine<br>
atom may be obtained by analogy to the method described in Tetrahedron Letters,<br>
Vol.30.No.45.pp 6113-6116, 1989.<br>
Compound of formula (IV) is commercially available or may be<br>
synthesized according to well-known methods to one skilled in the art.<br>
For example compounds of formula (IV), wherein R1 represent a pyridine<br>
ring or a pyrimidine ring, optionally substituted by a C1-4 alkyl group, C1-4 alkoxy<br>
group or a halogen atom, can be prepared by reacting respectively an isonicotinic<br>
acid or a pyrimidine-carboxylic acid, optionally substituted by a C1-4 alkyl group,<br>
C1-4 alkoxy group or a halogen, with the corresponding malonic acid monoester.<br>
The reaction can be carried out using methods well known to one skilled in the art,<br>
such as for example in presence of a coupling agent such as 1,1'-carbonylbis-1H-<br>
imidazole in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at a temperature ranging from 20 to<br>
70°C.<br>
In the above reactions protection or deprotection of a functional group<br>
may sometimes be necessary. A suitable protecting group Pg can be chosen<br>
depending on the type of the functional group, and a method described in the<br>
literature may be applied. Examples of protecting groups, of protection and<br>
deprotection methods are given for example in Protective groups in Organic<br>
Synthesis Greene et al., 2nd Ed. (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York).<br>
Compound of formula (V) is commercially available or may be synthesized<br>
according to well-known methods of one skilled in the art.<br>
Alternatively, compound of formula (V), wherein p represents 2 and q<br>
represents 0, may be prepared according to the method defined in scheme 3.<br><br>
WO 2004/083210	PCT/EP2004/004013<br>
13<br><br>
Scheme 3<br>
(In the above scheme Pg represents an amino-protecting group and L a leaving<br>
group, preferably a bromide group or m'esyl group)<br>
According to this method, compound of formula (VI), wherein R4 is defined<br>
as for compound of formula (I), may be obtained through different manners,<br>
depending on R3.<br>
The 3-aminoacid of formula (VI), wherein R3 is a hydrogen atom, may be<br>
synthesized by analogy to the method described in Tetrahedron Letters, Vol. 43,<br>
No.11,pp 1977-1981, 2002.<br>
The 3-aminoacid of formula (Vi), wherein R3 is a C1-6 alkyl group, may be<br>
synthesized by analogy to the method described in Journal of Organic Chemistry,<br>
Vol.56, No.1,pp 4-6, 1991.<br>
In both cases, an amino-protecting group is necessary. Examples of<br>
protection and deprotection methods are given for example in Protective groups in<br>
Organic Synthesis Greene et al., 2nd Ed. (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York).<br>
By analogy to these methods, compounds of formula (VII) and (VIII) may<br>
be obtained by aminoprotection and compound of formula (IX) may be obtained by<br>
deprotection.<br>
Then, compound of formula (V) may be obtained by cyclisation, according<br><br>
WO 2004/083210	PCT/EP2004/004013<br>
14<br>
to well-known methods to one skilled in the art.<br>
Alternatively, if R3 represents H, compound of formula (V) may be<br>
obtained by hydrogenation of compound of formula (X), according to well-known<br>
methods to one skilled in the art.<br>
Compound of formula (X) is commercially available or may be synthesized<br>
according to well-known methods to one skilled in the art.<br>
As a further object, the present invention concerns also the compound of<br>
formula (III) as intermediate for preparing compounds of formula (I).<br>
The compounds of the present invention have inhibitory activity against<br>
GSK3p. Accordingly, the compounds of the present invention are useful as an<br>
active ingredient for the preparation of a medicament, which enables preventive<br>
and/or therapeutic treatment of a disease caused by abnormal GSK3 activity and<br>
more particularly of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. In<br>
addition, the compounds of the present invention are also useful as an active<br>
ingredient for the preparation of a medicament for preventive and/or therapeutic<br>
treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease,<br>
tauopathies (e.g. frontotemporoparietal dementia, corticobasal degeneration,<br>
Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy) and other dementia including<br>
vascular dementia; acute stroke and others traumatic injuries; cerebrovascular<br>
accidents (e.g. age related macular degeneration); brain and spinal cord trauma;<br>
peripheral neuropathies; retinopathies and glaucoma; and other diseases such as<br>
non-insulin dependent diabetes (such as diabetes type II) and obesity; manic<br>
depressive illness; schizophrenia; alopecia; cancers such as breast cancer, non-<br>
small cell lung carcinoma, thyroid cancer, T or B-cell leukemia and several virus-<br>
induced tumors.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method for treating<br>
neurodegenerative diseases caused by abnormal activity of GSK3 and of the<br>
aforementioned diseases which comprises administering to a mammalian<br>
organism in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of the formula (I).<br>
As the active ingredient of the medicament of the present invention, a<br>
substance may be used which is selected from the group consisting of the<br>
compound represented by the aforementioned formula (I) and pharmacologically<br><br>
WO 2004/083210	PCT/EP2004/004013<br>
15<br>
acceptable salts thereof, and solvates thereof and hydrates thereof. The<br>
substance, per se, may be administered as the medicament of the present<br>
invention, however, it is desirable to administer the medicament in a form of a<br>
pharmaceutical composition which comprises the aforementioned substance as an<br>
active ingredient and one or more pharmaceutical additives. As the active<br>
ingredient of the medicament of the present invention, two or more of the<br>
aforementioned substances may be used in combination. The above<br>
pharmaceutical composition may be supplemented with an active ingredient of<br>
another.medicament for the treatment of the above mentioned diseases. The type<br>
of pharmaceutical composition is not particularly limited, and the composition may<br>
be provided as any formulation for oral or parenteral administration. For example,<br>
the pharmaceutical composition may be formulated, for example, in the form of<br>
pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration such as granules, fine<br>
granules, powders, hard capsules, soft capsules, syrups, emulsions, suspensions,<br>
solutions and the like, or in the form of pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral<br>
administrations such as injections for intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous<br>
administration, drip infusions, transdermal preparations, transmucosal<br>
preparations, nasal drops, inhalants, suppositories and the like. Injections or drip<br>
infusions may be prepared as powdery preparations such as in the form of<br>
lyophilized preparations, and may be used by dissolving just before use in an<br>
appropriate aqueous medium such as physiological saline. Sustained-release<br>
preparations such as those coated with a polymer may be directly administered<br>
intracerebrally.<br>
Types of pharmaceutical additives used for the manufacture of the<br>
pharmaceutical composition, content ratios of the pharmaceutical additives relative<br>
to the active ingredient, and methods for preparing the pharmaceutical<br>
composition may be appropriately chosen by those skilled in the art. Inorganic or<br>
organic substances, or solid or liquid substances may be used as pharmaceutical<br>
additives. Generally, the pharmaceutical additives may be incorporated in a ratio<br>
ranging from 1 % by weight to 90% by weight based on the weight of an active<br>
ingredient.<br>
Examples of excipients used for the preparation of solid pharmaceutical<br>
compositions include, for example, lactose, sucrose, starch, talc, cellulose, dextrin,<br>
kaolin, calcium carbonate and the like. For the preparation of liquid compositions<br>
for oral administration, a conventional inert diluent such as water or a vegetable oil<br>
may be used. The liquid composition may contain, in addition to the inert diluent,<br>
auxiliaries such as moistening agents, suspension aids, sweeteners, aromatics,<br><br>
WO 2004/083210	PCT/EP2004/004013<br>
16<br>
colorants, and preservatives. The liquid composition may be filled in capsules<br>
made of an absorbable material such as gelatin. Examples of solvents or<br>
suspension mediums used for the preparation of compositions for parenteral<br>
administration, e.g. injections, suppositories, include water, propylene glycol,<br>
polyethylene glycol, benzyl alcohol, ethyl oleate, lecithin and the like. Examples of<br>
base materials used for suppositories include, for example, cacao butter,<br>
emulsified cacao butter, lauric lipid, witepsol.<br>
The dose and frequency of administration of the medicament of the<br>
present invention are not particularly limited, and they may be appropriately<br>
chosen depending on conditions such as a purpose of preventive and/or<br>
therapeutic treatment, a type of a disease, the body weight or age of a patient,<br>
severity of a disease and the like. Generally, a daily dose for oral administration to<br>
an adult may be 0.01 to 1,000 mg (the weight of an active ingredient), and the<br>
dose may be administered once a day or several times a day as divided portions,<br>
or once in several days. When the medicament is used as an injection,<br>
administrations may preferably be performed continuously or intermittently in a<br>
daily dose of 0.001 to 100 mg (the weight of an active ingredient) to an adult.<br>
