				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The invention relates to a new aerosol cream mousse formulation, preferably an aerosol cream mousse hair treating composition, especially for hair conditioning purposes and the method of use.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hair cosmetics aerosols (foams respectively mousses) for hair conditioning purposes deliver significant advantages concerning distribution and handling in comparison with emulsions or dispersions. Nevertheless the disadvantage of conventional mousses are the hap-tical and optical properties, these mousses are less creamy and rich than emulsions and dispersion. Therefore lots of consumers do not use conditioning aerosol mousses, especially those with damaged hair, because the optical and haptical (feel and touch) properties do not meet the need for creamy and rich textures of consumers having damaged hair.<br>
It was therefore an object of the present invention to develop an aerosol cream mousse formulation, preferably a hair care aerosol cream mousse, delivering much more creami-ness and richness than conventional mousses. The idea of developing more creamy aerosol mousses is known from Japanese patent 3,616,154 that describes a composition containing a surface active agent, monohydric higher alcohol, wood ether as liquified gas and carbon dioxide as compressed gas in order to achieve a richer mousse texture.<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide a new aerosol cream mousse formulation preferable for hair treating compositions without having the tendency to be unstable during storage and enabling a good distribution on the hair. It is desirable to provide such a composition, as described above in aerosol form, such as a "whipped cream", which can be easily applied and rinsed from the hair. It is a further object of this invention to provide such a hair care composition that has an aesthetically pleasing wet hair feel, a glossy consistency and perception of spreading upon application to the hair together with excellent wet and dry combability of hair.<br>
It is further desirable to provide a method for conditioning hair in accordance with the above compositions.<br>
These and other objects and benefits of the present invention as may be set forth herein as may now or later become apparent to those skilled in the art can be provided according to the invention which is described herein.<br>
The invention hereof can comprise, consist of, or consist essentially of the essential elements described herein as welt as any of the preferred or other optional ingredients described herein.<br>
All percentages herein are by weight of the composition unless otherwise indicated. All ratios are weight ratios unless otherwise indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, all percentages, ratios, and levels of ingredients referred to herein are based on the actual amount of the ingredient, and do not include solvents, fillers, or other materials with which the ingredient may be combined in commercially available products. All documents referred to herein, including all patents, all patent applications and all articles, are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides stable aerosol cream mousse composition, preferably hair care composition, that can provide enhanced touch, combability, alignment and volume reduction to the hair, with low or reduced greasy, oily hair feel, while being formulated in an emulsion having a thick, cream-type rheology with excellent spreading, perception of spreading, and feel.<br>

Cationic Polvmer Conditioning Agent<br>
The compositions of the present invention can also contain one or more cationic polymer conditioning agents. The cationic polymer conditioning agent will preferably be water soluble. Cationic polymers are typically used in the same ranges as disclosed above for cationic surfactants.<br>
By "water soluble" cationic organic polymer, what is meant is a polymer which is sufficiently soluble in water to form a substantially clear solution to the naked eye at a concentration of 0.1 % in water (distilled or equivalent) at 25 "C. Preferably, the polymer will be sufficiently soluble to form a substantially clear solution at 0.5% concentration, more preferably at 1.0% concentration. As used herein, the term "polymer" shall include materials whether made by polymerization<br>
of one type of monomer or made by two (i.e., copolymers) or more types of monomers.<br>

Cationic charge density of the cationic polymer can be determined according to the Neldahl Method. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the charge density of amino-containing polymers may vary depending upon pH and the isoelectric point of the amino groups. The charge density should be within the above limits at the pH of intended use. Any anionic counterions can be utilized for the cationic polymers so long as the water solubility criteria is met. Suitable counterions include halides (e. g., Cl, Br, I, or F, preferably Cl, Br, or I), sulfate, and methylsulfate. Others can also be used, as this list is not exclusive. The cationic nitrogen-containing moiety will be present generally as a substituent, on a fraction of the total monomer units of the cationic hair conditioning polymers. Thus, the cationic polymer can comprise copolymers, terpolymers etc. of quaternary ammonium or cationic amine-substituted monomer units and other non-cationic units referred to herein as spacer monomer units.<br>

Other suitable spacer monomers include vinyl esters, vinyl, alcohol (made by hydrolysis of polyvinyl acetate), maleic anhydride, propylene glycol, and ethylene glycol.<br>
The cationic amines can be primary, secondary, or tertiary amines, depending upon the particular species and the pH of the composition. In general, secondary and tertiary<br>
amines, especially tertiary, amines, are preferred. Amine-substituted vinyl monomers can be polymerized in the amine form, and then optionally can be converted to ammonium by a quaternization reaction. Amines can also be similarly quaternized subsequent to formation of the polymer. For example, tertiary amine functionalities can be quaternized by reaction with a salt of the formula R'X wherein R' is a short chain alkyl, preferably a C1-C7 alkyl, more preferably a C1-C3 alkyl, and X is an anion which forms a water soluble salt with the quaternized ammonium.<br>
Suitable cationic amino and quaternary ammonium monomers include, for example, vinyl compounds substituted with dialkylaminoalkyl acrylate, dialkylaminoalkyl methacrylate, monoalkylaminoalkyl acrylate, monoalkylaminoalkyl methacrylate, trialkyl methacryloxyal-kyl ammonium salt, trialkyl acryloxyalkyl ammonium salt, diallyl quaternary ammonium salts, and vinyl quaternary ammonium monomers having cyclic cationic nitrogen-containing rings such as pyridinium, imidazolium, and quaternized pyrrolidone, e.g. alkyl vinyl imidazolium, alkyl vinyl pyridinium, alkyl vinyl pyrrolidone salts. The alkyl portions of these monomers are preferably lower alkyls such as the C1-C3 alkyls, more preferably 01 and C2 alkyls.

Suitable cationic hair conditioning polymers include, for example: copolymers of 1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone and 1-vinyl-3-methylimidazolium salt (e.g., chloride salt) (referred to in the industry by the Cosmetic, Toiletry, and Fragrance Association, "CTFA", as Polyquaternium-16), such as those commercially available from BASF Wyandotte Corp. (Parsippany, NJ, USA) under the LUVIQUAT tradename (e. g. LUVIQUAT FC 370); copolymers of 1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone and dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (referred to in the industry by CTFA as Polyquaternium-11) such as those commercially available from Gaf Corporation (Wayne, NJ, USA) under the GAFQUAT tradename (e.g., GA17QUAT 755N); cationic diallyl quaternary ammonium-containing polymers, including, for example, dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride homopolymer and copolymers of acrylamide and dimethyl diallyl ammonium chlo-<br>

Other cationic polymers that can be used include cationic quar gum derivatives, such as guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride (commercially available from Celanese Corp. in their JaguarR© series).<br>
Other materials include quaternary nitrogen-containing cellulose ethers (e. g. as described in U.S. Patent 3,962,418, incorporated by reference herein), and copolymers of etherified cellulose and starch (e. g. as described in U.S. Patent 3,958,581, incorporated by reference herein).<br>
As discussed above, the cationic polymer hereof is water soluble. This does not mean, however, that it must be soluble in the composition. Preferably however, the cationic polymer is either soluble in the composition, or in a complex coacervate phase in the composition formed by the cationic polymer and anionic material. Complex coacervates of the cationic polymer can be formed with anionic surfactants or with anionic polymers that can optionally be added to the compositions hereof (e. g. sodium polystyrene sulfonate).<br>
Silicone Conditioning Agents<br>
The compositions hereof can also include nonvolatile soluble or insoluble silicone conditioning agents. By soluble what is meant is that the silicone conditioning agent is miscible with the aqueous carrier of the composition so as to form part of the same phase. By insoluble what is meant is that the silicone from a separate, discontinuous phase from the aqueous carrier, such as in the form of an emulsion or a suspension of droplets of the silicone.<br>
Soluble silicones include silicone copolyols, such as dimethicone copolyols, e.g. polyether siloxane-modified polymers, such as polypropylene oxide, polyethylene oxide modified polydimethylsiloxane, wherein the level of ethylene and/or propyl6ne oxide sufficient to allow solubility in the composition.<br>
Preferred, however, are insoluble silicones. The insoluble silicone hair conditioning agent for use herein will preferably have viscosity of from about 1,000 to about 2,000,000 centi-stokes at 25tC, more preferably from about 10,000 to about 1,800,000, even more preferably from about 100,000 to about 1,500,000 centistokes at 25°C. The viscosity can be measured by means of a glass capillary viscometer as set forth in Dow Corning Corporate Test Method CTM0004, July 20,1970.<br>
Suitable insoluble, nonvolatile silicone fluids include polyalkyl siloxanes, polyaryl siloxanes, polyalkylaryl siloxanes, polyether siloxane copolymers, and mixtures thereof. Other insoluble, nonvolatile silicone fluids having hair conditioning properties can also be used. The<br>
term "nonvolatile" as used herein shall mean that the silicone has a boiling point of at least about 260<c preferably at least about more such materials exhibit very low or no significant vapor pressure ambient conditions. the term fluid shall mean flowable silicone having a viscosity of less than centistokes generally thd will be between and></c>
The preferred silicones are polydimethyl siloxane, polydiethylsiloxane, and polymethyl-phenylsiloxane. Polydimethylsiloxane is especially preferred. The nonvolatile polyalkylsi-loxane fluids that may be used include, for example, polydimethylsiloxanes. These silox-anes are available, for example, from the General Electric Company in their ViscasilR and SF 96 series, and from Dow Corning in their Dow Corning 200®series.<br>
The polyalkylaryl siloxane fluids that may be used, also include, for example, polymethyl-phenylsiloxanes. These siloxanes are available, for example, from the General Electric Company as SF 1075 methyl phenyl fluid or from Dow Corning as 556 Cosmetic Grade Fluid or diquaternary silikones as for example INCI Quaternium-80 (e. g. Abil® Quat 3272 or Abil® Quat 3270 of Th. Goldschmidt AG, Germany).<br>
Especially preferred, for enhancing the shine characteristics of hair, are highly arylated silicones, such as highly phenylated polyethyl silicone having refractive indices of about 1.46 or higher, especially about 1.52 or higher. When these high refractive index silicones are used, they should be mixed with a spreading agent, such as a surfactant or a silicone resin, as described below to decrease the surface tension and enhance the film forming ability of the material.<br>
The polyether siloxane copolymers that may be used include, for example, a polypropylene oxide modified polydimethylsiloxane (e.g., Dow Corning DC-1248®) although ethylene oxide or mixtures of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide may also be used. The ethylene oxide and polypropylene oxide level should be sufficiently low to prevent solubility in the composition hereof.<br>
Another silicone hair conditioning material that can be especially useful in the silicone conditioning agents is insoluble silicone gum. The term "silicone gum", as used herein, means polyorganosiloxane materials having a viscosity at 25 "C of greater than or equal to<br>
1,000,000 centistokes. Silicone gums are described by Petrarch and others including U.S. Patent 4,152,416, Spitzer et al., issued May 1,1979 and Noll, Walter, Chemistry and Technology of Silicones, New York: Academic Press 1968. Also describing silicone gums are General Electric Silicone Rubber Product Data Sheets SE 30, SE 33, SE 54 and SE 76. All of these described references are incorporated herein by reference. The "silicone gums" will typically have a mass molecular weight in excess of about 200,000, generally between about 200,000 and about 1,000,000. Specific examples include polydimethylsi-loxane, (polydimethylsiloxane) (methylvinylsiloxane) copolymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (diphenyl siloxane) (methylvinylsiloxane) copolymer and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferably the silicone hair conditioning agent comprises a mixture of a polydimethylsiloxane gum, having a viscosity greater than about 1,000,000 centistokes and polydimethylsiloxane fluid having a viscosity of from about 10 centistokes to about 100,000 centistokes at 25*0, wherein the ratio of gum to fluid is from about 30:70 to about 70:30, preferably from about 40:60 to about 60:40.<br>
An optional ingredient that can be included in the silicone conditioning agent is silicone resin. Silicone resins are highly crosslinked polymeric siloxane systems. The crosslinking is introduced through the incorporation of trifunctional and tetrafunctional silanes with mono-functional or difunctional, or both, silanes during manufacture of the silicone resin. As is well understood in the art, the degree of crosslinking that is required in order to result in a silicone resin will vary according to the specific silane units incorporated into the silicone resin. In general, silicone materials which have a sufficient level of trifunctional and tetrafunctional siloxane monomer units (and hence, a sufficient level of crosslinking) such that they dry down to a rigid, or hard, film are considered to be silicone resins. The ratio of oxygen atoms to silicon atoms is indicative of the level of crosslinking in a particular silicone material. Silicone materials which have at least about 1.1 oxygen atoms per silicon atom will generally be silicone resins herein.<br>
Preferably, the ratio of oxygen : silicon atoms is at least about 1.2 :1.0. Silanes used in the manufacture of silicone resins include monomethyl-, dimethyl-, tri-methyl-, monophenyl-, diphenyl-, methylphenyl-, monovinyl-, and methylvinyl-chlorosi lanes, and tetrachlorosilane, with the methyl- substituted silanes being most commonly utilized. Preferred resins are offered by General Electric as GE SS4230 and SS4267®. Commercially available silicone resins will generally be supplied in a dissolved form in a<br>
low viscosity volatile or nonvolatile silicone fluid. The silicone resins for use herein should be supplied and incorporated into the present compositions in such dissolved form, as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Silicone resins can enhance deposition of silicone on the hair and can enhance the glossiness of hair with high refractive index volumes.<br>
Silicone materials and silicone resins in particular, can conveniently be identified according to a shorthand nomenclature system well known to those skilled in the art as "MDTQ" nomenclature. Under this system, the silicone is described according to presence of various siloxane monomer units which make up the silicone. Briefly, the symbol M denotes the monofunctional unit (CH3)3SiO).5; D denotes the difunctional unit (CH3)2SiO; T denotes the trifunctional unit (CH3)SiO1.5; and Q denotes the quadri- or tetra-functional unit SiO2. Primes of the unit symbols, e.g., M', D', '17, and Q' denote substituents other than methyl, and must be specifically defined for each occurrence. Typical alternate substituents include groups such as vinyl, phenyls, amines, hydroxyls, etc. The molar ratios of the various units, either in terms of subscripts to the symbols indicating the total number of each type of unit in the silicone (or an average thereof) or as specifically indicated ratios in combination with molecular weight complete the description of the silicone material under the MDTQ system. Higher relative molar amounts of T, Q, T' and/or Q' to D, D1, M and/or or M' in a silicone resin is indicative of higher levels of crosslinking. As discussed before, however, the overall level of crosslinking can also be indicated by the oxygen to silicon ratio.<br>
The silicone resins for use herein which are preferred are MQ, MT, MTQ, MQ and MDTQ resins. Thus, the preferred silicone substituent is methyl. Especially preferred are MQ resins wherein the M:Q ratio is from about 0.5 :1.0 to about 1.5 :1.0 and the average molecular weight of the resin is from about 1,000 to about 10,000.<br>
The silicone hair conditioning agent can be used in the compositions hereof at levels of from about 0.1% to about 5% by weight of the composition, preferably from about 0.3 % to about 3%, more preferably from about 0.5% to about 3.0%, most preferably from about 1.0% to about 3.0 % by weight.<br>
Additional Conditioning Agents<br>
The compositions of the present invention can also comprise one or more additional conditioning agents, such as those selected from the group consisting of avocado oil, fatty ac-<br>
ids, Isopropyl myristate, lanolin, apple wax, bees wax or jojoba oil, phospholipides, e. g. lecithines or ceramldes; vaseline nonvolatile hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon esters. Useful are also imidazolidinyl derivatives as for example INCI Quaternium-87 (Rewoquat® W 575 of Witco, Germany).<br>
The components hereof can comprise from 0.1% to about 20%, preferably, from about 0.1 % to about 10%, more preferably from about 0.5% to about 5%, of additional conditioning agents.<br>
Other Ingredients<br>
The compositions herein can contain a variety of other optional components suitable for rendering such compositions more cosmetically or aesthetically acceptable or to provide them with additional usage benefits. Such conventional optional ingredients are well-known to those skilled in the art.<br>
A wide variety of additonal ingredients can be formulated into the present composition. These include: other conditioning agents, e. g. betaine, carnitin esters, creatine, amino acids, peptides, proteines and vitamines; hair-hold polymers, detersive surfactants such as anionic, nonionic, amphoteric, and zwitterionic surfactants; thickening agents and suspending agents, such as xanthan gum, guar gum, hydroxyethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, starch and starch derivatives, viscosity modifiers such as metha-nolamides of long chain fatty acids, cocomonoethanol amide, salts such as sodium potassium chloride and sulfate and crystalline suspending agents, and pearlescent aids such as ethylene glycol distearate; UV-filters such as p-methoxy cinnamic acid isoamylester, lipo-philc cinnamic acid esters, salicylic acid esters, 4-amino benzoic acid derivatives or hydro-philic sulfonic acid derivatives of benzophenones or 3-benzyliden campher; antioxidants such as tocopheroles; preservatives such as benzyl alcohol, methyl paraben, propyl para-ben and imidazolidinyl urea; polyvinyl alcohol; ethyl alcohol; pH adjusting agents, such as citric acid, formic acid, glyoxylic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, sodium citrate, succinic acid, phosphoric acid, sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate; salts, in general, such as potassium acetate and sodium chloride; coloring agents, such as any of the FD&amp;C or D&amp;C dyes; hair oxidizing (bleaching) agents, such as hydrogen peroxide, perborate and persulfate salts; hair reducing agents, such as the thioglycolates; perfumes, sequestering agents, such as disodium ethylenediamine tetra-acetate, and polymer plasticizing agents, such as glycerin, disobutyl adipate, butyl stearate, and propylene glycol.<br>
Such optional ingredients generally are used individually at levels from about 0.01% to about 10.0%, preferably from about 0.05% to about 5.0% of the composition.<br>
The compositions of the present invention can further comprise from about 0.1% to about 2%, more preferably from about 0.2% to about 1%, and most preferably from about 0.5% to about 1% of a polymer thickening agent. They can still provide a good perception of spreading upon application to the hair.<br>
METHOD OF USE<br>
The hair care compositions of the present invention are used in conventional ways to provide the conditioning and shine benefits of the present invention. Such method of use depends upon the type of aerosol cream composition employed but generally involves application of an effective amount of the product to the hair, which may then be rinsed from the hair (as in the case of hair rinses) or allowed to remain on the hair (as in the case of leave-in products). By "effective amount" it is meant an amount sufficient enough to provide a hair conditioning and/or hair shine benefit. In general, from about 1g to about 50g is applied to the hair on the scalp. The composition is distributed throughout the hair by, typically by rubbing or massaging the hair and scalp with ones' hands or by another's hands.<br>
Preferably, the composition is applied to wet or damp hair prior to drying of the hair. After such compositions are applied to the hair, the hair is dried and styled in accordance with the desires of the user and in the usual ways of the user. Alternately, the composition is applied to dry hair, and the hair is then combed or styled in accordance with the desires of the user.<br>
The aerosol mousse according to the present invention can be used for leave-in and rinse-off applications as well. In the latter case, the period of action of the composition depends on the temperature (about 20*0 to 50<c and is minute to minutes preferably minutes. the inventive composition can also be used as a pre-treating agent before dyeing or permanent wave treatment.></c>

COMPARISON EXPERIMENTS<br>
MOUSSE CONSISTENCY<br>
Associated with the less creamy consistency the aerosol mousse described in example 1 of Japanese patent 3,616,154 (see picture 2) leads to significantly bigger bubbles than the mousse of example 1 of the present invention (see picture 1). The microscopic pictures of both aerosol mousses (picture 3 / example 1 invention) and (picture 4 / example 1 of JP 3,616,154) display a scale of 0.5 mm.<br>
The average bubble sizes are:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
As can be taken from pictures 3 and 4 and the table above, the bubbles of the aerosol mousse according to the present invention are about 7 times smaller than those of aerosol mousse of example 1 of JP 3,616,154. This leads to a more creamy and glossy consistency and also to a better conditioning performance. A foam containing finer bubbles lead to a more homogenous distribution after applying to hair.<br>
HALF HEAD TEST<br>
Further half head tests done by stylists show performance advantages of the aerosol mousse according to the present invention example 1 in comparison to the aerosol mousse of example 1 of JP 3,616,154. Half-head comparisons enables the hairstylist to evaluate the effects of hair products in comparison with a defined standard. This involves a sample of the test product being applied to the head of one model, and then being directly compared to a comparison sample or the untreated hair according to various technical hairstyling criteria. This test is termed a half-head comparison because the test samples are applied to one half the head respectively, thus enabling a direct comparison under absolutely identical test conditions (identical hair structure, degree of damage, hair color etc.). The performance of the aerosol mousse according to the present invention (example 1) was compared with the performance of the aerosol mousse of example 1 of JP 3,616,154. Both aerosol mousses were applied as rinse-off conditioners. A detailed description of the<br>
half head test is given further below.<br>
The following hair care criteria were judged by experienced stylists:<br>
•	distribution of the mousse<br>
•	creaminess of the mousse<br>
•	wet combability after application and rinsing<br>
•	dry feel after drying<br>
•	hair shine<br>
Half head test are carried out with 5 volunteers, the numbers indicated for how many volunteers each criteria was judged and how:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The results indicated clearly that the aerosol mousse according to the present invention leads to better distribution in hair during the application, more creaminess, better combability, better dry feel and more intense hair shine.<br>
Test Methods<br>
Half Head Test<br>
Half-head comparisons enable the hairstylist to evaluate the effects of hair products in comparison with a defined standard. This involves a sample of the test product being applied to the head of one model, and then being directly compared to a comparison sample or the untreated hair according to various technical hairstyling criteria. This test is termed a half-head comparison because the test samples are applied to one half the head respectively, thus enabling a direct comparison under absolutely identical test conditions (identical hair structure, degree of damage, hair color etc.).<br>
The selection of models is as random as possible, although the following guidelines must be met:<br>
-	A hair diagnosis establishes whether the model is suitable for the planned half-head<br>
comparison<br>
-	Hair structure must be commensurate with the type of product to be tested, e.g. normal<br>
hair structure for normal hair conditioning products, colored hair for colored hair condi<br>
tioning products etc.<br>
-	Hair should be at least 12 cm long so that feel and combability can be assessed cor<br>
rectly<br>
-	The amount of hair of each model should be big enough to enable a clear-cut assess<br>
ment<br>
-	Hairstyles should be symmetrical; otherwise the hair may be thicker on one half than<br>
the other<br>
Each model's hair is washed twice with neutral shampoo and subsequently towel-dried. The towel-dried hair is then parted in the middle into two sections from brow to neck. One of the sections is treated with a composition according to example 1 of the present invention; A composition according to example 1 of patent JP 3,616,154 being applied to the other section, whereby the same quantity of product must be applied to both sections (amount depending on hair length).<br>
Evaluation Criteria Half Head Tests:<br>
Creaminess:<br>
The product mass on the hair is lightly rubbed between the fingers, and an assessment made of which side feels creamier or more watery.<br>
Distribution:<br>
Evaluation here is of whether a product is easier or more difficult to work into the hair.<br>
Wet Combabilitv:<br>
Combability of the hair is assessed by placing an aluminum comb parallel to the middle parting and running it through the hair to the shoulder.<br>
The comb must remain at a 90° angle throughout and also remain in contact with the scalp throughout combing in order to avoid varying comb angles. The amount of resis-<br>
tance/effort needed during combing is the basis for evaluating the product as easier to comb/more difficult to comb.<br>
Dry Feel:<br>
When the hair is completely dry, the evaluating stylist assesses the dry feel of the hair. This is assessed by running the hair from root to end between the thumb and middle and index fingers, while simultaneously applying light pressure; or alternatively, by running lightly outspread fingers through the hair from root to end. If the hair runs easily through the fingers, this is referred to as a smooth feel; if the hair is impeded from running easily through the fingers, this is referred to as a coarse feel.<br>
Hair Shine:<br>
Hair shine is evaluated by looking at the reflection of light on the hair under standard conditions (natural daylight or a daylight lamp). From a distance of 0.5 m, and with slight head movements by the model, the light reflection or shine is evaluated as more/less.<br>
Photos<br>
A Casio LCD-Digitalcamera QV-4000, flash and foreground modus was used.<br>
Microscopy<br>
Microscope: Leica DM/RD. Microscope photos were taken by a digital camera (Polaroid DMC le, lens 2.5), which was connected to the microscope. For data analysis of the microscope photos Analysis Program Version 3.0 (Soft Imaging Systems) was used. Horizontal diameters of the aerosol bubbles were measured.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
