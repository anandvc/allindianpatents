				<td>HYDROPHILIC POLYURETHANE COMPOSITIONS<br>
The present invention relates to hydrophilic hneax polyurethane polymers, suitable for the production of controlled release compositions for release of phaimaceutically active agents over a prolonged period of time.<br>
Certain cross-linked polytuethane hydrogel polymers are known from European Patent Publication EP0016652 and EP0016654. These patent spccijBcalions describe cross-linked polyurethanes formed by reacting a polyethylene oxide of equivalent weight greater than 1500 with a polyfiinctional isocyanate and a trifunctional compound reactive therewith, such as an alkane triol    The resultant cross-linked polyurethane polymers are water-swellable to form a hydrogel but arc water-insoluble and may be loaded with water-soluble pharraaccutically active agents. One particular polyurethane polymer is the reaction product of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000, dicyclohexylmethane-4,4-diisocyanate (DMDI) and 1,2,6-hexane tnol and which has been used commercially for vaginal delivery of prostaglandins.<br>
However, such cross-linked polyurethane polymera possess a number of practical disadvantages. Whilst the use of a triol cross-linking agent is effective in providing polywers of relatively reproducible swelling characteristics, the percent swelling is typically 200-300% (i.e. the increase in weight of the swollen polymer divided by the weight of the dry polymer)   Pharmaceutically active agents are loaded by contacting the polymer with an aqueous solution of pharmaceutically active agent, such that the solution becomes absorbed into the polymer, forming a hydrogel.   The swollen polymer is then dried bade to a chosen water content before use. As a consequence, the degree of swelling limits the molecular weight of the pharmaceuticaily active agent which can be absorbed into the hydrogel structure to below about 3000 g/mol. A further disadvantage is that only water-soluble pharmaceuticaily active agents may be used for<br>
 <br>
loading. And the release properties are quite limited since prolonged release cannot be achieved; a maximum release time of 24 hours in vivo can be attained for water soluble drugs.<br>
In addition to these disadvantages, the conventional cross-linked polyurethane polymer is essentially a non-thermoplastic polymer (thcrmoset), and is therefore insoluble in both water and organic solvents, making the further processing of the polymer into other solid forms, such as films, monolithic devices, foams, wafers, composites, sandwich structures, particles, pellets, foams or coatings, effectively impossible. In addition, the thermoset nature of the conventional cross-linked polyurethane polymer excludes the possibility of melt mixing drug and polymer in order to load the polymer with a suitable active agent without using solvents or water.<br>
Certain thermoplastic polyurethane hydrogel polymers are known from patent Publication WO2004029125 CPCT/GB2003/004208). This patent specificaton descnbes linear thermoplastic polyurethanes formed by reacting a polyethylene oxide of molecular weight of greater than 4000 g/mol with a polyfunctional isocyanate and a bifunctional compound reactive therewith, such as an alkaue diol or diamine. The resultant thermoplastic polyurethane polymers axe water-swellable ta form a hydrogel but are water-insoluble and may be loaded with water-soluble pharmaceutically active agents. One particular polyurethane polymer is the reaction product of polyethylene glycol 8000, Desmodur (DMDI i.e. dicyclohexylmethane-4,4-du3ocyanate) and 1,10 decane diol, which has shown %-3Welling from 600 up to 1700% or even above. This type of polymer has shown its suitability for diffusion loading and short-term delivery of relatively water-soluble drugs e.g. Clindamycin phosphate, Oxytocin, and Misoprostol.<br>
However, such high-swelling thermoplasric polyurethane polymers also possess some practical disadvantages. Due to the high weight content and block length of PEG,<br>
 <br>
the polymer is onJy suitable tor relatively short-term release (i.e. controlled rdlease from 10 min to only a few hours) of active agents, especially in the case of highly water-soluble drugs. la addition, the low hydrophobic content, e.g. low amount of hydrophobic compound e.g. decane diol (DD) or dodecanediol (DDD), makes the polymer inpropriate for hydrophobic drugs; thus restrictng its use. Furthermore, this imbalance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions hampers the microphase separation, reducing the mechanical strength of the polymer in both dry and wet states. Hydrophilic end hydrophobic drugs need to have interactions with both of the phases in order for their release to be controlled by the polymer structure.<br>
The swelling percentage of high-swelling thermoplastic poIyurethanes is typically 200-1700% and is dependent on the PEG content and/or the length of PEG block, Pharmaceutically active agents can be loaded by using exactly the same method as the one described above for the convcntional cross-linked polyurethane, and the release times and profiles arc very similar.<br>
Patent specification WO 94/22934 discloses the production of a linear random block copolymer from polyethylene oxide (number average molecular weight 1000 to 12,000), a diamine and a diisocyanate.   Yu et al. Bromaterials 12 (1991) March, No 2, page 119-120 discloses the use of polyurethane hydrogels formed of polyethylene glycol (number average molecular weight of 5830) and a low molecular weight polypropylene glycol (molecular weight 425) and a diisocyanate.   Patent specification US 4,202,880 discloses the production of polyurethanes n-om polyethylene glycol (molecular weight 400-20,000), an alkaline glycol contaimng from 2-6 carbon atoms and a diisocyanate. Patent specification US 4,235,988 is a similar disclosure, although the preferred PEG range is 600-6,000.<br>
 <br>
An object of certain embodiments of the present invention is to provide a bydrophilic, low-swelling, linear polyurethane polymer of the aforementioned type. Another object 13 to eohance the procesaabihty of the polymer to allow the use of conventional melt processing techniques e.g extrusion, compression moulding and injection moulding, as well as different type of solvents in the polymer processing and drug loading steps.<br>
The present invention is based on the synthesis of low-swelling linear polyurethanes having suitable melt processing properties for drug loading, as well as good drug release characteristics, which are prepared by reactmg a polyethylene glycol with a diol or other difunctional compound and a difunctional isocyanate.<br>
In particular, the present invention provides a water-sweDable linear polymer obtainable by reacting together.<br>
a polyethylene oxide of number average molecular weight less than 4000; an aliphatic diol; and a difunctional isocyanate<br>
The linear low-swelling polymer produced is swellable in water to a certain degree, depending upon the ratio of the three components (a), (b) and (c), for example &amp;om 1% up to 200% (e.g. 20 to 100%), thus obtaioing better control oyer the release of phamaaceutically active agents than from the loiown high-swelling linear palymer.  The polymers of the invention may also swell in other solvents (in which they are insoluble) such as ethanol or isopropyl alcohol. The linear polymer of the present invention is also soluble in certain organic solvents, such as dichloromethane, 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and tettahydrofiiran, which allows the polymer to be dissolved and cast into films or coatings. It also allows the loading of thermally unstable active agents with<br>
 <br>
poor water solubility but which ace soluble in organic solvent, to be loaded into the polymer<br>
Polyethylene oxides contain the repeating  unit (-CH2CH2O-) and are conveniently prepared by the stepwise addition of ethylene oxide to a compound containing a reactive hydrogen atom. Polyethylene glycols are prepared by the addition of ethylene oxide to ethylene glycol to produce a difunctional polyethylene glycol structure HO(CH2CH2O)nH wherein n is an integer of varying size depending on the molecular weight of polyethylene oxide. Polyethylene oxides used in (ho present invention are generally linear polyethylene glycols i.e. diols having an  equivolent weight of 200 to 4000 g/mol<br>
The difunctional aliphatic diol is reactive with the difunctional isocyanate, and is typically at least a C6 or C8 dial.   Diols in the range C5 to C20, preferably C8 to C15 are preferred. Thus, decane diol has been found to produce particularly good results. The diol may be a saturated or unsaturated diol. Branched diols may be used bat straight chain diols are preferred  The tvvo hydroxy groups are generally on terminal carbon atoms, Thus, preferred diols include 1,6-hexancdiol, 1,10-decauediol, 1J2-dodecanediol and 1,16-hexadecanediol,<br>
The difunctional isocyanate is generally one of the conventional diisocyanates, such as dicyclohexylmethane-4,4-diisocyanate, diphenylmethane-4,4-dirsocyanate, 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate etc.<br>
The ratio of the components (a) to (b) to (c) (in terms of equivalent weights) is generally in the range 0.01-0.1 to 1 to 1.01-1.1   Of course, the skilled man through reasonable experimentation would determine the best ratio of ingredients to give the desired properties. The amount of component (c) is generally equa  to the combined amounts of (a) and (b) to provide the correct storchiometry<br>
 <br>
Preferably, the amount of hydrophilic PEG units is less than 50 wt%, preferably less than 40 wt%, and often leas than 30 wt%, Also, the amount of hydrophobic diol preferably exceeds 20 wt%, 30 wt% or 40 wt%. The diisocyanate is generally 20-50 wt% of the polymer.<br>
The invention also provides a method of producing the polymer, which comprises melting and drying the polyethylene oxide together with the aliphatc diol at a teirtperature of 85°C to 100°C under vacuum; and then adding the difunctional  socyanate,<br>
The polymers are generally produced by melting and drying polyethylene glycol together with the difunctional compound along with a typical polyuretbane catalyst, e.g feme chloride, tnethyleae diamine (DABCO) and/or tm(n) octoate, at a temperature of 85" to 100°C (eg, 95°C) and under vacuam to remove excess moisture before the diisocyanate, e,g DMDI or HMDI is added thereto.   The reaction mixture is then poured into moulds and reacted for a specified time.   Thus, the polymer is initially formed as a solid.   However, the linear polymers of the present invention are soluble in certain organic solvents such as those given in Table 2 (though not all polymers are soluble in all solvents). This allows the polymer to be dissolved and the resultant solution cast into films. The solution may also he employed for coating grunules, tablets etc., in order to modify their release properties. Alternatively, the solution can be poured into a non-solvent so as to precipitate polymer/active microparticles. In addition, the polymer can be ground, chopped, pelletised and melted using conventional techniques for processing thermoplastic polymers.<br>
Thus, the invention also provides controlled release compositions comprising the linear polymer together with an active agent. Any suitable type of plastic processing equipment, e.g extruder, injection moulding machine, and melt mixer can be used for<br>
 <br>
mixing polymer and drug and forming or reshaping them into any type of drug loaded format, The active agent may be a phannaceutically active agent for human or animal use. It may also be any other agent where sustained release properties (e,g, algicides, fertilisers etc.) are required. The pharmaceutical solid dosage forms include suppositonea, rings and pessaries for vagmal use, buccal inserts for oral administration, patches for transdermal administration etc. These dosage forms are generally administered to the patient, retained in place until delivery of active agent has occurred and the polymer is then removed.<br>
The polymer may also be used for implants, which remain in the body; or for coating such implants (e.g. stents).<br>
The linear polymer of the present invention is an amphiphilic thermoplastic polymer and is thus suitable for the uptake of hydrophilic, hydrophobic, low and high molecular weight pharmaceutically active agents (up to and exceeding a molecular weight of 3000 e.g 10,000. 50,000, 100,000 or even up to 200,000) Generally, the molecular weight of the active agent is in the range 200 to 20,000. A wide variety of water-soluble pharmaceutically active substances such as those listed in patent specification. EP001 6652 may thus be incorporated. Furthermore, the linear polymers of the present invention may be loaded with phannaceutically active agents, winch are poorly water-soluble, provided that these can be dissolved in a common solvent with the polymer. The resultant solution can then be cast mto any desired solid forms. In addition, the linear polymers of the present invention may be extrusion loaded or melt mixed. with pharmaceutically active agents, which are thermally stable at the polymer processing temperature.<br>
The release time of the present polymers may exceed 200, 400, 800, 1200 mins or even longer —for substantially complete release of available active agent.<br>
 <br>
Pharmaceutically active agents of particular interest include Proteins e,g, interferon alpha, beta and gamma, insulin, human growth hormone, leuprolide; Benzodiazepines e.g. midazolam; Anti-migraine agents e.g. triptophans, ergotamine and its derivatives; Anti-infective agents e.g. azoles, bacterial vaginosis, Candida; and opthalmic agents e.g. iatanoprost<br>
