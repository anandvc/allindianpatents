"DYEING  MACHINE  WITH  IMPROVED  BATH  DISTRIBUTION  AND<br>
CIRCULATION"<br>
This invention relates to a dyeing machine for textile<br>
materials in the form of yarn in cones or skeins, flock,<br>
combed ribbons, stuffing, tow et cetera, hence material<br>
before weaving.<br>
In the prior art, dyeing machines for such materials are<br>
known and consist of a sealed container designed to be<br>
filled with a dye bath in which is received a support for<br>
the textile material immersed in the bath. The bath is<br>
circulated by a circulation pump that establishes a flow<br>
of  bath though the  textile material  placed on the<br>
support.<br>
For example in the case of material wound on spools, the<br>
spools are stacked on rods so that the hollow inner<br>
nucleus of the spools realizes a duct for distribution of<br>
the fluid to have a radial flow through the spools.<br>
The dyeing or treatment cycle calls for a thermal cycle<br>
(raising and lowering of bath temperature) dependant on<br>
the type of fiber and the class of coloring processed and<br>
the introduction of coloring and various products. This<br>
leads to a variation in the bath volume caused by<br>
addition and swelling due to the increase or decrease in<br>
temperature.<br>
For this purpose there is usually provided an expansion<br>
device designed to contain the addition of products and<br>
the swelling of the bath resulting from the temperature<br>
changes. The device can be constructed from an external<br><br>
2<br>
expansion vessel (older technology) with a static pump<br>
pressurization device. In this case, the autoclave is<br>
completely full of bath. The surplus bath is sent through<br>
a spillway pipe placed on the high part of the autoclave<br>
to the non-pressurized external expansion vessel after<br>
having passed through a cooler that lowers its<br>
temperature to less than 95Â°C. The bath is then pumped<br>
back to the inside of the autoclave by means of a static<br>
pump that sucks from the lower part of the expansion<br>
vessel. Pressure is obtained by partializing delivery to<br>
the expansion vessel.<br>
In accordance with a more modern technology the expansion<br>
device can also be realized with an internal expansion<br>
zone using a compressed-air cushion pressurization<br>
device. The autoclave is flooded only to the level<br>
necessary to cover the textile material to be treated.<br>
There is a space above occupied by compressed air. This<br>
space is reduced depending on the introduction of<br>
products and swelling of the bath resulting from a<br>
temperature increase. The products to be introduced are<br>
placed in a small external tank and pumped into the<br>
autoclave by means of an introduction pump capable of<br>
overcoming the internal pressure of the autoclave.<br>
In all cases the bath consists of a solution of color in<br>
water. At the beginning of the dyeing process the bath<br>
is at its maximum concentration. The dyeing process<br>
consists of reducing the affinity of the color for the<br>
water (vector) while at the same time increasing the<br>
affinity of the color for the fiber. This must be done<br><br>
3<br>
gradually while acting on the pilot parameters of the<br>
process (temperature, pH et cetera) while placing the<br>
color in intimate contact with the fiber and continually<br>
renewing the solution in contact with the fiber, a<br>
solution that depletes the color (decreasing the color<br>
concentration) as the color passes from the bath to the<br>
fiber.<br>
Bath circulation is entrusted only to the flow induced<br>
through the material to be processed by the circulation<br>
pump. It thus proves logical to force circulation to the<br>
maximum through the material to be dyed so as to increase<br>
the probability of a uniform distribution in the<br>
different points of the fiber and the replacement while<br>
always bringing new color into contact with the fiber to<br>
compensate for the color already absorbed, circulation<br>
increase increases heat transfer (hence of the energy<br>
required by the chemical-physical dyeing process) from<br>
the exchanger to the fiber, a transfer that uses the<br>
water as vector.<br>
To increase the intensity of circulation and thus the<br>
flow of the pump, it is necessary to increase the pump<br>
discharge head (to pass more water through the textile<br>
material it is necessary to push more). One problem is<br>
that it is necessary to remember the delicate nature of<br>
the textile material, a delicate nature that must be<br>
respected to avoid deterioration of the physical<br>
appearance (loss of feel, pilling et cetera). When<br>
treating delicate materials or delicate garments (flock,<br>
fine wool tops, yarns of cashmere,  silk,  et cetera)<br><br>
4<br>
circulation must be drastically limited while accepting<br>
reduction of the advantages of the high circulation and<br>
therefore taking more risks as regards the quality of the<br>
dyeing process.<br>
Reducing circulation, the movement of the bath is however<br>
reduced to the zone inside the material and the bordering<br>
zone on the outside. Far from the external surface the<br>
bath tends to not be involved in the circulation and<br>
hence to not be exchanged.<br>
It was found that in these zones there can be stagnation<br>
of the bath with temperature tending to stratify with<br>
resulting non-uniform distribution of temperature at the<br>
different points of the bath. This means bath zones with<br>
different energy levels and hence different coefficients<br>
of diffusion and absorption of the color by the fiber. In<br>
addition there is unsteady concentration of color in the<br>
water. In the zones slightly involved by circulation<br>
(weak to respect the physical characteristics of the<br>
fiber) the concentration remains higher than in the zones<br>
in contact with the fiber surface. This produces a slow<br>
dyeing process, possible disuniformity and failure to<br>
reach the point of color; if part of the color remains in<br>
the water the fiber will be clearer than desired.<br>
The general purpose of this invention is to remedy the<br>
above mentioned shortcomings by making available a dyeing<br>
machine holding the concentration and temperature of the<br>
bath satisfactorily uniform and at the same time allowing<br>
treatment with excellent dyeing results of even very<br>
delicate material without excessive stress caused by the<br><br>
5<br>
dyeing process.<br>
In view of this purpose it was sought to provide in<br>
accordance with this invention a dyeing machine for<br>
textile material such as yarns, pre-yarn ribbons, flocks,<br>
and similar not of cloth, comprises a sealed container<br>
designed to be filled with a dye bath and in which is<br>
received a support for the textile material immersed in<br>
the bath with bath-passing circulation means being<br>
connected to establish a bath flow through the textile<br>
material on the support an characterized in that it<br>
comprises other external circulation means that realize<br>
an additional bath movement in the bath part in the<br>
container that is outside the textile material.<br>
To clarify the explanation of the innovative principles<br>
of this invention and its advantages compared with the<br>
prior art there is described below with the aid of the<br>
annexed drawings possible embodiments thereof by way of<br>
non-limiting examples applying said principles. In the<br>
drawings:<br>
FIG 1 shows a diagrammatic cross-sectioned side elevation<br>
view of a first example of an embodiment of a dyeing<br>
machine realized in accordance with this invention,<br>
FIG 2 shows a diagrammatic cross-sectioned side elevation<br>
view of a second example of an embodiment of a dyeing<br>
machine realized in accordance with this invention,<br>
FIGS 3 and 4 show cross-sectioned diagrammatic transversal<br>
and plan views respectively of a third example of an<br>
embodiment of a dyeing machine realized in accordance with<br>
this invention,<br><br>
6<br>
FIGS 5 and 6 show cross-sectioned diagrammatic transversal<br>
and plan views respectively of a third example of an<br>
embodiment of a dyeing machine realized in accordance with<br>
this invention, and<br>
FIG 7 shows a diagrammatic cross-sectioned side elevation<br>
view of another example of an embodiment of a dyeing<br>
machine realized in accordance with this invention.<br>
With reference to the figures, FIG 1 shows a first<br>
embodiment of a textile material dyeing machine, designated<br>
as a whole by reference number 10. In particular the<br>
machine shown is the type called 'vertical' (with mainly<br>
vertical extension and upper closing door) and designed for<br>
the dyeing of material wound generically in spools or<br>
cones. This material can be for example yarn, pre-yarn<br>
ribbon, stuffing et cetera. The cones can be rigid or<br>
compressed.<br>
The machine comprises a pressurized container 11 designed<br>
to be filled up to level 12 with a special liquid making up<br>
the dye bath. In the container is received a material-<br>
holder or support 13 (removable by hoisting) to support the<br>
textile material that is to be immersed in the bath. In the<br>
example shown the support comprises a base 14 from which<br>
project vertically rods 15 (arranged for example in a<br>
circle) for axial support of the textile material<br>
generically wound in spools 16. Passing circulation means<br>
17 are connected to obtain bath flow radially traversing<br>
the spools inserted axially and blocked on the rods. To<br>
achieve this, the hollow nucleus of the spools constitutes<br>
in fact a duct for distribution of dye fluid that comes<br><br>
7<br>
into the spool nucleus at the base of the stack through the<br>
base 14 which is in turn connected to the recirculation<br>
pump 17. The pump 17 has its other end connected in an<br>
appropriate zone in the container. Along the path between<br>
the pump and the container there is advantageously provided<br>
a heat exchanger 18 for heating requirements of the known<br>
dyeing process. The pump can be advantageously operated<br>
alternatively to establish a flow from the inside to the<br>
outside of the spools or vice versa.<br>
The machine also comprises other bath circulation means<br>
19 that realize an additional bath movement in the bath<br>
part in the container which is outside the textile<br>
material. In the particular case of the machine of FIG 1,<br>
the movement is produced in the bath in which the spools<br>
are immersed.<br>
As may be seen in FIG 1, the external circulation means<br>
comprise motorized propellers for bath agitation. For a<br>
satisfactory mixing, with two propellers one propeller<br>
can be arranged near one upper end of the bath (immersed<br>
near the free upper surface) and another propeller near<br>
the bath bottom. The two propellers are also placed on<br>
diametrically opposed walls of the container.<br>
FIG 2 shows a first variant embodiment of the dyeing<br>
machine in accordance with this invention. For ease of<br>
description, members similar to those of FIG 1 are<br>
designated with the same numbers as in FIG 1 increased<br>
by 100.<br>
There is thus a dyeing machine 110 comprising a container<br>
111 which is filled up to level 112 with dye bath. A<br><br>
8<br>
support 113 fitted with a base 114 and rods 115 supports<br>
the stacks of spools 116. In the embodiment of FIG 2 the<br>
means 117 for passing circulation of the liquid through<br>
the spools are realized by means of a piston of adequate<br>
volume powered with reciprocal motion to generate the<br>
alternating internal-external flow and vice versa through<br>
the cones. This is possible since the liquid near the<br>
cones is changed thanks to the external movement of the<br>
bath obtained by the external movement means 119. In the<br>
embodiment of FIG 2 these means are realized by a pump<br>
119. Along the circuit there can also be provided heat<br>
exchange means 118.<br>
The pump 119 has suction and delivery arranged in two<br>
distant zones of the container advantageously with one<br>
near the surface of the liquid and one near the bottom.<br>
As shown by way of example in broken lines, suction and<br>
delivery mouths need not be realized on the container<br>
walls but can even be prolonged to reach preferred zones<br>
for example to avoid the formation of pockets or dead<br>
zones. The suction and delivery mouths can even be more<br>
than one distributed inside the container.<br>
FIGS 3 and 4 show another embodiment of a dyeing machine<br>
in accordance with this invention. Again for ease of<br>
description, members similar to those of FIG 1 are<br>
designated by the same numbers increased by 200. The<br>
machine, designated as a whole by reference number 210,<br>
is the type termed 'horizontal', that is with pressurized<br>
container 210 extending effectively along a horizontal<br>
axis and has side closing for extraction of the material<br><br>
9<br>
holder 213. The machine is loaded up to level 212 and can<br>
also comprise a rear expansion zone 220.<br>
The material holder 213 (sliding horizontally for removal<br>
from container) comprises a base 214 from which rise<br>
parallel rows of rods 215 for spools of material. The<br>
fluid circulation system through the material is similar<br>
to that shown in FIG 1 with a pump 217 that sends to or<br>
takes from the fluid or a passage formed by the nucleus<br>
of the spools an that is connected to the interior of the<br>
container to realize closed circulation. An exchanger 218<br>
can also be provided.<br>
The external circulation means of the bath comprise one or<br>
more powered propellers 219. As may be seen from a<br>
comparison of FIGS 3 and 4, the propellers are<br>
advantageously arranged near the two ends of the container<br>
and on two opposing sides.<br>
FIGS 5 an 6 show another embodiment (with numbers of<br>
members similar to those of FIG 1 increased by 300) in<br>
which the machine 310 has a horizontal container 311 that<br>
receives a material holder 313 with base 314 and rods 315<br>
to support the material wound in cones or skeins 316 that<br>
is covered by the bath reaching level 312. A side<br>
expansion chamber 32 0 can be provided. The machine<br>
provides a flow through the material by means of a pump<br>
317 (with exchanger 318 along the path), bath circulation<br>
means outside the material by propellers 319 and a pump<br>
321. The flow of the propellers and that of the pump 321<br>
are crossed meaning that the propellers are arranged at<br>
opposite ends of the container and on walls opposite each<br><br>
10<br>
other and opposed at delivery and suction of the pump.<br>
This way, the external circulation can be 'modulated'<br>
with greater precision depending on necessities by<br>
starting only the propellers, only the pump or both.<br>
FIG 6 also shows the use of an additional exchanger 323<br>
on the recirculation duct so as to avoid cooling of the<br>
bath because of the path outside the container.<br>
FIG 7 shows another embodiment 410 of a machine in<br>
accordance with this invention comprising a vertical<br>
container 411 with a material holder 413 that is immersed<br>
in the bath 412. The material holder comprises a base 414<br>
and a pierced basket 421 that receives the loose material<br>
(for example, flock). A pump 417 possibly with an<br>
exchanger 418 produces a flow between the inside and the<br>
outside of the basket. Advantageously, to distribute this<br>
flow in the basket, the basket comprises a central<br>
pierced duct 422 connected to the pump while the other<br>
side of the pump is connected to a zone of the bath<br>
outside the basket.<br>
The external circulation means are represented by<br>
staggered powered propellers 419.<br>
It is now clear that the preset purposes have been<br>
achieved. The external circulation means of the bath<br>
(meaning by external the part of the bath outside the<br>
material or the container of the material through which<br>
the bath is normally circulated) keep an adequate<br>
uniformity of concentration of color and temperature while<br>
impeding local impoverishment of the bath caused by<br>
absorption of coloring by the textile material. In other<br><br>
11<br>
words, the bath is exchanged on the yarn surface. Since<br>
the homogenization effect is obtained by external means,<br>
the circulation means through the material can also<br>
produce a very bland flow such as to not subject even the<br>
most delicate of the dyed materials to mechanical stress.<br>
For example, even in case of spools consisting of merely<br>
pressed pre-yarn ribbon, the material of the ribbon is not<br>
dispersed while still assuring excellent dye uniformity.<br>
Naturally the above description of an embodiment applying<br>
the innovative principles of this invention is given by<br>
way of non-limiting example of said principles within the<br>
scope of the exclusive right claimed here. For example,<br>
in the various embodiments shown, the propellers and the<br>
pump can be freely exchanged as necessary just as<br>
vertical or horizontal containers can be realized. In<br>
particular, the machine with basket can also be realized<br>
horizontal. Even the internal or external piston<br>
circulation means can be used on machines different from<br>
that of FIG 2 especially when a very low flow is required<br>
through the material to be dyed. For better control of<br>
the agitation flow the external circulation means can be<br>
advantageously controlled by electric motors connected to<br>
control means consisting of known power inverters. This<br>
way, the speed of the external circulation means can be<br>
changed even depending on the delicacy of the material to<br>
be dyed. In addition, the heat exchangers can be inside<br>
or outside the container or both. The container can also<br>
have external expansion and hence be without vault with<br>
compressed air.<br><br>
