				<td>The present invention relates to a sliding door system.<br>
The invention concerns a sliding door system for a vehicle with a vehicle body having a door opening and a sliding door, comprising a guide rail which can be mounted on or in the vehicle body in the proximity of the door opening, a guide element which is displaceable along the- guide rail and which is connected to the sliding door by way of a holding arm, a line receiving means of pivotably interconnected members for receiving and guiding electric lines from a connection on the vehicle body to a connection on the sliding door, wherein the line receiving means is guided in a guide device.<br>
A sliding door system of that kind is known from EP 1 010 558 A2. Here in its front region, that is to say which is directed towards the front of the vehicle, the sliding door has upper and lower holding arms, on each of which a respective guide roller is mounted as a guide element. The guide rollers-are displaceable in a guide rail on the vehicle body above the door opening and below the door opening respectively. In order to move the sliding door out of the door opening when it is opened and to move it into -tkÂ© door opening when it is closed, the guide rails are curved toWaTffs The interior of the vehicle at their forwardly facing ends.<br>
As can also be seen from the above-identified publication, arranged . in parallel relationship with the lower guide rail for the roller mounted on the lower holding arm, at the side towards the door opening, is a channel with a line receiving means guided therein. The line receiving means is in the form of an energy guide chain comprising pivotably interconnected chain link members and has a lower run which at its end is connected fixedly to the vehicle body, and an upper run which at its end is fixed to the lower holding arm for the sliding door. The upper and lower runs are connected together by a curved region of the energy guide chain.<br>
The energy guide chain known from the above-identified publication serves for receiving and guiding lines from a connection on the vehicle body to a connection on the lower holding arm of the sliding door in order to<br>
both sides of the holding arm or is fixed to the holding arm and with which the holding arm is displaceable along the guide rail in both directions in dependence on the direction of rotation of the motor.<br>
The pulling device can have two cable runs which are each connected to a respective side of the holding arm and which extend along the guide rail and are deflected at the ends thereof to a drive unit which, in dependence on the direction of rotation of the motor, exerts a pulling force on one cable run or the other.<br>
On the other hand the pulling device can be formed by a toothed belt drivable by the motor by way of a pinion.<br>
The toothed belt can either be fixed in the form of an endless belt to a location on the holding arm or it can be connected at its ends to the holding arm and guided by deflection rollers.<br>
In another embodiment, the drive device can have a motor arranged in the sliding door, a pinion driven by the motor and arranged on the holding arm, and a row of teeth which mesh with the pinion and which extend along the guide rail.<br>
If the guide rail and the guide device are arranged externally at the vehicle body in the region over which the sliding door is pushed, then, to assist with guiding the sliding door, there is preferably provided at least one second guide rail on the vehicle body in the upper and/or lower region along the door opening, along which rail there is displaceable a second guide element which is connected by way of a second holding arm to the front region of the sliding door, that is to say the region which is directed towards the front of the vehicle.<br>

Figure 30 shows a plan view of the sliding door system shown in Figure 28.<br>
As can be seen from Figures 1 through 6 the sliding door system illustrated therein includes a first guide rail 1 in which a first guide element 2 is arranged displaceably in the longitudinal direction of the guide rail 1. The guide rail 1 is arranged in the outside of a vehicle body (not shown in the drawing) in the proximity of a door opening which is closable by a sliding door 3. As can be seen in particular from Figures 4 through 6 the guide rail 1 is arranged in the region of the vehicle body in the proximity of the door opening, over which the sliding door 3 is pushed when it is opened and closed.<br>
A holding arm 5 is mounted to the sliding door 3 by way of a pivot 4 with a vertical pivot axis. At its other end the holding arm 5 is pivotably<br><br>
connected by way of a pivot 6 with an also vertical pivot axis, to the guide element 2.<br>
As shown in Figures 1 through 3 the holding arm 5, when the sliding door 3 is in the closed condition, extends substantially in the longitudinal direction of the first guide rail 1 towards the sliding door 3. When the sliding door 3 is opened it is guided outwardly out of the door opening along a curved path of movement, in which case the holding arm 5 is pivoted outwardly, as shown in Figures 4 through 6.<br>
To assist with guidance for the sliding door 3, there is provided a second guide rail 7 in the vehicle body in the lower region along the door opening, as shown in the right-hand region in Figures 1 through 6. The front region of the second guide rail 7, that is to say the region which is directed towards the front of the vehicle, is curved towards the interior of the vehicle in order to guide the sliding door out of the door opening when it is opened and to guide it into the door opening when it is closed. A second guide element 8 is arranged in the second guide rail 7 displaceably along the guide rail 7. The second guide element 8 is connected by way of a holding arm 9 to the front region of the sliding door 3, that is to say the region which is directed towards the front of the vehicle. The second guide rail 7 is of a groove-shaped configuration and is open upwardly. The second guide element 8 has a roller which is displaceable in the groove-shaped guide rail 7.<br>
A third guide rail which is of a corresponding configuration to the second guide rail 7 is provided in the upper region of the vehicle body above the door opening (not shown in the drawing). The third guide rail assists with guidance of the sliding door 3 by way of a holding arm (corresponding to the second holding arm 9) which is mounted in the upper front region of the sliding door and on which a third guide element (corresponding to the second guide element 8) in the form of a roller is arranged, being displaceable in the third guide rail.<br>
The first guide rail 1 is of a channel-shaped configuration, with an opening which extends in the longitudinal direction and outwardly, through<br><br>
which the first holding arm 5 engages. The top side 10 of the guide rail 1 is of a configuration in the form of an inverted U.<br>
The first guide element 2 is in the form of a carriage which is displaceable with a lower roller 11 on the bottom 12 of the channel-shaped guide rail 1. The carriage also has two lateral guide rollers 13, 14 which are spaced at a spacing in the longitudinal direction of the guide rail 1 and which extend along the inside walls of the lateral limbs of the U-shaped top side 10. The first guide element 2 which is in the form of a carriage is thus displaceable in the guide rail 1 without the risk of tilting by virtue of the forces which are exerted laterally by the holding arm 5 when the sliding door 3 is opened and closed.<br>
As can further be seen from Figures 1 through 6, a line receiving means 15 is arranged in the first guide rail 1, displaceably along the guide rail 1. The line receiving means 15 comprises members 16 which are connected together pivotably about horizontal pivot axes. The members 16 have side portions (not shown in detail in the drawing) and upper and lower transverse limbs connecting same, and are pivotable relative to each other by pivot connections at the oppositely disposed end regions of their side portions. The pivotal connection of the members 16 can also be afforded by other known means, such as for example flexurally elastic connections between the members.<br>
The line receiving means which is thus in the form of a chain serves to receive and guide electric lines from a connection on the vehicle body to a connection in the sliding door 3, wherein the lines provide electrical energy to electric devices provided in the sliding door 3.<br>
At one end, the line receiving means 15 which is in the form of an energy guide chain is provided with an end member 17 connected by way of a connecting element to the first guide element 2 which is in the form of the carriage. When the guide element 2 is displaced, the line receiving means 15 is reciprocated along the guide rail 1. In that situation, the part of the line receiving means 15, which is displaced in the guide rail 1, slides on the bottom 12 of the channel-shaped guide rail 1 and is guided laterally by its side wall 19 which faces towards the interior of the vehicle.<br><br>
The lines 20 which issue from the end member 17 of the line receiving means 15 are passed by way of the holding arm 5 to a connection in the sliding door 3.<br>
In Figures 1 through 6 but also the other embodiments, the region 15a of the line receiving means 15, which is arranged adjacent to the guide element, and here even the region thereof which extends as far as the deflection region 21, will move directly in the track of the guide element.<br>
It can further be seen from Figures 1 through 6 that the line receiving means 15 issues at the end of the first guide rail 1, which is remote from the sliding door 3, and is guided upwardly by a deflection device 21 into a further guide housing 22. The region of the line receiving means 15, which extends by way of the deflection device 21 into the guide housing 22, forms a first run 23 which is adjoined by a substantially semicircular arc 24 which in turn is adjoined by a second run 25. At the free end of the second run 25 the line receiving means 15 is fixed to the guide housing 22 by an end member 26 and is thus arranged stationarily with respect to the vehicle body.<br>
As in particular a comparison of Figures 2 and 5 shows, the guide housing 22 serves as a reservoir into which the line receiving means 15 can extend to a greater or lesser extent when the guide element 2 which is connected to the sliding door 3 and which is in the form of the carriage is displaced, with the adjoining part of the line receiving means 15, in the first guide rail 1.<br>
The guide housing 22 is arranged in a compact fashion in a pillar of the vehicle body. In that way the line receiving means 15 with the deflection device 21 and the perpendicular guide housing 22 can also be subsequently installed in a vehicle body with a first guide rail 1 for guiding a holding arm 5 connected to the sliding door 3.<br>
As will be apparent from the drawing the electric lines 20 which issue from the end member 26 are connected by a plug 27 to a connection on the vehicle body.<br>
A drive device (not shown in the drawing) is provided for moving the sliding door 3 along the guide rails 1 and 7. The drive device has a<br><br>
reversible motor arranged in the vehicle body and a pulling device which is driven by the motor and which is connected in the longitudinal direction of the guide rail 1 to the guide element 2 in the form of the carriage, and with which the guide element 2 is displaceable along the guide rail 1 in both directions in dependence on the direction of rotation of the motor. The pulling device has two cable runs 28 and 29 which are each connected to a respective side of the guide element 2 and which extend along the guide rail 1 and which are deflected at the ends thereof by deflection rollers (not shown) to a drive unit which, in dependence on the direction of rotation of the motor, applies a pulling force to one cable run 28, 29 or the other.<br>
At an end of the guide device (or also the guide rail), which is directed towards an end of the vehicle, towards the left and towards the tail of the vehicle in the Figures, there is provided a deflection region for the line receiving means 15, by which the line receiving means is deflected through a given angle into a given direction upon displacement in a direction towards the end of the vehicle, while connected to the deflection region is a channel-shaped guide in which the deflected portion of the line receiving means 15 extends in the form of a first run 23 which is adjoined by a substantially semicircular arc 24 of a predetermined radius while adjoining same is a second run 25, the end of which is stationarily connected to the vehicle body.<br>
The deflection region for the line receiving means 15 is here provided at the rear end of the guide rail, which is towards the tail of the vehicle.<br>
The means for deflection of the line receiving means 15 is the end of the passage-like or housing-like guide device, which end is directed towards an end of the vehicle and is provided by the deflection device 21. The end of the guide rail can be of a corresponding configuration. In that respect the passage-like or housing-like region of the guide device is arranged as a prolongation of the guide rail, and that can also apply to all other embodiments.<br>
Deflection of the first run of the line receiving means 15 at the end of the guide rail, which is directed towards an end of the vehicle, is effected in this case through about 90Â° (Figure 1), but it can also be through about<br><br>
180Â° (Figure 27). The curvature of the deflection of the first run at the end of the guide rail which is directed towards an end of the vehicle and the substantially semicircular deflection of the line guide device 15 between the first and second run are in this case in the same direction with respect to the longitudinal extent of the line guide device 15.<br>
Figures 7 through 12 show a further embodiment of a sliding door system in which, as a modification from the embodiment shown in Figures 1 through 6, the line guide device 15 which issues from the guide rail 1 at the side remote from the sliding door 3 is diverted downwardly through 90Â°. Therefore the guide housing serving as a reservoir for the line receiving means 15 extends downwardly from the deflection device 21 and can also be arranged in a space-saving fashion in a pillar of the vehicle body. The member at the free end of the second run 25 of the line receiving means is fixed to the guide housing 22 as in the first embodiment and is therefore arranged stationary with respect to the vehicle body. The electric lines 20 extending out of the end member can be connected by a plug 27 to a connection on the vehicle body.<br>
In other respects the sliding door system shown in Figures 7 through 12 corresponds to the sliding door system shown in Figures 1 through 6 so that reference is made to the foregoing description relating to Figures 1 through 6.<br>
The embodiment shown in Figures 13 through 18 of a sliding door system differs from the above-described embodiments in that the line receiving means 15 in the form of an energy guide chain is arranged lying in the guide rail 1 on the side, that is to say the pivot axes of the members 16 face in a vertical direction.<br>
In accordance with that arrangement of the line receiving means 15, as can be seen from Figures 13 through 18, the region of the line receiving means 15 which issues from the guide rail 1 at the end remote from the sliding door 3 is deflected in a horizontal plane, into the interior of the vehicle. The deflection device 21 and the guide housing serving as a reservoir for the line receiving means 15 are therefore arranged horizontally and can be installed at a suitable location on the vehicle body.<br><br>
In other respects the embodiment shown in Figures 13 through 18 does not differ from the above-discussed embodiments.<br>
The embodiment shown in Figures 19 through 24 substantially corresponds to the embodiment shown in Figures 1 through 6, with the difference that the first guide rail 30, at its end facing towards the closed sliding door 3, has a region 31 which is curved in a horizontal plane, towards the interior of the vehicle. The curved region 31 permits the sliding door 3 to be guided into the door opening by way of a holding arm 32 rigidly arranged on the guide element 2, when the sliding door 3 is closed, and out of the door opening when the sliding door 3 is opened.<br>
As can be seen from the arrangement of the deflection device 21 and the guide housing 22 serving as a reservoir for the line receiving means 15, the pivot axes of the members 16 of the line receiving means 15 face in a horizontal direction so that deflection of the line receiving means 15 into the guide housing 22 can take place vertically. In order to be able to follow the curvature of the curved region 31 of the guide rail 30 the line receiving means 15 must also be pivotable in a horizontal plane through an angle determined by the curvature, at least in its end region which is towards the guide element 2. Pivotability in the horizontal plane containing the pivot axes of the members 16 can be achieved by suitable structural measures in relation to the members 16.<br>
If a curved region 31 of the guide rail, which permits the holding arm 32 to be rigidly mounted to the guide element 2, is desired for a line receiving means 15 which is pivotable exclusively in the plane perpendicular to the pivot axes 16, the line receiving means 15 can be modified as follows.<br>
On the one hand, it can be provided that the line receiving means remains in a straight portion of the guide rail 30 in any position of the travel path. For that purpose, the end in question of the line receiving means 15 can be spaced by a connecting element extending in its longitudinal direction, from the guide element 2, in such a way that, when it is in the end position of the travel path, the end comes to a halt in the straight part of the guide rail 30.<br><br>
On the other hand the line receiving means 15 can be arranged lying on the side in the guide rail 30 so that the pivot axes of the members 16 extend in a vertical direction. The line receiving means 15 must then be deflected at the end of the guide rail 30 remote from the closed sliding door 3, in a horizontal direction, opposite to Figures 19 through 24. The deflection device 21 and the guide housing 22 serving as a reservoir for the line receiving means 15 are then to be arranged as shown in Figures 13 through 18.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figures 25 through 30, the guide rail 33 for the guide element 2 of the sliding door 3 is arranged in the lower region of the vehicle body along the door opening and the holding arm 34 is arranged at the front end region of the sliding door 3, which is directed towards the front of the vehicle.<br>
At its front end, the guide rail 33 has a curved region 35 which is directed towards the interior of the vehicle. In that way, when a holding arm 34 is mounted rigidly to the guide element 2, the sliding door 3 can be moved into the door opening when it is closed and out of the door opening when it is opened.<br>
So that the line receiving means 15 can extend into the curved region 35 of the guide rail 33 when the sliding door 3 is closed, it is arranged lying on the side in the guide rail 33, as can be seen in particular from Figures 27 and 30, so that the pivot axes of the members 16 are oriented vertically. In a corresponding fashion, deflection of the line receiving means 15 at the end of the guide rail 33 which is remote from the curved region 35 occurs in a horizontal plane, into the guide housing 22. As shown in Figures 27 and 30, in this embodiment the deflection is through 180Â° through a corresponding deflection device 36 so that the guide housing 22 serving as a reservoir for the line receiving means 15 is arranged parallel to the guide rail 33.<br><br>
