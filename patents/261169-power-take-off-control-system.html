POWER TAKE OFF CONTROL SYSTEM BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIOM<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a power take off (PTO) control system for a work vehicle equipped with an implement, and particularly to hydraulic control of a PTO clutch <br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
[0002]<br>
A tractor disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2006-11843, which is one example of a work vehicle, comprises a hydraulic multi-plate PTO clutch that is able to transmit and interrupt power to an implement coupled to a machine body {see C3 of FIGS. 3 and 4 of the abovementioned document}, a control valve for supplying hydraulic fluid to the PTO clutch {V4 of FIG. 7 of Patent Document 1), and a PTO clutch lever (43 of FIG. 7 of the abovementioned document) . A driver operates the control valve in the tractor by operating the PTO clutch lever. When hydraulic fluid is supplied to the PTO clutch, the PTO clutch enters an engaged state, and when hydraulic fluid is discharged from the PTO clutch, the PTO clutch enters a disengaged state.<br>
[0003]<br>
Coupling a variety of small- to large-size implements to the machine body allows the tractor to performing a variety of tasks.<br>
The weight of a driven part and the starting torque of a small-sized implement are comparatively low, and therefore even when the PTO clutch is moved to the engaged state and power is transmitted to the small-sized implement, the shock when a drive is initially provided to the small-sized implement is a comparatively small amount. In contrast, the weight of the driven part and the starting torque of a large-sized implement (for example, a<br><br>
large grass mower) are comparatively large, and therefore when the PTO clutch is moved to the engaged state and power is transmitted to the large-sized implement, the shock when a drive is initially provided to the large-sized implement is a comparatively great amount.<br>
SUM^4ARY OF THE INVEHTION<br>
[0004]<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a PTO control system which can cause a PTO clutch to be suitably operated in accordance with a variety oi implements in cases where any of a variety of implements is coupled to the machine body, and work is performed.<br>
In order to achieve the aforesaid object, the PTO control system according to the present invention, which  is intended for a work vehicle equipped with an implement, comprises a hydraulic multi-plate PTO clutch whereby power from the work vehicle is interruptibly transmitted to the implement; a control valve for adjusting an actuating pressure of the PTO clutch; a manually operable clutch operation tool for sending an operation instruction to the control unit; and a control unit for switching the PTO clutch from a disengaged state to an engaged state by controlling the control valve on the basis of target control characteristics in response to the operation instruction of the clutch operation tool.  The control unit has target control characteristics generating means for generating the target control characteristics, and target control characteristics setting means for setting the generated target control characteristics.<br>
[0005]<br>
According to the PTO control system, the target control characteristics used when the PTO clutch is switched from the disengaged state to the engaged state are generated by the target control characteristics generating means each time in response to the operation instruction of the clutch operation tool. Therefore, the<br><br>
hydraulic pressure of the PTO clutch is con-crolled according to the appropriate control characteristics based on a variety of implements and, when necessary, on the operational state of the clutch operation tool as well.<br>
[0006]<br>
According to one preferred embodiment of the present invention, pre-recorded control characteristics are employed and the target control characteristics are generated. This obviates the need to generate the entirety of the target control characteristics when the PTO clutch is shifted from the disengaged state to the engaged state, and enables pre-recorded control characteristics to bs partially employed.  Furthermore, new appropriate target control characteristics can be generated merely by modifying the pre-recorded control characteristics. The process load of the target control characteristics generating means can be reduced thereby.<br>
[0007]<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the target control characteristics generating means generates target control characteristics in accordance with the speed at which the clutch operation tool is operated. According to this embodiment, when the clutch operation tool is suddenly moved from the disengaged position to the engaged position, the PTO clutch is suddenly switched from the disengaged state to the engaged state. When the clutch operation tool is moved slowly from the disengaged position to the engaged position, the PTO clutch is slowly switched from the disengaged state to the engaged state.  For example, when a small-sized implement is coupled to the machine body, the operator can suddenly move the clutch operation tool from the disengaged position to the engaged position.  This causes the PTO clutch to be suddenly switched from the disengaged state to the engaged state, power to be quickly transm.itted, and the small-sized implement to be driven<br><br>
without delay. When a large-sized implement is coupled to the   body, the operator can move  the clutch operation tool slowly from the disengaged position to the engaged position.  This causes the PTO clutch to slowly switch from the disengaged state to the engaged state, power to be slowly transmitted, and shock to be reanimated.<br>
[0008]<br>
More specifically, according to a preferred embodiment, there is provided a sensor for detecting the operational behavior of the clutch operation tool/ and when the clutch operation tool is operated at a speed that is greater than a previously set control reference speed, the target control characteristics generating means uses pre-recorded control characteristics for the target control characteristics. This makes it possible to avoid the problem of the PTO clutch being switched from the disengaged state to the engaged state unusually quickly, and shock increasing when the implement is driven. The problem can be avoided even when the operator mistakenly moves  the clutch operation tool from the disengaged position to the engaged position unusually quickly.<br>
Other characteristics and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description of the embodiments taken with the accompanying drawings.<br>

[0010]<br>
A  tractor, which is one example of a work vehicle, is shown in FIG. 1. The tractor has right and left front wheels 1 that can be steered to the right and left, right and left rear wheels 2, an engine 3, a transmission casing 4, and an operator part 5. As can be understood from FIGS. 1 and 2, the power generated by the engine 3 is transmitted to the front wheels 1 and the rear wheels 2 via a hydrostatic continuously variable speed change device- (not shown) and a gearshift-type secondary speed change device (not shown) provided to the transmission casing 4. The power generated by the engine 3 can also be transmitted to a PTO shaft 7 provided to a rear part of the transmission casing 4, via a PTO speed change device {not shown) and a PTO clutch 6 provided to the transmission casing 4.<br>
[0011]<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, a top link 8 and right and left lower links 9 are supported on the rear part of the transmission casing 4 so as to be capable of moving upward and downward, a lift arm 11 that is pivotably driven by a hydraulic cylinder 10 is provided, and a connecting rod 12 spanningly connects the lift arm 11 to the right and left lower links 9. The top link 8 and the right and left lower links 9 are driven up and down by the hydraulic cylinder 10 and the lift arm 11. A variety of implements can be coupled to the top link 8 and the right and left lower links 9.<br>
[0012]<br>
In FIG. 1, a rotary cultivator device 13 (an implement) is coupled to ohe tractor at the top link 8 and<br><br>
the right and left lower links 9, and a transmission shaft 14 spanningly connects the PTO shaft 7 and the rotary cultivator device 13.  The power generated by the engine 3 is thereby able to be transmitted to the rotary cultivator device 13 via the PTO speed change device, the PTO clutch 5, the PTO shaft 7, and the transmission shaft 14.<br>
[0013]<br>
As shown in FIG. 2,   the PTO clutch 6 is a hydraulic multi-plate clutch. The clutch is changed to the engaged state as a result of hydraulic fluid being supplied, is biased to the disengaged state by a spring (not shown), and is changed to the disengaged state as a result of the hydraulic fluid being discharged.  There is provided an electromagnetic proportional control valve 15 via which hydraulic fluid-is supplied to and drained from the PTO clutch 6, and the hydraulic pressure behavior (control characteristics) of the control valve 15 is controlled by a control unit 19. As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, a PTO lever 17 (a clutch operating tool) and a setting switch 18 are provided to the right side of an operation seat 16 of the operation part 5.<br>
[0014]<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the PTO lever 17 is constructed so as to be capable of being manually moved between the engaged position and the disengaged position, and the operation position of the PTO lever 17 is input to the control unit 19. A pressure sensor 20 for detecting the actuating pressure P of the PTO clutch 5 is provided, and a value detected by the pressure sensor 20 is inputted to the control unit 19. A lever sensor 17a for detecting operational displacement of the PTO lever 17 is provided in order for the operational parameters of the PTO lever 17, e.g., the operating speed, to be calculated by the control unit 19. A signal outputted by the lever sensor 17a is input to the control unit 19. The setting switch li is of a dial type, and can be operated manually. The<br><br>
operation position of the setting switch ±6 is inDutted to the control unit 19.  Operating i:he setting switch iS causes a control reference speed VI described hereafter to be selected from between a high speed and a low speed.<br>
[0015]<br>
Operation tool operation parameter computing means 19A, target control characteristics generating means 1.9B, target control characteristics setting means 19C, hydraulic pressure control means 19D, and a control characteristics table 19E for storing predetermined reference control characteristics are provided to the control unit 19 as functional parts specifically relating to the present invention.  These functional parts are substantially realized using a computer program and a process data group associated therewith. The operation tool operation parameter computing means 19A calculates the operation parameters of the PTO lever 17; i.e., the operating position, operating speed, rate of change in operating speed, and the like, on the basis of the signal output from the lever sensor 17a.  The target control characteristics generating means 19B generates target control characteristics to be used as a target when the PTO clutch 6 is to be switched from the disengaged state to the engaged state^ on the basis of the operating parameters of the PTO lever 17 as calculated by the operation tool operation parameter computing means 19A. The target control characteristics setting means 19C sends the target control characteristics generated by the target control characteristics generating means 19B to the hydraulic pressure control means 19D, and sets the characteristics as a control target.  The hydraulic pressure control means 19D controls the control valve 15 while evaluating the signal from the pressure sensor 20, so as to switch the PTO clutch 6 from the disengaged state to the engaged state in accordance with the target control characteristics that have been set. The reference control<br><br>
characteris-ics stored in the control characteristics table 19E are retrieved as needed by the target control characteristics setting means 19C, and are employed when the target control characteristics are to be generated.<br>
[0016]<br>
The target control characteristics generating means 19B generates target control characteristics to be used as a target when the PTO clutch 6 is to be switched from the disengaged state to the engaged state, on the basis of the operating parameters that constitute the operational behavior of the PTO lever 17 as calculated by the operation tool operation parameter computing means 19A. Accordingly, the operational behavior of the PTO lever 17 and the behavior of the PTO clutch 6 when moving from the disengaged state to the engaged state are harmonized. As a result, PTO clutch control that provides exceptional maneuverability is attained.<br>
[0017]<br>
A specific example of the control occurring in the above-described PTO control system is described below using FIGS. 3 and 4.    FIG. 3 is a graph showing the relationship between the operating position of the PTO lever and the actuating pressure of the PTO clutch, and expresses one example of the control characteristics used as a target.  FIG. 4 is a flowchart of the hydraulic pressure control of the first embodiment.<br>
[0018]<br>
In this specific example, in a case in which the PTO lever 17 is moved from the disengaged position to the engaged position, the control changes according to whether the operating speed V, when the PTO lever 17 moves from the disengaged position to the engaged position, is faster or slower than the control reference speed VI.<br>
First, a check is performed to confirm whether or not the PTO lever 17 has been operated (#01).  If the PTO lever 17 has been operated ("Yes" branch of #01), a check is<br><br>
performed to confirm the direction in which the PTO lever 17 was moved; i.e., whether the direction is from the disengaged position to the engaged position, or from the engaged position to the disengaged position {#02}. When operation of the PTO lever 17 from the disengaged position to the engaged position is detected in step #02, the operating speed V of the PTO lever 17 is computed (#03). The operating speed V of the PTO lever 17 and the control reference speed VI set by the setting switch 18 are compared (#04).  If the operating speed V is less than the control reference speed VI ("yes" branch of #04), the control valve 15 is controlled (#05) so that the relationship between the operational position of the PTO lever 17 and the actuating pressure P of the PTO clutch 6 becomes the relationship shown by the solid line marked by the symbol Al in FIG. 3.  In the control process Al of step #05, when the PTO lever 17 is moved quickly, the actuating pressure P of the PTO clutch 6 accordingly is controlled to increase at a   comparatively high speed, as long as the operating speed V of the PTO lever 17 is lower than the control reference speed VI. Alternatively, if the PTO lever 17 is moved slowly, the actuating pressure ? of the PTO clutch 6 accordingly is controlled to increase at a comparatively low speed. When the PTO lever 17 is stopped and held at a desired operating position, the control for increasing the actuating pressure P of the PTO clutch 5 is temporarily suspended, and the actuating pressure P of the PTO clutch 6 is maintained along with the actuating pressure corresponding to the operational position of the PTO lever 17.<br>
[0019]<br>
In step #04, if the operating speed V is not less than the control reference speed VI {"no" branch of #04), the actuating pressure P of the PTO clutch 6 and a half clutch actuating pressure PI (previously set) are compared (#07).  In a case in which the actuating pressure P of the<br><br>
FTU clutcn b IS less than me halt clutch actuating pressure PI ("no" branch of #07), the process returns to step #05, and the control valve 15 is controlled in a manner based upon the solid line indicated by the symbol Al in FIG. 3.  In a case in which the actuating pressure P of the PTO clutch 6 is equal to or greater than the half clutch actuating pressure PI {"yes" branch of #07), the control valve 15 is controlled so that the relationship between the operational position of the PTO lever 17 and rhe actuating pressure P of the PTO clutch 6 becomes the relationship shown by the dotted line indicated by the symbol A2 in FIG. 3 (#07).  In the control process A2 of step #07, the actuating pressure P of the PTO clutch 5 corresponding to the operational position of the PTO lever 17 is lower in comparison with the control process A-1 of step #05 during an in crease in pressure from the half clutch actuating pressure PI to an engaged actuating pressure P2.  Therefore, the process of increasing the pressure from: the half clutch actuating pressure PI tends to be slow. Although this is not shown in the flowchart of FIG. 4, once the control process A2 commences, the inconvenience that occurs when the PTO lever 17 is operated at abnormally high speed can be eliminated by having the control process A2 continue up to the point that the PTO lever 17 reaches the engaged position, without the control process Al being performed. [0020]<br>
When operation of the PTO lever 17 from the engaged position to the disengaged position is detected in step #02, a check is performed to confirm whether the PTO lever 17 has been moved to the disengaged position or to an area regarded as the disengaged position (#08). When the PTO lever 17 has been moved to the disengaged position or to the area regarded as the disengaged position ("yes" branch of #08), the actuating pressure P of the PTO clutch 6 is reduced according to the previously set high speed control<br>
10<br><br>
characteristics, and a disengaging process for switching the PTO clutch 6 to the disengaged state is performed, regardless of the operating speed (#09).<br>
[0021]<br>
The control reference speed VI can be switched between high speed and low speed by operating the setting switch 18. When the control reference speed VI is switched to high speed, then as long as the PTO lever 17 is not moved at a fairly high speed from the disengaged position to the engaged position, the process will not diverge to step TF06 after the check performed in step #04.  It is therefore possible to control the actuating pressure P of the PTO clutch 6 harmonized with the speed at which the PTO lever 17 is operated.  This control is suitable when comparatively small-sized implements are attached.<br>
When the control reference speed VI is switched to low speed, then should the PTO lever 17 be operated even slightly quickly, the process will diverge to step #06. Accordingly, it is possible to impart a delayed sensation to the control of the actuating pressure P of the PTO clutch 6  achieved by operating the PTO lever 17.  This control is suitable when comparatively large-sized implements are attached.<br>
[0022]<br>
In the above embodiment, the PTO lever 17 is employed as a clutch operation tool; however, as shown in FIG. 5, right and left side brake pedals 21 can be employed as the clutch operation tool in place of the PTO lever 17.  In a tractor of such description, as shown in FIG. 5, a right side brake (not shown) capable of braking the right rear wheel 2, and a left side brake [not shown) capable of braking the left rear wheel 2 are provided; right and left side brake pedals 21 are provided to the lower right side of the front part of the operation part 5, the right side brake pedal 21 and the right side brake are mechanically connected via a connecting mechanism; and the left side<br>
11<br><br>
brake pedal 21 and the left side brake are mechanically connected via a connecting mechanisiii. As shown in FIG.   5, the left and right side brake pedals 21 are capable of being depressed to a canceling position and a limit position, and are biased to the canceling position, the depressed position of the right and left side brake pedals 21 is detected and inputted to the control unit 19. When the right and left side brake pedals 21 are in the canceling position, the right and left side brake are moved to the cancelled state; and when the right and left side brake pedals 21 are depressed from the canceling position, the right and left side brakes are moved to the braking side after a slight amount of play is experienced (in a state wherein the right and left side brakes are in the cancelled state) , and an adequate amount of brakirtg power applied by the right and left side brakes (braking power adequate for stopping the machine) is obtained at an intermediate position. As a result, the braking power of the right and left side brakes is maximized at the liinit position. The range between the canceling position and the intermediate position of the right and left side brake pedals 21 is set as the engaged position, and the limit position is set as the disengaged position. When the right and left side brake pedals 21 are depressed to the canceling position and the intermediate position (engaged position), the PTO clutch 5 is in the engaged state. When the right and left side brake pedals 21 start to descend from the intermediate position (engaged position) to the limit position (disengaged position), the PTO clutch 6 is promptly switched from the engaged state to the disengaged state, regardless of the speed at which the right and left side brake pedals 21 are depressed from the intermediate position (engaged position) to the limit position (disengaged position).  In a state in which the right and left side brake pedals 21 are depressed to the limit position (disengaged position; when the PTO clutch 6 is in<br>
12<br><br>
the disengaged state), when the right and left side brake pedals 21 begin to return to the intermediate position (engaged position) from the limit position (disengaged position), the speed at which the right and left side brake pedals 21 return from the limit position (disengaged position) to the intermediate position (engaged position) is detected. A  hydraulic pressure control is performed as shown in the flowchart of FIG. 5 on the basis of the speed at which the right and left side brake pedals 21 return from the limit position (disengaged state) to the intermediate position (engaged state), and the PTO clutch 6 is switched to the engaged state.<br>
The hydraulic pressure control depicted in the flowchart of FIG. 4 is also performed in a state in which the right and left side brake pedals 21 are both depressed at the same time (machine stopping operation), and in a state in which the right and left side brake pedals 21 both return at the same time (machine starting operation or the like). However, a hydraulic pressure control of such description is not performed in a state in which only one of the right and left side brake pedals 21 is depressed (when the inachine is making a turn or the like) or only one of the right and left side brake pedals 21 has subsequently returned. [0023]<br>
Plot Al (solid line) in the graph shown in FIG. 3 need not be in the form of a linear function (straight line), but may be in the form of a quadratic function (curving line) arching upward or downward. Similarly, the plot A2 (dashed line) may be set in the form of a quadratic function (curving line) arching upward or downward.<br>
[0024] In the above specific example, the target control characteristics generating means 19B generates the target control characteristics in response to the operation<br>
13<br><br>
parameters of the clutch lever 17 as computed by the operation tool operation parameter computing means 19A. However, alternatively, the target control characteristics may be generated by compiling the reference control characteristics stored in the characteristics table 19E. For example, the slope and shape of the reference control characteristics may be changed according to the operation parameters of the clutch lever 17, and used as the target control characteristics; and the slope and shape of the reference control characteristics may be changed according to the value set by the setting switch 18, and used as the target control characteristics.  Finally, the slope and shape of the reference control characteristics may be changed according to the operation parameters of the clutch lever 17 and the value set by the setting switch 18, and used as the target control characteristics. When a plurality of reference control characteristics is stored in the characteristics table 19E, an advantageous increase is obtained in terms of the variability of the control characteristics.<br><br><br>
