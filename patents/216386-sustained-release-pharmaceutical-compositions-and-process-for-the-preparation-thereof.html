We, CADILA HEALTHCARE LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Companies<br>
Act,  1956, of Zydus Tower, Satellite Cross Roads, Ahmedabad - 380 015, Gujarat,<br>
India,	<br>
The  followingl specification  describes  the  nature   of the  invention   and  the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to sustained release compositions and a<br>
process for the preparation thereof. More particularly, present invention relates<br>
to sustained release compositions in the form of tablets and a process for the<br>
preparation of such sustained release tablets. More particularly, the present<br>
invention relates to sustained release polymer coated tablets for use in treatment<br>
of asthma and other respiratory tract problems and a process for the preparation<br>
thereof. The present invention has particular application where one of the active<br>
ingredients is highly soluble in water and the other active ingredient, if any, is<br>
less soluble in water. One of the important applications envisaged by the present<br>
invention relates to a mixture of Xanthine bronchodilators used for treatment,<br>
inter alia of asthma, wherein one of the ingredients of the mixture is highly<br>
soluble in water and the other ingredient is less soluble in water.<br><br>
the invention<br>
Background of<br>
There are several methods by which a highly soluble pharmaceutical substance or al drug is administered to a patient. One of the important factors which has to be borne in mind while administering such drugs is to ensure that there is no sudden burst of the drug into the system (known as dosage dumping): Towards this end, slow release formulations of different drugs for various indications have been envisaged in the art. However, the problem has always been that of striking a balance between maintaining a proper bio¬availability of the drug into the system and controlling the release to avoid an overdose of the drug into the system. This has been equally true in case of drugs used for treatment asthma and COPD, for example mixtures of Xanthine bronchodilators comprising of Theophylline and Etofyllin used for treatment, inter alia of asthma, wherein one of the ingredients of the mixture is highly soluble in water and the other ingredient is less soluble in water.<br>
Both Etofyllin and Theophylline have been conventionally used in the treatment of asthma. There is a plethora of prior art on their use for the treatment of asthma and COPD. While, both Etophylline and Theophylline have<br>
demonstrated  excellent therapeutic activity in the treatment of asthma and<br><br>
COPD, their use has been limited due to the fact that the problem of striking a balance between a proper bio-availability of the drug into the system and controlling the release to avoid an overdose of the drug into the system remains.<br><br>
Description of prior art<br><br><br><br>
Despite the above mentioned problems numerous attempts have been made to formulate Theophylline as a tablet which releases an initial burst of Theophylline and thereafter releases it at an essentially constant rate. Conventionally various attempts have been made to achieve an initial burst of<br><br>
the active agent<br><br>
into the system followed by a constant rate of release but each<br><br>
suffers from some disadvantage or other. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,793,979 and 2,993,836 describe the use of waxes and lipids in the matrix tablet formulations. Ethylcellulose has been used in matrix formulations with polyethylene glycol (U.S. Pat. No. 3,039,933), with calcium stearate (U.S. Pat. No. 3,322,633) and with calcium sulfate (U.S. Pat. No. 3,632,739) among other ingredients. Other known matrix materials include Carboxyrnethylcellulose1, Cellulose acetate phthalate, Sodium Carboxyrnethylcellulose, gums, carbohydrates such as starch and sorbitol and the like.<br>
U.S. Pat No. 3,087,860 teaches the use of polymeric matrix materials<br>
such as methyl! acrylate methyl methacrylate, while, U.S. Pat. No. 2,987,445<br>
teaches the use  of various polymers and copolymers  such as polyethylene,<br>
Polymethyl  methacrylate   and  copolymers  of methyl  methacrylate  and  alkyl<br>
acrylates and the like.<br>
All of these various matrix formulations suffer from several disadvantages. The primary disadvantage is slowing of the release rate as a function of time. Other disadvantages include dumping of entire dose in the stomach, short life in the gastrointestinal tract, difficulty of manufacture, the inclusion of undesirable ingredients, etc<br>
In an attempt to overcome the above-mentioned disadvantages, US Patent<br>
No. 470284 teaches a long-acting matrix tablet formulation especially suited for<br>
acid    soluble   therapeutic    agents.    Accordingly,    this    patent    discloses    a<br><br>
pharmaceutical tablet which releases an initial burst of therapeutic agent and<br>
thereafter relea"ses the agent at an essentially constant rate comprising an acid<br>
soluble therapeutic agent in an insoluble matrix. The tablet essentially contains<br>
an acid insoluble base soluble pharmaceutically acceptable component selected<br>
from polymers jand fatty acids, a pharmaceutically acceptable, organic acid and<br>
at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. The component and the acid<br>
are  present in  an  amount  of from  about   1-25  percent by weight  of total<br>
composition.    <br>
This US Patent also suggests that the component may be a polymeric acid phthalate and the acid is a mono- or polycarboxylic acid, especially wherein the<br><br>
component is hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate and the acid is citric<br>
acid.<br>
While, this patent essentially is directed towards trimazosin as the therapeutic<br>
agent and ethyl Cellulose, hydrogenated vegetable oil or mixtures thereof as the<br>
excipient, it also broadly suggests that Theophylline may be the therapeutic<br>
agent.. This patent however does not provide any specific details of polymer<br>
coated sustained release Theophylline tablets.<br>
Therefore, in order to strike a proper balance between increased bio¬availability and sustained release there is a constant ongoing research using various excipierits.<br>
Thus, U.S. Pat. No. 4,797,286 describes sustained release, orally administrable pharmaceutical formulations employing GELUCIRE to make a carrier matrix. The compositions were prepared by admixing a pharmaceutically active agent with molten GELUCIRE and then filling capsules with the admixture.<br>
A sustained release formulation containing captopril is described in U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 5,433,951. Various GELUCIRE compositions were employed according<br>
i,<br>
to the experimental descriptions to make captopril formulations, which were then used to fill hard gelatin capsules.<br>
Sustained release compositions of Theophylline have been described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,988,679. In this case, triglycerides of a medium chain length alkanoic acid or distilled acetylated monoglycerides, a liquid, high HLB polyglyceryl ester and colloidal silicon dioxide were employed to make a liquid sustained release composition.<br>
US Patent No. 6,171,615 discloses a means of making effective sustained<br>
release pharmaceutical compositions of Theophylline for delivery in a gelatin<br>
capsule by employing certain GELUCIRE excipients in combination with certain<br>
nucleation enhancers. The pharmaceutical compositions described in this study<br>
are particularly stable with respect to dissolution upon ageing.<br>
EP-A 240 904 and EP-A 240 906 disclose the extrusion of polymer melts, preferably of vinylpyrrolidone copolymers, which contain active substances. However, there is no mention in either of them of the adjustment of a particular profile of active substance release by means of polymer mixtures. In addition, the storage stability of the products produced in this way is in many cases low, and the release slowing effect appears to diminish with time.<br>
EP-B 204 596 describes the production of pellets by embedding an active substance in a matrix composed of at least one non-hydrophilic polymer and<br><br><br>
either a mixture of at least two lipid substances, of which one has polymer<br><br>
dissolving or -gelling properties and the other has lubricant properties, or one    lipid substance which combines the two stated properties, with or without one or   more additives  selected from extenders and antistatic agents.  These  pellets however, suffer from serious disadvantages in that with higher amounts(i.e. above about 20%) of non-hydrophilic polymer the release takes place too quickly<br>
for a slow-release product, and with smaller amounts the release changes greatly<br>
on storage and is incomplete.<br>
US Patent No. 6,290,990 seeks to achieve the above-mentioned need by<br><br>
melt extrusion of certain polymer matrices which contain active substances and subsequent continuous shaping to produce slow-release pellets with high active substance content, even of active substances which are very readily soluble in water. According to this US Patent, it is possible to achieve release profiles which can be adjusted over wide ranges solely by the composition of the polymer matrix without diffusion-controlling polymer coatings and which have high storage stability;<br>
The basic principle of the polymer matrix according to US Patent No. 6,290,990 is a matrix, which is plasticized by a lipophilic substance and is<br>
composed of a polymer, which is insoluble in water and gastrointestinal fluids.<br>
The release profile is adjusted over wide ranges by incorporating into the matrix<br>
of insoluble polymer and lipophilic component a gel former, i.e.,  a polymer,<br><br>
which in water With the prior<br>
forms a highly viscous solution (hydrocolloid) or at least swells.<br>
art matrices, although the release of the active substance is<br>
controlled by the concentration of insoluble polymer, there is a risk that the<br>
administration form will disintegrate if the amount of polymer is too low, but the<br>
release of active substance may be incomplete if the amount of polymer is too<br>
large,  since portions of the  active  substance  are completely entrapped  and<br>
unavailable. The addition, according to US Patent No. 6,290,990, of gel former<br>
breaks up the release-slowing matrix by swelling of this polymer, and the active<br>
substance is allowed to be completely released, which at times,  could be a<br>
serious disadvantage.<br>
Thus,   there   has   been   a   continuing  need   for   tablets,   preferably  for<br>
pharmaceutical purposes, from which the active substance is released with an<br>
adjustable  release profile,  i.e.,   as  slow  as  required,  but  completely  over  a<br>
predetermined period of time.<br>
However, none of the prior art cited above or known to the applicants addresses the above-mentioned problems, particularly those relating to striking<br><br>
a balance between maintaining a proper bio-availability of the drug into the system and controlling the release to avoid an overdose of the drug into the<br>
system particularly when the or one of the active ingredients is highly soluble in<br>
ii water and the other active ingredient is less soluble in water.<br>
The present invention attempts to obviate the disadvantages of the prior<br>
art by  providing  a novel     controlled  release   composition  in  which   a  core<br>
consisting of active ingredient or ingredients, soluble excipients and. insoluble<br>
polymer is coated with film coating containing said polymer and excipients.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
It is therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a composition,<br><br>
preferably for pharmaceutical purposes, from which the active  substance is<br>
released  with  an  adjustable  release   profile,   i.e.,   as   slow  as  required,   but<br>
completely over a predetermined period of time.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a composition,<br>
preferably for pharmaceutical purposes, which completely avoids the problem of<br>
"dose dumping  associated with the prior art.<br>
It   is   an  important   object   of   the   present   invention   to   provide   a<br>
pharmaceutical! composition, preferably, in the form of a tablet in which the<br>
active the or one of the active ingredients is highly soluble in water and other<br>
active ingredient, if any is less soluble in water.<br>
It   is   yet   another   object   of   the   present   invention   to   provide    a<br>
pharmaceutical! composition,  preferably,  in  the  form  of a tablet for  use  in<br>
treatment of asthma, COPD and other bronchial problems.<br>
It   is   yet   another   object   of   the   present   invention   to    provide    a pharmaceutical! composition,  preferably,  in the  form  of a tablet for use  in<br>
treatment of asthma, COPD and other  bronchial problems which ensures zero<br>
order kinetics release rate.<br>
It   is   still   another   object   of   the   present   invention   to   provide   a<br>
pharmaceutical  composition,  preferably,  in  the  form  of a  tablet for  use  in<br>
treatment of a"sthma,  COPD and other bronchial problems which avoids the<br>
problems of side-effects associated with an active ingredient and gives advantage<br>
of lower dose of active pharmaceutical ingredients giving same level of effective<br>
concentration  in  blood  over a longer period  of time  reducing  the  frequent<br>
dosages.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a pharmaceutical<br>
composition   comprising   of   a   mixture    of   two   Xanthine    bronchodilators,<br><br>
preferably, in the form of a tablet for use in treatment of asthma, COPD and other bronchial problems in which one of the ingredients of the mixture is highly soluble in water, for e.g.,  Etofyllin and the other ingredient is less soluble in water for e.g., Theophylline.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The above and other objects of the invention are achieved by providing a novel composition comprising of at least one pharmaceutically active substance<br><br>
which is freely<br><br>
soluble in water and optionally other pharmaceutically active<br><br>
substance which is only partially soluble in water. The composition is preferably in the form of a tablet. The tablet core comprises of an unswellable polymer insoluble  in  the  dissolution  medium,   along with  other  soluble   as  well  as<br><br>
insoluble excipients to improve compressibility and lubrication. Within the core of this matrix, the active ingredients are dispersed. This core is coated with the film comprising of freely soluble excipients, plasticizer, lubricants and same polymer that has no permeability for the drug or dissolution medium to allow their permeation. The sole mechanism for release is through the micropores on<br>
the surface of core, created by the soluble excipient in the coating solution.<br><br>
These micropores are instrumental in ensuring a sustained release of the active<br>
ingredient over a predetermined large period of time, at the same time preventing<br>
a sudden burst of drug release into the system. This invention has a particular<br>
application in respect of pharmaceutical compositions comprising of two active<br>
ingredients one of which is freely soluble in water and the other is less soluble in<br>
water.	<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions for use in treatment of asthma, COPD and other bronchial conditions.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a novel controlled release pharmaceutical composition which comprises of a core matrix consisting of a mixture of a water-insoluble, non permeable and non swellable polymer and soluble excipients and/or other conventional additives, and at least an active ingredient dispersed in such core matrix, said core matrix being coated with said water insoluble, non permeable and non swellable polymer and soluble excipients, such that upon administration, the soluble excipients in said coating and said core matrix dissolving and creating micropores on various layers thereby allowing entry of surrounding fluids therein and create channels for the release of said active ingredients through said micropores.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, composition comprises of two active ingredients one of which is highly soluble in water and other is less soluble in water.<br>
In yet another embodiment, said active ingredients consist of at least two Xanthine derivatives one of which is highly soluble in water and other is less soluble in water.<br>
The  highly  soluble Xanthine  derivative  is  preferably  Etofyllin   and  is<br>

The   less  soluble  Xanthine   derivative   is  preferably  Theophylline   and present in an amount of from 5 to 35% by wt of said composition.<br><br>
The water; soluble excipients are preferably present in amount of from 1 to 10%by wt.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of said controlled release pharmaceutical composition, compressing a mixture of said a water insoluble lion permeable and non swellable polymer and soluble excipients and/or other conventional additives, and at least an active ingredient and coating said particles of said mixture in a coating composition comprising of an insoluble, non permeable and non swellable polymer and soluble additives, the soluble additive"s in said coating creating micropores on the surface, allowing entry of surrounding fluids therein and create channels for the release of said<br>
active ingredients through said micropores.<br>
Preferably, the composition is in the form of tablet. More preferably, the<br>
tablet consists of multiple coatings.<br>
In a most preferred embodiment, Etofyllin and Theophylline are present in a ratio of 77:23.;<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the composition of the present invention is a pharmaceutical composition in the form of polymer coated pellets.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the pellets are polymer coated micropellets in a capsule, preferably, a gelatin capsule.<br>
In another embodiment, said tablets or pellets comprise of a core comprising of said active ingredients, excipients and insoluble, non- permeable, non-swellable polymer and a sustained release coating consisting of a insoluble, non- permeable, non-swellable polymer and soluble additives.<br>
In yet another embodiment, same polymer is employed for coating as well as the core matrix.<br>
In yet another preferred embodiment, said core comprises of from 80 to 90% and in preferred embodiment 88.75% by wt of said active ingredients, from<br><br><br>
1.75 to 15% by wt of said polymer and balance, comprising of said excipients and additives. In a preferred embodiment, said polymer is present in amount of 8 to 9 % by wt of said composition.<br>
The insoluble, non- permeable, non-swellable polymer is preferably an<br>
Acrylic    acid,    ;more    preferably    methacrylic    acid    copolymer    preferably,<br>
Methacrylate and Methacrylic acid copolymer type B USP.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the amount of said insoluble, non- permeable,<br>
non-swellable polymer in said coating composition is from 0.5 to 7 % by wt,<br>
more preferably, from 2.3 to 2.5% by wt.	<br>
The water-soluble excipients and additives, which may be the same or<br><br>
different  are   selected  from  the  group   consisting  of lactose, PEG,   sucrose,<br>
mannitol, dextrose or citric acid.<br><br>
In yet another embodiment, the compressed mixture is dispersed in an organic solvent! selected from isopropyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, specially denatured spirrd or acetone.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the compressed mixture is granulated in the presence of organic solvents such as isopropyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, specially denatured spirit or acetone.<br>
In another embodiment, the granules are graded with lubricants and gradients such as talc, magnesium stearate, or Aerosil.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the composition optionally contains    fillers such as, for example, starch or lactose Detailed description<br>
One of the important feature of the present invention is that it employs a<br>
mixture   of   at least   two   active   ingredients,   for   example   bronchodilators,<br>
preferably, Xanthine derivatives. Preferably, the Xanthine derivatives comprise of<br>
Etofyllin and Theophylline, which offer the following advantages: i!<br>
(1)	Better solubility of Theophylline in the presence of Etofyllin<br>
(2)	Easier change over from one formulation to another because all the<br>
formulations contain the same ratio of the drugs.<br>
(3)	Reduced riskjof side effects because:<br>
(a)	Theophylline   and   Etofyllin   have   not   demonstrated   cumulative toxicity in animal experiments, and,<br>
(b)	Etofyllin is not converted into Theophylline as happens with many other Xanthine derivatives. This offers wider therapeutic window.<br><br>
By employing the composition of the present invention, a linear rate of release is obtained in acidic medium and the linearity relationship of concentration with time is established.<br><br>
Combination of Theophylline (hydrous or anhydrous)  with  Etofyllih in "the<br>
ratio of 23:  77  shows rapid dissolution and bio-availability as compared to	<br>
Theophylline or Etofyllin singularly.   The release rate of such rapidly dissolving      combination  can be  controlled,  by  designing  a matrix  of Methacrylic  Acid Copolymer Type B and the mixture of Theophylline and Etofyllin mixed with the polymer to the extent of 5-25% and in preferred embodiment to the extent of 7 to 15 %.   The resultant mixture may be converted into granules by use of either<br>
organic solvent like isopropyl alcohol or ethyl alcohol or specially denatured<br>
spirit or acetone or the aqueous dispersion of polymer or the polymer solution in<br>
organic solvent.  Resultant granules may be graded and mixed with lubricants<br>
and glidants like talc, magnesium stearate, aerosil, etc.   The tablet may contain<br>
fillers such as Lactose, Starch, or even may be granulated without the aid of<br>
fillers.<br>
The tablets are compressed at a hardness between 20 and 80 N and then<br>
coated using a polymer solution in which  Micronised Lactose  or PEG  (Poly<br>
Ethylene Glycol) lis suspended.   Tablets may be coated using conventional pan<br>
coating or in  a  fluid  bed  coating  equipment  or in  an Accela  cota type  of<br>
equipment.  After curing, the tablets show uniform rate of release of drug. The important feature of the present invention relates is the preparation<br>
of sustained and constant release polymer coated tablet.<br>
The constant release rate regimen can be described by following expression:<br><br>
dQ	= constant where      dQ	= release rate<br>
dt	dt<br>
Q       =      amount released at time t<br>
i.e.       Q       =      constant x t       +   c<br>
wherein c is a constant value, t is the time, d is the differential, and dQ s the<br>
amount of the active ingredient released so that dQ/dt which is the release rate<br>
remains constant.<br>
The above equation indicates that amount of released substance is a linear function of time.<br>
The pharmacologically active substance is a mixture of Xanthine bronchodilators with one of them being freely water soluble and the other being less water soluble. For example, Theophylline and Etofyllin can be combined in a range with Theophylline ranging between 5 to 35% and Etofyllin ranging between<br><br><br><br><br>
95 to 65% and in a preferred embodiment in the ratio of 23:77 %. This extended release preparation produces its biological response over a longer period of time and permits reduction in number of daily doses. Although the system described<br>
and studied extensively here is a pharmaceutical system, the same principle can<br><br>
be extrapolated for application into other fields.<br><br>
The preferred embodiment of the present invention has been described in<br>
terms of a tablet. However, it can be formulated in other dosage forms as well,<br>
for    example    polymer    coated    micropellets    in    a    gelatin    capsule.    The<br>
pharmacokinetic studies of this  preparation have been  carried  out  and its<br>
efficacy over the extended period of time, 12 hr., has been demonstrated. Being a<br>
bronchodilator, it provides an efficacious means to control bronchospasms with<br>
minimal side effects. The tablet consists of drugs and excipients and polymeric substance for<br>
example, a meth"acrylic acid copolymer Type B. The tablet is preferably, further<br>
The excipients in of the tablets. T channels for outf<br>
coated by the same polymer, as that is added in the matrix alongwith excipients.<br>
coating are water soluble and create micropores on the surface he surrounding fluid enters the tablet core and creates the ow of drug solution through micropores. The polymer chosen is<br>
insoluble and hence the matrix structure remains intact in acidic fluid. The<br>
particle size of the excipient, which creates micropores, is such that a large<br>
number of micropores are created on tablet surface, each having dimension of a<br>
few microns, thus preventing sudden release of drug from any particular portion<br>
of the tablet.        <br>
Almost 80% of the drug is released by zero order kinetics and due to<br>
carefully controlled particle size of excipient in coating layer,  the  danger of<br>
release   of active  ingredient  from   any  particular  position   on   the   tablet  is<br>
minimum. As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art, in zero order<br>
kinetics, the release process is independent of amount of drug released and does<br>
not change with time.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for preparation of sustained ,<br>
release polymer coated tablet which in the presence of dissolution fluid releases<br>
biologically  active principles  at  substantially  constant  rate, for an  extended<br>
period  of time. The tablet cores comprises of an insoluble  and  unswellable<br>
polymer, in the dissolution medium,  along with other excipients to improve<br>
compressibility and lubrication.    Within the pores of this matrix,  the active<br>
ingredients are dispersed. This core is coated with the same polymer that has no<br>
permeability for the drug or dissolution medium to allow their permeation. The<br><br>
sole mechanism for release is through the pores on the surface of core, created by the soluble excipient in the coating solution.<br>
The process comprises of: -	<br>
1)	mixing of the  active principles and  other  excipients. This mixture  is <br><br>
preferably, granulated by a solution of Methacrylic Acid Copolymer to 20# ASTM    <br>
sieve size.		<br>
ii)	compressing the tablets on a compression machine to obtain the cores<br>
having  hardnes.s   of at  least  30N  and   not  more  than   70N,   measured   on Schleuniger hardness tester. The punches of 8 to 12.5 mm diameter are used. iii)   applying a   release sustaining membrane on these cores. The membrane is preferably, formed by spraying a solution of Methacrylic Acid Copolymer, and Lactose or PEG or Sucrose or Mannitol, etc.<br>
The operation of the present device may be described as follows: -As the dissolution medium comes in contact with the coated tablet, the freely soluble excipient present in the coat dissolves instantaneously in the surrounding dissolution medium, creating numerous micropores on the surface of coat. It can be assumed that the coat would be multi layered and the soluble excipient present in each layer would create a continuous channel of pores. Description with reference to the accompanying drawings<br>
The novel  operative aspect of the  present invention  may be  now be described with refernce to the sole figure of the accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
Fig. 1   discloses  a preferred  embodiment  of the  tablet  of the  present invention having multiple layered coat.<br>
Referring to the Fig., the tablet is generally shown by the refrence numeral<br>
1. The tablet 1 consists of a tablet core or core matrix 2 consisting of a mixture<br>
of a water insoluble, non permeable and non swellable polymer 6. and soluble<br>
excipients and/or other conventional additives 5. The active ingredients  are<br>
dispersed in the core matrix 2. As can be seen from the figure, the core matrix is<br>
coated with several layers or coats 3 of water insoluble, non permeable and non<br>
swellable polymer 6 and soluble excipients 5. Upon administration, the soluble<br>
excipients  5 in  said   coating 3   and  said  core  matrix 2   dissolve  and  create<br>
micropores  on various layers  thereby  allowing  entry  of surrounding  fluids<br>
therein and create channels 4 for the release of said active ingredients through<br>
said micropores. <br><br><br>
As can be easily appreciated, the molecules of active ingredients travel through channels within the cores and coat up to the micropores created on the surface of tablet coat. The rate of release is proportional to time i.e zero order.  .<br>
Thus, a careful selection of polymer and excipients for:the core and the<br>
delivery rate controlling membranes creates the above-mentioned  structure to <br>
give zero order release rate. The composition of the core can be altered to suit<br>
the solubility of the active ingredient.	<br>
The inner core matrix<br>
  The core matrix comprises of 1.75% to 15% of the polymer and from 80<br>
to, 90 %, preferably, about 86 88 % active ingredients.   The percentage of other<br>
excipients is adjusted accordingly.<br>
The polymer material chosen for the matrix as well as for the coating<br>
should be insoluble, nonswellable and non-permeable to the dissolution medium<br><br>
being used. The most preferred polymer used for the present invention is Methacrylic Acid Copolymer Type B USP, while other polymers are well within<br><br>
the scope of the invention. It is preferred that the polymer is also bio¬compatible.<br>
The soluble excipient added in the coating solution is a freely water soluble substance selected from Lactose, Dextrose, Sucrose, PEG, Citric Acid and the like. The role of this additive depends entirely upon its concentration<br><br>
relative to the polymer in the coating solution, its particle size and the solubility<br><br>
of active ingredients present in the core. The water soluble additive that is present in the core and coating membrane serves as a channel forming agent, allowing the active ingredient to be released. The dissolution of water soluble excipient increases porosity and dissolution of active ingredients and reaching of dissolution medium into the inner portions of the core is enhanced. Since the polymer is insoluble and unswellable or non-permeable, a highly soluble active ingredient also cannot alter the structure of the tablet but the porosity is increased rapidly.<br>
Release rate controlling membrane<br>
As discussed earlier the release rate controlling membrane consists of an<br>
insoluble,   non-permeable   and   nonswellable   polymer   and   a   highly   soluble<br>
t<br>
additive. This membrane can be visualized as a multi layered membrane. Each layer in the membrane will consist of polymer film with the particles of additive dispersed within this film. The size of these additive particles is very important, which does not affect the integrity of the film but allows creation of pores after its own dissolution. The distribution of these particles within each layer will be<br><br>
random. These pores will not be superimposed for these layers but it will create a tortuous channel network in this coated layer. These channels will have dimension approximate to the particle size of the additive. If this channel size is too large, it will cause damage to the integrity of the membrane and subsequently causing a non-uniform and erratic release of the active ingredient. A coating of about 4 mg is applied to the surface area of apprpx. 196.11 mm2 and in that proportion.<br>
The shape, as always preferred for the pharmaceutical tablets, is a biconvex tablet with diameter varying from 8.00  mm to   12.5  mm and the<br>
thickness varying from 3.6 mm to 6.0 mm correspondingly. The amount of active<br>
"I ingredients in the cores varies from  150 mg to 450 mg and the diameter to<br>
thickness ratio varies. It was also observed that the uniformity in the release rate<br>
is maintained by varying the proportion of soluble active ingredient in the<br>
sustained release coating to suit the ratio between surface area to the amount of<br>
active ingredient in the core.<br>
The process comprises of usual process described, with following steps: -<br>
a)	mixing the active principle with the additives and granulating it with an organic solution of polymer.  Drying and further lubricating the granules.<br>
b)	compressing the granules of Step I to the hardness of not less than 30N and not more than 70N, measured on a Schleuniger Hardness Tester, on a suitable compression machine and appropriate dies and punches to get the required active ingredient quantity in each tablet.<br>
c)	applying the sustained release coating on the cores. This process can be<br>
carried out in the, conventional coating pan of capacity from 1 to 170 kg<br>
depending on the; quantity of cores.<br>
This device shows following characteristics: -<br><br>
At least 80% of the active ingredient is released by the zero order kinetics over a period of 6 hours, which is demonstrated quantitatively by in vitro models. The release occurs over the entire surface of tablet and the shortcomings of the release through single orifice on the surface do not exist. The collapse of the<br>
matrix structure or destruction of membrane during the course of dissolution of<br><br>
active ingredient  is extremely unlikely as the polymer chosen for matrix and<br><br>
membrane is completely insoluble and non swellable in dissolution medium. Even in the event of such rupture, the dose dumping does not occur, as the solid reservoir releases active principle at rate proportional, to the square root of time.<br>
The active principle has solubility practically independent of pH.  The<br>
i<br>
polymer chosen dissolves above pH  7.5.  The  formulation  shows remarkable<br><br>
stability and strength during handling and storage. It can even be sugar coated without any significant change in release rate profile.<br>
The following examples illustrate typical delivery device manufactured according to the invention. The dosage form is a tablet.<br>

3.	Methacrylic Acid Copolymer Type B NF is dissolved in organic solvents<br>
like Isopropyl Alcohol, Acetone or SD Spirit, etc. along with plasticizer<br>
Dibutyl Pthalate.    Other Plasticizers such as Triacetin, Triethyl Citrate,<br>
castor oil etc. can also be used.<br><br>
4.	The  blend  of Etofyllin  and Theophyllin is wetted  completely with the<br>
solution of Methacrylic Acid Copolymer Type B in organic solvent along<br>
with plasticizer.<br>

this solution.    Micronised Lactose dissolves in contact with the gastric<br>
fluid and then Theophyllin and Etofyllin are released at a controlled rate<br>
by  diffusion  and  dissolution  process.     Micronised  Talc  prevents  the<br>
