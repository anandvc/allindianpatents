DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
A portable telephone communicates with another terminal via a base station which is the nearest to the portable telephone. And even if the own terminal and the companion terminal exist within the same area, a base station is absolutely necessary to perform communications via.<br>
That is, since the portable telephone does not have an interface for radio coizimunications which is used for communicating with another terminal other than the base station, it has to communicate via the base station when communicating with a companion terminal.<br>
By the way, such a portable telephone has to communicate with a companion terminal via the base station. Therefore, even if  the  terminal  exists  in  the  same  area  as   the portable  telephone<br><br>
at the time of meeting, the base station has to be used to call the companion terminal over a public circuit network so that they can inform each other of their positions by means of audio communications.<br>
In addition, the portable telephone is difficult to exactly know whether the companion terminal is "getting closer" or "getting farther" while they move, which causes a problem in its usability.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In view of the foregoing, an object of this invention is to provide a radio communication device and a method of measuring a distance which offer excellent usability and are capable of easily detecting a distance and a positional relation between the device and a target for measurement.<br>
The foregoing object and other objects of the invention have been achieved by the provision of a radio communication device which directly transmits via a radio communication means a predetermined measurement signal which is used for calculating a distance between a specific target for measurement and its current position, receives a response signal in response to the measurement signal transmitted from the target for measurement, and then calculates the distance between its current position and<br><br>
the target for measurement, based on the response signal and the measurement signal, so that the distance and the positional relation between the target for measurement and its device can be easily calculated by directly communicating the measurement signal and the response signal with the target for measurement, not via a base station.<br>
In addition, in the present invention, a radio -communication device directly transmits standard time information showing a transmission time toward a specific target for measurement, which is used for calculating a distance between its current position and a target for measurement, to the target for measurement, receives reception time information of the standard time information, which is transmitted from the target for measurement and then, calculates the distance between the current position and the target for measurement based on the standard time information and the reception time information. Thereby, the radio communication device can easily calculates the distance and the positional relation between the own device and the target for measurement by directly communicating the standard time information and the reception time information, not via a base station.<br>
Furthermore, in the present invention, a radio communication device directly transmits standard time information<br><br>
indicating the transKLission, tin?^ toward a specif ic target for measurement, .which is used for calculating a distance between its.<br>
_own current position and the target' for measurement, to the. target for measurement/ receives reception time information of the standard time information, which synchronizes with the standard time information in Absolute time, from the target for measurement and then, calculates the distance between the current<br>
position and the target for measurement based on the standard<br>
time information and the reception time information. Thereby,<br>
the distance and the positional relation between the own device<br>
and the target for measurement can be easily and accurately<br>
calculated by directly communicating the standard time<br>
information and the reception time information which synchronize <br>
to each other, with the target for measurement, not via a base<br>
station.	.<br>

DETAILED DSCRIPTIQN OF THE EMBODIMENT<br>
Preferred erabodlments of  this  invention  will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings: (1)  First Embodiment<br>
In Fig. 1, a reference numeral 1 shows a cellular digital portable telephone system as a whole, which is composed of a base station 2 connected to a public circuit network, and digital portable telephones (hereinafter, referred to as portable telephones simply) 3A and 3B which communicate with each other via the base station 2 by audio.<br>
In addition, the portable telephones 3A and SB in the digital portable telephone system 1 can receive a satellite signal SI which is transmitted from a global positioning system (GPS) satellite 4 rotating in orbit 20000Km above the earth, and can directly communicate with each other by a radio communication method as a radio interface for short distance based on a bluetooth (trademark), not via the base station 2.<br>
Here, the Bluetooth is a standard of a radio data communication for short distance which is standardized by the standardizing group,   Bluetooth  special  interest group   (SIG),   in<br>
i<br><br>
which by setting 79 channels with the band width of IMHz in the industrial scientific and medical equipment band (ISM band) of 2.4GHz, data communication for short distance of about 10m is performed at data transmission speed of IMbit/sec by means of the spread spectrum, comiaunication method  utilizing a  frequency hopping method of changing channels 1600 times per second.<br>
In the portable telephone 3A as shown in Fig. 2, a display 11 which is a liquid crystal display, a plurality of operation keys 12 for inputting various commands, a signal processor 13 which is a digital signal processor (DSP), a GPS receiver 14 and a radio interface for short distance 15 based on the Bluetooth are connected to a central processing unit (CPU) 10 for controlling entire operations in the portable telephone 3A, and a microphone 16, a speaker 17, a transmitter 18, and a receiver 19 are connected to the signal processor 13.<br>
In this connection, the portable telephone 3A is a cellular portable telephone in the code division multiple access   (SOMA) scheme utilizing the direct sequence (DS) method based on the IS95 standards.  Since the portable telephone 3B has the same circuit construction as the portable telephone 3A, the explanation of same is omitted.<br>
The CPU 10 makes the display 11 display various information {for example,   inputted  telephone numbers,   menu  items,   or calling<br><br>
history and telephone directory) which is inputted with the operation keys 12,  In addition, the CPU 10 controls the signal processor 13 in response to the various commands, which are inputted with the operation keys 12, to execute various processing corresponding to commands to make a call or to finish a conversation.<br>
For example, the signal processor 13 performs error -correction processing utilizing the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) method and then the convolutional coding processing, on an audio signal which is inputted via the microphone 16 during conversation.  Then, it adds a Pseudo Noise (PN) code, performs frequency-spreading, and performs quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation, in order to produce a transmission symbol stream which is then given to the transmitter 18.<br>
The transmitter 18 performs digital-to-analog conversion processing on the transmission symbol stream, which is supplied from the signal processor 13, in order to produce a transmission signal, and performs frequency conversion on the transmission signal, and amplifies it, in order to transmit the resultant via the antenna 20.<br>
On the other hand, the receiver 19 amplifies the reception signal which is received via the antenna 20, performs the frequency conversion processing and then the analog-to-digital<br><br>
conversion processing, in order to produce a reception symbol stream which is then transmitted to the signal processor 13.<br>
The signal processor 13 performs the QPSK demodulation on the reception symbol stream, which is supplied from the receiver 19, adds the PN code and performs the de-spread spectrum, and further, performs maximum likelihood estimation and the error correction processing utilizing the CRC method, in order to produce an audio signal which is then outputted via the speaker 17.<br>
Further, under the control of the CPU 10, the signal processor 13 transmits a control signal to the base station 2 (Fig. 1) via the transmitter 18 and the antenna 20 to make a call, and also receives a call-arrival signal via the antenna 20 and the receiver 19 and informs the CPU 10 of the call arrival.<br>
In this way, the CPU 10 controls the signal processor 13, so that the portable telephone 3A can perform radio communication with another portable telephone connected to a public circuit network with the transmitter 18, the receiver 19, and the antenna 20 via the base station 20.<br>
In addition, in the portable telephone 3A, the satellite signal SI which is transmitted from the GPS satellite 4 is received via the GPS antenna 22, GPS reception data is produced by demodulating the satellite signal SI through the GPS receiver<br><br>
14, and the data is given to the CPU 10,<br>
Here, the CPU 10 calculates positional information consisting of latitude, longitude, and altitude, which indicates the current position of the portable telephone 3A, based on the GPS reception data D2 received from at least three GPS satellites 4, by the principle of triangle measurement.<br>
Note that, the CPU 10 make the portable telephones 3A and 3B temporally synchronize with the base station 2, based on a system time which is transmitted from the base station 2 (Fig. 1) . Thereby, the portable telephones 3A and 3B synchronize with each other, having the same absolute time.<br>
Further, the CPU 10 controls the radio interface for short distance 15, so that the portable telephone 3A performs radio communication with another portable telephone 3B close to it, via the antenna 21.  Thereby, the positional information (latitude, longitude, and altitude) indicating the current position of the portable telephone 3A and the time information can be directly transmitted to the portable telephone 3B, which is the companion terminal, within the radio communication area of the bluetooth, not via the base station.<br>
Next, explanations will be concretely made on a distance measuring procedure in which the portable telephone 3A which is the main terminal in the digital portable telephone system 1<br><br><br>
measures a distance to a portable telephone 3B which is the companion terminal, and a positional relation detecting procedure in which the main terminal detects a positional relation whether the own terminal and the companion terminal are "getting closer to" or "getting farther from" each other.<br>
In the digital telephone system 1 as shown in Fig. 3, firstly, at step SPl, the portable telephone 3A, which is the main-terminal, transmits to the companion terminal via the radio interface for short distance 15, a terminal inquiry signal comprising the main terminal identification (ID), the main terminal number, and the companion terminal number of the portable telephone 3B, which is the companion terminal, under the control of the CPU 10.<br>
At step SP2, in the case where the portable telephone 3B, which is the companion terminal, receives the terminal inquiry signal, which is transmitted from the portable telephone 3A, when existing within the radio communication area of the bluetooth, and confirms that the companion terminal number is own number, it transmits an inquiry response signal comprising an own terminal ID (hereinafter, referred to as companion terminal ID), an own terminal number (hereinafter, referred to as companion terminal number) and the terminal number of the portable telephone 3A (hereinafter, referred to as main terminal number), to the<br><br>
portable telephone 3A.<br>
At step SP3, the portable telephone 3A, which is the main terminal, receives the inquiry response signal, which is transmitted from the companion terminal, checks the companion terminal ID, the companion terminal number, the main terminal number, with the CPU 10, to confirm that the portable telephone 3B, which is the companion terminal, exists within the radio communication area of the bluetooth, and then terminates the terminal-in-network confirmation processing.<br>
Then, at step SP4, the portable telephone 3A, which is the main terminal, transmits a measurement pilot signal comprising current standard time information in synchronizing with that of the portable telephone 3B, which is the companion terminal, main positional information (latitude, longitude, and altitude) indicating the current position which is calculated based on the GPS reception data D2 received from the GPS satellite 4, to the companion terminal via the radio interface for short distance 15.<br>
At step SP5, the portable telephone 3B, which is the companion terminal, transmits a pilot response signal comprising reception time information indicating the reception time of receiving the measurement pilot signal transmitted from the portable telephone 3A, which is the main terminal, and companion positional information (latitude, longitude, and altitude)<br><br>
indicating the current position of the companion terminal itself, to the main terminal via the radio interface for short distance 15.<br>
At step SP6, the portable telephone 3A, which is the main terminal, calculates a distance between own device and the companion terminal, based on the main positional information and the companion positional information with the CPU 10 functioning as -a calculating means, and terminates the standard distance calculation processing.<br>
Then, at step SP7, the portable telephone 3A, which is the main terminal, transmits a measurement pilot signal comprising the current standard time information in synchronizing with that of the companion terminal, and the main positional information indicating the current position of the own terminal itself, to the companion terminal via the radio interface for short distance 15 again.<br>
At step SP8, the portable telephone 3B, which is the companion terminal, transmits a pilot response signal comprising the reception time information of the time when the measurement pilot signal transmitted from the main terminal is received, and the companion positional information on the current position of the companion terminal itself, to the main terminal via the radio interface for short distance 15 again.<br><br>
At step SP9, the portable telephone 3A, which is the main terminal, calculates a distance between the own terminal and the companion terminal, based on the main positional information and the companion positional information, with the CPU 10 again, and compares the calculated distance to the fist standard distance to detects the change in the distance between the own terminal and the companion terminal, resulting in detecting the distance state whether the own terminal is "getting closer to" or "getting farther from" the companion terminal.  Then, the positional relation detecting processing between the main terminal and the companion terminal is terminated.<br>
Note that, thereafter, similarly to the above procedure, the portable telephone 3A, which is the main terminal, can accurately detect the distance state whether the main terminal is "getting closer to" or "getting farther from" the companion terminal every time when repeating the positional relation detecting processing.<br>
As described above, the portable telephone 3A, which is the main terminal, calculates a distance between the own terminal and the companion terminal based on the main positional information and the companion positional information, as a standard distance at step SP6. However, if the portable telephone 3B, which is the companion terminal, can not receive the satellite signal SI from<br><br>
the GPS satellite 4 and does not hold the companion positional information, the portable telephone 3A may calculate radio wave transmission time based on the standard time information held therein and the reception time information transmitted from the companion terminal, in order to calculate a distance between the own terminal and the companion terminal based on the radio wave transmission time and the radio transmission speed (3 x lO^'m/sec) .<br>
As 'described above, the portable telephones 3A and 3B perform switching control so as to calculate a standard distance based on the standard time information and the reception time information in the case where the portable telephones 3A and 3B do not hold the main positional information and the companion positional information, and on the other hand, to calculate a standard distance based on the main positional information and the companion positional information in the case where they hold the main positional information and the companion positional information. As a result, if either the main positional information and the companion positional information or the standard time information and the reception time information are held, a distance between the own terminal and the companion terminal can be always calculated.<br>
In the foregoing configuration, the portable telephone 3A, which is the main terminal, firstly transmits a terminal inquiry<br><br><br>
signal to the portable telephone 3B, which is the companion terminal, via the radio interface for short distance 15, and recognizes that the companion terminal exists within the radio communication area of the bluetooth when receiving the inquiry response signal from the portable telephone 3B, which is the companion terminal.<br>
Then, the portable telephone 3A, which is the main terminal, transmits" a measurement pilot signal consisting of the standard time information and the main positional information to the portable telephone 3B, which is the companion terminal, via the radio interface for short distance 15, receives the pilot response signal consisting of the reception time information and the companion positional information of the time when the measurement pilot signal is received, from the portable telephone 3B, which is the companion terminal, and then-calculates the standard distance between the own terminal and the companion terminal based on the main positional information and the companion positional information.<br>
Then, the portable telephone 3A, which is the main terminal, calculates a distance between the own terminal and the companion terminal, by repeatedly communicating the measurement pilot signal and the reception processing of the pilot response signal with the companion terminal, in order to detect a distance state<br><br>
between the own terminal and the companion terminal by comparing the calculated distance with the standard distance.<br>
As described above, in the digital portable telephone system 1, the portable telephone 3A, which is the main terminal, and the portable telephone 3B, which is the companion terminal, communicate the terminal inquiry signal and the inquiry response signal with each other via the radio interface for short distance 15, so that it can be easily recognized whether the companion terminal exists within a radio communication area of the bluetooth corresponding to the radio interface for short distance 15.<br>
In addition, in the digital portable telephone system 1, the portable telephone 3A, which is the main terminal, and the portable telephone 3B, which is the companion terminal, communicate the measurement pilot signal and the pilot response signal with each other via the radio interface for short distance 15, so that a distance between the main terminal and the companion terminal can be measured free of charge, not via the base station 2.<br>
Furthermore, in the digital portable system 1, the portable telephone 3A, which is the main terminal, and the portable telephone 3B, which is the companion terminal, repeatedly communicate the measurement pilot signal and the pilot response<br><br>
signal via the radio interface for short distance 15, so that a distance between the main terminal and the companion terminal can be calculated, thus making is possible to accurately detect a distance state between the main terminal and the companion terminal by comparing the current distance between the main terminal and the companion terminal with the standard distance or with a distance just before the calculation.<br>
According to the foregoing configuration, in the digital portable telephone system 1, the portable telephone 3A, which is the main terminal, and the portable telephone 3B, which is the companion terminal, can accurately and easily calculate a distance and a positional relation between the main terminal and the companion terminal via the radio interface for short distance 15, not via the base station 2.<br>
Note that, the aforementioned first embodiment has described the case of calculating the positional information consisting of latitude, longitude, and altitude showing the current positions of the portable telephones 3A and SB by the principle of triangle measurement, based on the GPS reception data D2 that is obtained by receiving the satellite signal SI transmitted from the GPS satellite 4. The present invention, however, is not limited to this and the positional information can be calculated by a differential-GPS (D-GPS).<br><br>
Further, the aforementioned first embodiment has described the case of directly communicating data between the portable telephones 3A and 3B, using the radio interface for short distance 15 as a radio communication means. The present invention, however, is not limited to this and other kinds of radio communication means which are able to handle with the radio communication distance of more than 100m can be used.<br>
  Furthermore, the aforementioned first embodiment has described the case where the portable telephones 3A and 3B are applied as radio communication devices in the present invention. The present invention, however, is not limited to this and can be applied to other kinds of radio communication devices which can be provided with radio communication means, such as a transceiver, a pager and a personal digital assistants (PDA). (2) Second Embodiment<br>
As shown in Fig. 4 in which the same reference numerals are applied to parts corresponding to those in Fig. 1, a reference numeral 40 shows a cellular digital portable telephone system as a whole, and is composed of a base station 2 connected to a public circuit network, and digital portable telephones (hereinafter, referred to as portable telephones, simply) 43A and 43B which perform audio communication via the base station 2.<br>
In the digital portable telephone system 40  in the second<br><br>
embodiment, the base station 2 does not transmit a system time to the portable telephones 43A and 43B, and temporally does not synchronize with the portable telephones 43A and 43B, and therefore, the portable telephones 43A and 43B do not synchronize with each other,<br>
Note that, since the circuit configurations of the portable telephones 43A and 43B of this case are the same as those of the portable telephones 3A and 3B in the first embodiment, the explanation of them will be omitted.<br>
In actual, in the digital portable telephone system 40, as shown in Fig. 5, firstly, at step SPll, the portable telephone 43A, which is the main terminal, transmits a terminal inquiry signal comprising a main terminal identification (ID), a main terminal number and a companion terminal number of the portable telephone 43B, which is the companion terminal, by the CPU 10 via the radio interface for short distance 15, to the companion terminal, similarly to the distance measurement procedure and the positional relation detection procedure in the first embodiment.<br>
At step SP12, the portable telephone 43B, which is the companion terminal, receives the terminal inquiry signal transmitted from the portable telephone 43A when existing within the radio communication area of the bluetooth, and when recognizing that the companion terminal number is the own<br><br>
terminal number, transmits to the portable telephone 43A an inquiry response signal comprising an own terminal ID (hereinafter, referred to as companion terminal ID), an own terminal number (hereinafter, referred to as companion terminal number) and the terminal number of the portable telephone 43A (hereinafter, referred to as main terminal number).<br>
At step SP13, the portable telephone 43A, which is the main terminal,"~receives the inquiry response signal transmitted from the companion terminal, recognizes the companion terminal ID, the companion terminal number, and the main terminal number to confirm that the portable telephone 43B, which is the companion terminal, exists within the radio communication area of the bluetooth, and then, terminates the terminal-in-network confirmation processing.<br>
Sequentially, at step SP14, the portable telephone 43A, which is the main terminal, transmits main positional information (latitude, longitude, and altitude) representing the current position calculated based on the GPS reception data D2 received from the GPS satellite 4, as a measurement pilot signal via the radio interface for short distance 15 to the companion terminal.<br>
At step SP15, when the portable telephone 43B, which is the companion terminal, receives the measurement pilot signal transmitted form the portable telephone 43A, -which is the main<br><br>
terminal, it transmits companion positional information (latitude, longitude, and altitude) representing the current position of the companion terminal itself as a pilot response signal to the main terminal via the radio interface for short distance 15.<br>
