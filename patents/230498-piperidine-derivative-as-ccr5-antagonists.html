CCR5 ANTAGONISTS USEFUL FOR TREATING AIDS<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The present invention relates to piperidine derivatives useful as selective CCR5 antagonists, pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds, and methods of treatment using the compounds. The invention also relates to the use of a combination of a CCR5 antagonist of this invention and one or more antiviral or other agents useful in the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). The invention further relates to the use of a CCR-5 antagonist of this invention, alone or in combination with another agent, in the treatment of solid organ transplant rejection, graft v. host disease, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, asthma, allergies or multiple sclerosis.<br>
The global health crisis caused by HIV, the causative agent of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), is unquestioned, and while recent advances in dnjg therapies have been successful in slowing the progression of AIDS, there is still a need to find a safer, more efficient, less expensive way to control the virus.<br>
It has been reported that the CCR5 gene plays a role in resistance to HIV infection. HIV infection begins by attachment of the virus to a target ceil membrane through interaction with the cellular receptor CD4 and a secondary chemokine co-receptor molecule, and proceeds by replication and dissemination of infected cells through the blood and other tissue. There are various chemokine receptors, but for macrophage-tropic HIV. believed to be the key pathogenic strain that replicates in vivo in the early stages of infection, the principal chemokine receptor required for the entry of HIV into the cell is CCR5. Therefore, interfering with the interaction between the viral receptor CCR5 and HIV can block HIV entry into the cell. The present invention relates to small molecules which are CCR5 antagonists.<br>
CCR-5 receptors have been reported to mediate cell transfer in inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, asthma and allergies, and inhibitors of such receptors are expected to be useful in the<br><br>
treatment of such diseases, and in the treatment of other inflammatory diseases or conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, solid organ transplant rejection and graft v. host disease.<br>
Piperidine derivatives which are muscarinic antagonists useful in the treatment o cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease are disclosed in US patents 5.883,096: 6.037.352; 5.889,006; 5,952,349; and 5.977.138.<br>
Piperidine and piperazine derivatives useful in the treatment of AIDS are disclosed in WO 00/66559 and WO 00/66558.<br>
A-M. Vandamme et al.. Antiviral Chemistry &amp; Chemotherapv, 9:187-203 (1998) disclose current clinical treatments of HIV-1 infections in man including at least triple drug combinations or so-called Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ("HAART"); HAART involves various combinations of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ("NRTI"), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ("NNRTl") and HIV protease inhibitors ("PI"). In compliant drug-naive patients, HAART Is effective in reducing mortality and progression of HIV-I to AIDS. However, these multidnjg therapies do not eliminate HIV-1 and long-term treatment usually results in multidrug resistance. Development of new drug therapies to provide better HIV-1 treatment remains a priority.<br><br><br>
R- is H or (C1-C6)alkyl, and R' is H, (C1-C5)alkyl, (C1-C6)alkoxy(C1-C6)alkyl-,<br><br><br><br>
Another aspect of the invention is a pharmaceutical composition for treatment of HIV comprising an effective amount of at least one compound of formula I in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Another aspect of the invention is a pharmaceutical composition for treatment of solid organ transplant rejection, graft v. host disease, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, asthma, allergies or multiple sclerosis comprising an effective amount of at least one compound of formula I in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
Yet another aspect of this invention is a method of treatment of HIV comprising administering to a human in need of such treatment an effective amount of at least one compound of formula I. Another aspect of the invention is a method of treatment of solid organ transplant rejection, graft v. host disease, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, asthma, allergies or multiple sclerosis comprising administering to a human in need of such treatment an effective amount of at least one compound of formula I. Also contemplated is the use of at least one compound of formula I for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of HIV, solid organ transplant rejection, graft v. host disease, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, asthma, allergies or multiple sclerosis.<br>
Still another aspect of this invention is the use of at least one compound of formula 1 of this invention in combination with one or more antiviral or other agents useful in the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus for the treatment of AIDS. Still another aspect of this invention is the use of at least one compound of formula I of this invention in combination with one or more other agents useful in the treatment of solid organ transplant rejection, graft v, host disease, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis. The compound(s) of formula I and antiviral or other agents which are components of the combination can be administered in a single dosage form or they can be administered separately. Therefore, a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one compound of formula I and one or more antiviral or other agents useful in the treatment of HIV is comtemplated, as<br><br>
wed as a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one compound of formula I and one or more antiviral or other agents useful in the treatment of solid organ transplant rejection, graft v. host disease, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis; a kit comprising separate dosage forms of the actives for treating HIV, solid organ transplant rejection, graft v. host disease, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis is also contemplated.<br>

Certain CCR5 antagonist compounds of the invention may exist in different isomeric (e.g., enantiomers, diastereoisomers and atropisomers) forms. The invention contemplates all such isomers both in pure form and in admixture, including racemic mixtures.<br>
Certain compounds will be acidic in nature, e.g. those compounds which possess a carboxyl or phenolic hydroxyl group. These compounds may form pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Examples of such salts may include sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminum, gold and silver salts. Also contemplated are salts formed with pharmaceutically acceptable amines such as ammonia, alkyl amines, hydroxyalkylamines. N-methylglucamine and the like.<br>
Certain basic compounds also form pharmaceutically acceptable salts, e.g., acid addition salts. For example, the pyrido-nitrogen atoms may form salts with strong acid, while compounds having basic substituents such as amino groups also form salts with weaker acids. Examples of suitable acids for salt formation are hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, citric, oxalic, malonic, salicylic, malic, fumaric, succinic, ascorbic, maleic, methanesulfonic and other mineral and carboxylic acids well known to those in the art. The salts are prepared by contacting the free base form with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce a salt in the conventional manner. The free base forms may be regenerated by treating the salt with a suitable dilute aqueous base solution such as dilute aqueous NaOH, potassium carbonate, ammonia and sodium bicarbonate.

The assay quantitatively determines if compounds exhibit agonist characteristics by inducing activation of the receptor or alternatively antagonist properties by measuring inhibition of RANTES binding in a competitive or non-competitive fashion. Chemotaxis Assav:<br>
The chemotaxis assay is a functional assay which characterizes the agonist vs. antagonist properties of the test compounds. The assay measures the ability of a non-adherent murine cell line expressing human CCR5 (BaF-550) to migrate across a membrane in response to either test compounds or natural ligands (i.e., RANTES, M1P-1(I). Cells migrate across the permeable membrane towards compounds with agonist activity. Compounds that are antagonists not only fail to induce chemotaxis, but are also capable of inhibiting cell migration in response to known CCR5 ligands.<br>
The role of CC chemokine receptors such as CCR-5 receptors in inflammatory conditions has been reported in such publications as Immunoloov Letters. 57. (1997), 117-120 (arthritis); Clinical &amp; Experimental Rheumatoloqv. 17 (4) (1999), p. 419-425 (rheumatoid arthritis); Clinical &amp; Experimental Immunology, 117 (2) (1999). p.237-243 (atopic dermatitis); International Journal of Immunopharmacoioav. 20 (11) (1998). p. 661-7 (psoriasis); Joumal of Allercy &amp; Clinical Immunology, 100 (6, Pt 2) (1997). p. S52-5 (asthma); and Journal of Immunology. 159 (6) (1997). p. 2962-72 (allergies).<br>
In the assay to determine HIV replication, compounds of the invention range in activity from an IC50 of about 0.1 to about 1000 nM, with preferred compounds having a range of activity from about 0.1 to about 100 nM. more preferably about 0.1 to about 10 nM.<br>
