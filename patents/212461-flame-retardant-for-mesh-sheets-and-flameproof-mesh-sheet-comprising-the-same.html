[Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a halogen-free flameproof mesh sheet used outdoors such as a construction site for a long time.<br>
[0002]<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
In recent years, there has been a trend toward the construction of buildings having a large number of stories in the construction industry. Meanwhile, there has been an increase in the number of houses having a small number of stories. Flameproof mesh sheets for safety and protection, flameproof mesh sheets for houses having a small number of stories and scattering prevention flameproof mesh sheets must be laid in these buildings and regulations are becoming<br><br>
more and more strict.. Currently used flameproof mesh sheets and scattering prevention   flameproof mesh sheets; are produced by weaving yarn prepared by coating a polyester, nylon or polypropylene multi-filament fiber with a vinyl chloride-based paste resin composition and heating and then heating the obtained cloth and by coating a fabric prepared by weaving and processing a multi-filament fiber with a vinyl chloride-based paste resin composition, heating and processing to a desired shape, respectively. The resin composition for coating a fiber and fabric comprises a vinyl chloride resin containing chlorine as a resin and a chlorine-based flame retardant such as chlorinated paraffin, bromine-based flame retardant such as decabromodiphenyl oxide or inorganic flame retardant such as antimony trioxide (Examined Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 52-41786, 53-18065 and 61-9430 , Plastics, February, 1991). In recent years, it has been globally demanded to avoid I he use of resins and flame retardants containing elemental halogen which generates harmful gas at the time of combustion from the viewpoint of the environmental    <br>
retardant prepared by dispersing red phosphorus and ammonium phosphate in an aqueous dispersion of an ethylene-vinyl acetate-acrylate copolymer or an aqueous dispersion comprising the aqueous dispersion and an aqueous dispersion of nn  ethylene-based (i-olefin copolymer and/or an aqueous dispersion of a polyurethane. The inventor of the present invention has proposed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 9-225464 a halogen- free flame retardant comprising an aqueous dispersion of a polyolefin resin as a flame retardant. This flame retardant has an excellent effect but there is seen a tendency toward an increase in the viscosity of the flame i retardant due to time changes during storage. [0003] [Problem to Be Solved by the Invention] In view of the above situation, it is an object of the present invention to provide a flame retardant for halogen-free flameproof mesh sheets which does not experience a rise in viscosity during storage and does not generate harmful halogen gas at the time of combustion, and a flameproof mesh sheet comprising the same.    <br>

[0005]<br>
[Embodiments of the Invention]	|<br>
An aqueous dispersion of an ethylene-vinyl acetate-<br>
acrylate copolymer is used as a base materialin the present<br>
invention because a multi-filament fiber and fabric are<br>
fully impregnated with a flame retardant and uniformly<br>
coated with the flame  retfardant. The aqueous dispersion<br>
makes impregnation and coating easy,	i<br>
[0006]<br>
The ethylene-vinyl acetate-acrylate copolymer used in the present invention advantageously comprises 2 to 30 wt%<br>
1 <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
because when a resin composition containing red phosphorus is brought close to flames, the resin and red phosphorus on the surface first burn and the resin is bonded to oxygen in the air to become carbon dioxide gas, water and carbon.  In this case, red phosphorus promotes the carbonization of the ethyiene-vinyl acetate-acrylate copolymer and the ethylene-based a-olefin copolymer and/or the polyurethane.  Meanwhile, rod phosphorus is bonded to oxygen to become an oxide which is further bonded to water to become condensation phosphoric acid.  A film made from a mixture of carbon and condensation phosphor i c acid formed on the surface of the resin becomes an oxygon impermeable layer,<br>
suppresses the combustion of the resin and makes the resin flame resistant. Therefore, the ethylene-vinyl acetate-acrylate copolymer containing a large amount of oxygen is effective in forming condensat ron red phosphoric acid.<br>
red phosphorus must be existent in an amount of 1.5 to<br><br><br>
In this case, when an ammonium polyphosphate compound is existent, it thermally decomposes at the time of combustion and generates nitrogen gas which shuts off oxygen.  The ammonium polyphosphate compound promotes the carbonization of the ethylene-vinyl acetate-acrylate copolymer as a dehydrocarbonizing agent and improves a flame retarding effect while it generates nitrogen-containing gas.  In the present invention, the ammonium polyphosphate compound must be existent in an amount of 15 to 70 parts by weight based on   100 parts by weight of the solid content of an aqueous<br>
dispersion of an ethylene-vinyl acetate-acrylate copolymer<br>
i<br>
having a solid content of 35 to 75 %. Below 15 parts by weight, a flame retarding effect is not provided and above<br>
70 parts by weight, a flame retarding effect is not improved.<br>
i<br>
When an ethylene-based a-olefin copolymer and a polyurethane are used in combination with the aqueous dispersion of the ethylene-vinyl acetate-acrylate copolymer, the above amounts of red phosphorus and ammonium polyphosphate are based on 100 parts by weight of the total resin solid content. [0014]<br>
Nova Excel 140 or Nova Red 120 (Rin Kagaku Kogyo Co.) is used as   red phosphorus.<br>
TERRAJU-60 or TERRAJU-70 (Chisso Corp.), or Hostafuram AP462 (Hoechst Japan Co.) is used as the ammonium polyphosphate compound.<br>
When a metal hydroxide is further used, a great flame . retarding effect is obtained advantageously. The metal<br><br>
i<br>
hydroxide is preferably magnesium hydroxide or aluminum<br>
hydroxide which can be used in conjunction with' red<br>
i<br>
!<br>
phosphorus and ammonium polyphosphate to obtain a greater<br>
effect. The metal hydroxide must be existent in an amount of<br>
j 60 to 150 parts by weight based on 100 parts by! weight of<br>
the polyolefin resin solid content of the aqueous dispersion<br>
of the ethylene-vinyl acetate-acrylate copolymer.<br>
When the amount of the metal hydroxide is smaller than 60 parts by weight based on the resin solid content, its effect of promoting flame retardancy is small and when the amount is larger than 150 parts by weight, the viscosity of the aqueous dispersion of the ethylene-vinyl acetate-acrylate copolymer increases disadvantageously.<br>
[0015]<br>
As the aluminum hydroxide is used Hijilitel H-42M or Hijilite H-43M (Showa Denko K.K,).<br>
As the magnesium hydroxide is used Klsuma 5 (Kyowa Kagaku Kogyo Co.).<br>
(0016]<br>
A description is subsequently given of a flameproof mesh shoot comprising the flame retardant of the present invention .<br>
The multi-filament used in the present invention is at least one multi-filament selected from polyesters, nylons, polypropylene and vinylon.  It is preferably a polyester fiber from viewpoints of strength and thermal shrinkage.<br>
A high-strength and lightweight flameproof mesh sheet<br><br>
can be obtained by controlling the tensile strength of the multi-filament fiber to 6 to 10 g/denier. A flameproof mesh sheet having high toughness and high impact energy absorption at the time of falling can be obtained by controlling the elongation at break of the multi-filament fiber to 14 to 45 %.<br>
The multi-filament which is treated with a flame retardant and then woven has an equivalent single fineness of 3 to 17 denier, preferably 3 to 12 denier, particularly preferably 4 to 9 denier and a total fineness of 500 to 4,500 denier, preferably 1,000 to 3,500 denier, particularly preferably 1,500 to 3,000 denier.<br>
[0017]<br>
The multi-filament used in a fabric which is woven and then treated with a flame retardant has an equivalent single fineness of 2 to 13 denier, preferably 2 to 11 denier, particularly preferably 2.5 to 9 denier and a total fineness of 150 to 2,500 denier, preferably 200 to 2,000 denier, particularly preferably 250 to 1,500 denier. By controlling tensile strength to 6 to 10 g/denier, a high-strength and lightweight flameproof mesh sheet can be obtained and by controlling elongation at break to 14 to 45 %, a flameproof mesh sheet having high toughness and high impact energy absorption at the time of falling can be obtained.<br>
A flameproof mesh sheet which needs to have high strength and toughness is prepared by paralleling 2 to 4 filament fibers and weaving an imitation gauze out of the<br><br>
fibers with a Dobby weaving machine. A scattering prevention flameproof mesh sheet is prepared by weaving a; plain weave fabric out of a single filament fiber with a Weaving machine in most cases. A flameproof mesh sheet for houses having a I    small number of stores is prepared by weaving a plain weave fabric, imitation gauze or leno weave fabric in most cases. As for the solid content weight ratio of the flame<br>
retardant to the multi-filament fiber or fabric, the flame<br>
i<br>
retardant is used in an amount of 60 to 350 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the multi-filament fiber or fabric. When the solid content of the flame retardant is less than 60 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the multi-filament fiber or fabric, coating becomes nonuniform and the multi-filament fiber or the base of the fabric is partly exposed, thereby deteriorating outer appearance and weatherability. Further, fleuneproofness also lowers. When the solid content is more than 350 parts by weight, the weight of the flameproof mesh sheet increases with the result that handling properties deteriorate disadvantageously.<br>
A pigment, dye, plasticizer, ultraviolet absorber, optical stabilizer, antioxidant, stabilizer, coupling agent, diluent:, thickening agent, foaming agent, mold preventing agent, alga preventing agent and the like can be used in conjunction with the flame retardant in the present invention by suitably selecting types and amounts thereof. [0018]<br><br>
A description Is subsequently given of a process for producing the flameproof mesh sheet of the present invention. When the flameproof mesh sheet of the present invention is produced using a multi-filament fiber, coated yarn prepared by coating the fiber with a flame retardant through a sizing nozzle and gelling by heating is taken up by a winder.  To increase the amount of the flame retardant coated on the multi-filmant fiber, the multi-filament fiber is   pass through the sizing nozzle at least two times to be coated with the flame retardant, gelled by heating and taken up by a winder. This coated yarn taken up by the winder is woven into a fabric by a weaving machine. This fabric is introduced into a heating furnace and heated for non-shifting processing in order to obtain gray cloth.<br>
This cloth is cut to a predetermined size, sewed and<br>
I<br>
subjected to non-shifting processing to obtain a halogen-free flameproof mesh sheet.<br>
When the flameproof mesh sheet of the present invention is produced using a fabric, woven cloth is obtained by weaving the multi-filament fiber with a Dobby weaving machine. After this woven cloth is immersed in a tank filled with a flame retardant for mesh sheets and let pass through the tank, it is dried with an air blow, introduced into a heating furnace and gelled by heating to obtain coated cloth. To increase the amount of the flame retardant coated on the cloth, the cloth is immersed in and let pass through the tank filled with the flame retardant at least two times to<br><br>
produce coated cloth. The cloth is cut to a predetermined size, sewed and subjected to non-shifting processing to produce a halogen-free flameproof mesh sheet.<br>
[0019]<br>

heating furnace at 180"C to produce coated yarn of 3,588<br>
I<br>
denier. The weight ratio of the flame retardant for mesh<br>
