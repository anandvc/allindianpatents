Title<br>
This invention relates to herbal compositions for treatment of aids and preparation thereof. Background of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to Herbal Compositions for effective treatment of AIDS and preparation thereof. The herbal compositions provided by the present invention are compositions prepared by using various parts of plants and provide non-toxic formulations useful for the treatment of AIDS and HIV.<br>
AIDS and HIV are the most dreaded diseases of the 20th Century and by the end of 20th century an estimated 25 million HIV infected patients were suffering from this dreaded disease and the number of the patients suffering from these diseases is ever increasing. Almost 90% of these patients live in developing countries. Amongst these developing countries also Asian continent has the highest number of patients.<br>
A number of compositions particularly nucleoside analog reverse Transcription inhibitors (NTRIs) and protease inhibitors are available, however the costly compositions prepared therefrom are out of reach of the common patients in the developing countries. These compounds also have severe toxic effects. Till date no effective treatment for these diseases has been found and attempts are being made by the mankind to reduce the hardships of the patients suffering from these disease. Various chemical and other allopathic medicines are available for treatment of these diseases.<br>
For example, the international patent WO 02/32444 provides herbal compositions for treating patients with liver disease and HIV comprising various parts of different plants such as Herba Hedyotidis diffusae, Rhizoma Bistortae, Rhizoma Polygoni Cuspidati, and Fructus Schisandrae and so on and a method for treatment using the compositions mentioned therein.<br>

While there are no proclaimed drugs or therapies available to cure the AID and HIV, certain herbal formulations developed and provided by the present invention can reduce the hardships and pains of the said patients and prolong their life span considerably.<br>
There is no specific curative / preventive medicine available so far for AIDS. Whichever medicines are available in the market; do not give desired curative effect. The allopathic medicines used for treatment of AIDS in the form of capsule with a view to boost-up the immunity of human Body. The said treatment is very expensive and has many side effects like loss of appetite, abdominal pain, anemia, headache, dysentery, fever, convulsion, kidney failure &amp; chance of damaging liver.<br>
Even in today's modern medicinal world, no allopathic drugs are available in the market, which can reduce the HIV viral load of AIDS patient. The compositions provided by the present invention for treatment AIDS are cheaper as compared to the other allopathic medicines available in the market and have no side effects. It reduces the HIV viral load to undetectable level i.e. 0 to 20 copies / ml. It also increases the strength of human immunity system to normal.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide herbal compositions for effective treatment of HIV and AIDS.<br><br>
Another objective is to provide the compositions having no significant toxic effect which can reduce the HIV viral load considerably to undetectable level and increase the strength of the immunization system to near normal.<br>
A still further objective is to provide a method for preparation of these compositions and a method of treatment of HIV and AIDS patients.<br>
