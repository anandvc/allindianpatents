A safe and Self-maneuvering Dumbbell Press exercise machine for robust musculo-skeletal build-up, which can be handled and performed by the Exerciser by using it in any position such as flat bed press, inclined press or declined press and with provision to add or reduce weights without assistance of second person has been devised.<br>
Field of Invention:<br>
This invention relates to a new kind of Dumbbell press exercise machine suiting the natural musculoskeletal make up of a person and having the convenience of performing shoulder dumbbell press, flat bench and declined bench press on same device by the performer by himself without assistance of second person and is quite different from conventional Dumbbell Press and is totally new and novel from the existing machines which do not offer the convenience and ease of operation of any of the functions of the present invention.<br>
Background of Invention:<br>
Existing machines and free weights like dumbbells are popular among most weight lifters because lifting movements are not restricted to prescribed planes of motion and at prescribed angles. Free weights are also versatile because a variety of exercises can be performed with one set of weights and is relatively inexpensive. However, there are many disadvantage associated with free weights and for the sake of safety many instructors strongly advise or disallow an individual working out by himself or herself to avoid possibility of dropping a weight on a body part causing serious injury or twisting or spraining of muscles due to slips while lifting dumbbells. Another disadvantage of free weight is that the constant weight resistance is always vertically downward by gravity.    But the movement of the arm and the<br><br>
resistance capability of the muscles of the human body vary with time during the exercise and resistance decreases with increase in time, thereby putting the individual and his assistant in greater risk. The movement of both the arms is also not vertical and parallel resulting in improper muscle development and indirect bodily complications and injuries.<br>
As a result, the benefits are minimized and not achieved efficiently. Observing and qualifying musculo-skeletal movements of the body in comparison to weight lifting movements point out that most musculo-skeletal movements are rather complex and involve multiple joints with multi degree of freedom.<br>
Hence an objective of this invention is to provide a safe, secure and proper machine that combines all the features of an inclined press or shoulder press, flat bench press and declined press in one device which can be operated by an individual without assistance of another person and with built-in safety mechanism and at the same time a device that more naturally accommodates the musculo-skeletal movements of a person's shoulder and arms.<br>
Importance of Invention of the Machine:<br>
Many body builders, athletes and non-athletes utilize Dumbbells or Dumbbell press exercisers to build and shape up the shoulder muscles and chest muscles, improve overall robust appearance. As safety is built-in to prevent accidents, especially to beginners and those rugged performers who are exhausted after sustained exercise, preventing physical injury is a unique feature of this machine. Another feature of the machine is that the performer can independently operate the machine for any position, can on his/her own add or remove weights and change the mode of bench press at ease. Even non-body builders will be encouraged to use or switch over to this machine as in figure 1 in view of the advantageous features. This machine is portable can<br><br>
be easily assembled or dismantled and can be used by both men and women Independently indoor without any person's assistance. This machine is a boon to gymnasiums, body builders, hotels, fitness centers, physical education institutions and researchers and to persons who wish to exercise in privacy.<br>
Statement of Invention:<br>
A Dumbbell Press exercise machine comprising a vertical portal frame mounted on a rectangular base frame, a symmetrically inclined guide frame (0 and (M) within two horizontal support logs (h) (i) and (j) (k) inwardly inclined at 60^' (sixty degrees) from extreme ends of bottom log (j, k) and converging at about top log in an equilateral triangle mounted on vertical portal frame and having a pivot perpendicular to inclined guide logs (f) and (f1) projected at the outer side of the inclined guide logs to hold removable disc weights and a handle grip (s) with spring or clutch lock mechanism (o) projected horizontally on the inner side of the guide logs both the pivot and handle together attached to friction free roller slides along the plane of inclined logs, mounted on each of the two inclined logs of the said frame, the horizontal support logs (h) (i) and (j) (k) having slide connected by wire rope (g) passing over two pulleys (p-1) and (p-2) connected to a wheel with lock mechanism (m); a centrally laid single folding bench press mounted on the base metal frame below and across perpendicular point of convergence of symmetrically inclined guide frame connected to the bottom horizontal log of symmetrically inclined guide frame at one end and guided longitudinally on the base metal frame of the portal frame.<br>
A Dumbbell exercise machine as described in the complete specification and as illustrated by way of drawings accompanying the complete specifications in Figures 1 to 7.<br><br>
Construction of the Machine;<br>
The machine consists of a vertical metal portal frame suitably braced, strengthened and erected over a stable, free, rectangular base metal frame, the vertical logs of the portal frames being erected at 90 Degrees on the plane of the rectangular base. An independent symmetrically inclined guide frame inclined inwardly at 60 degrees held to horizontal metal logs at top and bottom, the ends of horizontal metal logs being fitted with slide rollers on four ends move vertically on the guides across the vertical logs of the vertical metal portal frame along its height and controlled through wire rope, pulleys and a rod fixed a top, parallel to horizontal log of vertical metal portal frame with one side of the pulley and wire rope mechanism connected to a cross handle or wheel locking system. The symmetrically inclined guide frame can be moved up or down to the desired elevation by rotating the cross handle or wheel with locking mechanism and connected to the symmetrically inclined guide frame through the rope, pulleys and rod.<br>
Each of the two inclined parts of the symmetrically inclined guide frame inclines at 60 degrees, that is inwardly from the extreme ends of horizontal log so that one is a mirror image of the other from a perpendicular mid plane of the vertical metal portal frame and the inclined frames would help formation of an equilateral triangle if joined together instead of connecting to horizontal base or bottom and top metal logs, is provided with a pivot angled at about 60 degrees from the plane of horizontal logs of the symmetrically inclined guide frame and perpendicular to respective inclined guide log to accommodate removable disc weights and projected at the outer sides of guide frame. A handle with spring or clutch grip lock in horizontal projection parallel to horizontal logs, attached to the pivot and projecting on the inner side of each of the guide frame and both handle and pivot together fitted to a movable friction-less roller slides which slides across respective inclined guide logs of the symmetrically inclined guide frame. Each of the two handles can be<br><br>
independently grasped and pressed forwardly and upwardly in an accurate path along a vertical plane at the angles of the symmetrically inclined guide frame. To stop or lock the sliding weights at desired level by applying brake by a person lying on the bench press, a number of perforations are provided at suitable close intervals in the inner side of symmetrically inclined guide frame and when the spring or clutch grip on the handle is released, the handle and pivot locks at the immediately following lower or upper perforation. Releasing the spring or clutch grip lever at desired level would fix the sliding weights on the perforations at chosen level. Clutching the spring or clutch lever together with handle will enable the weights to be moved for performance by the persons lying on the bench press. Removable weights can be added or removed on the pivots projecting from each of the symmetrically inclined guide frame.<br>
A single folding bed, a bench press mechanism, is fitted longitudinally on the base rectangular metal frame with wheels or slides which can be rolled or moved longitudinally across the base rectangular metal frame, is mounted on the base metal frame at central plane on the front side at proper bench press height across the perpendicular point of convergence of the symmetrically inclined guide frame. The top end of the single folding log is connected to the base log of the symmetrically inclined guide frame at the median with a hinge/keel mechanism.<br>
The said bench adjusts and converts as an inclined bed. flat bed or declined bed, etc., depending upon the height at which the symmetrically inclined guide frame is fixed. If the symmetrically inclined guide frame is raised upwards, the bed adjusts itself towards inclined bench press position and if the guide frame is lowered so that the folding bench is flat, the bench turns a flat bench press and if continuously lowered, the bench becomes a declined bench press when the log connected to guide frame lowers to about 45 degrees below the horizontal log.<br><br>
The single folding bench press may be optionally substituted with an independent conventional bench press laid and operated independently and the dumbbell press operations can be performed.<br>
A person lying properly on the bench when it is in a position of inclined or flat bed or declined bench press or sitting in a convenient position can grasp one or both the handles and use active force to move the chosen weight(s) attached to the pivots of slides vertically forward and upwards and lock the weights at desired levels upon the inclined guide frame imitating the movement of a dumbbell press.<br>
It is possible to embody a simple mechanism to ensure that weights on both sides move in the same direction at same pace in times of need so that both arm muscles apply same pressure.<br>
The orientation of the guides of the inclined frame at 60 degrees inwards and its orientation with the folding bench press at all positions, viz., inclined, flat and declined press position ensures that the pivotal movement occurs parallel to the arm or arms of a person vertically along the directed planes that lead to convergence inwardly above the bed thereby making the Mega Dumbbell Press exercise machine a unique machine which combines the features of ail the positions of a dumbbell press and which naturally maximizes the musculoskeletal movements of a person.<br>
The invention has been explained in relation to specific embodiment. It is inferred that the foregoing description is only illustrative of the present invention and it is not intended that the invention be limited or resthctive thereto. Many other specific embodiments of the present invention will be apparent to one skilled in the art from the foregoing disclosure. All substitutions, alterations and modifications of the present invention that come<br><br>
within the scope of the claims hereunder are claims to which the present invention is readily susceptible without departing from the spirit of the invention.<br>
The scope of the invention should therefore be determined not with reference to the above description but should be determined with reference to appended claims along with full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled.<br>

The salient construction and working operations are described below.<br>
Description of the IVIachine:<br>
This machine as in figure 1 is completely fabricated with steel sections with bolted joints with gusser plates so that the entire frame acts rigidly as one single unit. Bolted construction is preferred to welded construction so that the machine can be easily assembled or dismantled by an individual and also can<br><br>
be easily transported. The machine consists of a horizontal i)eam (a) placed atop of two vertical columns (b). The vertical columns are provided with four rackers (c) so that the verticality is maintained ensuring no vibration or oscillation transversely or longitudinally during performance of exercise. The entire portal frame is placed over a base frame (d) and well connected by bolts with gusset plates (e). A symmetrically inclined guide frame having two inwardly inclined frames at 60 degrees (f) &amp; (f-1) mounted from the extreme corners of base or bottom horizontal log (h, i) and converges at about the top horizontal log (j, k). The ends (h, i, j, k) have slide connected by wire rope (g) passing over two pulleys (p-1 &amp; p-2), which move transversely on the iron rod (r). The Pulley (p-1) is connected to a wheel with lock mechanism (m). A single fold bench press (n) centrally mounted and supported on the base frame at one end and connected to the symmetrically inclined guide frame at the other end by keel mechanism (t) for easy change of position when the symmetrically inclined guide frame is moved up or down. The sliding pivots (q) angled perpendicular to the respective guide frames on both sides and which is 60 degrees from horizontal plane at the outer end and handle (s) horizontally mounted at the inner end with spring or clutch lock or lever (o) move smoothly with rollers on the 60 degrees inwardly inclined guide frames (f) and (f1). The spring or clutch lock or lever (o) can be clutched to the fixed perforations (t) by simply releasing the clutch. The dimension of the entire machine is well proportioned and optimized to accommodate a person conveniently lying on the single fold bed (fb). Weights can be inserted or removed in the sliding pivots (q) as required either on one side or on both sides. By rotating the cross handle (m) by user of spring lever (rl) by foot or hand, the guide frame moves up or down and the following bench press changes its folding angle accordingly to make it an inclined (shoulder press) bench, flat bed or declined bench press. The person laying on the bench pushes the handle (s) forwardly and upwardly with active force either one or both handles according to the need.<br><br>
Conclusion:<br>
It is to be understood by all concerned that the embodiment of this invention is a preferred one and is not a limited one. Other alternative embodiment will be apparent to a person skilled in the art. For example the situational orientation of some parts and automation of parts of operation are not critical and can be modified as long as the position of the bed and the inclination of guides provided with the smooth slides are maintained Parallel to the shoulder/arm of the person. While the particular angle shown are considered optimum at this point of time, based upon feed back information from users further refining may be possible. Accordingly it is to be understood that modifications may be made without departing from the scope and principle of invention, as particularly set forth and claimed and such modifications shall fall within the scope of the claims herein.<br><br><br><br><br>
