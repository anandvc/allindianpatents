THE PATENTS ACT 1970<br>
[39 OF 1970]<br>
COMPLETE   SPECIFICATION<br><br><br>
CYLINDER HEAD FOR AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE<br><br>
AVL LIST GMBH, a Firm according to Austrian Law, Hans-List-Platz 1, A-8020 Graz, Austria<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br>
GRANTED<br>
9/5/2005<br><br>
The invention relates to a cylinder head for an internal combustion engine with at least one cylinder head base which is arranged in a housing and in which at least one aperture of a gas<br>
exchange port is provided, with the cylinder head base and the housing consisting of different<br>
materials.	<br>
From EP 0 120 223 A2 a cylinder head is known with a cylinder head base which is pressed into the cylinder head housing and is arranged as a circular plate. The plate produced by sintering is used as a heat-insulating component. Valve seats made of steel are' embedded in the plate which is substantially made of mullite.<br>
Furthermore, a composite cylinder head-for internal combustion engines with a two-piece cylinder head is known from US 4 774.912, which cylinder head is provided with a cylinder head base which is connected with the cylinder head housing. The cylinder head base consists<br>
of a material which is provided with a higher strength than the cylinder head housing.<br>
The disadvantage in known cylinder heads with a separately arranged cylinder head base is that in some cases a detachment of the connection occurs between the cylinder head base and the cylinder head housing.<br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention to avoid such disadvantages and to further develop a cylinder head base of the kind mentioned above in such a way that a secure and non-detachable connection is produced between the cylinder head base and the ambient housing.<br>
This occurs in accordance with the invention in such a way that the cylinder head base is<br>
provided with at least one positive-locking zone and the cylinder head base is cast into the<br>
housing. This leads to a positive connection between the cylinder head base and the housing,<br>
thus avoiding any detachment of the connection even after longer periods of operation.<br>
A secure connection can also be achieved in such a way in particular that the positive-locking<br>
zone is provided with at least one projection and/or a recess of the edge of the cylinder head<br>
base. Manufacturing is particularly simple when the positive-locking part is provided with an<br>
annular circular arrangement.	<br>
It is provided that a positive-locking zone is arranged on the jacket of the cylinder head base. Further positive-locking zones can be  moulded, at the side averted from the combustion chamber, into the zone of the edge and into the zone of the aperture of the gas exchange ports in the cylinder head base. Such positive- locking zones around the gas exchange ports are also used for preventing oil leakages.<br>
It is provided for in a particularly preferable embodiment that the cylinder head base consists of a single material and the valve seat surfaces for the gas exchange valves are incorporated<br><br>
into the cylinder head base. It is thus possible to omit separate detachable valve seat rings.<br>
This allows providing the distance between the apertures of the gas exchange ports in the<br>
cylinder head base with a considerably! smaller size than when using valve seat rings, thus<br>
enabling the aperature cross section of the gas exchange ports to be provided with a<br>
substantially larger arrangement. The gain in cross-sectional surface can be up to 50% and<br>
more.	<br>
In a further development of the invention it can be provided that the cylinder head base is<br>
provided with at least one aperture for a component which opens into the combustion<br>
chamber, preferably for a spark plug and/or an injection valve, and the pocket for fastening<br>
the mounting part is provided with an integral arrangement with the cylinder head base.<br>
Mounting parts such as spark plugs and/or injection valves can thus be directly fastened to the<br>
cylinder head base.	<br>
A particular simple way of production can be obtained when at least one valve guide body to form the valve guidance for the gas exchange valves is arranged integrally with the cylinder head base. The valve guide body can thus be cast jointly with the cylinder head base into the housing without requiring any further positioning measures. In order to achieve a secure connection between the valve guide body and the ambient housing it is provided that the valve guide body is provided on the outside with a positive-locking body, preferably in form of an at least circular swelling. The connection between the valve guide body and the cylinder head floor can occur preferably by way of a bridge.<br>
A further particularly preferable embodiment provides that a cylinder face bushing is arranged integrally with, the cylinder head base. A secure connection with the housing is achieved in such a way that at least one positive-locking zone is arranged on the outer side of the Cylinder ' face bushing.<br>
The cylinder head base is preferably made of cast iron, e.g. from grey cast iron with lamellar,<br>
spheroidal or vermicular graphite or from cast steel. The housing can be made of light metal,<br>
e.g. of aluminium..	i<br>
The gas exchange ports are formed in such a way that their walls can be produced by a steel chill. After the casting process, the steel; chill is drawn out of the gas exchange ports either in the shape of an arc or in a straight line.<br>
The production of the cylinder head is performed in such a way that the cylinder head base, which is preferably made of an iron material, is placed in a permanent casting mould and is cast-in with the material for the housing. The cylinder head base is preheated prior to the casting in and, optionally, is also etched slightly on the surface in order to achieve a favourable metallic bonding with the cast-in material.<br><br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to a cylinder head for an internal combustion engine with at least one cylinder head base which is arranged in a housing and in which at least one aperture of a gas exchange port is provided, with the cylinder head base and the housing consisting of different materials, characterized in that the cylinder head base is provided with at least one positive-locking zone and the cylinder head base is cast into the housing.<br>
The invention is now explained below in closer detail by reference to the enclosed drawings, wherein:<br>
