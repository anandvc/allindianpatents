CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application is a non-provisional application that claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) of provisional application U.S. Serial No. 60/532,227 filed December 23, 2003, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to phosphate esters of florfenicol, including a florfenicol prodrug having superior water solubility, and phosphate esters of florfenicol analogs.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Florfenicol is a structural analog of thiamphenlcol, which in turn is a derivative of chloramphenicol [see, e.g., U.S. 4,235,892, U.S. 5,352,832, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties].<br><br>
Florfenicol is a broad spectrum antibiotic with activity against many gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including utility in the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections due to susceptible pathogens in birds, reptiles, fish, shellfish and mammals. One of florfenicol's primary uses is in the treatment of pneumonia and associated respiratory infections in cattle (often referred to generically as Bovine Respiratory Disease or BRD) caused by Mannhemia haemolyiica, Pasturella muliocida and/or Haemophilus somnus, also known as Histophilus somni. It is also . indicated in the treatment of: pododermatitis in cattle caused by Fusobacterium<br><br>
necrophorum and Bacterioides melaninogenicus; swine respiratory disease caused by Pasteurella multocida, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. Streptococcus suis, Salmonella cholerasuis and/or Mycoplasma spp.; colibacillosis In chickens caused by Escherichia coli; enteric septicemia in catfish caused by Edwardsiella ictaluri; and furunculosis In salmon caused by Aeromonas salmonicida. Other genera of bacteria that have exhibited susceptibility to florfenicoj include Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Bordetella, Proteus and Shigella. In particular, chloramphenicol-resistant strains of organisms, such as K. pneumorjiae, E. cloacae, S. typhus and E. coli, are susceptible to florfenicol.<br>
Florfenicol Is most often administered to subjects which can benefit from Its advantages either orally or parenterally, the latter being primarily intramuscular or intravenous. Due to its very low water solubility (approximately one mg/mL), organic solvents must be added to achieve the desired product concentration In a commercial formulation. For example, In NUFLOR® (veterinary-labeled florfenicol formulation in the United States and Canada), the organic solvents N-methylpyrrolldinone, propylene glycol and/or polyethylene glycol are used to afford florfenicol solubility of 300 mg/mL. Unfortunately, when administered parenterally, these solvents often cause significant localized irritation. Therefore, there is a need for a more water-soluble form of florfenicol.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention therefore, provides a water-soluble form of florfenicol that has substantially greater aqueous solubility than florfenicol itself. Preferably a water-soluble form of florfenicol of the present invention Is also a prodrug that rapidly and efficiently converts to florfenicol in vivo. One aspect of the present invention therefore provides a florfenicol phosphate ester {e.g., a florfenicol prodrug) having the chemical structure:<br><br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, the present invention provides an esterified form of florfenicol {e.g., a florfenicol prodrug) or an esterified form of a florfenicol analog. Such esterified forms are extremely soluble in water and can be used to treat and/or prevent bacterial infections. When the water-soluble forms of florfenicol or a florfenicol analog are<br><br>
administered to a subject, the esterlfied form of florfenicol or the florfenicol analog is efficiently converted to free florfenicol, or the free florfenicol analog, respectively.<br>
In order to more fully appreciate the instant invention, the following definitions are provided.<br>
As used herein, a "pharmaceutical composition" refers to a formulation of a phosphate ester of florfenicol, including salts thereof, of the present invention {e.g., a florfenicol prodrug) or a formulation of a phosphate ester of florfenicol analog, including salts thereof, of the present invention, with a pharmaceutically acceptable exipient, and/or carrier. In a particular embodiment, the carrier is a solvent {e.g., water).<br>
An "excipient" refers to an inert substance added to a pharmacological composition to further facilitate administration of an active ingredient. Examples, without limitation, of excipients include calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars and types of starch, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, vegetable oils and polyethylene glycols.<br>
The term "therapeutically-effective amount," as used herein, refers to that amount of a prodrug of the present invention that will hydrolyze sufficiently rapidly and in sufficient amounts to provide florfenicol (or florfenicol analog) in a concentration at which it can relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms of a bacterial infection in a subject. In particular embodiment, a therapeutically-effective amount refers to that amount of a florfenicol phosphate ester of the present invention that, when administered to a subject, delivers florfenicol to a subject in a sufficient plasma concentration to: (1) reduce, and preferably eliminate, the population of bacterial cells in a subject's body; (2) inhibit {i.e., slow, or preferably stop) proliferation of the bacterial cells; (3) inhibit {i.e., slow, preferably stop) spread of the bacterial infection; and/or (4) relieve (preferably eliminate) one or more symptoms associated with the infection.<br>
The term "prophylactically-effective amount" refers to the amount of a prodrug of florfenicol, or florfenicol analog, of the present invention, that provides, upon hydrolysis, a sufficient plasma concentration of florfenicol, or the corresponding florfenicol analog, to: (1) maintain a reduced level of a population of bacterial cells achieved by a previously-administered therapeutically-effective amount of the prodrug or some other appropriate drug; (2) maintain the level of inhibition of the proliferation<br><br>
ol bacterial cells achieved by administration of a therapeutically-effectlve amount of a drug; (3) maintain the degree of inhibition of the spread of the infection achieved by a therapeutically-effective amount of a drug; and/or (4) maintain the level of relief of one or more symptoms, or if symptoms were eliminated, maintain the non-existence of symptoms associated with a bacterial infection achieved by administration of a therapeutically-effective amount of a prodrug {e.g., of florfenicol) of the present invention or some other appropriate drug. A prophylactically-effective amount also refers to that amount of a composition comprising a florfenicol prodrug of the present invention, or a florfenicol analog prodrug of the present invention, that will deliver florfenicol, or the florfenicol analog, in a sufficient plasma concentration to prohibit bacteria from accumulating in a susceptible organism in sufficient quantity to cause an infection.<br>
An "aprotic solvent" refers to an organic solvent that does not include one or more hydrogen atoms bonded to an oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur atom, which hydrogen is capable of dissociation or participation in hydrogen bonding.<br>
As used herein, a "suitable" solvent refers to a solvent in which the reactants can dissolve and which does not adversely participate in the reaction, either by itself reacting with one or more components of the reaction mixture, or by interfering with the rfiaction of the components with one another. For any given reaction, selecting a suitable solvent is well within the ability of those skilled in the art and can be accomplished without undue experimentation.<br>
The term "subject" refers to an animal species capable of being infected by a pathogenic bacterium, and in a particular embodiment includes humans. Appropriate animal subjects also include those in the wild, livestock {e.g., raised for meat, milk, butter, eggs, fur, leather, feathers and/or wool), beasts of burden, research animals, companion animals, as well as those raised for/in zoos, wild habitats and/or circuses.<br>

In another embodiment, the subject is a companion animal. For purposes of the present invention, the term "companion" animal shall be understood to include housecats (feline), dogs (canine), rabbit species, horses (equine), rodents {e.g., guinea pigs, squirrels, rats, mice, gerbils, and hamsters), primates {e.g., monkeys) and avians, such as pigeons, doves, parrots, parakeets, macaws, canaries, and the like.<br>
Other animals are also contemplated to benefit from the inventive florfenicol phosphate esters, including marsupials (such as kangaroos), reptiles (such as farmed turtles), game birds, swans, ratites and other economically important domestic animals.<br>
As noted previously, florfenicol is sparingly soluble in water, i.e., to approximately 1 mg/mL. However, in commercial formulations, concentrations of 300 mg/mL or more are often desired. To achieve such concentrations, organic solvents in which florfenicol is readily soluble are used in formulations. Unfortunately, many of these solvents cause irritation that is sometimes quite severe when such florfenicol-containing compositions are administered to a subject by injection, a preferred mode<br><br>
of administration. The present invention supplies a solution to this problem by providing a florfenlcol prodrug that has improved water solubility, and moreover, can be used in an effective and efficient in vivo delivery of florfenlcol. Achieving this end, however, proved not to be a trivial matter.<br>
Many possible florfenlcol prodrugs, such as, for example, a glutarate ester of florfenlcol, are quite water soluble, i.e., over several hundred milligrams per milliliter. Many of these prodrugs, however, do not readily deliver florfenlcol in serum and therefore would not be expected to do so in vivo. For example, Rg. 1 shows that only approximately 6% of a glutarate ester of florfenlcol hydrolyzes back to florfenicol in bovine serum and only about 3% does so in rat serum after 4 hours of contact.<br>
Quite surprisingly, the florfenlcol phosphate ester of the present invention was found to not only have excellent solubility in water, i.e., over^OO mg/mL, but also to convert to florfenicol efficiently and In substantial amounts. This is also shown in Fig. 1, where It can be seen that over four hours in rat serum and bovine serum, the sodium salt of florfenicol phosphate is converted to the extent of approximately 40% and 60%, respectively. These levels of conversion in vitro would be considered by those skilled In the art as good indicators of therapeutically-effective conversion in vivo. As predicted, substantial concentrations of florfenicol were detected in the piabnia afiBr the iriiiavenous adiTiinistratlon of a florfenicol phosphate ester of the present invention in cattle, dogs, and pigs {see Figures 2-4).<br>
The florfenicol phosphate ester of the present Invention, e.g., florfenicol prodrug, and/or salts thereof (or phosphate esters of the florfenicol analogs and/or salts thereof), can be administered to a subject by any conventional means, including orally, or by injection.<br>
It is preferable to have the florfenicol prodrug in an aqueous ready-to-use solution, when injections are to be administered. In order to achieve maximal stability and shelf-life of the florfenicol prodrug in a solution, preferably the molar ratio of the base {e.g., a free amine) that is combined with the acid form of the florfenicol phosphate ester is maintained in the range of 0.6-1.4 in their aqueous solutions. It Is more preferred to maintain this molar ratio in the 0,8 -1.2 range in the aqueous solution. It is even more preferred to maintain this molar ratio in the 0.9 - 1.1 range in the aqueous solution. In a particular embodiment, the pH of the solution should be maintained at approximately pH 4.5.<br><br>
The present invention may be better understood by reference to the following non-limiting examples, which are provided as exemplary of the invention. The following examples are presented in order to more fully illustrate embodiments of the invention and should in no way be construed as limiting the broad scope of the invention.<br><br>

Example 4: Conversion of florfenicol phosphate to florfenicol in serum<br>
Florfenicol phosphate may be dissolved in a 0.1 M phosphate (KH2PO4) buffered medium of rat or bovine serum at 37 "C. Then, 100 fxL of the florfenicol phosphate-containing medium may be removed after at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours, mixed with 100 ^xL acetonitrile (CH3CN) and analyzed by column chromatography (Zorbax C8 column 4.6 x 15 cm, eluent: 0.1% H3PO4/CH3CN) to determine the percent conversion of the prodrug to florfenicol.<br>
Example 5; Conversion of florfenicol glutarate to florfenicol In serum<br>
Florfenicol glutarate may be dissolved in a 0.1 M phosphate (KH2PO4) buffered medium of rat or bovine serum at 37 °C. Then, 100 fiL of the florfenicol glutarate-containing medium may be removed after at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours, mixed with 100 [iL acetonitrile (CH3CN) and analyzed by column chromatography (Zorbax C8 column 4.6 X 15 cm, eluent: 0.1% H3PO4/CH3CN) to determine the percent conversion of the prodrug to florfenicol.<br>
Example 6: Measurement of aqueous solubility of the phosphate ester prodrug of florfenicol<br>
Successive aliquots of solid phosphate ester prodrug (sodium salt) were added to water with agitation. Addition was continued until mixing became difficult due to high viscosity, at which point all of the prodrug remained in solution. An aliquot of this solution (of known volume) was diluted with a known quantity of water and was<br><br>
analyzed by HPLC to determine the original concentration, which was found to be greater than 700 mg/mL.<br>
Example 7: Stability of the phosphate prodrug In aqueous solutions.<br>
Although relatively stable in aqueous solutions, over prolonged periods of time the phosphate ester of florfenicol (Formula I) undergoes slow degradation resulting in the release of free florfenicol as well as the formation of cyclic phosphate diester. The formation of the cyclic diester occurs through the phosphate anion displacement of fluorine and requires participation of the phosphate di-anion, which is much more nucleophilic than the corresponding mono-anion. Therefore, the rate of formation of the cyclic diester is largely dependent on the pH of the solution or more generally, on the degree of the phosphate ionization. Heating a solution of the bis sodium salt of florfenicol phosphate prodrug results in almost quantitative conversion of the prodrug into cyclic diester. Satisfactory stability of aqueous solutions of the prodrug can be achieved when the amount close to one equivalent of either sodium hydroxide or ethanolamine is added to the concentrated aqueous solution of the florfenicol phosphate prodrug resulting in the pH range of approximately pH 4.5 to pH 5.5. However, even such small changes of pH result in noticeable differences of the amount of the cyclic phosphate diester formed.<br><br><br><br>
The florfenicol phosphate prodrug is less stable below pH 4 or at neutral or higher pH ranges. In addition, increased ionic strength reduces the aqueous stability of florfenicol phosphate prodrug in solution.<br>
Example 8: Conversion of florfenicol phosphate to florfenicol in cattle<br>
Florfenicol phosphate was dissolved in water to a concentration of approximately 600 nng/mL. The solution was then injected intravenously into three calves weighing 69 to 121 kg to provide a dose of approximately 10 mg/kg of calf body weight. Plasma samples were collected after drug administration and analyzed for concentrations of florfenicol by HPLC-MS/MS. Plasma florfenicol concentrations increased rapidly following treatment (Figure 2). These data demonstrate that the prodrug is rapidly cleaved to florfenicol in cattle.<br>
Example 9: Conversion of florfenicol phosphate to florfenicol in dogs<br>
Florfenicol phosphate was dissolved in water to a concentration of approximately 200 mg/mL The solution was then injected intravenously into three dogs weighing 9 to 15 kg to provide a dose of approximately 11 mg/kg of body weight. Plasma samples were collected after drug administration and analyzed for concentrations of florfenicol by HPLC-MS/MS. Plasma florfenicol concentrations<br><br>
increased rapidly following treatment (Figure 3). These data demonstrate that the prodrug is rapidly cleaved to florfenicol in dogs.<br>
Example 10: Conversion of florfenicol phosphate to florfenicol in swine<br>
Florfenicol phosphate was dissolved in water to a concentration of approximately 300 mg/mL. The solution was then injected intravenously into three pigs weighing 10 to 15 kg to provide a dose of approximately 6.7 mg/kg of body weight. Plasma samples were collected after drug administration and analyzed for concentrations of florfenicol. Plasma florfenicol concentrations increased rapidly following treatment (Figure 4). These data demonstrate that the prodrug Is rapidly cleaved to florfenicol in pigs.<br>
