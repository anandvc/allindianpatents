FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for conveVsion of organic solid waste to biofertilizer such as soil conditioning agents of fertilizer grade, culture grade and soil grade. In particular, the invention relates to a process for conversion of organic solid wastes to biofertilizers in the presence of selective geophagus earthworms Pheretima elongata to produce variety of valuable soil conditioning products in high yield by way of a simple and cost effective process.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Human and animal habitations generate large quantities of wastes. The organic fraction of these wastes often accumulates in the neighborhood of habitations and their decomposition products affect detrimentally the quality of soil, water and air. Many technologies are available to deal with organic wastes but most of these are energy intensive. Sanitary land filling is becoming unviable due to non-availability of landfill space. In biogas technology investments are large and subsequent liquid effluents consume much energy for disposal and solid product from such processes having low energy value for soil have limited market as fertilizer. Most current technologies face problems of acidity, culture fatalities and problems of process waste disposal. Composting has been practiced for over 50 years. However in the composting process bioenergy of the organic waste is lost and therefore the product retains very little energy for use in soil. In view of energy cost of composting operation; low value and low yield of product the technology becomes useful if disposal is the objective. Organic waste conversion to biomass briquettes is a useful technology but the energy cost of drying and briquetting is high and hence such technology is also unviable in many cases.<br>
There is thus a continuing long felt need for economically viable alternatives. An article by Krishnamoorthy, R.V;Vajranabhaiah,S.N; titled "Biological Activity of earthworm casts -an assessment of plant growth promoter levels in the casts" Proceedings of the Indian Academy of Sciences Animal sciences Vol. 95,no3,1986,pages 341-352) mentions worm casts of phytophagus (litter living) and geophagus (soil living) worms including Pheretima elongata. However the article does not teach any method or process technology to engage such populations for field applications.<br>
An article by Shanthi,N.R.; Bhoyar.R.V.; Bhide,A..D "Vermicomposting via phytophagus worms;"vermicomposting of vegetable wastes "Compost Science an Utilisation Fall 1993; vol 1,no4 ,Oct 1993 .pages 27-30 indicates advantages of worm excreta as a product for agriculture use. The method described in the article which engages phytophagus worm does not lead to a regenerative grade product that can be used in soils that lack organic overload<br>
An article by Asthana.G.P. titled "On the nitrogenous components in the earthworm Pheretima elongata", Indian Journal of Zoology -Vol 5 ,no2,1977,pages 12-16) indicates that geophagus worm supports many native nitrogen fixing population. This article does not teach how to exploit this feature to prepare fertiliser grade product.<br>

An article by Sihorwala,Tayeb.A;Kalra,Sudhir titled "Effect of different species of earthworm and their combination on carbon nitrogen ratio of black cotton soils and characterisation of vermi-composting powders produced from solid waste treatment by earthworm bio-technology" in Proceedings of the International Conference on Solid waste Technology and Management 13th (vol 2),7C/1,1-9 ,1997) mentions geophagus worms for solid waste conversion including using Pheretima elongata. This article also does not describe any viable method or process or technology for large scale solid waste conversion.<br>
An article by Wong.S.H, Griffiths.D.A titled ."Vermicomposting in the management of pig waste in Hong Kong" in World Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology ,Vol 7,no 6,pages 593-595,1991 discusses phytophagus worms for vermi-composting. The processes for composting suggested in this article are~faced with severe problems of worm disposal, culture run aways, soil acidity, culture fatalities and microbial quality of casts different from normal soils and hence are of limited value in agricultural applications.<br>
Use of redworms in Vermicomposting using Eisenia Foetida [Lee, K. E., Earthworms - Their ecology and relationship with soils &amp; land use, Academic Press, 1985] or such surface dwelling varieties is well known. However there are major drawbacks of such processes and formulations leading to low yield of vermicompost that is typically 100-200-kg/ton DM waste. Moreover, it requires well-macerated preferably animal excreta containing (Wong, S.H, et al., World Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology, Vol. 7, no. 6, pp 593-595, 1991; Shanti, N. R. et al. "vermicomposting of vegetable wastes", Compost Science and Utilisation, vol 1, no. 4, pages 27-30, 1993) 1 percent or more protein nitrogen and 70 percent moisture (Sihorwala, Tayeb et al. "Effect of different species of earthworm and their combination on carbon nitrogen ratio of black cotton soils and characterization of vermi-composting powders produced from solid waste treatment Technology and Management by Earthworm Bio-technology" Proceedings of the 13th International conference on Solid Waste Technology and Management, vol 2, 7C/1, pp1-9, 1997) limitation is that this organism effective at densities 50 - 100/m2 cannot live in its own excreta and they move horizontally and migrate away as the metabolite accumulates. In order to prevent this migration converted material is to be separated and fresh material is to be added to the process. This leads to low loading rates thereby requiring large space for the vermicomposting process. Culture replacement is also necessary. In view of the generated acidic environment abnormal bio indicators of acidic environment do appear and the use of other chemical pest control measures become necessary. When the acidity becomes very high it becomes essential to unearth the entire space and prepare the place afresh leading to long turnover times, loss of productivity, etc. Such redworm cultures not being native to healthy soils their disposal becomes problematic. Other issues related to the use of Eisenia foetida (all surface dwelling varieties) are sudden loss of culture and pest incidence.

Geophagus worms are known for their importance in agriculture (Krishnamoorthy, et al.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
The above disclosed process of the invention provides for a simple and cost effective process of converting of solid waste to biofertilizer in high yield involving the selective use of the culture media comprising geophagus earthworm culture<br>
4<br><br>
Pheretima elongata grown in an environment comprising plants with tap roots, and/or adventitious roots including bacterial culture, moisture and a mineral source.<br>
Yield of the process of the invention is typically 200 -1500 kg/ton raw waste depending on fertilizer grade, culture grade, soil grade SBT products but depends on nature of feed.<br>
Preferably, by adjusting additives and batch time can produce variety of product viz. fertilizer to culture grade to soil grade product. Typically products contain about 5-30% organics, about 55-90% minerals, about 10-20% moisture and rich in soil bacterial population and also containing geophagus earthworm culture. Cycle time of 14 weeks is typical. Smaller cycle time require more additives, mechanical shredding and intensive management.<br>
According to one embodiment of the process of the invention involves:<br>
a)	providing an appropriate geophagus earthworm culture Pheretima elongata by developing the culture in an environment comprising plants with tap roots, and/or adventitious roots providing i) about 20-30 g/m2.day organics such as animal dung, straw, leaf litter ii) moisture about 30-40 % iii) preferred mineral powder of about 5-10 g/m2.day;<br>
b)	maintaining the mix above under conditions for developing the cultures and sieving as powder less than 500 JJ, for use as source bacterial culture;<br>
c)	processing the organic waste, preferred mineral powder of a specific particle size range, soil, bacterial culture source under controlled moisture in a geophagus earthworm cultured in an environment comprising plants with tap roots, and/or adventitious roots for a required period ; and<br>
d)	maintaining the mix for sufficient period to effect conversion to desired biofertilizer and sieving to the required size range.<br>
In the above process of the invention the step of developing the bacterial culture required in a geophagus earthworm cultured in an environment comprising plants with tap roots, and/or adventitious roots is carried out by providing about 20-30 gm/m2.d organics such as ruminant animal (such animals in the wild or fed essentially on cellulosic residues) dung which is a source of potent bacterial culture, straw and leaf litter, Moisture 30-40 %, and preferred mineral powder less than 1000 \i size @ about 5-10 gm/m2.d; The mineral source used can be mineral powder in amounts of upto 200% w/w selected from sources containing silica (25 - 30% Si), alumina (about 6-8 % Al), Iron (about 1-6 % Fe), Potassium (about 2 - 8%), Calcium (about 2 -10%), Magnesium (about 1-3%), Phosphorous (about 0.003- 0.01%) etc. and containing micro nutrients.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention mineraLadditives such as primary rock powder of about 0.3-0.6 kg. per kg waste, natural phosphate powder (about 0.02-0.05 kg./kg. waste) and soil (about 0.05-0.2 kg/kg. waste), bacterial culture (about 0.01 kg/kg waste) are added to enable organic conversion in a cultured in an environment comprising plants with tap roots, and/or adventitious roots to fertilizer grade, culture grade, soil grade product.<br>
5<br><br>
Process control is achieved by adjusting loading rates, moisture levels and by addition of mineral powder so as to prevent anaerobic environment and as well to eliminate bioindicators of abnormality. Process monitoring is achieved by observing bioindicators of abnormality viz. mosquitoes, rats, odour and plant health. In accordance with another embodiment for large scale processing of organics the invention proposes the use of system of ridges and troughs of height/depth 1-3 M to carry out the conversion of organic waste for biofertilizer using the aforesaid geophagus earthworm cultured in an environment comprising plants with tap roots, and/or adventitious roots. The ridges can have the green plants that house the culture engaged in the process. For different capacities length of ridges and troughs can be adjusted. Higher loading as and when required can be achieved by adjusting ridge dimensions. The costs are low since energy inputs are low and thus would provide a cost-effective process for manufacture of biofertilizer.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, culture of the bacteria in the excreta of ruminants e.g. cow, bullock, buffalo, goat, sheep, etc. preferably fed on cellulose-based feed are selected. The bacterial culture is further propagated by mixing excreta with preferred mineral powder and developed further for about 4-6 weeks in geophagus earthworm cultured in an environment comprising plants with tap roots, and/or adventitious roots and harvested for use in different locations to give the appropriate bacterial culture.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the animal dung is mixed with preferred mineral powder and propagated further in a geophagus earthworm culture in an environment comprising plants with tap roots, and/or adventitious roots for about 7 -14days to give soil grade product.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention hospital organic waste can be disposed in geophagus earthworm cultured in an environment comprising plants with tap roots, and/or adventitious roots. The space is organized to receive the hospital organic waste for treatment using the invented process.<br>
Fertilizer grade product obtained following the process of the invention contains typically about 20-30% organics, about 50-65% minerals, and about 15 - 20% moisture. The culture grade product contains about 5-10% organic, about 70-80% minerals, about 10 - 15% moisture. The soil grade product contains about 10-15 % organic, about 65 - 75 % minerals and moisture about 10-15 %. All the products contain soil bacterial culture and geophagus earthworm culture.<br>
The invention is explained hereunder in greater detail in relation to non-limiting exemplary embodiments discussed hereunder:<br>
Example 1<br>
100 kg of cow dung is taken. It is mixed with 100 kg of mineral additive at ambient temperature of 25-28°C. Free Moisture content of the prepared mix is around 25 %. The mix is incubated in an earthworm-cultured bed for 7 days and moisture is maintained by sprinkling water. During the seven-day process the mix is monitored for pH and pest incidence. At the end of 7 days it is sun dried and sieved to less than 500 microns.<br>
6<br><br>
The final product obtained is of the following characteristics: (1) fragrant soil smell while free moisture is maintained out around 10-15 % (2) free flowing, (3) no pests and insects (4) contains about 10-15 % organics, about 65- 75 % minerals and 10-15 % moisture. The soil, product used as medium to grow potted plant shows vigorous plant growth indicating that the soil product is capable of being used as correction to eroded soils to restore productivity.<br>
Example 2<br>
100 kg of fresh food waste is taken and mixed with 50 kg of mineral powder, 100 g of bacterial culture and is processed in a geophagus earthworm cultured in an environment comprising plants with tap roots, and/or adventitious roots. Moisture is maintained at 20 percent and processing continued for 14 weeks.<br>
The final product is of the following characterisations: (1) fragrant soil smell while free moisture is maintained at 15-20 % (2) free flowing, (3) no pests and insects, (4) contain about 5-10 % organic, about 70 - 85 % mineral and about 10-15 % moisture. The culture grade product used as input to grow potted plants shows vigorous plant growth indicating that the culture grade product is capable of being used as correction to eroded soils to restore productivity.<br>
Example 3<br>
An organic waste processing plant to handle 16 tons per day of market organic<br>
waste is described. An area of 10800 m2 is earmarked. The space is organized as<br>
20 loading bays each of 30 M (8.0m base - 10.0m top) x 1.0m deep.    The<br>
environment  comprising  plants  with  tap  roots,   and/or adventitious  roots  are<br>
constructed on ground as ridges of size 30 M (2.0m base - 4.0m top) x 1.0m high.<br>
The environment comprising plants with tap roots, and/or adventitious roots serves<br>
as the reservoir of culture required for the process.   Suitable space for storage of<br>
additives and product are also provided.<br>
The entire space is cultured with geophagus earthworms.  Suitable green plants to<br>
house the earthworm culture are planted on the ridges.<br>
During loading, the waste is spread over the loading area. Mineral powder in the<br>
range 0.3-0.6 kg/ kg waste, soil in the range 0.1-0.2 kg./kg waste; bacterial culture<br>
0.01  kg/kg waste natural    phosphates if required 0.02-0.05 kg/kg waste are<br>
sprinkled.    Moisture is maintained at 20-30% on the soil.    The loaded area is<br>
periodically turned manually. This may also be turned mechanically by a tractor and<br>
lumps are mechanically shredded.<br>
A 14 weeks schedule for loading and as well 14 weeks schedule for curing /<br>
harvesting is engaged.<br>
During harvesting the material from the curing bays are dug out, screened and<br>
bagged.<br>
For the batches with any abnormal bioindicators more mineral powder is sprinkled<br>
and the material turned and allowed to process further for 2-3 days. The fertilizer<br>
grade product formed has moisture of 15-20 %, 20-30% organic, 50-65 % minerals<br>
and is free flowing.<br>
7<br><br>
Example 4:<br>
Hospital organic wastes are taken directly to geophagous earthworm cultured in an environment comprising plants with tap roots, and/or adventitious roots. The wastes are spread carefully on the processing area protected suitably via impervious lining. Soil in amount of 0.3 - 0.6 kg per kg waste and mineral powder @ 0.3 - 0.6 kg per kg waste are sprinkled. Loading is continued till the pit is full typically in 4 weeks. The processing is continued for 48 weeks. During processing the moisture in the pits was maintained at 30 - 40 %.<br>
The processed material is turned periodically. Non-biodegradables are removed and destroyed. The soil is ploughed, mixed with dry leaves and kerosene. The whole mass is ignited and allowed to burn. The next batch is then taken.<br>
ANALYTICAL METHODS<br>
Analytical Methods engaged for the analysis of COD, BOD, Ammonium Nitrogen, suspended solids, Color have been adopted from "Standard Methods of Water and Wastewater Analysis [APHA, Standard Methods for examination of Water and Wastewater", American Public Health association, 18th edition, Washington, 1992. Water Analysis Handbook, Hach USA, 3rd. Edition 1997, Merck manual for photometer SQ 118, 1997.<br>
Bioindicators are used at various stages of the processes to test for any toxic materials produced. Bioindicators such as fish, mosquito, rats, flies have been identified visually and reported as our visual observation. Bioindicators as a tool for assessment of pollution index of environment has been adopted from "Aquatic Chemistry" [by Stumm, Werner; Morgan, J. J.; "Aquatic Chemistry - an introduction emphasizing equilibria in natural waters, 2nd edition, Wiley Interscience, NY, 1981].<br>
Tests for microbiological indicators like Conform organisms, Staphylococci, Kleibsella pneumonie, Salmonella, Shigella, Entamoeba hystolytica, Polio virus, Hepatitis virus were carried out using methodology from Standard Methods of Water and Wastewater Analysis [APHA, Standard Methods for examination of Water and Wastewater", American Public Health association, 18th edition, Washington, 1992]. The performance of the different substrates were noted as detailed under TABLE 1.<br>
As would be evident from the results under TABLE 1, the material produced following the process of this invention find applications as a variety of soil conditioning agents of fertilizer grade, culture grade and soil grade. Further the products obtained are free of any harmful residues and have desirable shelf life. Equally important is the fact that the products are substantially free of-toxic substances, which make it environment friendly and safe for use<br><br>

The redox potential of 900mV indicates high oxygen availability and hence is a very healthy environment wherein the pathogen survival is unlikely.

animal excreta containing 1 percent or more protein nitrogen and 70 percent moisture. A limitation is that this organism effective at densities 50 - 100/m2 cannot live in its own excreta and they move horizontally and migrate away as the metabolite accumulates. In order to prevent this migration converted material is to be separated and fresh material is to be added to the process. This leads to low loading rates thereby requiring large space for the vermicomposting process. Culture replacement is also necessary. In view of the generated acidic environment abnormal bio indicators of acidic environment do appear and the use of other chemical pest control measures become necessary. When the acidity becomes very high it becomes essential to unearth the entire space and prepare the place afresh leading to long turnover times, loss of productivity, etc. Such redworm cultures not being native to healthy soils their disposal becomes problematic. Other issues related to the use of Eisenia foetida (all surface dwelling varieties) are sudden loss of culture and pest incidence.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
The above disclosed process of the invention provides for a simple and cost effective process of converting of solid waste to biofertilizer in high yield involving the selective use of the culture media comprising geophagus earthworm culture Pheretima elongata as a green space including bacterial culture, moisture and a mineral source.<br>
Yield of the process of the invention is typically 200 -1500 kg/ton raw waste depending on fertilizer grade, culture grade, soil grade SBT products but depends on nature of feed.<br>
Preferably, by adjusting additives and batch time can produce variety of product viz. fertilizer to culture grade to soil grade product. Typically products contain about 5-30% organics, about 55-90% minerals, about 10-20% moisture and rich in soil bacterial population and also containing geophagus earthworm culture. Cycle time of 14 weeks is typical. Smaller cycle time require more additives, mechanical shredding and intensive management.<br>
According to one embodiment of the process of the invention involves: a) providing an appropriate geophagus earthworm culture Pheretima elongata by developing the culture in a green space     providing i) about 20-30 g/m2.day organics such as animal dung, straw, leaf litter ii) moisture about 30-40 % iii) preferred mineral powder of about 5-10 g/m2.day;<br>
5<br><br>
b)	maintaining the mix above under conditions for developing the cultures and sieving as powder less than 500  for use as source bacterial culture;<br>
c)	processing the organic waste, preferred mineral powder of a specific particle size range, soil, bacterial culture source under controlled moisture in a geophagus earthworm cultured green space for a required period ; and<br>
d)	maintaining the mix for sufficient perjod to effect conversion to desired biofertilizer and sieving to the required size range.<br>
In the above process of the invention the step of developing the bacterial culture required in a geophagus earthworm cultured green space is carried out by providing about 20-30 gm/m2.d organics such as ruminant animal (such animals in the wild or fed essentially on cellulosic residues) dung which is a source of potent bacterial culture, straw and leaf litter, Moisture 30-40 %, and preferred mineral powder less than 1000 |u size @ about 5-10 gm/m2.d; The mineral source used can be mineral powder in amounts of upto 200% w/w selected from sources containing silica (25 -30% Si), alumina (about 6-8 % Al), Iron (about 1-6 % Fe), Potassium (about 2 - 8%), Calcium (about 2 -10%), Magnesium (about 1-3%), Phosphorous (about 0.003-0.01%) etc. and containing micro nutrients.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention mineral additives such as primary rock powder of about 0.3-0.6 kg. per kg waste, natural phosphate powder (about 0.02-0.05 kg./kg. waste) and soil (about 0.05-0.2 kg/kg. waste), bacterial culture (about 0.01 kg/kg waste) are added to enable organic conversion in a cultured green space to fertilizer grade, culture grade, soil grade product.<br>
Process control is achieved by adjusting loading rates, moisture levels and by addition of mineral powder so as to prevent anaerobic environment and as well to eliminate bioindicators of abnormality. Process monitoring is achieved by observing bioindicators of abnormality viz. mosquitoes, rats, odour and plant health.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment for large scale processing of organics the invention proposes the use of system of ridges and troughs of height/depth 1-3 M to carry out the conversion of organic waste for biofertilizer using the aforesaid geophagus earthworm cultural green space.  The ridges can have the green plants<br>
6<br><br>
that house the culture engaged in the process. For different capacities length of ridges and troughs can be adjusted. Higher loading as and when required can be achieved by adjusting ridge dimensions. The costs are low since energy inputs are low and thus would provide a cost-effective process for manufacture of biofertilizer.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, culture of the bacteria in the excreta of ruminants e.g. cow, bullock, buffalo, goat, sheep, etc. preferably fed on cellulose-based feed are selected. The bacterial culture is further propagated by mixing excreta with preferred mineral powder and developed further for about 4-6 weeks in geophagus earthworm cultured green space and harvested for use in different locations to give the appropriate bacterial culture.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the animal dung is mixed with preferred mineral powder and propagated further in a geophagus earthworm culture green space for about 7 -14days to give soil grade product.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention hospital organic waste can be disposed in geophagus earthworm cultured green space. The space is organized to receive the hospital organic waste for treatment using the invented process.<br>
Fertilizer grade product obtained following the process of the invention contains typically about 20-30% organics, about 50-65% minerals, and about 15 - 20% moisture. The culture grade product contains about 5-10% organic, about 70-80% minerals, about 10 - 15% moisture. The soil grade product contains about 10-15 % organic, about 65 - 75 % minerals and moisture about 10-15 %. All the products contain soil bacterial culture and geophagus earthworm culture.<br>
The invention is explained hereunder in greater detail in relation to non-limiting exemplary embodiments discussed hereunder:<br>
Example 1<br>
100 kg of cow dung is taken. It is mixed with 100 kg of mineral additive at ambient<br>
temperature of 25-28°C. Free Moisture content of the prepared mix is around 25 %.<br>
7<br><br>
The mix is incubated in an earthworm-cultured bed for 7 days and moisture is maintained by sprinkling water. During the seven-day process the mix is monitored for pH and pest incidence. At the end of 7 days it is sun dried and sieved to less than 500 microns.<br>
The final product obtained is of the following characteristics: (1) fragrant soil smell while free moisture is maintained out around 10-15 % (2) free flowing, (3) no pests and insects (4) contains about 10-15 % organics, about 65- 75 % minerals and 10-15 % moisture. The soil product used as medium to grow potted plant shows vigorous plant growth indicating that the soil product is capable of being used as correction to eroded soils to restore productivity.<br>
Example 2<br>
100 kg of fresh food waste is taken and mixed with 50 kg of mineral powder, 100 g<br>
of bacterial culture and is processed in a geophagus earthworm cultured green<br>
space.    Moisture is maintained at 20 percent and processing continued for 14<br>
weeks.<br>
The final product is of the following characterisations: (1) fragrant soil smell while free moisture is maintained at 15-20 % (2) free flowing, (3) no pests and insects, (4) contain about 5-10 % organic, about 70 - 85 % mineral and about 10-15 % moisture. The culture grade product used as input to grow potted plants shows vigorous plant growth indicating that the culture grade product is capable of being used as correction to eroded soils to restore productivity.<br>
Example 3<br>
An organic waste processing plant to handle 16 tons per day of market organic waste is described. An area of 10800 m2 is earmarked. The space is organized as 20 loading bays each of 30 M (8.0m base - 10.0m top) x 1.0m deep. The green spaces are constructed on ground as ridges of size 30 M (2.0m base - 4.0m top) x 1.0m high. The green space serves as the reservoir of culture required for the process. Suitable space for storage of additives and product are also provided.<br>
8<br><br>
The entire space is cultured with geophagus earthworms. Suitable green plants to house the earthworm culture are planted on the ridges.<br>
During loading, the waste is spread over the loading area. Mineral powder in the range 0.3-0.6 kg/ kg waste, soil in the range 0.1-0.2 kg./kg waste; bacterial culture 0.01 kg/kg waste natural phosphates if required 0.02-0.05 kg/kg waste are sprinkled. Moisture is maintained at 20-30% on the soil. The loaded area is periodically turned manually. This may also be turned mechanically by a tractor and lumps are mechanically shredded.<br>
A 14 weeks schedule for loading and as well 14 weeks schedule for curing / harvesting is engaged.<br>
During harvesting the material from the curing bays are dug out, screened and bagged.<br>
For the batches with any abnormal bioindicators more mineral powder is sprinkled and the material turned and allowed to process further for 2-3 days. The fertilizer grade product formed has moisture of 15-20 %, 20-30% organic, 50-65 % minerals and is free flowing.<br>
Example 4:<br>
Hospital organic wastes are taken directly to geophagous earthworm cultured green space. The wastes are spread carefully on the processing area protected suitably via impervious lining. Soil in amount of 0.3 - 0.6 kg per kg waste and mineral powder @ 0.3 - 0.6 kg per kg waste are sprinkled. Loading is continued till the pit is full typically in 4 weeks. The processing is continued for 48 weeks. During processing the moisture in the pits was maintained at 30 - 40 %.<br>
The processed material is turned periodically. Non-biodegradables are removed and destroyed. The soil is ploughed, mixed with dry leaves and kerosene. The whole mass is ignited and allowed to burn. The next batch is then taken.<br>
ANALYTICAL METHODS:<br>
Analytical Methods engaged for the analysis of COD, BOD, Ammonium Nitrogen, suspended solids, Color have been adopted from "Standard Methods of Water and Wastewater Analysis [APHA, Standard Methods for examination of Water and<br>
9<br><br>
Wastewater", American Public Health association, 18 edition, Washington, 1992. Water Analysis Handbook, Hach USA, 3rd. Edition 1997, Merck manual for photometer SQ 118,1997.<br>
Bioindicators are used at various stages of the processes to test for any toxic materials produced. Bioindicators such as fish, mosquito, rats, flies have been identified visually and reported as our visual observation. Bioindicators as a tool for assessment of pollution index of environment has been adopted from "Aquatic Chemistry" [by Stumm, Werner; Morgan, J. J.; "Aquatic Chemistry - an introduction emphasizing equilibria in natural waters, 2nd edition, Wiley Interscience, NY, 1981],<br>
Tests for microbiological indicators like Conform organisms, Staphylococci, Kleibsella pneumonie, Salmonella, Shigella, Entamoeba hystolytica, Polio virus, Hepatitis virus were carried out using methodology from Standard Methods of Water and Wastewater Analysis [APHA, Standard Methods for examination of Water and Wastewater", American Public Health association, 18th edition, Washington, 1992]. The performance of the different substrates were noted as detailed under TABLE 1.<br>

As would be evident from the results under TABLE 1, the material produced following the process of this invention find applications as a variety of soil conditioning agents of fertilizer grade, culture grade and soil grade. Further the products obtained are free of any harmful residues and have desirable shelf life. Equally important is the fact that the products are substantially free of toxic substances, which make it environment friendly and safe for use.<br>
The redox potential of 900mV indicates high oxygen availability and hence is a very healthy environment wherein the pathogen survival is unlikely. The nutrients in the waste get fixed in biomass and are internally recycled. The organic loading being small the nutrient levels in soil do not change much. Overall the results show that the procedure can handle hospital waste effectively.<br>
TABLE 2 summarises the results of treatment of hospital waste prepared as in example 4. The results show that the hospital waste treated soil has characteristics similar to those of the control soil. Pathogens are not be detected both in control soil and in treated samples.<br>
