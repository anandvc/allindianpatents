				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to functionally graded magnetic materials and a method for preparation of the same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Polymer bonded magnets, now a day omnipresent in modern societies supplanting other conventional magnets of their metallic and ceramic counterparts because of their numerous advantages over them. Main advantages include ease of processing, forming and machining which subsequently follows to feast on other advantages like high production rate, economy of production, etc. Another advantage of polymer bonded magnets is the ability to mold onto another object such as a shaft, hub or into a can.<br>
Magnetic properties can be imparted to the polymers by impregnating/doping magnetic particles into it. Calendering uses magnetic powders up to 65 volume percent. The remaining portion is a binder.<br>
Polymer bonded magnets have the unique characteristic that their properties can easily be acclimated according to the requirements for a given particular application. Radar absorption is an example where the particular values of dielectric constant and magnetic permeability are required as a criterion for the materials choice to wield.<br>
The compatibility of electronic devices with various electromagnetic environments has become a substantial issue now a days. Rubber radar absorbing material (RAM) is an expedient shielding material that attenuates electromagnetic interference (EMI), a concerned environmental pollution, as it is flexible and can easily be clipped. Rubber ferrite composites (RFCs), to a greater extent, are used as microwave absorbers and they can form complex shapes retaining their flexibility and hence superseding ceramic magnetic materials where shape is a monumental criteria. Carbonyl iron can also be used as filler for microwave absorption in the frequency range 2-25 GHz. High values of magnetic permeability and dielectric constant in microwave frequency range, high saturation magnetization and high curie temperature enables it to be widely used for electromagnetic shielding/absorption. Rubber-carbonyl iron composites are optimally suited for improving communication environments including wireless access. It is also specially preferred where thickness of the composite is the mooting issue.<br>
Not a single paper/note is available on functionally graded magnet based on polymer matrix.<br><br>

Various loadings of filler content are added to polymer(s) apart from the regular recipe as shown in Table 1.<br><br>
All these ingredients are homogeneously mixed in a two-roll mixer and then molded and vulcanized at 100-200°C in an electrically heated hydraulic press according to ASTM D-15 to make functionally graded magnet. The processing method adopted for the preparation of functionally graded magnet is different. Herein, the thin layers of uncured homogeneous mixes containing increasing or decreasing (varied) wt% of magnetic filler(s) are stacked on each other and the stacked layers are molded and vulcanized in the press. With an application of pressure, the thin layers infuse into adjacent layers so as to form a smoothly graded composite.<br>

Measurements:<br>
Magnetic Measurement: Magnetic properties of functionally graded magnet with different loadings of magnetic powder are studied using DMS Model 4 Vibrating sample magnetometer. The saturation magnetization (Ms), coercive field, remanent magnetization are measured at room temperature for these magnets.<br>
Hardness Measurement: The hardness of the functionally graded magnet is measured with a Shore A durometer according to ASTM D-2240 and specific gravity of the functionally graded magnet for respective loading is calculated from the density values of the compounds.<br>
Tensile Measurement: Tensile strength, modulus and elongation at break are the important properties to study the employability of the material for a given particular application. Mechanical Properties of the functionally graded magnet are determined using Zwick/Roell Z010 model. Dumbbell shaped samples containing varied loadings of the magnetic filler are cut from the sheets using-type-A die. Tensile strength, modulus @ 100 %, modulus @ 200 % and elongation @ break are determined for the samples containing different loadings of the filler content in accordance with ASTM D-412.<br><br>
Magnetic measurements are carried out on functionally graded magnets for various loadings of magnetic fillers. Magnetic parameters like saturation magnetization (Ms), coercivity (Hc), remanent magnetization (Mr) are determined. From the hysteresis-loop curves for various iron and nickel contents in the functionally graded magnet, it can be observed that saturation magnetization increases with increasing iron content in the functionally graded magnet. Fig. 2(a) shows the hysteresis curves for iron loadings varying from 10 to 500 % in the functionally graded magnet. It is clear that the rate of the increment in the saturation magnetization is rapid for the initial loadings and is moderate up to 400 % iron loading. From Fig. 2(b), it can be seen that with further loadings of iron from 400 % onwards, the rate of increment of saturation magnetization becomes lenient. The agglomeration of the magnetic fillers might be the cause of this lenient incremental rate. With superfluous addition of the filler, probability of agglomerate formation increases that results in cancellation of magnetic lines of forces within the system and hence resultant saturation magnetization hardly differs. The saturation magnetization values corresponding to 10, 50, 100, 200, 400 and 1000 wt% iron are 16, 59, 85, 1 14, 146 and 177 emu/gm respectively. All other parameters are noted and plotted against the loading of the filler. Fig. 3(a) shows the variation of saturation magnetization as a function of iron loading. Saturation magnetization increases with increasing iron content in the functionally graded magnet. It shows that the increment in the magnetization with loadings of iron is not linear. There is a rapid increment in the saturation magnetization with initial loadings of the filler and the degree of steepness slowly decreases. After 400 % iron, the saturation magnetization increases mildly. Attempts have been made to calculate the saturation magnetization of the functionally graded magnet for any given amount of the filler from the Ms value and weight fraction of the filler only. Rule of mixture is introduced to calculate the magnetization values for different loadings of the filler.<br>
MFGM=WFMF +WPMp         ....(1)<br>
where WF, Wp and MF, MR are the weight fractions and saturation magnetizations of the filler and polymer matrix respectively while MFGM is the magnetization of the functionally graded magnet. As the matrix is non-magnetic, the equation reduces to,<br>
WFMF	...(2)<br>
The calculated Ms values of functionally graded magnet i.e. MFGM are plotted along with the measured Ms values as shown in the Fig. 3(a, b). The calculated MS values of the functionally graded magnet from the rule of mixture are much closer to the experimental Ms values for the initial loadings of the filler (Fe and Ni both) till the curve follows linearity. With the deviation of the curve from linearity, the difference between the calculated and experimental Ms values magnifies. For superfluous loadings of the filler, rule of mixture is not applicable to predict the Ms value of the functionally graded magnet. From the experimental data of Ms for different loadings of the filler, it is<br><br>
observed that the Boltzmann fit gave the least error (R2 ~ 0.99) and the is represented by the general formula,<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
dWP<br>
where (MFGM)is the saturation magnetization of the functionally graded magnet corresponding to any given weight fraction of the filler, WF is the weight of the filler in phr and remaining AI, A2, WFO and dWF are constants. The values of the constants in the fit are shown in Fig. 3 (a).<br>
This equation is checked using Ni as different filler (with same particle size) in functionally graded magnet. It is observed that the experimental plot of Ms with various loadings of Ni in the functionally graded magnet follows the Boltzmann fit only. The corresponding constants for Ni loading are also shown in Fig. 3(b).<br>
The closer agreement between the measured and the experimental values of the saturation magnetization assists in tailoring the different appropriate materials (with known saturation magnetization values) and loading required in a given polymer to fulfill the material properties needed for a given application.<br>
Remanent magnetization is the permanent magnetization that remains after the external field is removed. Fig. 4 shows the increasing trend of remanent magnetization with increasing magnetic filler in the polymer matrix. With increasing loading of the filler, saturation magnetization increases, which increases the remanent magnetization. Once the saturation magnetization saturates (~ 400 % as shown in Fig. 2), a corresponding saturation of remanent magnetization is observed Fig. 2(b). Fig. 4(b) follows the same trend for nickel.<br>
Coercivity is defined as the intensity of the magnetic field required to reduce the magnetization of that material to zero after the magnetization of the sample has reached saturation. Fig. 5(a) shows the variation of coercivity with loading of the iron. With increasing loading, coercive field is increasing. Fig. 5(b) shows that coercivity is hardly depending on the loading of nickel in the polymer matrix. There is hardly any difference between the coercivity values of the pure magnetic fillers (either iron or nickel) and the functionally graded magnet.<br>
Mechanical properties for functionally graded magnets are prerequisite as many applications demand for certain extents of mechanical loading. Tensile test is carried out to measure the ability of the material to sustain tensile forces and elongation before it breaks. Tensile strength, modulus and elongation at break are the important properties to study the serviceability of the material. The information regarding matrix-filler<br><br>
interaction, dispersion of the filler and percolation threshold can possibly be understood from the mechanical and magnetic measurements.<br>
Mechanical properties of functionally graded magnet strongly depend on interfacial interaction between the filler and the matrix. It is also influenced by the filler size, shape, dispersion and its amount in the matrix. The change in tensile strength and % elongation at break with the. variation of the iron loading in functionally graded magnet is shown in Fig. 6(a). Tensile strength is increasing with initial loadings of the filler and decreases again with further loadings. Tensile strength of gum compound itself is much lesser as it lacks of self-reinforcing (due to stress induced crystallization) qualities of SBR polymer. Tensile strength increases from 1.45 MPa to 1.85 MPa for the loading variation from 0 to 400 % and falls down to 1.15 MPa at 1000 % loading. Elongation at break for the gum compound is 250 % only and increases continuously with increasing loading. It reaches maximum to 450 % at 700 % loading and remains roughly constant with superfluous loading also. With addition of Ni particles, tensile strength decreases in the same fashion from 1.45 to 0.92 MPa while % elongation plateaus to 250 % throughout the loading.<br>
Figs. 7(a) and 7(b) shows the variation in the Mod @ 100 % and Mod @ 200 % elongation with iron and nickel filler respectively. Both mod. @ 100 % and mod @ 200 % increase with initial loading and decreases again with further loading. It follows the same trend as the tensile strength. The corresponding drop in tensile strength as well as in the modulus of the composite directs the attention on the agglomeration formed due to the superfluous amount of filler in the functionally graded magnet. Mod @ 100 % increases from 0.86 to 1 MPa while mod @ 200 % increases from 1.11 to 1.17 MPa with filler variation from 0 to 300 % and decreases correspondingly from 1 to 0.74 MPa and from 1.17 to 0.81 MPa when filler content varies from 300 to 1000 % respectively. Mechanical characterizations reveal that the magnetic properties can be imparted without compromising on the flexibility even at much higher loadings.<br>
The hardness pattern of functionally graded magnet is studied for various loadings of iron. With increasing loadings of iron in functionally graded magnet, hardness increases as shown in Fig. 8(a). There are three distinct regions wherein one can see the difference in the rate of change of hardness. The rate of increment in hardness is steeper for the initial loadings up to 100-150 %, moderate up to 400 % and increases abruptly at 500 % and becomes moderate again with surplus addition of the filler to the matrix. Hardness value varies from 40 shore A for 0% to 94 shore A for 1200 % loadings of iron. For the initial loadings of the filler up to 100%, hardness value jumps from 40 to 52 shore A. With additional loading of the hard filler, hardness increases at moderate rate up to 400 % iron. This is the maximum limit of filler addition having uniform dispersion with smaller agglomerates formed. Ni particles are also dispersed in the SBR polymer matrix in<br><br>
different amounts and hardness of different composite specimens is measured. The corresponding plot of hardness against the loading of Ni particles shows the similar kind of trend (Fig. 8(b)). Hardness varies from 40 shore A for the 0% compound to 91 shore A for 1000 % Ni. Specific gravity of the functionally graded magnet is also calculated for different weight fractions of the iron and is plotted against the loading as shown in Fig. 8(a). Increment in the specific gravity is gradual and varies from 0.98 for the 0% to 4.92 for 1200 % iron as it only depends on the weight fractions of the dense filler and light matrix. Specific gravity increases from 0.98 for the 0% to 4.91 for 1000 % Ni.<br>

After uniform mixing of all these chemical ingredients in to the matrix, a thin sheet of thickness in the range of 0.1 to 10 mm (based on our requirement) is prepared at a temperature of 50 to 125°C and at friction ratio of 1:1.1 to 1:1.5 in a same two roll mixing mill. The both sides of this thin sheet/s are optionally coated with coating agents. The coated/uncoated thin sheet is kept in hydraulic press in between two teflon sheet and pressed again to make a very thin sheet of thickness less than 0.1 mm. The coated/uncoated thin sheets are laminated to the desired thickness to make a green functionally graded magnets either increasing or decreasing order of nano/micron particles and/or using template. The split steel die is preheated before putting these green functionally graded magnets in it. The preheating is done in a hydraulic press at a temperature of 100 to 200°C. After temperature is reached close to the desired temperature, the green functionally graded magnets are filled in the die and the other half is placed over it. The temperature of 100 to 200°C and pressure of 1 to 15 MPa and time of 10 minutes to 8 hours are selected in such a way so as to get cured functionally graded magnets. The cured functionally graded magnets are taken out from the mould. Measurements of magnetic and mechanical properties are carried out to know its performance for high tech application.<br>

The green functionally graded magnets are prepared as per method described in example 1. The green functionally graded magnets are filled in the die and the other part of the die is placed over it at a temperature of 100 to 200°C. The pressure is 1 to 15 MPa. The temperature and pressure are maintained for 10 minutes to 8 hours. The cured functionally graded magnets are taken out from the mould.
