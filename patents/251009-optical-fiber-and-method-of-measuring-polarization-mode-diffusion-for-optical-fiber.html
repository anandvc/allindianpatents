				<td>The magnitude of local birefringence of the optical fiber can be quantified by<br>
using a beat length (hereinafter, abbreviated as "LB")- LB indicates a propagation<br>
distance over which optional polarization entering into the optical fiber returns to the<br>
incident polarization.<br>
Another parameter expressing the local birefringence of the optical fiber is a<br>
mode birefringence rate B. The relationship expressed by the following Equation (1) is<br>
established between the mode birefringence rate B and LB.<br><br>
In the above Equation (1), X indicates the wavelength of light.<br>
When the length of the optical fiber is short, it can be considered that there is no<br>
polarization mode coupling; therefore, the PMD is expressed by the following Equation<br>
(2) as a function between light velocity C and the length L of the optical fiber.<br><br>
From the above Equation (2), it is understood that the PMD increases in<br>
proportion to the length L of the optical fiber.<br>
On the other hand, when the length of the optical fiber is long, the PMD is<br>
expressed by the following Equation (3).<br><br><br>
From the above Equation (3), it is understood that the PMD increases in<br>
proportion to the square root of the length L of the optical fiber.<br>
In the above Equation (3), Lc is referred to as an average coupling length, which<br>
is a parameter expressing the magnitude of the polarization mode coupling, and as the<br>
polarization mode coupling increases, the magnitude of the average coupling length<br>
decreases. The magnitude of the polarization mode coupling is mainly determined by the<br>
distortion of the optical fiber, a force applied from the outside, and the like.<br>
When the length L of the optical fiber is shorter than Lc, the PMD can be<br>
expressed by using Equation (2). On the other hand, when the length L of the optical<br>
fiber is longer than Lc, the PMD can be expressed by using Equation (3).<br>
It is understood from Equations (2) and (3) that the PMD increases as LB becomes<br>
shorter, and Lc becomes longer.<br>
Generally, the optical fiber is transferred to an optical cabling process in a state<br>
wound around a bobbin, or is shipped and transported just as an optical fiber unit.<br>
Therefore, it is preferable that the PMD can be measured in the state with the optical<br>
fiber wound around the bobbin.<br>
However, by winding the optical fiber around the bobbin, disturbance such as<br>
bending, lateral pressure, distortion and the like occurs in the optical fiber, thereby<br>
changing LB and Lc, and hence the PMD varies. Therefore, in the same optical fiber, the<br>
PMD of the optical fiber wound around the bobbin for transport, and the PMD of the<br>
optical fiber after optical cabling, show quite different values (for example, see Non-<br>
patent Document 1). As a result, the PMD of the optical fiber after optical cabling<br>
increases, and in some cases, exceeds an upper limit of the PMD specified by the<br>
standard, thereby causing a problem.<br><br>
Moreover, the optical fiber is shipped to the optical cabling process in a length of<br>
about 20 to 100 km, and at the time of optical cabling, the length of the optical fiber is<br>
cut to 1 to 10 km. Therefore, if there is a place having locally large PMD, even if the<br>
PMD of the whole length of the optical fiber before optical cabling is small, when the<br>
optical fiber is cut and formed as a cable, there may be a place where there is large PMD,<br>
which has been considered to be a problem.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>

fiber, which can estimate the PMD of the optical fiber after optical cabling, in a state<br>
with the optical fiber wound around the bobbin for transport, to provide an optical fiber,<br>
and to provide an optical fiber cable.<br>
In order to achieve the above object, the present invention provides a method of<br>
measuring polarization mode dispersion of an optical fiber, including estimating<br>
polarization mode dispersion when an optical fiber is formed as an optical cable, from a<br>
beat length when the optical fiber is wound around a bobbin, and an average coupling<br>
length when the optical fiber is formed as the optical cable.<br>
In the abovementioned method of measuring polarization mode dispersion of an<br>
optical fiber, preferably the Rayleigh scattered light intensity of the optical fiber is<br>
measured by using a P-OTDR.<br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an optical fiber and a method of measuring<br>
polarization mode dispersion of an optical fiber.<br>
Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2003-361812, filed<br>
October 22, 2003, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Recently, with progress in speeding up of transmission speed, and lengthening of<br>
transmission distance in optical communication, reduction of polarization mode<br>
dispersion (hereinafter, abbreviated as "PMD") is required for the optical fiber, being the<br>
transmission path.<br>
The PMD of the optical fiber is mode dispersion caused by an occurrence of a<br>
group velocity difference in two orthogonal intrinsic polarization components, which<br>
propagate in the optical fiber, due to non-circularity of the core shape of the optical fiber,<br>
asymmetry of stress occurring in the core, etc.<br>
There are two parameters for determining the PMD. One parameter is the<br>
magnitude of local birefringence of the optical fiber, and the other is polarization mode<br>
coupling expressing how the direction of a birefringent axis of the optical fiber changes<br>
in the longitudinal direction of the optical fiber.<br><br>
In the abovementioned method of measuring polarization mode dispersion of an<br>
optical fiber, preferably the resolution of the P-OTDR is made shorter than the shortest<br>
beat length estimated for the optical fiber wound around the bobbin.<br>
In the abovementioned method of measuring polarization mode dispersion of an<br>
optical fiber, preferably the optical fiber is wound around the bobbin by setting the radius<br>
R of the bobbin and a tension at the time of winding the optical fiber around the bobbin,<br>
so that the magnitude of birefringence of the optical fiber induced due to winding of the<br>
optical fiber around the bobbin becomes smaller than the magnitude of internal<br>
birefringence inherently held by the optical fiber.<br>
In the abovementioned method of measuring polarization mode dispersion of an<br>
optical fiber, preferably the optical fiber is wound around the bobbin by setting the radius<br>
R of the bobbin and a tension at the time of winding the optical fiber around the bobbin,<br>
so that the magnitude of birefringence of the optical fiber induced due to winding of the<br>
optical fiber around the bobbin becomes smaller than the magnitude of internal<br>
birefringence allowed in the standard for the optical fiber.<br>
In the abovementioned method of measuring polarization mode dispersion of an<br>
optical fiber, preferably the optical fiber is wound around the bobbin by setting the radius<br>
R of the bobbin, so that the radius R of the bobbin and the magnitude B of internal<br>
birefringence allowed in the standard for the optical fiber satisfy the following Equation<br>
(4).<br><br>
(where "n" denotes a refractive index of a glass material (normally, silica glass)<br>
constituting the optical fiber, p11 and p12 denote Pockels coefficients of the glass material<br><br>
constituting the optical fiber, v denotes a Poisson's ratio of the glass material constituting<br>
the optical fiber, and "r" denotes a radius of a glass portion of the optical fiber.)<br>
In the abovementioned method of measuring polarization mode dispersion of an<br>
optical fiber, at the time of measurement, preferably the measurement of the beat length<br>
is performed in a state where the tension applied to the optical fiber is temporarily<br>
reduced, because the influence of birefringence due to the lateral pressure resulting from<br>
the winding tension, and the influence of the PMD can be removed at the time of<br>
measurement. Moreover, after measurement, by returning the tension to the original<br>
tension before the measurement, a problem such as that the feed of the optical fiber<br>
becomes difficult, can be prevented in the subsequent manufacturing process, which is<br>
preferable.<br>
In the abovementioned method of measuring polarization mode dispersion of an<br>
optical fiber, preferably the bobbin has a structure capable of temporarily reducing the<br>
winding tension on the optical fiber.<br>
In the abovementioned method of measuring polarization mode dispersion of an<br>
optical fiber, it is desirable to measure the PMD in the longitudinal direction of the<br>
optical fiber.<br>
The present invention further provides an optical fiber including a core and a<br>
cladding arranged around the core, wherein the PMD measured by using the above<br>
method is equal to or less than 0.1 ps/√km.<br>
In the abovementioned optical fiber, preferably a beat length in a state wound<br>
around the bobbin is equal to or longer than 15 m, and more preferably, is equal to or<br>
longer than 30 m.<br>
In the abovementioned optical fiber, preferably a beat length in a state in which a<br>
tension due to the bobbin is reduced after wound around the bobbin, is equal to or longer<br>
than 15 m, and more preferably, is equal to or longer than 30 m.<br><br>
The present invention further provides an optical fiber cable in which a plurality<br>
of coated optical fibers having a protective layer around the optical fiber are arranged<br>
side by side, and the plurality of coated optical fibers are housed in a sheath.<br>

measurement in a free state, the optical fiber can be used effectively.<br>
According to the method of measuring polarization mode dispersion of an optical<br>
fiber of the present invention, since the polarization mode dispersion of the shipped<br>

polarization mode dispersion of the optical fiber in the vicinity thereof, an optical fiber<br>
having higher quality can be provided.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The method of measuring polarization mode dispersion of an optical fiber<br>
according to the present invention will be described hereunder in detail.<br>
At first, an individual study is carried out as to how the beat length LB and the<br>
average coupling length Lc change, by winding the optical fiber around a bobbin.<br>
LB changes when birefringence is induced from outside, substantially in the radial<br>
direction of the bobbin, due to the influence of the bending radius, tension, or lateral<br>
pressure at the time of winding the optical fiber around the bobbin.<br>
Lc changes due to torsion of the optical fiber, or contact of optical fibers with<br>
each other, at the time of winding the optical fiber around the bobbin.<br>
Here, the change of LB after the optical fiber is wound around the bobbin is<br>
studied from the relationship between the internal birefringence of the optical fiber, and<br>
the birefringence of the optical fiber induced from outside.<br>
The direction of birefringence induced from outside by winding the optical fiber<br>
around the bobbin, is substantially in the radial direction of the bobbin, while the angle of<br>
the birefringent axis inside the optical fiber can take any angle.<br>
Therefore, the average birefringence of the optical fiber when a lateral pressure is<br>
applied, can be considered to be an average when the lateral pressure is applied from<br>
various angles.<br>
FIG. 1 is a graph showing the results of calculating the magnitude of the average<br>
birefringence, at the time of applying a force from outside to two optical fibers having<br>
different internal birefringence, to induce birefringence of a different magnitude.<br>
From the results shown in FIG. 1, it is understood that when the magnitude of<br>
birefringence induced from outside is smaller than the magnitude of internal<br><br><br>
birefringence, the magnitude of the average birefringence hardly changes. On the other<br>
hand, when the magnitude of birefringence induced from outside is larger than that of the<br>
internal birefringence, the magnitude of the average birefringence becomes substantially<br>
equal to that of the magnitude of the birefringence induced from outside, and finally, the<br>
magnitude of the average birefringence becomes larger than that of the magnitude of the<br>
birefringence induced from outside. However, the magnitude of the average<br>
birefringence after birefringence is induced from outside due to lateral pressure does not<br>
become smaller than that of the internal birefringence. Therefore, by winding the optical<br>
fiber around the bobbin, the average LB becomes shorter inevitably, which causes an<br>
increase in the PMD.<br>
On the other hand, Lc after the optical fiber is wound around the bobbin becomes<br>
very short, due to torsion in the optical fiber or due to contact of the optical fibers with<br>
each other, when the optical fiber is wound around the bobbin. Therefore, a change in Lc<br>
due to winding of the optical fiber around the bobbin causes a decrease in the PMD.<br>
Accordingly, when the influence of the change in Lc is larger than the influence<br>
of the change in LB, the PMD decreases when the optical fiber is wound around the<br>
bobbin, and when the optical fiber is formed as an optical fiber cable and put in a free<br>
state, the PMD increases, thereby causing a problem.<br>
A calculation example of the PMD is shown below.<br>
For example, when the length of the optical fiber is 1000 m, and this optical fiber<br>
is divided into fine sections of 0.1 mm, it is assumed that in the fine sections, the optical<br>
fiber has only linear birefringence. A change in the PMD of the optical fiber is<br>
calculated by simulation, using the Jones matrix method (refer to IEEE Photonics<br>
Technology Letters, Sept. 1992, vol. 4, No. 9, pp. 1066 to 1069).<br><br>
In a free state, when optical fibers having LB of 10 m and 20 m and Lc of 30 m<br>
are wound around the bobbin, Lc decreases, and birefringence is induced in the radial<br>
direction of the bobbin, and from this, how the PMD of the optical fiber changes is<br>
calculated.<br>
Both optical fibers are set so that when the optical fibers are wound around the<br>
bobbin, Lc becomes 3 m. The average coupling length used for the calculation is a<br>
typical value for when the optical fiber is put in a free state, and for when the optical<br>
fiber is wound around the bobbin. The calculation results of the PMD of the optical fiber<br>
are shown in FIG. 2.<br>
From the results shown in FIG. 2, it is understood that when the optical fiber is<br>
wound around the bobbin, and when the magnitude of birefringence induced from<br>
outside is small, the PMD of the optical fiber wound around the bobbin becomes smaller<br>
than that of the optical fiber in the free state.<br>
It is also understood that when LB of the optical fibers in the free state is different,<br>
the magnitude of the change in the PMD with respect to the magnitude of birefringence<br>
induced from outside becomes different. Therefore, when the optical fiber is put in the<br>
free state, though the PMD is different, the PMD of both optical fibers may take the same<br>
value, according to the magnitude of birefringence induced from outside. If<br>
birefringence larger than that is induced, the magnitude correlation of the PMD of the<br>
two optical fibers is reversed to that of optical fibers in the free state. That is, the PMD<br>
of the optical fiber in the free state cannot be estimated only by measuring the PMD of<br>
the optical fiber wound around the bobbin.<br>
Here, what the inventors want to know is the magnitude of the PMD of the optical<br>
fiber after optical cabling. Since the optical fiber cable has such a structure that an<br>
external force applied to the optical fiber is made as small as possible, the PMD of the<br><br>
optical fiber after optical cabling is substantially the same as that of the optical fiber in<br>
the free state.<br>
Therefore, the PMD of the optical fiber after optical cabling cannot be estimated<br>
only by measuring the PMD of the optical fiber wound around the bobbin.<br>
However, it has been found that if LB of the optical fiber wound around the<br>
bobbin is obtained, LB of the optical fiber after optical cabling does not become shorter<br>
than that. Therefore, by obtaining Lc of the optical fiber after optical cabling, the PMD<br>
of the optical fiber after optical cabling can be estimated by using the following Equation<br>
(2).<br><br>
Lc of the optical fiber cable is determined mainly by external factors such as the<br>
structure of the optical fiber cable, and the material and the surface properties of the resin<br>
used for the optical fiber and the optical fiber cable. Therefore, by measuring Lc<br>
beforehand by using the same type of optical fiber as in other optical fiber cables formed<br>
from a resin of the same material, having the same structure, and the same surface<br>
properties, Lc of the optical fiber after optical cabling can be obtained, without using the<br>
optical fiber for measurement of Lc separately.<br>
Next a specific example of the measurement method of Lc of the optical fiber<br>
after optical cabling will be described below.<br>
At first, the PMD of the optical fiber for the whole length of the optical fiber<br>
cable is measured, and then, a section of the optical fiber of about 5 m is taken out and<br>
the PMD is measured.<br><br>
In a short optical fiber cable of about 5 m, it can be considered that there is no<br>
polarization mode coupling, and hence LB can be obtained by using Equation (2).<br>
Lc can be determined by using the following Equation (3), from LB obtained here,<br>
and the PMD of the optical fiber for the whole length of the optical fiber cable.<br><br>
Accordingly, from the above Equations (2) and (3), the PMD after optical cabling<br>
can be estimated from LB of the optical fiber wound around the bobbin, and the<br>
previously calculated Lc.<br>
Next, a method of estimating the PMD by using a P-OTDR (Polarization Optical<br>
Time Domain Reflectometry) after an optical fiber cable is formed by using an optical<br>
fiber to be measured, will be explained.<br>
In this method, by using the P-OTDR, LB and Lc can be independently measured<br>
with the optical fiber to be measured wound around the bobbin. Specifically, methods<br>
described in Reference document A (F. Corsi, A Galtarossa, and L. Palmieri,<br>
"Polarization Mode Dispersion Characterization of Single-Mode Optical Fiber Using<br>
Backscattering Technique", Journal of Lightwave Technology, Vol. 16, No. 10, Oct.<br>
1998, pp. 1832 to 1843), and Reference document B (M. Wuilpart, G. Ravet, P. Megret,<br>
and M. Blondel, "PMD measurement with a polarization-OTDR", ECOC 2002) can be<br>
used.<br>
FIG. 3 is a graph showing an example of a waveform of Rayleigh scattered light<br>
intensity actually measured by using the P-OTDR.<br>
According to the Reference documents A and B, as one calculation method of LB,<br>
when there are N extreme values of the waveform in a section length L, from which the<br><br>
waveform of the Rayleigh scattered light intensity measured by using the P-OTDR is<br>
obtained, there is a method of calculating LB by using the following Equation (5).<br><br>
In the case of an optical fiber having a waveform as shown in FIG. 3, since there<br>
are 19 extreme values in a 100 m section, it is understood that LB is 21 m. Thus, by<br>
measuring LB of the optical fiber wound around the bobbin by using the P-OTDR, and<br>
separately measuring Lc of the optical fiber cable in the free state, the PMD of the optical<br>
fiber formed as an optical fiber cable can be estimated.<br>
Here, as the method for calculating LB, the above Equation (5) is used. However,<br>
the calculation method of LB is not limited thereto, and other methods may be used.<br>
In the Reference documents A and B, LB and Lc of the optical fiber to be<br>
measured in the free state are measured by using the P-OTDR. On the other hand, in the<br>
present invention, the calculation method is different from the conventional method in<br>
that LB is measured by winding the optical fiber around the bobbin, to estimate the PMD<br>
of the optical fiber after optical cabling.<br>
Next the relationship between LB of the optical fiber to be measured, and the<br>
resolution of the OTDR used for the measurement of the PMD will be described.<br>
In a single-mode fiber excluding a polarization maintaining fiber, since LB is<br>
normally 10 cm or longer, if the resolution of the OTDR is shorter than 10 cm, LB and Lc<br>
can be measured independently in any single-mode fiber.<br>
In such an application, resolution equal to or shorter than 1 cm can be obtained,<br>
for example, by using a technique referred to as photon counting OTDR. Therefore, it<br>
can be applied to any single-mode fiber other than the polarization maintaining fiber.<br><br>
The measurement method of the PMD using the P-OTDR can also be applied to a<br>
multi-mode fiber, by using a device which selectively excites and receives only a mode<br>
to be measured.<br>
Next an optical fiber in which the PMD after the optical fiber is formed as an<br>
optical fiber cable, can be estimated in a state with the optical fiber wound around the<br>
bobbin, will be described.<br>
When the magnitude of birefringence of the optical fiber induced due to winding<br>
of the optical fiber around the bobbin is smaller than that of internal birefringence, then<br>
as described above, the magnitude of the birefringence of the optical fiber wound around<br>
the bobbin is substantially the same as the magnitude of the birefringence of the optical<br>
fiber after optical cabling.<br>
Therefore, LB of the optical fiber measured in the state wound around the bobbin<br>
is substantially equal to LB of the optical fiber after optical cabling. Accordingly, an<br>
optical fiber can be provided, in which the PMD of the optical fiber after optical cabling<br>
can be estimated by measuring Lc of the optical fiber cable beforehand using the same<br>
type of optical fiber.<br>
Lc after cabling is mainly determined by the internal birefringence of the optical<br>
fiber, and the external force induced due to the structure of the optical fiber cable. In<br>
many cases, there is no problem in considering that Lc is constant regardless of LB.<br>
However, when LB is short, that is, when the internal birefringence of the optical fiber is<br>
large, then even if an external force is applied to the optical fiber, polarization mode<br>
coupling is hardly induced. Hence there is a case in which Lc cannot be regarded as<br>
constant. Even in this case, by obtaining Lc as a function of LB, the present method can<br>
be applied.<br><br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. H11-208998<br>
discloses a method of winding an optical fiber so that the PMD of the optical fiber wound<br>
around the bobbin matches with the PMD of the optical fiber in the free state. As<br>
described above, however, the way of change of the PMD of the optical fiber wound<br>
around the bobbin changes due to the internal birefringence of the optical fiber in the free<br>
state. Therefore, in this method, the winding method cannot be determined unless the<br>
internal birefringence of the optical fiber in the free state is known beforehand.<br>
Therefore, when LB is different for each optical fiber, that is, in the actual<br>
manufacturing process, the effect thereof is smaller than that obtained by the present<br>
invention.<br>
Next an optical fiber in which it can be determined whether the PMD standard of<br>
the optical fiber is satisfied after optical cabling, in a state wound around the bobbin, will<br>
be described.<br>
If it is found that the magnitude of the birefringence induced by winding the<br>
optical fiber around the bobbin is smaller than the internal birefringence allowed in the<br>
standard for the optical fiber, it is understood that the birefringence after optical cabling<br>
is smaller than the internal birefringence allowed in the standard for the optical fiber.<br>
Therefore, by measuring the magnitude of the induced birefringence, and the<br>
magnitude of the internal birefringence allowed in the standard for the optical fiber, in a<br>
state with the optical fiber wound around the bobbin, it can be determined whether the<br>
optical fiber satisfies the PMD standard after optical cabling.<br>
The maximum value of the internal birefringence allowed in the standard for the<br>
optical fiber can be calculated from a predetermined upper limit of the PMD, and the<br>
average coupling length of the optical fiber cable, by using the above Equations (1) and<br>
(3).<br><br>
Next the radius of a bobbin, which can determine whether the optical fiber<br>
satisfies the PMD standard of the optical fiber in an optical fiber cable after optical<br>
cabling, in a state with the optical fiber wound around the bobbin will be described here.<br>
According to Reference document C (R. Ulrich, S. C. Rashleigh, and W. Eickhoff,<br>
"Bending-induced birefringence in single-mode fibers", Optics Letters, Vol. 5, No. 6,<br>
June 1980, pp. 273 to 275), birefringence B induced by bending at the time of winding<br>
the optical fiber around the bobbin is expressed by the following Equation (6), from a<br>
refractive index "n" of the optical fiber, Pockels coefficients p11 and p12, Poisson's ratio v,<br>
a radius "r" of the optical fiber, and a radius R of the bobbin.<br><br>
From the above Equation (6), if the magnitude B of the birefringence induced by<br>
bending of the optical fiber is smaller than the magnitude of the internal birefringence<br>
allowed in the standard for the optical fiber, it can be determined whether the optical<br>
fiber satisfies the PMD standard after optical cabling, in the measurement with the<br>
optical fiber wound around the bobbin.<br>
Accordingly, it is preferable that the radius R of the bobbin satisfies the<br>
relationship in the following Equation (4).<br><br>
Here, B' denotes the maximum value of the magnitude of the internal<br>
birefringence allowed in the standard for the optical fiber, and can be calculated from the<br><br>
predetermined upper limit of the PMD, and the average coupling length of the optical<br>
fiber cable, by using the above Equations (1) and (3).<br>
Here, if the bobbin has a structure capable of temporarily reducing the tension<br>
applied to the optical fiber, then this is preferable because the influence of the<br>
birefringence generated inside of the optical fiber due to the tension can be removed.<br>
Here it is preferable to estimate the distribution of PMD in the longitudinal<br>
direction of the optical fiber.<br>
Prior to the present invention, there was no measurement method for performing<br>
measurement of the beat length, without cutting the optical fiber. Accordingly, a fiber in<br>
which the PMD after optical cabling can be known before the optical cabling process,<br>
can be provided only by using the method of the present invention.<br>
Moreover, in the present invention, since the beat length can be measured in the<br>
longitudinal direction of the optical fiber, then even if there is a place where the beat<br>
length is short partially, the place can be determined. Then, by using the method of the<br>
present invention, and first determining the place where the beat length of the optical<br>
fiber is short partially, the cause of shortage can be specified and the manufacturing<br>
process can be improved. As a result, even after the optical fiber is divided in the optical<br>
cabling process, an optical fiber which can obtain a favorable PMD in the whole optical<br>
fiber cable can be provided.<br>
In 40 Gb/s transmission, preferably the PMD of the optical fiber is equal to or less<br>
than 0.1 ps/√km. Moreover, since the transmission path is formed of a plurality of<br>
optical fibers, it is required at least as the whole transmission path, that the PMD be equal<br>
to or less than 0.1 ps/√km. The present inventor has executed investigations by using<br>
combinations of optical fibers and optical fiber cables having various structures, to find<br>
that when optical fibers having a beat length of 15 m or longer after optical cabling are<br><br>
connected to form one transmission path, the PMD can be set to 0.1 ps/√km or less as the<br>
whole transmission path. For optical fibers having a beat length of 30 m or longer after<br>
optical cabling, it has been found that the PMD is 0.1 ps/√km or less in all individual<br>
optical fibers. Accordingly, it is preferred that the beat length measured by using the<br>
method of the present invention is equal to or longer than 15 m, and more preferably,<br>
equal to or longer than 30 m.<br>
Hereunder the present invention will be described more specifically by way of<br>
examples, but the present invention is by no means limited to the examples below.<br>
Example 1<br>
An optical fiber to be measured before cabling, was wound in a length of 3000 m<br>
around a bobbin having a diameter of 300 mm at a tension of 20 gf. When the magnitude<br>
of the internal birefringence of the optical fiber to be measured was measured, LB was 30<br>
m.<br>
On the other hand, when an optical fiber cable having a length of 3000 m was<br>
formed by using the same type of optical fiber, separately from the optical fiber to be<br>
measured, the PMD of the optical fiber constituting the optical fiber cable was 0.05<br>
ps/√km, and LB was 30 m. Consequently, it could be estimated that Lc after forming an<br>
optical fiber cable by using the optical fiber to be measured was about 85 m, from the<br>
above Equation (3).<br>
From the above result, it could be estimated that the PMD after forming a cable<br>
by the optical fiber to be measured was 0.05 ps/√km. When the optical fiber to be<br>
measured was actually used to form an optical fiber cable, the PMD was 0.05 ps/√km.<br>
Example 2<br><br>
An optical fiber to be measured before cabling was wound in a length of 3000 m<br>
around a bobbin having a diameter of 300 mm at a tension of 20 gf. When LB was<br>
measured by a measurement using the P-OTDR, LB was 25 m.<br>
On the other hand, when an optical fiber cable having a length of 3000 m was<br>
formed by using the same type of optical fiber, separately from the optical fiber to be<br>
measured, the PMD of the optical fiber constituting the optical fiber cable was 0.07<br>
ps/√km, and LB was 20 m. Consequently, it could be found that Lc after forming an<br>
optical fiber cable by using the optical fiber to be measured was about 73 m, from the<br>
above Equation (3).<br>
From the above result, it could be estimated that the PMD after forming a cable<br>
by the optical fiber to be measured was 0.06 ps/√km. When the optical fiber to be<br>
measured was actually used to form an optical fiber cable, the PMD was 0.06 ps/√km.<br>
Example 3<br>
An optical fiber to be measured was wound in a length of 3000 m around a<br>
bobbin having a diameter of 300 mm at a tension of 20 gf. When the P-OTDR<br>
measurement was carried out by using an OTDR having a resolution of 2 m, the<br>
waveform as shown in FIG. 3 required for measuring LB could not be observed.<br>
On the other hand, when the P-OTDR measurement was carried out by using an<br>
OTDR having a resolution of 1 cm, the waveform as shown in FIG. 3 could be observed,<br>
and it was found that LB was 1.2 m.<br>
On the other hand, when an optical fiber cable having a length of 3000 m was<br>
formed by using the same type of optical fiber, separately from the optical fiber to be<br>
measured, the PMD was 1.0 ps/√km, and LB was 2.0 m. Consequently, it could be found<br>
that Lc after forming an optical fiber cable by using the optical fiber to be measured was<br>
about 150 m, from the above Equation (3).<br><br>
From the above result, it could be estimated that the PMD after forming a cable<br>
by the optical fiber to be measured was 1.67 ps/√km. When the optical fiber to be<br>
measured was actually used to form an optical fiber cable, it was found that the PMD<br>
was 1.60 ps/√km, and that the PMD could be estimated accurately.<br>
Example 4<br>
3000 m of an optical fiber was prepared, which was the same type as that used in<br>
Example 1, and had LB of 30 m in a state where birefringence was not induced by an<br>
external force, and this optical fiber was wound around a bobbin having a diameter of<br>
300 mm at a tension of 20 gf.<br>
After winding the optical fiber around the bobbin, when LB was measured by the<br>
P-OTDR, LB was 30 m. When the optical fiber was wound around the same bobbin at a<br>
tension of 70 gf, LB was 16 m, which was shorter than that for in a state where<br>
birefringence was not induced by an external force.<br>
When the same optical fiber cable as in Example 1 was formed by this optical<br>
fiber, Lc was 85 m. Therefore, it could be estimated that the PMD of the optical fiber<br>
after optical cabling was 0.05 ps/√km, when the optical fiber was wound around the<br>
bobbin at a tension of 20 gf. Moreover, it could be estimated that the PMD of the optical<br>
fiber after optical cabling was 0.1 ps/√km, when the optical fiber was wound around the<br>
bobbin at a tension of 70 gf.<br>
The PMD after forming cables, respectively, by these two optical fibers were 0.05<br>
ps/√km in both cases, and the PMD could be accurately estimated from the beat length<br>
when the optical fiber was wound around the bobbin at a tension of 20 gf. However, the<br>
PMD could not be estimated from the beat length when the optical fiber was wound<br>
around the bobbin at a tension of 70 gf.<br><br>
Example 5<br>
In 40 Gb/s transmission, it is preferable that the PMD of an optical fiber of an<br>
optical fiber cable be equal to or less than 0.1 ps/√km. When the same type of optical<br>
fiber cable as in Example 1 is formed by using the same type of optical fiber as in<br>
Example 1, since Lc of the optical fiber cable is about 85 m, then according to Equation<br>
(3), if LB at the time of optical cabling is longer than 15 m, a PMD equal to or less than<br>
0.1 ps/√km can be achieved.<br>
An optical fiber of the same type as that mentioned in Example 1 and having a<br>
length of 3000 m was prepared. Then when this optical fiber was wound around a<br>
bobbin having a diameter of 300 mm at a tension of 20 gf, and LB was measured by using<br>
the P-OTDR, it was found that LB was 20 m. Next, when this optical fiber was wound<br>
around a bobbin having a diameter of 150 mm at a tension of 70 gf, and LB was<br>
measured by using the P-OTDR, it was found that LB was 10 m.<br>
Moreover, when the optical fiber was used to form optical fiber cables, the PMD<br>
was 0.06 ps/√km for both cases, which was less than 0.1 ps/√km.<br>
In other words, when the optical fiber was wound around the bobbin having a<br>
diameter of 300 mm at a tension of 20 gf, the magnitude of the birefringence induced by<br>
winding the optical fiber around the bobbin was smaller than the magnitude of the<br>
internal birefringence allowed in the standard for the optical fiber. Therefore it could be<br>
confirmed that the PMD standard could be satisfied after optical cabling, in the state<br>
where the optical fiber was wound around the bobbin. However, when the optical fiber<br>
was wound around the bobbin having a diameter of 150 mm at a tension of 70 gf, it could<br>
not be confirmed that the PMD standard could be satisfied after optical cabling, in the<br>
state where the optical fiber was wound around the bobbin.<br>
Example 6<br><br>
If the same type of optical fiber cable as in Example 1 is formed by using the<br>
same type of optical fiber as in Example 1, since Lc of the optical fiber cable is about 85<br>
m, then according to Equation (3), it is found that if LB at the time of winding the optical<br>
fiber around the bobbin is longer than 15 m, a PMD equal to or less than 0.1 ps/√km can<br>
be achieved, at the time of optical cabling. Here, according to Equations (1) and (6), the<br>
radius ofthe bobbin making LB 15 mis about 0.07 m for a wavelength of 1.55 µm.<br>
To calculate this value, as values for the wavelength of 1.55 µm, n = 1.444, p11 =<br>
0.1486, p12 = 0.2959, and v = 0.186 were used. These values are those of synthetic<br>
quartz for the wavelength of 1.55 |xm, and since members constituting the optical fiber<br>
are mainly synthetic quartz, these values can be used. Moreover, it is assumed that r =<br>
62.5 x 10-6 m, and the influence of a fiber coating is not taken into consideration.<br>
Accordingly, when the optical fiber was wound around a bobbin having a radius<br>
of 0.07 m or larger, it could be confirmed that the PMD of the optical fiber after optical<br>
cabling became equal to or less than 0.1 ps/√km, if LB at that time was equal to or longer<br>
than 15 m.<br>
On the other hand, when the optical fiber was wound around a bobbin having a<br>
radius smaller than 0.07 m, LB became shorter than 15 m under the influence of<br>
birefringence induced by bending. Therefore, in the state where the optical fiber was<br>
wound around the bobbin, it could not be confirmed whether the PMD after optical<br>
cabling became 0.1 ps/√km or less.<br>
An optical fiber of the same type as that mentioned in Example 1 and having a<br>
length of 3000 m was prepared. Then when this optical fiber was wound around a<br>
bobbin having a diameter of 300 mm at a tension of 20 gf, and LB was measured by using<br>
the P-OTDR, it was found that LB was 20 m.<br><br>
Next, when this optical fiber was wound around a bobbin having a diameter of<br>
100 mm at a tension of 20 gf, and LB was measured by using the P-OTDR, it was found<br>
that LB was 7 m.<br>
Moreover, when the optical fiber was used to form optical fiber cables, the PMD<br>
was 0.06 ps/√km in both cases, which was less than 0.1 ps/√km.<br>
In other words, when the optical fiber was wound around the bobbin having a<br>
diameter of 300 mm, it could be confirmed that the PMD standard could be satisfied after<br>
optical cabling, in the state where the optical fiber was wound around the bobbin, but it<br>
could not be confirmed, when the optical fiber was wound around the bobbin having a<br>
diameter of 100 mm.<br>
An optical fiber of the same type as that mentioned in Example 1 and having a<br>
length of 10000 m was prepared. Then when this optical fiber was wound around a<br>
bobbin having a diameter of 300 mm at a tension of 100 gf, and LB was measured by<br>
using the P-OTDR, it was found that LB was 10 m.<br>
The bobbin around which the optical fiber was wound had a structure capable of<br>
reducing the tension. Therefore, when the tension was temporarily reduced, to perform<br>
the same measurement, it was found that LB was 25 m in a section of from 0 m to 9000 m.<br>
However LB was 10 m in a section of from 9000 m to 10000 m.<br>
Moreover, when the optical fiber was cut into ten pieces of 1000 m, and bundled<br>
to form an optical fiber cable of ten cores, the PMD of the coated optical fiber formed by<br>
using the section of 0 m to 9000 m was within the range of from 0.03 to 0.06 ps/√km, but<br>
in the core line using the section of 9000 to 10000 m, the PMD exceeded 0.1 ps/√km.<br>
In other words, by having a structure capable of temporarily reducing the tension,<br>
it could be confirmed whether the PMD standard was satisfied after optical cabling, but<br>
when this structure was not used, confirmation was not possible. After the measurement,<br><br>
since the tension was returned to that before the measurement, there was no problem in<br>
feeding the optical fiber in the subsequent manufacturing process.<br>
Moreover, by using the P-OTDR, the PMD in the longitudinal direction of the<br>
optical fiber could be measured.<br>
Example 7<br>
The present inventor investigated the beat length required for achieving a PMD<br>
equal to or less than 0.1 ps/√km as the whole transmission path, and the beat length<br>
required for achieving a PMD equal to or less than 0.1 ps/√km in an individual optical<br>
fiber cable, by using combinations of optical fibers and optical fiber cables having<br>
various structures. As a result, when optical fibers having a beat length of 15 m or longer<br>
after optical cabling were coupled, a PMD equal to or less than 0.1 ps/√km could be<br>
achieved as the whole transmission path. Moreover, with regard to an optical fiber<br>
having a beat length of 30 m or longer when used to form an optical fiber cable, the PMD<br>
was equal to or less than 0.1 ps/√km in all individual optical fibers.<br>
In other words, it is preferred that the beat length of the optical fiber in the state<br>
wound around the bobbin be 15 m or longer. Moreover if the beat length of the optical<br>
fiber in the state wound around the bobbin is 30 m or longer, the PMD after optical<br>
cabling can be made equal to or less than 0.1 ps/√km, regardless of the type of the optical<br>
fiber cable.<br>
Therefore, optical fibers having various birefringence were produced, and wound<br>
around a bobbin having a diameter of 300 mm at a tension of 40 gf in a length of 3000 m.<br>
Then the relationship between the beat length in the state wound around the bobbin, and<br>
the PMD after the optical fiber was used to form an optical fiber cable was measured.<br>
The results are shown in FIG. 4. From FIG. 4, a clear relationship can be understood<br><br>
between the beat length in the state wound around the bobbin, and the PMD after the<br>
optical fiber was used to form an optical fiber cable.<br>
The mean value of the PMD after optical cabling of the optical fiber having the<br>
beat length of 15 m or longer in the state wound around the bobbin was 0.05 ps/√km.<br>
All the optical fibers having a beat length of 15 m or longer in the state wound<br>
around the bobbin were connected after optical cabling to form one transmission path,<br>
and the PMD thereof was measured. The PMD of the transmission path was 0.06 ps/√km,<br>
which was smaller than 0.1 ps/√km.<br>
Example 8<br>
Of the optical fibers used in Example 7, the mean value of the PMD of the optical<br>
fibers having a beat length of 30 m or longer in the state wound around the bobbin after<br>
optical cabling, was 0.015 ps/√km, and there was no optical fiber cable having a PMD<br>
exceeding 0.1 ps/√km.<br>
All the optical fibers having a beat length of 30 m or longer in the state wound<br>
around the bobbin were connected after optical cabling to form one transmission path,<br>
and the PMD thereof was measured. The PMD of the transmission path was 0.016<br>
ps/√km, which was sufficiently smaller than 0.1 ps/√km.<br>
Comparative Example<br>
The PMD of the optical fiber used in Example 7 was measured in the state wound<br>
around the bobbin, and the relationship between the PMD in the state wound around the<br>
bobbin, and the PMD after the optical fiber was used to form an optical fiber cable was<br>
measured. The results are shown in FIG. 5. From FIG. 5, a clear relationship cannot be<br>
found between the PMD in the state wound around the bobbin, and the PMD after the<br>
optical fiber was used to form an optical fiber cable.<br><br>
The mean value of the PMD after optical cabling of the optical fibers having a<br>
PMD equal to or less than 0.1 ps/√km in the state wound around the bobbin was 0.09<br>
ps/√km, which was worse than in Example 7, and was not sufficiently smaller than 0.1<br>
ps/√km.<br>
All the optical fibers having a PMD equal to or less than 0.1 ps/√km in the state<br>
wound around the bobbin were connected after optical cabling to form one transmission<br>
path, and the PMD thereof was measured. The PMD of the transmission path was 0.11<br>
ps/√km, which was larger than 0.1 ps/√km<br>
