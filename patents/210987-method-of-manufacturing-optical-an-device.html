"METHOD  OF MANUFACTURING  OPTICAL  DEVICES" AND  RELATED APPROVEMENTS"<br>
THE   UNIVERSITY   COURT  OF  THE   UNIVERSITY   OF  GLASGOW,   of Gilbert Scott Building, University Avenue, Glasgow G12 8QQ, England,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
13-11-2006<br><br>
The present invention relates to a   method of manufacturing an optieal device.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method of manufacturing of optical devices, and in particular, though not exclusively, to manufacturing integrated optical devices or optoelectronic devices, for example, semiconductor optoelectronic devices such as laser diodes, optical modulators, optical amplifiers, optical switches, and the like. The invention further relates to Optoelectronic Integrated Circuits (OEICs) and Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) including such devices.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Quantum "Well Intermixing (QWI) is a process which has been reported as<br>
providing a possible route to monolithic optoelectronic integration.   QWI<br>
may be performed in HI—V semiconductor materials, eg Alurninium Gallium<br>
Arsenide (AlGaAs) and Indium Gallium Arsenide Phosphide (InGaAsP),<br>
which may be grown on binary substrates, eg Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) or<br>
Indium Phosphide (InP).   QWI alters the band-gap of an as-grown structure<br>
Jhrough interdiffusion of elements of a Quantum Well (QW) and associated<br>
barriers to produce an alloy of the constituent components.   The alloy has a<br>
band-gap which is larger than that of the as-grown QW.    Any optical<br>
radiation (light) generated within the QW where no" QWI has taken place can<br>
therefore pass through a QWI or "intermixed" region of alloy which is<br>
effectively transparent to the said optical radiation.<br>
Various QWI techniques have been reported in the literature. For example, QWI can be performed by high temperature diffusion of elements such as Zinc into a semiconductor material including a QW.<br><br>
QWI can also be performed by implantation of elements such as silicon into a QW semiconductor material. In such a technique the implantation element introduces point defects in the structure of the semiconductor material which are moved through the semiconductor material inducing intermixing in the QW structure by a high temperature annealing step.<br>
Such QWI techniques have been reported in "Applications of Neutral Impurity Disordering in Fabricating Low-Loss Optical Waveguides and Integrated Waveguide Devices", Marsh et al, Optical and Quantum Electronics 23,1991, s941~s957, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
A problem exists with such techniques in that although the QWI will alter (increase) the.band-gap of the semiconductor material post-growth, residual diffusion or implantation dopants can introduce large losses due to the free carrier absorption coefficient of these dopant elements.<br>
A further reported QWI technique providing intermixing, is Impurity Free Vacancy Diffusion (IFVD). When performing IFVD the top cap layer of the ITI-V semiconductor structure is typically GaAs or Indium Gallium Arsenide (InGaAs). Upon the top layer is deposited a silica (Si02) film. Subsequent rapid thermal annealing of the semiconductor material causes bonds to break within the semiconductor alloy and Gallium ions or atoms -which are susceptible to silica (Si02) - to dissolve into the silica so as to leave vacancies in the cap layer. The vacancies then diffuse through the semiconductor structure inducing layer intermixing, eg in the QW structure.<br>
IFVD has been reported in "Quantitative Model for the Kinetics of Compositional Intermixing in GaAs-AlGaAs Quantum-Confined Heterostructures", by Helmy et al, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Quantum Electronics, Vol 4, No 4, July/August 1998, pp 653 - 660, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Reported QWI, and particularly IFVD methods, suffer from a number of      disadvantages, eg the temperature at which Gallium out diffuses from the semiconductor material to the silica (Si02) film.<br>
It is an object of at least one aspect of the present invention to obviate or at least mitigate at least one of the aforementioned disadvantages / problems in 1     the prior art.<br>
It is also an object of at least one aspect of the present invention to provide an improved method of manufacturing an optica] device using an improved QWI process.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing an optical device, a device body portion from which the device is to be made including a Quantum Well (QW) structure, the method including the step of:<br>
depositing a dielectric layer on at least part of a surface of the device body portion so as to introduce structural defects at least into a portion of the device body portion adjacent the dielectric layer.<br>
According to a further aspect, the present invention provides a method of manufacturing an optical device, a device body portion from which the device is to be made including a Quantum Well (QW) structure, the method including the step of performing a plasma etch on at least part of a surface of the device body portion so as to introduce structural defects at least into a<br><br>
portion of the device body portion adjacent the surface layer, subsequent to which the etched surface is encapsulated with a dielectric layer.<br>

In said first embodiment, the method may also include the step of depositing a further dielectric layer on the surface of the device body and on a surface of the dielectric layer prior to annealing, preferably without a plasma etch stage, by a technique other than sputtering, eg Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition (PECVD).<br><br><br>
In a second embodiment the method may include the steps of depositing the further dielectric layer and then performing the substrate etch and depositing the dielectric layer.<br>
In said first and second embodiments, the dielectric layer which encapsulates the previously etched layer may comprise an intermixing cap; the further dielectric layer may comprise an intermixing suppressing cap.<br>
The plasma etch may typically be performed for a duration between 0.5 and 10 minutes and the thickness of the encapsulating dielectric layer may be between 10 nanometers to a few hundred nanometers.<br>
The annealing step may occur at a temperature of around 650°C to 850°C - for around 0.5 to 5 minutes, and in one embodiment at substantially 800°C for around 1 minute.<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of manufacturing an optical device, a device body portion from which the device is to be made including a Quantum Well (QW) structure, the method including the step of depositing a dielectric layer on at least part of a surface of the device body portion by sputtering.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS<br>
Referring initially to Figure 1, there is shown a device body portion, generally designated 5, as grown, for use in a method of manufacture of an optical device according to a first embodiment of the present invention. The optical device is an integrated optical device or an optoelectronic device.<br>
The device body portion 5 is suitably fabricated in a IIF-V semiconductor material system such as Gallium Arsenide (GaAs), and therefore operates at one or more wavelength in the range 600 to 1300 ran. Alternatively, and beneficially, the device body portion is fabricated in an Indium Phosphide (InP) semiconductor system and therefore operates at one or more wavelength in the range 1200 to 1700 nm. The device body portion 5 may be made at least partly from Aluminium Gallium Arsenide (AlGaAs),<br><br><br>
Indium Gallirrm Arsenide (InGaAs), Indium Gallium Arsenide Phosphide (InGaAsP), Indium Aluniinium Gallium Arsenide (InAlGaAs) and/or Indium Gallium Aluminium Phosphide (InGaAlP). In this described first embodiment, the device body portion is made from AlGaAs.<br>
The device body portion 5 may form part of a semiconductor wafer (see Figure 1) together with a plurality of other possibly like optical devices which may he cleaved from the wafer after processing. The device body portion 5 comprises substrate 10 upon which is provided a first optical cladding layer 15, a core guiding layer 20, and a second optical cladding layer 25. A Quantum Well (QW) structure 30, including at least one Quantum Well, is provided within the core guiding layer 20, as grown. On the second optical cladding layer 30 there is provided a capping layer 35.<br>
As will be appreciated, the core guiding layer 20, as grown, has a smaller band-gap and higher refractive index than the first and second optical cladding layer 15, 25.<br>
Referring now to Figure 2, there is shown an optical device, generally designated 40, manufactured from the device body portion 5 of Figure 1, by a method which will be described in detail hereinafter. As can be seen from Figure 2, the device 40 comprises an active region 45 and a passive region 50. In this embodiment the active region 45 comprises a Quantum Well (QW) amplifier. However, it should be understood that the active region 45 may, in other embodiments, comprise a laser, modulator switch, detector or like active (electrically controlled) optical device. Further, the passive region 50 comprises a low-loss waveguide wherein the Quantum Well structure 30 has been at least partially removed by a Quantum Well Intermixing (QWT) technique, as will hereinafter be described in greater detail.<br>
The device 40 has excellent alignment between the core layer 20 waveguiding regions of the active region 45 and passive region 50, and has a reflection coefficient between the active region 45 and passive region 50 which is substantially negligible (of the order of 10 j. Further, mode matching between the active region 45 and the passive region 50 is intrinsic to the device 40.<br>
Typically, the substrate 10 is n-rype doped to a first concentration, while the first cladding layer 15 is n-type doped to a second concentration. Further, the core layer 20 is typically substantially intrinsic, while the second cladding layer 25 is typically p-type doped to a third concentration. Further, the cap layer (or contact layer) 35 is p-type doped to a fourth concentration. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, that the cap layer 35 and second cladding layer 25 may be etched into a ridge (not shown), the ridge acting as an optical waveguide to confine optical modes within the core layer 20, both within the optically active region 45 and the optically passive region 50. Further, contact metallisations (not shown) may be formed on at least a portion of the top surface of the ridge within the optically active region 45, and also on an opposing surface of the substrate 10, as is known 1     in the art.<br>
It will further be appreciated that the device 40 may comprise part of an optical integrated circuit, optoelectronic integrated circuit (OEIC), or photonic integrated circuit (PIC) which may comprise one or more of such optical devices 40.<br>
Referring now to Figure 3, there is shown a schematic representation of the band-gap energies of a Quantum Well 31 of the Quantum Well structure 30 within the core layer 20 of the device body portion 5, as grown. As can be seen from Figure 3, the AlGaAs core layer 20 includes at least one Quantum<br><br>
Well 31, with the Quantum Well structure 30 having a lower aluminium content than the surrounding core layer 20, such that the band-gap energy of the Quantum Well structure 30 is less than that of the surrounding AlGaAs core layer 20. The Quantum Well structure 30 is typically around 3 to 20 nm thick, and more typically around 10 nm in thickness.<br>
It will be understood that the description of figure 3 also applies with suitable amendment to a system with an InGaAsP core layer, or any of the other HI—V systems discussed above.<br>
Referring now to Figure 4, there is shown a corresponding portion 32 of the core layer 20 as in Figure 3, but which has been Quantum Well Intermixed (QWI) so as to effectively increase the band-gap energy (meV) of the part 32 which corresponds to the Quantum Well 31 of the Quantum Well structure 30. Quantum Well Interxiiixing (QWI) therefore essentially "washes out" the Quantum Well structure 30 from the core layer 20. The portion shown in Figure 4 relates to the passive region 50 of the device 40. As will be understood, optical radiation transmitted from or generated within the optically active region 45 of device 40 will be transmitted through the low loss waveguide provided by the Quantum Well Intermixed (QWI) region 32 of the core layer 20 of the passive region 50.<br>
Referring now to Figures 5(a) to (f), there is illustrated a first embodiment of a method of manufacturing an optical device 40 from a device body portion 5, including a Quantum Well (QW) structure 30 according to the present invention, the method including the steps (see Figures 5(b) to (d)) of performing a plasma etch and subsequent deposition of a dielectric layer 51 on at least part of a surface 52 of the device body portion 5 so as to introduce point defects into a portion 53 of the device body portion 5 adjacent the dielectric layer 51.<br><br>
The method of manufacture begins with the step of providing a substrate 10, growing on the substrate 10 first optical cladding layer 15, core guiding layer 20 including at least one Quantum Well (QW) 30, second optical cladding layer 25, and cap layer 35.<br>
The first optical cladding layer 15, core guiding layer 20, second optical cladding layer 25, and cap layer 35 may be grown by known semiconductor epitaxial growth techniques such as Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) or Metal Organic Chemical Vapour Deposition (MOCVD). Once the device body 5 has been grown - normally as part of a wafer (not shown) including a plurality of such device body portions 5 - a pattern may be defined in photoresist (PR) 55 on surface 52 of the device body portion 5.<br>
The plasma etch is performed on surface prior to the deposition of the dielectric layer 51 on the surface 52, and the photoresist 55 lifted off so as to leave the dielectric layer 51 on the said at least part of the surface 52 of the device body portion 5. As can be seen from Figures 5(c) and 5(d), the plasma etch performed on, and/or dielectric layer 51 deposited on, at least part of the surface 52 of device body portion 5, causes localised damage in region 53 of the cap layer 35, and introduces point defects into the cap layer 35.<br>
Referring briefly to Figure 6, the plasma etch and dielectric layer 51 deposition are effected by sputtering, and in this embodiment the etch and dielectric layer 51 deposition are performed by sputtering using a diode sputterer apparatus, generally designated 65. The dielectric layer 51 substantially comprises silica (Si02), but may in a modification comprise another dielectric material such as aluminium oxide (A1203).<br><br><br>
As can be seen from Figure 6, the sputterer apparatus 65 includes a chamber 70 which in use is substantially filled with an inert gas such as argon which is preferably provided within the chamber 70 at a pressure of around 2 microns of Hg. The sputterer 65 also comprises an RF source 75 which can be connected to either (a) the target electrode (cathode) 80 of the diode sputterer 65 for dielectric layer deposition, or (b) the substrate electrode 85 for plasma etch of the device body portion.<br>
A silica target 81 is provided on the target electrode (cathode) 80, while the device body portion 5 (on wafer 82) is provided on the substrate electrode (anode) 85 of the sputterer 65. In use, as can be seen from Figure 6, an argon plasma 86 is generated between the cathode 80 and anode 85 with, first and second dark spaces 90,95 being provided between the silica target 81 and the argon plasma 86 and between the argon plasma and the device body portion 5, respectively.<br>
The steps of plasma etching the semiconductor surface and depositing the<br>
dielectric layer 51 comprises part of a Quantum Well Intermixing (QWI)<br>
process  used in the  manufacture  of the  device  40,  the   QWI process<br>
comprising   (in   a   preferred   embodiment)   an   Impurity-Free   Vacancy<br>
Disordering (IFVD) technique.    It has been surprisingly found that by<br>
plasma etching the semiconductor surface and subsequently depositing the<br>
dielectric layer 51 used in QWI techniques such as IFVD by sputtering using<br>
the sputterer 65, damage induced defects appear to be introduced into the<br>
portion 53 of the device body portion 5 adjacent dielectric cap 51; the<br>
portion 53 in this case comprising part of the cap layer 35. It is believed that<br>
the damage breaks bonds in the cap layer 35 prior to annealing (which will<br>
hereinafter be described), eg the application of thermal energy by rapid<br>
thermal annealing, thereby expediting the transfer of gallium and / or indium<br>
from the cap layer 35 into the dielectric layer 51.<br><br><br>
The dielectric layer 51 is typically between 10 to 1000 nm, and typically 200 or 300 nm in thickness. The method of manufacture includes a further step as shown in Figure 5(e) of depositing further dielectric layer 60 on the surface 52 of device body 5 and on a surface of the dielectric layer 51 prior to annealing. The further dielectric layer 60 is deposited without a preliminary plasma etch and preferably also by a technique other than diode sputtering, and preferably by a technique other than sputtering per se, eg Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition (PECVD).<br>
The dielectric layer 51 encapsulating the plasma etched layer therefore comprises an intermix cap layer, while the further dielectric layer 60 comprises an intermix suppressing cap layer. The intermix suppressing cap layer is used to protect the surface .52 from arsenic and / or phosphorus desorption. The method will work without the intermix suppressing cap layer; however the quality of the surface 52 may not be so good.<br>
As shown in Figure 5(f), subsequent to deposition of the further dielectric layer 60, the device body portions including the dielectric layer 51 and further dielectric layer 60 are annealed at an elevated temperature. The annealing stage comprises a rapid thermal annealing stage, the annealing temperature being around 700°C to 1000°C, or more preferably 650°C to 850°C, for around 0.5 to 5 minutes, and in one implementation, at approximately S00°C for about 1 minute.<br>
The action of the annealing step of Figure 5f) is illustrated diagrammatically in Figures 7(a) and (b). As can be seen from Figures 7(a) and (b), the annealing step causes "out diffusion" of gallium and/or indium from the cap layer 35 to the intermixing cap, ie dielectric layer 51. However, portions of the cap layer 35 below the suppressing cap, ie further dielectric layer 60, are<br><br><br>
not subject to gallium and/or indium "out-diffusion". The portions of the cap layer 35 which lie within an area of the ktennixmg cap, ie dielectric cap 51, are subject to out-diffusion of gallium and/or indium as shown in Figure 7(b).   The out-difiusion of gallium and/or indium leaves vacancies behind<br>
5 which vacancies migrate from the cap layer 35, through the second cladding layer 25, and into the core layer 20, and hence to the Quantum Well stracture(s) 30, thereby changing the effective band-gap of the Quantum Well (QW) structure 30, and effectively washing-out the Quantum Wells of the Quantum Well structure 30 below the intermixing cap layer.<br>
i<br>
It will be appreciated that the intermixing cap, ie the dielectric layer 51 encapsulating the plasma etched surface 52, is provided within the area of the passive region 50 to be formed in device 40, while the suppressing cap, ie further dielectric layer 60, is provided on the device body portion 5 in areas such as the optically active region 45 to be formed on the device 5, which areas are not to be Quantum Well Intermixed (QWI).<br>
Once the device body portion 5 has been processed to the stage of Figure 5(f), and annealed, the dielectric layer 51 and further dielectric layer 60 may be removed by conventional methods, eg wet or dry etching.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
There now follows examples which illustrate typical band-gap shifts which can be obtained using IFVD in a method of manufacturing an optoelectronic device according to the present invention in a long wavelength aluminium alloy such as Indium Aluminium Gallium Arsenide, (InAlGaAs), or InGaAsP, (InGaAsP), grown on an Indium Phosphide (InP) substrate.<br>
The dielectric layer 51 deposition requires a sputter chamber 70 configured with a target-substrate electrode (plate) separation of the order of 50 to 100<br><br>
nrm. The target electrode 80 and substrate electrode 85 are each configured as substantially eight inch circular plates. The gas used in this example for sputter etch and deposition is typically argon, but other suitable inert gases may be used, and also small amounts of oxygen may be added to the argon plasma 86, eg approximately 10% by volume, to improve the stoichiometry of the deposited dielectric layer 51. The dielectric material used in the method is typically silica (Si02), but other dielectric materials such as aluminium oxide (A1203) can be used.<br>
It has been found that a preferred pressure range in the chamber 70 for the method is between 1 and 5 microns of Hg. For sputter etch RP power values shown in Table 1 below, a one minute sputter etch was carried out on the surface of the semiconductor wafer 52, including at least one device body portion 5. The thickness of the subsequently deposited dielectric film 45 was from 10 to a few hundred ran. The band-gap shift figures in Table 1 illustrate the band-gap shift in an InGaAs-InAlGaAs QW structure 30 for an anneal at a temperature of 800 C for a time of 1 minute.<br>
TABLE 1<br><br>
Sputter etch RF power	Deposition Conditions	Band gap shift (run)<br>
None	PECYD (Si02)	1<br>
300W	Sputtered (Si02)	12<br>
500W	Sputtered (Si02)	21<br>
700W	Sputtered (Si02)	38<br>
Table 1 illustrates that etching the surface of the semiconductor 52 followed by encapsulation with sputtered silica provides an enhancement in intermixing compared to non-sputtered silica (Si02), and also illustrates that<br><br><br>
the effectiveness of the pre-etched sputtered silica (Si02) cap increases with RF power used during the sputter etch.<br>
Further data from plasma etching the surface 53 of an InGaAs-InGaAsP QW structure followed by deposition of sputtered Si02 layer 51 is presented in Table 2. Two sputter etch powers are shown in Table 2, along with two sputtering pressure settings, each referring to a one minute sputter etch of the semiconductor surface 52, including at least one device body portion 5. The thickness of the subsequently deposited dielectric film 51 was from 10 to a few hundred nm. The band-gap shift figures in Table 2 illustrate the band-gap shift in an InGaAs-InGaAsP QW structure 30 for an anneal at a temperature of 700°C for a time of 1 minute.<br>
TABLE 2<br><br>
Sputter etch RE Power	Sputter etch pressure	Deposition Conditions	Band gap shift (nm)<br>
NONE	NONE	PECVD (Si02)	11<br>
300	1	Sputtered (Si02)	61<br>
300	3	Sputtered (Si02)	58<br>
750	1	Sputtered (Si02)	78<br>
750	3	Sputtered (Si02)	45<br>
Table 2 again illustrates that etching the surface 52 of the semiconductor followed by encapsulation with sputtered silica 51 provides an enhancement in intermixing compared to non-sputtered silica (Si02), and also illustrates that the effectiveness of the pre-etched sputtered silica (Si02) cap 51 is not strongly dependent on pressure for low power etches but is dependent upon pressure for higher power etches., the effectiveness decreasing with increasing sputter pressure. Table 2 also illustrates the lower thermal stability of the InGaAs-InGaAsP QW material compared to<br><br>
-	<br>
InGaAs-InAlGaAs QW material, as, for a given sputter etch power, larger shifts are obtained at reduced annealing temperatures.<br>
In a second embodiment of a method of manufacraring an optical device 40 according to the present invention, to process a wafer to produce more than one band-gap a film of PECVD Si02 is deposited on to the wafer to provide further dielectric layer 60. Photolithography techniques are then used to delineate a pattern on top of the PECVD Si02. Either wet or dry etching can then be used to transfer the partem into the PECVD (Si02).<br>
Patterned photoresist (PR) is then left on top of the patterned PECVD (Si02), and the sample/wafer is then placed into the sputtering apparatus 65 for plasma etching of the uncoated surface 52 and subsequent deposition of the dielectric layer 51. After deposition the sample is immersed in acetone and the sputtered Si02 on the photoresist is removed in a "lift-off" process.<br>
A rapid thermal anneal is now performed at a suitable temperature (650-850°C) for the required period of time (0.5 - 5min). This enables the point defects generated at the surface 52 to propagate through the device body portion 5 and cause interdiffusion of the elements.<br>
It will be appreciated that the embodiment of the invention hereinbefore described are given by way of example only, and are not meant to limit the scope thereof in any way.<br>
It should be particularly understood that the damage induced in the semiconductor device body portion 5 adjacent to the sputtered dielectric layer 51 is believed to arise from bombardment of ions and/or radiation in the form of secondary electrons and soft x-rays. The damage to the surface 50 of the semiconductor device body portion  5   or wafer 82,  can be<br><br>
introduced by various means in the sputtering apparatus 65, an effective method being to use a diode configuration in the deposition chamber 70.<br>
Using a diode configuration is also believed to permit more radiation damage to the device body portion 5 (or "sample") than in the more usual magnetron machine arrangement wherein magnets create a high local field which it is believed stop particles travelling from.the dielectric target 81 to the device body portion 5 provided on the wafer 82 of semiconductor material.)<br>
It will further be appreciated that an optical device according to the present invention may include a waveguide such as a ridge or buried heterostructure or indeed any other suitable waveguide.<br>
It will also be appreciated that the Quantum Well Intermixed (QWI) regions may comprise optically active device(s).<br>
Further, it will be appreciated that sequential processing including using several RF powers may be used to provide a device with several different QWI band-gaps.<br><br>
