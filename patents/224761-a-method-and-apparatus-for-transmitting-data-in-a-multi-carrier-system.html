				<td>A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR TRANSMITTING<br>
DATA IN A MULTI-CARRIER SYSTEM<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for transmitting data in<br>
a multi-carrier system and generally to communication systems, and in particular, to<br>
a method and apparatus for transmitting and receiving data in a multi-carrier communication<br>
system.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a well-known<br>
multicarrier modulation method that is used in several wireless system<br>
standards. Some of the systems using OFDM include 5 GHz high data rate<br>
wireless LANs (IEEE802.11 a, HiperLan2, MMAC), digital audio and digital<br>
video broadcast in Europe (DAB and DVB-T, respectively), and broadband<br>
fixed wireless systems such as IEEE802.16a. An OFDM system divides the<br>
available bandwidth into very many narrow frequency bands (subcarriers), with<br>
data being transmitted in parallel on the subcarriers. Each subcarrier utilizes a<br>
different portion of the occupied frequency band.<br>
Spreading can also be applied to the data in an OFDM system to provide<br>
various forms of multicarrier spread spectrum. Such spread-OFDM systems are<br>
generally referred to as either Spread OFDM (SOFDM), mullicairicr CDMA<br>
(MC CDMA). or Orthlogenal Frequency Code Division, Multiplexing<br>
(OFCDM) For systems employing MC CDMA, spreading is applied in the<br>
frequency dimension and multiple signals (users) can occupy the same set of<br>
subcarriers by using different sprending, codes. For OFCDM, different users me<br>
assigned different mutually orthogonal spreading codes, and the spread signals<br>
are combined prior to transmission on the downlink. Spreading can be applied<br>
in the frequency dimension, or the time dimension, or a combination of time<br>
and frequency spreading can be used. In any case, orthogonal codes such as Walsh<br>
codes are used for the spreading function, and multiple data symbols can be code<br>
multiplexed onto different Walsh codes (i.e., multi-code transmission).<br>
Focusing on OFCDM systems, the orthogonality between Walsh codes is only<br>
preserved if the channel is constant over all of the time / frequency resources thai are<br>
spanned by the Walsh code. This leads to different tradeoffs between lime and<br>
frequency spreading for different system parameters (e.g., subcarrier and OFDM<br>
symbol spacing) and different channel conditions (e.g.,delay spread and doppler<br>
spread).<br>
For an OFCDM system with a spreading factor of SF in the time dimension, in<br>
which each symbol is represented by SF chips, up to SF Walsh codes can be active on<br>
each subcarrier. For channel estimation, one of these Walsh codes can be assigned as<br>
a pilot signal (i.e., in the same way that a pilot signal is created in conventional single-<br>
carrier CDMA systems such as IS-95).However, aproblem with this method is that<br>
when time-variations are significant, for example due to vehicular mobility, the<br>
orthogonality of the Walsh codes is lost. This causes the pilot channel to suffer<br>
interference from the other Walsh codes. Channel estimation is degraded due to this<br>
interference. Additionally, when despreading the pilot channel, a single channel<br>
estimate results for the entire spread block of SF "chips". This single channel estimate<br>
is not accurate when the channel varies significantly over the block (SF chips).<br>
Therefore, a need exists for a method and apparatus for transmission and reception<br>
within an OFDM communication system that provides a more accurate channel<br>
estimate, and reduces the amount of pilot channel degradation for time-varying<br>
channels.<br>
US6108317 discloses a satellite communication system comprising of a central<br>
hub/gateway station and remote very small aperture terminal (VSAT) stations. VSAT<br>
inbound transmissions are spread in bandwidth using an assigned PN code sequence.<br>
This sequence is derived as a cyclic function of a basse sequence for use by the group<br>
of VSATs. The gateway transmits a continuous outbound signal that functions as the<br>
frequency and timing reference. In addition, the gateway periodically forms timing<br>
and frequency error estimates on each VSAT transmission and broadcasts these<br>
results over the outbound channel to the VSATs. Said reference fails to teach or<br>
otherwise suggest the Applicant's claimed subject matter of spreading data streams<br>
and a pilot stream, combining the spread pilot stream with a chip stream, and lime<br>
shifting each chip stream by a predetermined amount.<br>

Detailed Description of the Accompanying Drawings<br>
In order to address the above-mentioned need, a method and apparatus<br>
for transmitting and receiving data in a spread OFDM system is provided<br>
herein. In particular, a staggered time-spread OFCDM scheme is utilized that<br>
improves channel estimation. In a first embodiment, each chip stream is time<br>
shifted by a predetermined amount and then transmitted on a predetermined<br>
subcarrier. This results in time-spread symbols being staggered (time-offset) on<br>
different subcarriers allowing for more frequent sampling of the channel,<br>
improving channel estimation. In a second embodiment a staggered spreading<br>
approach is applied in the frequency dimension to improve the performance of a<br>
system with spreading in the frequency dimension.<br>
The present invention encompasses a method for transmitting data in a<br>
multi-carrier system where data from an individual user is transmitted on multiple<br>
subcarriers, the method comprising the steps of: de-multiplexing a data stream<br>

data streams with a spreading code to produce a plurality of chip streams;<br>
spreading a pilot stream to produce a spread pilot stream; combining the spread<br>
pilot stream with a chip stream from the plurality of chip streams; and time<br>
shifting each chip stream by a predetermined amount; and transmitting each<br>
time-shifted chip stream on a predetermined subcarrier; wherein the step of time<br>
shifting each chip stream comprises the step of time shifting the combination of<br>
the pilot stream and the chip stream.<br>
The present invention additionally encompasses a methpd for transmitting<br>
data, the method comprising the steps of: de-multiplexing a symbol stream to<br>
produce a plurality of de-multiplexed symbols; spreading each symbol with a<br>
spreading code to produce a plurality spread symbols, each comprising a<br>
predetermined number of chips; for a first transmission interval, mapping a first<br>
chip of a spread symbol to a predetermined subcarrier; and for a second<br>
transmission interval, mapping the first chip of a spread symbol to a second<br>
subcarrier, wherein the second subcarrier differs from the first subcarrier.<br>
The present invention additionally encompasses a method for transmitting<br>
data in a multi-carrier communication system, said method comprising the steps<br>
of: receiving a multicarrier signal comprising a plurality of subcarriers;<br>
demodulating the multicarrier signal to produce a chip stream; despreading<br>
the chip stream with a pilot code during a first symbol period to produce a first<br>
channel estimate for the first symbol period; despreading the chip stream with<br>
the pilot code during a second symbol period to produce a second channel<br>
estimate for the second symbol period; generating a third channel estimate only<br>
for a portion of the first symbol period based on the first and the second channel<br>
estimates; and generating a fourth channel estimate for a second portion of the<br>
first symbol period based on the first and the second channel estimates.<br>
The present invention additionally encompasses an apparatus comprising<br>
a de-multiplexer, de-multiplexing a data stream to produce a plurality of de-<br>
multiplexed data streams; a spreader spreading the de-multiplexed data streams<br>
with a spreading code to produce a plurality chip streams, time shifting each chip<br>
stream by a predetermined amount, and a transmitter transmitting each time-<br>
shifted chip stream on a predetermined subcarrier.<br>
The present invention additionally encompasses an apparatus for<br>
transmitting data in a multi-carrier communication system, said apparatus<br>
comprising: a de-multiplexer, de-multiplexing a symbol stream to produce a<br>
plurality of de-multiplexed symbols; a spreader, spreading each symbol with a<br>
spreading code to produce a plurality spread symbols, each comprising a<br>
predetermined number of chips; and a mapper, for a first transmission interval,<br>
mapping a first chip of a spread symbol to a predetermined subcarrier and for a<br>
second transmission interval, mapping the first chip of a spread symbol to a<br>
second subcarrier, wherein the second subcarrier differs from the first subcarrier.<br>
The present invention additionally encompasses an apparatus for<br>
transmitting data in a multi-carrier communication system, said apparatus<br>
comprising: a receiver, receiving a multicarrier signal comprising a plurality of<br>
subcarriers and demodulating the multicarrier signal to produce a chip stream; a<br>
channel estimator, despreading the chip stream with a pilot code during a first<br>
symbol period to produce a first channel estimate for the first symbol period, and<br>
despreading the chip stream with the pilot code during a second symbol period<br>
to produce a second channel estimate for the second symbol period; and an<br>
interpolator generating a third channel estimate only for a portion of the first<br>
symbol period based on the first and the second channel estimates and<br>
generating a fourth channel estimate for a second portion of the first symbol<br>
period based on the first and the second channel estimates.<br>
Turning now to the drawings, wherein like numerals designate like<br>
components, FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 show examples of prior-art methods for including<br>
pilot symbols in an OFDM-based system. Note that these prior art methods can<br>
be sued for systems that transit regular OFDM data, or spread data (such as<br>
MC-CDMA, OFCDM). However, note that each individual pilot symbol occupies<br>
only "one subcarrier by one OFDM symbol period", and also note that the pilot<br>
and data are not code multiplexed. Instead, the pilot symbols are separated in<br>
time and/or frequency from the data. In these prior art methods, a channel<br>
estimate may be obtained at each pilot symbol location, which is<br>
separate from the data or spread data locations. Then, the channel may be<br>
estimated at other locations in the time-frequency grid, especially locations<br>
where data or spread data is located, so the data can be despread and detected.<br>
In contrast with the prior art methods of FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, the preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention comprises the use of a spread pilot that is<br>
code multiplexed with spread data.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a prior art spread OFDM channel structure.<br>
Particularly, FIG. 3 illustrates an OFCDM system with spreading in the time<br>
dimension. The time-frequency grid for this type of a system with SF - 8 is<br>
. shown where each symbol is spread with 8 chips. The eight chips ,are then<br>
transmitted on a particular frequency (subcarrier). As shown in FIG. 3, eight<br>
chips representing a first symbol are transmitted on subcarrier 1, followed by<br>
another eight chips representing another symbol. Similar transmissions occur on<br>
subcarriers 2 through 4. Up to SF symbols can be code multiplexed onto the-<br>
same time/frequency space. For example, up to SF symbols can be code<br>
multiplexed onto the same subcarrier during a single spreading block interval, b.<br>
In a system with a code multiplexed pilot, at least one of the Walsh codes is<br>
used as a pilot channel.<br>
The composite signal at a particular location in the time-frequency grid<br>
is described as<br>
where:<br>
b is the spreading block interval index (note that b increases by one every SF<br>
OFDM symbol periods);<br>
n is the chip index within the bth spreading block interval. Note that n<br>
increments from 1 to SF within each spreading block interval b;<br>
k is the subcarrier index, 1 
c denotes the scrambling code;<br>
i is the Walsh code index, 1 
p denotes the Walsh code index that is used for the pilot channel;<br>
W1 denotes the 7th Walsh code;<br>
A, denotes the (real) gain applied to the ith Walsh code channel (e.g., based on<br>
power control settings, if any); and<br>
d1de notes the complex data symbol that modulates the ith Walsh code. dp<br>
denotes the pilot symbol that modulates the /7th Walsh code channel (i.e., the<br>
pilot channel).<br>
Note that an OFCDM system has different characteristics than<br>
conventional single-carrier CDM/CDMA systems. In single-carrier CDMA<br>
systems, a common source of signal distortion is inter-chip interference due to<br>
multipath delay spread. This inter-chip interference destroys the orthogonality<br>
between different orthogonal spreading codes even though the channel does not<br>
vary within a spreading block. The use of an OFDM-based multicarrier spread<br>
system such as OFCDM eliminates the inter-chip interference problem because<br>
of its reduced chip rate together with the cyclic prefix that is commonly used in<br>
OFDM-based systems. However, with the use of OFCDM, a new problem<br>
arises. In OFCDM, the chip duration is much greater than in a comparable-<br>
bandwidth single carrier system. As a result, the duration of a spreading block is<br>
greatly expanded in an OFCDM system, and this creates an inherent problem of<br>
sensitivity to channel variation over a spreading block. Channel variation within<br>
a spreading block causes interference between orthogonal spreading codes, and<br>
additionally leads to channel estimation problems if a code multiplexed pilot is<br>
used.<br>
As discussed above, prior art spread OFDM systems can lose<br>
orthogonality when time-variations occur within the spread block. This causes<br>
the pilot channel to suffer interference from the other Walsh codes. Channel<br>
estimation is degraded due to this interference. Additionally, when despreading<br>
the pilot channel, a single channel estimate results for the entire spread block of<br>
SF "chips." This single channel estimate is not accurate when the channel varies<br>
significantly over the block. In order to address these issues, in the preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention a staggered time-spread OFCDM scheme<br>
is utilized that improves channel estimation. In particular, each chip stream is<br>
time shifted by a predetermined amount and then transmitted on a<br>
predetermined subcarrier. This results in time-spread symbols being staggered<br>
(time-offset) on different subcarriers allowing for more frequent sampling of the<br>
channel. Increased channel sampling rate results in improved channel estimator<br>
performance and improved channel tracking ability for higher dopplers (e.g.,<br>
higher vehicle speeds or higher channel frequencies in a mobile wireless<br>
system). Moreover, the present invention allows more flexibility in selecting the<br>
parameters of an OFCDM system (such as SF, chip duration, number of<br>
subcarriers) since the resulting system is more robust to channel variations.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates such a spread OFDM channel structure in accordance<br>
with the preferred embodiment of the present invention. As is evident, from one<br>
subcarrier to another, the first chip for each symbol is staggered in time. In this<br>
particular example, the "stagger offset" (SO) is equal to 4, so from one<br>
subcarrier to the next each symbol (comprising SF chips) is offset by 4 chip<br>
periods. For this example, as with the example described in FIG. 3, SF = 8, with<br>
each symbol being spread with 8 chips. The eight chips are then transmitted on<br>
a particular frequency (subcarrier). As shown in FIG. 4, sixteen chips<br>
representing up to SF*2 symbols are transmitted on subcarrier 1, with sixteen<br>
chips representing up to another SF*2 symbols being transmitted on subcarrier<br>
2. However, the sixteen chips transmitted on subcarrier 2 are time shifted so that<br>
transmission of the first chip takes place during the same time period as<br>
transmission of the 4th chip on subcarrier 1. A similar transmission pattern<br>
occurs for subcarriers 3 and 4.<br>
FIG. 5 is a block diagram of transmitter 300 in a spread OFDM<br>
communication system in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention. As shown, transmitter 300 comprises de-multiplexer 301,<br>
spreaders 302 and 304, time shifter 305, and OFDM modulator/transmitter 306.<br>
For simplicity, data from a single user (e.g., uplink) or for a single user (e.g.,<br>
downlink) is shown in FIG. 5, however one of ordinary skill in the art will<br>
recognize that in typical OFCDM transmitters, multiple users transmit (or are<br>
transmitted to) simultaneously with up to SF symbols occupying the same<br>
time/frequency space. During operation a data stream from/for a user enters de-<br>
multiplexer 301 where the data stream is de-multiplexed into a plurality of data<br>
streams. Typical de-multiplexing operations convert a data stream at a given<br>
data rate (R) into N data streams each having a data rate of R/N.<br>
Continuing, the de-multiplexed data streams enter spreader 302 where<br>
standard spreading occurs, producing a plurality of chip streams. Particularly,<br>
for an example scenario where the data and spreading codes are binary, spreader<br>
302 modulo 2 adds an orthogonal code (e.g., an 8 chip Walsh code) to data<br>
symbol. For example, in 8 chip spreading, data symbols are each replaced by<br>
an8 chip spreading code or its inverse, depending on whether the data symbol<br>
was a 0 or 1. More generally, the spreading code is modulated by a complex<br>
data symbol, for example dt in the earlier equations; mis complex data symbol<br>
may be selected from a M-ary QAM or M-ary PSK constellation, for example.<br>
The spreading code preferably corresponds to a Walsh code from an 8 by 8<br>
Hadamard matrix wherein a Walsh code is a single row or column of the matrix.<br>
Thus, for each data stream, spreader 302 repetitively outputs a Walsh code<br>
modulated by the present input data symbol value. It should be noted that in<br>
alternate embodiments of the present invention additional spreading or other<br>
operations may occur by spreader 302. For example, power control and/or data<br>
scrambling may be done, as shown in the previous equation.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention a single pilot per<br>
sub-channel is broadcast along with each symbol stream, providing channel<br>
estimation to aid in subsequent demodulation of a transmitted signal. The single<br>
pilot channel is utilized by all users receiving data during the particular<br>
frequency/time period. In alternate embodiments of the present invention, the<br>
transmission of the pilot channel may be "skipped" at various time<br>
periods/subcarriers in order to transmit more data when the channel conditions<br>
allow. A receiver, knowing the sequence and time interval, utilizes this<br>
information in demodulating/decoding the non-pilot broadcasts, which<br>
preferably occur on different spreading codes than the pilot. Thus in the<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention a pilot stream (comprising a<br>
known symbol pattern) enters spreader 304, where it is appropriately spread<br>
utilizing a code from the 8 orthogonal codes. The pilot chip stream is then<br>
summed with each data chip stream via summers 303. It should be noted that<br>
data for more than one data stream may be summed at summers 303. In other<br>
words data for each user transmitted during the particular frequency/time period<br>
will have chips of multiple spreading codes summed at summers 303. The<br>
resulting summed chip stream is output to time shifter 305.<br>
As discussed above, time shifter 305 shifts specific chip streams on the<br>
different subcarriers (frequencies) in time allowing for more frequent sampling<br>
of the channel. Particularly, adjacent channels have a beginning symbol period<br>
(e.g., beginning of each Walsh code) staggered so that the beginning of one<br>
symbol period on a first subcarrier occurs during the transmission (preferably<br>
midway) of a second symbol period on a second subcarrier. All chip streams,<br>
whether time shifted or not, then enter OFDM modulator 306 where standard<br>
OFDM modulation occurs.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flow chart showing operation of the transmitter of FIG. 5 in<br>
accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention. The logic<br>
flow begins at step 401 where a data stream from/for a user is de-multiplexed<br>
into a plurality of data streams. At step 403 each data stream is spread with a<br>
particular Walsh code and summed with a spread pilot code (step 405). The<br>
summed chip streams enter time shifter 305 where they are appropriately time<br>
shifted depending upon the subcarrier they are to be transmitted on (step 407).<br>
Finally at step 409 OFDM modulation and transmission occurs.<br>
The above text described a system in which transmissions on different<br>
subcarriers were time shifted by a predetermined number of chips. This results<br>
in time-spread symbols being staggered (time-offset) on different subcarriers<br>
allowing for more frequent sampling of the channel in the time dimension, such<br>
that better estimates of the time-varying channel are obtained.<br>
In an alternate embodiment of the present invention, spreading is<br>
performed in the frequency dimension rather than (or in combination with) the<br>
time dimension. In this embodiment, channel variation occurs over the<br>
subcarriers due to mutilpath delay spread, resulting in a loss of orthogonality<br>
between pilot and data spreading codes and difficulty in estimating the channel<br>
variations over the subcarriers. The staggered spreading approach of the present<br>
invention is applied in the frequency dimension to improve the performance of a<br>
system with spreading in the frequency dimension, as is shown in FIG. 7.<br>
As shown in FIG. 7, during a first time period, a first chip of each<br>
symbol is transmitted on a first predetermined set of subcarriers (frequencies).<br>
During a second time period the first chip of each symbol is transmitted on a<br>
second predetermined set of subcarriers, where the second predetermined set of<br>
subcarriers differs from the first predetermined set of subcarriers. For a<br>
particular user, a first chip of a spread symbol is mapped to a predetermined<br>
subcarrier during a first transmission interval, and then mapped to a second<br>
subcarrier during a second transmission interval. In the preferred embodiment<br>
of the present invention the spread symbol is mapped to subcarriers k to k+SF-1<br>
during the first transmission interval, and to m to m+SF-1 during the second<br>
transmission interval. Also note in FIG. 7 that multiple data symbol or<br>
spreading block periods can be represented in a single time interval (e.g., b = 1<br>
and b = 2), since the chips of a spreading block do not need to span multiple<br>
time periods with frequency-dimension spreading.<br>
FIG. 8 is a block diagram of transmitter 600 in a spread OFDM<br>
communication system in accordance with an alternate embodiment of the<br>
present invention. As is evident, transmitter 600 is similar to transmitter 300<br>
except that time shifter 305 has been replaced by frequency/subcarrier mapper<br>
605. Operation of transmitter 600 occurs as described above with reference to<br>
FIG. 5 except that the summed chip streams exiting summers 603 enter mapper<br>
605 where they are mapped to different subcarriers as described above. In<br>
particular, for a first transmission interval, mapper 605 maps a first chip of a<br>
spread symbol to a predetermined subcarrier, and for a second transmission<br>
interval, mapper 605 maps the first chip of a spread symbol to a second<br>
subcarrier, wherein the second subcarrier differs from the first subcarrier.<br>
It should noted that in both FIG. 4 and FIG. 7 there exists<br>
frequency/chip locations that remain empty due to the staggering of<br>
transmissions. These need not remain empty.. For example, one could use these<br>
spaces to transmit user data or control information (with or without a code<br>
multiplexed pilot) spread with a smaller spreading factor, or use a similar-length<br>
spreading factor and span multiple gaps with the user's data (with or without a<br>
code multiplexed pilot), or to simply transmit additional pilot chips and/or pilot<br>
symbols that will further aid channel estimation at the receiver.<br>
Additionally, variations of FIG. 4 and FIG. 7 in terms of the spreading<br>
and the mapping of the spread symbols to the subcarrier / OFDM symbol grid<br>
are possible. In one alternate embodiment, the data symbols and pilot symbol(s)<br>
may be spread with differing spreading factors, preferably based on Orthogonal<br>
Variable Spreading Factor (OVSF) codes. For example in FIG. 4 the pilot chip<br>
stream could have a spreading factor of SF pilot = 8, while the data could have<br>
a spreading factor of SFdata = 16. In this case a single spread data block of<br>
length 16 (as can be obtained by concatenating two of the SF=8 spreading<br>
blocks such as b = 1 and b - 2 in FIG. 4) would contain two spread pilot<br>
symbols, each with SF_pilot = 8, such that the receive processing for the pilot<br>
channel is substantially similar to the preferred embodiment with reference to<br>
FIG. 4. Therefore, this embodiment provides additional flexibility in selecting<br>
or even dynamically adjusting the spreading factor used for data. However, for<br>
this example note that the use of SF_pilot = 8 blocks the use of 2 out of the 16<br>
codes from the data channel, as is known in the art for OVSF codes. In an<br>
additional example of this alternate embodiment, the spread data with a<br>
spreading factor of 16 can be mapped onto two different subcarriers to provide<br>
two-dimensional spreading on the data, which is known in the art to provide<br>
additional frequency diversity. In this example, 8 chips of a 16 chip spreading<br>
block can be mapped to subcarrier k = 1 for spreading block interval b = 1, and<br>
the remaining 8 chips can be mapped to a different subcarrier (e.g., k = 2 for<br>
spreading block interval b = 1, k = 3 for spreading block b = 1or b = 2, or<br>
various other predetermined combinations).<br>
FIG. 9 is a flow chart showing operation of the transmitter of FIG. 8 in<br>
accordance with the alternate embodiment of the present invention. The logic<br>
flow begins at step 701 where a data stream from/for a user is demultiplexed<br>
into a plurality of data streams. At step 703 each data stream is spread with a<br>
particular Walsh code and summed with a spread pilot code (step 705). The<br>
summed chip streams enter frequency mapper 605 where they are appropriately<br>
mapped to a particular subcarrier (step 707). Finally at step 709 OFDM<br>
modulation and transmission occurs. As described above, during a first<br>
transmission period all symbols to be transmitted have their first chip<br>
transmitted on a first predetermined set of subcarriers. During the next time<br>
period (chip period) all symbols to be transmitted have their first chip<br>
transmitted on a second predetermined set of subcarriers. In the alternate<br>
embodiment of the present invention the first and the second set of subcarriers<br>
are mutually exclusive.<br>
By utilizing the above described transmission schemes, a receiver is<br>
allowed more frequent sampling of the channel. During reception, a baseline<br>
channel estimate is preferably obtained per spreading block by despreading the<br>
received signal by the pilot's Walsh code. The received signal can be modeled<br>
as:<br>
where h(b,n,k) is the channel, and n(b,n,k) is thermal noise and/or other<br>
noise and interference at the bth block, nth OFDM symbol, Kth subcarrier. The<br>
pilot channel is preferably despread by multiplying the received signal by the<br>
conjugate of the pilot's Walsh code times the scrambling code, and summing<br>
the elements; it is then preferably demodulated by dividing out the gain and<br>
pilot symbol:<br>
This despread channel estimate is the sum of three terms, one due to the<br>
constant part of the channel, one due to thermal noise, and one due to inter-code<br>
interference (ICI) from the data users arising from channel variation over the<br>
spreading block; in particular,<br>
is the despread noise contribution and n"(b,k) is the term due to ICI<br>
To improve the channel estimation, the baseline channel estimates<br>
h(b,k), available once per spreading block and subcarrier, are combined to take<br>
advantage of any correlation that exists across subcarriers, and to -obtain per-<br>
chip channel estimates within the spreading block. The filtering and<br>
interpolation are now described. The combined channel estimate, ha,filt(l,k) is<br>
the final estimated channel at the Kth subcarrier of the' lth OFDM- symbol,<br>
indexed by absolute symbol index l= 1,2,3,..., ha,filt(l,k) are obtained by<br>
interpolating and filtering the spread block channel estimates, ha,filt(b,k), as<br>
detailed below. In one embodiment, the channel estimate is held constant over<br>
the spread block and frequency filtering is applied. In another embodiment, the<br>
chip-level channel estimates are obtained by interpolating the spread block<br>
channel estimates.<br>
The channel estimates are first held constant for SO OFDM symbols,<br>
where SO is the "stagger offset", and the "stagger period" is defined<br>
The special case of no staggering is obtained by setting SO = SF, and SP =<br>
1.The held channel estimates ha,filt(l,k) indexed by absolute time are "filled in"<br>
(i.e., sampled and held) with the despread pilots,<br>
gives the block index for symbol / and subcarrier k. Note for a given OFDM<br>
symbol l, different subcarriers come from possibly different spreading blocks in<br>
the case of staggered spreading.<br>
In the case of interpolation in the time dimension, for example linear<br>
interpolation, the held channel estimates may be combined to obtain channel<br>
estimates that vary with the chip index:<br>
This procedure is illustrated in FIG. 10.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention ha,filt(l,k) (or<br>
ha,filt(l,k) interpolated channel estimates) is then filtered across subcarriers<br>
for each OFDM symbol /. The filtering can be implemented in several ways.<br>
One way is to take an IFFT, and apply a multiplicative window to the time-<br>
domain channel to zero-out the portions corresponding to delay spreads larger<br>
than a maximum expected delay spread. Then the channel is obtained by taking<br>
an FFT. Another approach to the filtering is in the frequency domain directly. In<br>
either case, the channel is mathematically obtained via applying a low pass filter<br>
to all subcarriers,<br>
where g(k,k1),1 
subcarrier. Note, some of the g(k,k1) may be zero.<br>
The estimated channel at the nth chip of the bth spread block and kth<br>
subcarrier is then given by ha,filt(l,k) at the appropriate time and frequency<br>
index; specifically, with no staggering<br>
h(b,,n,k) = ha,filt(l,k) with l = (b-1)-SF + n<br>
For the case of staggered spreading blocks,<br>
h(b,n,k) = ha,filt(l,k) with l = (b-1).SF + n+SO-mod (k-1,SP)<br>
The received signal is equalized, scrambling code removed and despread<br>
to obtain an estimate of the transmitted data symbols, d1(b,k). Let f (b,n,k)be<br>
equalizer coefficient at the nth chip of the bth spread block and Kth subcarrier.<br>
The estimate of the transmitted data symbol modulated on the i'h Walsh code is<br>
then obtained by the following equation,<br>
The equalizer coefficient can be chosen according to different criteria<br>
such as EGC (Equal-gain chip combing) or MMSE criterion,<br>
where s2n is the variance of ? (b,n,k) and s2n is the variance of x(b,n,k). If<br>
frequency-selective interference is present, then s2n/s2x can be replaced with<br>
t/SINR(b,n,k), where SINR is the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio. A<br>
gain correction term is further applied to the linear MMSE equalizer.<br>
FIG. 11 is a block diagram of receiver 900 in accordance with the<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown, receiver 900<br>
comprises receiver/demodulator 901, buffer 902, despreader 903 channel<br>
estimator 904, chip-level interpolator 905, and multiplexer 906. During<br>
operation, demodulator 901 receives multiple subcarriers (multicarrier signal)<br>
and demodulates them producing a plurality of chip streams. The chip streams<br>
are passed to buffer 902 where they are stored. Buffer 902 stores the<br>
demodulated chip stream for a predetermined time while channel estimation<br>
takes place. For each chip stream, channel estimator 904 accesses buffer 902<br>
and despreads the chip stream with a pilot code during a first symbol period<br>
(i.e., a first SF chips) to produce a first channel estimate for the first symbol<br>
period. In a similar manner, channel estimator 904 despreads the chip steam<br>
with the pilot code during a second symbol period to produce a second channel<br>
estimate for the second symbol period. The channel estimates are passed to<br>
chip-level interpolator 905 where a third channel estimate is generated. As<br>
described above with reference to FIG. 11, the third channel estimate is<br>
generated only for a portion of the first symbol period (i.e., a portion less than.<br>
SF chips), and is based on the first and the second channel estimates. In a<br>
similar manner, a fourth channel estimate is generated of a second portion of the<br>
first symbol period based on the first and the second channel estimates. The<br>
channel estimates are passed to despreader 903 where they are utilized in<br>
despreading the chip streams into multiple data streams. Multiplexer 906 then<br>
recombines the data streams.<br>
In summary, unlike prior-art channel estimation for multicarrier systems,<br>
in the preferred embodiment of the present invention per-chip channel estimates<br>
are obtained from de-spread, code-multiplexed pilots, and these estimates can<br>
follow the channel variation within a single spreading block even though the<br>
despread pilot provides only a single channel estimate per spreading block. As a<br>
result, each chip within a symbol potentially has a varying channel estimate,<br>
greatly improving channel tracking and despreader performance for higher<br>
dopplers, and enabling the use of a code multiplexed pilot for a larger range of<br>
potential system parameters. FIG. 12 is a flow chart showing channel<br>
estimation in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The logic flow begins at step 1001 where a multicarrier signal is<br>
received comprising a plurality of subcarriers. In the preferred embodiment of<br>
the present invention the received signal comprises a multicarrier signal having<br>
relatively time-shifted chip streams existing on at least two subcarriers. The<br>
received signal is demodulated to produce a plurality of chip streams (step<br>
1003). At step 1005 the chip stream is despread with a pilot code during a first<br>
symbol period to produce a first channel estimate for the first symbol period,<br>
and at step 1007 the chip steam is despread with the pilot code during a second<br>
symbol period to produce a second channel estimate for the second symbol<br>
period. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention the first and the<br>
second symbol periods are non-overlapping in time and in the alternate<br>
embodiment of the present invention the first and the second symbol periods are<br>
non-overlapping in frequency.<br>
Continuing, at step 1009 a third channel estimate is produced for a<br>
portion of the first symbol period based on the first and the second channel<br>
estimates, and at step 1011 a fourth channel estimate is generated for a second<br>
portion of the first symbol period based on the first and the second channel<br>
estimates.<br>
While the invention has been particularly shown and described with<br>
reference to a particular embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the<br>
art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, although the<br>
above description was given primarily involving OFDM modulation, one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other multicarrier modulation<br>
techniques may be Utilized as well. Additionally, although the embodiments<br>
described above deal with time and frequency spreading separately, one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art will recognize that a combination of both simultaneous<br>
time and frequency spreading as described above may be utilized as well. It is<br>
intended that such changes come within the scope of the following claims.<br>
