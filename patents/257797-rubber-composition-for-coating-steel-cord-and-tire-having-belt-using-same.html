RUBBER COMPOSITION FOR COATING STEEL CORD AND<br>
TIRE HAVING BELT USING SAME<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a rubber composition for<br>
coating a steel cord and a tire having a belt using the rubber<br>
composition.<br>
Generally, since a heavy load is applied to tires for an<br>
automobile, a steel cord is used as a reinforcing material. Particularly<br>
during running, if a rubber and a steel cord are peeled off due to heat<br>
generation of tires, crucial breakdown is caused on the tires.<br>
Conventionally, carbon black is mainly used as a reinforcing<br>
filler for a rubber composition for coating a steel cord. However, in<br>
recent years, there are increasing interests in environmental<br>
preservation on the earth and automobiles are not exceptional, thus,<br>
regulations for suppressing CO2 emission are reinforced. Further,<br>
since petroleum resources are limited and supply thereof has been<br>
decreasing year by year, oil prices are expected to increase in the<br>
future, and consequently, there is limitation on uses of materials<br>
derived from petroleum resources such as carbon black. In view of<br>
such a background, JP-A-2003-64222 discloses a means, wherein<br>
silica is used in tire parts. However, when silica is used, there is a<br>
problem that a Mooney viscosity of a rubber composition is increased,<br>
and processability of the rubber composition is deteriorated. In order<br>
to solve these problems, a means for lowering rolling resistance and<br>
improving processability is known, wherein specific silica is<br>
compounded to a rubber composition for coating a steel cord. When<br><br>
such specific silica which dose not lower processability is used, there is<br>
a problem that sufficient reinforcing property cannot be obtained.<br>
Accordingly, in order to enhance reinforcing property, a<br>
method of reinforcing a rubber by a reaction of a silanol group of a<br>
silica surface with an ethoxy group of a coupling agent by using silica<br>
and a coupling agent is known. In this case, in order to accelerate<br>
this reaction during kneading, it is necessary to increase a kneading<br>
temperature to 140°C or more. However, only by this, the reaction of<br>
a silanol group of a silica surface with an ethoxy group of a coupling<br>
agent does not proceed during kneading of a base rubber, and this<br>
reaction proceeds during a topping step where a steel cord is coated<br>
with a rubber composition, resulting in accumulation of generated<br>
ethanol in the coated rubber composition and thus a so-called blister<br>
phenomenon is generated. If this phenomenon occurs, there arise<br>
problems that necessity of decreasing a line speed during the topping<br>
step occurs, and a rubber thickness of a blistering portion becomes<br>
non-uniform, thus deteriorating adhesion between the steel cord of<br>
that portion and the rubber. In addition, an unreacted silane<br>
coupling agent reacts with a metal oxide layer of a roll, thereby causing<br>
a phenomenon that the rubber is not peeled off from the roll, which<br>
results in a problem that productivity is lowered.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a rubber<br>
composition for coating a steel cord, use of which makes it possible to<br>
consider an effect on environment, prepare for the future decrease in<br>
supply of petroleum resources and suppress generation of bubbles,<br><br>
reduce rolling resistance, and improve processability, roll workability,<br>
adhesion to a steel cord and durability with favorable balance, as<br>
compared with a rubber composition for coating a steel cord<br>
comprising raw materials derived from petroleum resources as main<br>
component, and to provide a tire having a belt prepared by using the<br>
rubber composition.<br>
The present invention relates to a rubber composition for<br>
coating a steel cord comprising 40 to 80 parts by weight of silica<br>
having a nitrogen adsorbing-specific surface area of 100 to 200 m2/g, 1<br>
to 15 parts by weight of a silane coupling agent and 0.5 to 3 parts by<br>
weight of potassium borate, on the basis of 100 parts by weight of a<br>
diene rubber component.<br>
It is preferable that the rubber composition for coating a steel<br>
cord further comprises 10 to 20 parts by weight of zinc oxide, 3.5 to 6<br>
parts by weight of sulfur and 0.5 to 2 parts by weight of organic cobalt,<br>
on the basis of 100 parts by weight of a diene rubber component.<br>
It is preferable that the silane coupling agent is represented<br>
by the following general formula:<br><br>
wherein R is a linear or branched alkyl group having 1 to 8 carbon<br>
atoms, x is an integer of 1 to 8, n represents the number of sulfur<br>
atoms in a poly sulfide part, and an average value of n is 2 to 3,<br>
and an amount of the silane coupling agent having two sulfur atoms in<br>
the polysulfide part is not less than 60 % by weight in the whole silane<br>
coupling agent.<br><br>
In the rubber composition for coating a steel cord, a<br>
kneading temperature of a base rubber is preferably 140°C to 160°C.<br>
The present invention further relates to a tire having a belt<br>
prepared by using the rubber composition for coating a steel cord.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
Fig. 1 is a partial perspective view showing a structure of the<br>
belt for a tire prepared using the rubber composition for coating a steel<br>
cord of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The rubber composition for coating a steel cord of the<br>
present invention comprises a diene rubber component, silica, a silane<br>
coupling agent and potassium borate.<br>
Fig. 1 is a partial perspective view showing a structure of the<br>
belt for a tire prepared using the rubber composition for coating a steel<br>
cord of the present invention.<br>
In the embodiment, the belt is used for a radial tire and fills<br>
the role of enhancing rigidity of a tread by tightening a carcass of<br>
radial structure strongly and functions to improve steering stability<br>
and abrasion resistance. The belt has a large tension generated by a<br>
pneumatic pressure of a tire, and functions to inhibit a large distortion<br>
from being generated during rolling between the belt and another<br>
neighboring belt crossing at an angle.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, a belt 1 is composed of a cord 2 and a<br>
rubber layer 3 coated on the cord 2. For example, a cord giving small<br>
elongation and having high rigidity such as a steel cord is suitably<br><br>
used as the cord 2. In Fig. 1, two layers of belt 1 are so overlapped<br>
that the cords 2 are crossing with each other.<br>
Generally two layers of belt 1 are considered to be an<br>
integrated composite article comprising the cords 2 and the rubber<br>
layers 3, and a shearing strain is generated between the two belt layers.<br>
The rubber layers 3 function to absorb this shearing strain by<br>
deformation of the rubber layers.<br>
The above-mentioned belt 1 is only an example of the present<br>
invention, and various alterations can be applied according to Claims<br>
disclosed herein.<br>
The diene rubber component is not particularly limited, and<br>
examples of the rubber components are a natural rubber (NR), an<br>
epoxidized natural rubber (ENR), a styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), a<br>
butadiene rubber (BR) and an isoprene rubber (IR). Among these,<br>
from the viewpoint of considering an effect on environment and<br>
preparing for the future decrease in supply of petroleum resources, NR<br>
or ENR is preferable, and NR is more preferable.<br>
NR is not particularly limited, and NR conventionally used in<br>
the tire industries such as TSR20 and RSS#3 can be used.<br>
Silica is not particularly limited, and silica prepared by a wet<br>
method or a dry method can be used.<br>
A nitrogen adsorbing-specific surface area (hereinafter<br>
referred to as BET) of silica is not less than 100 m2/g, preferably not<br>
less than 110 m2/g. When BET of silica is less than 100 m2/g, an<br>
effect of improving reinforcing property by compounding silica is not<br>
sufficient and belt edge durability is lowered. Further, BET of silica is<br>
not more than 200 m2/g, preferably not more than 180 m2/g. When<br><br>
BET of silica is more than 200 m2/g, processability is deteriorated.<br>
BET of silica can be measured in accordance with ASTM-D-4820-93.<br>
An amount of silica is not less than 40 parts by weight,<br>
preferably not less than 50 parts by weight based on 100 parts by<br>
weight of the diene rubber component. When the amount of silica is<br>
less than 40 parts by weight, a reinforcing effect of the rubber is poor<br>
and belt edge durability is deteriorated. Further, the amount of silica<br>
is not more than 80 parts by weight, preferably not more than 70 parts<br>
by weight. When the amount of silica is more than 80 parts by weight,<br>
Mooney viscosity is raised and processability is deteriorated.<br>
In the present invention, it is preferable that the silane<br>
coupling agent is one represented by the following formula:<br><br>
wherein R is a linear or branched alkyl group having 1 to 8 carbon<br>
atoms, x is an integer of 1 to 8, n represents the number of sulfur<br>
atoms in a polysulfide part, and an average value of n is 2 to 3,<br>
and an amount of the silane coupling agent having two sulfur atoms in<br>
the polysulfide part is not less than 60 % by weight in the whole silane<br>
coupling agent.<br>
In the formula, R is preferably a linear or branched alkyl<br>
group, more preferably a linear alkyl group.<br>
The number of carbon atoms in R is preferably 1 to 8, more<br>
preferably 2 to 7. When the number of carbon atoms in R is 0, an<br>
alkoxy group does not exist, and bonding property between the silica<br>
and the silane coupling agent tends to be impaired, and when it is<br><br>
more than 8, affinity between the silica and the silane coupling agent<br>
tends to be impaired.<br>
x is preferably 1 to 8, more preferably 2 to 7. When x is 0,<br>
such a silane coupling agent is chemically unstable, and<br>
decomposition and deterioration of the silane coupling agent in the<br>
rubber composition tends to be promoted. When x is more than 8, an<br>
amount of the silane coupling agent necessary to obtain a sufficient<br>
reinforcing effect tends to excessively increase.<br>
n represents the number of sulfur atoms in the polysulfide<br>
part. Herein, an average value of n is preferably 2 to 3. When the<br>
average value of n is less than 2, a decomposing temperature of the<br>
silane coupling agent is high, thus, it becomes possible to knead at a<br>
higher temperature, but a vulcanization speed tends to be fast. When<br>
the average value of n is more than 3, a decomposing temperature of<br>
the silane coupling agent is lowered, thus, decomposition easily occurs<br>
during kneading and sulfur atoms are released, and consequently a<br>
problem of generating rubber scorch during kneading tends to be<br>
easily caused.<br>
Examples of a silane coupling agent satisfying the mentioned<br>
requirements are<br>
bis(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)disulfide, bis(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)trisulfide,<br>
bis(2-triethoxysilylethyl)disulfide, bis(2-triethoxysilylethyl)trisulfide,<br>
bis(3-trimethoxysilylpropyl)disulfide,<br>
bis(3-trimethoxysilylpropyl)trisulfide,<br>
bis(2-trimethoxysilylethyl)disulfide, bis(2-trimethoxysilylethyl)trisulfide,<br>
bis(4-triethoxysilylbutyl)disulfide, bis(4-triethoxysilylbutyl)trisulfide,<br>
bis(4-trimethoxysilylbutyl)disulfide,	and<br><br>
bis(4-trimethoxysilylbutyl)trisulfide, and these silane coupling agents<br>
can be used alone, or at least 2 kinds thereof may be used in<br>
combination.<br>
Further, an amount of the silane coupling agent having two<br>
sulfur atoms in the polysulfide part is preferably not less than 60 % by<br>
weight in the whole silane coupling agent. When the amount of the<br>
silane coupling agent having two sulfur atoms in the polysulfide part is<br>
less than 60 % by weight, if a kneading temperature of the base rubber<br>
is set at 140°C to 160°C, sulfur atoms of the silane coupling agent tend<br>
to be easily released, vulcanization tends to be promoted during<br>
kneading, and consequently processability tends to be deteriorated.<br>
Particularly, an amount of the silane coupling agent having two sulfur<br>
atoms is most preferably 100 % by weight in the whole silane coupling<br>
agent.<br>
An amount of the silane coupling agent is not less than 1<br>
part by weight, preferably not less than 2 parts by weight based on 100<br>
parts by weight of the diene rubber component. When the amount of<br>
the silane coupling agent is less than 1 part by weight, a sufficient<br>
reinforcing effect of the rubber composition cannot be obtained,<br>
Mooney viscosity is raised and processability is deteriorated. Further<br>
the amount of the silane coupling agent is not more than 15 parts by<br>
weight, preferably not more than 12 parts by weight. When the<br>
amount of the silane coupling agent is more than 15 parts by weight,<br>
physical properties of the rubber composition and processability are<br>
not improved, and a cost of the rubber composition is increased since<br>
the silane coupling agent is an expensive material.<br>
Potassium borate used in the present invention is not<br><br>
particularly limited, and examples thereof are potassium tetraborate<br>
(K2B4O7), potassium metaborate (KBO2), potassium pentaborate<br>
(KB5O8), potassium hexaborate (K2B6O10), and potassium octaborate<br>
(K2B8O13), and potassium tetraborate is preferable.<br>
An amount of potassium borate is not less than 0.5 part by<br>
weight on the basis of 100 parts by weight of the diene rubber<br>
component. When the amount of potassium borate is less than 0.5<br>
part by weight, suppression of blistering during a topping process is<br>
not enough, productivity is deteriorated, and adhesion to a steel cord is<br>
deteriorated. Further, the amount of potassium borate is not more<br>
than 3 parts by weight, preferably not more than 2 parts by weight.<br>
When the amount of potassium borate is more than 3 parts by weight,<br>
an effect of suppression of blistering becomes saturated, and adhesion<br>
to a steel cord and belt edge durability are lowered.<br>
When potassium borate is compounded in an amount of 0.5<br>
to 2 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the diene rubber<br>
component, by accelerating the reaction of the ethoxy group of the<br>
silane coupling agent with the silanol group of the silica surface at the<br>
kneading stage, a reaction efficiency of the silane coupling agent can<br>
be enhanced, and therefore ethanol which is generated by a reaction of<br>
the unreacted ethoxy group with the silanol group and causes<br>
blistering is not generated, thereby inhibiting generation of blistering.<br>
It is preferable that the rubber composition for coating a steel<br>
cord of the present invention further comprises zinc oxide, sulfur and<br>
organic cobalt to improve adhesion to a steel cord.<br>
Zinc oxide is not particularly limited, and zinc oxide<br>
conventionally used in the rubber industries may be used.<br><br>
An amount of zinc oxide is preferably not less than 10 parts<br>
by weight, more preferably not less than 13 parts by weight based on<br>
100 parts by weight of the diene rubber component. When the<br>
amount of zinc oxide is less than 10 parts by weight, adhesion of the<br>
rubber to a steel cord tends to be lowered, and belt edge durability<br>
tends to be deteriorated. Further, the amount of zinc oxide is<br>
preferably not more than 20 parts by weight, more preferably not more<br>
than 18 parts by weight. When the amount of zinc oxide is more than<br>
20 parts by weight, dispersibility of zinc oxide tends to be lowered, and<br>
belt edge durability tends to be deteriorated like the case of the amount<br>
of zinc oxide being less than 10 parts by weight.<br>
Sulfur usable in the present invention is preferably insoluble<br>
sulfur from the viewpoint that blooming of sulfur on the rubber surface<br>
is inhibited, adhesion of the rubber composition is improved, and<br>
adhesion failure at a belt edge part during preparation of a tire can be<br>
suppressed, and specific examples of insoluble sulfur are CRYSTEX<br>
HSOT20 available from Flexsys Co., and Sanfel EX available from<br>
SANSHIN CHEMICAL INDUSTRY CO., LTD.<br>
An amount of sulfur is preferably not less than 3.5 parts by<br>
weight, more preferably not less than 4 parts by weight based on 100<br>
parts by weight of the diene rubber component. When the amount of<br>
sulfur is less than 3.5 parts by weight, adhesion strength tends to be<br>
lowered, and durability tends to be inferior. Further, the amount of<br>
sulfur is preferably not more than 6 parts by weight, more preferably<br>
not more than 5.5 parts by weight. When the amount of sulfur is<br>
more than 6 parts by weight, thermal degradation resistance of the<br>
rubber is deteriorated, and further, since blooming that is a<br><br>
phenomenon of precipitation of insoluble sulfur on the rubber surface<br>
which is not dissolved in the rubber is easily generated due to<br>
compounding of a large amount of sulfur, strict temperature control is<br>
required during kneading of the rubber compounded with silica in<br>
which Mooney viscosity is easily increased, and productivity tends to<br>
be lowered. When insoluble sulfur is compounded as sulfur, an<br>
amount of sulfur indicates an amount of sulfur excluding an oil<br>
content in the insoluble sulfur.<br>
It is preferable that the rubber composition for coating a steel<br>
cord further comprises organic cobalt, and the number of carbon<br>
atoms in the organic cobalt is preferably not less than 4, more<br>
preferably not less than 11 for the reason that a cobalt salt can control<br>
the reaction of a brass-plated layer of a steel cord with sulfur in the<br>
rubber. Further, the number of carbon atoms in the organic cobalt is<br>
preferably not more than 18.<br>
Examples of the organic cobalt usable in the present<br>
invention are cobalt naphthenate, cobalt stearate, cobalt oleate and<br>
cobalt maleate, and these organic cobalts may be used alone, or at<br>
least two kinds thereof may be used in combination. From the<br>
viewpoint of suppressing deterioration of the rubber molecule caused<br>
by oxidation, cobalt stearate is preferable.<br>
An amount of organic cobalt is preferably not less than 0.5<br>
part by weight on the basis of 100 parts by weight of the diene rubber<br>
component. When the amount of organic cobalt is less than 0.5 part<br>
by weight, adhesion of a steel cord to the rubber tends to be<br>
deteriorated. Further, the amount of organic cobalt is preferably not<br>
more than 2 parts by weight. When the amount of organic cobalt is<br><br>
more than 2 parts by weight, molecules of the rubber are subject to<br>
deterioration by oxidation due to oxidizing action of the organic cobalt<br>
and there is a tendency that reinforcing property of the vulcanized<br>
rubber is lowered and reactivity of a brass-plated layer of the steel cord<br>
with sulfur in the rubber is lowered, thereby deteriorating adhesion.<br>
In the present invention, not only reinforcing property of the<br>
rubber can be improved by compounding specific silica, and<br>
deterioration of processability caused by compounding silica can be<br>
suppressed by compounding a silane coupling agent, but also<br>
reactivity of the silane coupling agent can be promoted by<br>
compounding potassium borate, blistering can be suppressed during<br>
the topping process, and roll workability can be improved.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to consider an<br>
effect on environment and prepare for the future decrease in supply of<br>
petroleum resources by using resources other than petroleum oil as<br>
the main component of the rubber composition for coating a steel cord.<br>
Therefore, it is preferable not to use carbon black, resin derived from<br>
petroleum resources and process oil.<br>
The rubber composition for coating a steel cord of the<br>
present invention can be suitably compounded of compounding agents<br>
used in the rubber industry, for example, various antioxidants and<br>
various vulcanization accelerators according to the necessity in<br>
addition to the above-described diene rubber component, silica, silane<br>
coupling agent, potassium borate, zinc oxide, sulfur and organic<br>
cobalt.<br>
The rubber composition for coating a steel cord of the<br>
present invention is prepared by general processes. Namely, the<br><br>
rubber composition for coating a steel cord of the present invention<br>
can be prepared by kneading the above-described diene rubber<br>
component, silica, silane coupling agent, potassium borate, and the<br>
above-described compounding agents according to the necessity by, for<br>
example, a Banbury mixer, a kneader, or an open roll, and then<br>
vulcanizing the rubber composition.<br>
In preparing the rubber composition for coating a steel cord<br>
of the present invention, a kneading temperature of the base rubber is<br>
preferably 140°C to 160°C. When the kneading temperature of the<br>
base rubber is less than 140°C, a reaction of the rubber, silica and the<br>
silane coupling agent does not proceed effectively, and there is a<br>
tendency that rolling resistance is not reduced, and the rubber<br>
composition having excellent adhesion and durability cannot be<br>
obtained. When the kneading temperature is more than 160°C, sulfur<br>
atoms are easily released from the silane coupling agent, vulcanization<br>
starts during kneading, and consequently processability tends to be<br>
deteriorated.<br>
In the present invention, the kneading temperature of the<br>
base rubber means a temperature during kneading of the diene rubber<br>
and chemicals excluding sulfur and vulcanization accelerator by using<br>
a Banbury mixer or the like.<br>
It is preferable that the rubber composition for coating a steel<br>
cord of the present invention is used for a carcass or a belt by coating<br>
a steel cord with the composition, and more preferably for a belt for the<br>
reason that adhesion strength between the rubber and the steel cord is<br>
excellent.<br>
When using for a belt, after forming a belt by coating the<br><br>
steel cord with the rubber composition for coating a steel cord of the<br>
present invention, the belt is laminated with other tire members to<br>
form an unvulcanized tire which is then vulcanized and thus a<br>
pneumatic tire (radial tire, etc.) can be obtained. The belt is used for a<br>
radial tire, and functions to strongly tighten a carcass and enhance<br>
rigidity of a tread. The belt has a large tension generated by a<br>
pneumatic pressure of a tire, and functions to inhibit a large distortion<br>
from being generated during rolling between the belt and another<br>
neighboring belt crossing at an angle.<br>
The tire of the present invention can be prepared by general<br>
processes, using the rubber composition for coating a steel cord of the<br>
preset invention. Namely a steel cord is coated with the rubber<br>
composition for coating a steel cord of the present invention in an<br>
unvulcanized state which is compounded with the above-described<br>
compounding agents according to the necessity, and is molded into the<br>
form of, for example, a belt, then the belt is laminated with other tire<br>
members on a tire molding machine to prepare an unvulcanized tire.<br>
The tire of the present invention can be obtained by heating and<br>
pressuring this unvulcanized tire in a vulcanizer.<br>
As described above, by using the rubber composition for<br>
coating a steel cord of the present invention, the tire of the present<br>
invention can be provided as an ecological tire which makes it possible<br>
to consider effects on environment and prepare for the future decrease<br>
in the petroleum supply.<br>

EXAMPLES 1 to 9 and COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES 1 to 4<br>
According to the compounding prescriptions shown in Table<br>
1, chemicals other than sulfur and a vulcanization accelerator were<br>
kneaded for 6 minutes at 150°C (a kneading temperature of the base<br>
rubber), using a Banbury mixer manufactured by Kobe Steel, Ltd., to<br>
obtain a kneaded product. Then, the sulfur and vulcanization<br>
accelerator were added to the obtained kneaded product and kneaded<br>
for 5 minutes at 98°C, using an open roll, to obtain an unvulcanized<br>
rubber composition. Further, the obtained unvulcanized rubber<br>
composition was press-vulcanized for 14 minutes at 170°C to obtain<br>
vulcanized rubber compositions of Examples 1 to 9 and Comparative<br>
Examples 1 and 4.<br>
(Processability)<br>
A test piece having a specified size is prepared from the<br>
above-described unvulcanized rubber composition, and according to<br>
JIS K 6300 "Test Method of Unvulcanized Rubbers", by using a Mooney<br>
viscosity tester, a small rotor is rotated under the temperature<br>
condition of 130°C heated by preheating for 1 minute to measure a<br>
Mooney viscosity (ML1+4, 130°C) of the unvulcanized rubber<br>
composition after a lapse of 4 minutes. Further, a Mooney viscosity of<br>
each composition is expressed as an index by the following calculation<br><br>
formula, assuming the Mooney viscosity index of Comparative Example<br>
1 as 100. The larger the Mooney viscosity index is, the smaller the<br>
Mooney viscosity is, which indicates processability is excellent.<br>
(Mooney viscosity index) = (Mooney viscosity of Comparative Example<br>
1) (Mooney viscosity of each composition) x 100<br>
(Roll workability)<br>
At the step of using the open roll in the above-mentioned<br>
preparation of the vulcanized rubber composition, roll workability is<br>
evaluated using two open rolls. A roll temperature is adjusted to<br>
70±3°C and 25±3°C, respectively. Concretely a rubber is kneaded<br>
with the open roll adjusted to 70±3°C, and after confirming that the<br>
rubber temperature has reached 70°C or more, kneading is carried out<br>
with the open roll adjusted to 25±3°C, and then adhesion of the rubber<br>
to the roll surface is evaluated by the following criteria.<br>
3: The rubber can be peeled off from the roll, and roll workability is<br>
excellent.<br>
2: The rubber can be peeled off from the roll, but work for peeling the<br>
rubber from the roll by hand is necessary, and roll workability is<br>
within an allowable range.<br>
1: The rubber adheres to the roll, and continuous work by means of<br>
the roll cannot be carried out. It is necessary to shut down the roll<br>
and peel off the rubber from the roll. Roll workability is poor.<br>
(Air-in test)<br>
A rubber test piece of 5 cm square x 1 cm thick is cut off<br>
from the above-mentioned vulcanized rubber composition and is left for<br><br>
one hour in an oven, a temperature of which is previously adjusted to<br>
130°C. Then the rubber test piece is taken out and the inside of the<br>
rubber test piece is observed to evaluate whether or not generation of<br>
air bubbles is present by the following criteria.<br>
5: No air bubbles are recognized.<br>
4: A few small air bubbles having a diameter of less than 1 mm can be<br>
confirmed.<br>
3: A few large air bubbles having a diameter of 1 mm or more can be<br>
confirmed.<br>
2: A lot of large air bubbles having a diameter of 1 mm or more are<br>
generated, and it can be seen that appearance of the test piece is<br>
inflating.<br>
1: A lot of air bubbles are connected to each other to form porosity.<br>
(Adhesion of cord)<br>
Twenty-two brass-plated steel cords are arranged at an<br>
interval of 25 mm and coated with the above-mentioned unvulcanized<br>
rubber composition, followed by press-vulcanization at 170°C for 14<br>
minutes to prepare a test piece. Then the rubber is peeled from the<br>
steel cord and the rubber coating on the steel cord is evaluated with<br>
naked eyes.<br>
5: The whole surface of the steel cord is covered with the rubber.<br>
4: There are a few parts where the steel cord is not covered with the<br>
rubber (within five parts in 22 steel cords).<br>
3: There are many parts where the steel cord is not covered with the<br>
rubber (within ten parts in 22 steel cords).<br>
2: Almost the whole surface of the steel cord is not covered with the<br>
rubber.<br><br>
1: There is no part where the steel cord is covered with the rubber.<br>
(Rolling resistance)<br>
A steel cord is coated with the obtained unvulcanized rubber<br>
composition and molded into a belt-like shape to prepare an<br>
unvulcanized belt, and the unvulcanized belt is laminated with other<br>
tire members on a tire molding machine and press-vulcanized at 170°C<br>
for 14 minutes to prepare tires for tests (tire size: 195/65R15, H<br>
range).<br>
Rolling resistance of the prepared test tire is measured by<br>
using a rolling resistance tester, and rolling resistance of each<br>
composition is expressed as an index by the following equation,<br>
assuming the rolling resistance index of Comparative Example 1 as<br>
100. The larger the rolling resistance index is, the more the rolling<br>
resistance is lowered, which indicates excellent.<br>
(Rolling resistance index) = (Rolling resistance of Comparative Example<br>
1) (Rolling resistance of each composition) x 100<br>
(Durability test)<br>
Into the prepared tire was injected a gas comprising 40 % of<br>
oxygen and 60 % of nitrogen, and the inside pressure of the tire is<br>
adjusted to 200 MPa. The tire is stored for aging in an oven set at a<br>
temperature of 60°C for three weeks. Under the condition of 100 %<br>
load according to JIS, the prepared tire is run 30,000 km on a drum<br>
(drum running) at a speed of 110 km/h. Then, the tire is cut off at 8<br>
points (cut sections) on the circumference of the tire, and a length of<br>
separation (separation length) generated at a belt edge and a<br><br>
neighboring belt edge on a cut section (concretely a length between the<br>
belt edge and the neighboring belt edge when the two layers of belts<br>
adhered to each other when a tire is prepared are separated due to<br>
aging) is measured. The lengths at the 8 points are summed, and the<br>
sum total of separation lengths of each composition is expressed as an<br>
index by the following calculation formula, assuming the belt edge<br>
durability index of Comparative Example 1 as 100. The larger the belt<br>
edge durability index is, the more excellent the durability is.<br>
(Belt edge durability index) = (The sum total of separation lengths of<br>
Comparative Example 1) ÷ (The sum total of separation lengths of each<br>
composition) x 100<br>
Results of the above tests are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<br><br><br><br><br>
Comparative Example 1 is a conventional rubber composition<br>
for coating a steel cord containing carbon black.<br>
In Comparative Examples 2 and 3, in which the amount of<br>
potassium borate is less than the specified amount, generation of<br>
bubbles cannot be suppressed, roll workability is not improved, and as<br>
a result productivity is inferior.<br>
In Comparative Example 4, in which the amount of<br>
potassium borate is more than the specified amount, adhesion to a<br><br>
steel cord is inferior, and belt edge durability is also inferior.<br>
On the other hand, since the rubber compositions of<br>
Examples 1 to 9 contain the specified amounts of silica, a silane<br>
coupling agent and potassium borate, generation of bubbles can be<br>
suppressed, rolling resistance can be reduced, and processability, roll<br>
workability, adhesion to a steel cord and durability can be improved<br>
with favorable balance.<br>
The present invention can provide a rubber composition for<br>
coating a steel cord, use of which makes it possible to consider an<br>
effect on environment, prepare for the future decrease in supply of<br>
petroleum resources, suppress generation of bubbles, reduce rolling<br>
resistance, and improve processability, roll workability, adhesion to a<br>
steel cord and durability with favorable balance, as compared with a<br>
rubber composition for coating a steel cord comprising raw materials<br>
derived from petroleum resources as main components, and can<br>
provide a tire having a belt prepared by using the composition since<br>
the rubber composition contains a diene rubber component, specific<br>
silica, a silane coupling agent and potassium borate in specified<br>
amounts.<br><br>
