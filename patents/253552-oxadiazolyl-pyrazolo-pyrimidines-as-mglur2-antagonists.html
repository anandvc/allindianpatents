The present invention relates to compounds of formula (I), a process for the manufacture thereof their use for the preparation of medicaments for treating CNS disorders and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
In particular, the present inven relates to compounds of general formula (I)<br>
wherein <br>

It has surprisingly been found that the compounds of general formula 1 are metabotropic giutamate receptor antagonists. Compounds of formula 1 are distinguished by valuable therapeutic properties.<br>
In the central nervous system (CMS) the transmission of stimuli takes place by the interaction of a neurotransmitter, which is sent out by a neuron, with a neuroreceptor.<br>
L-glutamic acid, the most commonly occurring neurotransmitter in the CNS, plays a critical role in a large number of physiological processes. The glutamate-dependent stimulus receptors are divided into two main groups. The first main group forms ligand-controlled ion channels. The metabotropic giutamate receptors (mGluR) form the second main group and, furthermore, belong to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors.<br>
At present, eight different members of these mGluR are known and of these some even have sub-types. On the basis of structural parameters, the different influences on the synthesis of secondary metabolites and the different affinity to low-molecular weight chemical compounds, these eight receptors can be sub-divided into three sub-groups: mGluRl and mGluRS belong to group I, mGIuR2 and mGluR3 belong to group II and mGluR4, mGluR6, rnGluR7 and mGluR8 belong to group III.<br>
Ligands of metabotropic giutamate receptors belonging to the group 11 can be used for the treatment or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders such as psychosis, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive disorders and memory deficits.<br>
Other treatable indications in this connection are restricted brain function caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain, spinal cord injuries, head injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and hypoglycaemia. Further treatable indications are chronic and acute pain, Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), dementia caused by AIDS, eye injuries, retinopathy, idiopathic parkinsonism or parkinsonism caused by medicaments as well as conditions which lead to glutamate-deficiency functions, such as e.g. muscle spasms, convulsions, migraine, urinary incontinence, nicotine addiction, opiate addiction, anxiety, vomiting, dyskinesia, depressions, colon cancer, sleep disorders, disorders of circadian rhythms and glioma<br><br>
since mGluR2 antagonists have been found to reduce cell proliferation in human glioma cells (J. Neurochem. March 2003, 84(6): 1288-95).<br>
Objects of the present invention are compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts per se and as pharmaceutically active substances, their manufacture, medicaments based on a compound in accordance with the invention and their production, as well as the use of the compounds in accordance with the invention in the control or prevention of illnesses of the aforementioned kind, and, respectively, for the production of corresponding medicaments.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can also be used in form of their prodrugs. Examples are esters, N-oxides, phosphate esters, glycoamide esters, glyceride conjugates and the like. The prodrugs may add to the value of the present compounds advantages in absorption, pharmacokinetics in distribution and transport to the brain.<br>

Unless otherwise specified, all the compounds described in general procedures and schemes I and II are commercially available.<br><br><br>
To a stirred solution of commercially available compound of formula (III) in an organic solvent (e.g. tert-butyl-methyl-ether) is added at room temperature a solution of sodium methanolate in methanol followed by a solution of compound of formula (II) in an organic solvent (e.g. tert-butyl-methyl-ether). The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for about 19 h, cooled, acidified and extracted (e.g. with diethyl ether). The combined organic layers are washed and dried (e.g. MgSO4) and evaporated to give crude the compound of formula (IV) which can be used without further purification. Compounds of formula (II) are either commercially available or prepared according to examples A.l to A.6.<br>
Step 2:<br>
A stirred mixture of commercially available compound of formula (V) (e.g. 3-amino-4-ethoxycarbonyl-pyrazole) and compound of formula (IV) in an organic acid (e.g. acetic acid) is heated under reflux conditions for about 1.5 h. The reaction mixture is evaporated and the crude product is dissolved in a mixture of a concentrated base (e.g. KOH in methanol and water). The reaction mixture is stirred at about 60°C for about 1.5 h, cooled, acidified and concentrated. The precipitate is collected by filtration and further purified (e.g. by crystallization from diethylether/methanol) to give the compound of formula (VI).<br>
Scheme 2<br><br><br>
General procedure II (oxadiazoles)<br>
The compounds of the invention of formula (I) can be obtained either with route a) or with route b).<br>
In route a), to a stirred solution of a carboxylic acid (0.5 mmol) in DMF (5 ml) is added at room temperature a compound of formula (VII) (e.g. l,r-carbonyl-diimidazol (0.75 mmol)) and the reaction mixture is allowed to stir at room temperature for 2h. The corresponding compound of formula (VIII) (e.g. N-hydroxy-amidine (0.75 mmol)) is added, the reaction mixture is stirred at 80°C for 15h and evaporated to dryness. Acetic acid (7.5 ml) is added, the stirred reaction mixture heated under reflux conditions for 4h and evaporated.

However, the administration can also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like; depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose and the like. Adjuvants, such as alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils and the like, can be used for<br><br>
aqueous Injection solutions of water-soluble salts of compounds of formula (I), but as a rule are not necessary. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.<br>
in addition, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
As mentioned earlier, medicaments containing a compound of formula (1) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a therapeutically inert excipient are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for the production of such medicaments which comprises bringing one or more compounds of formula (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical dosage form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.<br>
The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, the effective dosage for oral or parenteral administration is between 0.01-20 mg/kg/day, with a dosage of 0.1-10 mg/ kg/day being preferred for all of the indications described. The daily dosage for an adult human being weighing 70 kg accordingly lies between 0.7-1400 mg per day, preferably between 7 and 700 mg per day.<br>
The present invention relates also to the use of compounds of formula (I) and of pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof for the production of medicaments, especially for the control or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders of the aforementioned kind.<br>

Transfection and cell culture<br>
cDNA encoding the rat mGlu2 receptor protein in pBluescript II was subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA I-amp from Invitrogen Ltd (Paisley, UK). This vector construct (pcDlmGR2) was co-transfected with a psvNeo plasmid encoding the gene for neomycin resistance, into CHO cells by a modified calcium phosphate method described by Chen &amp; Okayama (1988). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle medium with reduced L-glutamine (2 mM final concentration) and 10 % dialysed foetal calf serum from Gibco-lnvitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Selection was made in the presence of G-418 (1000 ug/ml final) and a-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG). Clones were identified by reverse transcription of 5 \xg total RNA, followed by PCR using mGlu2 receptor specific primers 5'-atcactgcttgggtttctggcactg-3' and 5'-agcatcactgtgggtggcataggagc-3' in 60 mM Tris HCl (pH 10), 15 mM (NH4)2SO4, 2 mM MgCb, 25 units/ml Taq Polymerase with 30 cycles annealing at 60 °C for 1 min., extention at 72 °C for 30 s, and 1 min. 95 °C denaturation.<br>
Membrane preparation<br>
Cells, cultured as above, were harvested and washed three times with cold PBS and frozen at -80 °C. The pellet was resuspended in cold 20 mM HEPES-NaOH buffer containing 10 mM EDTA (pH 7.4), and homogenised with a polytron (Kinematica, AG, Littau, Switzerland) for 10 s at 10 000 rpm. After centrifugation for 30 min. at 4 °C, the pellet was washed once with the same buffer, and once with cold 20 mM HEPES-NaOH buffer containing 0.1 mM EDTA, (pH 7.4). Protein content was measured using the micro BCA method from Pierce-Perbio (Rockford, IL, USA ) using bovine serum albumin as standard.<br>
[^H]'LY354740 binding<br>
After thawing, the membranes were resuspended in cold 50mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 2 mM MgCl2 (pH 7) (binding buffer). The final concentration of the membranes in the assays was 25 µg protein/ml. Inhibition experiments were performed<br><br>
with membranes incubated with 10 nM [3H]-LY354740 at room temperature, for 1 hour, in presence of various concentrations of the compound to be tested. Following the incubations, membranes were filtered onto Whatmann GF/B glass fiber filters and washed 5 times with cold binding buffer. Non specific binding was measured in the presence of 10 µM DCG IV. After transfer of the filters into plastic vials containing 10 ml of Ultima-gold scintillation fluid from Perkin-Elmer(Boston, MA, USA), the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation in a Tri-Carb 2500 TR counter (Packard, Zurich, Switzerland).<br>
Data analysis.<br>
The inhibition curves were fitted with a four parameter logistic equation giving IC50<br>
values, and Hill coefficients.<br>
