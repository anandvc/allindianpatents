DESCRIPTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a method of plasma spraying for forming a metal<br>
spray coating for corrosion prevention on a surface of a metal body. More particularly, the<br>
present invention relates to a method of thermal spraying suitable for field repair of a steel<br>
structure.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Conventionally, a coating is generally used for preventing corrosion in steel<br>
structures such as a steel tower, a bridge, an elevated structure, and a tank. The coating has<br>
problems that a coating cost is expensive, a useful life is limited, and a repair cost is also<br>
expensive because regular recoating is required. Thus, as a measure to prevent corrosion that<br>
can replace the coating, a construction method is proposed in which a spray coating is formed<br>
on a steel surface. For example, Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication No. 2001-89880<br>
describes an anticorrosive structure for a steel structure in which thermal spraying is<br>
performed for a portion of the steel structure that is placed in a bad environment and weather<br>
proof steel is used for other portions. It is described that this anticorrosive structure can<br>
improve an anticorrosive property of the entire steel structure and can reduce a construction<br>
cost and a repair cost.<br>
[0003]<br>
For a marine structure that is exposed to a severe corrosive environment for a long<br>
period of time, a construction method that forms a resin lining coating is conventionally used<br><br>
and thermal spraying is proposed as a method for repairing a damaged portion of the lining<br>
coating on the site. For example, Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication No. 2002-69604<br>
describes a method for repairing a lining coating for corrosion prevention in which a base<br>
surface treatment is performed to roughen a defect portion generated in the lining coating,<br>
then the defect portion is preheated to a necessary temperature, and thereafter a repair coating<br>
is formed by performing thermal spraying of fine particles of a polymer compound to the<br>
defect portion. It is described that this repair method enables field repair with a longer life<br>
and higher reliability as compared with a conventional repair method that performs repair<br>
with a coating material that hardens at room temperature.<br>
[0004]<br>
A spray coating is excellent in properties such as corrosive resistance, heat resistance,<br>
and wear resistance. Thus, thermal spraying is used in a broad range as a surface modification<br>
technique not only for steel that is a material for a steel structure but also for various materials<br>
and products. In thermal spraying, a spray coating is formed by spraying a thermal spray<br>
material that is heated to be in a molten state or a semi-molten state onto a thermal spray<br>
subject. Gas flame spraying and plasma spraying are known as principal methods of thermal<br>
spraying.<br>
[0005]<br>
In gas flame spraying, a thermal spray material in the form of a line, a stick or<br>
powder is heated by using combustion flame of oxygen and combustible gas so as to be in a<br>
molten state or a state close to the molten state, and is then sprayed onto a thermal spray<br>
subject so as to form a spray coating. Gas flame spraying is most common because an<br>
operation is easy and a cost of equipment and a running cost are inexpensive.<br>
[0006]<br>
In plasma spraying, a thermal spray material is heated and accelerated by using<br><br>
plasma jet so as to be in a molten state or a state close to the molten state. Then, a spray<br>
coating is formed by spraying the thermal spray material onto a thermal spray subject. Plasma<br>
spraying can use various thermal spray materials including high melting point ceramics,<br>
metals, and plastics. In plasma spraying, thermal spraying can be performed in an air, an inert<br>
atmosphere, or a reduced-pressure atmosphere. The thermal spray material used in plasma<br>
spraying is typically in the form of powder. However, a plasma arc torch using a thermal<br>
spray material in the form of a line or a stick is proposed in Japanese Patent Publication No.<br>
5-80273 , Japanese Patent Publication No. 6-39682 and Japanese Patent No. 3261518 in<br>
recent years.<br>
[0007]<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0008]<br>
Before thermal spraying, it is necessary to remove a coating, a plating film, oxide, or<br>
the like on a surface of a thermal spray subject and roughen the surface as a pretreatment for<br>
the thermal spray subject. Roughening of the surface of the thermal spray subject provides a<br>
so-called anchor effect that sprayed particles mechanically engage with concavities and<br>
convexities of the roughened surface and adhesion between the spray coating and the thermal<br>
spray subject is enhanced. The roughening is usually performed by a method called as a blast<br>
treatment. There are some techniques of blast treatment. In a typical technique, natural<br>
mineral, artificial mineral, metal grit, nonmetal grit, cut wire, or the like is projected onto the<br>
thermal spray subject by using a compressed air, thereby exposing a base material of the<br>
subject and forming minute irregular concavities and convexities on the surface of the subject.<br><br>
[0009]<br>
The blast treatment requires a large-scale apparatus, e.g., a hopper for a blast<br>
material, a tank, an air compression apparatus, a compressed air piping, a blast material<br>
supply piping, a torch, a blast material recovery apparatus, and a dust collecting apparatus. In<br>
the case of a construction process in which those apparatuses are installed in a plant for<br>
processing a material for a steel structure or the like, the blast treatment is performed in a<br>
material processing step, and thereafter the material for which thermal spraying has been<br>
performed is carried to a construction site and the steel structure is constructed there, the blast<br>
treatment can be performed without a significant problem. However, in the case of field<br>
repair, there are serious problems when a cost, work, and an environment are considered.<br>
Thus, there is great difficulty in performing the blast treatment. It is difficult to install all the<br>
above apparatuses on a repair site in order to perform the blast treatment on the repair site.<br>
Moreover, field repair of a large structure is performed by overhead location work in many<br>
cases and it is difficult to install the necessary apparatuses at an overhead location.<br>
Furthermore, it is difficult to recover the blast material during the blast treatment and collect<br>
dust generated in the blast treatment. Thus, the blast material and dust that are scattered<br>
deteriorate a working condition and pollute an environment.<br>
[0010]<br>
As described above, the blast treatment cannot be performed actually in the case of<br>
field repair using thermal spraying. Thus, it is necessary to take a roughening method that<br>
replaces the blast treatment. Moreover, even if the blast treatment is performed in the plant<br>
for processing the material, it is not possible to avoid deterioration of the working condition.<br>
Therefore, it is better to apply the roughening method that replaces the blast treatment.<br>
[0011]<br>
It is therefore a problem to be solved by the present invention to find out, in the case<br><br>
where a metal thermal spray material is sprayed onto a metal body to form a spray coating for<br>
corrosion prevention, a condition for roughening a thermal spray subject and a condition of<br>
thermal spraying that provide practically sufficient adhesion strength between the spray<br>
coating and the thermal spray subject, and to improve workability of a roughening process<br>
and reduce a spraying cost while maintaining an anticorrosive effect.<br>
MEANS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS<br>
[0012]<br>
The inventors earnestly studied an effect of the condition for roughening of the<br>
thermal spray subject as a pretreatment of thermal spraying and the condition of thermal<br>
spraying on the adhesion strength between the spray coating and the thermal spray subject,<br>
and completed the present invention by finding that the practically sufficient adhesion<br>
strength of the spray coating could be obtained by performing thermal spraying under a<br>
particular condition even in the case where the thermal spray subject was roughened with a<br>
relatively simple tool.<br>
[0013]<br>
A thermal spraying method according to the present invention is a method that sprays<br>
a metal thermal spray material to a metal body especially by plasma spraying to form a spray<br>
coating for corrosion prevention. The thermal spraying method includes: roughening a surface<br>
of a thermal spray subject by using a grinding tool to achieve an average roughness Ra of the<br>
surface in a range of from 2 to 10 µm; and performing thermal spraying under a condition in<br>
which an average area of each of molten particles of the thermal spray material when the<br>
molten particles have stuck to the surface of the thermal spray subject is 10000 to 100000<br>
µm2.<br>
[0014]<br><br>
It is preferable to use a thermal spraying apparatus that uses the metal thermal spray<br>
material in the form of a line or a stick as a plasma spraying apparatus. It is also preferable to<br>
use an aluminum alloy, more preferably, an aluminum-magnesium alloy, as the metal thermal<br>
spray material. Moreover, the thermal spraying method may further include performing a<br>
sealing treatment in the coating after the thermal spraying.<br>
ADVANTAGE OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0015]<br>
When plasma spraying is performed under the condition in which the average area of<br>
each molten particle when the molten particles have stuck to the surface of the thermal<br>
spraying subject falls within a predetermined range, a temperature of the surface of the<br>
thermal spraying subject increases and wettability of a droplet with respect to the surface of<br>
the thermal spraying subject is improved. Thus, even if toughening is performed by the<br>
grinding tool that provides a lower level of roughness than the blast treatment, the adhesion<br>
strength of the spray coating that is considerable to that obtained by a combination of the blast<br>
treatment and gas flame spraying can be obtained. In the roughening by means of the<br>
grinding tool, a large-scale apparatus is not needed as different from the blast treatment, a<br>
portable small tool can be used in overhead location work at field repair, and scattering<br>
powder resulting from the roughening is slight so that a danger of environmental pollution is<br>
low. Furthermore, if thermal spraying can be performed under the condition in which the<br>
average area of each molten particle is 10000 to 100000 µm2 by using arc spraying in place of<br>
plasma spraying, the same operations and advantages as those described above can be<br>
obtained.<br><br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0018]<br>
In the present invention, a subject of thermal spraying is a metal body. Although<br>
thermal spraying can be applied to a nonmetal body, the present invention premises plasma<br>
spraying, aims to enhance an anticorrosive function of a metal structure and reduce a repair<br>
cost, and employs a method of thermal spraying that forms a metal spray coating on the metal<br>
structure or a member for the metal structure.<br>
[0019]<br>
In the present invention, roughening as a pretreatment of thermal spraying is<br>
performed by using a grinding tool. The grinding tool described here means an electric tool in<br>
which an abrasive grain is firmly fixed to a disc-like or belt-like base member, an electric tool<br>
in which a flap or wire is planted on an outer circumferential surface of a wheel, and the like.<br><br>
Some of those tools are small enough to be used in a handheld state and therefore can be<br>
suitably used especially in field repair. When a surface of the thermal spray subject is ground<br>
by means of the aforementioned grinding tool, a number of linear marks that are parallel to<br>
each other are formed on the surface. When the grinding tool is moved in a constant<br>
direction, the linear marks extend in that direction. When the moving directions of the<br>
grinding tool are crossed, the linear marks are also crossed. It is preferable to cross the<br>
moving directions of the grinding tool in order to form a number of concavities and<br>
convexities that are similar to those formed by a blast treatment. However, the roughening of<br>
the present invention can provide sufficient adhesion strength by the linear marks extending in<br>
a constant direction. In the case where the linear marks are crossed, an angle of crossing can<br>
be set to any angle. However, it is preferable to set the angle of crossing in the range of from<br>
60 to 90 degrees.<br>
[0020]<br>
For a most appropriate range of surface roughness obtained by the above roughening,<br>
it is desirable that average roughness Ra be in the range of from 2 to 10 µm. It is more<br>
desirable that the average roughness Ra be in the range of from 5 to 8 µm. Moreover, it is<br>
preferable that maximum roughness Rz be in the range of from 20 to 100 µm and a peak count<br>
value of roughness RPc be in the range of from 30 to 100. When the surface roughness falls<br>
within the above range, molten particles that collide against the roughened surface spread on<br>
the roughened surface with no space during thermal spraying, thus enhancing an anchor effect<br>
that the particles engage with the roughened surface.<br>
[0021]<br>
If the average roughness Ra of the surface roughness is smaller than 2 µm, a<br>
sufficient anchor effect is not obtained and therefore the adhesion strength of the spray coating<br>
is low. Moreover, the average roughness Ra larger than 10 µm is preferable from a viewpoint<br><br>
of the adhesion strength of the spray coating. However, it is necessary to make a grain<br>
diameter of an abrasive grain used in the grinding tool larger in order to achieve such a rough<br>
surface, thus increasing grinding resistance and a burden on a worker who operates the<br>
grinding tool. Therefore, such large average roughness is not practical. In addition, in the<br>
case where the surface roughness is extremely large, molten metal cannot become flat enough<br>
to spread on the roughened surface. Therefore, a gap is formed between the roughened<br>
surface and the molten particles, thus lowering the adhesion strength of the spray coating.<br>
[0022]<br>
If the maximum roughness Rz is smaller than 20 µm, it is necessary to make the<br>
surface roughness homogenous in order to obtain appropriate average roughness. Therefore,<br>
it is difficult to perform roughening by using the aforementioned grinding tool. If the<br>
maximum roughness Rz is larger than 100 µm, a grinding tool having a large-diameter<br>
grinding grain is required. However, the large-diameter grinding grain is easily consumed.<br>
Therefore, it is difficult to perform homogenous grinding and workability is lowered. If the<br>
peak count value of roughness RPc is less than 30, the number of concavities and convexities<br>
is small. That is, there are a number of small smooth portions. Therefore, the adhesion<br>
strength of the molten particles is lowered. Moreover, if the peak count value of roughness<br>
RPc is more than 100, intervals between the concavities and the convexities are too small.<br>
Thus, the molten particles do not sufficiently conform to the surface without space. That is, a<br>
gap is formed and the adhesion strength of the molten particles is lowered.<br>
[0023]<br>
In the present invention, a plasma spraying apparatus is used as a thermal spraying<br>
apparatus. Preferably, a thermal spraying apparatus using a metal thermal spray material in<br>
the form of a line or a stick is used. Such a thermal spraying apparatus is known as described<br>
in Patent References 3 to 5. The known thermal spraying apparatus can be used in the present<br><br>
invention. In the present invention, the above plasma spraying apparatus is used and thermal<br>
spraying is performed in such a manner that an average area of each of molten particles of the<br>
thermal spray material when the molten particles have stuck to the surface of the thermal<br>
spray subject is 10000 to 100000 µm2.<br>
[0024]<br>
In the case of thermal spraying by the plasma spraying apparatus using a metal<br>
thermal spray material in the form of a line or a stick, molten particles collide against a<br>
surface of a thermal spray subject S and is then deposited on the surface while being flat, as<br>
shown in Fig. 1A. Since the molten particles are deposited in a complicated shape, adhesion<br>
strength between individual spray coatings m is enhanced and adhesion strength of a spray<br>
coating M in totality is also enhanced. Moreover, a temperature of the surface of the thermal<br>
spray subject increases and wettability of a droplet with respect to the surface of the thermal<br>
spray subject is improved, by performing thermal spraying in such a manner that the average<br>
area of each molten particle when the molten particles have stuck to the surface of the thermal<br>
spray subject is 10000 to 100000 µm2.<br>
[0025]<br>
On the other hand, in the case of thermal spraying by a gas flame spraying apparatus,<br>
concave portions of a surface of a thermal spray subject S are filled with initial molten<br>
particles, as shown in Fig. 1B. Since the individual spray coatings m are in the form of thin<br>
scales, a coated surface is smooth. Thus, adhesion strength between a coating and another<br>
coating deposited thereon is lowered and the adhesion strength of the spray coating M in<br>
totality is also lowered. Therefore, in the case of thermal spraying by the gas flame spraying<br>
apparatus, surface concavities and convexities that have a comparable level of roughness to<br>
those obtained by roughening by a blast treatment are required. When the surface roughness<br>
is large, the respective spray coatings m in the form of thin scales are formed along a<br><br>
concavo-convex surface of the surface of the thermal spray subject S, as shown in Fig. 1C,<br>
and lowering of the adhesion strength between the spray coatings m sequentially deposited is<br>
suppressed. Therefore, the adhesion strength of the spray coating M in totality is sufficient.<br>
[0026]<br>
In the present invention, plasma spraying is performed for the surface of the thermal<br>
spray subject that is made to have an average roughness Ra of 2 to 10 µm by a pretreatment.<br>
When this thermal spraying is performed under a condition in which the average area of each<br>
of the molten particles of the thermal spray material when the molten particles have stuck to<br>
the surface of the thermal spray subject is 10000 to 100000 µm2, deposition of individual<br>
spray coating layers shown in Fig. 1A is obtained and the adhesion strength of the spray<br>
coating is high in totality. If the average area of each molten particle is smaller or larger than<br>
the above range, a gap is generated between the spray coatings and the temperature of the<br>
surface of the thermal spray subject cannot be sufficiently increased. Thus, sufficient<br>
adhesion strength of the spray coating cannot be obtained. The average area of each molten<br>
particle in the case of gas flame spraying is several hundreds to several thousands of micro<br>
squares. In the spray coating formed by arc spraying, the average area of each molten particle<br>
is several hundreds to several thousands of micro squares and molten particles that are slightly<br>
larger than those in the case of gas flame spraying are contained. However, when the average<br>
roughness Ra of the surface of the thermal spray subject is about 2 to about 10 µm, sufficient<br>
adhesion strength of the spray coating cannot be obtained.<br>
[0027]<br>
There is no condition to be specifically limited other than the roughening process, the<br>
surface roughness and the condition of thermal spraying that are described above. A thickness<br>
of the spray coating can be selected to be an appropriate thickness in the range of from 50 to<br>
200 µm in accordance with a required anticorrosion performance. As the metal thermal spray<br><br>
material, various metals such as aluminum, zinc, copper, cobalt, titanium and alloys of those<br>
metals, that are conventionally known, can be used. In particular, aluminum and aluminum<br>
alloys such as an aluminum-magnesium alloy and a zinc-aluminum alloy are more suitable<br>
than other metals because a sacrificial anode action is fully achieved. Moreover, a sealing<br>
treatment may be performed after formation of the spray coating. Especially in the case of<br>
field repair, it is better to perform the sealing treatment after thermal spraying as soon as<br>
possible. Resins or organic chemicals that are conventionally known can be used as a sealing<br>
material.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
[0028]<br>
An example in which the thermal spraying method of the present invention is applied<br>
to field repair of a steel structure is described in an order of main processes. In the following<br>
description, a case in which an existing steel structure is a structure in which galvanized steel<br>
is coated, a coating is locally separated, and a portion in which a zinc coating is corroded is<br>
repaired by thermal spraying is described as an example.<br>
[0029]<br>
[Roughening process]<br>
Fig. 2 is a perspective view of an exemplary grinding tool used in this example.<br>
The grinding tool 1 is an electric grinding tool called as a grinding roller type sander.<br>
In the grinding tool 1, sandpaper 3 is attached to a roller 2. A surface of a damaged portion of<br>
steel is ground by rotation of the roller 2. Abrasive grains of silicon carbide, alumina, or the<br>
like having grain size number of #20 to #40 (average grain size: 1000 to 425 µm) are firmly<br>
fixed on the sandpaper 3 with resin binder. When the steel surface is ground by means of the<br>
grinding tool 1, the coating and the damaged portion of plating are ground and the steel<br><br>
surface is roughened to have an average roughness Ra of about 5 to about 8 µm. Other than<br>
the grinding roller type sander, a belt sander, a disc sander, a flap wheel, a rotary brush, or the<br>
like can be used as the grinding tool in an appropriate manner.<br>

the plasma spraying apparatus 6 is provided to project from an insulating rear wall 10 of a<br>
nozzle 9 ahead of the nozzle 9. The nozzle 9 includes a cylindrical peripheral wall 11<br>
connected to the rear wall 10 and a conical tapered tube portion 12 provided ahead of the<br>
peripheral wall 11. An outline of a cross section of the tapered tube portion 12 rapidly<br>
becomes smaller forward. A plurality of inflow ports 13 for making plasma gas flow into the<br>
nozzle 9 along a circumferential direction are formed in the peripheral wall 11 at a plurality of<br>
positions. As the plasma gas, inert gas such as nitrogen, argon, helium, and the like can be<br>
used alone or in combination.<br>
[0031]<br>
An outer circumferential nozzle 19 that spurts gas along the outer circumferential<br>
surface of the nozzle 9 ahead of a center line of the nozzle 9 is provided on the outer<br>
circumference of the tapered tube portion 12 of the nozzle 9. As the gas, an air, nitrogen,<br>
argon, helium, and the like can be used. In the outside of the outer circumferential nozzle 19,<br>
a supply device 15 for sending wire 14 of an Al-Mg alloy as a thermal spray material is<br>
provided ahead of the center line of the nozzle 9 and to a base side of a gas-spurting portion.<br>
The supply device 15 includes a guide member 16 and a pushing roller 17.<br>
[0032]<br><br>
The electrode 8 is connected to a negative pole of a DC power supply device 18 and<br>
the wire 14 is connected to a positive pole of the DC power supply device 18. The DC power<br>
supply device 18 can supply a DC voltage of about 30 to about 200 V and a DC current of<br>
about 50 to about 500 A. Moreover, the DC power supply device 18 can apply a high voltage<br>
of approximately 3000 V in a short period of time.<br>
[0033]<br>
[Thermal spraying process]<br>
The plasma spraying apparatus 6 is arranged in such a manner that the center line of<br>
the nozzle 9 of the plasma spraying apparatus 6 is perpendicular to a surface of steel 4 that is a<br>
thermal spray subject.<br>
When the plasma gas is made to flow through the inflow ports 13 of the plasma<br>
spraying apparatus 6, the plasma gas generates a swirling flow along the peripheral wall 11.<br>
In this state, when a voltage of 3000 V is applied by means of the DC power supply device 18,<br>
spark discharge occurs between the electrode 8 and the wire 14. Since the plasma gas is<br>
swirling and a pressure around a center of the plasma gas is lowered, the plasma gas around<br>
the center is preferentially discharged in the spark discharge. When the spark discharge<br>
occurs, the plasma gas between the electrode 8 and the wire 14 is ionized, that is, is put in an<br>
ionization state. Thus, a DC current starts to flow. The flow of the DC current in the plasma<br>
gas promotes generation of plasma from the gas, so that a plasma arc flow is formed. The<br>
plasma arc flow flows along the central portion of the plasma gas in which a pressure is<br>
reduced because of the swirling flow. The plasma gas is heated by that plasma arc flow and<br>
bursts from an outlet 20 of the nozzle 9 as plasma flame.<br>
[0034]<br>
A top end of the wire 14 is rapidly heated and molten by the plasma arc flow. The<br>
molten wire 14 is turned into molten particles 21 that are blown away by the plasma flame<br><br>
toward the steel 4. Since inert gas is used as the plasma gas, the amount of oxygen that is in<br>
contact with the molten particles 21 is small and oxidation of the spray coating 5 that is<br>
formed can be prevented. Moreover, the wire 14 in which the top end is molten and lost is<br>
moved ahead by the pushing roller 17, so that a tip of the wire 14 corresponds with the center<br>
line of the nozzle 9. The outer circumferential nozzle 19 makes compressed gas flow from its<br>
rear part and spurts out the gas from its front part in a conical manner. When the gas is blown<br>
to the molten particles 21 from the outer circumference side, the molten particles 21 are made<br>
fine so as to have a size appropriate for formation of the spray coating 5. The fine molten<br>
particles 21 then collide against the surface of the steel 4 and become flat. A number of<br>
molten particles 21 described above are deposited and bonded to each other, thereby forming<br>
the spray coating 5 by being cooled.<br>
[0035]<br>
[Measurement result of adhesion strength]<br>
In order to confirm an effect of the thermal spraying method of the present invention,<br>
for each of the case where a surface of a thermal spray subject was roughened by a blast<br>
treatment and the case where the surface was roughened by grinding, thermal spraying was<br>
performed by a known gas flame spraying apparatus and the plasma spraying apparatus<br>
shown in Fig. 3, and surface roughness after roughening and adhesion strength of spray<br>
coating were measured. Table 1 shows the measurement results. Please note that practically<br>
sufficient adhesion strength is defined to be 4.5 N/mm2 or more in the description of ISO<br>
(International organization for standardization) 2063. This example employed that value as a<br>
necessary value of the adhesion strength.<br><br><br>
[0037]<br>
As is seen from Table 1, in the case of gas flame spraying, the adhesion strength of<br>
spray coating was about 6 to 7 N/mm2 when a blast treatment was performed as roughening<br>
and the surface roughness Ra was about 20 µm. That is, sufficient adhesion strength was<br>
obtained. However, when grinding was performed and the surface roughness Ra was smaller<br>
than 15 µm, the adhesion strength of spray coating was 4 N/mm2 or less and practically<br>
sufficient adhesion strength was not obtained. The surface roughness Ra obtained by the blast<br>
treatment is usually about 15 to about 40 µm and the adhesion strength obtained by gas flame<br>
spraying is about 6 to 7 N/mm2. On the other hand, in the case of plasma spraying, the<br>
adhesion strength of spray coating was 6 to 7 N/mm2 even when surface roughness Ra<br>
obtained by grinding was in a range from 2 to 10 µm. That is, the sufficient adhesion strength<br>
was obtained. However, when the surface roughness Ra was smaller than 2 µm, the adhesion<br>
strength was low. Thus, such small surface roughness Ra was not practically preferable.<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
METHOD OF PLASMA SPRAYING<br>
In the application of plasma spraying to a metal body, it is intended to attain<br>
reduction of spraying cost and improvement of working efficiency in roughening operation<br>
while maintaining anticorrosive effects. An adhesion strength of spray coating comparable to<br>
that obtained in the conventional combination of blast treatment and gas flame spraying can<br>
be realized even if roughening is conducted with the use of simple tools by performing in<br>
advance such a roughening treatment that the average roughness (Ra) of surface of thermal<br>
spray subject falls within the range of 2 to 10 µm with the use of a grinding tool and thereafter<br>
carrying out thermal spraying under such conditions that the average area of each of molten<br>
particles when molten particles of a thermal spray material have stuck to the surface of<br>
thermal spray subject falls within the range of 10000 to 100000 µm2. In the roughening by<br>
means of grinding tools, large-scale apparatus is not needed as different from the blast<br>
treatment, and portable small tools can be used in overhead location work at field repair. The<br>
scattering of powder resulting from grinding is slight so that the danger of environmental<br>
pollution is low.</td>
