METHOD OF CONTROLLING TRANSMIT POWER IN<br>
WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to wireless communication and, in particular, to a<br>
method of determining a transmit power on an uplink channel in a wireless commu-<br>
nication system such as a general packet radio service (GPRS) system.<br>
Background Art<br>
The GSM (Global System for Mobile communication) is a radio technology which<br>
has been developed as a system for standardizing radio communication systems in<br>
Europe and which has widely been deployed all over the world. The GPRS (General<br>
Packet Radio Service) is introduced to provide a packet switched data service in a<br>
circuit switched data service provided from the GSM. The EDGE (Enhanced Data Rate<br>
for GSM Evolution) employs the 8-PSK (Phase Shift Keying) instead of the GMSK<br>
(Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying) employed in the GSM. The EGPRS (Enhanced<br>
General Packet Radio Service) represents the GPRS using the EDGE.<br>
The physical channel dedicated to GPRS/EGPRS traffic is called Packet Data<br>
Channel (PDCH). Logical channels such as Packet Common Control Channel<br>
(PCCCH), Packet Data Traffic Channel (PDTCH) and Packet Associated Control<br>
Channel (PACCH) are mapped to the PDCH. The PCCCH is used for control signaling<br>
necessary for initiating packet transfer. The PDTCH is used to transmit user data. The<br>
PACCH is used for dedicated signaling.<br>
Time division multiplex access (TDMA) scheme is applied in GSM/GPRS/EDGE<br>
systems. In TDMA scheme, each mobile station in a cell transmits and receives circuit<br>
switched data and/or packet switched data through assigned timeslots. One to eight<br>
timeslots can be allocated to a mobile station per TDMA frame. Timeslots are shared<br>
by the active users, and uplink and downlink timeslots are allocated separately.<br>
Hereinafter, downlink means communication from a network to a mobile station, and<br>
uplink means communication from a mobile station to a network. In GPRS/EDGE<br>
system, users can share a single timeslot simultaneously with several users in a cell. A<br>
single user may transmit and receive data over multiple timeslots simultaneously.<br>
The power control is necessary to mitigate co-channel interference in a wireless com-<br>
munication system. Keeping co-channel interference levels low can result in higher<br>
throughput over a cell, potentially increasing cell's capacity. Effective power control<br>
ensures that timeslots used for GSM/GPRS/EDGE system do not cause unacceptable<br>
levels of interference to timeslots used for voice calls in co-channel neighbor cells.<br><br>
Inadequate power control can cause high error rates or, at worst, broken radio con-<br>
nections which in known as temporary block flows (TBFs). Power control errors may<br>
increase packet delays and decrease user throughputs, thus causing service de-<br>
gradation.<br>
Uplink power control mechanisms allow a network to tune uplink transmit power<br>
used by each mobile station transmitting uplink data blocks. Uplink power control<br>
provides an additional important benefit: transmit power used by each mobile station<br>
can be reduced to levels adequate to achieve proper link performance and transmit<br>
power can be kept as low as possible without sacrificing link throughput, giving users<br>
peak link performance without unnecessarily draining the mobile station's battery.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
The present invention provides a method of controlling a transmit power when a new<br>
timeslot is allocated or a used timeslot is updated.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
In an aspect, a method of controlling a transmit power at a mobile station in a<br>
wireless communication system is provided. The method includes determining a power<br>
control parameter of an assigned timeslot, wherein the value of the power control<br>
parameter is a default value if the assigned timeslot is assigned with no power control<br>
parameter and the value of the power control parameter is the current value if the<br>
assigned timeslot is already used by the mobile station and determining the transmit<br>
power Pup on an uplink channel from the following equation:<br><br>
where C0 is a power offset, CCH is the power control parameter, r is a system<br>
parameter, L is a normalized received signal level at the mobile station and PMAX is the<br>
maximum allowed transmit power in a cell.<br>
In another aspect, a method of controlling a transmit power at a mobile station during<br>
handover in a wireless communication system is provided. The method includes<br>
receiving a handover command message from a network to command the mobile<br>
station to leave a current cell and change to a new cell, the handover command<br>
message comprising radio resources assigned for packet-switched (PS) services in the<br>
new cell, the radio resources comprising information on at least one assigned timeslot,<br>
determining a power control parameter of an assigned timeslot as a default value if the<br>
assigned timeslot is assigned with no power control parameter and determining the<br>
transmit power Pup on an uplink channel from the following equation:<br><br><br>
[14]	where C0 is a power offset, CCH is the power control parameter, r is a system<br>
parameter, L is a normalized received signal level at the mobile station and PlVIAX is the<br>
maximum allowed transmit power in a cell.<br>
[15]	In still another aspect, a mobile station includes a RF (Radio Frequency) unit for<br>
transmitting radio signals using a transmit power, a memory configured to store a<br>
default value for a power control parameter and a processor coupled to the RF unit and<br>
the memory, and configured to determine a power control parameter of an assigned<br>
timeslot, wherein the value of the power control parameter is the default value if the<br>
assigned timeslot is assigned with no power control parameter and the value of the<br>
power control parameter is the current value if the assigned timeslot is already used by<br>
the mobile station and determine the transmit power Pup from the following equation:<br><br>
[ 17]	where C0 is a power offset, CCH is the power control parameter, r is a system<br>
parameter, L is a normalized received signal level at the mobile station and PMAX is the<br>
maximum allowed transmit power in a cell.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
[18]	When a mobile station is assigned a timeslot or updates power and/or timing advance<br>
for uplink transmission, the mobile station can stably control a transmit power of a<br>
timeslot.<br>

Mode for the Invention<br>
[28]	FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a wireless communication system. This shows a<br>
network based on the GSM (Global System for Mobile communication)/GPRS<br>
(General Packet Radio Service). The wireless communication systems are widely used<br>
to provide a variety of communication services of voice, packet data, and so on.<br>
[29]	Referring to FIG. 1, a mobile station (MS) 10 refers to a communication instrument<br>
carried by a user and may also be called other terms such as a UE (User Equipment), a<br>
UT (User Terminal), a SS (Subscriber Station), and a wireless device. A base station<br>
(BS) 20 includes a base transceiver station (BTS) 22 and a base station controller<br>
(BSC) 24. The BTS 22 communicates with the MS 10 in a cellular area through a radio<br>
interface and a synchronization function with the MS 10. The BSC 24 interfaces at<br>
least one BTS 22 with a mobile switching center (MSC) 30. The BS 20 may be called<br>
as a base station subsystem, a Node-B, and an access point.<br>
[30]	The MSC 30 connects the BS 20 to a different kind of network such as the PSTN<br>
(Public Switching Telephone Network) 65 or the PLMN (Public Land Mobile<br>
Network) through the GMSC (Gateway MSC) 60. A VLR (Visitor Location Register)<br>
40 stores temporary user data, which includes information on the roaming of all the<br>
MSs 10 in a service area of the MSC 30. An FILR (Home Location Register) 50<br>
includes information on all the subscribers in the home networks. An SGSN (Serving<br>
GPRS Support Node) 70 takes charge of mobility management of the subscribers. A<br>
GGSN (Gateway GPRS Data Network) 80 routs a packet at the current position of the<br>
MS 10 to interface the MS with an external packet data network such as PDN (Public<br>
Data Network) 85.<br>
[31]	A temporary block flow (TBF) is a logical connection offered by two Medium<br>
Access Control (MAC) entities so as to support the unidirectional transfer of Radio<br>
Link Control (RLC) Protocol Data Unit (PDU) on basic physical subchannels. The<br>
TBF is not provided in a packet idle mode. In the packet idle mode, any radio resource<br>
on a packet data physical channel is not assigned to the MS. At least one TBF is<br>
provided in a packet transfer mode. In the packet transfer mode, radio resources on one<br>
or more packet data physical channels for the transfer of packet data are assigned to the<br>
MS. The MAC-idle state means a MAC-control-entity state where no basic physical<br>
subchannel is assigned. A Temporary Row Identity (TFT) is assigned to each TBF by<br>
the network. The MS assumes that the TFI value is unique among concurrent TBFs in<br>
the same direction (uplink or downlink) on all Packet Data Channels (PDCHs) used for<br>
the TBFs. The same TFI value may be used concurrently for TBFs on other PDCHs in<br>
the same direction and for TBFs in the opposite direction.<br>
[32]	FIG. 2 is a block diagram showing elements of a mobile station. A mobile station<br><br>
includes a processor 51, memory 52, a RF unit 53, a display unit 54, and a user<br>
interface unit 55. The memory 52 is coupled to the processor 51 and stores a MS<br>
operating system, applications and general files. The display unit 54 displays various<br>
pieces of information of the MS and may employ well-known devices such as a Liquid<br>
Crystal Display (LCD) or an Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED). The user<br>
interface unit 55 may consist of a combination of well-known user interfaces such as a<br>
keypad and a touch screen. The RF unit 53 is coupled to the processor 51 and transmits<br>
radio signals.<br>
[33]	The processor 51 implements functions of determining a transmit power. The<br>
memory stores a power control parameter and the processor 51 determines the transmit<br>
power using based on the power control parameter. The RF unit transmits radio signals<br>
using the determined transmit power.<br>
[34]	FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating a method of controlling a transmit power in ac-<br>
cordance with an embodiment of the present invention. This may be uplink access<br>
from a mobile station to a network or may also be called random access procedure.<br>
[35]	Referring to FIG. 3, a mobile station sends a packet channel request message to the<br>
network for radio access (SI 10). The packet channel request message may be a<br>
message to request radio access. The mobile station requests allocation of radio<br>
resources to the network for uplink transmission. The packet channel request message<br>
can be transmitted on RACH (Random Access Channel) or PRACH (Packet Random<br>
Access Channel). If the EGPRS is supported, the packet channel request message may<br>
be an EGPRS channel request message. The mobile station can re-transmit the packet<br>
channel request message by a predetermined number when there is no response from<br>
the network after a predetermined time passes. If the mobile station does not receive<br>
any response, regarding the packet uplink assignment message, from the network, it<br>
results in random access failure.<br>
[36]	The network sends a packet uplink assignment message to the mobile station in<br>
response to the packet channel request message (S120). The packet uplink assignment<br>
message is a response of the network with respect to the radio access request by the<br>
mobile station. The packet uplink assignment message can be transmitted on PCCCH<br>
(Packet Common Control Channel) or PACCH (Packet Associated Control Channel).<br>
The packet uplink assignment message can include information on radio resources,<br>
which are required by the mobile station for uplink transmission. In the GSM/GPRS<br>
system, the radio resources may be a timeslot. Alternatively, the radio resources may<br>
be a radio block. In the GPRS system, one frame is comprised of eight timeslots, and a<br>
radio block is comprised of four consecutive timeslots belonging to different frames.<br>
[37]	The mobile station determines a transmit power of each assigned timeslot for uplink<br>
transmission in addition to information about timeslot assignment. In the mobile<br><br>
station, a transmit power Pup on each uplink PDCH (Packet Data Channel) can be<br>
obtained from the following equation:<br>
[38]	MathBgure 1<br>
[Math.l]<br><br>
[39]	where C0 is a power offset, CCH is a power control parameter, r is a system parameter,<br>
L is a normalized received signal level at the mobile station and PMA* is the maximum<br>
allowed transmit power in a cell. The CCH is the channel specific power control<br>
parameter. The power offset C0 is a constant and may be set to 39 dBm for GSM 900<br>
and 36 dBm for DCS 1800 and PCS 1900. The system parameter r is broadcasted on a<br>
packet broadcast control channel (PBCCH) or optionally sent to a mobile station in an<br>
RLC control message.<br>
[40]	If the power control parameter CCH is decided when the system parameter r and the<br>
power offset C0 are known, the mobile station can calculate the transmit power Pup with<br>
respect to the corresponding timeslot.<br>
[41]	The packet uplink assignment message can include a power control parameter of a<br>
timeslot in addition to information about at least one timeslot, which is necessary by<br>
the mobile station for uplink transmission. In this case, a transmit power can be found<br>
by employing the power control parameter included in the packet uplink assignment<br>
message. The problem is that the power control parameter with respect to each timeslot<br>
cannot be defined when the power control parameter is not included in the packet<br>
uplink assignment message. A method of defining the power control parameter is<br>
needed in order to efficiently control a transmit power. A variety of methods can be<br>
used to define the power control parameter.<br>
[42]	fn an embodiment, if a timeslot is assigned through the packet uplink assignment<br>
message, a mobile station can set a power control parameter of the assigned timeslot to<br>
a default value. For example, the default value may be zero. By setting the power<br>
control parameter to the default value, when the packet uplink assignment message is<br>
received, the mobile station can calculate a transmit power with respect to the assigned<br>
timeslot and perform uplink transmission by employing the calculated transmit power.<br>
[43]	In another embodiment, a mobile station can calculate a transmit power by<br>
employing a previous power control parameter. The previous power control parameter<br>
refers to a power control parameter that is already used in a packet transfer mode<br>
anterior to a current packet transfer mode. That is, in the case where the mode changes<br>
from a packet transfer mode to a packet idle mode and then becomes a current packet<br>
transfer mode again, a power control parameter that had been used in a previous packet<br>
transfer mode is a previous power control parameter. If a corresponding timeslot has a<br><br>
previous power control parameter, the mobile station calculates an output power based<br>
on the previous power control parameter. If the mobile station accesses the network for<br>
the first time after power is on or is assigned a timeslot for the first time, a previous<br>
power control parameter does not exist. If a previous power control parameter does not<br>
exist, the mobile station can calculate a transmit power by defining a power control<br>
parameter as a default value.<br>
[44]	If a power control parameter is not included in the packet uplink assignment<br>
message, the mobile station can find a transmit power by using a previous power<br>
control parameter or a default value as the power control parameter. Hence, a user<br>
equipment can set a power control parameter automatically without the need to<br>
transmit the power control parameter to each user equipment whenever the network<br>
assigns a new timeslot. Thus, scheduling is simplified and the efficient power control<br>
in a cell is achieved.<br>
[45]	FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating a method of controlling a transmit power in ac-<br>
cordance with another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[46]	Referring to FIG. 4, a mobile station sends a packet channel request message to a<br>
network for radio access (S210). The network sends a multiple TBF uplink assignment<br>
message to the mobile station in response to the packet channel request message<br>
(S220). The multiple TBF uplink assignment message may be transmitted on PACCH.<br>
Unlike the packet uplink assignment message, the multiple TBF uplink assignment<br>
message assigns a multiple TBF to the mobile station. The multiple TBF uplink as-<br>
signment message includes timeslot assignment information for uplink transmission in<br>
each TBF.<br>
47]	If the power control parameter is not directly given through the multiple TBF uplink<br>
assignment message, a variety of methods can be used in order to find the transmit<br>
power.<br>
48]	In an embodiment, if a timeslot is assigned through the multiple TBF uplink as-<br>
signment message, the mobile station can set a power control parameter of the assigned<br>
timeslot to a default value. For example, the default value may be zero. By setting the<br>
power control parameter to the default value, when the packet uplink assignment<br>
message is received, the mobile station can calculate a transmit power of an assigned<br>
timeslot and perform uplink transmission by employing the calculated transmit power.<br>
49]	In another embodiment, the mobile station can calculate a transmit power by<br>
employing a previous power control parameter. The previous power control parameter<br>
refers to a power control parameter that had been used in a packet transfer mode<br>
anterior to a current packet transfer mode. If there exists a previous power control<br>
parameter with respect to a corresponding timeslot, the mobile station calculates an<br>
output power by employing the previous power control parameter. If there does not<br><br>
exist a previous power control parameter, the mobile station can calculate a transmit<br>
power by setting the power control parameter to a default value.<br>
[50] . FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating a method of controlling a transmit power in ac-<br>
cordance with still another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[51]	Referring to FIG. 5, in a packet transfer mode, a mobile station transmits packet data<br>
through an assigned timeslot (S310). During the packet transfer mode, the network can<br>
update power and/or TA (Timing Advance) of the mobile station by sending a packet<br>
power control/TA message to the mobile station (S320). TA can be a value used to<br>
advance a transmit timing to the base station in order to compensate for propagation<br>
delay in the mobile station. The packet power control/TA message can be transmitted<br>
on the PACCH.<br>
[52]	Only TA can be updated through the packet power control/TA message. In other<br>
words, this corresponds to a case where the network sends only T A. If TA is updated,<br>
the transmit power of each timeslot can be found by employing a previous power<br>
control parameter. The previous power control parameter is a power control parameter<br>
that had been used by a corresponding timeslot in a current packet transfer mode. That<br>
is, since a current mode is a packet transfer mode, a transmit power parameter that had<br>
been used previously exists in each timeslot in order to transmit old packet data. The<br>
transmit power of the timeslot is found by employing the transmit power parameter<br>
that had been used. If a previous transmit power parameter does not exist, the power<br>
control parameter can be set to a default value.<br>
[53]	Only power can be updated through the packet power control/TA message. This cor-<br>
responds to a case where the network sends a power control parameter. Here, a<br>
transmit power is calculated by employing a received power control parameter.<br>
[54]	Power with respect to only a part of timeslots can be updated through the packet<br>
power control/TA message. A transmit power with respect to some of the timeslots to<br>
which a transmit power parameter is given is calculated by employing the given<br>
transmit power parameter. A transmit power with respect to the remaining timeslots to<br>
which a transmit power parameter is not given is calculated by employing a previous<br>
power control parameter.<br>
[55]	Both power and TA can be updated through the packet power control/TA message.<br>
Even in this case, a transmit power of a timeslot to which a power control parameter is<br>
not given is calculated by employing a previous power control parameter.<br>
[56]	The mobile station transmits packet data by employing the obtained transmit power<br>
and the updated power and/or TA (S330).<br>
[57]	FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating a method of controlling a transmit power in ac-<br>
cordance with still another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[58]	Referring to FIG. 6, in a packet transfer mode, a mobile station transmits packet data<br><br>
through an assigned times lot (S410). During the packet transfer mode, a network can<br>
update power and/or TA of the mobile station by sending a packet uplink ACK<br>
(Acknowledgment)/NACK (Non-Acknowledgment) message to the mobile station<br>
(S420). The packet uplink ACK/NACK message is a message that is sent from the<br>
network to the mobile station in order to inform the state of a received RLC (Radio<br>
Link Control) data block and can be transmitted on PACCH. The packet uplink ACK/<br>
NACK message includes power and/or TA and can update power and/or TA.<br>
[59]	Only power can be updated through the packet uplink ACK/NACK message. That is,<br>
this corresponds to a case where the network sends a power control parameter. Here, a<br>
transmit power is calculated by employing a received power control parameter.<br>
[60]	Power with respect to only a part of timeslots can be updated through the packet<br>
uplink ACK/NACK message. A transmit power with respect to some of timeslots to<br>
which a transmit power parameter is given is calculated by employing the given<br>
transmit power parameter. A transmit power with respect to the remaining timeslots to<br>
which a transmit power parameter is not given is calculated by employing a previous<br>
power control parameter.<br>
[61]	Both power and TA can be updated through the packet uplink ACK/NACK message.<br>
Even in this case, a transmit power with respect to a timeslot to which a power control<br>
parameter is not given is calculated by employing a previous power control parameter.<br>
[62]	The mobile station transmits packet data by employing the obtained transmit power<br>
and the updated power and/or TA (S430).<br>
[63]	FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating a method of controlling a transmit power in ac-<br>
cordance with still another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[64]	Referring to FIG. 7, in a packet transfer mode, a mobile station transmits packet data<br>
through an assigned timeslot (S510). During the packet transfer mode, the network can<br>
assign an uplink timeslot to the mobile station by sending a packet timeslot reconfigure<br>
message to the mobile station (S520). The packet timeslot reconfigure message can be<br>
transmitted on PACCH.<br>
[65]	The packet timeslot reconfigure message can include a power control parameter with<br>
respect to a timeslot in addition to information about at least one timeslot, which is<br>
required by the mobile station for uplink transmission. In this case, a transmit power<br>
can be found by employing the power control parameter included in the packet uplink<br>
assignment message. When the power control parameter is not included in the packet<br>
timeslot reconfigure message, a variety of methods can be used in order to define the<br>
power control parameter with respect to the timeslot.<br>
[66]	In an embodiment, if a timeslot is assigned through the packet timeslot reconfigure<br>
message, the mobile station can set a power control parameter, with respect to the<br>
assigned timeslot, to a previously set value. For example, the set value may be zero. By<br><br>
setting the power control parameter to the previously set value, the mobile station can<br>
calculate a transmit power of the assigned timeslot if the packet timeslot reconfigure<br>
message is received and perform uplink transmission based on the calculated transmit<br>
power.<br>
[67]	In another embodiment, the mobile station can calculate a transmit power of an<br>
assigned timeslot by employing a previous power control parameter. The previous<br>
power control parameter can include two kinds. The first previous power control<br>
parameter is a power control parameter that had been used in a corresponding timeslot<br>
in a current packet transfer mode. That is, if an assigned timeslot has once been used in<br>
a current packet transfer mode, a transmit power parameter that has been used becomes<br>
a first previous power control parameter. The second previous power control parameter<br>
is a power control parameter that had been used in a packet transfer mode anterior to a<br>
current packet transfer mode. That is, in the case where the mode changes from a<br>
packet transfer mode to a packet idle mode and then becomes a current packet transfer<br>
mode again, a power control parameter that had been used in a previous packet transfer<br>
mode is a second previous power control parameter. The mobile station gives a priority<br>
to the first previous power control parameter. If the first previous power control<br>
parameter exists, the mobile station can find a transmit power by employing the first<br>
previous power control parameter. If the first previous power control parameter does<br>
not exist and the second previous power control parameter exists, the mobile station<br>
can find a transmit power by employing the second previous power control parameter.<br>
If both the first previous power control parameter and the second previous power<br>
control parameter do not exist, the mobile station can find a transmit power by<br>
employing a default value. As another example, the mobile station can find a transmit<br>
power by employing only one of the first previous power control parameter or the<br>
second previous power control parameter.<br>
[68]	The mobile station transmits packet data by employing the obtained transmit power<br>
and the assigned timeslot (S530).<br>
[69]	FIG. 8 is a flowchart illustrating a method of controlling a transmit power in ac-<br>
cordance with still another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[70]	Referring to FIG. 8, a mobile station transmits packet data to a network through an<br>
assigned timeslot (S610). During the packet transfer mode, the network can assign an<br>
uplink timeslot to the mobile station by sending a packet uplink assignment message to<br>
the mobile station (S620). In other words, unlike the embodiment of FIG. 3, the packet<br>
uplink assignment message can be sent from the network to the mobile station during<br>
transmission of packet data not a response to a packet channel request message in order<br>
to assign a new timeslot. A default value can be used as a transmit power parameter<br>
with respect to an assigned timeslot.<br><br>
[71 ]	The mobile station transmits packet data by employing the obtained transmit power<br>
and the assigned timeslot (S630).<br>
[72]	FIG. 9 is a flowchart illustrating a method of controlling a transmit power in ac-<br>
cordance with still another embodiment of the present invention. This shows a method<br>
of controlling a transmit power during handover.<br>
[73]	Referring to FIG. 9, the network transmits a handover command message to the<br>
mobile station on the PACCH (S710). The handover command message is a message<br>
to instruct that the mobile station should leave a current cell and arrive in a new cell.<br>
The handover command message includes information about radio resources, allocated<br>
for a packet-switched service in a new cell, and also includes at least one timeslot as-<br>
signment information.<br>
[74]	If a power control parameter with respect to an assigned timeslot is not given, the<br>
mobile station that has received the handover command message determines a power<br>
control parameter as a set value. The mobile station finds a transmit power by<br>
employing the set power control parameter.<br>
[75]	The mobile station transmits a handover access message to the network (S720). The<br>
handover access message is to make the network aware that the mobile station has left<br>
the old cell and arrived in the new cell. The handover access message is sent on the<br>
PACCH associated with an uplink TBF allocated in the handover command message.<br>
[76]	If a cell is changed, a power control parameter has to be changed. The power control<br>
parameter is sensitive to path loss. Path loss is greatly influenced by a distance<br>
between a mobile station and a network. Thus, if only a timeslot is assigned through a<br>
handover command message during handover, but the power control parameter for the<br>
timeslot is not given, a transmit power can be controlled stably by setting the power<br>
control parameter to a set value.<br>
[77]	When a mobile station is assigned a timeslot or updates power and/or timing advance<br>
for uplink transmission, the mobile station can stably control a transmit power of a<br>
timeslot.<br>
[78]	The functions described in connection with the embodiments disclosed herein may<br>
be performed by implemented by hardware, software or a combination thereof. The<br>
hardware may be implemented by a microprocessor, a controller, an application<br>
specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and a processor. Design, development and imple-<br>
mentation of the software are well known to those skilled in the art based on the<br>
detailed description.<br>
[79]	As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without departing from<br>
the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be understood that the<br>
above-described embodiments are not limited by any of the details of the foregoing de-<br>
scription, unless otherwise specified, but rather should be construed broadly within its<br><br>
