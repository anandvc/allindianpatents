				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to symmetrical cryptography and in particular telecommunication systems using symmetrica! cryptography.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Encryption of data sent over networks should typically prevent that identical plain-text blocks that are sent a plurality of times are being transformed into the same cipher-text block. This requirement should render it very complicated or impossible for the unauthorised cryptoanalyst to eavesdrop on encrypted cipher-texts relating to e.g Internet browsing messages where the same web pages are requested over again by the same user<br>
In fig. 1, a known single key cryptosystem is shown, in which a sendei S is sending a plain-text message P to a receiver R. The plain-text message block P is processed ac cording to a cipher, which in this case is (he exclusive-OR function (XOR), with a key, consisting of a random bit sequence RS, such that a cipher-text block C is generated. The cipher-text block C is transmitted in point A over a medium M and is received in point B. For instance A corresponds to a radio transmitter, M corresponds to the air and B corresponds to a radio receiver. After reception in point B, the ciphei-text message block C is processed in an exclusive~OR function with the same random sequence RS key, as used under encryption, such that the original plain-text block P is recovered<br>
For a sequence of plaintexts being transmitted, such as packets in a packet data net work, it is noted that the receiver must know which order number of cipher-text message he receives in order to utilise the corresponding random bit sequence<br>
A fable of random sequences known to both the receiver and sender can be used as keys for the symmetrica! encryption and decryption. Such a table could have the format shown in fig 2, or it could be much larger.<br>
A Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG) can also be used to generate appreper ate keys. A PRNG is a non-true random construction, which to the uninitiated appears to be a truly random number generator (TRNG). Normally a PRNG can achieve near<br>
TRNG output for a limited period, and quite often, the output will repeat itself in cycles. A longer cycle generally means a better PRNG.<br>
Achieving true randomness for an inherently deterministic machine is a difficult problem. A solution purely based on software can only achieve "almost random" or "random-like" behaviour, in nature, omni present background radiation and hence atomic decay is considered one of the few true sources of randomness.  In computer science, a carefully designed Josephson junction is regarded as a True Random Noise Generator, TRNG, as well.<br>
Typically, the PRNG can be invoked with no parameters. Some PRNG require a specification of the number of random bits needed in order to generate a "random" value. Any identical subsequent calls will render different values.<br>
To prevent a PRNG from emitting the same pseudo random stream upon every restart, most PRNG constructs support the notion of "seeding" or initialisation with a random number seed. Typically, most PRNG will render the same output stream when seeded with the exact same seed again.<br>
Generally, a PRNG is not a PRNG when both the actual PRNG construct and the seed are known to the observer. The observer can easily predict the next (n+1) PRNG output by seeding the PRNG with the initial seed and iterating the PRNG n+1 times.<br>
There are PRNG constructs, which can take the "n" count as a parameter and produce a pseudo random response in a single run. The Data Encryption Standard function .DES_encrypt(seed|count), where "j" denotes concatenation is one example.<br>
By exposing either the algorithm or the seed, the PRNG is weakened. Note however, that a strong PRNG construct with a large internal state can still be very hard to predict as long as the initial seed is unknown to the observer. Note also, that it can be quite hard to protect the iteration count from an outside observer. Resorting to constructs where oniy every n th PRNG output is actually emitted from the PRNG can be viewed as a new PRNG, which again faces the same problem of iteration count.<br>
PRNG construction constitutes a science per se, and a large number are readily available in the literature. To name a few: RC2, RC4, most block ciphers in OFB (Output<br>
FeedBack) mode, MT19937B, general constructs with HMAC combinations with secure hash algorithms such as SHA-1, MD5 and RIPEMD<br>
When a PRNG meets certain criteria regarding predictability, it can be referred to as a cryptographically secure PRNG. RC2 and RC4 were constructed for this very purpose. A large amount of research has gone.into the investigation of several of these algorithms regarding their cycle length. For the case of hash constructs, one problem that has been dealt with is how many output bytes can be achieved without endangering the PRNG internal entropy pool, without entropy renewal.<br>
A true One-Time Password, OTP, cryptographic construct is perhaps the only cryptographic construct against which no attacks are known or indeed available. OTP cryptography is based on using a table, as shown in fig. 2, of predefined keys, which are used only once and subsequently discarded by both the client and the server.<br>
Besides encryption, One-Time Passwords, OTP's, are also commonly used in authentication, where instead of presenting a particular password upon each logon, the uset enters the next entry in the table of passwords.<br>
One drawback lies in the distribution of the predefined tables.<br>
Another potential problem for OTP based systems is lack of synchronisation between client and server. E.g. the client tries to authenticate over a bad connection and the server receives a (garbled) bad password. The server must deny access and disregatd the logon request. By now, the client's next password is from entry n+1, whereas the server still is at n. Consequently, the server must try several passwords, usually up to n+x, where x can be considered as a synchronisation window. As long as less than x wrong authentications has taken place since the last correct authentication, the current authentication can be successful if the password is correct.<br>
The predefined lists of one-time passwords do not necessarily have to be lists. In more general notions the lists could be predetermined <value iteration> tuples.<br>
This brings us back to the PRNG's. If an initial seed has been agreed upon, a set of new passwords can be viewed as a result of the PRNG process or output.<br>
Encrypting the same plaintext P twice using the same cipher and key will produce two equal cipher texts C and C. To prevent this an Initialization Vector (IV) is often used. The initialisation vector is randomly chosen differently for each plaintext P and is sent in clear text to the receiver. For stream ciphers (e.g. RC4) the initialisation vector is often concatenated with the secret key:<br>
Oencrypt(P,key|IV) P=decrypt(C,key|IV)<br>
For block ciphers (e.g. DES) it is more common to have a construct similar to:<br>
P'=P xor IV, C'=encrypt(P',key) P'=decrypt(C',key), P=P' xor IV.<br>
In both cases, the initialisation vector is sent in the clear to the receiver with each encrypted message.<br>
In fig. 3, 4 and 7, the inventors perception of the latter described cryptography method has been shown.<br>
A sequence of plain text blocks P is issued by a sender S who has agreed on a 40-bit key or password, Pswdl, with a receiver R. The plaintext blocks P are processed with an exclusive-OR function wtth various OTP's denoted RC4stream#1, RC4stream#2....<br>
RC4stream#n.<br>
In analogy with figure 1, a sender side S and a receiving side R are provided and transmission by a telecommunication system (not shown) over a medium M between points A and B is provided.<br>
Reference shall now be made to fig. 3 and 4. On the sender side S, a PRNG generates an identification vector, which generates a 24-bit response. Next, a second 64-bit password, Pswd2, is composed of the initialisation vector generated by the PRNG and the Pswdl by arranging the two bit sequences after one another. The resulting key, Pswd2, is input in a RC4 function, which, subsequently generates the one time password, namely<br>
a bit sequence denoted RC4stream#(1-n), which is input to the XOR function, mentioned above. Thereby the cipher text C is generated and is ready for being transmitted.<br>
The cipher text C - having an order number corresponding to a given plaintext order number - and the initialisation vector of corresponding order number used for generating the RC4Stream are enclosed in the same data packet when transmitting.<br>
In fig. 7, the timing diagram pertaining to the above cryptography method has been shown. At the.sender side, S, an initial packet P1 and an initial initialisation vector IV1 are commenced issued at time to.<br>
The second password Pswd2 is generated by the composition of Pswdl and the random initialisation vector and is inserted in the RC4 function.  From t1 the RC4stream (RCstream#1) is generated via the RC4 generator at the sender side S RC4. At t2 the XOR function at the sender side S XOR generates the ciphertext CI, such that a data packet consisting of ciphertext and initialisation vector, having corresponding order numbers are transmitted.<br>
Referring now to fig. 3, substantially the same process is applied at the receiving side R as at the sending side S: The initialisation vector is recovered from the transmitted packet. The receiver outputs the Pswdl of appropriate order number for instance corresponding to the packet number. Subsequently, an RC4stream, which is identical to the RC4stream at the sending side of the same order number, is input to the XOR operator.<br>
Hence, as soon the transmitted initialisation vector is received, the corresponding RC4stream can be generated. In fig. 7, it is shown that the generation of the RC4stream#1 at the receiver side is commenced at t3 and is XOR'ed with the ciphertext C1. Finally, at t4 the plaintext P1 is output of the operator R XOR.<br>
This process is iterated with plaintext blocks P2 to Pn using only one single password Pswdl known to the sender and receiver and by using distinct one time passwords by pseudo randomly generating initialisation vectors IV1 to IVn.<br>

Detailed description of preferred embodiments of the invention<br>
In figs. 5, 6 and 8 an exemplary embodiment of the present invention has been shown.<br>
Initially an initial Pswdl is negotiated between a sender and a receiver during session set-up/ authentication, it should be. understood that the roles of the sender and the receiver might change overtime, such that a bi-directional communication session is performed. However, in the following for reasons of simplicity it shall be explained how communication is performed from a party denoted sender to another party denoted receiver. The sender and receiver could refer to communication units, e.g. mobile terminals.<br>
As in the prior art, a sequence of plain texts P is issued by the sender S who has agreed on a first password, Pswdl, with the receiver R. The plaintexts P are processed with an exclusive-OR function with various keys denoted RC'stream#.1, RC'stream#2. .<br>
RC'stream#n. The first password may have a length of for instance 64 bit or any other length.<br>
More specifically, the first password Pswdl is input in a random sequence generator, RC, such as RC2 or RC4, and a first random bit sequence string, RCstream, is gener-ated as shown in fig. 6. The RC generator could suitably be chosen such that the RCstream has an infinite length. This random bit sequence string is partitioned such that a set of n initialisation vectors, IV1 - IVn, is defined<br>
As shown in fig. 5 and 6, the n identification vectors IV1 - IVn are individually processed according to second random sequence generator RC according to the function RC'(IV), such that a set of n random bit string sequences, RC'stream#1 - RC'stream#n appears Again, as random sequence generator, RC2 or RC4 could advantageously be used, but other generators are optional.<br>
It is envisioned that as an alternative to the embodiment shown in fig. 5 and 6, a single random bit sequence generator RC can be used whereby the resulting bit sequence being partitioned into n keys.<br>
The latter n streams are stored in tabular form with Pa1 - Pan entries in a packet buffer Thereby, a list of n distinct one-time keys is accomplished.<br>
At the receiving side the same operations as on the sending side are carried out such that an identical list of one time keys are accomplished on both sides.<br>
Hence, ciphering is accomplished for a plaintext P with a given order number using the known XOR function with a given key, RCstream, with a corresponding order number, such that a ciphertext C of the corresponding order number is accomplished.<br>
The deciphering is accomplished for a ciphertext C with a given order number using the known XOR function with the same key, RCstream, with the same corresponding older number as used under ciphering.<br>
Since in many known transmission systems, especially packet data systems, transmitted packets or frames are containing a session sequence number, the order number of the<br>
cryptography method can easily be associated with the order number used for the transmission session.<br>
Thereby, there is no need for synchronisation during the communication session. Although packets may not be received in consecutive order, they may still be deciphered according to the predetermined list of one-time keys Pa1 - Pan.<br>
Advantageously, the list of one-time keys RC'stream#1, RC'stream#2.... RC'stream#n in the array Pa1, Pa2, Pan are computed on both the sender side and the receiver side, whereby transmission session order numbers 1 - n are associated to the array order numbers Pa1, Pa2, Pan. A given plaintext is recovered according to the given order a given ciphertext C is received in a given communication session, by retrieving a respective computed one time key RC'stream#1, RC'stream#2..   RC'stream#n with the associated transmission session order number of the array on the receiver side.<br>
Advantageously the packet buffer list may be computed before a communication session is commenced, but the creation of the list may also be performed intermittently with the transmission of packets as shown in the timing diagram of fig. 8. As soon as the bulfei has reached an appropriate size to handle incoming ciphertext, the calculation of additional one-time keys may be carried out as processor power is available.<br>
In fig. 8, the timing diagram pertaining to the above cryptography method has been shown. At the sender side, S, an initial packet P and an initial initialisation vector aie commenced issued at time tO.<br>
Subsequently, new plaintext packets are issued and new initialisation vectors are genei-ated according to the RC function.<br>
As soon as the first initialisation vector is issued the computation of the list of one-time keys and the subsequent storing in the packet data buffer can be commenced. As shown in fig. 8, from time t1, respective one time keys RC'stream#1, RC'stream#2, RCstream#3 are computed and stored in the packet array at order numbers Pa1, Pa2 and Pa3.<br>
The same applies to the receiver side, here the initialisation vector and the one-time keys are commenced computed immediately after the communication process is inti ated.<br>
Hence, a number of one time keys RC'stream#1, RC'stream#2, RCstream#3 are pieva-lent at the sender side and the receiver side at an early stage in the communication ses-sion These one-time keys are ready to be used irrespective of the order the actual packets may be transmitted and hence independently of the progression of the communication session.<br>
At t2 the ciphertext C1 is issued and subsequently at t.3 the plaintext P1 is recovered Although it would be advantageous to calculate and store one-time keys both on the sender side and the receiver side, it would, depending on the available processing power available in the communication unit at either the receiver and the sender side, be possible to compute the array on only one side<br>
It appears that by using an OTP (One Time Password/Dynamic password) scheme, with the initial Pswdl negotiated during session setup/ authentication, a changing initialisation vector can be used without having to openly synchronise it over the network. Moreover, as initialisation vectors are not sent over the communication channel as overhead, the capacity of the communication channel can be devoted to content while security is retained at a high level.<br>
The invention is both applicable to stream cipher modes and block cipher modes.<br>
To efficiently cope with packet losses each packet can optionally be equipped with a sequence number modulo window size (as little as 4 bits give support for 15 lost packets), or an already existing sequence number (if protocol characteristics are known) can be reused to save bandwidth.<br>
As the initialisation vectors and the one time keys can be pre-computed before packet arrival, it is alsopossible to pre-compute the stream cipher bit-streams Consequently, the potentially computationally heavy random bit sequence bit-streams can be computed in low priority mode before the data has arrived. When data arrives, there is only need to XOR the data with the stored bit stream to regain the plaintext Optionally, the sequence number can be checked for consistency, to detect possible packet loss<br>
The above method allows for an efficient and secure sending of encrypted packets, specifically over bandwidth limited communication links as no explicit transfer of initialisation vectors take place.<br>
The specific exploitation of the ability to pre-compute initialisation vector's (keys) makes it possible to achieve high throughput on limited devices.<br>
Normal stream cipher encryption often requires frequent changing of keys to prevent known plain text attacks. According to the invention, keys can be changed every packet thus improving security.<br>
The random bit sequence generators, RC and RC, could be based on the HMAC-SHA-1, in output feedback mode, or any block cipher in OFB, such as DES or any other construct suitable as a PRNG could be used.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
