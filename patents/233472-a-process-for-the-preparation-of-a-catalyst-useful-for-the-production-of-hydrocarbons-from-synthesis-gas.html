				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a catalyst, useful<br>
for the production of hydrocarbons from synthesis gas. The present invention<br>
particularly relates to the preparation of a catalyst for the production of wax from<br>
synthesis gas.<br>
The catalyst of the present invention finds usage in synthesising hydrocarbons,<br>
particularly wax, using Fisher-Tropsch synthesis.<br>
Synthesis gas, or "syngas", is a mixture of gases prepared as feedstock for a<br>
chemical reaction; for example, carbon monoxide and hydrogen to make<br>
hydrocarbons or organic chemicals, or hydrogen and nitrogen to make ammonia.<br>
The studies on synthetic hydrocarbon production from synthesis gas have been<br>
initiated since1902. Investigations are on world wide to improve the productivity<br>
and selectivity of the catalyst necessary for the process. Mainly metals from<br>
group VIII of the periodic table such as iron, cobalt, nickel, platinum, ruthenium<br>
are used to prepare a catalyst for the process. Out of all these metals mentioned<br>
to prepare a suitable catalyst for the production of hydrocarbons with high yield of<br>
wax fraction from synthesis gas, iron is the cheapest, is active with hydrogen /<br>
carbon monoxide ratio of the feed synthesis gas around 1, which is obtained by<br>
coal gasification and available in plenty. Iron metal in combination with one or<br>
more elements like copper, calcium, magnesium, potassium are used in the<br>
preparation of the catalyst for the production of hydrocarbons containing wax<br>
fraction. Such catalysts additionally incorporate silica or kieselghur, a naturally<br>
occurring siliceous material as catalyst support. Thus, earlier such a catalyst e.g<br>
iron incorporating copper and potassium used to be prepared from the nitrate<br>
solution of iron and copper and co-precipitating them with sodium / potassium<br>
carbonate over silica or kieselghur. The important ingredient silica / kieselghur<br>
have certain limitations. Silica preparation is a laborious method and kieselghur<br>
being a naturally occurring siliceous material is not available everywhere. The<br>
yield of wax from synthesis gas using silica or kieselghur supported iron catalyst<br>
in the fixed bed reactor system has been reported as low.<br>
The conversion of synthesis gas obtained from carbonaceous source like coal,<br>
natural gas, associated gas, refinery of gas, bio-gas to synthetic hydrocarbons is<br>
a versatile process. By using group VII metals in combination with elements from<br>
certain other groups as catalyst and wide range of operating conditions such as<br>
temperature in the range of 100 to 400 degree Celsius, pressure in the range of 1<br>
to 1000 kg per square centimeter, space velocity in the range of 100 to 30000<br>
per hour and hydrogen / carbon monoxide ratio in the range of 0.5 to 3.5; a wide<br>
variety of end products like methane, iso-paraffins, synthetic liquid fuels, wax,<br>
methanol, higher alcohols can be obtained.<br>
Reference may be made to U.S. patent no. 4086262, which describes the use of<br>
a catalyst obtained by mixing mechanically the carbon monoxide reducing<br>
catalyst and a specified zeolite used in the two-stage process.<br>
Single stage processes for producing hydrocarbons selectively with a specified<br>
boiling point range from synthesis gas have been reported. Reference may be<br>
made to another U.S. patent no. 4157338, which describes the use of a catalyst<br>
obtained by supporting a carbon monoxide reducing metal or metal oxide on a<br>
specified zeolite.<br>
In the above reffered processes, the product is limited by the shape selectivity of<br>
a zeolite with specified pores as a constitutional component of the catalyst so<br>
that products having a larger molecular size than the pore diameter are hardly<br>
formed and hydrocarbons having a smaller molecular size and boiling point<br>
range of gasoline or less can selectively be obtained.<br>
The one-stage process is a more economical process than the two-stage<br>
process because of its simplified process. However, the above described onestage<br>
process using the mechanically mixed catalyst is inferior to the two-stage<br>
process because of the catalytic defects that the conversion of carbon monoxide<br>
and the yield of gasoline are low and there is formed a large amount of methane<br>
which is only estimated as a fuel gas.<br>
In another one-stage process using the catalyst obtained by supporting a metal<br>
capable of exhibiting a Fischer-Tropsch activity on a particular zeolite aims at<br>
subjecting the synthesis gas to a Fischer-Tropsch reaction by the metallic<br>
component in the catalytic composition to form a hydrocarbon mixture distributed<br>
from methane to waxes as an intermediate and then converting these<br>
hydrocarbons into hydrocarbons having a boiling point range of gasoline or less<br>
by the shape selectivity zeolite known to be effective for cracking waxes, i.e.<br>
ZSM-5 catalyst. This catalyst is not useful because it loses the activity through<br>
heating at a temperature above 300 degree Celsius in an oxidizing atmosphere<br>
and thus it cannot be regenerated.<br>
Reference may be made to US Patent No.4622308, wherein an improved<br>
catalyst suitable for use in the production of hydrocarbons from the synthesis gas<br>
has been described which comprises an iron-containing Fischer-Tropsch<br>
catalyst, a zeolite and at least one metal selected from the group consisting of<br>
ruthenium, rhodium, platinum, palladium, iridium, cobalt and molybdenum. This<br>
catalyst gives a high CO conversion and hydrocarbons enriched with C5+<br>
gasoline fraction.<br>
Reference may be made to US Patent No.4665042, wherein a catalyst system<br>
has been described which is suitable for the conversion of synthesis gas to<br>
hydrocarbons, more particularly to a catalyst system comprising a coppercontaining<br>
component together with an iron-containing component and a wax<br>
cracking component such as a Zeolite. However a significant proportion of the<br>
hydrocarbon product is in the form of methane rather than wax and this is a<br>
disadvantage because the present need is wax, mainly.<br>
Reference may be made to US Patent No.4086262, wherein a process is<br>
disclosed for the conversion of synthesis gas using a single stage process<br>
wherein the catalyst is a mixture of (i) a carbon monoxide reducing catalyst such<br>
as a methanol catalyst or an iron-containing Fischer-Tropsch catalyst and (ii) a<br>
ZSM-5 type Zeolite. However, the products described in this patent contain<br>
significant amounts of gaseous hydrocarbons, particularly methane which in all<br>
cases exceeds 10 percent by weight of the hydrocarbon product.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
preparation of a catalyst, useful for the production of hydrocarbons from<br>
synthesis gas, which obviates the drawbacks of the hitherto known prior art as<br>
detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation<br>
of an improved iron catalyst using alternative naturally occurring siliceous<br>
material, bentonite as support in place of silica and kieselghur to obtain wax from<br>
the synthesis gas.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
preparation of a catalyst having high selectivity.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
preparation of a catalyst of high yielding nature.<br>
Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process which is<br>
simple and environment friendly.<br>
In the present invention there is provided a process for the preparation of a<br>
catalyst, useful for the production of hydrocarbons from synthesis gas, which<br>
involves heating at a temperature in the range of 70 to 85 degree Celsius, under<br>
constant stirring, an aqueous solution of a mix of 86 to 96 wt % ferric nitrate, 1 to<br>
10 wt % copper nitrate and 1 to 4 wt % manganese nitrate. Addition of preheated<br>
sodium carbonate solution to the resulting mixture of aqueous solutions of<br>
nitrates at a temperature in the range of 70 to 85 degree Celsius under constant<br>
stirring till it becomes neutral. Continuing the addition of sodium carbonate and<br>
simultaneously adding pre-heated bentonite slowly, under stirring, till the pH of<br>
the solution reaches between 8 and 9. Continuing the stirring for a time period in<br>
the range of 20 to 40 minutes after addition of sodium carbonate is stopped.<br>
Filtering the precipitate and washing the same with warm water till the washings<br>
are nitrate free. Addition of potassium hydroxide to the precipitate followed by<br>
thorough kneading to ensure uniform distribution of the potassium salt. Drying<br>
the resultant product at a temperature in the range of 70 to 90 degree Celsius for<br>
a time period in the range of 10 to 16 hours in an air oven. Cooling the resultant<br>
product to room temperature. Extruding to at least V4" size. Drying the extrudes at<br>
105±5 degree Celsius for a time period in the range of 20 to 30 hours and sizing<br>
to at least +6 to -14 mesh BSS.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a<br>
catalyst, useful for the production of hydrocarbons from synthesis gas which<br>
comprises heating under constant stirring an aqueous solution of a mixture of<br>
ferric nitrate in the range of 86 to 96 wt %, copper nitrate in the range of 1 to 10<br>
wt % and manganese nitrate in the range of 1 to 4 wt %, at a temperature in the<br>
range of 70 to 85 degree Celsius; adding pre-heated sodium carbonate solution<br>
to the resulting mixture at a temperature in the range of 70 to 85 degree Celsius<br>
under constant stirring till it becomes neutral; continuing the addition of sodium<br>
carbonate solution and simultaneously adding pre-heated bentonite slowly, under<br>
stirring, till the pH of the solution reaches between 8 and 9; continuing the stirring<br>
for a time period in the range of 20 to 40 minutes after addition of sodium<br>
carbonate is stopped; filtering the precipitate and washing the same with warm<br>
water till the washings are nitrate free; adding potassium hydroxide to the<br>
precipitate followed by thorough kneading to ensure uniform distribution of the<br>
potassium salt; drying the resultant product at a temperature in the range of 70 to<br>

drying the extrudes at 105 ±5 degree Celsius for a time period in the range of 20<br>
to 30 hours and sizing to at least +6 to -14 mesh BSS.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the aqueous solutions of the nitrates<br>
are made with de-mineralised water.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the amount of de-mineralised<br>
water used is in the range of 4 to 6 times of the total amount of nitrates (w/w).<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the sodium carbonate*<br>
solution used is of at least 3.5 molar.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the bentonite is pre-heated<br>
at a temperature in the range of 350 to 500 degree Celsius for a time period in<br>
the range of 1 to 3 hours.<br>
In still yet another embodiment of the present invention, brown ring test is<br>

The novelty of the present invention resides in providing a process for the<br>
preparation of a catalyst, useful for the production of hydrocarbons from<br>
synthesis gas, wherein the process is simple and environment friendly and the<br>
catalyst obtained is of high yielding nature and has high selectivity.<br>
The novelty of the present invention has been achieved by the non-obvious<br>
inventive step wherein naturally occuring siliceous material, bentonite has been<br>
incorporated as support in place of silica and kieselghur, in an environment<br>
friendly manner unlike prior art processes<br>
The non-obvious inventive process step of using naturally occurring siliceous<br>
material, bentonite as support in place of silica and kieselghur, has made it<br>
possible for the present invention to provide a novel simple and environment<br>
friendly process for the preparation of an improved iron catalyst of high yielding<br>
nature and having high selectivity to obtain wax from synthesis gas.<br>
The details of the process steps of the present invention are:<br>
1. Preparing an aqueous solution of a mix of 86 to 96 wt % ferric nitrate, 1 to<br>
10 wt % copper nitrate and 1 to 4 wt % manganese nitrate in demineralised<br>
water of amount which is 4 to 6 times of the total amount of<br>
nitrates (w/w).<br>
2. Heating the aqueous solution nitrates, obtained in step 1, under constant<br>
stirring at a temperature in the range of 70 to 85 degree Celsius.<br>
3. Adding pre-heated sodium carbonate solution, of at least 3.5 molar, to the<br>
resulting mixture of heated aqueous solution of nitrates at a temperature in<br>
the range of 70 to 85 degree Celsius under constant stirring till it becomes<br>
neutral.<br>
4. Continuing the addition of sodium carbonate and simultaneously adding<br>
under stirring pre-heated bentonite slowly till the pH of the solution<br>
reaches between 8 and 9. The bentonite is pre-heated to a temperature in<br>
the range of 350 to 500 degree Celsius for a time period in the range of 1<br>
to 3 hours.<br>
5. After addition of sodium carbonate is stopped, the stirring is continued for<br>
a time period in the range of 20 to 40 minutes.<br>
6. Filtering the precipitate and washing the same with warm water having<br>
temperature of around 50 degree Celsius till the washings are nitrate free.<br>
Brown ring test is performed to check for the presence of nitrate in the<br>
washings.<br>

11. Drying the extrudes at a temperature of 105+5 degree Celsius for a time<br>
period in the range of 20 to 30 hours.<br>
12. Sizing to at least +6 to -14 mesh BSS.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the process in actual<br>
practice and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example-1<br>
750 grams of ferric nitrate, 79.1 grams of copper nitrate and 22 grams of<br>
manganese nitrate were weighed separately and dissolved together in 4522 ml of<br>
de-mineralised water. This nitrate solution was heated to 80 degree Celsius<br>
under constant stirring. 1200 ml of 3.5 molar sodium carbonate solution was<br>
heated to 80 degree Celsius separately and was added to the nitrate solution at<br>
80 degree Celsius under constant stirring. When solution became neutral, 31.2<br>
grams of bentonite, which was pre-heated earlier to 450 degree Celsius for 2<br>
hours, was added slowly under stirring while the addition of sodium carbonate<br>
continued till pH was in between 8 and 9.<br>
At this stage, addition of sodium carbonate was stopped and stirring continued<br>
for 30 minutes. The precipitate was filtered and washed with warm water ( 50<br>
degree Celsius ) till it was nitrate free. The nitrate test was carried out by the<br>
brown ring test.<br>
To this nitrate free mass, 6 grams of potassium hydroxide was added and the<br>
precipitate was kneaded thoroughly for uniform distribution of the potassium salt.<br>
The final product was dried at 80 degree Celsius for 14 hours in an air oven. It<br>
was cooled to room temperature and extruded to 1/4" size extrudates which were<br>
further dried at 105 ± 5 degree Celsius for 26 hours. The extrudates were sized<br>
to +6 to-14 mesh BSS.<br>
Example-2<br>
725 grams of ferric nitrate, 8.2 grams of copper nitrate and 23 grams of<br>
manganese nitrate were weighed separately and dissolved together in 4522 ml of<br>
de-mineralised water. This nitrate solution was heated to 85 degree Celsius<br>
under constant stirring. 1200 ml of 3.5 molar sodium carbonate solution was<br>
heated to 85 degree Celsius separately and was added to the nitrate solution at<br>
85 degree Celsius under constant stirring. When solution became neutral, 31.2<br>
grams of bentonite, which was preheated earlier to 450 degree Celsius for 2<br>
hours, was added slowly under stirring while the addition of sodium carbonate<br>
continued till pH was in between 8 and 9.<br>
At this stage, addition of sodium carbonate was stopped and stirring continued<br>
for 30 minutes. The precipitate was filtered and washed with warm water ( 50<br>
degree Celsius ) till it was nitrate free. The nitrate test was carried out by the<br>
brown ring test.<br>
To this nitrate free mass, 6 grams of potassium hydroxide was added and the<br>
precipitate was kneaded thoroughly for uniform distribution of the potassium salt.<br>
The final product was dried at 85 degree Celsius for 14 hours in an air oven. It<br>
was cooled to room temperature and extruded to 1/4" size extrudates which were<br>
further dried at 105 ± 5 degree Celsius for 26 hours. The extrudates were siz.ed<br>
to +6 to -14 mesh BSS.<br>
Example-3<br>
750 grams of ferric nitrate, 79.1 grams of copper nitrate and 22 grams of<br>
manganese nitrate were weighed separately and dissolved together in 4522 ml of<br>
de-mineralised water. This nitrate solution was heated to 75 degree Celsius<br>
under constant stirring. 1200 ml of 3.5 molar sodium carbonate solution was<br>
heated to 75 degree Celsius separately and was added to the nitrate solution at<br>
75 degree Celsius under constant stirring. When solution became neutral, 31.2<br>
grams of bentonite, which was preheated earlier to 450 degree Celsius for 2<br>
hours, was added slowly under stirring while the addition of sodium carbonate<br>
continued till pH was in between 8 &amp; 9.<br>
At this stage, addition of sodium carbonate was stopped and stirring continued<br>
for 30 minutes. The precipitate was filtered and washed with warm water ( 50<br>
degree Celsius ) till it was nitrate free. The nitrate test was carried out by the<br>
brown ring test.<br>
To this nitrate free mass, 5 grams of potassium hydroxide was added and the<br>
precipitate was kneaded thoroughly for uniform distribution of the potassium salt.<br>
The final product was dried at 75 degree Celsius for 14 hours in an air oven. It<br>
was cooled to room temperature and extruded to 1/4" size extrudates which were<br>
further dried at 105 ± 5 degree Celsius for 23 hours. The extrudates were sized<br>
to =6 -14 mesh BSS.<br>
