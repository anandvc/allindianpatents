				<td>Background of the Invention:<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a system for conveying goods<br>
by way of a self-contained conveyor belt which, in the end<br>
stations, is guided over reversing pulleys and which is<br>
constructed with load-bearing rollers which can be moved along<br>
load-bearing cables.<br>
Such a system is disclosed in my commonly assigned, prior U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,791,454 and its corresponding European patent<br>
application EP 0 745 545 A2. There, the conveyor belt is<br>
constructed with load-bearing beams aligned transversely<br>
thereto, at the ends of which load-bearing rollers are mounted<br>
which can be moved along load-bearing cables provided in the<br>
system. Known such systems are advantageous since long span<br>
widths can be achieved by way of the load-bearing cables. In<br>
this way, the erection of a large number of load-bearing<br>
frames can be dispensed with in these systems. Furthermore,<br>
in this way, such systems can also be erected in<br>
topographically unfavorable situations. In particular, with<br>
such systems it is possible to effect the conveyance of goods<br>
over obstacles, such as valleys or rivers, in a<br>
straightforward manner.<br>
However, the prior systems are disadvantageous inasmuch as<br>
they require two load-bearing cables for both runs of the<br>
conveyor belt, which have to be supported and braced and means<br>
that a great deal of expenditure on construction is caused by<br>
the erection of these systems.<br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>
It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide an<br>
installation for conveying goods with a continuous conveyor<br>
belt which overcomes the above-mentioned disadvantages of<br>
the heretofore-known devices and methods of this general<br>
type and which further simplifies such a system in design<br>
terms without thereby reducing or impairing its functional<br>
capabilities.<br>
With the foregoing and other objects in view the present<br>
invention provides a system for conveying goods with a<br>
self-contained conveyor belt comprising : end stations each<br>
having a reversing pulley ; a self-contained conveyor belt<br>
movably disposed to travel between said end stations in at<br>
least two runs and to be guided over said reversing<br>
pulleys ; a plurality of load-bearing brackets mounted to<br>
said conveyor belt and projecting generally upwardly from<br>
said conveyor belt ; load-bearing rollers mounted to said<br>
load-bearing brackets ; load-bearing cables extending<br>
between said end stations, a respective one of said load-<br>
bearing cables supporting said conveyor belt along a<br>
respective one of said runs via said load-bearing rollers.<br>
In other words, each run of the conveyor belt is assigned<br>
only a single load-bearing cable located above the relevant<br>
run and upwardly-projecting load-bearing brackets are fixed<br>
to the conveyor belt, at the upper ends of which brackets<br>
the load-bearing rollers rolling along the load-bearing<br>
cables are mounted.<br>
The reversing pulleys located in the end stations can<br>
preferably be rotated about approximately vertical axes.<br>
Moreover, the conveyor belt is preferably constructed with<br>
corrugated edges.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the load-bearing brackets<br>
are designed to be angled over, the approximately horizontally<br>
aligned leg being firmly connected to the conveyor belt and at<br>
least one load-bearing roller being mounted at the upper end<br>
of the second leg projecting upward from this leg.<br>
Furthermore, in the end stations there are preferably provided<br>
guide rails which are assigned to the load-bearing rollers and<br>
by means of which the load-bearing brackets are guided such<br>
that the conveyor belt is pivoted from its approximately<br>
horizontal position into an approximately vertical position,<br>
wherein it is moved around the reversing pulleys, whereupon it<br>
is pivoted into the approximately horizontal position again,<br>
the conveying side of the conveyor belt being oriented upward<br>
in both runs. Furthermore, a guide plate produced in<br>
particular from rubber is preferably provided on each load-<br>
bearing bracket, underneath the load-bearing roller.<br>
Moreover, in the region of the supports, the load-bearing<br>
cables are preferably guided over supporting blocks which can<br>
be moved in the longitudinal direction of the load-bearing<br>
cables and, in the region of the supports, the conveyor belt<br>
is guided over supporting rolls.<br>
Other features which are considered as characteristic for the<br>
invention are set forth in the appended claims.<br>
Although the invention is illustrated and described herein as<br>
embodied in a system for conveying goods by means of a self-<br>
contained conveyor belt, it is nevertheless not intended to be<br>
limited to the details shown, since various modifications and<br>
structural changes may be made therein without departing from<br>
the spirit of the invention and within the scope and range of<br>
equivalents of the claims.<br>
The construction and method of operation of the invention,<br>
however, together with additional objects and advantages<br>
thereof will be best understood from the following description<br>
of specific embodiments when read in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

Description of the Preferred Embodiments;<br>
Referring now to the figures of the drawing in detail and<br>
first, particularly, to Fig. 1 thereof, a system according to<br>
the invention for conveying goods comprises two end stations<br>
1, between which an endless, i.e., self-contained conveyor<br>
belt 2 for the transport of bulk goods (e.g., building<br>
materials, waste materials, ores, etc.) can be moved. One of<br>
the end stations is thereby used as a loading station and the<br>
other end station is used as an unloading station. Assigned<br>
to the two runs of the conveyor belt 2 are two load-bearing<br>
cables 3a, 3b. The conveyor belt 2 is carried and moved by<br>
load-bearing rollers 4 which roll on the load-bearing cables 3<br>
and which are mounted on load-bearing brackets 5. Provided in<br>
the end stations 1 and along the section are load-bearing<br>
frames 6, over which the conveyor belt 2 and the load-bearing<br>
cables 4 are guided. Moreover, in the end stations 1, the<br>
conveyor belt 2 is guided over reversing pulleys 7 which can<br>
be rotated about vertically aligned axes. In this case, at<br>
least one of the reversing pulleys 7 is driven by means of a<br>
drive motor.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 2, the conveyor belt 2 is constructed<br>
with corrugated edges 21, or sidewalls 21. On account of the<br>
guidance carried out in the end stations 1 of the conveyor<br>
belt 2 over the reversing pulleys 7 that can be rotated about<br>
vertical axes, the two runs 2a and 2b of the conveyor belt 2<br>
are at the same vertical level. The load-bearing brackets 5<br>
are angled over approximately in an L shape, the approximately<br>
horizontal legs 51 being firmly connected to the conveyor belt<br>
2 and the load-bearing rollers 4, which roll on the load-<br>
bearing cable 3a, 3b assigned to the respective run 2a, 2b,<br>
being mounted at the upper end of the legs 52 projecting<br>
obliquely upward. Also fixed to the upwardly projecting legs<br>
52 of the load-bearing brackets 5 are transversely projecting<br>
guide plates 53, which are located underneath the load-bearing<br>
rollers 4 and which are used to prevent cable derailments.<br>
The guide plates 53, which are produced from rubber, have a<br>
high rigidity with respect to loadings in the direction of<br>
their plane, which means that they ensure the guidance of the<br>
running rollers 4 on the load-bearing cables 3a, 3b. By<br>
contrast, they can be bent elastically out of their plane,<br>
which ensures that the running rollers 4 can be lifted off the<br>
load-bearing cables 3a, 3b in the end stations.<br>
As can be seen in particular from Figs. 3 to 6, in the end<br>
stations 1 the conveyor belt 2 is guided over in each case a<br>
reversing pulley 7 that can be rotated about a vertical axis.<br>
In the process, the run 2b of the conveyor belt 2 moved toward<br>
the reversing pulley 7 is pivoted out of the horizontal plane<br>
into a vertical plane and is moved around the reversing pulley<br>
7 in this position. The run 2a of the conveyor belt 2 moved<br>
away from the reversing pulley 7 is subsequently pivoted into<br>
the horizontal plane again. In this case, the pivoting actions<br>
are carried out in such a manner that the conveying side of<br>
the conveyor belt 2 is oriented upward in both runs 2b and 2a.<br>
The two load-bearing cables 3a, 3b are braced in the<br>
foundations 10 of the end station.<br>
In the end stations 1, guide rails 8 assigned to the load-<br>
bearing rollers 4 are provided, by means of which the pivoting<br>
of the conveyor belt 2 in the regions of the end stations 1 of<br>
the system is controlled. In addition, in the regions between<br>
the load-bearing frames 6 and the reversing pulleys 7, between<br>
the two load-bearing cables 3a and 3b, a supporting beam 31 is<br>
provided, by means of which the two cables 3a and 3b are kept<br>
at a distance from each other in such a way that the space<br>
required for the guide rail 8 is available between them and,<br>
moreover, during the pivoting of the conveyor belt 2 and also<br>
the brackets 5 fixed to the latter and the load-bearing<br>
rollers 4 mounted on said brackets, the load-bearing rollers 4<br>
are prevented from colliding with the load-bearing cables 3a,<br>
3b.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 6 to Fig. 8, supporting blocks 61 are<br>
provided in the load-bearing frames 6, over which supporting<br>
blocks the load-bearing cables 3a and 3b are guided and by<br>
means of which the vertical position of the latter is<br>
determined. The supporting blocks 61 are in this case<br>
arranged on load-bearing trestles 62, which can be moved in<br>
the direction of the load-bearing cables 3a, 3b by means of<br>
running rollers 63. In this way, the cable forces occurring<br>
on the two sides of the supports 6 are balanced. Supporting<br>
blocks of this type are provided in all the load-bearing<br>
frames 6.<br>
Furthermore, a plurality of supporting rolls 64 are mounted in<br>
all the load-bearing frames 6, over which rolls the two runs<br>
2a, 2b of the conveyor belt 2 are guided, which determines the<br>
vertical position of the conveyor belt 2. The supporting<br>
rolls 64 support the two runs 2a and 2b of the conveyor belt<br>
2, which means that the loadings caused by the conveyor belt 2<br>
are absorbed directly by the load-bearing frames 6. In this<br>
way, the load-bearing rollers 4 are relieved of load. In<br>
addition, the run 2a of the conveyor belt 2 moving toward the<br>
reversing pulley 7 is raised in the region of the load-bearing<br>
frame 6. The guide rails 8 provided in the end stations begin<br>
and end above the supporting blocks 61 and the supporting<br>
rolls 64. Together with the conveyor belt 2, the load-bearing<br>
rollers 4 are also raised, as a result of which they are<br>
lifted off the load-bearing cable 3a and are led into the<br>
guide rails 8 by means of which they are guided during their<br>
movement through the end stations 1. Likewise, the load-<br>
bearing rollers 4 running out of the guide rails 8 are also<br>
guided by this means such that they pass on to the load-<br>
bearing cable 3b resting on the supporting blocks 61.<br>
As can further be seen from Fig. 8, during the movement into<br>
the end stations 1, the guide plates 53 run onto the<br>
supporting blocks 61, by which means they are bent out of<br>
their plane. In this way, they are moved away from the load-<br>
bearing cable 3a, which means that the load-bearing rollers 4<br>
can be lifted off the load-bearing cable 3a. Likewise, the<br>
guide plates 53 moved away from the end stations 1 are firstly<br>
bent over by the supporting blocks 61 and subsequently pass<br>
under the load-bearing cable 3b again. The supporting blocks<br>
61 provided on the load-bearing frames 6 located along the<br>
section act in the same way.<br>
By means of the guide rails 8, the pivoting movement of the<br>
conveyor belt 2 from its horizontal position into its vertical<br>
position and, following this, into the horizontal position<br>
again is controlled. In the process, the pivoting movement of<br>
the conveyor belt 2 is carried out in such a way that, even in<br>
the run of the conveyor belt 2 moving back from the unloading<br>
station to the loading station, its conveying side is oriented<br>
upward. This ensures that proportions of the conveyed goods<br>
remaining on the conveyor belt 2 remain on the returning run<br>
of the conveyor belt 2, which means that measures to protect<br>
the regions underneath the conveyor system can be dispensed<br>
with.<br>
In addition, it is pointed out that the side walls of the<br>
conveyor belt do not need to be constructed as corrugated<br>
edges. Instead, they can, for example, also be constructed<br>
with continuous slots going from top to bottom, as a result of<br>
which they can likewise be moved around the reversing pulleys.<br>
Furthermore, a conveyor system of this type can also be<br>
constructed in such a way that both end stations are designed<br>
both as a loading station and as an unloading station, the<br>
conveyance of goods in both directions of movement of the<br>
conveyor belt being carried out by means of the two runs.<br>
