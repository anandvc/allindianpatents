				<td>The invention relates to amido-containing<br>
organosilicon cambounds, their preparation and their<br>
use.<br>
Conventionally aminosilicone emulsions or<br>
cationic softeners or mixtures thereof are used in the<br>
softening treatment of textiles and garments, by-<br>
exhaust or padding method. But such softeners apart<br>
from not being easily biodegradable have some undesir-<br>
able effects on the fabric after treatment as discussed<br>
hereunder:<br>
(i) Cationic softener has softening effect but it<br>
doesn't have permanent anchorage to the textile.<br>
Moreover these cationic softeners are alkaline in<br>
 nature, thus causing yellowing of the textile.<br>
(ii) Conventional aminosilicone emulsion has good<br>
softening effect as well as permanent bond to the<br>
fabric but causes yellowing of fabric.<br>
(iii) Mixtures of aminosilicone emulsion and cationic<br>
softener have a good to moderate softening effect<br>
but high alkalinity of such mixtures also causes<br>
yellowing of the textile. Also, because they are<br>
mixtures of cationic softener and conventional<br>
aminosilicone emulsion, they provide less<br>
anchorage to the textile because of their<br>
cationic component.<br>
US-A 4,104,296 (Union Carbide Corporation,<br>
issued 1 August 1978) and US-A 3.440,261 (Dow Corning<br>
Corporation, issued 22 April 1969) describe amido-<br>

textiles. It is a further object to provide organo-<br>
silicon compounds that can be present both in liquid<br>
and in solid form, that are readily emulsifiable and<br>
capable of forming (micro) emulsions and that , are<br>

where R and Y are each as defined above,<br>
g is 0, 1 or 2,<br>
n is 0 or an integer from 1 to 1000,<br>

may additionally contain amino groups, i.e. units of<br>
the formula (II), and the organopolysiloxanes" of the<br>
formula (IV) may additionally contain SiRXO units, if<br>
the X amino groups in the organopolysiloxanes of the<br>
formula (III) were not all converted into Y amido<br>
groups, for example because the reaction with fatty<br>
acids (2) was carried out substoichiometrically or did<br>

particularly preferably 16 to 20 carbon atoms, i.e. are<br>
preferably fatty acids of the formula R2COOH, where R2<br>
is as defined above. Saturated or unsaturated fatty<br>
acids or glycerides thereof can be used. One kind of<br>
fatty acid or two or more kinds of fatty acids may be<br>
used. The glycerides can be glycerol esters of mixtures<br>
of various fatty acids. Examples of fatty acids are<br>
palmitic acid (C16) , stearic acid (C18) , oleic acid<br>
(C18) , linoleic acid (C18) , linolenic acid (C18) ,<br>
hexacosanoic acid (C26) and glycerides thereof, for<br>
example glycerol monostearate. It is further possible<br>
to use vegetable oils, such as safflower oil, sesame<br>
oil, soybean oil, maize oil, sunflower seed oil, olive<br>
oil, palm oil, coconut oil and castor oil.<br>
Depending on the molecular weight and the<br>
number of X amino groups in the organosilicon compounds<br>
(1) used, saturated fatty acids, such as stearic acid,<br>
or glycerides, such as glycerol monostearate, are<br>
preferably used to obtain the organosilicon compounds<br>
of the invention in solid form, for example as waxes,<br>
and unsaturated fatty acids, preferably polyunsaturated<br>
fatty acids, such as linoleic acid or linolenic acid,<br>
or the abovementioned vegetable oils are preferably<br>
used to obtain the organosilicon compounds of the<br>
invention in liquid form.<br>
The process of the invention utilizes the fatty<br>
acids (2) or the glycerol esters of these fatty acids<br>
in such amounts that the acid group in the fatty acid<br>
(2) is present in a molar ratio of preferably 0.1:1 to<br>
1.2:1, more preferably 0.5:1 to 1.0:1, to N-attached<br>
hydrogen in the X radical of the c ganosilicon compound<br>
(1).<br>
The process of the invention is carried out at<br>
a temperature of preferably 120Â°C to 180Â°C, more<br>
preferably -130Â°C to 150Â°C, and preferably at the<br>
pressure of the ambient atmosphere, i.e. at 1020 hPa<br>
(absolute). However, the process of the invention can<br>
also be carried out at lower pressures, such as 3 to<br>
500 hPa, or higher pressures.<br>
The process of the invention can be carried out<br>
in the presence or absence of an organic solvent.<br>
Examples of organic solvents are toluene, xylene,<br>
n-hexane and cyclohexane.<br>
The water formed in the process of the<br>
invention can be removed, preferably by azeotropic dis-<br>
tillation, in which case the azeotropic distillation<br>
can be carried out in the presence of a water-removing<br>
agent, such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.<br>
The organosilicon compounds of the invention<br>
can be emulsified and are then present in the form of<br>
(micro)emulsions. The emulsions are prepared by the<br>
organosilicon compounds of the invention being mixed<br>
with emulsifiers, such as neutral or ionic emulsifiers,<br>
and water and subsequently emulsified. The preparation<br>
of emulsions is known to one skilled in the art. The<br>
mixing and emulsifying can be carried out in customary<br>
mixing apparatus suitable for preparing emulsions, such<br>
as high-speed stator-rotor stirrers after Professor<br>
P. Willems of the kind known under the registered<br>
trademark "Ultra-Turrax".<br>
The organosilicon compounds of the invention<br>
have the advantage of being biodegradable and<br>
environmentally friendly<br>
The invention further provides a process for<br>
impregnating organic fibres with the organosilicon<br>
compounds of the invention. The organosilicon compounds<br>
of the invention can be used, preferably in liquid<br>
form, as softeners for textiles, in which case the<br>
textiles are impregnated with the organosilicon<br>
compounds of the invention. The organosilicon compounds<br>
of the invention have the advantage of imparting a soft<br>
hand effect to the treated textiles, of possessing good<br>
anchorage on the textiles and of conferring ozone<br>
fastness and stability to yellowing on the textile<br>
fabrics.<br>
The inventive process for impregnating organic<br>
fibres can be used to impregnate all organic fibres in<br>
the form of filaments, yarns, webs, mats, strands,<br>
woven, loop-formingly knitted or loop-drawingly knitted<br>
textiles as have hitherto been impregnable with organo-<br>
silicon compounds. Examples of impregnable fibres are<br>
fibres composed of keratin, especially wool, inter-<br>
polymers of vinyl acetate, cotton, rayon, hemp, natural<br>
silk, polypropylene, polyethylene, polyester, poly-<br>
urethane, polyamide, cellulose, viscose and mixtures of<br>
at least two such fibres. As is clear from the preced-<br>
ing recitation, the fibres can be of natural or<br>
synthetic origin. The textiles can be present in the<br>
form of fabric webs or garments or parts of garments.<br>
Application to the fibres to be impregnated can<br>
be effected in any manner known to be suitable for<br>
impregnating fibres, for example by dipping, brushing,<br>
casting, spraying, including spraying from an aerosol<br>
pack, rolling, padding or printing.<br>
The organosilicon compounds of the invention<br>
can further be used as lubricants for yarn or thread<br>
finishing.<br>
The organosilicon compounds of the invention<br>
can further be used, preferably in solid form, for<br>
example in the form of a wax, as a polish or polishing<br>
agent for ceramic surfaces and coatings.<br>
The organpsilicon compounds of the invention<br>
can further be used in cosmetics.<br>
The organosilicon compounds of the invention<br>
can further be used in hair care agents.<br>
The organosilicon compounds of the invention<br>
can further be used in liquids for reprography.<br>
The objects/advantages of the present invention<br>
and the means for executing it will now be more par-<br>
ticularly described with reference to non-limiting<br>
illustrative- embodiments.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
The reactor was charged with 4000 g of a<br>
silanol-terminated polydimethylsiloxane having a visco-<br>
sity of 80 cps (25Â°C) , 272 g of y-aminoethylaminopropyl-<br>
methyldimethoxysilane, 100 g of a trimethylsiloxy-<br>
terminated siloxane having a viscosity of 10 cps (25Â°C)<br>
and 50 g of tetramethylammonium siliconate catalyst.<br>
Nitrogen purging was started in the reaction. The<br>
reactor was heated to about 110Â°C and maintained at<br>
that temperature for about 4 h. After about 4 h of<br>
reaction the temperature inside the reactor was set to<br>
150Â°C. The temperature inside the reactor was main-<br>
tained for 30 min. Vacuum was applied at 150Â°C after<br>
nitrogen purging was stopped, to obtain 510 g of<br>
volatiles. The reactor contents were cooled down to<br>
135Â°C. Next 800 g of maize oil was introduced into the<br>
reactor and purged with nitrogen. Reaction was<br>
continued for 12 hours under vacuum. This gave 4650 g<br>
of a light brown clear polymer having a viscosity of<br>
10 000 cps (25Â°C) and a volatiles content of 1.4%.<br>
Si29 NMR spectroscopy confirmed the desired structure of<br>
the polymer. The amine number of the polymer was found<br>
to be 0.3 mmol/g.<br>
Examples 2 to 4:<br>
Further examples (2, 3 and 4) were carried out<br>
using the same procedure as in Example.1. but with<br>
differente fatty acid/glycoside ratios. The resets are<br>
presented in Table 1.<br>
From Table I above it is apparent that the<br>
final polymer obtained is a liquid when unsaturated<br>
fatty acids are used and a wax when saturated fatty<br>
acid is used.<br>
Examples 5 to 12:<br>
Emulsions were made using the polymers of<br>
Examples 1 to 4 above and a conventional aminosilicone<br>
polymer having an amine number of 0.57 and a viscosity<br>
of 1300 cps at 25Â°C (designated as Example 5) as<br>
detailed under Table II. The emulsions (i.e. Examples 6<br>
to 9) as reported in Table II were all made using the<br>
same emulsifiers and differ only in the biodegradable<br>
organosilicone polymer. Example 10 is the emulsion of<br>
Example 5, again using the same emulsifiers. Example 11<br>
is a mixture of Example 5 and cationic softener.<br>
Example 12 is exclusively a catiohic softener.<br>
The soft hand characteristics of the various<br>
emulsions obtained under Examples 6 to 12 were tested<br>
as detailed hereunder.<br>
Example 13:<br>
Three different types of white textile, namely<br>
100% polyester; blend of 60% viscose/40% polyester; and<br>
100% cotton, were treated with these seven examples by<br>
padding. The padding bath was kept at 4% solid and<br>
applied at 1% pick-up. After padding, the textiles were<br>
conditioned at 160Â°C for 10 min. The thusly treated<br>
textiles were submitted to a panel of four panellists,<br>
to judge the softness, who had no idea which was<br>
treated with what.<br>
The panellists awarded the ratings reported in<br>
Table III below as per their individual feel of<br>
softness.<br>
From Table III it is clear that the new organo-<br>
silicon polymer softener (Examples 6 to 9) imparts<br>
i<br>
excellent softness compared with conventional amino-<br>
silicone or cationic softener or mixture thereof.<br>
Example 14:<br>
The new biodegradable silicone polymer of this<br>
invention was tested to determine the biodegradability<br>
of the polymer in comparison with conventional amino-<br>
silicone polymers. For the purpose of illustrating<br>
better biodegradability in wastewater streams three<br>
Examples 1, 4 and 5 were investigated. Three aqueous<br>
solutions of these examples were prepared at such a<br>
concentration that the chemical oxygen demand (COD) was<br>
initially 5000. Then, for typical wastewater treatment,<br>
2% hydrogen peroxide was added to each. At 32Â°C samples<br>
were taken at regular intervals to determine the<br>
residual COD. The values obtained are illustrated in<br>
the accompanying graph.<br>
It can be seen from Fig. 1 that the COD of<br>
Examples 1 and 4 has significantly decreased by the<br>
second day, whereas Example 5 remained at 2000 under<br>
the same conditions. This clearly reveals the low COD<br>
contents of the polymers of this invention, which<br>
demonstrates the fast biodegradability and thus the<br>
environmental friendliness of the polymer.<br>
