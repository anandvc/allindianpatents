PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION <br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner<br>
in which it is to be performed<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an internal combustion engine and more particularly this relates to lubrication system of an internal combustion engine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Internal combustion engines are generally provided with lubrication system to reduce friction between the moving parts, assist in cooling, assist in cleaning for effective operation of engine.<br>
In a lubrication system oil pump is used to pump the oil from oil sump and then provide the pressurized oil to the different parts of the engine. Engine bedplate is a structural aggregate provided below the engine block to reinforce the engine structure and it helps to reduce distortion and vibrations. Conventionally in an internal combustion engine with a bedplate, the oil pump is mounted on the bottom face of the bedplate and oil is drawn through a strainer which is connected to the oil pump by sheet metal tubing / piping. This is shown in fig. 1 in a simplified form, wherein oil strainer (1) is connected to the oil pump (4) by a pick up pipe (2). From oil pump (4), pressurized oil is supplied to the various engine parts.<br>
Usually a contemporary engine finds application on a multitude of vehicle platforms. The oil sump and as a consequence the strainer and oil pick up arrangement has to change to accommodate different axle and cross member positions on different vehicles. Therefore the length &amp; shape of the pipe connecting oil pump to the strainer/oil pick up changes as a result of the change in the oil sump. This has also been demonstrated in the fig. 1, i.e. when the shape of oil sump (6) and the position of the oil strainer (1) is changed to the (6') and (1) respectively, length of the pipe (2) also gets modified to (2).<br>
This necessitates multiple oil pick up locations and piping arrangement to suit individual vehicle requirements and it becomes difficult to support the piping to the<br><br>
 strainer/oil pick up as it moves further on from the oil pump. This is the major drawback associated with the said conventional oil pick up arrangement to the oil pump. Furthermore fatigue failures of the oil pick-up piping or strainer results in catastrophic failure of the engine.<br>
Prior Arts:<br>
Dl: US6742491 discloses about a lubrication system for small internal combustion engines. In a first aspect, a helical oil pump includes a helical insert which is disposed within a bore in the engine camshaft and is rotationally fixed with respect to the crankcase. During running of the engine, rotation of the camshaft draws oil from the off sump upwardfy through the bore fn the camshaft and around the heficaf insert to provide lubrication oil directly to the upper camshaft bearing and to the upper crankshaft bearing. In another aspect, an impeller oil pump includes a pump chamber defined between the camshaft gear and a pump body which is rotationally fixed with respect to the crankcase and in communication with the oil sump. An impeller assembly mounted on the camshaft is disposed within the pump chamber, and draws oil from the oil sump into the pump chamber. The oil is forced outwardly of the pump chamber through an opening in the camshaft gear in the form of a stream of pressurized oil which is directed toward different locations within the crankcase as the camshaft gear rotates with the camshaft.<br>
D2: EP1233153 discloses about an engine lubrication system with an arrangement in which the base of a crankcase is used to form an oil reservoir, and a part of an oil slinger that is driven by a crankshaft via transmission system is immersed in the oil within the oil reservoir. An oil pump that is driven by the transmission system is immersed in the oil within the oil reservoir, and a discharge port (50) of the oil pump communicates with a lubricating-oil passage (66) within the crankshaft. This discloses about providing a splash type lubrication system in the enginewhile at the same time using the forced type lubrication system.<br>
D3: US20020003064 discloses about a reducing the size and weight of an oil tank for a dry sump type lubricating system. A separate oil tank of a dry sump type lubricating system is mounted on the front surface of a front case cover constituting part of a crankcase divided into front and rear parts. An effective volume portion, in which oil supplied from the crankcase side via scavenging pumps and cooled by an oil cooler is contained, is provided in the oil tank. The bottom portion of the effective volume portion is connected to a feed pump on the crankcase side via an outlet side passage. A tank side pipe portion extending rearwardly through the oil tank is integrally provided at a portion of the oil tank higher than the oil level in the oil tank. The tank side pipe portion is connected to a crankcase side pipe portion integrally provided on an upper portion of the front case cover to form an overflow passage. The overflow passage functions as a pressure-equalization passage for equalizing the pressure in the oil tank with the pressure in the crankcase, and allows overflowed oil in the oil tank to readily flow into the crankcase through the upper portion of the front case cover.<br>
D4: US6029638 discloses about an internal combustion engine with dry sump lubricating system includes a feed pump which supplies lubricating oil from a lubricating oil tank disposed outside an engine body to all moving parts in the engine. After circulating through the engine, the lubricating oil drops down into a crank chamber and is immediately picked up from the crank chamber and sent back into the lubricating oil tank by a recovery pump. Since the lubricating oil tank is attached to an end of the engine body from which a crankshaft project, it does not increase the overall width (dimension in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the crankshaft) and height of the engine. Even when the engine has inclined cylinders, the lubricating oil tank can avail a high degree of design freedom because the end face is not influenced by inclination of the cylinders as greatly as side surfaces of the engine body. The engine also includes a breather system so designed as to prevent an operation failure of the engine which would otherwise be caused due to inflow of the lubricating oil into an intake system of the engine.<br>
Applicants invention is related to a Lubrication system for internal combustion engine comprises of at least one oil gallery, oil sump, a strainer, a pick up pipe, oil pump and plurality of oil passages provided in engine characterized in that said oil gallery is provided integrally in engine bedplate, said oil sump is provided below the bed plate, said oil gallery is interconnected with said pick up pipe, said strainer is provided at the end of said pick up pipe and is immersed inside the said oil sump, one end of said oil gallery is connected to said oil pump, said pump is further connected to the plurality of said oil passages to pass the pressurized lubrication oil to the desired engine locations.<br>
The above prior arts fails to provide the solution for a Lubrication system for an internal combustion engine which enables robust routing of the oil pick up to suit different locations of oil strainer.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
The main object of this invention is to provide a novel lubrication system for internal combustion engine which enables robust routing of the oil pick up to suit different locations of oil strainer.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a novel lubrication system for internal combustion engine which is simple in construction and cost effective.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Lubrication system for internal combustion engine basically comprises of oil gallery as an integral part of the engine bedplate, oil sump, a strainer, a pick up pipe, oil pump and oil passages from said pump to pass the pressurized lubrication oil to the desired locations. Said oil gallery is further interconnected with said pick up pipe. Said strainer is provided at the end of said pick up pipe and is immersed inside the said oil sump. One end of said oil gallery is connected to said oil pump.<br>
When oil pump is started it draws oil from oil sump through strainer, pick up pipe and oil gallery provided in engine bed plate and supplies pressurized oil to various desired engine locations. The main benefit of this kind of lubrication system is that the pick up pipe can be accommodated in a desired location by providing access to the oil gallery provided in a bed plate based on packaging constrains and type of vehicle.<br>
Thus said oil gallery in the bedplate provides a robust oil pick up provision from the oil sump.<br>
