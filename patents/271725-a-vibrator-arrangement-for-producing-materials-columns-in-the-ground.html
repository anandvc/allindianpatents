				<td>Description<br>
Vibrator arrangement and method of producing material<br>
columns in the ground<br>
The invention relates to a vibrator arrangement and to<br>
a method of producing material columns which are<br>
incorporated into the ground in order to improve the<br>
soil properties of ground intended to support<br>
buildings.<br>
Two basic methods of producing material columns in the<br>
ground have been known for a long time. In the "wet<br>
tamping compaction" method, a column-like hole is<br>
produced and then flushing water is charged into the<br>
hole. Rapidly moving a vibrator up and down, in<br>
combination with the water flushing results in a flow<br>
which erodes the soil material in such a way that an<br>
annular space is created between the depth vibrator and.<br>
the adjoining soil region, thereby making it possible<br>
to transport gravel, recycled concrete, sand or similar<br>
granular bulk material along the depth vibrator and<br>
into the hole. Apart from the eroding action, the water<br>
performs further important functions as well, namely<br>
that of stabilizing the hole wall against any collapse<br>
of the wall caused by the pressure of the groundwater<br>
and that of preventing gravel from jamming between the<br>
hole wall and the depth vibrator. The upwardly flowing<br>
water eliminates these "bridges" formed by jamming and<br>
thus ensures that the gravel is transported depthwise<br>
down to the lower end of the vibrator, where it is<br>
tamped to form a so-called "tamped column". A<br>
particular problem associated with this method is that<br>
of disposing of the extremely sludgy flushing water,<br>
something which entails high costs inter alia, and<br>
another problem is that contamination which may be<br><br>
present in the soil is washed out of the soil to the<br>
surface.<br>
In a second method, the "dry tamping compaction"<br>
method, a material-conveying pipe is fastened laterally<br>
alongside a vibrator and is used to transport material<br>
to the lower end of the depth vibrator. Disadvantages<br>
in relation to the wet tamping compaction technique are<br>
the lower gravel-conveying capacity (volume per time)<br>
and the higher costs for the more elaborate equipment.<br>
In both methods, the material is transported to the<br>
lower end of the vibrator solely under the force of<br>
gravity acting on the material. Without flushing water<br>
or without a conveying pipe it is not possible for the<br>
gravel to be conveyed into soil layers underneath the<br>
ground water level. To accelerate transportation, or if<br>
the transportation of material has come to a<br>
standstill, the only remaining option is to enlarge the<br>
annular space, although this is in most cases<br>
undesirable since it results in soil being<br>
unnecessarily washed out and in an increased<br>
requirement for flushing water.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
device for and a method of producing tamped columns in<br>
which, by contrast with the prior art, there is no<br>
requirement, or only a relatively low requirement, for<br>
flushing water and no conveying pipe is necessary<br>
either.<br>
This object is achieved by a vibrator arrangement as<br>
claimed in patent claim 1 and a method as claimed in<br>
patent claim 10. Refinements of the invention form the<br>
subject matter of the subclaims.<br><br>
A vibrator arrangement according to one exemplary<br>
embodiment of the invention comprises an elongate<br>
vibrating body with an outer surface having a<br>
periphery. On this periphery is arranged a projection<br>
which extends away from the vibrating body in a lateral<br>
direction and which extends at least in sections around<br>
the periphery.<br>
When using such a vibrator arrangement to produce<br>
material columns in the ground, after producing a hole,<br>
after sinking the vibrator arrangement into the hole<br>
and after introducing material, the transportation of<br>
the material to a lower end of the vibrating body is<br>
not effected under the force of gravity alone. During<br>
an up and down movement of the vibrator arrangement,<br>
this transportation of material is additionally<br>
assisted by the projection which acts as a mechanical<br>
transporting device, similarly to a shovel. During a<br>
downward movement of the vibrating body, this<br>
projection which extends at least in sections around<br>
the periphery and protrudes in a lateral direction<br>
presses a material situated in an annular space<br>
underneath the projection further depthwise in the<br>
direction of the lower end of the vibrating body, where<br>
it is compacted to form a tamped column.<br>
During a subsequent upward movement, owing to the<br>
conical form of the projection the material is,<br>
however, not conveyed upward again but displaced<br>
laterally into the soil in order, during a further<br>
downward movement, to be captured by the projection and<br>
transported into the depth of the column formation.<br>
The projection is preferably designed in such a way<br>
that it becomes broader at an acute angle in the<br>
direction toward a lower end of the vibrating body. The<br><br>
geometry of this projection can in this case correspond<br>
to the geometry of a truncated cone or of a truncated<br>
pyramid. Furthermore, the projection may comprise a<br>
plurality of segments arranged in the peripheral<br>
direction.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, it is also possible<br>
for a plurality of projections to be arranged along the<br>
longitudinal direction of the vibrating body.<br>
In a further embodiment, the projections are movable<br>
along the longitudinal direction of the vibrating body.<br>
In addition, the projection or individual segments of<br>
the projection may be designed such that they can be<br>
folded in in the direction of the outer surface of the<br>
vibrating body or such that they can be retracted into<br>
the vibrating body.<br>
The vibrator arrangement may be designed, in<br>
particular, as a depth vibrator having an eccentric<br>
arranged in the vibrating body or else as a top<br>
vibrator having an eccentric arranged on an upper end<br>
of the vibrating body.<br>
The mechanical assistance provided by the projection to<br>
transport the material makes it possible to increase<br>
the material flow per unit time by more than 50 percent<br>
and to at least halve the flushing water required.<br>
Instead of water, air or another gas blown into the<br>
annular space can also be used here for "flushing". The<br>
water or gaseous flushing medium can even be dispensed<br>
with completely in some soils.<br><br>
The present invention will be explained in more detail<br>
below with reference to exemplary embodiments<br>
represented in figures.<br>
Figure 1 shows an example of a vibrator<br>
arrangement according to the invention<br>
with a vibrating body and a projection.<br>
Figure 2 shows a further example of a vibrator<br>
arrangement according to the invention<br>
with a vibrating body, in which the<br>
projection is arranged on the lower end<br>
of the vibrating body.<br>
Figures 3A-C show different forms of embodying the<br>
projections.<br>
Unless otherwise stated, identical reference numbers in<br>
the figures designate identical parts with an identical<br>
meaning.<br>
Figure 1 is a side view showing an embodiment of the<br>
vibrator arrangement 1 according to the invention. This<br>
arrangement comprises an elongate vibrating body 2<br>
which has an outer surface 22 with a periphery and<br>
which also has a lower end 21 and an upper end (not<br>
shown). Arranged along the periphery of the outer<br>
surface 22 is a projection 3 which protrudes in a<br>
lateral or radial direction from the vibrating body 2.<br>
This projection 3 broadens out in the direction of the<br>
lower end 21, i.e. the projection protrudes<br>
increasingly from the outer surface 22 of the vibrating<br>
body 2 in the direction of the lower end 21.<br>
With reference to figure 1, the projection can extend<br>
annularly around the periphery of the vibrating body 2.<br><br>
The vibrating body 2 can, in particular, be of<br>
cylindrical design and thus have a circular cross<br>
section. However, the vibrating body can also have any<br>
other cross section, in particular a rectangular cross<br>
section.<br>
The projection 3 has, for example, the geometry of a<br>
truncated cone or truncated pyramid traversed by the<br>
vibrating body.<br>
In the example represented, a lower side 32 of the<br>
projection facing in the direction of the lower end of<br>
the vibrating body protrudes approximately at a right<br>
angle from the vibrating body 2, whereas an upper side<br>
31 of the projection tapers with increasing distance<br>
from the lower end 21 of the vibrating body, with the<br>
result that the projection 3 in the example has the<br>
form of a truncated cone traversed by the vibrating<br>
body.<br>
The projection 3 can be arranged at any longitudinal<br>
position of the vibrating body 2. In the example shown<br>
in figure 1, this projection is arranged at a distance<br>
from the lower end 21 of the vibrating body 2.<br>
The exemplary embodiment according to figure 2 differs<br>
from that shown in figure 1 in that the projection 3 is<br>
arranged on the lower end 21 of the vibrating body.<br>
The vibrator arrangement can be embodied, for example,<br>
as a depth vibrator or as a top vibrator. In the case<br>
of a depth vibrator, an eccentric (not shown) which<br>
generates vibrating motions is arranged in the<br>
vibrating body 2. In the case of a top vibrator, the<br>
eccentric (not shown) is arranged above the upper end<br>
of the vibrating body 2.<br><br>
Exemplary embodiments of the projection 3 are explained<br>
below with reference to figure 3.<br>
In the example represented in figure 3A, the upper side<br>
31 of the projection 3 extends conically at an acute<br>
angle to the longitudinal direction of the elongate<br>
vibrating body 2, whereas the lower side 32 extends at<br>
an approximately right angle with respect to the<br>
longitudinal direction. The projection 3 here is formed<br>
as a solid body.<br>
Figure 3B shows an embodiment of a segmented projection<br>
3 having a plurality of segments 40, 41, 42, 43<br>
arranged adjacent to one another in the peripheral<br>
direction. This embodiment makes it possible to fold in<br>
the projection 3 relative to the vibrating body 2 or to<br>
retract the projection 3 into the vibrating body 2.<br>
The embodiment of the projection 3 shown in figure 3C<br>
differs from the embodiment in figure 3A in that the<br>
lower side 32 of the projection likewise has a conical,<br>
tapering profile, which means that the aforementioned<br>
shovel action of the projection 3 can be improved.<br>
In the method according to the invention of producing a<br>
material column in the ground 5, first of all a column-<br>
like hole is produced. Such a hole typically has a<br>
diameter from about 50 cm to about 100 cm. The<br>
vibrating body 2 according to the invention that is<br>
used typically has external dimensions from about 30 cm<br>
to 50 cm.<br>
After sinking the vibrator 1 to a desired depth,<br>
gravel, recycled concrete, sand or similar granular<br>
material is introduced into an annular space 4 between<br><br>
the outer surface 22 of the vibrating body 2 and the<br>
surrounding soil, and flushing water or another gaseous<br>
"flushing medium", in particular air, is optionally fed<br>
in as well. The depth vibrator 1 is then regularly<br>
moved up and down in such a way that the material<br>
situated below the vibrating body 2 is compressed to<br>
form a tamped column.<br>
In this arrangement, the material situated in the<br>
annular space 4 is captured by the projection 3 during<br>
a downward movement of the vibrating body and<br>
transported in the direction of the lower end of the<br>
vibrating body 2. At the same time, any jamming of<br>
material which may have occurred in the annular space 4<br>
between the vibrating body 2 and ground 5 is<br>
eliminated. During the upward movement, the oblique<br>
profile of the upper side 31 of the projection ensures<br>
that the material is displaced laterally and not<br>
transported upward again. In the case of a projection<br>
which can be folded in or retracted, said projection<br>
can be folded in/retracted during the upward movement.<br>
In addition, there is also the possibility of arranging<br>
the projection on the vibrating body so as to be<br>
movable in the longitudinal direction, thereby making<br>
it possible to transport material or to compact<br>
material merely through an up and down movement of the<br>
projection 3.<br><br>
