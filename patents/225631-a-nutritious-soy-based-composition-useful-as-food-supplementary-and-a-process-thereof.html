				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a nutritious soy based composition useful as food<br>
supplementary and a process for preparing said nutritious soy based composition.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART TO THE INVENTION<br>
The problem of malnutrition, with all its implications to Public Health and natural<br>
development is probably the greatest challenge taking Planners, Scientists and<br>
Administrators of India. Any attempt to meet this challenge must be based on<br>
scientific foundations and on a clear appreciation of the practical realities and<br>
constraints in the existing situations.<br>
The Preschool years are critical for growth and development with more rapid and<br>
frequent transitions occurring in dietary patterns than in other age groups. The<br>
outstanding nutritional problems in the country that currently account for significant<br>
impairment of the country's human resources are Protein-Energy Malnutrition, which<br>
leads to physical and mental retardation and under development of children. The<br>
solution to the problem of Protein-Energy Malnutrition could be achieved through<br>
proper use of inexpensive traditional Cereal-legume-based diets within the economic<br>
reach of poor families and within the country's resources.<br>
A hurdle in feeding Cereal-legume based diets to very young children starts from the<br>
low calorie density of these diets, which could be overcome by the reductin of<br>
viscosity of cooked cereal foods, and their calorie density increased by the addition<br>
of malted flour, a source of digestive enzymes.<br>
At present, the problem of malnutrition and its implication on the public health and<br>
national development is the greatest challenge which is bothering the Scientists and<br>
Atin ';strators of the Country.<br>
Efforts are being made by the World Food Programme (WFP) to alleviate hunger<br>
and malnutrition by providing nutritious products at affordable prices by the<br>
Government across the World to feed the children and mothers at nutritionally critical<br>
Times.<br>
naia s rural copulation are subject to three common forms of nutritional deprivation<br>
Inadequacy of food intake among the poorer segment leading to calorie<br>
deficiency.<br>
2. The lack of extra nutritional need of infants and preschool children and<br>
2. Deficiency of specific micro nutrients such as Vitamin A and iron.<br>
Consequently infant and toddler mortality rates for rural India are very high.<br>
Many nutritious food supplements such as Indian multipurpose food, Bal-Aahar,<br>
Corn-Soya milk has been extensively used in various nutrition intervention programs<br>
by various agencies. Although blends would provide the requirement of both<br>
proteins and calorie to Preschool and School Children, they posed the number of<br>
hurdles, in large scale programmes, which include ingredient being raw materials<br>
have to be cooked to be acceptable foods, the distribution centers should be<br>
equipped with sanitary kitchen, cooking facility and high process time.<br>
Keeping these factors in view, an improved process for preparation of nutritious Soy<br>
based formulation useful as supplementary food based on Cereal (Wheat), Bengal<br>
Gram Dhal, Soy Dhal, defatted protein rich oilseed meals.<br>
The product formulated as found to be useful as ready to use weaning/nutrition food<br>
for children and pregnant women.<br>
Reference may be made to US Patent # US 3911142 by Heulskamp et al. (1975),<br>
wherein claim is made for a process for a ready-to-eat products which is high in<br>
protein content. The product contains Soya n, Whey and Potato Flakes. The<br>
product results form a critical sequence of processing steps. The drawback is that<br>
the product has potato flakes which involves an additional unit operation of flaking<br>
and drying. The process has a high protein content of 70% and fat of 1% which<br>
would compromise the taste of the product.<br>
Reference may be made to US Patent # US 5922186 by Reed et al (1999) Proctor<br>
and Gamble Company, Cincinnati, Ohio, wherein a process is described for the<br>
preparation of reduced fat shaped snack product having a light crispy, crunchy<br>
texture using a starch based flour, fat and water. The snack pieces are fried to<br>
provide a snack having 20 to 28% fat. The process involves frying as a unit<br>
operation, which could lead to short shelf life due to exposed fat becoming rancid.<br>
Reference may be made to US Patent # US 5171600 by Young et al. (1992), Proctor<br>
and Gamble Company, Cincinnati, Ohio, wherein a process is described for the<br>
preparation of reduced fat shaped snack product having a light crispy, crunchy<br>
texture using Potato Flour (52-80%) and water. Snack Pieces are cut, extruded and<br>
fried. The excess fat is removed by stripping with superheated steam. This process<br>
has a disadvantage of frying and then stripping of the excess fat as it is both energy<br>
intensive and expensive. Since the major ingredient is potato, the product is starch<br>
based without much protein.<br>
Reference may be made to US Patent # US 4421770 by Wiker et al. (1983) Kansas<br>
State University Research Founation, Manhattan, KS, wherein a process for a high<br>
protein snack food prepared from egg protein by a process involving heat<br>
coagulation of a molded body of the egg protein composition, slicing, coating the<br>
slices with a liquid batter-mix containing mainly starch. The batter coagulum slices<br>
was breaded and deep fat fried to seal their outer surfaces. The disadvantage of the<br>
process is that it involves the deep fat frying and the exposed fat becomes rancid if<br>
proper packaging and storage conditions are not provided.<br>
Reference may be made to US Patent # US 5554405 by Fazzolare et. Al (1996)<br>
Parsippany, NJ, wherein a baked corn based snack product composed of the blend<br>
of masa corn flour and corn flour which is claimed with crisp chip like texture and<br>

(a) mixing roasted wheat flour having at least 11% protein, malted jowar flour,<br>
defatted soya flour, bengal gram dhal flour, sweetener, vitamin premix. In<br>
order to optimize the raw material inputs viz.<br>
(i) Roasted wheat flour (xi), defatted and toasted soy flour (x2), malted<br>
jowar flour (x3), roasted Bengal gram flour (X4), Cane sugar (x5) and<br>
vitamin and mineral premix (xe);<br>
(ii) xi,X2,X3, X4, x5andxe<br>
the function, 0.5xi + 0.067 x2 + 0.067 x3 -1-0.045x4 + 0.31 2x5 + 0.009xe<br>
was optimized using linear programming techniques.<br>
The following constraints were taken into account:<br>
0.012xi + 0.048X2 + 0.08 x3 + 0.24 x*  15.0 (protein)<br>
3.46x1 + 3.26 x2 + 4.32 x3 + 3.60x4 + 3.83x5  360 (kcal)<br>
xi + x2 + x3 +x4 + x5 + x6 = 101 (total parts)<br>
The optimum blend has the following composition:<br>
Protein  1 5<br>
Calories  360<br>
(b) Malting of Millets like jowar may be carried out to increase the bioavailability of<br>
nutrients. The malted flour is amylase-rich whose indigenous action increases<br>
bioavailability of nutrients.<br>
 (c) Roasting of wheat is done separately using a fluidized bread roaster in the<br>
range of 200-260°C till a light brown colour was developed. This is crucial for<br>
the flavour development and taste of the product.<br>
id) Roasting of Bengal Gram and powdering it to pass through 80 mesh sieve.<br>
Soya flour which has been toasted so that the trypsin inhibitor content comes<br>
to 1/3rd of its original value.<br>

In yet another embodiment of the process, the final formulation has a moisture<br>
content of 4-6%.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the formulation, the final product has a protein content<br>
of 12-15% and will provide a minimum of 360 kcal energy per 100 gm.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the process, the product has a minimum of 2% fat and<br>
55% carbohydrate in the product.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the final formulation, the product is highly acceptable<br>
with respect to color, appearance, taste and overall energy.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the process, the final product has 60 mesh particle<br>
size.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invert.. roasting of oil seed flour may ce<br>
carried out at 200°C for flavor development, reduction of trypsin inhibitor content and<br>
reduction in moisture content.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention unrefined sugar/refined sugar in<br>
the range of 25 to 35% is powdered and added.<br>
In still another embodiment of the process, mixing together of all dry ingredients<br>
through an entoletor ensures uniform mixing and sterility and the said process<br>
comprises the following steps:<br>
1. Roasting of Wheat, bengal gram is done separately using a Fluidized Bed<br>
Roaster at a temperature of 180-220°C till a light brown color was developed.<br>
This is crucial for the flavor development and taste of the product. This step<br>
also helps in bringing down the moisture to the required levels and to prevent<br>
rancidity and softness of the product during storage.<br>
2. Malting of jowar is to improve the bioavailability of nutrients by the action of<br>
indigenous enzymes. This brings down the viscosity of the gruel. Sieving of<br>
dehydration and powdering of the millet removes the hull which is rich in<br>
antinutritional factors.<br>
3. Mixing together of the following ingredients.<br>
Major ingredients<br>
Wheat 41-53%<br>
Malted Jowar Flour 5-20%<br>

quantities per manufacturers' daily prescribed consumption.<br>
The initial stage of mixing process comprises of dry blending of ingredients through<br>
an entoleter. The entoleter allows the complete destruction of insects of all stages<br>
thus resulting in sterilization of the flour by impact. These impacts are also useful for<br>
solid to solid mixing and excellent for on line homogenization of flour with<br>
micronutrients.<br>
Novelty:<br>
Novelty and inventive steps of this invention lies in the fact to provide an improved<br>
process for preparation of nutritious soy based formulation useful as supplementary<br>
food.<br>
1. Novelty of the formulation and process is that composition ensures a<br>
minimum of 12-15% protein of high quality.<br>
2. The final product will provide a minimum of 360 Real of energy per 100 gm.<br>
3. The formulation contains malted millets like Jowar or pearl millet which<br>
thereby increases the bioavailability of the nutrients and reduction in the<br>
viscosity of the final product.<br>
4 The roasting of wheat and Bengal gram in a fiuidized bed drier ensures<br>
development of pleasing flavor and appealing color thereby increasing<br>
palatability.<br>
5. Passing the formulation through an entoleter ensures microbial safety of the<br>
product and also helps to homogenize and mix major and minor ingredients<br>
through impact.<br>
6. The formulation gives a ready to eat product with at least 6 months shelf life.<br>
The process is further illustrated by the example given below, which should not<br>
however be construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br>

Roasting of Wheat, bengal gram is done separately using a Fluidized Bed<br>
Roaster at a temperature of 180-220°C till a light brown color was developed.<br>
This is crucial for the flavor development and taste of the product. Roasting of<br>
Bengal Gram and powdering it to pass through 60 mesh sieve. Soy flour which<br>
has been toasted so that the trypsin inhibitor content comes to 1/3rd of its original<br>
value. The mixing together of all dry ingredients through an entoleter ensures<br>
uniform mixing and sterility. The final formulation has a moisture content of 4-6%,<br>
a protein content of 12-15%, a minimum of 2% fat and 55% carbohydrate in the<br>
product. It will provide a minimum of 360 kcal energy per 100 gm serving. The<br>
product has a shelf life of at least 6 months.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
150 kg of base material from soy was mixed with 120 kg of malted jowar flour,<br>
100 kg of Bengal gram flour and 360 kg i wheat flour, prepared by the unit<br>
operations of cleaning, destoning, roastinb. ^rinding, cooling etc., 270 kg of me<br>
powdered cane sugar prepared by the unit operations of cleaning and milling, to<br>
the above mixture, along with 0.86 kg vitamin premix, 8.6 kg calcium carbonate,<br>
0.9 kg ferrous sulphate, was added to the above mixture by mixing in an efficient<br>
impact mill entoleter to give 1010 kg of the energy food.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
15 kg of base material from soy was mixed with 10 kg of Bengal gram flour, 10 kg<br>
of malted jowar flour and 38 kg of the wheat flour, prepared by the unit operations<br>
of cleaning, destoning, roasting, grinding, cooling etc., 27 kg of the powdered<br>
cane sugar prepared by the unit operations of cleaning and milling, to the above<br>
mixture, along with 0.086 kg vitamin premix, 0.86 kg calcium carbonate, 0.09 kg<br>
ferrous sulphate, was added to the above mixture by mixing in an efficient impact<br>
mill entoleter to give 101 kg of the energy food.<br>
