Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for producing (3R, 5S)-(E)-7-t2-cyclopropyl-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-quinolin-3-yl]-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6-enic acid esters. This compound is useful as a synthetic intermediate of "3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA-reductase inhibitor" disclosed in JP 1-279866 A as being useful for a blood-cholesterol reducer.<br>
In addition, the present invention relates to a novel process for producing β-diketocarboxylate ester derivative, which is required for synthesis of (3R, 5S)-(E)-7-[2-cyclopropyl-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-quinolin-3-yll-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6-enic acid esters as described above.<br>
Background Art<br>
As a process for chemically producing {3R, 5S)-(E)-7-t2-cyclopropyl-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-quinolin-3-yl]-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6-enic acid esters, for example, the following production route has been known as disclosed in JP 1-279866 A and Journal of Chromatography A, 832 (1999) p55-65.<br><br><br>
In these processes, however, a reaction product is a mixture of an optical isomer and an optically active substance, so that only the desired optically active substance compound should be obtained through separation and purification by means of chromatography and so on in their respective final steps. It is rather difficult to say that the isolation of an isomer in the final step is cost effective and efficient on an industrial scale.<br>
Furthermore, in JP 8-92217 A, there is disclosed another production process using an optically active Schiff base.<br>
Still furthermore, in JP 8-127585 A. there is disclosed a production process using methyl {R)-3-tert-butyl dimethylsilyloxy- 6 -dimethoxyphosphinyl-5-oxohexanoate at a very low temperature.<br>
On the other hand, as a process for producing an optically active alcohol product by a stereo-selective reduction of a compound having a keto group using microbial cells and/or a cell preparation thereof, in Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. (1998) 49: p. 709-717, there is a description that the following chemical<br><br>
reaction can be performed using Micro bacterium campoquemadoensis strain MB5614.<br><br><br><br>
Furthermore, in Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., vol. 8, pl403- (1998), there is a description that the following reaction can be performed using a bakers yeast.<br><br><br><br><br>
However, with respect to a compound in which carbonyl groups continuously exist in the molecule thereof in addition to the presence of olefin on the &amp;-position of the carbonyl group, such as (E)-7-[2-cyclopropyl-4- {4-f luorophenyl) -quinolin-3-yl ] -3, 5-dihydroxyhepto-6-enoic acid esters, any example in which such a compound can be reduced using a microorganism in a stereo-selective manner has not been known in the art.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Therefore, it has been desired to develop a novel production process which is capable of cost-effectively<br><br>
producing (3R,5S)-(E)-7-[2-cyclopropyl-4-{4-<br>
fluoropheny 1) - gunflint -3-yl]-3,5- dihydroxyhep t - 6 - eni c<br>
acid esters on an industrial scale.<br>
For solving the above problem, the inventors of the present invention have made extensive studies over and over again and found out that the desired products can be obtained at high optical purities when the compounds represented by the following compounds (I) to (III) and (II') and (III') are used as raw materials, resulting in accomplishment of the present invention. Therefore, a gist of the present invention resides in a process for producing a compound represented by the following formula (IV):<br><br>
(where R denotes a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, or an aryl group), comprising reducing a compound selected from the group consisting of: a compound represented by the following formula (I):<br><br><br>
(where R is as defined in the formula);<br>
a compound represented by the following formula (II)<br><br>
(where R is as defined in the formula); and<br>
a compound represented by the following formula (III)<br><br>
(where R is as defined in the formula), by reacting the compound with a cell of a microorganism and/or a cell preparation thereof capable of stereo-selectively<br><br>
reducing a keto group.<br>
Further, another gist of the present invention resides in a process for producing the compound (I), comprising conducting a condensation reaction between 2-cyclopropyl-4- (4-fluorophenyl) quinolin-3-carbaldehyde represented by the following formula (A):<br><br>
(where R denotes a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, an aralkyl group, or an aryl group).<br>
Rest Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be<br>
described in detail.<br>
According to the present invention, a process for<br>
producing (3R,5S)-(E)-7-[2-cyclopropyl-4-(4-<br>
f luorophenyl) -quinolin-3-yl] -3,5-dihydroxyhept-6-enic<br><br>
acid esters comprising reducing a compound selected from<br>
the group consisting of:<br>
a compound represented by the following formula (I)<br><br><br>
compound with a cell of a microorganism and/or a cell preparation thereof capable of stereo-selectively reducing a keto group.<br>
In the compounds represented by the above formulae<br>
(I)	to (III), which are raw materials to be used in the<br>
production process of the present invention, R<br>
represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, or an aryl<br>
group.<br>
The alkyl group may be an alkyl group such as an methyl group, an ethyl group, an isopropyl group, a cyclopropyl group, a butyl group, an isobutyl group, a t-butyl group, a cyclohexyl group, a benzyl group, or a phenethyl group, or a straight-, branched-, or cyclic-alkyl group which may be substituted with an aryl group.<br>
The aryl group may be a phenyl group or a naphthyl group which may be substituted with an alkyl group, such as a phenyl group, a mistily group, or a apathy group.<br>
The above R is preferably a C1-C1 alkyl group, a benzyl group, or a phenyl group, more preferably a C1-C1 alkyl group, particularly preferably a methyl group or an ethyl group.<br>
According to the production process of the present invention, the compounds represented by the formulae<br>
(II)	and (III) may be respectively optically active<br>
substances represented by the following formula (II')<br><br><br>
(where R is as defined in the formula).<br>
The compounds represented by the formula (I) to (III) and (II') and (III') can be optionally produced with a combination of a process disclosed in JP 1-279866 A, JP 8-127585 A, JP 5-178841 A, or the like and a process well known in the art.<br>
Further, as a preferable process for producing the compound represented by the formula (I), the inventors of the present invention have reached the following process in which the compound is obtained by a condensation reaction between<br>
2 - cyclopropyl - 4 - (4 - fluorophenyl) quenelle - 3 - paraldehyde represented by the following formula (A):<br><br><br>
(where R denotes a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, an aralkyl group, or an aryl group). By employing this process, the compound represented by the above formula (I) can be produced easily and efficiently.<br>
A condensation reaction between the compound (A) and the compound (B) can be progressed by the same operation as that of one which is a so-called alto reaction. In general, a process, by which a base is added in a solution containing the compound (B) and a solution containing the compound (A) is then dropped into the solution under a nitrogen or inert-gas atmosphere, is preferably performed.<br>
The bases to be used in the above condensation reaction include: hydrides of alkali metals or alkaline-earth metals, such as sodium hydride, potassium hydride, and calcium hydride; lithium alkyl reagents such as n-butyl lithium and t-butyl lithium; Grignard reagents<br><br>
such as t-butyl magnesium chloride; alkali-metal alkalizes such as sodium ethoxide; and NaNHj. In addition, solid bases of alkaline-earth metal oxides or the like such as magnesium oxide may be included. Among them, hydrides of alkali metals or alkali-earth metals, and NaNHj are preferable, alkali-metal hydrides are more preferable, and sodium hydride is particularly preferable.<br>
In general, the usage amount of the base is 1.5 equivalent weights or more, preferably 2 equivalent weights or more with respect to the compound (B) . If it is excessively used, a side reaction may occur and a reduction in yield may thus occur. Therefore, in general, it is used in the range of 10 equivalent weights or less. In the above range, it is preferably in the range of 2 to 3 equivalent weights, particularly preferably 2 to 2.7 equivalent weights.<br>
The reaction is generally performed using a solvent. The solvents to be used include: aromatic hydrocarbon solvents such as toluene, benzene, and xylems; ether solvents such as methyl-t-butyl ether, dimethoxy ethane, and tetrahydrofuran; halogenated hydrocarbon solvents such as methylene chloride; and non-photonics solvents such as N,N-dimethyl formamide. Among them, a preferable solvent is one having a dielectric constant of 2.5 or more, more preferably 5 or more at 20' C. Specific examples of the above preferable<br><br>
solvent include tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxy ethane, N,N-dimethyl formamide, and N,N-dimethyl imidazolidinone, and tetrahydrof urn is particularly preferable.<br>
The usage amount of the solvent is generally about 0.5 to 100-fold volume of a reaction substrate. In this range, from an industrial viewpoint, it is preferable to adopt the range of 20-fold volume or less.<br>
As a reaction operation, the compound (A) may be added after mixing the base and the compound (B), a mixture between the base and the compound (B) may be added in the compound (A), a mixture between the compounds (A) and (B) may be added in the base, or the base may be added in a mixture between the compounds (A) and (B). In any operation, the reaction can proceed. However, a preferable process is to mix the base and the compound (B) and then add the compound (A) in the mixture.<br>
The reaction may proceed at a temperature of -50" C to 100" C, preferably -20* C to 40" C, typically for 30 minutes or more, preferably 1 hour or more. If required, the temperature may be increased.<br>
After termination of the reaction, after terminating the reaction by adding water, acetic acid, ammonium chloride, or the like in a reaction system, the compound (I) cam be obtained by conventional isolation and purification operations, such as washing with water and separatory extraction.<br><br>
In the condensation reaction between the compound (A) and the compound (B), by selecting the base and the solvent to be used, the compound (I) can also be produced after providing a compound [hereinafter, referred to as compound (C)], represented by the following general formula (C):<br><br><br>
(C)<br>
(where R is as defined in the formula, and R1 is a hydroxyl group, a halogen group, a silyloxy group, a sulfonyloxy group, an acyloxy group, an alkoxycarbonyloxy group, an alkylthiocarbonyloxy group, an alkoxythiocarbonyloxy group, or an<br>
alkylthlothiocarbonyloxy group) or a salt thereof as an intermediate of the production.<br>
In the above-mentioned compound (C) , R can use the same previously mentioned groups. Further, R1 denotes: a hydroxyl group; a halogen atom such as a chorine atom and a bromine atom; silyloxy groups such as trimethyl silyloxy group and t-butyldimethyl silyloxy group; sulfonyloxy groups such as methanesulfonyloxy group and paratoluene sulfonyloxy group; acyloxy groups such as acetoxy group and propionyloxy group; alkoxycarbonyloxy<br><br>
groups such as methoxycarbonyloxy group and vinyloxycarbonyloxy group; alkylthiocarbonyloxy groups such as methylthiocarbonyloxy group; alkoxythiocarbonyloxy groups such as methoxythiocarbonyloxy group; or alkylthiothiocarbonyloxy groups such as methylthiothiocarbonyloxy group. Of these groups, a hydroxyl group, a sulfonyloxy group or an acyloxy group is preferable, an acyloxy group is more preferable and an acetoxy group is particularly preferable.<br>
A preferable combination of substituents to be provided as the compound (C) described above may be a combination of R and R1 as the preferable ones, which are mentioned in the description of the above substituents.<br>
One of the specific reaction steps when the above compound (C) is used as an intermediate will be described below. An intermediate having the above R1 as a hydroxyl group in the compound (C) is obtained, for example by the use of a combination of NaH and n-Bali as a base to be used in a condensation reaction between the compound (A) and the compound (B). In addition, the compound (I) can be obtained by performing a dehydration reaction on the intermediate. Alternatively, the compound (I) may be obtained by converting a hydroxyl group of the intermediate into another functional group such as halogen and then eliminating the functional<br><br>
group therefrom. Here, the usage amount of the above NaH is approximately equimolar to the compound (A), and the usage amount of n-Built is approximately 1.5 to 2.5 equivalent weights. Furthermore, the dehydration reaction and the elimination reaction of a functional group, which are described above, may be performed appropriately using conventionally well-known processes.<br>
At the time of isolating the compound (I) produced by the above process, the isolation can be performed more easily when the above compound (I) is provided as a salt. Thus, the compound may be obtained as a salt. The salt of the compound (I) can be obtained as an acid-addition salt by adding an acid in an organic phase which is washed with water after the termination of a production reaction and separatory-extracted therefrom while optionally condensed and/or cooled, followed by stirring. Instead of acid, an ammonium salt and an amine addition salt can be obtained using ammonium and amines. When the compound (I) is obtained as a salt, it is preferable to eliminate a salt thereof at the time of subjecting the compound (I) to a reduction reaction using the microbial cells and/or a cell preparation thereof described below to obtain the compound (I).<br>
The present invention is characterized in that in the compounds represented by the above formula (I) to (III), keto groups are stereo-selectively reduced using the microbial cells and/or a cell preparation thereof.<br><br>
The microorganism to be used in the present Invention is any microorganism as far as it  is  capable of stereo-selectively reducing a keto group.<br>

If required, the compounds represented by the formulae (I) to (III) or a mixture thereof may be supplement ally added during the reaction.<br>
In addition, for accelerating the reaction, a co¬enzyme, both of the co-enzyme and its regeneration system, or a carbon source may be appropriately added.<br>

For a compound represented by the formula (IV) obtained by the above production process, in general, impurities are removed by a conventional purification process, namely, a chromatography and a crystallizing technique after extracting the compound from a reaction solution with an organic solvent to obtain the purified compound represented by the formula (IV). Specifically, after dissolving the compound represented by the formula (IV) with an organic solvent, a solid fraction including a microorganism is eliminated by a conventional separator used in a centrifugation, a filter press, an ultrafiltration, etc. to obtain a liquid containing a compound represented by the formula (IV). Using the conventional method such as chromatography or crystallizing technique, impurities are removed from the resulting liquid. Thus, a purified compound represented by the formula (IV) can be obtained.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in more detail with reference to examples. However, general modifications can be performed in the technical field of the present invention without departing from the gist of the present invention.<br>

500-ml flasks each containing 50 mL of the liquid<br><br>
culture medium having the same composition as that of Example 1, were sterilized at 120* C for 20 minutes, respectively. The eight flasks were inoculated with Ogataea minuta  var nonfermentans  IF01473, followed by incubating it at 28* C for 24 hours under aerobic conditions. The resulting culture solution corresponding to four of eight flasks was inoculated in each of two 30 L- jar fermentors, which contains 20 L of a liquid culture medium composed of 10 g/L of yeast extract (manufactured by Difco Co., Ltd.), 10 g/L of polypeptone (manufactured by Nihon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.), 6 g/L of malt extract (manufactured by Difco Co., Ltd. ) , and 20 g/L of glucose (manufactured by Nihon Shokuhinkako Co., Ltd.), followed by incubating them at 28* C for 24 hours. After the incubation, the culture solution was centrifuged to collect microbial cells. The microbial cells were completely suspended while being added in 9 L of a 100 rtiM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and divided into three equal volumes. Then, each of them was placed in a 5 L- jar fermentor. In each fermentor, 53 g of glucose (manufactured by Nihon Shokuhinkako Co., Ltd.), 2 g of NADPH (manufactured by Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd.), and a solution in which 1.66 g of DOXE was dissolved in 130 ml of DMSO were added and reacted at 40" C for 6 hours under aerobic conditions. Further, 2 g of NADPH was readded thereinto at a time 1 hour after the reaction. After<br><br>
the reaction, a part of a reaction solution in each fermentor was taken and the amount of the generation was analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). As a result, 3.43 g of DOLE was generated in total (yield 71%).<br>
Each of the reaction solutions was centrifuged and precipitates were collected. In each of the precipitates, 600 ml of acetonitrile was added. After stirring the mixture sufficiently, a centrifugation was performed to separate the mixture into a supernatant and a precipitate. On the precipitate side, 200 ml of acetonitrile was additionally used for resuspension and centrifugation. All of supernatants were collected together and condensed with an evaporator.

Subsequently, it was replaced with developing solvent of hexane : ethyl acetate =3:2, and 2 L thereof was fed to make an elution.<br>
The eluted solution was divided into 200-ml<br><br>
fractions (20 in total). Each fraction was confirmed with TLC. The fractions in which the presence of DOLE was detected were collected and condensed, resulting in 3.4 g of crude oily DOLE. It was estimated in terms of purity, which corresponds to 2.5 g of DOLE.<br>
