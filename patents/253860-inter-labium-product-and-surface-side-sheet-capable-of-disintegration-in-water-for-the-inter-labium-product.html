INTER-LABIUM PRODUCT AND SURFACE-SIDE SHEET CAPABLE OF<br>
DISINTEGRATION IN WATER FOR THE INTER-LABIUM PRODUCT<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an interlabial product that degrades with<br>
water and that can be discarded as it is by throwing into the discharge water of<br>
the flush lavatory, after having been worn between labia and absorbed body<br>
fluid such as menstrual blood or others discharged from interlabia, and a water<br>
degradable surface side sheet for the interlabial product.<br>
RELATED ART<br>
Conventionally, interlabial products to be worn between labia have been<br>
known. As an interlabial product, a water degradable interlabial product to be<br>
dissipated by a large amount of discharge water of the toilet and degraded into<br>
small fragments to a degree not to hold the original shape, when thrown into the<br>
toilet, has been developed. The water degradable interlabial pad can be<br>
discarded by throwing into a so-called flush lavatory, because this will not fill the<br>
piping of the toilet.<br>
For instance, the interlabial pad disclosed in the JP-A-2000-501322 can<br>
be cited as such a water degradable interlabial pad. That is, the interlabial pad<br>
disclosed in the JP-A-2000-501322 has a liquid permeable surface side sheet<br>
facing to the inner wall of the wearer's labia and a first fiber like assemble and a<br>
wet highly resisting resin such as a glyoxalic polyacrylamide resin or others on<br>
the liquid permeable surface side sheet. This wet highly resisting resin is water<br>
degradable and dissipated in the water as the linkage between materials is<br>
untied in a large amount of water or the water flow; however, the material<br>
doesn't degrade in the moisture of a prescribed amount while worn. Therefore,<br>
the material doesn't remain in the labia, and the growth of bacteria can be<br>
prevented.<br>
However, elusion components may elude from the wet highly resisting<br>
resin that composes the interlabial pad, so that the body is chemically<br>
stimulated by these elusion components and itchy and skin roughness might be<br>
caused.<br>
By the way, the surface side sheet of the interlabial product and the inner<br>
wall of labia may come to rub each other when the interlabial product is worn,<br>
and the wearer might have an unpleasant feeling. In order to solve this<br>
inconvenience, an absorbent interlabial tool is disclosed, for instance, in the<br>
JP-A-2000-512886. That is, the absorbent interlabial tool disclosed in the<br>
JP-A-2000-512886 contains a polysiloxane type emollient composition at least<br>
partially in the body contact face. As a result, the interlabial tool can reduce<br>
unpleasantness, by decreasing the friction between the body and the absorbent<br>
interlabial tool.<br>
However, for such an interlabial pad, the inner wall of labia and the body<br>
contact face of the interlabial product might become slippery. Therefore, the<br>
interlabial product may cause dislocation while worn, and drop out from<br>
interlabia. In addition, a viscous element of the polysiloxane type emollient<br>
composition contained in the surface side sheet of the interlabial product may<br>
remain on the inner wall of labia or the pudenda and cause an unpleasant<br>
feeling. In addition, components may elude from the polysiloxane type emollient<br>
composition as to stimulate the body chemically and cause itchy and skin<br>
roughness.<br>
Moreover, to achieve the dropout prevention from interlabia and the<br>
decrease of the sense of discomfort while worn, the interlabial product is<br>
designed in a compact size compared with the napkin and the liner. Hence,<br>
because the size is compact, the surface side sheet, that is the body side of the<br>
interlabial product, is easily covered with menstrual blood. Therefore, if the<br>
interlabial product after use cannot be thrown into the toilet as it is, the<br>
interlabial product after use shall be disposed by the hand. At this time, if the<br>
interlabial product is folded with its surface side sheet face inside as in case of<br>
napkin or liner, the menstrual blood turns up to adhere to the finger, and this is<br>
not only insanitary, but also takes time very much. Moreover, they try to dispose<br>
of it by using the individual wrapping body where the unused interlabial product<br>
has been stored, without folding the surface side sheet face of the interlabial<br>
product after use, an unused interlabial product shall be worn, after having<br>
wrapped the used interlabial product will in the individual wrapping body.<br>
Therefore, the unused interlabial product taken out from the individual wrapping<br>
body after having it opened shall be put somewhere temporarily, and at this<br>
time, an inconvenience that the unused interlabial product is polluted is caused,<br>
if the place has not been cleaned.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the aforementioned<br>
inconveniences and has an object to offer the interlabial product that have both<br>
comfort while wearing and water degradability allowing it to degrade with water<br>
rapidly when it is thrown in the flush lavatory after use, and the surface side<br>
sheet for this interlabial product.<br>
In order to solve the aforementioned inconveniences, the Inventors came<br>
to find the following characteristics, and to complete the present invention to<br>
solve the problem like the above-mentioned. That is, a fibril fiber having with a<br>
lot of minute branch hairs from the surface of the fiber, was used at least for a<br>
part of the fiber that composes the surface side sheet and adjacent fibers were<br>
bridged mutually with branch hairs. As a result, fibers that compose the surface<br>
side sheet are connected mutually one the other, to maintain without deforming<br>
the original shape of the sheet, in a wet state where body fluid such as<br>
menstrual blood has been absorbed. On the other hand, it will resolve to a<br>
degree not to keep the original shape, uniting the mutual binding of fibers, when<br>
it comes into contact with a large amount of water.<br>
More concretely, the present invention offers the one like the following.<br>
(1) A water degradable surface side sheet for an interlabial product to be<br>
worn between labia, comprising a hydrophilic fiber having a filament and a fibril<br>
fiber which has branch hairs branching from its surface, wherein at least a part<br>
of the branch hairs make bridges between the filament and the fibril fiber.<br>
Here, the filament mean fibers that any physical post-processing such as<br>
fibrillation is not exerted. Moreover, the fibril fiber means a fiber having a lot of<br>
branch hairs formed by beating.<br>
According to the invention of (1), the water degradable surface side sheet<br>
has a filament which is single fiber and a fibril fiber having branch hairs<br>
branching from their surface. As a result, at least a part of branch hairs which<br>
are contained in the fibril fiber bind the filament and the fibril fiber which is<br>
disposed adjacent each other, so that bridge structures are formed. Hence, the<br>
water degradable surface side sheet doesn't easily get untied and degraded,<br>
even in a wet state where body fluid such as menstrual blood has been<br>
absorbed. On the other hand, in a large amount of water such as the<br>
discharge water of the toilet, the bridge structures are gradually resolved, so<br>
that the water degradable surface side sheet comes to be degraded.<br>
Therefore, the interlabial product can be thrown after used as it is into the<br>
toilet. When the wearer disposes of the interlabial product, the wearer only<br>
has to detach the interlabial product from between labia by hand, or by the<br>
pressure of her urine. That is, the wearer needs not to dispose of the used<br>
interlabial product separately, and the hand of the wearer is sanitary as the<br>
hand does not get dirty.<br>
Moreover, water degradability, which decomposes the mutual connection<br>
of fibers with a large amount of water and increases the strength in the wet<br>
state, is achieved by binding filament and fibril fiber through branch hairs of the<br>
fibril fiber. Therefore, because the resin including the elusion component is not<br>
used, neither itchy nor the skin roughness, etc. are caused. Moreover,<br>
shagginess and so on are not caused easily, because the binding among fibers<br>
is strong, even if the water degradable surface side sheet rubs against the inner<br>
wall of labia.<br>
(2) The water degradable surface side sheet for the interlabial product<br>
wherein the fibril fiber is blended 3 to 30 weight % of the hydrophilic fiber.<br>
According to the invention of (2), the water degradable surface side sheet<br>
does not only lose flexibility but also get degraded easily even in the wet state<br>
where body fluid such as menstrual blood has been absorbed. The elongation<br>
degree can be improved, and moreover, the bridge structures of branch hairs<br>
are gradually resolved, and the original shape as the sheet is not maintained,<br>
against a large amount of water such as the discharge water of the toilet. Note<br>
that the bridge structures are broken easily and durability decreases when the<br>
fibril fiber is fewer than 3 weight % of the hydrophilic fiber, because the bridge<br>
structures are too little, and the elongation degree in the wet state doesn't<br>
improve. On the other hand, the water degradable surface side sheet may lose<br>
flexibility as the bridge structures are too much, when the fibril fiber is more than<br>
30 weight % of the hydrophilic fiber.<br>
(3) The water degradable surface side sheet for the interlabial product,<br>
wherein maximum elongation degree on most is higher than maximum<br>
elongation degree on dry.<br>
According to the invention of (3), as maximum elongation degree in the<br>
wet state of the water degradable surface side sheet is made higher than<br>
maximum elongation degree in the dry state, the water degradable sheet<br>
becomes hard to break even if the tensile strength decreases in the wet state.<br>
(4) The water degradable surface side sheet for the interlabial product,<br>
wherein the degree of beating of the branch hairs of the fibril fiber is 100cc to<br>
400cc.<br>
According to the invention of (4), as the strength decrease due to the<br>
fibrillation of the fiber fibril can be suppressed, the tensile strength and the<br>
elongation degree in the wet state where body fluid has been absorbed can be<br>
improved, together with the mutual binding of fibers by the bridge structures of<br>
the fibril fiber and the filament. The branches of the fibers increase and strength<br>
of the fibril fiber decrease because the level of beating is violent when the<br>
degree of beating is less than 100cc. Moreover, when the degree of beating is<br>
larger than 400cc, the number of branch hairs decreases, and the bridge<br>
structure of the filament and the fibril fiber decreases, in case of forming a sheet<br>
by laminating hydrophilic fibers, and it is likely to break when it becomes wet.<br>
(5) The water degradable surface side sheet for the interlabial product,<br>
wherein the fibril fiber is rayon.<br>
The rayon is generated by the wet method or the dry method, and the<br>
fiber length can be selected from the range of 1 to 38mm freely. Therefore,<br>
according to the invention of (5), bridge structures having flexibility can be<br>
obtained, while uniting the filament and the fibril fiber, because the length of the<br>
branch hairs can be made longer, by making the rayon from the fibril fiber<br>
thorough beating.<br>
Natural fabrics are generally different in the fiber length and hard, so that<br>
it is difficult to form a steady bridge structures, because the length of the branch<br>
hair also becomes disparate, event when the natural fabric is fibrillated by<br>
beating. On the other hand, the rayon allows selecting the fiber length freely,<br>
and has less dispersive than the natural fabrics. In addition, as the rayon is<br>
hydrophilic, consequently, and also excellent in compatibility with the body fluid<br>
and fitness to the inner wall of labia, it is possible to use the rayon suitably as<br>
fibril fiber.<br>
(6) An interlabial product for being worn between labia, comprising a<br>
water degradable surface side sheet for being in a face of the labia and a back<br>
side sheet arranged on a opposite side of the water degradable surface side<br>
sheet (garment side), wherein the water degradable surface side sheet<br>
comprising a hydrophilic fiber having a filament and a fibril fiber which has<br>
branch hairs branching from its surface, wherein at least a part of the branch<br>
hairs make bridges between the filament and the fibril fiber.<br>
According to the invention of (6), the water degradable surface side sheet<br>
of the interlabial product comprises a hydrophilic fiber comprising a filament and<br>
a fibril fiber with branch hairs branching from its surface. At least a part of<br>
branch hairs has a bridge structure which forms a bridge between the filament<br>
and the fibril fiber mutually. Hence, the water degradable surface side sheet<br>
doesn't easily get untied and degraded, even in a wet state where body fluid<br>
such as menstrual blood has been absorbed. Therefore, the interlabial product<br>
dose not shift in the wearing position nor fallen off between labia. On the other<br>
hand, the bridge structure of the branch hairs is gradually resolved, and the<br>
water degradable surface side sheet comes to be degraded, for a large amount<br>
of water such as the discharge water of the toilet, the interlabal product is<br>
resolved into small fragments.<br>
(7) The interlabial product, wherein a total size in a transverse direction of<br>
the surface side sheet in a state, where the interlabial product is folded on a fold<br>
line drawn along a longitudinal direction so that the water degradable surface<br>
side sheet is exposed to outside, is longer than that of the surface side sheet in<br>
a state, where the interlabial product is tabular.<br>
According to the invention of (7), when the interlabial product is folded on<br>
a fold line drawn along the longitudinal direction, so that the water degradable<br>
surface side sheet is exposed to outside, the total size in the transverse<br>
direction of the surface side sheet is longer than that before it is folded.<br>
Consequently, the surface side sheet is not pressed by the absorbent body<br>
provided inside the interlabial product, even when the interlabial product is<br>
folded, and the force to restore the state of the interlabial product before folding,<br>
namely the force to open both the end edges of the interlabial product can be<br>
controlled. Therefore, this interlabial product doesn't drop out, because it does<br>
not expand the end edge of the labia, even if the interlabial product is worn<br>
between labia.<br>
Here, the state where the interlabial product is tabular means a state<br>
where the interlabial product is open, and the total size in the transverse<br>
direction means the size from the one end edge to the other end edge, along<br>
the transverse direction of the interlabial product.<br>
Now, the meaning of the fact that the total size in the transverse direction<br>
of the surface side sheet in the state where the interlabial product is folded is<br>
larger than the size in the transverse direction of the surface side sheet before it<br>
is folded shall be described. That is, when the interlabial product is folded in two<br>
parts along the longitudinal direction, the size in the transverse direction of the<br>
surface side sheet located most outside of the interlabial product is longer than<br>
the size in the transverse direction in tabular state before it is fold, by the order<br>
of the circumferential length of a half circle having the thickness of the interlabial<br>
pad as radius.<br>
Thus, the following methods may be enumerated as a method of<br>
lengthening the total size in the transverse direction of the surface side sheet in<br>
the two parts-folded state of the interlabial product more than the size in the<br>
transverse direction in the tabular shape. For instance, there is a method<br>
wherein the total size in the transverse direction of the surface side sheet is<br>
enlarged more than the total size in the transverse direction of the back side<br>
sheet, and it is joined with the surface side sheet in a state where the surface<br>
side sheet is loosened in the transverse direction. Moreover, there is a method<br>
of connecting the surface side sheet with this back side sheet, in a state where<br>
the back side sheet and the absorbent body are folded in two parts. Moreover,<br>
there is a method of making the surface side sheet elongate easily in the<br>
transverse direction, and connecting the surface side sheet and the back side<br>
sheet in the tabular shape state. At this time, besides the execution of ripple<br>
processing along the transverse direction, or the slit processing, of the surface<br>
side sheet, the maximum tensile elongation degree in the transverse direction<br>
may be set to 100% or more, as the characteristic of the surface side sheet<br>
itself. It should be remarked that it is preferable to form the surface side sheet<br>
by wet forming spun lace and make the maximum tensile elongation degree in<br>
the transverse direction 100% or more by the tendering processing, for<br>
connecting with the back side sheet, considering the simplicity of the processing<br>
process.<br>
(8) The interlabial product, wherein the back side sheet comprises a<br>
hydrophilic fiber including a fibril fiber.<br>
According to the invention of (8), the back side sheet had the hydrophilic<br>
fiber including a fibril fiber. As a result, when the interlabial product is thrown in<br>
to the toilet from the back side sheet first, the hydrophilic fiber of the back side<br>
sheet gets affinity to the water immediately. Therefore, it is possible to discard<br>
the interlabial product more surely with the discharge water of the toilet, by<br>
preventing it from coming up to the surface of the water.<br>
Moreover, the back side sheet might rub mutually when the interlabial<br>
product is worn, and the back side sheet of the interlabial product and the<br>
napkin might rub when a napkin is used together with the interlabial product.<br>
Even for this case, as the friction drag is decreased by the back side sheet, the<br>
body fluid leakage can be prevented due to getting untied of the back side<br>
sheet. In addition, the fibril fiber of the hydrophilic fiber can decrease the<br>
breakage of the back side sheet further even if the body fluid adheres to the<br>
back side sheet and makes it wet.<br>
This back side sheet is the one where a hydrophilic fiber sheet such as<br>
tissues is bonded or laminated on a film or the like having hydrolyzed<br>
biodegradable resin as raw material, in consideration of the wettability to the<br>
water when discarding it into the toilet. Here, the hydrophilic fiber sheet is the<br>
one including the fibril fiber such as the rayon and so on. Moreover, polyvinyl<br>
alcohol (PVA) film, film wherein one face or/and both faces are made<br>
water-repellent with silicon or the like, PVA film wherein silicon is blended,<br>
starch film, polylactic acid or polybutylenesuccinate, etc. may be enumerated as<br>
the film. Note that, leakage prevention function under wearing and wettability to<br>
the discharge water of the toilet when discarding might also be afforded at the<br>
same time, by adjusting the water-repellent degree through the execution of<br>
water-repellent processing to the hydrophilic fiber by sizing agent and so on.<br>
Moreover, as necessary, inorganic pigments may be blended in the back side<br>
sheet within the range of 0.1 to 5% for coloring.<br>
Moreover, those similar to the one explained as the surface side sheet,<br>
previously, can be used as a hydrophilic fiber sheet including the fibril fiber.<br>
That is, more particularly, the hydrophilic fiber sheet is a spun lace nonwoven<br>
fabric adjusted to by a specific weight per unit within the range of 20 to 60g/m2<br>
by blending a necessary amount of fiber in the range of 1 to 38mm in the fiber<br>
length, more preferably in the range of 2 to 20mm and within the range of 1.1 to<br>
3.3dtex in fineness. The fibril fiber 3 to 30 weight % and the filament 97 to 70<br>
weight % are desirable as the mixture ratio of the fibril fiber and the filament.<br>
Moreover, the specific weight per unit of the film of the back side sheet<br>
adhered to the hydrophilic fiber sheet including the fibril fiber is 19 to 40g/m2, it<br>
is joined by the embossing finish or an adhesive, and the joint rate is desirably<br>
in the range of 1 to 30%. Moreover, when it is laminated with a hydrophilic fiber<br>
sheet including the fibril fiber, the thickness of the resin to be laminated is<br>
desirably in the range of 10 to 40pm.<br>
(9) The interlabial product, comprising a mini sheet piece for inserting a<br>
finger, wherein the mini sheet piece is provided on the back side sheet and<br>
includes a fibril fiber.<br>
According to the invention of (9), the mini sheet piece to insert a finger in<br>
the garment side of the interlabial product is provided on the garment side of the<br>
back side sheet. As a result, as the labia can be pushed open by the rigidity of<br>
the finger when the interlabial product is worn between labia, it is possible to<br>
install it up to the vestibule bed surely and, as a gap is not created between the<br>
vestibule bed or the inner wall of labia and the body side of the interlabial<br>
product, the body fluid can be prevented from leaking.<br>
Moreover, as this mini sheet piece includes a fibril fiber, twining of the<br>
fiber gets untied in a large amount of water or in the water flow of the toilet, and<br>
it is resolved into small fragments. As this mini sheet piece including a fibril<br>
fiber, those used for the surface side sheet and the back side sheet<br>
above-mentioned can be used.<br>
Note that it is desirable to set the nonwoven fabric side to the garment<br>
side, considering wettability to the water when throwing into the toilet and the<br>
friction drag of the mini sheet pieces each other, if a laminate sheet bonded with<br>
a nonwoven fabric that has the fibril fiber is to be used.<br>
(10) The interlabial product is for incontinence.<br>
According to the invention of (10), the interlabial product can be used for<br>
an incontinence absorb product. That is ostium vaginae where the blood is<br>
discharged and a pee hole where urine is discharged locate between labia, and<br>
the interlabial product of the present invention to be used between labia can<br>
absorb urine also. Therefore, it can absorb urine around labia, especially<br>
around the pee hole and is useful for incontinence, especially for a light<br>
incontinence.<br>
(11) The interlabial product for absorbing vaginal discharge.<br>
According to the invention of (11), the interlabial product can be used for<br>
absorbing the vaginal discharge. That is the interlabial product is used between<br>
labia and can absorb the excretion (vaginal discharge) other than the blood<br>
from ostium vaginae. Therefore, the interlabial product can absorb the vaginal<br>
discharge in order to decrease the discomfort for the person, and is useful for<br>
the user who is not menstruating.<br>
(12) A wrapping having an interlabial product for being worn between<br>
labia and a wrapping sheet for enveloping the interlabial product inside, wherein<br>
said interlabial product comprises a water degradable surface side sheet for<br>
being in a face of the labia and a back side sheet arranged on a opposite side<br>
of the degradable surface side sheet (garment side), wherein said water<br>
degradable surface side sheet comprising a hydrophilic fiber having a filament<br>
and a fibril fiber having branch hairs branching from its surface, wherein at least<br>
a part of branch hairs make bridges between said filament and the fibril fiber,<br>
and said wrapping sheet includes a fibril fiber.<br>
According to the invention of (12), the twine among fibers, of the sheet for<br>
wrapping, gets untied in a large amount of water or in the discharge water of the<br>
toilet, and is resolved into small fragments as the sheet for wrapping composing<br>
the wrapping body includes a fibril fiber. Therefore, as the wrapping body after<br>
unsealing can be thrown into the toilet, the wrapping body can easily be<br>
discarded. Moreover, as it is unnecessary to discard the wrapping body after<br>
unsealing into a sanitary box, the finger is not smeared dirty, and when a new<br>
interlabial product is worn, the interlabial product, the inner wall of labia, and the<br>
vulva, and so on are never smeared, and it is therefore sanitary.<br>
In addition, as for the act to discard the interlabial product into the toilet<br>
bowl by detaching from between labia with urine pressure of the wearer, the<br>
interlabial product can be taken out from the between labia by gripping it via the<br>
wrapping body and thrown in the toilet bowl as it is, in case where the wearer<br>
has a sanitary aversion, or in case where she can not let the interlabial product<br>
detach from between labia, due to the body type of the wearer, even if she<br>
opens her inside of the thigh towards the toilet bowl.<br>
The material used for the above-mentioned surface side sheet and the<br>
back side sheet can be used for the sheet for wrapping. When a nonwoven<br>
fabric composed only of the fiber is used for the sheet for wrapping to decrease<br>
the load to the stream of the piping and the septic tank, the maximum<br>
elongation degree in the wet state can be improved by including the fibril fiber in<br>
the sheet for wrapping. As a result, the wrapping body is opened without<br>
damaging the sheet for wrapping and the operativeness is never impaired, even<br>
when the wearer washes her hands before wearing the interlabial product and<br>
her hands are wet. Moreover, as the barrier function thereof is high, the<br>
interlabial product can be treated sanitarily, even if it is wrapped with the sheet<br>
for wrapping when discarded, because the density of the sheet for wrapping can<br>
be improved. To improve the barrier function further, the water-repellent<br>
treatment might be performed with silicon, sizing agent, etc.<br>
(13) Fibril fiber for a water degradable product, comprising branch hairs<br>
branching from its surface.<br>
According to the invention of (13), the branch hair of the fibril fiber forms<br>
the bridge structure to twine the fiber mutually, and connects mutually fibers that<br>
compose the water degradable product. Therefore, the fibers don't easily get<br>
untied and the water degradable fiber doesn't degrade while wearing it, even in<br>
the wet state where body fluid such as menstrual blood has been absorbed. On<br>
the other hand, the bridge structure of the branch hair is gradually resolved, and<br>
the water degradable product degrades for a large amount of water such as the<br>
discharge water of the toilet.<br>
(14) A method for improving a stability of a hydrophilic fiber soaked in<br>
small quantity of water, wherein the hydrophilic fiber comprises a filament and a<br>
fibril fiber having branch hairs branching from its surface, comprising the step<br>
of; making bridges between the filament and the fibril fiber with at least in a part<br>
of the branch hairs.<br>
According to the invention of (14), as the bridge structure is formed by<br>
forming bridges between the filament and the fibril fiber each other, the uniting<br>
power between fibers can be improved, and the original form can be maintained<br>
as the hydrophilic fiber doesn't get untied in the wet state in contact with a small<br>
quantity of water.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT.<br>
Next, one embodiment of the interlabial product of the present invention<br>
shall be described referring to figures; however the present invention is not<br>
limited to this.<br>
A basic composition of the interlabial product of this embodiment shall be<br>
described. Fig. 1A is a perspective figure showing the interlabial product<br>
according to this embodiment, and Fig. 1 B is a cross-sectional view of Fig. 1A<br>
along the line X-X inside in the interlabial product according to this embodiment.<br>
[General composition of the interlabial product]<br>
An interlabial product 1 in this embodiment has an elongated thin shape,<br>
and comprises a water permeable surface side sheet facing to an inner wall of<br>
labia 2, a water permeable or non-permeable back side sheet 3 facing to the<br>
garment, and an absorbent body 4 enveloped in these sheets 2, 3 for absorbing<br>
body fluid, as shown in Fig. 1A and Fig. 1B. A mini sheet piece 5 is attached on<br>
the garment side of the back side sheet 3, across two side parts extending<br>
along the longitudinal direction of the interlabial product 1.<br>
Moreover, the interlabial product 1 is formed within the range of 50 to<br>
130mm in the length size and 30 to 80mm in the lateral size, and the thickness<br>
is desirably adjusted within the range of 2 to 20mm, for the fitness with the inner<br>
wall of labia, dropout prevention from between the labia, and blocking<br>
prevention of the piping of the toilet.<br>
Note that though the interlabial product 1 in this embodiment is plane, it is<br>
not especially limited in the present invention provided that the shape can be<br>
maintained by placing it between labia, such as the rectangular type, bottle<br>
gourd type, droplet type, etc. Moreover, though the cross-sectional view shape<br>
of the interlabial product 1 in this embodiment is hog-backed shape, the section<br>
shape is not especially limited, provided that the shape that can be maintained<br>
by placing it between labia, such as the rectangular one as shown in Fig. 2A,<br>
one folded approximately in V as shown in Fig. 2 B, and so on.<br>
[Composition material of the interlabial product]<br><br>
A surface side sheet 2 according to the present invention comprises the<br>
hydrophilic fiber composed of filament that is one single fiber and the fibril fiber<br>
provided with a lot of branch hairs branching from the surface of the fiber, as<br>
shown in Fig. 3A. At least a part of these branch hairs forms a bridge structure<br>
for mutually bridging between the filament and the neighboring fibril fiber, and<br>
the fibers are mutually connected. Here, the fiber with which the fibril fiber is not<br>
blended is shown in Fig. 3B. It can be confirmed that divergent branch hairs are<br>
intertwined with the fibers each other and the bridge structure is formed on the<br>
surface side sheet 2, by the comparison of Fig. 3A with Fig. 3B.<br>
The surface side sheet 2 is a spun lace nonwoven fabric adjusted to by a<br>
specific weight per unit within the range of 20 to 60g/m2 by blending a<br>
necessary amount of fiber in the range of 1 to 38mm in the fiber length, more<br>
preferably in the range of 2 to 20mm and within the range of 1.1 to 3.3dtex in<br>
fineness. More particularly, the surface side sheet 2 is formed into a fiber<br>
laminated body by blending the fibril fiber within the range of 3 to 30 weight %<br>
and the filament within the range of 70 to 97 weight %. Moreover, the surface<br>
side sheet 2 is produced by intertwining these blended fiber laminated bodies<br>
by the high pressure water-flow before drying, and by adjusting the density to<br>
0.08 to 0.20g/cm3.<br>
The fiber used for this surface side sheet 2 is the one to be biodegraded<br>
to gases such as carbon dioxide or methane, water, and biomasses according<br>
to the process of nature, in the presence of bacteria including the ray fungi and<br>
other microbes, and under the anaerobic or aerobic condition. Concretely, the<br>
selection is made as appropriate from biodegradable material that is<br>
biodegradable under the same environment, water dispersible material where<br>
the fibers are dispersed in fragments so as not to block the piping of the toilet in<br>
a large amount of water or the water-flow, and never to pile up in the air<br>
diffusion pipe in the septic tank, though the influence is small with the limited<br>
amount of moisture in use, and water solubility material that dissolves in a large<br>
amount of water or the water-flow, though the influence is small with the limited<br>
amount of moisture under wearing. Here, poly lactic acid fiber,<br>
polybutylenesuccinate fiber, starch film fiber, carboxymethyl cellulose fiber and<br>
so on can be listed as biodegradable material, and these fibers are used alone<br>
or two or more in combination.<br>
In addition, those free from elution material, or, free from chemical<br>
stimulation, even if elution material eludes, in the wet state under wearing is<br>
preferable, in consideration of the chemical stimulation to the wearer.<br>
As for the fiber used for this surface side sheet 2, concretely,<br>
semi-synthetic fibers such as regenerated celluloses including rayon and<br>
acetate rayon, synthetic fibers such as polypropylene, polyester, polyurethane,<br>
polyvinyl alcohol and so on may be enumerated, besides the natural fibers such<br>
as wood pulps including softwood pulps, hardwood pulps and so on, hemp,<br>
kenaves, linters pulps and so on. The one mainly composed of the rayon that is<br>
hydrophilic and that can be freely selected within the range of 1 to 38mm in the<br>
fiber length is much more desirable from the viewpoint of affinity with the<br>
menstrual blood and the fitness with the inner wall of labia.<br>
The following compositions are listed, as a concrete composition the of<br>
surface side sheet 2. For instance, the hemp fiber is fibrillated within the range<br>
of 1 to 38mm, preferably 2 to 20mm, and 100 to 400cc in the degree of beating,<br>
preferably 200 to 300cc. This fibrillated hemp fiber within the range of 3 to 30<br>
weight %, the rayon within the range of 70 to 97 weight %, 1 to 38mm in the<br>
fiber length, preferably 2 to 20mm, and 1.1 to 3dtex in the fineness are<br>
combined, and laminated at 30 to 45g/m2 by a specific weight per unit.<br>
A polyvinyl alcohol fiber is fibrillated within the range of 1 to 38mm,<br>
preferably 2 to 20mm, and 100 to 400cc in the degree of beating, preferably 200<br>
to 300cc. This fibrillated polyvinyl alcohol fiber within the range of 3 to 30 weight<br>
% and the rayon within the range of 70 to 97 weight %, 1 to 38mm in the fiber<br>
length, preferably 2 to 20mm, and 1.1 to 3.3dtex in the fineness are combined,<br>
and laminated at 30 to 45g/m2 by a specific weight per unit.<br>
The rayon is fibrillated in the range of 1 to 38mm, preferably 2 to 20mm,<br>
and 100 to 400cc in the degree of beating, preferably 200 to 300cc. This<br>
fibrillated rayon within the range of 3 to 30 weight % and the softwood pulp<br>
within the range of 70 to 97 weight %, 1 to 10mm in the fiber length,<br>
substantially 2 to 5mm, are combined, and laminated at 30 to 45g/m2 by a<br>
specific weight per unit.<br>
Further, wood pulp, linter pulp fiber, or carboxymethyl cellulose fibrillated<br>
in the range of 1 to 10mm, substantially 2 to 5mm, and 250 to 650cc in degree<br>
of beating, and the rayon of 80 to 99 weight % in the range of 1 to 38mm in fiber<br>
length, preferably 2 to 20mm, and 1.1 to 3dtex in the fineness are combined,<br>
and laminated at 30 to 45g/m2 by a specific weight per unit.<br>
Besides, this surface side sheet 2 is formed into melt blown, spun bond,<br>
point bond, through air, needle punch, wet paper, wet forming spun lace and so<br>
on, solely with the hydrophilic fiber where little hydrophilic surface active agent<br>
is adhered or blending the necessary amount. For instance, by using the spun<br>
lace method, various fibers alone or blended as necessary are intertwined by<br>
the water-flow interlacing treatment, and then the spun lace nonwoven fabric is<br>
produced. According to the spun lace method, this water-flow interlacing<br>
treatment allows detaching substantially by the water-flow, the surface active<br>
agent that adheres to the fiber to prevent the irregularity of specific weight per<br>
unit by static electricity when the fiber is untied. Therefore, as the chemical<br>
stimulation caused by the above-mentioned surface active agent is decreased,<br>
so it is more preferable. Note that, it is more preferable, in this case, to adjust<br>
+the specific weight per unit within the range of 20 to 60g/m2. The fiber density<br>
rises too high when the specific weight per unit is more than 60g/m2 and the<br>
fitness with the inner wall of labia is not attained. On the other hand, when the<br>
specific weight per unit is fewer than 20g/m2, the required strength under<br>
wearing can not be obtained.<br>
The fibril fiber is attained by the formation of branch hairs like the<br>
outgrowth of hair in a way to tear the surface of the fiber, by beating of the<br>
aforementioned single fiber. This degree of beating is 600cc or less, more<br>
preferably 100 to 400cc. Besides, it is blended with the fiber that composes the<br>
surface side sheet at least at the rate of 2 weight %, and preferably within the<br>
range of 3 to 30 weight %. When the fibril fiber is fewer than 2 weight %, it is<br>
likely to degrade while wearing it, because the bridge structure is too little and<br>
the elongation degree in the wet state doesn't improve. On the other hand, the<br>
bridge structure increases too much, when the fibril fiber is more than 30 weight<br>
% and a flexible texture of the surface side sheet might be damaged.<br>
It should be noted that as the fibril fiber, the rayon that is hydrophilic and<br>
excellent in the affinity with the menstrual blood and the fitness with the inner<br>
wall of labia, and moreover, that can be selected freely among those with long<br>
fiber length, is suitable. The rayon allows to attain the bridge structure having<br>
flexibility while preventing the filament being separated mutually, because the<br>
length of the branch hair can be lengthened, when it is fibrillated through<br>
beating, as it can be produced by the wet method or the dry method, and the<br>
fiber length can freely be selected within the range of 1 to 38mm.<br>
Here, the rayon produced by the dry method is more preferable, because<br>
the molecular arrangement of cellulose is more aligned in one direction than the<br>
one produced by the wet method, and easy to split against the power of<br>
beating.<br>
The manufacturing method of the fibril fiber by the dry method, for<br>
instance, dissolves the pulp to N-methylmorpholine oxide that is an organic<br>
solvent, forms a fiber from a nozzle, and volatilizes the solvent. Afterwards, this<br>
fiber is cut within the range of 1 to 38mm, and more preferably within the range<br>
of 2 to 20mm, and further preferably within the range of 2 to 10mm, and the size<br>
is adjusted within the range of 1.1 to 3.3dtex so that it will have biodegradability<br>
and be dispersed in small fragments in a large amount of water or in the<br>
discharged flow without maintaining its original shape,. Then, the fiber cut in the<br>
prescribed length is put into the water and fibrillated by the beating at least by<br>
600cc or less, and more preferably within the range of 100 to 400cc. As a result,<br>
the fibril fiber will be 10mm or less in the length of the branch hair, and the<br>
branch hair makes up 50 to 100% of the whole.<br><br>
The back side sheet 3 is the one in which a filmy sheet that can prevent<br>
the menstrual blood kept in the absorbent body 4 from leaking outside the<br>
interlabial product 1 and the hydrophilic fiber sheet including the fibril fiber is<br>
bonded. Concretely, a hydrophilic fiber sheet such as tissues is stuck, or<br>
laminated on the filmy sheet, in consideration of the wettability to the water<br>
when it is discarded in the toilet. Here, this hydrophilic fiber sheet is the one<br>
including the fibril fiber such as the fibrilrayon, and so on. As the filmy sheet, the<br>
polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) film, the film where the repellent treatment with silicon or<br>
the like is executed on one side or/and both sides of the PVA film blended with<br>
silicone, the starch film, and the films derived from hydrolyzed biodegradable<br>
resins such as polylactic acid or polybutylenesuccinate and so on can be listed.<br>
Note that, leakage prevention function under wearing and wettability to the<br>
discharge water of the toilet when discarding might also be afforded at the same<br>
time, by adjusting the water-repellent degree through the execution of<br>
water-repellent processing to the hydrophilic fiber by sizing agent and so on.<br>
Moreover, as necessary, inorganic pigments may be blended in the back side<br>
sheet 3 within the range of 0.1 to 5% for coloring.<br>
Moreover, those similar to the one explained in the above-mentioned<br>
surface side sheet 2 can be used as the hydrophilic fiber sheet including the<br>
fibril fiber. That is, more particularly, the hydrophilic fiber sheet is a spun lace<br>
nonwoven fabric adjusted to by a specific weight per unit within the range of 20<br>
to 60g/m2 by blending a necessary amount of fiber in the range of 1 to 38mm in<br>
the fiber length, more preferably in the range of 2 to 20mm and within the range<br>
of 1.1 to 3.3dtex in fineness. The fibril fiber within the range of 3 to 30 weight<br>
% and filament within the range of 70 to 97 weight % is preferable as the<br>
blending ratio of the fibril fiber and the filament. The specific weight per unit of<br>
the film of back side sheet 3 stuck to the hydrophilic fiber sheet including the<br>
fibril fiber is 19 to 40g/m2, it is bonded with the embossing finish or the<br>
adhesive, and the bonding rate is preferably within the range of 1 to 30%.<br>
Moreover, in case of the laminate processing with a hydrophilic fiber sheet<br>
including the fibril fiber, the thickness of the resin that is laminated is preferably<br>
within the range of 10 to 40um.<br>
The laminate processing is, concretely, executed according to the<br>
following procedure. First of all, the wet forming spun lace is produced by<br>
blending the fibrilrayon whose fiber length is 1 to 38um and fiber diameter is 1.1<br>
to 3.3dtex within the range of 3 to 30 weight %, and the rayon within the range<br>
of 70 to 97 weight %, in water where the sizing agent was blended with the fiber<br>
weight ratio of 0.05 to 1.0% to the fiber weight, and adjusting the specific weight<br>
per unit to 20 to 40g/m2. The PVA resin whose thickness is adjusted to 10 to<br>
30um is laminated on this nonwoven fabric, to attain a laminate sheet.<br><br>
Any absorbent body 4 can be used provided that it can absorb and keep<br>
the liquid (the body fluid), however, those which are bulky, hard to deform and<br>
less chemically stimulant are desirable. Moreover, as absorbent body 4, pulp,<br>
chemical pulp, rayon, acetate rayon, natural cotton, the polymer absorbent<br>
body, the fiber polymer absorbent body, and synthetic fiber can used alone or<br>
by blending thereof. Additionally, foam material and cellulose foam material to<br>
which the hydrophilic treatment is applied can be used.<br>
The absorbent body 4 is produced by making as air laid blended with<br>
polymer absorbent body, melt blown nonwoven fabric to which the hydrophilic<br>
treatment is applied, spun lace nonwoven fabric mainly composed of hydrophilic<br>
fiber, tissue, continuous foam to which the hydrophilic treatment is applied,<br>
cellulose foam, etc. At this time, the volume is adjusted properly by overlapping,<br>
and folding as necessary. Moreover, absorbent body 4 is not limited to the<br>
sheet shape, it may be used after crushing, and the form is not limited.<br>
The absorbent body 4 is a fiber which chosen, for instance, within the<br>
range of 1 to 38mm in the fiber length and, 1.1 to 3.3dtex in fiber diameters, and<br>
concretely, it is produced by the following method. First, 3 to 30 weight % of<br>
branched rayon, and 70 to 97 weight % of the rayon are blended at this rate,<br>
and the specific weight by unit is adjusted to 20 to 40g/m2. This wet forming<br>
spun lace nonwoven fabric is adjusted to the dimension of 2 to 10mm within the<br>
range of 100 to 500g/m2 in the overlapping specific weight per unit.<br><br>
It is preferable to use the one having the extensibility or the retractility at<br>
least for the transverse direction, though the material similar to the surface side<br>
sheet 2 and the back side sheet 3 mentioned above can be used as the mini<br>
sheet piece 5.<br>
As the mini sheet piece expands at least in the width direction in<br>
proportion to the size of the finger, even if the size of the fingertip of the wearer<br>
is larger than the set finger insertion opening, by using such a material for the<br>
mini sheet piece 5, the interlabial product according to the present invention can<br>
surely be used, regardless of the size of the fingertip of the wearer.<br>
Moreover, there are concretely films that are derived from the<br>
biodegradable materials such as polylactic acid, polybutylne succinate, the spun<br>
bond nonwoven fabric, the melt blown nonwoven fabric, etc. as a material used<br>
for the mini sheet piece 5. There are films, nonwoven fabrics, or the like that are<br>
derived from the water-soluble materials such as PVA and CMC, too. In<br>
addition, there are the water dissipating tissue, the spun lace nonwoven fabric,<br>
etc. mainly composed of the cellulose fiber, the regenerated cellulose fiber, and<br>
so on, too.<br>
A material suitable for the mini sheet piece 5, is a spun lace nonwoven<br>
fabric blended with a necessary amount of fiber within the range of 1 to 38mm<br>
in the fiber length, and preferably within the range of 2 to 20mm, and within the<br>
range of 1.1 to 3.3dtex in the fineness, and adjusted within the range of quantity<br>
of specific weight per unit 20 to 60g/m2, and as for the blending ratio of the fibril<br>
fiber and filament, it is 3 to 30 weight % of the fibril fiber, and 70 to 97 weight %<br>
of the filament.<br>
A laminate sheet where the nonwoven fabric including the fibril fiber is<br>
stuck may be used for the spun bond nonwoven fabric and the melt blown<br>
nonwoven fabric mainly composed of biodegradable material. At this time, it is<br>
preferable to set the nonwoven fabric including the fibril fiber to the garment<br>
face side, in view of the wettability to the discharged water of the toilet, the<br>
mutual rubbing of mini sheet pieces, and so on.<br><br>
As the adhesive used for bonding the surface side sheet 2, the<br>
absorbent body 4, the back side sheet 3, and the mini sheet piece 5 at the time<br>
of forming the interlabial product, the pressure-sensitive adhesive mainly<br>
composed of synthetic rubbers such as styrene-ethylene butadiene-styrene<br>
block copolymer (SEBS), styrene-butadiene-styrene copolymer (SBS),<br>
styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymers (SIS), the thermo-sensitive<br>
adhesive mainly composed of synthetic rubbers such as ethyl vinyl alcohol<br>
(EVA), and polyvinyl alcohol that has the water solubility or water bloating<br>
characteristic may be listed. And, these adhesives are spread in linear, spiral,<br>
atomized, Q, and others form. In addition, the embossing finish may be used for<br>
bonding in the combination with the above-mentioned adhesive, to make the<br>
shape as the product easy to be maintained, even in the wet state during the<br>
use. The emboss pattern for this may be dot, lattice, flat, and so on, without<br>
limiting to them.<br>
[Composition of the interlabial product folded in two parts]<br>
The interlabial product 1, for instance, is folded in two parts and worn<br>
between labia and, at this time, the surface side sheet 2 on the body face side<br>
that is the outermost side stretches by the thickness of the absorbent body 4<br>
even if the total size L in the transverse direction of the surface side sheet 2 in<br>
the folded state is same as the size L1 or slightly longer than the size L1 in the<br>
transverse direction of the surface side sheet 2 in the not-folded state. As a<br>
result, the point of the labia opens, and the interlabial product 1 might drop out,<br>
because a power to open the both sides edge of the folded interlabial product 1<br>
works, even if it is made to wear between labia in the two-folded state.<br>
Then, the interlabial product 1 is folded in two parts, so that the back<br>
side sheet 3 come into contact each other along the centerline in the<br>
longitudinal direction, as shown in Fig. 4. Here, the total size L in the transverse<br>
direction of the surface side sheet 2 in the folded state is, at least, the sum of<br>
the apparent size L1 (Refer to Fig. 1 B) in the transverse direction in the tabular<br>
state before folding it in two parts and the length L2 (the elongation length) that<br>
corresponded to the circumferential length of a semicircle taking the thickness<br>
of the interlabial product 1 in the state opened like the plane. As a result, the<br>
power for returning to the state before folding the interlabial product 1, namely,<br>
the power with which the both sides edge start opening can be controlled, by<br>
preventing the absorbent body 4 from pressing the surface side sheet 2.<br>
Therefore, there is no possibility of dropping out of the interlabial product 1,<br>
even if the interlabial product 1 is folded in two parts for wearing.<br>
As a method for lengthening the total size in the transverse direction of<br>
the surface side sheet 2 than the size in the transverse direction in the tabular<br>
shape, the following method may be listed. For instance, there is a method for<br>
making the total size in the transverse direction of the surface side sheet larger<br>
than the total size in the transverse direction of the back side sheet, and<br>
bonding to the back side sheet 3 with the surface side sheet 2 loosened in the<br>
transverse direction. Moreover, there is also a method of bonding the surface<br>
side sheet 2 to the back side sheet 3 in the state where this back side sheet 3<br>
and the absorbent body 4 are folded in two parts. There is also a method of<br>
making the surface side sheet 2 be easily extended in the transverse direction,<br>
and bonding the surface side sheet 2 and the back side sheet 3 in the tabular<br>
state. At this time, the ripple treatment may be applied to the surface side sheet<br>
2 along the transverse direction, and the slit may be exerted, and moreover, the<br>
maximum elongation degree in the transverse direction may be made as 100%<br>
or more, as the characteristic of the surface side sheet itself.<br>
Though the interlabial product 1 of this embodiment has the mini sheet<br>
piece 5 attached across two sides extending along the longitudinal direction of<br>
the interlabial product 1, on the garment face side of the back side sheet 3, it is<br>
not limited to this shape, for instance, you can wear the interlabial product by<br>
installing a projection on the face side (the garment face side) opposite to the<br>
body side, in place of the mini sheet piece 5, and picking this projection by two<br>
fingers. Furthermore, it may be the one that the mini sheet and the projection<br>
part are not installed at all.<br>
[Sheet for wrapping used for the wrapping body of the interlabial product]<br>
It is possible to discard the wrapping body to the flush toilet with the<br>
water-degradable interlabial product, by making the wrapping body that wraps<br>
the interlabial product water-degradable so that it will degrade in water, and<br>
consequently, the burden of wearing thereof can be removed. Therefore, it is<br>
preferable to make the sheet for wrapping the individual wrapping body to be<br>
water-degradable. The one used in the surface side sheet and the back side<br>
sheet mentioned above can be used as a material of such a sheet for wrapping.<br>
Concretely, natural fibers such as wood pulps including softwood pulps,<br>
hardwood pulps and so on, hemp, kenaves, linters pulps and so on may be<br>
enumerated. Regenerated celluloses such as rayon and acetate rayon, and<br>
synthetic fibers such as polypropylene, polyester, polyurethane, polyvinyl<br>
alcohol and so on may be enumerated. Moreover, biodegradability material<br>
contains the poly lactic acid fiber, the polybutylesuccinate fiber, the starch fiber,<br>
the carboxymethyl cellulose fiber, and so on. Among them, the one that is<br>
hydrophilic, and mainly composed of the rayon that can freely be selected within<br>
the range of 1 to 38mm in the fiber length is preferable from the viewpoint of the<br>
affinity with the menstrual blood and the fitness with the inner wall of labia. As a<br>
result, a bridge structure having flexibility while preventing the filament being<br>
separated mutually, because the length of the branch hair can be lengthened as<br>
the fibril fiber, can be attained.<br>
Besides, the sheet for wrapping is formed into melt blown, spun bond,<br>
point bond, through air, needle punch, wet paper, wet forming spun lace and so<br>
on, by blending the hydrophilic fiber where little hydrophilic surface active agent<br>
is deposited alone or the necessary amount.<br>
The fibril fiber is attained by the formation of branch hairs like the<br>
outgrowth of hair in a way to tear the surface of the fiber, by beating of the<br>
aforementioned single fiber. This degree of beating is 600cc or less, more<br>
preferably in the range of 100 to 400cc. Besides, the fibril fiber is blended with<br>
the fiber that composes the sheet for wrapping at least at the rate of 2 weight %,<br>
and preferably within the range of 3 to 30 weight %. When the fibril fiber is fewer<br>
than 2 weight %, it is likely to degrade while wearing it, because the bridge<br>
structure is too little and the elongation degree in the wet state doesn't improve.<br>
On the other hand, the bridge structure increases too much, when the fibril fiber<br>
is more than 30 weight % and a flexible texture of the sheet for wrapping might<br>
be damaged.<br>
It should be noted that as the fibril fiber, the rayon that is hydrophilic and<br>
excellent in the affinity with the menstrual blood and the fitness with the inner<br>
wall of labia, and moreover, that can be selected freely among those with long<br>
fiber length, is suitable. The rayon allows to attain the bridge structure having<br>
flexibility while preventing the filament being separated mutually, because the<br>
length of the branch hair can be lengthened, when it is fibrillated through<br>
beating, as it can be produced by the wet method or the dry method, and the<br>
fiber length can freely be selected within the range of 1 to 38mm.<br>

(the tensile strength) and the water dispersibility of the surface side sheet itself,<br>
and the practicability (the state on the surface under wearing) of the interlabial<br>

the temperature of 120°C and an air set to the volume of air of 25m/sec is jetted<br>
at 160oC) for drying, to produce a wet forming spun lace nonwoven fabric whose<br>
the density is adjusted to 0.140g/cm3 (corresponding value; 140kg/m3).<br><br>
The surface side sheet was produced according to the following<br>
procedures. First of all, the rayon with 1.7dtex in the fineness and 5mm in the<br>
fiber length at the rate of 60 weight %, the rayon (the one that is 300cc in<br>
beating) with 1.7dtex in the fineness and 5mm in the fiber length at the rate of<br>

[Comparative example]<br>
A surface side sheet where the fibril fiber produced by beating rayon with<br>
600cc was blended, and a surface side sheet where the fibril fiber was not<br>
blended were used as the comparative example.<br><br>
The surface side sheet was produced according to the following<br>
procedures. First of all, the rayon with 1.7dtex in the fineness and 5mm in the<br>
fiber length at the rate of 60 weight %, the fibrilrayon (the one that is 600cc in<br>
beating) with 1 Jdtex in the fineness and 5mm in the fiber length at the rate of<br>

water-flow quantity (corresponding value; 1.68l/cm ¦ min) from two lines of<br>
nozzles (nozzle diameter 92pm and nozzle pitch 0.5mm) disposed in parallel to<br>
make a sheet. Following this, these fibers transformed into a sheet pass<br>
through the dry process of two parallel lines (the sheet is sent along a roll set to<br>
the temperature of 120°C and an air set to the volume of air of 25m/sec is jetted<br>
at 160°C) for drying, to produce a wet forming spun lace nonwoven fabric whose<br>
the density is adjusted to 0.136g/cm3 (corresponding value; 136kg/m3).<br><br>
The surface side sheet was produced according to the following<br>
procedures. First of all, the rayon with 1.7dtex in the fineness and 5mm in the<br>
fiber length at the rate of 60 weight %, the fibrilrayon (the one that is 600cc in<br>
beating) with 1.7dtex in the fineness and 5mm in the fiber length at the rate of<br>
30 weight %, and the softwood pulp at the rate of 10 weight % are blended.<br>
Next, these blended fibers are laminated by a specific weight per unit of<br>
40.8g/m2 and fibers are intertwined mutually by a water-flow of 160kg/cm2 total<br>
hydraulic pressure (corresponding value; 15.68MN/m2), 1680cc/cm ¦ min total<br>
water-flow quantity (corresponding value; 1.68l/cm ¦ min) from two lines of<br>
nozzles (nozzle diameter 92um and nozzle pitch 0.5mm) disposed in parallel to<br>
make a sheet. Following this, these fibers transformed into a sheet pass<br>
through the dry process of two parallel lines (the sheet is sent along a roll set to<br>
the temperature of 120°C and an air set to the volume of air of 25m/sec is jetted<br>
at 160°C) for drying, to produce a wet forming spun lace nonwoven fabric whose<br>
the density is adjusted to 0.138g/cm3 (corresponding value; 138kg/m3).<br><br>
The surface side sheet was produced according to the following<br>
procedures. First of all, the rayon with 1.7dtex in the fineness and 5mm in the<br>
fiber length at the rate of 60 weight %, and the softwood pulp at the rate of 40<br>
weight % are blended. Next, these blended fibers are laminated by a specific<br>
weight per unit of 39.4g/m2 and fibers are intertwined mutually by a water-flow<br>
of 160kg/cm2 total hydraulic pressure (corresponding value; 15.68MN/m2),<br>
1680cc/cm-min total water-flow quantity (corresponding value; 1.681/cm-min)<br>
from two lines of nozzles (nozzle diameter 92um and nozzle pitch 0.5mm)<br>
disposed in parallel to make a sheet. Following this, these fibers transformed<br>
into a sheet pass through the dry process of two parallel lines (the sheet is sent<br>
along a roll set to the temperature of 120°C and an air set to the volume of air<br>
of 25m/sec is jetted at 160°C) for drying, to produce a wet forming spun lace<br>
nonwoven fabric whose the density is adjusted to 0.147g/cm3 (corresponding<br>
value; 147kg/m3).<br><br>
The surface side sheet was produced according to the following<br>
procedures. First of all, rayon with 2.2dtex in the fineness and 51mm in the fiber<br>
length is laminated by a specific weight per unit of 40.5g/m2 and intertwined<br>
mutually by a water-flow of 140kg/cm2 total hydraulic pressure (corresponding<br>
value; 13.72MN/m2), 2000cc/cm ¦ min total water-flow quantity (corresponding<br>

laminated body by 70m/min. Following this, this fiber transformed into a sheet is<br>
dried by sending an air flow set to the temperature of 110°C, 2m/sec by a rate of<br>
70m/min, to produce a dry forming spun lace nonwoven fabric whose the<br>
density is adjusted to 0.081g/cm3 (corresponding value; 81kg/m3).<br><br>
The tensile strength was measured for the examples 1 to 4 of the<br>
surface side sheet that comprises the filament and the fibril fiber with branch<br>
hairs formed by the degree of beating of 300cc, the surface side sheet made of<br>
the fiber blended with the fibril fiber having branch hairs formed by a degree of<br>
beating of 600cc and the comparative examples 1 to 3 of the fiber surface side<br>
sheet not blended with the fibril fiber. Concretely, the test piece, was cut out<br>
vertically or horizontally by the width of 25mm and measured by a Tensilon<br>
tensile test machine (RTA-100, made by Orientec Co., Ltd.) with chuck distance<br>
of 50 mm and at the speed of 100mm/min (corresponding value; 6m/h).<br>
Note that, in wet, the tensile strength was measured by the following<br>
procedures. First of all, the test piece was weighed in advance, and the artificial<br>
menstrual blood described below was jetted in mist by spreading all over the<br>
test piece until attaining 500% of its weight. Afterwards, this test piece was<br>
coated with a liquid impermeability material, and left for one minute under the<br>
environment of 20^ and 60% in humidity, and then it was examined. Table 1<br>
shows the results thereof.<br>
As the result, it was observed that the elongation degree after fracture<br>
increases in wet of 500% than in dry, for the examples 1 to 4 of blending the<br>
fibril fiber beaten with 300cc. Moreover, it was also observed that, when the<br>
ratio of the fibril fiber increases, the elongation degree after fracture in wet of<br>
500% increases. On the other hand, an increase in the elongation degree after<br>
fracture in wet of 500% was not observed in the comparative examples 1, 2 of<br>
the blending the fibril fiber beaten with 600cc and the comparative example 3 of •<br>
not blending the fibril fiber. Moreover, the elongation degree after fracture in wet<br>
of 500% was low as 10% or less and easy to break.<br>
Thus, for the examples 1 to 4, in the wet state after having the absorbed<br>
body fluid such as the menstrual blood and so on, the elongation degree<br>
increases more than in the dry state, and moreover, the tensile strength also<br>
increases compared with the case not blended with the fibril fiber, allowing to<br>
confirm the stability of the wet state.<br>
It should be noted that the artificial menstrual blood in the present<br>
invention means a liquid adjusted according to the following procedures.<br>
Sodium carboxylmethylcellulose (NaCMC) of 8g are added little by little while<br>
stirring into glycerin of 80g, for prepare a solution 1. Next, the solution 1<br>
prepared previously is added little by little while stirring by an agitator to one liter<br>
of ion exchange water. After the solution 1 is added, sodium chloride (NaCI) of<br>
10g and sodium hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO3) are added little by little, stirred<br>
and dispersed (stirred for three hours at the max rotation by the agitator<br>
LABO-STIRRER L-35 made by Yamato Co., Ltd.). For all of the aforementioned<br>
reagents, Wako 1st class reagents shall be used. Next, food dyes (made by<br>
KOYO Produc Co., Ltd.): the red No.102 of 8g, the red No.2 of 2g, the yellow<br>
No.5 of 2g are added for one liter of ion exchange water and stirred (stirred for<br>
one hour at the max rotation by the agitator LABO-STIRRER L-35 made by<br>
Yamato Co., Ltd.), and the viscosity measured by a viscosity finder<br>
(VISMETRON) made by Sibaura System Co., Ltd.) is assumed to be 22 to<br>
26mPa-s.<br><br>
As for the water dispersibility of the surface side sheet of the examples<br>
1 to 4, the time for the surface side sheet to be dispersed in water like<br>
fragments and not to maintain the original shape any more was tested by the<br>
water degradation test described below, comparing with the surface sheet of the<br>
comparative example 4. Table 2 shows the result thereof.<br>
In the examples 1 to 4, the surface side sheet was dispersed within about<br>
40 seconds and the original shape of the sheet was not maintained, thus<br>
allowing to confirm such a water degradability that it can be discarded into the<br>
toilet.<br>
Besides, the water degradability was examined according to the following<br>
procedures. The test piece is made by preparing the surface side sheet to<br>
100mm x100mm and the test piece formed like the parachute is introduced into<br>
water from the sharp tip thereof, while stirring 300ml of water in a cylindrical<br>
container by the speed of rotation 600 rpm by a magnetic stirrer (Torcon stirrer<br>
MM-ST with speed meter made by Mitamura Manufacturing Co., Ltd.). Then,<br>
the time until a wad of the fiber disappears is measured. The chip that is used<br>
for stirring is a disk of 35mm in diameter, and 12mm in height.<br>
state on the surface under wearing )&gt;<br>
For the examples 1 to 4 of the surface side sheet that comprises the<br>
filament and the fibril fiber with branch hairs formed by the degree of beating of<br>
300cc, the surface side sheet made of the fiber blended with the fibril fiber<br>
having branch hairs formed by a degree of beating of 600cc and the<br>
comparative examples 1 to 3 of the fiber surface side sheet not blended with the<br>
fibril fiber, the menstrual blood absorption quantity in the interlabial product and<br>
the state on the surface after it has been worn were confirmed, as following that<br>
the interlabial product was formed using respective surface sheets, to be worn<br>
for about two hours by ten women on the second day of the menstruation. In<br>
wearing it, it was worn together with a napkin made by Uni-Charm Corporation,<br>
the brand name "Sofy Sara fin (the registered trademark)". Table 3 shows the<br>
results of the examination.<br>
It was confirmed that there was no evil in use, though little fuzz was<br>
observed in the example 1. In the examples 2 to 4, it was confirmed the original<br>
shape has been conserved almost completely without damage. On the other<br>
hand, for the comparative examples 1, 2, it was torn, and the fiber from the<br>
surface side sheet remained inside the body. Moreover, it was confirmed that it<br>
was torn, though the fiber did not remain inside the body, for the comparative<br>
example 3.<br>
As for the interlabial product used for the above-mentioned examination,<br>
it concerns the one having the rectangle shape of 46mm in width * 86mm in<br>
length as shown in Fig. 5 composed of a surface side sheet, an absorbent body,<br>
a back side sheet, and a mini sheet piece overlaid in this order and a flap part<br>
composed of a surface side sheet, a back side sheet, and a mini sheet piece is<br>
formed with the width of 3mm outside the edge part thereof.<br>
The above-mentioned interlabial product is, concretely, the one produced<br>
according to the following procedures. The absorbent body has a size of 40 mm<br>
wide * 80 mm long, pulp flocculated by a pulp crusher and laminated by a<br>
specific weight per unit of 250g/m2 and pressed to the thickness of 6 mm. The<br>
back side sheet is a nonwoven fabric of water-soluble paper of 18g/m2 in a<br>
specific weight per unit, laminated to the thickness of 20um with<br>
polybutylenesuccinate resin. The mini sheet piece is a film of 20pm in the<br>
thickness that is formed with polybutylenesuccinate resin. First, the<br>
thermo-sensitive type pot melt of which the principal ingredient is SEBS is<br>
applied in spiral by the weight of 3g/m2 in a specific weight per unit over an area<br>
of 5mm in width, 40mm in length on the body side of the back side sheet, and<br>
the absorbent body is overlapped. Next, the surface side sheet is placed on the<br>
body side of the absorbent body, and the surrounding of the absorbent body is<br>
heat-sealed by the embossing finish of 2mm in width, the surface side sheet<br>
and the back side sheet are bonded mutually, to seal thereby the absorbent<br>
body. Following this, the mini sheet piece is arranged over the length of 60mm<br>
from the edge of the interlabial product on the garment face side of the back<br>
side sheet, and a breadth that allows inserting the finger between the mini sheet<br>
piece and the back side sheets, is formed. Next, the both side parts of the mini<br>
sheet piece and the back side sheet are bonded with the hot melt of which the<br>
principal ingredient is SEBS, so that the width of this breadth may become<br>
25mm.<br>
The water dispersibility in throwing into the toilet was examined by<br>
discarding the interlabial product using each surface side sheet to the flush<br>
toilet shown in Fig. 6, and confirming the degraded situation of the interlabial<br>
product thereafter by watching with eyes, for the examples 1 to 4 and the<br>
comparative example 4 of the surface side sheet. Note that the composition of<br>
the interlabial product using each surface side sheet was assumed to be the<br>
same as those explained in the above-mentioned 
interlabial product that uses the surface side sheet &gt;<br>
As a result, the interlabial product that uses the surface side sheet of<br>
examples 1 to 4 and the comparative example 4 flowed without being blocked in<br>
the distributing pipe by a single flush, and reached the septic tank. Afterwards,<br>
the interlabial product that uses the surface side sheet of the examples 1 to 4<br>
began to untie the mutual twining of fibers that compose the surface side sheet<br>
from about the third day in contact with a large amount of water, and the surface<br>
side sheet was dispersed in fragments on the fourth day, secede the absorbent<br>
body arranged on the back side of the surface side sheet, and the original<br>
shape of the interlabial product was completely lost. On the other hand, the<br>
interlabial product that uses the surface side sheet of the comparative example<br>
4 did not untie the mutual twining of fibers that composes the surface side sheet<br>
even in contact with a large amount of water, and the original shape of the<br>
interlabial product was kept.<br>
Thus, as the interlabial product that uses the surface side sheet of the<br>
examples 1 to 4 degrades gradually from the surface side sheet after it was<br>
discarded to the septic tank, disperses, and loses the original shape of the<br>
interlabial product, it was confirmed that even the check trader of the septic tank<br>
was not able to recognize the product after use, and it was excellent for the<br>
public health.<br>
The flush toilet used for the examination is composed of a European style<br>
toilet 6 of the semi-siphon type that has a trap part 6a, a septic tank 7, and<br>
piping 8 that connects these European style toilet 6 and the septic tank 7, as<br>
shown in Fig. 6. In this flush toilet, the displacement of a single flush is eight<br>
liters. The diameter of the trap part 6a of the European style toilet 6 is 53mm.<br>
Piping 8 is 100mm in diameter, 1/100 in gradient, and 10m in length. Septic<br>
tank 7 is a single processing septic tank filled only with tap water.<br>
For this examination, the toilet paper was cut out by 2m, when the<br>
interlabial product was thrown into the toilet; this cut out toilet paper was divided<br>
into substantially equal three pieces, and each of these three pieces were<br>
rounded moderately, and thrown into the discharge hole. Afterwards, the<br>
interlabial product was thrown into the discharge hole, the discharged water<br>
was poured, and it was drained out. Toilet paper was used by overlapping two<br>
water soluble tissues of114mm in width and 18g/m2 in a specific weight per unit.<br>
The reason to discard the interlabial product with toilet paper is that it is a<br>
common practice for women wearing the interlabial product to wipe off the<br>
menstrual blood attached to the labia by using toilet paper, after the interlabial<br>
product has been used, besides the time when they do their needs. Moreover,<br>
the length of toilet paper was assumed to be 2m, because the average amount<br>
of use of toilet paper per time by women is about 2m.<br>
Next, the example that uses the fiber sheet including the fibril fiber for the<br>
wrapping body that wraps the water degradable interlabial product shall be<br>
described as for the property of the sheet for wrapping itself (the tensile<br>
strength) and the water dispersibility, in comparison with the comparative<br>
example using the fiber sheet not including the fibril fiber.<br><br>
The sheet for wrapping was produced according to the following<br>
procedures. First of all, the rayon with 1.7dtex in the fineness and 5mm in the<br>
fiber length at the rate of 40 weight %, the fibrilrayon (the one that is 300cc in<br>
beating) with 1.7dtex in the fineness and 5mm in the fiber length at the rate of<br>
15 weight %, and the softwood pulp at the rate of 45 weight % are blended.<br>
Next, these blended fibers are laminated by a specific weight per unit of<br>
30.3g/m2 and fibers are intertwined mutually by a water-flow of 160kg/cm2 total<br>
hydraulic pressure (corresponding value; 15.68MN/m2), 1680cc/cnvmin total<br>
water-flow quantity (corresponding value; 1.681/cm ¦ min) from two lines of<br>
nozzles (nozzle diameter 92pm and nozzle pitch 0.5mm) disposed in parallel to<br>
make a sheet. Following this, these fibers transformed into a sheet pass<br>
through the dry process of two parallel lines (the sheet is sent along a roll set to<br>
the temperature of 120°C and an air set to the volume of air of 25m/sec is jetted<br>
at 160°C) for drying, to produce a wet forming spun lace nonwoven fabric whose<br>
the density is adjusted to 0.140g/cm3 (corresponding value; 140kg/m3).<br><br>
The sheet for wrapping was produced according to the following<br>
procedures. First of all, the rayon with 1.7dtex in the fineness and 5mm in the<br>
fiber length at the rate of 50 weight %, the fibrilrayon (the one that is 300cc in<br>
beating) with 1.7dtex in the fineness and 5mm in the fiber length at the rate of<br>
20 weight %, and the softwood pulp at the rate of 30 weight % are blended.<br>
Next, these blended fibers are laminated by a specific weight per unit of<br>
31.5g/m2 and fibers are intertwined mutually by a water-flow of 160kg/cm2 total<br>
hydraulic pressure (corresponding value; 15.68MN/m2), 1680cc/cnvmin total<br>
water-flow quantity (corresponding value; 1.68l/cm ¦ min) from two lines of<br>
nozzles (nozzle diameter 92um and nozzle pitch 0.5mm) disposed in parallel to<br>
make a sheet. Following this, these fibers transformed into a sheet pass<br>
through the dry process of two parallel lines for drying (the sheet is sent along a<br>
roll set to the temperature of 120^ and an air set to the volume of air of<br>
25m/sec is jetted at 160^) to produce a wet forming spun lace nonwoven fabric<br>
whose the density is adjusted to 0.142g/cm3 (corresponding value; 142kg/m3).<br><br>
The sheet for wrapping was produced according to the following<br>
procedures. First of all, rayon with 2.2dtex in the fineness and 38mm in the fiber<br>
length is laminated by a specific weight per unit of 29.4g/m2 and intertwined<br>
mutually by a water-flow of 140kg/cm2 total hydraulic pressure (corresponding<br>
value; 13.72MN/m2), 2000cc/cm ¦ min total water-flow quantity (corresponding<br>
value;2.000l/cm-min) from 3 lines of nozzles (nozzle diameter 92um and nozzle<br>
pitch 0.5mm) disposed in parallel to make a sheet, while transferring this fiber<br>
laminated body by 70m/min. Following this, this fiber transformed into a sheet is<br>
dried by sending an air flow set to the temperature of 110t:, 2m/sec by a rate of<br>
70m/min, to produce a dry forming spun lace nonwoven fabric whose the<br>
density is adjusted to 0.100g/cm3 (corresponding value; 100kg/m3).<br>
sheet for wrapping&gt;<br>
The examination was performed by a method similar to the examination<br>
of the aforementioned  and 
dispersibility of the surface sheet&gt; for the examples 5, 6 of the sheet for<br>
wrapping that comprises the filament and the fibril fiber where branch hairs are<br>
formed and the comparative example 5 of the sheet for wrapping comprising the<br>
fiber not blended with the fibril fiber. Table 4 shows the results thereof.<br>
As a result, it was recognized that, when it was wet, the elongation<br>
degree after fracture increased more than when it was dry, and the elongation<br>
degree after fracture in the wet state increased when the ratio of the fibril fiber<br>
increased, in the examples 5, 6 that used the sheet for wrapping blended the<br>
fibril fiber. On the other hand, an increase in the elongation degree after fracture<br>
when it was wet was not observed in the comparative example 5 without a fibril<br>
fiber. Moreover, the sheet for wrapping disperses in water within about 30<br>
seconds, and loses its original shape, and it was able to be confirmed to have<br>
the water degradability suitable for discarding in the toilet in the examples 5, 6.<br>
Thus, for the examples 5, 6 also, similarly to the surface side sheet, in the<br>
wet state after having absorbed the menstrual blood or other body fluids, the<br>
elongation degree increases more than in the dry state, and moreover, the<br>
elongation strength also increases compared with the case not blended the fibril<br>
fiber, and the stability in the wet state was able to be confirmed. Moreover, it<br>
was also confirmed to have the water degradability suitable for discarding in the<br>
toilet.<br>
Note that, though the rayon, the fibrilrayon, and the softwood pulp were<br>
combined and used as the fiber that composes the surface side sheet and the<br>
sheet for wrapping in this example, the combination is not limited to this, but<br>
arbitrary ones among the aforementioned hydrophilic fibers may be combined,<br>
and used, or you may also use one of these hydrophilic fibers.<br>
According to the present invention, the surface side sheet used for the<br>
interlabial product is made of hydrophilic fiber composed of filament and the<br>
fibril fiber provided with branch hairs branching from the surface, and at least a<br>
part of the branch hairs is made in a bridge structure where the filament and the<br>
fibril fiber bridge mutually. As a result, it doesn't become a problem in wearing,<br>
because the fiber doesn't easily get untied mutually, in the wet state with the<br>
absorbed body fluid such as the menstrual blood, as the uniting power between<br>
fibers can be improved, and it doesn't break while wearing it. On the other hand,<br>
it is possible to throw it into the flush toilet as it is, and the burden of the waste<br>
disposal and so on after use can be removed, because this bridge structure<br>
decomposes gradually, and degrades to a degree to lose the original shape as<br>
the sheet, against a large amount of water, such as the running water of the<br>
toilet and so on.<br>
Moreover, the hand does not get dirty, because it becomes unnecessary<br>
to handle with hands the interlabial product that has absorbed the body fluid<br>
such as the menstrual blood after use, as it can be thrown into the toilet as it is.<br>
Therefore, when a new interlabial product is to be worn, it is sanitary because<br>
the interlabial product will not be soiled.<br>
Moreover, it degrades gradually from the surface side sheet, disperses in<br>
the water, and loses the original shape of the interlabial product, even if it is<br>
thrown into the flush toilet as it is after the interlabial product is used, and<br>
consequently, even the check trader of the septic tank cannot recognize the<br>
product after use visually, and moreover, it is also excellent for the public<br>
health.<br>
Even if the interlabial product is thrown from the back side sheet to the<br>
toilet, the hydrophilic sheet installed on the garment face side of the back side<br>
sheet has the affinity immediately, by arranging the hydrophilic fiber sheet<br>
including the fibril fiber on the clothes side of the back side sheet which is liquid<br>
impermeable. Therefore, it is possible to discard it surely with the discharged<br>
water, by preventing the interlabial product from coming to the surface of the<br>
water. Moreover, the back side sheets might rub mutually when the interlabial<br>
product is worn, and the back side sheet of the interlabial product and the<br>
sanitary napkin might rub when the napkin is used together with the interlabial<br>
product. Even for such a case, as the friction is decreased by the back side<br>
sheet, the leak of the menstrual blood can be prevented from being caused as<br>
the back side sheet is untied. In addition, even if the back side sheet is soaked<br>
with the menstrual blood and it is wet, as the hydrophilic fiber sheet contains the<br>
fibril fiber, the bridge structure of this fibril fiber can decrease the breakage of<br>
the back side sheet further.<br>
Moreover, as the surface side sheet according to the present invention<br>
and the interlabial product that uses this surface side sheet are not those<br>
achieving the water degradability by the composition of the resin, itchy, rough<br>
skin or other symptoms are not caused by the component eluded from the resin.<br>
Besides, as the individuafwrapping body wrapping the interlabial product,<br>
is composed by containing the fibril fiber similarly to the surface side sheet, the<br>
individual wrapping body becomes water degradable and, consequently, it is<br>
possible to discard it into the flush toilet as it is, and the burden of separate<br>
disposal of the wrapping body after opening the seal can be removed.<br>
