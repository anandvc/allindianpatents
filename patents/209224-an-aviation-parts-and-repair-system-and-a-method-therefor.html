This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/175,178, filed January 7, 2000, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to customer services, and more specifically to methods and systems for accessing turbine engine aircraft components repair order information and services.<br>
Manufacturers of aircraft engines normally provide repair and inspection services for engine and engine components. However, after an inspection of the engine has been completed, or engine component parts sent in for repair have been repaired, communicating the inspection results to engine owners, e.g. customers, has typically been a time consuming and potentially frustrating process for both the engine manufacturer and the customer. Currently communicating inspection results from incoming inspections of aircraft engines or component parts typically involves reporting the results in tabular form, and submitting the reports to customers via mail or facsimile. In addition, variations in the inspections of different facilities is a source of customer concern.<br>
It would be desirable to provide incoming inspection reports to customers which include information in addition to known tabular reports. Since, customers often desire photographs of damaged components or parts found during the incoming inspections, it would be further desirable to have a systenvcapability that provides customers with photographs of damaged components or parts found during incoming inspections. It would be further desirable to provide quotes for repair services, linkage to new spare parts replenishment, and inspection standardization to reduce variations between repair facilities.<br>

As shown in Figure 2, a user 32 accesses system 10 using client system 16 (shown in Figure 1) via an intranet interface 34. In an alternative embodiment, user 32 accesses system 10 via an Internet interface (not shown). In the exemplary embodiment shown in Figure 2, user 32 accesses inspection application 24 to enter information regarding aircraft engine inspection details. For example, user 32 inputs digital images of at least one of non-repairable parts, materials and quotes for repair items for storage in OFR database 20 with linked reference to OSB database 22. However, prior to accepting any information for storage, inspection application 24 authenticates user 32 by validating the user supplied information against the pre-stored user profile in system 10 by the system administrator. The function of validation and authentication is performed by user authentication application 28 which resides on server 14. In one embodiment, inspection application 24 uses a lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) to authenticate users 32 and customers 36. In addition, in the exemplary embodiment, a user level access permission level is required on quote approvals. An exemplary approval is an "approval button" permitting the user to provide approval authority directly through system 10. The approval button is displayed on the user interface only if user 32 has quote approval authority.<br>
Typically customer 36 accesses system 10 at one of client systems 16 (shown in Figure 1), via an external interface 38, such as the Internet. Once customer 36 is verified as an authorized user, or alternatively registered and accepted as a new customer, access is granted to OFR application 18. Using OFR application 18, customer 36 submits queries as repair orders, including filtering criteria, by accessing OSB application 22 and OFR database 30. Using OFR application 18, purchase order details are retrieved from OSB application 22 according to particular customer details, and repair order details populated with OFR database 30. In one embodiment, filtering is date-driven. For example, as a result of filtering, purchase orders between a current date and a date three months previous are retrieved. Additionally, in other embodiments, purchase orders are sortable and viewable for customer 36 (or user 32) by purchase order receipt date, customer name, or by purchase order number. When a<br>
-6-<br><br>
purchase order is viewed, details displayed include a purchase order number, a purchase order receipt date, a shop order number, displayed as a link, a part name, part number, an image (if available), and a status of a quote for the part.<br>

image 152 of the part to be scrapped, a serial number 154 and a description of the inspection findings 156 is also displayed.<br>
The above described repair information system provides customer access to critical repair information concerning aircraft engines owned by the customer. Having access to such information permits a customer to make business decisions regarding aircraft routing, cost of repairs, whether to replace or scrap parts just to name a few.<br>
Figure 8 is a flow chart 200 utilized by aircraft engine repair system 10. Under the web-based system 10 (shown in Figure 1), the user accesses 210 home page of the web site through client system 16 (shown in Figure 1). Server system 14 (shown in Figure 1) downloads 220 and displays 230 several options. Once the user selects 240 a specific option out of various hypertext links, the request is sent to server system 14. Selecting 240 a specific option is accomplished either by click of a mouse or by a voice command. The selected option is transmitted 260 to server system 14. Once server system 14 receives 270 a request, server system 14 accesses 280 databases and applications 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28 (shown in Figure 1) and retrieves 290 pertinent information from databases (shown in Figure 1). The requested information is downloaded 292 and provided 300 to client system 14 (shown in Figure 1) from server 14. Server system 14 provides 300 the requested information to the user by either displaying 310 the information on the user's display or by printing 312 it to an attached or a remote printer. The user continues to search various databases for other information, updates 330 the database 20 by adding 334 folders or files, deleting 336 folders or files to database 20 with new or revised information, or exits 350 from system 10.<br>
Updated information 354 is received 356 by server system 14 for storing 358 in appropriate databases. The user also updates 330 the database 20 by adding, deleting or modifying the information regarding a specific engine component(s). In another embodiment, client system 16, as well as server system 14, are protected from access by unauthorized individuals. As described, system 10 is an interactive searchable database 20 for all inspection &amp; repair information and provides flexibility to users to stay current with up-to-date information. The system provides the ability for users to directly update, review and generate quotations based on current information and provide up to date information to customers for their review,<br>
-9-<br><br>
Figure 9 is yet another exemplary embodiment of a method flow chart 400 utilized by the aircraft engine repair system. The method practiced by system 10 is a method for accessing inspection and repair information by internal users and external customers using a aircraft engine repair system Method 400 improves communication and customer satisfaction. Method 400 is practiced by logging 404 onto the system through a network. Method 400 comprises the steps of receiving 410 inspection information. The information that is gathered is gathered via an intranet data capture screen and image capture workstation 414.<br>
Receiving 410 inspection information includes receiving detailed visual inspection information for aircraft engine component parts submitted for repair as well as costs associated with repairing component parts by parts serial numbers. The information received also includes at least one of an aircraft component part repair status, a part non-repair status, a type of repair to be conducted, a primary non-repairable defect status including a cause of non-reparability, digital images of the primary non-repairable defect, and a quote for repairing the type of the repair by the part serial number. Method 400 further comprises the step of updating 420 the centralized database with the received information, receiving 430 an inquiry from a customer to obtain the inspection information, and finally retrieving 440 the inspection information from the centralized database by downloading 450 the requested information in response to the inquiry. The information downloaded includes the part repair status, a part non-repair status, a type of repair to be conducted, a primary non-repairable defect status including a cause of non-reparability, digital images of the primary non-repairable defect, and a quote for repairing the type of the repair by the part serial number. Once the customer reviews the quote, the customer makes the decision 460 to approve or disapprove the quote. If the quote is approved 464, the customer enters the approval in system 10 thereby facilitating the authorization 468 to the business entity to proceed with the work. If the customer decides not to accept 470 the quote, the message is sent to the business entity to not to proceed with the work. In such event, the revision of the quote may be warranted.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, once the information is retrieved 440 from the centralized database 20 by downloading 450, the customer reviews and analyzes 480 the information since no action on the part of the customer is required.  When no action is required from the customer, the retrieved information<br>
-10-<br><br>
serves to improve communication with the customer. The customer or the internal user continues reviewing the data or exit 490 from the system. As discussed earlier, system 10 is designed to facilitate communication of inspection and repair information as well as seek approval on repair estimates through the network to expedite the process.<br>
While the invention has been described in terms of various specific embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the claims.<br>
