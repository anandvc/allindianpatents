FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention provides a novel sustained release composition comprising alprazolam.<br>
INTRODUCTION:<br>
Benzodiazepines are a class of compounds, commonly known as tranquillizers and sleeping pills. Benzc Jiazepines are minor tranquillizers that affect the central nervous system by slowing down the body physically, mentally and emotionally as referred in patent US 3 849 434. The benzodiazepines act upon the central nervous system to reduce communication between certain neurons, lowering the level of activity in the brain. The benzodiazepines are a class of drugs with sedatives, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant properties as referred in patent US 3 109 843 including hypnotic and amnestic properties. Benzodiazepines are often used for short-term relief of severe, disabling anxiety or insomnia. The most common benzodiazepines prescribed are Xanax (Alprazolam), Valium (Diazepam), Serepax (Oxazepam), and Temazepam. Benzodiazepines act as CNS inactivators.<br>
Alprazolam i.e. (8-chloro-l-methyl-6-phenyl-4H-s-triazolo [4,3-a] [1,4]) benzodi-azepine, which has been cited in US 3, 987, 052. According to the USFDA approval of alprazolam is used for the treatment of anxiety disorders and panic attacks. Anxiety disorders are characterized by unrealistic worry and apprehension, causing symptoms of restlessness, aches, trembling, shortness of breath, smothering sensation, palpitations, sweating, cold clammy hands, lightheadedness, flushing, exaggerated startle responses, problems concentrating, and insomnia. Panic attacks occur either unexpectedly or in certain situations (i.e. driving), and can require higher dosages of alprazolam. Xanax is also used in the treatment of panic disorder, which appears as unexpected panic attacks and may by accompanied by a fear of open spaces called agoraphobia.<br><br>
The immediate-release Alprazolam tablet formulation is currently marketed as Xanax ® tablets by PHARMACIA AND UPJOHN. (Ref: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/). Xanax® is delivered as an oral tablet with various strengths like 0.25mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg and 2 mg.<br>
2<br><br>
The extended-release Alprazolam tablet formulation is currently marketed as Xanax® XR tablets by PHARMACIA AND UPJOHN. (Ref: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/). These tablets are marketed as an oral tablet in the dose strengths of 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, and 3 mg.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Alprazoalm can be delivered via two methods. The first one being the immediate release mode. The immediate-release Alprazolam (XANAX ®) can be prescribed for administration of up to four doses per day for treatment of anxiety and, in some instances, in excess of four doses per day for treatment of panic disorders disclosed in US 2004/0006072 Al. However, such frequency of dosing is bothersome and can adversely affect patient stability. Further, breakthrough anxiety can be a problem in current dosing methods.<br>
The non immediate-release delivery systems may be broadly divided into following categories. (Ref: Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition, Mack Publishing Company, Page 1677)<br>
a)	Delayed release: These release systems are those, which use repetitive, intermittent dosings of a drug from one or more immediate release units incorporated into a single dosage form. This release system provides a patient compliance, however, it does not produce or maintain uniform drug blood levels within the therapeutic range.<br>
b)	Site-Specific and receptor release: This release system refers to a targeting of a drug directly to a certain biological location.<br>
c)	Sustained-release: This system includes any drug delivery system that achieves slow release of drug over an extended period of time. If the system is successful at maintaining constant drug levels in the blood or target tissue, it is considered a controlled-release system. If it is unsuccessful at this, but extends the duration of action over that achieved by conventional delivery, it is considered a prolonged release system.<br>
Xanax ® tablet, which is an immediate release formulation of Alprazolam, are designated to be divided by the patient into equally sized portions for dose control as disclosed in Physicians Desk Reference, 58th edition (2004), pp 2798-2802. The immediate release tablet needs to be taken at frequent intervals. The shortcoming faced in the immediate release is maintaining the drug concentration in the blood level. As the drug level is not maintained, there exists peaks and trough<br>
3<br><br>
phenomena. Further, once the drug level descends down, during the trough interval, the panic attacks during this interval might create problems as referred in patent US 2004/0006072 A1. Moreover, the peak and trough delivery pattern provided by known dosage forms results in undesirable effects, such as sedation due to over dose of medication when reached at the peak point in the begining, memory impairment and abuse potential.<br>
The dividing of the dose is generally not appropriate for extended release dosage forms that are usually designed to administer as a whole. However, there exists a shortcoming with the alprazolam extended-release dosage form i.e. a wide range of dosage amount is prescribable, depending upon the nature and the severity being treated. Further, certain treatment regimens require different dosage amounts to be administered on different days. Further, extended release products contain a higher drug load and thus any loss of integrity of the release characteristics of the dosage forms has a potential problem as referred in http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazines/vol22no4/oral.htm. The release rate can also be altered by various factors including food and the rate of transit through the gut.<br>
Hence, it would be of great benefit to provide a sustained release alprazolam formulation system that is adaptable to a broad range of dosage strengths, yet exhibits substantial bioequivalence, when different dosage strengths are administered in an equal total dosage amount. One approach to solve this problem would be to provide all dosage strengths in an identical formulation, wherein higher dosage strengths are accommodated in proportionally larger dosage units. However, it is found preferable to provide all dosage strengths in tablets of similar total weight. This facilitates the avoidance of excessively small tablets for the lower dosage strengths, and excessively large tablets for higher dosage strengths.<br>
A good drug delivery system is expected to provide efficient delivery to target tissue, steady therapeutic concentrations and minimizing exposure to nontarget tissue. It is also possible to reduce the do&gt;e or frequency and to improve compliance. The systems can enhance the therapeutic ratio and regimens of many existing agents that would not be useful in conventional dosage forms because of their toxicity or short half-lives. In this manner, a drug treatment is achieved, whose criteria are (a)better efficacy, (b)selectivity and (c)safety.<br>
4<br><br>
Further, there remains a need for an effective dosage form that provides a release of alprazolam over a period of time, which would cause a reduction in side effects associated with alprazolam dosings.<br>
Thus, a sustained-release formulation system for alprazolam is desired that accommodates dosage strengths over atleast a six fold range from 0.5 mg to 3 mg in substantially the same total dosage form weight, yet exhibits bioequivalence over a corresponding range of excipient/drug weight ratios.<br>
An approach to solve this problem would be to identify for a sustained-release dosage form utilizing an HFMC matrix, a suitable amount of mix of HPMC giving substantially equivalent in vivo release and absorption rates over a broad range of alprazolam loadings as referred in patent application US 20040006072. Though mentioned therein, the only exemplified total weight of HPMC is 121.2 mg, having 1:1 ratio only. Surprisingly, in our hand, we found that the in-vitro profile of the composition prepared according to US 2004/0006072 when compared with Xanax XR, the Standard Deviation (SD) as well as % Relative Standard Deviation (%RSD) showed substantially high figures. These substantially high figures relates to the high degree of fluctuations in the said composition comparative to Xanax XR, thus creating a demand for providing a better sustained release composition.<br>
Currently available alprazolam compositions do not provide the desired pharmaceutical effect. Hence, there is a need for providing better sustained release compositions.<br>
The use of lower quantities of (a) K4M HPMC and (b) KI00LVP HPMC gives comparatively better results with respect to drug release. Due to the same, there are less fluctuations in % related standard deviation. Hence, the pharmaceutical composition prepared according to the current invention is superior to the prior are compositions.<br>
The dissolution profile in biological system is reflected from in-vitro dissolution results. It is advisable to have better pharmaceutical composition having less fluctuations, which are inturn dependent on the in-vitro dissolution profile. Thus, the pharmaceutical composition according to the current embodiment is advantageous and better for patients as compared to the prior art compositions.<br>

OBJECT OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The object of the invention is to provide an efficient mode of delivery of Alprazolam.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
According to the present invention, the efficient mode of extended release of Alprazolam is obtained by making use of less quantities of HPMC's. Thus, by making use of the same, Alprazolam formulation is obtained, which has less fluctuations in % related standard deviation as compared to the prior art compositions.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Alprazolam i.e. (8-chloro-l-methyl-6-phenyl-4/f-s-triazolo [4,3-a] [1,4] ) benzodi-azepine, is cited in US 3, 987, 052. It is well known in the prior art that the alprazolam is used in treatment of anxiety disorders and panic attacks. The immediate release formulation of alprazolam however, has certain disadvantages of peak and trough phenomena. The frequency of dosings is also more in case of immediate release tablets.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides a sustained release pharmaceutical composition comprising:<br>
(a)	a therapeutically effective amount of alprazolam,<br>
(b)	a high viscosity hydroxy-propyl-methyl cellulose (HPMC) and low viscosity hydroxy-propyl-methyl cellulose (HPMC) in a ratio of 65:35 to 85:15, and<br>
(c)	pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
The tablet of present invention contains alprazolam, distributed in a matrix that comprises HPMC(s) and other excipients as discussed herein.<br>
Hydroxy propyl methylcellulose, being a semi-synthetic material derived from cellulose, is a linear polymer comprised of etherified anhydrous glucose rings. There are broadly two types of HPMC viz high viscosity polymer and low viscosity polymer. Use of High viscosity polymer retards the rate of release to higher extent, whereas the use of low viscosity polymer retards the rate of release to comparatively lower extent. Furthermore, combination of both types of HPMCs or single type of HPMC is used depending upon the release pattern of interest.<br>
To prevent a tablet from immediately disintegrating a fast rate of hydration followed by quick gelation is necessary for a rate controlling polymer to form a protective gelatinous layer around the<br>
7<br><br>
matrix. The critical parameters of fast polymer hydration and gel layer formation are considered in case of a water-soluble drug and water-soluble excipients.<br>
HPMC is commercially available in various grades, under several trade names, including Methocel® E, F, J and K of dow chemicals, HPM of British Celanese Ltd., U.K., and Metalose ® SH of Shin-Etsu Ltd., Japan. The two polymer grades of METHOCEL most commonly used in controlled-release applications are K(HPMC 2208, USP) and E(HPMC 2910, USP). F-chemistry products (HPMC 2906, USP) are used less commonly. The various grades available under a given trade name typically represent differences in methoxy and hydropropoxy content as well as molecular weight of HPMC. The preferred HPMC, used for the retardation purpose is HPMC 2208, which contains about 19% to about 24% by weight of methoxy substituents, and about 4%to about 12% by weight of hydroxypropoxy substituents, calculated on a dry basis.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, combination of both HPMCs i.e. (a) HPMC having high viscosity and (b) HPMC having low viscosity have been used. The term "high viscosity HPMC" herein refers to HPMC having a viscosity of about 1,500 to about 2,25,000 cP, and the term "low viscosity HPMC" herein refers to HPMC having a viscosity of about 2 to about 400 cP.<br>
The high viscosity grade polymers available are METHOCEL K4M Premium, K15M Premium, and K100M Premium. Preferred high viscosity HPMC is HPMC 2208 having a viscosity of about 3000 to about 5600 cP, which is illustratively available as Methocel® K4MP of Dow. Equivalent products are available from other sources as well.<br>
The low viscosity grade polymers available are K3P LV and K 100P LV. The preferred low viscosity HPMC is HPMC 2208 having a viscosity of about 80 to about 120 cP, which is illustratively available as Methocel® K4MP of Dow. Equivalent products are available from other sources as well.<br>
Our invention makes use of Methocel ® K4MP of Dow as a high viscosity polymer and a Methocel ® KI00LVP of Dow as a low viscosity polymer. US 2004/0006072 discloses the high viscosity HPMC to low viscosity HPMC to be 60:40 to 40:60. In our embodiment, both high viscosity and low visocity HPMC are present in the particular composition ranging from about 65:35 to 85:15. The preferred ratio being 65:35 to 75:25. The most preferred ratio being 70:30. Further, the total amount<br>
8<br><br>
of HPMC used is also less as compared to patent application US 2004/0006072. US 2004/0006072 claims the total polymer weight to be of about 110 to 135 mg. However, we use about 70 to 100 mg. of the polymer thus making our invention cost effective. The preferred range for the weight of the polymer in the tablet is 75 to 90 mg.<br>
It may be noted that the ratio of mix of HPMC, as well as having different total weight of mix of HPMC gives the interesting results, which are better than the immediate release profile, which eliminates the problems associated with peak and trough issue.<br>
The use of lower quantities of (a) K4M HPMC and (lb) K100LVP HPMC gives comparatively better results to the said pharmaceutical composition, such as with respect to drug release. Due to the same, there are less fluctuations in % related standard deviation. Hence, the pharmaceutical composition prepared according to the current invention is superior to the prior art compositions.<br>
The dissolution profile in biological system is reflected from in-vitro dissolution results. It is advisable to have better pharmaceutical composition having less fluctuations, which are in turn dependent on the in-vitro dissolution profile. Thus, the pharmaceutical composition according to the current embodiment is advantageous and better for patients.<br>
The other excipient used in our tablet invention is lactose. Lactose is used as a preferred diluent. Lactose is widely used as a filler or filler-binder in the manufacture of pharmaceutical tablets and capsules. The general properties of lactose which make a contribution to its usage in formulation are (a) cost effectiveness, (b) easy availability, (c) low hygroscopicity, (d) compatibility with the active ingredients, (e) stability, (f) water solubility etc. Lactose monohydrate is used in one of the embodiment. The amount of lactose used in our invention is about 300 mg for 3 mg of alprazolam. Alprazolam is primarily mixed with lactose and then the further processing is done.<br>
Magnesium stearate is an excipient, which is used as a lubricant, to prevent the compacted powder mass from sticking to the equipment during the tabletting or encapsulation process and allow easy ejection of the tablet during tablet formation. However, over lubrication may result into coating of the hydrophobic material on the tablet and thereby retard the release rate. Hence, an appropriate amount of Magnesium Stearate is necessary.<br>
9<br><br>
In another embodiment colloidal silicon dioxide is used. The most commonly used "glidant" in solid oral dosage form formulations is colloidal silicon dioxide; also know by the trade names of Cab-o-Sil or Aerosil. This material is extremely effective in improving the overall flow characteristics of a blend by coating the surfaces of its' components thereby reducing their inter-particulate friction.<br>
The colouring agents optionally can be added at the appropriate stage of preparation of pharmaceutical composition in suitable quantities. It can be along with the lactose. The said colouring agents can be selected from any pharmaceutically acceptable colouring agents. The preferred colouring agents are Lake green blend LB-51426 or D &amp; C Yellow No 10.<br>
The ingredients can be sifted independently or in combination with other ingredients, at the appropriate stage.<br>
According to the present invention, the strength of sustained release tablets of alprazolam is in the range of 0.5 mg to 3.0 mg equivalent to base.<br>
ADVANTAGES:<br>
The advantages of the sustained release composition prepared according to the invention are as under:<br>
i. The composition provides a convenient method of delivery of alprazolam and avoids the frequency of dosages taken by the patient.<br>
ii. The composition provides a mode of release of alprazolam that is adaptable to a broad range of dosage strengths.<br>
iii.	The composition delivers alprazolam in a continuous manner so that the peak and trough<br>
phenomena would be practically inexistent<br>
iv. The composition provides alprazolam in such a dosage that the drug concentration in the blood is maintained for a longer period of time<br>
v. The composition makes use of the high viscosity and low viscosity HPMC in such a weight ratio so as to avoid bioequivalent fluctuations.<br>
10<br><br>
vi. The invention provides a process for the preparation of Alprazolam fomulation which is simple, having less number of steps, involving less man power, having smaller time cycle, providing good yields, with a good purity profile, industrially feasible and economical.<br>
vii. The invention reduces the total quantities of HPMC and making the process cost effective and industrial friendly.<br>
The sustained release tablets according to the instant invention are prepared according to the following process steps comprising of;<br>
a)	Mixing Alprazolam with lactose and optionally the coloring agents in geometric proportion.<br>
b)	Sifting the mixture to obtain the homogeneous blend.<br>

Example 13*: Color was mixed with some part of lactose and sifted through 100#mesh Alprazolam was mixed with lactose in geometric proportion and sifted through 40 mesh. HPMC K-4M and HPMC K-100 LVP are sifted through 40 mesh and mixed with above blend. This homogenous blend was granulated with water to form wet mass. Wet mass was dried and then crushed to form dried granules. Dried granules were lubricated and compressed to tablet with suitable punches.<br>
Three tablets under study were prepared with the above procedure.<br>
* The tablets according to Example 13 are exactly similar to that of Example 4, except the addition of colour, which is optional. The colour is non-functional excipient with respect to the sustained release profile. Thus, for SR purposes, the Example 4 and Example 13 are same.<br>

It may be evident from examples 1-12 that the composition of examples 1-7 and 10-12 exhibit a release pattern, wherein the composition comprising alprazolam is released over a period of about 24<br>
27<br><br>
hours, i.e. between 20-40% in 4 hours to more than 70% in 40 hours of the total dose. Usually the Cmax is reached 3 hours after administration.<br>
In examples 8 &amp; 9, where only high viscosity HPMC or low viscosity HPMC are used, the release pattern varies and is below the desirable standard. Further, from table 25 it is clear that Xanax XR exhibits a large standard deviation in its release profile. Comparatively, the composition of the invention exhibits much less deviation, which shows that the peak-trough effect in case of the composition of the invention is negligible or non-existent.<br>
According to the instant invention, the Alprazolam SR tablets are prepared as per Experiment Number 4. The dissolution experiments of the said tablets was carried out and compared with the tablets prepared as per the compositions known in the prior art.<br>
