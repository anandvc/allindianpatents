"AN INFORMATION RECORDING APPARATUS AND A METHOD THEREOF"<br>
SONY CORPORATION, a Japanese company, of 7-35 Kitashinagawa 6-chome, Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo 141-0001 Japan.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to an information recording apparatus and method, information reproducing apparatus and method, information recording medium, program storage medium and program, and more particularly, relates to an information recording apparatus and method, information reproducing apparatus and method, information recording medium, program storage medium and program which are capable of immediately displaying the titles of information stored in the information recording medium.<br>
Background Art<br>
Various kinds of optical discs have been proposed as a recordable disc medium which is removable from a recording/reproducing apparatus. Such recordable optical discs are proposed as media having large capacity of several gigabytes and are highly expected, as media for recording a AV (Audio Visual) signal such as a video signal.<br>
One or" the encoding methods for performing digital<br><br><br>
compression on a digital video signal is an MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group) 2 scheme. This MPEG2 is applied to record a digital video signal on a recording medium. For example, in- the case of recording an analog video signal on a recording medium, the video signal is encoded by the MPEG2 scheme and then an encoded bit stream is recorded on the recording medium. Further, in recent digital TV broadcasting, a video program is encoded by the MPEG2 scheme and then transmitted in the form of a transport stream. In the case of recording digital broadcasting on the recording medium, a method of recording a transport stream in the form of a digital signal, without performing decoding and re-encoding, is used.<br>
A disc medium is superior m performing random-access processing- In the case of recording a digital video signal on a disc recording medium with this property, even free areas are dispersed on the disc medium, recording can start from one free area and then, can continued by searching the disc medium for free areas.<br>
The number of contents to be recorded increases with an increase in the capacity of an optical disc. Each content is recorded together with its title onto the optical disc. Then, the titles are read and displayed when the optical disc is put into a reproducing apparatus. A user can select a desired title to reproduce the contents of the title.<br>
Conventionally, the titles of contents are recorded in<br><br>
arbitrary different areas on the optical disc. Therefore, such problem arises that it takes time to read and display the titles.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Preferred embodiments of this invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
First, the file structure for recording information on a recording medium will be explained by reference to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the simplified structure of an application format of an information recording medium (a recording medium 10 in Fig. 28 which will be described later). This format has two layers, PlayList and Clip, to manage an AV stream. Volume Information manages all Clips and PlayLists on a disc.<br>
A pair of a single AV stream and its, attached information is considered as one object and referred to as a Clip. An AV stream file is called a Clip AV stream file and its attached information is called a Clip Information file.<br>
One Clip AV stream file stores data created by reforming a MPEG2 transport stream according to a structure regulated by the<br><br>
DVR (Digital Video Recording) application format.<br>
Data files used in a computer or the like are generally treated as a byte train and on the other hand, the contents in Clip AV stream file are treated on a temporal axis and PlayList designates access points in Clip with, mainly, time stamps. When PlayList gives a time stamp for an access  point in Clip, Clip Information file is used for searching for address information {data byte position) at which the stream of the Clip AV stream file should start to be decoded.<br>
PlayList is created so that the user can select zones desired for reproduction from Clip and can edit them with ease. One PlayList is composed of zones for reproduction from Clip. One zone for reproduction from Clip is called Playltem and is designated by a pair of IN point and OUT point on the temporal axis. Therefore^ PlayList is composed of Playltems.<br>
PlayList has two types: one is Real PlayList and the other is Virtual PlayList.<br>
Real PlayList shares the stream of Clip which is referenced by this Real PlayList.  In the other word, Real PlayList occupies the disc by.the amount of data equivalent to the stream of Clip which is referenced by this Real PlayList. When an AV stream is recorded as new Clip, Real'PlayList for referencing this Clip within zones in which reproduction can be.performed is automatically created.  If a part of a zone for reproduction is deleted from Real PlayList, the data of the corresponding stream<br><br>
is also deleted from Clip.<br>
Virtual PlayList does not share data of Clip. Even if Virtual PlayList is changed or deleted, Clip does not change at all.<br>
Hereinafter, Heal PlayList and Virtual PlayList are simply called PlayList altogether in the following explanation.<br>
Necessary directories on a DVR disc are as follows: root directory having "DVR" directory which has "PLAYLIST" directory, "CLIPINF" directory, "STREAM" directory and "DATA" directory.<br>
Ihe root directory may have subordinate directories other than above, but they are not considered in the DVR application ¦format.<br>
Fig. 2 shows an example of the directory structure on the DVR disc. As shown in this figure, root directory has one directory.<br>
"DVR" ... All files and directories regulated by DVR application format should be subordinate to this directory.<br>
"DVR" directory has directories which will be explained below.<br>
"PLAYLIST" ... Database files of Real PlayList and Virtual PlayList should be subordinate to this directory.  This directory should exist even there is no PlayList.<br>
"CLIPINF" ... Clip databases should be subordinate to this directory. This directory should exist' even there is no Clip.<br>
"STREAM" ... AV stream files should be subordinate to this<br><br>
directory. This directory should exist even there is no  AV stream file.<br>
"PLAYLIST" directory stores two kinds of PlayList files. One is for Real PlayList and the other is for Virtual PlayList. "xxxxx.rpls" ... This file is to store information on one Real PlayList. One file is created fot each Real PlayList. The file name is "xxxxx.rpls". "xxxxx" is composed of five numerals, from 0 to 9.  The extension of this file should be "rpls".<br>
"yyyyy.vpls" ... This file is to store information on one Virtual PJayldst, One file, is  created for each Virtual  PlayList. The file name is "yyyyy.vpls".  "yyyyy" is composed of five numerals, from 0 to 9. The extension of this file should be "vpls".<br>
"CLIPINF" directory has files eac;h corresponding to one AV stream file.<br>
"zzzzz.clpi" ... This file is a Clip Information file corresponding to one AV stream file (Clip AV steam file or Bridge-Clip AV stream file).  The file name is "zzzzz.clpi" and "zzzzz" is composed of five numerals, from 0 to 9.  The extension of this file should be "dpi".<br>
"STREAM" directory stores the files of AV streams. "zzzzz.m2ts" ... This file is an AV stream file -which is treated by the DVR system. This is a Clip AV stream file or Bridge-Clip AV stream file. The file n^rae is "zzzzz.m2ts" and "zzzzz" is composed.of five numerals, from 0 to 9. The extension<br><br>
of this file should be "m2ts".<br>
One AV  stream file and  its corresponding Clip Information file should have the same five numerals "zzzzz",<br>
Since other directories and file names are not necessary to carry out the embodiment of this invention, explanations of them are omitted.<br>
Next, a file management system to which this invention is applied will be explained. As shown in Fig. 3, this invention uses six Jcinds .of management information tables of File System Descriptor, MIA Map for File System, File Table, Pise Region Table, Allocation Rule Set Table, and File Name Table, in order to manage files.<br>
File System Descriptor (FSD) out of them is stored between prefixed addresses (Al and A2, in the case of Fig. 4) on an optical disc as shown in Fig. 4.<br>
The management information tables other than File System Descriptor are stored in a MIA (Management Information Area) on logical volume as shown in Fig. 5.  In this example of Fig. 5, MIA is formed between addresses All and A12 on the optical disc, but these addresses are changed when necessary.<br>
The MIA area is formed in two different areas in the logical volume for offering reliance property. One is Main MIA and the other is Reserve MIA.<br>
The locations of the management tables in MIA are indicated by MIA Map and the locations of MIA and MIA Map are indicated by<br><br>
File System Descriptor.<br>
File System Descriptor has a structure shown in Fig. 6. Signature (BPO) is shown in detail in Fig. 9 which will be explained later. The value of Data Type field of Signature should be 16.<br>
Creation Time (BP8) indicates the creation time of File System Descriptor.<br>
Modification Time (BP12) indicates the update time of File System Descriptor.<br>
Interchange Class (BP16) provides limitations for compatibility of media.<br>
Reserved (BP17) is reserved for future use.  #00 should be set in this field.<br>
Start Address of Main MIA (BP2Q) indicates the initial logical block number of Main MIA.<br>
Start Address of Reserve MIA (BP24) indicates the initial logical block number of Reserve .MIA.<br>
Length of MIA (BP28) specifies the volume of MIA on a logical block unit basis. There is no Logical blocks exceeding #FFEF in MIA.<br>
Number of MIA Map Sectors (BP30) specifies the number of blocks for MIA Map to be stored in MIA.<br>

Next, the system of recording and reproducing data having the DVR application structure will be explained with reference to.the block diagram of a motion picture recording/reproducing apparatus 1 in Fig. 28.<br>
For example, information recorded on a recording medium 10 which is an optical disc is read by a reading section 11 of a reproducer 61. A demodulator 12 demodulates the data, which has been read by the reading section 11 from the recording medium 10, and then gives the resultant to an ECC decoder 13. The ECC decoder 13 separates the data given from the demodulator 12 into an AV stream and a database to give the AV stream to a source depacketizer .14 and to output the database to a control unit 17.<br>
The source depacketizer 14 depackets the inputted AV stream and outputs the resultant to a demultiplexer 15. The demultiplexer 15 separates the data given from the source depacketizer 15 into video (V), audio (A) and system (S) data, and outputs them to an AV decoder 16 and a multiplexer 25.<br>
The AV decoder 16 decodes the inputted video data and audio data based on . the system data and outputs a video signal and an audio signal from terminals 18 and 19, respectively.<br>
An AV encoder 23 of a recorder 62  receives a video signal and audio signal inputted from terminals 21 and 22, respectively. The video signal is also inputted to a video analyzer 24.  The AV<br><br>
encoder 23 and video analyzer 24 receives the video signal which is outputted from the AV decoder 16, if necessary, instead of the video signal which is inputted from the terminal 21.<br>
The AV encoder 23 encodes the inputted video signal and audio signal and outputs the encoded video signal (V), audio signal (A), and the system data (S) corresponding to this encoding to the multiplexer 25.<br>
The video analyzer 24 analyzes the inputted video signal and outputs the analysis result to the control unit 17.<br>
A transport stream is inputted r&gt;om a digital interface or digital television tuner to a terminal 33 and then, is inputted to the demultiplexer 15 via a switch 27, or to a multiplexed stream analyzer 26 and a source packetizer 29 via the  switch 27 and a switch 28. The multiplexed steam analyzer 26  and  the source packetizer 29 can receive signals outputted from the multiplexer 25 via the switch 28, instead of the' signal from the switch .27.<br>
The multiplexed stream analyzer 26 analyzes the inputted signal and outputs the analysis result to the control unit 17. The source packetizer 29 packetizes the inputted signal and gives the resultant to an ECC encoder 30.  The ECC encoder 30 also receives databases which are outputted from the control unit 17.<br>
The ECC encoder 30 adds an  error correction code to an input, and encodes  and then outputs the resultant to a modulator<br><br>
31. The modulator 31 modulates the data inputted from the ECC encoder 30 and outputs the resultant to a recording section 32. The recording section 32 executes recording processing of data inputted from the modulator 31 on the recording medium 10.<br>
The control unit 17 has a storage unit 17A for storing various data, and controls each section.<br>
A drive 41 may be connected to the control unit 17 to drive an magnetic disk 51, optical disc 52, magneto-optical disc 53 and a semiconductor memory 54.<br>
Note that, the optical disc 52 can be used as the recording medium 10.<br>
First, the basic operation or me motion picture recording/reproducing apparatus 1 to encode and record inputted audio/video signals will be explained.<br>
The video signal and audio signal are inputted from the terminals 21 and 22 of the recorder 62, respectively.- The video signal is inputted to the video analyzer 24 and AV encoder 23. The audio signal is also inputted to the AV encoder 23.  The AV encoder 23 encodes the inputted video signal and audio signal and outputs the encoded video stream (V), encoded audio stream (A) and system information (S) to the multiplexer 25.<br>
The encoded video stream (V) is, for example, an MPEG2 video stream and the encoded audio stream (A) is, for example, an MPEG1 audio stream or Dolby AC3 (trademark) audio stream. The system information (S) is information for encoding video/audio<br><br>
(byte size of encoded picture and audio frame and picture encoding type and the like) and time information for AV synchronization.<br>
The multiplexer 25 multiplexes the inputted stream based on the inputted system information and outputs the multiplexed stream.  The multiplexed stream is, for example, an MPEG2 transport stream or MPEG2 program stream.  The multiplexed stream is inputted to the multiplexed stream analyzer 26 and the source pacJcetizer 29.  The source packetizer 29  encodes  the inputted multiplexed stream in accordance with the application format of the recording medium 10 to generate an AV stream composed of source packets.  The AV stream is subjected to addition of an error correction code at the ECC (error correction) encoder 30, and modulation at modulator 31, and then the resultant is inputted to the recording section 32.  The recording section 32 records the AV stream file on the recording medium 10 based on a control signal which is given from the control unit 17.<br>
Next, the basic operation will be explained for recording a transport stream of digital TV broadcasting inputted from a digital interface or digital TV tuner not shown, for example.<br>
A transport stream is inputted from the terminal 33.  There ' are two methods for recording an inputted transport stream: one is for transparent recording and the other is for reencoding in order to decrease a recording bit rate and then recording. Command information for a recording method is inputted to the<br><br>
control unit 17 from a terminal 20 serving as a user interface, so that the control unit 17 controls the recording method.<br>
In the case of the transparent recording of an inputted transport stream, the transport stream is input to the multiplexed stream analyzer 26 and the source packetizer 29. The processing thereafter till the AV stream is recorded on the recording medium 10 is the same as that of encoding and recording the inputted audio signal and video signal as described above.<br>
In the case of reencoding and recording the inputted transport stream, the inputted transport stream is inputted to the demultiplexer 15.  The demultiplexer 15 inputs the video stream (V) to the AV decoder 16. The AV decoder 16 decodes the video stream and inputs the reproduction video signal to the AV encoder 23. The AV encoder 23 encodes the inputted video and inputs the encoded video stream (V) to the multiplexer 25.<br>
On the other hand, the audio stream (A) and system information (S) outputted from the demultiplexer 15 are directly inputted to the multiplexer 25.  The multiplexer 25 multiplexes the inputted audio stream based on the inputted.system information and outputs the multiplexed stream.  The processing thereafter till the AV stream is recorded on the recording medium 10-is the same as that of encoding and recording the inputted audio/video signals as described above.<br>
This motion picture recording/reproducing apparatus 1<br><br>
records the AV stream file and also records the application database information relating to the file.  The application database information is created by the control unit 17.  Input information to the control unit 17 includes feature information of a motion picture from the video analyzer 24, feature information of an AV stream from the multiplexed stream analyzer 26,   and user-command information inputted from the terminal 20 serving as a user interface.<br>
The feature information of the motion  picture from the video analyzer 24 is generated by the motion picture recording/reproducing apparatus 1 when the motion picture recording/reproducing apparatus 1 itself encodes the video signal.  The video analyzer 24 analyzes the contents of the inputted video signal and generates information relating to the. pictures of feature mark points in the inputted motion picture signal.  This information is command information for the pictures of feature mark points such as a program start point, scene change point and CM start/end points, in the inputted video signal.  In addition, this information includes the thumbnail of the picture and the title of the contents.  This command information for the picture is inputted to the multiplexer 25 via the control unit 17.<br>
The multiplexer 25, when multiplexing the encoded pictures of the images of the mark points instructed by the control unit 17, returns the address information of the encoded pictures on<br><br>
the AV stream to the control unit 17. The control unit 17 relates the kind of feature image to the address information of the encoded picture on the AV stream and stores them in the storage unit 17A.<br>
The feature information of AV stream from the multiplexed stream analyzer 26 is information relating to the encoded information of the AV stream to be recorded, and is generated by the motion picture recording/reproducing apparatus 1. For example, this information includes time stamps and address information of I-picture of the AV stream, discontinuous information of STC (system time clock), change information in program contents, and arrival time and address information.<br>
The  time stamps and address information of I-picture of the AV stream are data to be stored in EP_map. The discontinuous information of STC in the AV stream is data to be stored in Sequencelnfo. The change information of program contents in the AV stream is data to be stored in Programlnfo. And the arrival time and address information in the AV stream are stored in TU_map.<br>
On the other hand, when the transport stream inputted from the terminal 33 is to be transparent-recorded, the multiplexed stream analyzer 26 detects the pictures of feature mark points in the AV stream and creates their kinds and address information. These information are data to be stored in ClipMark.<br>
The feature information of AV stream from the multiplexed<br><br>
stream analyzer 26 is to be stored in a database (Clip Information) of AV stream.<br>
The user-command information from the terminal 20" includes designating information relating to a desired reproduction zone in the AV stream, the character letters which explain the contents of pictures within the reproduction zone, and time stamps in the AV stream for book marks and resume points which are set by a user for favorite scenes. These user command information are to be stored in a database of "PlayList.<br>
The control unit 17 creates the database (Clip Information) of AV stream, database of PlayList,"management information (info.dvr) for the contents recorded on the recording medium 10, and thumbnail information. These database information are processed by the ECC (error correction) encoder 30 and the modulator 31, in the same way as the AV stream, and then are inputted to the recording section 32. The recording section 32 records this database information on the recording medium 10 as application database information based on the control signal given from the control unit 17.<br>
Next, the basic operation for reproduction will be explained.<br>
The AV stream file and application, database information have been recorded on the recording medium 10.<br>
First, the control unit 17 instructs the reading section 11 of the reproducer 61 to read the application database<br><br>
information. Then, the reading section 11 reads the application database information from the recording medium 10 and the application database information is processed through the demodulator 12 and the ECC (error correction) decoder 13 and is inputted to the control unit 17.<br>
The control unit 17 outputs a list of PlayLists recorded on the recording medium 10 based on  the application database to the terminal 20 serving as a user interface.  The user selects a desired PlayList out of the list of PlayLists and then, the desired PlayList for reproduction is input to the control unit 17.  The control unit 17 instructs the reading section 11 to read the AV stream file necessary for the reproduction of the PlayList.  The reading section 11 reads the AV stream from the recording medium 10 and the AV stream is processed through the demodulator 12, the ECC decoder 13 and the file 'system section and is inputted to the source depacketizer 14.<br>
The source depacketizer 14 converts the AV stream having the application format of the recording medium into a stream which can be inputted to the demultiplexer 15.  The demultiplexer 15 inputs video stream (V) , audio stream (A) and system information (S) which compose the AV stream within the reproduction zone (Playltem) designated by the control unit 17, to the AV decoder 16.  The AV decoder 16 decodes the video stream and audio stream and outputs the reproduction video signal and the reproduction audio signal from the terminals 18 and 19,<br><br>
respectively.<br>
In the case of reproducing the PlayList of EP__map type selected by the user, from some time in the middle of the PlayList, the control unit 17 instructs the reading section 11 to read data from an I-picture address with PTS which is the closest to the designated time.<br>
On the other hand, in the case of reproducing the PlayList of TU_map type selected by the user, from some time in the middle of the PlayList, the control unit 17 instructs the reading section  11   to  start  reading data  at the address  of the source packet of the arrival time which is the closest to the designated time.<br>
Furthermore, when the user selects a mark out of a start point and a scene change point of a program stored in ClipMark of Clip- Information (for example, this selection operation is performed by displaying a list of thumbnail pictures of the start point and scene change points of the program stored in . ClipMark on the user interface and selecting a picture out of them by the user}, the control unit 17 determines the readout point of the AV stream on the recording medium 10,based on the contents of Clip Information, and then instructs the reading section 11 to read the AV stream.<br>
That is, the control unit 17 instructs the reading section 11 to read data from an I-picture with an address closest to the address of the picture of the AV stream selected by the user.<br><br>
The reading section 11 starts reading the data at the designated address,, and the read data is processed through the demodulator 12, ECC decoder 13 and the file system section, is inputted to the demultiplexer 15 and is decoded at the AV decoder 16, and as a result, the AV data shown by the address of the picture having the mark point is reproduced.<br>
Next, the processing for recording a video stream, mainly the database recording processing, will be explained with reference to the flowchart of Fig. 29.<br>
First, at step Sll, the control unit 17 makes the AV encoder 23 encode the inputted video stream and allows the resultant to be recorded on the recording medium 10, as described above. At step S12, the control unit 17 judges whether the recording of the video stream has been finished.  When it has not been finished, then the control unit 17 returns to step Sll to continue the encoding and recording processing of the video stream.<br>
When it is judged at step S12 that the encoding and recording processing of the video stream has been finished, then the control unit 17-moves to step S13 to execute the database recording processing.<br>
In this connection, this database recording processing is executed as one kind'of processing of step S23 which is the file recording processing of Fig. 30.<br>
Specifically, in this system, the control unit 17 executes<br><br>
the processing shown in Fig. 30 to record a file. At step S21, the control unit 17 detects the Allocation class (Fig. 19) of the file to be recorded, and judges at step S22 whether the Allocation class of the file indicates Gathered files. When the Allocation class of the file to be recorded indicates Gathered files, then the control unit 17 moves to step S23 to execute processing to record the file in the Gathered File area (Fig. 4) When it is judged at step S22 that the Allocation class of the file to be recorded does not indicate Gathered files (when it is judged  that  it is Data  files or Real-time  files),   on .the contrary, the control unit 17 moves to step S24 to execute processing of recording in an area (normal area) other than Gathered File area.<br>
Although the control unit 17 decides the recording area on the recording medium 10 in accordance with the Allocation class of a file to be recorded as described above, the Allocation classes of the files composing databases to be recorded at step S13 of Fig. 29 are Gathered files, so that the database recording processing at step S13 is executed as recording processing in Gathered File area of step S23 of Fig. 30.<br>
Next/ the database recording processing of step S13 of Fig. 29 will be explained in detail with reference to the flowchart of Fig. 31.<br>
First, at step S41, the control unit 17 searches Space Bit Map for free areas.  This Space  Bit Map is created by executing<br><br>
processing shown by the flowchart of Fig. 32.<br>
That is, the control 17 executes the processing of Fig. 32 when the recording medium 10 (optical disc) is inserted.<br>
At step S61, the control unit 17 reads location information of files stored in Gathered File area of the inserted disc, from Disc Region Table (Fig. 20 and Fig. 21) of this disc. Then, at step S62, the-control unit 17 executes the processing to create Space Bit Map based on  the readout results of step S61.<br>
When File-1 to File-4 has been recorded in Gathered File area as shown in Fig. 33, for example, information about what the recording area for a file has been occupied is recorded in each area (bit) of preset fixed size.<br>
Referring to Fig. 33, shadowed areas indicate the occupied areas while non-shadowed areas indicate the free areas.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to detect continuous free areas in Gathered File area based on this Space Bit Map.<br>
When free areas are detected in Space Bit Map at the processing of step S41 of Fig. 31, then the control unit 17 judges at step S42 whether a continuous free area capable of recording a file to be recorded therein exists in Gathered File area.<br>
When there is no continuous free areas capable of recording the file therein, then the control unit 17 moves to step S48 to calculate the total capacity of the free areas. Then, at step S49, the controlunit 17 judges whether the total capacity of<br><br>
the free areas obtained by the calculation at step S48 is larger than the volume of the file to be recorded. When the total capacity of the free areas is larger than the volume of the file, the control unit 17 moves to step S50 to execute the processing of changing the locations of the files in Gathered File area.. For example, as shown in Fig. 34, in the case'where four files, File-1 to File-4, have been already recorded in Gathered File area and there is no continuous free areas capable of .. recording a new File-A therein, the areas recording File-1 to Fiie-4 are changed so that these files are continuously recorded. Thereby, "a continuos free area capable of recording the File-A therein are formed.<br>
After the processing of changing the locations of existing files at step S50 or when it is judged at step S42 that there are a continuous free area capable of recording the file therein, the control unit 17 moves to step S43 to execute the processing of recording the file.  In the example of Fig. 34, this processing allows the File-A to be recorded in Gathered File area.<br>
-Because the new file has been recorded in this way, MIA information needs to be changed.  The control unit 17 creates Disc Region Table (Fig. 20 and Fig. 21) for indicating area information after the new file is recorded, at step S44. At step S45, the control unit 17 creates File Name Table (Fig. 25, Fig. 26 and Fig. 27) for indicating the names of the files recorded.<br><br>
In addition, at step S46, the control unit 17 creates File Table (Fig. 11 and Fig. 12) for indicating the file management attribute information. These information are information which are properly stored in the storage unit 17A.<br>
Then at step S47, the control unit 17 records the tables created with the processing of step S44 to step S46 in the MIA area (Fig. 5 and Fig. 7).<br>
When it is judged at step S49 that the total capacity of the free areas is smaller than the volume of the file to be recorded, the control unit 17 executes the error processing at step S51 because the file can not be recorded in Gathered File area. Specifically, the control unit 17 executes such processing to output a message informing that the file can not be recorded due to a lack of capacity, as a video output, and display it on a monitor.<br>
Next, the title display processing will be explained with reference to the flowchart of Fig. 35.  This processing is executed by the control unit 17 when the recording medium 10 is inserted into the motion picture recording/reproducing apparatus 1.<br>
First, the readout processing of PLAYLIST and CLIPINF is executed at step S71.  Fig. 36 and Fig. 37 explains this processing in detail.<br>
First, the readout processing of PLAYLIST will be explained with reference to Fig. 36.<br><br>
At step S91, the control unit 17 reads File Table (Fig. 11, Fig. 12, Fig. 16) recorded on the recording medium 10 to search the File Name field (Fig. 12) of File Table for the name of PLAYLIST. Then, at step S92, the control unit 17 searches for File Record with the extension of .rpls or .vpls which is specified by Child Link (Fig. 16) of PLAYLIST detected with the processing of step S91.<br>
Next, the control unit 17 moves to step S93 to judge ¦ whether Next Link {Fig. 12) exists. When it exists, the control unit 17 moves to step S94 to search for File Record with the extension of .rpls or .vpls specified by  Next Link. Then  the control unit 17 returns to step S93 to repeatedly execute this processing.<br>
Then, when it is judged at step S93 that Next Link does not exist, the processing is completed.<br>
In this way, files with *.rpls or *.vpls are all read from PLAYLIST.<br>
Next, with reference to Fig. 37, the readout processing of CLIPINF will be explained. At step S101, the control unit 17 searches File Name field {Fig. 12) of File Table (Fig. 11, Fig. 12, Fig. 16) for the name of CLIPINF.<br>
At step. S102, the control unit- 17 searches for File Record with the extension of .clpi which is specified hy  Child Link of CLIPINF detected with the processing of step S101.<br>
Next, the control unit 17 judges at step S103 whether Next<br><br>
Link exists, and when it exists, then it moves to step S104 to search for File Record with the extension of .clpi which is specified by Next Link. Then, the control unit 17 returns to step S103 to repeatedly execute this processing.<br>
When it is judged at step S103 that Next Link does not exist, the processing is completed.<br>
In this way, files with *.clpi of CLIPINF are all read.<br>
When the processing of step S71 of Fig. 35 is completed as described above, the control unit 17 moves  to  step S72 to sort the head addresses of the files read out with the processing of step S71, in an increasing order.<br>
For example, in the case where the head addresses of File 1, File 2 and File 3 are A23, A21 an A25, respectively, as shown in Fig. 38,   and  if A21 
Next, at step S73, the control unit 17 accesses the files in Gathered File area in the sorted order to read out the titles and addresses of corresponding contents recorded therein.  The titles are read out from the files of pLAYLIST and the addresses are read out from the files of CLIPINF.<br>
Next, at step S74, the control unit 17 generates video data corresponding to the titles read out by the processing of step S73, and outputs it to the AV decoder 16 to make it outputted from the terminal 18. Thereby,. the titles of the contents.<br><br>
recorded on the recording medium 10 are displayed. As a result, the user can select and designate a title which he wants to reproduce.<br>
As described above, the files are read out in the order of File 2, File 1, File 3 which is the order of addresses as shown in Fig. 40, even the order of the detected files recorded in Gathered File area is File 1, File 2, File 3.  Therefore, time for a seek  operation from readout of one file till readout of a next file can  be shortened as   compared  with the case of reading out the files in the order of File 1, File 2, File 3. As a result, a time for reading out all files can be shortened.<br>
In addition, in this system, files of information including titles are collectively recorded in a prescribed area, Gathered File area, on the recording medium 10.  Therefore, files can be speedily read out as compared with the case where File 1 to File 3 are recorded in different areas on the recording medium .10 as shown in Fig. .41.<br>
As described above, a file storing the titles of contents and a file storing the addresses which indicate the recording positions of the contents are recorded as File 1 to File 3 in Gathered File area, (area between address A3 and address A4, in this case) as shown in Fig, 4.<br>
Next, another embodiment of this invention will be explained with reference to the attached drawings.<br>
Fig. 42 shows  an  example of a directory structure on the<br><br>
DVR disc which is different from an example of Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 42, a root directory always includes one DVR directory, and may optionally include at least one DVRn' (n is an integral number more than zero) directory. The DVR directory is called Basic DVR directory and the DVRn directories are called AUX DVR directories. Files and directories of Fig. 42 which have the same names as those shown in Fig. 2 have the same meanings as them.<br>
Three files of menu.tidx, menu.tcatl and menu.tdt2 in Fig.<br>
42  are files for managing thumbnail pictures each of which is<br>
¦i<br>
created from the main picture of each E'layList. menu.tidx is a file for storing header information of the thumbnail pictures. menu.tdtl and menu.tdt2 are files for storing picture information of the thumbnail pictures. Three files of mark.tidx, mark.tdtl and mark.tdt2 are files for managing thumbnail pictures which are created f-rom pictures of mark points selected by the user from each PlayList and of feature points extracted from the AV stream, mark.tidx is a file for storing header information of the thumbnail pictures, mark.tdtl and mark.tdt2 are files for storing picture information of the thumbnail pictures.<br>
Similar to the explanations for Fig. 12, Fig. 18 and Fig. 19, the file system used in the information processing apparatus of this embodiment provides "Allocation class" as attribute information relating to the location (Allocation) on the<br><br>
recording medium of a file. Allocation class is information which is given for each file, and this information is stored in management data of file (MIA (Management Information Area)) (refer to the explanation of Fig. 18).<br>
Fig. 43 shows the relationship between DVR application file and its Allocation Class. Six kinds of groups: Group-1 files, Group-2 files, Group-3 files, Group-4 files, Real-time files, Data files, are provided as an' example of the DVR application. That is, in  this example, four groups of Group-1 to Group-4 are used as Allocation Class, instead of Gathered files in the example of Fig. 19.<br>
Further, similar to the aforementioned explanations of Fig". 12 and Fig. 18, the file system used in the information processing apparatus of this embodiment provides Robust bit in "Attribute" field as attribute information relating to the location (Allocation) of a file on the recording medium-. The Attribute field is information given to each file and this information is stored in the management data of file (MIA) (refer to Fig. 12}". As to such file that Robust bit in "Attribute" field is 1, the same file data is recorded at two different positions on the recording medium to secure the reliable property.  One data is called Main File Data and the other data is called Reserve File Data. Files with Robust bit of 1 in "Attribute" field shown in Fig. 43 are  recorded in   this  way. Fig. 44  is  a diagram which explains a recording method of a<br><br>
file with Robust bit of 1 in Attribute field,  zzzzz.clpi file has the Robust bit of 1 and also the file data is arranged (recorded) in two areas as Main File Data and Reserve File Data. The Reserve File Data has the same information as Main File.Data. In the case of recording- a file, recording is performed in the order of Main data and then Reserve data. And in the case of reproducing the file, Main data is firstly read. If Main File Data can not be read due to a data error, Reserve File Data is read.<br>
As to such file that Robust bit in "Attribute" field is 0, its data is recorded at one position on the recording medium. menu.tdtl file shown in Fig. 44 has Robust bit of 0 in Attribute field, and its file data is recorded in one area.<br>
In the file system used in the information processing apparatus of this embodiment, the file data of files of which Allocation Class are Group-1 files, Group-2 .files, Group-3 files or Group-4 files are collectively recorded in a prescribed area called LB (Logical Block) Region for Gathered files (Gathered files area) as shown in Fig. 45. The locations (start address and end address) of LB Region for files and LB Region for Gathered files on the recording medium shown in Fig. 45 are recorded in Parameters of Allocation Rule Set Record (Fig. 23). In addition, as shown in Fig. 46, the following six areas are specified in LB Region for Gathered files.<br>
(1) Main -LB Regions for Gourp-1 files (area for storing<br><br>
Main File Data of a file of which AC (Allocation Class) is Group-1 files, and this area is shown by gl-M in this figure) (2) Reserve LB Region for Group-1 files (area for storing Reserve File Data of a file of which AC is Group-1 files, and this area is shown by gl-R in this figure)  (3) Main LB Regions for Group-2 files (area for storing Main File Data of a file of which AC is Group-2 files, and this area is shown by g2-M in this figure)  (4) Reserve LB Region for Group-2 files (area for storing Reserve File Data of a file of which AC is Group-2 files, and this area is shown by g2-R in this figure)  (5) LB Regions for Gourp-3 files (area for storing File Data of a file of which AC is Group-3 files, and this area is shown by  g3 in this figure)  (6) LB Region for Group-4 files (area for storing File Data of a file of which AC is Group-4 files, and this area is shown by g4 in this figure)<br>
The locations (start address and end address) of these six areas on the recording medium are also recorded in Parameters of Allocation Rule Set Record (Fig. 23).<br>
For example, each capacity of gl-M, gl-R, g2-M and g2-R is 2Mbytes, the capacity of g3 is 3.2Mbytes and the capacity of g4 is 16Mbytes.  In this connection, M is 1024X1024.<br>
Grouping of files among Group-1, Group-2, Group-3 and Group-4 is considered so that the files can be arranged in the above capacity. Further, on the contrary, the maximum size of-files of each group is limited so that the files can be arranged<br><br>
in the above capacity.<br>
For example, in the case of newly recording Main File Data of a file of which AC (Allocation Class)   is Group-1 files, its File data is recorded in a free area of Main LB Regions for Group-1 files.<br>
Fig. 47 shows an example of file data arranged in Main LB Region for Group-1 files. The location information of file data in Main LB Regions_ for Group-1 files is stored in management data of the aforementioned Disc Region Table (Fig. 20 and Fig. 21) .  The same  processing is applied for the aforementioned (2) to (6) areas.<br>
The (1) to (6) areas can be moved within LB Region for Gathered files.  In addition, LB Region for Gathered files can be moved on the recording medium.  For example, if errors increases in LB Region for Gathered files, new LB Region for Gathered files is created and its location on the recording medium is recorded in Parameters of Allocation Rule Set Record in MIA.<br>
Fig. 4 8 shows an example of arranging LB Region for Gathered files at a position {almost in the center, in this figure) away from the inner circumference of the disc.  In this case, LB Region for files is divided into two.<br>
Fig. 49 shows the syntax of information indicating the locations of LB Region for Gathered files and above (1) to (6) areas on the recording area, which is stored in Parameters of Allocation Rule Set Record (Fig. 23).  This information is called<br><br>
Allocation Info of DVR files.<br>
LB Region for Gathered files (RBPO) indicates the start position and end position of LB Region for Gathered files on the recording medium with Start Logical Block Number and End Logical Block Number shown in Fig. 50.<br>
Main LB Regions for Group-1 files (RBP16) indicates the start position and end position of Main LB Regions for Group-1 files on the recording medium with the syntax shown in Fig. 50. Reserve LB Regions for Group-1 files (RBP24) indicates the start position and end position of Reserve LB Regions for Group-1 files on the recording medium with the syntax shown in Fig. 50.<br>
Main LB Regions for Group-2 files (RBP32) indicates the start position and end position of Main LB Regions for Group-2 files on the recording medium with the syntax shown in Fig. 50. Reserve LB Regions for Group-2 files (RBP40) indicates the start position and  end position of Reserve LB Regions for Group-2 files on the recording medium with the syntax shown in Fig. 50.<br>
LB Regions for Group-3 files (RBP48) indicates the start position and end position of LB Regions for Group-3 files on the recording medium with the syntax shown in Fig. 50.<br>
LB Regions for Grou-4 files (RBP56) indicates the start position and end position of LB Region for Group-4 files on the recording medium with the syntax shown in Fig. 50.<br>
Main LB Regions for Group^l files, Reserve LB Regions for Group-1 files, Main LB Regions for Group-2"files, Reserve LB<br><br>
Regions for Group2 files, LB Regions for Group-3 files and LB Regions for Group-4 files are included in LB Regions for Gathered files.<br>
Next, the system for recording/reproducing data having such DVR application structure will be explained with reference to the block diagram of the motion picture recording/reproducing apparatus of Fig. 51. The motion picture recording/reproducing apparatus 1 of Fig. 51 has basically the same structure as the motion picture recording/reproducing apparatus 1 of Fig.. 28.  In the motion picture recording/reproducing apparatus 1 of Fig. 51, however, the outputs of the ECC decoder 13 is inputted to the source depacketizer 14 or control unit 17.via the buffer 71.  In addition, the outputs of the control unit 17 and the source packetizer 29 are supplied to the ECC encoder 30  via the buffer 72.<br>
Note that, the video analyzer 24, multiplexed stream analyzer 26, switches 27 and 28 in Fig. 28 are omitted in this figure.<br>
First, as to a recording operation, the case of encoding and recording the inputted audio video signal will be explained.<br>
Before recording, the control unit 17 firstly instructs the reading section 11 to read data of File System Descriptor (FSD) (Fig. 6).  The reading section 11 reads data of FSD (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5) recorded at a predetermined location on the recording medium 10, and the data is processed through the demodulator 12<br><br>
and ECC decoder 13 and inputted to the control unit 17 via the buffer 71. The control unit 17 obtains the address of MIA based on the FSD data.<br>
Then, the-control unit 17 instructs the reading section 11 to read MIA. The reading section 11 reads the data of MIA, and the data is processed through the demodulator 12 and ECC decoder 13 and inputted to the control unit 17 via the buffer 71. The control unit 17 obtains the data of Allocation Info of DVR files (Fig. 49)   in MIA. And it obtains information about free areas on the recording medium by analyzing the data of Disc Region Table (Fig. 10, Fig. 20 and Fig. 21).<br>
The video signal and audio signal are inputted from the terminals 21 and 22, respectively. The video signal and audio signal are inputted to the AV encoder 23.  The AV encoder 23 encodes the inputted video signal and audio signal to output the encoded video stream (V), encoded audio stream (A) to the multiplexer 25. The encoded video stream (V) is, for example, an MPEG2 video stream, and the encoded audio stream (A) is, for example, an MPEGl audio stream or Dolby AC3 (trademark) audio steam.  The multiplexer 25 multiplexes the inputted streams to output a multiplexed stream.<br>
The multiplexed stream'is, for example, an MFEG2 transport stream or MPEG2 program stream.  The multiplexed stream is inputted to the source packetizer 29. The source packetizer 29 encodes the inputted multiplexed stream in .accordance with'the<br><br>
application format of the recording medium to generate an AV stream composed of source packets. The AV stream is processed through the ECC encoder 30, modulator 31 via the buffer 72 and is inputted to the recording section 32. The recording section 32 records a Clip AV stream file on the recording medium 10 based on the control signal given from the control unit 17. The control unit 17 controls this recording so  as  to record the Clip AV stream in a free area other than LB Regions for Gathered files in LB Regions for files (Fig. 46).<br>
As well as recording the Clip AV stream file, this motion picture recording/reproducing apparatus 1 records application database information relating to this file, that is, Clip Information file, PlayList file, information of thumbnail pictures, and management information (info.dvr) of the contents recorded on the recording medium 10. These application database information are .created by the control unit 17.  The Clip Information file and information of thumbnail pictures of marks (feature points) are created by  analyzing the Clip AV stream file by the control unit 17. The PlayList file and information of menu thumbnail pictures are created by the control unit 17 based on the user-command information inputted from the terminal 20.  The control unit 17 also creates the management information (info.dvr) of the recorded contents.<br>
The application database information created by the control unit 17 is processed through the ECC encoder 30   and modulator 31<br><br>
and inputted to the recording section 32, in the same way as the AV stream. The recording section 32 records the database files on the recording medium 10 based on the control signal given from the control unit 17. That is, the control unit 17 records the database files on the recording medium based on the data of the Allocation Info of DVR files and the information about the free areas on the recording medium. This processing will be explained in detail later with reference to Fig. 52 and Fig. 53.<br>
Next, the basic operation for reproduction will- be explained.<br>
The AV stream file, application database information and file system data have been recorded on the recording medium 10. First, the control unit 17 obtains the data of FSD to get the data of MIA, . similar to the aforementioned recording operation. The control unit 17 obtains the data of Allocation Info of DVR files (Fig. 49)   in MIA, and also obtains the location information of file data on the recording medium 10 by analyzing the data of Disc Region Table (Fig. 10, Fig. 20 and Fig. 21).<br>
Next, the control unit ,17 instructs the reading section 11 to read the application database information. The reading section 11 reads the application database information from the recording medium 10, and the database information is processed through the demodulator 12, ECC decoder 13 and is inputted to the control unit 17 via the buffer 71. This processing will be<br><br>
described in detail later with reference to Fig. 54 and Fig. 55. The control unit 17 outputs a list of PlayLists (a list of titles) recorded on the disc to the terminal 20 serving as a user interface, on the basis of the application database*. The user selects a PlayList desired to be reproduced from the list of PlayLists and then, the selected PlayList is inputted to the control unit 17. The control unit 17 instructs the reading section 11 to read the AV stream file necessary for reproducing the PlayList. Then, the reading section 11 reads the AV stream from the recording medium 10, and the AV stream is processed through the demodulator 12 and ECC decoder 13 and is inputted to the source depacketizer 14 via the buffer 71.<br>
The source depacketizer 14 converts the AV stream of the application format of the recording medium 10 into a stream which can be inputted to the demultiplexer 15. The demultiplexer 15 inputs the video stream (V) and audio stream (A) composing the AV stream for the designated reproduction zone (Playltem) specified by the control unit 17, to the AV decoder 16.  The AV decoder 16 decodes the video stream and audio stream to output the reproduction video signal and reproduction audio signal from the terminals 18 and"19, respectively.<br>
Next the recording processing of new Real PlayList {Clip AV stream and its database information) will be explained with reference to the flowcharts of Fig. 52 and Fig. 53.<br>
At step S110, the control unit 17 reads FSD (File System<br><br>
Descriptor). At step Sill, the control unit 17 reads MIA (including Allocation Info of DVR files and Disc Region Table) and stores it in the storage unit 17A.<br>
At step S112, the control unit 17 analyzes the data of Disc Region Table to obtain information of free areas on the recording medium 10.<br>
At step S113, the control unit 17 decides areas for LB Regions for files and for recording the file data of each group, based on the data of Allocation Info of DVR files (Fig. 49). These areas may be the same as the areas designated by Allocation Info of DVR files read, or may be not.<br>
At step SUA, the control unit 17 controls this recording so as to record the Clip AV stream in a free area of LB Regions for files excepting for LB Regions for Gathered files.<br>
At step S115, the control unit 17 obtains the data and name of the database file.<br>
At step S116, the control unit 17 decides Allocation class of the database file and the value of its Robust bit with reference to the table (stored in the storage unit 17A) of Fig. 43.<br>
At step S117, it is judged whether Robust bit is 1. When Robust bit is 1, then the process moves to step S118. ¦ Since two kinds of information are recorded, it is determined that one is the Main file data of the aforementioned Allocation class and the other is the Reserve file data of the aforementioned<br><br>
Allocation class (that is, double recording is performed).<br>
When it is judged at step S117 that Robust bit is 0, then the process moves to step S119. And it is determined that the kind of information to be recorded is the file data of the aforementioned Allocation class (that recording is performed once).<br>
At step S120, the control unit 17 records the. file data in the free area of the recording area for the group corresponding to that kind.<br>
At step S121, it is judged whether there is a database file to be recorded next, and when yes, the process returns to step S115 to repeat the aforementioned processing.<br>
When there is no database file to be recorded next, then at step S122, the control unit 17 creates the data of MIA for managing the records of file data on the recording medium 10 and records it on the recording medium 10.<br>
At step S123, the control unit 17 creates the data of FSD which indicates the recording address of MIA and records it on the recording medium 10. And then'the process is completed.<br>
Note that, as to the recording of a database file between step S115 and step S121, only files to be newly recorded can be recorded or all files (new files and already recorded files) can be recorded again, on the recording medium.  In addition, as to the recording of a database file between step S115 and step S121, Main file data is recorded and then reserve file data is<br><br>
recorded for each file having Robust bit of 1. However, the following processing can be performed. That is, main file data of all files having the same Allocation class is firstly recorded and then, reserve file data of all files having its Allocation class is recorded.<br>
Next, the processing of displaying a list of PlayLists (a list of titles) recorded on the recording medium 10 will be explained with reference to the flowcharts of Fig. 54 and Fig. 55.<br>
At step S201, the control unit 17 reads FSD (File System Descriptor) from the recording medium 10.<br>
At step S202, the control unit 17 reads MIA (including Allocation Info of DVR files and Disc Region Table) and stores it in the storage unit 17A.<br>
At step S203, the control unit 17 obtains Allocation class of the files recorded on the recording medium 10 and information of their Robust bits from MIA.<br>
At step S204, the control unit 17 obtains the.location information of file data (or Main file data) of database files having the same Allocation class, from Disc Region Table.  For example, in the case where this time is the first execution of step S204, it obtains the location information of Main file data of Gourp-1 files.<br>
At step S205, the control unit 17 continuously reads the file data from the recording medium 10 and stores them in the<br><br>
storage unit 17A.<br>
At step S206, the control unit 17 checks whether an error has occurred in the reading operation of the file data of step S205. When yes, then the control unit 17 moves to step S207 to check whether the Robust bit of the above read file is 1. When yes, the control unit 17 moves to step S208 to obtain the location information of the Reserve File Data of the database file having the above Allocation class from Disc Region Table. At step S209, the control unit 17 reads the Reserve File Data corresponding' to the Main data of which  the reading has been failed, from the recording medium 10 and stores it in the storage unit 17A.<br>
When a negative result is obtained at step S206 (when an error has not occurred in the reading operation of the file data), the process moves to step S210.<br>
When a negative result is obtained at step S207 (when it is judges that the Robust bit is 0), the process moves to step S210. In this case, it is impossible to make compensation for the file data of which the recording has been failed.<br>
At step S210, it is judged whether, the reading of database files is completed. When no, then the process returns to step S204 to repeat the aforementioned processing. For' example, the reading of files of Gourp-2 files will be performed next. At step S211, the control unit- 17 outputs a list of PlayLists recorded on the recording medium 10 to the terminal 20<br><br>
serving as a user interface based on the information of database files stored in'the storage unit 17A. Then the processing is completed.<br>
Note that, at above step S205, the control unit 17 can read data of files one by one from the recording medium 10 based on each Disc Region Record (Fig. 21) of Disc Region Table (Fig. 20), but the reading of file data can be speeded up by the following processing of Fig. 56 or Fig. 57.<br>
In the example of Fig. 56, step S301 is to obtain data in the recording area for the group (for example, Main LB Regions for Group-1 files) corresponding to the kind of file data.<br>
Step S302 is to continuously read all data in the recording area for the group (all data including file data and data of free areas) from the recording medium 10 and store it in the buffer .71.<br>
Step S303 is to restore each file from the data stored in the buffer 71 based on the data in MIA {management data of files), and to store it in the storage unit 17A (in the case of Fig. 47, file-1, file-2, file-3 and file-4 are restored).<br>
In the,example of Fig. 57, step S401 is to obtain data of the recording area for the group (for example, Main LB Regions for Group-1 files) corresponding to the kind of file data (Allocation class, Main file data or Reserve file data).<br>
Step S402 is to obtain the maximum range of areas in which file, data are arranged, in the recording area for the above<br><br>
group based on the data of Disc Region Table (for example, the range shown by "the maximum range of areas storing file data" in Fig. 47 (the range between the head of file-1 which is the first file and the tail of file-4 which is the last file)).<br>
Step S403 is to continuously read all data (all data including file data and data of the free areas) within the above range from the recording medium 10 and to store them in the buffer 71.<br>
Step S404 is to restore each file from the data stored in the buffer 71 based on the data of MIA (management data of files) and store it in the storage unit 17A (in the example of Fig. 47, file-1, file-2, file-3 and  file 4. are restored).<br>
In the aforementioned processing of step S4Q2, the maximum range of areas where the file data are arranged can be obtained in the following manner.<br>
As to each Disc Region Record (Fig. 21) of Disc Region Table (Fig. 20), Records which reference the recording area for a group (for example, Main LB Regions for Group-1 files) are obtained.  That is, Records which reference the recording area for the group are obtained based on Start Logical Block Number and End Logical Block Number of Disc Region Record. The minimum value of Start Logical Block Number and the maximum value of End Logical Block Number are obtained based on the Records obtained. The range between the minimum number and the maximum number is the maximum range of areas in which file data are arranged, in<br><br>
the recording area for the group.<br>
The aforementioned processing can be executed not only by hardware but also by software. .In this case, programs composing the software are installed via the network or a recording medium into a computer having a special hardware or a normal personal computer which is capable of executing various functions by installing various programs.<br>
As shown in Fig. 28, this recording medium may be not only the magnetic disk 51 (including a floppy disk), optical disc 52 (including CD-ROM (Compact Disc-Read Only Memory) and DVD (Digital Versatile Disc)), magneto-optical disc 53 (including MD (MiniDisc)) or package media such as a semiconductor memory 54, which store programs and are distributed to provide a user with programs separately from the apparatus, but also a ROM or hard disk which stores programs and are supplied to users by being incorporated into the apparatus.<br>
Note that, in this description, steps which describe programs stored on the recording medium include processes which are not necessarily executed in time series but executed at the same time or separately, as well as processes which are executed in time series in the explained order.<br>
Further, in this description, the system means the entire equipment composed of plural apparatuses.<br>
As described above, this invention makes it possible to realize an information recording medium of which the information<br><br>
can be read rapidly.<br>
Further, this invention makes it possible to read information rapidly.<br>
Furthermore, this invention makes it possible to provide an information recording medium which is capable of -reading information rapidly.<br>
