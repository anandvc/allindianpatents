				<td>SPIRO-OXINDOLE COMPOUNDS AND THEIR USES AS THERAPEUTIC AGENTS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to spiro-oxindole compounds. In particular, this invention is directed to spiro-oxindole compounds that are sodium channel blockers and are therefore useful in treating sodium channel-mediated diseases or conditions, such as pain, as well as other diseases and conditions associated with the mediation of sodium channels.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Voltage-gated sodium channels, transmembrane proteins that initiate action potentials in nerve, muscle and other electrically excitable cells, are a necessary component of normal sensation, emotions, thoughts and movements (Catterall, W.A., Nature (2001), Vol. 409, pp. 988-990). These channels consist of a highly processed alpha subunit that is associated with auxiliary beta subunits. The pore-forming alpha subunit is sufficient for channel function, but the kinetics and voltage dependence of channel gating are in part modified by the beta subunits (Goldin et al., Neuron (2000), Vol. 28, pp. 365-368). Each alpha-subunit contains four homologous domains, I to IV, each with six predicted transmembrane segments. The alpha-subunit of the sodium channel, forming the ion-conducting pore and containing the voltage sensors regulating sodium ion conduction has a relative molecular mass of 260,000. Electrophysiological recording, biochemical purification, and molecular cloning have identified ten different sodium channel alpha subunits and four beta subunits (Yu, F.H., et al., Sci. STKE (2004), 253; and Yu, F.H., et al., Neurosci. (2003), 20:7577-85).<br>
The hallmarks of sodium channels include rapid activation and inactivation when the voltage across the plasma membrane of an excitable cell is depolarized (voltage-dependent gating), and efficient and selective conduction of sodium ions through conducting pores intrinsic to the structure of the protein (Sato, C, et al., Nature (2001), 409:1047-1051). At negative or hyperpolarized membrane potentials, sodium channels are closed. Following membrane depolarization, sodium channels open rapidly and then inactivate. Channels only conduct currents in the open state and, )     once inactivated, have to return to the resting state, favoured by membrane<br>
hyperpolarization, before they can reopen. Different sodium channel subtypes vary in the voltage range over which they activate and inactivate as well as their activation and inactivation kinetics.<br><br>
The sodium channel family of proteins has been extensively studied and shown to be involved in a number of vital body functions. Research in this area has identified variants of the alpha subunits that result in major changes in channel function and activities, which can ultimately lead to major pathophysiological conditions. Implicit with function, this family of proteins are considered prime points of therapeutic intervention. Na/1.1 and Nay1.2 are highly expressed in the brain (Raymond, C.K., et al., J. Biol. Chem. (2004), 279(44):46234-41) and are vital to normal brain function.  In humans, mutations in Nay1.1 and Na^l.2 result in severe epileptic states and in some cases mental decline (Rhodes, T.H., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (2004),101(30):11147-52; Kamiya, KM etal., J. Biol. Chem. (2004), 24(11) :2690-8; Pereira, S., et al., Neurology (2004), 63(1):191-2). As such both channels have been considered as validated targets for the treatment of epilepsy (see PCT Published Patent Publication No. WO 01/38564).<br>
Na/1.3 is broadly expressed throughout the body (Raymond, C.K., et al., op. cit.). It has been demonstrated to have its expression upregulated in the dorsal horn sensory neurons of rats after nervous system injury (Hains, B.D., et al., J. Neurosci. (2003), 23(26):8881-92). Many experts in the field have considered Nav1.3 as a suitable target for pain therapeutics (Lai, J., et al., Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. (2003), (3):291-72003; Wood, J.N., et al., J. Neurobiol. (2004), 61(1):55-71; Chung, J.M., et al., Novartis Found Symp. (2004), 261:19-27; discussion 27-31, 47-54).<br>
Nai/1.4 expression is essentially limited to muscle (Raymond, C.K., et al., op. cit.). Mutations in this gene have been shown to have profound effects on muscle function including paralysis, (Tamaoka A., Intern. Med. (2003), (9):769-70). Thus, this channel can be considered a target for the treatment of abnormal muscle contractility, spasm or paralysis.<br>
The cardiac sodium channel, Nav1.5, is expressed mainly in the heart ventricles and atria (Raymond, C.K., et al., op. cit.), and can be found in the sinovial node, ventricular node and possibly Purkinje cells. The rapid upstroke of the cardiac action potential and the rapid impulse conduction through cardiac tissue is due to the opening of Nav1.5. As such, Na^l.5 is central to the genesis of cardiac arrhythmias. Mutations in human Nav1.5 result in multiple arrhythmic syndromes, including, for example, long QT3 (LQT3), Brugada syndrome (BS), an inherited cardiac conduction defect, sudden unexpected nocturnal death syndrome (SUNDS) and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) (Liu, H. et al., Am. J. Pharmacogenomics (2003), 3(3):173-9). Sodium channel blocker therapy has been used extensively in treating cardiac arrhythmias. The first<br><br>
antiarrhythmic drug, quinidine, discovered in 1914, is classified as a sodium channel blocker.<br>
Nai/I.6 encodes an abundant, widely distributed voltage-gated sodium channel found throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems, clustered in the nodes of Ranvier of neural axons (Caldwell, J.H., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (2000), 97(10): 5616-20). Although no mutations in humans have been detected, Nav1.6 is thought to play a role in the manifestation of the symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis and has been considered as a target for the treatment of this disease (Craner, M.J.. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (2004), 101(21):8168-73).<br>
Nav1 -7 was first cloned from the pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line (Toledo-Aral, J. J,, et al., Proc. Natl.Acad. Sci. USA (1997), 94:1527-1532). Its presence at high levels in the growth cones of small-diameter neurons suggested that it could play a role in the transmission of nociceptive information. Although this has been challenged by experts in the field as Nav1.7 is also expressed in neuroendocrine cells associated with the autonomic system (Klugbauer, N., et al., EMBO J. (1995), 14(6):1084-90) and as such has been implicated in autonomic processes. The implicit role in autonomic functions was demonstrated with the generation of Na/1.7 null mutants; deleting Nay1.7 in all sensory and sympathetic neurons resulted in a lethal perinatal phenotype. (Nassar, etal., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (2004), 101(34):12706-11.). In contrast, by deleting the Na*/1.7 expression in a subset of sensory neurons that are predominantly nociceptive, a role in pain mechanisms, was demonstrated (Nassar, et al., op. cit.). Further support for Nav1.7 blockers active in a subset of neurons is supported by the finding that two human heritable pain conditions, primary erythermalgia and familial rectal pain, have been shown to map to Nay/1.7 (Yang, Y., et al., J. Med. Genet. (2004), 41(3):171-4).<br>
The expression of Nav1.8 is essentially restricted to the DRG (Raymond, C.K., et al., op. cit.). There are no identified human mutations for Na^/1.8. However, Nav1.8-null mutant mice were viable, fertile and normal in appearance. A pronounced analgesia to noxious mechanical stimuli, small deficits in noxious thermoreception and delayed development of inflammatory hyperalgesia suggested to the researchers that Nav1.8 plays a major role in pain signalling (Akopian, A. N., et al., Nat Neurosci. (1999), 2(6): 541-8). Blocking of this channel is widely accepted as a potential treatment for pain (Lai, J, etal., op. cit; Wood, J.N., etal., op. cit.] Chung, J.M., etal., op. cit.). PCT Published Patent Application No. WO03/037274A2 describes pyrazole-amides and sulfonamides for the treatment of central or peripheral nervous system<br><br>
conditions, particularly pain and chronic pain by blocking sodium channels associated with the onset or recurrance of the indicated conditions. PCT Published Patent Application No. WO03/037890A2 describes piperidines for the treatment of central or peripheral nervous system conditions, particularly pain and chronic pain by blocking sodium channels associated with the onset or recurrence of the indicated conditions. The compounds, compositions and methods of these inventions are of particular use for treating neuropathic or inflammatory pain by the inhibition of ion flux through a channel that includes a PN3 (Nav1.8) subunit.<br>
The tetrodotoxin insensitive, peripheral sodium channel Na/I.9, disclosed by Dib-Hajj, S.D., et al. (see Dib-Hajj, S.D., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1998), 95(15):8963-8) was shown to reside solely in the dorsal root ganglia. It has been demonstrated that Nay1.9 underlies neurotrophin (BDNF)-evoked depolarization and excitation, and is the only member of the voltage gated sodium channel superfamily to be shown to be ligand mediated (Blum, R., Kafitz, K.W., Konnerth, A., Nature (2002), 419 (6908):687-93). The limited pattern of expression of this channel has made it a candidate target for the treatment of pain (Lai, J, et al., op. cit.\ Wood, J.N., et al., op. cit.\ Chung, J.M. et al., op. cit).<br>
NaX is a putative sodium channel, which has not been shown to be voltage gated. In addition to expression in the lung, heart, dorsal root ganglia, and Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system, NaX is found in neurons and ependymal cells in restricted areas of the CNS, particularly in the circumventricular organs, which are involved in body-fluid homeostasis (Watanabe, E., et al., J. Neurosci. (2000), 20(20)7743-51). NaX-null mice showed abnormal intakes of hypertonic saline under both water- and salt-depleted conditions. These findings suggest that the NaX plays an important role in the central sensing of body-fluid sodium level and regulation of salt intake behaviour. Its pattern of expression and function suggest it as a target for the treatment of cystic fibrosis and other related salt regulating maladies.<br>
Studies with the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) used to lower neuron activity in certain regions of the brain, indicate its potential use in the treatment of addiction. Drug-paired stimuli elicit drug craving and relapse in addicts and drug-seeking behavior in rats. The functional integrity of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is necessary for reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behaviour elicited by cocaine-conditioned stimuli, but not by cocaine itself. BLA plays a similar role in reinstatement of heroin-seeking behavior. TTX-induced inactivation of the BLA on conditioned and heroin-primed reinstatement of extinguished heroin-seeking behaviour in a rat model<br><br>
(Fuchs, R.A. and See, R.E., Psychopharmacology (2002) 160(4):425-33).<br>
This closely related family of proteins has long been recognised as targets for therapeutic intervention. Sodium channels are targeted by a diverse array of pharmacological agents. These include neurotoxins, antiarrhythmics, anticonvulsants and local anesthetics (Clare, J.J., et al.. Drug Discovery Today (2000) 5:506-520). All of the current pharmacological agents that act on sodium channels have receptor sites on the alpha subunits. At least six distinct receptor sites for neurotoxins and one receptor site for local anesthetics and related drugs have been identified (Cestele, S. et al.. Biochimie (2000), Vol. 82, pp. 883-892).<br>
The small molecule sodium channel blockers or the local anesthetics and related antiepileptic and antiarrhythmic drugs, interact with overlapping receptor sites located in the inner cavity of the pore of the sodium channel (Catterall, W.A., Neuron (2000), 26:13-25). Amino acid residues in the S6 segments from at least three of the four domains contribute to this complex drug receptor site, with the IVS6 segment playing the dominant role. These regions are highly conserved and as such most sodium channel blockers known to date interact with similar potency with all channel subtypes. Nevertheless, it has been possible to produce sodium channel blockers with therapeutic selectivity and a sufficient therapeutic window for the treatment of epilepsy (e.g. lamotrignine, phenytoin and carbamazepine) and certain cardiac arrhythmias (e.g. lignocaine, tocainide and mexiletine). However, the potency and therapeutic index of these blockers is not optimal and have limited the usefulness of these compounds in a variety of therapeutic areas where a sodium channel blocker would be ideally suited. Management of Acute and Chronic Pain<br>
Drug therapy is the mainstay of management for acute and chronic pain in all age groups, including neonates, infants and children. The pain drugs are classified by the American Pain Society into three main categories: 1) non-opioid analgesics-acetaminophen, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including salicylates (e.g. aspirin), 2) opioid analgesics and 3) co-analgesics.<br>
Non-opioid analgesics such as acetaminophen and NSAIDs are useful for acute and chronic pain due to a variety of causes including surgery, trauma, arthritis and cancer. NSAIDs are indicated for pain involving inflammation because acetaminophen lacks anti-inflammatory activity. Opioids also lack anti-inflammatory activity. All NSAIDs inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), thereby inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis and reducing the inflammatory pain response. There are at least two COX isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2. Common non-selective COX inhibitors<br><br>
include, ibuprofen and naproxen. Inhibition of COX-1, which is found in platelets, Gl tract, kidneys and most other human tissues, is thought to be associated with adverse effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding. The development of selective COX-2 NSAIDs, such as Celecoxib, Valdecoxib and Rofecoxib, have the benefits of nonselective NSAIDs with reduced adverse effect profiles in the gut and kidney. However, evidence now suggests that chronic use of certain selective COX-2 inhibitors can result in an increased risk of stroke occurrence.<br>
The use of opioid analgesics is recommended by the American Pain Society to be initiated based on a pain-directed history and physical that includes repeated pain assessment. Due to the broad adverse effect profiles associated with opiate use, therapy should include a diagnosis, integrated interdisciplinary treatment plan and appropriate ongoing patient monitoring.  It is further recommended that opioids be added to non-opioids to manage acute pain and cancer related pain that does not respond to non-opioids alone. Opioid analgesics act as agonists to specific receptors of the mu and kappa types in the central and peripheral nervous system. Depending on the opioid and its formulation or mode of administration it can be of shorter or longer duration. All opioid analgesics have a risk of causing respiratory depression, liver failure, addiction and dependency, and as such are not ideal for long-term or chronic pain management.<br>
A number of other classes of drugs may enhance the effects of opioids or NSAIDSs, have independent analgesic activity in certain situations, or counteract the side effects of analgesics. Regardless of which of these actions the drug has, they are collectively termed "coanalgesics". Tricyclic antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, local anaesthetics, glucocorticoids, skeletal muscle relaxants, anti-spasmodil agents, antihistamines, benzodiazepines, caffeine, topical agents (e.g. capsaicin), dextroamphetamine and phenothizines are all used in the clinic as adjuvant therapies or individually in the treatment of pain. The antiepeileptic drugs in particular have enjoyed some success in treating pain conditions. For instance, Gabapentin, which has an unconfirmed therapeutic target, is indicated for neuropathic pain. Other clinical trials are attempting to establish that central neuropathic pain may respond to ion channel blockers such as blockers of calcium, sodium and/or NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) channels. Currently in development are low affinity NMDA channel blocking agents for the treatment of neuropathic pain. The literature provides substantial preclinical electrophysiological evidence in support of the use of NMDA antagonists in the treatment of neuropathic pain. Such agents also may find use in the control of pain<br><br>
after tolerance to opioid analgesia occurs, particularly in cancer patients.<br>
Systemic analgesics such as NSAIDs and opioids are to be distinguished from therapeutic agents which are useful only as local analgesics/anaesthetics. Well known local analgesics such as lidocaine and xylocaine are non-selective ion channel blockers which can be fatal when administered systemically. A good description of non-selective sodium channel blockers is found in Madge, D. et al., J. Med. Chem. (2001), 44(2):115-37.<br>
Several sodium channel modulators are known for use as anticonvulsants or antidepressants, such as carbamazepine, amitriptyline, lamotrigine and riluzole, all of which target brain tetradotoxin- sensitive (TTX-S) sodium channels. Such TTX-S agents suffer from dose- limiting side effects, including dizziness, ataxia and somnolence, primarily due to action at TTX-S channels in the brain. Sodium Channels Role in Pain<br>
Sodium channels play a diverse set of roles in maintaining normal and pathological states, including the long recognized role that voltage gated sodium channels play in the generation of abnormal neuronal activity and neuropathic or pathological pain (Chung, J.M. et al.). Damage to peripheral nerves following trauma or disease can result in changes to sodium channel activity and the development of abnormal afferent activity including ectopic discharges from axotomised afferents and spontaneous activity of sensitized intact nociceptors. These changes can produce long-lasting abnormal hypersensitivity to normally innocuous stimuli, or allodynia. Examples of neuropathic pain include, but are not limited to, post-herpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, chronic lower back pain, phantom limb pain, and pain resulting from cancer and chemotherapy, chronic pelvic pain, complex regional pain syndrome and related neuralgias.<br>
There has been some degree of success in treating neuropathic pain symptoms by using medications, such as gabapentin, and more recently pregabalin, as short-term, first-line treatments. However, pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain has generally had limited success with little response to commonly used pain reducing drugs, such as NSAIDS and opiates. Consequently, there is still a considerable need to explore novel treatment modalities.<br>
There remains a limited number of potent effective sodium channel blockers with a minimum of adverse events in the clinic. There is also an unmet medical need to treat neuropathic pain and other sodium channel associated pathological states effectively and without adverse side effects. The present invention provides<br><br>
compounds, methods of use and compositions that include these compounds to meet these critical needs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

"Prodrugs" is meant to indicate a compound that may be converted under physiological conditions or by solvolysis to a biologically active compound of the invention. Thus, the term "prodrug" refers to a metabolic precursor of a compound of the invention that is pharmaceutically acceptable. A prodrug may be inactive when administered to a subject in need thereof, but is converted in vivo to an active compound of the invention. Prodrugs are typically rapidly transformed in vivo to yield the parent compound of the invention, for example, by hydrolysis in blood. The prodrug compound often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility or delayed release in a mammalian organism (see, Bundgard, H., Design of Prodrugs (1985), pp. 7-9, 21-24 (Elsevier, Amsterdam)).A discussion of prodrugs is provided in Higuchi, T., et a/., "Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems," A.C.S. Symposium Series, Vol. 14, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, Ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are incorporated in full by reference herein.<br><br>
The term "prodrug" is also meant to include any covalently bonded carriers, which release the active compound of the invention in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject. Prodrugs of a compound of the invention may be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the compound of the invention in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent compound of the invention. Prodrugs include compounds of the invention wherein a hydroxy, amino or mercapto group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug of the compound of the invention is administered to a mammalian subject, cleaves to form a free hydroxy, free amino or free mercapto group, respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of alcohol or amide derivatives of amine functional groups in the compounds of the invention and the like.<br>
The invention disclosed herein is also meant to encompass all pharmaceutical^ acceptable compounds of formula (I) being isotopically-labelled by having one or more atoms replaced by an atom having a different atomic mass or mass number. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into the disclosed compounds include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine, chlorine, and iodine, such as 2H, 3H, 11C, 13C, 14C, 13N, 15N, 150, 170, 180,31P, 32P, 35S, 1SF, 36CI, 123l, and 125l, respectively. These radiolabeled compounds could be useful to help determine or measure the effectiveness of the compounds, by characterizing, for example, the site or mode of action on the sodium channels, or binding affinity to pharmacologically important site of action on the sodium channels.   Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of formula (I), for example, those incorporating a radioactive isotope, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e. 3H, and carbon-14, i.e. 14C, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection.<br>
Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e. 2H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements, and hence may be preferred in some circumstances.<br>
Substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as 11C, 18F, 150 and 13N, can be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically-labeled compounds of formula (I) can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the Examples and Preparations as set out below using<br><br>
an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent previously employed.<br>
The invention disclosed herein is also meant to encompass the in vivo metabolic products of the disclosed compounds. Such products may result from, for example, the oxidation, reducation, hydrolysis, amidation, esterification, and the like of the administered compound, primarily due to enzymatic processes. Accordingly, the invention includes compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof. Such products are typically are identified by administering a radiolabeled compound of the invention in a detectable dose to an animal, such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or to human, allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur, and isolating its coversion products from the urine, blood or other biological samples.<br>

UTILITY AND TESTING OF THE COMPOUNDS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of using the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of sodium channel-mediated diseases, preferably diseases related to pain, central nervous conditions such as epilepsy, anxiety, depression and bipolar disease; cardiovascular conditions such as arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation; neuromuscular conditions such as restless leg syndrome and muscle paralysis or tetanus; neuroprotection against stroke, neural trauma and multiple sclerosis; and channelopathies such as erythromyalgia and familial rectal pain syndrome, by administering to a patient in need of such treatment an effective amount of a sodium channel blocker modulating, especially inhibiting, agent.<br>
In general, the present invention provides a method for treating a patient for, or protecting a patient from developing, a sodium channel-mediated disease, especially pain, comprising administering to an animal, such as a mammal, especially a human patient in need thereof, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the invention wherein the compound modulates the activity of one or more voltage-dependent sodium channels.<br>
The general value of the compounds of the invention in mediating, especially inhibiting, the sodium channel ion flux can be determined using the assays described below in the Biological Assays section. Alternatively, the general value of the compounds in treating conditions and diseases may be established in industry standard animal models for demonstrating the efficacy of compounds in treating pain. Animal models of human neuropathic pain conditions have been developed that result in reproducible sensory deficits (allodynia, hyperalgesia, and spontaneous pain) over a sustained period of time that can be evaluated by sensory testing.  By establishing the degree of mechanical, chemical, and temperature induced allodynia and hyperalgesia present, several physiopathological conditions observed in humans can be modeled allowing the evaluation of pharmacotherapies.<br>
In rat models of peripheral nerve injury, ectopic activity in the injured nerve corresponds to the behavioural signs of pain. In these models, intravenous application of the sodium channel blocker and local anesthetic lidocaine can suppress the ectopic activity and reverse the tactile allodynia at concentrations that do not affect general behaviour and motor function (Mao, J. and Chen, L.L, Pain (2000), 87:7-17). Allimetric<br><br>
scaling of the doses effective in these rat models, translates into doses similar to those shown to be efficacious in humans (Tanelian, D.L. and Brose, W.G., Anesthesiology (1991), 74(5):949-951). Furthermore, Lidoderm®, lidocaine applied in the form of a dermal patch, is currently an FDA approved treatment for post-herpetic neuralgia (Devers, A. and Glaler, B.S., Clin. J. Pain (2000), 16(3):205-8).<br>
Sodium channel blockers have clinical uses in addition to pain. Epilepsy and cardiac arrhythmias are often targets of sodium channel blockers. Recent evidence from animal models suggest that sodium channel blockers may also be useful for neuroprotection under ischaemic conditions caused by stroke or neural trauma and in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) (Clare, J.J. et al., op. cit. and Anger, T. et al., op. cit.).<br>
The compounds of the invention modulate, preferably inhibit, ion flux through a voltage-dependent sodium channel in a mammal, especially in a human. Any such modulation, whether it be partial or complete inhibition or prevention of ion flux, is sometimes referred to herein as "blocking" and corresponding compounds as "blockers". In general, the compounds of the invention modulates the activity of a sodium channel downwards, inhibits the voltage-dependent activity of the sodium channel, and/or reduces or prevents sodium ion flux across a cell membrane by preventing sodium channel activity such as ion flux.<br>
The compounds of the instant invention are sodium channel blockers and are therefore useful for treating diseases and conditions in humans and other organisms, including all those human diseases and conditions which are the result of aberrant voltage-dependent sodium channel biological activity or which may be ameliorated by modulation of voltage-dependent sodium channel biological activity.<br>
As defined herein, a sodium channel-mediated disease or condition refers to a disease or condition which is ameliorated upon modulation of the sodium channel and includes, but is not limited to, pain, central nervous conditions such as epilepsy, anxiety, depression and bipolar disease; cardiovascular conditions such as arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation; neuromuscular conditions such as restless leg syndrome and muscle paralysis or tetanus; neuroprotection against stroke, neural trauma and multiple sclerosis; and channelopathies such as erythromyalgia and familial rectal pain syndrome.<br>
A sodium channel-mediated disease or condition also includes pain associated with HIV, HIV treatment induced neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, neuropathy secondary to metastatic infiltration, adiposis dolorosa, thalamic<br><br>

epileptogenic), familial Mediterranean fever syndrome, gout, restless leg syndrome, arrhythmias, fibromyalgia, neuroprotection under ischaemic conditions caused by stroke or neural trauma, tachyarrhythmias, atrial fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation and as a general or local anaesthetic.<br>
As used herein, the term "pain" refers to all categories of pain and is recognized to include, but is not limited to, neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, nociceptive pain, idiopathic pain, neuralgic pain, orofacial pain, burn pain, burning mouth syndrome, somatic pain, visceral pain, myofacial pain, dental pain, cancer pain, chemotherapy pain, trauma pain, surgical pain, post-surgical pain, childbirth pain, labor pain, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, brachial plexus avulsion, neurogenic bladder, acute pain (e.g. musculoskeletal and post-operative pain), chronic pain, persistent pain, peripherally mediated pain, centrally mediated pain, chronic headache, migraine headache, familial hemiplegic migraine, conditions associated with cephalic pain, sinus headache, tension headache, phantom limb pain, peripheral nerve injury, pain following stroke, thalamic lesions, radiculopathy,HIV pain, post-herpetic pain, non-cardiac chest pain, irritable bowel syndrome and pain associated with bowel disorders and dyspepsia, and combinations thereof.<br>
The compounds identified in the instant specification inhibit the ion flux through a voltage-dependent sodium channel. Preferably, the compounds are state or frequency dependent modifers of the sodium channels, having a low affinity for the rested/closed state and a high affinity for the inactivated state. These compounds are likely to interact with overlapping sites located in the inner cavity of the sodium conducting pore of the channel similar to that described for other state-dependent sodium channel blockers (Cestele, S., et al., op. cit). These compounds may also be likely to interact with sites outside of the inner cavity and have allosteric effects on sodium ion conduction through the channel pore.<br>
Any of these consequences may ultimately be responsible for the overall therapeutic benefit provided by these compounds.<br>
The present invention readily affords many different means for identification of sodium channel modulating agents that are useful as therapeutic agents. Identification of modulators of sodium channel can be assessed using a variety of in vitro and in vivo assays, e.g. measuring current, measuring membrane potential, measuring ion flux, (e.g. sodium or guanidinium), measuring sodium concentration, measuring second messengers and transcription levels, and using e.g., voltage-sensitive dyes, radioactive tracers, and patch-clamp electrophysiology.<br><br>
One such protocol involves the screening of chemical agents for ability to modulate the activity of a sodium channel thereby identifying it as a modulating agent.<br>
A typical assay described in Bean et al., J. General Physiology (1983), 83:613-642, and Leuwer, M., et al., Br. J. Pharmacol (2004), 141(1):47-54, uses patch-clamp techniques to study the behaviour of channels. Such techniques are known to those skilled in the art, and may be developed, using current technologies, into low or medium throughput assays for evaluating compounds for their ability to modulate sodium channel behaviour.<br>
A competitive binding assay with known sodium channel toxins such as tetrodotoxin, alpha-scorpion toxins, aconitine, BTX and the like, may be suitable for identifying potential therapeutic agents with high selectivity for a particular sodium channel. The use of BTX in such a binding assay is well known and is described in McNeal, E.T., et al., J. Med. Chem. (1985), 28(3):381-8; and Creveling, C.R.,etal., Methods in Neuroscience, Vol.8: Neurotoxins (Conn PM Ed) (1992), pp. 25-37, Academic Press, New York.<br>
These assays can be carried out in cells, or cell or tissue extracts expressing the channel of interest in a natural endogenous setting or in a recombinant setting. The assays that can be used include plate assays which measure Na+ influx through surrogate markers such as 14C-guanidine influx or determine cell depolarization using fluorescent dyes such as the FRET based and other fluorescent assays or a radiolabeled binding assay employing radiolabeled aconitine, BTX, TTX or STX. More direct measurements can be made with manual or automated electrophysiology systems. The guanidine influx assay is explained in more detail below in the Biological Assays section.<br>
Throughput of test compounds is an important consideration in the choice of screening assay to be used. In some strategies, where hundreds of thousands of compounds are to be tested, it is not desirable to use low throughput means. In other cases, however, low throughput is satisfactory to identify important differences between a limited number of compounds. Often it will be necessary to combine assay types to identify specific sodium channel modulating compounds.<br>
Electrophysiological assays using patch clamp techniques is accepted as a gold standard for detailed characterization of sodium channel compound interactions, and as described in Bean et al., op. cit. and Leuwer, M., et al., op. cit. There is a manual low-throughput screening (LTS) method which can compare 2-10 compounds per day; a recently developed system for automated medium-throughput screening<br><br>
(MTS) at 20-50 patches (i.e. compounds) per day; and a technology from Molecular Devices Corporation (Sunnyvale, CA) which permits automated high-throughput screening (HTS) at 1000-3000 patches (i.e. compounds) per day.<br>
One automated patch-clamp system utilizes planar electrode technology to accelerate the rate of drug discovery. Planar electrodes are capable of achieving high-resistance, cells-attached seals followed by stable, low-noise whole-cell recordings that are comparable to conventional recordings. A suitable instrument is the PatchXpress 7000A (Axon Instruments Inc, Union City, CA). A variety of cell lines and culture techniques, which include adherent cells as well as cells growing spontaneously in suspension are ranked for seal success rate and stability. Immortalized cells (e.g. HEK and CHO) stably expressing high levels of the relevant sodium ion channel can be adapted into high-density suspension cultures.<br>
Other assays can be selected which allow the investigator to identify compounds which block specific states of the channel, such as the open state, closed state or the resting state, or which block transition from open to closed, closed to resting or resting to open. Those skilled in the art are generally familiar with such assays.<br>
Binding assays are also available, however these are of only limited functional value and information content. Designs include traditional radioactive filter based binding assays or the confocal based fluorescent system available from Evotec OAI group of companies (Hamburg, Germany), both of which are HTS.<br>
Radioactive flux assays can also be used. In this assay, channels are stimulated to open with veratridine or aconitine and held in a stabilized open state with a toxin, and channel blockers are identified by their ability to prevent ion influx. The assay can use radioactive 22[Na] and 14[C] guanidinium ions as tracers. FlashPlate &amp; Cytostar-T plates in living cells avoids separation steps and are suitable for HTS. Scintillation plate technology has also advanced this method to HTS suitability. Because of the functional aspects of the assay, the information content is reasonably good.<br>
Yet another format measures the redistribution of membrane potential using the FLIPR system membrane potential kit (HTS) available from Molecular Dynamics (a division of Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). This method is limited to slow membrane potential changes. Some problems may result from the fluorescent background of compounds. Test compounds may also directly influence the fluidity of the cell membrane and lead to an increase in intracellular dye concentrations. Still,<br><br>
because of the functional aspects of the assay, the information content is reasonably good.<br>
Sodium dyes can be used to measure the rate or amount of sodium ion influx through a channel. This type of assay provides a very high information content regarding potential channel blockers. The assay is functional and would measure Na+ influx directly. CoroNa Red, SBFI and/or sodium green (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene OR) can be used to measure Na influx; all are Na responsive dyes. They can be used in combination with the FLIPR instrument. The use of these dyes in a screen has not been previously described in the literature. Calcium dyes may also have potential in this format.<br>
In another assay, FRET based voltage sensors are used to measure the ability of a test compound to directly block Na influx. Commercially available HTS systems include the VIPR™ II FRET system (Aurora Biosciences Corporation, San Diego, CA, a division of Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) which may be used in conjunction with FRET dyes, also available from Aurora Biosciences. This assay measures sub-second responses to voltage changes. There is no requirement for a modifier of channel function. The assay measures depolarization and hyperpolarizations, and provides ratiometric outputs for quantification. A somewhat less expensive MTS version of this assay employs the FLEXstation™ (Molecular Devices Corporation) in conjunction with FRET dyes from Aurora Biosciences. Other methods of testing the compounds disclosed herein are also readily known and available to those skilled in the art.<br>
These results provide the basis for analysis of the structure-activity relationship (SAR) between test compounds and the sodium channel. Certain substituents on the core structure of the test compound tend to provide more potent inhibitory compounds. SAR analysis is one of the tools those skilled in the art may now employ to identify preferred embodiments of the compounds of the invention for use as therapeutic agents.<br>
Modulating agents so identified are then tested in a variety of in vivo models so as to determine if they alleviate pain, especially chronic pain or other conditions such as arrhythmias and epilepsy with minimal adverse events. The assays described below in the Biological Assays Section are useful in assessing the biological activity of the instant compounds.<br>
Typically, a successful therapeutic agent of the present invention will meet some or all of the following criteria. Oral availability should be at or above 20%. Animal model efficacy is less than about 0.1 pg to about 100 mg/Kg body weight and<br><br>
the target human dose is between 0.1 M9 to about 100 mg/Kg body weight, although doses outside of this range may be acceptable ("mg/Kg" means milligrams of compound per kilogram of body mass of the subject to whom it is being administered). The therapeutic index (or ratio of toxic dose to therapeutic dose) should be greater than 100. The potency (as expressed by IC50 value) should be less than 10 pM, preferably below 1 |jM and most preferably below 50 nM. The IC50 ("Inhibitory Concentration - 50%") is a measure of the amount of compound required to achieve 50% inhibition of ion flux through a sodium channel, over a specific time period, in an assay of the invention. Compounds of the present invention in the guanidine influx assay have demonstrated IC-50s ranging from less than a nanomolar to less than 10 micromolar.<br>
In an alternative use of the invention, the compounds of the invention can be used in in vitro or in vivo studies as exemplary agents for comparative purposes to find other compounds also useful in treatment of, or protection from, the various diseases disclosed herein.<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to inhibiting Nav1.1, Nay1.2, Nav1.3, Nav1.4, Na/1.5, Na/1.6, Na/1.7, Na/1.8, or Na^1.9 activity in a biological sample or a patient, which method comprises administering to the patient, or contacting said biological sample with a compound of formula I or a composition comprising said compound. The term "biological sample", as used herein, includes, without limitation, cell cultures or extracts thereof; biopsied material obtained from a mammal or extracts thereof; and blood, saliva, urine, feces, semen, tears, or other body fluids or extracts thereof.<br>
Inhibition of Na/1.1, Nav1.2, Na/I.3, Nav1.4, Nav1.5, Na/I.6, Nav1.7, Na/I.8, or Na/1.9 activity in a biological sample is useful for a variety of purposes that are known to one of skill in the art. Examples of such purposes include, but are not limited to, the study of sodium ion channels in biological and pathological phenomena; and the comparative evaluation of new sodium ion channel inhibitors.<br>
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS OF THE INVENTION AND ADMINISTRATION<br>
The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical composition containing the compounds of the invention disclosed herein. In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a composition comprising compounds of the invention in a pharmaceutical^ acceptable carrier and in an amount effective to modulate, preferably inhibit, ion flux through a voltage-dependent sodium channel to treat sodium channel<br><br>
mediated diseases, such as pain, when administered to an animal, preferably a mammal, most preferably a human patient.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions useful herein also contain a pharmaceutical^ acceptable carrier, including any suitable diluent or excipient, which includes any pharmaceutical agent that does not itself induce the production of antibodies harmful to the individual receiving the composition, and which may be administered without undue toxicity. Pharmaceutical^ acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, liquids, such as water, saline, glycerol and ethanol, and the like. A thorough discussion of pharmaceutical^ acceptable carriers, diluents, and other excipients is presented in REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES (Mack Pub. Co., N.J. current edition).<br>
Those skilled in the art know how to determine suitable doses of the compounds for use in treating the diseases and conditions contemplated herein. Therapeutic doses are generally identified through a dose ranging study in humans based on preliminary evidence derived from animal studies. Doses must be sufficient to result in a desired therapeutic benefit without causing unwanted side effects for the patient.<br>
A typical regimen for treatment of sodium channel-mediated disease comprises administration of an effective amount over a period of one or several days, up to and including between one week and about six months, or it may be chronic. It is understood that the dosage of a diagnostic/pharmaceutical compound or composition of the invention administered in vivo or in vitro will be dependent upon the age, sex, health, and weight of the recipient, severity of the symptons, kind of concurrent treatment, if any, frequency of treatment, the response of the individual, and the nature of the diagnostic/pharmaceutical effect desired. The ranges of effective doses provided herein are not intended to be limiting and represent preferred dose ranges. However, the most preferred dosage will be tailored to the individual subject, as is understood and determinable by one skilled in the relevant arts, (see, e.g., Berkowet al., eds., The Merck Manual, 16th edition, Merck and Co., Rahway, N.J., 1992; Goodmanetna., eds.,Goodman and Cilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 10th edition, Pergamon Press, Inc., Elmsford, N.Y., (2001); Avery's Drug Treatment: Principles and Practice of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, 3rd edition, ADIS Press, LTD., Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, MD. (1987), Ebadi, Pharmacology, Little, Brown and Co., Boston, (1985); Osolci al., eds.,Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th edition, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA (1990);<br><br>
Katzung, Basic and Clinical Pharmacology, Appleton and Lange, Norwalk, CT (1992)).<br>
The total dose required for each treatment can be administered by multiple doses or in a single dose over the course of the day, if desired. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages, which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. The diagnostic pharmaceutical compound or composition can be administered alone or in conjunction with other diagnostics and/or pharmaceuticals directed to the pathology, or directed to other symptoms of the pathology. Effective amounts of a diagnostic pharmaceutical compound or composition of the invention are from about 0.1 jig to about 100 mg/Kg body weight, administered at intervals of 4-72 hours, for a period of 2 hours to 1 year, and/or any range or value therein, such as 0.0001-0.001, 0.001-0.01, 0.01-0.1, 0.1-1.0,1.0-10, 5-10, 10-20, 20-50 and 50-100 mg/Kg, at intervals of 1-4, 4-10, 10-16, 16-24, 24-36, 24-36, 36-48, 48-72 hours, for a period of 1-14, 14-28, or 30-44 days, or 1-24 weeks, or any range or value therein. The recipients of administration of compounds and/or compositions of the invention can be any vertebrate animal, such as mammals. Among mammals, the preferred recipients are mammals of the Orders Primate (including humans, apes and monkeys), Arteriodactyla (including horses, goats, cows, sheep, pigs), Rodenta (including mice, rats, rabbits, and hamsters), and Carnivora (including cats, and dogs). Among birds, the preferred recipients are turkeys, chickens and other members of the same order. The most preferred recipients are humans.<br>
For topical applications, it is preferred to administer an effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention to target area, e.g., skin surfaces, mucous membranes, and the like, which are adjacent to peripheral neurons which are to be treated. This amount will generally range from about 0.0001 mg to about 1 g of a compound of the invention per application, depending upon the area to be treated, whether the use is diagnostic, prophylactic or therapeutic, the severity of the symptoms, and the nature of the topical vehicle employed. A preferred topical preparation is an ointment, wherein about 0.001 to about 50 mg of active ingredient is used per cc of ointment base. The pharmaceutical composition can be be formulated as transdermal compositions or transdermal delivery devices ("patches"). Such compositions include, for example, a backing, active compound reservoir, a control membrane, liner and contact adhesive. Such transdermal patches may be used to provide continuous pulsatile, or on demand delivery of the compounds of the present invention as desired.<br><br>
The composition may be intended for rectal administration, in the form, e.g., of a suppository which will melt in the rectum and release the drug. A typical suppository formulation will generally consist of active ingredient with a binding and/or lubricating agent such as a gelatine or cocoa butter or other low melting vegetable or synthetic wax or fat.<br>
A typical formulation for intramuscular or intrathecal administration will consist of a suspension or solution of active in an oil or solution of active ingredient in an oil, for example arachis oil or seasame oil. A typical formulation for intravenous or intrathecal administration will consist of sterile isotonic aqueous solution containing, for example active ingredient and dextrose or sodium chloride or a mixture of dextrose and sodium chloride.<br>
The compositions of the invention can be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient by employing procedures known in the art. Controlled release drug delivery systems include osmotic pump systems and dissolutional systems containing polymer-coated reservoirs or drug-polymer matrix formulations. Examples of controlled release systems are given in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,845,770 and 4,326,525 and in P. J. Kuzma et al, Regional Anesthesia 22 (6): 543-551 (1997), all of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The compositions of the invention can also be delivered through intra-nasal drug delivery systems for local, systemic, and nose-to-brain medical therapies. Controlled Particle Dispersion (CPD)™ technology, traditional nasal spray bottles, inhalers or nebulizers are known by those skilled in the art to provide effective local and systemic delivery of drugs by targeting the olfactory region and paranasal sinuses.<br>
The invention also relates to an intravaginal shell or core drug delivery device suitable for administration to the human or animal female. The device may be comprised of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in a polymer matrix, surrounded by a sheath, and capable of releasing the compound in a substantially zero order pattern on a daily basis similar to devises used to apply testosterone as desscribed in PCT Patent No. WO 98/50016.<br>
Current methods for ocular delivery include topical administration (eye drops), subconjunctival injections, periocular injections, intravitreal injections, surgical implants and iontophoresis (uses a small electrical current to transport ionized drugs into and through body tissues) Those skilled in the art would combine the best suited excipients with the compound for safe and effective intra-occular administration.<br><br>
The most suitable route will depend on the nature and severity of the condition being treated. Those skilled in the art are also familiar with determining administration methods (oral, intravenous, inhalation, sub-cutaneous, rectal etc.), dosage forms, suitable pharmaceutical excipients and other matters relevant to the delivery of the compounds to a subject in need thereof.<br>

In general, the compounds of formula (I) of the invention where Q is -0-, j is 0 and k is 1 can be synthesized following the general procedure as described below in REACTION SCHEME 1. As set forth below, an isatin compound of formula (101) is alkylated with the chloro or bromo compound of formula (102) to afford the product of formula (103). The phenol compound of formula (104) is treated with a Grignard reagent of formula (105) at low temperature (0 °C) to form the phenoxymagnesium halide intermediate which reacts with the keto-carbonyl group of the isatin compound of formula (103) in a solvent, such as, but not limited to, methylene chloride or toluene, to afford the oxindole of formula (106). The compound of formula (107) is obtained after the removal of the hydroxyl group at C-3 position of the oxindole by treating the compound of formula (106) with silane such as triethylsilane. The compound of formula (107) can also be achieved by treating the compound of formula (106) with SOCI2/NEt3 then reduction with Zn dust. Compound of formula (107) is treated with a silyl compound, such as, but not limited to, trimethylsilyl chloride, to generate the silyl ether intermediate which is treated with ytterbium (III) trifluoromethanesulfonate and formaldehyde to afford the compound of formula (108). Alternatively, compound of formula (108) can be obtained by treating the compound of formula (107) with a base, such as, but not limited to, LiOH, iPr2NH, LDA, and subsequently reacting with formaldehyde. Intramolecular cyclization via Mitsunobu reaction affords the compound of formula (I) of the invention where Q is -0-, j is 0 and k is 1.<br><br><br>
REACTION SCHEME 1.1 below illustrates a schematic synthesis of amide and heterocyclic compounds as compounds of formula (I). When R1 consists of an ester group, a compound such as a compound of formula (109) (in which A is alkyl or aralkyl) can be converted to the corresponding carboxylic acid compound of formula (110) by treatment of a compound of formula (109) with a base such as, but not limited<br><br>
to, lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, in a mixed solvent such as, but not limited to, tetrahydrofuran or methanol with water. The acid compound of formula (110) can be converted to a mixed anhydride, by treatment with iso-butyl chloroformate in the presence of a base such as, but not limited to, N-methylmorpholine, or to the corresponding acid chloride, by treament with oxalyl chloride in the presence of catalytic amount of A/,A/-dimethylformamide in a solvent such as, but not limited to, toluene, dichloromethane or chloroform. The mixed anhydride can react directly with, or the acid chloride can react with, in the presence of a base such as, but not limited to, triethylamine or diisopropyl ethylamine, a primary or secondary amine to form the amide compound of formula (111) as a compound of formula (I). The acid compound of formula (110) can react with an aromatic diamine compound in a solvent such as, but not limited to, toluene to form the benzimidazole compound of formula (111.1) as a compound of formula (I).<br><br><br>
compounds as compounds of formula (I). From compound (112), after removal of the protecting group (PG) such as, but not limited to, phthalimido or tert-butyloxycarbonyl, either the primary or secondary amino compound of formula (113) can be formed. Reaction of the amino compound of formula (113) with an acyl chloride in the presence of a base such as, but not limited to, triethylamine or diisopropyl ethylamine, in a solvent such as, but not limited to, toluene, dichloromethane or chloroform provides the amide compound of formula (114) as a compound of formula (I). Treatment of amino compound of formula (113) with an isocyanate in the presence of a base such as, but not limited to, triethylamine or diisopropyl ethylamine, in a solvent such as, but not limited to, dichloromethane or chloroform leads to the formation of the urea compound of formula (115) as a compound of formula (I). When the primary or secondary amino compound of formula (113) is treated with an aldehyde or a ketone in the presence of a reducing agent such as, but not limited to, sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride, in a solvent such as, but not limited to, dichloromethane, a high order functionalized amine (116) is produced as a compound of formula (I).<br><br><br>
REACTION SCHEME 1.3 below illustrates a schematic synthesis of amine compounds as compounds of formula (i). The alcohol compound of formula (118), upon removal of the protecting group in compound of formula (117), can be oxidized to the aldehyde compound of (119) by using an oxidant such as, but not limited to, pyridinium dichromate or Dess-Martin's reagent. Similarly to the transformation of the compound of formula (113) to the compound of formula (116) as illustrated in REACTION SCHEME 1.2, the amine compound of formula (120) can be obtained as a<br><br>
compound of formula (I) through the reductive amination of the aldehyde compound of formula (119) with a primary or secondary amine.<br>
REACTION SCHEME 1.3<br><br>
REACTION SCHEME 1.4 below illustrates an alternative synthesis of compounds of formula (I) with the introduction of a variety of R1 groups. Compound of formula (121) where PG is a protecting group such as, but not limited to, diphenylmethyl, can be synthesized through the sequence as shown in REACTION SCHEME 1 above. The protecting group can be removed under a high pressure of hydrogen such as 60 psi to form the oxindole compound of formula (122). The formation of a compound of formula (I) can be achieved by alkylation of the compound of formula (122) with a halide reagent XR1 (where X is chloro, bromo or iodo) in the presence of a base such as, but not limited to, sodium hydride, sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, and lithium hydroxide, in a solvent such as, but not limited to, /V,/V-dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, acetone or acetonitrile. Alternatively, reaction of compound of formula (122) with an alcohol under Mitsunobu reaction conditions in the presence of a phosphine reagent such as, but not limited to,<br><br>
triphenylphosphine, tributylphosphine ortrimethyl phosphine, and azadicarboxylate of diethyl, diisopropyl or di-terf-butyl in a solvent such as, but not limited to, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate or dichloromethane, provides the compound of formula (I). Alternatively, treatment of compound of formula (122) with a base such as, but not limited to, sodium hydride or lithium hydroxide, followed by reacting with an acyl chloride or anhydride, or with a sulfonyl chloride reagent, provides the corresponding acyl or sulfonyl (R1) compound of formula (I) respectively.<br><br>

BIOLOGICAL ASSAYS Various techniques are known in the art for testing the activity of compounds of the invention. In order that the invention described herein may be more fully understood, the following biological assays are set forth. It should be understood that these examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not to be construed as<br><br>
limiting this invention in any manner.<br>
BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLE 1 Guanidine influx Assay {in vitro assay)<br>
This example describes an in vitro assay for testing and profiling test agents against human or rat sodium channels stably expressed in cells of either an endogenous or recombinant origin. The assay is also useful for determining the IC-50 of a sodium channel blocking compound. The assay is based on the guanidine flux assay described by Reddy, N.L, etal., J Med Chem (1998), 41(17):3298-302.<br>
The guanidine influx assay is a radiotracer flux assay used to determine ion flux activity of sodium channels in a high-throughput microplate-based format. The assay uses 14C-guanidine hydrochloride in combination with various known sodium channel modulators, to assay the potency of test agents. Potency is determined by an IC-50 calculation. Selectivity is determined by comparing potency of the compound for the channel of interest to its potency against other sodium channels (also called 'selectivity profiling').<br>
Each of the test agents is assayed against cells that express the channels of interest. Voltage gated sodium channels are either TTX sensitive or insensitive. This property is useful when evaluating the activities of a channel of interest when it resides in a mixed population with other sodium channels. The following Table 1 summarizes cell lines useful in screening for a certain channel activity in the presence or absence of TTX.<br><br><br>
It is also possible to employ recombinant cells expressing these sodium channels. Cloning and propagation of recombinant cells are known to those skilled in the art (see, for example, Klugbauer, N, et al., EMBO J. (1995), 14(6):1084-90; and Lossin, C, et al., Neuron (2002), 34, pp. 877-884)<br>
Cells expressing the channel of interest are grown according to the supplier or in the case of a recombinant cell in the presence of selective growth media such as G418 (Gibco/lnvitrogen). The cells are disassociated from the culture dishes with an enzymatic solution (1X) Trypsin/EDTA (Gibco/lnvitrogen) and analyzed for density and<br><br>
viability using haemocytometer (Neubauer). Disassociated cells are washed and resuspended in their culture media then plated into Scintiplates (Beckman Coulter Inc.) (approximately 100,000 ceils/ well) and incubated at 37 °C/5 % C02. for 20-24 hours. After an extensive wash with Low sodium HEPES-buffered saline solution (LNHBSS) (150 mM Choline Chloride, 20 nM HEPES (Sigma), 1mM Calcium Chloride, 5mM Potassium Chloride, 1 mM Magnesium Chloride, 10 mM Glucose) agents diluted with LNHBSS are added to each well. (Varying concentrations of test agent may be used). The activation/radiolabel mixture contains aconitine (Sigma), and 14C-guanidine hydrochloride (ARC).<br>
After loading the cells with test agent and activation/radiolabel mixture, the Scintiplates are incubated at ambient temperature. Following the incubation, the Scintplates are extensively washed with LNHBSS supplemented with guanidine (Sigma). The Scintiplates are dried and then counted using a Wallac MicroBeta TriLux (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences). The ability of the test agent to block sodium channel activity is determined by comparing the amount of 14C-guanidine present inside the cells expressing the different sodium channels. Based on this data, a variety of calculations, as set out elsewhere in this specification, may be used to determine whether a test agent is selective for a particular sodium channel.<br>
IC-50 value of a test agent for a specific sodium channel may be determined using the above general method. IC-50 may be determined using a 3, 8, 10, 12 or 16 point curve in duplicate or triplicate with a starting concentration of 1, 5 or 10|jM diluted serially with a final concentration reaching the sub-nanomolar, nanomolar and low micromolar ranges. Typically the mid-point concentration of test agent is set at 1 pM, and sequential concentrations of half dilutions greater or smaller are applied (e.g. 0.5 pM; 5 pM and 0.25 pM; 10 |jM and 0.125 pM; 20 |JM etc.). The IC-50 curve is calculated using the 4 Parameter Logistic Model or Sigmoidal Dose-Response Model formula (fit = (A+((B-A)/(1+((C/x)AD)))).<br>
The fold selectivity, factor of selectivity or multiple of selectivity, is calculated by dividing the IC-50 value of the test sodium channel by the reference sodium channel, for example, Na/I.5.<br>
BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLE 2 Electrophysiological Assay (In vitro assay) Cells expressing the channel of interest were cultured in DMEM growth media<br><br>
(Gibco) with 0.5mg/mL G418, +M% PSG, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37C° and 5% C02. For electrophysiological recordings, ceils were plated on 10mm dishes.<br>
Whole cell recordings were examined by established methods of whole cell voltage clamp (Bean et al., op. cit.) using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and Clampex software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). All experiments were performed at ambient temperature. Electrodes were fire-polished to resistances of 2-4 Mohms Voltage errors and capacitance artifacts were minimized by series resistance compensation and capacitance compensation, respectively. Data were acquired at 40 kHz and filtered at 5 kHz. The external (bath) solution consisted of: NaCI (140 mM), KCI (5 mM), CaCI2 (2 mM), MgCI2 (1 mM), HEPES (10 mM) at pH 7.4. The internal (pipette) solution consisted of (in mM): NaCI (5), CaCI2 (0.1) MgCI2 (2), CsCI (10), CsF (120), HEPES (10), EGTA (10), at pH 7.2.<br>
To estimate the steady-state affinity of compounds for the resting and inactivated state of the channel (Kr and Kh respectively), 12.5 ms test pulses to depolarizing voltages from -60 to +90 m V from a holding potential of -110 m V was used to construct current-voltage relationships (\-V curves). A voltage near the peak of the IV-curve (-30 to 0 mV) was used as the test pulse throughout the remainder of the experiment. Steady-state inactivation (availability) curves were then constructed by measuring the current activated during a 8.75 ms test pulse following 1 second conditioning pulses to potentials ranging from -110 to -10 m V. To monitor channels at steady-state, a single "diary" protocol with a holding potential of —110m\/was created to record the resting state current (10ms test pulse), the current after fast inactivation (5 ms pre-pulse of-80 to-50 mVfollowed by a 10 mstest pulse), and the current during various holding potentials (35 ms ramp to test pulse levels). Compounds were applied during the "diary" protocol and the block was monitored at 15 s intervals.<br>
After the compounds equilibrated, the voltage-dependence of the steady-state inactivation in the presence of the compound was determined. Compounds that block the resting state of the channel decreased the current elicited during test pulses from all holding potentials, whereas compounds that primarily blocked the inactivated state decreased the current elicited during test pulses at more depolarized potentials. The currents at the resting state (lrest) and the currents during the inactivated state (Iinactivated) were used to calculate steady-state affinity of compounds. Based on the Michaelis-Menton model of inhibition, the Kr and K, was calculated as the concentration of compound needed to cause 50% inhibition of the lrest or the I inactivated, respectively.<br><br>
% inhibition     =	Vmg/TDruglh<br>
[Drug]h + Kmh<br>
Vmax is the rate of inhibition, h is the Hill coefficient (for interacting sites), Km is Michaelis-Menten constant, and [Drug] is the concentration of the test compound. At 50% inhibition (!4Vmax) of the lrest or linactivated, the drug concentration is numerically equal to Km and approximates the Kr and Ki, respectively.<br>
BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLE 3 Analgesia Induced by sodium channel Blockers Heat Induced Tail Flick Latency Test<br>
In this test, the analgesia effect produced by administering a compound of the invention was observed through heat-induced tail-flick in mice. The test includes a heat source consisting of a projector lamp with a light beam focused and directed to a point on the tail of a mouse being tested. The tail-flick latencies, which were assessed prior to drug treatment, and in response to a noxious heat stimulus, i.e., the response time from applying radiant heat on the dorsal surface of the tail to the occurrence of tail flick, were measured and recorded at 40, 80, 120, and 160 minutes.<br>
For the first part of this study, 65 animals underwent assessment of baseline tail flick latency once a day over two consecutive days. These animals were then randomly assigned to one of the 11 different treatment groups including a vehicle control, a morphine control, and 9 compounds at 30 mg/kg were administered intramuscularly.  Following dose administration, the animals were closely monitored for signs of toxicity including tremor or seizure, hyperactivity, shallow, rapid or depressed breathing and failure to groom. The optimal incubation time for each compound was determined via regression analysis. The analgesic activity of the test compounds was expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible effect (%MPE) and was calculated using the following formula:<br>
Postdrug latency - Predrug latency<br>
% MPE        	 X 100%<br>
Cut-off time (10 s)- Predrug latency<br>
where:<br><br>
Postdrug latency= the latency time for each individual animal taken before the tail is removed (flicked) from the heat source after receiving drug.<br>
Predrug latency= the latency time for each individual animal taken before the tail is flicked from the heat source prior to receiving drug.<br>
Cut-off time (10 s)= is the maximum exposure to the heat source. Acute Pain (Formalin Test)<br>
The formalin test is used as an animal model of acute pain. In the formalin test, animals were briefly habituated to the plexiglass test chamber on the day prior to experimental day for 20 minutes. On the test day, animals were randomly injected with the test articles. At 30 minutes after drug administration, 50 jiL of 10% formalin was injected subcutaneously into the plantar surface of the left hind paw of the rats. Video data acquisition began immediately after formalin administration, for duration of 90 minutes.<br>
The images were captured using the Actimetrix Limelight software which stores files under the Mlii extension, and then converts it into the MPEG-4 coding. The videos are then analyzed using behaviour analysis software "The Observer 5.1", (Version 5.0, Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, The Netherlands). The video analysis was done by watching the animal behaviour and scoring each according to type, and defining the length of the behaviour (Dubuisson and Dennis, 1977). Scored behaviours include: (1) normal behaviour, (2) putting no weight on the paw, (3) raising the paw, (4) licking/biting or scratching the paw. Elevation, favoring, or excessive licking, biting and scratching of the injected paw indicate a pain response. Analgesic response or protection from compounds is indicated if both paws are resting on the floor with no obvious favoring, excessive licking, biting or scratching of the injected paw.<br>
Analysis of the formalin test data is done according to two factors: (1) Percent Maximal Potential Inhibitory Effect (%MPIE) and (2) pain score. The %MPIEs was calculated by a series of steps, where the first is to sum the length of non-normal behaviours (behaviours 1,2,3) of each animal. A single value for the vehicle group was obtained by averaging all scores within the vehicle treatment group. The following calculation yields the MPIE value for each animal:<br>
MPIE (%) = 100 - [ (treatment sum/average vehicle value) X 100% ]<br>
The pain score is calculated from a weighted scale as described above. The<br><br>
duration of the behaviour is multiplied by the weight (rating of the severity of the response), and divided by the total length of observation to determine a pain rating for each animal. The calculation is represented by the following formula:<br>
Pain rating = [ 0(To) + 1(T1) + 2(T2) + 3(T3) ] / ( To + T1 + T2 + T3 )<br>
Compounds of the present invention were shown to be efficacious within a range of 30 mg/kg and 0.1mg/kg. CFA Induced Chronic Inflammatory Pain<br>
In this test, tactile allodynia was assessed with calibrated von Frey filaments. Following a full week of acclimatization to the vivarium facility, 150 \iL of the "Complete Freund's Adjuvant" (CFA) emulsion (CFA suspended in an oil/saline (1:1) emulsion at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL) was injected subcutaneously into the plantar surface of the left hind paw of rats under light isoflurane anaesthesia. Animals were allowed to recover from the anaesthesia and the baseline thermal and mechanical nociceptive thresholds of all animals are assessed one week after the administration of CFA. All animals were habituated to the experimental equipment for 20 minutes on the day prior to the start of the experiment. The test and control articles were administrated to the animals, and the nociceptive thresholds measured at defined time points after drug administration to determine the analgesic responses to each of the six available treatments. The time points used were previously determined to show the highest analgesic effect for each test compound.<br>
Thermal nociceptive thresholds of the animals were assessed using the Hargreaves test. Animals were placed in a Plexiglas enclosure set on top of an elevated glass platform with heating units. The glass platform is thermostatically controlled at a temperature of approximately 30 °C for all test trials. Animals were allowed to accommodate for 20 minutes following placement into the enclosure until all exploration behaviour ceases. The Model 226 Plantar/Tail Stimulator Analgesia Meter (IITC, Woodland Hills, CA) was used to apply a radiant heat beam from underneath the glass platform to the plantar surface of the hind paws. During all test trials, the idle intensity and active intensity of the heat source were set at 1 and 45 respectively, and a cut off time of 20 seconds was employed to prevent tissue damage.<br>
The response thresholds of animals to tactile stimuli were measured using the Model 2290 Electrovonfrey anesthesiometer (IITC Life Science, Woodland Hills, CA) following the Hargreaves test. Animals were placed in an elevated Plexiglas enclosure set on a mire mesh surface. After 10 minutes of accommodation, pre-calibrated Von<br><br>
Frey hairs were applied perpendicularly to the plantar surface of both paws of the animals in an ascending order starting from the 0.1 g hair, with sufficient force to cause slight buckling of the hair against the paw. Testing continues until the hair with the lowest force to induce a rapid flicking of the paw is determined or when the cut off force of approximately 20 g is reached. This cut off force was used because it represent approximately 10% of the animals' body weight and it serves to prevent raising of the entire limb due to the use of stiffer hairs, which would change the nature of the stimulus. The compounds of the present invention were shown to be efficacious within a range of 30 mg/Kg and 0.1 mg/Kg. Postoperative Models of Nociception<br>
In this model, the hypealgesia caused by an intra-planar incision in the paw is measured by applying increased tactile stimuli to the paw until the animal withdraws its paw from the applied stimuli. While animals were anaesthetized under 3.5% isofluorane, which was delivered via a nose cone, a 1 cm longitudinal incision was made using a number 10 scalpel blade in the plantar aspect of the left hind paw through the skin and fascia, starting 0.5 cm from the proximal edge of the heel and extending towards the toes. Following the incision, the skin was apposed using 2, 3-0 sterilized silk sutures. The injured site was covered with Polysporin and Betadine. Animals were returned to their home cage for overnight recovery.<br>
The withdrawal thresholds of animals to tactile stimuli for both operated (ipsilateral) and unoperated (contralateral) paws can be measured using the Model 2290 Electrovonfrey anesthesiometer (IITC Life Science, Woodland Hills, CA). Animals were placed in an elevated Plexiglas enclosure set on a mire mesh surface. After at least 10 minutes of acclimatization, pre-calibrated Von Frey hairs were applied perpendicularly to the plantar surface of both paws of the animals in an ascending order starting from the 10 g hair, with sufficient force to cause slight buckling of the hair against the paw. Testing continued until the hair with the lowest force to induce a rapid flicking of the paw is determined or when the cut off force of approximately 20 g is reached. This cut off force is used because it represent approximately 10% of the animals' body weight and it serves to prevent raising of the entire limb due to the use of stiffer hairs, which would change the nature of the stimulus.<br>
Compounds of the present invention were shown to be efficacious within a range of 30 mg/Kg and 0.1 mg/Kg. Neuropathic pain model; Chronic Constriction Injury<br>
Briefly, an approximately 3 cm incision was made through the skin and the<br><br>
fascia at the mid thigh level of the animals' left hind leg using a no. 10 scalpel blade. The left sciatic nerve was exposed via blunt dissection through the biceps femoris with care to minimize haemorrhagia. Four loose ligatures were tied along the sciatic nerve using 4-0 non-degradable sterilized silk sutures at intervals of 1 to 2 mm apart. The tension of the loose ligatures was tight enough to induce slight constriction of the sciatic nerve when viewed under a dissection microscope at a magnification of 4 fold. In the sham-operated animal, the left sciatic nerve was exposed without further manipulation. Antibacterial ointment was applied directly into the wound, and the muscle was closed using sterilized sutures. Betadine was applied onto the muscle and its surroundings, followed by skin closure with surgical clips.<br>
The response thresholds of animals to tactile stimuli were measured using the Model 2290 Electrovonfrey anesthesiometer (IITC Life Science, Woodland Hills, CA).

Following the measurement of tactile thresholds, animals were placed in a Plexiglass enclosure set on top of an elevated glass platform with heating units. The glass platform is thermostatically controlled at a temperature of approximately 24 to 26 °C for all test trials. Animals were allowed to accommodate for 10 minutes following placement into the enclosure until all exploration behaviour ceases. The Model 226 Plantar/ Tail Stimulator Analgesia Meter (IITC, Woodland Hills, CA) was used to apply a radiant heat beam from underneath the glass platform to the plantar surface of the hind paws. During all test trials, the idle intensity and active intensity of the heat source were set at 1 and 55 respectively, and a cut off time of 20 seconds was used to prevent tissue damage.<br><br>
BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLE 4 Aconitine Induced Arrhythmia Test<br>
The antiarrhythmic activity of compounds of the invention is demonstrated by the following test. Arrhythmia was provoked by intravenous administration of aconitine(2.0|jg/Kg) dissolved in physiological saline solution. Test compounds of the invention were intravenously administered 5 minutes after the administration of aconitine. Evaluation of the anti-arrhythmic activity was conducted by measuring the time from the aconitine administration to the occurrence of extrasystole (ES) and the time from the aconitine administration to the occurrence of ventricular tachycardia (VT).<br>
In rates under isoflurane anaesthesia (1/4 to 1/3 of 2%), a tracheotomy was performed by first creating an incision in the neck area, then isolating the trachea and making a 2 mm incision to insert tracheal tube 2 cm into the trachea such that the opening of the tube was positioned just on top of the mouth. The tubing was secured with sutures and attached to a ventilator for the duration of the experiment.<br>
Incisions (2.5 cm) were then made into the femoral areas and using a blunt dissection probe, the femoral vessels were isolated. Both femoral veins were cannulated, one for pentobarbital anaesthetic maintenance (0.02-0.05 mL) and one for the infusion and injection of drug and vehicle. The femoral artery was cannulated with the blood pressure gel catheter of the transmitter.<br>
The ECG leads were attached to the thoracic muscle in the Lead II position (upper right/above heart - white lead and lower left/below heart - red lead). The leads were secured with sutures.<br>
All surgical areas were covered with gauze moistened with 0.9% saline. Saline (1-1.5 mL of a 0.9% solution) was supplied to moisten the areas post-surgery. The animals' ECG and ventillation were allowed to equilibrate for at least 30 minutes.<br>
The arrhythmia was induced with a 2 jag/Kg/min aconitine infusion for 5 minutes. During this time the ECG was recorded and continuously monitoired. An intravenous bolus injection of a test compound of the invention (10, 30 or 100 f-ig/kg) resulted in a complete return to normal baseline ECG.<br>
Accordingly, compounds of the invention, when tested in this model, demonstrated anti-arrhythmia activity.<br>
BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLE 5 Ischemia Induced Arrhythmia Test Rodent models of ventricular arrhythmias, in both acute cardioversion and<br><br>
prevention paradigms have been employed in testing potential therapeutics for both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias in humans. Cardiac ischemia leading to myocardial infarction is a common cause of morbidity and mortality. The ability of a compound to prevent ischemia-induced ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation is an accepted model for determining the efficacy of a compound in a clinical setting for both atrial and ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.<br>
Anaesthesia is first induced by pentobarbital (i.p.), and maintained by an i.v. bolus infusion. Male SD rats have their trachea cannulated for artificial ventilation with room air at a stroke volume of 10 ml/Kg, 60 strokes/minute. The right femoral artery and vein are cannulated with PE50 tubing for mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) recording and intravenous administration of compounds, respectively.<br>
The chest was opened between the 4th and 5th ribs to create a 1.5 cm opening such that the heart was visible. Each rat was placed on a notched platform and metal restraints were hooked onto the rib cage opening the chest cavity. A suture needle was used to penetrate the ventricle just under the lifted atrium and exited the ventricle in a downward diagonal direction so that a &gt;30% to 
Electrodes were placed in the Lead II position (right atrium to apex) for ECG measurement as follows: one electrode inserted into the right forepaw and the other electrode inserted into the left hind paw.<br>
The body temperature, MAP, ECG, and heart rate were constantly recorded throughout the experiment. Once the critical parameters had stabilized, a 1-2 minute recording was taken to establish the baseline values. Infusion of a compound of the invention or control substance was initiated once baseline values were established. After a 5-minute infusion of compound or control, the suture was pulled tight to ligate the LCA and create ischemia in the left ventricle. The critical parameters were recorded continuously for 20 minutes after ligation, unless the MAP reached the critical level of 20-30 mmHg for at least 3 minutes, in which case the recording was stopped because the animal would be declared deceased and was then sacrificed. The ability of compounds of the invention to prevent arrhythmias and sustain near-normal MAP and HR was scored and compared to control.<br>
Compound of the invention, when tested in this model, demonstatrated the<br><br>
ability to prevent ischemia-induced ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.<br>
