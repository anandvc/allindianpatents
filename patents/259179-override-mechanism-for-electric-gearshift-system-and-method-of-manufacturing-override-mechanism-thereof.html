PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following complete specification particularly describes the invention and<br>
the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to electric gear shift system used in vehicles and more particularly it relates to override mechanism used for electric gearshift systems with CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission).<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
The automotive vehicles typically employ a driver-operated mechanical gearshift assembly which controls the transmission. Such shifters generally employ a shift lever which is moved by hand between various gear settings (Forward, Neutral &amp; Reverse). While such systems are widely used and some of the drawbacks associated with the said system are:<br>
1.	Effort required in shifting the gear is more<br>
2.	Wear and tear of the components is high<br>
3.	Very difficult to accommodate safety interlocks<br>
Above said drawbacks can be addressed by an electric gearshift system. Electric gearshift system is an electro-mechanical system comprising gearbox, gearshift switch, electronic control unit (ECU), actuator, gear display unit, gearshift lever, battery, gear position sensor, vehicle speed sensor, engine speed sensor and brake switch. When driver operates the gearshift switch, the commanded signal goes to the ECU and based on other inputs like gear position feedback signal, vehicle speed signal, engine speed signal and brake switch signal, the ECU commands the actuator to rotate in clockwise or anti-clockwise direction so as to engage the gear in forward, neutral or reverse position.<br><br><br><br><br>
US 5,934,432 (D1) relates to an actuator system utilizing an electric motor controlled actuator and having a pressurized fluid-operated override mechanism for effecting rapid clutch movements not requiring precise control. Dl also have solenoid-controlled pneumatic override actuator for rapidly disengaging the clutch and/or for moving the clutch from a fully disengaged position to the touch point of incipient engagement whereas the present invention discloses an override mechanism for electric gearshift system which facilitates the vehicle movement in case of failure of electric gearshift system. The present invention does not use pressurized fluid or hydraulic fluid for working of override mechanism for electric gearshift system. The constructional features and arrangement of different component of the present invention is totally different from D1.<br>
US 4,282,780 (D2) discloses an electric transmission control apparatus in which the shift pattern is controlled in accordance with various loads given to the prime engine. The automatic transmission unit (14) is provided with 1-2 shift solenoid (13) for selectively conducting the shift operation between first and second forward speed ranges under the drive range of the transmission (14) [mention in colum-2 at para. 2] whereas the present invention provide override mechanism for electric gearshift system which facilitates the vehicle movement in case of failure of electric gearshift system. The override mechanism is connected to gear shaft through its connecting end and one end of the torsion means is fixed to the gear box casing after preloading and gear shift lever is engaged with actuator gear of electric gear shift system. But in D2, transmission unit (14) is coupled to combustion engine of the vehicle and is provided with a manual shift lever. The components and arrangement of different components of D2 is totally different from the present invention.<br><br>
The drawback with said electric gearshift systems is the potential loss of transmission control when there is a failure of electric gearshift system. That is, the operator could lose the ability to shift gears. This could cause the inability to even shift the vehicle into forward gear in order to enable the vehicle to be moved to the nearby service station for repair.<br>
In order to overcome the above said drawback, this invention is devised.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
The main object of this invention is to provide an override mechanism for electric gearshift system which facilitates the vehicle movement in case of failure of electric gearshift system.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide method of overriding during failure of electric gearshift system.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide an override mechanism for electric gearshift system which is simple in construction, ease for operation and cost effective.<br>

Override mechanism for electric gearshift system comprises of pre loaded compression means, pre loaded torsion means, gearshift lever, gearshift shaft, locking means for gear shift lever, stopper for gear shift lever and plurality of washers, wherein said torsion means is provided on said gear shift shaft at connecting end to gear shaft, one end of said torsion means is adopted to be fixed to gear box casing and other end is fixed to gear shift shaft through first washer,<br><br>
said gear shift shaft is provided with second washer adjacent to said torsion means towards connecting end to gear shaft to prevent sliding off of said torsion means, said compression means is provided on said gear shift shaft and placed adjacent to said first washer, said gear shift lever adopted to be meshed with actuator gear is provided on said gear shift shaft adjacent to said compression means with a provision of locking and unlocking on said gear shift shaft, said gear shift shaft is provided with a stopping means to prevent the sliding away of said gear shift lever.<br>
