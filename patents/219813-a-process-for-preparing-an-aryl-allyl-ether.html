PROCESS FOR PREPARING ARYL ALLYL ETHERS<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing aryl allyl ether compounds by reacting a phenolic compound with an allylating agent in the presence of a transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst complexed with a strongly bonded, non-replaceable stable ligand.  The ligand of the transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst complex may be (i) an olefinic-containing ligand or an aromatic-containing ligand; or (ii) a polymeric ligand or a heteroatom-containing multidentate ligand.  Aryl allyl ether compounds are useful in preparing epoxy-containing comp'.iunds.<br>
A well-known industrial process for producing epoxy resins on a large commercial scale is a process comprising the steps of:<br>
(I)	reacting an active hydrogen-containing compound<br>
such as an alcohol, a phenol, a thiol, a carboxylic acid, or<br>
an amine with an epihalohydrin, such as epichlorohydrin {ECH}<br>
or epibromohydrin, to make an a-halohydrin as a reactive-<br>
intermediate; and<br>
(II)	converting the a-halohydrin intermediate of<br>
Step (I) into a glycidyl ether, glycidyl thioether, glycidyl<br>
ester, or glycidyl amine under basic reaction conditiony.<br>
The most widely made and particularly useful epoxy resin is bisphenol A (bis A) epoxy resin which is made by first conducting a coupling reaction of bis P^  and ECH to form a bis(a-chlorohydrin) intermediate (generally described in Step (I) above); and then, converting the bis A bis(a-chlorohydrin) intermediate to a bis A diglycidyl ether epoxy resin in an epoxide ring-forming dehydrochlorination reaction with a base (generally described in Step II above) .  Such a two-step process for making an epoxy resin from ECH is described by H. Lee and K. Neville in Handbook of Epoxy<br><br>
Resins, McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York, New York, 1982, Reissue, 2-3 to 2-4.<br>
The above two-step process of coupling bis A and ECH followed by epoxide ring-forming dehydrochlorination has also previously been combined into a single-step reaction, wherein the bis (a-chlorohydrin) intermediate of bis A is generated in  situ  and converted into an a bis A diglycidyl ether epoxy resin simultaneously.  Such a single-step process for making bis A epoxy resin is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,499,255; 4,778,863; and 5,028,686.<br>
Although ECH is an important coimnercial product for making the a-chlorohydrin intermediates for bis A epoxy resins, and epoxy resins in general, ECH provides a chlorine-intensive route to producing epoxy resins .  In the predominate commercial process for making ECH, ECH is made from allyl chloride, and allyl chloride is made from thermal chlorination of propylene using chlorine gas, a process that produces chlorinated by-products.  Generally, chlorinated byproducts are treated as waste material.<br>
Additionally, ECH provides a process water-intensive route to producing epoxy resins.  A large amount of process water is used in the reaction of allyl chloride with additional chlorine to make the ECH intermediate, propylene dichlorohydrin intermediate.  This process water must eventually be treated as waste.<br>
Therefore, from an environmental standpoint, there is a desire to replace the use of ECH in the production of epoxy resin; and thus, reduce Che consumption of chlorine and reduce the generation of chlorinated by-products and reduce the generation of waste water in the production of epoxy resin.<br>
In addition, epoxy resins made from ECH may have a high organic chloride content which may be deemed as<br><br>
undesirable in some applications, for example, in electronic applications.<br>
Because of the aforementioned disadvantages in using ECH for manufacturing epoxy resins, it is desired to provide a nbn-ECH process for making epoxy resins.  That is, it is desired to provide an alternative epoxy resin route, that is,   an alternative process without using ECH for manufacturing epoxy resins such as bis A epoxy resin.<br>
One non-ECH process as an alternative to the conventional ECH process is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,578,'740.  The process described in U.S. Patent No. 5,578,740 includes a process to make an epoxy resin comprising the steps of:<br>
(1)	providing an allylation reagent which is substantially halogen-free and which reacts with a hydroxyl, a thiol, a carboxylic acid, or amine group to form an allyl ether, allyl thioether, allyl ester or allyl amine, respectively;<br>
(2)	allylating one or more compounds containing at least one active hydrogen atom using the allylation reagent from Step (1) , whereby allyl ether, allyl thioether, allyl ester or allyl amine compound is formed; and<br>
(3)	converting the allyl groups present in the compound from Step (2) to epoxide groups, whereby a glycidyl ether, glycidyl thioether, glycidyl ester or glycidyl amine compound is formed.<br>
More specifically, the efficient, high yield production of epoxy-containing compounds, in three steps starting from the basic raw material, propylene is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,578,740.  While the process of U.S. Patent No. 5,578,740 describes a three-step process for production of epoxy containing compounds starting from propylene, other prior art processes involve four or more<br><br>
steps starting from the basic raw material propylene.  The three-stap process of U.S. Patent No. 5,578,740 utilizing propylene may be summarized as follows:<br>
(1)	Propylene + oxygen + acetic acid + catalyst —&gt; allyl acetate (allylation reagent);<br>
(2)	Allyl acetate + active hydrogen-containing compound such as bisphenol A —^ diallyl derivative of active<br>
hydrogen-containing compound, such as the diallyl ether of bisphenol A; and<br>
(3)	Diallyl derivative of active hydrogen-<br>
containing compound + peroxy oxidant —&gt; diglycidyl<br>
derivative of active hydrogen-containing compound, such as the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A.<br>
When compared with the aforementioned well-known industrial process for producing epoxy resins, the process of U.S. Patent No. 5,578,740 to make epoxy resins has the following advantages; fewer process steps are required when starting with propylene; a non-halogen process is used, thus, there are no halogenated by-products associated with production of epichlorohydrin to be treated as waste and there are no halogenated contaminants, or by-products, to adversely impact the properties of the resulting epoxy resin; and there are no large ainounts of process water associated with the production of epichlorohydrin to be treated as waste.<br>
Step (1) of the process described in U.S. Patent Wo. 5,578,740 provides for an allylation reagent which is substantially halogen-free and which reacts with a hydroxyl, a thiol, a carboxylic acid, or an amine group to form an allyl echer, allyl thioether, allyl ester or allyl amine, respectively.  Such allylation reagents generally fall into one of two types: (a) allyl esters, methallyl esters, or<br><br>
higher substituted allyl esters of carboxylic acids; and (b) allyl carbonates, raethallyl carbonates, or higher substituted allyl carbonates.  The carbonates may be symmetrical such as diallyl carbonate, but are more generally mixed carbonates such as allyl methyl carbonate.<br>
Step (2) of the process described in U.S. Patent No. 5,578,740 provides for allylating one or more compounds containing at least one  active hydrogen atom using the allylation reagent from Step (1), whereby an allyl ether, allyl thioether, allyl ester, or allyl amine compound is formed.  The allylation process of Step (2) is generally carried out in the presence of a transition metal catalyst and optionally with a basic acting compound which is present in catalytic to greater than stoichiometric amounts.  The conditions for the allylation reaction are generally dependent on. the type of the allylation reagent being used, in the allylation reaction.<br>
Allylation of active hydrogen-containing compounds with type (a) allylation reagents including allyl escers, methallyl esters, or higher substituted allyl esters of carboxylic acids, is carried out in the presence of a transition metal catalyst and usually in the presence of a basic acting material.  For example, the allylation of the active hydrogen-containing compound methanol with a substituted allyl acetate allylation reagent with molybdenum and tungsten catalysts has been reported by .^. V. Malkov, et. al, in J. Org. Chem., 64, pp. 2737-2750, (1999).  The allylation of active hydrogen-containing thiol compounds with allyl acetate using ruthenium catalysts is discussed by T. A. Mitsudo, et. al, in J. Am. Chem. Soc, 121, (37), pp. 8557-8658, (1999).  The allylation of the active hydrogen-containing compound phenol with the allylation reagent allyl acetate with palladium catalysts has been reported, for example, by K.. Ta&gt;:ahashi, et. al, in Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan, _4^, pp. 230-236, (1972) and by J. Muzart, et. al, in J^<br><br>
Organomet. Chem., 3^, pp. C23-C28, (1987).  in these last two cited references, the palladium catalyst efficiencies (catalyst efficiency is defined as turn over number, "TON") calculated on a per hour basis are extremely low, 8 TON and 1 TON, respectively.<br>
Palladium catalyzed allylation of active hydrogen-containing phenolic compounds using allyl esters of carboxylic acids and allyl carbonates is also disclosed in U.S.   Patent No. 5,578,740.  U.S. Patent No. 5,578,740 discloses that transition metal catalyst efficiency can be 12,800 TON per hour by carrying out the allylation reaction in a two-phase reaction including an agueous phase in which the pH of the aqueous phase is carefully controlled between 9 Co 12.  In this pH range, a carboxylic acid salt of the corresponding allyl carboxylate is the by-product of this allylation process.  Unfortunately, carboxylic acid salts, such as sodium acetate formed when allyl acetate is used as the allylating agent, are not economically recoverable as a free carboxylic acid, such as acetic acid, which can be recycled to manufacture an allyl carboxylic acid ester, such as allyl acetate, and thus, the carboxylic acid salts must be disposed of as a waste material.  It would be desirable to provide an alternative, non-carboxylic acid salt forming process, to the process described in U.S. Patent No. 5,578,740.<br>
Allylation of active hydrogen-containing compounds with type (b) allylation reagents including allyl carbonates, methallyl carbonates, or higher substituted allyl carbonates, is carried out in the presence of transition metal catalysts. Allylation with carbonates generally does no^i require a basic acting compound, hut in some instances basic additives may be used.  For example, the allylation of the active hydrogen-containing compound phenol with allyl methyl carbonate allylation reagent with nickel catalysts has been described by A. Mortreux, et. al, in J. Chem. Soc, Chem. Commun. , pp.<br><br>
1863-1864, (1995).  The allylation of the acCive hydrogen-containing compound bisphenol A with allyl methyl carbonate allylation reagent with palladium catalysts has been described in U.S. Patent No. 4,507,492 and by S. Sivaram and A. G. Shaikh in Macromolecular Reports, A32 (Suppl. 7) , pp. 1053-1060, (1995).  As allylation reagents, allyl carbonates provide the opportunity for easily recoverable and recyclable by-products, such as methanol and carbon dioxide, from the allylation reaction using allyl methyl carbonate.  However, unfortunately, allyl carbonates are expensive and not readily available on a commercial scale.<br>
In addition to the two aforementioned allylation reagents, there is a third type (c) allylation reagent that is a much less efficient allylating agent than the aforementioned allyl esters and allyl carbonates than can be provided in Step (1) of the process described in U.S. Patent No. 5,578,740.  The type (c) allylation reagent, comprises allyl alcohol, methallyl alcohol, or higher substituted allyl alcohols.<br>
Allylation of active hydrogen-containing compounds with type (c) allylation reagents including allyl alcohol, methallyl alcohol, or higher substituted allyl alcohols, is carried out in the presence of transition metal catalysts and generally without the use of basic acting compounds.  For example, the allylation of the active hydrogen-containing compounds phenol, trimethyl phenol, and bisphenol A with allyl alcohol has been reported in low yields (for example, an 18.2 percent yield of the allyl ether of bisphenol A) using palladium as the catalyst in Japanese Patent No. 5306246.  Yang, et. al, in Organometallics, (20), pp. 5326-5330, (2001) report that titanium cocatalysts are useful in the allylation of aromatic amines with allyl alcohol.  The allylation of active hydrogen-containing thiol compounds with allyl alcohol using ruthenium catalysts is discussed by T. A. Mitsudo, et. al, in J. Am. Chem. Soc, 121, (37), pp. 8657-<br><br>
8658, (1999).  Ruthenium transition metal catalysts have also recently been obsejrved by E. Bouwman, efc. al, in j_. Mol. Catal. A:   Chem., 159, pp. 163-177, (2000), as catalysts for allylation of monophenols with allyl alcoliol allylation reagent.  However, it has been reported by E. Bouwman, et. al, in J. Organometallic Chem., 650, pp. 1-24, (2002), that with the use of allyl alcohol as Che allyation reagent, the major products formed from allyl alcohol in the reaction are the homocoupled, undesired product, diallyl ether and ketones from alcohol isomerization, and the desired, crosscoupled allyl phenyl ethers are the minor products.  Although allyl alcohol is commercially available, it is relatively expensive compared to allyl acetate, and the catalytic processes using allyl alcohol for allylation are inefficient in selectivity to the desired product.<br>
In view of the disadvantages of the prior known allylation processes described above, it would be desirable: (A) to provide an alternative process for allylation of active hydrogen-containing compounds or mixtures of active hydrogen-containing compounds, particularly phenols or mixture of phenols, using an inexpensive and readily available allylation material, such as an allyl ester of a carboxylic acid as the allylation reagent; and (B) to provide an alternative process for allylation of active hydrogen-containing compounds or mixtures of active hydrogen-containing compounds, in particular phenols or mixture of phenols, using a transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst without the use of a basic acting material, so the allylation can be done in a single phase under neutral to acidic pH; therefore, allowing recovery of the carboxylic acid by-prpduct from the allylation reaction.<br>
The present invention is directed to a process for preparing an aryl allyl ether comprising reacting: (a) a phenolic compound or mixture of phenolic compounds with (b) an allylating agent such as an allyl carboxylate or an allyl carbonate in the presence of (c) a transition metal or rare<br><br>
earth metal catalyst coraplexed with at least one  strongly bonded, non-replaceable stable ligand whereby an aryl allyl ether is formed.  The ligand of the transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst complex may be (i) an olefinic-containing ligand or an aromatic-containing ligand; or (ii) a polymeric ligand or a heteroatom-containing multidentate ligand.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst used in the present invention may be a particular catalyst selected from the group of transition metals consisting of ruthenium, rhenium, molybdenum, tungsten, rhodium, palladium, iridium, platinum, nickel, cobalt, or iron,- or selected from the group of rare earth metals consisting of lanthnum, ytterbium, or samarium; or any combination thereof either as the metal with organic ligand(s) or as the metal salt.<br>
In another specific embodiment of the process of the present invention, allyl acetate, for example, may be used for allylation of phenolic compounds, without the need of using a base or a basic buffer in the process, in the presence of a ruthenium, iridium or palladium catalyst having at least one strongly bonded, non-replaceable stable ligand whereby an aryl allyl ether is formed.  The ligand of the transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst complex may be (i) an olefinic-containing ligand or an aromatic-containing ligand; or (ii) a polymeric ligand or a heteroatom-containing multidentate ligand.  In such a process of the present invention, acetic acid, for example, is formed as the byproduct of the allyl acetate allylation reaction instead of an acetate salt.  Therefore, the recovery and the recycle of acetic acid becomes feasible using the process of the present invention.<br>
Generally, the process of the present invention is directed to preparing an aryl allyl ether compound by reactinc a phenolic compound with an allylating reagent such as, for example, an allyl carboxylate or allyl carbonate as<br><br>
the allylating reagent in the presence of a transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst complexed with at least one strongly bonded, non-replaceable stable ligand whereby an aryl allyl ether compound is formed.  A "strongly bonded non-replaceable stable ligand" includes (i) a cyclopentadienyl ligand and (ii) a polymer-supported phosphine ligand.<br>
In general, the present invention also includes a process for preparing epoxy-containing compounds without using halohydrins, by first making an allyl ether derivative compound of a phenolic compound or mixture of phenolic compounds as described in the present invention and subsecjuently epoxidizing the allyl derivative compound to an epoxy-containing compound.  The process of epoxidizing an allyl derivative compound is taught, for example, in U.S. Patent 6,087,513.  Herein, when reference is made to a "phenolic compound" or "phenolic compounds" it is meant to include &amp; single phenolic compound or a combination of two or more phenolic compounds or mixtures of phenolic compounds.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,578,740 discloses preferentially using an aqueous phase and a base for making allyl derivative compounds of active hydrogen-containing compounds.  While the present invention process can also use an aqueous phase and a base in one embodiment of the present invention, it has been surprisingly found that the process for making allyl derivative compounds of phenolic compounds is more advantageous when an aqueous phase and a base (or a buffer) are not used and when the allylation reaction is carried out in the presence of a transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst, such as a palladium catalyst, having a strongly bonded ligand, such as a multidentate ligand or polymer bound ligand, for example, a polymer bound phosphine ligand; or in the presence of transition metal or rare earth metal catalysts, such as ruthenium or iridium catalysts, having at least one strongly bonded, non-replaceable ligand whose structure includes metal bonded ligands, such as<br><br>
cyclopentadienyl, and ligands with strongly coordinating heteroatoms, such as P, 0, and N.  Therefore, in one view, the present invention is an improved process over the process described in U.S. Patent No. 5,578,740 which uses a base or buffer in the allylation reaction and therefore produces a carbojcylic acid salt by-product, such as sodium acetate, which can not be directly recycled to a process for making allyl carboxylates.  Whereas, in the present invention, the allylation reaction produces a carboxylic acid by-product, such as acetic acid, which can be directly recycled to a process for making allyl carboxylates.<br>
In general, the transition metal or rare earth metal of the catalyst used in the present invention includes, for example, ruthenium, rhenium, molybdenum, tungsten, rhodium, palladium, iridium, platinum, nickel, cobalt, iron, lanthnum, ytterbium, samarium, or any corobination thereof. Preferably, ruthenium, iridium and palladium catalysts may be used in the present invention for allylation of active hydrogen-containing compounds, and especially for the allylation of aromatic compounds, such as phenols, when the specific ligands described previously are bound to the metal.<br>
"Aryl allyl ether compounds" or "aryl allyl ethers" as used herein means (i) allyl ethers that contain an allyl ether moiety connected directly to an aromatic ring,- or (ii) allyl ethers that contain an allyl ether moiety and an aromatic ring, but the allyl ether moiety is not connected directly to the aromatic ring, but instead the allyl ether moiety is linked to the aromatic ring via a linking group, such as a polyalkylene oxide group.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the aryl allyl ether or mixture of aryl allyl ethers prepared by the process of the present invention is represented by, but not limited to, the structures of the following Formulas i-V.<br><br>
The  following Formula  I  generically represents  a preferred  class  of  aryl  allyl  ethers  of  the present invention;<br>
Formula  I (R^)x Ar[OR^)y.<br>
In Formula I, x is from 0 to 750, and y is from 1 to 150.  When y is egual to or greater than two, then the aryl allyl ether is a multifunctional allyl ether.<br>
In Formula I, Ar may be a moiety containing a mononuclear aromatic ring, such as for example, phenyl.  Ar may also he a moiety containing multinuclear aromatic rings, such as for example, biphenyl, 2,2-diphenyl propane, bisphenylene oxide, tetrakis (1,1,2, 2-phenyl) ethane, stilhene, phenol-formaldehyde novolac, cresol-formaldehyde novolac, phenol-dicyclopentadiene novolac and hyper-branched aromatic phenol dendrimers.  Ar may also be a moiety containing multinuclear fused aromatic rings, such as for example, naphthalene, anthracene and naphthalene-formaldehyde novolac. Ar may also be a moiety containing multinuclear fused aromatic rings with one or more heteroatoms, such as for example, 0, N, S, Si, B, P or any combination of these heteroatoms, such as for example, guinoxaline, thiophene and qninoline.  Ar may also be a moiety containing mononuclear or multinuclear aromatic ring(s) fused with a cycloaliphatic ring(s) , such as for example, indane, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene and fluorene.  Ar may also be a  moiety containing mononuclear or multinuclear aromatic ring(s) fused_ with a cycloaliphatic ring(s) containing one or more heteroacoms, such as for example, 0, N, S, Si, B, P or any combination of these heteroatoms, such as for example, chroman, indoline and thioindane.  Ar as described above in Formula I may also he partially or fully fluorinated.<br><br>
In Formula I, Ar may also be a moiety containing aryl groups in which each aryl group may be connected to oligomeric (for example, polymers with less than 5000 molecular weight average) or high molecular weight (for example, greater than 5000 molecular weight average) organosiloxane units.  In such case, the aryl groups may be attached directly to the Si atoms of the organosiloxane units, or the aryl groups may be indirectly attached to the Si atoms of the organosiloxane units via an organic aliphatic moiety, organic cycloaliphatic moiety, organic aromatic moiety, or any combination thereof.  The organic aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, or aromatic moiety should contain no more than 20 carbon atoms.  When the Ar moiety contains such oligomeric or high molecular weight organosiloxane units, then y is preferably from 2 to 150.<br>
In Formula I, R^  is a group substituted for a hydrogen atom on the aromatic ring(s) of the Ar moiety.  R^ may be a halogen atom, such as for example, bromo or chloro; or a hydrocarbon radical, such as for example, an alkyl group, a cycloaliphatic group or aromatic group. R^  may be preferably an alkyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, such as for example, methyl, ethyl or propyl; a cycloaliphatic group having from 3 to 2 0 carbon atoms, such as for example, cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl; an aromatic group having from 6 to 20 carbon atoms, such as for example, phenyl or naphthyl; or any combination thereof.  The hydrocarbon radicals above may also contain one or more heteroatoms, such as, for example, 0, N, S, Si, B, P or any combination of these heteroatoms.  An example of a hydrocarbon radical containing an 0 heteroatom is a methoxy group, an ethoxy group or a polyalkylene oxide group derived from ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide, cyclohexene oxide or any combination thereof.  R^ as described above in Formula I may be partially or fully fluorinated.<br><br>
In Formula I, 0 is an oxygen atom substituted for a hydrogen atom on the aromatic ring{s) of the Ar moiety, and R^ is a propenyl-containing moiety preferably selected from:<br>

While it is desired to have at least one or more strongly bonded, non-replaceable or essentially non-replaceable, stable ligands L^, L^, L^, L*, L^, L^..L^ attached to the transition metal or rare earth metal of the transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst of Formula (A) , it is also possible that the transition metal or rare earth metal of the catalyst contains at least one or more vacant coordination sites or at least one or more labile ligands L^, L^, L^, L'*, L^, L^...L^ to allow for the insertion of the allylating agent onto the transition metal or rare earth metal in order to activate the allylic moiety to carry on the allylation process.  The at least one or more labile ligands L'^, L^, h^, L^, L^, L*'...LP of the transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst of Formula (A) are also called "hemilabile" hybrid ligands as described and illustrated by P. Braunstein, et al., in Angew. Chem. International Edit., 40(4), pp. 680-699, (2 001); and by C. Bessel, et al., in Chem. Rev., 101, pp. 1031-1066, (2001) .<br>

(iv) Silicon-containing ligands such as monodentate, didentate or polydentate silyl or silyloxy ligands L are useful for the preparation of transition metal or rare earth metal catalysts of Formula {A} of the present invention.<br>
The incorporation of silicon-based ligand L,, within the transition metal or rare earth metal complexes of Formula (A) of the present invention is important not only because it may provide the chemical functionality for bonding of the transition metal or rare earth metal complexes to solid supports, but also the silicon-based ligands may impart advantageous solubility and hydrolytic stability properties to the catalyst.<br>
Silicon-containing ligands can be generally divided into two groups: (1) organosilyl-containing ligands and (2} organosilyloxy-containing ligands.<br>
In the organosilyl-containing ligands, the silicon atom is directly bonded to the transition metal or rare earth<br><br>
metal atom.  An example of a monodentate organosilyl-containing ligand is -Si(R^)3 and an example of bidentate or multidentate organosilyl-containing ligand is -Si (R"') 2 [-0-Si (R^)2]in"-0-Si (R^)2- where R^ is the same as described above and m" is from 0 to 10.  The method used to make such organosilyl-containing ligands wherein the silicon atom is directly linked to the transition metal is taught, for example, by W. Malisch in Inorg. Chem., 34, 23, pp. 5701-5702, (1995).<br>
Organosilyl-containing ligands may also be introduced into a transition metal or rare earth metal complex by indirectly attaching the organosilyl-containing moiety to the transition metal or rare earth metal atom through a monodentate ligand, such as -L-Si(R^)3 wherein L is a ligand as defined above.  An example of such a monodentate organosilyl-containing ligand is y-<br>
aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, wherein an amido moiety is attached to one terminus and an organosilyl moiety is attached to the other terminus of the ligand such as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,620,938.<br>
Organosilyloxy-containing ligands, may be monodentate-ligands such as -0-Si(R')3 or multidentate ligands such as -0-Si(R^}2[-0-Si (R^)2]in--0-Si{R^)2-0-, wherein the silicon acorn is indirectly bonded to the transition metal or rare earth metal through an oxygen atom, where R"^ and, m" are as defined above.<br>
Organosilyloxy-containing ligands may also be ■ introduced into a transition metal or rare earch metal complex by indirectly attaching the organosilyoxyl-containing moiety to the transition metal or rare earth metal atom through a monodentate ligand, such as -L-0-Si{R^)3 wherein L is as defined above.  One such method to introduce an organosilyloxy-containing ligand into a transi-ion metal<br><br>
complex is taught, for example, by W. Malisch in Inorg. Chem■, 34, 23, pp.5701-5702 (1995).<br>
When a transition metal or rare earth metal complex with mono-, lii- or trifunctional organosilyl groups is condensed with mono-, di-, tri- or tetramethoxy or ethoxy silane, a three-dimensional organic-inorganic hybrid material is formed.  Depending on the degree of crosslinking, such hybrid organic-inorganic material is soluble or partially soluble in organic solvents.  The process making soluble or partially organic-soluble hybrid organic-inorganic materials useful in the present invention is described by K. J. Shea, et al., in Chem. Rev., 95, pp. 1431-1442 (1995).<br>
When transition metals or rare earth metals with ligands are bonded to a silasesguioxane, a three-dimensional, organic soluble metallosiloxane is formed.  The organic soluble, three-dimensional, transition metal or rare earth metal silasesguaoxane can be anchored or bonded onto a silicate-based, solid support to form a heterogeneous catalyst.  When the transition metal or rare earth metal is connected three-dimensionally through M-O-Si bonds, it is very tightly anchored onto the solid support.<br>
In the organosilyl-containing ligands, the silicon atom may also be directly bonded to the transition metal or rare earth metal atom.  The silicon atom of organosily-containing ligands may also be hound to aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic segments or radicals.  The silicon atom of organosily-containing ligands may also be bound to an organophosphinyl group.  The silicon atom of organosily-containing ligands may also be bound to polymeric backbones or to oligomeric alkalene oxide chain{s), such as those described by E. Lindner, in J. Organometallic Chem., 628(2), pp. 151-154, (2001) and in J. Non-Crysatlline Solids, 225, pp. 208-316, (1999).<br><br>
(V) The ligands L", L^ L^ LS L^, L^.-L^ in Formula (A) may also be selected from anionic groups.  When n of Formula (A) is greater than zero, then anionic or negatively-charged ligands, such as, chloride, bromide, acetate, nitrate, sulfate, tosylate, triflate, and<br>
hexaflurophosphonate; or the combination of any two or more of these anionic ligands; may be useful as ligands in the transition metal or rare earth metal catalysts of the present invention.<br>
The above described ligands 1^,   1?.   L^,   L^, L^ L^..L^ portion of the transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst of Formula (A) are meant to be representative of and not all inclusive of the ligands or complexing agents useful in the present invention.  A more detailed definition of the ligands useful in the present invention can be found in U. S, Patent No. 6,087,513.<br>
Ligands or complexing agents are preferably employed to stabilize and to enhance the activity of the transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst of Formula (A). The transition metal or rare earth metal of the catalyst of Formula (A) may be complexed with the complexing agent or ligand prior to addition to the allylation reaction mixture, in which instance the transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst is often isolated having a stoichiometric ratio of ligand(s) to transition metal or rare earth metal; or the catalyst complex may be formed in situ by adding the transition metal or rare earth metal and the ligand or complexing agent separately to the reaction mixture, in which instance the molar ratio of ligand or complexing agent to transition metal or rare earth metal may vary over a wide range.  The complexing agents or ligands may be employed in amounts of from 0.5 to 20 equivalents of complexing atom or moiety pez' one equivalent of transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst, preferably from 0.75 to 10 equivalents of complexing atom or moiety per one equivalent of transition<br><br>

The allylation catalyst of Formula (A) of the 5  present invention may be employed as a homogenous or a heterogeneous catalyst.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the allyation catalyst of Formula (A) is a homogeneous catalyst. In such homogeneous catalysts, the transition metal or rare )  earth metal catalyst is soluble in the allylation reaction mixture.<br>
When the catalyst is employed as a homogeneous catalyst, the reaction may be conducted in a batch or continuous mode.<br>
i	In another embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
transition metal or rare earth metal allylation catalyst of Formula (A) is a heterogeneous catalyst.  By heterogeneous catalyst it is meant that the transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst is either (i) Insoluble in the reaction mixture or (ii) placed onto a solid support material which is insoluble in the allylation reaction mixture.<br>
Heterogeneous catalysts may be formed by any of three separate processes: (i) by supporting the transition metal or rare earth metal on a support material through simple adsorption of the metal catalyst on the support material via deposition of the catalyst on the support material; (ii) by supporting the transition metal or rare earth metal on a support material through anchoring or tethering of the transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst of Formula (A) to a the support material via bond formation between a reactive site on the transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst of Formula (A) and the support material; or (iii) by forming the transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst of Formula (A) by reacting a transition metal or rare earth metal complex with a solid polymeric<br><br>
ligand.  The heterogeneous catalysts may be made by any of several procedures well-known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The heterogeneous catalyst of Formula (A) of the present invention may be formed via process (i) by direct deposition of the transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst on the solid support, wherein the metal catalyst is simply absorbed onto the solid support, such as described for example by H.~U. Blaser, et. al, in J. of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical, 173, pp. 3-18, (2001); and by D. Stirling, et. al, in J. of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical, 172, pp. 207-218, (2001) .  The heterogeneous catalyst made by the process of depositing the transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst on the solid support may be utilized directly or the heterogeneous catalyst may be subsequently treated by any of a number of methods, such as calcination, well-known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The heterogeneous catalyst of Formula (A) of the present invention may be formed via process (ii) by anchoring or tethering the transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst to a solid support.  By anchoring or tethering the transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst to a solid support it is meant that a stable, ionic, coordination or covalent chemical bond is formed between at least one of the h^,   iJ,   iJ,   L^, L^, L^...L^ ligands portion of the transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst of Formula {A} and the solid support, therefore rendering the transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst into the heterogeneous state.  Such a process (ii) for formation of a heterogeneous catalyst is described, for instance, by B. Chaudret, et. al, in J. Am. Chem. Soc. , 123, pp.7584-7593, (2001).<br>
In the processes (i) and (ii) for making a heterogeneous catalyst of the present invention, the solid support may include, for example, but is not limited to, styrene-co-divinyl benzene or vinyl pyridine-co-divinyl benzene crosslinked polymers or ion exchange resins, aromatic<br><br>
polyimides, organosol gels, charcoal, carbon, silica, alumina, Ba2S04, MgO, clay, silicate, naturally occurring zeolite, synthetic zeolite phosphite, aluminate or ainy combination of these solid support materials.<br>
The heterogeneous catalyst of Formula (A) of the present invention may be formed via process (iii) by a process wherein the transition metal or rare earth metal complex catalyst is anchored onto a solid support through the formation of a strong, transition metal or rare earth metal to polymeric ligand bond.  In this process (iii) for the preparation of a heterogeneous catalyst, the ligand h^,   L^, L^, h^,   h^,   L^.-L^ portion of the transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst of Formula (A) is a polymeric ligand.  Such processes for forming heterogeneous catalysts from polymeric ligands are described above under the topic of polymeric ligands and by Y. K. Chung, et. al, in J. of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical, 174, pp. 151-157, (2001) .<br>
In one embodiment of the heterogeneous catalyst process of the present invention, the ratio of the amount of the transition metal or rare earth metal in the catalyst on a metal weight basis to the weight of the solid support material is preferably in the range of from 1x10"^ part to one part of transition metal or rare earth metal per one part of solid support; more preferably the ratio of the weight of the transition metal or rare earth metal in the catalyst to the weight of the solid support material is in the range of from IxlO"^ part to 3x10"^ part of transition metal or rare earth metal per one part of solid support; and most preferably, the ratio of 'he weight of the transition metal or rare earth metal in the catalyst to the weight of the solid support material is in the range from 1x10"' part to 1x10""^ part of transition metal or rare earth metal per one part of solid support.<br>
When the catalyst is employed as a supported, heterogeneous catalyst, the ^^^■^^■l3^inn reaction can be<br><br>
conducted in a fixed bed or suspended in the liquid reaction mixture; and the reaction can be carried out in a batch or continuous mode.<br>
If desired, when water is employed as a solvent, either as the sole solvent or as a cosolvent, buffering agents such as, for example, alkali or alkaline earth metal bicarbonates such as sodium carbonate or bicarbonate; carbon dioxide; alkali or alkaline earth metal hydrogen phosphates; or alkali or alkaline earth metal borates may be used in the process of the present invention.  When water is employed as a solvent, either as the sole solvent or as a cosolvent, with or without a buffering agent, it is preferred that the pH of the reaction mixture be less than 9.<br>
Some additives are useful in promoting allylation of phenolic compounds or mixtures of phenolic compounds with allylating agents.  These types of additives may be used in the process of the present invention if desired.  For example, some additives may be used in order to replace labile or unstable ligands L, in the metal catalyst represented in Formula (A) , including for example, but not limited to, silver tosylate; ammonium tosylate; trimethylsilyl trifluromethane sulfonate; triethylsilyl trifluromethane sulfonate; tri-isopropylsilyl trifluromethane sulfonate; silver trif luromethane sulfonate'; ammonium hexaflurophosphonate; silver hexaflurophosphonate.<br>
The amounts of such additives that may be added to the allylation reaction mixture can be varied from 0.1 mole to 10 mole per equivalent of transition metal or  rare earth metal.<br>
Suitable solvents  which can optionally, but preferably, be employed in the process of the present invention include, for example, water; carbon dioxide; ionic liquids; excess amounts of allyl carboxylate and allyl carbonate; aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons; and aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic<br><br>
halogenated hydrocarbons.  Other solvents include, for example, nitro-alkanes and oxygenated hydrocarbons, such as alcohols, ethers, glycols, glycol ethers, esters, and ketones.  Any combination of any two or more such solvents can also be used in the present invention.  Particularly suitable solvents include, for example, allyl acetate, hexane, octane, cyclohexane, toluene, xylene, chlorobensene, dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, ethyl acetate, nitromethane, tetrahydrofuran, ethanol, isopropanol, glymes or any coinbination thereof.<br>
The preferred solvents are allylacetate, hexane, cyclohexane, toluene, 1,2-dichloroethane, isopropanol, acetone, glycols and glycol ethers or any combination of any two or more such solvents.<br>
The,solvents are employed in amounts of from zero to 100 preferably from 0.5 to 20, more preferably from 1 to 10 parts by weight based upon the weight of the phenolic compound.<br>
The aryl allyl ether compound of the present invention is prepared by reacting a phenolic compound with an allylating reagent, such as an allyl carboxylate or an allyl carbonate, in the presence of at least one transition metal ■or rare earth metal catalyst; and optionally in the presence of at least one buffering agent; and optionally in the presence of at least one salt additive; and further optionally in the presence of one or more suitable solvents.<br>
The allylation reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst selected from the group consisting essentially of ruthenium, rhenium, molybdenum, tungsten, rhodium, palladium, iridium, platinum, nickel, cobalt, iron, lanthanum, ytterbium, samarium or any combination thereof, with inorganic or organic ligand(s).<br><br>
Preferably, the present invention allylation reaction is carried out in the presence of at least one ligand or complexing agent, which is strongly or non-replaceably bound directly to the transition metal or rare earth metal of the catalyst.<br>
In the allylation process of the present invention utilizing a heterogeneous catalyst, the amount of heterogeneous catalyst in the reaction mixture may be highly variable dependent on numerous factors, such as, whether the reaction is a batch reaction or a continuous, fixed-bed or fluidized-bed reaction or how much solvent is used. Generally, the weight ratio of heterogeneous catalyst to allylation reaction mixture is 0.1 to 1000 parts of heterogeneous catalyst to 100 parts of allylation reaction mixture.  Generally, in batch reactions, the weight ratio of heterogeneous catalyst to allylation reaction mixture is 0.1 to 50 parts of heterogeneous catalyst to 100  parts of allylation reaction mixture.  Generally, in continuous, fixed-bed or fluidised-bed reactions, the weight ratio of heterogeneous catalyst to allylation reaction mixture is 100 to 1000 parts of heterogeneous catalyst to 100 parts of allylation mixture.<br>
In the allylation process of the present invention utilizing a homogeneous catalyst, a preferred molar ratio of the transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst to phenolic compound present in the reaction mixture is from 1x10"^ equivalents to 0.1 equivalents of catalyst per one equivalent of phenolic compound; a more preferred molar ratio of the transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst to phenolic compound present in the reaction mixture is from 1x10'^ equivalents to 0.01 equivalents of catalyst per one equivalent of phenolic compound; the most preferred molar ratio of che transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst to phenolic compound present in the reaction mixture is from<br><br>
1x10'° eciuivalents to 0.001 equivalents of catalyst per one equivalent of phenolic compound.<br>
The allylation reaction may be conducted at a temperature of from 10°C to 200'C, preferably from 50°C to ISO^C, more preferably from 70°C to llO'^C and for a time sufficient to essentially complete the reaction, usually for 0.1 to 72 hours, preferably from 0,1 to 48 hours, and more preferably from 0.1 to 24 hours.  Optimum allylation reaction temperatures and times for particular reactants will vary depending upon the reactivity of the particular reactants, solvents and catalysts employed.  Particular pressures are not deemed to be determinative of any appreciative affects on the process; however, pressures should be employed which preferably will keep the reaction in the liquid phase.  For example, a pressure of from 50 mmHg to 2 atmospheres may be used in the process of the present invention.<br>
Once  the allylation has been carried out to the desired degree of conversion, the aryl allyl ether product may be separated and recovered from the reaction mixture using any appropriate techniques or suitable means.  A particularly suitable means may include, for example, filtration or decantation from the catalyst if the transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst and its associated complexing agent are present as a heterogeneous phase in the reaction mixture.  In instances where the transition metal or rare earth metal catalyst and its associated complexing agent are present as a homogeneous phase in the reaction mixture, the catal^-st may be remoyed, for instance, by membrane filtration techniques such as described by D. Turlan, et. al, in Chemical Communications, pp. 2608-2609, (2001); by nanofiltration techniques, such as described by A. G. Livingston et. al, in Tetrahedron Letters, 42, pp. 8219-8222, (2001); or by extraction techniques such as described in U.S. Patent N03. 5,874,639; 5,874,640; 5,892,119; and 5,917,095.<br><br>
Once the catalyst is separated from the allylation reaction mixture, the allylation reaction product may be separated and recovered from the reaction mixture using any appropriate techniques such as filtration, washing, fractional distillation, extractive distillation, liquid-liguid extraction, solid-liquid extraction and crystallization, or any combination of these methods.  For example, one product separation scheme could involve removal of all volatiles, such as solvent and unreacted allylating agent, from the reaction mixture by distillation or evaporation.  Then recovering the carboxylic acid by product by distillation or extraction to recover the desired allyl derivative product as a bottom product.  The carboxylic acid by-product of allylation with an allyl carboxylate recovered using these techniques may be recycled to allyl carboxylate manufacture.<br>
If it is required to obtain the allyl derivative compound in a more purified state, then the allyl derivative compound may be further purified by suitable means such as distillation, crystalization, sublimation, or extraction.<br>
These example schemes for separation of an allylation reaction mixture are intended only to describe some of many possible separation schemes.  The separation scheme of choice will depend on many  factors such as   the boiling points, melting points, thermal stabilities, and solubilities of the various components of the allylation reaction mixture.<br>
The heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts of the • oresent invention may be reusable after each allylation reaction.  The catalyst may be separated and reused without additional treatment or the catalyst may be regenerated by any of several methods, such as through washing with certain non-reactive solvents or dilute acid or base, well-known to those skilled in the art.<br><br>
It is also preferred that with certain combinations of carboxylic acid and phenolic compounds that the aryl allyl ether compound is formed in situ during the allyl carboxylate synthesis step.<br>
The aryl allyl ether compounds made by the process of the present invention are useful products directly in their allyl form, for instance, the compounds may be used as monomers in polymerization reactions, such as taught in European Patent EP 458240 v;ith bismaleimide compositions and in European Patent EP 269392 A2 with cyanate ester compositi'ons.<br>
Additionally, the allyl derivatives made by the process of the present invention may optionally be directly converted, for example by epoxidation, to useful commercial products, such as epoxy resins, as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,578,740 and 6,087,513.<br>
The aryl allyl ethers made by the process of the present invention may optionally be further reacted, for example hy  dihydroxylation, to niake new  derivatives, for example a-dihydroxy derivatives, useful in preparing intermediates, such as carbonate intermediates or a-halohydrin intermediates, which can in turn be converted to useful commercial products, such as epoxy resins, such as disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/899,409, Attorney Docket No. C-60991; and U.S. Patent Nos. 6,172,182 Bl and 6,001,954.
