				<td>AN APPARATUS FOR PREPARING PURE DRINKING WATER BY AUTOMATICALLY BOILING AND COOLING THE SAME IN SEALED CHAMBERS.<br>
The Present invention relates to an apparatus for preparing pure drinking water by automatically boiling and cooling the same in sealed chambers for preparation of safe drinking water. The apparatus of the instant invention particularly relates to automatically Boil water in sealed condition followed by cooling and thereby producing germ free drinking water.<br>
There are so many water purifier is known in the Prior Art, e.g. Methods for removing particulate and chemical species from water are well known, and include distillation, reverse osmosis, freezing, ionization, photocatalytic treatment, and carbon filtration. Examples of such methods are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,007,994; 5,227,053; 5,133.858; and 4,717,476. In addition, there are many well-known methods for destroying bacteria in water, including boiling, using submicron filtration, and disinfectant processes using chlorine, bromine, iodine, or other strong oxidizers. Treatment with heat of disinfectants may also be used sterilize water containing harmful viral agents.<br>
In many instances, it is desired to have access to a portable means for purifying water. For example, it is often impractical for campers, hikers, mountain climbers and others who are outdoors for extended period of time, to rely on treated water that they would be required to carry throughout an outing extending over several days. In these instances, it will be preferable to rely on local water sources, such as streams or lakes, which typically contain various particulate and mineral contaminants, including dirt, salt, algae, etc., and also may contain bacterial or viral contaminants. Although the methods and devices discussed above might be used to purify water flowing in a stream or lake water, some of the methods are unsuitable for portable use, because, e.g., they require heavy or bulky equipment, or substantial mechanical or electrical power. In view of the problem, several portable water purification devices have been developed, including those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,273,649; 5,268,093; 5,244,579; and 3,635,799.<br>
Drinking water boiling in conventional method is a very costlier and time consuming process. The other major drawbacks are of contamination chances during cooling, filtering and storing process, as the boiled cold water have no residual protection against re-contamination.<br>
Heat supplying to the water, until it becomes into bubbling temperature and next 20 minutes of rolling boil consume huge amount of energy normally 10-15 liters of water requires more than 35-50 minutes time for proper boiling. After complete boiling it requires 6-12 hours for proper colling into room temperature. In another point of view, this long time cooling process may cause of bacterial growth in conventional method.<br>
During filtering the boiled water may be contaminated with the foreign bodies, like micro-organisms, dust, bacteria, virus and so many other things due to contact with unsterilized filtering medias like filter candle, sand filter, fabric filter etc.<br>
Considering the above drawbacks there is need to produce an automatic apparatus for boiling drinking water with minimum energy consumption. Filtering, cooling and storing, hindering, recontamination with the dust, micro-organism, bacteria and viruses.<br><br>

Condensed steam 63 Volume of heat exchanger 21 is 2 to 3 time larger than boiling vessel 17.<br>
The final cooling unit 38 illustrated in the fig 4 comprises a hot water inlet line 11 and outlet line 12 having a coolingwaterinletandoutletline13&amp; 14 respectively. Cooling water inlet solenoid valve 2 and Cooling Tube 17.<br>
Boiled water collection tank 30 illustrated in the fig. 5 comprises an inlet line 15 and a tap outlet line 16 with a mini pump 39 and a solenoid valve 31 for high flow outlet through the auto tap 60. Inlet float ball 34, inlet Sensor 64, small orifice 36, inlet port 37. Level control float ball 35 &amp; 40 having lever 69 and 70. Limit switch 41 &amp; 42.<br>
Logic process control unit 20 illustrated in the fig. 6 comprises a hybride electronic system. All dotted line b, d, e, h, k, l, m shown in the fig. 1 are sensing line and farm line a, c, f. g, i, j, n. o are controlling power-supply line for controlling solenoid valves, pumps, motors, and heater.<br>
(2)<br><br>
When the boiling vessel 17 is empty, means the water level falls below the sensor 18, solenoid valve 1 become open and water starts to inlet into heat exchanging chamber simulaniously. in the boiling vessel 17 illustrated is the figure I of (he drawings. The solenoid valve 1 remains open until the boiling vessel 17 become full. When the boiling vessel 17 become full means the water level touches the upper level sensor 19 inlet solinoid valve 1 become closed.<br>
As soon as the boiling vessel 17 become full the heater 4 become powered ON. After a certain period the water become boiled up and a specified steam pressure developed in to the sealed boiling vessel 17. The water become sterilized in this steam of high pressure and temperature. In this state when a little amount of heat supplied to the water, steam pressure pump to the boiled hot water against the dead weight pressure open valve 44 means boiled hot water passes through the coil formed tube 8. When the boiled hot water passes through the tube 8, the hot water exchange heat with the cold water in the heat exchanger 21. Hot water become cooled and cold water become hot. Almost cold boiled water then passes through the final cooling unit 38.<br>
During passing through the final cooling unit 38. the solenoid valve 2 become open and cooling water inlet and outlet through the 13 and 14 respectively. After final cooling the boiled water collects into the collecting tank 30. When the collecting tank 30 become full the boiling process become stop.<br>
When the collecting tank 30 become empty by predetermined level means water level falls bellow the float ball 40, water starts inlet into the boiling vessel 17 automatically by the control 20. When re-start the system after 1st cycle of boiling, preheated water of the heat exchanger vessel 21 enter into the boiling vessel 17 throught the outlet 7 and non return valve 3. At the same time the cold water enter into the heal exchanger 21 for fill up the vessel. As the cold water is heavier than hot water the cold water remain at the bottom of the heat exchanger 21. The upper portion of the water in the heat exchanger 21 is hotter than the bottom water. This pre-hcated water almost boiling hot enter in to the boiling vessel 17.<br>
When the boiling vessel  17 become full with the pre-healed water, from the heat exchanging chamber 21 by predetermined level, the inlet valve 1 become stop by the control 20. After filling the boiling vessel 17 heater 4 become powered ON. In this condition very little amount of heat to be supplied for complete boiling of the water. The boiling vessel 17 is smaller than the heat exchanging vessel 21. The large amount of water in the heat exchanging vessel 21 collects maximum amount of heat from the boiled hot water during passing through the coil formed tube 8.<br>
The filter candle 6 in the boiling vessel 17 filter the boiled water in hot condition the precipitate deposited after filtering on the bottom of the boiling vessel out let through the outlet port 22.<br>
The port 22 (open and close) is operated by the control unit 20 in the fig I. when depositing sufficient amount of precipitate, the outlet port 22 become open and sediment starts to drain out and after cleanning the port 22 become closed automatically.<br>
The non return valve 3 prevent back flow of the water and steam during boiling process.<br>
0)<br><br>
The boiling process continues until the collecting tank 30 become full. The process restarts again, when some amount of the boiled water is used means water level falls under the float 40.<br>
The safety valve 25 releases excess steam and presure from the boiling vessel 17 during boiling.<br>
The boiling vessel 17, outlet line 27 and pipe line 29, heat exchanging chamber 21, out line 7 of the heat exchanging chamber 21, pipe line 28. non return valve 3 are heat insulated to protect the heat loss through the surfaces.<br>
Boiling occurs into a sealed boiling vessel 17. Cooling occurs into a heat exchanger 21 where the boiled hot water of about 125°-150°C become cooled into room temperature with in 3 to 5 seconds. It kills all germs, micro-organism, bacteria, virus etc. and hence the process occurs into a sealed system, it prevents all contamination chances.<br>
Boiled hot water, exchange heat with the cold water in to heat exchanger 21 without radiating the heat in to the air. The cold water collects and retain heat from the boiled hot water, of the boiling vessel 17, passing through the coiled form tube 8, in to the heat exchanger 21 and the cold water of the heat exchanger 21 become hot.<br>
When further boiling process starts again in to the boiling vessel 17, the preheated water from the heat exchanger 21 enter into the boiling vessel 17. In this case minimum amount of heat is required to complete the boiling into the boiling vessel 17. Here heat re-cycle into a closed circuit system, means heat supplied once to the water into boiling vessel 17, transfer to the heat exchanger 21 and come back in to the boiling vessel 17 after complete the boiling.<br>
Thus the invented apparatus boil water with minimum energy consumption. In this way water boiling cost is very less than known art of boiling drinking water in domestic use. The invented apparatus comprises with seven stage process system. An inlet valve 1, pressure boiling vessel 17, hot filtering unit 6, heat exchanger 21, final cooling unit 38 collection tank 30 and an outlet valve 42.<br>
The inlet valve 1 is a solenoid valve operated eclectically. The pressure boiling vessel 17 comprises a heater 4, an inbuilt filter unit 6, an inlet line 5 and outlet line 27. A level control system 18 &amp; 19 which control the inlet and outlet of the water to the boiling vessel 17.<br>
Final cooling tube 38 comprises an inlet line 11. an outlet line 12. A coiled formed cooling tube 8. The two end of the coil form cooling tube connected to the inlet line 9 and outlet line 10. All time heat exchanger 21 remain filled with the cold water.<br>
(4)<br><br>
Final cooling unit 38 comprises two another inlet line 13 and outlet line 14 are connected to cooling water supply, for inlet and outlet the cooling water over the cooling tube 19. A solenoid valve 2 is fitted in the cooling water inlet line 13.<br>
Collection tank 30 comprises an in let line 15 and out let tap 60. A flow on switch 34 is incorporated in the inlet line 15 of the collection tank 30, for sensing the presence of boiled water entering in to the collection tank. As soon as the boiled hot water starts to enter into collection tank 30, cooling water starts to cooling them into the final cooling unit 38.<br>
A level control system comprises two float 35 and 40 in to the collecting tank, for controlling the water level of the collection tank.<br>
The first advantage of the invented apparatus is of energy saving. When boiled hot water from the boiling vessel 17 transfer to the heat exchanger 21 for cooling process, exchange heat with the storage cold water in the heat exchanger vessel 21.<br>
Storage cold water recovers heat from the boiled hot water and become preheated in the heat exchanger 21, means heat doesn't radiate in the open air.<br>
When the pre-heated water of about 80 - 9 5°C temperature transfer from the heat exchanger 21 to boiling vessel 17, requires minimum amount of heat and time for complete boiling comparison to any other conventional prior art of boiling means saving of energy.<br>
Second advantage of time factor. Normally 15 liter of water requires 10-15 hours to complete a full cycle of boiling cooling &amp; filtering processes for making boiled water. But in present invention 10-15 liters of water requires only 30-50 minutes, it is a time saving process.<br>
Third advantage is of effectiveness. In the present invention water become boiling into the boiling vessel 17, which is a sealed pressure boiling vessel. Water become boiling in 135-150 degree C and 1.25 to 1.5 kg/cm2 pressure.<br>
All germs, micro-organisms, cyst, ova, bacteria, virus and any other germs like this become destroy in this high temperature and pressure, means water become effective boiling for drinking purpose.<br>
Fourth advantage, is of prevention to re-contamination. All the process means boiling, filtering, cooling and collecting occurs into sealed process system i.e.fig. 2, fig. 3, fig. 4, fig. 5. Due to sealed boiling process and hence the filtering process occurs in to hot condition, there is no chances of re-contamination, means prevention to recon lamination after boiling.<br>
