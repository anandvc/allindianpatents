				<td>This invention relates to new therapeutically useful pyrrolidiniums, to some processes for their preparation and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
The novel structures according to the invention are antimuscarinic agents with a potent and long lasting effect. In particular, these compounds show high affinity for M3 muscarinic receptors. This subtype of muscarinic receptor is present in glands and smooth muscle and mediates the excitatory effects of the parasympathetic system on glandular secretion and on the contraction of visceral smooth muscle (Chapter 6, Cholinergic Transmission, in H.P. Rang etal., Pharmacology, Churchill Livingstone, New York, 1995).<br>
M3 antagonists are therefore known to be useful for treating diseases characterised by an increased parasympathetic tone, by excessive glandular secretion or by smooth muscle contraction (R.M. Eglen and S.S. Hegde, (1997), Drug News Perspect., 10(8):462-469).<br>
Examples of this kind of diseases are respiratory disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, bronchial hyperreactivity, asthma, cough and rhinitis; urological disorders such as urinary incontinence, pollakiuria, neurogenic or unstable bladder, cystospasm and chronic cystitis; gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, spastic colitis, diverticulitis and peptic ulceration; and cardiovascular disorders such as vagally induced sinus bradycardia (Chapter 7, Muscarinic Receptor Agonists and Antagonists, in Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 10th edition, McGraw Hill, New York, 2001).<br>
The compounds of the invention can be used alone or in association with other drugs commonly regarded as effective in the treatment of these diseases. For example, they can be administered in combination with p2-agonists, steroids, antiallergic drugs, phosphodiesterase IV inhibitors an/or leukotriene D4 (LTD4) antagonists for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in the treatment of a respiratory disease.<br>

Intermediate 1-19<br>
Preparation of (3R)-1-methylpyrrolidin-3-ol<br>
15 g (0.172 mol) of (3R)-pyrrolidin-3-ol (commercially available) were dissolved in 240 ml of MeOH. This solution was cooled to 10-15°C, and formaldehyde (124.5 ml of a 36 % solution in water, diluted with'125 ml of MeOH ) and NaBH4 (16.27 g, 0.43 mol) were added in small portions, alternativately during 1h, maintaining the temperature at 10-15°C. After 20 min the mixture was warmed to room temperature and the reaction continued for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was acidified with HCI 2N, stirred during 20 minutes and neutralised with solid NaHCO3. MeOH and most of the water were evaporated and the residue was diluted with a small quantity of water, basified with solid K2CO3 and exhaustively extracted with CHCI3.The organic phases were combined and dried over Na2SO4. CHCI3 was evaporated to give an oil which was purified by Kugelrohr distillation at reduced pressure (0.2-0.3 mbar, 50-60°C oven) to give 14.91 g (85.6 %) of the title product.<br>

Also included within the scope of the present invention are pharmaceutical compositions which comprise, as the active ingredient, at least one pyrrolidinium derivative of formula (I)<br><br>
in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. Preferably the composition is made up in a form suitable for oral administration.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluents which are mixed with the active compound or compounds, to form the composition of this invention are well-known per se and the actual excipients used depend inter alia on the intended method of administration of the composition.<br>
Compositions of this invention are preferably adapted for oral administration. In this case, the composition for oral administration may take the form of tablets, film-coated tablets, liquid inhalant, powder inhalant and inhalation aerosol; all containing one or more compounds of the invention; such preparations may be made by methods well-known in the art.<br>
The diluents which may be used in the preparations of the compositions include those liquid and solid diluents which are compatible with the active ingredient, together with colouring or flavouring agents, if desired. Tablets or film-coated tablets may conveniently contain between 1 and 500 mg, preferably from 5 to 300 mg of active ingredient. The inhalant compositions may contain between 1 jag and 1,000µg, preferably from 10 µg to 800 µg of active ingredient. In human therapy, the dose of the compound of formula (I) depend on the desired effect and duration of treatment; adult doses are generally between 3 mg and 300 mg per day as tablets and 10µg and 800 µg per day as inhalant composition.<br>
Pharmacological Action<br>
The results on human muscarinic receptors binding and in the test on bronchospasm in guinea pig, were obtained as described below.<br>
Human muscarinic receptor studies.<br>
The binding of [3H]-NMS to human muscarinic receptors was performed according to Waelbroeck et al (1990), Mol. Pharmacol., 38: 267-273. Assays were carried out at 25°C. Membrane preparations from stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells (CHO) expressing the genes for the human M3 muscarinic receptors were used.<br><br>
f'or determination of IC50l membrane preparations were suspended in DPBS to a final concentration of 89 µg/ml for the M3 subtype. The membrane suspension was incubated with the tritiated compound for 60 min. After incubation the membrane fraction was separated by filtration and the bound radioactivity determined. Non-specific binding was determined by addition of 10-4 M atropine. At least six concentrations were assayed in duplicate to generate individual displacement curves.<br>
Our results show that the compounds of the present invention have high affinities for M3 muscarinic receptors, preferably human muscarinic receptors. Thus, the IC50 of the preferred compounds of the invention is lower than 35 nM. Most preferred compounds, such as the compounds of examples 1 to 8 described below, have an IC50 lower than 20 nM.<br>
Test on bronchospasm in guinea pig<br>
The studies were performed according to H. Konzett and F. Rb'ssler (1940), Arch. Exp. Path. Pharmacol. 195: 71-74. Aqueous solutions of the agents to be tested were nebulized and inhaled by anaesthetized ventilated male guinea pigs (Dunkin-Hartley). Bronchial response to intravenous acetylcholine challenge was determined before and after drug administration and the changes in pulmonary resistance at several time-points were expressed as percent of inhibition of bronchospasm.<br>
The compounds of the present invention inhibited the bronchospasm response to acetylcholine with high potency and a long duration of action.<br>
From the above described results one of ordinary skill in the art can readily understand that the compounds of the present invention have excellent M3 antimuscarinic activity and thus are useful for the treatment of diseases in which the M3 muscarinic receptor is implicated, including respiratory disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, bronchial hyperreactivity, asthma, cough and rhinitis; urological disorders such as urinary incontinence, pollakiuria, neurogenic or unstable bladder, cystospasm and chronic cystitis; gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, spastic colitis, diverticulitis and peptic ulceration; and cardiovascular disorders such as vagally induced sinus bradycardia.<br><br>
The present invention further provides a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a compound of formula (I) for use in a method of treatment of the human or animal body by therapy, in particular for the treatment of respiratory, urological or gastrointestinal disease or disorder.<br>
The present invention further provides the use of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a compound of formula (1) for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a respiratory, urological or gastrointestinal disease or disorder.<br>
Further, the compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of formula (I) can be used in a method of treating a respiratory, urological or gastrointestinal disease or disorder, which method comprises administering to a human or animal patient in need of such treatment an effective, non-toxic, amount of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula (I).<br>
Further, the compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutical compositions comprising-a compound of formula (1) can be used in combination with other drugs effective in the treatment of these diseases. For example with 32 agonists, steroids, antiallergic drugs, phosphodiesterase IV inhibitors and/or leukotriene D4 (LTD4) inhibitors, for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in the treatment of a respiratory disease.<br>
