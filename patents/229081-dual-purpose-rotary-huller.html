Field of Invention<br>
This invention relates to a dual-purpose rotary huller for grinding/pulverizing and mixing the spices and other like items. The device is useful for grinding various spices at a time separately and without damaging the natural flavour and medicinal properties.<br>
Background of invention<br>
There are various kinds of grinding and mixing devices are known in the art. Some of the conventional devices are manual as well as motor operated.<br>
One of the conventional devices is called as Imam Dusta. The device comprises a cylindrical body having a closed end such that to accommodate the spices to be grounded at the bottom side thereof. A solid bar/rod is provided along with the cylinder body for using the same as a tool to crush /grind the spices provided in the cylinder manually. The solid bar/rod is hammered on to the spices till it is converted in the form of a power as per the requirement of the user.<br>
Various types of motorized grinding machines are also known in the art. These machines are called as grinders/mixers. Such grinders/mixers comprise grinding/mixing blades provided with a rotatable shaft disposed into a grinding/mixing chamber vertically. The shaft is adapted to be rotated usually by means of an electric motor. Different kinds of blades are used to grind/mix the different kind of spices. The devices of the construction mentioned herein above are disclosed in the US patent No: 6616075,6663031,6196481 and 4767069.<br>
Disadvantages of the prior art<br>
There are disadvantages associated with conventional devices. One of the main disadvantages is that the conventional device is time consuming and tedious.<br>
Another disadvantages is that the conventional device can grind only one item at a time.<br><br>
Yet another disadvantage is that the devices are complicated in construction, the maintenance thereof is also costly and skilled people are required to maintain the same.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that the flavour and the medicinal properties of the spices are damaged during grinding by conventional devices.<br>
Another disadvantage is that different kinds of blades are required to grind/mix different kind of spices.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that the convention devices cannot be used in the remote areas where there is no electric power supply.<br>
Object and advantages of the present invention<br>
Therefore the main object of the present invention is to provide a rotary huller, which obviates the disadvantages associated with the conventional devices.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a rotary huller which is simple in constructions and maintenance thereof is negligible.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a rotary huller, which is useful for grinding the spices in order to keep the natural flavour and medicinal properties of the spices, herbal and or non-herbal products.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a rotary huller, which can be operated with the help of electricity as well as manually in the remote area.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a rotary huller which is low in cost, easy in operation.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a rotary huller, which is useful grind/mix different types of material/spices at a time.<br>
The following description contains many specifics but these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the invention. These specifics may be treated as an<br><br>
exemplification of one preferred embodiment thereof. Many other variations are possible. Therefore the scope of the invention should not be limited to the embodiment illustrated, and the alterations and variations may be treated within the spirit and scope of this invention.<br>
Statement of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a dual purpose rotary huller comprising a plurality of hollow cylinders being secured on both the sides of a circular disc adapted to be mounted on the main shaft supported rotatabiy on the top of the main frame, a sprocket being mounted on said main shaft such that to receive the drive from a small sprocket mounted on a shaft supported on one side of the main frame rotatabiy, a pulley being provided on said shaft such that to be driven by a motor or manually,<br>
Brief description of invention<br>
In accordance with this invention a dual-purpose rotary huller has a plurality of hollow cylinders secured on both the sides of a circular disc. The disc is mounted on a main shaft supported on the main frame rotatabiy by means of bearings secured at the top the main frame on both the sides thereof. A big sprocket is mounted on the main shaft at one side thereof for receiving the drive from a small sprocket by means of a chain. The small sprocket is mounted on a shaft supported on one side of the main frame rotatabiy by means of bearings secured with the main frame. A pulley is mounted on the shaft for receiving the drive from a motor by means of belt. The shaft having the big pulley can be rotated manually in case of electricity failure or if the machine is being used in rural/remote areas.<br>
Detailed Description regarding the Present Invention<br>
The Dual purpose rotary huller according to a preferred embodiment is herein described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein;<br>
Fig. 1 shows the perspective view of the rotary huller Fig. 2 shows the perspective view of solid bar/rod<br><br>
Fig.3 shows the top view of the rotary hulter<br>
Referring to the drawings particularly Fig.l.a dual purpose rotary huller has a plurality of hollow cylinders, preferably three cylinders (1) secured on both the sides of a circular disc (2) in a triangle shape. One end of the hollow cylinder (1) is a closed end such that to accommodate the spices to be grounded therein. The other end of the cylinders (1) is provided with threads (3) for securing a cover/cap (4) in order to close the end after feeding the spices in the cylinder (1 ).A solid rod/bar (see Fig 2) is adapted to be placed inside the hollow cylinders (1) for providing hammering effect on the spices filled in the cylinders (1).The circular disc (2) is mounted on a main shaft (5) supported on the main frame (6) rotatably by means of bearings (7) provided in the bearing boxes (8) secured at the top of the main frame (6) on both the sides thereof. A big sprocket (9) is mounted on the main shaft (5) at one side of the circular disc (2) such that to receive the drive from a shaft sprocket (10) by means of a chain (11).The small sprocket (10) is mounted on a shaft (12) supported on one side of the mainframe (6) rotatably by means of bearings assembly (13) secured with the main frame (6) .A pulley (14) is mounted on the shaft (12) such that to receive the drive from a motor (15) by means of a belt (16).The shaft (12) having the big pulley (14) mounted thereon, can be rotated manually with the help of a driving handle (not shown) adapted to be fitted with the extended end (17) of the shaft (12) in case of electricity failure or if the machine is being used in rural/remote areas. The motor (15) is mounted with the lower portion of the frame by means of mounting plate (18) secured with said frame (6).<br>
During the operation of the device the spices of the different kind are filled in different hollow cylinders and the solid bar/rod is placed in the cylinder. The open end of the cylinder is then closed by the cover/cap tightly. The motor is switched on so as to rotate the shaft, on which the disc having the cylinders is secured, with the help of the intermediate transmission means. During rotation the solid rod/bar moves up and down inside the cylinders and provides the hammering effect on to the spices in order to grind/mix the spices in the powder form. The device is operated till the required size of the spices is obtained. Upon completion of the grinding the cap/cover is opened one by one and the ground spices are taken out. It has been observed that the ground spices do not get heated due to the very slow hammering effect inside the cylinder. In fact the<br><br>
grinding principle of the device has been designed on the basis of ancient process of grinding by using imam dusta by our ancestors so as to keep the natural flavours and medicinal properties of the spices intact therewith.<br>
In case of electricity failure or operation of the device in the rural/remote areas a driving handle is fitted at the extended end of the shaft and the shaft is rotated in any direction as per the convenience of the user in order to provide the grinding effect in side the cylinder.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
