				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a<br>
method and apparatus for carburizing, quenching and tempering, and, more particularly, to a method for carburizing, quenching and tempering, by which a step of carburizing can be incorporated into a machining and manufacturing process to be performed by an on-line machining and manufacturing system as one stage thereof, and to an apparatus therefor.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Hitherto, continuous gas carburize/quench furnaces of the tray pusher type or of the roller hearth type have been used as apparatuses for carburizing and quenching, so as to carry out the mass production of (steel) products.    The continuous gas carburize/quench furnace of any of such types usually provides around-the-clock operation in what is called a heat-treating shop, which is away from a machining shop, by being made to be offline from a machining (process)<br>
apparatus.    Further, the furnace has employed a producing method by which a heat treatment is performed according to a batch system that is adapted to set up a large number of workpieces (such as parts), which are to be processed, on trays, respectively.<br>
Meanwhile, the process to be performed by such a conventional continuous gas carburize/quench furnace is composed of steps illustrated in FIG. 10.<br>
Namely, the cutting of the workpieces are first performed in the machining shop.    Subsequently, the cut workpiece is transported from the machining shop to the heat-treating shop which is made to be offline and is away therefrom.    When the workpieces arrive at the heat-treating shop, the set-up step of setting up the workpiece on a tray is performed by jigs.    After cleaning, the workpieces are loaded into the continuous gas carburize/quench furnace.    Thence, the steps of carburizing and quenching are performed in the continuous gas carburize/quench furnace.     Subsequently, the workpieces are cleaned and tempered.    Upon completion of a sequence of heat-treating steps, a step<br>
of taking the workpiece out of the tray and further disassembling the workpiece is performed.    The disassembled workpiece is transported to the machining shop which is made to be offline and is away from the<br>
heat-treating shop.    Thereafter, in the marching shop, the grinding of the workpiece is performed.<br>
The aforementioned process of FIG. 10, which is to be performed in the conventional continuous gas carburize/quench furnace, has the following problems.<br>
i) Because the machining shop is placed apart from the heat-treating shop, a transport system and personnel therefor are needed.    Moreover, it is necessary to stock workpieces, which are to be processed (or treated), for a time period having a predetermined length.<br>
ii) There is the necessity of the set-up step of setting a workpiece on a tray by using a jig so as to charge the workpiece into the furnace.    Moreover, the disassembling step of taking out the workpiece, which has been set on the tray, therefrom is needed upon completion of the heat-treating step.<br>
iii) It takes time to raise and lower the temperature of the workpiece.    The lead time of the heat treatment is long.    Thus, the process from the step of inserting or charging the workpiece into the furnace to the step of extracting thereof from the furnace is time-consuming.<br>
iv) When starting up the furnace, it takes long time to perform seasoning for regulating (or<br>
controlling) the furnace atmosphere.<br>
v) Batch processing results in variation in quality among the heat-treated workpieces.<br>
The present invention is accomplished to solve the aforementioned problems.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a method for carburizing, quenching and tempering workpieces, by which the step of carburizing can be incorporated into a machining and manufacturing process to be performed by an on-line machining and manufacturing system as one stage thereof, and by which high-quality treatment or processing can be achieved without occurrences of variation in quality among heat-treated products.<br>

Moreover, each of the carburizing chambers is provided with a corresponding one of the supporting bases, which is adapted to support the workpieces in an upwardly and downwardly movable manner (incidentally, in FIG. 1, the supporting bases other than the base 14g are not shown), and a corresponding one of the induction heating coils (not shown in FIG. 1) for maintaining the temperature of the workpiece at the carburizing temperature.    Upon completion of the carburization, the workpieces are loaded onto the transport unit 12 and are further transported from the carburizing chambers 5a to 5f to the intermediate camber 4 through the intermediate doors 3a to 3f, respectively.    Incidentally, the supporting bases of the carburizing chambers 5a to 5f are electrically insulated from the chamber walls of the aforesaid carburizing chambers 5a to 5f, respectively.<br>
The cooling chamber 6 is a vacuum-scalable chamber for cooling the workpiece, which is transported by the transport unit 12 from the intermediate chamber 4, to a temperature which is not higher than Al transformation temperature, and has a double wall structure for the<br>
water-cooling of the walls thereof.    Further, the cooling chamber 6 has a supporting base (not shown) for supporting a workpiece in upwardly and downwardly movable manner, and a cooling fan (not shown) for cooling a workpiece, which are provided therein.    Upon completion of the cooling, the workpiece is loaded onto the transport unit 12 and is then transported to the intermediate chamber 4 from the cooling chamber 6 through the intermediate door 3h.<br>
The reheating chamber 7 is a vacuum scalable chamber for quickly heating the workpiece, which is transported from the intermediate chamber 4 by the transport unit 12, to a quenching temperature upon completion of the cooling thereof.    Further, the reheating chamber 7 has a double wall structure for the water-cooling of the walls thereof.    Moreover, the reheating chamber 7 further has a supporting base (not shown) for supporting a workpiece in upwardly and downwardly movable manner, and an induction heating coil (not shown) for reheating a workpiece, which are provided therein.    Upon completion of the reheating, the workpiece is loaded onto the transport unit 12 and is then transported to the intermediate chamber 4 from the reheating chamber 7 through the intermediate door<br>
The quenching chamber 8 is a vacuum scalable chamber for quenching the workpiece, which is transported from the intermediate chamber 4 by the transport unit 12, upon completion of the reheating thereof.    Further, the quenching chamber 8 has a supporting base 15c for supporting a workpiece in an upwardly and downwardly movable manner, which is provided therein.    Upon completion of the quenching, the workpiece is loaded onto the transport unit 13 and is then transported to the tempering chamber 10 from the quenching chamber 8 through the exit door 9.<br>
The tempering chamber 10 is a chamber for tempering the workpiece transported by the transport unit 13 and is provided with a supporting base 16, on which the workpiece is set, and a heating unit for heating the workpiece to a tempering temperature. Tempering is performed in the atmosphere (namely, in the air).    Thus, similarly as in the case of this embodiment, the tempering chamber 10 is configured in such a manner as to be opened to the atmosphere and is not allowed to take the form of an enclosure.    Upon completion of the tempering, the workpiece is loaded onto the transport unit 13 and is further transported to the machining shop for performing the next step.<br>
Thus, the aforementioned apparatus for<br>
carburizing, quenching and tempering according to this embodiment of the present invention has the configuration in which the preheating chamber 2, the carburizing chambers 5a to 5f, the cooling chamber 6, the reheating chamber 7 and the quenching chamber 8, each of which is a vacuum scalable chamber, are connected through the intermediate doors 3a to 3j with one another and are placed around the intermediate chamber 4.<br>
Hereinafter, an operation of the apparatus for carburizing, quenching and tempering the workpieces, which has such a configuration, will be described in detail by referring to FIG. 3.<br>
In the case of the time chart of FIG. 3, it is assumed that the machining time per workpiece is 4 minutes and that the carburizing time at a temperature of 1100 degrees centigrade is 22 minutes and 45 seconds, on the supposition that the effective case depth required of the workpiece is 0.5 to 0.8 mm.<br>
First, after machining oil having adhered to one or more workpieces, which are machined by the machining apparatus, is cleaned, the workpieces are carried into the preheating chamber 2 through the entrance door 1 by the transport unit 11 (at time 0).<br>
The workpiece carried thereinto is set at the<br>
supporting base 14g.    Then, this workpiece is raised (or elevated) by the supporting base 14g up to a predetermined position where the workpiece is preheated.    Subsequently, the entrance door 1 is closed.    Further, air and gases are removed from the preheating chamber 2 by vacuum-pumping till the internal pressure of the preheating chamber 2 becomes 1 Pa or so (namely, reaches a pressure which is small to the extent that the workpiece does not undergo oxidation at the carburizing temperature).    Then, the workpiece is quickly heated by an induction (magnetic) field which is caused by passing a high-frequency electric current, whose frequency is equal to or higher than 0.5 Hz but is equal to or less than 3 kHz, through the induction heating coil 17.    When the temperature of the workpiece reaches the carburizing temperature which is not lower than the Al transformation point (or temperature), the workpiece is maintained at this carburizing temperature until the processing to be performed in the next step is commenced.     If the intermediate chamber 4 and the carburizing chamber (namely, one of the chambers 5a to 5f) are empty, the passage of the high-frequency electric current is stopped.    Then, the intermediate door 3g is opened. Thus, the workpiece is transported to the intermediate<br>
chamber 4 by the transport unit 12 through the intermediate door 3g (at time 3.25 (min.)).<br>
From the intermediate chamber 4, air and gases are exhausted until the (internal) pressure thereof becomes 1 Pa or so (namely, reaches a pressure which is small to the extent that the workpiece does not undergo oxidation).    The workpieces transported from the preheating chamber 2 by the transport unit 12 are carried into the corresponding one of the carburizing chambers 5a to 5f through the corresponding one of the intermediate doors 3a to 3f.    Here, it is assumed that the workpiece is charged into the carburizing chamber 5a (at time 3.75 (min.)).    At that time, another workpiece having been machined by the machining apparatus is simultaneously carried into the preheating chamber 2 through the entrance door 1 after cleaned. In this way, the workpieces are carried into the preheating chamber 2 from the machining apparatus with no waiting (or wait) time (namely, a waiting time is 0) by controlling the carrying timing according to the machining time.<br>
From the carburizing chamber 5a, air and gases are exhausted until the (internal) pressure thereof becomes 1 Pa or so (namely, reaches a pressure which is small to the extent that the workpiece does not undergo<br>
oxidation).    The workpiece transported from the intermediate chamber 4 is set on the supporting base (not shown).    Then, this supporting base is raised to the predetermined position where the workpiece is carburized.    Further, the intermediate door 3a is closed.    Subsequently, the workpiece is maintained at the carburizing temperature by an induction (magnetic) field by passing a high-frequency electric current, whose frequency is equal to or higher than 0.5 kHz but is equal to or less than 3 kHz, through the induction heating coil (not shown).    At that time, a carrier gas is introduced into the carburizing chamber 5a through a gas manifold (not shown).    Here, note that the carrier gas is a carbon containing gas, for instance, a single-substance gas of hydrocarbon, such as C3H8,<br>
alternatively, a mixed gas containing gaseous hydrocarbon and one or two kinds of inert gases, such as Ar, and gaseous hydrogen (H2)-    The carrier gas is<br>
injected into the carburizing chamber 5a at a predetermined flow rate.    Thereafter, when the (internal) pressure of the carburizing chamber 5a reaches the predetermined pressure (approximately in the 1 X 101- to 2.6X 103-Pa range) by controlling amounts of air and gases exhausted therefrom), a d.c. current or a pulse d.c. current is passed therethrough by<br>
employing the wall of the carburizing chamber 5a as an anode, and employing the supporting base (not shown) as a cathode.    Further, a voltage, by which a glow discharge can be caused, is applied thereacross.    Upon completion of the carburization, the introduction of the carrier gas, the passage of the glow-discharge electric current and the passage of the high-frequency current through the induction heating coil (not shown) are stopped.    Then, air and gasses are exhausted from the carburizing chamber by vacuum-pumping until the internal pressure of the carburizing chamber is reduced to a predetermined pressure which is in the 1-Pa range. Subsequently, the intermediate door 3a is opened. Further, the transport unit 12 is inserted into the carburizing chamber 5a.    Then, the supporting base is lowered.    Thus, the workpiece is transported by the transport unit 12 into the intermediate chamber 4 through the intermediate door 3a (at time 26.5 (min.)).<br>
From the intermediate chamber 4, air and gases are exhausted by vacuum-pumping until the (internal) pressure thereof becomes 1 Pa or so (namely, reaches the pressure which is small to the extent that the workpiece does not undergo oxidation).    The workpiece transported by the transport unit 12 from the carburizing chamber 5a is carried into the.cooling<br>
chamber 6 through the intermediate door 3h and is then set (at time 27 (min.)) on the supporting base (not shown).<br>
From the cooling chamber 6, air and gases are exhausted by vacuum-pumping until the (internal) pressure thereof becomes 1 Pa or so (namely, reaches the pressure which is small to the extent that the workpiece does not undergo oxidation).    Then, the workpiece is put on the supporting base in the cooling chamber 6.    When the intermediate door 3h is closed, the internal pressure of the cooling chamber 6 is increased to a pressure, which is not lower than a atmospheric pressure, by using inert gases such as N2 gas.    Subsequently, the cooling fan (not shown) provided in the cooling chamber 6 is activated, so that the inert gas encapsulated in the cooling chamber 6 circulates therethrough.    Heat is then exchanged between the workpiece and the wall of the double wall structure, which is cooled by water, of the cooling chamber 6 through the inert gas.    Thus, the workpiece is cooled to a temperature which is not higher than Al transformation temperature.    Upon completion of the cooling, the cooling fan is stopped and air and gasses are removed by vacuum-pumping until the internal pressure of the cooling chamber 6 becomes a<br>
predetermined pressure of 1 Pa or so (namely, reaches the pressure which is small to the extent that the workpiece does not undergo oxidation).    Subsequently, the intermediate door 3h is opened.    Then, the transport unit 12 is inserted (or loaded) into the cooling chamber 6.     Further, the supporting base is lowered.    Thus, the workpiece is transported to the intermediate chamber 4 through the intermediate door 3h (at time 29.75 (min.)).<br>
Then, air and gases are exhausted from the intermediate chamber 4 by vacuum-pumping until the (internal) pressure thereof becomes 1 Pa or so (namely, reaches the pressure which is small to the extent that the workpiece does not undergo oxidation).    The workpiece transported by the transport unit 12 from the cooling chamber 6 is carried into the reheating chamber 7 through the intermediate door 3i and is then set (at time 30.25 (min.)) on the supporting base (not shown) provided in the chamber 7.<br>
From the reheating chamber 7, air and gases are removed by vacuum-pumping till the internal pressure of the reheating chamber 7 becomes 1 Pa or so (namely, reaches a pressure which is small to the extent that the workpiece does not undergo oxidation).    Then, the workpiece is quickly heated by an induction (magnetic)<br>
field which is caused by passing a high-frequency electric current, whose frequency is equal to or higher than 0.5 kHz but is equal to or less than 3 kHz, through the induction heating coil 19.    When the temperature of the workpiece reaches the quenching temperature which is not lower than the Al transformation point (or temperature), the workpiece is maintained at this quenching temperature until the processing to be performed in the next step is commenced.    When the maintaining of the quenching temperature is finished and further, the passage of the high-frequency electric current through the induction heating coil (not shown) is stopped, and then, the intermediate door 3i is opened, the workpiece is taken out therefrom to the intermediate chamber 4 by the transport unit 12 through the intermediate door 3i (at time 33 (min.)).<br>
Then, air and gases are exhausted from the intermediate chamber 4 by vacuum-pumping until the (internal) pressure thereof becomes 1 Pa or so (namely, reaches the pressure which is small to the extent that the workpiece does not undergo oxidation at the quenching temperature).    The workpiece transported by the transport unit 12 from the reheating chamber 7 is carried into the quenching chamber 8 through the<br>
intermediate door 3j and is then set (at time 33.5 (min.)) on the supporting base 15c provided in the chamber 8.<br>
From the quenching chamber 8, air and gases are exhausted by vacuum-pumping until the (internal) pressure thereof is in the 1 Pa range (namely, reaches the pressure which is small to the extent that the workpiece does not undergo oxidation at the quenching temperature).    When the supporting base 15c, on which the workpiece is put on, is set on a predetermined place, the intermediate door 3j is closed and the quenching of the workpiece is performed.    When performing the quenching, one kind of oil, water and gasses (including a liquefied gas) is employed as the refrigerant in atmospheres of inert gases such as N2 gas<br>
under a reduced pressure or under an atmospheric pressure.    For example, in the case of the quenching by using the gas as illustrated in this figure, the quenching chamber 8 is filled with the inert gases such<br>
as N2 gas and He gas, at a pressure which is not lower than an atmospheric pressure.    Subsequently, the cooling fan 21 provided in the quenching chamber 8 is activated, so that the inert gas encapsulated in the quenching chamber 8 circulates therethrough.     Heat is then exchanged between the workpiece and the wall of<br>
the double wall structure, which is cooled by water, of the quenching chamber 8 through the inert gas.    Thus, the workpiece is quickly cooled and quenched. Incidentally,    a single-substance gas of H2,<br>
alternatively, a mixed gas containing gaseous hydrogen H2 and one or two kinds of inert gases may be used as the refrigerant gas, instead of a mixed gas containing one or two kinds of inert gases.    Upon completion of the cooling, the cooling fan 21 is stopped and the refrigerant gas is released or emitted to the outside quenching chamber 8 until the internal pressure thereof becomes equal to the atmospheric pressure. Subsequently, the exit door 9 is opened.    Then, the transport unit 13 is inserted (or loaded) into the quenching chamber 8.    Further, the supporting base 15c is lowered.    Thus, the workpiece is transported to the outside of the quenching chamber 8 through the exit door 13 (at time 35 (min.)).<br>
In the tempering chamber 10, the tempering is<br>
performed in the atmosphere (namely, in the ambient air).    Thus, in the case of this embodiment, the tempering chamber 10 does not take the form of an enclosure but is opened to the atmosphere.     The workpiece set on the supporting base 16 by the transport unit 13 is quickly heated to a preset<br>
tempering temperature (in the range between 150 and 250 degrees centigrade) according to an induction heating (method), a direct energization heating (method) or a far infrared radiation heating (method).    Further, the workpiece is maintained at the tempering temperature for a time period having a predetermined length. Thereby, the tempering of the workpiece is performed. Thereafter, upon completion of the tempering of the workpiece, the workpiece is put on the transport unit 13 and is subsequently transported to the machining apparatus for carrying out processing to be performed in the next step.<br>
As described above, this embodiment of the present invention is provided with six carburizing chambers. Further, this embodiment is adapted so that the carburization of workpieces is performed by serially distributing the workpieces to the carburizing chambers.    Thus, the process consisting of steps of carburizing, quenching and tempering workpieces is performed on the same line as a line on which the machining is performed by the machining apparatus. Thereby, the transport, set-up and disassembling of workpieces are unnecessary.    Moreover, it is unnecessary to stock workpieces.     Furthermore, in accordance with this embodiment, the initiation and<br>
termination of the manufacturing of products can be achieved by turning on and off a switch provided in the apparatus, respectively.    Additionally, there is no necessity of the around-the-clock operation, differently from the conventional apparatus.    Besides, in the case of this embodiment, one workpiece or a small number of workpieces can be serially processed or treated.    As a result of serially processing the workpieces one by one, variation in quality among heated workpieces can be reduced exceedingly, in comparison with a method by which a large number of workpieces should be processed at a time, similarly as in the case of the conventional batch system.<br>
Besides, as is seen (or understood) from FIG. 4, the method for carburizing, quenching and tempering workpieces, which consisting of the steps illustrated in this figure, is considerably simplified, in comparison with the steps of the conventional method illustrated in FIG. 10.<br>
Further, the aforementioned embodiment has a configuration in which the preheating chamber, the carburizing chambers, the cooling chamber, the preheating chamber and the quenching chamber are connected with one another and placed around the intermediate chambers.     However, as illustrated in the<br>
schematic plan diagram of FIG. 5, the following configuration may be adopted.    Namely, the preheating chamber 2, the carburizing chambers 5a to 5f and the cooling chamber 6 are connected with one another around the intermediate chamber 4.    Further, the reheating chamber 7 is connected to the cooling chamber 6. Moreover, the quenching chamber 8 is connected to the reheating chamber 7.    Incidentally, in this case, a transport unit 131 for transporting a workpiece, which has been placed in the cooling chamber 6, to the reheating chamber 7, and a transport unit 132 for transporting a workpiece, which has been placed in the reheating chamber 7, to the quenching chamber 8 are provided in the apparatus.<br>
Additionally, in the case of the aforementioned embodiment, the cooling chamber 6 and the reheating chamber 7 are provided in the apparatus so as to fine or reduce the grain size (number) of a workpiece. However, in the case of treating workpieces at a lower temperature at which the grain size thereof is not<br>
increased (namely, the workpieces cannot be coarsened), the cooling chamber 6 and the reheating chamber 7 may be removed from the apparatus as illustrated in the schematic plan diagram of FIG. 6.<br>

Further, a transport fork 216 for carrying workpieces into the preheating chamber 22 through the entrance door 21 is provided in the vicinity of the preheating chamber 22.    Further, transport forks 218a to 218f, each of which is used for taking in workpieces to and taking out workpieces from a corresponding one of transport units 217 and 219 in the intermediate chamber 24, are provided in the carburizing chambers 27a to 27f.    Moreover, a transport fork 220 for transporting workpieces to the tempering chamber 214 is provided with the quenching chamber 211.    Furthermore, a transport fork 222 for carrying out workpieces from the tempering chamber 214 is provided in the proximity of the exit door 215.    Incidentally, the drawing of a vacuum pumping system, a gas injection (or introduction) system and a power supply system is omitted.<br>
The preheating chamber 22 is a vacuum-sealable<br>
chamber used to receive workpieces, which have been machined by a machining apparatus (not shown) and transported by the transport fork 216, through the entrance door 21 and to rapidly heat the received workpieces to the carburizing temperature.    Further, the preheating chamber 22 has a double wall structure for the water-cooling of the walls thereof and is provided with the transport unit 217 for supporting and transporting workpieces to the intermediate chamber 24, and the induction heating coil 23 for preheating the workpiece are provided therein.    As will be described later, the preheated workpiece is conveyed to the intermediate chamber 24 through the intermediate door 25.<br>
The intermediate chamber 24 is a vacuum-scalable chamber that is needed as a relay chamber when transporting workpieces from the preheating chamber 22 to the carburizing chambers 27a to 27f or when each of the carburizing chambers to the quenching chamber 211. Further, the intermediate chamber 24 receives the preheated workpieces through the intermediate door 25 and serially transports the workpieces to the carburizing chambers 27a to 27f through the intermediate doors 26a to 26f by putting the workpieces on the transport forks 218a and so on (incidentally,<br>
the drawing of the transport forks corresponding to the carburizing chambers 27b to 27f), respectively.    As will be described later, the intermediate chamber 24 receives the workpieces, which are conveyed from the carburizing chambers 27a to 27f through the intermediate doors 26a to 26f, respectively, and have been carburized.    Further, the intermediate chamber 24 is adapted to put the workpieces on the transport unit 219 and carry the workpieces into the quenching chamber 211 through the intermediate door 210.<br>
The carburizing chambers 27a to 27f are vacuum-scalable chambers for carburizing the workpieces transported thereto by the transport fork 218a and so forth, respectively.    Further, these carburizing chambers have double wall structures for the water-cooling of the walls thereof.    Moreover, each of the carburizing chambers is provided with a corresponding one of the supporting bases 29a and so forth, which is adapted to support the workpieces in an upwardly and downwardly movable manner (incidentally, in FIG. 7, the drawing of the supporting bases corresponding to the carburizing chambers 27b to 27f is omitted), and a corresponding one of the induction heating coils 28a and so on (incidentally, the drawing of induction heating coils corresponding to the carburizing chambers<br>

Upon completion of the carburization, the workpieces are loaded onto the transport forks and are further transported from the carburizing chambers 27a to 27f to the intermediate camber 24 through the intermediate doors 26a to 26f, respectively. Incidentally, the supporting bases of the carburizing chambers 27a to 27f are electrically insulated from the chamber walls of the aforesaid carburizing chambers 27a to 27f, respectively.<br>
The quenching chamber 211 is a vacuum scalable chamber for quenching the workpiece, which is transported by the transport fork 219 that is provided therein and further serves as a supporting base for supporting the workpiece.     Further, the quenching chamber 8 has a nozzle 212 for cooling the workpiece therein.     Upon completion of the quenching, the workpiece is loaded onto the transport fork 220 and is then transported to the tempering chamber 214 from the quenching chamber 211 through the intermediate door 213.<br>
The tempering chamber 214 is a vacuum scalable chamber for tempering the workpiece transported by the transport fork 220 and is provided with a supporting<br>
base 221 for supporting a workpiece in an upwardly and downwardly movable manner, and with an induction heating coil 214a for heating the workpiece.    Upon completion of the tempering, the workpiece is loaded onto the transport unit 222 and is further transported to the machining shop for performing the next step through the exit door 215.<br>
Thus, the aforementioned apparatus for carburizing, quenching and tempering according to this embodiment of the present invention has the configuration, wherein the preheating chamber 22, the carburizing chambers 27a to 27f, the quenching chamber 211 and the tempering chamber 214, which are vacuum scalable chambers, are connected through the intermediate doors 25, 26a to 26f, 210 and 213 with one another, and wherein the intermediate chamber 24 is placed just under the preheating chamber 21 and further, the quenching chamber 211 is placed just under the intermediate chamber 24.    Moreover, the six carburizing chambers 27a to 27f are placed around the intermediate chamber 24 substantially at a same height-as of the intermediate chamber 24.    Furthermore, the tempering chamber 214 is placed nearly at a same height as of the quenching chamber 211.<br>
Hereinafter, an operation of the apparatus for<br>
carburizing, quenching and tempering the workpieces, which has such a configuration, will be described in detail by referring to a time chart of FIG. 9.<br>
In the case of the time chart of FIG. 9, it is assumed that the machining time per workpiece  is 3 minutes and that the carburizing time at a temperature of 950 degrees centigrade is 15 minutes, on the supposition that the effective case depth required of each workpiece is 0.3 to 0.5 mm.<br>
First, after machining oil having adhered to workpieces, which are machined by the machining    ' apparatus, is cleaned, the workpieces are carried into the preheating chamber 22 through the entrance door 21 by the transport fork 216 (at time 0).<br>
The workpiece carried thereinto is set at the transport unit 217 that further serves as a supporting base.    Then, this workpiece is raised (or elevated) by the transport unit 217 up to a predetermined position where the workpiece is preheated.    Subsequently, the entrance door 21 is closed.     Further, air and gases are removed from the preheating chamber 22 by vacuum-pumping till the internal pressure of the preheating chamber 22 becomes 1 Pa or so (namely, reaches a pressure which is small to the extent that the workpiece does not undergo oxidation).     Then, the<br>
workpiece is quickly heated by an induction (magnetic) field which is caused by passing a high-frequency electric current, whose frequency is equal to or higher than 0.5 kHz but is equal to or less than 3 kHz, through the induction heating coil 23.    When the temperature of the workpiece reaches the carburizing temperature which is not lower than the Al transformation point (or temperature), the workpiece is maintained at this carburizing temperature until the processing to be performed in the next step is commenced.    If the intermediate chamber 24 and the carburizing chamber (namely, one of the chambers 27a to 27f) are empty, the passage of the high-frequency electric current is stopped.    Then, the transport unit 217 is lowered.    Thus, the workpiece is transported to the intermediate chamber 24 through the intermediate door 25.<br>
From the intermediate chamber 24, air and gases are exhausted until the (internal) pressure thereof becomes 1 Pa or so (namely, reaches a pressure which is small to the extent thgrrthe workpiece does not undergo oxidation).    The workpieces transported from the preheating chamber 22 are carried into the corresponding one of the carburizing chambers 27a to 27f by the transport forks 218a to 218f through the<br>
corresponding one of the intermediate doors 26a to 26f. Here, it is assumed that the workpiece is charged into the carburizing chamber 27a (at time 3 (min.)).    At that time, another workpiece having been machined by the machining apparatus is simultaneously carried into the preheating chamber 22 through the entrance door 21 after cleaned.    In this way, the workpieces are carried into the preheating chamber 22 from the machining apparatus with no waiting (or wait) time (namely, a waiting time is 0) by controlling the carrying timing according to the machining time.<br>
From the carburizing chamber 27a, air and gases are exhausted until the (internal) pressure thereof becomes 1 Pa or so (namely, reaches a pressure which is small to the extent that the workpiece does not undergo oxidation).    The workpiece transported from the intermediate chamber 24 is set on the supporting base 29a.    Then, the workpiece is raised by the supporting base 29a to the predetermined position where the workpiece is carburized.    Subsequently, the workpiece is maintained at the carburizing temperature by an induction (magnetic) field by passing a high-frequency electric current, whose frequency is equal to or higher than 0.5 kHz but is equal to or less than 3 kHz, through the induction heating coil 28a.    -Simultaneously<br>
with this, the intermediate door 26a is closed.    At that time, a carrier gas is introduced into the carburizing chamber 27a through a gas manifold (not shown).    Here, note that the carrier gas is a carbon containing gas, for instance, a single-substance gas of hydrocarbon, such as C3H8, alternatively, a mixed gas<br>
containing gaseous hydrocarbon and one or two kinds of inert gases, such as Ar, and gaseous hydrogen (H2).    The<br>
carrier gas is injected into the carburizing chamber 27a at a predetermined flow rate.    Thereafter, when the (internal) pressure of the carburizing chamber 27a reaches the predetermined pressure (approximately in the 1X l0l- to 2.6X 103-Pa range) by controlling amounts of air and gases exhausted therefrom), a d.c. current or a pulse d.c. current is passed therethrough by employing the wall of the carburizing chamber 27a as an anode, and employing the supporting base 29a as a cathode.     Further, a voltage, by which a glow discharge can be caused, is applied thereacross.    Upon completion of the carburization, the introduction of the carrier gas, the passage of the glow-discharge electric current and the passage of the high-frequency current through the induction heating coil (not shown) are stopped. Then, air and gasses are exhausted from the carburizing chamber 27a by vacuum-pumping until the internal<br>
pressure of the carburizing chamber is reduced to 1-Pa or so, which is a preset pressure.    Subsequently, the intermediate door 26a is opened.    Further, the passage of the high-frequency current to the induction heating coil 28a is stopped.    Then, the supporting base 29a is lowered.    Thus, the workpiece is transported by the transport fork 218a into the intermediate chamber 24 through the intermediate door 26a.<br>
From the intermediate chamber 24, air and gases are exhausted by vacuum-pumping until the (internal) pressure thereof becomes 1 Pa or so (namely, reaches the pressure which is small to the extent that the workpiece does not undergo oxidation).    The workpiece transported from the carburizing chamber 27a is put on the transport unit 219 having been raised from the quenching chamber 211.    As a result of lowering the transport unit 219, the workpiece put thereon is carried into the quenching chamber 211 through the intermediate door 210.<br>
From the quenching chamber 211, air and gases are exhausted by vacuum-pumping—until the (internal) pressure thereof becomes 1 Pa or so (namely, reaches the pressure which is small to the extent that the workpiece does not undergo oxidation at the quenching temperature).     When the workpiece put on the transport<br>
unit 219, which further serves as a supporting base, is rapidly cooled by a refrigerant sprayed by the nozzle 212 placed in such a manner as to uniformly envelope the workpiece.    Thereby, the workpiece is quenched.    At that time, the quenching of the workpiece is performed in atmospheres of inert gases such as N2 gas under a<br>
reduced pressure or under an atmospheric pressure. Further, one of oil, water and gasses (including a liquefied gas) is employed as the refrigerant.    After the quenching of the workpiece is finished, the supporting base 219 descends and the workpiece is put on the transport fork 220.    Then, the workpiece is transported to the tempering chamber 214 through the intermediate door 213.<br>
When reaching the tempering chamber 214, the workpiece is set on the supporting base 221. Subsequently, the supporting base 221 is raised to the predetermined position where the workpiece is heated. Then, the tempering of the workpiece is performed.    At that time, the tempering thereof is performed by quickly heating the workpiece up to a preset tempering temperature (150 to 250 degrees centigrade) by the use of an induction heating coil 214a (incidentally, a direct energization heating (method) or a far infrared radiation heating (method) may be employed, instead of<br>
this coil) under a reduced pressure or under an atmospheric pressure and by further maintaining the workpiece at the tempering temperature for a time period having a predetermined length.    Thereafter, upon completion of the tempering of the workpiece, the supporting base 221, on which the workpiece is put, moves down.    Then, the workpiece is put on the transport fork 222 and is subsequently transported through the exit door 215 to the machining apparatus for carrying out processing to be performed in the next step.<br>
As described above, this embodiment (namely, "Embodiment 2") of the present invention has advantages similar to those of "Embodiment 1".    In addition, in the case of Embodiment 2, the transport unit is provided correspondingly to almost all of the chambers, respectively, so that a quick transport can be achieved.    Therefore, as compared with the case of "Embodiment 1", the treating (or processing) tact time can be shortened in the case of "Embodiment 2".<br>
Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described above, it should be understood that the present invention is not limited thereto and that other modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the<br>
spirit of the invention.    For example, in the case of each of the aforementioned embodiments of the present invention, the carburizing process is performed by inserting (or loading) into the carburizing chamber one by one.    However, the carburizing process may be performed by simultaneously inserting a small number of workpieces into the carburizing chamber.    Furthermore, although each of the aforementioned embodiments of the present invention is provided with six carburizing chambers, one quenching chamber, one reheating chamber and one tempering chamber, the number of the chambers of such kinds may be determined optionally or arbitrarily by taking into account the machining time required to machine a single workpiece.<br>
