FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method of TG stator with winding composed<br>
of end connection in Double Roebel bars made by split turns phase connection<br>
eye joints to achieve optimal size of the machine and higher functional efficiency.<br>
The proposed end winding of TG stator is applicable to 18-25 MV machines.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Medium and large capacity generators stator coils are manufactured as an<br>
universal practice in half coil/bar form by all manufactures throughout the world.<br>
This is normally done keeping the size and weight of the bars in view as well as<br>
the ease of insertion of the coils/bars in the stator slots. During the process of<br>
winding assembly, the coils are placed/lowered in to the stator slots as per the<br>
winding scheme. Subsequently, the bars are electrically connected by<br>
soldering/brazing process to form phase groups.<br><br>
The individual end winding connections for a regular large capacity synchronous<br>
turbo generator stator is made either with strip to strip brazing or bunch brazing<br>
with or without a copper lug. Some manufacturers also practise soldering with a<br>
lug. All these practices depend upon the decision of techno-economics of end<br>
winding loss and cost involved in end winding connections.<br>
In the existing system of eye joint brazing in Turbo generators stator winding<br>
follow either strip to strip resistance brazing where the number of eye joints are<br>
same as those of number of slots on each side of the machine / winding.<br>
The major constrain in the existing sandwich winding practice is in end winding<br>
connection and the sizes of the machines are big with difficulties of<br>
transportation, high material cost and non-optimized magnetic loss.<br>
The proposed invention is aimed to solve the above difficulties of the prior state<br>
of art to develop a compact machine with optimized copper losses by<br>
employment of splitting the eye connection in connection side and making<br>
double tier connection of the turns in non-connection size.<br>
No prior art reference has been formed in the proposed field of development.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
One of the objective of the invention is to provide a split between two turns of<br>
each top and bottom bar while effecting end winding connection between the<br>
two bars of the stator.<br>
Another objective of the invention is to maintain split turns circumferentially and<br>
axially displaced from each other in connection side to facilitate gaps between<br>
the two eye connections and thus to enable brazing of end winding connection.<br>
A still another objective of the invention is to construct the eye joints with strip<br>
to strip brazing to minimize the eye joint copper losses during machine operation<br>
ensuring minimum heat generation during brazing process and thus minimizing<br>
adverse effect on insulation of the bars.<br>
A further objective of the invention is to construct eye joints on the non-<br>
connection side in two tier i.e. outer turn of the eye joint above the inner one.<br><br>
A still further objective of the invention is to construct a double Roebel bar for<br>
the stator winding to optimize machine size with higher terminal voltage with<br>
lesser magnetic loading due to optimal size of the core, the machine length being<br>
reduced by 20% and end winding losses by 10% from the existing double Roebel<br>
bar generator stator.<br>
A yet another objective of the invention is to provide eye joints on the<br>
connection side of the machine twice the number of those of the slots, but<br>
making the total extent of eye brazing work same.<br>
The proposed invention is aimed with the above mentioned objectives of the<br>
invention to develop an improved compact machine with a double Roebel bar<br>
design of stator, by removing the major constraint in the sandwich design in end<br>
winding connection.<br>
In the present method, a double Roebel bar was designed for the stator winding<br>
to optimize the machine size. The individual turn has several insulated copper<br>
strips which are Roebel transposed for 360 degrees. The twin turns require a<br>
split in the eye join zone to make the connection between truns from one slot to<br>
another. However, as the size of the individual turn being very large, the end<br><br>
connection is not possible with the number of eyes same as those of the number<br>
of slots. Hence, a new end connection detail was designed to meet the<br>
requirement, by splitting the eye connection in connection side and making<br>
double tier connection of the turns in non-connection side.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a method of producing turbo<br>
generator stator with winding composed of end connection in Double Roebel<br>
bars comprising of making split between two turns of each top and bottom bar,<br>
each turn having several insulated copper strips being Roebel transposed for 360<br>
degrees; maintaining the split turns circumferentially and axially displaced from<br>
each other on connection side to facilitate gaps between two eye connections;<br>
constructing eye joints with strips to strip resistance brazing to minimize the eye<br>
joint copper losses during machine operation; constructing eye joints on the non-<br>
connection side in two tier by maintaining outer turn of an eye joint above the<br>
inner one; providing eye joints on the connection side of the stator twice the<br>
number of those of the slots, but making the total extent of eye brazing same as<br>
number of slots, to form a double Roebel bar wound stator with optimized<br>
machine size with higher terminal voltage and lesser magnetic loading due to<br>
optimal size of the core and higher P/W (power / weight) ratio of the machine.<br><br>

Figure 4 shows the scheme of stator winding<br>
with the following technical data<br>
The stator winding scheme has been designed with 2 pole, 3000 rpm, star<br>
connected, 3 phase double layer lap mode with the following technical<br>
specification:<br>
No. of slots : 42<br>
No. of poles : 2<br>
No. of phases : 3<br>
No of slots/poles/phase : 7<br>
Pitch : 17/21<br>
No. of parallel paths : 2<br>
Connection : Y<br><br>
The double bars details shown in Figure 1 are as follows<br>
No. of strips : 2x 18 all insulated 2.15 x 9.75, pitch : 17/21, Involute:<br>
13/20 Degrees, No. of turns/bar: 2<br>
Roebel Transposition : 360 degrees.<br>
The stator bars are with two turns, individual turns are with insulated strips,<br>
which are transposed for 360 degrees. Turns are individually insulated before<br>
being stacked one above other and the turns are with inner potential grading.<br>
Overall insulation is provided for ground wall of the bars for the rated voltage of<br>
the machine.<br>
Main Components of a Bar:<br>
Bars are components of generator stator windings, also called conductors to<br>
carry current to be delivered to the output leads and subsequently to the<br>
transmission lines through transformer. The bars of large machines are made of<br>
several insulated copper conductors electrically isolated from each other by<br>
suitable materials before application of high voltage insulation. The insulation of<br>
the strips are normally glass based and the high voltage insulation is usually mica<br>
glass epoxy based to meet the voltage stress requirement.<br><br>
Roebel Bars as conductors are illustrated in Figure 7.<br>
The name Roebel is derived from the inventor Mr. Robert Roebel, the British<br>
Scientist and Engineer, who invented the concept of transposition of strips in a<br>
plaited way to equalize the flux linkage among all the strips irrespective of their<br>
differential radial distance from the flux generating plane. This results in equal<br>
induced voltage generation among all the strips of the bar and avoid inter strip<br>
circulating short circuiting current. In a Roebel bar, all the strips travel from top<br>
to bottom and then up to the original top level (As done in plaiting of the hair<br>
strands of women). This is called 360 degrees transposition. Depending upon the<br>
requirement, the transposition may be repeated or may be continuous in the<br>
active length of the machine.<br>
Normally the Roebel Bar design of the stator are used for medium sized high<br>
voltage generator stator winding. In such case, either single or double layer star<br>
connected lap winding design is adopted. In case of the Roebel bars, several<br>
insulated copper strips aretransposed in single/two planes to minimize the<br><br>
copper losses due to any possible difference in the induced electro motive force<br>
(EMF) among the copper strips. In smaller machines with limitation of magnetic<br>
loading with higher terminal voltage requirement, the winding is designed with<br>
multi turn bars. In the present design of the machine, both the design concepts<br>
of Roebel transposition and multiturn winding features are integrated to achieve<br>
optimal size of the machine. A novel attempt has been made to make the end<br>
connection of the double turn Roebel bar with optimal use of copper and minimal<br>
eye connection losses, which has been illustrated in Figure 1.<br>
Details of the End winding Connection<br>
1.	The function of end connection of the winding is to complete the winding<br>
scheme as per the design requirement with minimum copper and<br>
maximum rigidity.<br>
2.	The end connections of (i) Regular mid phase eye joints and (ii) Phase<br>
connection eye joint have been specially constructed with split turns to<br>
make the double Roebel bars connected as per the winding scheme,<br>
which have been illustrated in Figures 2 and 3 and Figures 7 to 10.<br><br>
3.	The number of eye joints are made twice the number of those of slots to<br>
make the scheme possible.<br>
4.	Necessary axial gap between phase connectors is provided to withstand<br>
the voltage stress.<br>
Overhang eye connection details for single roebel. bars and details of overhang<br>
for Double roebel bars, both with strip to strip brazing/lug brazing have been<br>
illustrated in Figures 5 and 6 respectively.<br>
Keeping the basic objective of optimization of the machine size, the double<br>
Roebel bars were constructed for the winding of the turbo generator stator.<br>
The stator bars individual turns were constructed with Roebel transposition of<br>
insulated coppers strips. Necessary inner potential grading system in the main<br>
insulation was provided to keep the voltage stress in the bars minimum.<br><br>
The unique design of double Roebel bars end connection with twice the number<br>
of eye joints was adopted to optimize the machine size. The split turn in the eye<br>
joint of the bars in connection side makes the phase group formation possible<br>
with optimal size of the winding overhang and all the eye joints are<br>
accommodated within the circumference of the winding.<br>
-	The basic principal of end connection of the overhang winding is based on twin<br>
objective of (i) optimal and rigid overhang length and (ii) optimal end winding<br>
losses. This resulted in optimization of size of the generator and higher<br>
efficiency.<br>
-	The number of eye joints made were twice as those of the slots. A split was<br>
envisaged at end connections to ensure separate eye joints. The eye joints were<br>
displaced circumferentially and axially into inner eye joints and outer eye joints<br>
to make the adequate gaps for the work men to make jointing / brazing work.<br>
-	The eye joint was designed with strip to strip resistance brazing to minimize the<br>
joint copper loss and heat generated during the brazing work.<br><br>
- The phase connections were adopted with axial shift at the same<br>
circumferential location with necessary gap between joints to withstand the<br>
voltage stress.<br>
The Double Roebel Bar design of Stator Winding fulfills the following:<br>
-	Generation of higher voltage in lesser active length of the machine.<br>
-	Lesser magnetic losses due to optimal size of the core thus higher<br>
machine efficiency.<br>
-	Higher P/W (Power/Weight) ratio of the machine<br>
The proposed method of end winding connection ensured the possibility of<br>
making winding scheme with twin/double Roebel bars and minimized the end<br>
winding losses. This type of end winding connection is suitable for the range of<br>
machines from 18-25 MW, where the machine length is optimized with<br>
adaptation of twin Roebel bars.<br><br>
The invention as herein narrated with an exemplary embodiment should not be<br>
read and construed in a restrictive manner, as various modifications, alterations<br>
and adaptations are possible with in the scope and ambit of the invention as<br>
