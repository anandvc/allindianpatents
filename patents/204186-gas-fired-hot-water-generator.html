THE PATENTS ACT. 1970 (39 of 1970)<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(Section 10)<br><br><br>
'GAS FIRED HOT WATER GENERATOR"<br>
ASHOK DATTATRAYA ATRE,<br>
'Pushpa Heights', 1st floor, Bibwewadi Corner,<br>
PUNE-411 037. Maharashtra State, India Indian Citizen - Indian Nationality<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br><br>
-7 NOV2000<br><br>
GRANTED<br><br>
7-11-2000<br><br>
This invention relates to a gas fired hot water generator.    The fuel for the gas fired hot water generator is liquefied petroleum gas or compressed natural gas.<br>
Conventionally hot water requirements of establishments like hospitals, laundry, resorts have been catered to so far by :-<br>
1.	Solid fuel, like wood, or agro-based fuel fired inefficient hot water generator.<br>
2.	Oil fired water generator.<br>
3.	Electrically heated hot water generator.<br>
4.	Solar water heater.<br>
5.	Forced draft principle hot water generator.<br>
Taking into consideration the above mentioned hot water generators, following drawbacks are observed: -<br>
1.	Solid fuel like wood/agro based fUel fired hot water generator units being not designed effectively, have low efficiency which results in consumption of valuable natural resources. Again such type of generators pose pollution problems and hence they are banned at places like hill stations. The space required for these type of generators is very large and they necessarily need a large chimney for exhaust gases.<br>
2.	Oil fired hot water generators are not designed specifically to cater to the requirements of this segment because they have their own limitations like need of continuous electric supply.<br>
3.	Solar water heaters are obviously dependent on availability of sun light, which is again not possible all throughout the year, and hence require a standby arrangement; also they cannot meet sudden demand of hot water.<br><br>
4.	Electrically heated hot water generator is subject to its own limitations like high running cost and dependent on availability of electric supply.<br>
5.	Presently available gas fired hot water generators working on forced draft principle cannot cater to the needs in absence of electricity.<br>
Taking into consideration the above mentioned drawbacks, the object of the present invention aims at developing a gas fired hot water generator with a naturally aspiring burner so that no separate combustion air blower is required and which ensures availability of hot water in the absence of electricity.<br>
It is also the object of the present invention to cater to high efficiency of 87 ± 1% ensuring lowest running cost.<br>
It is also the object of the present invention to make the unit compact so that it can be mounted on a single chassis provided with wheels, which makes the unit mobile.<br>
It is also the object of the present invention to develop the unit in such a way that it caters to the needs of the establishments in cheaper and faster rate.<br>
It is also the object of the present invention to provide a battery operated installation in remote areas.<br>
According to the most salient feature of the present invention it is provided with instruments like temperature controller which automatically cuts off the supply of fuel when the desired temperature is achieved and earth leakage circuit breaker to ensure safe installation and operation.<br>
An example of a comparison is given hereunder between electrical heater and gas fired hot water generator (Hot Spring):<br><br>
Electrical Heater	Hot Spring<br>
A)	Installation Basis :<br>
Hotel of 40 rooms<br>
Hot water required 40 Ltrs. per person.<br>
Hot water required 1600 ltrs/day.<br>
B)	Electric Heater<br>
Electrical units required	46.5 KW<br>
Running cost @Rs.5/-Kwh	Rs.  235/-<br>
C)	Gas Fired Hot Spring<br>
Gas consumption	4 kg.<br>
Running Cost* @Rs.24/-kg.*	Rs.96/-<br>
Per day saving by Hot Spring	Rs-50,735/-<br>
Yearly savings	Rs.  50f735/«<br>
* As the compressed natural gas is still cheaper, the yearly savings will be further substantial.<br>
The invention is described with reference to accompanying drawing wherein fig. 1 shows the gas fired hot water generator according to this invention.<br>
Now referring to accompanying figure, the generator consists of a furnace (1) in which the gas burner (2) develops the flame with the help of gas from LPG cylinder or piped gas (3) and the like. Water from the feed water tank (4) enters the jacket (5) at the bottom of the furnace which surrounds the whole furnace (21) from outside. Because of the flame, which is developed due to gas burner (2) inside the furnace (1), the water gets hotter as it rises through the jacket (5). Hereafter the water rises through the finned tube (6) which are located above the furnace (1).   As the exhaust gases pass over the finned<br><br>
tube (6), water gets more hotter and the energy present in the flue or exhaust gases is utilized at its maximum. Sufficient heat transfer area, typical construction of the finned tube (6) allows maximum heat recovery from exhaust gases which results in achieving highest efficiency and ultimately lowest fuel running cost. Because of construction of the finned tube (6) and furnace (1), it allows maximum heat transfer area in very small space resulting in the unit being more compact and lighter. The hot water outlet (7) is at the top of the furnace. The temperature controller (8) is provided inside the control panel (9) attached to the furnace which cut-off the gas supply once the desired temperature is reached. Provision of earth leakage circuit breaker (10) ensures safe installation and operation. This provision of ELCB ensures switching off the unit in case of current leakage. The outer casing (11) of the water jacket (5) houses the unit and is insulated with insulation material which minimizes the heat losses.<br>
DETAILS OF FIGURE : Furnace 1 Gas Burner 2 LPG/Pipe 3 Feed Water Tank 4 Jacket 5 Finned Tube 6 Hot Water Outlet 7 Temperature Controller 8 Control Panel 9 ELCB 10 Outer Casing 11<br>
According to the present invention, therefore, it provides a gas fired hot water generator which comprises of a furnace with gas burner, connected to LPG cylinder/piped gas, inside the furnace and finned tubes provided above the furnace; the said furnace is completely surrounded by water jacket having inlet at the bottom which is connected to feed water tank and outlet at the top; the said jacket is insulated from<br><br><br>
outside to minimize the heat losses; the said furnace is mounted with control panel which consists of a temperature controller to cut-off the gas and earth leakage circuit breaker to switch-off the unit in case of current leakage.<br>
ADVANTAGES :<br>
•	High efficiency of 87% ensures lowest running cost.   Unit being automatic, fuel consumption is directly proportional to the actual hot water consumption.<br>
•	Saves 60% as compared to electrical heating or 50% as compared to conventional open burner heating.<br>
•	Hot water is available even if electricity is not available.<br>
•	Hot water is available in 5 minutes hence no need of large hot water storage tank.<br>
•	No chimney required-installation cost and space is drastically reduced.<br>
•	Minimum / No moving parts ensure maintenance free operation.<br>
•	Ideal for hotels, hospitals, laundries, resorts etc.<br>
•	Hot water available upto 90°.<br>
