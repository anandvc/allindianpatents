SPECIFICATION Lactam Compounds and Pharmaceutical Use Thereof<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to lactam compounds and a therapeutic agent for diabetes which contains the compound(s) as the active ingredient.<br>
The medicinal treatment for type II diabetes is employed when a sufficient improvement of a patient cannot be attained by dietetic treatment or kinetotherapy, and there have been developed pharmaceutical preparations containing insulin that is an endogenous hormone for controlling the hypoglycemic function and also peroral hypoglycemic agents having an effect of accelerating insulin secretion or improving peripheral insulin resistance. At present, the main medicinal treatment for type II diabetes comprises using a peroral hypoglycemic agent for strictly controlling the blood sugar level. However, when insulin-like effect sufficient for controlling the blood sugar cannot be obtained, the insulin therapy is mainly employed. On the other hand, the insulin therapy is the only treatment for patients with type I diabetes because they have lost the insulin secretion capacity.<br>
Although the insulin therapy is thus an important treatment method, use of injection causes problems that the treatment technique is complicated and that the patient must be trained. Under these conditions, an improvement in the administration method is eagerly demanded from the viewpoint of the compliance.    Recently, it was tried<br><br>
to develop methods for administering insulin in the form of non-injection preparations instead of the insulin injection. However, those methods have not been practically employed because of a low absorption efficiency or unstable absorption.<br>
It is one of the important hypoglycemic functions of insulin that it increases the sugar-transporting capacity of peripheral cells to incorporate the sugar in the blood into the cells and, as a result, the blood sugar level is lowered. If a new oral medicine capable of lowering the blood sugar level by increasing the sugar-transporting capacity of peripheral cells is found, it would became the therapy in favor of the patients.    However, such a medicine has not yet been developed.<br>
On the other hand, as for the lactam compound, Khim.-Farm. Zh., 25 (II), (1991) and Pharmaceutical Chemical Journal. 25 (11), 768 (1991) disclose compounds of general formula (I) given below, wherein B represents a benzene ring, -X- and -Y- each represent -NH-, -Z-represents -CH2-, -W- represents -NH- and -A(R2)(R3)(R4) represents a phenyl group, 4-bromophenyl group, 4-hydroxyphenyl group, 4-methoxyphenyl group, 2-hydroxyphenyl group, 3,4-dimethoxyphenyl group or 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl group. It is described therein that those compounds have no anxiolytic effect, antispasmodic effect or cardiotonic effect.<br>
Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan, 715-20 (1986) and Chem. Pharm. Bull., 3724-9 (1984) disclose compounds of general formula (I) given below, wherein B represents a benzene ring, -X- represents -NH-, -Z-represents -CR6R7-, -W-represents -NH- and R6 and R7 each represent a methyl group. It is described therein that those compounds have a weak analgesic effect.<br><br>
Synthesis, 937-8 (1987) discloses a compound of general formula (I) given below, wherein B represents a benzene ring, -X- represents -NH-, -Z-represents -CO-, -W- represents -NR1- and R1 represents p-tolyl group. However, the activity of this compound is not described therein.<br>
Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan, 1004-8 (1984) discloses compounds of general formula (I) given below, wherein B represents a benzene ring, -X- represents -NH-, -Y- represents -S-, -Z-represents -CR6R7-, W represents -NH- and R6 and R7 each represent a methyl group. It is described therein that those compounds have a weak sterilizing effect.<br>
Journal of Organic Chemistry, 4367-70 (1983) also discloses compounds of general formula (I) given below, wherein B represents a benzene ring, -X- represents -NH-, -Y- represents -S-, -Z-represents -CH2-and -W- represents -0-. However, the activity of this compound is not described therein.<br>

(Test Example 1) Evaluation of the sugar-transporting activity:<br>
1.	Preparation of adipose cells of rats:<br>
After the decapitation and venesection of 6 male Wistar rats (body weight: 150 to 200 g), an incision was made in the abdomen of each rat to extract 6 g in total of epididymal adipose tissues. The tissues were finely cut into 2 mm x 2 mm pieces in 6 ml of KRH (Krebs-Ringer Hepes, composition: 130 mM of sodium chloride, 4.7 mM of potassium chloride, 1.2 mM of potassium dihydrogenphosphate, 1.2 mM of magnesium sulfate, 1 mM of calcium chloride and 25 mM of Hepes, pH=7.6 ) containing 5 % of BSA (bovine serum albumin). 24 mg of collagenase (type I) was added thereto and the digestion treatment was conducted for about 40 minutes to obtain about 6 ml of isolated adipose cells. The collagenase was removed by the buffer exchange. 2 % BSA/KRH solution was added to the residue for the re-suspension to obtain 45 ml of an adipose cell suspension.<br>
2.	Evaluation of the sugar-transporting activity:<br>
The sugar-transporting activity of the compounds of the present invention  was   evaluated  with  reference  to  a  method  described  in   a<br><br>
literature [Annual Review of Biochemistry, Vol. 55, p. 1059 (1986)], In the test, 200 i± 1 of the adipose cell suspension was poured in each polystyrene test tube, 100 \i 1 of the solution of the test substance (by dilution of 10 mg/ml substance dimethyl sulfoxide solution with KRH) was added thereto, and the obtained mixture was shaken and then cultured at 37°C  for 30 minutes.<br>
The sugar-transporting activity was evaluated by measuring the quantity of 2-[14C(U)]-deoxy-D-glucose incorporated per a unit time. Namely, 2-[14C(U)]-deoxy-D-glucose was added to the adipose cell suspension after the pre-culture (the final concentration: 0.5 \i Ci/sample). 5 minutes after, cytochalasin B (final concentration: 10 \i M) was added to the mixture to terminate the sugar transportation. After forming a dinonyl phthalate layer, the obtained mixture was centrifuged to separate the adipose cells from the buffer. The quantity of 2-[14C(U)]-deoxy-D-glucose contained in the adipose cell layer was determined with a liquid scintillation counter to determine the quantity of the incorporated sugar. In this evaluation system, when insulin (100 nM) having the effect of increasing the sugar transportation was used, the effect was about 7 times as high as that obtained in the insulin-free control group.<br>
The results of the evaluation of the sugar-transporting activity obtained by using 100 \i g/ml of each compound of the present invention are shown in Table 6. The sugar transporting activity in Table 6 was evaluated on the basis of the reinforcing effect of insulin (100 nM). "+" indicates that the effect was 20 to 40 %, "++" indicates that the effect was 40 to 70 %, and "+++" indicates that the effect was at least 70 % based on<br><br><br><br><br>
The results of the evaluation of the sugar-transporting activity obtained by using each compound of the present invention are shown in Table 7. The sugar transporting activity in Table 7 was determined in terms of the concentration (EC50: \L g/ml) of a test compound, having a reinforcing effect corresponding to 50 % on the basis of the reinforcing effect of insulin having a reinforcing effect of 100 %.<br>
The symbols in Table 7 are as follows: No: Example No., and A: sugar transporting activity.<br><br><br><br><br>
mice after the fasting for 20 hours. The blood sample was taken from the tail vein of each mouse immediately before the administration and also 30, 60, 120 and 180 minutes after the administration to determine the blood sugar level. The test compound was administered in the form of a suspension in 0.5 % methylcellulose solution or a solution in Polyethylene glycol 400.<br>
When 100 mg/kg of each of the compounds produced in Examples 80, 88, 119, 129, 131, 137, 140, 154, 155 and 156 was given once, it exhibited an effect of lowering the blood sugar level by at least 30 % as compared with that in control groups.<br>
It is apparent from those results that the compounds of the present invention have the effect of increasing the sugar-transporting activity and that they are useful for treating patients suffering from diabetes. Namely, since they are capable of lowering the blood sugar level by the effect of increasing the sugar-transporting activity, they are useful as agents for preventing and/or treating diabetes, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macroangiopathy, impaired glucose tolerance or adiposis.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
