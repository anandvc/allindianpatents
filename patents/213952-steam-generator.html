				<td>Description<br>
Steam generator<br>
The invention relates to a steam generator in which a<br>
once-through heating area is arranged in a heating-gas<br>
duct through which flow can occur in an approximately<br>
horizontal heating-gas direction, which once-through<br>
heating area comprises a number of steam generator<br>
tubes connected in parallel to the throughflow of a<br>
flow medium and which is designed in such a way that a<br>
steam generator tube heated to a greater extent<br>
compared with a further steam generator tube of the<br>
same once-through heating area has a higher rate of<br>
flow of the flow medium compared with the further steam<br>
generator tube.<br>
In a gas- and steam-turbine plant, the heat contained<br>
in the expanded working medium or heating gas from the<br>
gas turbine is used for generating steam for the steam<br>
turbine. The heat transfer is effected in a heat-<br>
recovery steam generator which is connected downstream<br>
of the gas turbine and in which a number of heating<br>
areas for water preheating, for steam generation and<br>
for steam superheating are normally arranged. The<br>
heating areas are connected in the water/steam circuit<br>
of the steam turbine. The water/steam circuit normally<br>
comprises several, e.g. three, pressure stages, in<br>
which case each pressure stage may have an evaporator<br>
heating area.<br>
For the steam generator connected as a heat-recovery<br>
steam generator downstream of the gas turbine on the<br>
heating-gas side, a plurality of alternative design<br>
concepts come into consideration, namely the design as<br>
a once-through steam generator or the design as a<br>
circulation steam generator. In a once-through steam<br>
generator, the heating of steam generator tubes<br>
provided as evaporator tubes leads to an evaporation of<br>
the flow medium in the steam generator tubes in a<br>
single pass. In contrast thereto, in a natural- or<br>
forced-circulation steam generator, the circulating<br>
water is only partly evaporated when passing through<br>
the evaporator tubes. The water which is not evaporated<br>
in the process<br>
is fed again to the same evaporator tubes for a further<br>
evaporation after separation of the generated steam.<br>
A once-through steam generator, in contrast to a<br>
natural- or forced-circulation steam generator, is not<br>
subject to any pressure limit, so that live-steam<br>
pressures are possible well above the critical pressure<br>
of water (Pcri @ 221 bar) - where there is only a slight<br>
difference in density between a medium similar to a<br>
liquid and a medium similar to steam. A high live-steam<br>
pressure promotes a high thermal efficiency and thus<br>
low CO2 emissions of a fossil-fired power plant. In<br>
addition, a once-through steam generator has a simple<br>
type of construction compared with a circulation steam<br>
generator and can therefore be manufactured at an<br>
especially low cost. The use of a steam generator<br>
designed according to the once-through principle as a<br>
heat-recovery steam generator of a gas- and steam-<br>
turbine plant is therefore especially favorable for<br>
achieving a high overall efficiency of the gas- and<br>
steam-turbine plant in a simple type of construction.<br>
Particular advantages with regard to the cost of<br>
manufacture, but also with regard to necessary<br>
maintenance work, are offered by a heat-recovery steam<br>
generator in a horizontal type of construction, in<br>
which the heating medium or heating gas, that is to say<br>
the exhaust gas from the gas turbine, is conducted<br>
through the steam generator in an approximately<br>
horizontal direction of flow. In a once-through steam<br>
generator in a horizontal type of construction,<br>
however, the steam generator tubes of a heating area,<br>
depending on their positioning, may be subjected to<br>
heating that differs greatly. In particular in the case<br>
of steam generator tubes connected on the outlet side<br>
to a common collector, different heating of individual<br>
steam generator tubes may lead to a union of steam<br>
flows having steam parameters differing greatly from<br>
one another and thus to undesirable efficiency losses,<br>
in particular to comparatively reduced effectiveness of<br>
the relevant heating area and consequently reduced<br>
steam generation. In addition, different heating of<br>
adjacent<br>
steam generator tubes, in particular in the region<br>
where they open into collectors, may result in damage<br>
to the steam generator tubes or the collector. The use,<br>
desirable per se, of a once-through steam generator of<br>
horizontal type of construction as a heat-recovery<br>
steam generator for a gas turbine may therefore entail<br>
considerable problems with regard to a sufficiently<br>
stabilized flow guidance.<br>
EP 0944 801 B1 discloses a steam generator which is<br>
suitable for being designed in a horizontal type of<br>
construction and in addition has the aforesaid<br>
advantages of a once-through steam generator. To this<br>
end, the known steam generator is designed with regard<br>
to its once-through heating area in such a way that a<br>
steam generator tube heated to a greater extent<br>
compared with a further steam generator tube of the<br>
same once-through heating area has a higher rate of<br>
flow of the flow medium compared with the further steam<br>
generator tube. The once-through heating area of the<br>
known steam generator therefore exhibits a self-<br>
stabilizing behavior like the flow characteristic of a<br>
natural-circulation evaporator heating area (natural-<br>
circulation characteristic) when individual steam<br>
generator tubes are heated to a different extent, and<br>
this behavior, without the need for exerting an<br>
external influence, leads to adaptation of the outlet-<br>
side temperatures even on steam generator tubes heated<br>
to a different extent and connected in parallel on the<br>
flow-medium side. However, the known steam generator is<br>
comparatively complicated from a design point of view,<br>
in particular with regard to the water- and/or steam-<br>
side distribution of the flow medium. In addition,<br>
problematic differential expansions may occur between<br>
adjacent evaporator tubes and may lead to inadmissible<br>
thermal stresses and thus to damage to tubes and<br>
collectors.<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to specify a<br>
steam generator of the type mentioned at the beginning<br>
which can be manufactured at an especially low cost and<br>
which has especially<br>
high mechanical stability even during different thermal<br>
loading.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention in<br>
that one of or each of the steam generator tubes in<br>
each case comprises an approximately vertically<br>
arranged downcomer section, through which the flow<br>
medium can flow in the downward direction, and an<br>
approximately vertically arranged riser section which<br>
is connected downstream of said downcomer section on<br>
the flow-medium side and through which the flow medium<br>
can flow in the upward direction.<br>
In this case, the invention is based on the idea that,<br>
in a steam generator which can be manufactured at an<br>
especially low assembly and production cost, for an<br>
especially stable operating behavior which is<br>
especially insensitive to differences in the thermal<br>
loading, the design principle, applied in the known<br>
steam generator, of a natural-circulation<br>
characteristic for a once-through heating area should<br>
be logically developed and further improved. The once-<br>
through heating area should in this case be designed<br>
for the application of a comparatively low mass-flow<br>
density with comparatively low friction pressure loss.<br>
In order to assist the natural-circulation<br>
characteristic of the throughflow in this design,<br>
provision is made for dividing the steam generator<br>
tubes of the once-through heating area into in each<br>
case at least two segments (of parallel tubes), the<br>
first segment comprising all downcomer sections and<br>
flow occurring through it in the downward direction.<br>
Correspondingly, the second segment comprises all riser<br>
sections and flow occurs through it in the upward<br>
direction. In the downcomer sections of the first<br>
segment, the contribution of the geodetic pressure,<br>
that is to say essentially the weight of the water<br>
column, therefore acts in the direction of the intended<br>
throughflow and promotes the latter by a positive<br>
contribution to the pressure change along the flow<br>
path, that is to say by a gain in pressure. Only in the<br>
second segment or riser section does the contribution<br>
of the geodetic pressure<br>
act against the intended throughflow direction and<br>
therefore contribute to the pressure loss. In totax,<br>
however, the two geodetic pressure contributions can<br>
virtually neutralize one another; it is even<br>
conceivable for the throughflow-promoting geodetic<br>
pressure contribution in the first segment or downcomer<br>
section to exceed the throughflow-inhibiting geodetic<br>
pressure contribution in the second segment or riser<br>
section, so that, as in natural-circulation systems,<br>
there is a flow-maintaining or flow-promoting pressure<br>
contribution overall.<br>
The downcomer section of each steam generator tube is<br>
expediently arranged in the heating-gas duct downstream<br>
of the riser section assigned to it as viewed in the<br>
heating-gas direction. In other words: the steam<br>
generator tubes are expediently spatially arranged in<br>
the heating-gas duct in such a way that the first<br>
segment or downcomer section as viewed on the flow-<br>
medium side is arranged on the flue-gas side downstream<br>
of the second segment or riser section as viewed on the<br>
flow-medium side. In such an arrangement, each riser<br>
section is thus subjected to a comparatively more<br>
intense heating by the heating gas than that downcomer<br>
section of the same steam generator tube which is<br>
assigned to it. Thus, the relative steam proportion of<br>
the flow medium in the riser section also markedly<br>
exceeds the relative steam proportion of the flow<br>
medium in the downcomer section, so that the geodetic<br>
pressure contribution, essentially given by the weight<br>
of the water/steam column in the respective tube<br>
length, is markedly higher in the downcomer section<br>
than in the riser section assigned to it.<br>
In a further or alternative advantageous configuration,<br>
an especially simple construction of the once-through<br>
heating area, on the one hand, and an especially low<br>
mechanical loading of the once-through heating area,<br>
even during different thermal loading, on the other<br>
hand, can be achieved by the downcomer section of one<br>
or each steam generator tube being connected on the<br>
flow-medium side via an overflow section to the riser<br>
section assigned to it. In such a configuration,<br>
the respective steam generator tube therefore<br>
essentially has a u shape in which the legs are<br>
provided by the riser section, on the one hand, and by<br>
the downcomer section, on the other hand, and the bend<br>
is provided by the overflow section connecting said<br>
riser section and downcomer section.<br>
Such an arrangement is especially suitable for<br>
expansion compensation during varying thermal loading;<br>
this is because the overflow section connecting the<br>
downcomer section and the riser section serves in this<br>
case as an expansion bend, which can readily compensate<br>
for relative changes in length of the riser section<br>
and/or of the downcomer section. The overflow section<br>
therefore ensures that the steam generator tubes are<br>
turned in the bottom region of a first evaporator stage<br>
provided by the downcomer sections and are directly<br>
continued and turned again in the bottom region of a<br>
second evaporator stage formed by the riser sections.<br>
The overflow section is advantageously arranged inside<br>
the heating-gas duct. Alternatively, however, the<br>
overflow section may also be disposed outside the<br>
heating-gas duct, in particular if a draining collector<br>
is to be connected to the overflow section if the once-<br>
through heating area possibly has to be drained.<br>
In the event of the flow-promoting pressure<br>
contribution in the downcomer section of a steam<br>
generator exceeding the flow-inhibiting pressure<br>
contribution in the riser section assigned to it to an<br>
especially high degree, the resulting outflow of flow<br>
medium from the downcomer section into the riser<br>
section could exceed the inlet-side inflow of flow<br>
medium into the downcomer section. Therefore the or<br>
each steam generator tube is advantageously designed<br>
with regard to its overall pressure balance in such a<br>
way that the flow-promoting pressure contribution<br>
occurring overall in the downcomer section is only<br>
limited with regard to the flow-inhibiting pressure<br>
contribution occurring in the riser section.<br>
To this end, the downcomer section of one or of each<br>
steam generator tube of the steam generator is<br>
advantageously designed for a sufficiently high<br>
friction pressure loss of the flow medium flowing<br>
through. This may be done, for example, by suitable<br>
dimensioning, in particular in cross section, of the<br>
individual tube sections. In this case, one or each<br>
steam generator tube, in a type of bifurcation, in each<br>
case also expediently comprises a plurality of riser<br>
sections connected downstream of a common downcomer<br>
section on the flow-medium side and mutually connected<br>
in parallel to the throughflow of the flow medium. In<br>
an alternative or further advantageous configuration,<br>
in each case a throttle device is connected on the<br>
flow-medium side upstream of the downcomer section of<br>
the or each steam generator tube, via which throttle<br>
device in particular the individual rate of flow can be<br>
set during the feeding of the respective downcomer<br>
section.<br>
The steam generator tubes can be combined inside the<br>
heating-gas duct to form tube rows, of which each in<br>
each case comprises a number of steam generator tubes<br>
arranged next to one another perpendicularly to the<br>
heating-gas direction. In such a configuration, the<br>
steam generator tubes are preferably directed in such a<br>
way that the tube row of the downcomer sections which<br>
is heated to the lowest degree or which is the last row<br>
as viewed in the heating-gas direction is assigned to<br>
the riser sections forming the tube row heated to the<br>
greatest degree, that is to say to the first tube row<br>
as viewed in the heating-gas direction. To this end,<br>
the riser and downcomer sections of a plurality of<br>
steam generator tubes are expediently positioned<br>
relative to one another in the heating-gas duct in such<br>
a way that a riser section lying comparatively far<br>
forward as viewed in the heating-gas direction is<br>
assigned to a downcomer section lying comparatively far<br>
back as viewed in the heating-gas direction. By means<br>
of such an arrangement, which spatially corresponds<br>
essentially to a nested arrangement of a plurality of<br>
u-shaped steam generator tubes, the riser sections<br>
heated to a comparatively high degree are fed with flow<br>
medium preheated to a comparatively low degree and<br>
flowing out of the downcomer sections.<br>
The geodetic pressure contribution, promoting the flow<br>
overall, through the downcomer section connected<br>
upstream in each case is thus especially high precisely<br>
in the riser sections heated to a comparatively high<br>
degree, so that especially pronounced additional<br>
feeding with flow medium from the assigned downcomer<br>
section is automatically effected. The automatic<br>
additional feeding from the assigned downcomer section<br>
is therefore effected in this case in such a way as to<br>
especially meet the requirements precisely for tubes<br>
heated to a high degree, so that the desired natural-<br>
circulation characteristic is intensified to an<br>
especially high degree.<br>
In order to provide the flow-promoting geodetic<br>
pressure contribution in the respective steam generator<br>
tube, the respective steam generator tube can be<br>
designed in such a way that it comprises merely one<br>
downcomer section and merely one riser section<br>
connected downstream of said downcomer section on the<br>
flow-medium side. However, especially high flexibility<br>
during the adaptation of the heat adsorptivity of the<br>
flow medium flowing through the steam generator tube to<br>
the temperature profile of the heating gas flowing<br>
through the heating-gas duct can be achieved by a<br>
number of steam generator tubes in each case comprising<br>
a plurality of downcomer and riser sections connected<br>
alternately one behind the other on the flow-medium<br>
side. In this case, each of these steam generator<br>
tubes, as viewed in the direction of flow of the flow<br>
medium, has first of all a first downcomer section,<br>
following which, after suitable turning, preferably via<br>
an overflow section, is a first riser section designed<br>
for throughflow of the flow medium in the upward<br>
direction. Connected downstream of this riser section,<br>
preferably likewise after suitable turning via an<br>
overflow section arranged inside the heating-gas duct,<br>
is a second downcomer section designed for throughflow<br>
of the flow medium in the downward direction. A second<br>
riser section then again follows the second downcomer<br>
section. Furthermore,<br>
as and when required, a plurality of downcomer and<br>
riser sections may also be connected downstream in an<br>
alternating arrangement.<br>
The steam generator is expediently used as a heat-<br>
recovery steam generator of a gas- and steam-turbine<br>
plant. in this case, the steam generator is<br>
advantageously connected downstream of a gas turbine on<br>
the heating-gas side. In this circuit, supplementary<br>
firing for increasing the heating-gas temperature may<br>
expediently be arranged downstream of the gas turbine.<br>
The advantages achieved with the invention consist in<br>
particular in the fact that, by the two-stage or multi-<br>
stage configuration of the steam generator tubes having<br>
a downcomer section through which flow can occur in the<br>
downward direction and a riser section which is<br>
connected downstream of said downcomer section on the<br>
flow-medium side and through which flov can occur in<br>
the upward direction, at least in the first segment of<br>
the steam generator tube, a flow-promoting pressure<br>
contribution can be provided via the geodetic pressure<br>
of the water column located therein.<br>
It is certainly true that heated evaporator systems<br>
through which flow occurs downward normally lead to<br>
flow instabilities which are not tolerable precisely<br>
during use in once-through evaporators. However, during<br>
feeding with comparatively low mass-flow density, a<br>
natural-circulation characteristic of the steam<br>
generator tube can be achieved in a reliable manner due<br>
to the comparatively low friction pressure loss, which<br>
natural-circulation characteristic when a steam<br>
generator tube is heated to a greater extent compared<br>
with a further steam generator tube, leads to a<br>
comparatively higher rate of flow of the flow medium in<br>
the steam generator tube heated to a greater extent.<br>
This natural-circulation characteristic, even when<br>
using the segments through which flow occurs downwards,<br>
ensures a sufficiently stable and reliable flow through<br>
the steam generator tubes.<br>
In addition, such a characteristic can be achieved at<br>
an especially low cost in terras of construction and<br>
assembly by the riser<br>
section being directly connected downstream of the<br>
downcomer section assigned to it, and without a<br>
complicated collector or distributor system being<br>
connected therebetween. The steam generator therefore<br>
has a relatively low degree of plant complexity in<br>
conjunction with an especially stable flow behavior.<br>
Furthermore, both the downcomer section and the riser<br>
section, connected downstream of it, of each steam<br>
generator tube can be fastened in each case in a<br>
suspended type of construction in the region of the<br>
casing ceiling of the heating-gas duct, free linear<br>
expansion being permitted in each case in the bottom<br>
region. Such linear expansions caused by thermal<br>
effects are now compensated for by the overflow section<br>
connecting the respective riser section to the<br>
downcomer section, so that no distortions occur on<br>
account of thermal effects.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the invention are explained in<br>
more detail with reference to a drawing, in which:<br>
figures 1, 2 and 3 each show in simplified<br>
representation a steam generator in a horizontal type<br>
of construction in longitudinal section.<br>
The same parts are provided with the same designations<br>
in all the figures.<br>
The steam generator 1, 1", 1"" according to figures 1,<br>
2 and 3, respectively, is arranged like a heat-recovery<br>
steam generator on the exhaust-gas side downstream of a<br>
gas turbine (not shown in any more detail) . The steam<br>
generator 1, 1", 1"" has in each case an enclosing wall<br>
2 which forms a heating-gas duct 6 for the exhaust gas<br>
from the gas turbine, through which heating-gas duct 6<br>
flow can occur in an approximately horizontal heating-<br>
gas direction x indicated by arrows 4. A number of<br>
heating areas designed according to the once-through<br>
principle, and also referred to as once-through heating<br>
areas 8, 10 and 12, respectively, are arranged in each<br>
case in the heating-gas duct 6. In the exemplary<br>
embodiments according to figures 1, 2 and 3, in each<br>
case only one once-through heating area 8, 10 or 12,<br>
respectively, is shown, but a larger number of once-<br>
through heating areas may also be provided.<br>
Flow medium W can in each case be admitted to the<br>
evaporator system formed from the once-through heating<br>
areas 8, 10 and 12, respectively, and this flow medium<br>
W, during a single pass, is evaporated by the<br>
respective once-through heating area 8, 10 or 12 and,<br>
after the discharge from the once-through heating area<br>
8, 10 or 12, respectively, is drawn off as steam D and<br>
is normally fed to superheater heating areas for<br>
further superheating. The evaporator system formed from<br>
the respective once-through heating area 8, 10 and 12,<br>
respectively, is in each case connected in the<br>
water/steam circuit (not shown in any more detail) of a<br>
steam turbine. In addition to the respective evaporator<br>
system, a number of further heating areas 20, in each<br>
case indicated schematically in figures 1 to 3, are<br>
connected into the water/steam circuit of the steam<br>
turbine. The heating areas 20 may be, for example,<br>
superheaters, intermediate-pressure evaporators, low-<br>
pressure evaporators and/or preheaters.<br>
The once-through heating area 8 of the steam generator<br>
1 according to figure 1, like a tube bundle, comprises<br>
a plurality of steam generator tubes 22 connected in<br>
parallel to the throughflow of the flow medium W. Here,<br>
a plurality of steam generator tubes 22 are in each<br>
case arranged side by side as viewed in the heating-gas<br>
direction x. In this arrangement, only one of the steam<br>
generator tubes 22 arranged side by side in this way<br>
can be seen in each case. Here, on the flow-medium<br>
side, a common distributor 26 is arranged in each case<br>
upstream of the steam generator tubes 22 arranged side<br>
by side in this way and a common discharge collector 28<br>
is arranged in each case downstream of the latter. In<br>
this case, the distributors 26 are in turn connected on<br>
the inlet side to a main distributor 30, the discharge<br>
collector 28 being connected on the outlet side to a<br>
common main collector 32.<br>
The once-through heating area 8 is designed in such a<br>
way that it is suitable for feeding the steam generator<br>
tubes 22 with a comparatively low mass-flow density,<br>
the steam generator tubes 22 having a natural-<br>
circulation characteristic. In the case of this<br>
natural-circulation characteristic, a steam generator<br>
tube 22 heated to a greater extent compared with a<br>
further steam generator tube 22 of the same once-<br>
through heating area 8 has a higher rate of flow of the<br>
flow medium W compared with the further steam generator<br>
tube 22. In order to ensure this with especially simple<br>
design means in an especially reliable manner, the<br>
once-through heating area 8 comprises two segments<br>
connected in series on the flow-medium side. In the<br>
first segment, each steam generator tube 22 of the<br>
once-through heating area 8 comprises in this case an<br>
approximately vertically arranged downcomer section 34<br>
through which the flow medium W can flow in the<br>
downward direction. In the second segment, each steam<br>
generator tube 22 comprises an approximately vertically<br>
arranged riser section 36 which is connected downstream<br>
of the downcomer section 34 on the flow-medium side and<br>
through which the flow medium W can flow in the upward<br>
direction.<br>
In this case, the riser section 36 is connected to the<br>
downcomer section 34 assigned to it via an overflow<br>
section 38. In the exemplary embodiment, the overflow<br>
sections are directed inside the heating-gas duct 6<br>
and, for spatial fixing, through a perforated plate 40<br>
arranged in the heating-gas duct 6. Although this<br>
perforated plate 40 produces a local constriction of<br>
the cross section of flow available for the heating gas<br>
in the heating-gas duct 6, it has to be emphasized that<br>
the representation in figure 1 is not to scale, so that<br>
the relative constriction of the cross section of flow<br>
for the heating gas by the perforated plate 40 is only<br>
alight.<br>
Alternatively, the overflow sections may also be<br>
directed outside, in particular below, the heating-gas<br>
duct 6. This may be favorable in particular for the<br>
case where draining of the once-through heating area 8<br>
is to be provided for design or operational reasons.<br>
This draining, in the case of overflow sections 38<br>
directed outside the heating-gas duct 6, may be<br>
effected by a draining collector connected to said<br>
overflow sections 38. In this case, the draining<br>
collector is preferably arranged spatially in the<br>
vicinity of the downcomer sections, so<br>
that the mobility of the heating-tube sections with<br>
regard to thermal expansion is retained without<br>
hindrance.<br>
As can be seen in figure 1, each steam generator tube<br>
22 of the once-through heating area 8 virtually has a<br>
u-shape, the legs of the U being formed by the<br>
downcomer section 34 and the riser section 36, and the<br>
connecting bend being formed by the overflow section<br>
38. In a steam generator tube 22 of such a design, the<br>
geodetic pressure contribution of the flow medium W in<br>
the region of the downcomer section 34 - in contrast to<br>
the region of the riser section 36 - produces a flow-<br>
promoting and not a flow-inhibiting pressure<br>
contribution. In other words: the water column of<br>
unevaporated flow medium W located in the downcomer<br>
section 34 still "pushes"" along the flow through the<br>
respective steam generator tube 22 instead of hindering<br>
it. As a result, the steam generator tube 22,<br>
considered as a whole, has a comparatively low pressure<br>
loss.<br>
In the approximately u-shaped type of construction,<br>
each steam generator tube 22 is suspended or fastened<br>
in the manner of a suspended construction on the<br>
ceiling of the heating-gas duct 6 in each case in the<br>
inlet region of its downcomer section 34 and in the<br>
outlet region of its riser section 36. On the other<br>
hand, the bottom ends, as viewed spatially, of the<br>
respective downcomer section 34 and of the respective<br>
riser section 36, which are connected to one another by<br>
their overflow section 38, are not fixed directly<br>
spatially in the heating-gas duct 6. Linear expansions<br>
of these segments of the steam generator tubes can<br>
therefore be tolerated without the risk of damage, the<br>
respective overflow section 38 acting as an expansion<br>
bend. This arrangement of the steam generator tubes 22<br>
is therefore especially flexible mechanically and, with<br>
regard to thermal stresses, is insensitive to<br>
differential pressures which occur.<br>
Heating of a steam generator tube 22 to a greater<br>
extent, in particular in its riser section 36, in this<br>
case leads there first of all to<br>
an increase in the evaporation rate, in the course of<br>
which, just on account of the dimensioning of the steam<br>
generator tube 22, an increase in the rate of flow<br>
through the steam generator tube 22 heated to a greater<br>
extent occurs as a result of this heating to a greater<br>
extent.<br>
The steam generator tubes 22 of various tube rows 24 of<br>
the once-through heating area 8 are in addition,<br>
arranged like U shapes nested one inside the other. To<br>
this end, the riser sections 36 and the downcomer<br>
sections 34 of a plurality of steam generator tubes 22<br>
are positioned relative to one another in the heating-<br>
gas duct 6 in such a way that a riser section 36 lying<br>
relatively far forward as viewed in the heating-gas<br>
direction x is assigned to a downcomer section 34 lying<br>
relatively at the rear as viewed in the heating-gas<br>
direction x. By means of this arrangement, a riser<br>
section 36 heated to a relatively high degree<br>
communicates with a downcomer section 34 heated to a<br>
relatively low degree. A self-compensating effect is<br>
also achieved between the tube rows 24 by this relative<br>
positioning. This is because, precisely with a riser<br>
section 36 heated to a comparatively high degree and<br>
lying far forward, the heating to a greater extent<br>
results in an especially pronounced production of steam<br>
and thus in an especially high demand for additional<br>
feeding with flow medium W. However, precisely a riser<br>
section 36 heated to such a high degree is connected to<br>
a downcomer section 34 heated to a comparatively low<br>
degree. Said downcomer section 34, on account of the<br>
comparatively low heat input into the flow medium W<br>
conducted in it, has an especially high flow-promoting<br>
geodetic pressure contribution, so that precisely such<br>
a downcomer section 34 heated to a comparatively low<br>
degree is suitable for providing an additional feeding<br>
quantity of comparatively cool flow medium W.<br>
In particular in this arrangement, the effect of the<br>
heating of a riser section 36 of a steam generator tube<br>
22 to a greater extent, this riser section 36 being<br>
arranged relatively far away from the, is that the<br>
flow-promoting geodetic pressure contribution in the<br>
downcomgr section 34 exceeds the flow-inhibiting<br>
geodetic pressure contribution in the assigned<br>
riser section 36 to a special degree, so that<br>
additionally increased feeding of the respective riser<br>
section 36 with flow medium W is further effected. On<br>
account of this therefore especially pronounced<br>
natural-circulation characteristic of the steam<br>
generator tubes 22, the latter, to a special degree,<br>
have a self-stabilizing behavior relative to locally<br>
different heating: heating of a row of steam generator<br>
tubes 22 to a greater extent leads in this case locally<br>
to the increased feeding of flow medium W into this row<br>
of steam generator tubes 22, so that, on account of the<br>
correspondingly increased cooling effect, an adaptation<br>
of the respective temperature values automatically<br>
occurs. The live steam flowing into the main collector<br>
32 is therefore especially homogeneous with regard to<br>
its steam parameters, irrespective of the tube cow 24<br>
through which flow occurs individually.<br>
Depending on the design point or intended operating<br>
point of the steam generator 1, 1", 1", the flow-<br>
promoting geodetic pressure contribution provided by an<br>
evaporator segment through which flow occurs downward<br>
may markedly exceed the flow-inhibiting geodetic<br>
pressure contribution of the second evaporator segment<br>
connected downstream. Therefore, it may be advantageous<br>
as a function of the design point to design, the first<br>
evaporator segment for a comparatively high friction<br>
pressure loss. To this end, a throttle device 42 is in<br>
each case connected upstream of the tube rows of the<br>
steam generator 1 according to figure 1 between the<br>
main distributor 30 and the distributors 26 assigned to<br>
them in each case, which throttle device 42 can in<br>
particular also be designed to be adjustable or<br>
controllable.<br>
Alternatively, to this end, the steam generator 1" in<br>
the exemplary embodiment according to figure 2<br>
comprises a once-through heating area 10 whose steam<br>
generator tubes 50, in a first segment, in each case<br>
likewise have a downcomer section 52, downstream of<br>
which, however, on the flow-medium side, in each case a<br>
plurality of riser sections 54 mutually connected in<br>
parallel to the throughflow of the flow medium W are<br>
connected. In this case, in the exemplary embodiment,<br>
the overflow sections 56, via which the downcomer<br>
sections 52 are each connected<br>
to the plurality of riser sections 54 assigned to them,<br>
are again directed inside the heating-gas duct 6 and<br>
are mounted in a perforated plate 58. A.s and when<br>
required, however, they may also be laid outside the<br>
heating-gas duct 6. in the exemplary embodiment<br>
according to figure 2, in each case 2 riser sections 54<br>
connected in parallel on the flow-medium side are<br>
connected downstream of each downcomer section 52. The<br>
tubes used here have identical dimensioning, so that<br>
the free cross section of flow for the flow medium W in<br>
the riser sections 54 connected in parallel is in each<br>
case twice as large as the cross section of flow in the<br>
downcomer section S2 jointly connected upstream of<br>
them. Alternatively, such a limit of the friction<br>
pressure loss in the downcomer sections 52, if<br>
required, can also be achieved by suitable<br>
dimensioning, in particular by selecting a<br>
comparatively small diameter.<br>
The steam generator 1" " in the exemplary embodiment<br>
according to figure 3 comprises a once-through heating<br>
area 12 which is likewise designed for a comparatively<br>
low friction pressure loss and is therefore especially<br>
suitable for ensuring a natural-circulation<br>
characteristic at a comparatively low mass-flow<br>
density. In addition, however, with regard to its heat<br>
absorptivity, the once-through heating area 12 of the<br>
steam generator 1" is especially adapted to the<br>
temperature profile of the heating qas flowing through<br>
the heating-gas duct 6. To this end, each of the steam<br>
generator tubes 60 forming the once-through heating<br>
area 12 in each case comprises a plurality - two in the<br>
exemplary embodiment - of downcomer sections 62, 64 and<br>
riser sections 66, 68 connected alternately one behind<br>
the other on the flow-medium side. Here, the first<br>
downcomer section 62 as viewed in the flow direction of<br>
the flow medium W is in each case connected via an<br>
overflow section 70 to the first riser section 66<br>
connected downstream of it. Said riser section 66 is in<br>
turn connected on the outlet side via an overflow<br>
section 72 to the second downcomer section 64 connected<br>
downstream of it. The second downcomer section 64 is<br>
connected to the second riser section 66 via an<br>
overflow section 74. The<br>
overflow sections 70, 72, 74 are again disposed inside<br>
the heating-gas duct 6 and are fastened in the base<br>
region and ceiling region, respectively, of the<br>
heating-gas duct 6 via in each case a perforated plate<br>
76, 78 or 80, respectively.<br><br>
