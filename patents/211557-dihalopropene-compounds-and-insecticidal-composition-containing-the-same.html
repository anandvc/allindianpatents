The following are production examples for the intermediate compounds of the general formula [IV], [V] or [VI].<br>
Intermediate Production Example 1: Production of intermediate compound 1)<br><br>
A reaction vessel was charged with 25.5 g of hydroquinone monobenzyl ether, 17.9 g of benzoyl chloride, 0.50 g of tetrabutylammonium bromide and 100 ml of toluene, to which 78.6 g of 10% potassium hydroxide solution was slowly added dropwise, while stirring under ice cooling. After 24 hours, the reaction mixture was made weakly acidic by the addition of 20% hydrochloric acid, and the deposited crystals were collected by filtration. The crystals thus obtained were successively washed with 10% hydrochloric acid and water, and dried, which afforded 38 g of 4-benzyloxyphenyl benzoate (98% yield),<br>
A reaction vessel was charged with 38 g of 4-benzyloxyphenyl benzoate and 500 ml of ethanol, and the air in the vessel was replaced with nitrogen. Then, 1.0 g of 10% palladium carbon was added thereto, and the nitrogen in the vessel was replaced with hydrogen, followed by vigorous stirring at room temperature for 24 hours. The hydrogen in the vessel was replaced with nitrogen, after which the reaction mixture was filtered though celite, and the filtrate was concentrated, which afforded 24.5 g of 4-hydroxyphenyl benzoate (94% yield).<br>
A reaction vessel was charged with 24.5 g of 4-hydroxyphenyl benzoate and 500 ml of carbon tetrachloride, to which a solution of 24,8 g of t-butyl hypochlorite dissolved in 20 ml of carbon tetrachloride was slowly added dropwise, while stirring under ice cooling. After 24 hours, the reaction mixture was poured into water, followed by phase separation. The organic layer (i,e., carbon tetrachloride layer) was washed with water, dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated to obtain a crude product. The crude product was subjected to silica gel chromatography, which afforded 29.5 g of 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxyphenyl benzoate (91% yield).<br>
A reaction vessel was charged with 1.54 g of 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxyphenyl benzoate, 0.83 g of potassium carbonate, 1.53 g of 4-fluorO-3'phenoxybenzyl bromide, and 10 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide, followed by stirring at room temperature for 5 hours.  The reaction mixture was poured into water, and extracted twice with 50 m of diethyl ether.  The combined ether layer was washed with water, dried with anhydrous<br><br>
magnesium sulfate, and concentrated to obtain a crude product. The crude product was subjected to silica gel chromatography, which afforded 2.32 g of 3,5-dichloro-4-(4-fluoro-3-phenoxybenzyloxy)phenyI benzoate (88% yield).<br>
A reaction vessel was charged with 1.36 g of 3,5-dichloro-4-(4-fluoro-3-phenoxybenzyloxy)phenyl benzoate and 10 ml of methanol, to which 4.2 g of 10% potassium hydroxide solution was slowly added dropwise under ice cooling. After stirring for 1 hour, the reaction mixture was made weakly acidic by the addition of 10% hydrochloric acid, and extracted twice with 50 ml of diethyl ether under salting out. The combined ether layer was washed with water, dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated to obtain a crude product. The crude product was subjected to silica gel chromatography, which afforded 0.97 g of 3,5-dichloro-4-(4-fluoro-3-phenoxybenzyl-oxy)phenol (91% yield), m.p. 144.8'C.<br>
Intermediate Production Example 2: Production of intermediate compound 2)<br>
A mixture of 2.27 g of 4-benzoyloxy-2,6-dichlorophenol, 1.29 g of 2-chloro-benzyl chloride, 1.21 g of potassium carbonate and 50 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide was stirred at 80'C for 6 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, poured in ice water, and extracted twice with 50 ml of diethyl ether. The combined ether layer was washed with water, and dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, followed by removal of the solvent by distillation under reduced pressure.

extracted twice with 200 ml of diethyl ether. The combined ether layer was washed with water, dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated to obtain a crude product. The crude product was subjected to silica gel chromatography, which afforded 18.1 g of 4-bromo-2-ethyl-6-methyl-l-[3-(4-trifluoromethoxyphenoxy)propyloxy]ben-zene (90% yield).<br>
Then, 6.6 g of 4-bromo-2-ethyl-6-methyl-l-[3-(4-trifluoromethoxyphenoxy)-propyloxyjbenzene was dissolved in 200 ml of tetrahydrofuran, and the solution was stirred at -70'C, to which 9.6 ml of n-butyl lithium solution (in hexane, 1.58 mol/liter) was added dropwise, followed by further stirring at -70'C for 2 hours. To this reaction mixture was added dropwise a solution of 2.2 g of triethoxy borane dissolved in 60 ml of tetrahydrofuran. Then, the reaction mixture was stirred for 1 hour, while warming to room temperature, and 13 ml of 10% aqueous hydrochloric acid solution was added in small portions, followed by stirring at room temperature for 20 minutes. The tetrahydro¬furan layer was washed with water, dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated, to which 50 ml of toluene was added, and the mixture was heated at 70'C under stirring, to which 6 ml of 30% aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution was added dropwise. The mixture was heated under reflux for 1 hour, and washed once with water, twice with 10% aqueous ammonium ferrous sulfate solution, and once with water.

Intermediate Production Example 8:   Production of intermediate compound 363)<br><br>
A reaction vessel was charged with 10.6 g of 1,3-dibromopropane, 5.53 g of potassium carbonate and 100 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide, to which a solution of 30.5 g of 2,6-dichloro-4-(3,3-dichloro-2-propenyloxy)phenol dissolved in 40ml of N,N-dimethylformamide was slowly added dropwise. After stirring at room temperature for 24 hours, the reaction mixture was poured into water, and extracted twice with 150 ml of diethyl ether. The combined ether layer was washed with water, dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated to obtain a crude product. The crude product was subjected to silica gel chromatography, which afforded 11.1 g of 3,5-dichloro-4-(3-bromopropyloxy)-l-(3,3-dichloro-2-propenyloxy)benzene (77% yield), n24.0 1.5693.<br>

After stirring at room temperature for 24 hours, the reaction mixture was poured into water, and extracted twice with 300 ml of diethyl ether. The combined ether layer was washed with water, dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated to obtain a crude product. The crude product was subjected to silica gel chromatography, which afforded 21.7 g of 3,5-dichloro-4-(4-bromobutyloxy)-l-(3,3-dichloro-2-propenyloxy)benzene (74% yield), nD25.0     1.5666.<br>
