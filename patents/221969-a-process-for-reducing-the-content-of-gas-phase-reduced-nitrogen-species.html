				<td>REDUCTION OF GAS PRASE REDUCED NITROGEN SPECIES IN PARTIAL BURN FCC PROCESSES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a process for the reduction of NOX emissions in refinery processes, and specifically in a fluid caialytic cracking (FCC) process. Particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the reduction of gas phase reduced nitrogen species (e.g. NF^HCN) in the off gas from a fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) regenerator operating in a partial or incomplete combustion mode.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
10002] In recent years there has been an increased concern in the United States and elsewhere about air pollution from industrial emissions of noxious oxides of nitrogen, sulfur and carbon. In response to such concerns, government agencies have in some cases already placed limits on allowable emissions of one or more of the pollutants, and the trend is clearly in the direction of increasingly stringent restrictions. [0003] NOX, or oxides of nitrogen, in flue gas streams exiting from fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) regenerators is a pervasive problem. Fluid catalytic cracking units (FCCU) process heavy hydrocarbon feeds containing nitrogen compounds a portion of which is contained in the coke on the catalyst as it enters the regenerator. Some of this coke nitrogen is eventually convened into NO* emissions, either in the FCC regenerator or in a downstream CO boiler. Thus all FCCUs processing nitrogen-containing feeds can have a NO* emissions problem due to catalyst regeneration. [0004] In an FCC process, catalyst particles (inventory) are repeatedly circulated between a catalytic cracking zone and a catalyst regeneration zone. During regeneration, coke (from the cracking reaction) deposits on the catalyst panicles are removed at elevated temperatures by oxidation with oxygen containing gases such as air. The removal of coke deposits restores the activity of the catalyst particles to the point where they can be reused in the cracking reaction. The coke removal step is performed over a wide range of oxygen availability conditions. At the minimum, there is typically at least enough oxygen to convert all the coke made to CO and HjO. At the maximum, the amount of oxygen available is equal to or greater than the amount necessary to oxidize all the coke to CO^ and H^O.<br>
[0005] In an FCC unit operating with sufficient air to convert essentially all of the cokijpn the catalyst to CO? and H^O, the gas effluent exiling the regenerator will contain "excess oxygen" (typically 0.5 to 4% of total off gas). This combustion mode of operation is usually called "full burn". When the fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) regenerator is operating in full burn mode, the conditions in the regenerator are for the most part oxidizing. That is. there is at least enough oxygen to convert (bum) all reducing gas phase species (e.g.. CO. ammonia. HCN) regardless of whether this actually happens during the residence time of these species in the regenerator. Under these conditions, essentially all of the nitrogen deposited with coke on the catalyst during the cracking process in the FCCU riser is eventually converted to molecular nitrogen or NOX and exits the regenerator as such with the off gas. The amount of coke nitrogen convened to NOX as opposed to molecular nitrogen depends on the design, conditions and operation of the FCCU and especially of the regenerator, but typically the majority of coke nitrogen exits the regenerator as molecular nitrogen.<br>
[0006] On the other hand, when the amount of air added to the FCCU regenerator is insufficient to fully oxidize the coke on the cracking catalyst to CO; and H?O. some of the coke remains on the catalyst, while a significant portion of the burnt coke carbon is oxidized only to CO. In FCCUs operating in this fashion, oxygen may or may not be present in the regenerator off gas. However, should any oxygen be present in the regenerator off gas. it is typically not enough to convert all of the CO in a gas stream to CO; according to the chemical stoichiometry of<br>
CO<br>
This mode of operation is usually called "partial bum." When an FCCU regenerator is operating in partial bum mode, the CO produced, a known pollutant, cannot be discharged untreated to the atmosphere. To remove the CO from the regenerator off gas and realize the benefits of recovering the heat associated with burning it, refiners typically bum the CO in the regenerator off gas with the assistance of added fuel and air in a burner usually referred to as "the CO boiler". The heat recovered by burning the CO is used to generate steam.<br>
[0007] When the regenerator is operating in partial bum. the conditions in the regdpsrator. where the oxygen added with air has been depleted and CO concentration has built up. are overall reducing. That is. there is not enough oxygen to convert/bum all reducing species regardless if some oxygen is actually still present. Under these conditions some of the coke-nitrogen is converted to so called "gas phase reduced nitrogen species'", examples of which are ammonia and HCN. NOX may sometimes also be present in the partial burn regenerator off gas, but typically only in small amounts. When these gas phase reduced nitrogen species are bumi in the CO boiler with the rest of the regenerator off gas. they can be oxidized to NOX, which is then emitted to the atmosphere. This NOX along with any "therma]" NOX formed in the CO boiler burner by oxidizing atmospheric N2 constitute the total NOX emissions of the FCCU unit operating in a partial or incomplete combustion mode.<br>
[0008] FCCU regenerators may also be designed and operated in a "incomplete burn" mode intermediate between full bum and partial bum modes. An example of such an intermediate regime occurs when enough CO is generated in the FCCU regenerator to require the use of a CO boiler, but because the amounts of air added are large enough to bring the unit close to full bum operation mode, significant amounts of oxygen can be found in the off gas and large sections of the regenerator are actually operating under overall oxidizing conditions. In such case, while gas phase reduced nitrogen species can still be found in the off gas. significant amounts of NOX are also present. In most cases a majority of this NOX is not converted in the CO boiler and ends up being emitted to the atmosphere.<br>
[0009] Yet another combustion mode of operating an FCCU is nominally in full burn with relatively low amounts of excess oxygen and/or inefficient mixing of air with coked catalyst. In this case, large sections of the regenerator may be under reducing conditions even if the overall regenerator is nominally oxidizing. Under these conditions reduced nitrogen species may be found in the regenerator off gas along with NOX.<br>
[0010] Various catalytic approaches have been proposed 10 control NOX emissions in the flue gas exiting from the FCCU regenerator. [0013] For example, recent patents, including U.S. Paienis 6.2SO:607, 6,129,834 and<br>
6.343,] 67, have proposed the use of NO* removal compositions for reducing. NO, elusions from an FCCU regenerator. U.S. Patent 6,165,933 also discloses a NOX reduction composition, which promotes CO combustion during an FCC catalyst regeneration process step while simultaneously reducing the level of NO* emitted during the regeneration step. NO* compositions disclosed by these patents may be used as an additive, which is circulated along with the FCC catalyst inventory or incorporated as an integral part of the FCC catalyst.<br>
[0012] In U.S. Patent 4,290,878, NOx,is controlled in the presence of a platinum-promoted CO oxidaiive promoters in a full bum combustion regenerator by the addition of iridium or rhodium on the combustion promoter in amounts lesser than the amount of Pt.<br>
[0013] U.S. Patent 4,973,399 discloses copper-loaded zeolite additives useful for reducing emissions of NOX from the regenerator of an FCCU unit operating in full CO-buming mode.<br>
[0014] U.S. Patent 4,368,057, teaches the removal of NHs contaminants of gaseous fuel by reacting the NHs with a sufficient amount of NOX.<br>
[0015] However, aforementioned prior art has failed to appreciate an FCC process which minimizes the amount of gas phase reduced nitrogen species, e.g. NFl:, and HCN, in the flue gas of an FCCU regenerator operating in a partial or incomplete combustion mode.<br>
[0016] Efforts to control ammonia released in an FCC regenerator operated in a partial or an incomplete mode of combustion have been known. [0017] For example, U.S. Patent 5,021,144 discloses reducing ammonia in an FCC regenerator operating in a partial burn combustion mode by adding a significant excess of the amount of a carbon monoxide (CO) oxidative promoter sufficient to prevent afterburn combustion in the dilute phase of the regenerator. [0018] U.S. Patent 4,755,282 discloses a process for reducing the content of ammonia in a regeneration zone off gas of an FCCU regenerator operating in a partial or incomplete combustion mode. The process requires passing a fine sized, i.e. 10 to 40 microns, ammonia decomposition catalyst to either the regeneration zone of an FCCU, or an admixture with the off gas from the regeneration zone of the FCCU, at a predetermined make-up rate such that the residence time of the decomposition<br>
the invention process catalyze the reaction of NO* with reductants typically found in WFCCU regenerator, e.g. CO, hydrocarbons and gas phase reduced nitrogen species, to form molecular nitrogen. Advantageously, the process of the invention provides a reduction in NO* in the regenerator prior to the NOX exiting the regenerator and being passed through the CO boiler and into the environment.<br>
10023] The process of the invention comprises providing a circulating inventory of cracking catalyst in a catalytic cracking vessel having a regeneration zone operated in a partial or incomplete combustion mode, with an oxidative catalyst/additive composition having the ability 10 oxidize gas phase reduced nitrogen species emissions to molecular nitrogen under catalytic cracking conditions, and circulating the oxidative catalyst/additive composition throughout the cracking vessel simultaneously with the cracking catalyst inventory during the catalytic cracking process.<br>
[0024] In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the process is a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process wherein the fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) regenerator is operated in a partial or incomplete combustion mode. In accordance with the process of the invention, the oxidative catalyst/additive is circulated throughout the FCCU along with the FCC catalyst inventory in a manner such that the residence time of the catalyst/additive composition in the FCCU regenerator relative to the residence time of the FCC cracking catalyst is the same or substantially the same. [0025] Advantageously, the process of the invention provides for a decrease in the content of gas phase reduced nitrogen species in the flue gas released from an FCCU regenerator operating in a partial or incomplete bum mode. The flue gas having the reduced content of reduced nitrogen species is passed to a CO boiler. In the CO boiler, as CO is oxidized to CO2- a lower amount of the gas phase reduced nitrogen species is oxidized to NOX, thereby providing an increase in the overall reduction of NOX emissions from the FCCU.<br>
[0026] Accordingly, it is an advantage of this invention to provide a process for reducing the content of gas phase reduced nitrogen species, e.g. NFk and HCN, in the flue gas exiting an FCC unit regenerator operating under a partial or incomplete mode of combustion. [0027] It is another advantage of this invention to provide a process for the reduction<br>
catalyst relative to the larger FCC catalyst particles will be short in the dense bed of ^regenerator due to rapid elutriation of the fine sized ammonia decomposition catalyst panicles. The fine sized elutriated decomposition catalyst particles are captured by a third stage cyclone separator and recycled to the regenerator of the FCCU. The decomposition catalyst may be a noble group metal dispersed on an inorganic support.<br>
[0019] U.S. 4,744.962 is illustrative of a post-treatment process to reduce ammonia in the FCCU regenerator flue gas. The post-treatment involves treating the regenerator flue gas to lessen the ammonia content after the gas has exiled the FCCU regenerator but before passage to the CO boiler.<br>
[0020] There remains a need in the refining industry for improved FCC processes which minimizes the content of gas phase reduced nitrogen species and NO* emitted from a partial or incomplete combustion FCCU regenerator which processes are simple and do not require additional equipment, time and expense typically associated with prior FCC processes for the removal of the gas phase reduced nitrogen species in the regenerator off gas.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0021] A catalytic cracking process has been developed which reduces the content of gas phase reduced nitrogen species, e.g. NH3 and HCN. in the flue gas released from a partial or incomplete burn regeneration zone of the catalytic cracking unit prior to exiting the regenerator and before passage to a CO boiler. Advantageously, the process of the invention converts gas phase reduced nitrogen species to molecular nitrogen during the catalytic cracking process in the presence of CO and other reductants and oxidizers typically found in the regeneration zone operated in partial burn, thereby preventing the conversion of the reduced nitrogen species to NOy in the CO boiler.<br>
[0022] Despite the reducing environment in an FCCU regenerator operated in a partial bum or incomplete bum mode, some NO* may form in the regenerator. In addition to controlling the content of gas phase reduced nitrogen species, the process of the invention also enhances the reduction of any NOX formed in the partial or incomplete burn regenerator during an FCC process. Paniculate compositions used in<br>
of NOX in the off gas of a partial or incomplete combustion FCCU regenerator by djginishment and control of gas phase reduced nitrogen species being emitted with the regenerator zone effluent.<br>
[0028] It is yet another advantage of this invention to provide a process for the reduction of the content of gas phase reduced nitrogen species, e.g. NHs and HCN, in an FCCU regenerator operating an partial or incomplete combustion mode utilizing a paniculate oxidatjve catalyst/additive having a particle size sufficient to permit the cataJyst/additive to be circulated throughout the FCCU simultaneously with the FCC catalyst inventory.<br>
[0029] Another advantage of this invention is to provide a process for reducing the gas phase reduced nitrogen species, e.g. NFJ3 and HCN, in the off gas of a partial or incomplete combustion FCCU regenerator wherein the gas phase reduced nitrogen species is reduced to molecular nitrogen thereby preventing their conversion to NOx. 10030] It is yet another advantage of this invention to provide a process for the reduction of gas phase reduced nitrogen species in an effluent stream passed from an FCC regenerator to a CO boiler, whereby as CO is oxidized to CO? a lesser amount of the reduced nitrogen species is oxidized to NO,,.<br>
[0031] Another advantage of this invention is to provide improved FCC processes characterized by a reduction of gas phase reduced nitrogen species in the effluent gas stream passed from the FCC regenerator to a CO boiler, which process eliminates the need and expense of additional processing equipment and steps hereto proposed in the post-treatment of the regenerator flue gas after exiting the FCCU regenerator. [0032] Another advantage of this invention is to provide improved FCC processes characterized by a reduction in the overall NO; emissions due to the reduction of gas phase reduced nitrogen species in the effluent gas stream passed from the FCC regenerator to a CO boiler.<br>
[0033] Yet, another advantage of the present invention is to provide improved FCC processes characterized by a reduction in the overall NO^ emissions due to the use of additives for reduction of gas phase reduced nitrogen species in the effluent gas stream passed from the FCC regenerator to a CO boiler, in combination with a "low NOV" CO boiler (thai is one designed for low thermal NOX generation), thereby resulting in even lower overall NO emissions than achievable with the use of the<br>
additive alone.<br>
UR034] Another advantage of this invention is to provide improved FCC processes<br>
characterized by a reduction in the overall NOX emissions from an FCCU regenerator<br>
operating in partial or incomplete combustion modes by catalyzing the reaction of<br>
NO, with CO and other reductants typically present in a partial or incomplete burn<br>
FCCU regenerator.<br>

gjgTATT .HP DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0041] For purposes of this invention the term "NO/' will be used herein to represent oxides of nitrogen, e.g. nitric oxide. (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NOz) the principal noxious oxides of nitrogen, as well as N?O4. N^Oj. and mixtures thereof. [0042] The term reduced "gas phase reduced nitrogen species" is used herein to indicate any gas phase species formed in the regenerator of a fluid catalj'tic craclcing unit during a fluid catalytic cracking process which gas species contain a nitrogen having a nominal charge of less than zero. Examples of gas phase reduced nitrogen species include, but are not limited to, ammonia (NHs). hydrogen cyanide (HCN), and the like.<br>
[0043] In accordance with the process of the invention, the content of NOX emitted during an FCC process operating in a partial or incomplete combustion mode is effectively brought to a lower and more acceptable level by reducing the amount of gas phase reduced nitrogen species present in the flue gas of the FCCU regenerator prior to passage of the gas to the CO boiler, where as CO is oxidized to CO2 a lesser amount of the reduced nitrogen species, e.g. NH3 and HCN, is oxidized to NOX and emitted into the atmosphere. The reduction of the gas phase reduced nitrogen species is accomplished by contacting the circulating cracking catalyst inventory with an amount of an oxidative catalystyadditive sufficient to reduce the content of the reduced nitrogen species in the regenerator off gas while the additive is circulated throughout the FCCU simultaneously with the circulating catalyst inventory. [0044] While the mechanism by which the process of the invention works to remove or minimize gas phase reduced nitrogen species is not precisely understood, it is believed that the process proceeds via two distinct mechanisms, either of which results in the conversion of reduced nitrogen species to molecular nitrogen. In one of the mechanisms, the gas phase reduced nitrogen species is partially oxidized to molecular N2. according to a reaction that for NH3 is:<br>
2NH3 -f 3/2O2 -&gt; N2 + 3H2O<br>
Alternatively, the gas phase reduced nitrogen species can be oxidized to a nitrogen oxide, most likely NO. The catalystyadditive then catalyzes the reduction of the resulting nitrogen oxide by reacting it with one of the reductants present in the<br>
regenerator, e.g. CO or unconverted ammonia. Additionally, the resultant NOX can be induced by reacting with the coke on the cracking catalyst being regenerated. For the gas phase reduced nitrogen species NHs, this mechanism proceeds according to the following reaction scheme:<br>
2NH3 + 5/2O2 -» 2NO + 3H2O 2NO + CO -» N2 + CO2 2ND + 2C -4 N2 + 2CO 2NO + C -4 2N2 + CO2<br>
+ 3NO -4 5/2N2 + 3H2O<br>
[0045] The invention process involves circulating an inventory of cracking catalyst and the gas phase reduced nitrogen species oxidative catalyst/additive in a catalytic cracking process, which presently is almost invariably the FCC process. For convenience, the invention will be described with reference to the FCC process although the present cracking process could be used in the older moving bed type (TCC) cracking process with appropriate adjustments in particle size to suit the requirements of the process. Apart from the addition of the oxidative catalyst/additive composition to the catalyst inventory and some possible changes in the product recovery section, discussed below, the manner of operating the process will remain unchanged. Thus, conventional FCC catalysts may be used, for example, zeolite based catalysts with a faujasiie cracking component as described in the seminal review by Venuto and Habib, Fluid Caialyric Cracking with Zeolite Catalysis, Marcel Dekker, New York 1979, ISBN 0-8247-6S70-] as we]] as in numerous other sources such as Sadeghbeigi, Fluid Catalytic Cracking Handbook, Gulf Publ. Co. Houston, 1995, ISBN 0-88415-290-1. Typically, the FCC catalysts consist of a binder, usually silica, alumina, or silica alumina, a Y type acidic zeolitic active component, one or more matrix aluminas and/or silica aluminas, and fillers such as kaolin clay. The Y zeolite may be present in one or more forms and may have been ultra- stabilized and/or treated with stabilizing cations such as any of the rare earths. [0046] Somewhat briefly, the fluid catalytic cracking process in which a heavy hydrocarbon feedstock will be cracked to lighter products takes place by contact of<br>
the feed in a cyclic catalyst rearculation cracking process with a circulating jQiidizable catalytic cracking catalyst inventory consisting of particles having a mean panicle size of from about 50 to about 150 u,m. preferably about 60 to about 100 |im. The significant steps in the cyclic process are:<br>
(i)        the feed is catalytically cracked in a catalytic cracking zone, normally a nser cracking zone, operating at catalytic cracking conditions by contacting feed with a source of hot, regenerated cracking catalyst to produce an effluent comprising cracked products and spent catalyst containing coke and strippable hydrocarbons;<br>
(ii) the effluent is discharged and separated, normally in one or more cyclones, into a vapor phase rich in cracked product and a solids rich phase comprising the spent catalyst;<br>
(iii)      the vapor phase is removed as product and fractionated in the FCC main column and its associated side columns to form gas and liquid cracking products including gasoline; (iv)      the spent catalyst is stripped, usually with steam, to remove<br>
occluded hydrocarbons from the catalyst, after which the stripped catalyst is oxidatively regenerated to produce hot. regenerated catalyst which is then recycled to the cracking zone for cracking further quantities of feed.<br>
[0047] Suitable feedstocks include petroleum distillates or residuals of crude oils which, when catalyticalJy cracked, provide either a gasoline or a gas oil product. Synthetic feeds having boiling points of about 204 °C to about 816 °C, such as oil from coal, tar sands or shale oil. can also be included.<br>
10048] Cracking conditions employed during the conversion of higher molecular weight hydrocarbons to lower molecular weight hydrocarbons include a temperature of 480 lo about 600 °C. A catalyst to hydrocarbon weight ratio of about 1 to 100, preferably about 3 to 20 is contemplated for the hydrocarbons conversion. The average amount of coke deposiled on the surface of the catalyst is between 0.5 weight percent and 3.0 weight percent depending on of the quality of the feed, the catalyst<br>
used, and the unit design and operation. Rapid disengagement of the hydrocarbons<br>
from the catalyst is accomplished in a quick-stripping zone either intrinsic within the<br>
1<br>
reactor or located in an external vessel. This stripping function is performed in the<br>
presence of steam or another inert gas at a temperature of about 480 °C to about 600 °C.<br>
[0049] The catalyst regeneration zone of the FCC process includes a lower dense bed of catalyst having a temperature of about 600 °C to about 800 °C and a surmounted dilute phase of catalyst having a temperature of from 600 °C to about 800 °C. As it is well known in the art, the catalyst regeneration zone may consist of a single or multiple reactor vessels. In order to remove coke from the catalyst, oxygen is added to the regeneration zone. This is performed by conventional means, such as for example, using a suitable sparging device in the bottom of the regeneration zone or, if desired, additional oxygen is added to other sections of the dense bed or the dilute phase of the regeneration zone.<br>
[0050] In the present invention it is preferable to provide an under-stoichiometric quantity of oxygen to operate the regeneration zone in a partial or incomplete combustion mode. For the purposes of this invention, the regeneration zone is operated in a partial or incomplete combustion mode, when any one the following conditions is satisfied: (1) there is not sufficient air or oxygen added to the regenerator to convert all the carbon in the coke on the spent cracking catalyst to CO2; (2) the effluent from the regenerator does not contain enough oxygen to convert all CO in the regenerator effluent to CO2; and/or (3) sufficient amount of CO is present in the regenerator effluent to require the use of a CO boiler to treat the regenerator effluent and convert the CO contained in the effluent to CO2 before having said FCCU regenerator effluent discharged to the atmosphere. [0051] Downstream of the regeneration zone, the solid catalyst and oxidative catalyst/additive particles and spent regeneration gas. comprising a small quantity of oxygen, as well as carbon monoxide plus carbon dioxide, water, and nitrogen oxides, and gas phase reduced nitrogen species are passed to a separation means. Preferably, the separation means comprises a series of cyclone separators wherein the particles will drop out of the bottom of the cyclone separators while the regeneration gas will<br>
be discharged in the overhead of the cyclone separator. After the regeneration off gas £^s been sufficiently separated from the solid particles in the separation means, the gas is passed to a CO boiler where added oxygen is provided to oxidize CO to CO2. The CO boiler or combustion zone is typically operated with auxiliary fuel in order to insure complete conversion of CO to carbon dioxide. Either upstream or downstream of the CO boiler, an electrostatic precipiiaior may be utilized to remove dust particles which are entrained in the regeneration off gas. A scrubber may also be used to reduce both particulates and SOX emissions from the unit.<br>
[0052] The oxidative catalyst/additives useful m the process of the invention may be any fluidizable material having the activity to oxidize gas phase reduced nitrogen species present in the off gas emitted from the regenerator zone of an FCCU operated in partial or incomplete combustion mode to molecular nitrogen under catalytic cracking conditions as the catalyst/additive is being circulated throughout the cracking unit along with the inventory of cracking catalyst. Typically, the catalyst/additives comprise a porous, amorphous or crystalline, refractory support material, e.g. an acidic metal oxide, a spinel, a hydrotalcite or the like, promoted with at least one metal component. Suitable metal promoters include, but are not limited, to alkali and/or alkaline earth metals, transition metals, rare earth metals. Platinum group metals. Group Ib metals. Group ETb metals. Group VIA metals, germanium, tin, bismuth: antimony and mixtures thereof. Platinum group metals are particularly preferred. Also preferred are transition metals and rare earth metals having oxygen storage capacity. The metal promoters are used in amounts sufficient to promote, under catalytic cracking conditions, ammonia oxidation and NOX reduction via the reaction of NOx with gas phase reductants, such as CO. hydrocarbons and the like, typically found in the regenerator of an FCCtJ operated at partial or incomplete bum.

[0056] Another class of materials useful as an oxidative catalyst/additive in the invention process include noble metal containing magnesium-aluminum spinel additive compositions as disclosed and described in U.S. Patent 4.790,982, said patent being herein incorporated in its entirety by reference.

[0057] Oxidative catalyst/additive compositions used in the process of the invention will typically be in the form of particles and will have a particle size sufficient to permit the compositions to be circulated throughout the catalytic cracking unit simultaneously with the cracking catalyst. Typically the catalyst/additives will have a mean particle size of greater than 45 Dm. Preferably, the mean particle size is from about 50 to 200 Dm, most preferably about 55 to 150. and even more preferred about<br>
60 to 120 Dm. The catalyst/additives have a surface area of at least 5 m^/g ,<br>
O	0<br>
preferably at least 10 m~/g, most preferably at least 30 rrr/g, and a Davison Attrition Index (DI) of 50 or less, preferably 20 or less, most preferably, 15 or less. [0058] The oxidative catalyst/additive may be used as separate catalyst/additive particles along with the crackine catalyst or may be incorporated into the cracking catalyst as a component of the catalyst. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the oxidative catalyst/additives are used as separate panicles along with the cracking catalyst inventory to permit optimal conversion of the gas phase reduced nitrogen species to nitrogen while maintaining acceptable product yields of the cracking catalysts.<br>
[0059] When used as a separate additive, the oxidative catalyst/additives are used in any amount sufficient to reduce the content of gas phase reduced nitrogen species present in the FCCU regenerator relative to the amount of said nitrogen species present without the use of the catalystyadditives. as measured by conventional gas analysis methodology, including but not limited to. chemiluminescence, UV spectroscopy and IR spectroscopy, and the like. Typically the catalyst/additives are used in an amount of at least 0.0] wt %. Preferably, the catalyst/additives are used in an amount ranging from about 0.0] to about 50 wt %, most preferably from about 0.] to about 20 wt % of the cracking catalyst inventory. Where the oxidative catalyst/additives have activity to promote CO oxidation, the amount of the catalyst/additives used is preferably an amount necessary to prevent afterburning in the catalytic cracking unit. Separate particles of the oxidative catalyst/additive may be added in the conventional manner, e.g. with make-up catalyst to the regenerator or by any other convenient method.<br>
[0060] When the oxidative catalyst/additive composition is incorporated into or onto the cracking catalyst as a separate component thereof, the catalyst/additive will typically be used in an amount of at least 0.01 weight percent of the cracking catalyst. Preferably, catalyst/additive will be used in an amount ranging from about 0.01 to 50 weight percent of the cracking catalyst; most preferably from about 0.1 to about 20 weight percent of the cracking catalyst.<br>
[0061] Other catalytically active components may be present in the circulating inventory of catalytic material in addition to the cracking catalyst and the ammonia<br>
removal additive. Examples of such other materials include the octane enhancing ij^jtalysts based on zeolite ZSM-5. CO combustion promoters based on a supported noble metal such as platinum, stack gas desulfurization additives such as DESOX® (magnesium aluminum spinel), vanadium traps and bottom cracking additives, such as those described in Krishna. Sadeghbeigi, op cii and Scherzer. Octane Enhancing Zeolhic FCC Catalysis, Marcel Delder. .New York, 1990. ISBN 0-8247-8399-9. These other components may be used in their conventional amounts. [0062] The effect of the present process to minimize the content of gas phase reduced nitrogen species is the reduction of the overall content of NOX emissions from an FCC process operating in a partial or incomplete burn mode. Very significant reduction in NO&gt;: emissions may be achieved by the use of the present process, in some cases up to about 90% relative to the base case using a conventional cracking catalyst, at constant conversion, using the preferred form of the catalyst described above. NOX reduction of 10 to 90% is readily achievable with the process according to the invention, as shown by the Examples below. However, as will be understood by the one skilled in the catalyst art, the extent of NO* reduction will depend on such factors as, e.g., the composition and amount of the additive utilized; the design and the manner in which the FCCU is operated, including but not limited to oxygen level and distribution of air in the regenerator, catalyst bed depth in the regenerator, stripper operation and regenerator temperature; the properties of the hydrocarbon feedstock cracked; and the presence of other catalytic additives that may affect the chemistry and operation of the regenerator. Thus, since each FCCU is different in some or all of these respects, the effectiveness of the process of the invention may be expected to vary from unit to unit.<br>
[0063] It is further expected that overall NO* emissions will be advantageously even lower when the process of the invention is used in combination with a CO boiler designed to make the lowest amount of thermal NOX practical. Typical FCC CO boilers are older technology and are not optimized for minimum thermal NOX emissions. Up grades to state-of the art low NOX designs are not expected to be effective due to the NOX precursors in the off gas from the partial bum regenerator. Low NOX burner design approaches and features are described e.g. in appropriate sections in "The John Zink Combustion Handbook", editor. Charles E. Baulkal, Jr..<br>
published by the CRC Press, 2001. The formation of NOX is minimized by avoiding both high temperature and high excess oxygen zones using flame back mixing, exhaust gas recycle to the burner make-up air, staged fuel injection, intense swirl mixing of air and fuel, longer cooler flames, and various combinations of any or all of these design strategies. The present invention enables the benefits of low NOX burner technology to be realized from an FCC CO boiler so modified, by minimizing the reduced nitrogen species available to be oxidized therein to NOX. The result is a new low NOX partial bum FCC system that can eliminate the need for capita] and operating cost-intensive systems like SCR, SNCR, scrubbers, and other approaches known in the an.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
[0068] The efficiency of the process of the invention for convening gas phase reduced nitrogen species released from an FCCU regenerator operating in a partial or incomplete bum mode to molecular nitrogen was evaluated in the Examples using a Regenerator Test Unit (RTU) and mode] reactions. The RTU is an apparatus specifically designed to simulate the operation of an FCCU regenerator.   The RTU is described in detail in G. Yaluris and A.W. Peters "Studying the Chemistry of the FCCU Regenerator Under Realistic Conditions." Designing Transportation Fuels for a Cleaner Environment, J.G. Reynolds and MR. Khan, eds., p. 151. Taylor &amp; Francis, 1999, ISBN: ]-56032-813-4 which description is herein incorporated by reference. [0069] The model reaction in the RTU for determining the efficiency of the invention process for converting gas phase reduced nitrogen species without converting the species to NOX was the reaction of NH3 over a cracking catalyst inventory containing the additive tested in the presence of CO and various amounts of O2. In this experiment NH3 represents the gas phase reduced nitrogen species, and CO and ©2 represent the other reductants and oxidizers typically found in a FCC unit regenerator operating in partial bum. As the O2 level in the reactor changes, the various reducing/oxidizing conditions that can be encountered from regenerator to regenerator or inside the same regenerator can be simulated. The key measurement in this experiment in addition to NH3 conversion, is how much of the NH3 is converted to NOX if any. It is desirable that the latter conversion is as low as possible for a wide range of O2 amounts in the reactor.<br>
[0070] The efficiency of the process of the invention to convert NO* after it is formed in a FCCU regenerator operating in partial bum was determined in the RTU by measuring the activity of an additive to reduce NOX with CO, a common reductant in every FCCU regenerator. The key performance measurement in this test is the NOX conversion. It is desirable to have high NOX conversion to nitrogen for a wide range of On amounts.<br>

[0071] Gas phase reduced nitrogen species are a reductant for reducing NOX after it is formed. The ability of an additive to catalyze this reaction while simultaneously converting the reduced nitrogen species to molecular nitrogen was determined by<br>
measuring in the RTU its activity for convening NH3 with NOX under various O2 ^rvels simulating the reducing/oxidizing conditions possible in a regenerator operating in partial burn. It is desirable in this experiment to have high NOX conversion to nitrogen.<br>
