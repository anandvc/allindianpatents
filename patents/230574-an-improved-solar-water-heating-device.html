				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an improved solar water heating device. The solar water heating device can be used in extremely cold areas.<br>
The solar water heating systems are as such known in the art. The conventional solar water heating system comprises a solar collector which has a number of water carrying pipes called risers for heating the water. The riser have fins attached to absorb solar radiation and transfer it to water through riser pipes. The top ends of the risers are connected to the top end of the water tank through the header pipe. The lower ends of risers are connected to the bottom of the water container through a bottom header, to allow the flow of cold and hot water from and into the water container during the day for heating the water.<br>
There are disadvantages associated with the conventional solar water heating systems. One of the main disadvantage is that the conventional systems cannot be used efficiently in the very cold areas wherein the water usually freezes.<br>
Another disadvantage is that if conventional systems are used the water has to be drained out in the evening to prevent it freezing.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that in some conventional systems a water pump is required for circulating the water through the collectors for heating the water.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that the conventional system works only when the tank is full of water to maintain the thermos-phonic action.<br>
Another disadvantage is that conventional systems get choked very soon if soft water is not available.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that the conventional systems are heavy and not transportable.<br>
Therefore, the main object of this invention is to provide a novel solar water heating device which obviates the disadvantages associated with the prior art.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a solar water heating device wherein the use of water pump is not at all required.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a solar water heating device wherein the daily drainage of water from the collector is not required as the device works even if the water freezes.<br>
Still another object of this invention is propose a solar water heating system which is efficient in working, does not get choked even if hard water is used and is of light weight for easy transportation.<br>
According to this invention an improved solar water heating device characterized in that is plurality of evacuated tube collector (ETC) mounted on a mounting rack, the upper end of ETC being connected to heat transferring and dissipating means provided in the bottom end of an insulated water container such that to convey and dissipate the heat energy from the ETC to the water.<br>
In accordance with this invention a solar water heating device has a plurality of evacuated tube collectors mounted on a mounting rack. The upper end of<br>
the evacuated tube collectors are connected to a heat transfer means disposed in the bottom end of a water container. The bottom end of the water container is of a unique design comprising a plurality of channels such that to accommodate the heat transfer and dissipation device therein. The heat transfer and dissipation device according to this invention comprises a hollow tube having holes at the bottom and upper surface thereof in an alternative relationship. Clamps are provided to connect the upper end of ETC with the pipe. The water container has a lid on the top surface thereof for supplying the water/snow therein for heating purposes.<br>
According to an option small pieces of pipes can be used instead a long pipe having holes.<br>
A solar water heater according to a preferred embodiment of this invention is herein described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
Fig. 1  shows   the   schematic   view   of  conventional  water   heater system;<br>
Fig.2  shows the side view of the invented solar water heater and; Fig. 3 shows the sectional view of the invented solar water heater.<br>
Referring to the drawings particularly Fig. 1 the conventional solar water heater comprises a plurality of water flow tubes 1 connected to the input and output headers/manifold 2 and 3 respectively. The input header 2 is connected to the bottom end of a water container 4 to facilitate the supply of cold water into the water heating tubes 1. The output headers/manifold 3 is connected to the upper end of the water container 4 for delivering hot water into the water container 4. The assembly comprising water tubes 1 and water headers 2 and 3 are provided with a solar heat collector 5 such that the water flowing into the tubes 1 is heated during the day time. A cold water inlet 6 and hot water outlet 7 is provided with the water tank for supplying cold water into the water tank and collecting hot water from the water tank. These features are as such known in the prior art and do not constitute inventive features.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 2 and 3, the solar water heater of this invention has a plurality of evacuated tube collector (ETC) 1 mounted on a mounting rack. The upper end of the evacuated tubes 1 are<br>
connected to a heat transferring and dissipating means 4 provided in the bottom end of an insulated water container 5 such that to transfer the solar heat energy into the bottom portion of the water container 5 for heating the water therein. The heat dissipation means comprises a hollow tube 4 having holes 6 provided at the upper and lower surfaces thereof in an alternative relationship to dissipate heat by conduction as well as convention. The bottom end of the water container has a plurality of channels 7 such that to accommodate the heat transfer and dissipation means 4 therein. The bottom end of the container 5 is also provided with an insulation material. A lid/cover 8 is provided at the opening provided at the top surface of the water container 5 for facilitating the supply of water/snow into said water container 5. Small pieces of pipes 9 can be clamped with the ETC 1 instead of long hollow tubes 4.<br>
During the day time the heat energy is collected by the evacuated tubes collectors (ETC) without any loss. As the heat dissipation means 4 is in<br>
contact with water/snow, the water/snow is heated/melted<br>
and  thus heating of water takes place.  The cold  water<br>
get  into  the hollow tube(s) of  the  heat  dissipation<br>
device  through the opening. Thus, it is seen that  even<br>
if  the water in the container is frozen after  a  small<br>
time the ice near the heat dissipation device will  melt<br>
and the heatinq of the water/snow is started.<br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIMS;<br>
