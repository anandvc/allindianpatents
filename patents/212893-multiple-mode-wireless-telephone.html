MULTIPLE MODE WIRELESS TELEPHONE Background of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to wireless telephones, and has particular relation to wireless telephones which may be used in multiple modes, such as audio, video, Internet, and the like.<br>
It is expected of a wireless telephone only that it will have a keypad, a microphone, and an earpiece or other speaker. In this respect, it is like a wireline telephone. If video or Internet capabilities are to be added on to a wireline telephone, the add-on nature of these capabilities is apparent. No one expects a conventional wireline telephone to have video or Internet capabilities. These capabilities are instead provided by a personal computer (PC). The only significant connection between the PC and the telephone is that they share the same telephone line.<br>
Miniaturization has proceeded more quickly in wireless telephones than in wireline telephones because light weight and low power consumption are so much more important. It has thus become possible, at least in semi-portable telephones, for a wireless telephone to have video and Internet capabilities. What has not yet been possible is for these capabilities to be designed in a user-friendly configuration.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
This invention overcomes these difficulties'by providing a video monitor which is thin enough for a touch-screen to slide partially beneath it, with enough room for a touch¬screen-cover to slide between them. The touch-screen-cover, when not slid between the touch-screen and the monitor, covers the part of the touch-screen which the monitor does not cover. When the touch-screen-cover is slid between the touch-screen and the monitor, it does two things. First, it exposes the parts of the touch-screen which are not covered by the monitor. Second, it allows the touch-screen to be slid completely out<br><br>
from underneath the monitor, thereby exposing all of the touch-screen. Thus, the touch¬screen may be completely covered, partially covered, or completely uncovered. Each covering configuration is suited for a different set of wireless telephone capabilities.<br>

Brief Description of the Drawines<br>
FIG. 1 shows the exterior of a wireless telephone (100), in front plan view (left) and side section view (right), when configured for audio or video use. It includes a video camera (102), earpiece (104), video monitor (106), navigation key (108), touch-screen-cover (110), touch-screen (112), housing (114), and microphone (116). Actual processing of the telephone call is done by a transceiver (118), which is connected to the other elements mentioned above. A speaker (120) may be provided on the bade of the telephone (100) if hands-free capabilities are desired. In this case, a retractable stand (122) allows the telephone (100) to be placed upright on a desktop or other horizontal surface. This is particularly desirable in video mode, since a hand-held telephone produces an unsteady image. If not, the earpiece (104) acts as a speaker.<br>
The navigation key (108) is preferably an up-down-left-right key, to navigate around the monitor (106) and the touch-screen (112). It lies substantially coplanar with the face of the monitor (106), so that it may be operated regardless of whether the touch¬screen (112) is closed or open.<br><br>
A touch-screen positron detector (124) detects the position of the touch-screen (112), and a touch-screen-cover position detector (126) detects the position of the touch¬screen cover (110).<br>
The touch-screen-cover (110) may be slid upward between the monitor (106) and the touch-screen (112), thereby exposing the lower portion of the touch-screen (112). As shown in FIG. 1, it lies between, and substantially parallel to, the face of the monitor (106) and the face of the touch-screen (112). The touch-screen (112) may be programmed to display a soft version of a conventional, hard key, keypad. The touch-screen-cover (110) slides between a closed position (see FIG. 1), in which it covers the face of the touch-screen (112), and an open position (see FIG. 2) in which it exposes the face of the touch-screen (112) and lies substantially behind the face of the monitor (106).<br>
The telephone (100) is programmed such that, when the soft keys on the keypad are touched, it places a call just as if it were responding to a conventional, hard key, keypad. The soft keys may be used to select whether the call is to be placed in audio mode or video mode. The monitor (106) may display the partially keyed in number (to assure that the number is being correctly keyed in) or not (for privacy).<br>
Alternatively, the touch-screen-cover (110) may remain in its closed position. In this case, operation of the navigation key (108) may cause a list of memorized telephone numbers to appear on the monitor. The navigation key (108) typically has four positions: up, down, left, and right. Up and down are used to scroll through the list, left is used to call the number which the scroll currently displays, and right is used to cancel the previous action (or hang up the phone). The telephone (100) may be programmed such that, upon first actuation of the navigation key (108), a list of memorized numbers immediately appears, to be called in audio mode. Alternatively, it may be programmed to display a menu of actions, such as place call in video mode, turn on data access but not the transmitter (useful in airplanes or other situations in which transmission must be suppressed), and the like. Keeping die touch-screen-cover (108) in its closed position reduces the possibility of accidentally placing a call.<br>
The telephone (100) may conveniently be constructed such that, if it is off, it turns on in response to receiving an open-position signal from the touch-screen-cover position detector (124). It may likewise conveniently be constructed such that, if it is engaged in a<br><br>
call, it hangs up in response to receiving a closed-position signal from the touch-screen-cover position detector (124).<br>
FIG. 2 shows the same phone when configured for data use. The touch-screen-cover (110) has been slid under the monitor (106), and the touch-screen (112) itself has been slid down, out from underneath the monitor (106). Thus, all of the touch-screen (106) is exposed as a user interface. The touch-screen (106) carries the microphone (116), so that Voice-Over-Internet-Protocol (VOIP), or some similar mixed audio-and-data protocol, may be used. The touch-screen (112) lies behind, and substantially parallel to, the face of the monitor (106). In its closed position, its face is panially covered by the monitor (106). In its open position, its face is uncovered by the monitor (106).<br>
The transceiver (118) enters different modes of operation (described below) of the microphone (104), speaker (104), camera (102), monitor (106), and touch screen (112). It is preferred that the camera (102) be present, and that the touch-screen (112) be slidable. However, the present invention also works without either or both of these features.<br>
FIG. 3 shows the telephone (100), configured for data use, in Internet mode. The extended touch-screen (112) shows whatever web page the user has downloaded from a remote server. Alternatively, it shows the web page which the user is preparing to upload- The user may scroll through a menu, preferably with the navigational key (108) to enter Internet mode. Alternatively, the user may configure the telephone (100) such that the act of extending the touch-screen (112) causes the touch-screen position detector (124) to send a signal to a transceiver (120) causes the telephone to enter Internet mode.<br>
FIG. 4 shows the telephone (100) in keyboard mode. The touch-screen (112), instead of displaying soft keys for entry of a telephone number, displays soft keys for a conventional typewriter keyboard. This allows alphanumeric data to be entered more quickly than by attempting to adapt a numeric telephone keypad to the entry of alpha data.<br>
Keyboard mode may be combined with Internet mode to form e-mail mode. In this mode, characters are entered on the touch-screen (112) and are shown, ready for transmission, on the monitor (106), As shown in FIG. 4, this is particularly convenient<br><br>
for right-handed users. The left hand holds the housing (114), and the right hand touches the touch-screen (112).<br>
FIG. 5 shows how the apparatus of FIG. 4 may be adapted for left-handed users. Software in the transceiver (118) inverts the right-handed image. In a right-handed image, the right side of the touch-screen (112), as seen in FIG. 1, becomes the top of the page. In a left-handed image, it is the left side of the touch-screen (112) which becomes the top of the page. This inversion may take place whenever a left-handed user has requested it, and is not limited to keyboard mode.<br>
FIG. 6 shows the telephone (100) in Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) mode. Software in the transceiver (118) configures the touch-screen (112) to emulate any desired PDA, or to create a new one. Depending on the PDA desired, the touch-screen (112) may be in either the closed or open position. FIG. 6 shows the closed position.<br>
FIG. 7 shows a preferred construction of the touch-screen position detector (124): a first set of contacts (128) when the touch-screen (112) is in the closed position, and a second set of contacts (130) when the touch-screen (112) is in the open position. FIG. 7 shows the contacts as being only on a printed circuit board carried on the housing (114), but they could also be on the touch-screen (112), or on both. The touch-screen-cover position detector (126) preferably has a similar construction.<br>
