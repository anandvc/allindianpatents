				<td>A PROCESS FOR EXTRACTION OF NICKEL FROM LOW GRADE<br>
CHROMITE ORE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the extraction of nickel from low-grade<br>
chromite ore. Particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the extraction<br>
of nickel and cobalt from low-grade chromite ore.<br>
Background Art<br>
Nickel is a strategic metal which finds use in steel, chemical, cryogenics, food<br>
processing, and aerospace industries. The present consumption of nickel in India is<br>
estimated to be -20,000 tons per annum (tpa), and its annual growth rate is 5-7%.<br>
With rapid industrial growth, the demand for ferro-nickel is likely to exceed the<br>
projected figure. Most of the demand for nickel is presently being met through<br>
imports incurring foreign exchange worth of -Rs.1000 crores per year. Cobalt is also<br>
a strategic metal and its demand in India is -150 tpa. In the present process cobalt is<br>
recovered as a by-product. The only nickel deposit in India is in the Sukinda region of<br>
Orissa. i he resources are estimated to be approximately 32 million tons in lateritic<br>
deposits oi Sukinda region having ~1% nickel in the non-chromite and approximately<br>
200 million tonne as low-grade chromite ore having an average of 0.7% nickel. For<br>
any commercial exploitation of Sukinda deposit for reasonable period of time low<br>
grade chromite ore will be the largest resource. Large stock piling of low-grade ore<br>
(which cannot be exploited for recovery of chromite) in Sukinda region has lead to<br>
environmental problem. It destroys natural forests around the mines and may<br>
contribute hexavalent chromium to water stream. In the world, presently there is no<br>
operating plant using such low-grade nickel containing materials particularly the lowgrade<br>
chromite ore.<br>
The major oxide ore deposits are in Indonesia, Phillipines, Cuba, Dominical Republic,<br>
Colombia, and New Caledonia. While the Colombian ore is perhaps the richest with<br>
more than 2.9% nickel, the poorest ores being commercially used are from Nicaro,<br>
Cuba and Kazakstan, containing ~ 1.1% nickel. The discarded low grade chromite ore<br>
generated at Sukinda region of Orissa, India contains in an average only -0.7%<br>
nickel.<br>
Reference may be made to one of the conventional methods for dissolution of nickel<br>
from these laterites by acid pressure leaching for which a commercial plant at Moa<br>
Bay is in operation (E.T Carlson, C.S Simons, Journal of Metals, 1960. 198(3), p 206-<br>
213) and another plant based on pressure leaching-solvent extraction has been set<br>
up in Australia.<br>
The other method is by reduction-roasting followed by oxidative ammoniacal<br>
leaching and is named as Caron's process (M.S. Caron, United State Patent 1.487,145.<br>
March 18, 1924). A number of commercial plants including one at Nicaro. Cuba and<br>
the other at Greenvale, Australia are in operation. Many International Conferences<br>
have since been devoted to the advances in metallurgy of nickel and cobalt (e.g.,<br>
International Laterite Symposium, AIME-SME Annual Meeting, New Orleans,<br>
February 1979, International Symposium on Nickel Metallurgy held at Montreal<br>
1986, Symposium on Metallurgy of Nickel and Cobalt, held at Arizona, Jan 25th to<br>
28lh, 1988, Nickel and Cobalt 97-International Symposium held at Sudbury, Ontario,<br>
Canada during Aug. 17-20 1997). The most widely commercially applicable process is<br>
still the Caron's process (M.H. Caron, Journal of Metals, 1950, vol. 188(1), p 67-90).<br>
In this process the nickel ore is reduced and treated with ammonia-ammonium<br>
carbonate solution in the presence of compressed air. During leaching the reduced<br>
nickel and cobalt form soluble amine complexes and the reduced iron comes first to<br>
solution as ferrous amine and subsequently gets oxidized to hydrated ferric oxide. The<br>
time required for almost complete dissolution of desired metals and precipitation of<br>
iron in the commercial plants is about six hours. Although most of the nickel in the<br>
world is present as oxide, due to ease of beneficiation, sulphides of nickel are the<br>
major source of nickel production. But with depletion of good grade sulphide ore,<br>
slowly the use of oxides for nickel extraction is increasing. Currently, roughly about<br>
40% of the nickel is produced from oxide ore.<br>
Drawbacks of the earlier processes<br>
(i) All the processes for extracting nickel and cobalt known as of date use nickel<br>
ore containing -1.1 to 1.5% Ni. The low-grade chromite ore containing 0.5 to<br>
0.9% nickel has never been used in any process in the world following<br>
leaching with ammonia - ammonium carbonate solution,<br>
(ii) The results on continuous test work are not available for low-grade chromite<br>
ore.<br>
( i i i ) In all the existing plants oil is mixed with the dried ore prior to feeding to the<br>
furnace for reduction, and nowhere in the world reduction step has been<br>
carried out without mixing oil to the ore prior to reduction.<br>
( i v ) The present plants use compressed air for oxidation and dissolution of nickel<br>
in the leaching reactors. The retention time of about six hours is required to<br>
complete nickel dissolution and iron precipitation. In order to reduce the<br>
retention time, no efforts have been reported.<br>
(v) The use of compressed air during leaching requires elaborate ammonia<br>
recovery system to minimize ammonia losses from the vent gases.<br>
(vi) The leach residues obtained after Ni recovery from the lateritic ore contains<br>
primarily magnetite. These residues are being discarded. No efforts have been<br>
reported for the utilization of these residues.<br>
Due to lack of information on utilization of low Ni containing material such as lowgrade<br>
chromite ore, studies have never been done to exploit this resource for the<br>
recovery of nickel and cobalt.<br>
Objects of the Present Invention:<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the extraction<br>
of nickel from low-grade chromite ore.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to enhance leaching rate with gaseous<br>

6. Fire Extinguisher<br>
The operating principles for each section are described below:<br>
Ore Preparation (Section 100, Step-1)<br>
The flow diagram for Section 100 (ore preparation) is shown in Fig 2. The raw<br>
material is stored in the storage area SY-101, which is an area at the ground level with<br>
suitable curbing on all four sides to avoid spread of material. SY-101 is housed inside<br>
a covered shed to avoid rain or water ingress. The raw material is loaded manually<br>
into container CN-101, mounted on a trolley TR-101. The trolley is placed below the<br>
overhead electric hoist EH-101. The electric hoist lifts the container CN-101 and<br>
unloads the raw material into a grizzley GR-101. The material with size -50 mm<br>
passes through GR-101 and is fed into the hopper H-101. The oversize material is<br>
manually broken and fed again to grizzley GR-101.<br>
The material collected in hopper H-101 is fed into a jaw-cum-roll crusher JC-101<br>
through a vibratory feeder VF-101. JC-101 reduces the size of the raw material to -6<br>
mm. The oversize (+ 6 mm) from jaw crusher JC-101 is fed to a roll crusher RC-101.<br>
The sized output from the combined unit of Jaw-cum-Roll crusher JC-101 and Roll<br>
crusher RC-101 is discharged on a belt conveyor BC-101 which feeds to a bucket<br>
elevator BE-101. The bucket elevator delivers the material to an overhead storage bin<br>
H-102, which discharges the material to a screw feeder SF-101. The discharge of SF-<br>
101 is fed to a drum drier D-101. The material is dried co-currently in drum dryer D-<br>
101 by passing products of combustion of o:
the dryer. ST-102 provides oil to the burner - ed to the combustion chamber. This<br>
tank receives oil from the main oil storage tank. Air to the combustion chamber is<br>
provided by fan/blower B-101. The output from the dryer is dried material with 1-3%<br>
tree moisture and 10-11% bound moisture. The material from D-101 is collected in a<br>
hopper H-103.<br>
The dried material from hopper H-103 is fed into a ball mill BM-101 at the specified<br>
rate through a rotary valve RV-101. The rotary valve also prevents ingress of air to<br>
the ball mill when material is being fed into it. A blower B-102 supplies air to the ball<br>
mill which of air swept type. In the ball mill BM-101, the dried material is reduced in<br>
size to 85% -200 mesh B.S.S.<br>
The finer part of discharge from drum dryer D-101 goes directly to day storage bin H-<br>
104 by bucket elevator BE-102 through a cyclone separator C-101 and BF-101. The<br>
discharge from ball mill BM-101 passes through a cyclone separator C-102, rotary<br>
valve RV-102, and collected in the day storage bin H-104 by bucket elevator BE-102.<br>
The gases/air containing solid particles which comes out of the dryer &amp; ball mill<br>
passes through the cyclone separators C-101 and C-102, bag filters BF-101 and BF-<br>
102 and gas/air is discharged through blowers B-104 and B-103 to the atmosphere<br>
through stacks STA-101 and STA-102 respectively.<br>
The storage bin H-104 has a capacity to store one day's requirement (-10 tons) of<br>
dried raw material. The material from H-104 is discharged into a trolley container<br>
CN-102A&amp;B which is placed on a trolley TR-102A/B. CN-102A/B has a capacity of<br>
-0.5 tons. Oil (as and when required) is manually mixed with the ore and the trolley is<br>
pushed on rails below a hoist EH-102 which lifts the container and discharges the<br>
material into the hopper H-105 on top of MHF-20L From the hopper the material is<br>
delivered to screw conveyor SC-101 at the required rate. The rate of feeding to MHF-<br>
201 can be varied by adjusting the valve provided in the discharge of hopper H-105.<br>
A rotary valve RV-103 is provided at the outlet of screw conveyer SC-101 for feeding<br>
of COB at a constant rate to MHF. This also avoids escape of flue gases from the<br>
MHF into the atmosphere.<br>
The oil storage tank ST-101 receives the oil from main oil storage tank and supplies<br>
oil to the combustion chamber of the MHF-201.<br>
Reduction Roasting (Section 200, Step-2)<br>
The flow diagram for reduction roasting is given in Fig. 3.<br>
The pre-processed raw material from section 100 (85% - 200 Mesh B.S.S. containing<br>
i free moisture) is fed into the Maniple Hearth Furnace MHF-201 from the<br>
hopper H-105. MHF-201 has a capacity to process 500 kg of raw material per hour.<br>
The MHF-201 is a 17-hearth furnace (0-16), with four rabble arms per hearth. The<br>
raw material in the MHF is heated by means of gases coming from the combustion<br>
chambers CC-201 A and B. The products of combustion chambers are fed into the<br>
MHF-201 through suitable ducting to deliver the gases at hearth numbers 15.13 and<br>
1 1 . The two combustion chambers are located diametrically opposite to each other.<br>
The rabble arms are rotated by means of a central shaft which is air cooled. The<br>
cooling air to the shaft is supplied by blower B-202. The hot air after cooling the<br>
central shaft is used in the pre heating of hearths and is partly let out through the stack<br>
STA-201.<br>
The combustion chambers CC-201 A/B are supplied with Light Diesel Oil (LDO)<br>
from the oil storage tank ST-101 (ref Fig-2). The combustion air required is supplied<br>
by blower B-201. The burners of the combustion chambers are dual fuel fired type,<br>
with a provision to burn producer gas also. The oil supply to CC-201 A/B is measured<br>
by means of flow transmitters.<br>
The MHF-201 can be divided into three zones. The first zone comprising of hearths 0<br>
to 3 is the ore-preheating zone. Hearths 4 to 14 comprise of the reduction roasting<br>
zone and hearths 15 and 16 comprise of the soaking zone. The total residence time in<br>
the MHF can be controlled by varying the shaft speed. The flue gases composed of<br>
CO, COo and H2 from CC-201 A/B come in contact with the feed material through hot<br>
gas ducts in the reduction roasting zone and the material gets reduced. The reducing<br>
atmosphere is maintained in the MHF-201 by additionally injecting LDO/fresh<br>
producer gas through nozzles provided in this zone. The rate of addition of producer<br>
gas can be measured by flow transmitter. The desired CO-CO2 ratio is maintained.<br>
The unreacted CO and Hi in the reducing gas are burnt in the preheating zone by<br>
injecting hot air which is provided through the shaft cooling blower B-202. The MHF-<br>
201 is provided with nozzles for sampling both gas and solid at various locations. The<br>
temperature profile of the MHF-201 is measured and recorded by a multi-point<br>
temperature scanner.<br>
The hot flue gases at about 425°C are let out from MHF-201 from the top. Any solid<br>
carry over in the flue gases is recovered in the dust recovery system comprising of a<br>
multi cyclone separator C-201. The solids are re-introduced into MHF-201 through<br>
motorized rotary valve RV-201. The gases from C-201 are then passed through<br>
ventury scrubber VS-201 and demister S-201 before being discharged to the<br>
atmosphere by blower B-203. Water is circulated using pump P-201 in the ventury<br>
scrubber VS-201 and demister S-201 at a constant rate to cool and clean the exhaust<br>
gases.<br>
The reduced low-grade chromite ore from MHF-201 is discharged into a jacketed<br>
screw conveyer SC-201A. Cold water is circulated in the jacket for cooling the<br>
reduced low-grade chromite ore. The cooled material is further conveyed through<br>
another screw conveyer SC-201B into the quench tank SV-301. The temperature of<br>
the cooled material is less than 250°C.<br>
Leaching (Section 300, Step-3)<br>
In the leaching section there are two options namely<br>
(i) Use of oxygen during leaching at elevated pressure<br>
(ii) Use of compressed air at elevated pressure<br>
Leaching using gaseous oxygen at elevated pressure<br>
The process flow diagram for leaching with oxygen gas is shown in Fig 4 (a).<br>
The reduced ore after cooling in SC-201A&amp;B is discharged continuously in a sealed<br>
atmosphere into the quench tank SV-301. The quench tank receives solution<br>
containing ammonia, ammonium carbonate and nickel through two streams<br>
separately from ST-301 by using pump P-304 (after cooling it to about 38°C in a<br>
double pipe heat exchanger E-301) and from storage tank ST-401 by using pump P-<br>
401 (refer Fig.5). Make up ammonia-ammonium carbonate solution may be fed to the<br>
quench tank SV-301 from the solution preparation tanks SV-401/SV-502 using pumps<br>
P-507 and P-508 (ref. Fig.6) to obtain the required concentration of leachant. The<br>
coolant in E-301 is cooling water. In the quench tank SV-301 the hot solids are added<br>
to the quench liquor to form required slurry concentration with an outlet temperature<br>
of around 40°C. The quenched slurry is pumped to the first reactor, R-301A by pump<br>
P-301. The slurry overflows to reactor R-301B by gravity. Oxygen is supplied to both •<br>
the leaching reactors by maintaining the desired gauge pressure. Oxygen supply to the<br>
reactors is controlled by pressure control valves which are maintained at the desired<br>
pressure. The slurry, after leaching is transferred due to the pressure in the reactor R-<br>
30IB to the leach slurry thickener TH-301A. The oxidizing ammonia leach is done in<br>
the presence of excess ammonia to prevent precipitation of nickel and cobalt as<br>
hydroxides, resulting in a pH of about 10-11 in the pregnant leach solution. The<br>
thickened underflow from TH-301A is pumped to the CCD section by pump P-302 to<br>
TH-401 A. The overflow from TH-301A flows by gravity to ST-301.<br>
The flow rates of quench slurry, leached slurry, and pregnant leach solution to the<br>
section for precipitation of nickel salt and to quench tanks are controlled through<br>
valves and the flows are indicated by transmitters/ indicators. As stated above part of<br>
the leach solution from the storage tank ST-301 is pumped to SV-301 through the<br>
cooler E-301. The other part of the leach liquor goes to filter press FI-301A &amp;B by<br>
pump P-303. The filtrate is collected in storage tank ST-304 from where it is fed to<br>
the tower T-501 by pump P-305.<br>
Leaching Using Compressed Air at elevated pressure<br>
The procedure for leaching with compressed air is similar except that the number of<br>
reactors and thickeners are more for providing longer retention time. The flow<br>
diagrams for leaching using compressed air are shown in Fig 4 (b) and 4 (c).<br>
In case of air leaching, the leaching operation is carried out in two stages, the first<br>
stage consisting of four reactors R-301A to R-301D and the second stage consisting<br>
of three reactors R-301E to R-301G. The flow of slurry between the reactors within<br>
each stage is by gravity. The last reactor of the first stage R-301D discharges slurry<br>
by gravity into the first thickener TH-301 A, from where the underflow is pumped into<br>
the first reactor of the second stage R-301E. The clear solution overflowing from TH-<br>
301 A is collected in the storage tank ST-301. A part of this solution is pumped to the<br>
quench tank SV-301 through a cooler E-301. Another portion of the leach solution<br>
is pumped to the BNC precipitation section (Section 500) through a batch filters FI-<br>
301A &amp; B for further processing. The filter is used to remove any residual solids from<br>
the leach solution.<br>
The thickened underflow from TH-301 A is pumped by P-302 to the first reactor R-<br>
301E of the second stage leaching. From R-301E, the slurry flows to reactors R-301F<br>
and R-301G and finally to the thickener TH-301B by gravity. The clear solution from<br>
TH-301B is collected in storage tank ST-302 and a part of it is pumped to the quench<br>
tank and another part is recycled back to R-301E, by pump P-307. The underflow<br>
from TH-301B is pumped to the CCD section (sec. 400) by pump P-306. The vents<br>
are connected to a ventury scrubbing system.<br>
Counter Current Decantation (Section 400, Step- 4)<br>
In this section, separation of pregnant leach solution from leach residue and washing<br>
of the pulp with ammonia-ammonium carbo -olution is carried out using a series<br>
ol thicKeners TH-401A, B, C, D and E as &gt;. in Fig.5. The washing of the leach<br>
residue is done counter currently. The underflow slurry is pumped from one thickener<br>
to another by pumps P-402 to P-405. Pump P-406 is used to discard the washed slurry<br>
from TH-405 to the tailings pond. The flow of slurry and flow of clear overflow from<br>
one thickener to another is as shown in the Fig.5.<br>
Precipitation of nickel salt and Ammonia Recovery (Section 500, Step- 5)<br>
The flow diagram for this section is given in Fig. 6. The leach solution containing<br>
dissolved nickel from the leach solution storage tank ST-304 is pumped by P-305 to<br>
the top of a stripping column, T-501. Steam is admitted at the desired pressure from<br>
the bottom of the column for stripping of ammonia and carbon dioxide from the<br>
pregnant leach solution. The descending solution is gradually depleted of ammonia<br>
until nickel precipitates as basic nickel carbonate (BNC). The dissolved cobalt also<br>
co-precipitates in this step.<br>
The mixed nickel and cobalt salt is precipitated in the column is discharged from the<br>
bottom at 
cooled with water circulation before pumping it to batch filter FI-501A/B. The cake<br>
from the filter is recovered, weighed and analyzed for nickel and other metals. The<br>
filtrate is collected in the storage tank ST-505 and pumped to the thickener TH-401E<br>
for washing of the final tailings coming from thickener TH-401D of section 400.<br>
The vapors from the tower T-501 are condensed in the heat exchanger E-501. The<br>
gases are cooled by cooling water circulation in it. The condensed liquid containing<br>
ammonia is collected in the condensate tank ST-502. The uncondensed vapors from<br>
E-501 are sent to an absorption tower T-502 for the recovery of residual ammonia.<br>
The gases are scrubbed with fresh water fed from the top of the tower T-502 and or by<br>
re-circulation of lean ammonia solution from ST-503. The vapors free of ammonia are<br>
discharged to the atmosphere. The ammonia solution from ST-502 is cooled in a<br>
water cooled double piped heat exchanger E-502 and is pumped to ammonia -<br>
ammoium carbonate preparation tanks SV-401/ SV-502.<br>
For startup and make up for losses in ammonia, liquor ammonia from days storage<br>
tank ST-504 is charged to solution preparation tanks SV-401/ SV-502 using pumps P-<br>
507 and P-508. Make up ammonium carbonate is added manually to SV-401 / SV-<br>
502. While preparing these solutions, the recovered ammonia -ammonium carbonate<br>
from storage tank ST-502 and lean ammonia solution from storage tank ST-503 are<br>
utilized.<br>
Start- up<br>
The process of the present invention is directed towards a continuous process in<br>
which the low-grade chromite ore is continuously processed in the pilot plant to<br>
produce nickel and cobalt salt. In order to reach a continuous steady state, various<br>
vessels need to be loaded with start up materials.<br>
Section 100<br>
First of all, truck loads of nickel containing low grade chromite ore from Orissa<br>
Mining Corporation's chromite mines site at Sukinda area of Orissa, were brought to<br>
the pilot plant site and stored in the storage area provided for the purpose. The ore<br>
was treated as described in section 100 and stored in hopper H-104. Depending on the<br>
feed rate to the reduction furnace this section operated for eight to twelve hours a day.<br>
Section 200<br>
After erection of furnace, the burners of the two combustion chambers CC-201A and<br>
B are fired one by one. The curing of refractories was done by slowly raising the<br>
temperature up-to 800°C over a total period of 110 hours. To start operation of the<br>
furnace, the dead bed of ore on hearths was filled up. Grounded ore from H-105 is fed<br>
to the furnace through SC-101. The rabble arm was kept in motion as the ore after<br>
filling the top hearth moves down to fill the lower hearths. Ore was continuously fed<br>
to the furnace. In order to achieve the desired reducing atmosphere, the air to the<br>
combustion chamber was reduced to approximately sixty percent of the total<br>
theoretical air requirement. On attainment of desired temperature (700-800°C in<br>
reduction zone), the dried ore with or without addition of light diesel oil is charged at<br>
the required rate varying between 200 to 500 kgs/hr. The reducing atmosphere is<br>
maintained in the furnace in order to complete the reduction reactions. To avoid<br>
ingress of air, the furnace is kept under positive pressure. The reduced material is<br>
discharged to screw conveyers SC-201A and SC-201B (jacketed), where it gets<br>
cooled to 
be filled with ammonia -ammonium carbonate solution of required composition as<br>
described in leaching section start up procedure.<br>
Section 300 and 400<br>
Before feeding of reduced ore to section 300, various reactors and thickeners in<br>
section 300 and 400 were filled with solution containing ammonia and ammonium<br>
carbonate of required composition. The solution was prepared in preparation tanks<br>
SV-401 and SV-502. The solution was prepared in batches of 3 kiloliters by adding<br>
water, ammonium carbonate and liquor ammonia. From these tanks, the solution was<br>
charged to SV-301 and from SV-301 the solution was filled to all the reactors,<br>
thickeners and storage tanks of section 300 and 400.<br>
Section 500<br>
In Section 500 no equipment was required to be loaded with any solution/solids prior<br>
to feeding the nickel containing leach liquor for ammonia stripping and basic nickel<br>
carbonate precipitation. The steam required to accomplish stripping of ammonia was<br>
supplied by an oil-fired boiler.<br>
The process briefly comprises of material preparation and drying, reduction-roasting,<br>
leaching with ammonia-ammonium carbonate in the presence of air or oxygen at<br>
elevated pressure , recovery of nickel as nickel salt after removing ammonia and<br>
ammonium carbonate and obtaining a residue which is suitable for coal washeries or<br>
for iron production.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should not be<br>
construed to limit the scope of the present invention<br>
Examples<br>
The low grade chromite ore having about 0.5 to 0.9 % Ni (dry basis) and moisture<br>
content varying between 15 to 40% was used as the raw material in the ore drying and<br>
grinding section. The various samples collected from the output from this section had<br>
the composition range given in Table 1. These materials were used as feed to the<br>
furnace.<br>

Example 11 Treatment of the leach residue (step 6)<br>
A typical leach residue containing 0.21% Ni, 46% Fe and 21.2% acid insoluble was<br>
taken for wet magnetic separation. Nine tonnes of residue was subjected to low<br>
intensity wet magnetic separation to get magnetite concentrate and reject containing<br>
gangue materials. The analysis of the magnetic material (5.6 tonnes) was iron 56%,<br>
acid insolubles 9% phosphorous 0.016%. This material can be used in coal<br>
beneficiation plant as heavy media separation or for iron making using smelting<br>
technique.<br>
The main advantages of the invention for this process are:<br>
1. Low grade Chromite ore which is a w ^aterial can be utilized to recover<br>
strategic metals like nickel and cobalt.<br>

3. The retention time for completion of nickel dissolution and iron precipitation is<br>
reduced to 0.5 to 2 hours from six hours as practiced in the existing plants when<br>
oxygen is used and to 4.5 hours when compressed air is used by maintaining an<br>
elevated pressure of- 0.2 kg/cm2.<br>
4. Use of oxygen gas during leaching eliminates the need of elaborate ammonia<br>
recovery system and thus minimizes ammonia losses in the plant operation.<br>
5. The iron content of the leach residue can be upgraded by wet magnetic separation.<br>
The upgraded material due to its fineness can be used for heavy media separation<br>
in coal washeries. This material is also suitable for iron production due less<br>
phosphorus content.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
