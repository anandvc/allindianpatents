				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to improved dampers  for automatic control  of air suction through hearths of sinter machines.<br>
The invention relates more particularly to dampers, hinged at one end thereof and self-balanced with counter weights,   for reducing operating load on the actuators provided to  adjust the openings thereof automatically at optimum levels for minimising the  fuel gas consumption in the hearths.<br>
A conventional  diamper is  of a butterfly type having two flaps,  one on each side of its central axis lying in a horizontal plane passing  through the  vertical  axis  of the 'wind leg'  for controlling the flow of airthrought the hearths of sinter machines.<br>
The main drawbacks of a conventional damper are  :-<br>
(a)	It is not suitable for efficient controlling of the<br>
air flow through the hearth,  and hence the fuel burning rate,<br>
in accordance with the instantaneous fluctuations in the<br>
processing conditions therein,   such as temperature,  fuel gas<br>
supply etc., because of the manual or electrical control of<br>
the  damper by an operator.<br>
(b)	The controlling action of the  damper on the  rate of<br>
air flow through the  hearth is effective  only upto 20% of the<br>
damper opening,   because the opening inside the wind leg increases<br>
abruptly with rotation of the damper.<br>
(c)	The  relation between air flow rate and damper opening<br>
is  non-linear even in the effective  range  of 0 to 20% opening,<br>
because  the  opening increases at  first rapidly and then slowly.<br>
-    2    -<br><br>
(d) In the event of jamming of wind leg with sinter or sinter mix, the opening of the damper is obstructed, because the damper is located inside the  wind leg.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a damper which is capable of mitigating the said drawbacks of a conventional  damper to  a large extent.<br>
The invented damper is of a single  flap  type.     It is hinged at the  top instead of in the  middle part thereof and is capable  of controlling automatically the air suction through the v/ind box of a sinter machine.<br>
The electrical  analogue    signals produced in a known air-pressure transducer fitted on the  hood of each hearth are converted into the  corresponding digital  signals by means of a known analogue-to-digital  (A/D)   converter in a known way and the  digital signals produced in the  A/D converter are supplied to a suitably programmed computer for analysing the  signals and producing output signals which operate  the  actuators of the damper and adjust automatically the  opening of the  damper to the optimum level and thereby minimise the  consumption of fuel gases in the hearth.<br>
Thus the  invention provides improved dampers for automatic control  of air suction through hearths of sinter machines for minimising  fuel gas consumption in the  hearths, characterised in that the  dampers  comprise a pair of single flaps having one  end  thereof hinged at position,   and the  other end movable up and down at the  wind leg top for  adjusting the openings thereof at positions automatically by means  of the actuators for controlling  the   air suction rate through the  hearths  and wind boxes at a level  required to minimise fuel gas consumption in<br>
-    3    -<br><br>
the  hearths,   the  said actuators being operated by the  output signals of a suitably programmed computer for analysing the digital signals fed thereinto from an A/D converter which,  in turn,   is  fed with electrical enalogue  signals from the  wind pressure  transducers fitted on the hoods of the  hearths.<br>
The invention is described fully and particularly in an unrestrictive manner with reference  to the accompanying drawings in which,<br>
Figure 1  is a schematic layout of a conventional damper;<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic layout of a pair of invented dampers  fitted one  each underneath two hearths of a sinter machine along with the automatic control  system provided for operating the same;<br>
Figure  3 shown the  variation in suction in wind legs with the   degree  of opening of the  conventional and invented dampers.<br>
Referring to  Fig.   1,   a conventional butterfly type damper comprises two integrally connected flaps (5A and 5B) and is rotatable manually or electrically by an operator in a vertical plane on a centrally fitted shaft (1) lying in a horizontal plane inside wind leg (7)   for allowing suction of air through the hearths of a sinter machine.     With downward rotation of flap (5A) and upward rotation of flap (5B),  the  respective openings (5C and 5D), marked by dashed lines,  increase  in dimensions,   and vice versa.<br>
Referring to  Fig.  2,   the  invented dampers comprise each a single  flap    (5A and 5B),  hinged at one end thereof at hinge  (4) centrally at the  bottom part of two hearths  (8 and 9)  and housed in wind boxes  (6A and 6B),   the  other ends of the flaps being<br>
-    4    -<br><br>
movable up and down at the top of the wind leg (7)  to allow the respective  openings thereof at positions  (5C and 5D)   to  decrease or increase  to the  required extent for controlling the  air suction rate through the hearths and wind boxes (6A and 6B) underneath thereof automatically at optimum levels  by means of the  actuators (10A and 10B),  which are of known electrically operated types  of IL palghat make and are  disposed on the sides of wind leg  (7),   being connected to the  flaps  (5A and 5B)  of the damper through link rods  (not shown).<br>
Known wind pressure  transducers  (1A and 1B)  of measuring range + 5 mmwc,   are  fitted one each on the hoods  of the  hearths to produce electrical analogue signals corresponding to the wind pressure inside the hearths;  the signals from the  transducers are supplied to the  known analogue-to-digital  (A/D)  converter (2). The  output signals of the A/D converter are connected to suitably programmed computer (3)  for analysing the signals  received from the A/D converter (2)  and producing output signals to operate  the actuators and adjust the openings  (5C and 5D)  automatically to the optimum level  required for minimising the consumption of fuel gases  in the  hearths.     Flaps  (5A and 5B)  are each balanced with aecessary counter weights which are fixed oxe each on two arms (not shown) attached to the sides of the hinge (4) of the flaps (5A and 5B).    The counter weights  (not shown),  each equal to the weight of the  corresponding flaps  (5A and 5B),   are provided for reeducing the  operating load of the  actuators.<br>
Referring to Fig.   3,   the  variation of air suction pressure  inside  the  hearths with the  degree of opening of<br>
—     5     —<br><br>
flaps  (5A and 5B)  at positions (5C and 5D) of the  invented  dampers (shown by line A)  is found to be almost linear upto 60% opening of the     invented      dampers.    The variation of air suction pressure inside the hearths with degree of opening of flaps  (5A and 5B)  of the  conventional  dampers (shown by line B) is non-linear making it difficult to control the air suction pressure inside the hearths at the  correct level by the operator.     The  degree  of opening of flaps  (5A and 5B)  at positions  (5C and 5D)  determines the  rate at which the  combustion products are withdrawn through the sinter mix on bed of hearths (8 and 9).     Thus by controlling the   degree of opening of flaps (5A and 5B)  at positions  (5C and  5D),  the rate of withdrawal as well as the volume  of combustion products withdrawn through the sinter mix on the bed of the hearths (8 and 9 and hence the consumption of fuel gas is controlled.     If the  rate of withdrawal of combustion products is high,  the  heat transferred from the combustion products to the sinter mix is low and hence the consumption of fuel gas is high,  and vice versa.     The optimum level of the  opening of flaps (5A and 5B)  at positions (5C and 5D) is determined, based on the operating conditions such as under-grate suction,   bed height and calorific value of the  fuel gas used.<br>
Since the invented dampers are located at the top of the wind leg instead of being located inside the wind leg  no obstruction is created to the movement thereof by the deposit    of sinter or sinter mix in the wind leg.<br>
Field trials were  conducted by studying  the  fuel gas consumption at  different openings   of the  invented and conventional dampers for a given temperature profile of the sinter bed.<br>
-    6    -<br><br>
It has  been noted that  the  fuel gas   consumption is  reduced by about 45% by using   the invented dampers.<br>
Thus the invented dampers have the following main advantages over the  conventional dampers  :-<br>
1.	The  operation o:f the invented dampers is automatically<br>
and instantaneously performed while that of the  conventional<br>
dampers is slow and dependent on the  skill and efficiency of<br>
the operating personnel.<br>
2.	The  maintenance  of the  invented campers,   because of<br>
their installation above  the  wind leg,   is simpler and less<br>
frequently required compared with the  conventional  dampers,<br>
because of their installation inside the wind leg.<br>
3.       The  consumption of fuel gas is  appreciably reduced by using the invented dampers instead of the  conventional dampers.<br>
-    6A    -<br><br>
