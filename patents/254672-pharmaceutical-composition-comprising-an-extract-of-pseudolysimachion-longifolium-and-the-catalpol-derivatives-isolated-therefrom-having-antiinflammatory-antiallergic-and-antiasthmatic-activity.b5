DERIVATIVES	ISOLATED	THEREFROM	HAVING<br>
ANTIINFLAMMATORY, ANTIALLERGIC AND ANTIASTHMATIC ACTIVITY<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a composition comprising an extract of Pseudolysimachion longifolium and the catalpol derivatives isolated therefrom having anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic and anti-asthmatic activity.<br>
Background Art<br>
Asthma has been regarded as a complex syndrome occurring in the airways, which shows various disorders such as airflow obstruction, acute or chronic inflammation, airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) and structural remodeling (Kumar R. K. Pharmacol Ther., 91, pp 93-104, 2001).<br>
Allergic inflammation occurring in the airways has been reported to play a critical role in asthma development and the number of patients suffering from allergic asthma has been increased to about 10% of the population in the world recently. It has been reported that the number has been reached to seventeen million in America and the market scale of the medication for allergic asthma has been enlarged to 640 billion $ in America till now.<br>
Asthma can be classified into two types, i.e., extrinsic asthma and intrinsic asthma. Extrinsic asthma caused by the exposure of antigen such as house dust mite Dermatophagoides as a main antigen, pollen, epithelium of animal, fungi etc shows positive reaction in skin test or bronchial provocation test against the antigen, and generally occurs in younger people. Intrinsic asthma caused by upper respiratory infection, exercise, emotional instability, cold weather, the change of humidity occurs in adult patients.<br>
According to the aspect of pathophysiology, asthma has been recognized as a chronic inflammation occurred by following procedure; Inflammatory cells are proliferated, differentiated, and activated caused by cytokines reproducing in T-helper 2 immune cells and is moved to air way or neighboring tissue thereof. The activated inflammatory cells such as neutrophil, mast cell etc release a variety of inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, chemokines, signaling molecules, adhesion molecules and growth factors and the structural cells in airways are involved in various stages of asthma (Elias JA et al., J Clin Invest., Ill, pp 291-7, 2003). In numerous studies using knockout mice models and clinical research, the critical observations in asthma could fall into several characteristic parameters, such as immune responses, eosinophilia, AHR and structural remodeling (Moffatt JD. Pharmacol Ther, 107, pp 343-57, 2005; Spina D et al., Trends Pharmacol Sci, 23, pp 311-5, 2002). Each of the parameters seems not to have direct correlations with one another; however, IgE-mediated immune response and eosinophilia are prominent symptoms in the airways of allergic asthma (Bochner B.S. et al., Annu. Rev. Immunol, 12, pp 295-335, 1994; Bousquet J et al., N. Engl. J. Med, 323, pp 1033-9, 1990), and the produced cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 in the allergic process also play an important role in AHR development and airway remodeling (Riffo-Vasquez Y et al., Pharmacol. Ther., 94, pp 185-211, 2002). Indeed, asthma is a result of orchestrated inflammatory events, many of which involve specific inhibitors acting on the pathway of asthma, for example, histamine HI antagonists, thromboxane antagonists, platelet-activating-factor antagonists, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, nitrogen monooxygenase inhibitors and prostaglandin inhibitors, have been tried but have failed in clinical trials (Moffatt J.D., Pharmacol. Ther., 107, pp 343-57, 2005). In contrast, glucocorticoids, which suppress the progenitor levels of inflammatory cells to baseline by widespread inhibition of cytokine synthesis and cytokine mediated immune-cell survival, has been used to manage the symptoms of asthmatic patients over a period of 30 years as far (Baatjes A.J. et al., Pharmacol, Then, 95, pp 63-72, 2002). These reports suggest that the therapeutic approach for asthma management should focus on restoring the balance of asthmatic parameters rather than searching for potent inhibitors of specific pathways of the asthmatic process.<br>

Experimental Example 1. MTT assay<br>
To investigate the cytotoxic effect of inventive extract of P. longifolmm extract and the compound isolated therefrom was determined by (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide(MTT) assay method(Wang Z et al., Biol., Pharm. Bull., 24, pp 159-162, 2001).<br>
Promyelotic HL-60 cells (HL-18103, 5X105 cells/ml) were seeded in 96-well plates under NGF-free condition. After 24 hours incubation, the cells were treated with the mixture of samples dissolved in lOpl of DMSO and lOpl of MTT solution (5mg/ml), and incubated for 4 hours under similar condition. 4 hours later, MTT was removed and lOOul of DMSO was dropped into each well to dissolve crystals. At 570nm, UV absorbance was measured by microplate reader (BIO-RAD, U.S.A.) to calculate the cell viability.<br>
As shown in Table 1, the result demonstrates that the cell viability ranges from 98% to 116% in 50uM, from 95% to 114% in lOOuM. It is confirmed that an inventive extract or compound the present invention has no cell toxicity.<br>

3-1. Animal sensitization and airway challenge<br>
Specific pathogen-free female BALB/c mice aged 8-10 weeks, which were routinely screened serologically for relevant respiratory pathogens, were purchased from ORIENT Co Ltd (Seoul, Korea).<br>
Following treatment: (1) sham-sensitization plus challenge with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; ipNeb); (2) sensitization plus challenge with OVA (ovalbumin: Sigma A5503; Sigma, St. Louis, MO)(ipNeb); (3) sensitization with OVA(i.p.) plus challenge with OVA (Neb) and samples (extract of P. longifolium or montelukast) was performed to Group of mice (n=5). Briefly, mice were sensitized by intraperitoneal injection of 20#g OVA, which was emulsified with 2 mg aluminum hydroxide in 100 ul of PBS buffer (pH 7.4) on days 0 and 14. The mice were challenged through the airways with OVA(1% in PBS) for 20 min using an ultrasonic nubuilizer (NE-U12; Omron Corp., Tokyo, Japan) on days 28,29 and 30 after the initial sensitization. The mice were sacrificed 48 h after the last challenge (day 32) to determine the suppression effect of extract of P. longifolium or verproside on the<br>
airways of allergic asthma.<br>
3-2. Sample treatment<br>
The extract of P. longifolium, and verproside were suspended in PBS and administered intragastrically using a 25-gauge stainless steel blunt feeding needle 1 h before each challenge, and control animals were exposed only on the PBS solution. As a positive control, montelukast (MSD Korea Ltd., Seoul, Korea) was treated with the same procedure in the experiment.<br>
The mice were sacrificed with an overdose of pentobarbital (Sigma P3761) 24h after the last challenge, and a tracheotomy was performed. After ice-cold 0.5ml of PBS was instilled into the lungs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained by aspiration three times (total 1.5ml) via tracheal cannulation (Yamazaki T, J. Jap. Bot., 43, pp 117-24, 1968)<br>
3-3. Inflammatory cell counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid<br>
The total inflammatory cell number was assessed by counting cells in at least five squares of a hemocytometer after excluding dead cells confirmed by staining with trypan blue (Daigle I. et al., Swiss Med Wkly, 131, pp 231-7, 2001). lOOyl of BALF was loaded onto a slide and centrifuged (200Xg, 4°C, lOmin) to fix the cells onto the slide using a cytospine machine (Hanil Science Industrial, Korea). The cells were stained by Diff-Quick® Stain reagents (Sysmex, Cat No.38721, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical significance was determined by Student's two-tailed Hest for independent means and the critical level for significance was set at P<q.q5></q.q5>
To evaluate the suppression of verproside on the eosinophilia in OVA-challenged mice, the recruited cells in BALF were counted 48 hours after the last challenge. OVA caused a marked influx of leucocytes into the BALF from a PBS control group. As shown in Figure 2, the total cells were counted as 40.5 ± 16.4 x 104 cells/mouse (P

Experimental Example 4. Lung histology<br>
To estimate the suppressive effect of verproside on the eosinophilia, lung tissues were collected 48 hours after the last challenge. The lung tissue was fixed for 24 h in 10% neutral-buffered formalin. After being embedded in paraffin, it is sliced into 4-um thickness of sections and the tissue was stained with H&amp;E solution (hematoxylin; Sigma MHS-16 and eosin, Sigma HT110-1-32). In the OVA-challenged mice, leukocytes were found to be infiltrated into the peri-bronchiole and peri-vascular connective tissue; of these leukocytes, eosinophilia was mainly observed (Fig. 3-11, P 
In Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining, mucus overproduction in the OVA-treated mice was clearly observed as a violet color in the bronchial airways compared with the normal mice. In contrast, mucus was markedly diminished in the verproside + OVA-challenged mice (Fig. 4-A). Goblet-cell hyperplasia in the airway epithelium was quantified based on a five-point system: 0, no goblet cells; 1, 75% of the epithelium. For each mouse, five airway sections that were randomly distributed throughout the left lung were analysed, and their average scores were calculated. Quantitative analysis of mucus production was performed using an image analyzer (Leica Microsystem Imaging solution Ltd.; Cambridge, UK). As shown in Figure 4-B, the mucus area was scored as 3.60 ± 0.64 in the OVA-treated mice compare with PBS-treated mice (P 
These results demonstrated that verproside reduced eosinophilia and mucus hypersecretion significantly in the airway remodeling process.<br>
Experimental Example S. Measurement of IgE and cytokines<br>
Complementary capture and detection antibody pairs for mouse IgE antibodies were purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA), and the IgE enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed according to the manufacturer's directions. Duplicate samples in plasma were diluted to 1:100. IgE levels in each sample were measured from optical density readings at 450 nm, and IgE concentrations were calculated from a standard curve that was generated using recombinant IgE (5-2,000 ng/ml). The amount of IL-4 and IL-13 contained in BALF was measured with a specific mouse ELISA kit (R&amp;D Systems; Minneapolis, MN). The detection limit of the assays was 250 pg/ml.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5-A &amp; 5-B, The IgE levels were found to be greatly increased in the OVA-treated mice: 85.6 ± 17.3 ug/ml (plasma, P 
31.4	± 14.2 yg/ml (plasma, P 
To determine the effect of verproside on cytokine release in the OVA-induced asthmatic mice, the levels of cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) in BALF were measured using ELISA 48 hours after the last challenge. OVA challenge induced a significant elevation of the cytokines to 14.1 ± 6.1 pg/ml (IL-4) and 178.5 ± 96.4 pg/ml (IL-13) in the BALF compared with the control (IL-4, 0.1 ± 0,5 pg/ml; IL-13, 0.1 ± 1.0 pg/ml). In the verproside-treated group, the cytokines were significantly suppressed;<br>
64.5	± 27.7% decrease in IL-4 (P 
from a OVA-challenged group. Montelukast also showed a significant reduction in<br>

and IL-13 concentrations in the BALF of the asthmatic model as montelukast did<br>
