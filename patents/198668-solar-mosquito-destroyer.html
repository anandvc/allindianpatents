INTRODUCTION<br>
This invention is a mosquito and housefly population control outdoor device called Solar Mosquito Destroyer that works by using sunlight and biogas.<br>
Mosquitoes and houseflies as vectors constitute a serious threat to human health. Mosquitoes are well known for their biting nuisance. They suck blood from humans and from domestic animals. They transmit diseases like malaria, filariasis, encephalitis, dengue fever, yellow fever etc. They give us sleepless nights especially in our big cities. Mosquito transmitted diseases cause hundreds of thousands of deaths every year. These pests have been largely responsible for holding up economic development in the tropical areas of the world. In spite of all the control measures mosquito population is increasing rapidly. Houseflies transmit diseases such as polio, trachoma, hepatitis, fever and different types of bacterial diseases such as bacillary, dysentery, cholera, typhoid, paratyphoid etc. They can carry the germs eggs and cysts of helminthes worms.<br>
DRAWBACKS OF THE EXISTING CONTROL MEASURES<br>
lathe Mosquito mat:<br>
It does not destroy the mosquitoes but only repels them. Moreover, inhaling of smoke  from  mats  cause  health  problems  such  as  headache,  vomiting,  giddiness, bronchitis etc for many .It may cause lung cancer and asthma. In addition we need electricity to light it. 2.Lemon Oil Repellents<br>
Like the mats they only repel mosquitoes but do not destroy them.  Their application is irritating to us. It may result in itching, development of small skin lesions, dermatitis etc. 3.Flourascent Lights Fitted Electrocutes<br>
These have been proved ineffective in controlling mosquito population. 4.Pesticides and Larvicideâ€™s<br>
They are used widely to control mosquito population. But these Chemicals have been proved harmful to man and the ecosystem. These pests and their larvae become resistant to these chemicals by their repeated application. 5.Fumes and Fumigants<br>
They will affect the eco system adversely. 6.MosquitoNets<br>
Nets are applicable only while sleeping or taking rest. Mosquitoes enter even through the nets and bite us. They are not helpful for the destruction of mosquitoes.<br>
From the above stated facts we can see that the existing methods and devices for controlling mosquito population have serious limitations and drawbacks. These circumstances bear out the importance of this newly invented device called Solar Mosquito Destroyer.<br>
The object of the invention is to make a device without any of the above said defects of the existing methods for mosquito and housefly population control. It is also<br><br>
the object of the invention to have a device that is very simple in construction, easy for operation and available at an affordable price.<br>
This invention called Solar Mosquito Destroyer (SMD) attracts mosquitoes into it by using biogas from a drainage tank or septic tank and gets them trapped in its upper part where they perish in the heat of the sun. It consists of a box with a hole each on three sides, a transparent conical tube, and a transparent roof structure inside which the trapped mosquitoes perish.<br>
This invention is more clearly described with reference to the figure I. A Solar Mosquito Destroyer consists of a rectangular box with a lid and called system box (3), a transparent conical tube (11) screwed on to the top of the lid of the box, and a transparent roof structure called solar furnace (12) mounted on the top of the conical tube. The rectangular box, which is made of polymer material, is 20cm long, 13cm wide and 10cm high. The thickness of the wall of the box is 3mm. At 2.5cm below the right hand top comer of the farther end of the box there is a hole having 2.5cm diameter. Through it an inlet tube called gas inlet tube (4) having 2cm inner diameter and made of p.v.c, is inserted airtight using male and female adaptors having 2.5 cm inner diameter and necessary washers such that it juts some 8cm into the box. The last 6cm of the inlet tube has fine perforations on it to let out gas and its end is covered with fine mesh (5) so that the mosquitoes, which are attracted into the box by the biogas, cannot enter the inlet tube. The inlet tube is provided with a p, v. c full way valve called control valve (8), having2.5 cm inner diameter, outside so that the flow of the biogas from a source tank (6) into the device trough a connecting tube (7) can be regulated. The mosquitoes enter the box through a tube having 2.5 cm diameter and called gas exhaust tube (2) fixed at the center of the lowest part of the front end of the box; the gas exhaust tube jets some 10cm into the box along its bottom. The mosquitoes are made to enter the box through the tube rather than through a simple hole so as to prevent the mosquitoes from escaping from the box attracted by the sunlight. So as to prevent the gas escaping through the gas exhaust tube from getting diffused all of a sudden, at the front of the box, covering the mouth of the gas exhaust tube is a dish like structure called gas exhaust wing (1) as can be seen in the drawing. The dish like structure is 10cm long, 13cm wide and 5cm high. It helps the mosquitoes to find out the way into the box, the gas exhaust tube, easily by providing a grater concentration of biogas in it. It also reduces the chance of mosquitoes escaping from the system box once they entered the box by reducing the current of the gas through the gas exhaust tube and by reducing the amount of sunlight that enters the gas exhaust tube.<br>
The top of the system box is with a detachable lid (17), which is fastened to the box airtight using screws, one on each side. There is a transparent trapezoid patch called transparent plate (9) on the top of the lid, beginning L5cm from the front of the box lid and extending well past the middle. The transparent patch is 12.5cm long, 6cm wide at the front end and 2.5cm wide at narrow end. The transparent patch is also of polymer material and has the same thickness of the box. There is a round hole having a diameter of 2.5 cm and called trap hole (10) on the box lid contiguous to the narrow end of the transparent patch. A transparent conical tube made of polymer material, which is 30cm high and having 2mm wall thickness, the base and the top of which are 10.5 cm and 2.5cm in diameter respectively is screwed air tight and vertically on to the box lid just<br><br>
above the trap hole so as to cover it. For this purpose the out side of the base of the conical tube is provided with male screw threads and it can be screwed air tight into a circular rib (15) whose inner diameter is the same as that of the outer diameter of the base of the conical tube and which is mounted around the trap hole on the box lid in such a way that its side is equidistant from the center of the trap hole. The circular rib is 2cm high and it has female screw threads inside. The rib is excluded from the area where it crosses the transparent patch. A trans parent roof structure called solar furnace (12), made of polymer material, rests tight on the upper end of this conical tube. The top of the conical tube juts some 12cm into the solar female through a circular hole, which is 5.5cm in diameter, in between its arms. The circular hole of the solar female has 2cm deep conical rib (16) around it, projecting downwards, so as to keep solar female in position on top of the conical tube. The transparent and hollow solar female, having 2mm wall thickness, is actually a dome like structure with two arms called reservoirs (13) and (14) attached on either side. Looked at from the front the solar female looks like an inverted *U'. It is 30cm high 25cm wide; the arm-to-arm distance Islam. Arm circumference is 24cm. Both the reservoirs are detachable from the roof structure. The upper part of the solar female has a circumference of 60cm. The solar female as a whole is detachable from the top of the conical tube whenever necessary.<br>
CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Wastewater from kitchens, bathing rooms, cowsheds etc that is collected in drainage tanks produce biogas, if water stagnates in them, through anaerobic degradation of organic materials. The same happens in septic tanks attached to toilets too. This gas spreads into the atmosphere through the vent pipes and the small holes formed between the slabs that are used to cover these tanks .In summer and other dry seasons when natural water resources for the growth of their larvae get dry, mosquitoes are attracted to human abodes. This is because human localities have comparatively higher humidity and coolness, which is a factor, liked by them. It is by using their chemosensory mechanism they do this. Mosquitoes thus coming to human abodes find the septic tanks and drainage tanks conducive to the growth of their larvae. They in large numbers get into these tanks through the vent pipes and the small gaps that are formed between the slabs that are used to cover these tanks, lay their eggs and helps reproduction. Mosquitoes find these tanks by sensing the biogas coming out. They have a remarkable ability to do this. A very small amount of biogas, which we humans cannot feel, can be smelt by them from a long distance and come to these tanks and enter in it. Different kinds of mosquitoes and houseflies have this tendency. They include mosquitoes such as Armigerus-sabethes, Clues, Ads etc belonging to Cuisine family and house flies such as Fannie, Siphon a irritants, Tomboys calcitrans etc belonging to the Miscode super family. The Armigerous-sabethes mosquitoes, which belong to the Curlicue family and widely found in Koala are the ones which are more commonly found to regenerate in this manner.<br>
Drainage tanks and safety tanks are now common in villages, towns, suburban areas and wherever humans abide and work. Besides this, there are thousands of biogas plants in<br><br>
our country. In almost all cases, there is stagnant water in the outlet tanks of these biogas plants and there also mosquitoes grow in large numbers. This is because in the outlet tanks also biogas is produced in a small amount and mosquitoes enter these tanks through the small gaps between the slabs that are provided for covering these tanks, sensing the biogas spreading into the atmosphere and lay eggs and multiply.<br>
If water stagnates in drainage tanks at all times, there is no need to make any modification to these tanks for the working of this device. Otherwise, some modifications are to be effected and it can be done at a low coast. The modification of the tank is described below with reference to figure II<br>
See figure II, which shows the cross section of the modified tank. The bottom of the pit (3) is concreted. In dry and honey comb masonry types, sidewall (2) should be plastered with cement mortar after filling all the holes and breaches. From this plastered sidewall, an outlet (5) should be arranged. It should be at myth the height of the tank. This outlet is connected to a small socket pit made in dry or honeycomb masonry. Other parts of the figure II are given below. 1.Inlet from wastewater source. 2.Masonry plastered inside. 3.Concreted bottom. 4.RCC cover slab. 5.Outlet for clear water. 6.Biogas outlet. 7.Sediments. 8.Clear Water. 9.Biogas.<br>
10. Solar mosquito destroyer. 11.Honeycomb or dry masonry. 12.RCC cover slab. n.SockPit. 14,Drainage Trap.<br>
Working of the modified drainage tank<br>
The modified tank is filled with wastewater through the inlet. The solid waste gets settled at the bottom. The clear water, which comes out through the outlet, when the tank gets filled to the level of the outlet, falls into the socket pit and is absorbed into the soil. Solid particles at the bottom produce biogas through anaerobic degradation. This biogas reaches S.M.D {Solar Mosquito Destroyer} through the biogas outlet of the tank.<br><br>
Now let us consider the toilet septic tanks especially. If these septic tanks are sufficiently away from houses and human abodes, we can fit S.M.D just over the tank. Since the amount of water in septic tanks is very high compared to the solid sediments the process of anaerobic degradation is very slow compared to the biogas plants using night soil. So even if the septic tanks are so close to hocuses, during dry seasons, when mosquito population is very high, we can fit this device just over the tanks, allowing only a negligible amount of gas flowing through it using the control valve. Since the sense of smell in mosquitoes and houseflies is several times powerful than that of man, this negligible amount is enough to attract a large number of these pests into this device. Usually, gas from septic tanks spread into the atmosphere without any use. However, by using it for the working of this device for the eradication of mosquitoes and houseflies, we can find its best use, which is a great benefit to our country and mankind.<br>
Mosquitoes as insects have very low heat resistant capacity. The day light and heat of the sun is unbearable to them. If some mosquitoes are caught and put into a trans parent bottle and be placed in direct sunlight with the bottle's mouth closed, those mosquitoes will die within half an hour because of dehydration<br>
Now consider the amount of sunlight required for the working of this device. It is during evening and morning that mosquitoes come and get trapped in this device. But they die when the light from the sun directly hit the solar furnace when the sun is hot. So the S.M.D should be fitted in such a manner that light Iâ€™m the sun directly hit the solar furnace at least for 15 to 30 minutes when the sun is hot (at any time from about 1 lam to 4pm). During night, when moon light and artificial light sources are absent, mosquitoes are kept trapped in the transparent solar furnace of the device by their attraction to the very dim light in the sky they see through the transparent wall of the roof structure. So there should be open sky directly above the S. M.D i.e. there should not be shades of trees or houses directly above the S.M.D to get the best results.<br>
Making use of the above said two main features of these pests (low resistance to sunlight and the habit of multiplication in drainage tanks and septic tanks) this newly invented device can be used as an outdoor device for mosquito population control by fixing it just over these tanks (on the slab provided to cover the tank) and allowing the biogas from these tanks escape into the atmosphere only through this device. For this purpose all the gaps and holes between the slabs and masonry of the tank is sealed airtight using cement mortar or any other available sealing material. Then the device is connected to the tank through a hole bored at any convenient point on the slab.<br>
Working of the device with reference to Figure I<br>
Biogas from the tank flows into the system box (3) through the gas inlet tube (4) which is fitted with the control valve outside. When the box fills with biogas, it begins to flow through the gas exhaust tube (2) into the gas exhaust wing (1). During evening and morning, attracted by the smell of the biogas, the mosquitoes enter the system box through the gas exhaust tube (2), They investigate the source of the gas but they cannot<br><br>
enter the gas inlet tube because of the meshed tube end (5). They now become aware of the sunlight seeping in through the transparent plate (9). Attracted by the sunlight they investigate its source and in the process they move up the conical tube (11) through the trap hole (10) and reach the dome like roof structure called solar furnace (12). In the transparent solar furnace the mosquitoes go on investigating its transparent wall attracted by the sunlight seeping in, till they become weary. They never become aware of the way they came into the solar furnace and escape because of their sensitiveness to the light seeping through the transparent materials in their way. When the sun becomes hot they die out in the solar furnace because of dehydration and the two arms of the structure called reservoirs serve as containers for the dead mosquitoes. The solar furnace can be taken out whenever necessary and the reservoirs can be drained by detaching them from the solar furnace.<br>
Since the circumference of the upper part of the solar furnace is much grater than that part of the transparent conical tube that juts into the solar furnace, the chance of the accidental re-entry of mosquitoes into transparent conical tube from the solar furnace is the least. In the same way the big difference in the diameters of the base of the conical transparent tube and the trap hole prevents the accidental re-entry of mosquitoes from the conical tube to the box through the trap hole. The flow or current of the biogas through the transparent conical tube and the solar furnace is the least compared to that of the box and outlet pipe. This is another factor that reduces the chance of their escape, since the only factor that may help them to escape is the airflow through the bottom of the device. Even at night they never go back and escape because of the presence of moonlight and artificial light sources. Even in too much darkness, the sky appears white to us though not very clear. But this light in the sky is enough to keep the mosquitoes trapped in the solar furnace when there is rain or no moonlight. Houseflies also are get trapped and killed in the same manner.<br>
THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS DEVICE<br>
1) First of all, it is an eco-friendly device. No chemical or pesticide is used in this device to destroy mosquitoes or houseflies. It works by using biogas and direct sunlight.<br>
2) It destroys a large number of adult mosquitoes that have up to 300 eggs in their ovary. This process happens daily during favorable seasons. An adult mosquito can lay up to 300 eggs after one blood meal and, in its life span each mosquito can lay more than a thousand eggs. So destroying such adult mosquitoes is an effective way of controlling mosquito population. It has been noted that during favorable seasons a good number of mosquitoes and houseflies come and die in this device daily. Each day a particular number come and die. This shows that the gap formed by the loss of a particular number in a day in that locality is filled in the next day by the mosquitoes and houseflies coming<br><br>
from the nearby surroundings. This gap filling takes place everyday causing the destruction of a good number each day. This gap filling is an ecological process.<br>
3) Most of the existing devices are indoor devices. This one is an outdoor device thus preventing the entry of mosquitoes into the indoor. It is fitted at the back and lone comers of the yards of houses where drainage facilities are usually made. We can make tanks wherever we like so that it won't make any obstruction to us.<br>
4) Once it is made functional it no longer needs regular attention. It works by itself because the biogas sources we use for the working of this device are endless sources and sunlight that kills the mosquitoes is an everlasting source of energy.<br>
5)	In most cases mosquitoes that are killed in this device are removed biologically. Ants are the biological agents. Removal of the dead mosquitoes by ants is also a regular process.<br>
6)	Several kinds of houseflies that transmit various diseases are also destroyed in this device in large numbers.<br>
7)	This device is applicable in villages, sub-urban areas and towns and at any place where the above-mentioned type of biogas sources is present. It can be used worldwide.<br>
8)	Its technique is very simple.<br>
9)	Its manufacturing coast is low.<br>
10)	Using this device, we can easily catch mosquitoes alive for experimental purposes<br>
because they are kept alive in this device for a long time till the sun becomes hot.<br>
11) If we use this device widely, we can certainly keep the mosquito population under control in the easiest and safest way.<br>
12) A large amount of money that we spent for mosquito control devices can be saved.<br>
13) The S.M.D can be fitted in place of the cowl at the top of the vent pipes of all septic tanks. Usually we cover the cowl of the vent pipes with nets to prevent the entry of mosquitoes into it. The mosquitoes coming to the cowl sensing the biogas are only prevented from entering the tank in this case. But when S.M.D is fitted, it not only prevents the entry of mosquitoes into the tank but also traps and kills them.<br><br><br><br><br>
