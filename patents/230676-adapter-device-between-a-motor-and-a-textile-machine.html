Adapter Device between a Motor and a Textile IVIachine<br>
The invention relates to an adapter device, with which a motor, particularly an electric motor, which can be flanged to a textile machine, where a shaft of the motor is connected with a shaft of the textile machine.<br>
In case of a customary, electric motor-driven textile machine, for example, a draw frame, a braking unit is allotted to the electric motor, which acts on the shaft in order to brake it. In the event of an interruption of the regular operation, for instance, if there is a current break-down, the brake de-activates so that with the help of the braking unit, the shaft allotted to it is braked. In the brake unit, a brake lining jointed to the shaft is provided between two brake shoes and the gap dimension between the brake shoes and brake lining must be very precisely set, so that during the braking operation full braking effect is developed on the one hand and on the other after the release of the brake no friction between the brake shoes and the brake linings occurs. An electro¬magnet of the brake unit for the purpose of releasing the brake must in this context be charged consistently with power so that the shaft can rotate itself. Through the arrangement of the brake unit on the electro-motor, the warmth generated through electro-magnets is diverted to the electro-motor. For the purpose of servicing the brake unit or the electro-motor, both must be respectively replaced or dismantled. A replacement of the brake unit or the electro-motor requires also the replacements of the other parts, because both the units are dovetailed to each other.<br><br>
It is therefore the task of this invention to conceive the design of a braking unit and/or a textile machine with such an arrangement, which would simplify the servicing or mounting of a brake unit and/or a motor.<br>
This task is resolved with the characteristics of the claims listed under 1-14.<br>
In accordance with the Claim 1, for the purpose of braking a textile machine, an adapter device with a braking unit is introduced between a rotatable element of the textile machine and a shaft of a motor. The rotatable element of the textile machine is ideally a shaft, a toothed wheel, a drive wheel or such other similar items. The adapter device has a motor-side flange for the purpose of flanging on to the motor and a machine side flange for the purpose of flanging to a textile machine. Thus the adapter device has both a matching function between the motor and the textile machine as well as a braking function through the brake unit. For the purpose of maintenance or for the purpose of replacement of the motor, this is simply detached from the adapter device and for instance replaced as individual components in a cost-effective manner. For the purpose of maintaining the brake unit, it is possible to take this out between the motor and the textile machine and carry out the maintenance or the replacement job. The complete brake unit with the motor need not be replaced and an adjustment of the brake unit after the mounting of the motor is not necessary. The brake unit for instance can be newly set/adjusted without affecting the motor.<br>
If through the motor coupled to the adapter device only the RPM of the textile machine is regulated as for instance through a planet gear system for a draw frame, similarly through blocking the adapter shaft with the use of the brake unit, the textile machine can be operated in an unregulated manner, during the current but unregulated operation of the textile machine, the motor can be replaced or maintained.<br><br>
If the motor flange and/or the machine flange of the adapter device is replaceable then through a modification of the textile machine or by using a different motor type through change of the corresponding adapter flange a simple matching can be undertaken without it being compulsorily required that the other components of the adapter device are changed. If for instance, a motor has to be replaced through another motor with modified connection parameters, then through replacement of the motor-side adapter flange with the connection parameters matched for the other motor, the matching can be carried out in a simple and cost-effective manner.<br>
If the adapter flanges are jointed through a frame, then an open fabrication is available enabling the maintenance works and/or adjustment works to be carried out under inbuilt adapter device. Simultaneously the heat reflection through radiation and convection is facilitated.<br>
Under a very specially advantageous design the adapter shaft has a brake shaft and a rigid compensatory coupling. Through the compensatory coupling an axially faulty adjustment or mismatch between the motor shaft and a shaft of the textile machine is compensated so that between the axes no deformation forces occur. In this context, the adapter shaft can be designed as a single part with a brake shaft section and a compensatory coupling section, or as a two-piece device consisting of a separate brake shaft and a separate compensatory coupling, which are jointed to each other.<br>
Through the positive locking joint of a brake lining of the brake unit with the brake shaft, the braking force is transferred in the direction of rotation while through the axial sliding capability of the brake lining a play of the brake lining between the brake discs and/or brake plates need not be set/adjusted on both sides of the brake lining.  Instead of the brake lining also a brake disc can be<br><br>
mounted correspondingly to the brake shaft, where the plates or discs with the brake lining act upon sideways on the brake disc so mounted.<br>
If the compensatory coupling between the brake shaft and/or brake unit, and the motor is provided, then on the one hand the heat transferred from the brake to the motor is minimized. On the other, during the braking operation the compensatory coupling is not stressed through the flywheel mass of the textile machine, so that the compensating coupling, need only take on the torque generated by the electric motor. By means of a compensatory coupling on which several axially distanced slits are provided perpendicular to the shaft axis, a compact and cost-effective compensatory coupling is planned. Ideally one or more of the slits in the circumferential direction are provided with an offset angle or angular offset to each other.<br>
For the reason that-the adapter shaft at the machine side end has a groove, the rotation movement can be coupled using the adapter device to a toothed wheel of the textile machine. The coupling between the adapter shaft of the adapter device and the motor can then be done optionally, for instance, with a compensatory coupling or a clamping ring. Thus on the electric motor itself no driving pinion need be provided, which needs to be ejected out from the motor shaft and finally again pressed on during the maintenance of the electric motor. Thereby the use of a standard motor from a large series is simplified, because the electric motor need not be equipped with a matching pinion in respect of the textile machine.<br>
On the basis of the drawings, the design examples are explained hereunder.<br>
Figure 1 A first design form of an adapter device for clamping on a shaft of the textile machine<br><br>
Figure 2 A second design form of an adapter device with a pinion for driving the textile machine<br>
Figure 1 shows as a first design form an adapter device 1 in dismantled illustration with a brake module 2 and an electric motor 3 which can be flanged to the adapter device 1. The adapter device 1 has a machine-side adapter flange 10 and a motor-side flange 11, which are jointed to each other by means of stud bolts 12. The machine side adapter flange 10 is screw-fitted with bolt 13 on the stud bolt 12, and the motor-side adapter flange 11 on the opposite side of the stud bolt 12 using a bolt 14. Through the bolt holes in the machine-side adapter flange 10, the adapter flange 10 is fastened on the machine flange of an unillustrated textile machine, for instance, a draw frame or a carding machine. The adapter flange 10 is replaceable and therefore can be matched to different flange dimensions of various types of machines. The motor-side adapter flange 11 is connected with a motor flange 4 of the electric motor 3 through bolts 6. The motor side adapter flange 11 is similarly replaceable so that different electric motor types can be applied simply through exchange of the adapter flange.<br>
Between the adapter flanges 10, 11, the brake module 2 is held. The brake module has a brake module shaft 20, on which a carrier 21 is screw-fitted in a torsion-free manner by means of a headless screw. On the outer circumference of the carrier 21, a cam and/or crown gear is provided. It is possible to slide through this crown gear a brake lining 22, which has at the inner circumference an inner crown gear complementary to the crown gear of the carrier 21. Between the crown gear of the carrier 21 and the inner crown gear of the brake lining 22, there is so much play that the brake lining can be moved in axial direction on the carrier 21, while there is a torsion-free or rigid coupling between the brake lining 22 and carrier 21 for the purpose of braking. Through the coupling of the carrier 21 to the brake module shaft 20, a braking force, which acts on the brake lining 22, is transferred through the carrier 21 on to the braking module shaft 20.<br><br>
With the help of bolt 26, an electro-magnet 24 of brake module 2 is fastened to the machine-side adapter flange 10. Using distance bolts 25, distance between the machine-side adapter flange 10 and the electro-magnet 24 is set. The bolts 26 is inserted through a bore in the distance bolts 25. the distance bolts 25 can be rigidly jointed with the electro-magnet 24, or through a screw joint, so that through the tightening of the distance bolts on the electro-magnets an adjustment of the distance between the machine side adapter flange 10 and electro magnets is enabled.<br>
The distance bolts 25 simultaneously serve as guide for a diaphragm 23 which is pressed away from the electro magnets by means of springs between the diaphragm 23 and the electro-magnets 24. If the electro-magnet 24 is excited through current/power, then the diaphragm 23 is pulled towards the electro¬magnets. Between the diaphragm 23 and the inner surface of the machine-side adapter flange 10, the brake lining 22 is arranged. Under excited electro-magnet 24, that is when the diaphragm is drawn to the electro-magnets, there is a play between the diaphragm 23 and adapter flange 10 for the brake lining 22, so that it can freely rotate in this gap. On the contrary, if the electro-magnets 24 is not excited and the diaphragm 23 is pushed out from the electro-magnets in the direction of the adapter flange 10, then on the side face surfaces of the brake lining 22, a braking force become active which is finally transferred to the brake module shaft 20. After the fastening of the electro magnets 24 on the adapter flange 10, through the gap in which the brake lining 22 is provided, a protection ring 24 is inserted so that impurities do not land in the braking gap and/or impurities are not emitted from out of the brake lining 22.<br>
The braking module shaft 20 is designed on the side of the electro motor 3 in the form of a sleeve and is split such that the brake module shaft 20 can accept on the side of the electro motor 3 a motor shaft 5 of the electro motor. After the brake module shaft 20 is pushed over the motor shaft 5, and/or the motor shaft 5 is<br><br>
pushed into the brake module shaft 20, the brake module shaft 20 is firmly fastened to the motor shaft 5 with the help of a clamping ring 30. Through the other end of the brake module shaft 20, a clamping ring 32 of a torsion-free compensatory coupling 31 is inserted and through clamping rigidly jointed. The rigid compensatory coupling 31 is provided in order to compensate an axial offset between a rotation shaft of the textile machine and the brake module shaft 20 or of the electro motor 3. A rigid coupling between one of the shafts of the textile machine and the compensatory coupling 31 is done similarly through a clamping ring 33.<br>
For passage of the brake module shaft 20 in the adapter flanges 10 and 11 as well as in the diaphragm 23 and the electro magnets 24, the openings have a play in the radial direction so that an axial offset of the motor shaft 5 as against the symmetric axis of flange 10, 11 can be compensated through radial sliding of the brake module shaft 20 within the adapter device 1. In an assembled adapter device 1, the brake module shaft 20 and/or the compensatory coupling 31 can be detached without having to access the adapter device.<br>
For the reason that the brake module 2 is exclusively jointed to the machine side adapter flange 10 directly, during braking of the fly wheel mass of the machine, the torque is transferred only on the machine side adapter flange 10. The motor side adapter flange 11 in this process is completely free of load so that no torsional force is transferred on the electro motor 3. Under a warming of the electro magnets 24, during its excitement the heat is transferred through the distance bolts 25, the screws 26 and the protective ring 27 only to the machine side and flange 10. The height of the stud bolts is advantageously so chosen that a distance or air gap is prevalent between the rear side of the electro magnets 24 and the motor side adapter flange 11. Thereby there occurs no direct heat transfer between the electro magnet 24 and adapter flange 11 or electro motor 3; thus no mentionable heat transfer happens from electro motor 24 on to the electro motor 3.<br><br>
The electro motor 3 can be replaced without modifying the brake split dimensions of the brake module. Similarly the adapter device 1 can be replaced whereby the split/gap dimensions pre-set at the factory for the brake module need not be newly set during the assembly and disassembly. The rigid compensatory coupling can be omitted or arranged between the brake module shaft 20 and the motor shaft 5. In this process, a rigid coupling takes place between the machine shaft and the brake module shaft 20. The adapter device 1 can also be additionally equipped for systems in which hitherto no braking was visualized.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a second design form of an adapter device 1'. Under this design form partly the identical or similar elements are applied as in the case of the first design form of the adapter device 1, with the result that these parts are identified with the same reference numbers. The differences to the first design form are explained here-below. In the adapter device 1', a brake module shaft 40 is provided on the machine side with a pinion 41. The pinion 41 meshes with toothed wheel of a textile machine (not illustrated) in order to drive this by means of the electro motor 3 or to regulate the RPM of the textile machine. The brake module shaft 40 is mounted in two bearings 42, 43, where the bearing 42, 43 are fixed in turn in a bearing bush 44 of a machine side adapter flange 10'. Thus in this case the machine side adapter flange 10' serves as the bearing flange for the brake module shaft 40.<br>
The brake module 2' is modified as against the brake module 2 of the first design form thereby, that a brake plate 28 is arranged, distanced from the machine side adapter flange 10'. The brake plate acts on the brake lining 22 positioned opposite to the diaphragm 23. Through the brake plate 28, the distance/gap caused by the bearings 42, 43 and the bearing bush 44 between the adapter flange 10' and brake module 2' is compensated. The rigid carrier 21 jointed with the brake module 40 is distanced through a distance ring 45 from the bearings 42, 43.  Simultaneously the distance ring 45 serves as the cover of the bearings 42,<br><br>
43 against impurities through operation of the brake; vice-versa it protects the brake lining 22 against lubricants from the bearings 42, 43.<br>
For the adapter device 1', the rigid compensatory coupling 31 is provided between the motor shaft 5 and the motor-side end of the brake module shaft 40. The clamping ring 32 is clamped on this for the purpose of connecting with the motor shaft 5, and the clamping ring 33 is fastened to its motor side end for the purpose of connecting with the brake module shaft 40. During braking of the textile machine using the brake module 2', the torque of the textile machine resulting through the braking operating does not act on the compensatory coupling 31 with result that this needs to be only so dimensioned that it can accept the maximum torque produced through the electro motor 3.<br>
For the second design form, it is necessary that for replacement or repair of the electro motor 3, the pinion 41 is removed from the motor shaft 5 or is installed on the motor shaft, for instance, through press fitting. By use of an adapter device 1 or 1', where electro motor 3 finds application, for the purpose of RPM regulation of the textile machine, it is not necessary to plan or provide, in the event of a brake-down of the electro motor 3, additional measures or components for blocking the axis driven through the electro motor 3. Through deactivation of the brake module 2 or 2" (or activation for a design form not illustrated) the brake module 20 or 40 is blocked so that an uncontrolled rotation of the shaft is prevented. For instance, a RPM-regulated draw frame in normal operation can continue to be operated through blocking of the shaft 20 or 40 under unregulated mode.<br><br><br><br><br>
