				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
ROTARY HERMETIC COMPRESSOR AND REFRIGERATION CYCLE SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a rotary hermetic compressor that configures a refrigeration cycle of, for example, an air conditioner, and to a refrigeration cycle system configuring a refrigeration cycle by using the rotary hermetic compressor.<br>
Background Art<br>
Generally or commonly used rotary hermetic compressors have a configuration of an intra-casing high pressure type that accommodates in a hermetic casing an electric motor section and a compression mechanism section coupled with an electric motor section, in which a gas compressed in the compression mechanism section is once discharged into the hermetic casing.<br>
In the compression mechanism section, an eccentric roller is accommodated in a cylinder chamber provided in a cylinder, a vane chamber is provided in the cylinder, and the vane is accommodated therein.  A front end edge is compressed and urged by a compression spring to normally extend to the side of the cylinder chamber so as to elastically contact a peripheral surface of the eccentric roller.  The cylinder chamber<br>
is separated by the vane into two chambers along the rotation direction of the eccentric roller, in which a suction section is communicated to one of the chambers, and a discharge section is communicated to the other chamber.  A suction pipe is connected to the suction section, and the discharge section is opened in the hermetic casing.<br>
In recent years, two-cylinder rotary hermetic compressors having two cylinders of the type described above are being standardized.  In a compressor of the type, if a cylinder for normally performing compression operation and a cylinder enabling compression-stopping switching can be provided, the specification is enhanced, and the compressor is thereby made advantageous.<br>
For example, Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 1-247786 (hereinafter, referred to as "Patent Document 1") discloses a technique characterized by including two cylinder chambers and high-pressure introducing means that forcibly causes a vane of either one of the cylinder chambers to be away from a roller and that causes the cylinder chamber to be a highly pressurized to stop the compression operation.<br>
In addition, Japanese Patent No. 2803456 ("Patent Document 2", hereafter) discloses a technique in which a bypass pathway is provided as high-pressure introducing means for introducing high pressure from a<br>
hermetic container into a suction pipe.  In one cylinder chamber, a vane is brought by operation of an elastic material into contact with a roller even during operation with an inoperative cylinder, and a compression chamber is normally separated by the vane.<br>
A compressor disclosed in Patent Document 1 is functionally excellent.  However, for configuring the high-pressure introducing means, a high-pressure introducing opening for communication between one of the cylinders and the hermetic casing is provided; a double-throttling 'mechanism is provided in a refrigeration cycle; and a bypass refrigerant pipe including a solenoid on-off valve is provided, the bypass refrigerant: pipe being branched from a middle portion of the throttling mechanism for communication to one of vane chambers.<br>
More specifically, for example, opening-forming processing is necessary, a throttle device on the refrigeration cycle has to be configured into the double-throttling mechanism, and further, the bypass refrigerant pipe has to be connected between the double-throttling mechanism and the cylinder chamber, so that the configuration is complicated to the extent of providing adverse effects.<br>
In the previous technique disclosed in Patent Document 2, a connection step for the bypass pipe that bypasses a discharge side and a suction side to the<br>
hermetic container is necessary, thereby providing adverse effects in cost.  In addition, the vane is normally brought into elastic contact with the roller even during the operation with an inoperative cylinder, such that the efficiency is reduced because of the presence of, for example, a slight amount of compression operation and a sliding loss.<br>
The present invention is made under these circumstances, and an object thereof is to provide a rotary hermetic compressor in which, in a prerequisite condition in which first and second cylinders are provided, a compression urging structure for a vane of one of the cylinders is omitted to attain improvement in lubricity and reliability, and the number of components and the processing time and costs are reduced to thereby contribute to cost reduction; and a refrigeration cycle system using the rotary hermetic compressor.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will be described herebelow in accordance with the drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 shows an elevational cross-sectional view of a rotary hermetic compressor R and a refrigeration cycle configuration view of a refrigeration cycle including the rotary hermetic compressor R in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
First, the rotary hermetic compressor R will be described.  Numeral 1 denotes a hermetic casing 1.  A compression mechanism section 2, which will be described below, is provided in a lower portion of the hermetic casing 1, and an electric motor section 3 is provided in an upper portion thereof.  The electric<br>
motor section 3 and the compression mechanism section 2 are intercoupled via a rotation shaft 4.  A sump portion 0 for a lubricant oil is formed in the bottom portion of the hermetic casing 1.  As the lubricant oil, polyol ester oil is used (however, mineral oil, alkyl benzene, PAG, or fluoric oil may be usea depending on the type of refrigerant).<br>
The electric motor section 3 uses a brushless DC synchronous motor (which alternatively may be an AC motor or a commercial motor) configured of a stator 5 and a rotor 6.  The stator 5 is fixedly secured to an internal surface of the hermetic casing 1, and rotor 6 is disposed inside the stator 5 with a predetermined spacing inside the stator 5 and receives the rotation shaft 4 inserted.  The electric motor section 3 is connected to an inverter 30 that causes an operation frequency to be variable, and is electrically connected via the inverter 30 to a controller section 40 that controls the inverter 30.<br>
The compression mechanism section 2 includes, in a lower portion of the rotation shaft 4, a first cylinder 8A and a second cylinder 8B that are disposed respectively in upper and lower portions via an inbetween partition plate 7.  The first and second cylinders 8A and 8B are set to have an external geometric shape dimensions different from each other and bore diameters to be identical to one another.<br>
The first cylinder 8A is formed to have an outside dimension slightly larger than the inner peripheral diameter of the hermetic casing 1, is press fitted into the hermetic casing 1 along the bore surface thereof, and positioned and fastened by welding from the outside of the hermetic casing 1.  A primary bearing 9 is superposed on an upper surface portion of the first cylinder 8A and is securely mounted together with a valve cover 100 to the first cylinder 8A by using a mounting bolt 10.  A secondary bearing 11 is superposed on a lower surface portion of the second cylinder 8B and is securely mounted together with a valve cover 101 to the first cylinder 8A by using a mounting bolt 12.<br>
The inbetween partition plate 7 and the secondary bearing 11, respectively, have the outside diameters somewhat larger than the internal diameter of the second cylinder 8B.  In addition, the bore position of the cylinder 8B is shifted from the cylinder center. As such, a portion of the external periphery of the second cylinder 8B extends longer in the radial direction than the outside diameters of the inbetween partition plate 7 and the secondary bearing 11.<br>
On the other hand, the rotation shaft 4 is pivotably supported such that a midway portion and a lower end portion thereof are rotatably journaled by the primary bearing 9 and the secondary bearing 11, respectively.  In addition, the rotation shaft 4<br>
extends through the respective first and second cylinders 8A and 8B, and integrally has two eccentric portions 4a and 4b formed with a phase difference of substantially 180°.  The eccentric portions 4a and 4b have the diameters identical to one another, and respectively are assembled to be positioned along bore portions of the first and second cylinders 8A and 8B. Eccentric rollers 13a and 13b having diameters identical to one another are fitted on peripheral surfaces of the eccentric portions 4a and 4b, respectively.<br>
The first and second cylinders 8A and 8B are partitioned on their upper and lower surfaces by the inbetween partition plate 7, the primary bearing 9, and the secondary bearing 11, thereby forming first and second cylinder chambers 14a and 14b.  The cylinder chambers 14a and 14b are formed have diameters and height dimensions that are identical to one another, in which the respective eccentric rollers 13a and 13b are eccentrically rotatably accommodated.<br>
The respective eccentric rollers 13a and 13b are formed to have the same height dimensions as those of the cylinder chambers 14a and 14b.  As such, while the eccentric rollers 13a and 13b have the 180° phase difference from one another, they are set to a same excluded volume as being eccentrically rotated in the cylinder chambers 14a and 14b.  Vane chambers 22a and<br>
22b for communication to the cylinder chambers 14a and 14b are provided in the cylinders 8A and 8B, respectively.  Vanes 15a and 15b, respectively, are accommodated in the vane chambers 22a and 22b to be extendable or retractable with respect to the cylinder chambers 14a and 14b.<br>
FIG. 2 is an exploded perspective view of the cylinders 8A and 8B.<br>
The vane chamber 22a, 22b, respectively, is formed of a vane accommodation groove 123a, 123b along which two (both) side surfaces of the vane 15a, 15b is slidably movable, and vertical opening portion 124a, 124b in which a rear end portion of the vane 15a, 15b integrally provided to the end portion of the accommodation groove 123a, 123b is accommodated.<br>
A horizontal opening 25 is provided in the first cylinder 8A in the manner of communicating between the external peripheral surface and the vane chamber 22a, and a spring member 26 is accommodated in the opening. The spring member 26 is formed of a compression spring that is interposed between the back surface sice of the vane 15a and the internal peripheral surface of the hermetic casing 1 and that exerts the elastic force (backpressure) to the vane 15a, thereby to bring a front end edge into contact with the eccentric roller 13a.<br>
While accommodating nothing other than the vane<br>
15b, the vane chamber 22b on the side of the second cylinder 8B causes, as described further below, the front end edge of the vane 15b into contact with the eccentric roller 13b in correspondence to a setting environment of the vane chamber 22b and operation of a pressure shift mechanism (means) K described below. The front end edge of the respective vane 15a, 15b is formed semicircular in a plan view, and is linearly contactable with a peripheral wall, which is a circular in a plan view, of the eccentric roller 13a, 13b regardless of the rotation angle of the eccentric roller 13a.<br>
Upon eccentric rotation of the eccentric roller 13a, 13b along the internal peripheral surface of the cylinder chamber 14a, 14b, the vane 15a, 15b is enabled to reciprocatingly operates along the vane acconvmodat ion groove 123a, 123b, and rear end portion of the vane is enabled to extendably or retractably operate with respect to the vertical opening portion 124a, 124b.  As described above, in accordance with the relationship between the external geometric shape of the second cylinder 8B and the external dimensions of the inbetween partition plate 7 and the secondary bearing 11, a portion the external shape of the second cylinder 8B is exposed to the interior of side of the hermetic casing 1.<br>
It is designed such that the portion exposed to<br>
the hermetic casing 1 corresponds to the vane chamber 22b, so that the vane chamber 22b and the rear end portion of the vane 15b directly receive the intra-casirig pressure.  In particular, since the second cylinder 8B and the vane chamber 22b are structures, they are not influenced even when received the intra-casing pressure; however, since the vane 15b is slidably accommodated in the vane chamber 22b, and the rear end portion thereof is positioned in the vertical opening portion 124b of the vane chamber 2-2b, the rear end portion directly receives the intra-casing pressure.<br>
Further, the front end portion of the vane 15b opposes tne second cylinder chamber 14b, so that the front end portion of the vane receives the pressure in the cylinder chamber 14b.  That is, the configuration is formed such that, corresponding to the high/low relationship of pressures received in the front end portion and the rear end portion, the vane 15b moves in the direction from the high pressure position to the low pressure position.<br>
A mounting opening or a threaded screw hole for insertion or screwing of the mounting bolts 11 and 12 in the respective cylinder 8A, 8B, and an arcuate gas-running opening portions 27 are provided only in the first cylinder 8A.  In the vane chamber 22b on the side of the second cylinder 8B, a holder mechanism 45 is<br>
provided that urges or compresses the vane 15b in the direction of detachment of the vane 15b from the eccentric roller 13b.  In this case, a force is used that is less than a differential pressure between a suction pressure that is introduced into the cylinder chamber 14b and a pressure in the hermetic casing 1 that is introduced into the vane chamber 22b.<br>
It is sufficient for the holder mechanism 45 to use any one of a permanent magnet, electromagnet, and elastic member.  In more specific, the holder mechanism 45 urges and holds the vane 15b to be spaced away from the eccentric roller 13b by using a force lower than the differential pressure between the suction pressure exerted the second cylinder chamber 14b and the pressure in the hermetic casing 1 that is exerted on the vane chamber 22b.<br>
A permanent magnet is provided as the holder mechanism 45, thereby to magnetically attract the vane 15b normally at a predetermined force.  Alternatively, in lieu of the permanent magnet, an electromagnet may be provided to perform magnetic attraction by necessity.  Still alternatively, the holder mechanism may be formed of a tension spring or an elastic member. In this case, one end of the draft spring may be retained in a backside end portion of the vane 15b to normally perform tensile-urging with a predetermined elastic force.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 1, a discharge pipe 18 is connected to an upper end portion of the hermetic casing 1.  The discharge pipe 18 is connected to an accumulator 17 through a condenser 19, an expander mechanism 20, and a vaporizer 21, thereby to configure a refrigeration cycle system.  A first and second suction oipes 16a and 16b for the compressor R are connected to a bottom portion of the accumulator 17. The first suction pipe 16a extends through the hermetic casing 1 and communicates to the interior of the first cylinder chamber 14a.  The second suction pipe 16b extends through the hermetic casing 1 and communicates to the interior of the second cylinder chamber 14b.<br>
A branch pipe PI is provided in the following manner.  One end thereof of the pipe is connected in a midway portion of the discharge pipe 18 that intercommunicates between the compressor R and the condenser 19.  The other end of the pipe is connected in a midway portion of the second suction pipe 16b that intercommunicates between the second cylinder chamber 14b of the compression mechanism section 2 and the accumulator 17.  A first on-off valve 28 is provided in a midway portion of the branch pipe PI.  In this case, as shown by a double-dotted chain line in the drawing, no problem takes place even in the state that a one end portion of the branch pipe Pi is extended through the peripheral wall of the hermetic casing 1 to be exposed<br>
to the interior thereof.  What is essential in this case is that the one end of the branch pipe PI is present on the high pressure side of the refrigeration cycle.<br>
A second on-off valve 29 is provided on the side upstream of a branch portion of a branch pipe P on the second suction pipe 16b.  The respective first and second cn-off valves 28, 29 each are a solenoid valve that is on-off controlled responsively to an electric signal incoming from the above described controller section 40.  Thus, pressure shift mechanism K is configured of the second suction pipe 16b, branch pipe PI, first on-off valve 28, and second on-off valve 29 connected to the second cylinder chamber 14b.  In response to a shift operation of the pressure shift mechanism K, the suction pressure or discharge pressure is introduced into the second cylinder chamber 14b provided in the second cylinder 8B.<br>
In the configuration of the accumulator 17, a refrigerant pipe Pa to communicate to the vaporizer 21 is inserted and coupled with an upper end of an accumulator body 17A formed of a hermetic container. In addition, in the accumulator body 17A there are accommodated, in a parallel state, a first suction pipe portion 23a, which constitutes the first suction pipe 16a, and a second suction pipe portion 23b, which constitutes the second suction pipe 16b.<br>
An oil returning opening 24a, 24b, respectively, is provided in a predetermined site of the suction pipe portion 23a, 23b inside the accumulator body 17A. Thereby, lubricant oil to be mixed into the refrigerant vapor-liquid separated in the accumulator body 17A can be directly guided to return from the suction pipe 16a, 16b to the cylinder chamber 14a, 14b.<br>
In particular, in the relative relationship among the oil returning opening 24b provided in the second suction pipe portion 23b, the second on-off valve 29 provided in the second suction pipe 16b, and the connection position of the branch pipe connected to the second suction pipe 16b, the second on-off valve 29 is provided on the side upstream of a connection portion D of the branch pipe PI in the second suction pipe 16b and on the side downstream of the oil returning opening 24b that opens toward the suction pipe portion 23b inside the accumulator 17.<br>
Operation of the refrigeration cycle system including the rotary hermetic compressor R will now be described herebelow.<br>
(1) When normal operation (full capacity operation) has been selected:<br>
The controller section 40 performs control so that the first on-off valve 28, which constitutes the pressure shift mechanism K, is closed, and the second on-off valve 29, which constitutes the same mechanism<br>
K, is opened.  Then the controller section 40 supplies an operation signal to the electric motor section 3 through the inverter 30.  The rotation shaft 4 is rotationally driven, and the eccentric roller 13a, 13b eccentrically rotates in the respective cylinder chamber 14a, 14b.  In the first cylinder 8A, the vane 15a is normally elastically compressed and urged by the spring member 26.  Thereby, the front end edge of the vane 15a slides on the peripheral wall of the eccentric roller 13a, whereby the interior of the first cylinder chamber 14a is bisectionally separated into a suction chamber and a compression chamber.<br>
In a state where an internal-peripheral-surface rotary contact position of the eccentric roller 13a in the eccentric roller 13a matches with the vane accommodation groove 123a, and the vane 15a is retracted farthest, the space volume of the first cylinder chamber 14a is maximized.  Refrigerant gas is drawn from the accumulator 17 through the first suction pipe 16a into the first cylinder chamber 14a to be full therein.  With the eccentrically rotation of the eccentric roller 13a, the rotary contact position of the eccentric roller moves with respect to the internal peripheral surface of first cylinder chamber 14a, whereby the volume of the partitioned compression chamber of the first cylinder chamber 14a is decreased. Thus, the gas previously guided into the first cylinder<br>
chamber 14a is progressively compressed.<br>
The rotation shaft 4 is continually rotated, the volume of the compression chamber of the first cylinder chamber 14a is further decreased, and the gas is further compressed.  When the pressure is increased to a predetermined pressure level, a discharge valve (not shown) is opened.  The high pressure gas is discharged through the valve cover 100 into the hermetic casing 1 to be full therein.  Then the gas is discharged from the discharge pipe 18 provided in the upper-portion of the hermetic casing.<br>
In addition, the first on-off valve 28<br>
constituting the pressure shift mechanism K is closed, no event occurs in which the discharge pressure, (high pressure) is introduced into the second cylinder chamber 14b.  Since the second on-off valve 29 is kept open, the refrigerant evaporates in the vaporizer 21, and low-pressure evaporated refrigerant vapor-liquid separated in the accumulator 17 is guided into the second cylinder chamber 14b through the second suction pipe 16b.<br>
Accordingly, the second cylinder chamber 14b enters a suction pressure (low pressure) phenomenon, and concurrently, the vane chamber 22b is exposed in the hermetic casing 1 to be under the discharge pressure (high pressure).  In the vane 15b, the front end portion thereof is placed under a low pressure<br>
condition, and the rear end portion thereof is placed under a high pressure condition, so that a differential pressure occurs between the front and rear end portions.  Influenced by the differential pressure, the front end portion of the vane 15b is compressed and urged to slidably contact the eccentric roller 13b. More specifically, exactly the same compression operation as in the case where the vane 15a on the side of the first cylinder chamber 14a is compressed and urged by the spring member 26 is performed in the second cylinder chamber 14b.<br>
Thus, in the rotary hermetic compressor R, full capacity operation is performed in which the compression operations are performed with both the first and second cylinder chambers 14a and 14b.  The high pressure gas discharged from the hermetic casing 1 through the discharge pipe 18 is guided into the condenser 19 thereby to be condensed and liquefied, is adiabatically expanded in the expander mechanism 20, and the latent heat of vaporization is removed from heat-exchange air in the vaporizer 21, thereby to effect cooling operation.  The refrigerant after evaporation is guided into the accumulator 17, is vapor-liquid separated, is drawn into the compression mechanism section 2 of the compressor R from the first and second suction pipes 16a, 16b, and is then circulated the channels.<br>
With the holder mechanism 45 provided, the vane 15b is urged in the direction of detachment from the eccentric roller 13b by using a specified magnetic attraction force or tensile elastic force.  However, because the differential pressure between the front and rear end port, ions of the vane 15b is sufficiently greater than the force given by the holder mechanism 45, no event: occurs in which the holder mechanism 45 inversely effects the reciprocation of the vane 15b during rhe full capacity operation.<br>
(2) When special operation (halfed-capacity operation) has been selected:<br>
When a special operation (operation with the half compression capacity), the controller section 40 performs shift setting so that the first on-off valve 28 of the pressure shift mechanism K is opened, and the second on-off valve 29 of the mechanism K is closed. As described above, in the first cylinder chamber 14a, the normal compression operation is performed, the high pressure gas discharged into the hermetic casing 1 to be full therein, thereby reaching the intra-casing high pressure.  Part of the high pressure gas is split for the branch pipe P, and is then directly introduced into the second cylinder chamber 14b through the opened first on-off valve 28 and the second suction pipe 16b.<br>
While the second cylinder chamber 14b enters a discharge-pressure (high pressure) phenomenon, there is<br>
no change in that the vane chamber 22b is under the same phenomenon as the intra-casing high pressure.  As such, the vane 15b is influenced by the high pressure at both the front and rear end portions, so that no differential pressure exists between the front and rear end portions.  The vane 15b does not move, but remains in the stopped state in the position spaced away from the external peripheral surface of the eccentric roller 13b, so that the compression operation is not performed in the second cylinder chamber 14b.  Thus, only the compression operation in the first cylinder chamber 14a is valid, so that the capacity-halved operation is effected.<br>
In the capacity-halved operation, the holder mechanism 45 urges the vane 15b to be held around the top dead center position at which the front end portion thereof retracts from the peripheral wall of the second cylinder chamber 14b.  Thus, the vane 15b is held in the direction of retraction from the eccentric roller 13b.<br>
Also in the capacity-halved operation, there is no change in that the eccentric roller 13b is eccentrically rotated in the second cylinder chamber 14b, whereby no-load operation is performed.  Even when the peripheral wall of the eccentric roller 13b reaches the top dead center position of the vane 15b opposite to the front end of the vane 15b, since the vane 15b is<br>
held by the holder mechanism 45, the front end portion does not contact the eccentric roller 13b.<br>
For example, suppose that the holder mechanism 45 is not provided, and the front end portion of the vane 15b is brought into a complete free state.  In this case, the front end portion of the vane 15b repeats the contact with the eccentric roller 13b and moves like dancing in the vane chamber 22b during the capacity-halved operation.  As such, unless the holder ir.echanism 45 is provided, a drawback arises in that operational noise is generated due to contact of the vane 15b with the eccentric roller 13b and the vane 15b is damaged. However, with the holder mechanism 45 provided, such problems can be precluded.<br>
In addition, since the interior of the second cylinder chamber 14b has the high pressure, there occurs no leakage of the compressed gas from the interior of the hermetic casing 1 to the second cylinder chamber 14b, consequently avoiding loss resulting from the leakage.  Accordingly, the capacity-halved operation can be accomplished without causing a reduction in compression efficiency.<br>
For example, the operation is now compared to the case in which the rotation speed is regulated to the capacity of the halved excluded volume of the compression mechanism section 2.  The results teach that employing the capacity-halved operation enables<br>
low capacity operation and hence improvement of compression efficiency in the state of high rotation speed with the same efficiency as that in the normal operation.  Consequently, the refrigeration cycle system can be provided that is capable of precisely controlling the temperature and humidity in tha manner that the minimum capacity is enlarged by combination with rotation speed regulation.  In the compressor R, capacity variability can be implemented, thereby enabling it to obtain cost advantages, high manufacturability, and high efficiency by forming a simple structure only omitting the spring member that urges the vane ISb.<br>
In the event of necessity of the maximum capacity, a two-cylinder operation is performed to thereby secure a predetermined capacity, whereby a wide range of capacity can be secured with a single compressor.  More specifically, a necessary capacity can easily be obtained by performing on-off control of the first on-off valve 28.  In particular, the oil return to the compressor R in the capacity-halved operation is secured, thereby maintaining the lubricant oil of the compression mechanism section 2.<br>
As an example, a case is assumed in which the second on-off valve 29 is provided on the side upstream of the oil returning opening 24b provided in the second suction pipe portion 23b.  In this case, during the<br>
capacity-halved operation, the high pressure refrigerant flows in the counter-direction into the accumulator 17 through the oil returning opening 24b, thereby causing a significant reduction in the compression capacity in the first cylinder chamber 14a. In addition, unless the oil returning opening 24b being provided, lubricity is reduced during the normal full capacity operation.  As such, setting as described above is indispensable.<br>
In the pressure shift mechanism K, a check valve 29A may be provided in place of the second on-off valve 29 described above.  The check valve 29A permits flow of the refrigerant from the accumulator 17 to the side of the second cylinder chamber 14b, and prevents flow in the counter-direction.<br>
When the full capacity operation is selected, the first on-off valve 28 is closed, and the low pressure gas guided by the second suction pipe 16b is introduced into the second cylinder chamber 14b through the check valve 29A.  The second cylinder chamber 14b reaches the state of the suction pressure (low pressure), and concurrently, the vane chamber 22b reaches the state of the intra-casing high pressure, so that a differential pressure occurs between the front and rear end portions of the vane 15b.  The vane 15b normally receives backpressure to extend to the second cylinder chamber 14b, and is brought into contact with the eccentric<br>
roller 13b, whereby the compression operation is performed.  Of course, the compression operation is performed also in the first cylinder chamber 14a, so that the full capacity operation is effected.<br>
When the capacity-halved operation is selected, the first ori-off valve 28 is opened.  Part of the high pressure gas being introduced from the discharge pipe 18 into the branch pipe PI is guided to the'second suction pipe 16b through the first on-off valve 28. Then, the flow to the accumulator 17 is shut off by the check valve 29A, so that all flows are introduced to the second cylinder chamber 14b.  Thus, while the second cylinder chamber 14b becomes the state of high pressure, the vane chamber 22b stays at low pressure, no differential pressure occurs between the front and rear end portions of the vane 15b.  The position of the vane 15b remains unchanged, so that the compression operation is not effected in the second cylinder chamber 14b.  Consequently, the capacity-halved operation is effected only with the first cylinder chamber 14a.<br>
As one feature, in the configuration having the check valve 29A (or the second on-off valve 29 (this way of expression applies herebelow) provided in the second suction pipe 16b, the check valve 29A is positioned at a predetermined spacing (at least 10 mm or greater) from a welded portion E of the accumulator<br>
17 and the second suction pipe 16b.  More specifically, since a valve element body of the check valve 29A is formed of a thin plate, the valve element is likely to have thermal effects.  However, since the valve is provided in the positioned at the predetermined spacing, the provision avoids as far as possible the thermal effects on the valve in event of welding the accumulator 17 and the second suction pipe 16b.<br>
FIG. '.-n shows a connection structure of a rotary hermetic compressor R and an inbetween partition plate 7 according to a second embodiment.<br>
The accumulator 17 is configured such that the first ana second suction pipes 16a and 16b are integrally extended to a portion directly under the accumulator body 17A from the suction pipe portions 23a and 23b accommodated in the accumulator body 17A.  A check valve 29Aa provided in the second suction pipe 16b is positioned in the portion directly under the accumulator body 17A.<br>
More specifically, in addition to the effects of the configuration shown in FIG. I, the accumulator 17, the suction pipe portions 23a and 23b, and the check valve 29Aa are configured into a substantially integral structure, thereby making it possible to secure high capacity and high reliability.  To avoid thermal effects of the welded portion E of the accumulator 17 and the second suction pipe 16b, the check valve 29Aa<br>
is spaced away at least 10 mm or greater.<br>
In addition, although the mounting position of the accumulator 17 is high, a lower cup Al constituting the accumulator body 17A fixedly mounted to the hermetic casing 1 of the compressor R by using an accumulating band A2, thereby making it possible to implement space saving.<br>
FIG. 4 is a view descriptive of a connection structure of a rotary hermetic compressor R ana an accumulator 17A according to a third embodiment.<br>
Under a prerequisite condition in which a check valve 29Ab is mounted in a portion directly under the accumulator body 17A, the interior of the accumulator body 17A is separated upper and lower portions through an upper-lower separation plate 32, in which the capacity is secured in an upper portion of the upper-lower separation plate 32.  In addition, a communication pipe 34 is provided between a retainer 33 provided in an upper portion and the upper-lower separation plate 32, in which the capacity is secured also in a lower portion of the upper-lower separation plate 32.<br>
In addition to the effects of the configuration shown in FIG. 3, the lengths of first and second suction pipe portions 23al and 23bl can be made identical to the ordinary (conventional) lengths.  This enables preventing performance degradation attributed<br>
to a reduction in supercharge effects.  Further, innate vapor-liquid separation performance can be obtained, and high reliability is secured.<br>
FIG. 5 is a schematic plan view showing a rotary hermetic compressor R and an accumulator 17 according to a fourth embodiment.  In the configuration shown in FTG. 3, 4, although the check valve 29Aa, 29Ab in the second suction pipe 16b is provided in the portion directly under the accumulator 17, it is not limited thereto.  As one feature, the check valve 29Aa, 29Ab is provided between the hermetic casing 1 and the accumulator 17 and within a projected area S shown by hatched lines that is formed with a tangential line between the external peripheral surface of the hermetic casing 1 and the external peripheral surface cf the accumulator 17.  As such, a case can take place in which the accumulator 17 and the check valve 29Aa, 29Ab are parallelly arranged, whereby possible increase in horizontal spacing due to the provision of the check valve can be prevented.<br>
FIG. 6 is a schematic cross sectional view showing a part of a rotary hermetic compressor R and an accumulator 17 according to a fifth embodiment.<br>
The second suction pipe 16b communicating to the second cylinder chamber 14b is bisectionally separated in a midway portion.  A separated suction pipe 16bl on the one side is fixedly secured to the accumulator 17,<br>
and a separated suction pipe 16b2 is fixedly secured to the hermetic casing 1.  More specifically, the separated suction pipe 16bl fixedly secured to the accumulator 17 is formed of a pipe identical to the second suction pipe portion 23b in the accumulator body 17A.  A Lower end portion extending from the accumulator body 17A with the separated suction pipe 16bl is expanded in the diameter and is fitted in an overlapping manner on an upper end portion of the separated suction pipe 16b2 fixedly secured to the hermetic casing 1.<br>
As a work sequence, the accumulator body 17A is turned upside down, and the first suction pipe 16a and the separated suction pipe 16bl (pipe identical to the second suction pipe portion 23b) on the one side are welded together.  In this event, since a check valve 29Ac is not set, no case occurs in which the check valve 29Ac receives thermal effects of welding of the accumulator 17 and the separated suction pipe 16bl in the welded portion E.<br>
Subsequently, the check valve 29Ac is inserted from an open end of the separated suction pipe 16bl. In this event, an check-valve valving portion Ac2 formed of a valve element and valve seat portion shown by hatched lines is first inserted, and a check valve body Acl is positioned on the side of the open end. Then, the separated suction pipe 16b2 on the other side<br>
is inserted on the open end of the separated suction pipe 16bl, and they are welded to one another into an integral unit (site G).  The check valve body Acl has a shape as a pipe, but no problem occurs for welding to the separated suction pipe 16bl.<br>
In :his state, the first suction pipe 16a and the second suction pipe 16b (actually, the separatea suction pipe 16b2) are extending from the accumulator body 1.7A, in which end portions of the suction pipes are welded to the hermetic casing 1.<br>
Thus, the suction pipe 16b communicating to the accumulator 17 is separated, and the check valve body Acl is disposed by being inserted into the separated suction pipe 16bl.  Thereby, space saving can be implemented, the mounting height of the accumulator 17 is lowered, the length of the suction pipe 16b can be reduced, and performance enhancement can be attained. For the position of the check-valve valving portion Ac2 of the check valve 29Ac, a distance can be secured to receive less thermal effects during welding, therefore enabling reliability to be obtained.  The check-valve valving portion Ac2 constituting the check valve 29Ac has a double wall structure, therefore exhibiting operational noise reduction effects.  The oil returning opening 24b and a check-valve positioning notch or taper portion may be provided for the second suction pipe 16b, and a positioning portion h (such as a<br>
protrusion) may be provided in the check valve body Acl.<br>
With the check valve 29A provided in the portion directly under the accumulator 17, since the check valve 29A has to be spaced away at the predetermined distance to avoid the thermal effects of the welded portion E of the accumulator 17 and the second suction pipe 16b, the position of the accumulator 17 is correspondingly high.  On the other hand, in the case that the length of the suction pipe portion 23a, 23b in the accumulator 17 is made identical to the length in the conventional case in order to effectively use the volume of the accumulator 17, the total length of the suction pipe 16a, 16b is increased, so that suction resistance is increased and hence compression performance is reduced.  As such, the height of the accumulator 17 can be somewhat reduced by employing the configuration of FIG. 6, thereby contributing to solving the problems described above.<br>
FIG. 7 is a view descriptive of a connection structure of a rotary hermetic compressor R and an accumulator 17 according to a sixth embodiment.<br>
The configuration is formed such that the second suction pipe 16b communicating to the second cylinder chamber 14b is vertically provided to the side portion of accumulator 17, and a check valve 29Ad is provided in the vertical portion.  Consequently, the accumulator<br>
17 and the check valve 29Ad are parallelly arranged, whereby tne height of the accumulator 17 can be reduced similarly as in the conventional case, so that the arrangement is useful to implement space saving.  The position of the check valve 29Ad is spaced away at a suff icier:' distance from the welded portion E of the accumulator 17 and the second suction pipe 16b, so that thermal effects can be avoided and high reliability can be secure;:.<br>
FIG. 8 is a view descriptive of a connection structure of a rotary hermetic compressor R and an accumulator 17 according to a seventh embodiment.<br>
Similarly as in the sixth embodiment, the accumulator 17 and a check valve 29Af are parallelly arranged.  In this case, however, a second suction pipe portion 23b2 in the accumulator body 17A is horizontally bent at a substantially center portion and is externally extended from the peripheral wall of the accumulator body 17A to form the second suction pipe 16b.  The oil returning opening 24b is provided in an immediately-before site externally extending from the peripheral wall of the accumulator body 17A.<br>
As in the conventional case, because the height of the accumulator 17 can be reduced, the arrangement is useful to implement space saving.  The position of the check valve 29Ae is spaced away at a sufficient distance from the welded portion E of the accumulator<br>
17 and the second suction pipe 16b, so that thermal effects can be avoided and high reliability can be secured.<br>
FIG. 9 is a view descriptive of a connection structure of a rotary hermetic compressor R and an accumulator 17 according to an eighth embodiment.<br>
Similarly as in the seventh embodiment, the accumulator 17 and a check valve 29Ae are parallelly arranged, and a second suction pipe portion 23b3 in the accumulator body 17A is horizontally bent at a substantially center portion and is externally extended from the peripheral wall of the accumulator body 17A to form the second suction pipe 16b.  In the accumulator 17, an upper-lower separation plate 32 is provided in a substantially upper-lower center portion of the accumulator body 17A, and a communication pipe 34 is interposed between the upper-lower separation plate 32 and a retainer 33.<br>
A second suction pipe portion 23b3 has an upper end portion opened in the same position as the retainer 33, and has a lower end portion that is bent between the retainer 33 and the upper-lower separation plate 32 and that externally extends from a peripheral wall of the suction pipe portion 23b3.  The oil returning opening 24b is provided in the bent portion, and an upper end opening of a first suction pipe portion 23al is positioned on the lower side of the upper-lower<br>
separation plate 32.<br>
In this case also, because the height of the accumulator 17 can be reduced, the arrangement is useful to implement space saving.  The position of a check valve 29Af is spaced away at a sufficient distance from the welded portion E of the accumulator 17 and the second suction pipe 16b, so that thermal effects can be avoided and high reliability can ce secured.<br>
FIG. 10 is a view descriptive of a connection structure of a rotary hermetic compressor R and an accumulator 17 according to a ninth embodiment.<br>
There is no change in that the second suction pipe 16b communicating to the second cylinder chamber 14b is integrated with a second suction pipe portion 23b4 in the accumulator body 17A.  However, the second suction pipe portion 23b4 is bent in a substantially U shape with its upper and lower portions and is formed overall in a meander shape.  The oil returning opening 24b is provided in the U-bent portion and is of course positioned on the side upstream of the connection portion D of the branch pipe PI that connects to the second suction pipe 16b.<br>
In the configuration, similarly as in the conventional case, since the accumulator 17 can be provided in a lower position by reducing the height thereof, space saving, can be attained.  A check valve<br>
29Ag is mounted inside the accumulator body 17A, such that operational noise does not leak to the outside from the accumulator 17, consequently enabling noise reduction.  The position of a check valve 29Ag is spaced away at a sufficient distance from the welded portion E of the accumulator 17 and the second suction pipe 16b, so that thermal effects can be avoided and high reliability can be secured.<br>
E'IG. 11 is a view descriptive of a connection structure of a rotary hermetic compressor R and an accumulator 17 according to a 10th embodiment.<br>
There is no change in that the second suction pipe 16b communicating to the second cylinder chamber 14b is integrated with a second suction pipe portion 23b5 in the accumulator body 17A.  However, most portions of the second suction pipe portion 23b5 form a check valve 29Ah, and the check valve 29Ah is substantially accommodated state in the accumulator 17.  However, the oil returning opening is not provided.<br>
Accordingly, the accumulator 17 can be provided in a lower position by reducing the height thereof, and hence space saving, can be attained.  The check valve 29Ah is mounted inside the accumulator body 17A, such that operational noise does not leak to the outside from the accumulator 17, consequently enabling noise reduction.<br>
FIG. 12 is a view descriptive of a connection<br>
structure of a rotary hermetic compressor R and an accumulator 17 according to an llth embodiment.<br>
A first accumulator 170A is connected to the first suction pipe 16a communicating to the first cylinder chamber 14a, and a second accumulator 170B is connected to the second suction pipe 16b communicating to the second cylinder chamber 14b.  Thus, the first and second accumulators 170A and 17B each having an independent configuration are connected to the first and second suction pipes 16a and 16b, respectively.  As a matter of course, in the respective accumulators 170A and 170B, suction pipe portions 23a4 and 23b4 (23b4 is not shown) integral with the respective suction pipes 16a and 16b suction pipes 16a and 16b are provided.<br>
In particular, the other end of the branch pipe PI connected to the high pressure gas of the refrigeration cycle is connected to the refrigerant pipe Pa on the side upstream of the second accumulator 170B.  A check valve 29Ai is provided on an upstream side from the connection portion of the branch pipe PI in the refrigerant pipe Pa.<br>
In such a configuration, the suction pressure or discharge pressure can be guided into the second cylinder chamber 14b through the branch pipe PI and the second accumulator 17B.  In addition, the position of a check valve 29Ai is spaced away at a sufficient distance from the welded portion E of the refrigerant<br>
pipe Pa and the second accumulator 170B, so that manufacturing reliability can be secured.  Before the check valve 29Ai is mounted, delivery inspection can be performed to verify whether least one of compression functions is available, so that high reliability can be secured.<br>
Further, similarly as the cases described above, no problems occur even in the configuration in which the branch pipe PI and the check valve 29Ai are provided in the second suction pipe 16b communication between the second accumulator 170B and the second cylinder chamber 14b.<br>
The respective one of all the above-described rotary hermetic compressors R and accumulators 17 compressor R can be used for the refrigeration cycle shown in FIG. 1 and even for a heat-pump type refrigeration cycle, thereby making it possible to attain capacity enhancement and efficiency enhancement during cooling operation and heating operation.<br>
