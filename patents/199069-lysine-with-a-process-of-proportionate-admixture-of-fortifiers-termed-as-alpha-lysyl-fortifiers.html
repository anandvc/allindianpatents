FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The invention relates to adding ingredients to Lysine at particular quantities and at particular temperatures and in particular process resulting in enhancing the efficiency of Lysine bifold thereby resulting in improving tlie ricliness of protein and the value of tlie feed for animals and broilers. This ultimately results in faster and enhanced growth of tissues in animals and birds. Tlie invention relates enhancing tlie value of Lysine at very low cost.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
All animals need protein in required quantity for tissue growth. Protein is made up of<br>
Aminocids.   There are two types of Aminocids called 'Essentia!' and 'Non Essential',<br>
Essential Aminocids are to be present in the food in sufficient quantity. Of the Essential<br>
Aminocid, LYSINE is an essential aminocid. Lysine gains importance for its rich<br>
protein body tissue building in live stock and pouUiy. The synthesis and degradation of<br>
aminocids often follow the same metabolic patlis witli the human, animal and plant<br>
micro organisms- aUhough the efficacy of these patlis is entirely different from one path<br>
to the other. The animal organisni itself cannot produce about 10 of its amino acids. For<br>
such of those amino acids that can not be produced within, it is dependent on the supply<br>
via the feed. At present, Lysine is imported from abroad at exorbitant price and is added<br>
to the feed for broilers, layers and livestock. If the value and efficiency of the Lysine is<br><br>
enhanced by any process, the quantum of Lysine that needs to be added to the teed can be curtailed di*astically thereby the cost of the feed can be reduced considerably besides improving efficiency of the feed. Hence a process is invented to enhance and add quality, value and protein value to the existing Lysine so that the effiency is enlianced and the cost is reduced.<br>
The enclosed diagrams would describe as to how the invention would enhance the efficiency of Lysine Bi-fold.<br>
Diagram 1 describes the flow cycle of Lysine without Prolin, Copper Sulphate and Pyridoxine (B6). It can be seen that the Lysine wliich is fed into the system gets converted to Succinyl CoA, Fumeric, C&gt;xalacetate, Citrate and goes into urea forming cycle and extricated as urine whereas only a negligible traction of the Lysine takes the anabolic route for tissue building.<br>
Diagram 2 describes the process c\xle of Lysine with Prolin, Copper Sulphate and Pyridoxine (B6) wliich are ingredients of Alfa Lysyl Factor. In this cycle, the Alfa Lysyl Factor added Lysine gets converted to Succinyl CoA, Fumeric and Oxalacetate and at this stage the process takes diversion and converted to Aspartic Acid and thus major portion takes anabolic route for tissue building. Only a fraction of the Lysine gets converted to Citrate and goes into urea forming cycle and extricated as urine<br><br>
Conversion of Lysine as Acetyl CoA to enter citrate cycle is helped by Vitamin C in the presence of Fenous Sulphate to foim iminune system. The addition of Vitamin C and Ferrous Sulphate to Lysine is done through the process of Alfa Lysyl Factor. In the absence of Vitamin C and Ferrous Sulphate, Lysine enters pyiaivate cycle and reduced to glucose.<br>
Diagram 3 is the flow chart describing the process of Lysine without Vitamin - C and Ferrous Sulphate which gets converted to Acetyl CoA, pyruvate and Glucose which make the animal active. But it does not result in tissue building.<br>
Diagriim 4 is the flow chai1 describing the process of Lysine with Vitamin - C and Ferrous Sulphate which is added tlirougli the process of Alfa Lysyl Factor and gets converted to Acetyl CoA and thereafter does the function of Fatty Acid Metabolism and form body immune system. This also results in greater tissue building.<br>
If the Alfa Lysyl Factor is added to Lysine, the quantum of Lysine that needs to be added in the feed can be reduced considerably thereby the cost of the feed would be reduced and the quality of the feed is enhanced.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The benefits and the value tliat is avaiLible in Lysine can be enlianced bifold by supplementing it with certain ingredients cost effectively.<br><br>
The following process is invented to add value to the existing available Lysine,<br>
The process of enhancing the efficiency of Lysine is achieved by blending specially prepai'ed Alpha Lysyl Factor in appropriate propoition.<br>
The Alpha Lvsyl Factor is prepared by the following process.<br>
125 to 250 Gms. of Prolin is chelated with 125 to 250 gins, of Vitanun B6 (PjTidoxin) and freeze dried for 3 houi-s. To this are added 300 to 500 gms. of Copper Sulphate and 500 Ml. of distilled water. When whole mass goes into solution, 250 to 500 gms. of Ferrous Sulphate in 200 ml. distilled water is added in drops throxigh measuring Pipette. The total dissolved mass is added to 250 to 500 gm. of Vitamin C, The mass is allowed to stand for 30 minutes when it is triturated, llie liquid is dried at 70 degree centigrade for one hour. The material is subjected to freeze dr&gt;ing to obtain a powder with less than 10% moisture. This is blended with fine sugar so that the final weight is 50 Kg. This Alpha Lysyl factor in powder form is stored in airtight containers away fi:'om light.<br>
Around 75 Kg. of Alpha Lysyl factor so prepared is then added uniformly to Feed Grade Synthetic Lysine of around 25 Kg so tliat the final weight is 100 Kg of the end product. This End product is tenned as Lysine -f-f f.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
I CLAIM<br>
1. The process for preparation of Bi Fold efficient Lysine by blending Lysine in tlie proportion of 1 : 3 with the specially prepared Alfa Lysyl Factor which is formulated by the process of<br>
a.	chelating 125 to 250 gms. of Prolin with 125 to 250 gms. of Vitamin B6<br>
(Pyridoxin) which is freeze dried for three hours<br>
b.	adding 300 to 500 gms. of Copper Sulphate together with 500 ml of<br>
DistiDed water and when this mass goes into solution, further addition of<br>
250 to 500 gms. of Ferrous Sulphate in 200 ml. of Distilled water byway<br>
of drops through measuring pipette,<br>
c.	adding 250 to 500 mg. of Vitamin C to the total dissolved mass obtained<br>
through the process of (a), and (b) above and allowing it to stand for 30<br>
minutes when it is triturated,<br>
d.	drying at 70 degiees centigrade for one hour and subjecting it to freeze<br>
drying to obtain powder with less than 10% moisture,<br>
e.	blending the final powder thus obtained with fine sugar so that the final<br>
weight is 50 Kilograms.<br>
2.	The process as made in Claim 1 wherein the Feed Grade Synthetic Lysine is<br>
added uniformly to the Alfa Lysil Factor in the proportion of 1 ; 3 in order to enhance the efficiency wliich is cost effective.<br><br></td>
