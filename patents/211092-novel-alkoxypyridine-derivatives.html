The carbon chain in 2-position of the compounds of formula VI is lengthened, for example, by a condensation (with a malonic acid derivative) and a subsequent hydrogenation reaction. Alternatively, the carbon chain can be lengthened using a Wittig reaction followed by a hydrogenation reaction.<br>
In the last step the methyl 3-(4-(1-4C)-alkoxypyridin-2-yl)propionate (compound of formula IV) or the corresponding acid (compound of formula III) are converted with a 2,3-diaminopyridine derivative (compounds of formula II) to give compounds of formula I.<br>

Commercial applicability<br>
The compounds according to the lnvent on have valuable pharmacological properties which make them<br>
commercially utillzable. They are selective inhibitors of the enzyme inducible nitric oxide synthase. Nitric<br>
oxide synthases (NO-syntases, NOSs) are enzymes that generate NO and citrulline from the amino<br>
acid arginine. In certain pathophysiological situations such as arginine depletion or<br>
tetrahydrobiopterin depletion the generation of O" from NO-synthases instead or together with<br>
NO has been reported. NO is long known  as a signalling molecule in most living organisms Including<br>
mammals and humans. The most prominent action of NO is It's smooth muscle relaxing activity, which<br>
is caused on the molecular level by the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase. In the last years a lot of<br>
other enzymes have been shown to be regulated| by NO or reaction products of NO.<br>
There exist three isoforms of NO-syntha which fall into two classes and differ in their physiologic<br>
functions and molecular properties. The firsclass , known as constitutive NO-synthases, comprises of<br>
the endothelial NO-synthase and the neuronal| NO-synthase. Both isoenzymes are expressed<br>
constitutively in various cell types, but are most  prominent in endothelial cells of blood vessel walls<br>
(therefore called endothelial NO-synthas  eNOS or NOS-III) and in neuronal cells (therefore called<br>
neuronal NO-synthase, nNOS or NOS-I), Activation of these two enzymes is dependent on<br>
Ca2+Calmodulin which is generated bytransient increases of the intracellular free Ca2+concentration.<br>
Activation of constitutive isoforms leads to transient bursts of nitric oxide resulting in nanomolar cellular<br>
or tissue NO concentrations. The endothelial isoform is involved in the physiologic regulation of blood<br>
pressure. NO generated by the neuronal jsoform seems to have neurotransmitter function and the<br>
rieuronal isoform is among other regulatory processes involved in memory function (long term<br>
potentiation).	<br>
In contrast to the constitutive isoforms the activation of inducible NO-synthase (iNOS, NOS-II), the sole rrjember of the second class, is performed by transcriptional activation of the iNOS-promoter. Proinflammatory stimuli lead to transcription of the gene for inducible NO-synthase, which is catalytically active without increases in the intracellular Ca2+-concentration. Due to the long half live of the inducible NO-synthase and the unregulated activity of the enzyme, high micromolar concentrations of NO are generated over longer time periods. These high NO-concentratlons alone or In cooperation with other reactive radicals such as 02" aree cytotoxic. Therefore, in situations of microbial infections, iNOS is involved in cell killing by macrophages and other immune cells during early nonspecific immune responses.<br>
There are a number of pathophysiological situations which among others are characterized by the high expression of inducible NO-synthase and concomitant high NO or 02"concentrations. It has been shown that these high NO concentration alone rcombination with other radical species lead to tissue and organ damage and are causa||y involved in these pathophysiologies. As inflammation is characterized by the expression of prointtmmatory  enzymes, including inducible NO-synthase, acute and chronical inflammatory.processes at promising iseases for the therapeutic application of<br><br>
selective inhibitors of inducible NO-synthase. Other pathophysiologies withh high NO-production from Inducible NO-synthase are several forms of shock (septic, hemorrhagic and cytoklne-lnduced). It Is clear that nonselective NO-synthase Inhibitors will lead to cardiovascular and neuronal side effects due to concomitant Inhibition of constitutive NO-synthase Isoforms.<br>
It has been shown in in-vivo animal models of septic shock that reduction of circulating plasma NO-levels by NO-scavenger or inhibition of inducible NO-synthase restores systemic blood pressure, reduces organ damage and increases survival (deAngelo Exp. Opin. Pharmacother. 19-29,1999; Redl et al. Shock 8, Suppl. 51, 1997; Strand et al. CnlCare Med. 26,1490-1499, 1998). It has also been shown that increased NO production during septic shock contributes to cardiac depression and myocardial dysfunction (Sun et al. J. Mol.Cell Cardiol. 30, 989-997,1998). Furthermore there are also reports showing reduced infarct size after occlusion of the left anterior coronary artery in the presence of NO-synthase inhibitors (Wang et al. Am. J. Hyperttens. 12,174-182,1999). Considerable inducible NO-synthase activity is found in human cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, supporting the hypothesis that NO accounts at least in part for the dilatation and impaired contractility in these pathophysiologies (de Belder et al. Br. Heart. J. 4, 426-430,1995).<br>
In animal models of acute or chronic inflammation, blockade of inducible NO-synthase by isoform-selective or nonselective inhibitors or genetic knock out improves therapeutic outcome. It is reported that experimental arthritis (Connor et al. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 273, 15-24,1995) and osteoarthritis (Pelletier et al. Arthritis &amp; Rheum. 41,1275-1286,1998), experimental inflammations of the gastro¬intestinal tract (Zingarelli et al. Gut 45,199-209,1999), experimental glomerulonephritis (Narita et al. Lab. Invest. 72,17-24,1995), experimental diabetes (Corbett et al. PNAS 90,8992-8995,1993), LPS-induced experimental lung injury is reduced by inhibition of inducible NO-synthase or in iNOS-knock out mice (Kristof et al. Am. J. Crit. Care. Med. 158,1883-1889,1998). A pathophysiological role of inducible ^lO-synthase derived NO or 02' is also discussed in chronic inflammatory diseases such as asthma, Drorrchitis and COPD.<br>
furthermore, in models of neurodegenerative diseases of the CNS such as MPTP-induced parkinsonism, amyloid peptide induced Alzheimer's disease (Ishii et al., FASEB J. 14,1485-1489, 2000), malonate induced Huntington's disease (Connop et al. Neuropharmacol. 35,459-465,1996), axperimental menengitis (Korytko &amp; Boje Neuropharmacol. 35, 231-237,1996) and experimental encephalitis (Parkinson et al. J. Mol. Med. 75,174-186, 1997) a causal participation of NO and nducible NO-synthase has been shown.<br>
ncreased iNOS expression has been found in the brains of AIDS victims and it Is reasonable to assume a role of iNOS in AIDS related dementia (Bagasra et al. J. Neurovirol. 3 153-167, 1997).<br>
Dther  studies  implicated  nitric  oxide  as  a  potential  mediator of microglia dependent  primary iemyelination, a hallmark of multiple sklerosis (Parkinson et al. J. Mol. Med. 75, 174-186,1997).<br><br>
An Inflammatory roacllon with concomitant oxprossion of Inducible NO-synthase also lakes place during cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (ladecola el al. Stroke 27, 1373-1380, 1996). Resulting NO together with 02"from infiltrating neutrophils Is thought to be responsible for cellular and organ damage. Also, In modols of traumatic brain Injury (Mosongo ot al, J. Nourotrauma 13, 209-214,1996; Wada ot al. Neurosurgery 43,1427-1436,1998) NO-synthase Inhibitors have been show to posses protective properties. A regulatory role for inducible NO-synthase has been reported in various tumor cell lines (Tozer &amp; Everett Clin Oncol. 9. 357-264,1997).<br>

Enzyme reaction is stopped by adding 10 pi of 2M MES-buffer pH 5,0. 50 pi of the incubation mixture are transferred into a MADP N65 filtration microtiter plate (Millipore, Eschbom, FRG) containing already 50 pi of AG-50W-X8 cation exchange resin (Biorad, MQnchen, -RG). The resin in the Na loaded form Is pre-equilibrated in water and 70 pi (corresponding to 50 pi dry &gt;eads) are pipetted under heavy stirring with a 8 channel pipette into the filtration plate. After pipetting 50 pi of the enzyme reaction mixture onto the filtration plates, the plates are placed on a filtration nanifold (Porvair, Shepperton, UK) and the flow through is collected in Pico scintillation plates Packard, Meriden, CT). The resin in the filtration plates is washed with 75 pi of water (1x50 pi and 1x 15 pi) which is also collected in the same plate as the sample. The total flow through of 125 pi is mixed vith 175 pi of Microscint-40 scintillation cocktail (Packard) and the scintillation plate is sealed with TopSeal P-foil (Packard).
