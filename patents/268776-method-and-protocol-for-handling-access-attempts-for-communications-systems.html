Description<br>
METHOD AND PROTOCOL FOR HANDLING ACCESS AT-<br>
TEMPTSFOR COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to radio communications, and in particular, relates to<br>
managing access attempts for communication systems.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	A radio (wireless) communication system may be comprised of an access network<br>
and a plurality of access terminals. The access network may include access points,<br>
such as Node Bs, base stations, or the like, that allow the access terminals to connect<br>
with the access network for uplink (UL: terminal-to-network) communications and<br>
downlink (DL: network-to-terminal) communications via various types of channels.<br>
The access terminals may be user equipment (UE), mobile stations, or the like.<br>
[3]	Although the concepts described hereafter may be applicable to different types of c<br>
ommunication systems, the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS)<br>
will be described merely for exemplary purposes. A typical UMTS has at least one<br>
core network (CN) connected with at least one UTRAN (UMTS Terrestrial Radio<br>
Access Network) that has Node Bs acting as access points for multiple UEs.<br>
[4]	Figure 1 shows the radio interface protocol architecture according to the 3GPP<br>
radio access network standards. The radio interface protocol has horizontal layers<br>
comprising a physical layer, a data link layer, and a network layer, and has vertical<br>
planes comprising a user plane (U-plane) for transmitting user data and a control plane<br>
(C-plane) for transmitting control information. The user plane is a region that handles<br>
traffic information with the user, such as voice or Internet protocol (IP) packets. The<br>
control plane is a region that handles control information for an interface with a<br>
network, maintenance and management of a call, and the like.<br>
[5]	The protocol layers in Figure 1 can be divided into a first layer (LI), a second layer<br>
(L2), and a third layer (L3) based on the three lower layers of an open system inter-<br>
connection (OSI) standard model. The first layer (LI), namely, the physical layer<br>
(PHY), provides an information transfer service to an upper layer by using various<br>
radio transmission techniques. The physical layer is connected to an upper layer called<br>
a medium access control (MAC) layer, via a transport channel. The MAC layer and the<br>
physical layer exchange data via the transport channel. The second layer (L2) includes<br>
a MAC layer, a radio link control (RLC) layer, a broadcast/multicast control (BMC)<br>
layer, and a packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) layer. The MAC layer handles<br>
mapping between logical channels and transport channels and provides allocation of<br><br>
2<br>
the MAC parameters for allocation and re-allocation of radio resources. The MAC<br>
layer is connected to an upper layer called the radio link control (RLC) layer, via a<br>
logical channel. Various logical channels are provided according to the type of in-<br>
formation transmitted.<br>
[6]	The MAC layer is connected to the physical layer by transport channels and can be<br>
divided into a MAC-b sub-layer, a MAC-d sub-layer, a MAC-c/sh sub-layer, a MAC-<br>
hs sub-layer and a MAC-m sublayer according to the type of transport channel being<br>
managed. The MAC-b sub-layer manages a BCH (Broadcast Channel), which is a<br>
transport channel handling the broadcasting of system information. The MAC-c/sh<br>
sub-layer manages a common transport channel, such as a forward access channel<br>
(FACH) or a downlink shared channel (DSCH), which is shared by a plurality of<br>
terminals, or in the uplink, the Random Access Channel (RACH). The MAC-m<br>
sublayer may handle the MBMS data. The MAC-d sub-layer manages a dedicated<br>
channel (DCH), which is a dedicated transport channel for a specific terminal. The<br>
MAC-d sublayer is located in a serving RNC (SRNC) that manages a corresponding<br>
terminal and one MAC-d sublayer also exists in each terminal.<br>
[7]	The RLC layer, depending of the RLC mode of operation, supports reliable data<br>
transmissions and performs segmentation and concatenation on a plurality of RLC<br>
service data units (SDUs) delivered from an upper layer. When the RLC layer receives<br>
the RLC SDUs from the upper layer, the RLC layer adjusts the size of each RLC SDU<br>
in an appropriate manner based upon processing capacity, and then creates data units<br>
by adding header information thereto. These data units, called protocol data units<br>
(PDUs), are transferred to the MAC layer via a logical channel. The RLC layer<br>
includes a RLC buffer for storing the RLC SDUs and/or the RLC PDUs.<br>
[8]	The BMC layer schedules a cell broadcast (CB) message transferred from the core<br>
network and broadcasts the CB message to terminals positioned in a specific cell or<br>
cells.<br>
[9]	The PDCP layer is located above the RLC layer. The PDCP layer is used to<br>
transmit network protocol data, such as IPv4 or IPv6, efficiently on a radio interface<br>
with a relatively small bandwidth. For this purpose, the PDCP layer reduces un-<br>
necessary control information used in a wired network, namely, a function called<br>
header compression is performed.<br>
[10]	The radio resource control (RRC) layer located at the lowest portion of the third<br>
layer (L3) is only defined in the control plane. The RRC layer controls the transport<br>
channels and the physical channels in relation to setup, reconfiguration, and the release<br>
or cancellation of the radio bearers (RBs). The RB signifies a service provided by the<br>
second layer (L2) for data transmission between the terminal and the UTRAN. In<br>
general, the set up of the RB refers to the process of stipulating the characteristics of a<br><br>
3<br>
protocol layer and a channel required for providing a specific data service, and setting<br>
the respective detailed parameters and operation methods. Additionally, the RRC layer<br>
handles user mobility within the RAN, and additional services, e.g., location services.<br>
[11]	Call establishment between a HE (User Equipment) and a radio network in current<br>
wireless communications systems, such as UMTS, is performed on a RACH (Random<br>
Access Channel) according to appropriate procedures. The timing at which the UE can<br>
start a random access procedure is derived on the basis of an Access Service Class<br>
(ASC) that gives a priority level for access attempts. The random access procedure is<br>
divided into two phases-, an access attempt phase, and when the access is succeeded the<br>
message transmission phase indicating an establishment cause. When the establishment<br>
cause is decoded by the network, depending upon the request and the radio resource<br>
availability, a decision is made by the network to accept or to reject the call es-<br>
tablishment.<br>
[12]	In general, the procedure where the UE sends a first message to the network is<br>
referred to as initial access. For this, the common uplink channel called RACH<br>
(Random Access Channel) is used. In all cases (GSM and UMTS systems), the initial<br>
access starts from the UE with the connection request message including the reason of<br>
the request, and the answer from the network indicating the allocation of radio<br>
resources for the requested reason.<br>
[13]	There are several reasons, which may be referred to as an establishment cause, for<br>
sending a connection request message and the following list shows some examples<br>
specified in UMTS:<br>
[14]	Originating Conversational Call,<br>
[15]	Originating Streaming Call,<br>
[16]	Originating Interactive Call,<br>
[17]	Originating Background Call,<br>
[18]	Originating Subscribed traffic Call,<br>
[19]	Terminating Conversational Call,<br>
[20]	Terminating Streaming Call,<br>
[21]	Terminating Interactive Call,<br>
[22]	Terminating Background Call,<br>
[23]	Emergency Call,<br>
[24]	Inter-RAT cell re-selection,<br>
[25]	Inter-RAT cell change order,<br>
[26]	Registration, Detach,<br>
[27]	Originating High Priority Signalling,<br>
[28]	Originating Low Priority Signalling,<br>
[29]	Call re-establishment,<br><br>
4<br>
[30]	Terminating High Priority Signalling,<br>
[31]	Terminating Low Priority Signalling,<br>
[32]	Regarding the definitions of the terms used above, originating call means that the<br>
UE wants to setup a connection (for instance a speech connection), terminating call<br>
means that the UE answers to paging, while registration means that the user wants to<br>
register only to perform a location update.<br>
[33]	To send the information over the air interface, the physical random access<br>
procedure is used. The physical random access transmission is performed under the<br>
control of a higher layer protocol, which performs some important functions related to<br>
priority and load control. These procedures differ between GSM and UMTS radio<br>
systems. The description of GSM random access procedure can be found in The GSM<br>
System for Mobile Communications, published by M. Mouly and M. B. Pautet, 1992.<br>
As the present innovation is UMTS enhancement/evolution related, the W-CDMA<br>
random access procedure will be described in more detailed below.<br>
[34]	In the UMTS physical layer random access procedure, the UE randomly selects an<br>
access resource and transmits a RACH preamble part of a random access procedure to<br>
the network. The preamble is a short signal that is sent before the transmission of the<br>
RACH connection request message. The UE repeatedly transmits the preamble by<br>
increasing the transmission power every time the preamble is sent until it receives an<br>
AI (Acquisition Indicator) on an AICH (Acquisition Indicator Channel), which<br>
indicates the detection of the preamble by the network. The UE stops the transmission<br>
of the preamble once it receives the AI (Acquisition Indicator), and sends the message<br>
part at a level of power equal to the preamble transmission power at that point, plus an<br>
offset signalled by the network. This random access procedure avoids a power ramping<br>
procedure for the entire message. Such power ramping procedure would create more<br>
interference due to unsuccessful sent messages and it would be less efficient due to the<br>
larger delay, since it would take much more time to decode the message before an ac-<br>
knowledgement could be given that it was received successful.<br>
[35]	The main characteristics of the RACH is that it is a contention based channel, which<br>
means that due to simultaneous access of several users, collisions may occur such that<br>
the initial access message cannot be decoded by the network. The UE can start the<br>
random-access transmission (both preambles and message) at the beginning of an<br>
access slot only. This kind of access method is therefore a type of slotted ALOHA<br>
approach with fast acquisition indication.<br>
[36]	Figure 2 shows an example of the timing (i.e. access slots) related to a random<br>
access transmission, while Figure 3 shows examples of the reception of a downlink<br>
AICH access slot by the UE and the reception of an uplink PRACH access slot by the<br>
UE.<br><br>
5<br>
[37]	The time axis of both the RACH and the AICH is divided into time intervals, called<br>
access slots. There are 15 access slots per two frames (one frame is 10 ms in length or<br>
38400 chips) and they are spaced 1.33 ms (5120 chips) apart. Information on what<br>
access slots are available for random-access transmission and what timing offsets to<br>
use between RACH and ATCH, between two successive preambles and between the<br>
last preamble and the message is signalled by the network. If the AICH transmission<br>
timing is 0 and 1, it is sent 3 and 4 access slots after the last preamble access slot<br>
transmitted, respectively<br>
[38]	As for the format of the preambles,each preamble consists of 4096 chips, which is a<br>
sequence of 256 repetitions of Hadamard codes of length 16. The Hadamard codes are<br>
referred to as the signatureof the preamble. There are 16 different signatures and a<br>
signature is randomly selected (from available signatures sets on the basis of ASC) and<br>
repeated 256 times for each transmission of the preamble part.<br>
[39]	Figure 4 shows an exemplary structure (format) of the AICH. The AICH consists of<br>
a repeated sequence of 15 consecutive access slots, each having a length of 40 bit<br>
intervals (5120chips). Each access slot consists of two parts, an Acquisition Indicator<br>
(AI) part consisting of 32 real-valued signals aO,..., a31 and a part of duration 1024<br>
chips where transmission is switched off.<br>
[40]	When the network detects the transmission of a RACH preamble in a RACH access<br>
slot with a certain signature, it repeats tixis signature in the associated AICH access<br>
slot. This means that the Hadamard code used as the signature on the RACH preamble<br>
is modulated onto the AI part of the AICH. The acquisition indicator corresponding to<br>
the signature can take the values +U-1, and 0, depending upon whether a positive ac-<br>
knowledgement, a negative acknowledgement or no acknowledgement is given to a<br>
specific signature.<br>
[41]	A positive polarity of the signature indicates that the preamble has been acquired<br>
and the message can be sent. A negative polarity indicates that the preamble has been<br>
acquired and the power ramping procedure shall be stopped, but the message shall not<br>
be sent. This negative acknowledgement is used when there is a congestion situation in<br>
the network, and thus a transmitted message cannot be processed at the present time. In<br>
this case, the access attempt needs to be repeated some time later by the UE.<br>
[42]	For the control of random access transmissions, the network decides whether the<br>
mobile station should be permitted to use radio access resource based primarily upon<br>
the access class to which the UE belongs. A specified priority level is implied by the<br>
Access Class (AC) which is stored on the UE SIM card.<br>
[43]	Certain aspect of access control will be described hereafter. Regarding the purpose<br>
of access control,under certain circumstances, it will be desirable to prevent UE users<br>
from making access attempts (including emergency call attempts) or responding to<br><br>
6<br>
pages in specified areas of a PLMN (Public Land Mobile Network). Such situations<br>
may arise during states of emergency, or where 1 of 2 or more co-located PLMNs has<br>
failed. Broadcast messages should be available on a cell-by-cell basis indicating the<br>
class(es) of subscribers barred from network access. The use of this facility allows the<br>
network operator to prevent overload of the access channel under critical conditions. It<br>
is not intended that access control be used under normal operating conditions.<br>
[44]	Figure 5 shows an example of the types of access classes (AC) and their re-<br>
spectively related access service (AS), each containing an information element (IE).<br>
[45]	For allocation,all UEs are members of one out of ten randomly allocated mobile<br>
populations, defined as Access Classes 0 to 9. The population number can be stored in<br>
a SIM/USIM for the UE. In addition, the UEs may be members of one or more out of 5<br>
special categories (Access Classes 11 to 15), which also may be stored in the SIM/<br>
USIM. These may be allocated to specific high priority users as follows. (This<br>
enumeration is not meant as a priority sequence):<br>
[46]	Class 15 - PLMN Staff;<br>
[47]	Class 14 - Emergency Services;<br>
[48]	Class 13 - Public Utilities (e.g. water/gas suppliers);<br>
[49]	Class 12 - Security Services;<br>
[50]	Class 11 - For PLMN Use.<br>
[51]	For operation, if the UE is a member of at least one Access Class which<br>
corresponds to the permitted classes as signalled over the air interface, and the Access<br>
Class is applicable in the serving network, access attempts are allowed. Otherwise<br>
access attempts are not allowed.<br>
[52]	Access Classes are applicable as follows:<br>
[53]	Classes 0 ~ 9 - Home and Visited PLMNs;<br>
[54]	Classes 11 and 15 - Home PLMN only;<br>
[55]	Classes 12, 13,14- Home PLMN and visited PLMNs of home<br>
[56]	country only,<br>
[57]<br>
[58]	Any number of these classes may be barred at any one time.<br>
[59]	For emergency calls, an additional control bit known as Access Class 10 is also<br>
signalled over the air interface to the UE. This indicates whether or not network access<br>
for Emergency Calls is allowed for UEs with access classes 0 to 9 or without an IMSI.<br>
For UEs with access classes 11 to 15, Emergency Calls are not allowed if both Access<br>
Class 10 and the relevant Access Class (11 to 15) are barred. Otherwise, Emergency<br>
Calls may be allowed.<br>
[60]	In UMTS, the AC are mapped to Access Service Classes (ASC). There are eight<br>
different priority levels defined (ASC 0 to ASC 7), with level 0 being the highest<br><br>
7<br>
priority.<br>
[61]	For Mapping of Access Classes to Access Service Classes,the Access Classes shall<br>
only be applied at initial access, i.e. when sending an RRC CONNECTION REQUEST<br>
message. A mapping between Access Class (AC) and Access Service Class (ASC)<br>
shall be indicated by the information element AC-to-ASC mapping in System In-<br>
formation Block type 5. The correspondence between AC and ASC is indicated in<br>
Figure 5.<br>
[62]	In the table of Figure 5, the n IE designates an ASC number i in the range 0 - 7 to<br>
AC. If the ASC indicated by the n IE is undefined, the UE behaviour is unspecified.<br>
[63]	For random access, the parameters implied by the respective ASC shall be<br>
employed. In case the UE is a member of several ACs, it shall select the ASC for the<br>
highest AC number. In connected mode, AC shall not be applied.<br>
[64]	An ASC consists of a subset of RACH preamble signatures and access slots, which<br>
are allowed to be used for this access attempt and a persistence value corresponding to<br>
a probability Pv 
access transmission is a load control mechanism, which allows reducing of the load of<br>
incoming traffic when the collision probability is high or when radio resources are low.<br>
[65]	Figures 6 and 7 show a flow chart of the control access procedure.<br>
[66]	1. Existing specifications provide many RACH transmission control parameters<br>
which are stored and updated by the UE based on system information broadcasted by<br>
the network. The RACH transmission control parameters include Physical RACH<br>
(PRACH), Access Service Class (ASC), a maximum number of preamble ramping<br>
cycles M range of backoff interval for timer T given in terms of numbers of<br>
max,	BOl,<br>
transmission 10 ms time intervals N	and N , applicable when negative ac-<br>
BOlmax	BOlmm<br>
knowledgement on AICH is received (S201).<br>
[67]	2. The UE maps the assigned AC to an ASC, and a count value M is set to zero<br>
(S203 S205, S207).<br>
[68]	3. The count value M is incremented by one (S209). Next, the UE determines if the<br>
count value M representing the number of transmission attempts exceeds the maximum<br>
number of permitted RACH transmission attempts M (S211). If so, then the UE<br>
max<br>
treats the transmission as unsuccessful (S212).<br>
[69]	4. However, if M is less than or equal to the maximum number of permitted RACH<br>
transmission attempts M , then the UE updates the RACH transmission control<br>
max<br>
parameters (S213). In the next step, a 10 ms timer T2 is set (S215). The UE decides<br>
whether to attempt transmission based on the persistence value Pi associated with the<br>
ASC selected by the UE. Specifically, a random number Ri is generated between 0 and<br>
1 (S217). If the random number Ri is less than or equal to the persistence value Pi, the<br>
UE attempts to transmit over the assigned RACH resources, otherwise, the UE waits<br><br>
8<br>
until the 10 ms timer T2 expires and perform the procedure in step 4 again (S219,<br>
S220, S221).<br>
[70]	5. When one access attempt is transmitted, the UE determines whether the network<br>
responds with an Acknowledgement (ACK), a Non Acknowledgment (NACK), or no<br>
response (S223). If no response is received from the network, after the timer T2<br>
expires the process is performed again from step 3 (S224). If a NACK, indicating a<br>
failed receipt of the transmission by the network (often due to collision) is received,<br>
then the UE waits for the timer T2 to expire then generates a back off value N<br>
BOl<br>
randomly chosen between the maximum and minimum back off values N	and N<br>
BOlmax<br>
associated with the PRACH assigned to the UE (S225). The UE then waits a back<br>
BOlmin<br>
off interval T equal to 10 ms times the back off value N before performing the<br>
BOl	BOl<br>
process from step again (S226). If an ACK, indicating receipt of the UE transmission<br>
by the network, is received, then the UE begins the message transmission (S227).<br>
[71]	Figure 8 shows an example of Signalling Establishment procedure.Once the<br>
PRACH power control preambles have been acknowledged, the RRC Connection<br>
Request message can be transmitted (S81). It contains the reason why the connection is<br>
requested.<br>
[72]	Depending on the request reason, the radio network makes a decision regarding the<br>
kind of resources to reserve, and performs synchronization and signaling establishment<br>
among certain radio network nodes (i.e. Node B and serving RNC) (S82). When the<br>
radio network is ready, it sends to the UE the Connection Setup message conveying in-<br>
formation about the radio resources to use (S83). The UE confirms connection es-<br>
tablishment by sending the Connection Setup Complete message (S84). When the<br>
connection has been established, the UE sends an Initial Direct Transfer message<br>
including a large amount of information, such as the UE identity, its current location,<br>
and the kind of transaction requested (S85). Then the UE and the network authenticate<br>
each other and establish security mode communication (S86). The actual set up in-<br>
formation is delivered through the Call Control Setup message (S87). It identifies the<br>
transaction and indicates the quality of service (QoS) requirements. Upon receiving the<br>
message, the network starts activities for radio bearer allocation by checking if there<br>
are enough resources available to satisfy the requested QoS. If yes, the radio bearer is<br>
allocated according to the request. If not, the network may select either to continue<br>
allocation with a lowered QoS value, or it may select to queue the request until radio<br>
resources become available or to reject the call request (S88, S89).<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[73]	However, the present inventor has recognized that improvements to the background<br><br>
9<br>
art could be made. Namely, one problem that needs to be solved is the delay associated<br>
to the random access procedure and the interference level due to network signaling<br>
with call establishment.<br>
[74]	For example, once the access attempt has been acknowledged by the network, the<br>
data message containing the reason for the connection request can be transmitted. If the<br>
UE is within an area of poor uplink coverage, then it is possible that the network does<br>
not receive this message and does not send a response. In this case, the UE may need<br>
to re-transmit this message many times and this can have a significant impact on the<br>
call establishment delay and also affect the network interference level.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[75]	A scheme for managing access attempts for communication systems is achieved by<br>
deriving a probability of access transmission as a function of both a priority level for<br>
access attempts and the purpose(s) for RACH (i.e., random access cause, RACH cause,<br>
reason for random access, etc.).<br>

Mode for the Invention<br>
[86]	One aspect of the present invention is the recognition by the present inventor<br>
regarding the problems and drawbacks of the related art described above. Based upon<br>
such recognition, the features of the present invention have been developed.<br>
[87]	Although the following description will refer to optimized RACH procedures for<br>
UMTS merely for the sake of explanation, the features of the present invention are<br>
clearly intended to be applicable to various other types of communication methods and<br><br>
10<br>
systems that would benefit from employing the particular features of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[88]	One aspect of the invention is to provide priority levels for allowed access attempts<br>
on a basis of access class (AC) and the purpose(s) for RACH.<br>
[89]	Here, it should be noted that the purpose(s) for RACH may also be referred to by<br>
other similar terms and phrases, such as random access cause, RACH cause, es-<br>
tablishment cause, reason for random access, and the like. However, it can be clearly<br>
understood that such labeling and other terminology are mere exemplary and thus may<br>
be clarified (or amended) as a result of ongoing or future discussions in stan-<br>
dardization.<br>
[90]	Another aspect of the invention is to derive the purpose(s) for RACH from the first<br>
phase of access attempt through the various combinations of access resources<br>
allocation in frequency domain, in time domain, in code domain, or mixtures thereof.<br>
The allocation resources for allowed access attempt can be achieved in several ways,<br>
with the most suitable depending on the application or the purpose(s) for RACH and<br>
the type of data being transferred or the particular requirement.<br>
[91]	The invention could be implemented as part of any fixed or wireless network in<br>
order to optimize the random access delay and to reduce the interference level of the<br>
associate signaling.<br>
[92]	Similar to the background art, all UEs are members of randomly allocated mobile<br>
populations, defined as Access Classes (AC). The population number may be stored in<br>
the UE (e.g., stored in a SIM/USIM). If the UE is a member of at least one AC which<br>
corresponds to the permitted classes as signalled by the network, access attempts are<br>
allowed; otherwise access attempts are not allowed.<br>
[93]	Equation (1):<br>
[94]	Allowed access attempt = f(access service class).<br>
[95]	In the present invention, UE derives when to start access attempts, based on the<br>
transmission probability on a basis of access service class and also on the basis of<br>
access resources allocated to the corresponding purpose(s) for RACH as signalled by<br>
the network.<br>
[96]	Equation (2):<br>
[97]	Probability of access transmission =j\access service class, purposes for RACH).<br>
[98]	The particular purpose(s) for RACH for which a UE wants the access determines<br>
when the UE is allowed to use access resources. Allocation of access resources should<br>
be done through the various combinations of radio resources in frequency domain, in<br>
time domain, in code domain, or mixtures thereof.<br>
[99]	Equation (3):<br>
[100]	Radio access resource allocation =f(time and/or frequency and/or code and/or...).<br><br>
11<br>
[101]	Equation (4):<br>
[102]	Allowed access resource = /(Purposes for RACH).<br>
[103]	Access resources should be divided among several purposes for RACH with<br>
different priorities. Note that the purposes for RACH could be divided into different<br>
purpose for RACH groups depending on the type of data being transferred, such as,<br>
traffic class (conversational, background, interactive, streaming); mobility<br>
management (location area update, etc.); measurement report, and the like.<br>
[104]	Each purpose for RACH represents the transmission priority of the access attempt,<br>
so that certain kinds of cause have a higher probability to gain access than other kinds<br>
of cause. Allocation of access resources could be fixed or based on a load balancing<br>
through the possible establishment cause. Load balancing can be implemented in<br>
different ways, for example:<br>
[105]	Random Allocation<br>
[106]	In a random allocation, access resources are assigned to any purpose for RACH<br>
randomly. Such case can lead to overloading of access resources for one purpose for<br>
RACH while under allocation of others, since one of the purpose for RACH may be<br>
assigned many more access resources during some time period , while the other<br>
purpose for RACH are without accesses resources assigned. However, on average,<br>
each purpose for RACH gets its share of the load due to the random selection.<br>
[107]	Uniform Allocation<br>
[108]	Uniform allocation keeps the access resources equally divided among the available<br>
purposes for RACH in an orderly fashion. The access resources are allocated on a<br>
rotating basis. Allocation of resources for the first purpose for RACH is selected<br>
randomly from the list of purposes for RACH. For the following allocations, the<br>
selection follows the circular order. Once a purpose for RACH is assigned to access<br>
resources, this purpose for RACH is moved to the end of the list.<br>
[109]	Weighted Allocation<br>
[110]	Weighted allocation is a variant of uniform allocation. In case of a weighted<br>
allocation, one can assign a weight to each purpose for RACH in the list so that if one<br>
network/operator wants to allocate twice as much access resources to one purpose for<br>
RACH as the other, this purpose for RACH gets a weight of two. In such cases, the<br>
network/operator can take care of the network capacity and access resources capacity<br>
for any purpose for RACH.<br>
[Ill]	The configuration of a load balancing should be decided on the particular re-<br>
quirement. For example, the weighted allocation should be used:<br>
[112]	- if some of the purposes for RACH take longer than the others to process;<br>
[113]	- to allow access for some purposes for RACH while denying the access to other;<br>
and/or<br><br>
12<br>
[114]	- to control availability of radio resources dedicated for specific services.<br>
[115]	However, if the capacity is equally required for all purposes for RACH, uniform<br>
allocation will be sufficient.<br>
[116]	Accordingly, the access resources in which the UE attempts the access indicate<br>
about the purpose(s) for RACH. In such case, the present invention solves the<br>
problems of the background art.<br>
[117]	No need to transmit or re-transmit the message conveying purpose for RACH, thus:<br>
number of signalling message is reduced; and interference level caused by re-<br>
transmissions is decreased.<br>
[118]	Also, collision probability is decreased by: 1/number of purposes for RACH, since<br>
the purposes for RACH for which a UE wants the access determines when the UE is<br>
allowed to use access resources.<br>
[119]	Thus, the overall access delay is decreased compared to the background art.<br>
[120]	Figure 9 shows a call establishment procedure of the background art., and Figure 10<br>
shows an embodiment of a call establishment procedure of the present invention.<br>
[121]	Referring to Figure 9, the call establishment procedure in the related art required the<br>
exchanging of several messages between a mobile terminal (UE: user equipment) and a<br>
radio network. The call establishment procedure is divided into two phases.<br>
[122]	In the first phase, the UE derives a random access probability on the basis of an<br>
access service class (S91). Upon doing so, a message indicating an access attempt<br>
procedure is sent to the network (S92). When the access attempt is successful, the<br>
network responds by sending a message indicating such to the UE (S94). It can be<br>
noted that multiple access attempts may need to be repeatedly performed until it is<br>
successful. In these multiple access attempts, a new random access probability is<br>
derived for each repetition (S93).<br>
[123]	In the second phase, upon receiving the message from the network indicating that<br>
the access attempt was successful, the UE then transmits another message that includes<br>
the purpose(s) for RACH (i.e., the reason or purpose of call establishment) (S95).<br>
Upon proper receipt, the network sends an acknowledgement back to the UE (S97).<br>
Here, the sending of the purpose(s) for RACH may need to be repeated until proper ac-<br>
knowledgement from the network is received (S96).<br>
[124]	Upon completing the first and second phases, a link establishment authentication<br>
and security control for call establishment are performed (S98).<br>
[125]	Referring to Figure 10, the call establishment procedure of the present invention<br>
requires a minimal amount of message exchanges between the UE and the network.<br>
Here, the related art second phase procedure is not necessary in the present invention.<br>
[126]	The UE derives a random access probability on the basis of an access service class<br>
and also the purposes for RACH (S101). Upon doing so, a message indicating an<br><br>
13<br>
access attempt procedure is sent to the network (S102). When the access attempt is<br>
successful, the network responds by sending a message indicating such to the UE<br>
(S104). It can be noted that multiple access attempts may need to be repeatedly<br>
performed until it is successful. In these multiple access attempts, a new random access<br>
probability is derived for each repetition (S103).<br>
[127]	Thereafter, a link establishment authentication and security control for call es-<br>
tablishment are performed (S104, S105).<br>
[1281	Thus far, an exemplary scheme for improved access attempts has been described for<br>
mobile communication systems. However, the concept and features of the present<br>
invention are not limited to wireless system, but has applicability to any com-<br>
munication system having an access protocol for communication resources.<br>
[129]	The probability of access transmission is on a basis of both and access service class<br>
as well as the purposes for RACH (i.e., random access cause, RACH cause, etc.). The<br>
reason for call establishment is derived from the first phase of access attempt through<br>
the various combinations of access resources allocation. The particular purpose for<br>
RACH for which a UE wants the access determines when the UE is allowed to use<br>
access resources.<br>
[130]	The present invention may result in a decrease in random access delays, a decrease<br>
in collision probability, a reduction in signaling messages, a decrease in interference<br>
level caused by a related art establishment cause message transmission, and the Like.<br>
[131]	Minimizing the call setup delay across the network may be additionally achieved by<br>
also improving coverage and reducing the number of retransmissions.<br>
[132]	The present invention provides a method of handling access attempts by a network,<br>
the method comprising: allocating access resources depending upon at least one<br>
random access cause in relation with access service classes; transmitting information<br>
about the allocated access resources; and allowing at least one terminal to perform<br>
access attempts using the allocated access resources<br>
[133]	The method may further comprise: deriving the random access cause from a<br>
preamble in an access burst received from the terminal. The deriving step may<br>
comprise: using radio resources divided among several random access causes or<br>
groups of random access causes with different priorities. The allocating step may<br>
comprise allocation of access resources in a fixed or dynamic manner. The dynamic<br>
allocation of access resources may be based on load balancing. The load balancing<br>
may be performed through random access causes. The load balancing may be im-<br>
plemented by at least one of a group comprising random allocation, uniform allocation<br>
and weighted allocation. The network may know how to reserve appropriate resources<br>
for a traffic channel depending on the ransom access cause. The ransom access cause<br>
may be derived from a first phase of an access attempt through various combinations<br><br>
14<br>
of access resource allocation in frequency domain, in time domain, or both. The access<br>
resource allocation may also depend on the type of data being transferred.<br>
[134]	Also, the present invention provides a method of handling access attempts by a<br>
terminal, the method comprising: receiving parameters about access attempts from a<br>
network; receiving information about radio access resources for each random access<br>
cause; and attempting random access on a basis of an access service class and a<br>
random access cause.<br>
[135]	The attempting step may be performed in a given window period if time division<br>
multiplexing is used. The attempting step may comprise: transmitting a preamble in an<br>
access burst related to the random access cause. The access service class may be used<br>
to derive a random access attempt, and the random access cause is used to derive<br>
which access resources are to be used.<br>
[136]	Additionally, the present invention provides a radio interface protocol stack<br>
comprising: a protocol entity adapted to derive a probability of access transmission as<br>
a function of both a priority level for access attempts and a random access cause, and<br>
to perform link establishment authentication and security control call establishment<br>
based upon the deriving.<br>
[137]	The priority level may be defined as an access service class indicating a randomly<br>
allocated mobile population number. The random access cause may be defined as a<br>
purpose for RACH. The protocol stack wherein the features may be implemented in a<br>
mobile terminal. The deriving step may comprise: receiving parameters about access<br>
attempts from a network; and receiving information about radio access resources for<br>
each random access cause. The protocol entity may be implemented in a network<br>
entity. The deriving step may comprise: allocating access resources depending upon at<br>
least one random access cause in relation with access service classes; and transmitting,<br>
to a mobile terminal, information about the allocated access resources.<br>
[138]	It should be noted that the features of the present invention are related to at least the<br>
3GPP standard. Certain relative portions of the 3GPP specification, such as 22.011 (=<br>
GSM 02.11), 25.321, 25.331 related to the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol<br>
specification, V6.5.0 and their related sections or portions thereof, as well as various<br>
