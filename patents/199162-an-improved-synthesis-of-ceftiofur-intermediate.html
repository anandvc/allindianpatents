				<td>AN IMPROVED SYNTHESIS OF CEFTIOFUR INTERMEDIATE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention discloses an improved process for the preparation of 7-amino-3 -[2-<br>
(fiirylcarbonyl) thiomethyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid represented by formula (I)<br><br>
Ceftiofur acid, its alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and amines salts were reported for the first time in US patent no. 4464367. The ceftiofur is a condensation product of 7-ACA with furyl-2-carbonylthiol and 2-(2-amino thiazol-4-yl)-2-methoxyimino) acetic acid at<br><br>
its 3 and 7 positions respectively. 7-amino-3 - [2-furylcarbonyl) thiomethyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid represented by formula (I) is the key intermediate which decides the quality and overall yield of the process for making ceftiofiir.<br>
There are very few methods reported in the literature for the synthesis of 7-amino-3 - [2-(furylcarbonyl) thiomethyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid (I). The first report for the synthesis of this intermediate appeared in the US patent No. 4464367, wherein the method used for the preparation of the compound of Formula (I) was followed from a reference from the journal of Antibiotics 27,573-8,(1974) .This reference is about the condensation of 7 - aminocephalosporanic acid and sodium thiofuroate carried out at a pH of 6.4 using phosphate buffer .The reaction time is very long by following this tedious method and a yield is of 47% is reported for the final product. These limitations make this process unfavorable for commercial exploitation. Another method was disclosed in WO patent 87/01117 which is also merely an extension of the above-mentioned US patent. The condensation was effected by reaction of sodium thiofuroate and 7-ACA at a temperature of 65°C in an aqueous medium at a pH of 6.4. Cephalosporins are known to decompose at high temperature and moreover using this process, the reaction is not completed and yields are also very poor (about 45% and in addition, the reaction takes longer time, for example, even after several hours the reaction is incomplete).<br>
Looking at all these problems, a method for the condensation under non-aqueous conditions was reported in US patent no. 5387679, where condensation of 7-ACA with heterocyclic thiols in the presence of complex of borontriflouride with dialkyl carbonate was carried out to provide intermediates which are used in the synthesis of cephalosporin antibiotics.<br>
When the process of US patent No. 5387679 is applied for the condensation of 7-ACA and fiiryl-2-carbonylthiol, the reaction mixture obtained is associated with several impurities, which could not be separated even during the final purification step. Later on, after several experimentation, the applicant found that the stability of ftiryl-2-carbonylthiol isolated in solid form is not encouraging. Further, this problem is encountered because fiiryl-2-carbonylthiol belongs to the class of heterocyclic thioacids and not heterocyclic thiol. The behavior of the reaction is not similar for the thioacids as it was for thiols thereby<br><br>
disallowing the conditions of the US patent No. 5387679 to be used in the present invention to achieve the final result.<br>
In order to overcome this problem, the applicant provides for the first time an improved process for condensing 7-ACA with furyl-2-carbonylthiol which is generated and used in situ in the presence of borontriflouride in a gaseous state or its solution in an organic solvent to obtain compound of formula (I). This process gives desired product of formula (I) in excellent yield (90-95%) and high purity (98-99%).<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the invention is to provide an improved and commercially viable<br>
efficient   process   for   preparing   7-amino-3-[2-(furylcarbonyl)thiomethyl]-3-cephem-4-<br>

Another object of the invention is to use furyl-2-carbonylthiol in situ without isolating it.<br>

temperature which are convenient for commercial production.<br>
