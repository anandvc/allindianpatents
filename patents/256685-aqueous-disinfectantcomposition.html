1. TITLE OF THE INVENTION:-<br>
"AQUEOUS SANITIZERS,<br>
DISINFECTANTS, AND/ OR STERILANTS WITH LOW PEROXYGEN CONTENT".<br>
2.     APPLICANTS:-<br>
Name	:- SOLUTIONS BIOMED LLC.<br>
Nationality :- UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (US)<br>
Address       :- 1272 South 1380 West, Orem, UT 84058 (US)<br>
3.      PREAMBLE OF THE DESCRIPTION:-<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
AQUEOUS SANITIZERS, DISINFECTANTS. AND/OR STERILANTS WITH LOW PEROXYGEN CONTENT<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is drawn to consumer safe compositions that can be used for a variety of purposes, including for hard surface cleaning, and which are effective as disinfectants.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Disinfectants, such as hard surface disinfectants, are widely used in both domestic and professional settings. Exemplary of a commonly used hard surface cleaner is Lysol® disinfectant. Though Lysol® is effective for many applications, Lysol® is not as effective at reducing levels of bacterial endospores as commercially available glutaraldehyde aqueous solutions. Glutaraldehyde aqueous solutions are widely used as disinfectants, and are commonly available in 1 wt% and 2 wt% solutions, particularly in medical and dental settings. Glutaraldehyde solutions are typically used for more delicate medical/dental instruments that would otherwise be susceptible to damage by other sterilization methods, e.g., autoclaving. However, glutaraldehyde is also a powerful irritant and respiratory sensitizer. In fact, there have been reports of sensitization of individuals due to the fumes, which have lead to respiratory problems, headaches, lethargy, discoloring of the skin, etc. Because of these issues related to glutaraldehyde fumes, air quality must often be monitored, or appropriate air ventilation must be present. As a result, though glutaraldehyde solutions are relatively effective disinfectants, it would be desirable to provide compositions that can exhibit even more effective bacteria kill levels, and at the same time be safer for the individuals using the disinfectant.<br>
2<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has been recognized that it would be desirable to provide liquid solution and dispersion disinfectants that are effective for cleaning surfaces, particularly hard surfaces. In accordance with this, an aqueous disinfectant composition can comprise an aqueous vehicle, including water, from 0.001 wt% to 10.0 wt% of a peroxygen, and an alcohol. Additionally, from 0.001 pprn to 50,000 pprn by weight of a transition metal based on the aqueous vehicle content can also be present, with the proviso that the disinfectant composition is substantially free of aldehydes."<br>
In another embodiment, an aqueous disinfectant composition can comprise an aqueous vehicle, including water, from 0.001 wt% to 10.0 wt% of a peroxygen, and an alcohol. The composition can further comprise from 0.001 pprn to 50,000 pprn by weight of a colloidal silver or alloy thereof based on the aqueous vehicle content.<br>
In another embodiment, a method of disinfecting a surface can comprise contacting the surface with a disinfectant composition which comprises an aqueous vehicle, including water, from 0.001 wt% to 10.0 wt% of a peroxygen, and an alcohol. The composition can further comprise from 0.001 pprn to 50,000 pprn by weight of a transition metal or alloy thereof based on the aqueous vehicle content.<br>
Additional features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the detailed description that follows, which illustrates, by way of example, features of the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)<br>
Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments, and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended. Alterations and further modifications of the inventive features illustrated herein, and additional applications of the principles of the inventions as illustrated herein, which would occur to one skilled in the relevant art and having possession of this<br>
3<br><br>
disclosure, are to be considered within the scope of the invention. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is used for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only. The terms are not intended to be limiting unless specified as such.<br>
It must be noted that, as used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise.<br>
The term "food grade" when used with respect to a composition of the present invention refers to a composition that is substantially free from ingredients which would be considered harmful or toxic to a mamma! upon consumption above levels that are generally recognized as safe.<br>
Generally, though sanitizers, sterilants, and disinfectants are used for the same purpose, i.e. to kill bacteria and/or viruses, etc., a sterilant composition exhibits a greater kill level compared to a disinfectant, which in turn has a better kill level than a sanitizer. This being stated, most applications require only sanitizer or disinfectant levels bacteria/virus reduction, though other applications benefit considerably from the use of sterilants. For convenience, in the present disclosure, the term "disinfectant" is used generally and includes sanitizers, disinfectants, and sterilants unless the context dictates otherwise.<br>
The term "solution" is also used throughout the specification to describe the liquid compositions of the present invention. However, as these "solutions" can include colloidal transition metals, these compositions can also be described as dispersions or suspensions. As the continuous phase is typically a solution, and the transition metal can be present in ionic and/or colloidal form, for convenience, these compositions will typically be referred to as "solutions" herein.<br>
The term "substantially free" when used with regard to the disinfectant compositions of the present invention refers to the total absence of or near total absence of a specific compound or composition. For example, when a composition is said to be substantially free of aldehydes, there are either no aldehydes in the composition or only trace amounts of aldehydes in the composition.<br>
The term "peroxygen" refers to any compound containing a dioxygen (O-O) bond. Dioxygen bonds, particularly bivalent O-O bonds, are readily cleavable,<br>
4<br><br>
thereby allowing compounds containing them to act as powerful oxidizers. Non-limiting examples of classes of peroxygen compounds include peracids, peracid salts, and peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide.<br>
When referring to the term "alloy," it is understood that individual colloidal or metallic particles can be in the form of composite of multiple metals, or alloys can also include co-dispersions of multiple metals as separate particles.<br>
Concentrations, dimensions, amounts, and other numerical data may be presented herein in a range format. It is to be underwood that such range format is used merely for convenience and brevity and should be interpreted flexibly to include not only the numerical values explicitly recited as the limits of the range, but also to include all the individual numerical valuer or sub-ranges encompassed within that range as ifeach numerical value and sub-range is explicitly recited. For example, a weight ratio range of about 1 wt% "to about 20 wt% should be interpreted to include not only the explicitly recited limits of 1 wt% and about 20 wt%, but also to include individual weights such as 2 wt%, 11 wt%, 14 wt%, and sub-ranges such as 10 wt% to 20 wt%, 5 wt% to 15 wt%, etc.<br>
In accordance with this, an aqueous disinfectant composition can comprise an aqueous vehicle, including water, from 0.001wt% to 10.0 wt% of a peroxygen, and an alcohol. Additionally, from 0.001 ppm to 50,000 ppm by weight of a transition metal based on the aqueous vehicle content can also be present, with the proviso that the disinfectant composition is substantially free of aldehydes. In another embodiment, an aqueous disinfectant composition can comprise an aqueous vehicle, including water, from (3.001 wt% to 10.0 wt% of a peroxygen, and an alcohol. The composition can further comprise from 0.001 ppm to 50,000 ppm by weight of a colloidal silver or alloy  thereof based on the aqueous vehicle content. In yet another embodiment, a method of disinfecting a surface can comprise contacting the surface with a disinfectant composition which comprises an aqueous vehicle, including water from 0.001 wt% to 10.0 wt% of a peroxygen, and an alcohol. The composition can further comprise from 0.001 ppm to 50,000 ppm by weight of a transition metal or alloy thereof based on the aqueous vehicle content.<br>
It is noted that the lower end of the range of the peroxygen can be modified to 0.05 wt% or 0.1 wt%, and/or the upper endof the range can be<br>
-5<br><br>
modified to 5 wt%, 3 wt%, or 1.5 wt% in accordance with specific embodiments of the present invention. It is also noted that the alcohol is given herein without a range limitation, but in one embodiment, can be present at from 0.001 wt% to 95 wt%. This being stated, the lower end of the range of the alcohol can be modified to 0.05 wt% or 0.1 wt%, and the upper end of the range can be modified to 40 wt%, 30 wt%, 20 wt% or 10 wt% in accordance with specific embodiments of the present invention. Further, the concentration of the metal content, including ionic and/or colloidal content, can also be modified to 10 ppm by weight at the lower end of the range, and/or to 10,000 ppm, 5,000 ppm, or 1500 ppm by weight at the upper end" of the range. As these ranges are merely exemplary, one skilled in the art could modify these ranges for a particular application, considering such things as the type of alcohol (polyhydric, food grade, mixtures, etc.); the type of peroxygen (peroxide, peracid, combination of peroxide/peracid, etc.); and the type of metal (ionic, colloidal, alloy, etc.).<br>
In one embodiment, the disinfectant composition can include only ingredients that are food-grade or food safe. For example, though not required, the composition can be substantially free of disinfectant ingredients commonly present in many commercially available surface cleaners. Examples of non-food-grade Ingredients which can be omitted from the disinfectants of the present invention include, but are not limited to, aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde; chlorine-based disinfectants; chlorine and bromine-based disinfectants; iodophore-based disinfectants; phenolic-based disinfectants, quaternary ammonium-based disinfectants; and the like.<br>
The aqueous vehicle can optionally include other ingredients, such as organic co-solvents. In particular, certain alcohols can be present. For example, alcohols, including aliphatic alcohols and other carbon-containing alcohols, having from 1 to 24 carbons (C1-C24 alcohol) can be used. It is to be noted that "C1-C24 alcohol" does not necessarily imply only straight chain saturated aliphatic alcohols, as other carbon-containing alcohols can also be used within this definition, including branched aliphatic alcohols, alicyclic alcohols, aromatic alcohols, unsaturated alcohols, as well as substituted aliphatic, alicyclic, aromatic, and unsaturated alcohols, etc.  In one embodiment, the aliphatic alcohols can be C1 to C5 alcohols including methanol, ethanol, propanol and<br>
6<br><br>
isopropanol, butanols, and pentanols, due to their availability and lower boiling points. This being stated, polyhydric alcohols can also be used effectively in enhancing the disinfectant and sterilant potency of the compositions of the present invention, as well as provide some degree of added stabilization. Examples of polyhydric alcohols which can be used in the present invention include but are not limited to ethylene glycol (ethane-1,2-diol) glycerin (or glycerol, propane-1,2,3-triol), and propane-1,2-diol. Other non-aliphatic alcohols may also be used including but not limited to phenols and substituted phenols, erucyl alcohol, ricinolyl alcohol, arachidyl alcohol, capryl alcohol, capric alcohol, behenyl alcohol, lauryl alcohol (1-dodecanol), myristyl alcohol (1-tetradecanoI), cetyl (or palmityl) alcohol (1-hexadecanol), stearyl alcohol (1-octadecanol), isostearyi alcohol, oleyl alcohol (cis-9-octadecen-1-ol), palmitoleyl alcohol, linoleyl alcohol (9Z, 12Z-octadecadien-1-ol), elaidyl alcohol (9E-octadecen-1-ol), elaidolinoleyl alcohol (9E, 12E-octadecadien-1-ol), linolenyl alcohol (9Z, 12Z, 15Z-octadecatrien-t-ol), elaidolrnolenyl alcohol (9E, 12E, 15-E-octadecatrien-1-ol), combinations thereof, and the like.<br>
In some embodiments, for practical considerations, methanol, ethanot, and denatured alcohols (mixtures of ethanol and smaller amounts of methanol, and optionally, minute amounts of benzene, ketones, acetates, etc.) can often be preferred for use because of their availability and cost. Glycerol is also useable in some embodiments. If the desire is to provide a food grade composition, then alcohols can be selected that satisfy this requirement. When considering the amount of alcohol to use, one skilled in the art can stay within the above-described ranges, or modify these ranges for a particular application, considering such things as whether alcohol selected for use is polyhydric, whether the alcohol is food grade, mixtures of alcohols, etc.<br>
Regarding the transition metal, in accordance with the embodiments of the present invention, the metal can be in ionic form (e.g. disassociate metal salt, metal ions from elemental metal, etc.) and/or in colloidal form, fn one specific embodiment, the transition metal can be in a sub-micron form (i.e. dispersion of less than 1 urn metal colloidal particles). However, larger colloidal transition metal particles can also be used in certain applications. Typical transition metals that are desirable for use include Group VI to Group XI transition metals, and<br>
7<br><br>
more preferably, can include Group X to Group XI transition metals. Alloys including at least one metal from the Group VI to Group XI metals can also be used. It is recognized that any of these metals will typically be oxidized to the corresponding cation in the presence of a peroxygen. However, with colloidal metals, typically, the surface is usually more susceptible to such oxidation. Further, when colloidal metals are dispersed in a colloidal solution, there is often an amount of the metal in ionic or salt form that is also present in the suspension solution. For example, colloidal silver may include a certain percentage of silver salt or ionic silver in solution, e.g., 10% to 90% by weight of metal content can be ionic based on the total metal content. This being stated, certain preferred metals for use in accordance with embodiments of the present invention are ruthenium, rhodium, osmium, iridium, palladium, platinum, copper, gold, silver, alloys thereof, and mixtures thereof. Silver is often the most preferred, but metal choice can be dependent to some degree on the application, the levels of kill desired or required, the type of pathogen being targeted, the substrate that is being cleaned, etc.<br>
It is also noted that any of these embodiments can often also benefit from the use of alloys. For Example, certain combinations of metals in an alloy may provide an acceptable kill level for a specific pathogen, and also provide benefits that are related more to secondary consideration, such as solution stability, substrate to be cleaned, etc. Preferred examples of transition metal alloys for use in the present invention include but are not limited to copper-silver alloys, silver-manganese alloys, iron-copper alloys, chromium-silver alloys, gold-silver alloys, magnesium-silver alloys, and the like.<br>
Exemplary colloidal silvers that can be used include those sold by Solutions IE, Inc. under the trade names CS Plus and C S Ultra. Other colloidal silver products that can be used as the silver source include ASAP, Sovereign Silver, Silver Max, and the like. In one embodiment, the colloidal particles used in the present invention can.have a particle size range of from 0.001 urn to 1.0 µm. In another embodiment the colloidal transition metal particles can have a size range of from 0.030 pm to 0.5 µm. In still another embodiment the average particle size is 0.35 pm to 0.45 pm.  If used in ionic form, preferred silver salts include but are not limited to silver nitrate, silver acetate, silver citrate, stiver<br>
8<br><br>
oxide, and/or silver carbonate. Though many colloidal silver solutions or ionic silver solutions that are functional for use in the formulations of the present invention can be used, in one embodiment, it can be desirable to use RO water as the suspension medium for the colloidal and/or ionic silver that is mixed with the other ingredients. In a more detailed aspect, the RO water can also be distilled, resulting in 18-20 MQ water, though this is not required.<br>
The peroxygen component of the disinfectant solution can be a single compound or a combination of multiple peroxygen compounds or peroxygen forming compounds. In one embodiment, the peroxygen can be any aliphatic or aromatic peracid (or peroxyacid) that is functional for disinfectant purposes in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. While any functional peroxyacid can be used, peroxyacids containing from 1 to 7 carbons are the most practical for use. These peroxyacids can include, but not be limited to, peroxyformic acid, peroxyacetic acid, peroxyoxalic acid, peroxypropanoic acid, perlactic acid, peroxybutanoic acid, peroxypentanoic acid, peroxyhexanoic acid, peroxyadipic acid, peroxycitric, and/or peroxybenzoic acid. The peroxyacid used in the present invention can be prepared using any method known in the art. When the peroxyacid is prepared from an acid and hydrogen peroxide, the resultant mixture contains both the peroxyacid and the corresponding acid that it is prepared from. For example, in embodiments that utilize peroxyacetic acid, the presence of the related acid (acetic acid) provides stability to the mixture, as the reaction is an equilibrium between the acid, hydrogen peroxide, and the peroxyacid and water, as follows:<br>
H202 + CH3COOH	*-   CH3COO-OH   +   H2 O<br>
Peracid salts, such as salts of the above listed peracids, can also be included as the peroxygen component of the disinfectant solutions. Non-limiting examples of such salts include permanganates, perborates, perchlorates, peracetates, percarbonates, persulphates, and the like. The salts can be used alone or in combination with each other or other peroxygen compounds to form the peroxygen component of the invention.<br>
In another embodiment, the peroxygen component of the invention can include a peroxiqe compound. While hydrogen peroxide is considered to be a<br>
9<br><br>
desirable peroxide for use in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, other peroxides can also be used, such as metal peroxides and peroxyhydrates. The metal peroxides that can be used include, but are not limited to, sodium peroxide, magnesium peroxide, calcium peroxide, barium peroxide, and/or strontium peroxide. Other salts (for example sodium percarbonate) have hydrogen peroxide associated therewith much like waters of hydration, and these could also be considered to be a source of hydrogen peroxide, thereby producing hydrogen peroxide in situ. As mentioned above, the peroxides can be used alone or in combination with other peroxygen compounds to form the peroxygen component of the present invention.<br>
The disinfectant compositions of the present invention can be incorporated with other ingredients to form a variety of disinfectant products including but not limited to hand cleansers, mouthwashes, surgical scrubs, body splashes, hand sanitizer gels and foams, disinfectant wipes, and similar personal care products. Additional types of products include disinfectant foams, creams, mousses, and the like, and compositions containing organic and inorganic filler materials, such as emulsions, lotions, creams, pastes, and the like. The compositions further can be used as an antibacterial cleanser for hard surfaces, for example, in bathrooms, hospitals, sinks and countertops, food service areas, and meat processing plants. The disinfectant compositions can also be used as disinfectant fogs and disinfectant mists. The present antibacterial compositions can be manufactured as dilute ready-to-use compositions, or as concentrates that can be diluted prior to yse. The various products in which the disinfectants are used may also include fragrances, depending on the nature of the product. For example, a pine or lemon fragrance may be desirable for use for kitchen cleaning wipes because of their appealing association with cleanliness to many consumers. Further, gels or aerosols may also be fragranced for similar or other reasons.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the disinfectant compositions are used to make disinfectant wipes. The disinfectant wipes of the present invention can be used to clean a variety of hard and other surfaces, including human hands and skin, medical instruments, countertops, sinks, floors, walls, windows, etc. The wipes of the present invention can be made of a variety of<br>
10<br><br>
fabrics. For the purposes of the present invention, fabrics can include cloths and papers, as well as woven and non-woven materials. The woven, or nonwoven fabrics can be made of suitable materials such as rayon, nylon, or cotton, combinations thereof. Examples of nonwoven fabrics are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,786,615; 4,395,454; and 4,199,322; which are hereby incorporated by reference. The fabrics or papers can be impregnated with the disinfectant solution by any method known in the art. The wipes can be packaged in any manner known in the art including individual blister-packs or wrapped or stacked multi-packs.<br>
In another embodiment, the disinfectant composition of the present invention is formulated into a gel or gelatinous sanitation composition. In addition to the disinfectant compositions, the gel sanitizers of the present invention can include a thickening or gelling agent, wherein "thickening agent" and "gelling agent" are used interchangeably. For the purposes of the present invention, the terms "gel" or "gelatinous" sanitization compositions refers to a disinfectant liquid substances that can have a viscosity from about 1,000 centipoise to about 100,000 centipoise, or from 2,000 centipoise to 50,000 centipoise in another embodiment, though these ranges are not intended to be limiting. For example, a hand gel may be considerably less viscous than a gel used for industrial cleaning or disinfectant purposes. Examples of gelling or thickening agents include but are not limited to natural gum such as guar and guar derivatives, a synthetic polymer, a clay, an oil, a wax, aloe vera gel, an acrylate homopolymer, an acrylate copolymer, a carbomer, cellulose, a cellulose derivative, algin, an algin derivative, a water-insoluble C8-C2Oalcohol, carrageenan, fumed silica, mixtures thereof, and the like. The gelling agent can be present in the gelatinous sanitation composition in an amount from about 0.1 wt% to 50 wt% of the gelatinous composition. In another embodiment, the gelling agent is present in an amount from 0.25 wt% to 10 wt% of the gelatinous composition. The amount of gelling agent can be dependent on a variety of factors including the type of gelling agent and the desired viscosity of the gel. The gelatinous sanitizers can be used for a variety of applications including sanitization of human skin e.g., gel hand sanittzer, and hard surface sanitation. In one particular embodiment, the disinfectant composition can be mixed with<br>
11<br><br>
natural aloe gel to form a disinfectant aloe formulation. Such a formulation would be useful for application to burns, skin infections, and other irritations. The aloe may act as a thickening agent, or may also include another thickening or gelling agent as described above, depending on the desired viscosity of the disinfectant gel.<br>
In another embodiment, the disinfectant composition of the present invention can be formulated into a disinfectant foam or foaming composition. The disinfectant foams or foaming compositions include the disinfectant composition and foaming agents. Any foaming agent known in the art can be used depending on the desired application and characteristics of the resulting disinfectant foam. As with the disinfectant composition, the disinfectant foams of the present invention can be used in both human (e.g. hand washing) and industrial applications.<br>
In another embodiment, the disinfectant composition of the present invention can be in the form of a disinfectant aerosol or fog. Fogging, also referred to as thermal fogging, is the process by which disinfectants are aerosolized. The aerosol particles of the disinfectant are suspended within the air for a period of time in order to disinfect both the air itself and surfaces, including inaccessible parts of a structure such as air vents. The aerosolized particles of disinfectant can have a particle size of from about 5µm to about 200 µm. In another embodiment, the aerosolized particle can have a particle size of from about 20 urn to about 150 µm. When the aerosolized disinfectant contains a colloidal transition metal, the aerosolized particles are typically of sufficient size to contain at least 1 of the colloidal transition metals, though typically, each aerosolized particle will contain multiple colloidal transition metal particles.<br>
Fogging is often a last stage of a complete biosecurity program, and as such, can have a major part to play in disease prevention and control. Traditional fogging agents such as formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, or glutaraldehyde can pose major health and safety issues to persons who come in contact with the disinfectant. As the disinfectants of the present invention can be formulated to use only food-grade ingredients, their use in disinfectant fogging is of great value. Most fogging machines work by using high volumes of air under great pressure to generate small droplets. The disinfectants compositions of the<br>
12<br><br>
present invention are compatible with most standard fogging machines. Examples of suitable fogging machines include Dyna-Fog's® Thermal Foggers and Cold Foggers.<br>
As a solution, the composition can be used as a liquid dispersion bath for objects such as instruments or as a spray for applying to less mobile objects. The disinfectant solution can also be used as a topical dressing or a mouthwash. In other words, any application method known by those skilled in the art can be utilized in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.<br>
The disinfectant compositions of the present invention can be prepared for application by any of a number of methods.   For example, the composition can be prepared as a solution, gel, foam, fog, etc. As a solution, the composition can be used as a liquid dispersion bath for dipping instruments or other objects, as a spray for applying to less mobile objects, as a wipe where the liquid dispersion is applied to a fabric or fabric-like material for easy application without the need for spray or other application methods, as a topical dressing, as a mouthwash, etc. In other words, any application method known by those skilled in the art can be utilized in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Additionally, though the compositions of the present invention are described generally as disinfectants, sterilants, or sanitizers, it is recognized that there are many possible applications. For example, without limitation, the compositions of the present invention can be used to kill bacteria, spores, viruses, parasites, funguses, and molds. As described, this composition can be used against all of these types of organisms with relative to complete safety to humans and other mammals.<br>
Because these compositions can be formulated to be very safe, e.g., often including only food grade components, these compositions can be used in areas which extend well beyond their use as hard surface disinfectants. Such product categories include both topically and internally applied products for both humans and animals. For exampfe, these compositions can be used for antiseptics, bum treatments, diaper rash products, and various skin care products. Alternatively, these compositions can be used inside the mouth, such as for mouthwashes, toothpastes, and various other disinfecting solutions that are be employed in dental mold materials. As dental molds are known to spread significant disease<br>
13<br><br>
in the dental industry, such use with dental molds can prevent or reduce-the spread of pathogens from a patient's mouth to lab employees working with the finished molds. Still a further category of use includes application for antibiotic and antiviral purposes. These compositions can be formulated into lozenges or gums for application to the mouth and throat, and can even be administered orally, intramuscularly, intravenously, etc. Because of the kill levels that can be achieved, even when formulated with only food grade components, a wide range of pathogens, as well as some viruses, can be killed internally. Without being 'bound by any particular possibility, these compositions can be useful in killing various viruses such as HIV, SARS, West Nile, Bird Flu, and others.<br>

Example 10 - Kill-time studies of Staphylococcus aureus using disinfectant of Example 1<br>
A study was conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of the colloidal silver-containing disinfectant of Example 1, when challenged with an organic load, on the test organism Staphylococcus aureus. This was accomplished by performing a standard suspension test on the disinfectant containing 5% v/v horse serum. A 15 second contact time was evaluated.<br>
Specifically, the test suspension was prepared by growing a 5 ml culture of Staphylococcus aureus, ATCC 6538, in Todd Hewitt Broth at 37°C, for 20 hours. Five (5) ml of culture was pelleted by centrifugation, washed with 5 ml sterile 18 MCI water, centrifuged again, and resuspended in a final volume of 5 ml sterile water.<br>
A neutralizer was prepared that consisted of 9 ml tubes of 12.7 wt% Tween 80 (surfactant), 6.0 wt% Tamol, 1.7 wt% lecithin, 1 wt% peptone, and 0.1 wt% cystine, to which was added 10 pd of catalase solution (Sigma, C100, 42,300 units/mg).<br>
The "Kill Time" procedure followed was as follows: A 9.9 ml aliquot of the disinfectant of Example 1 (containing 5% v/v horse serum) was placed in a sterile 20 mm x 150 mm tube, and the tube was equilibrated in a 20°C water bath. The tube of disinfectant was inoculated with 100 pi of the test organism suspension at time zero. After 15 seconds, 1 ml of the organism/disinfectant suspension was removed to 9 ml of neutralizer. After 2 minutes, the neutralized suspension was serially diluted (1:1x10, 1:1x102, 1:1x103, etc.) in physiological saline solution (PSS). The number of viable organisms in selected dilution tubes was assayed by membrane filtration. One (1) ml aliquots were plated in duplicate, and the membranes were washed with about 100 ml of sterile PSS and removed to Columbia agar plates. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 20 hours. The number of colonies on each filter was counted and log reduction and percent kill values were computed.<br>
17<br><br>
As a control, a titer (or measurement of the amount or concentration of a substance in a solution) of the test suspension was computed by performing membrane filtration assays of selected 1:10 dilutions of the test suspension in PSS. A neutralizer control was performed by inoculating a mixture of 9 ml of neutralizer and 1 ml of disinfectant with 100 µl of the 1:105 dilution of the titer. This produced about 1,500 CFU/ml in the tube, which was allowed to stand for 20 minutes prior to dilution and assay of the tubes by membrane filtration using duplicate 1 ml samples. Sterilization controls were performed by filtering 100 ml (PSS) or 1 ml (other fluids) samples of each solution used in this testing. Plates were incubated as above.<br>

produced an initial concentration of 1x10° organisms per ml in the assay tube. Results from these procedures allowed log reduction (LR) and percent kill (PK) values to be calculated using the formulas: 1) LR = -Log(S/So) where S = concentration of viable organisms after 45 minutes; and So = the initial concentration of viable organisms at time zero; and 2) PK = (1 - (S/So)) x 100. These values are shown below.<br>

The neutralization control data indicated that the test solution was adequately neutralized. Observed counts were slightly greater than those expected, indicating no residual killing took place due to un-neutralized disinfectant. In general, the disinfectant solution tested here had high antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. It is significant to note that this level of activity was achieved even though the disinfectant was premixed with an organic load consisting of 5 % v/v horse serum. An organic load (such as 5% v/v horse serum) will often adversely affect the antimicrobial action of disinfectants. The solution of Example 1 was nevertheless able to effect greater than a 7 log reduction of viable organisms within 15 seconds, even in the presence of 5% v/v horse serum.<br>
Example 11 - Kill-time studies of Bacillus subtilis using disinfectant of Example 6<br>
A study was conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of the colloidal silver-containing disinfectant of Example 6, on bacterial endospores from the test organism Bacillus subtilis. This was accomplished by performing a standard kill-time suspension test using a suspension of B. subtilis endospores.<br>
Specifically, the test suspension containing endospores from B. subtilis was prepared from a culture grown for three days at 37°C in Leighton-Doi medium. The suspension was placed at 65 °C for 30 minutes to kill vegetative<br>
19<br><br>
organisms, and then centrifuged to pellet the spores. Spores were resuspended in sterile HPLC water and allowed to set overnight at 4 °C. This washing/setting process was repeated a total of three times. The final spore suspension was examined for purity using phase-contrast microscopy and stored at 4 °C until it was used.<br>
A neutralizer was prepared that consisted of 9 ml tubes of 12.7 wt% Tween 80 (surfactant), 6.0 wt% Tamol, 1.7 wt% lecithin, 1 wt% peptone, and 1.0 wt% cystine and 500 mM Tris (pH 7.85), to which 100 µl of catalase solution (Sigma C100, 42,300/mg) was added immediately before use.<br>
The "Kill Time" procedure followed was as follows: A 9.9 ml aliquot of the disinfectant of Example 6 (containing 5% v/v horse serum) was placed in a sterile 50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tube, and the tube was equilibrated in a 20°C water bath. The tube of disinfectant was inoculated with 100µl of the spore/disinfectant suspension at time zero. After 60 seconds, 1 ml of the spore/disinfectant suspension was removed to 9.1 ml of neutralizer. After 2 minutes, the neutralized suspension was serially diluted (1:1x10, 1:1x102, 1 :lx103, etc.) in physiological saline solution (PSS). The number of viable spores In selected dilution tubes was assayed by membrane filtration. One (1) ml aliquots were plated in duplicate, and the membranes were washed with about 100 ml of sterile PSS and removed to Columbia agar plates. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 20 hours. The number of colonies on each filter was counted and log reduction and percent kill values were computed.<br>
As a control, a titer (or measurement of the amount or concentration of a substance in a solution) of the test suspension was computed by performing membrane filtration assays of selected 1:10 dilutions of the test suspension in PSS. A neutralizer control was performed by inoculating a mixture of 9.1 ml of neutralizer and 1 ml of disinfectant with 100 µl of the 1:10s dilution of the titer This produced about 96 CFU/ml in the tube, which was allowed to stand for 20 minutes prior to dilution and assay of the tubes by membrane filtration using duplicate 1 ml samples. Sterilization controls were performed by filtering 100 ml (PSS) or 1 ml (other fluids) samples of each solution used in this testing. Plates were incubated as above.<br>

The neutralization control data indicated that the test solution was adequately neutralized. Observed counts were similar to, or higher than those expected, indicating no residual killing took place due to un-neutralized disinfectant. The disinfectant solution of Example 6 had good sporicidai activity, effecting a 1.38 log reduction within 3 minutes and greater than 7 log reduction in 10 minutes. It is worth noting that B. subtilis is a common species used in sporacidai testing and belongs to the same genus as the organism that causes anthrax. Because of their similarities, B. subtilis spores have been used as non¬pathogenic surrogates for spores of Bacillus anthracis.<br>
Example 12 -Kill-time studies of Mycobacterium bovis using the disinfectant solution of Example 5<br>
A study was conducted to determine tubercuiocidal activity of the disinfectant solution of Example 5 on a hard surface using the CRA Environmental Wipe Method. This method is fully described in: Christensen, R.P., R.A. Robison, D.F. Robinson, B.J. Ploeger, R.W. Leavitt, and H.L. bodily, Antimicrobial Activity of Environmental Surface Disinfecants in the Absence and Presence of Bioburden. Journal of the American Dental Association, 119:493-505. 1989.<br>
22<br><br>
Specifically, a test suspension containing Mycobacterium bovis (ATCC # 35743) was prepared from a frozen suspension of a standardized culture grown in modified Proskauer-Beck medium. The suspension was thawed and mixed with an equal volume of phosphate-buffered gelatin solution in a Teflon-on-glass tissue grinder on ice. The suspension was homogenized for two minutes, then diluted 1:4 in physiological saline solution (PSS) containing 0.1% Tween 80. The suspension was vortexed and held on ice until used in inoculate the test surface.<br>
A neutralizer mixture consisted of 50 ml flasks of Tryptic soy broth containing 1.0% Tween 80,1.0% lecithin, and 50 pi of concentrated catalase solution (Sigma, C100, 42,300 units/mg).<br>
The CRA environmental Wipe Method which was used is detailed below. An 8 x 12 inch piece of laminated plastic counter covering was secured to polypropylene dental trays (size B, Zirc Dental) with silicone adhesive. Lids and trays were sterilized by a hydrogen peroxide gas plasma sterilizer. Two ml of test organism suspension was applied to the surface with a sterile2 x 2-in cotton-filled gauze sponge. The surface was allowed to dry 20-30 minutes in a biosafety cabinet under laminar flow. Then 3.5 ml of disinfectant (or water) was applied to a sterile gauze sponge, which was used to wipe the inoculated test surface for 10 seconds using about 150-g pressure with overlapping strokes (20 left to right, followed by 20 top to bottom). After 3 minutes, the trays were flooded with 50 ml of neutralizer and scrubbed for 1 minute with a sterile polypropylene brush to remove and suspend organisms. The fluid was collected and serially diluted 1:10 in physiological saline solution (PSS). The number of viable organisms in selected dilution tubes was assayed by membrane filtration. One ml aliquots were plated in duplicate. The membranes were washed with about 100 ml of sterile PSS and removed to Mycobacteria 7H11 agar plates. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for about three weeks. The number of colonies on each was counted and log reduction and percent kill values were computed.<br>
As a control, a titer of the test suspension was computed by performing membrane filtration assays of selected 1:10 dilutions of the test suspension in PSS. A neutralizer control was performed by inoculating a mixture of 9 ml of neutralizer and 1 ml of disinfectant with 100 µl of the 1:103 dilution of the titer containing 1750 CFU. This produced 175 CFU/ml in the tube, which was allowed<br>

Results of the titer showed the initial concentration of M. bovis was 1.75 x 107 CFU per ml in the prepared suspension. Inoculation of the test surface following drying produced a challenge exhibited by the water control. The initial concentration of viable bacilli on the test surface (So) was 2.63 x 105. Results from these procedures allowed log reduction (LR) and percent kill (PK) values to be calculated using the formulas: 1) LR = -Log(S/So) where S = concentration of viable organisms after a period of exposure to the disinfectant; and So = the initial concentration of viable organisms at time zero; These values are shown in the Table 20 below.<br>

Example 13 -Kill-time studies of sporicidaf activity using various disinfectant solutions<br>
A study was conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of the silver-containing disinfectant of Example 5 on bacterial endospores from the test organism Bacillus sub Wis. This was accomplished by performing a standard kill-time suspension test using a suspension of B. subtifis endospores. In general, spores are much more difficult to kill than common bacteria.<br>
The test suspension containing endospores from Bacillus subtilis (ATCC # 19659) was prepared'from a culture grown for three days at 37 °C in Leighton-Doi medium. The suspension was placed at 65 °C for 30 minutes to kill vegetative organisms, then centrifuged to pellet the spores. Spores were resuspended in sterile HPLC water and allowed to set overnight at 4 °C. This washing/setting process was repeated a total of three times. The final spore suspension was examined for purity using phase-contrast microscopy and stored at 4 °C until used.<br>

A neutralizer solution was also prepared that consisted of 9 ml tubes of 12.7 wt% Tween 80, 6.0 wt% Tamol, 1.7 wt% lecithin, 1 wt% peptone, and 1.0 wt% cystine, and 500 mM tris (pH 7.85), to which 100 µl of catalase solution (Sigma, C100, 42,300 units/mg) was added immediately before use.<br>
The "kill time" procedure was as follows: A 9.9 ml aliquot of the disinfectant was placed in a 50 ml polypropylene sterile centrifuge tube. The tube was equilibrated in a 20°C water bath. The tube of disinfectant was inoculated with 100 ul of the spore suspension at time zero. After a 30 second contact time, one ml of spore/disinfectant suspension was removed to 9.1 ml of neutralizer. The tubes were mixed thoroughly. After 2 minutes, the neutralized suspension was serially diluted 1:10, in physiological saline solution in physiological saline solution (PSS). The number of viable spores in selected dilution tubes was assayed by membrane filtration. One (1) ml aliquots were plated in duplicate. The membranes were washed with about 100 ml of sterile PSS and removed to Columbia agar plates. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 20 hours.

Neutralization control data revealed that the neutralizer was able to adequately neutralize this disinfectant. Observed counts were consistently higher than those expected. Each of the test disinfectant solutions (Examples 5 and 7) had rapid and potent sporicidal activity. Specifically, each of Examples 5 and 7 was able to achieve greater than 7-log reduction within 30 seconds. As a control, the same culture was tested using the same concentration of peracetic acid with none of the other active ingredients (i.e. without the alcohol or silver content). The compositions of Examples 5 and 7 exhibited a greater kill level by several orders of magnitude.<br>
Example 14 - Kill-time studies of sporicidal activity using 2.4% alkaline glutaraldehyde disinfectant<br>
For comparison purposes, a study was conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of a 2.4% alkaline glutaraldehyde disinfectant on bacterial endospores from the test organism Bacillus subtilis, Glutaraldehyde disinfectant solution is a common disinfectant used in hospitals to kilt bacteria and other pathogens that might otherwise be difficult to kill. This study was earned out by performing a standard kill-time suspension test using a suspension of B. subtilis endospores. A 15 minute contact time was evaluated.<br>
A test suspension containing endospores from Bacillus subtilis (ATCC # 19659) was prepared from a culture grown on Nutrient agar, to which additional sporutation enhancements were added. Plates were harvested with sterile water and endospores were purified by repeated centrifugations and resuspensions in water. The final wash was in 70 wt% ethanol for 30 minutes, to ensure the death of all vegetative bacteria. The spores were resuspended in water containing 0.1 wt% Tween 80 to prevent clumping and stored at 4°C until used.<br>
A neutralizer was prepared that consisted of 1 ml of freshly made, filter-sterilized sodium bisulfite solution at 5.28 wt%.<br>
The "kill time" procedure was as follows: A 9.9 ml aliquot of the disinfectant was placed in a sterile glass culture tube. The tube was equilibrated in a 20°C water bath. The tube of disinfectant, 9 m! of 2.4 wt% alkaline glutaraldehyde (Freshly activated CIDEXPLUS, 3.4 %, Lot #:2002247TP - diluted to 2.4 wt% with sterile water), was inoculated with 100 µl of the test organism<br>
29<br><br>
suspension at time zero. After 15 min, 1ml or spore/disinfectant suspension was removed to 9 ml of neutralizer. The tube was mixed thoroughly. After 2 minutes, the neutralized suspension was serially diluted (1:1x10,1:1x102, 1:1x103 etc.) in physiological saline solution (PSS). The number of viable spores in selected dilution tubes was assayed by membrane filtration. One (1) ml aliquots were plated in duplicate. The membranes were washed with about 100 ml of sterile PSS and removed to Columbia agar plates. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 20 hours. The number of colonies on each filter was counted and log reduction and percent kill values were computed.<br>
As a control, a titer of the test suspension was computed by performing membrane filtration assays on selected 1:10 dilutions in PSS of the test suspension.<br>
A neutralizer control was performed by inoculating a mixture of 1 ml of neutralizer and 1 ml of disinfectant with 100 ul of the 1:1x105 dilution of the titer. This produced about 450 CFU/ml in the tube, which was allowed to stand for 20 minutes prior to dilution and assay by membrane filtration using duplicate 1 ml samples.<br>

Sterilization controls indicated zero growth for the giutaraldehyde, sodium bisulfite, water, PSS, and Columbia agar. Results of the titer showed a viable B. subtilis spore concentration of 9.45 x 108 spores per ml in the original suspension. Inoculation of 9.9 ml of disinfectant with 100 µl of this suspension produced an initial concentration of 9.45 x 106 spores per ml in the assay tube. Results from these procedures allowed log reduction (LR) and percent kill (PK) values to be calculated using the formulas: 1) LR = 'Log(S/So) where S = concentration of viable organisms after 1 hour, and So = the initial concentration of viable organisms at time zero; and 2) PK = (1 - (S/So)) x 100. These values are shown below in Table 26.<br>

Neutralization control data revealed that the neutralizer was able to<br>
adequately neutralize this disinfectant Observed counts were greater than those<br>
expected. The 2.4 wt% alkaline giutaraldehyde solution tested had relatively<br>
slow sporicidal activity, producing only a 0.48 log-reduction in 15 minutes, which<br>

Wipe Method. This method is fully described in: unnstensen. R.P., R.A. Robison, D.F. Robinson, B.J. Ploeger, R.W. Leavitt, and H.L. bodily, Antimicrobial Activity of Environmental Surface Disinfecants in the Absence and Presence of Bioburden. Journal of the American Dental Association, 119:493-505. 1989.<br>
Specifically, a test suspension containing Mycobacterium bovis (ATCC # 35743) was prepared from a frozen suspension of a standardized culture grown in modified Proskauer-Beck medium. The suspension was thawed and mixed with an equal volume of phosphate-buffered gelatin solution in a Teflon-on-glass tissue grinder on ice. The suspension was homogenized for two minutes, then diluted 1:4 in physiological saline solution (PSS) containing 0.1% Tween 80. The suspension was vortexed and held on ice until used in inoculate the test surface.<br>
A neutrallzer mixture consisted of 50 ml flasks of Tryptic soy broth containing 1.0% Tween 80, 1.0% lecithin, and 50 pi of concentrated catalase solution (Sigma, C100,42,300 units/mg).<br>
The CRA environmental Wipe Method which was used is detailed below. An 8 x 12 inch piece of laminated plastic counter covering was secured to polypropylene dental trays (size B, Zirc Dental) with silicone adhesive. Lids and trays were sterilized by a hydrogen peroxide gas plasma sterilizer. Two ml of test organism suspension was applied to the surface with a sterile2 x 2-in cotton-filled gauze sponge. The surface was allowed to dry 20-30 minutes in a biosafety cabinet under laminar flow. Then 3.5 ml of disinfectant (or water) was applied to a sterile gauze sponge, which was used to wipe the inoculated test surface for 10 seconds using about 150-g pressure with overlapping strokes (20 left to right, followed by 20 top to bottom). After 3 minutes, the trays were flooded with 50 ml of neutralizer and scrubbed for 1 minute with a sterile polypropylene brush to remove and suspend organisms. The fluid was collected and serially diluted 1:10 in physiological saline solution (PSS). The number of viable organisms in selected dilution tubes was assayed by membrane filtration. One ml aliquots were plated in duplicate. The membranes were washed with about 100 ml of sterile PSS and removed to Mycobacteria 7H11 agar plates. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for about three weeks. The number of colonies on each was counted and log reduction and percent kill values were computed.<br>
32<br><br>
As a control, a titer of the test suspension was computed by performing membrane filtration assays of selected 1:10 dilutions of the test suspension in PSS. A neutralizer control was performed by inoculating a mixture of 9 ml of neutralizer and 1 ml of disinfectant with 100 pi of the 1.103 dilution of the titer containing 1750 CFU. This produced 175 CFU/ml in the tube, which was allowed to stand for 20 minutes prior to dilution and assay of the tubes by membrane filtration using duplicate 1 ml samples.<br>

The neutralization control data indicated that each test solution was adequately neutralized. Observed counts were similar to those expected from the titer data.<br>
Example 16 - Kill-rate Enhancement Using Certain Alloys<br>
To demonstrate the effectiveness of certain alloys in enhancing the kill rate of B. Subtilis bacteria, a composition comprising 0.5% by weight of hydrogen peroxide, 8% by weight ethanol, and the balance of water containing 300 ppm of a colloidal silver was prepared. A similar composition was prepared using identical components except that aqueous solution contained a silver alloy admixture with manganese (approximately 300 ppm silver and about 7 ppm manganese). A kill test was performed resulting in a 0.13 log reduction or a 25.6% kill rate of the B. subtilis after 30 seconds using the colloidal silver composition- The kill study was also performed using the colloidal silver-<br>
34<br><br>
manganese alloy composition, whicn resuited in a u.24 log reduction or 42.6% kill after 30 seconds.<br>
Example 17 - Disinfectant Mouthwash<br>
A disinfectant mouthwash (oral rinse) is made using the disinfectant composition described in one of Examples 1 to 9. The mouthwash is made by combining the disinfectant composition with sorbitol (sweetener), sodium fluoride (fluoride ion component) in an amount sufficient to provide 250 ppm of the fluoride ion, and mint oil (flavoring). The ingredients are mixed with the disinfectant composition of one of the Examples diluted by about 1:10 by weight with water. It is noted that by diluting the total composition at a 1:10 by weight with water, the colloidal silver content is significantly reduced. If the desire is to have higher weight percentages of colloidal silver, the silver content can be formulated to be higher than that in Examples 1 to 9, so that when the mouthwash is diluted, a higher silver content will be present in the solution.<br>
Example 18 - Disinfectant Toothpaste<br>
A disinfectant toothpaste is made using the disinfectant composition of one of Examples 1 to 9. The toothpaste is made by mixing the disinfectant composition with the water, hydrated silica, sorbitol, glycerin, sodium lauryl sulfate, titanium dioxide, menthol, pentasodium triphosphate, and PEG-6. The ingredients are mixed together in amounts sufficient to yield a paste with disinfectant properties. Again, it is noted that by diluting the total composition with paste-forming and other ingredients, the ionic silver content is significantly reduced. If the desire is to have higher weight percentages of silver, the silver content can be formulated to be higher than that in the composition examples above, so that when the toothpaste is formulated, a higher silver content will be present in the paste.<br>
Example 19 - Disinfectant Ointment<br>
. A disinfectant ointment is prepared using the disinfectant solution of one of Example 1 to 9. The disinfectant is mixed with aloe vera gel forming a disinfectant ointment. The gel is then applied to an infection on the skin of a<br>
35<br><br>
subject. The disinfectant ointment disinfects the skin and provides some relief from the irritation of the infection.<br>
Example 20 - Disinfectant Soap or Shampoo<br>
A disinfectant liquid soap is prepared using the disinfectant solution of one of Examples 1 to 9. The disinfectant is mixed with water, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium sulfate, cocamidopropyl betaine, citric acid, sodium chloride, fragrance, DMDM hydantoin, and tetrasodium EDTA yielding a disinfectant liquid soap or shampoo. The soap or shampoo has a viscosity allowing it to be readily dispensed using traditional pump dispensers. Hard hand soaps can similarly be prepared by using the disinfectant as one of the ingredients for use in tine soap forming process.<br>
Example 21 - Disinfectant Wipe<br>
A disinfectant wipe is prepared using the disinfectant solution of one of Examples 1 to 9. A nonwoven cotton fabric is impregnated with the disinfectant solution. The wipes are prepared by placing a stack cotton fabric sheets in a container, saturating the fabric sheets with the disinfectant solution, and placing a cover over the container and sealing the container against evaporation of the disinfectant solution. If the disinfectant solution includes colloidal metal, care is taken to make sure that each and every piece of nonwoven cotton fabric is exposed to not only the liquid, but to the solid particles as well.<br>
Example 22 - Disinfectant Gel<br>
A disinfectant gel is prepared using the disinfectant solution of one of Examples 1 to 9. The disinfectant is mixed with aloe vera gel forming a disinfectant gel. The gel is then applied to an infection on the skin of a subject. The disinfectant gel disinfects the skin and provides some relief from the irritation of the infection.<br>
Example 23 - Disinfectant Aerosol and/or or Fog<br>
The disinfectant composition of one of Examples 1 to 9 is used to form a disinfectant fog. Using a thermal fogger from Dyno-Fog® the disinfectant<br>
36<br><br>
composition is aerosolized into small aropieis in a room in need of sterilization, e.g., a hospital room. The disinfectant fog is allowed to fill the room.
