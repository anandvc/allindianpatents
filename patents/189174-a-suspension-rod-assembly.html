				<td>The present patent application is a divisional out of  Indian<br>
patent application No. 1246/DEI/91 dated 18.12.1991<br>
The present invention relatcu to rx suKpension rodasembly for an <br>
appliance, in particular, a method and apparatus to improve motion damping on a hung suspension system. The invention is particularly advantageous when used in an automatic washer.    :<br>
A tub suspension system of the present invention includes a compact, easily assembled and reliable spring-mass-dampener system for suspending a floating base, on which a rotatable basket or clothes  container  of  a  clothes  washing  machine  is  mounted, supported  from  a  cabinet  in  a  manner  to  prevent  vibratioq transference to the cabinet during normal operation of the machine and particularly as the basket  is rapidly rotated during an extracting or centrifuging operation.  Such a suspension system is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,744,746 to Weir et al., in U.S. Patent No. 4,625,529 to Anderson and also in co-pending application Serial No. 532,315.<br>
The suspension system has a plurality of angularly spaced apart suspension assemblies interconnecting the tub 'floating ba.se to the cabinet.   Each of the assemblies comprises a rod with one end of each rod being resiliently connected by a coiled spring to the floating base.  The coiled spring surrounds each hanger rod below the base, and transfers the weight of the base and components supported therefrom to the rod.  Relative sliding movement of each rods in an axial direction is retarded or dampened by friction bushings, in this case a lower suspension ball or "collet" fitted<br>
over the rods above the spring and under the base, thereby to complete the apring-mass-dampener system.<br>
The elimination of excessive vibrations in automatic washing, rinsing and drying machines for homo uso has been an aron of continuing development. Excessive vibrations usually occur where there is a non-uniform distribution of clothes in a rotating clothes container or basket as the same spins rapidly to centrifuge excess water from the clothes. While a high rate of spin is desirable during the centrifuging operation, the maximum rate of spin is limited by the capabilities of the tub suspension system to isolate the machine cabinet from the vibrations or oscillatory motion caused by the unbalanced load. A complex suspension system may permit a high rate of spin, however, in order to maintain the cont of the laundry appliance within tho roach of most consumers, the suspension system should also be compact, inexpensive and<br>
easily assembled.<br>
Most state of the art hung suspension systems use a lower suspension ball that is partially split in half allowing it to grip the suspension rod at the ball's top end only. This system uses a lubricant (grease) between the rod and ball surfaces. The lubricant reduces ball wear and frictional noise. Therefore, frictional damping is limited by tho Small contact area of the ball to rod and the lubricant.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a hung suspension system for an appliance, in particular, to an improved lower suspension ball or collet which acts as a friction bushing or dampener to the mass-spring-dampener arrangement of the hung suspension.<br>
The lower suspension ball interfits into a domed shape lug, itself mounted to a floating suspension which supports the rotating or vibrating mass, such as the. laundry tub of a washing machine. The suspension ball provides a channel therethrough which surrounds and grips a suspension rod. The cunpennion rod is mounted at an elevated end to the frame of the appliance, and at a lower end below the suspension ball the suspension rod holds an end cap. A spring is arranged between the end cap upwardly abutting the suspension ball. Because the suspension ball is at least partially split, the spring exerts a force in an axial direction on the ball, squeezes the suspension ball proportionally and influences the gripping force of the suspension ball which surrounds the suspension rod. Thus, because the gripping force against the rod is variable, the frictional force on the rod passing through the suspension ball is correspondingly varied. The net result of this phenomenon is that the suspension ball , as so designed, acts as a frictional damper to vibration and movement of the suspension rod moving axially reciprocally through the suspension ball.<br>
The disclosed improved design uses a suspension ball that is substantially, but not fully, axially split in half in a first plane. The split occurring in an upper and central portion and leaving intact a lower end portion. The ball is also partially, but not fully, axially split in half in a second plane rotated 90Â° from the first plane. The split occurrs in at least the lower portion and, preferably, also in the central portion. With the ball split in the described manner, there is improved frictional contact area between the full length of the ball and rod, therefore increasing the damping effect and wear surface.<br>
rod would be able to twist back and forth in the ball, i.e., some play would exist, and some actual wear would need to take place before astable and effective fit was created. This, however, would not occur until a significant part of the machine life had passed.<br>
This invention creates an effective and easily manufactured suspension ball, with a long useful life, and also improves suspension performance by damping the excursion of the wash tub or oscillating mass when the mass accelerates through critical vibration speeds.<br>
The present invention relates to suspension rod assembly for washing machines for hanging a base from a frame arranged above the base, the base having base portions for engaging the assembly, comprising: a rod mounted to said frame at a first end and terminating in a free second end located below the base; a collet having:<br>
a first inclined shoulder portion and a second inclined shoulder portion, facing toward each other in a spaced apart posture separated by a gap, said first shoulder portion providing a first surface facing said base portion, and said second shoulder portion providing a second surface facing said base portion and said base portion providing a third surface abutting said first and second surfaces, said first and second surface inclined toward each other such that force from said third surface upon said first and second surfaces squeezes said first shoulder portion and said second shoulder portion together, said rod piercing said collet through said channel, said base portion overlying, and supported by said collet;<br>
a tube portion having an axial channel for insertion of said rod therethrough, said tube portion arranged between and connecting said first should portion to said second shoulder portion at a first end of said tube portion, said tube portion split along its axis with- a first slot, said first slot open to said gap, said first slot<br>
rod would be able to twist back and forth in the ball, i.e., some play would exist, and some actual wear would need to take place before a table and effective fit was created. This, however, would not occur until a significant part of the machine life had passed.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Fig. 1 shows a washing machine generally at 10 comprising a cabinet 14 holding therein a wash tub 20 which holds coaxially<br>
therein a clothes basket 26 having holes 27 for passing water. In the clothes basket 26 is mounted a vertical axis agitator 28. The: clothes basket 26 and the agitator 28 are selectively driven by an electric motor arrangement 29 which includes the necessary transmission, belt drives, and controls as is known in the prior art. The washing machine has a door 30 for placing the clothes in the clothes basket as well as controls 32 for selecting wash parameters. The wash tub 20 is supported via a plurality of suspension strut assemblies 34 which hang the wash tub from the cabinet 14.<br>
FIG. 2 shows the wash tub 20 supported off a floating frame 35 which also supports the motor arrangement 29 hanging therefrom. The clothes basket 26 is supported from the wash tub 20 in a rotatable fashion (not shown). The floating frame 35 provider, a plurality of nockcts 36 extending outwardly of the- wash tub 20 for engagement with the plurality of the suspension strut assemblies 34 to support the wash tub, motor assembly 29 and the clothes basket 26. Each suspension strut assembly 34 is supported by the cabinet 14 through the use of dished strut brackets 40, which can be positioned at each top corner 41 where the washing machine cabinet 14 is structurally strong.<br>
The suspension strut assembly 34 comprir.or; an upper ball support 44 which resides inside the dished strut bracket 40. The upper ball support 44 penetrates downwardly through a bottom hole 40a of each bracket 40 with an annular gap 45 surrounding a downward protruding portion 44a of the upper ball support. A rod 46 passes through the ball support 44 and proceeds downwardly through the socket 36 and terminates at an end cap 56. Between the end cap 56<br>
and the socket 36 a suspension spring 5-1 is installed, relatively coaxially a round tho rod 46.<br>
FIG. 3 shows the suspension strut assembly 34 in more detail. The suspension rod 46 has opposite turned ends 46a, 46b which prevent the upper ball support 44 and the end cap 56 from being removed from the suspension rod 46.<br>
The suspension rod 46 extends downwardly from the first turned end 46a, through the upper ball support 44, and to the socket 36. Inside the socket 36 resides a split suspension ball or collet 64 which cinbodicr, tho pror.ont invent ion. The collet 64, which is a unitary molded member, provides an axial channel 65 which is axially transgressed by the suspension rod 46. The second turned end 46b holds the end cap 56 to the suspension rod 46 at the downward end of the suspension strut assembly 34. Between the collet 64 and the end cap 56 is arranged the suspension spring 54 which supports the collet 64 train the end cap 56 in a floating fashion. The collet 64 in turn supports the socket 36 which supports, along with all tho suspension strut assemblies 34, the floating frame 35. Residing coaxially inside the suspension spring 54 and resting against the end cap 56 is a resilient end stop 68 which prevents hard bottoming out of the collet 64 against the end cap 56, i.e., the resilient end stop 68 provides a "bumper" against knocking or violent contact between the collet 64 and the end cap 56.<br>
FIG. 4 shows an enlarged and isolated viow of the collot 64. The collet 64 comprises left and right cooperating sleeve portions 80a, 80b at an upper portion 64a, and loft and riqht eooporat: ing spherically contoured shoulder portions 82a, 82b at a central portion 64b of the collet. The sleeve portions 80a, 80b are molded<br><br>
integrally with the shoulder portions 82a, 82b. The sleeve portions 80a, 80b, as more clearly shown in FIG. 5, are also molded integrally into a tube portion 84 which extends down to a lower portion G4c ol the collet 64. A first planar slot 08 is formed in the collet 64 in the upper 64 a and central 64b portions and separates the left sleeve portion 80a from the right sleeve portion 80b and forms a gap 89 between the left shoulder portion 82a and the right shoulder portion 82b. The first slot 88 proceeds downwardly through the tube portion 84 but terminates at a terminal end 88a, a short distance from a bottom end 84a of the tube portion 84. The slot 88 does not extend into the lower portion 64c of the collet 64.<br>
A plurality of formed webs 94 extend from an underside 82c of the left and right r.houldor portions B2a, 82b to an outside surface 84b of the tube portion 84. A downwardly displayed finger 94a or a squared off finger 98, proceed from the webs 94 in generally parallel fashion to the tube portion 84. A slot-like clearance 102 is arranged between the fingers 94a, 98 and the outside surface 84b of the tube portion 84, shown clearly in FIG. 5. The webs 94 provide inclined surfaces 95, which are engaged by the suspension spring 54, permit axial force from the suspension spring to exert an inward squeezing force on the shoulder portions 02a, 82b.<br>
FIG. 5 shows the cooperating sleeve portion 80a comprising a beveled peripheral inside diameter 81 at the top portion 64a which assists in assembly of the suspension rod 46 through the tube portion 84 as a funnel-like guideway to align the suspension rod 46 axially into the channel 65 of the tube portion 84.<br>
Arranged 90Â° offset around the axis of the tube portion 84 is; a second slot 90 extending through the lower portion 64c and part<br>
of the central portion 64b of the tube portion 84. Since 1 ho tube. portion 04 in a hollow tube, I ho slot 90 rerailtr. in two slotted openings 90a, 90b through the tube portion 84, as shown in FIG. 6. The second slot 90 proceeds from the bottom end 84a upwardly to a terminal end 90c which is located above the terminal end 88a of the first slot 88. In the preferred embodiment the terminal end 90c is arranged somewhat below a lowest point of attachment 84c of the fingers 94a to the outside surface 84b of the tube portion 84.<br>
The squared off fingers 98 are aligned with a lateral axis aligning the clotted opcningr, 90a, 90b of. the second slot 90. The squared off fingers 98 terminate in flat surfaces 98a which provides for non-interference with tooling to form the second slot 90, the surface 98a being substantially aligned for clearance with the terminal end 90c of the second a Lot 90. The fingers 94a and the squared off fingers 98 are arranged to form around their outside circumference a physical perimeter to guide and hold therearound the suspension spring 54 centered onto the collet G4 and engaging the inclined surfaces 95.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5 through T'IG. 7, the channel 64 comprises a circular axial bore through the tube portion 84 and the cooperating sleeve portions 80a, 80b. Referring to FIG. 8, the channel 65, when the suspension rod 46 is pierced therethrough, is stretched to accommodate the suspension rod 46 which has a radius R2 greater than the radius Rl of the channel 65. The slot indicated at "S" is either the first slot an or the second slot 90 depending on location of the particular section of FIG. 8. When FIG. 8 is the section VIII-VIII as taken from FTG. 3 the slot s is the second slot 90. When FIG. 8 is the section V1II-VIII of FIG. 5, oriented 90Â° from the section of FIG. 3, the slot S is the first<br>
slot 88. Thus, the channel 65 is stretched or warped about two lateral axes of its circular cross section with the first slot 88 and the second slot 90 giving the tubular portion 84 the effective flexibility to do so.<br>
The difference in radius dimensioning causes the suspension rod 46 to fit into the tube portion 84 with opposing crescent-shaped gaps 84i, 84j disposed between the suspension rod 46 and the tube portion 84c, 84d respectively. Therefore, an edge contact between the suspension rod 46 and the tube portion 84 occurs at edges 84e, 84f, 84g, 84h. When the collet is put under a load, i.e., compression of the suspension spring 54, the edges 84e, 84f, 84g, 84h spread and the gaps B4.L, 84 j disappear. This creates a wear surface engagement between the. suspension rod 46 and the tube portions 84 that has uniform contact. if the radius HI were designed to match the suspension rod radius R2 in a relaxed state, the rod would be able to twist back and forth in the collet 64 and wear would actually have to take place before a stable fit was created. This would not happen until a significant part of the machine life had passed.<br>
Since the first slot 88 terminates at terminal end 88a short of the collet low end 84a, two web portions 85a, 85b which are interrupted by the second slot 90, are formed which bind the suspension rod into the collet and allow the collet to expand and contract evenly along its length as it wears against the suspension rod 46. Wear surfaces 84k, R4m along the length of the channel 65 are consistent, and are considerably larger- than in a collet that has only one split or slot. The web portions 85a, 85b that connect the collet allow the collet 64 to flex but still provide enough strength to prevent the tube portion 84 from separating and being!<br>
stripped from the suspension rod if the washing machine  is mishandled during shipping or installation.<br>
Wear surfaces 84k and 84m are self adjusting with wear. When a suspension load is applied to the machine, the suspension spring 54 bears against the inclined surfaces 95, forcing the two halves 82a, 82b together to conform into the socket 36 and thereby into intimate and even contact with the suspension rod. As the collet wears, these surfaces flex radially inward to maintain proper orientation and contact with the suspension rod 46. The first slot 88 is reduced evenly along its length as wear takes place. This invention results in a maximized wear surface of the tube portion and allows higher frictional damping forces to be generated.<br>
Although the present invention has been described with reference to a specific embodiment, those of skill in the art will recognize that changes may be made thereto without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as set forth in the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
