				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention is generally concerned with terminal blocks of the type used in a cabinet to connect various electrical devices to a common polarity, for example.<br>
The main component of such terminal blocks has the general form of a conductive material strip forming spaced connecting terminals each including a hole into which a cable can be inserted and a screwthreaded bore intersecting this hole transversely, opening onto a common face of the strip for all of the connection terminals and into which a clamping screw is screwed.<br>
The present invention is more particularly directed to the situation in which, for reasons of insulation and therefore of safety, an insulative material support and an insulative material cover are associated with a strip of this kind, referred to hereinafter for convenience only as a terminal strip.<br>
The support can in practice receive a single terminal strip or a plurality of terminal strips aligned with each other but appropriately separated from each other and is in the general form of an elongate trough with a U-shape cross-section having two side walls and a bottom wall. Where the terminal strip or each terminal strip runs longitudinally above the bottom wall, at least one of the side walls has spaced openings in corresponding relationship to the holes in the terminal strip(s), providing access to these holes.<br>
The cover overlies the terminal strip(s) and has spaced openings in corresponding relationship to the screwthreaded bores in the terminal strip(s) to provide access to the corresponding screws.<br>
The cover can be attached, for example clipped, to one or more terminal strips.<br>
However,  since such fixing is inevitably to the<br>
decrement of the usable length of the terminal strip(s), the cover is usually attached to the support.<br>
In all cases, the cover has until now run uniformly along the entire length of the support.<br>
In other words, until now there has been only one cover per support, uniformly covering all of the connection strips on the support.<br>
This causes difficulties in identifying and marking the polarities to which these terminal strips correspond.<br>
At present the polarities are usually marked by providing the cover with marks at the required locations, and these marks are usually in the form of numbers or symbols.<br>
This has the disadvantage that an installer cannot modify the make-up of a terminal block without changing the cover.<br>
The cover is in practice of uniform colour and therefore has the further disadvantage of making it difficult to mark the polarities either during an initial wiring operation or during subsequent work on the wiring.<br>
A general objective of the present invention is an arrangement providing a very simple way to avoid these disadvantages and also yielding other advantages.<br>
To be more precise, the present invention consists in a terminal block of the kind including an insulative material support in the general form of an elongate trough with a U-shape cross-section, two side walls and a bottom wall, and at least one of the side walls of which has spaced openings, at least one conductive material terminal strip running longitudinally in the support, above its bottom wall, and which has in corresponding relationship to the openings in the latter spaced holes each of which is intersected transversely by a screwthreaded bore into which a clamping screw is screwed, and an insulative material cover attached to the<br>
support, overlying the terminal strip and which has spaced openings in corresponding relationship to the screwthreaded bores of the latter, characterized in that the length of the cover is less than that of the support.<br>
For example, the terminal strip having a number of holes less than the number of openings in the support, there is individually associated with the terminal strip a cover which has a number of openings equal to the number of holes in the latter and the support has abutment means for longitudinally locating the terminal strip and/or the cover relative to it.<br>
In other words, in accordance with the invention, a particular cover can be associated with each individual terminal strip, if required.<br>
It is therefore advantageously possible for the installer to make up the terminal block as required, and to change its make-up afterwards as necessary.<br>
Each time, it is sufficient to use the necessary terminal strip(s) and to associate the appropriate cover with each of them.<br>
Furthermore, the corresponding polarity or polarities can advantageously be marked in a very simple manner, if required.<br>
All that is required for this, in accordance with a further feature of the invention, and without dispensing with the possibility of marking by means of a number or a symbol if necessary, is for the cover associated with a terminal strip to have at least locally an individual colour mark associated with a given polarity.<br>
To this end, the cover may be uniformly coloured over all of its outside surface, or even self-coloured, for example.<br>
The polarities being therefore clearly visible, marking them is advantageously facilitated both during an initial wiring operation and during subsequent work on<br>
the wiring.<br>
Finally, the terminal block of the invention advantageously lends itself to making up all terminal block configurations in common use, in a simple manner and without difficulty.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a terminal block of the kind comprising a support which, made of insulating material, comprises in the general form of an elongate channel of U-shaped cross-section two side walls and a bottom wall and of which one at least of the side walls has at spaced locations openings, at least one connecting bar which, made of conducting material, extends longitudinally in the support above its bottom wall and which, at positions corresponding to the openings thereof, has at spaced locations holes, each of which is transversely cut by a screwthreaded bore with which a clamping screw is engaged, and a cap which, made of insulating material and fitted to the support, extends over the connecting bar and which, at positions corresponding to the screwthreaded bores thereof, has at spaced locations openings, characterised in that the length of the cap is less than that of the support and that, the connecting bar having a number of holes which is smaller than the number of openings that the support has, individually associated with each connecting bar is a cap which has a number of openings that is equal to the number of holes therein.<br>

As shown in the figures, the terminal block 10 of the invention includes, in a manner that is known in itself, a support 11, at least one terminal strip 12-1, 12-2 and at least one cover 13-1, 13-2.<br>
The insulative material support 11 has the general form of an elongate trough of U-shape cross-section with two side walls 14A, 14B and a bottom wall 16. At least one of the side walls, here the side wall 14A, has spaced openings 15.<br>
The conductive material (for example brass) terminal strip 12-1, 12-2 runs longitudinally in the support 11 between its side walls 14A, 14B and above its bottom wall 16, and has spaced holes 18 through it, i.e. extending from one of its lateral faces 19 to the other, in corresponding relationship to the openings 15 in the support 11 and each intersected on the side opposite the bottom wall 16 of the support 11 by a transverse screwthreaded bore 20 into which a clamping screw 21 is screwed.<br>
Made of insulative material, like the support 11, the covers 13-1, 13-2 are attached to the support 11 by arrangements described in more detail below and overlie the terminal strips 12-1, 12-2. In corresponding<br>
relationship to the screwthreaded bores 20 in the latter, it has spaced openings 22 providing access to the clamping screws 21 screwed into the screwthreaded bores 20.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the length of the covers 13-1, 13-2 is less than that of the support 11.<br>
As shown here, for example, the terminal strips 12-1, 12-2 have a number N'l, N'2 of holes 18 less than the number N of openings 15 in the support 11 and, therefore having a length less than that of the latter, there are individually associated with the terminal strips 12-1, 12-2 covers 13-1, 13-2 which have a number N'l, N'2 of openings 22 equal to the number N'l, N'2 of holes 18 in the latter; conjointly, and by virtue of arrangements also described in more detail below, the support 11 has abutment means 24, 25A, 25B for longitudinally locating the terminal strip 12-1, 12-2 and/or the cover 13-1, 13-2 relative to it.<br>
In the embodiment shown, only the side wall 14A of the support 11 includes openings 15, of which there are 34, for example (N = 34).<br>
The openings 15 are aligned and all have a circular contour.<br>
In practice they all have the same diameter except for those at the ends of the support 11, which have a slightly larger diameter than the others, and those which have the same diameter have a regular pitch P.<br>
In the embodiment shown, three terminal strips 12-1, 12-2 are provided in the support 11, with three covers 13-1, 13-2 respectively associated with the three terminal strips 12-1, 12-2.<br>
Firstly, there is a terminal strip 12-1 having a number N'l of holes 18 at least equal to 13.<br>
There are then, aligned with this strip, but separated from it and from each other, two terminal<br>
strips 12-2 each having a number N'2 of holes 18 less than 13, and therefore having a length less than that of the terminal strip 12-1.<br>
As shown here, for example, the number N'l of holes 18 in the terminal strip 12-1 is equal to 13 and the number N'2 of holes 18 in the terminal strips 12-2 is equal to 8.<br>
These numerical values are given by way of example only, of course, and must not be regarded as in any way limiting on the invention.<br>
The terminal strips 12-1, 12-2 are of generally similar construction: they have the same rectangular cross-sectional contour with edges lightly chamfered, their holes 18 all have the same circular cross-sectional contour and their screwthreaded bores 20 all open onto the same face, in this example their top face 26.<br>
In the terminal strip 12-1 having a number N'l of holes 18 at least equal to 13, the hole 18 at one end at least has a diameter greater than that of the others.<br>
As shown here, for example, this is the case at one end only of this terminal strip 12-1, in this example its lefthand end as shown in figure 3.<br>
In the terminal strips 12-2 having a number N'2 of holes 18 less than 13, all the holes 18 have the same diameter, which is equal to that of the main holes 18 in the terminal strip 12-1.<br>
The holes 18 and the main holes 18 in the terminal strip 12-1 have a regular pitch P equal to that of the openings 15 in the support 11.<br>
In the embodiment shown, the support 11 has transverse walls 28 at its ends, level with its side walls 14A, 14B, and its abutment means 24, 25A, 25B comprise a tongue 24 projecting from each of these transverse walls 28 and referred to hereinafter as the longitudinal tongue.<br>
The longitudinal tongue 24 extends part of the height of the transverse walls 28 from the middle part of the bottom wall 16, and its edge has an engagement profile 29 that is generally oblique to the bottom wall 16, this engagement profile 29, which is generally rounded in practice, diverging from the transverse walls 28 in the direction towards the bottom wall 16.<br>
In the embodiment shown the bottom wall 16 of the support 11 has a longitudinal channel 31 recessed into its inside surface for receiving the terminal strips 12-1, 12-2, the width L1 of this channel being substantially equal to that of the terminal strips 12-1, 12-2, but slightly greater than the latter.<br>
The channel 31 has recessed into its bottom along each of its longitudinal flanks a groove 32 to accommodate any flash along the edges of the terminal strips 12-1, 12-2.<br>
In the embodiment shown the abutment means 24, 25A, 25B of the support 11 further include tongues 25A, 25B, referred to hereinafter as transverse tongues, which project transversely from the inside surface of at least one of the lateral walls 14A, 14B as far as the channel 31, level with the longitudinal flanks of the latter, leaving a free distance L1 between them equal to the width Ll of the channel 31.<br>
The covers 13-1, 13-2 have a transverse wall 34 at one end at least, in practice at each end, the width L2 of which is less than the internal distance L3 between the two side walls 14A, 14B of the support 11 and greater than the previously mentioned free distance Ll between the transverse tongues 25A, 25B.<br>
To facilitate fitting the connecting strips 12-1, 12-2, the edges of the transverse tongues 25A, 25B on the same side as the free edge of the side walls 14A, 14B of the support 11 have an engagement profile 36 that is<br>
generally oblique to the bottom wall 16 of the support 11 and in practice generally rounded, the engagement profile 36 diverging from the side walls 14A, 14B in the direction towards the bottom wall 16.<br>
For each opening 15 there are in practice two transverse tongues 25A, 25B on respective opposite sides of the opening 15.<br>
However, in the embodiment shown, the transverse tongues 25A, 25B are distributed between the two side walls 14A, 14B of the support 11.<br>
In practice, at least in the middle part of the support 11 the transverse tongues 25A, 25B alternate from one of the side walls 14A, 14B to the other, the transverse tongues 25A projecting from the side wall 14A and the transverse tongues 25B on the side wall 14B.<br>
At least in the middle part of the support 11 the transverse tongues 25A have two sections 37, 38 staggered in height and of different widths, namely (figure 8) a relatively narrower top section 37 which forms the engagement profile 36 and a relatively wider bottom section 38, with a connecting section 39 between the two sections 37, 38 of different widths with a width which varies progressively from that of the one to that of the other.<br>
Of course, the distance L1 is measured at the foot of the transverse tongues 25A, 25B, i.e. where they merge with the bottom wall 16, and therefore at the level of the bottom section 38 of the transverse tongues 25A.<br>
In at least the middle part of the support 11 the transverse tongues 25B projecting from the side wall 14B of the latter alternate with lugs 41 for retaining the terminal strips 12-1, 12-2.<br>
These lugs 41 are in line with the respective transverse tongues 25A projecting from the opposite side wall 14A.<br>
To make them easier to fit the free ends of the terminal strips 12-1, 12-2 are chamfered.<br>
To facilitate moulding the lugs 41 the side wall 14B of the support 11 has a slot 42 in line with each lug.<br>
This slot 42 extends from the lug 41 as far as the bottom wall 16.<br>
In the embodiment shown, the side wall 14A of the support 11 has a rib 44 projecting from its outside surface which runs longitudinally at least part of its length, in practice its entire length, level with the bottom part of the openings 15.<br>
In line with each of the openings 15, the rib 44 has a recess 45 in the form of a trough transverse and slightly oblique to the bottom wall 16 and merging continuously with the lower part of the opening 15.<br>
In addition to its stiffening function, the rib 44 guides the electrical conductors to be inserted into the holes 18 in the terminal strips 12-1, 12-2 towards the openings 15 and therefore towards the holes 18, and then provides local support for these electrical conductors once they have been clamped by the associated clamping screws 21.<br>
In the embodiment shown, the side wall 14B of the support 11 has a rib 47 projecting from its outside surface, running longitudinally at least part of its length, in practice virtually all of its length, level with the bottom surface of the bottom wall 16.<br>
The rib 47 has primarily a stiffening function.<br>
In the embodiment shown, the side walls 14A, 14B of the support 11 each have, near their free edge, a groove 48 running longitudinally at least part of their length, in practice all of their length, for clipping on the covers 13-1, 13-2 in a manner described in more detail below.<br>
In the embodiment shown, the groove 48 has an asymmetric transverse profile, with a top flank parallel to the bottom wall 16 and an oblique bottom converging towards the outside surface of the side walls 14A, 14B in the direction away from the free edge of the latter.<br>
In the embodiment shown, nesting means 51 are formed on the outside surface of the bottom wall 16 of the support 11 for its interengagement with any kind of support bar 50, shown schematically in chain-dotted line in figure 2.<br>
The nesting means 51 include a blade member 52 on one side of the bottom wall 16 which runs longitudinally at least part of the length of the bottom wall 16, in practice its entire length, and which includes at least locally at least one right-angle lip 53 facing inwards and at least one clipping lug 54 on the opposite side of the bottom wall 16 which is elastically deformable and the free end of which forms a hook facing inwards.<br>
In practice there are two clipping lugs 54 at respective ends of the bottom wall 16 and the rib 47 ends at a distance from them.<br>
In the embodiment shown, the clipping lugs 54 form open hoops.<br>
The blade members 52 have a number of spaced right-angle rims 53.<br>
The resulting nesting means 51 constitute fixing means for the support 11.<br>
Of course, other fixing means are feasible.<br>
As shown here, for example, these fixing means can include, at each end of the support 11, an apertured lug 55 projecting outwardly on the corresponding transverse wall 28 and two elastically deformable lugs 56 flanking an apertured lug 55 of this kind laterally, parallel to the side walls 14A, 14B.<br>
Instead of or in addition to this, projecting lugs,<br>
not shown, can be provided on the side wall 14B.<br>
As mentioned above, in the embodiment shown, each of the terminal strips 12-1, 12-2 is individually associated with a specific cover 13-1, 13-2.<br>
The various covers 13-1, 13-2 have a generally similar construction, only the number N'l, N'2 of the openings 22 in them varying.<br>
In addition to two transverse walls 34, they have a substantially flat top wall 58 extending from one of the transverse walls 34 to the other and including openings 22 with a regular pitch P equal to that of the openings 15 in the support 11 and two slightly curved side walls 59 extending only part of the height of the transverse walls 34 from the top wall 58.<br>
The main part of the transverse walls 34 has the width L2 specified above (figure 14) and the side walls have an extension 60 at their base for interengagement with the channel 31 formed by the bottom wall 16 of the support 11.<br>
In cooperation with the bottom wall 16, this provides some degree of continuity of insulation at this level.<br>
Each side wall 59 has a clipping lug 61 at each end, extending beyond the free edge, for interengagement with the grooves 48 provided for this purpose on the side walls 14A, 14B of the support 11, as shown in figure 2; for the purposes of this interengagement, they have an inwardly projecting bead 62 along their free edge.<br>
In the embodiment shown, the covers 13-1, 13-2 have at least one marking area 63 on at least one of their side walls 59 adapted to receive a marker, not shown, in practice a marker which clips in place.<br>
In the embodiment shown, the covers 13-1, 13-2 in practice have a marking area 63 on both side walls 59, but to minimize the weakening that could result from this<br>
the corresponding marking areas 63 are offset longitudinally relative to each other from one of the side walls 59 to the other.<br>
In the embodiment shown, the marking areas 63 are each further adapted in practice to enable the fitting of two markers side by side and to this end include two openings 64 in the side walls 59 in the vicinity of where they merge with the top wall 58 and two notches 65 along the free edge of the side walls 59, in line with the openings 64.<br>
By virtue of arrangements that cannot be seen in the figures, the covers 13-1, 13-2 can have an individual colour marker, at least locally.<br>
For example, they can be uniformly coloured over all of their outside surface, or even self-coloured, with a colour related to the polarity of the associated terminal strip 12-1, 12-2.<br>
To be more precise, the cover 13-1 can be a first colour, for example, one of the covers 13-2 a second colour different from the first colour, and the second cover 13-2 a third colour different from the other two.<br>
The colours used do not matter, but they preferably correspond to the colours conventionally assigned to the various polarities, e.g. live, neutral and earth.<br>
The terminal strip 12-1, the number N'l of holes 18 in which is at least equal to 13, having at one end a hole of larger diameter than the others, it must be placed at one end of the support 11 where there is a corresponding opening 15 of larger diameter than the others.<br>
For the necessary positional marking, this terminal strip 12-1 must then be longitudinally abutted against the corresponding longitudinal tongue 24 of the support 11.<br>
Accordingly,  the corresponding transverse wall 34<br>
of the cover 13-1 includes a notch 66 in corresponding relationship to this longitudinal tongue 24 and which also extends into its extension 60 and by means of which it can be engaged over the longitudinal tongue 24.<br>
The same does not necessarily apply to the other transverse wall 34 of the cover 13-1, and to act as a polarizer a notch 67 is provided on the support 11, at one end of its side wall 14A and at the opposite end of its side wall 14B, and a lug 68 is provided on the cover 13-1, projecting from the free edge of the side walls 59 of the cover 13-1, at one end of one of the side walls 59 and at the opposite end of the other side wall, for nesting interengagement with the notch 67 (see figure 14).<br>
As the terminal strips 12-2 are located in the middle area of the support 11, there is not necessarily any notch on one or the other of the transverse walls 34 of the covers 13-2, which is why the latter have been shown in continuous line with no such notch in figures 1, 18 and 19.<br>
However, as shown schematically in chain-dotted line in figure 18, a notch 66 can be provided here for other reasons.<br>
The terminal strips 12-1, 12-2, for example the terminal strip 12-1, can be fitted in the following manner, as shown schematically in chain-dotted line in figure 8.<br>
Initially, and as shown in figure 8, the terminal strip 12-1 is only partially engaged in the support 11, between the lugs 41 projecting from the side wall 14B and the transverse tongues 25A projecting from the side wall 14A, against the narrower top section 37 of the transverse tongues 25A, which is provided for this purpose.<br>
Then,  as  shown schematically by an arrow F in<br>
figure 8, the terminal strip 12-1 is forced further into the support 11, as far as the bottom wall 16 of the latter.<br>
This causes the terminal strip 12-1 to engage transversely under the lugs 41, which requires it to move transversely relative to the support 11, and depends on momentary elastic deformation of the support 11, which is facilitated by the oblique disposition of the connecting section 39 of the transverse tongues 25A.<br>
By sliding it longitudinally in the support 11, the terminal strip 12-1 is then butted against the corresponding longitudinal tongue 24 of the latter, as mentioned above.<br>
All that then remains is to clip the associated cover 13-1 into place.<br>
During this, the transverse wall 34 of the cover 13-1 nearest the transverse wall 28 concerned of the support 11 is inserted between this transverse wall 28 and the nearest transverse tongue 25B.<br>
This locates the cover 13-1 and therefore the terminal strip 12-1 longitudinally relative to the support 11, the terminal strip 12-1 being gripped between the transverse walls 34 of the cover 13-1.<br>
The terminal strips 12-2 are fitted in a similar manner.<br>
However, as shown in figure 19, the transverse walls 34 of the cover 13-2 individually associated with the connection strips 12-2 grip externally two transverse tongues 25B, or 25A, or 25A, 25B, which locates the whole longitudinally relative to the support 11.<br>
Of course, depending on the nature and/or the number of terminal strips 12-1, 12-2, etc fitted into the support 11, the terminal block 10 of the invention can have a different configuration to that specifically described and shown with one terminal strip 12-1 and two<br>
terminal strips 12-2.<br>
In practice, to correspond to the most usual configurations, terminals strips, not shown, are provided having numbers N' of holes 18 other than those previously indicated, with an individual cover for each terminal strip having the same number of openings.<br>
More generally, the present invention is obviously not limited to the embodiment described and shown, but encompasses any variant execution thereof.<br><br><br><br>
