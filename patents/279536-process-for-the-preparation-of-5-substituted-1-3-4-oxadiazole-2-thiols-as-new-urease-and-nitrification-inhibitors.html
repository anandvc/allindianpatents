"The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
This invention relates to a new process tor the preparation of 5-substituted-1,3,4-<br>
oxadiazole-2-thiols (1) and their new use as ureasc and nitrification inhibitors.This invention relention to a new srooess for the preparation of 5- Substituulid-1,2,3-okdiaeole-2 this is (1) and their new use as usease and nitracation in histers,(Formula Removed)<br>
<br>
R is C1 to C15 saturated or unsaturated alky!, unsubstituted or substituted by halogen, nitro, OR' - R' = CH3, C2H5 and or hydroxy; C6 to C2o aralkyl or aryl, unsubstituted or substituted by C1 to C4 alkyl, halogen, nitro, OR' - R' = CH3, C2H5 and or hydroxy; heterocyclyl, heterocycloalkyl and the like. Background<br>
5-Substituted-l,3,4-oxadiazole-2-thiols are important biologically active compounds. These l,3,4-oxadiazole-2-thiols are reportedly useful as tone improvers in photography (US Patent No 3,173,789) and also as side chain of well-known cephalosporin antibiotics (US Patent No 4,020,060). 5-Substituted-l,3,4-oxadizoles are also known to exhibit antimalarial, nematocidal, antimicrobial activities and have other important medicinal properties. 5-substituted-l,3,4-oxadiazole-2-thiols have not been known to act as urease and nitrification inhibitors. There is, thus, scope tor developing a new environmentally benign, tast, high yielding and atom efficient process for the preparation ol"5-substituted-l,3,4-oxadiazole-2-thiols and to tind their new use as urease and nitrification inhibitors.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Several procedures are available to produce 5-substituted-l,3,4-oxadiazole-2-<br>
thiols. J. Chem. Soc. 4811-4817 (1952), J. Am. Chcm. Soc. 78, 4475-4478 (1956) and<br>
Main Group Metal Chemistry 20(6), 367-372 (1997); each discloses a process tor preparing 5-substituted-l,3,4-oxadiazole-2-thiols from carboxylic acid hydrazide<br>
following its reaction with carbon disulphide in the presence of potassium hydroxide in alcohol. These processes suffer from the disadvantages of longer reaction time, from hours to days, low atom economy or atom utilization and low yields.<br>
J. Am. Chem. Soc. 77, 400-403 (1955) and Synthetic Communications 32(1), 111-114 (2002) disclose processes for preparing 5-substituted-l,3,4-oxadiazole-2-thiols from acyl dithiocarbazate salts. Its reaction produces good yields in less reaction time, but requires the isolation of acyl dithiocarbazate salts prepared by the reaction of carboxylic acid hydrazide with carbon disulphide.<br>
In order to make available to plants the nitrogen needed by them, they are fertilized, as is known, with ammonium compounds, which are micro bially oxidized / nitrified to nitrate in the soil in relatively short time.<br>
The nitrate is leached from soil more easily than ammonium and the leached portion, besides being non available for plant nutrition and also contributes to health and environmental hazards through contamination of ground water as well as by denitrification. Therefore, rapid nitrification is undesirable. In order that the tertilizer is utilized well, nitrification inhibitors are added to the soil. These inhibitors keep nitrogen in ammonium form and thus regulate its oxidation, thereby extending the availability to plants. This also enables a check on nitrogen losses, thereby improving nitrogen utiliztion efficiency.<br>
Several nitrification inhibitors are being reported from time to time and those reported recently are the pyrazole derivatives (US Pat No 3,635,690; US Pat No 4,969,946; US Pat<br>
No 5,972,064; US Pat No 6,488,734 131; US Pat No 6,802,882 B2). Most of the known nitritication inhibitors are not still fully satisfactory as they have one or more of the following disadvantages:<br>
Complex synthetic process High volatility Low stability<br>
Requirement of further modifications of the active molecule Addition of other compounds High cost<br>
5-substituted-l,3,4-oxadiazole-2-thiols have not been known to act as nitrification inhibitors. The present invention reports the use of such derivatives as effective urease and nitrification inhibitors and a process of obtaining such derivatives.<br>
Statement of the invention<br>
This invention relates to 5-substituted-l,3,4-oxadiazole-2-thiols of formula 1 as urease<br>
and nitrification inhibitors and an environment benign process tor the preparation of the same by reacting carboxylic acid hydrazide RCONHNH2., with carbon disulphide, CS2, in an energy transfer medium under microwave irradiation as follows<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
R = C1 to C15 saturated or unsaturated alkyl, unsubstituted or substituted by halogen, nitro, OR' - R' = CH3, C2H5 and or hydroxy; C6 to C2o aralkyl or aryl, unsubstituted or substituted by Ci to C4 alkyl, halogen, nitro, OR' - R' = CH3, O2H5 and or hydroxy; heterocyclyl, heterocycloalkyl and the like.<br>
The molar ratio of carboxylic acid hydrazide to carbon disulphide is generally from 0.1:1 to 2:1.<br>
The reaction is carried out in an energy transfer medium which is selected from amongst alcohols, glycols, organic acids, sulphoxides, amides, azines and the like, preferably pyridine, dimethyl sulphoxide, N,N-dimethyl amides, more preterably, dimethyl sulphoxide, N,N-dimethyltbrmamide, N,N-dimethyl acetamide. The reaction is carried out in a microwave oven at 90-900 watts for a period of instantaneous to 20 minutes, preterably 20 seconds to 10 minutes; more preterably 30 seconds to 5 minutes. The reaction product is subsequently worked up, following the usual prescribed methods. This process is fast, high yielding and environment friendly. As the reaction does not require any base such as potassium hydroxide under MW1; this process has higher atom economy as compared to earlier reported methods, that is, more number of atoms present in reactants are utilized to yield the product. Besides this, reaction rates were also fast with better yields.<br>
The invention also describes the use of l,3,4-oxadiazole-2-thiols as urease and nitrification inhibitors either through on the spot physical admixture or applied otherwise jointly or separately with the nitrogen fertilizers or as ready to use preparations of the fertilizer and the inhibitor. The application of inhibitor at 1-20% levels, preterably 5-10% level of the nitrogen level of the fertilizer has been found to be effective.<br>
4. Description<br>
Detailed description of the invention I Process<br>
â€¢  t<br>
An environment benign method of producing 5-substituted-l,3,4-oxadiazole-2-thiols has been developed. The process has higher atom utilization, higher yield, less reaction time and simple work up procedure.

The yield was 72.8 per cent. 11. Nitrification inhibition<br>
Compounds suitable ibr use as nitrification inhibitors are 5-substituted-l,3,4-oxadiazole-2-thioIs of general formula 1<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which R is generally C1 to C15, saturated or unsaturated alkyl, unsubstituted or substituted by halogen, nitro, OR' - R' = CH3, C2H5 and or hydroxy; C6 to C2o aralkyl or aryl, unsubstituted or substituted by C1 to C4 alkyl, halogen, nitro, OR' - R' = CH3, C2H5 and or hydroxy; heterocyclyl, heterocycloalkyl etc.<br>
'1'he 5-substituted-l,3,4-oxadiazole-2-thiols of formula 1 preferably contain units which are derived from acetic acid hydrazide, propanoic acid hydrazide, butanoic acid hydrazide, pentanoic acid hydrazide, octanoic acid hydrazide, decanoic acid hydrazide, dodecanoic acid hydrazide, benzoic acid hydrazide, furoic acid hydrazide and the like.<br>
<br>
The rate of application of 5-substituted-l,3,4-oxadiazole-2-thiols is generally from 0.01 to 30% of urea nitrogen, preierably 1 to 20% of urea nitrogen, and more preferably from 5 to 10% of urea nitrogen.<br>
The 5-substituted-l,3,4-oxadiazole-2-thiols of formula 1 which can be prepared in a simple manner from cost effective starting materials are especially distinguished in their use as nitrification inhibitors in that they effectively inhibit the nitrification of ammonium nitrogen in the soil over a long period of time.<br>
Example 6<br>
Nitrification inhibitory activity: The test chemicals were evaluated in a sandy loam soil |lnceptisol| at 10% of applied urea-N, with urea alone as control. The experiments were laid following complete randomised design. One hundred gram of air dried, finely ground and sieved (10 mesh) soil was taken in 250 ml beakers and mixed with calculated amount of solutions of the test chemical followed by addition of 20 mg of urea-N in aqueous solution in each treatment. Nitrapyrin and DCL), Uicyandiamide, were employed as reference inhibitors at 5% of applied urea-N. The experiment was conducted in triplicate. The contents of beakers were mixed and incubated at 30 Â°C maintaining moisture at 50 per cent of water holding capacity of the soil throughout the study. The moisture level was maintained by adding the required amount of distilled water every alternate day. Samples were withdrawn at 14, 28, 42 and 56 days of incubation; extracted with 1M sodium sulphate solution and estimated for ammonium, nitrite and nitrate nitrogen<br>
The percentage nitrification inhibition was calculated as follows {disclosed in Plant Soil 55, 487-490 (1980)}. Nitrification rate = {(NO3'-N + NO2"-N) x 100} / {(NH4'-N + NO3"-N + NO2"-N)}<br>
Percentage nitrification inhibition =<br>
{(Nitrification rate in control - Nitrification rate in sample)  100} / {Nitrification rate in control}<br>
As an example  5-furyI-l,3,4-oxadiazole-2-thiol,  9,  showed 60.6 and 45.4% nitrification inhibition on 28th and 42nd day of incubation as compared to 58.4 &amp; 13% nitrification inhibition by dicyandiamide on respective days (Table 1).
