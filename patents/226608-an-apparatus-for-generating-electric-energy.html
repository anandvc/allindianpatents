				<td>Salient Features of the Project The project regarding energy conversion and conservation is based on Pascal&#x27;s principle, i.e., pressure applied at any point of a fluid at rest is transmitted without loss at all other parts of the fluid. More or less energy is required according to more or less amount of work we have to do. This energy is found in various forms, viz. gravitational energy, electric energy, solar energy, heat energy, living beings energy, etc. We get energy through chemical and material processes. Use of chemical processes for getting energy has given rise to dangerous environmental pollution which has become a great health hazard. Besides, there are limited stocks of petroleum and coal which are used mainly to convert energy nowadays. In our project energy is converted and conserved by using material means only and mere are no ill effects on environment and living beings. The apparatus for the project is made of simple metals. In our project air is stocked into cylinders by using the slow and unpunctual motion of natural energy resources such as animal power, wind power, sea buoyancy power etc on the air compression system and turbines are turned by the potential energy thus generated. The mechanical energy generated by the turning of turbines is converted and conserved into electric energy with the help of electric generators, which are turned by the mechanical energy and are coupled with turbines. The apparatus is designed in such a way as to keep on functioning without interruption even in a situation when there is less external air pressure in the cylinders.</td>

				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The Invention relates to an apparatus capable of generating electric energy <br>
	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the modern age, we have made several inventions in the field of generation of electric energy. Chemical processes such as burning of carbonic matters like petroleum and coal play a dominant role in this field. As a result we have a very polluted environment due to the increased quantities of toxic pollutants like carbondioxide, sulphurdioxide, carbonmonoxide and solid particles such as carbon and lead. This has badly affected the process by which green plants convert carbondioxide and water into food using the energy in sunlight. This has also given rise to respiratory and other diseases in human beings, particularly in big cities.<br>
Use of chemical processes in energy conversion projects such as Thermal Power Projects is responsible to a great extent for climatic changes, damage to the ozone layer, rise in temperature and acid rains, etc. Splitting of the nuclei of atoms to get electric energy sends out deadly radiation in the atmosphere. Besides, petroleum and coal, which are mainly used in the generation of electric energy, are fossil fuels formed from the decayed remains of prehistoric animals and plants. Their stocks are limited and depleting fast.<br>
Hydropower projects also impact the environment adversely. Besides there is water shortage problem in these projects due to insufficient rainfall. Uninterrupted generation of good quality electricity is hampered in the present wind power projects due to slow, irregular and unstable motion of wind.<br>
To overcome the above problems I have invented an apparatus capable of generating electric energy by using animal power. The process invented by me to generate electric energy is fully eco-friendly and the sources used in it are renewable and there is no danger of their exhaustion.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.        The aim of the invention is to generate electric energy of daily use by using the unstable and irregular motion of an energy source, viz, animal power.<br>
2.        The aim of the invention is to generate electric energy in a eco-friendly project in a non-conventional manner.<br>
A SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the apparatus which generates electric energy by using animal power, a bevel<br>
gear is fitted in the middle of the circular path. A lever bar arm is fitted on the axis of the<br>
sun	gear. A pulley is fitted on the axis of the smaller	gear. This pulley en-<br>
gaged to the pulley of the air compressor with the help of a V belt. The air compressor is attached to a specially designed air cylinder. Vertical air-tight pistons are fitted inside this cylinder. Some weight is fitted on the upper ends of the connecting rods of these pistons. An exhaust pipe is fitted in the air cylinder and a gate valve is fitted in this exhaust pipe. Next to the exhaust pipe an air turbine is fitted. An electric generator is coupled to the axis of the turbine.<br>
An animal is yoKed to the lever bar arm. When the animal pulls the lever bar arm by moving on the circular path, the air compressor attached to the bevel gear is truned and the atmospheric air is filled in the air cylinder. The air-tight pistons fitted inside the cylinder and the weight on the upper ends of their connecting rods start lifting vertically because of the pressure of air in the cylinder. The weight on the upper ends of the connecting rods of pistons maintains constant and invariable pressure on the stocked air in the cylinder and thus potential energy is generated in the stocked air. When the gate valve is opened, the air turns the turbine at a constant and invariable pressure and the electric generator also turns on constant and invariable RPM, which generates electric energy of constant and invariable voltage. In this way, good quality electric energy on big scale can be generated by using animal power.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention was studied and conceived to avoid all the disadvantages alluded to above. Consequently, it is an essential goal of the present invention to propose a mechanism for generating electric energy without resorting to conventional means. Accordingly the present invention provides an apparatus to be operated by animal power, which will be of great service in electric energy generation through non-conventional means.<br>
The said apparatus comprises bevel gear which is fitted with the help of frame, bearings and axis in the middle of the circular path. A lever bar arm is fitted on the axis of the sun   gear of the said bevel gear and a pulley is fitted on the axis of the smaller gear of the said bevel gear. Next to the said pulley an air compressor is fitted and on one end of the crank shaft of the said air compressor a pulley is fitted. Both the said pulleys engaged with the help of a 'V belt. A piston is fitted inside the said air compressor. The said piston and the said crank shaft are joined with a connecting rod. A valve which opens inside is fitted in the said air compressor and another valve which opens outside is fitted in the said air compressor and next to it a cylinder is joined with the help of a link pipe. The said air cylinder is specially designed. Vertical air-tight pistons are fitted inside the said cylinder. Some weight is fitted on the upper ends of the connecting rods of the said pistons. A safety valve is fitted in the said air cylinder. An exhaust pipe is fitted to the said air cylinder and a gate valve is fitted in the said exhaust pipe. Next to the said exhaust pipe, an air turbine is fitted with the help of bearing and shaft. An electric generator is coupled with the said shaft of the said turbine. Thus the said apparatus becomes ready.<br>
FUNCTIONING OF THE SAID APPARATUS<br>
An animal is yoked to the said lever bar arm. The said animal pulls the said lever bar arm by moving on the said circular path. In this way the said bevel gear starts moving and with the help of the said V belt turns the said crank shaft of the said pump. Thus the said connecting rod moves the said piston backward and forward. When the said piston moves forward, then the said valve which opens inside gets closed and the said valve which opens outside gets opened and thus the air gets stocked in the said air cylinder through the said link pipe. When the said piston moves backward, the said valve which opens outside gets closed and the said valve which opens inside gets opened and thus the atmospheric air enters the said air compressor. Thus air gets stocked in the said air cylinder in big quantity by the continuous moving forward and backward of the said piston. Due to the stocking of air in the said air cylinder, the said pistons lift upward and the said weight fitted on the ends of the said connecting rods also lifts upward. The said weight on the ends of the said connecting rods maintains constant and invariable pressure on the stocked air Thus potential energy is generated in the stocked air. When the said gate valve is opened the turbine is turned by the pressure of air. In a situation when the motion of the said air compressor slows down or there is some temporary impediment, the said weight on the upper ends of pistons maintains constant and invariable pressure on the air and the said turbine keeps on turning by constant and<br>
invariable pressure and the said electric generator coupled with the said turbine also keeps on turning on constant and invariable RPM and thus electric energy of constant and invariable voltage is generated. Thus the electric energy generated by using animal power is that of good quality.<br>
When there is excessive air pressure in the said air cylinder, the said safety valve gets opened and keeps the said air cylinder safe. This project to generate electric energy is fully safe and eco-friendly.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Other particular features and advantages of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings which represent a non-limitative example of embodiment, in which drawing 1 represents the bevel gear and its parts in the middle of the circular path and an animal yoked to the lever bar arm of the bevel gear, figures 2 shows the parts of the air compressor and figure 3 shows the air cylinder, the gate valve fitted on it and other internal parts, figure 4 represents the air turbine and the electric generator coupled with it, figure 5 represents the overall view of the process.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT WITH REFERENCE TO DRAWINGS<br>
As can be seen in the figures, in the middle of the circular path (2) bevel gear is<br>
fitted with the help of frame (F), bearings (B1.B2.B3)) and axis (3,6). On the axis (3) of<br>
the sun	gear (8) a lever bar(4) arm is fitted and on the axis (6) of the smaller<br>
gear (5) a pulley (7) is fitted. Next to the pulley (7) an air compressor (9) is fitted and a pulley (10) is fitted on the end of the crank shaft (15) of the air compressor (9). Both the pulleys (7,10) engaged with the help of a V belt (11). A piston (13) is fitted in the air compressor (9). The piston (13) and the crank shaft (15) are joined with a connecting rod (16). A valve (V1) which opens inside is fitted in the air compressor (9) and another valve (V2) which opens outside is fitted in the air compressor (9). Next to the air compressor (9) an air cylinder (17) is fitted. Air compressor (9) and the air cylinder (17) are joined with the link pipe (12). Vertical air-tight pistons (19,20) are fitted in the air cylinder (17). Some weight (23) is fitted on the upper ends of the connecting rods (21,22) of pistons (19,20). A safety valve (18) is fitted in the air cylinder (17). An exhaust pipe (25) is fitted to the air cylinder (17) and a gate valve (24) is fitted in the exhaust pipe (25). Next to the exhaust pipe (25) an air turbine (26) is fitted with the help<br>
of bearing (27) and shaft (29). An electric generator (30) is coupled      &gt; to the shaft (29) of the turbine (26).<br>
The apparatus being composed in this way, operation of the assembly is as follows:-<br>
When the animal (1) yoked to the lever bar arm (4) pulls the lever bar arm (4) by moving on the circular path (2), the bevel gear starts turning and the crank shaft (15) of the air compressor (9) is turned by the 'V' belt (11). Thus the connecting rod (16) causes the piston (13) to move forward and backward. When the piston (13) moves forward, the valve (V1) which opens inside gets closed and the valve (V2) which opens outside gets opened which causes the air to enter through the link pipe (12) and fill the air cylinder (17). When the piston (13) moves backward, the valve (V2) which opens outside gets closed and the valve (V1) which opens inside gets opened which causes the atmospheric air to enter the air compressor. When the piston (13) moves backward and forward repeatedly, air gets stocked in the air cylinder (17) in big quantity which causes the pistons (19,20) and the weight (23) on the upper ends of the connecting rods (21,22) to lift upward. Thus the weight (23) maintains constant and invariable pressure on the stocked air which generates potential energy in the stocked air.<br>
When the gate valve (24) is opened, the turbine (26) starts turning by the pressure of air. In a situation when the motion of air compressor (9) slows down or there is some temporary impediment, the weight (23) keeps on maintaining constant and invariable pressure on the air. Thus the turbine (26) keeps on turning by the constant and invariable pressure and the electric generator (30) coupled I with the turbine (26) also turns on constant and invariable RPM and generates electric energy of constant and invariable voltage.<br>
Whenever there is excessive air pressure in the air cylinder (17), the safety valve (18) gets opened and keeps the cylinder (17) safe. This project to generate electric energy is fully safe and eco-friendly.<br><br><br><br><br>
