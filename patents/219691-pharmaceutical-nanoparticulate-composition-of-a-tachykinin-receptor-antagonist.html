TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION OF A TACHYKININ RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Substance P is a naturally occurring undecapeptide belonging to the tachykinin family of peptides, the latter being so-named because of their prompt contractile action on extravascular smooth muscle tissue. The tachykinins are distinguished by a conserved carboxyl-terminal sequence. In addition to SP the known mammalian tachykinins include neurokinin A and neurokinin B. The current nomenclature designates the receptors for substance P, neurokinin A, and neurokinin B as neurokinin-1 (NK-1), neurokinin-2 (NK-2), and neurokinin-3 (NK-3), respectively.<br>
Evidence has been reviewed for the usefulness of tachykinin receptor antagonists in pain, headache, especially migraine, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, attenuation of morphine withdrawal, cardiovascular changes, oedema, such as oedema caused by thermal injury, chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma/bronchial hyperreactivity and other respiratory diseases including allergic rhinitis, inflammatory diseases of the gut including ulcerative colitis and Chrohn's disease, ocular injury and ocular inflammatory diseases, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, irritable bowel syndrome and disorders of bladder function including cystitis and bladder detruser hyperreflexia.<br>
It has furthermore been suggested that tachykinin receptor antagonists have utility in the following disorders: anxiety, depression, dysthymic disorders, chronic obstructive airways disease, hypersensitivity disorders such as poison ivy, vasospastic diseases such as angina and Reynauld's disease, fibrosing and collagen diseases such as scleroderma and eosinophillic fascioliasis, reflex sympathetic dystrophy such as shoulder/hand syndrome, addiction disorders such as alcoholism, stress related somatic disorders, neuropathy, neuralgia, disorder related to immune enhancement or suppression such as systemic lupus erythmatosus, ophthalmic diseases such as conjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis, and the like, and cutaneous diseases such as contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, urticaria, and other eczematoid dermatitis.<br>
Attempts have been made to provide antagonists for the receptors of substance P and other tachykinin peptides in order to more effectively treat the<br><br>
various disorders and diseases mentioned above. In particular, PCT Publication No. WO 94/00440, EPO Publication No. 0,577,394, PCT Publication No. WO 95/16679, U.S. Patent No. 5,719,147 and U.S. Patent No. 6.096,742 disclose certain morpholine and thiomorpholine compounds as substance P antagonists.   In particular, the compound 2-(R)-(l-(R)-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl)ethoxy)-3-(S)-(4-fluoro)phenyl-4-(3-(5-oxo-lH,4H-l,2,4-triazolo)methylmorpholine is disclosed as the title compound of Example 75 of U.S. Patent No. 5,719,147.<br>
Nanoparticulate compositions, first described in U.S. Patent No. 5,145,684, are particles consisting of a poorly soluble therapeutic or diagnostic agents having adsorbed onto the surface thereof a non-crosslinked surface stabilizer. This and later references do not describe nanoparticulate compositions comprising 2-(R)-(l-(R)-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)ethoxy)-3-(S)-(4-fluoro)phenyl-4-(3-(5-oxo-1 H,4H-1,2,4-triazolo)methylmorpholine.<br>

Most of these surface stabilizers are known pharmaceutical excipients and are described in detail in the Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, published jointly by the American Pharmaceutical Association and The Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (The Pharmaceutical Press, 1986), specifically incorporated by reference. The surface stabilizers are commercially available and/or can be prepared by techniques known in the art.<br>
The nanoparticles of the invention contain a discrete phase of an active ingredient with the surface stabilizer adsorbed on the surface thereof. It has been discovered that the surface stabilizer physically adheres to the active ingredient, but it does not chemically bond to or chemically react with the drug. Such chemical bonding or interaction would be undesirable as it could result in altering the function of the drug. The surface stabilizer is adsorbed on the surface of the active ingredient in an amount sufficient to maintain an effective average particle size of less than about 1000 run, and more preferably, less than about 400 nm, and most preferably, less than about 250 nm. Furthermore, the individually adsorbed molecules of the surface stabilizer are essentially free of intermolecular cross-linkages.<br>
In an aspect of the present invention the surface stabilizer is selected from hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), which is an ether of cellulose, HPC super low viscosity (HPC-SL), HPC-low viscosity (HPC-L), and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC). Preferred surface stabilizers include, but are not limited to hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), HPC-SL, HPC-L, methyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose sodium or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC). {see, e.g., Remington's at pp. 1304-1308). Preferably, HPC, HPC-SL, HPC-L or HPMC are used as surface stabilizers; HPC-SL is particularly preferred as the surface stabilizer.<br>
The relative amount of the compound 2-(R)-(l-(R)-(3,5-bis(trifluoro-methyl)phenyl)ethoxy)-3-(S)-(4-fluoro)phenyl-4-(3-(5-oxo-1 H,4H-1,2,4-triazolo)-methylmorpholine and one or more surface stabilizers can vary widely. The optimal<br><br>
amount of the surface stabilizers can depend, for example, upon hydrophilic lipophilic balance (HLB), melting point, and water solubility of the surface stabilizer, and the surface tension of water solutions of the stabilizer, etc.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, there is provided a method of preparing the above-described nanoparticulate drug particles. The method comprises dispersing an active ingredient in a liquid dispersion medium and applying mechanical means in the presence of grinding media to reduce the average particle size of the active ingredient to an effective average particle size of less than about 1000 nm, more preferably, less than about 400 nm, and most preferably, less than about 250 nm. The drug particles can be reduced in size in the presence of a surface stabilizer, or the drug particles can be contacted with a surface stabilizer after attrition.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, a method for preparing a nanoparticulate pharmaceutical composition in a tablet form is provided. In such a method, the nanoparticles are compressed into tablets. The tablets generally also comprise at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>

The nanoparticulate compositions can be made using, for example, milling or precipitation techniques. Exemplary methods of making nanoparticulate compositions are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,145,684 and 5,862,999.<br>
The nanoparticulate drug particles of the present invention can be prepared by first dispersing the compound 2-(R)-(l-(R)-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl)ethoxy)-3-(S)-(4-fluoro)phenyl"4-(3-(5-oxo-lH,4H-l,2,4-triazolo)methyl-morpholine in a liquid dispersion medium followed by applying mechanical means in the presence of grinding media to reduce the particle size of the active ingredient to an effective average particle size of less than about 1000 nm, preferably, less than about 400 nm, and more preferably, less than about 250 nm. The drug particles can be<br><br>
reduced in size in the presence of the surface stabilizer or the drug particles can be contacted with the surface stabilizer following attrition.<br>
Milling of the compound 2-(R)-(l-(R)-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-ethoxy)-3-(S)-(4-fluoro)phenyl-4-(3-(5-oxo-l H,4H-1,2,4-triazolo)methylmorpholine to obtain a nanoparticulate dispersion comprises dispersing particles of the compound 2-(R)-(l-(R)-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)ethoxy)-3-(S)-(4-fluoro)-phenyl-4-(3-(5-oxo- lH,4H-l,2,4-triazolo)methylmorpholine in a liquid dispersion medium, followed by applying mechanical means in the presence of grinding media to reduce the particle size of the compound to the desired effective average particle size. The particles of the compound can be reduced in size in the presence of at least one surface stabilizer. Alternatively, the particles of the compound can be contacted with one or more surface stabilizers after attrition. Other compounds, such as a diluent, can be added to the 2-(R)-(l-(R)-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)ethoxy)-3-(S)-(4-fluoro)phenyl-4-(3-(5-oxo-lH,4H-l,2,4-triazolo)methylmorpholine/surface stabilizer composition during the size reduction process. Dispersions can be manufactured continuously or in a batch mode. The resultant nanoparticulate dispersion can be utilized in solid or liquid dosage formulations, such as controlled release dosage formulations, solid dose fast melt formulations, aerosol formulations, tablets, capsules, etc.<br>
Another method of forming the desired nanoparticulate composition is by microprecipitation. This is a method of preparing stable dispersions of the compound 2-(R)-(l-(R)-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)ethoxy)-3-(S)-(4-fluoro)phenyl-4-(3-(5-oxo-lH,4H-l,2,4-triazolo)methylmorpholine in the presence of one or more surface stabilizers and one or more colloid stability enhancing surface active agents free of any trace toxic solvents or solubilized heavy metal impurities. Such a method comprises, for example: (1) dissolving the compound 2-(R)-(l-(R)-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)-pheny^<br>
l,2,4-triazolo)methyl-morpholine in a suitable solvent; (2) adding the formulation from step (1) to a solution comprising at least one surface stabilizer to form a clear solution; and (3) precipitating the formulation from step (2) using an appropriate non-solvent. The method can be followed by removal of any formed salt, if present, by dialysis or diafiltration and concentration of the dispersion by conventional means. The resultant nanoparticulate dispersion can be utilized in solid or liquid dosage formulations.<br><br>
A general procedure for preparing the drug nanoparticles of the invention is set forth below. The active ingredient is either obtained commercially or prepared by techniques known in the art in a conventional coarse form. It is preferred, but not essential, that the particle size of the selected drug be less than about 100 |im as determined by sieve analysis. If the coarse particle size of the drug is greater than about 100 |im, then it is preferred that the drug particles be reduced in size to less than about 100 |im using a conventional milling method, such as airjet or fragmentation milling, prior to reducing the particulate drug to submicron particle size.<br>
The coarse drug particles can then be added to a liquid medium in which the drug is essentially insoluble to form a premix. The concentration of the drug in the liquid medium can vary from about 0.1 to about 60%, but is preferably from about 5 to about 30% (w/w). It is preferred, but not essential, that the surface stabilizer is present in the premix. The concentration of the surface stabilizer can vary from about 0.1 to about 90%, but it is preferably from about 1 to about 75%, and more preferably from about 20 to about 60%, by weight based upon the total combined weight of the active ingredient and surface stabilizer. The apparent viscosity of the premix suspension is preferably less than about 1000 centipoise.<br>
The premix can be used directly by subjecting it to mechanical means to reduce the average particle size in the dispersion to less than about 1000 nm, preferably, less than about 400 nm, more preferably, less than about 250 nm, and most preferably, less than about 100 nm. It is preferred that the premix be used directly when a ball mill is used for attrition. Alternatively, the active ingredient, and optionally the surface stabilizer, can be dispersed in the liquid medium using suitable agitation, such as a roller mill or a Cowles-type mixer, until a homogeneous dispersion is observed. In a homogeneous dispersion, no large agglomerates are visible to the naked eye. It is preferred that the premix be subjected to such a premilling dispersion step when a recirculating media mill is used for attrition.<br>
The mechanical means applied to reduce the particle size of the active ingredient can be a dispersion mill. Suitable dispersion mills include, but are not limited to, a ball mill, an attritor mill, a vibratory mill, and media mills such as a sand mill or a bead mill. A media mill is preferred due to the relatively shorter milling time required to provide the desired reduction in particle size. For media milling, the apparent viscosity of the premix is preferably from about 100 to about 1000 centipoise. For ball milling, the apparent viscosity of the premix is preferably from<br><br>
about 1 to about 100 centipoise. Such ranges tend to afford an optimal balance between efficient particle fragmentation and media erosion.<br>
The attrition time can vary widely and depends primarily upon the particular mechanical means and processing conditions selected. For ball mills, processing times of up to five days or longer may be required. Using a high shear media mill, processing times of less than 1 day (residence times of from one minute up to several hours) have provided the desired results.<br>
The drug particles must be reduced in size at a temperature which does not significantly degrade the active ingredient. Processing temperatures of less than about 30-40°C are ordinarily preferred. If desired, the processing equipment can be cooled with conventional cooling equipment. Generally, the methods of the invention can be conveniently carried out under conditions of ambient temperature and at processing pressures which are safe and effective for the milling process. For example, ambient processing pressures are typical of ball mills, attritor mills, and vibratory mills. Control of the temperature, for example, by jacketing or immersion of the milling chamber in ice water, is encompassed by the invention.<br>
Processing pressures from about 1 psi (0.07 kg/cm2) up to about 50 psi (3.5 kg/cm2) are encompassed by the invention. Processing pressures typically range from about 10 psi to about 20 psi.<br>
The surface stabilizer, if not present in the premix, must be added to the dispersion after attrition in an amount as described for the premix above. Thereafter, the dispersion can be mixed by, for example, shaking vigorously. Optionally, the dispersion can be subjected to a sonication step using, for example, an ultrasonic power supply. In such a method, the ultrasonic power supply can, for example, release ultrasonic energy having a frequency of about 20 to about 80 kHz for a time of about 1 to about 120 seconds.<br>
After attrition is completed, the grinding media is separated from the milled particulate product using conventional separation techniques, such as by filtration, sieving through a mesh screen, and the like. The surface stabilizer be added to the milled particulate product either before or after the milled product is separated from the grinding media.<br>
In a preferred grinding process, the particles are made continuously. In such a continuous method, the slurry of active ingredient/surface stabilizer and optionally an additional surface stablizer is continuously introduced into a milling chamber, the active ingredient is continuously contacted with grinding media while in<br><br>
the chamber to reduce the particle size of the active ingredient, and the active ingredient is continuously removed from the milling chamber. The surface stabilizer, either alone or in conjunction with one or more additional surface stabilizers, can also be continuously added to the media chamber along with the active ingredient, or it can be added to the active ingredient which is removed from the chamber following grinding.<br>
The resulting dispersion of the present invention is stable and comprises the liquid dispersion medium described above. The dispersion of surface stabilizer and nanoparticulate active ingredient can be spray dried, spray coated onto a solid support such as cellulose spheres or sugar spheres or other pharmaceutical excipients using techniques well known in the art.<br>
The grinding media for the particle size reduction step can be selected from rigid media which is preferably spherical or particulate in form and which has an average size of less than about 3 mm and, more preferably, less than about 1 mm. Such media can provide the desired drug particles of the invention with shorter processing times and impart less wear to the milling equipment. The selection of material for the grinding media is not believed to be critical. Zirconium oxide, such as 95% ZrO stabilized with yttrium and 95% ZrO stabilized with magnesia, zirconium silicate, and glass grinding media have been found to provide particles having acceptable minimal levels of contamination for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions. Other media, such as stainless steel, titania, and alumina can also be used. Preferred grinding media have a density greater than about 3 g/cm^.<br>
The grinding media can comprise particles, preferably spherical in shape, such as beads, consisting of essentially polymeric resin. Alternatively, the grinding media can comprise particles having a core with a coating of the polymeric resin adhered thereto. The media can range in size from about 0.1 to about 3 mm. For fine grinding, the particles preferably are from about 0.2 to about 2 mm, and more preferably, from about 0.25 to about 1 mm in size.<br>
The polymeric resin can have a density from about 0.8 to about 3.0 g/cm^. Higher density resins are preferred as such resins can provide more efficient particle size reduction.<br>
In general, polymeric resins suitable for use in the present invention are chemically and physically inert, substantially free of metals, solvent, and monomers, and of sufficient hardness and friability to enable them to avoid being chipped or crushed during grinding. Suitable polymeric resins include, but are not<br><br>
limited to, cross-linked polystyrenes, such as polystyrene cross-linked with divinylbenzene, styrene copolymers, polycarbonates, polyacetals such as Delrin®, vinyl chloride polymers and copolymers, polyurethanes, polyamides, poly(tetrafluoroethylenes), such as Teflon® and other fluoropolymers, high density polyethylenes, polypropylenes, cellulose ethers and esters such as cellulose acetate, polyhydroxymethacrylate, polyhydroxyethyl acrylate, silicone containing polymers such as polysiloxanes, and the like. The polymer can also be biodegradable. Exemplary biodegradabe polymers include, but are not limited to, poly(lactides), poly(glycolide) copolymers of lactides and glycolide, polyanhydrides, poly(hydroxy-ethyl methacylate), poly(imino carbonates), poly(N-acylhydroxyproline)esters, poly(N-palmitoyl hydroxyproline) esters, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, poly(orthoesters), poly(caprolactones), and poly(phoshazenes). For biodegradable polymers, contamination of the resultant composition from the media itself can advantageously metabolize in vivo into biologically acceptable products that can be eliminated from the body.<br>
The grinding media is separated from the milled particulate active ingredient using conventional separation techniques in a secondary process, such as by filtration, sieving through a mesh filter or screen, and the like. Other separation techniques such as centrifugation may also be employed.<br>
As used herein, particle size is determined on the basis of the average particle size as measured by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art, such as sedimentation field flow fractionation, photon correlation spectroscopy, or disk centrifugation. When photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) is used as the method of particle sizing, the average particle diameter is the Z-average particle diameter known to those skilled in the art. By "an average effective particle size of less than about 1000 nm," it is meant that at least 90% of the particles, by weight, have a particle size of less than about 1000 nm when measured by the above-noted techniques. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the effective average particle size is less than about 400 nm, more preferred is less than about 250 nm, and in an even more preferred embodiment, the effective average particle size is less than about 100 nm. It is preferred that at least 95% and, more preferably, at least 99% of the particles have a particle size less than the effective average, e.g., 1000 nm. In a particularly preferred embodiment, essentially all of the particles have a size of less than about 400 nm, in a more preferred embodiments, essentially all of the particles<br><br>
have a size of less than about 250 nm, and in a most preferred embodiment, essentially all of the particles have a size of less than about 100 nm.<br>
An exemplary process for preparing nanoparticulate active ingredients in a tablet formulation comprises: (1) using the method described below to obtain spray-dried nanoparticles of the desired active ingredient; (2) sieve-screening the spray-dried nanoparticles to obtain uniform particles of less than about 20 mesh; (3) blending the nanoparticulate active ingredient with tableting excipients; (4) compressing the uniform particles into tablets using a tableting apparatus; and (5) film coating the tablets.<br>
The spray drying process is used to obtain an "intermediate" nanoparticulate powder subsequent to the milling process used to transform the active ingredient into nanoparticles. In an exemplary spray drying process, the high-solids active ingredient nanosuspension and the surface stabilizer are fed to an atomizer using a peristatic pump and atomized into a fine spray of droplets. The spray is contacted with hot air in the drying chamber resulting in the evaporation of moisture from the droplets. The resulting spray is passed into a cyclone where the powder is separated and collected. Alternatives to spray drying include fluid bed granulation, spray dry granulation, rotogranulation, fluid bed/spray drying granulation, extrusion and spheronization.<br>
At the completion of the spray drying process, the collected spray-dried intermediate comprises the nanoparticles of the active ingredient suspended in a solid polymer matrix of the surface stabilizer. The moisture content of the intermediate is controlled by the operating conditions of the spray drying process. The characteristics of the nanoparticulate powder are critical to the development of a free flowing powder that can be blended with other excipients suitable for a directly compressible tablet formulation.<br>
Tablets can be made using a direct compression tablet process or using a roller compaction process. In an exemplary direct compression process, the spray-dried intermediate and stabilizer are sieved through a screen and the screened material is blended. The desired excipients are sieved and added to the blender. At the completion of blending, the contents of the blender can be discharged into a tared collection container and compression of tablet cores can be completed on a tablet press. The blended material can be fed into a feed hopper and force-fed into the die cavities using an automatic feeder. The tablet press operating conditions can be set to meet thickness, hardness, and weight specifications. Upon completion of the<br><br>
compression operation, a film-coating can be applied to the tablet cores using, for example, a Vector-Freund Hi-Coated machine.<br>
In an exemplary roller compaction process following the media milling process, the nanoparticulate drug suspension can be spray dried to form an intermediate. The spray dryer can be assembled in a co-current configuration using a rotary atomization nozzle and the nanosuspension can be fed to the rotary atomizer using a peristaltic pump. Acceptable spray-dried product has a moisture content which does not exceed 1.0% (w/w).<br>
A dry granulation operation can be used to manufacture tablets comprising the active ingredient. Required amounts of the active ingredient/surface stabilizer spray-dried intermediate and appropriate excipients can be screened and blended. The blended material is then compacted using, for example, a roller compactor. The compacted material can then be granulated. Following granulation, additional excipients can be screened and blended with the granulation. The blended materials can then be compressed into tablets using a tablet press followed by coating.<br>

A specific manufacturing process is as follows:<br>
(a)	making a slurry preparation by dispersing the compound 2-(R)-(l-(R)-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)ethoxy)-3-(S)-(4-fluoro)phenyl-4-(3-(5-oxo-lH,4H-l,2,4-triazolo)methylmorpholine and hydroxypropyl cellulose-SL in water,<br>

(i)        blending with the addition of micronized sodium lauryl sulfate,<br>
(j)        subdivision of material, and<br>

The processes described herein may be employed by those skilled in the art to prepare nanoparticulate compositions with different dosage strengths of 2-(RMMR)-(3,5-bis(trifluoro^^<br><br>
oxo-lH,4H-l,2,4-triazolo)methylmorpholine (e.g. 25 mg, 40 mg, 50 mg, 80 mg, 100 mg, 125 mg, 150 mg, 160 mg, 250 mg, etc.)<br>
Compositions of Specific Drug Capsule Formulations<br><br>
A slurry of 35 kg (29 wt.%) 2-(R)-(l-(R)-(3,5-bis(trifluoro-methyl)phenyl)ethoxy)-3-(S)-(4-fluoro)phenyl-4-(3-(5-oxo-lH,4H-l,2,4-triazolo)methylmorpholine drug particles is prepared in an aqueous solution of hydroxypropyl cellulose-SL in a 150-L jacketed tank equipped with a 45° pitched blade turbine. The slurry is heated to approximately 70 °C and premilled at that temperature through an in-line Ikaworks mill to achieve particles having mean size less than 60 (am and D90 less than 150 jam. The premilled slurry is cooled to approximately 5 °C. An aqueous solution of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) is added to the premilled slurry. The suspended solids are then micronized using a 10-L media mill filled with polystyrene media to produce a colloidal dispersion consisting of approximately 138 nm mean particles. The resulting colloidal dispersion is then discharged and stored at 5 °C.<br>
An aqueous solution of sucrose is prepared using a 45° pitched blade turbine impeller in a 60-L tank. An amount of sucrose solution, which provides 1 to 1<br><br>
theoretical weight ratio of sucrose to 2-(R)-(l-(R)-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-ethoxy)-3-(S)-(4-fluoro)phenyl-4-(3-(5-oxo-lH,4H-l,2,44riazolo)methylmoipholine, is mixed with the colloidal dispersion using a 45° pitched blade turbine Lightnin mixer in the two stainless steel drums to obtain a 20 wt.% drug colloidal coating dispersion. The coating dispersions prepared using two milled batches (steps 1 to 5) are then filtered through an in-line 30 ^m polypropylene filter. The filtering step is conducted to remove any potential attrited media generated during the media milling step. The coating dispersions from the two milled batches are then mixed in a 347-L tank using a 3-blade marine propeller Lightnin mixer to obtain a uniform colloidal coating dispersion.<br>
The coating dispersion is sprayed onto microcrystalline cellulose (celphere) substrate spheres to a target weight gain of 450 wt.% using a 24" Glatt Wurster coating column. The drug-coated beads are screened through a nominal 864 jam and 1532 jam sieve screen using a 30" Sweco sieve to remove the fines ( 1532 jam) generated, respectively, which may have been generated during the coating process. The drug-coated beads between approximately 864 jam and approximately 1532 p.m are blended with jet-milled sodium lauryl sulfate using a 300-L Bohle blender. The blended coated beads from the blender are discharged into batches or subbatches as desired.<br>
A subbatch of the blended beads is filled into hard gelatin capsules to the target fill weight to provide 125-mg dose capsules. The target fill weight is based on the measured assay. Encapsulation is performed using a Bosch GKF 1500 capsule filler equipped with a pellet feeder and a 10 mm dosing chamber set for the #1 capsule size. Dosage forms of 25 mg, 40 mg, 50 mg, 80 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 160 mg and 250 mg are prepared in an identical manner, but using a different size and fill weight of capsule.<br>
Slurry Preparation &amp; Premilling: Place 77.61 kg USP Water at room temperature in a 150-L tank. With a 45° pitch-blade turbine rotating at approximately 175 rpm, add 7.000 kg of Hydroxypropyl Cellulose-SL (HPC-SL) slowly into the tank. Ensure that the liquid surface maintains a vortex during the HPC-SL addition by increasing the agitator speed if needed. Continue agitation for 90 minutes after HPC-SL addition to ensure that the HPC-SL is dissolved in water. With the 45° pitch-blade turbine rotating at approximately 200 rpm, add 35.00 kg 2-(R)-(l-(R)-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)ethoxy)-3-(S)-(4-fluoro)phenyl-4-(3-(5"Oxo-lH,4H-l,2,4-triazolo)methylmorpholine slowly into the tank. Ensure that the liquid surface<br><br>
maintains a vortex during the compound addition by increasing the agitator speed if<br>
needed. Mix the slurry for 30 minutes at approximately 200 rpm. Initiate premilling<br>
of the slurry by flowing the slurry through the Ikaworks premill. Measure the drug<br>
particle size during premilling. Initiate cooling of the slurry to 5 °C. The mixing<br>
speeds is maintained to ensure that the liquid surface is not vortexing, yet provide<br>
adequate mixing in the tank (i.e., fluids movement at the tank wall).	After the<br>
slurry has reached less than 30 °C, stop the premilling. Prepare the sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) solution by placing 948.5 g USP Water at room temperature in a stainless steel container with Lightnin stirrer rotating at approximately 400 rpm. Add 135.5 g SLS slowly into the stirred USP water and mix for 15 minutes. Add the SLS solution slowly to the 5 °C slurry in the tank with tank agitator rotating at approximately 200 rpm and mix for 15 minutes.<br>
Media Milling: Ensure that the mill filter housing is equipped with 150 jam screen. Add 5.60 kg (approximately 87.5% media load) polymeric media into the mill. Initiate media milling of the slurry by circulating the slurry through the mill and starting the LMZ-10 mill agitator rotation. Conduct the milling with the slurry flow rates, slurry flow rate ramp rates, mill agitator speeds, and mill agitator speed ramp rates values essentially as listed below.   Maintain the slurry/dispersion in the tank at 5 °C and the agitator speed at 200 rpm during the entire media milling run. Media milling parameters:<br><br><br><br>
Measure the drug particle size during media milling. The target particle size distribution is the average of the mean of three different samples is less than 138 nm the mean of each of the three samples is less than 144 nm the average of the D90 of the three samples is less than 216 nm the D90 of each of the three samples is less than 228 nm. Stop media milling (by shutting off the mill agitator rotation and dispersion circulation) only after confirming reduction to the above target particle size distribution. Discharge the colloidal dispersion into two stainless steel drums, seal the drums, and store them at 5 °C.<br>
Sucrose Solution &amp; Colloidal Coating Dispersion: For each batch of the colloidal dispersion, the amount of sucrose and USP water required for preparing the sucrose solution will depend on the assay and the amount of colloidal dispersion recovered after the milling process. The targeted drug concentration of the coating dispersion is 20 wt.% with the theoretical weight ratio of sucrose to 2-(R)-(l-(R)-(3,5-bis(trifluoro-methyl)phenyl)ethoxy)-3^S)-(4-fluoro)phenyl-4
Place the determined amount of USP Water in a 60-L tank. With the 45° pitch-blade turbine rotating at approximately 75 rpm, add the determined amount of sucrose slowly into the 60-L tank. Continue agitation for 90 minutes after sucrose addition to ensure that the sucrose is dissolved in water. Remove the drum of colloidal dispersion from cold storage. Start stirring the colloidal dispersion using the Lightnin mixer. Drain out amount of sucrose solution required for colloidal<br><br>
dispersion into a stainless steel container. Pour this sucrose solution slowly into the drum with continuous agitation and mix for 60 minutes. Transfer the coating dispersion from drum into another stainless drum through an in-line approximately 5 ft 30 (im polypropylene capsule filter. Seal the drum containing the filtered coating dispersion and store it at 5 °C until transferred for coating.<br>
Wurster Column Coating: Vacuum load 23.6 kg Microcrystalline cellulose spheres or celphere into a 24" coating column equipped with B &amp; #0 base plates, 1.5 mm Schlick nozzle, 100 mesh screen on the base plates, 69 mesh exhaust filter, high-speed insert, insert extension, 40 mm partition gap, and two NIR probes in the annulus. Initiate heating of the celphere at an inlet process air flow rate of 900 scfrn, temperature at 80 °C, and dew point at 12 °C. Maintain the atomizing air flow at 5 scfin during the heating period. Initiate coating with atomizing air flow rate at 25 scfm when the bed temperature exceeds 70 °C. Maintain the inlet air flow rate between 500 and 2500 scfm and spray rate profiles between 200 and 900 g/min during coating. Stop spraying when an appropriate coating dispersion has been sprayed. Reduce the atomizer air to 5 scfm and dry the coated beads for 5 minutes using inlet process air at 80 °C, 900 scfm, and 12 °C dew point. After 5 minutes of drying, initiate cooling by reducing the inlet process air flow rate temperature to 25 °C. Stop the air flow when the bed temperature reaches less than 45 °C. Discharge the coated beads into fiber drum lined with double polyethylene bags.<br>
Sieving: Set a 30" Sweco sieve shaker with 864 jam screen below the 1532 jim screen. With the sieve shaker vibrating, manually pour all the coated beads slowly above the 1532 |j.m screen. Collect the coated beads less than 864 jam, between 864 jam and 1532 jam, and above 1532 jam separately into fiber drums lined with double polyethylene bags. Seal the drum and store until further processing.<br>
Blending:   Load the coated beads (between 864 jam and 1532 jim) into a 300-L Bohle blender. Screen 260 g micronized/jet-milled sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) through a 60 mesh screen on top of the coated beads in the blender. (The SLS is micronized to minimize its segregation from the coated beads.) Blend the coated beads with the micronized sodium lauryl sulfate by rotating the blender at 6 rpm for 15 minutes. Discharge the blended beads into six sub batches of 41.5 kg, 27.0 kg, 22.0 kg, 13.5 kg, 13.0 kg, and remainder (approximately 13.0 kg) into six fiber drums lined with double polyethylene bags. Store the blended beads until further processing.<br>
Encapsulation: Set a Bosch GKF 1500 encapsulator with a pellet feeder and a 10 mm dosing chamber for the particular capsule size. Set the<br><br>
encapsulates speed at 75 stations per minute. Load the capsules into the capsule hopper. Load the blended beads into the pellet feeder hopper. Determine the target fill weight based on the assay of the blended coated beads and the target capsule fill weight. Start the encapsulation after adjusting the chamber volume to achieve the target filled capsule weights at 75 stations per minute encapsulator speed. Maintain the target filled capsule weight within the above upper and lower limits. If necessary, adjust the chamber volume to maintain the desired target weight. Discharge the filled capsules into fiber drums lined with double polyethylene bags. Store the capsule product until they are transferred for packaging.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be administered to humans and animals in any pharmaceutically acceptable manner, such as orally, via pulmonary route, rectally, parenterally (intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous), intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, locally (powders, ointments or drops), or as a buccal or nasal spray.<br>
For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the nanoparticulate composition is mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier, e.g. conventional tableting ingredients such as corn starch, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate or gums, and other pharmaceutical diluents, e.g. water, to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention, or a non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation composition is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from 0.1 to about 500 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention. The tablets or pills of the novel composition can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol and cellulose acetate.<br><br>
The clinical tablet formulations of compound 2-(R)-(l-(R)-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl^<br>
triazolo)methylmorpholine showed significant food effects on absorption, suggesting that formulation could have a significant role in improving bioavailability. A Beagle dog model was developed in an effort to guide novel formulation development. Using the suspension of the micronized bulk drug used for the tablet formulations, the food effect on absorption was confirmed in the dog at a similar magnitude to that observed in humans. Further dog studies demonstrated a clear correlation between particle size and in vivo exposures, with the nanoparticle (NanoCrystal) colloidal dispersion formulation providing the highest exposure, suggesting dissolution-limited absorption..<br>
Table 1 ;Pharmacokinetic parameters following oral administrations in Beagle dogs (N -■ 5) of conventional suspension and NanoCrystal dispersion formulations of compound under fed and fasted conditions.<br><br>
For the treatment of the clinical conditions and diseases noted above, the formulations of this invention may be administered orally, topically, parenterally, by inhalation spray or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutical^ acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection or infusion techniques. The NanoCrystal dispersion eliminated the food effect on oral absorption in the dog at a dose of 2 mg/kg. Regional absorption studies using triport dogs indicated that the absorption of compound was limited to the upper gastrointestinal tract. These results provided strong evidence that the large increase in surface areas of the drug nanoparticles could overcome the narrow absorption window and lead to rapid in vivo dissolution, fast absorption, and increased bioavailability<br><br>
