HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/155, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai-400 020, State of Maharashtra, India<br><br>
The following specification describes the nature of this invention (and the manner in which it is to be performed)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
GRANTED<br>

SKIN   CARE  COMPOSITION   CONTAINING   PETROSELINIC  ACID<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to topical compositions for application to., human skin and to their use in improving .the condition and appearance of skin.        <br>
BACKGROUND OF THE - INVENTION<br>
Skin is subject to deterioration through dermatological disorders, environmental abuse (wind, air conditioning, and central heating) or through the normal aging process (chronoageing) which may be accelerated by exposure of skin to sun (photoageing).  In recent years the demand for cosmetic compositions and cosmetic methods for improving the appearance and condition of skin has grown enormously.<br>
Consumers are increasingly'seeking "anti-ageing" cosmetic products that treat :.or delay the visible signs of. chronoageing'and; photoageing; skin ;.such as wrinkles, lines, sagging, hyperpigmentation and age spots.<br>
Consumers also frequently seek other benefits from cosmetic products in addition to anti-ageing.  The concept of "sensitive skin" has also raised the consumer demand for cosmetic products that improve the appearance and condition of sensitive, dry and/or flaky skin and to soothe red,<br><br>
and/or irritated skin.  Consumers also desire cosmetic products that have an oil/sebum control effect-. Many people are concerned with the degree of pigmentation of their skin.  For example, people with age spots or freckles may wish such pigmented spots to be less pronounced.  Others may wish to reduce the skin darkening, caused by-exposure, to. sunlight or to lighten their natural skin colour.  To meet this need many attempts have been made to develop products that  reduce- the,pigment,.production,-in. the melanocytes. However, the substances thus far identified tend to have undesirable side effects, e.g. skin irritation.<br>
Consequently such substances are not suitable for cosmetic use or the.y can only be applied at a concentration at which<br>
| their skin lightening effect is less than desired.  Using a combination of different skin lightening substances may be considered to reduce adverse side effects but there is a substantial risk that by using such a combination the skin lightening is reduced as well due tc competition effects<br>
 Therefore there is -a need for improvement in the effectiveness.'of cosmetic skin lightening products : particularly, such; that -they do not irritate1-the "-sklnv •'<br>
The use of fatty acids, including petroselinic acid, in cosmetic formulations for treating the hair is  known. EP-A-116439) describes hair tonics which include fatty acids (such...as.,..petr.oseliai.c.acid) for alleviating dandruff and itch and for stimulating hair growth.<br><br>
EP-A 709084 describes the' use of coriander seed oil, which is rich in petroselinic acid triglycerides, in a cosmetic composition for moisturising dry skin conditions. Retinol (vitamin A) is an endogenous compound that occurs naturally in the human body and is essential for normal epithelial cell differentiation. Natural and synthetic vitamin A. derivatives, (retinoids)! have been used extensively in the ^treatment of a variety of .skin disorders arid have been used as akin..repair,. or renewal, agentt.S. , Retional. acid for example, has been  employed to treat a variety of skin conditions, e.g., acne, wrinkles, psoriasis, age spots and discoloration. See e.g., Vahlquist, A. et al., J. Invest. Dermatol., Vol. 94, Holland D. B. and Cunliffe, W. J. (1990), pp. 496-498; Ellis, C. N. et al., "Pharmacology of Retinols in Skin", Vasel, Karger, Vol. 3, (1989), pp. 249-252; Lowe, N. J. et al., "Pharmacology of Retinols in Skin", Vol. 3, (1989), pp. 240-248, PCT Patent Application No. WO 93/19743.<br>
There .continues to be a:need .however, for alternative effectiv:e.:Cosmetic compositions for topical application to skin for. treating/delaying; the Ivisibile: sings of aging and . photodamaged skin such as wrinkles, lines, sagging, hyperpigmentation and age spots.<br>
We have now found that effective treatment and prevention of normal, (but cosmetically undesirable), skin conditions, due to chronoageing or photoageing, such as wrinkles, lines, sagging, hyperpigmentation and age spots, may be obtained through the application of cosmetic compositions to the   skin<br><br>
which comprise a specific fatty acid - petroselinic acid and/or derivatives thereof, in combination with a retinoid and/or an. inhibitor of the enzyme acyl CoA retinol transferase (ARAT) or the enzyme lecithin retinol acyl transferase (LRAT) (hereinafter referred to as LRAT/ARAT inhibitors).  We have also found that the use of such cosmetic compositions advantageously provides further skin, care benefits' in addition to anti-ageing such as soothing sensitive and:/or irritated; s.Jcia,, controlling .oil/sebum, secretion and for lightening the skin.<br>
The arc discussed above does not disclose the specific synergistic combination of petroselinic acid with retinoids/LRAT/ARAT inhibitors nor the use of such a specific combination for treating wrinkles sensitive skin, dry skin, controlling oil/sebum secretion, or lightening skin.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION^: - ■<br>

)ETATLED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
^Petroselinic acid<br>
i<br>
: Petroselinic acid (hereinafter referred to as PA) is a monounsaturated long chain (C18) fatty acid, having the . formula •CH3.(CH2)10 CH=CH(CH2)4COOH.<br>
The. invention, also includes derivatives; of' ther free.a.acid which thus comprise petroselinic acid moieties.  Preferable rderivatives include those derived from substitution of the [ carboxyl group of the acid, such as esters (eg triglyceride esters, monoglyceride esters, diglyceride esters, phosphoesters) amides (eg ceramide derivatives), salts (eg alkali metal and alkali earth metal salts, ammonium salts) and/or those derived from substitution of the C18 carbon chain, such as alpha hydroxy and/or beta hydroxy derivatives.<br>
In the Case of 'triglyceride' ester derivatives, all positional is:orners of PA substituents :on the glycerol,' backbone are'incl'udedi..  The triglycerides !mus!t; contain ;at :, least one PA moiety.  For example, of the three esterifiable positions on tfte glycerol backbone, the 1 and 2 positions may be esterified with PA and by another lipid at position 3 or as an alternative, the glycerol backbone could be esterified by PA at the 1 and 3 positions with another lipid at position 2.<br><br>
Oils that are rich in petroselinic acid triglyceride are thus also suitable for use in the present invention.  Such oils are commercially available and include parsley seed oil, carrot seed on, fennel fruit oil, parsnip seed oil, coriander seed oil,, chervil seed oil, caraway plant oil, and celery seed oil.<br>
Wherever the:.term "petroselinic acid" or "PA" is used in this- specification, it is. to be understood that the derivatives thereof comprising.PA moieties are also included.  "PA moieties" "refers to PA fatty acyl portion(s) of a PA derivative;<br>
The PA to be .employed in accordance with the present invention is present in the topical composition in an effective amount.  Normally the total amount of the active is present in an amount between 0.0001% and 50% by weight of the composition.  More preferably the amount is from 0.01% to' 101 and-..most". preferably the amount 0.1% to 5:% • in-order-, to. maximize benefits at a  minimum cost.<br>
Retionid<br>
The term "retinoid' inter alia  includes retinoic acid, retinoyl ester, retinoi; ret.inyl ester.<br>
The term "retinoi" includes the following isomers of retinoi: all-trans-retinol, 13-cis-retinol, 11-cis-retinol, S-cis-retinol, 3, 4--didehydro-retinoi. Preferred isomers are all-trans-retinol, 13-cis-retinol, 3,4-didehydro-retinol, 9-<br><br>
icis-retinol. Most preferred is all-trans-retinol, due to its 'wide commercial availability.<br>
Retinyl ester is an ester of retinol.  The term "retinol" has been defined above.  Retinyl esters suitable for use in<br>
the prese-nt.-. invention, are-C-I-GJO:- <br>
preferably C2-C20 esters, and most preferably C2-C3, and C3.6'<br>
esters because they are more' commonly available. The preferred esters for use i'n the present invention are selected.from, retinyl palmitate, retinyl acetate, retinyl propionate and retinyl linoleate, because.these are the most commercially available and therefore the cheapest. Retinyl ester is also preferred .due to its- efficacy.<br>
Retinoyl ester is an ester of retinoic acid. Retinoyl esters suitable for use in the -present' invention include C1-C30 esters of retinoic acid, preferably C2-C2o esters and most<br>
preferably- c2-o3and: c16   The--pre-ferned1- esters for user<br>
in 'the present invention -are-selected from- retinoyl -linoleate, retinoyl palmitate, retinoyl oleate, retinoyl ascorbate,:- and retinoyl ; linolenaite-.<br>
LRAT/ARAT Inhibitor<br>
Retinol is an endogenous compound that occurs naturally in the human body and is essential for normal epithelial cell differentiation. Esters of retinol hydrolyze in-vivc to produce retinol. It is believed that retinyl esters and retinol are metabolically converted in the skin into retinoic acid according to the following mechanism<br><br>
Retinyl Ester   Retinol<br>
Retinoic Acid<br>
However, most of the- errdogenously applied-"retinol is' rapidly converted into inactive fatty esters for storage in epidermal • cells, (keratinocytes) .<br>
Esterification of retinol into inactive retinyl esters is achieved in cells by transfer of a fatty acyl group from an acyl CoA, catalyzed by the enzyme acyl CoA retinol transferase (ARAT), or'by the transfer of an acyl group from phosphatidyl choline, catalyzed by the enzyme lecithin retinol.acyl transfrence (LRAT) These.esterification. reactions are very, efficient .in keratinocytes-the majority. (95%) of cellular retinoids are in the form of retinyl,fatty esters.<br>
The term "LRAT/ARAT inhibitor" in the present application thus means an agent which inhibits these esterification reactions and thus potentiates the action of retinol by increasing the amount of retinol available for conversion to retinoic acid.<br>
The LRAT/ARAT inhibitors within the scope of the present invention are identifiable as those compounds which at<br><br>
100 μM concentration inhibit at least 20% of LRAT cr ARAT catalyzed retinol esterification as measured by the in vitro Microsomal Assay described below in Example 1.  In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the LRAT/ARAT inhibitor is a compound that at 100 uM concentration inhibits at least 40% and' most perferablet at least 5:0r%! of LRAT or ARAT catalysed retinol esterification. The in vitro Microsomal'. Assay, employed,.for determining, whether' cr no.ta, compound' is. such. a. .LRAT./ARAT;.'. inhibitor is as', described in Example 1 below.<br>
Thus if a compound passes this in vitro Microsomal assay, that is, it inhibits sufficiently an LRAT or ARAT catalysed retinol esterification as measured by the in vitro Microsomal Assay, it is included in the present invention Bven if it is not specifically mentioned herein.<br>
Examples of such LRAT/ARAT inhibitors which satisfy the assay described.' in Example. 1 include.' fatty; acid amides hydroxy ,fatty., acid amides, ceramides, melinamide, Lmida'-z.olidin.O;ne.s., and. cyclic .aliphatic; unsaturated

his example demonstrates how LRAT/ARAT inhibitors within he scope of the present invention may be identified using he in vitro Microsomal Assay of the esterification of etinol.<br>
ie'thod of in vitro microsomal 'esterification' of retinol:<br>
Microsomes are obtained as described in J.;c.t Saari  and D.L.! redberg, "CoA and Non-CoA Dependent Retinol Esterification n Retinal Pigment Epithelium" J. Biol. Chem. 23, 8C34-90 1988).<br>
solution containing 0.1M sodium phosphate p.H 7 buffer, 5mM ithiothreitol, 2 rng/ml bovine serum albumin, 40 micromolar almitoyl CoA, 40 micromolar dilauroyl phosphatidyl choline,-0 micromolar retinol and a test compound or solven  blank,<br><br>
was-incubated for 1 hour at 37.c with a microsomal fraction isolated from bovine retinal pigment epithelial cells. After incubation, the reaction was quenched by addition of an equal volume of ethanol, and the retinyl esters formed (retinyl palmitate from the ARAT catalyzed reaction, and retinyl laurate from the LRAT catalyzed reaction) were extracted with hexane. The. hexane layer was removed, evaporated under nitrogen, and the residue analyzed by HPLC on a 3.9x300 mm' C18' revers.e.d.phas.e. column, using a 80% methanol, in. tetrahydrofuran mobile phase and fluorescence detection (325 nm excitation, 480 ran emission) to quantitate the retinyl esters. The quantity of ester formed in the presence of the solvent blank was taken as 100%, and this was used to calculate the percent inhibition of ester formation for the compounds tested. As a control, an aliquot of microsomes was inactivated.by boiling for 5 minutes, which resulted in at least 95% inhibition of ester formation.<br>

Identification of Procollagen-'I and Decorin Upregulation In Skin In Vivo Following Topical Retinoic Acid Treatment for Comparative. Ruxpos.es.:<br>
Collagen, the predominant matrix skin protein is known to impart tensile strength to skin.  Decorin is a proteoglycan<br><br><br>
which is known to be important for controlled and correct deposition of collagen in the extracellular matrix of skin. It is also known in the art that' the levels of collagen and decorin in skin are significantly reduced with aged and/or jphotodamaged skin.  Many studies have shown that the levels<br>
i<br>
of  collagen   type   I   in  skin  is  decreased with  age  and/or  with   increased- p.hotodarnage,    (for -example: Lav/ker,   R.<br>
J. Inv. Derm. , (.1979) ,73,.79-66;   Griffiths  et  al.   N.   Eng.. J.<br>
med. (1993)329, . 530-535)   In  the  case -of decorin-,:. it-has Ibeen  shown; that' mRNA  express! oirr and" expression, of  Che. proteoglycan   is  greatly reduced  in  photodamaged  skin   in itro   (3ernstein  et   al.   Lab.   Invest.    (1995)72,662-669).     The reduction  of   the  levels  of  these  skin  proteins  is •accordingly  associated with  a  decrease   in  the  tensile, 'strength of   the  skin   causing  wrinkles  and  laxity.<br>
lit   is  well   known  in   the  art  that   retinoic  acid  is   a  potent<br>
|anti-aging  active  and  induces  dermal   repair  of  photodamaged<br>
s.skin.     It   has  been   shown  that  wrinkle  effacement  and  dermal<br><br>
frep.air. foil owing topical, treatment- of s.kin.with: retinoic<br>
lacid arises through new collagen deposition and synthesis in<br>
!the skin (fox example, .Griffiths .et al.. N.. Eng. J. med.  (1993) 329, 530-535).  It is widely accepted that<br>
strengthening of the dermal matrix by boosting the level or<br>
collagen in skin using retinoic acid provides anti-ageing/dermal repair benefits.  Procollagen I is a precursor of collagen.  Increased production of procollagen I in response to a test compound application is a marker of an increased collagen level.<br><br><br>
Two groups of women were recruited with identical or nearly identical degrees of mild to moderate photodamage on each outer forearm.  They were supplied with 0.05% retinoic acid in a moisturising base (Retinova®) and also with a colour matched moisturising cream with similar sensory characteristics (Dermacar'e® lotion), but no active ingredients:, . as; a pi ace ho: contra]!'., Each' participant of. the two groups applied the Retinova® to one outer forearm and placebo (Dermacare®) to the other:outer forearm.  Group 1 applied the products daily to their outer forearms for 14 weeks and the Group 2 applied the products to., their outer forearms for 28 weeks.  At the end of the studies two full . thickness 4mm punch biopsies were taken from the treated areas of each forearm.  Immunohistochemical analysis of the biopsy tissue taken from the participants was performed to identify the effect of retinoic acid treatment on the expression of the skin extracellular matrix components, decorin and procollagen-I, as compared with the placebo treated- forearms.  The" following pxocedu're was followed:<br>
MATERIALS<br>
Antibody dilution buffer for wax sections was composed of Tris Buffered Saline (TBS), 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.05% Triton X-100 and 0.05% sodium azide.  Primary antibodies for procollagen-I (amino terminal) were obtained from Chemicon"International Inc. (cat# MAB 1912, rat IgGl) and  used   on wax sections   at a dilution of 1:300, overnight at 4°C after the section had been pre-treated with trypsin (0.5 mg/ml, 25 minutes, 37°C).  Primary antibodies for<br><br><br>
decorin were obtained from Biogenesis (rabbit polyclonal) and used on wax sections at a dilution of 1:800, overnight<br>
i<br>
iat 4°C.  Anti-rat biotinylated secondary antibodies, (Obtained from DAKO (cat# E0468, rabbit polyclonal), were 'applied to wax sections at a dilution of 1:400.  Anti-rabbit •biotinylated secondary antibodies, obtained from'Amersham (cat&gt;#. RPN.1004., donkey polyclonal ),.„, were., applied to wax. sections at a- dilution of 1:400.  Streptavidin conjugated  aLkaline phosphatase,, obtained from Zymed (cat# 43-4322), 'was used ast a conection of 1:2500   %       Fast Red chromogen was obtained from DAKO (cat# K597).  Gills #3 Haemotoxylin nuclear counterstain obtained from Sigma. (cat# GHS-3), was filtered and used without dilution.  Trypsin was obtained from Sigma (cat*.T-7186) and slides were mounted with Glycergel from DAKO (cat# C563)V<br>
METHODS  ' .<br>
Wax sections of the biopsy tissue were mounted on silane coated slides:'and baked for- 18: hours at 55°C . The slides were de-waxed- through xylene and alcohol and brought to -water and-.their transferred to TBS..  DAKO®, pen was used to , ring the section's. The  sections  were processed" for antigen retrieval using trypsin where necessary, as indicated for each antibody.  Where antigen retrieval was necessary, the slides were incubated for 25 minutes at 35°C with trypsin at 0.5 mg/ml (Sigma Cat # T-7186).  The protease was subsequently rinsed off (2x2 minutes) with TBS.  Following antigen retrieval, if necessary, or otherwise directly after ringing the sections, non specific antibody binding was blocked with 5% solutions of secondary antibody host serum<br><br>
in TBS/0.5% BSA/0.1% sodium azide as the blocking solution for at least. 20 minutes, at room temperature in a humid chamber.  The excess blocking solution was drained off, but the sections were not allowed to dry.  The sections were then incubated with the primary antibody (appropriately diluted as indicated above) in a humid chamber overnight at 4°C.  Antibody was. subsequently, drained from. the. section without allowing them to dry.  The slides were then washed with TBS to" remove unbound primary antibody - a one minute rinse.followed by  three  five.  minute .washes- and  then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (approoriately diluted as indicated above) in a humid • chamber for 1 hour at room temperature.<br>
The antibody solution was subsequently drained from the slides without allowing the section to dry.  The slides were washed in TBS, a one minute rinse followed by 4 x 5 min washes, in order to remove the unbound secondary antibody. For the biotinylated secondary antibody the sections were subsequently incubated with streptavidin conjugate- for-45 • minutes at 37°C and then washed in TBS to remove unbound streptavidin: conjugate.  The chromogen was added and the colour developed withi observation to.'avoid ; over staining The sections were then counterstained and mounted.<br>
Differences in the expression of procollagen-I and decorin between retinoic acid (Retinova®) and placebo (Dermacare®) treated sites-were—determined by visual assessment of the immunohistochemically stained sections using light microscopy:<br><br>
This analysis identified marked upregulation of both procollagen-I and decorin in the photodamaged skin following topical application of retinoic acid (Retinova®), as set out in. Table 5 below.<br>
Table 5<br>
Effect of Retinoic Acid Treatment on expression of procollagen I and decorin in skin In Vivo<br><br>

Procedure For Measuring Procollagen-I and Decorin Synthesis In Human Dermal Fibroblasts<br><br>
Preparation of Dermal Fibroblast Conditioned Medium<br>
■<br>
Primary human foreskin fibroblasts at passage 2 (P2) were seeded into 12-well plates at 10000 cells/cm2 and maintained for 24 hours- in an atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide and 4% oxygen in Dulbeccos Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) supplemented, with 1.0..% foetal calf serum.  After: this, time-,-the cells were washed with serum free DMEM and then incubated in. fresh serum free DMEM for a further 60 hours'. The fibroblast monolayers were then washed again with s'erum free DMEM.  Test reagents and vehicle controls were added to the cells in triplicate in a final volume of 0.4ml/well fresh serum free DMEM and incubated for a further 24 hours. This fibroblast conditioned medium was either analysed immediately or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C for future analysis.  The cells were then counted and data from the dot-blot analysis subsequently standardised to cell number.<br>
Example 4<br>
Dot Blot Assay for  P.rocollaqen-I and. Decorin Protein in Dermal Fibroblast Conditioned Medium<br>
Samples of conditioned medium from  dermal fibroblasts treated with vehicle (as a control) or test reagents were supplemented with 20mM dithiothreitol (1:10 dilution of 200mM stock solution) and 0.1% sodium dodecylsuiphate (1:100 dilution of 10% stock solution), mixed well and then incubated at 75°C for 2 minutes.  A standard for the assay was generated by serial dilution of neat fibroblast<br><br>
conditioned medium from fibroblasts seeded at 10000 cells/cm2<br>
2<br>
in a 175cm  flask and maintained in serum free DMEM as<br>
described above.<br>
Assay samples were subsequently applied in triplicate to a prewetted sheet of Immobilon-P transfer membrane using the ',  96-well Bio-Dot Apparatus' from Bio-Rad as described' in the manufacturers guidelines. Approximately 200ul of medium was applied per well The medium was allowed to filter through the membrane under gravity (JO minutes) after which the membrane was washed twice with  PBS (200(il) .  These P3S washes were allowed to filter through the membrane under gravity (2x15 minutes).  The Bio-Dot apparatus was then attached to a vacuum manifold and a third and final PBS wash carried out under suction.  The apparatus was disassembled, the membrane removed and quickly cut as required before being placed in blocking buffer overnight at 4°C. Membranes prepared for decorin analysis were blocked with 3% (w/v) BSA/ 0..1%' (v/;v) Tween 20: irr PBSv whilst thfosev for procollagen-! analysis., were .blocked with. 5-.% (w/.v). non.fat.   dried milk powder/ 0. 05% Tween 20 in PBS. •<br>
The following day, the membranes were probed with 1:10000 dilution of primary antibodies to either human procollagen-I (MAB1S12; rat monoclonal; Chemicon Int. Inc., Temecula, CA) or human decorin (rabbit polyclonal; Biogenesis) for 2 hours at room temperature.  The membranes were subsequently washed with T3S/ 0.05% Tween 20 (3 x 5 minutes) and then incubated with 1:1000 dilution of 125I-con j ugated anti-rat or anti-rabbit F(ab')2 fragments (Amersham) as required for 1 hour<br><br>
at room.temperature.  Following this the Immobilon strips were again washed with TBS/Tween 20 (3x5 minutes) before being allowed to dry in air at room temperature. The dried membranes were wrapped in cellophane and exposed to a Molecular Dynamics storage phosphor screen for 16-18 hours. At the end of this time the exposed screen was scanned by a pho.sphorimager (Molecular. Dyaamics Pho.sphorimag.er.. S.F.). using-ImageQuant™ software.  Dot intensity was assessed by computer-assisted image analysis using the quantification tools  in. ImageQuanttm standardised to cell number, and. the effects of various test reagents on decorin and procollagen-I synthesis-were determined relative to a vehicle treated control value of 100 arbitrary units.<br>
