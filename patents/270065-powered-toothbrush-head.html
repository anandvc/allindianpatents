				<td>POWERED TOOTHBRUSH HEAD<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a powered toothbrush head that includes an oscillating block having bristles extending therefrom. Various types of such powered toothbrushes are generally known in the art which provide for cleaning and massaging of both the soft and hard tissue of the mouth. Reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 5,625,916 which relates to an electrically driven toothbrush which includes a motor drive for rotating a drive shaft. The drive shaft is connected to a bristle holder on the head of the toothbrush in such a manner that rotation of the drive shaft causes the bristle holder to rotationally oscillate back and forth. Various other arrangements are known for oscillating a bristle holder mounted to the head of an electric toothbrush.<br>
Published PCT application WO 02/19942 discloses a motor-driven toothbrush with a conventionally oscillating, round facial cross-section brush head from which extend a plurality of bristles. The brush head is divided into a number of brush support segments, which segments are arranged so as to be displaced relative to each other, such that the angle of the bristles within each segment of the brush head will vary during use.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,046,213 discloses a manual toothbrush with a brush face having extending therefrom a combination of bristle tufts some of which are substantially perpendicular to the brush face, some of which tilt laterally inward toward the center of the face and some of which tilt laterally outward toward the nearest side of the brush face. This combination of multiply angled bristles is disclosed to provide a dynamic cleaning effect, as the bristles are forced in the direction of their angle, they will tend to spring out of crevasses within and between the teeth as stresses are exceeded to contain them in place. This dynamic cleaning effect will tend to fling plaque out of such crevasses.<br>
There is a need in the art for an electric toothbrush which contains a combination of moving and non-moving bristles, wherein at least some of the non-moving bristles are at different<br><br>
angles to provide the cleaning and massaging effects of an electric toothbrush and the dynamic cleaning effect of multiply angled non-moving bristles.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a powered toothbrush head with a face containing a combination of a conventional oscillating or rotating bristle block or section capable of delivering the cleaning and massaging benefit expected of a conventional powered toothbrush, in combination with a second bristle block or section containing plurality of non-moving bristles which are oriented at, at least, two or more angles to the face to provide a dynamic cleaning action.<br>
In accordance with this invention the toothbrush head has mounted on its face a conventional oscillating bristle block or section which has an outer surface, i.e. facial cross-section, that is generally circular or egg-shaped. This first bristle section is mounted in such a manner as to spin or oscillate back and forth preferably rotationally. The head includes a second bristle section, wherein the bristles are static or non-moving, i.e. mounted on a section of the brush face which is permanently fixed to the brush head. The second bristle section contains at least two sets of bristles oriented at different angles to the brush face.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates one practice of this invention wherein a toothbrush 10 includes a neck section 12 of a handle 13 and a head 14. The head 14/neck 12 may be replaceable, i.e. a refill head or the head 14/neck 12 section may be permanently attached to the handle 13 within the practice of this invention.<br>
As also illustrated in FIG. 2 a first moving bristle section or block 16 is mounted on head 14 with a plurality of bristles grouped into bristle tufts 20 extending generally perpendicular from the face 18 thereof. Bristle block 16 is preferably a generally circular type disk which may be mounted on a pin for rotation about a centrally located axis parallel to axis (not shown).<br><br>
Bristle block 16 is mounted for rotation or for oscillation in a back and forth manner as indicated by arrow 30. Any suitable drive structure could be used for oscillating tuft block 16, such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,000,083 or that disclosed in PCT publication WO 01/19281. A preferred type of drive structure is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,625,916, all of the details of which are incorporated herein by reference thereto. U.S. Pat. No. 5,625,916 includes a drive shaft which is driven from a motor in handle 13. The drive shaft terminates in a bent drive end located in a slot in tuft block 16. As the drive shaft is rotated, the uni-directional rotation of the drive shaft and the rotation of the drive end are transmitted to the bristle block 16 as a reciprocating rotational motion indicated by the arrow 30.<br>
As best seen in FIG. 2, head 14 includes a second section or bristle block 22 from which extend a plurality of fixed, static or stationary bristles group into tufts 24, at least two of which fixed, static or stationary bristles are oriented at different angles to the face 26 of the second bristle block 22. As shown in FIG. 2, one grouping of tufts are acutely angled to the face 26, located on the periphery of the brush head and splay out from the center of the brush head toward the sides thereof, and a second grouping of tufts are oriented perpendicular to the face 26. An alternative embodiment is shown in FIG. 3, wherein in addition to the splayed out peripheral bristles and perpendicular bristles, there is a set of bristles 28 which are acutely angled with respect to the face 26 in a direction toward the longitudinal centerline of the brush. In the practice of the present invention there may be a fourth and fifth grouping of differently angled bristles, each grouping differently angled with respect to the brush face 26, but oriented in a different direction with respect to the brush head 14, e.g. toward the toe 32 of the brush head 14, toward the neck 12, or in any direction therebetween.<br>
While FIGS. 1-3 illustrate the various bristle tufts to be of conventional fiber form, the terms "bristles", "tufts", or "bristle tufts" is intended to be used in a generic sense as cleaning elements or massage elements and could include, for example, elastomeric fingers or walls arranged in a circular cross-section shape or any type of desired shape or cross-section, including straight portions or sinusoidal portions.<br>
It is to be understood that the specific illustrations of the bristles is merely for exemplary<br><br>
purposes. The invention can, however, be practiced with various combinations of the same or different bristle configurations embedded in the brush head 14 by known technology, such as stapled technology or in-mold tufting technology using the same or different bristle materials (such as nylon bristles, spiral bristles, rubber bristles, etc.). Similarly, while FIGS. 1-3 illustrate the bristles on the generally circular moving bristle section 16 to be generally perpendicular to the outer surface 22 of head 14, some or all of the bristles moving bristle section tufts may be angled at various angles with respect to the outer surface of the moving bristle section 16. It is thereby possible to select the combination of bristle configurations, bristle materials and bristle orientations to achieve specific intended results, such as to deliver additional oral health benefits like enhanced cleaning, tooth polishing, tooth whitening and/or massaging of the gums.<br>
Although all of the bristles may be of the same length so that a planar brushing surface results from the various sections of head 14, the bristles could be of differing lengths. For example, the inner row of bristles 40 could be shorter than the outer row of bristles 42 on tuft block 16 so that a cup-like effect is produced which would help retain the toothpaste on the first tuft block 16.<br>
In the practice of the present invention, the first moving tuft section 16 may be located closest to the handle 12 and the fixed, non-moving tuft section 22 may be located closest to the toe 32 of the toothbrush. Alternatively the moving section may be located between two fixed, non-moving sections (one fixed section closest to the handle 12 and the other fixed section closest to the toe of the toothbrush 32)<br>
As illustrated in FIGS. 1-3 the face 18,26 of each of the sections of head 14 are coplanar so as to lie in a single plane. The invention may be practiced, however, where one or more sections may be in a parallel plane or even an inclined plane with respect to each other and/or with respect to the handle of the toothbrush 13.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
