FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a water purifier. More particularly, the invention relates to a mobile filter cartridge cum valve device adaptable as water purifiers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Water purification devices are known in the art. However, most of these devices suffer from the drawbacks that the filtration cartridge is of fixed depth and it is made up of just two layers of a single composite layer. In the. prior art cartridges, one layer comprises component which is generally claimed to make the water odour-free but is used in quantity which is insufficient to achieve the claimed effect. The other layer comprises a component which is a bactericidal and often an iodine based compound and therefore not totally for human body if used for long duration. Further, balanced quantity of either components is normally not used to achieve the claimed results.<br>
Further in order to make the water flow through the nozzle, in the inverted position, the device of the prior art has to be squeezed. When the pressure is released air flows into the bottle through the nozzle and the cartridge means. This makes the distribution of the chemicals containing in the layers non-uniform which phenomenon in fact stands in the way of using the required quantity particularly the chemicals being in granular form which contain as layer the bacterial medium. Thus, there remains a high probability of the bacteria in ambient air being sucked inside the device and disposed on the lower surface of the filter pad forming a lower boundary of the bactericidal layer. Formation of<br><br>
3<br>
such an additional lower boundary deteriorates the filtration capacity of the device and further jeopardizes the filtration quality of the water.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an obiect of the present invention to provide a mobile filter cartriage cum valve device adaptable as water purifier which eliminates the disadvantages associated with the prior art.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to provide a mobile filter cartridge cum valve device adaptable as water purifiers which can be easily manufactured and is cost-effective.<br>
These and other objects of the invention will be apparent from the ensuing description. At the outset of the description which follows, it is to be understood that the ensuing description only illustrates a particular form of this invention. However, such a particular form Is only an exemplary embodiment and the teachings of the invention is not intended to be taken restrictlvely.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a mobile filter cartridge-cum valve device adaptable as water purifier, comprising a bottle (8) having a lid cover (9); a filter cartridge means (1) releasable interposed in the lid cover (9), the lid cover (9) disposed on the top portion of the bottle (8) to encases the device, a valve means (11-18) Interposed in the middle portion of the bottle (8) to allow<br><br>
4<br>
inflow of ambient air inside tlie bottle, the valve means having an unidirectional flap (18) which allows exit of filtered water via an exit nozzle (19) upon squeezing of the bottle (8) in an inverted position characterized in that the filter-cartridge means (1) having a plurality of filtering layers (2-5) to purify the water Inputed in the device, and in that atleast top two layers (2, 3) of the plurality of filtering layers (2-5) comprises water-softening compound, the third layer having a compound to remove the odour, and the last layer (4) containing a bactericidal compound.<br>
The device comprises a bottle made of compressible material, a lid cover to close the bottle, a cartridge having a plurality of layers, preferably four layer, being separated by filter pads and accommodated in the lid cover. The layers .are fitted one above the other along the inner wall of the cartridge. According to an exemplary embodiment, the number of layers is four, wherein the topmost layer contains a water softening compound such as for example an Anion resin used for demineralization of water. The second layer contains a water softening compound such as a cationic resin. The third layer contains a compound for making odour-free. This compound is an absorbent such as activated coconut charcoal. The fourth layer which is the most critical feature of the cartridge feature of the cartridge device contains a bactericidal compound. A typical bactericidal compound used is silver oxide, although the invention is not limited thereto.<br>
The layers are supported on filter pads typically made from non-woven filter cloth, although not restricted thereto. The layers are supported by a wire mesh at the top of the first layer and below the last layer. Such a wire mesh is constructed from food grade plastic or any similar material. The valve means<br><br>
5<br>
provided at the inner wall of the bottom of the purifier device which allows water to flow out in the inverted position of the bottle without having to squeeze the latter and prevents back flow of water. An axial hole is disposed externally at an upper portion of the bottle to allow air-inflow when the bottle is squeezed invertedly.<br>
A typical valve means comprises a tube having a horizontal and vertical section. The vertical section of tube has a flap disposed at an end portion. The opening of the flap is unidirectional and thus prevents the back flow of water.<br>
The air flow into the purifier device through an extremity of the horizontal section of the valve which includes a plurality of washers and a tortoise-back shaped screw provided through an axial hole.<br>
The screw is releasably coupled to the wall of the purifier device and secures the washers to the tube of the valve means.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The invention will now be explained in greater detail with the help of the accompanying drawings where Figure 1 shows a lid cover (9) of the device. A cartridge (1) with atleast four layers (1-4) as releasably disposable on the lid-cover (9), the cartridge (1) having atleast two wire mesh at the top (6) and bottom (7) thereof. Figure 2 shows an isometric view of the cartridge device. A bottle (8) with a lid cover (9) basically constitutes the device. A screw with an axial hole (11, 12) is provided at the external portion of the bottle (8) preferably<br><br>
6<br>
at an upper end to allow in-flow of air when the bottle Is squeezed. The lid cover (9) accommodates the cartridge (1) having the filtering layers (1-4), the layers being supported by filter pads which can be supported and encaped by the top wire mesh (6) and the bottom wIre-mesh (7). Figure 3 shows the details of a valve means comprising a tube (16, 17) having a horizontal section (16) and a vertical section (17). The horizontal section (15) having a first axial hole (5) provided with an Inner washer (14) accommodating a screw with a second axial hole (12, 11) via an outer washer (13). The screw with the second axial hole (12, 11) Is configured to have a shape of tortoise-backed top. The vertical Section (17) of the tube is having an uni-dlrectional opening flap (18) disposed at the end of said vertical section (17). The flap (18) opens only outwardly to allow exit of filtered water when the device is inverted. To make the filtered water flow through an exit nozzle (19) provided on said lid cover (9), the bottle has to be squeezed In the inverted position. When the squeezing pressure Is released air flows in the bottle (8) through the second axial hole (11) of the valve means.<br><br>
