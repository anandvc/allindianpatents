				<td>DIBENZYLAMINE CXDMPOUNDS AND PHARMACBDTICAL USE THEREOF<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present, invention relates to a novel CETP activity Inhibitor, particularly a therapeutic agent or a prophylactic agent of arteriosclerosis or hyperlipidemia.<br>
Background Art:<br>
Regarding the relationship between arteriosclerotic iiseases and serum lipoprotein, it has been considered for some time that a certain relationship exists frcan the results )f many epidemiological researches. For exan^le, Badiraon et al. [J. Clin. Invest., 85, 1234-1241 (1990)) reported that .ntravenous injection of fractions containing HDL (high iensity lipoprotein) and VHDL (very high density lipoprotein) :o cholesterol-loaded rabbits resulted in the observation of lot only prevention of progression of arteriosclerotic lesion )ut also regression thereof, and HDL and VHDL are considered :o have an anti-arteriosclerotic action in the relationship )etween arteriosclerotic diseases and serum lipoprotein.<br>
In recent years, the presence of a protein that transfers ipid between blood lipoproteins, or CETP (cholesteryl ester ransfer protein), has been clarified.  The presence of CETP as first pointed out in 1965 by Nichols i  Smith (J. Lipid :es., 6, 206, 1965), and thereafter its cDtiA  was cloned in 987 by Drayna et al. The molecular weight thereof is 74,000 a  as glycoprotein and about 58,000 Da when sugar chain is ompletely cleaved.  Its cDNA consists of 1656 residues and ncodes 476 amino acids following 17 signal peptides. Since bout 44% thereof consists of hydrophobic amino acids, it has xtremely high hydrophobicity and is easily inactivated by xidation.  In addition, it has been confirmed that CETP is reduced in the organs such as liver, spleen, adrenal gland, dipose tissue, small intestine, kidney, skeletal muscle,<br>
^"<br>
r<br><br>
heart muscle and the like, and produced in cells of the cell types of human monocyte-derived macrophage, B lymphocyte, fat cell, small intestinal epithelial cell, CaCo2 cell, hepatocyte (exemplified by human liver cancer cell-derived cell line, HepG2 cells) and the like.  Besides the above-mentioned tissues it is present in cerebrospinal fluid and semen, and its presence has been confirmed in culture media of hviman neuroblastoma and neuroglioma cells, choroid plexus of sheep and the like.<br>
It has been also clarified that CETP is involved in the metabolism of any lipoprotein in living organisms, and has a major role in the reverse cholesterol transfer system. Namely, CETP has drawn attention as a mechanism for preventing accumulation of cholesterol in peripheral cells and preventing arteriosclerosis.  In fact, with regard to HDL having an important role in this reverse cholesterol transfer system, a number of epidemiological researches have shown that a decrease in CE (cholesteryl ester) of HDL in blood is one of the risk factors of coronary artery diseases.  It has been also clarified that the CETP activity varies depending on the mimal species, wherein arteriosclerosis due to cholesterol-Loading is hardly induced in animals with lower activity, and Ln reverse, easily induced in animals with higher activity, md that hyper-HDL-emia and hypo-LDL (low density Lipoprotein)-emia are induced in the case of CETP deficiency, ius rendering the development of arteriosclerosis difficult, ?hich in turn led to the recognition of the significance of )lood HDL, as well as significance of CETP that mediates iransfer of CE in HDL into blood LDL.<br>
Free cholesterol (FC) synthesized in and secreted from lie liver is taken up by very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). "hen, due to the action of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and lepatic triglyceride lipase (HTGL), VLDL is metabolized in<br><br>
blood into LDL via intermediate density lipoprorein (IDL). LDL is taken up by peripheral cells via an LDL receptor and FC is supplied to the cells.  Conversely from such flow from t±ie liver to the peripheral cells, there exists a flow of cholesterol from peripheral cells toward the liver, which is called a reverse cholesterol transfer system. In other words, FC accumulated in the peripheral tissues is drawn by HDL, further esterified on HDL by the action of LCAT (lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase) to form CE, and transferred to the hydrophobic core part of HDL, whereby HDL matures into spheric HDL particles.  CE in HDL is transferred by CETP present in blood to apoB-containing lipoproteins such as VLDL, IDL, LDL and the like, and in return, TG is transferred to HDL at a molar ratio of 1:1. CE transferred to apoB-containing lipoprotein is taken up by the liver via LDL receptor in the liver, thereby indirectly transferring cholesterol to the liver. Moreover, there is a mechanism in which HDL takes up apoprotein E secreted from macrophage and the like to become apoprotein E-containing HDL rich in CE, and then is directly taken up by the liver via LDL receptor or remnant receptor. There also exists a path in which HDL particles are not taken ap by the liver and only CE in HDL is selectively taken up by lepatocytes. Furthermore, another path exists in which HDL particles are taken up by hepatocytes via what is called an iDL receptor in the liver.<br>
Namely, in the state of enhanced CETP activity, since CE transfer from HDL increases, CE in HDL decreases, and CE in /LDL, IDL and LDL increases. When take up of IDL and LDL by ihe liver increases, down-regulation is imposed on the LDL receptor, and LDL in blood increases.  In contrast, in the CETP ieficient state, HDL draws cholesterol from peripheral cells tfith the aid of LCAT, gradually increases its size and icquires apo E. Then, apo E-rich HDL is taken up by the liver<br><br>
via LDL receptor in the liver and catabolized.  However, since tiiis mechanism"does not function sufficiently in human, large HDL dwells in the blood.  Consequently, cholesterol pool in the liver becomes smaller and up-regulation is imposed on the LDL receptor, thereby decreasing LDL. Accordingly, selective inhibition of CETP can lower IDL, VLDL and LDL that promote arteriosclerosis and increase HDL that acts suppressively thereon, and produces expectation for the provision of an unprecedented prophylactic or therapeutic agent for arteriosclerosis or hyperlipidemia.<br>
While many attempts have been made in recent years to develop a drug that inhibits such activity of CETP, a compound having a satisfactory activity has not been developed yet.<br>
Meanwhile, many reports have been found recently on the compounds aiming at inhibiting such activity of CETP.  For example. Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 223, 42-47 (1996) discloses dithiodipyridine derivatives, substituted dithiodibenzene derivatives and the like as :;ompounds that inactivate CETP by modifying cysteine residue, iowever, this reference does not contain any description of the compound of the present invention, not to mention a iescription suggestive thereof.<br>

In Table, arteriosclerotic index, ApoA-I content and HDL3 cholesterol content are shown based on the value of the control group as 100%.<br><br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
From the foregoing test results and the like, the<br><br>
compound and a salt thereof of the present invention have superior CETP activity inhibitory effect. Therefore, they can decrease IDL, VLDL and LDL that promote arteriosclerosis and increase HDL that acts suppressively. As a result, they are useful as prophylactic or therapeutic agents for hyperlipidemia. In addition, they are useful as prophylactic or therapeutic agents for arteriosclerotic disease and the like.<br>
Moreover, concurrent use of the confound of the present invention with a different therapeutic agent for hyperlipidemia (statin pharmaceutical agent) is expected to promote increase in HDL cholesterol, decrease arteriosclerotic index particularly remarkably, and show extremely superior synergistic effect. Therefore, it is clear that the compound of the present invention can be used concurrently with a different pharmaceutical agent, particularly other therapeutic agents for hyperlipidemia, arteriosclerosis, coronary artery disease, obesity, diabetes or hypertension.<br>
