Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to fused cyclic compounds, to methods of using such compounds in the treatment of nuclear hormone receptor-associated conditions such as cancer, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Nuclear hormone receptors (NHR's) constitute a large super-family of ligand-dependent and sequence-specific transcription factors. Members of this family influence transcription either directly, through specific binding to the promoter target genes (Evans, in Science 240: 889-895 (1988)), or indirectly, via protein-protein interactions with other transcription factors (Jonat et al., Cell 62: 1189-1204 (1990), Schuele et al., Cell 62: 1217-1226 (1990), and Yang-Yen et al., Cell 62: 1205-1215 (1990)). The nuclear hormone receptor super-family (also known in the art as the "steroid/thyroid hormone receptor super-family") includes receptors for a variety of hydrophobic ligands, including cortisol, aldosterone, estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, vitamine D3, thyroid hormone and retinoic acid (Evans, 1988, supra). In addition to these conventional nuclear hormone receptors, the super-family contains a number of proteins that have no known ligands, termed orphan nuclear hormone receptors (Mangelsdorf et al., Cell 83: 835-839 (1995), O'Malley et al., Mol. Endocrinol. 10: 1293 (1996), Enmark et al., Mol. Endocrinol. 10, 1293-1307 (1996) and Giguere, Endocrin, Rev. 20, 689-725 (1999)). The conventional nuclear hormone receptors are generally transactivators in the presence of ligand, and can either be active repressers or transcriptionally inert in the absence of ligand. Some-of-the<br><br>
orphan receptors behave as if they are transcriptionally inert in the absence of ligand. Others, however, behave as either constitutive activators or repressors. These orphan nuclear hormone receptors are either under the control of ubiquitous ligands that have not been identified, or do not need to bind ligand to exert these activities.<br>
In common with other transcription factors, the nuclear hormone receptors have a modular structure, being comprised of three distinct domains: an N-terminal domain of variable size containing a transcriptional activation function AF-1, a highly conserved DNA binding domain and a moderately conserved ligand-binding domain. The ligand-binding domain is not only responsible for binding the specific ligand but also contains a transcriptional activation function called AF-2 and a dimerisation domain (Wurtz et al., Nature Struc. Biol. 3, 87-94 (1996), Parker et al., Nature Struc. Biol. 3, 113-115 (1996) and Kumar et al., Steroids 64, 310-319 (1999)). Although the overall protein sequence of these receptors can vary significantly, all share both a common structural arrangement indicative of divergence from an ancestral archetype, and substantial homology (especially, sequence identity) at the ligand-binding domain.<br>
The steroid binding nuclear hormone receptors (SB-NHR's) comprise a subfamily of nuclear hormone receptors. These receptors are related in that they share a stronger sequence homology to one another, particularly in the ligand binding domain (LED), than to the other members of the NHR super-family (Evans, 1988, supra) and they all utilize steroid based ligands. Some examples of this sub-family of NHR's are the androgen receptor (AR), the estrogen receptor (ER), the progesterone receptor (PR), the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), the aldosterone receptor (ALDR) and the steroid and xenobiotic receptor (SXR) (Evans et a/., WO 99/35246). Based on the strong sequence homology in the LBD, several orphan receptors may also be members of the SB-NHR sub-family.<br>
Consistent with the high sequence homology found in the LBD for each of the SB-NHR's, the natural ligands for each is derived from a common steroid core. Examples of some of the steroid based ligands utilized by members of the SB-NHR's include cortisol, aldosterone, estrogen, progesterone, testosterone and<br><br>
dihydrotestosterone. Specificity of a particular steroid based ligand for one SB-NHR versus another is obtained by differential substitution about the steroid core. High affinity binding to a particular SB-NHR, coupled with high level specificity for that particular SB-NHR, can be achieved with only minor structural changes about the steroid core (e.g., Waller et al., Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 137, 219-227 (1996) and Mekenyan et al., Environ. Sci. Technol. 31, 3702-3711 (1997), binding affinity for progesterone towards the androgen receptor as compared to testosterone).<br>
Numerous synthetically derived steroidal and non-steroidal agonists and antagonists have been described for the members of the SB-NHR family. Many of these agonist and antagonist ligands are used clinically in man to treat a variety of medical conditions. RU486 is an example of a synthetic agonist of the PR, which is utilized as a birth control agent (Vegeto et al., Cell 69: 703-713 (1992)), and Flutamide is an example of an antagonist of the AR, which is utilized for the treatment of prostate cancer (Neri et al, Endo. 91,427-437 (1972)). Tamoxifen is an example of a tissues specific modulator of the ER function, that is used in the treatment of breast cancer (Smigel, J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 90, 647-648 (1998)). Tamoxifen can function as an antagonist of the ER in breast tissue while acting as an agonist of the ER in bone (Grese et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94,14105-14110 (1997)). Because of the tissue selective effects seen for Tamoxifen, this agent and agents like it are referred to as "partial-agonist" or partial-antagonist". In addition to synthetically derived non-endogenous ligands, non-endogenous ligands for NHR's can be obtained from food sources (Regal et al., Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 223, 372-378 (2000) and Hempstock et al., J, Med. Food 2,267-269 (1999)). The flavanoid phytoestrogens are an example of an unnatural ligand for SB-NHR's that are readily obtained from a food source such as soy (Quella et al., /. Clin. Oncol. 18, 1068-1074 (2000) and Banz et al., J. Med. Food 2, 271-273 (1999)). The ability to modulate the transcriptional activity of individual NHR by the addition of a small molecule ligand, makes them ideal targets for the development of pharmaceutical agents for a variety of disease states.<br>
As mentioned above, non-natural ligands can be synthetically engineered to serve as modulators of the function of NHR's. In the case of SB-NHR's, engineering<br><br>
of an unnatural ligand can include the identification of a core structure which mimics the natural steroid core system. This can be achieved by random screening against several SB-NHR's or through directed approaches using the available crystal structures of a variety of NHR ligand binding domains (Bourguet et al., Nature 375, 377-382 (1995), Brzozowski, et al., Nature 389, 753-758 (1997), Shiau et al., Cell 95, 927-937 (1998) and Tanenbaum et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95, 5998-6003 (1998)). Differential substitution about such a steroid mimic core can provide agents with selectivity for one receptor versus another. In addition, such modifications can be employed to obtain agents with agonist or antagonist activity for a particular SB-NHR. Differential substitution about the steroid mimic core can result in the formation of a series of high affinity agonists and antagonists with specificity for, for example, ER versus PR versus AR versus GR versus MR. Such an approach of differential substitution has been reported, for example, for quinoline based modulators of steroid NHR in J. Med. Chem., 41, 623 (1999); WO 9749709; US 5696133; US 5696130; US 5696127; US 5693647; US 5693646; US 5688810; US 5688808 and WO 9619458, all incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The compounds of the present invention comprise a core which serves as a steroid mimic, and are useful as modulators of the function of steroid binding nuclear hormone receptors, as well as other NHR as described following.<br>

The compounds of formula I form salts which are also within the scope of this invention. Reference to a compound of the formula I herein is understood to include reference to salts thereof, unless otherwise indicated.

In addition, when a compound of formula I contains both a basic moiety, such as but not limited to a pyridine or imidazole, and an acidic moiety such as but not limited to a carboxylic acid, zwitterions ("inner salts") may be formed and are included within the term "salt(s)" as used herein. Pharmaceutically acceptable (i.e., non-toxic, physiologically acceptable) salts are preferred, although other salts are also<br>
useful, e.g., in isolation or purification steps which may be employed during preparation. Salts of the compounds of the formula I may be formed, for example, by reacting a compound I with an amount of acid or base, such as an equivalent amount, in a medium such as one in which the salt precipitates or in an aqueous medium followed by lyophilization.<br>
The compounds of formula I which contain a basic moiety, such as but not limited to an amine or a pyridine or imidazole ring, may form salts with a variety of organic and inorganic acids. Exemplary acid addition salts include acetates (such as those formed with acetic acid or trihaloacetic acid, for example, trifluoroacetic acid), adipates, alginates, ascorbates, aspartates, benzoates, benzenesulfonates, bisulfates, borates, butyrates, citrates, camphorates, camphorsulfonates,<br>

The compounds of formula I which contain an acidic moiety, such but not limited to a carboxylic acid, may form salts with a variety of organic and inorganic bases. Exemplary basic salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as sodium, lithium and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases (for example, organic amines) such as benzathines, dicyclohexylamines, hydrabamines (formed with N,N-bis(dehydroabietyl)ethylenediamine), N-methyl-D-glucamines, N-methyl-D-glycamides, t-butyl amines, and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine and the like. Basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quatemized with agents such as lower alkyl halides (e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), dialkyl sulfates (e.g. dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl, and diamyl sulfates), long<br>
chain halides (e.g. decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), aralkyl halides (e.g. benzyl and phenethyl bromides), and others.<br>
Prodrugs and solvates of the compounds of the invention are also contemplated herein. The term "prodrug" as employed herein denotes a compound which, upon administration to a subject, undergoes chemical conversion by metabolic or chemical processes to yield a compound of the formula I, or a salt and/or solvate thereof. Solvates of the compounds of formula I include, for example, hydrates.<br>
Compounds of the formula 1, and salts thereof, may exist in their tautomeric form (for example, as an amide or imino ether). All such tautomeric forms are contemplated herein as part of the present invention.<br>
All stereoisomers of the present compounds (for example, those which may exist due to asymmetric carbons on various substituents), including enantiomeric forms and diastereomeric forms, are contemplated within the scope of this invention. Individual stereoisomers of the compounds of the invention may, for example, be substantially free of other isomers (e.g., as a pure or substantially pure optical isomer having a specified activity), or may be admixed, for example, as racemates or with all other, or other selected, stereoisomers. The chiral centers of the present invention may have the S or R configuration as defined by the IUPAC 1974 Recommendations. The racemic forms can be resolved by physical methods, such as, for example, fractional crystallization, separation or crystallization of diastereomeric derivatives or separation by chiral column chromatography. The individual optical isomers can be obtained from the racemates by any suitable method, including without limitation, conventional methods, such as, for example, salt formation with an optically active acid followed by crystallization.<br>
All configurational isomers of the compounds of the present invention are contemplated, either in admixture or in pure or substantially pure form. The definition of compounds of the present invention embraces both cis (Z) and trans (E) alkene isomers, as well as cis and trans isomers of cyclic hydrocarbon or heterocyclo rings. In certain cases, for example, the exo or endo conformation can be preferred for the fused ring system bonded to G-L in formula I. For example, for androgen receptor antagonists (or selective androgen receptor modulators), where Y is O or<br>
NR7, the exo configuration can be preferred, while for most other definitions of Y, the endo configuration can be preferred. As can be appreciated, the preferred configuration can be a function of the particular compound and its preferred activity. Separation of configurational isomers can be achieved by any suitable method, such as column chromatography.<br>
Throughout the specifications, groups and substiruents thereof may be chosen to provide stable moieties and compounds.<br>
Embodiments indicated herein as exemplary or preferred are intended to be illustrative and not limiting.<br><br>

Scheme II<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
As illustrated in Scheme II, compounds of formula I can be obtained by reaction of a primary amine of formula V with a substituted anhydride-like intermediate of formula VI, for example, in a solvent such as acetic acid with or without heating, to yield a compound of formula IV, which is a compound of formula I. Primary amines of formula V can be obtained from commercial sources or readily synthesized by one skilled in the art. Anhydride-like agents of formula VI can be obtained from commercial sources or readily synthesized by one skilled in the art. The documents listed following describe exemplary approaches for the synthesis of intermediates of formula VI as well as synthetic approaches which can be applied to the synthesis of compounds of formula IV (all incorporated herein by reference in their entirety): Kohler, E. P.; Tishler. M.; Potter, H.; Thompson, H. T. /. Am. Chem. Soc. 1939, 1057-1061; Yur'ev, Y. K.; Zefirov, N. S. J. Gen. Chem. U.S.S.R. (Engl.

The aforementioned approach(es) can be applied in a combinatorial fashion, for example, by utilizing a multi-well reaction block such as is described in Waldemar Ruediger, Wen-Jeng Li, John W., Allen Jr., and Harold N. Weller III, US Patent No. 5,961,925, Apparatus for Synthesis of Multiple Organic Compounds With Pinch Valve Block (incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). By utilizing the above-mentioned multi-well reaction block, one can, for example, perform multiples of 96 reactions at a time. Solvent can then be removed from the reaction tubes without removal from the reaction block and the crude products can be precipitated using a base such as sodium bicarbonate. The precipitates can be collected by filtration of the reaction block and then the desired products can be transferred directly to 96 well plates for screening. In this fashion, a large array of compounds of formula I can be synthesized, and tests conducted as desired by an automated approach.<br>
Scheme III<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Scheme HI describes a method for preparing an intermediate compound of formula VI which can be used to synthesize a compound of formula I, as described in Scheme II. As described in Scheme III, a diene of formula II can be reacted with a dieneophile of formula VII to yield the intermediate of formula VI. The methods applied to obtain such a transformation are analogous to those described in Scheme I.<br>
Scheme IV<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Scheme IV describes a method for preparing an intermediate compound of formula VI which can be used to synthesize a compound of formula I, as described in Scheme II. As shown in Scheme IV, a diene of formula II can be reacted with a dieneophile of formula VIII to yield the intermediate of formula IX. The intermediate of formula IX can be dehydrated to an anhydride-like intermediate of formula VI.   Dehydration of the bis-acid intermediate of formula IX to can be achieved by a variety of methods, such as those known to one skilled in the art and described in the following documents and the references embodied therein: Sprague et al, J. Med. Chem. 28, 1580-1590 (1985); and/or Retemi et al, J. Org. Chem. 61, 6296-6301 (1996).<br><br>
Schemes 1 to IV describe general methods for the synthesis of compounds of formula I, and intermediates thereof, in which substitution about the ring system is incorporated directly, for example, at the level of the intermediate diene, dienophile, anhydride-like intermediate and amine groups. In addition to these approaches, additional substitution can be incorporated onto an already-prepared compound of formula I by a variety of approaches to prepare other compounds of the formula I. Exemplary methods for further substitution are described in Schemes V to XI.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Scheme V describes one such approach to incorporating additional substitution into a structure of formula I. As illustrated in Scheme V, a compound of formula X, which is a compound of formula I where A, and A2 are CR7, W is NH— CHR7 and Y is CHR7—CHR7, can be functionalized at the free amine of the group W by reaction with any of a variety of electrophilic agents such as acid halides or alkyl halides in the presence of base, for example, by methods known by one skilled in the art. In Scheme V, X is a leaving group, and a compound of formula XI is a compound of formula I where A, and A2 are CR7, W is NR7—CHR7 and Y is CHR7— CHR7.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br><br><br>
Scheme VI describes an additional approach for further incorporating substitution onto a compound of formula I. As illustrated in Scheme VI, a compound of formula XII, which is a compound of formula I where A, and A2 are CR7, W is S— CHR7 and Y is CHR7—CHR7, can be partially oxidized with an oxidizing agent such as mCPBA or other agents such as those known to one skilled in the art, to give the sulfoxide analog of formula XIII, which is a compound of formula I where A, and A2 are CR7, W is SO—CHR7 and Y is CHR7—CHR7. Further treatment of a compound of formula XIII with an oxidizing agent such as mCPBA or other agents such as those known to one skilled in the art, can yield the sulphone analog of formula XIV, which is a compound of formula I where A, and A2 are CR7, W is SO2—CHR7 and Y is CHR7—CHR7. Alternatively, a compound of formula XII can be converted directly to a compound of formula XIV by prolonged treatment with an oxidizing agent, such as mCPBA, or with other agents such as those known to one skilled in the art.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Scheme VII describes another approach to incorporating additional substitution onto a compound of formula I. As illustrated in Scheme VII, a diene of formula Ha can be reacted with a dienophile of formula III, as described in Scheme I, to yield a compound of formula FVa, which is a compound of formula I where Y is O, A2 is CR7 and A, is C — (CH2)q — T. The compound of formula IVa can be reacted with a reagent of formula R12 — T to obtain a compound of formula IVb or IVc which are compounds of formula I where Y is O, A2 is CR7 and A, is C — (CH2)q — T — R12 or C — (CH2)q — T — R12, respectively. The reagent R12 — T' can be obtained from commercial sources or can readily be prepared by one skilled in the art.<br>
In the above Scheme, R12 has the same definition as R7 defined earlier, q is zero or an integer from 0-8, and T is defined either as (1) a nucleophilic center such as, but not limited, to a nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur-containing group, capable of undergoing a nucleophilic substitution reaction with the leaving group T' or (2) a leaving group capable undergoing a nucleophilic substitution reaction with a nucleophilic group T' (such as, but not limited, to a nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur-containing nucleophilic group). T has the same definition as T. In the present case, for example, a nucleophilic substitution reaction occurs when the attacking reagent (the nucleophile) brings an electron pair to the substrate, using this pair to form the new bond, and the leaving group (the nucleofuge) comes away with the electron pair, leaving as an anionic intermediate. For a detailed discussion of the mechanism of<br>
aliphatic nucleophilic substitutions and a review of specific aliphatic nucleophilic substitution reactions see Advanced Organic Chemistry, Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, 4th Addition. Jerry March (Ed.), John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1992) 293-500 and the references therein. Compounds of the formulae FVa, FVb, or IVc may, of course, be employed in the methods described herein (especially, in the treatment of nuclear hormone receptor-associated conditions) without undergoing further reaction of T or T.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
An alternate approach to compounds of formula IVa, FVb and IVc is illustrated in Scheme VIII. For this approach, techniques such as those described in Schemes II, III and IV can be applied to the preparation of an intermediate of formula Via, where T and q are as defined in Scheme VII.   The intermediate of formula Via can be reacted with a substitited amine of formula V, as described in Scheme II, to yield the compound of formula IVa, which is a compound of formula I where Y is O, A2 is CR7 and A, is C—(CH2)q—T. The compound of formula IVa can be treated in the manner described in Scheme VII to obtain compounds of formula FVb or IVc which are compounds of formula I where Y is O, A2 is CR7 and At is C— (CH2)q—f—R'2 or C—(CH2)q—T—R'2, respectively.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Scheme IX describes another approach to incorporating further substitution onto a compound of formula I. As illustrated in Scheme IX (where X is a leaving group), a diene of formula lib can be reacted with a dienophile of formula III, as described in Scheme I, to yield a compound of formula IVe, which is a compound of formula I where Y is NH, and A, and A2 are CR7. The compound of formula IVe can be functionalized at the free amine by reacting with a variety of electrophilic agents such as acid halides or alkyl halides in the presence of base, for example by methods known by one skilled in the art and described in Scheme V, to yield a compound of formula IVf, which is a compound of formula I where Y is NR7 and A, and A2 are CR7.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
An alternate approach to compounds of formula FVe and IVf is illustrated in Scheme X. For this approach, techniques as described in Schemes II, HI and IV can be applied to the preparation of an intermediate of formula Vlb.   The intermediate of formula Vlb can be reacted with a substituted amine of formula V, as described in Scheme II, to yield a compound of formula FVe, which is a compound of formula I where Y is NH, and A, and A2 are CR7. The latter intermediate can be treated in the manner described in Scheme V to obtain a compound of formula IVf, which is a compound of formula I whereY is NR7, and A, and A2 are CR7.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Scheme XI describes another approach to incorporating additional substitution onto a compound of formula I. As illustrated in Scheme XI, a diene of formula He can be reacted with a dienophile of formula HI, as described in Scheme I, to yield a compound of formula IVg, which is a compound of formula I where Y is SO and A, and A2 are CR7. A compound of formula FVg can be treated with an oxidizing agent such as mCPBA, as described in Scheme VI, to yield a compound of formula IVh, which is a compound of formula I where Y is SO2 and A, and A2 are CR7.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Scheme XII describes another approach to incorporating additional substitution onto a compound of formula I. As illustrated in Scheme XII, a compound of formula XV, which can be prepared in accordance with the above Schemes, can be incubated in the presence of a suitable enzyme or microorganism resulting in the formation of a hydroxylated analog of formula XVI. Such a process can be employed to yield regiospecific as well as enantiospecific incorporation of a hydroxyl group into a molecule of formula XV by a specific microorganism or by a series of different microorganisms. Such microorganisms can, for example, be bacterial, yeast or fungal in nature and can be obtained from distributors such as ATCC or identified for use in this method such as by methods known to one skilled in the art. Compound XVI is a compound of formula I where Y is as described above and A, and A2 are preferably CR7.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Scheme XIII describes another approach to incorporating additional substitution onto a compound of formula I. As illustrated in Scheme XIII, a compound of formula XVII, which can be prepared in accordance with the above Schemes, can be incubated in the presence of a suitable enzyme or microorganism resulting in the formation of a diol analog of formula XVIII. Such a process can be employed to yield regiospecific as well as enantiospecific transformation of a compound of formula XVII to a 1 -2 diol of formula XVIII by a specific microorganism or by a series of different microorganisms. Such microorganisms can, for example, be bacterial, yeast or fungal in nature and can be obtained from distributors such as ATCC or identified for use in this method such as by methods known to one skilled in the art. Compound XVIII is a compound of formula I where Y is as described above and A, and A2 are preferably CR7.<br>
The present invention also provides the methods of Schemes XII and XIII.<br>
Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method for preparation of a compound of the following formula XVI, or salt thereof:<br>

comprising the steps of contacting a compound of the following formula XV, or salt thereof:<br>
2<br>
z<br>
•    QI XV<br>
where the symbols are as defined above;<br>
with an enzyme or microorganism capable of catalyzing the hydroxylation of said<br>
compound XV to form said compound XVI, and effecting said hydroxylation.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a method for preparation of a compound of the following formula XVIII, or salt thereof:<br>
(Figure Remove) <br><br>
where the symbols are as defined herein,<br>
comprising the steps of contacting a compound of the following formula XVII, or salt<br>
thereof:<br>
G<br>
XVII<br>
where the symbols are as defined above;<br>
with an enzyme or microorganism capable of catalyzing the opening of the epoxide ring of compound XVII to form the diol of said compound XVIII, and effecting said ring opening and diol formation.<br>
All stereoconfigurations of the unspecified chiral centers of the compounds of the formulae XV, XVI, XVII and XVIII are contemplated in the methods of the present invention, either alone (that is, substantially free of other stereoisomers) or in admixture with other stereoisomeric forms. Conversion of one isomer selectively<br><br>
(e.g., hydroxylation of the exo isomer preferentially to hydroxylation of the endo isomer) when contacting an isomeric mixture is a preferred embodiment of the invention. Conversion to one isomer selectively (e.g., hydroxylation on the exo face "exo isomer" preferentially to the endo face "endo isomer" or regioselective opening of an epoxide to form only one of two possible regioisomers of a trans diol) is a preferred embodiment of the invention. Hydroxylation of an achiral intermediate to form a single optical isomer of the hydroxylated product is also a preferred embodiment of the invention. Resolution of a recemic mixture of an intermediate by selective hydroxylation, or epoxide ring opening and diol formation, to generate one of the two possible optical isomers is also a preferred embodiment of the invention. The term "resolution" as used herein denotes partial, as well as, preferably, complete resolution.<br>
The terms "enzymatic process" or "enzymatic method", as used herein, denote a process or method of the present invention employing an enzyme or microorganism. The term "hydroxylation", as used herein, denotes the addition of a hydroxyl group to a methylene group as described above. Hydroxylation can be achieved, for example, by contact with molecular oxygen according to the methods of the present invention. Diol formation can be achieved, for example, by contact with water according to the methods of the present invention. Use of "an enzyme or microorganism" in the present methods includes use of two or more, as well as a single, enzyme or microorganism.<br>
The enzyme or microorganism employed in the present invention can be any enzyme or microorganism capable of catalyzing the enzymatic conversions described herein. The enyzmatic or microbial materials, regardless of origin or purity, can be employed in the free state or immobilized on a support such as by physical adsorption or entrapment. Microorganisms or enzymes suitable for use in the present invention can be selected by screening for the desired activity, for example, by contacting a candidate microorganism or enzyme with a starting compound XV or<br>
XVII	or salt thereof, and noting conversion to the corresponding compound XVI or<br>
XVIII	or salt thereof. The enzyme may, for example, be in the form of animal or<br>
plant enzymes or mixtures thereof, cells of microorganisms, crushed cells, extracts of<br>
cells, or of synthetic origin.<br>
Exemplary microorganisms include those within the genera: Streptomyces or Amycolatopsis. Particularly preferred microorganisms are those within the species Streptomyces griseus, especially Streptomyces griseus ATCC 10137, and Amycolatopsis orientate such as ATCC 14930, ATCC 21425, ATCC 35165, ATCC 39444, ATCC 43333, ATCC 43490, ATCC 53550, ATCC 53630, and especially<br><br>
ATCC 43491. The term "ATCC" as used herein refers to the accession number of the American Type Culture Collection, 10801 University Blvd., Manassas Virginia 20110-2209, the depository for the organism referred to. It should be understood that mutants of these organisms are also contemplated by the present invention, for use in the methods described herein, such as those modified by the use of chemical, physical (for example, X-rays) or biological means (for example, by molecular biology techniques).<br>
Preferred enzymes include those derived from microorganisms, particularly those microorganisms described above. Enzymes may be isolated, for example, by extraction and purification methods such as by methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art. An enzyme may, for example, be used in its free state or in immobilized form. One embodiment of the invention is that where an enzyme is adsorbed onto a suitable carrier, e.g., diatomaceous earth (porous Celite Hyflo Supercel), microporous polypropylene (Enka Accurel® polypropylene powder), or a nonionic polymeric adsorbent such as Amberlite® XAD-2 (polystyrene) or XAD-7 (polyacrylate) from Rohm and Haas Co. When employed to immobilize an enzyme, a carrier may control the enzyme particle size and prevent aggregation of the enzyme particles when used in an organic solvent. Immobilization can be accomplished, for example, by precipitating an aqueous solution of the enzyme with cold acetone in the presence of the Celite Hyflo Supercel followed by vacuum drying, or in the case of a nonionic polymeric adsorbent, incubating enzyme solutions with adsorbent on a shaker, removing excess solution and drying enzyme-adsorbent resins under vacuum. While it is desirable to use the least amount of enzyme possible, the amount of enzyme required will vary depending upon the specific activity of the enzyme used.<br>
Hydroxylation as described above can occur in vivo. For example, liver enzyme can selectively, relative to the endo isomer, hydroxylate the exo isomer of a compound of the present invention. In conducting the methods of the present invention outside the body, liver microsomal hydroxylase can be employed as the enzyme for catalysis.<br>
These processes may also be carried out using microbial cells containing an enzyme having the ability to catalyze the conversions. When using a microorganism to perform the conversion, these procedures are conveniently carried out by adding the cells and the starting material to the desired reaction medium.<br>
Where microorganisms are employed, the cells may be used in the form of intact wet cells or dried cells such as lyophilized, spray-dried or heat-dried cells, or in the form of treated cell material such as ruptured cells or cell extracts. Cell extracts immobilized on Celite® or Accurel® polypropylene as described earlier may also be<br><br>
employed. The use of genetically engineered organisms is also contemplated. The host cell may be any cell, e.g. Escherichia coli, modified to contain a gene or genes for expressing one or more enzymes capable of catalysis as described herein.<br>
Where one or more microorganisms are employed, the enzymatic methods of the present invention may be carried out subsequent to the fermentation of the microorganism (two-stage fermentation and conversion), or concurrently therewith, that is, in the latter case, by in situ fermentation and conversion (single-stage fermentation and conversion).<br>
Growth of the microorganisms can be achieved by one of ordinary skill in the art by the use of an appropriate medium. Appropriate media for growing microorganisms include those which provide nutrients necessary for the growth of the microbial cells. A typical medium for growth includes necessary carbon sources, nitrogen sources, and elements (e.g. in trace amounts). Inducers may also be added. The term "inducer", as used herein, includes any compound enhancing formation of the desired enzymatic activity within the microbial cell.<br>
Carbon sources can include sugars such as maltose, lactose, glucose, fructose, glycerol, sorbitol, sucrose, starch, mannitol, propylene glycol, and the like; organic acids such as sodium acetate, sodium citrate, and the like; and alcohols such as ethanol, propanol and the like.<br>
Nitrogen sources can include N-Z amine A, corn steep liquor, soy bean meal, beef extracts, yeast extracts, molasses, baker's yeast, tryptone, nutrisoy, peptone, yeastamin, amino acids such as sodium glutamate and the like, sodium nitrate, ammonium sulfate and the like.<br>
Trace elements can include magnesium, manganese, calcium, cobalt, nickel, iron, sodium and potassium salts. Phosphates may also be added in trace or, preferably, greater than trace amounts.<br>
The medium employed can include more than one carbon or nitrogen source or other nutrient.<br>
Preferred media for growth include aqueous media.<br>
The agitation and aeration of the reaction mixture affects the amount of oxygen available during the conversion process when conducted, for example, in shake-flask cultures or fermentor tanks during growth of microorganisms.<br>
Incubation of the reaction medium is preferably at a temperature between about 4 and about 60°C. The reaction time can be appropriately varied depending upon the amount of enzyme used and its specific activity. Reaction times may be reduced by increasing the reaction temperature and/or increasing the amount of enzyme added to the reaction solution.<br><br>
It is also preferred to employ an aqueous liquid as the reaction medium, although an organic liquid, or a miscible or immiscible (biphasic) organic/aqueous liquid mixture, may also be employed. The amount of enzyme or microorganism employed relative to the starting material is selected to allow catalysis of the enzymatic conversions of the present invention.<br>
Solvents for the organic phase of a biphasic solvent system may be any organic solvent immiscible in water, such as toluene, cyclohexane, xylene, trichlorotrifluoroethane and the like. The aqueous phase is conveniently of water, preferably deionized water, or a suitable aqueous buffer solution, especially a phosphate buffer solution. The biphasic solvent system preferably comprises between about 10 to 90 percent by volume of organic phase and between about 90 to 10 percent by volume of aqueous phase, and most preferably contains at or about 20 percent by volume of organic phase and at or about 80 percent by volume of the aqueous phase.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of such processes starts with preparation of an aqueous solution of the enzyme(s) or microbes to be used. For example, the preferred enzyme(s) or microbes can be added to a suitable amount of an aqueous solvent, such as phosphate buffer or the like. This mixture is preferably adjusted to and maintained<br>
at a desired pH.<br>
The compounds XVI and XVIII produced by the processes of the present<br>
invention can be isolated and purified, for example, by methods such as extraction, distillation, crystallization, and column chromatography.<br>

Use and Utility<br>
The compounds of the present invention modulate the function of nuclear hormone receptors (NHR), and include compounds which are, for example, agonists,<br><br>
partial agonists, antagonists or partial antagonists of the androgen receptor (AR), the estrogen receptor (ER), the progesterone receptor (PR), the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), the steroid and xenobiotic receptor (SXR), other steroid binding NHR's, the Orphan receptors or other NHR's. Selective modulation of one such NHR relative to others within the NHR family is preferred. "Modulation" includes, for example, activation (e.g., agonist activity such as selective androgen receptor agonist activity) or inhibition (e.g., antagonist activity).<br>
The present compounds are thus useful in the treatment of NHR-associated conditions. A "NHR-associated condition", as used herein, denotes a condition or disorder which can be treated by modulating the function of a NHR in a subject, wherein treatment comprises prevention (e.g., prophylactic treatment), partial alleviation or cure of the condition or disorder. Modulation may occur locally, for example, within certain tissues of the subject, or more extensively throughout a subject being treated for such a condition disorder.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are useful for the treatment of a variety of conditions and disorders including, but not limited to, those described following:<br>
Compounds of formula I can be applied as agonists, partial agonists, antagonists, or partial antagonists of the estrogen receptor, preferably selectively to that receptor, in an array of medical conditions which involve modulation of the estrogen receptor pathway. Applications of said compounds include but are not limited to: osteoporosis, hot flushes, vaginal dryness, prostate cancer, breast cancer, endometrial cancer, cancers expressing the estrogen receptor such as the aforementioned cancers and others, contraception, pregnancy termination, menopause, amennoreahea, and dysmennoreahea.<br>
Compounds of formula I can be applied as agonists, partial agonists, antagonists or partial antagonists of the progesterone receptor, preferably selectively to that receptor, in an array of medical conditions which involve modulation of the progesterone receptor pathway. Applications of said compounds include but are not limited to: breast cancer, other cancers containing the progesterone receptor, endometriosis, cachexia, contraception, menopause, cyclesynchrony, meniginoma,<br><br>
dysmennoreahea, fibroids, pregnancy termination, labor induction and osteoporosis.<br>
Compounds of formula 1 can be applied as agonists, partial agonists, antagonists or partial antagonists of the glucocorticoid receptor, preferably selectively to that receptor, in an array of medical conditions which involve modulation of the glucocorticoid receptor pathway. Applications of said compounds include but are not limited to: inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, prostate cancer, breast cancer, Alzheimer's disease, psychotic disorders, drug dependence, non-insulin dependent Diabetes Mellitus, and as dopamine receptor blocking agents or otherwise as agents for the treatment of dopamine receptor mediated disorders.<br>
Compounds of formula I can be applied as agonists, partial agonists, antagonists or partial antagonists of the mineralocorticoid receptor, preferably selectively to that receptor, in an array of medical conditions which involve modulation of the mineralocorticoid receptor pathway. Applications of said compounds include but are not limited to: drug withdrawal syndrome and inflammatory diseases.<br>
Compounds of formula 1 can be applied as agonists, partial agonists, antagonists or partial antagonists of the aldosterone receptor, preferably selectively to that receptor, in an array of medical conditions which involve modulation of the aldosterone receptor pathway. One application of said compounds includes but is not limited to: congestive heart failure.<br>
Compounds of formula I can be applied as agonists, partial agonists, antagonists or partial antagonists of the androgen receptor, preferably selectively to that receptor, in an array of medical conditions which involve modulation of the androgen receptor pathway. Applications of said compounds include but are not limited to: hirsutism, acne, seborrhea, Alzheimer's disease, androgenic alopecia, hypogonadism, hyperpilosity, benign prostate hypertrophia, adenomas and neoplasies of the prostate (such as advanced metastatic prostate cancer), treatment of benign or malignant tumor cells containing the androgen receptor such as is the case for breast, brain, skin, ovarian, bladder, lymphatic, liver and kidney cancers, pancreatic cancers modulation of VCAM expression and applications therein for the treatment of heart disease, inflammation and immune modulations, modulation of VEGF expression and<br><br>
the applications therein for use as antiangiogenic agents, osteoporosis, suppressing spermatogenesis, libido, cachexia, endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome, anorexia, androgen supplement for age related decreased testosterone levels in men, male menopause, male hormone replacement, male and female sexual dysfunction, and inhibition ot muscular atrophy in ambulatory patients. For example, pan AR modulation is contemplated, with prostate selective AR modulation ("SARM") being particularly preferred, such as for the treatment of early stage prostate cancers. .<br>
Compounds of formula I can be applied as (preferably, selective) antagonists of the mutated androgen receptor, for example, found in many tumor lines. Examples of such mutants are those found in representative prostate tumor cell lines such as LNCap, (T877A mutation, Biophys. Acta, 187, 1052 (1990)), PCa2b, (L701H &amp; T877A mutations, J. Ural., 162, 2192 (1999)) and CWR22, (H874Y mutation, Mol. Endo., 11, 450 (1997)). Applications of said compounds include but are not limited to: adenomas and neoplasies of the prostate, breast cancer and endometrial cancer.<br>
Compounds of formula 1 can be applied as agonists, partial agonists, antagonists or partial antagonists of the steroid and xenobiotic receptor, preferably selectively to that receptor, in an array of medical conditions which involve modulation of the steroid and xenobiotic receptor pathway. Applications of said compounds include but are not limited to: treatment of disregulation of cholesterol homeostasis, attenuation of metabolism of pharmaceutical agents by co-administration of an agent (compound of the present invention) which modulates the P450 regulator effects of SXR.<br>
Along with the aforementioned NHR, there also exist a number of NHR for which the activating or deactivating ligands may not be characterized. These proteins are classified as NHR due to strong sequence homology to other NHR, and are known as the Orphan receptors. Because the Orphan receptors demonstrate strong sequence homology to other NHR, compounds of formula I include those which serve as modulators of the function of the Orphan NHR. Orphan receptors which are modulated by NHR modulators such as compounds within the scope of formula I are exemplified, but not limited to, those listed in Table 1. Exemplary therapeutic<br><br>
applications of modulators of said Orphan receptors are also listed in Table 1, but are not limited to the examples therein.<br><br>

treatment of cancers. The present compounds can be employed in the treatment of all diseases currently treatable through steroid therapy. The present compounds may be employed for the treatment of these and other disorders alone or with other immunosuppressive or antiinflammatory agents. In accordance with the invention, a compound of the formula I can be administered prior to the onset of inflammation (so as to suppress an anticipated inflammation) or after the initiation of inflammation. When provided prophylactically, the immunosupressive compound(s) are preferably provided in advance of any inflammatory response or symptom (for example, prior to, at, or shortly after the time of an organ or tissue transplant but in advance of any symptoms or organ rejection). The prophylactic administration of a compound of the formula I prevents or attenuates any subsequent inflammatory response (such as, for example, rejection of a transplanted organ or tissue, etc.) Administration of a compound of the formula I attenuates any actual inflammation (such as, for example, the rejection of a transplanted organ or tissue).<br>
The compounds of the formula I can be administered for any of the uses described herein by any suitable means, for example, orally, such as in the form of tablets, capsules, granules or powders; sublingually; bucally; parenterally, such as by subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, or intrasternal injection or infusion techniques (e.g., as sterile injectable aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions); nasally, including administration to the nasal membranes, such as by inhalation spray; topically, such as in the form of a cream or ointment; or rectally such as in the form of suppositories; in dosage unit formulations containing non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles or diluents. The present compounds can, for example, be administered in a form suitable for immediate release or extended release. Immediate release or extended release can be achieved by the use of suitable pharmaceutical compositions comprising the present compounds, or, particularly in the case of extended release, by the use of devices such as subcutaneous implants or osmotic pumps. The present compounds can also be administered liposomally.<br>
Exemplary compositions for oral administration include suspensions which can contain, for example, microcrystalline cellulose for imparting bulk, alginic acid or sodium alginate as a suspending agent, methylcellulose as a viscosity enhancer, and<br><br>

For example, known therapies for advanced metastatic prostate cancer include "complete androgen ablation therapy" wherein tumor growth is inhibited by controlling the supply of androgen to the prostate tissues via chemical castration (castration serves to inhibit the production of circulating testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT)) followed by the administration of androgen receptor (AR) antagonists (which inhibit the function T/DHT derived from the conversion of circulating androgen precursors to T/DHT by the prostate tissue). The compounds of the present invention can be employed as AR antagonists in complete ablation therapy, alone or in combination with other AR antagonists such as Flutamide, Casodex, Nilutamide, or Cyproterone acetate.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be employed adjuvant to surgery.<br>
Another application of the present compounds is in combination with antibody therapy such as but not limited to antibody therapy against PSCA. An additional application is in concert with vaccine / immune modulating agents for the treatment of cancer.<br>
Compounds of the present invention can be employed in accordance with the methods described in U.S. Provisional.

Application Serial No.	(unassigned), entitled "Selective Androgen Receptor<br>
Modulators and Methods for Their Identification, Design and Use" filed June 20, 2001 by Mark E. Salvati et al. (Attorney Docket No. LD0250(NP)), which Patent Application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety (including, but not limited to, reference to all specific compounds within formula I of the present invention).<br>
For racemates of compounds of the present invention, one enantiomer can, for example be a full AR antagonist while the other can be an AR antagonist in tumor<br><br>
tissue while having no activity or agonist activity in nontumor tissue containing the androgen receptor.<br>
The above other therapeutic agents, when employed in combination with the compounds of the present invention, can be used, for example, in those amounts indicated in the Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR) or as otherwise determined by one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The following assays can be employed in ascertaining the activity of a compound as a NHR modulator. Preferred are those compounds with an activity greater than 20um for binding or transactivation in any of these assays. Various compounds of the present invention were determined to have AR modulator activity utilizing the transactivation assay, and standard AR binding assays as described following.<br>
Transactivation Assays:<br>
AR Specific Assay:<br>
Compounds of the present invention were tested in transactivation assays of a transfected reporter construct and using the endogenous androgen receptor of the host cells. The transactivation assay provides a method for identifying functional agonists and partial agonists that mimic, or antagonists that inhibit, the effect of native hormones, in this case, dihydrotestosterone (DHT). This assay can be used to predict in vivo activity as there is a good correlation in both series of data. See, e.g. T. Berger et al., J. Steroid Biochem. Molec. Biol. 773 (1992), the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
For the transactivation assay a reporter plasmid is introduced by transfection (a procedure to induce cells to take foreign genes) into the respective cells. This reporter plasmid, comprising the cDNA for a reporter protein, such as secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP), controlled by prostate specific antigen (PSA) upstream sequences containing androgen response elements (AREs). This reporter plasmid functions as a reporter for the transcription-modulating activity of the AR. Thus, the reporter acts as a surrogate for the products (mRNA then protein) normally expressed by a gene under control of the AR and its native hormone. In order to detect antagonists, the transactivation assay is carried out in the presence of constant concentration of the natural AR hormone (DHT) known to induce a defined reporter signal. Increasing concentrations of a suspected antagonist will decrease the reporter signal (e.g., SEAP production). On the other hand, exposing the transfected cells to increasing concentrations of a suspected agonist will increase the production of the reporter signal.<br>
For this assay, LNCaP and MDA 453 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), and maintained in RPMI 1640 or DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco) respectively. The respective cells were transiently transfected by electroporation according to the optimized procedure described by Heiser, 130 Methods Mol. Biol., 117 (2000), with the pSEAP2/PSA540/Enhancer reporter plasmid. The reporter<br>
plasmid, was constructed as follows: commercial human placental genomic DNA was used to generate by Polymerase Cycle Reaction (PCR) a fragment containing the Bglll site (position 5284) and the Hind III site at position 5831 of the human prostate specific antigen promoter (Accession # U37672), Schuur, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 271 (12): 7043-51 (1996). This fragment was subcloned into the pSEAP2/basic (Clontech) previously digested with Bglll and Hindlll to generate the pSEAP2/PSA540 construct. Then a fragment bearing the fragment of human PSA upstream sequence between positions -5322 and -3873 was amplified by PCR from human placental genomic DNA. A Xhol and a Bglll sites were introduced with the primers. The resulting fragment was subcloned into pSEAP2/PSA540 digested with Xhol and Bglll respectively, to generate the pSEAP2/PSA540/Enhancer construct. LNCaP and MDA 453 cells were collected in media containing 10% charcoal stripped FBS. Each cell suspension was distributed into two Gene Pulser Cuvetts (Bio-Rad) which then received 8 ug of the reporter construct, and electoporated using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at 210 volts and 960 fiFaraday. Following the transfections the cells were washed and incubated with media containing charcoal stripped fetal bovine serum in the absence (blank) or presence (control) of 1 nM dihydrotestosterone (DHT; Sigma Chemical) and in the presence or absence of the standard anti-androgen bicalutamide or compounds of the present invention in concentrations ranging from 10-10 to 10-5 M (sample). Duplicates were used for each sample. The compound dilutions were performed on a Biomek 2000 laboratory workstation. After 48 hours, a fraction of the supernatant was assayed for SEAP activity using the Phospha-Light Chemiluminescent Reporter Gene Assay System (Tropix, Inc). Viability of the remaining cells was determined using the CellTiter 96 Aqueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS Assay, Promega). Briefly, a mix of a tetrazolium compound (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)- 2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt; MTS) and an electron coupling reagent (phenazine methosulfate; PMS) are added to the cells. MTS (Owen's reagent) is bioreduced by cells into a formazan that is soluble in tissue culture medium, and therefore its absorbance at 490nm can be measured directly from 96 well assay plates<br>
without additional processing. The quantity of formazan product as measured by the amount of 490nm absorbance is directly proportional to the number of living cells in culture. For each replicate the SEAP reading was normalized by the Abs490 value derived from the MTS assay. For the antagonist mode, the % Inhibition was calculated as:<br>
% Inhibition - 100 x ( 1 - [average control - average blank / average sample -average blank ])<br>
Data was plotted and the concentration of compound that inhibited 50% of the normalized SEAP was quantified (IC50).<br>
For the agonist mode % Control was referred as the effect, of the tested compound compared to the maximal effect observed with the natural hormone, in this case DHT, and was calculated as:<br>
% Control - 100 x average sample - average blank/ average control - average blank<br>
Data was plotted and the concentration of compound that activates to levels 50% of the normalized SEAP for the control was quantified (EC50).<br>
GR Specificity Assay:<br>
The reporter plasmid utilized was comprised of the cDNA for the reporter SEAP protein, as described for the AR specific transactivation assay.   Expression of the reporter SEAP protein was controlled by the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat (MMTV LTR) sequences that contains three hormone response elements (HREs) that can be regulated by both GR and PR see, e.g. G. Chalepakis et al., Cell, 53(3), 371 (1988). This plasmid was transfected into A549 cells, which expresses endogenous GR, to obtain a GR specific transactivation assay. A549 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), and maintained in RPM1 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco).<br>
Determination of the GR specific antagonist activity of the compounds of the present invention was identical to that described for the AR specific transactivation assay, except that the DHT was replaced with 5 nM dexamethasone (Sigma Chemicals), a specific agonist for GR. Determination of the GR specific agonist activity of the compounds of the present invention was performed as described for the AR transactivation assay, wherein one measures the activation of the GR specific reporter system by the addition of a test compound, in the absence of a known GR specific agonists ligand.<br>
PR Specific Assay:<br>
The reporter plasmid utilized was comprised of the cDNA for the reporter SEAP protein, as described for the AR specific transactivation assay. Expression of the reporter SEAP protein was controlled by the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat (MMTV LTR) sequences that contains three hormone response elements (HREs) that can be regulated by both GR and PR. This plasmid was transtected into T47D, which expresses endogenous PR, to obtain a PR specific transactivation assay. T47D cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), and maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco). Determination of the PR specific antagonist activity of the compounds of the present invention was identical to that described for the AR specific transactivation assay, except that the DHT was replaced with 1 nM Promegastone (NEN), a specific agonist for PR. Determination of the PR specific agonist activity of the compounds of the present invention was performed as described for the AR transactivation assay, wherein one measures the activation of the PR specific reporter system by the addition of a test compound, in the absence of a known PR specific agonists ligand.<br>
AR Binding Assay:<br>
For the whole cell binding assay, human LNCaP cells (T877A mutant AR) or MDA 453 (wild type AR) in 96-well microtiter plates containing RPMI 1640 or DMEM supplemented with 10% charcoal stripped CA-FBS (Cocaleco Biologicals)<br>
respectively, were incubated at 37°C to remove any endogenous ligand that might be complexed with the receptor in the cells. After 48 hours, either a saturation analysis to determine the Kri for tritiated dihydrotestosterone, [3H]-DHT, or a competitive binding assay to evaluate the ability of test compounds to compete with [3H]-DHT were performed. For the saturation analysis, media (RPMI 1640 or DMEM - 0.2% CA-FBS) containing [*H]-DHT (in concentrations ranging from 0.1 nM to 16 nM) in the absence (total binding) or presence (non-specific binding) of a 500-fold molar excess of unlabeled DHT were added to the cells. After 4 hours at 37°C, an aliquot of the total binding media at each concentration of [3H]-DHT was removed to estimate the amount of free |'H]-DHT. The remaining media was removed, cells were washed three times with PBS and harvested onto UniFilter GF/B plates (Packard), Microscint (Packard) was added and plates counted in a Top-Counter (Packard) to evaluate the amount of bound pH]-DHT.<br>
For the saturation analysis, the difference between the total binding and the non-specific binding, was defined as specific binding. The specific binding was evaluated by Scatchard analysis to determine the Kd for 13H]-DHT, See e.g. D. Rodbard, Mathematics and statistics of ligand assays: an illustrated guide: In: J. Langon and J. J. Clapp, eds., Ligand Assay, Masson Publishing U.S.A., Inc., New York, pp. 45-99, (1981), the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
For the competition studies, media containing 1 nM [3H]-DHT and compounds of the invention ("test compounds") in concentrations ranging from 1010 to 105 M were added to the cells. Two replicates were used for each sample. After 4 hours at 37°C, cells were washed, harvested and counted as described above. The data was plotted as the amount of [3H]-DHT (% of control in the absence of test compound) remaining over the range of the dose response curve for a given compound. The concentration of test compound that inhibited 50% of the amount of [3H]-DHT bound in the absence of competing ligand was quantified (IC50) after log-logit transformation. The K, values were determined by application of the Cheng-Prusoff equation to the IC50 values, where:<br>
(3H-DHT) / Kd for 3H-DHT)<br>
After correcting for non-specific binding, IC50 values were determined. The IC50 is defined as the concentration of competing ligand needed to reduce specific binding by 50%. The Kds for [3H]-DHT for MDA 453 and LNCaP were 0.7 and 0.2 nM respectively.<br>
Human Prostate Cell Proliferation Assay:<br>
Compounds of the present invention were tested ("test compounds") on the proliferation of human prostate cancer cell lines. For that, MDA PCa2b cells, a cell line derived from the metastasis of a patient that failed castration, Navone et al., Clin. Cancer Res., 3, 2493-500 (1997), were incubated with or without the test compounds for 72 hours and the amount of [3H]-thymidine incorporated into DNA was quantified as a way to assess number of cells and therefore proliferation. The MDA PCa2b cell line was maintained in BRFF-HPC1 media (Biological Research Faculty &amp; Facility Inc., MD) supplemented with 10% FBS. For the assay, cells were plated in Biocoated 96-well microplates and incubated at 37°C in 10% FBS (charcoal-stripped)/BRFF-BMZERO (without androgens). After 24 hours, the cells were treated in the absence (blank) or presence of 1 nM DHT (control) or with test compounds (sample) of the present invention in concentrations ranging from 10~'° to 10"5 M. Duplicates were used for each sample. The compound dilutions were performed on a Biomek 2000 laboratory work station. Seventy two hours later 0.44 uCi. of [3H]-Thymidine (Amersham) was added per well and incubated for another 24 h followed by tripsinization, harvesting of the cells onto GF/B filters. Micro-scint PS were added to the filters before counting them on a Beckman TopCount.<br>
The % Inhibition was calculated as:<br>
% Inhibition = 100 x ( 1 - [average control - average blank / average ^^ - average blank]) Data was plotted and the concentration of compound that inhibited 50% of the [3H]-Thymidine incorporation was quantified (IC50).<br>
C2C12 Mouse Myoblast Transactivation Assay:<br>
Two functional transactivation assays were developed to assess the efficacy of androgen agonists in a muscle cell background using a luciferase reporter. The first<br>
assay (ARTA Stable 1) uses a cell line, Stable 1 (clone #72), which stably expresses the full length rat androgen receptor but requires the transient transfection of an enhancer/reporter. This cell line was derived from C2C12 mouse moyoblast cells. The second assay (ARTA Stable 2) uses a cell line, Stable 2 (clone #133), derived from Stable 1 which stably expresses both rAR and the enhancer/luciferase reporter.<br>
The enhancer/reporter construct used in this system is pGL3/2XDR-1/luciferase.   2XDR-1 was reported to be an AR specific response element in CV-1 cells, Brown et. al. The Journal of Biological Chemist)' 272, 8227-8235, (1997). It was developed by random mutagenesis of an AR/GR consensus enhancer sequence.<br>

Proliferation Assays<br>
Marine Breast Cell Proliferation Assay:<br>
The ability of compounds of the present invention ("test compounds") to modulate the function of the AR was determined by testing said compounds in a proliferation assay using the androgen responsive murine breast cell line derived from the Shionogi tumor, Hiraoka et al., Cancer Res., 47, 6560-6564 (1987). Stable AR dependent clones of the parental Shionogi line were established by passing tumor fragments under the general procedures originally described in Tetuo, et. al., Cancer Research 25, 1168-1175 (1965). From the above procedure, one stable line, SCI 14,<br><br>
was isolated, characterized and utilized for the testing of example compounds. SCI 14 cells were incubated with or without the test compounds for 72 hours and the amount of [3H]-thymidine incorporated into DNA was quantified as a surrogate endpoint to assess the number of cells and therefore the proliferation rate as described in Suzuki et. ai, J. SteroidBiochem. Mol. Biol. 37, 559-567 (1990). The SCI 14 cell line was maintained in MEM containing 108 M testosterone and 2% DCC-treated PCS. For the assay, cells were plated in 96-well microplates in the maintenance media and incubated at 37°C. On the following day, the medium was changed to serum free medium [Ham's F-12:MEM (1;1, v/v) containing 0.1% BSA] with (antagonist mode) or without (agonist mode) 10"8 M testosterone and the test compounds of the present invention in concentrations ranging from 10 10 to 10"5 M. Duplicates were used for each sample. The compound dilutions were performed on a Biomek 2000 laboratory work station. Seventy two hours later 0.44uCi of [3H]-Thymidine (Amersham) was added per well and incubated for another 2 hr followed by tripsinization, and harvesting of the cells onto GF/B filters. Micro-scint PS were added to the filters before counting them on a Beckman TopCount. For the antagonist mode, the % Inhibition was calculated as:<br>
% Inhibition = 100 x ( 1 - [average sample - average blank / average control - average blank ])<br>
Data was plotted and the concentration of compound that inhibited 50% of the [3H]-Thymidine incorporation was quantified (IC50).<br>
For the agonist mode % Control was referred as the effect of the tested compound compared to the maximal effect observed with the natural hormone, in this case DHT, and was calculated as:<br>
% Control - 100 x (average sample - average blank)/ (average conlrol - average blank)<br>
Data was plotted and the concentration of compound that inhibited 50% of the [3H]-Thymidine incorporation was quantified (EC50).<br><br>
In Vitro Assay to Measure GR Induced AP-1 Transrepression:<br>
The AP-1 assay is a cell based luciferase reporter assay. A549 cells, which contain endogenous glucocorticoid receptor, were stably transfected with an AP-1 DMA binding site attached to the luciferase gene. Cells are then grown in RPMI + 10% fetal calf serum (charcoal-treated) + Penicillin/Streptomycin with 0.5mg/ml geneticin. Cells are plated the day before the assay at approximately 40000 cells/well. On assay day, the media is removed by aspiration and 20 pi assay buffer (RPMI without phenol red + 10% PCS (charcoal-treated) + Pen/Strep) is added to each well. At this point either 20 pi assay buffer (control experiments), the compounds of the present invention ("test compounds") (dissolved in DMSO and added at varying concentrations) or dexamethasome (100 nM in DMSO, positive control) are added to each well. The plates are then pre-incubated for 15 minutes at 37°C, followed by stimulation of the cells with 10 ng/ml PMA. The plates are then incubated for 7 hrs at 37°C after which 40 pi luciferase substrate reagent is added to each well. Activity is measured by analysis in a luminometer as compared to control experiments treated with buffer or dexamethasome. Activity is designated as % inhibition of the reporter system as compared to the buffer control with 10 ng/ml PMA alone. The control, dexamethasone, at a concentration of 
Wet Prostate Weight Assay AR Antagonist Assay:<br>
The activity of compounds of the present invention as AR antagonists was investigated in an immature male rat model, a standard, recognized test of antiandrogen activity of a given compound, as described in L. G. Hershberger et al., Proc. Soc. Expt. Biol. Med., 83, 175 (1953); P. C. Walsh and R. F. Gittes, "Inhibition of extratesticular stimuli to prostate growth in the castrated rat by antiandrogens", Endocrinology, 86, 624 (1970); and B. J. Furr et al., "ICI 176,334: A novel non-<br><br>
steroid, peripherally selective antiandrogen", J. Endocrinoi, 113, R7-9 (1987), the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
The basis of this assay is the fact that male sexual accessory organs, such as the prostate and seminal vesicles, play an important role in reproductive function. These glands are stimulated to grow and are maintained in size and secretory function by the continued presence of serum testosterone (T), which is the major serum androgen (&gt;95%) produced by the Leydig cells in the testis under the control of the pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Testosterone is converted to the more active form, dihydrotestosterone, (DHT), within the prostate by 5a-reductase. Adrenal androgens also contribute about 20% of total DHT in the rat prostate, compared to 40% of that in 65-year-old men. F. Labrie et al. Clin. Invest. Med., 16, 475-492 (1993). However, this is not a major pathway, since in both animals and humans, castration leads to almost complete involution of the prostate and seminal vesicles without concomitant adrenalectomy. Therefore, under normal conditions, the adrenals do not support significant growth of prostate tissues. M. C. Luke and D. S. Coffey, "The Physiology of Reproduction" ed. By E. Knobil and J. D. Neill, 1, 1435-1487 (1994). Since the male sex organs are the tissues most responsive to modulation of the androgen activity, this model is used to determine the androgen dependent growth of the sex accessory organs in immature castrated rats.<br>
Male immature rats (19-20 days old Sprague-Dawley, Harlan Sprague-Dawely) were castrated under metofane ansestesia. Five days after surgery these castrated rats (60-70g, 23-25 day-old) were dosed for 3 days. Animals were dosed sub-cutaneously (s.c.) Img/kg with Testosterone Proprionate (TP) in arachis oil vehicle and anti-androgen test compounds (compounds of the present invention) were dosed orally by gavage (p.o.) in dissolved/suspensions of 80% PEG 400 and 20% Tween 80 (PEGTW). Animals were dosed (v/w) at 0.5 ml of vehicle /lOOg body weight. Experimental groups were as follows:<br>
1.	Control vehicle<br>
2.	Testosterone Propionate (TP) (3 mg/rat/day, subcutaneous)<br>
3.	TP plus Casodex (administered p.o. in PEGTW, QD), a recognized<br>
antiandrogen, as a reference compound.<br><br>
4.	To demonstrate antagonist activity, a compound of the present invention<br>
("test compound") was administered (p.o. in PEGTW, QD) with TP (s.c. as<br>
administered in group 2) in a range of doses.<br>
5.	To demonstrate agonist activity a compound of the present invention ("test<br>
compound") was administered alone (p.o.. in PEGTW, QD) in a range of<br>
doses.<br>
At the end of the 3-day treatment, the animals were sacrificed, and the ventral prostate weighed. To compare data from different experiments, the sexual organs weights were first standardized as mg per 100 g of body weight, and the increase in organ weight induced by TP was considered as the maximum increase (100%). ANOVA followed by one-tailed Student or Fischer's exact test was used for statistical analysis.<br>
The gain and loss of sexual organ weight reflect the changes of the cell number (DNA content) and cell mass (protein content), depending upon the serum androgen concentration. See Y. Okuda et al., /. t/ro/., 145, 188-191 (1991), the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. Therefore, measurement of organ wet weight is sufficient to indicate the bioactivity of androgens and androgen antagonist. In immature castrated rats, replacement of exogenous androgens increases seminal vesicles (SV) and the ventral prostate (VP) in a dose dependent manner.<br>
The maximum increase in organ weight was 4 to 5-fold when dosing 3 mg/rat/day of testosterone (T) or 1 mg/rat/day of testosterone propionate (TP) for 3 days. The EC50 of T and TP were about 1 mg and 0.03 mg, respectively. The increase in the weight of the VP and SV also correlated with the increase in the serum T and DHT concentration. Although administration of T showed 5-times higher serum concentrations of T and DHT at 2 hours after subcutaneous injection than that of TP, thereafter, these high levels declined very rapidly. In contrast, the serum concentrations of T and DHT in TP-treated animals were fairly consistent during the 24 hours, and therefore, TP showed about 10-30-fold higher potency than free T.<br>
In this immature castrated rat model, a known AR antagonist (Casodex) was also administered simultaneously with 0.1 mg of TP (ED80), inhibiting the testosterone-mediated increase in the weights of the VP and SV in a dose dependent<br><br>
manner. The antagonist effects were similar when dosing orally or subcutaneously. Compounds of the invention also exhibited AR antagonist activity by suppressing the testosterone-mediated increase in the weights of VP and SV.<br>
Levator Ani &amp; Wet Prostate Weight Assay AR Agonist Assay:<br>
The activity of compounds of the present invention as AR agonists was investigated in an immature male rat model, a recognized test of anabolic effects in muscle and sustaining effects in sex organs for a given compound, as described in L. G. Hershberger et al, Proc. Soc. Expt. Biol. Med., 83, 175 (1953); B. L. Beyler et al, "Methods for evaluating anabolic and catabolic agents in laboratory animals", J. Amer. Med. Women 's Ass., 23, 708 (1968); H. Fukuda et al., "Investigations of the levator ani muscle as an anabolic steroid assay", Nago Dai. Yak. Ken. Nem. 14, 84 (1966) the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
The basis of this assay lies in the well-defined action of androgenic agents on the maintenance and growth of muscle tissues and sexual accessory organs in animals and man. Androgenic steroids, such as testosterone (T), have been well characterized for their ability to maintain muscle mass. Treatment of animals or humans after castrations with an exogenous source of T results in a reversal of muscular atrophy. The effects of T on muscular atrophy in the rat levator ani muscle have been well characterized. M. Masuoka et al., "Constant cell population in normal, testosterone deprived and testosterone stimulated levator ani muscles" Am. J. Anat. 119, 263 (1966); Z. Gori et al., "Testosterone hypertrophy of levator ani muscle of castrated rats. I. Quantitative data" Boll. -Soc. Hal. Biol. Sper. 42, 1596 (1966); Z. Gori et al., "Testosterone hypertrophy of levator ani muscle of castrated rats. II. Electron-microscopic observations" Boll. -Soc. Ital. Biol. Sper. 42, 1600 (1966); A. Boris et al., Steroids 15, 61 (1970). As described above, the effects of androgens on maintenance of male sexual accessory organs, such as the prostate and seminal vesicles, is well described. Castration results in rapid involution and atrophy of the prostate and seminal vesicles. This effect can be reversed by exogenous addition of androgens. Since both the levator ani muscle and the male sex organs are the tissues most responsive to the effects of androgenic agents, this model is used to determine<br><br>
the androgen dependent reversal of atrophy in the levator ani muscle and the sex accessory organs in immature castrated rats. Sexually mature rats (200-250 g, 6-8 weeks-old, Sprague-Dawley, Harlan) were acquired castrated from the vendor (Taconic). The rats were divided into groups and treated daily for 7 to 14 days with one of the following:<br>
1.	Control vehicle<br>
2.	Testosterone Propionate (TP) (3 mg/rat/day, subcutaneous)<br>
3.	TP plus Casodex (administered p.o. in PEGTW, QD), a recognized<br>
antiandrogen, as a reference compound.<br>
4.	To demonstrate antagonist activity, a compound of the present invention<br>
("test compound") was administered (p.o. in PEGTW, QD) with TP (s.c. as<br>
administered in group 2) in a range of doses.<br>
5.	To demonstrate agonist activity a compound of the present invention ("test<br>
compound") was administered alone (p.o. in PEGTW, QD) in a range of<br>
doses.<br>
At the end of the 7-14-day treatment, the animals were sacrificed by carbon dioxide, and the levator ani, seminal vesicle and ventral prostate weighed. To compare data from different experiments, the levator ani muscle and sexual organ weights were first standardized as mg per 100 g of body weight, and the increase in organ weight induced by TP was considered as the maximum increase (100%). Super-anova (one factor) was used for statistical analysis.<br>
The gain and loss of sexual organ weight reflect the changes of the cell number (DNA content) and cell mass (protein content), depending upon the serum androgen concentration. See Y. Okuda et al., J. Urol., 145, 188-191 (1991), the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. Therefore, measurement of organ wet weight is sufficient to indicate the bioactivity of androgens and androgen antagonist. In immature castrated rats, replacement of exogenous androgens increases levator ani, seminal vesicles (SV) and prostate in a dose dependent manner.<br>
The maximum increase in organ weight was 4 to 5-fold when dosing 3 mg/rat/day of testosterone (T) or 1 mg/rat/day of testosterone propionate (TP) for 3 days. The EC50 of T and TP were about 1 mg and 0.03 mg, respectively. The<br><br>
increase in the weight of the VP and SV also correlated with the increase in the serum T and DHT concentration. Although administration of T showed 5-times higher serum concentrations of T and DHT at 2 hours after subcutaneous injection than that of TP, thereafter, these high levels declined very rapidly. In contrast, the serum concentrations of T and DHT in TP-treated animals were fairly consistent during the 24 hours, and therefore, TP showed about 10-30-fold higher potency than free T.<br>
MDA PCa2b Human Prostate Zenograft Assay:<br>
In Vivo Antitumor Testing: MDA-PCa-2b human prostate tumors were maintained in Balb/c nu/nu nude mice. Tumors were propagated as subcutaneous transplants in adult male nude mice (4-6 weeks old) using tumor fragments obtained from donor mice. Tumor passage occurred every 5-6 weeks.<br>
For antitumor efficacy trial, the required number of animals needed to detect a meaningful response were pooled at the start of the experiment and each was given a subcutaneous implant of a tumor fragment (~50 mg) with a 13-gauge trocar. Tumors were allowed to grow to approx. 100-200 mg (tumors outside the range were excluded) and animals were evenly distributed to various treatment and control groups. Treatment of each animal was based on individual body weight. Treated animals were checked daily for treatment related toxicity/mortality. Each group of animals was weighed before the initiation of treatment (Wtl) and then again following the last treatment dose (Wt2). The difference in body weight (Wt2-Wtl) provides a measure of treatment-related toxicity.<br>
Tumor response was determined by measurement of rumors with a caliper twice a week, until the tumors reach a predetermined "target" size of 0.5 gm. Tumor weights (mg) were estimated from the formula: Tumor weight = (length x width2) +• 2<br>
Tumor response end-point was expressed in terms of tumor growth inhibition (%T/C), defined as the ratio of median tumor weights of the treated tumors (T) to that of the control group (C).<br>
To estimate tumor cell kill, the tumor volume doubling time was first calculated with the formula:<br>
TVDT = Median time (days) for control tumors to reach target size -<br><br>
Median time (days) for control tumors to reach half the target size s And, Log cell kill - (T-C) - (3.32 x TVDT)<br>
Statistical evaluations of data were performed using Gehan's generalized Wilcoxon test. Dunning Prostate Tumor:<br>
Dunning R3327H prostate tumor is a spontaneously derived, well differentiated androgen responsive adenocarcinoma of the prostate (Smolev JK, Heston WD, Scott WW, and Coffey DS, Cancer Treat Rep. 61, 273-287 (1977)). The growth of the R3327H subline has been selected for its highly androgen-dependent and reproducible growth in intact male rats. Therefore, this model and other sublines of this tumor have been widely used to evaluate in vivo antitumor activities of antiandrogens such as flutamide and bacilutamide/Casodex (Maucher A., and von Angerer, J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol., 119, 669-674 (1993), Furr B.J.A. Euro. URL. 18 (suppl. 3), 2-9 (1990), Shain S.A. and Huot Rl. J. Steriod Biochem. 31, 711-718 (1988)).<br>
At the beginning of the study, the Dunning tumor pieces (about 4x4 mm) are transplanted subcutaneously to the flank of mature male Copenhagen rats (6-7 weeks old, Harlan-Sprague Dawley, Indianapolis, MD). About 6 weeks after the implantation, the animals with tumors of measurable size (about 80-120 mm2) are randomized into treatment groups (8-10 rats/group) and the treatments are initiated. One group of the rats are castrated to serve as the negative control of tumor growth. Animals are treated daily with compounds of the current invention, standard antiandrogens such as bacilutamide or vehicle (control) for an average of 10 to 14 weeks. Test compounds are dissolved in a vehicle of (2.5 ml/kg of body weight) 10% polyethylene glycol and 0.05% Tween-80 in 1% carboxymethyl cellulose, PEG/CMC, (Sigma, St Louis, MO). Typical therapeutic experiments would include three groups of three escalating doses for each standard or test compound (in a range of 300-3 mg/kg).<br>
Tumors in the vehicle (control) group reach a size of 1500 to 2500 mm3, whereas the castrated animal group typically shows tumor stasis over the 14 weeks of<br><br>
observation. Animals treated orally with 20 mg/kg of bicalutamide or flutamide would be expected to show a 40% reduction in tumor volumes compared to control after 14 weeks of treatment. The size of tumors are measured weekly by vernier caliper (Froboz, Switzerland), taking perpendicular measurements of length and width. Tumor volumes are measured in mm3 using the formula: Length x Width x Height = Volume. Statistical differences between treatment groups and control are evaluated using multiple ANOVA analysis followed by one tail non-parametric Student t test.<br>
Mature Rat Prostate Weight Assay:<br>
The activity of compounds of the present invention were investigated in a mature male rat model, which is a variation of the Levator ani &amp; wet prostate weight assay described above. The above in vivo assays are recognized assays for determining the anabolic effects in muscle and sustaining effects in sex organs for a given compound, as described in L. G. Hershberger et al., 83 Proc. Soc. Expt. Biol. Med., 175 (1953); B. L. Beyler et al, "Methods for evaluating anabolic and catabolic agents in laboratory animals", 23 J. Amer. Med. Women 's Ass., 708 (1968); H. Fukuda et al., "Investigations of the levator ani muscle as an anabolic steroid assay", 14 Nago Dai. Yak. Ken. Nem. 84 (1966) the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. The basis of this assay lies in the well-defined action of androgenic agents on the maintenance and growth of muscle tissues and sexual accessory organs in animals and man.<br>
The male sexual accessory organs, such as the prostate and seminal vesicles, play an important role in reproductive function. These glands are stimulated to grow and are maintained in size and secretory function by the continued presence of serum testosterone (T), which is the major serum androgen (&gt;95%) produced by the Leydig cells in the testis under the control of the pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Testosterone is converted to the more active form, dihydrotestosterone, (DHT), within the prostate by 5a-reductase. Adrenal androgens also contribute about 20% of total DHT in the rat prostate, compared to 40% of that in 65-year-old men. F. Labrie et. al. 16 Clin. Invest. Med.,<br><br>
475-492 (1993). However, this is not a major pathway, since in both animals and humans, castration leads to almost complete involution of the prostate and seminal vesicles without concomitant adrenalectomy. Therefore, under normal conditions, the adrenals do not support significant growth of prostate tissues, M. C. Luke and D. S. Coffey, "The Physiology of Reproduction" ed. By E. KLnobil and J. D. Neill, 1, 1435-1487 (1994). Since the male sex organs and the levator ani are the tissues most responsive to modulation of the androgen activity, this model is used to determine the activity of compounds that modulate the androgen receptor pathway in mature rats.<br>
Along with its mitogenic activity on tissues such as prostate, seminal vesicle and muscle, testosterone also serves as a negative regulator for its own biosynthesis. Testosterone production in the Leydig cells of the testis is controlled by the level of circulating LH released from the pituitary gland. LH levels are themselves controlled by the level of LHRH produced in the hypothalmic region. Testosterone levels in the blood serve to inhibit the secretion of LHRH and subsequently reduce levels of LH and ultimately the levels of circulating testosterone levels. By measuring blood levels of LH as they are effected by compounds of the present invention ("test compounds"), it is possible to determine the level of agonist or antagonist activity of said compounds at the hypothalamic axis of this endocrine cycle.<br>
Matched sets of Harlan Sprague-Dawely rats (40-42 days old, 180-220 g), were dosed orally by gavage (p.o.) with the test compounds in dissolved/suspensions of 80% PEG 400 and 20% Tween 20 (PEGTW) for 14 days. Two control groups, one intact and one castrated were dose orally only with the PEGTW vehicle. Animals were dosed (v/w) at 0.5 ml of vehicle /lOOg body weight. Experimental groups were as follows:<br>
1.	Intact vehicle (p.o., PEGTW, QD)<br>
2.	Control vehicle (p.o., PEGTW, QD)<br>
3.	Bicalutamide (Casodex, a recognized antiandrogen, as a reference compound) or a<br>
compound of the present invention, p.o. in PEGTW QD. (in a range of doses).<br>
At the end of the 14-day treatment, the animals were sacrificed, and the ventral prostate, the seminal vesicles, and the levator ani were removed surgically and<br><br>
weighed. To compare data from different experiments, the organs weights were first standardized as mg per 100 g of body weight, and expressed as a percentage of the value of the respective organ in the intact group.<br>
Rat luteinizing hormone (rLH) is quantitatively determined with the Biotrak \ 125 1] kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotek), following the manufacturer directions. The assay is based on the competition by the LH present in the serum of the binding of [12T] rLH to an Amerlex-M bead/antibody suspension. The radioactivity that remains after incubation with the serum and subsequent washes is extrapolated into a standard curve to obtain a reading in ng/ml.<br>
The gain and loss of sexual organ and levator ani weight reflect the changes of the cell number (DNA content) and cell mass (protein content), depending upon the serum androgen concentration, see Y. Okuda et al., J. Urol., 145, 188-191 (1991), the disclosure of which in herein incorporated by reference. Therefore, measurement of organ wet weight is sufficient to indicate the bioactivity of androgens and androgen antagonist. In the mature rats assay, active agonist agents will have no effect or will increase the weight of one or more of the androgen responsive organs (levator ani, prostate, seminal vessicle) and will have no effect or a suppressive effect on LH secretion. Compounds with antagonist activity will decrease the weight of one or more of the androgen responsive organs (levator ani, prostate, seminal vesicle) and will have no effect or a reduced suppressive effect on LH secretion.<br>
CWR22 Human Prostate Zenograft Assay:<br>
In Vivo Antitumor Testing: CWR22 human prostate tumors were maintained in Balb/c nu/nu nude mice. Tumors were propagated as subcutaneous transplants in adult male nude mice (4-6 weeks old) using tumor fragments obtained from donor mice. Tumor passage occurred every 5-6 weeks.<br>
For antitumor efficacy trial, the required number of animals needed to detect a meaningful response were pooled at the start of the experiment and each was given a subcutaneous implant of a tumor fragment (-50 mg) with a 13-gauge trocar. Tumors were allowed to grow to approx. 100-200 mg (tumors outside the range were excluded) and animals were evenly<br><br>
distributed to various treatment and control groups. Treatment of each animal was based on individual body weight. Treated animals were checked daily for treatment related toxicity/mortality. Each group of animals was weighed before the initiation of treatment (Wt1) and then again following the last treatment dose (Wt2). The difference in body weight (Wt2-Wt1) provides a measure of treatment-related toxicity.<br>
Tumor response was determined by measurement of tumors with a caliper twice a week, until the tumors reach a predetermined "target" size of 0.5 gm. Tumor weights (mg) were estimated from the formula: Tumor weight = (length x width2) + 2.<br>
Tumor response end-point was expressed in terms of tumor growth inhibition (%T/C), defined as the ratio of median tumor weights of the treated tumors (T) to that of the control group (C).<br>
To estimate tumor cell kill, the tumor volume doubling time was first calculated with the formula:<br>
TVDT = Median time (days) for control tumors to reach target size -Median time (days) for control tumors to reach half the target size And, Log cell kill = (T-C) + (3.32 x TVDT)<br>

3,5-Bis-(trifluoromethyl)-aniline (0.017 g, 0.0075 mmol) was dissolved in acetic acid (0.300 mL) and transferred to a 1.5 mL conical vial with a septa cap.<br>
Stock solutions of an additional 95 amines were prepared as described above. To each of the above vials was added 0.4 mL (0.12 mmol) of a stock solution of exo-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1 jheptane-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride in acetic acid. The vials were then sealed and heated at 110°C for 11 h. Upon cooling to 25°C, the caps were removed from the vials and the acetic acid was removed in vacuo. To each vial was added 1 mL of 2:1 acetone/methylene chloride and the vials were heated at 40°C for 1 h. Once all products were in solution, they were transferred via robot to filter tubes with coarse frits pre-wetted with 0.2 mL of water. Nitrogen was blown through each tube until the volatile organics were removed. 1.5 mL of 10% aq K2CO3 was then added to each tube followed by vigorous shaking at 25°C for 15 min. The tubes were then drained, resealed and 1.0 mL of water was added to each tube followed by shaking. The tubes were drained again and washed with water a second time. The resulting residues in each tube was then dried in vacuo for 48 h. After drying, 1.0 mL of 20% TFA in methylene chloride was added to each tube and the racks were shaken for 30 min. The tubes were then drained into a 96-well plate with pre-tared custom micro-tubes present. Each tube was assayed for product purity (analytical LC) and identity (LC-MS). The tubes were then concentrated in vacuo and weighed for yields. The tube containing the reaction of 3,5-bistrifluoromethylaniline and exo-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride, yielded 0.022 g of compound 8 as a white solid.

To a 500 ml_ flask containing 100 ml of the transformation medium was added one frozen vial (approximately 2 ml) of Streptomyces griseus ATCC 10137. The transformation medium was prepared as follows: to a 2 L plastic beaker was added 20 g of dextrose, 5.0 g of yeast extract, 5.0 g of soybean meal, 5.0 g of sodium chloride, 5.0 g of potassium phosphate (diabasic) and 1 L of deionized water, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 to 30 min. The pH of the mixture was then adjusted to 7.0 with 1 N HCI or 1 N NaOH.   The resulting mixture was dispensed into 500 ml flasks (100 ml per flask). The flasks were covered with Bio/Wrap and autoclaved at 121°C for 15 min. and cooled down to room temperature before use.<br>
The culture was incubated at 28°C and at 250 rpm for 24 hours.   Ten mL of the resulting culture was transferred to a 50 mL flask, to which 1 mg of compound 223A in 0.2 ml ethanol was added. The flask was incubated at 28°C and 250 rpm for 24 hours, and the reaction culture was extracted with EtOAc (10 ml). The EtOAc extract was dried under N2 and the residue was dissolved in 1 ml of MeOH (reaction extract).<br><br>
