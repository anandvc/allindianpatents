THE PATENTS ACT, 1970 COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See section 10]<br><br>
Title <br><br><br>
"A sterile, low toxicity, stable, aqueous, pharmaceutical compositions comprising oxazaphosphorine antineoplastic for parenteral administration"<br><br><br><br>
Applicant<br><br>
Bharat Serums &amp; Vaccines Ltd.,<br>
Road No. 27, Wagle Estate,<br>
Thane - 400 604. Maharashtra, India.<br>
Indian company incorporated under the Companies Act 1956.<br><br><br>
25-4-2008<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of<br>
the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed	GRANTED<br>
 9 MAR 2004<br><br>
This invention relates to a sterile, low toxicity, stable aqueous, pharmaceutical compositions comprising oxazaphosphorine antineoplastic for parenteral administration in human beings and other mammals. The invention particularly relates to compositions comprising an oxazaphosphorine antineoplastic, mesna and an etherified ß-cyclodextrin. The invention more particularly relates to sterile, low toxicity, stable, aqueous, pharmaceutical compositions comprising Ifosfamide, Mesna, and 2-hydroxypropyl-ß-cyclodextrin (referred to hereinafter as "HPBCD"), that are stable and suitable for ready clinical use.<br>
Background and prior art:<br>
Two main groups of drugs used in the treatment of malignant disease are alkylating agents and the antimetabolites. Ifosfamide and cyclophosphamide are oxazaphosphorine antineoplastic drugs belonging to the alkylating agents group and are being widely used.<br>
Ifosfamide is given intravenously either by injection as a solution diluted to less than 4% or by infusion and is used in the treatment of a variety of solid tumours including those of the cervix, endometrium, lung, ovary, testes and thymus as well as in sarcoma and in the treatment of Burkitts lymphoma.<br>
Ifosfamide is the Approved Name for 3-(2-chloroethyl)-2-[(2-chloroethyl)amino]tetrahydro-2H- l,3,2-oxazaphosphorin-2-oxide and is represented by the formula:<br><br>
IFOSFAMIDE It is a white hygroscopic crystalline powder having a low melting point of 40°C. It also begins to sinter below its melting point.     These characteristics of<br><br>
Ifosfamide make it difficult for sterile filling of the dry powder as both temperature and humidity are required to be accurately controlled. Further, as Ifosfamide powder is filled aseptically into sterile containers, maximum precautions are required to maintain sterility of the product.<br>
Ifosfamide powder is freely soluble in water. The aqueous solution is sensitive to changes in pH.<br>
The treatment with Ifosfamide is associated with serious side effects like hemorrhagic cystitis, myelosuppression, cardiac arrythmias, CNS disturbances, nephrotoxicity, haematological and gastro-intestinal reactions.<br>
Similar problems are encountered with other oxazaphosphorine antineoplastic, e.g. Cyclophosphamide, which is the Approved Name for 2-[bis(2-chloroethyl)amino]tetrahydro-2H-1,3,2-oxazophosphorine 2-oxide, represented by the formula:<br><br>
CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE<br>
Oxazaphosphorine antineoplastics are toxic to the urinary tract and may involve the kidneys as well as the bladder. Hence it is recommended that they are administered in association with 2-mercaptoethanesulphonates, especially Mesna.<br>
Mesna is the Approved Name for sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulphonate and is represented by the formula:<br>
HSCH2CH2SO3 Na+.<br><br>
Mesna is highly water soluble. It is used for the prophylaxis of urothelial toxicity in patients being treated with Ifosfamide or Cyclophosphamide. In the kidney Mesna disulfide, the inactive metabolite of Mesna is reduced to free Mesna, which has thiol groups that react with the metabolites of Ifosfamide, and Cyclophosphamide, including acroleil, considered to be responsible for the toxic effects on the bladder.<br>
Commercially Mesna is available as sterile, nonpyrogenic aqueous solution for injection containing lOOmg/ml of Mesna<br>
The intravenous daily dose of Mesna is calculated to equal 60% of the total daily dose of Ifosfamide and is administered as 3 bolus doses given 15 minutes before and 4 and 8 hours after administration of each dose of Ifosfamide when the Ifosfamide dose is less than 2.5g/m2/day administered as a short infusion. For use with continuous infusion of Ifosfamide, Mesna may be administered as a bolus dose equal to 20% of the total Ifosfamide dose followed by a continuous infusion of mesna equal to 40% of the Ifosfamide dose, continuing for 12 to 24 hours after completion of the Ifosfamide infusion.<br>
Mesna has also been administered as a continuous infusion at a dose equal to 60% of Ifosfamide dose. No clinical data is available to justify Mesna doses greater than 60% w/w of Ifosfamide for standard doses of Ifosfamide. With high doses in excess of 2.5g/m2 of Ifosfamide, continuous and prolonged Mesna dosage regimen is necessary for maximum protection against urotoxicity.<br>
The disadvantages with the existing commercially available oxazaphosphorine products in powder form and Mesna Injection are<br>
1. more than one vial of Ifosfamide is required to be reconstituted and then diluted to the required concentration as the standard dosage is more than lg daily.<br><br>
2.	in high dosage Ifosfamide therapy as high as eight vials of lg are required to be reconstituted and diluted to the required concentration.<br>
3.	as Mesna is required to be administered along with Ifosfamide, Ifosfamide solution after reconstitution is required to be mixed with Mesna.<br>
Attempts were made by various laboratories / inventors to formulate ready-to-use parenteral solution that would contain Ifosfamide and Mesna to overcome the problem of handling Ifosfamide during reconstitution and during mixing with Mesna.<br>
US-A-4959215 discloses a stable Ifosfamide-Mesna lyophilizate comprising Ifosfamide, 0.05 to 1.0 parts by weight of Mesna and 0.1 to 17 parts by weight of a hexitol prepared by freeze drying an aqueous or aqueous-ethanolic solution of Ifosfamide, Mesna and the hexitol, preferably mannitol. There is no reference to the presence of any cyclodextrin. The lyophilizate is stable physically showing no discolouration. The speed of dissolution is also claimed to markedly higher compared to the dry filled Ifosfamide.<br>
US-A-4952575 discloses a composition comprising 10 to 70 %w/v of an oxazaphosphorine of the formula:<br><br>
in which at least two of R1, R2 and R3 independently are 2-chloroethyl or 2-methanesulfonyloxyethyl and any remaining R radical is selected from hydrogen, methyl and ethyl; dissolved in 80 to 100 %v/v of ethanol. Even though the degradation has been shown to be minimal for Ifosfamide, use of solvents in such a high concentration leads to other problems such as volatility, handling during<br><br>
manufacturing, miscibility with blood. As ethanol is pharmacologically active, this may also affect the person on administration of alcoholic solution of Ifosfamide.<br>
WO-A-9918973 discloses stable ready-to-use liquid compositions of at least one oxazaphosphorine of the formula:<br><br>
in which R1, R2 and R3 independently are methyl, ethyl, 2-chloroethyl, 2-methanesulfonyloxyethyl or, except for R3, hydrogen, and at least two of R1, R2 and R3 are 2-chloroethyl and/or 2-methanesulfonyloxyethyl. The solution also comprises Sodium chloride which forms chloride ions in aqueous solution, and optionally, Urea / ethanol as solubilizing agent.<br>
US-A-4879286 discloses a storage-stable liquid oncolytic formulation of Cyclophosphamide formulated as a ready-to-dilute solution in a carrier comprising 50 to 100 % organic polyol selected from propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and glycerol and 0 to 50 % water. The formulation may be used in combination with alcohols, such as 10 to 30% of ethanol (based on total weight of the formulation).<br>
Object:<br>
The main objective of this invention is thus to develop a stable composition comprising oxazaphosphorine antineoplastic together with Mesna that has low urotoxicity and suitable for parenteral administration in human beings and mammals. Yet another object of the invention is to develop the composition that will reduce the other dose dependant toxicities of oxazaphosphorine antineoplastic particularly that of Ifosfamide.<br><br>
Summary of the invention :<br>

4.	Disodium hydrogen phosphate	O.lg<br>
5.	Sodium dihydrogen phosphate	0.06g<br>
6.	Water	q.s. to 200 ml<br>
Weighed quantities of disodium hydrogen phosphate and sodium dihydrogen phosphate were dissolved in 160 ml of water and a weighed quantity of HPBCD was added and dissolved slowly under stirring. The resultant HPBCD solution was divided into two equal parts.<br>
A weighed quantity of Ifosfamide was gradually added under stirring to one part of buffered HPBCD solution and mixed well.<br>
A weighed quantity of Mesna was gradually added under stirring to the remaining part of buffered HPBCD solution and mixed well.<br><br>
Mesna solution prepared above was added to Ifosfamide solution. The resulting solution was mixed together. The volume was made up to 200 ml with water. The product was filtered through a 0.2µ filter and filled aseptically in sterile glass vials. The glass vials were closed under aseptic conditions with sterile Teflon™ coated rubber bungs and sealed using flip off seals.<br>
The composition obtained in this Example was analysed for Ifosfamide content and Mesna content by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and was found to contain 52.92 mg/ml of Ifosfamide and 10.2 mg/ml of Mesna. The composition had a pH of 6.86.<br>
Example II:<br>
The composition obtained in Example I was subjected to acute toxicity studies in mice. A conventional formulation, Holoxan™ manufactured by M/s. German Remedies was reconstituted as directed by the manufacturer and was used as a control after mixing with Mesna (equivalent to 20% of Ifosfamide content). Both the drug solutions were suitably diluted with 5% Dextrose Injection and administered intravenously. Ifosfamide in the doses of 500 mg/kg, 700 mg/kg and 900 mg/kg body weight was administered in three different groups of animals, each group consisting of eight animals.<br>
The animals were kept under observation for 14 days and mortality recorded at the end of 3 days and 7 days.<br>
It was observed that the LD5o dose was higher for composition of Example I in comparison with the Conventional formulation.<br><br>
Conventional formulation<br>
	Mortality (%)		Mortality (%)<br>
Dose (mg)	3 Days	7 Days	Dose (mg)	3 Days	7 Days<br>
500	0	0	500	50	75<br>
700	0	50	700	100	100<br>
900	75	100	900	100	100<br>

DISCUSSION:<br>
Animals treated with Holoxan showed hemorrhagic cystitis at both doses of 400mg/kg and 500mg/kg whereas composition of Example XI did not show hemorrhagic cystitis.<br>
CONCLUSION:<br>
The above findings conclusively proved that the composition of Example XI is less toxic than the conventional formulation Holoxan™<br><br>
Example XIII:<br>
The composition obtained in Example XI was subjected to stability studies. The data is as follows :<br><br>
Storage condition	Description	Ifosfamide content<br>
Initial	Clear, colourless liquid	51.2mg/ml<br>
2°C-8°C - 3M	Clear, colourless liquid	50.06mg/ml<br>
2°C-8°C - 6M	Clear, colourless liquid	50.33mg/ml<br>
Conclusion:<br>
From the above it is evident that Ifosfamide is stable in the composition obtained in Example XI without undergoing any degradation when stored at 2°C - 8°C whereas the conventional formulation on reconstitution is reported to be stable for three to six weeks under refrigeration.<br>
The advantages of the invention:<br>
In one aspect of the invention Ifosfamide and Mesna are combined with HPBCD to give an aqueous, stable composition so that the product is readily marketable and is convenient to use without the step of reconstitution and less handling. Surprisingly, the process of invention in which Ifosfamide, Mesna and HPBCD are combined has produced a composition having low toxicity showing another aspect of synergy in the composition.<br><br>
