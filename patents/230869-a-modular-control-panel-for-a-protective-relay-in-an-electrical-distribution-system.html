				<td>the Invention<br>
The present invention relate:; ro protective relay devices for providing protective control in electrical distribution systems.  More particularly, the present invention relates to a protective relay device having a modular control and display panel.<br>
of the Invention<br>
Protective relay devices are necessary elements of an electrical power distribution system, as they provide a v;<nety of protection and control functions. protective relays monitor conditions la ihe power distribution system opeiate circuit breakers in response to the detection adverse thereby protecting various segments components from damage></nety>
Older protective relays were analog devices, which have been largely replaced by digital protective relays. Digital protective relays include digital processing circuitry which can be progr immed to provide a wider variety of protection and control functions than were available with analog relay devices<br>
Digital protective relays typically include a front panel for providing display and control functions. Such panels are '.ypically fixed, in a secure and relatively permanent manner, to the protective relay circuitry. Because they are fixed tc the relay circuitry, conventional control anc display panels are of limited utility. For example, spaced considerations in a. power distribution substation sometimes nake it desirable for protective relays to have either a horizontal or vertical orientat.on; conventional protective relays are restricted to one orientation, as the control panel is fixed to the protective relay device during assembly. Further, because the control panel is fixed in a conventional 'jrotective relay, relay monitoring and control must be performed by a technician at me protective relay device, rather man at some distance from the protective; relny device.<br>
U.S. Patent 4,742,428 to Coarac. discloses a. protective relay which includes an operating unit that can be withdrawn from an insulating' housing through an opening in the front of the housing. The withdrawabiliry of the protective relay circuiay allows for routine testing, maintenance, and replacement of the interral relay circuitry with minimal disruption (if the power distribution system. However, the corjtrol panel of the Conrad protective relay is shown as being fixed to the relay processing circuitry, and is not shown or described as being removable, capab.e of multiple orientations, or remotely mouniable.<br>
Accordingly, it would be desirable for a protective relay to have a more functional control panel which would alleviate the limitations of conventional fixed control panels, and enhance the functionalicy of the protective relay device.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention solves the above-described problems, and achieves additional advantages, by providing for i protective relay device having a modular control panel comprised of a frame with removable support struts, a display beard, and a rear cover. The control panel is securely mountable in a protective relay housing, and the support struts define a plurality of module spaces into which a plurality of control panel modules can be removably mounted. The control panel modules are independently removable ar.d replaceable by substitute modules to allow the control panel to be easily modified or upgraded. The control panel modules can be mounted in multiple orientations, by changing the orientation cf the support struts, and hence the module spaces allowing the control panel to be reconfjgurable for horizontally or vmicidly oriented protective relay devices. Further, the control panel is hinged, to facilitate access to the digital relay processing circuitry, and is removable nd remotely mountable to allow the protective relay to be remotely controlled and monitored. The control panel modules can include any one or more of indicators, meters, a display, a keypac'., and external connections for receiving d;ita or electrical power. As will be described in more detail below, a modulir control panel according to the present invention greatly improves and Tiriances a protective relay device.<br>

Hetajhad Description<br>
FIG. la is a front view of a horizontally-oriented protective relay device: including a modular protective relay con'.rol panel according to the present invention. The control panel 10 includes a plurality of modules, including an indicator module I2a, a display module 12b, a keypad module 12c, and blank modules 12d. The control panel is preferably removably connected to the protective relay housing by at least one hinge 14 at one end of the control panel, and by a suitable latch 16 at the other enc, of the control panel. By providing a removable connection to che protective relay, the control panel can be opened to facilitate access to the protective relay processing circuitry contained inside the protective relay housing. It will be appreciated that the hinge 14 can be dispe~-;d with and placed by another latch or orc<:r correction means which allows the></:r>
control panel to be opened. As will be shown and described in greater detail below, each module is independently removable and replaceable by a substitute module, which can perform the same or different functions. Further, the relay can be confijjured with a vertical orientation a; shown in FIG. Ib, where the modules are oriented vertically.<br>
FIG. 2a shows a protective relay with a partially open control panel which facilitates access to the relay processing circuitry of the protective relay device. The control panel of the present invention is particularly useful with a modular protective relay device in which relay processing circuitry is embodied in a plundiry of replaceable modules 20, as the hinge or other removable connection means allows relay processing modules to be easily removed and replaced.<br>
FIG. 2b shows a control panel 10 according to the present invention which has been detached from the protective relay device by, e.g., lifting the control p<inel off the hinge or hinges removing panel from latch latches detached control is operatively connected to protective relay device in this example fay a cable suitable for exc ranging power and communication signals between die processing circuitry. la one embodiment of present invention an s-wire shielded twisied pair terminated by rj45 connectors which connect receptacles located rear cover a: location relay. can be mounted either vertically horizontally on remote p shown with other detacl ed panels allow user monitor aid remotelj.></inel>

both the .supports 32 and the edges of the frame 30, the removable supports can be inserted at different orientations. By changing the orientation of-the removable supports, the orientation of the defined spaces can be changed. Each defined spsce can receive a control panel module; thus, by changing the orientation of the defined spaces, die orientation of the control panel modules, and of the protective relay device, can be changed. For example, if removable supports are inserted in the notches 24 such that the removable suppers are parallel to the supports 32, the control panel is configured for a vertical orientation of (in this example) eight vertically arranged module spaces, as shown in FIG. Ib. If removable supports ;ire inserted in the notches 34 such that the removable supports are perpendicular to the supports 32, the control panel will be conf .gured for a horizontal onentaciou of (:n this example) two rows of four horizontally arranged module spaces, as shown ir. HG. la.<br>
E[G- 4 is a block diagram of the control panel display board 36. The display board 36 includes a connection. 40 :o the relay processing circuitry, a controller 42 for controlling the various display and indicator functions on the control panel, a serial pott connection 44 for exchanging power and data signals with a device external to the protective reUiy, a keypad 45 for inputting control information to the protective relay processing circuitry via the controller 42, a modular indicator array 46 comprised of, e.g., LEDs which are selectively illuminated under the control of controller 42T and display circuitry 48 which can display a variety of information to a user.<br>
HGs. 5a-c show various exemplary modules which can be individually inserted Jind removed from the module spa;es defined in the fraeie 30.  Each module can perform a specific function or ;et of functions. FIG. 5a shows an LED indicator module I2a which is operatively connected to the modular indicator arruy 46 and which includes, for example, status and even: LED indicators. Status indicator!! can include an "IN SERVICE" indicator to indicate if the protective relay is operating properly; a "TROUBLE" indicator to indicate if the protective relay's self test operation has deleted a problem; i "TEST MODE" indicator to indicate if the relay &gt;&gt; currently in a test mode: a "TRIP" indicator to indicate that the<br>
protective relay has issued a trip command; an * ALARM" indicator to indicate that an alanr: condition is present; and a "PIC vUP" indicator to indicate that the protective relay has detected a piclcup condition.<br>
Event indicators can be provided o indicate the cause or source of a detected condition of the power distribution system. The event indicators can include: a "CURRENT" indicator to indicate that the event was caused by a current coaditica; a "VOLTAGE" indicator t:o indicate that the event was caused by a voltage condition; a "FREQUENCY" or 'OTHER" indicator to indicate a frequency-related or other condition; phase indicators "PHASE A", "PHASE B", "PHASE C", and "NEUTRAL/GROUND" to indicate which phase(s) were involved, ui a detected fault. Of course, it will be appreciated that other suitable status conditions and events can be indicated by the indicators. In one embodirrent of the present invention, the indicators receive light, from light sources contained in the relay processing circuitry, via light pipes (not shown) which extend from the: back of the control panel module between the indicators and the modular indicator array 46. The light pipes can be formed is clear rubes of plastic, glass, or other suitable material.<br>
The indicator module 12a of FIG. 5a is shown as including a serial port &gt;W. It should be appreciated that the serial poit 44 can alternatively be provided in a separate module. The serial port 44 is preferably capable of receiving power and data signals, and can be implemented as a RS-232 serial port. The serial port 4^-enables i user to connect an external device, such as a personal computer, for downloading settings, monitoring data; generating sequence of events reports, providing oscillographs, or performing oner functions relating to monitoring, programming, and control of the protective relay.<br>
The indicator module 12a of FIG. 5a is also shown as including a reset button and various function buttock. The;.e buttons are operatively connected to the processing circuitry of the protective relay device (e.g., via the controller 42 showa hi FIG. 4), and can be used to reset the de vice and clear the status and event indicators.<br>
FIG. 5b shows a display module 12b which includes a display 48 oper^tively connected to the processing circuitry of iie protective relay. Preferably, the display 42 is a vacuum flouresceat display or odier suitable display which is viewable in relatively dim lighting from a wide variety of viewing angles. The display 42 can provide more detailed information, including text messages or digital meter information, to a user monitoring the protective relay, and can be used to provide feedback to a user programming the proiective relay device. To extend the lift; of the vacuum flourescent display and avoid screen "burn-in", the relay processing circuitry is preferably provided with a screen saver, which can scroll messages across the display screen or cause the display screen to go blank after a predetermined period of time.<br>
FIG. 5c shows a keypad module 12c which includes a keypad 45 which is operatively connected with the processing circuitry of the protective relay (e.g., via the controller 42). The keypad can include numeric keys and/or command keys which allow a user to program die protective relay. The user can receive feedback from a display module as shown in FIG. 5b.<br>
The control panel modules of FIGs. 5a-c are examples only, and it will be appreciated that other suitable modules w ill be contemplated by those of ordinary skill in the an. For example, one or moi e modules can include liquid crystal display meter. Further, blank modules c in be provided in the module spaces where modules are not required.<br>
