				<td>The invention relates to a spinning machine with a condensing device<br>
A device of this kind is known from US-A 4 488 397 in which a fibre structure is guided over a moved guiding surface of a condensing element, with the guide surface exerting a tensile force on the fibre structure and air which flows laterally onto the fibre structure and is sucked off into the interior of the guide surface pressing protruding edge fibres of the fibre structure against the same. Such a condensing device is provided in a spinning machine preferably between a drafting arrangement and a ring spinning device. The condensing element can be a take-off roller of the drafting arrangement which cooperates with a pressing roller. In the case of the aforementioned US patent the condensing element is provided downstream of the drafting arrangement.<br>
As is also known from AT 397 823 B, for example, the fiber structure is guided on the condensing element between an upper or nip roller and a blocking roller. Said blocking roller has the task, among other things, of preventing a backward migration of a rotation of the fiber structure to the condensing zone.<br>
The present invention is based on the object of adjusting the condensing of the fiber structure in the condensing device to the respective requirements.<br>
This object is achieved in such way that a condensing length downstream of the nip roller can be adjusted depending on the raw material of the fiber structure and/or a desired yarn structure.<br>
With the variation of the condensing length it is possible, for example, to take into account the desired hairiness of the yarn or fiber structure.<br>
In accordance with an embodiment of the invention the condensing length can be changed in such a way that the length of a suction slot in a suction element which is<br><br>
disposed in the interior of the condensing element is changeable. For this purpose a slide can be used in the simplest of cases, which slide moves with a shutter in the longitudinal direction of the suction slot and thus shortens or extends the same accordingly. The width of the suction slot could also be changed with a shutter.<br>
A number of condensing devices also comprise a blocking roller which is provided downstream of the nip roller, as described above. Whereas in known condensing devices the blocking roller maintains a relatively large distance from the nip roller and the fiber structure is condensed within this distance, it has been seen in practice that in a number of applications a relatively short condensing zone is sufficient. The condensing zone is limited by the contact lines of nip roller and blocking roller. If thus the distance of said contact line is minimized, a relatively short condensing zone is obtained, so that air consumption in the condensing device can also be reduced.<br>
Preferably, the distance between the nip roller and the blocking roller is to be adjustable. The setting of the distance can also occur depending on the raw material of the fiber structure. For example, long (chemical) fibers demand a larger nipping distance.<br>
The method as to how the distance between nip roller and blocking roller is changed shall be of subordinate relevance. In a simple case the blocking roller can be connected via respective arms with the nip roller for example, with said arms being shortenable and extendable.<br>
It is also possible that the nip roller and the blocking roller are disposed on a supporting plate which is fixed to a weighting arm of the drafting arrangement. One of the two rollers, preferably the blocking roller, can be moved towards the other roller in an oblong hole, so that the distance between the two rollers can be changed in this way.<br>
The invention is now explained in closer detail by reference to the embodiments shown in the drawings, wherein:<br><br><br>
Fig. 1      shows a schematic cross-sectional view of a spinning machine with a condensing device for condensing a fiber structure;<br>
Fig. 2      shows a sectional view of the cross section according to fig. 1;<br>
Fig. 3      shows a schematical sectional view of a further embodiment of a condensing element with associated nip and blocking rollers;<br>
Fig. 4      shows a top view of a schematically shown condensing element.<br>
A material feed 1 according to fig. 1 consists in a conventional spinning machine either of a can or of a roving bobbin. A fibre structure 2 is supplied from the can to the drafting arrangement. In the case of a roving bobbin, a roving is drawn off from the circumference of the bobbin. The fibre structure, namely the roving or the sliver, reaches the zone of a drafting arrangement 4 via a deflection apparatus. The drafting arrangement comprises several pairs of delivery rollers, which are partly equipped with aprons. The fibre structure 2 is drafted only in a weak manner between the first and second pair of delivery rollers 5a and 5 b and strongly between the second and downstream pair of rollers 5 in a nip roller 7 and a condensing element 6, whereby the drafting ratio can in total exceed the value of 100.<br>
The drafted fibre structure is nipped between the nip roller 7 and the condensing element 6 and condensed downstream in a condensing device 8.<br>
The fibre structure leaving the drafting arrangement 1 has a width which decreases during the condensing. A guide means 10, preferably in the form of a screen, can accompany the fibre structure 2 along a condensing zone 9 on the surface of the condensing element 6.<br>
Finally, a blocking roller 11 is provided in the condensing zone which is pressed against the condensing element 6 and thus limits the imparting of a twist by a spinning device<br>
12 against the direction of the material flow. A suction element 13 is disposed in the interior of the condensing element 6 which is connected to a suction device 14.<br>
The condensing element 6 is preferably a perforated rotating cylinder or a flexible apron, whereas the suction element 13 is provided with a suction opening in the zone of the perforation.<br>
The thread guides 15, 15' are disposed between the drafting arrangement 4 and the spinning device 12, which thread guides upwardly limit the balloon of yarn 16 according to fig. 1 in the case of a ring spinning device.<br>
In the lower zone of the spinning device the yarn 16 is wound up on a yarn package 30 by means of a traveller 17 on a ring which is fastened to a ring frame 18 through the rotation of a spindle 19 with drive. The height of the yarn package is defined by the range of movement of the ring frame drive which reciprocates the ring frame 18 up and down in the vertical direction according to fig. 1.<br>
Fig. 2 shows that the condensing element 6 comprises a jacket surface as a moved surface 21, with the breakthroughs 22 leading into the interior of the condensing element 6.<br>
The fiber structure 2 is guided between the condensing element 6 and the nip roller 7, with the nip roller 7 running off on the moved surface 21. It forms a contact line 23 with the moved surface.<br>
The nip roller 7 is followed downstream by the blocking roller 11 which also rolls off on the moved surface 21. It also forms a contact line 24 with the moved surface 21. In accordance with the invention, a distance a between the two contact lines 23 and 24 is minimized.<br><br>
In a further embodiment of the invention according to fig. 3, a nip roller 7.1 and a blocking roller 11.1 are arranged on a triangular supporting plate 25. Said supporting plate 25 is again disposed on a weighting arm 26.<br>
An oblong hole 27 is shaped into the supporting plate 25, which oblong hole receives the axle 28 of the blocking roller 11.1. The oblong hole 27 extends in the direction towards an axle 29 of the nip roller 7.1. The axle 28 of blocking roller 11.1 is displaceable in the oblong hole 27 and can be fixed at another location. In this way the distance between the nip roller 7.1 and the blocking roller 11.1 is changed. Furthermore, a slide 30 is provided in the suction element 13, which slide can be moved with a shutter 31, which is shown in fig. 4 with the broken line, in front of a suction slot 32.<br>
The length of the suction slot 32 can be changed by the slide 30 or its shutter 31 respectively.<br><br>
