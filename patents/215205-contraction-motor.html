				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention comprises a contraction motor according to the generic term of claim 1. In the German patent specification 30 26 964 it is described an evaporation motor which uses the expansion power of expansive means swelling by addition of liquid.<br>
The known evaporation motor comprises a vat containing expansion-active elements, pipe connections and a working liquid surrounding the expansion-active elements.<br>
By means of valves the expansion-active elements are supplied with water and air alternately. The working liquid can leave the vat and return again by a pipe.<br>
In the working cycle the expansion-active elements are filled with water by means of valves and pipes.<br>
The expansion-active elements swell and transmit the pressure and the power to the working liquid which is led by means of valves and pipes to work.<br>
This known evaporation motor uses the environmental heat as well as waste heat, but the expenditure for drying the evaporation-active material is comparatively high.<br>
By the German patent specification 28 57 109 it is known a machine comprising contraction-active, ion-separating means.<br>
The means consist of a plurality of folded plates which at one end are fastened to a rigid stationary network and on the other end are connected to a rigid movable network.<br>
Alternately an ion-rich liquid and an ion-poor liquid is led over the plates, this way the plates contract and lengthen alternately.<br>
This contraction and lengthening power withdraws a mechanical movable chamber. The firmly fixing of the plates is disadvantageous. The plates have to be taken.<br>
By the German patent specification 70 97 01 it is known a device to gain mechanical energy by means of a circulating belt made of swelling material and by evaporation of a liquid.<br>
By the US patent specification 41 50 544 there are known devices to gain mechanical energy by means of circulating belts by heating one part of the belt and cooling the other one at the same time.<br>
The German patent specification 33 36 406 describes devices to gain mechanical energy from heat by means of pumping alternately a liquid from a hollow sphere to another one. They are variable in the size.<br>
The task of this invention is to specify contraction motors of the described type of a better, more compact structure and of a more effective output.<br>
This task is solved by the invention according to claim 1. Further solutions are specified in the claims 4 and 5.<br>
Advantageous and functional structures of the invention are specified in the other claims.<br>
To drive the described contraction motors pure environmental heat is enough, so the operation is recommended in dry and hot climates, where it is possible to produce mechanical energy continuously without input of non-solar energy.<br>
By the inventive special position of the piston-cylinder element the possibility of a very compact structure is given; this way it is managed the automatically guidance of the plates, too.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided contraction motor, characterized by<br>
two plates, building space and being connected with at least one<br>
piston-cylinder arrangement for a working liquid and at least one of<br>
the   plates   is   movable   in   the   direction   of   the   piston-cylinder<br>
arrangement,<br>
at least one working element being connected in between the plates<br>
which is provided for liquid supply as well as for liquid removal<br>
respectively it is provided for steam supply as well as for steam<br>
removal, like this it lenghtens by liquid or steam supply while it<br>
contracts by removal of liquid or steam, and<br>
with pipes for supply and removal of the working medium to the<br>
cylinders.<br>
The  invention  is  specified in the following  accompanying drawings which<br>
represent some executions. There is shown in....<br>
Fig. 1)	a mechanical first execution  of a contraction motor with one<br>
piston-cylinder element.<br>
Fig- 2)	a mechanical second execution of a contraction motor with one<br>
piston-cylinder element.<br>
Fig- 2a)	a part of a view from top to a contraction motor comprising<br>
expansion-active and contraction-active plates according to Fig. 2).<br>
Fig 3)	a mechanical drawing in perspective of a third execution of a<br>
contraction motor containing some piston-cylinder elements.<br>
Fig 4)	a mechanical fourth execution of a contraction motor.<br>
Fig 5)	a mechanical fifth execution of a contraction motor.<br>
Fig. 6)	a mechanical sixth execution of a contraction motor.<br>
The same structures in the drawings are marked with the same symbols Fig 1) shows the structure of a contraction motor 2 on principle.<br>
The contraction motor 2 comprises two rigid plates 4 and 6, being connected with a central piston-cylinder element 8,10 whereby either the plate below or the plate above or both plates are arranged movable.<br>
Surrounding the central piston-cylinder element there are connecting the plates 4,6 expansion-active and con traction-active elements e.g. strings 11.<br>
The cylinder 8 contains a working medium which is provided to fill the cylinder and to leave it by the pipe 12 resp. 14.<br>
The plate 4 connected to the cylinder comprises the pipes 12 and 14.<br>
The piston-cylinder element 8, 10 is provided to guide the plates at the same time, so there is no demand of any additional means.<br>
Fig. 2)	shows a contraction motor 16 which in comparison to contraction<br>
motor 2 according to Fig. 1) doesn' t contain expansion-active nor contraction-active strings, but expansion-active and contraction-active folded plates 18 (Fig. 2a) connect the rigid plates 4 and 6 which at the same time are connected by means of the piston-cylinder element 8,10.<br>
The cylinder 8 contains a working medium which is provided to fill and to leave the cylinder by the pipe 12 resp. 14.<br>
The plate 4 connected to the cylinder comprises the pipes 12 and 14.<br>
The piston-cylinder element 8,10 is provided to guide the plates at the same time, so there is no demand of any additional means.<br>
Fig. 3) shows a contraction motor 20 comprising two rectangular rigid plates 22 and 24 building a space which contains several piston-cylinder elements 26, 27, 28, 29. 30, 31 and expansion-active resp. contraction-active elements e.g. strings 32, or folded plates according to Fig. 2).<br>
Either the plate below or the plate above or both plates are movable.<br>
The supply and outlet of working medium (e.g. hydraulic liquid) is arranged by the pipes 34 and 36 which are integrated in plate 22.<br>
The rigid plates are located between lateral limits 38 and 39. The contraction motors 2, 16 and 20 work like this:<br>
When the working elements (strings 11 and 32 and the folded plates 18) are alternately supplied with liquid, humidity or steam for swelling resp. contracting by means of reducing the liquid, humidity or steam, the alternating swelling and contracting movements move the piston-cylinder element by the plates 4,6 and 22,26.<br>
In the swelling cycle the enlargement of the volume of the cylinder causes a suction, whereby the working medium flows into the piston-cylinder element through the pipes 12, 34, while in the contracting cycle there takes place a working stroke, whereby the working medium is being pressed out through the outlets 14 and 36 and can do mechanical work this way.<br>
Fig. 1) to Fig. 3) show contraction motors comprising optimal passages for the air to dry the working elements; so the expenditure for drying the working elements can be lowered considerably.<br>
Fig. 4) shows a contraction motor 40 with a hollow sphere 41, the casing 42 of it consisting of an expansion-active and a contraction-active material which inside is invested with an elastic layer 43 consisting of inert material.<br>
The hollow sphere 41 is filled with a working medium 44 which is in contact to the pipes 46 and 47 by a connecting pipe 45 which passes the casing 42 made liquid-tight.<br>
The hollow sphere 41 consisting of expansion-active and contraction-active material is situated in a container 48. This container 48 is alternately supplied with liquid or steam and liquid or steam are taken from it. This is not shown nor described.<br>
Fig. 5) shows a contraction motor 50 differing from contraction motor 40 according to Fig. 4 only in the detail of using a hollow cylinder 52 of expansion-<br><br>
active and contraction-active material, instead of a hollow sphere 41. See the description of contraction motor 40 according to Fig. 4), comparable structures in the drawings are marked with the same symbols.<br>
The contraction motors 40 and 50 work like this:<br>
When the hollow sphere 41 resp. the hollow cylinder 52 is filled with water or steam it is swollen to its most extended state, shown by lines run through.<br>
The full contracted state of the hollow sphere 41 resp. of the hollow cylinder 52 after reducing the liquid (drying) or reducing the steam is shown by interrupted lines 41' resp. 52'.<br>
When the hollow sphere 41 resp. the cylinder 52 swells by liquid or steam supply their volume increases, whereby working liquid streams into the hollow sphere resp. into the hollow cylinder through the pipe 46 and through the connecting pipe 45.<br>
When the hollow sphere resp. the hollow cylinder contract by reducing the liquid or the steam, the volume of the hollow sphere resp. the hollow cylinder decreases, whereby the working liquid is being pressed out of the hollow sphere resp. out of the hollow cylinder through the connecting pipe 45 and pipe 47, so it can do mechanical work.<br>
Fig. 6) shows a contraction motor 60 with an endless belt 62 consisting of expansion-active and contraction-active material which runs around two wheels 63 and 64. The wheels 63,64 are equipped with rewind stoppers 65 and 66 to get the same rotation.<br>
Each of the two free parts of the belt 67 and 68 in between the wheels is alternately moistened (comp. reference sign 70) and dried (comp. reference sign 72), whereby the moistening of the part 67 or 68 and the drying of the other part 68 or 67 takes place at the same time.<br>
This structure enables to deliver mechanical energy nearly continuously. By the rewind stoppers it is managed to create the same rotation of the wheels nearly continuously in the direction of the marks 69 and 71.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
