FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process of manufacturing steel drum with internal reinforcing of round seam. More particularly this invention relates to a process of making round seam joint by providing internal extra steel sheet to make round seam stronger equivalent welded joint<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
A round steel drum is made of steel sheets in various gauges. It has three components (Fig. 1)<br>
(1)	The body of the drum (I) which is a cylindrical steel sheet shell formed in round shape and welded normally by resistance welding longitudinally with a overlap joint It has corrugations (3), rolling hoops (2), and flanges (4) made on its body.<br>
(2)	Top dished end (5) which has opening for tilling and has a flange.<br>
(3)	Bottom dished end (5) also has a flange.<br>
These components are assembled by fixing up top dished ends and bottom dished ends on both sides of body shell by folding the flanges of die shell and die ends together. There is a layer of rubber seaming compound in between to make it leak proof Accordingly in a drum there are three joints made during its construction.<br>
(a)	The longitudinal joints on its body, which is resistance, welded to form a overlap joint<br>
(b)	The round seam, a round joint made for fixing the top dished ends with the body of the drum.<br>
(c)	Bottom round seam, a joint made for fixing a bottom dished ends to the body of the drum.<br>
The two round seam joints (b and c above) in a drum are similar and comparatively weaker than the longitudinal welded joint on the body of the drum and often fails when put under pressure. This invention relates to die construction design of both round seam joints in die drum with die objective of strengthening diese joints to bring it as close as possible to die welded body joints. This would give uniform strengm of the drum, which will help in downgauging the steel of the drum to achieve better packing economy.<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
The steel body shell of the drum has flanges on both the sides of the shell. The other two components i.e. top and bottom dished ends when fixed into the body shell overlap the flange on the body shell. These two flanges are folded to form the round seam joints on both sides of the body shell. To improve the efficiency of these joints they are sometimes welded which is slow and costly process. Normally the joints are formed by folding with seaming compound in between the flanges and dished ends. The folding design called double seam (fig.2) being used have five folds of sheet layers with seaming compounds in between. The improvement of mis joint already in practice is the triple / spiral seam (fig-5) which have seven layers of steel sheet folding with seaming compound in between. The triple / spiral joint is stronger than the double seam joint and can withstand more internal pressure before failure. This is because of triple / spiral seams having two external layers of sheet folds and also because of it's round construction. This design has been effectively used to downgauge the steel thickness of drum for the same capacity to reduce the packing cost per unit of material packed.<br>
The triple / spiral seam construction of the round seam has limitations of effectiveness of farther downgauging the steel and there is need for farmer reduction of gauge which can be done only by improving the efficiency of round seam further, as done in this invention.<br>
In the design of Internal Reinforcing Round seam as per the new invention mere are two additional folded layers of sheet and by this way is stronger than the triple / spiral seam which has seven layers. Accordingly this will help in downgauging the steel sheet of the drum further.<br>
Internally Reinforced design as invented can be used with double seam (fig.3) and also with triple / spiral seam (fig.6) joints. This also provides an extra barrier or leakage protection in the form of seaming compound field cavity.<br>
OBJECTIVE OF INVENTION<br>
By increasing the strength of top and bottom round seams of drum which are weaker joints by Internal reinforcing and making these joints stronger the objective of downgauge the steel sheet of the drum thereby improving the packing economy of the drum is achieved.<br><br>
INVENTION SUMMARY<br>
a)	Making steel cylindrical open end drum body by resistance welding longitudinally with overlap joint;<br>
b)	Making dished end cover with the flange all around one for Top cover with tilling openings and another bottom cover without any openings;<br>
c)	Making of circular reinforcing Ring;<br>
d)	Placing of said circular Reinforcing Ring over dished end flange from inside;<br>
e)	Placing the said dished end provided with circular Reinforcing Ring over the cylindrical open end drum body where dished end flange overlap the said circular reinforcing Ring and drum body flange; and<br>
f)	Folding the said flanges and circular Reinforcing Ring together with Rubber or any other sealing compound between the gap together to form Reinforced and stronger double seam or triple / spiral seam.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING<br>
Fig 1 shows Cross section of standard steel drum showing body (1), top bottom dished ends (5) and the round seam.<br>
Fig 2 shows Double seam presently in use for folding the body flange (4) and end flange together and pressing leaving cavities of seaming compound (7) to block leakage.<br>
Fig 3 shows Internal Reinforcing double seam by providing extra sheets (S) overlapping the seams showing additional cavities created by seaming compound (7) and the vertical support given by the extra sheet to the dished portion of the ends and other end curled and held in a groove in the dished ends.<br>
Fig 4 shows Internally Reinforced double seam with more than one sheet (8) Fig 5 shows Triple / spiral seam presently in use.<br><br>
Fig 6 shows Internally Reinforced triple / spiral seam by providing extra sheets (8) in between the seams showing additional cavities created for the seaming compound (7).<br>
Fig 7 shows Internally Reinforced with more than one sheet triple / spiral seam by providing extra sheets (8) in between overlapping the seams showing additional cavities created by seaming compound (7) by the extra sheet<br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
The round seam joints being made presently by way of double seaming or triple seaming which have five of seven layer of sheet folded together. These joints are strengthen by inserting one additional sheet in between the seam. This additional layer of sheet in the form of a flange is curled in this position. This provides extra strength to the round seam of the drum and design results in<br>
a.	Increase in the seam width by two-sheet thickness making it stronger and offering<br>
more resistance to unfolding.<br>
b.	Provides additional cavity packed with seaming compound to give additional<br>
protection against failure of the drum under pressure.<br>
These factors help in downgauging the drum sheet for better packing economy.<br>
a)	Making steel cylindrical open end drum body (1) by resistance welding longitudinally with overlap joint<br>
b)	Making dished end cover with the flange all around (5) one for top cover with filling openings and another bottom cover without any openings.<br>
c)	Making ofdrcuJar Reinforcing Ring (6).<br>
d)	Placing of said circulating Reinforcing Ring (6) over dished end flange (5) from inside.<br>
e)	Placing the said dished end (5) provided with circular Reinforcing Ring (6) over the cylindrical open end drum body (I) where dished end flange overlap the said circular reinforcing Ring and drum body flange, and<br><br>
f) Folding the said flanges and circular Reinforcing Ring together with rubber or any other sealing compound between the gap together to form reinforced and stronger double seam or triple / spiral seam.<br>
