The utilization of conductive heating elements near a fluid supply may lead to problems whereby the fluid supply interferes with the electron flow in the conductive element and electrolysis results. This can result in a general breakdown of the actuator leading to catastrophic failure.<br>

Description of Preferred and Other Embodiments<br>
The preferred embodiment is a 1600 dpi modular monolithic print head suitable for incorporation into a<br>
wide variety of page width printers and in print-on-demand camera systems. The print head is fabricated by<br>
means of Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS) technology, which refers to mechanical systems built<br>
on the micron scale, usually using technologies developed for integrated circuit fabrication.<br>
As more than 50,000 nozzles are required for a 1600 dpi A4 photographic quality page width printer,<br>
integration of the drive electronics on the same chip as the print head is essential to achieve low cost.<br>
Integration allows the number of external connections to the print head to be reduced from around 50,000 to<br>
around 100. To provide the drive electronics, the preferred embodiment integrates CMOS logic and drive<br>
transistors on the same wafer as the MEMS nozzles. MEMS has several major advantages over other<br><br>
manufacturing techniques:<br>
mechanical devices can be built with dimensions and accuracy on the micron scale;<br>
millions of mechanical devices can be made simultaneously, on the same silicon wafer; and<br>
the mechanical devices can incorporate electronics. The term "IJ46 print head" is used herein to identify print heads made according to the preferred embodiment of this invention.<br>
Operating Principle<br>
The preferred embodiment relies on the utilization of a thermally actuated lever arm which is utilized for the<br>
ejection of ink. The nozzle chamber from which ink ejection occurs includes a thin nozzle rim around which a<br>
surface meniscus is formed. A nozzle rim is formed utilizing a self aligning deposition mechanism. The<br>
preferred embodiment also includes the advantageous feature of a flood prevention rim around the ink ejection<br>
nozzle.<br>
Turning initially to Fig. 1 to Fig. 3, there will now be initially explained the operating principles of the ink jet print head of the preferred embodiment. In Fig. 1, there is illustrated a single nozzle arrangement 1 which includes a nozzle chamber 2 which is supplied via an ink supply channel 3 so as to form a meniscus 4 around a nozzle rim 5. A thermal actuator mechanism 6 is provided and includes an end paddle 7 which can be of a circular form. The paddle 7 is attached to an actuator arm 8 which pivots at a post 9. The actuator arm 8 includes two layers 10, 11 which are formed from a conductive material having a high degree of stiffness, such as titanium nitride. The bottom layer 10 forms a conductive circuit interconnected to post 9 and further includes a thinned portion near the end post 9. Hence, upon passing a current through the bottom layer 10, the bottom layer is heated in the area adjacent the post 9. Without the heating, the two layers 10, 11 are in thermal balance with one another. The heating of the bottom layer 10 causes the overall actuator mechanism 6 to bend generally upwards and hence paddle 7 as indicated in Fig. 2 undergoes a rapid upward movement. The rapid upward movement results in an increase in pressure around the rim 5 which results in a general expansion of the meniscus 4 as ink flows outside the chamber. The current to the bottom layer 10 is then turned off and the actuator arm 6, as illustrated in Fig. 3 begins to return to its quiescent position. The return results in a movement of the paddle 7 in a downward direction. This in turn results in a general sucking back of the ink around the nozzle 5. The forward momentum of the ink outside the nozzle in addition to the backward momentum of the ink within the nozzle chamber results in a drop 14 being formed as a result of a necking and breaking of the meniscus 4. Subsequently, due to surface tension effects across the meniscus 4, ink is drawn into the nozzle chamber 2 from the ink supply channel 3.<br>
The operation of the preferred embodiment has a number of significant features. Firstly, there is the aforementioned balancing of the layer 10, 11. The utilization of a second layer 11 allows for more efficient thermal operation of the actuator device 6. Further, the two layer operation ensures thermal stresses are not a problem upon cooling during manufacture, thereby reducing the likelihood of peeling during fabrication. This is illustrated in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. In Fig. 4, there is shown the process of cooling off a thermal actuator arm having two balanced material layers 20, 21 surrounding a central material layer 22. The cooling process affects each of the conductive layers 20, 21 equally resulting in a stable configuration. In Fig. 5, a thermal<br><br>
actuator arm having only one conductive layer 20 is shown. Upon cooling after manufacture, the upper layer 20 is going to bend with respect to the central layer 22. This is likely to cause problems due to the instability of the final arrangement and variations in thickness of various layers which will result in different degrees of bending.<br>
Further, the arrangement described with reference to Figs. 1 to 3 includes an ink jet spreading prevention rim 25 (Fig. 1) which is constructed so as to provide for a pit 26 around the nozzle rim 5. Any ink which should flow outside of the nozzle rim 5 is generally caught within the pit 26 around the rim and thereby prevented from flowing across the surface of the ink jet print head and influencing operation. This arrangement can be clearly seen in Fig. 11.<br>
Further, the nozzle rim 5 and ink spread prevention rim 25 are formed via a unique chemical mechanical planarization technique. This arrangement can be understood by reference to Fig. 6 to Fig. 9. Ideally, an ink ejection nozzle rim is highly symmetrical in form as illustrated at 30 in Fig. 6. The utilization of a thin highly regular rim is desirable when it is time to eject ink. For example, in Fig. 7 there is illustrated a drop being ejected from a rim during the necking and breaking process. The necking and breaking process is a high sensitive one, complex chaotic forces being involved. Should standard lithography be utilized to form the nozzle rim, it is likely that the regularity or symmetry of the rim can only be guaranteed to within a certain degree of variation in accordance with the lithographic process utilized. This may result in a variation of the rim as illustrated at 35 in Fig. 8. The rim variation leads to a non-symmetrical rim 35 as illustrated in Fig. 8. This variation is likely to cause problems when forming a droplet. The problem is illustrated in Fig. 9 wherein the meniscus 36 creeps along the surface 37 where the rim is bulging to a greater width. This results in an ejected drop likely to have a higher variance in direction of ejection.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, to overcome this problem, a self aligning chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) technique is utilized. A simplified illustration of this technique will now be discussed with reference to Fig. 10. In Fig. 10, there is illustrated a silicon substrate 40 upon which is deposited a first sacrificial layer 41 and a thin nozzle layer 42 shown in exaggerated form. The sacrificial layer is first deposited and etched so as to form a "blank" for the nozzle layer 42 which is deposited over all surfaces conformally. In an alternative manufacturing process, a further sacrificial material layer can be deposited on top of the nozzle layer 42.<br>
Next, the critical step is to chemically mechanically planarize the nozzle layer and sacrificial layers down to a first level eg. 44. The chemical mechanical planarization process acts to effectively "chop off the top layers down to level 44. Through the utilization of conformal deposition, a regular rim is produced. The result, after chemical mechanical planarization, is illustrated schematically in Fig. 11.<br>
The description of the preferred embodiments will now proceed by first describing an ink jet preheating step preferably utilized in the IJ46 device.<br>
Ink Preheating<br>
In the preferred embodiment, an ink preheating step is utilized so as to bring the temperature of the<br>
print head arrangement to be within a predetermined bound. The steps utilized are illustrated at 101 in Fig.<br>
12. Initially, the decision to initiate a printing run is made at 102. Before any printing has begun, the current<br><br>
temperature of the print head is sensed to determine whether it is above a predetermined threshold. If the heated temperature is too low, a preheat cycle 104 is applied which heats the print head by means of heating the thermal actuators to be above a predetermined temperature of operation. Once the temperature has achieved a predetermined temperature, the normal print cycle 105 is begun.<br>
The utilization of the preheating step 104 results in a general reduction in possible variation in factors such as viscosity etc. allowing for a narrower operating range of the device and the utilization of lower thermal , energies in ink ejection.<br>
The preheating step can take a number of different forms. Where the ink ejection device is of a thermal bend actuator type, it would normally receive a series of clock pulse as illustrated in Fig. 13 with the ejection of ink requiring a clock pulses 110 of a predetermined duration so as to provide enough energy for ejection.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 14, when it is desired to provide for preheating capabilities, these can be provided through the utilization of a series of shorter pulses eg. Ill which whilst providing thermal energy to the print head, fail to cause ejection of the ink from the ink ejection nozzle.<br>
Fig. 16 illustrates a graph of print head temperature during a printing operation. Assuming the print head has been idle for a substantial period of time, the print head temperature, initially 115, will be the ambient temperature. When it is desired to print, a preheating step (104 of Fig. 12) is executed such that the temperature rises as shown at 116 to an operational temperature T2 at 117, at which point printing can begin and the temperature left to fluctuate in accordance with usage requirements.<br>
Alternately, as illustrated in Fig. 16, the print head temperature can be continuously monitored such that should the temperature fall below a threshold eg. 120, a series of preheating cycles are injected into the printing process so as to increase the temperature to 121, above the predetermined threshold.<br>
Assuming the ink utilized has properties substantially similar to that of water, the utilization of the preheating step can take advantage of the substantial fluctuations in ink viscosity with temperature. Of course, other operational factors may be significant and the stabilisation to a narrower temperature range provides for advantageous effects. As the viscosity changes with changing temperature, it would be readily evident that the degree of preheating required above the ambient temperature will be dependent upon the ambient temperature and the equilibrium temperature of the print head during printing operations. Hence, the degree of preheating may be varied in accordance with the measured ambient temperature so as to provide for optimal results.<br>
A simple operational schematic is illustrated at Fig. 17 with the print head 130 including an on-board series of temperature sensors which are connected to a temperature determination unit 131 for determining the current temperature which in turn outputs to an ink ejection drive unit 132 which determines whether preheating is required at any particular stage. The on-chip (print head) temperature sensors can be simple MEMS temperature sensors, the construction of which.is well known to those skilled in the art.<br><br>
Manufacturing Process<br>
IJ46 device manufacture can be constructed from a combination of standard CMOS processing, and<br>
MEMS postprocessing. Ideally, no materials should be used in the MEMS portion of the processing which are<br>
not already in common use for CMOS processing. In the preferred embodiment, the only MEMS materials are<br>
PECVD glass, sputtered TiN, and a sacrificial material (which may be polyimide, PSG, BPSG, aluminum , or<br>
other materials). Ideally, to fit corresponding drive circuits between the nozzles without increasing chip area,<br>
the minimum process is a 0.5 micron, one poly, 3 metal CMOS process with aluminum metalization. However,<br>
any more advanced process can be used instead. Alternatively, NMOS, bipolar, BiCMOS, or other processes<br>
may be used. CMOS is recommended only due to its prevalence in the industry, and the availability of large<br>
amounts of CMOS fab capacity.<br>
For a 100 mm photographic print head using the CMY process color model, the CMOS process<br>
implements a simple circuit consisting of 19,200 stages of shift register, 19,200 bits of transfer register, 19,200<br>
enable gates, and 19,200 drive transistors. There are also some clock buffers and enable decoders. The clock<br>
speed of a photo print head is only 3.8 MHz, and a 30 ppm A4 print head is only 14 MHz, so the CMOS<br>
performance is not critical. The CMOS process is fully completed, including passivation and opening of bond<br>
pads before the MEMS processing begins. This allows the CMOS processing to be completed in a standard<br>
CMOS fab, with the MEMS processing being performed in a separate facility.<br>
Reasons for Process Choices<br>
It will be understood by those skilled in the art of manufacture of MEMS devices that there are many<br>
possible process sequences for the manufacture of an IJ46 print head. The process sequence described here is<br>
based on a 'generic' 0.5 micron (drawn) n-well CMOS process with 1 poly and three metal layers. This table<br>
outlines the reasons for some of the choices of this 'nominal' process, to make it easier to determine the effect<br>
of any alternative process choices.<br><br><br><br>
Example Process Sequence (Including CMOS Steps)<br>
Although many different CMOS and other processes can be used, this process description is combined<br>
with an example CMOS process to show where MEMS features are integrated in the CMOS masks, and show<br>
where the CMOS process may be simplified due to the low CMOS performance requirements.<br>
Process steps described below are part of the example 'generic' 1P3M 0.5 micron CMOS process.<br>
1.	As shown in Fig. 18, processing starts with a standard 6" p-type  wafer. (8" wafers can also be<br>
used, giving a substantial increase in primary yield).<br>
2.	Using the n-well mask of Fig. 19, implant the n-well transistor portions 210 of Fig. 20.<br>
3.	Grow a thin layer of Si02 and deposit Si3N4 forming a field oxide hard mask.<br>
4.	Etch the nitride and oxide using the active mask of Fig. 22. The mask is oversized to allow for the LOCOS bird's beak. The nozzle chamber region is incorporated in this mask, as field oxide is excluded from the nozzle chamber. The result is a series of oxide regions 212, illustrated in Fig. 23.<br><br>
5.	Implant the channel-stop using the n-well mask with a negative resist, or using a complement of the n-well mask.<br>
6.	Perform any required channel stop implants as required by the CMOS process used.<br><br>
7.	Grow 0.5 micron of field oxide using LOCOS.<br>
8.	Perform any required n/p transistor threshold voltage adjustments. Depending upon the characteristics of the CMOS process, it may be possible to omit the threshold adjustments. This is because the operating frequency is only 3.8 MHz, and the quality of the p-devices is not critical. The n-transistor threshold is more significant, as the on-resistance of the n-channel drive transistor has a significant effect on the efficiency and power consumption while printing.<br><br>
9.	Grow the gate oxide.<br>
10.	Deposit 0.3 microns of poly, and pattern using the poly mask illustrated in Fig. 25 so as to form poly portions 214 shown in Fig. 26.<br>
11.	Perform the n+ implant shown at 216 in Fig. 29 using the n+ mask shown in Fig. 28. The use of a drain engineering process such as LDD should not be required, as the performance of the transistors is not critical.<br>
12.	Perform the p+ implant shown at 218 in Fig. 32, using a complement of the n+mask shown in Fig. 31, or using the n+ mask with a negative resist. The nozzle chamber region will be doped either n+ or p+ depending upon whether it is included in the n+ mask or not. The doping of this silicon region is not relevant as it is subsequently etched, and the STS ASE etch process recommended does not use boron as an etch stop.<br>
13.	Deposit 0.6 microns of PECVD TEOS glass to form ILD I, shown at 220 in Fig. 35.<br>
14.	Etch the contact cuts using the contact mask of Fig. 34. The nozzle region is treated as a single large contact region, and will not pass typical design rule checks. This region should therefore be excluded from the DRC.<br>
15.	Deposit 0.6 microns of aluminum to form metal 1.<br>
16.	Etch the aluminum using the metal 1 mask shown in Fig. 37 so as to form metal regions 224 shown in Fig. 38. The nozzle metal region is covered with metal 1 as at 225. This aluminum 225 is sacrificial, and is etched as part of the MEMS sequence. The inclusion of metal 1 in the nozzle is not essential, but helps reduce the step in the neck region of the actuator lever arm.<br>
17.	Deposit 0.7 microns of PECVD TEOS glass to form ILD 2 regions 228 as shown in Fig. 41.<br>
18.	Etch the contact cuts using the via 1 mask shown in Fig. 40. The nozzle region is treated as a single large via region, and again it will not pass DRC.<br>
19.	Deposit 0.6 microns of aluminum to form metal 2.<br>
20.	Etch the aluminum using the metal 2 mask shown in Fig. 42 so as to form metal portions 230 shown in Fig. 43. The nozzle region 231 is fully covered with metal 2. This aluminum is sacrificial, and is etched as part of the MEMS sequence. The inclusion of metal 2 in the nozzle is not essential, but helps reduce the step in the neck region of the actuator lever arm. Sacrificial metal 2 is also used for another fluid control feature. A relatively large rectangle of metal 2 is included in the neck region 233 of the nozzle chamber. This is connected to the sacrificial metal 3, so is also removed during the MEMS sacrificial aluminum etch. This undercuts the lower rim of the nozzle chamber entrance for the actuator (which is formed from ILD 3). The undercut adds 90 degrees to an angle of the fluid control surface, and thus increases the ability of this rim to prevent ink surface spread.<br>
21.	Deposit 0.7 microns of PECVD TEOS glass to form ILD 3.<br>
22.	Etch the contact cuts using the via 2 mask shown in Fig. 45 so as to leave portions 236 shown in Fig. 46. As well as the nozzle chamber, fluid control rims are also formed in ILD 3. These will also not pass DRC.<br>
23.	Deposit 1.0 microns of aluminum to form metal 3.<br>
24.	Etch the aluminum using the metal 3 mask shown in Fig. 47 so as to leave portions 238 as shown in Fig. 48. Most of metal 3 as shown at 239 is a sacrificial layer used to separate the actuator and paddle from<br><br>
the chip surface. Metal 3 is also used to distribute V+ over the chip. The nozzle region is fully covered with metal 3 as shown at 240. This aluminum is sacrificial, and is etched as part of the MEMS sequence. The inclusion of metal 3 in the nozzle is not essential, but helps reduce the step in the neck region of the actuator lever arm.<br>
25.	Deposit 0,5 microns of PECVD TEOS glass to form the overglass.<br>
26.	Deposit 0.5 microns of S13N4 to form the passivation layer.<br>
27.	Etch the passivation and overglass using the via 3 mask shown in Fig. 50 so as to form the arrangement of Fig. 51. This mask includes access 242 to the metal 3 sacrificial layer, and the vias 243 to the heater actuator. Lithography of this step has 0.6 micron critical dimensions (for the heater vias) instead of the normally relaxed lithography used for opening bond pads. This is the one process step which is different from the normal CMOS process flow. This step may either be the last process step of the CMOS process, or the first step of the MEMS process, depending upon the fab setup and transport requirements.<br>
28.	Wafer Probe. Much, but not all, of the functionality of the chips can be determined at this stage. If more complete testing at this stage is required, an active dummy load can be included on chip for each drive transistor. This can be achieved with minor chip area penalty, and allows complete testing of the CMOS circuitry.<br>
29.	Transfer the wafers from the CMOS facility to the MEMS facility. These may be in the same fab, or may be distantly located.<br>
30.	Deposit 0.9 microns of magnetron sputtered TiN. Voltage is -65V, magnetron current is 7.5 A, argon gas pressure is 0.3 Pa, temperature is 300 °C. This results in a coefficient of thermal expansion of 9.4 x 10"6 /QC, and a Young's modulus of 600 GPa [Thin Solid Films 270 p 266, 1995], which are the key thin film properties used.<br>
31.	Etch the TiN using the heater mask shown in Fig. 53. This mask defines the heater element, paddle arm, and paddle. There is a small gap 247 shown in Fig. 54 between the heater and the TiN layer of the paddle and paddle arm. This is to prevent electrical connection between the heater and the ink, and possible electrolysis problems. Moreover, the small gap 247 shown in Fig. 4 provides a dielectric barrier between the heater and the TiN layer of the paddle and paddle arm. This gap can be an air gap or might be filled with other electrically insulative material. Moreover, the means providing a dielectric barrier could be an air gap or other electrically insulative material disposed between two components or connecting to components. Sub-micron accuracy is required in this step to maintain a uniformity of heater characteristics across the wafer. This is the main reason that the heater is not etched simultaneously with the other actuator layers. CD for the heater mask is 0.5 microns. Overlay accuracy is +/- 0.1 microns. The bond pads are also covered with this layer of TiN. This is to prevent the bond pads being etched away during the sacrificial aluminum etch. It also prevents corrosion of the aluminum bond pads during operation. TiN is an excellent corrosion barrier for aluminum . The resistivity of TiN is low enough to not cause problems with the bond pad resistance.<br>
32.	Deposit 2 microns of PECVD glass. This is preferably done at around 350 °C to 400 °C to minimize intrinsic stress in the glass. Thermal stress could be reduced by a lower deposition temperature, however thermal stress is actually beneficial, as the glass is sandwiched between two layers of TiN. The<br><br>
TiN/glass/TiN tri-layer cancels bend due to thermal stress, and results in the glass being under constant compressive stress, which increases the efficiency of the actuator.<br>
33.	Deposit 0.9 microns of magnetron sputtered TiN. This layer is deposited to cancel bend from the differential thermal stress of the lower TiN and glass layers, and prevent the paddle from curling when released from the sacrificial materials. The deposition characteristics should be identical to the first TiN layer.<br>
34.	Anisotropically plasma etch the TiN and glass using actuator mask as shown in Fig. 56. This mask defines the actuator and paddle. CD for the actuator mask is 1 micron. Overlay accuracy is +/- 0.1 microns. The results of the etching process is illustrated in Fig. 57 with the glass layer 250 sandwiched between TiN layers 251, 248.<br>
35.	Electrical testing can be performed by wafer probing at this time. All CMOS tests and heater functionality and resistance tests can be completed at wafer probe.<br>
36.	Deposit 15 microns of sacrificial material. There are many possible choices for this material. The essential requirements are the ability to deposit a 15 micron layer without excessive wafer warping, and a high etch selectivity to PECVD glass and TiN. Several possibilities are phosphosilicate glass (PSG), borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG), polymers such as polyimide, and aluminum . Either a close CTE match to silicon (BPSG with the correct doping, filled polyimide) or a low Young's modulus (aluminum ) is required. This example uses BPSG. Of these issues, stress is the most demanding due to the extreme layer thickness- BPSG normally has a CTE well below that of silicon, resulting in considerable compressive stress. However, the composition of BPSG can be varied significantly to adjust its CTE close to that of silicon. As the BPSG is a sacrificial layer, its electrical properties are not relevant, and compositions not normally suitable as a CMOS dielectric can be used. Low density, high porosity, and a high water content are all beneficial characteristics as they will increase the etch selectivity versus PECVD glass when using an anhydrous HF etch.<br>
37.	Etch the sacrificial layer to a depth of 2 microns using the nozzle mask as defined in Fig. 59 so as to form the structure 254 illustrated in section in Fig. 60. The mask of Fig. 59 defines ail of the regions where a subsequently deposited overcoat is to be polished off using CMP. This includes the nozzles themselves, and various other fluid control features. CD for the nozzle mask is 2 microns. Overlay accuracy is +/- 0.5 microns.<br>
38.	Anisotropically plasma etch the sacrificial layer down to the CMOS passivation layer using the chamber mask as illustrated in Fig. 62. This mask defines the nozzle chamber and actuator shroud including slots 255 as shown in Fig. 63. CD for the chamber mask is 2 microns. Overlay accuracy is +/- 0.2 microns.<br>
39.	Deposit 0.5 microns of fairly conformal overcoat material 257 as illustrated in Fig. 65. The electrical properties of this material are irrelevant, and it can be a conductor, insulator, or semiconductor. The material should be: chemically inert, strong, highly selective etch with respect to the sacrificial material, be suitable for CMP, and be suitable for conformal deposition at temperatures below 500 °C. Suitable materials include: PECVD glass, MOCVD TiN, ECR CVD TiN, PECVD Si3N4, and many others. The choice for this example is PECVD TEOS glass. This must have a very low water content if BPSG is used as the sacrificial material and anhydrous HF is used as the sacrificial etchant, as the anhydrous HF etch<br><br>
relies on water content to achieve 1000:1 etch selectivity of BPSG over TEOS glass. The conformed overcoat 257 forms a protective covering shell around the operational portions of the thermal bend actuator while permitting movement of the actuator within the shell.<br>
40.	Planarize the wafer to a depth of 1 micron using CMP as illustrated in Fig. 67. The CMP processing should be maintained to an accuracy of+/- 0.5 microns over the wafer surface. Dishing of the sacrificial material is not relevant. This opens the nozzles 259 and fluid control regions e.g. 260. The rigidity of the sacrificial layer relative to the nozzle chamber structures during CMP is one of the key factors which may affect the choice of sacrificial materials.<br>
41.	Turn the print head wafer over and securely mount the front surface on an oxidized silicon wafer blank 262 illustrated in Fig. 69 having an oxidized surface 263. The mounting can be by way of glue 265. The blank wafers 262 can be recycled.<br>
42.	Thin the print head wafer to 300 microns using backgrinding (or etch) and polish. The wafer thinning is performed to reduce the subsequent processing duration for deep silicon etching from around 5 hours to around 2.3 hours. The accuracy of the deep silicon etch is also improved, and the hard-mask thickness is halved to 2.5 microns. The wafers could be thinned further to improve etch duration and print head efficiency. The limitation to wafer thickness is the print head fragility after sacrificial BPSG etch.<br>
43.	Deposit a Si02 hard mask (2.5 microns of PECVD glass) on the backside of the wafer and pattern using the inlet mask as shown in Fig. 67. The hard mask of Fig. 67 is used for the subsequent deep silicon etch, which is to a depth of 315 microns with a hard mask selectivity of 150:1. This mask defines the ink inlets, which are etched through the wafer. CD for the inlet mask is 4 microns. Overlay accuracy is +/- 2 microns. The inlet mask is undersize by 5.25 microns on each side to allow for a re-entrant etch angle of 91 degrees over a 300 micron etch depth. Lithography for this step uses a mask aligner instead of a stepper. Alignment is to patterns on the front of the wafer. Equipment is readily available to allow sub-micron front-to-back alignment.<br>
44.	Back-etch completely through the silicon wafer (using, for example, an ASE Advanced Silicon Etcher from Surface Technology Systems) through the previously deposited hard mask. The STS ASE is capable of etching highly accurate holes through the wafer with aspect ratios of 30:1 and sidewalls of 90 degrees. In this case, a re-entrant sidewall angle of 91 degrees is taken as nominal. A re-entrant angle is chosen because the ASE performs better, with a higher etch rate for a given accuracy, with a slightly re-entrant angle. Also, a re-entrant etch can be compensated by making the holes on the mask undersize. Non-reentrant etch angles cannot be so easily compensated, because the mask holes would merge. The wafer is also preferably diced by this etch. The final result is as illustrated in Fig. 69 including back etched ink channel portions 264.<br>
45.	Etch all exposed aluminum . Aluminum on all three layers is used as sacrificial layers in certain places.<br>
46.	Etch all of the sacrificial material. The nozzle chambers are cleared by this etch with the result being as shown in Fig. 71. If BPSG is used as the sacrificial material, it can be removed without etching the CMOS glass layers or the actuator glass. This can be achieved with 1000:1 selectivity against undoped glass such as TEOS, using anhydrous HF at 1500 seem in a N2 atmosphere at 60 °C [L. Chang et al, "Anhydrous HF etch reduces processing steps for DRAM capacitors", Solid State Technology Vol. 41 No. 5, pp 71-76,<br><br>
1998]. The actuators are freed and the chips are separated from each other, and from the blank wafer, by this etch. If aluminum is used as the sacrificial layer instead of BPSG, then its removal is combined with the previous step, and this step is omitted.<br>
47.	Pick up the loose print heads with a vacuum probe, and mount the print heads in their packaging. This must be done carefully, as the unpackaged print heads are fragile. The front surface of the wafer is especially fragile, and should not be touched. This process should be performed manually, as it is difficult. to automate. The package is a custom injection molded plastic housing incorporating ink channels that supply the appropriate color ink to the ink inlets at the back of the print head. The package also provides mechanical support to the print head. The package is especially designed to place minimal stress on the chip, and to distribute that stress evenly along the length of the package. The print head is glued into this package with a compliant sealant such as silicone.<br>
48.	Form the external connections to the print head chip. For a low profile connection with minimum disruption of airflow, tape automated bonding (TAB) may be used. Wire bonding may also be used if the printer is to be operated with sufficient clearance to the paper. All of the bond pads are along one 100 mm edge of the chip. There are a total of 504 bond pads, in 8 identical groups of 63 (as the chip is fabricated using 8 stitched stepper steps). Each bond pad is 100 x 100 micron, with a pitch of 200 micron. 256 of the bond pads are used to provide power and ground connections to the actuators, as the peak current is 6.58 Amps at 3 V. There are a total of 40 signal connections to the entire print head (24 data and 16 control), which are mostly bussed to the eight identical sections of the print head.<br>
49.	Hydrophobize the front surface of the print heads. This can be achieved by the vacuum deposition of 50 nm or more of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). However, there are also many other ways to achieve this. As the fluid is fully controlled by mechanical protuberances formed in previous steps, the hydrophobic layer is an 'optional extra' to prevent ink spreading on the surface if the print head becomes contaminated by dust.<br>
50.	Plug the print heads into their sockets. The socket provides power, data, and ink. The ink fills the print-head by capillarity. Allow the completed print heads to fill with ink, and test. Fig. 74 illustrates the filling of ink 268 into the nozzle chamber.<br>
Process Parameters used for this Implementation Example<br>
The CMOS process parameters utilized can be varied to suit any CMOS process of 0.5 micron<br>
dimensions or better. The MEMS process parameters should not be varied beyond the tolerances shown<br>
below. Some of these parameters affect the actuator performance and fluidics, while others have more obscure<br>
relationships. For example, the wafer thin stage affects the cost and accuracy of the deep silicon etch, the<br>
thickness of the back-side hard mask, and the dimensions of the associated plastic ink channel molding.<br>
Suggested process parameters can be as follows:<br><br><br>
Control Logic<br>
Turning to Fig. 76, there is illustrated the associated control logic for a single ink jet nozzle. The<br>
control logic 280 is utilized to activate a heater element 281 on demand. The control logic 280 includes a shift register 282, a transfer register 283 and a firing control gate 284. The basic operation is to shift data from one shift register 282 to the next until it is in place. Subsequently, the data is transferred to a transfer register 283 upon activation of a transfer enable signal 286. The data is latched in the transfer register 283 and subsequently, a firing phase control signal 289 is utilized to activate the gate 284 for output of a heating pulse to heat the element 281.<br>
As the preferred implementation utilizes a CMOS layer for implementation of all control circuitry, one form of suitable CMOS implementation of the control circuitry will now be described. Turning now to Fig. 77, there is illustrated a schematic block diagram of the corresponding CMOS circuitry. Firstly, shift register 282 takes an inverted data input and latches the input under control of shift clocking signals 291, 292. The data input 290 is output 294 to the next shift register and is also latched by transfer register 283 under control of transfer enable signals 296, 297. The enable gate 284 is activated under the control of enable signal 299 so<br><br>
as to drive a power transistor 300 which allows for resistive heating of resistor 281. The functionality of the shift register 282, transfer register 283 and enable gate 284 are standard CMOS components well understood by those skilled in the art of CMOS circuit design.<br>
Replicated Units<br>
The ink jet print head can consist of a large number of replicated unit cells each of which has basically<br>
the same design. This design will now be discussed.<br>
Turning initially to Fig. 78, there is illustrated a general key or legend of different material layers utilized in subsequent discussions.<br>
Fig. 79 illustrates the unit cell 305 on a 1 micron grid 306. The unit cell 305 is copied and replicated a large number of times with Fig. 79 illustrating the diffusion and poly-layers in addition to vias 308. The signals 290, 291, 292, 296, 297 and 299 are as previously discussed with reference to Fig. 77. A number of important aspects of Fig. 79 include the general layout including the shift register, transfer register and gate and drive transistor. Importantly, the drive transistor 300 includes an upper poly-layer e.g. 309 which is laid out having a large number of perpendicular traces 212. The perpendicular traces are important in ensuring that the corrugated nature of a heater element formed over the power transistor 300 will have a corrugated bottom with corrugations running generally in the perpendicular direction of trace 212. This is best shown in Figures 69, 71 and 74. Consideration of the nature and directions of the corrugations, which arise unavoidably due to the CMOS wiring underneath, is important to the ultimate operational efficiency of the actuator. In the ideal situation, the actuator is formed without corrugations by including a planarization step on the upper surface of the substrate step prior to forming the actuator. However, the best compromise that obviates the additional process step is to ensure that the corrugations extend in a direction that is transverse to the bending axis of the actuator as illustrated in the examples, and preferably constant along its length. This results in an actuator that may only be 2% less efficient than a flat actuator, which in many situations will be an acceptable result. By contrast, corrugations that extend longitudinally would reduce the efficiency by about 20% compared to a flat actuator.<br>
In Fig. 80, there is illustrated the addition of the first level metal layer which includes enable lines 296, 297.<br>
In Fig. 81, there is illustrated the second level metal layer which includes data in-line 290, SClock line 291, SClock 292, Q 294, TEn 296 and TEn 297, V- 320, VDD 321, Vss 322, in addition to associated reflected components 323 to 328. The portions 330 and 331 are utilized as a sacrificial etch.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 82 there is illustrated the third level metal layer which includes a portion 340 which is utilized as a sacrificial etch layer underneath the heater actuator. The portion 341 is utilized as part of the actuator structure with the portions 342 and 343 providing electrical interconnections.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 83, there is illustrated the planar conductive heating circuit layer including heater arms 350 and 351 which are interconnected to the lower layers. The heater arms are formed on either side of a tapered slot so that they are narrower toward the fixed or proximal end of the actuator arm, giving increased resistance and therefore heating and expansion in that region. The second portion of the heating circuit layer 352 is electrically isolated from the arms 350 and 351 by a discontinuity 355 and provides for structural<br><br>
support for the main paddle 356. The discontinuity may take any suitable form but is typically a narrow slot as shown at 355.<br>
In Fig. 84 there is illustrated the portions of the shroud and nozzle layer including shroud 353 and outer nozzle chamber 354.<br>
Turning to Fig. 85, there is illustrated a portion 360 of an array of ink ejection nozzles which are divided into three groups 361 - 363 with each group providing separate color output (cyan, magenta and yellow) so as to provide full three color printing. A series of standard cell clock buffers and address decoders 364 is also provided in addition to bond pads 365 for interconnection with the external circuitry.<br>
Each color group 361, 363 consists of two spaced apart rows of ink ejection nozzles e.g. 367 each having a heater actuator element.<br>
Fig. 87 illustrates one form of overall layout in a cut away manner with a first area 370 illustrating the layers up to the polysilicon level. A second area 371 illustrates the layers up to the first level metal, the area 372 illustrates the layers up to the second level metal and the area 373 illustrates the layers up to the heater actuator layer.<br>
The ink ejection nozzles are grouped in two groups of 10 nozzles sharing a common ink channel through the wafer. Turning to Fig. 88, there is illustrated the back surface of the wafer which includes a series of ink supply channels 380 for supplying ink to a front surface.<br>
Replication<br>
The unit cell is replicated 19,200 times on the 4" print head, in the hierarchy as shown in the replication<br>
hierarchy table below. The layout grid is 1/2 1 at 0.5 micron (0.125 micron). Many of the ideal transform<br>
distances fall exactly on a grid point. Where they do not, the distance is rounded to the nearest grid point. The<br>
rounded numbers are shown with an asterisk.. The transforms are measured from the center of the<br>
corresponding nozzles in all cases. The transform of a group of five even nozzles into five odd nozzles also<br>
involves a 180° rotation. The translation for this step occurs from a position where all five pairs of nozzle<br>
centers are coincident.<br><br><br>
Composition<br>
Taking the example of a 4-inch print head suitable for use in camera photoprinting as illustrated in Fig.<br>
89, a 4-inch print head 380 consists of 8 segments 381, each segment being 1/2 an inch in length. Consequently each of the segments prints bi-Ievel cyan, magenta and yellow dots over a different part of the page to produce the final image. The positions of the 8 segments are shown in Fig. 89. In this example, the print head is assumed to print dots at 1600 dpi, each dot being 15.875 microns in diameter. Thus each half-inch segment prints 800 dots, with the 8 segments corresponding to positions as illustrated in the following table: <br><br>
Although each segment produces 800 dots of the final image, each dot is represented by a combination of bi-level cyan, magenta, and yellow ink. Because the printing is bi-level, the input image should be dithered or error-diffused for best results.<br>
Each segment 381 contains 2,400 nozzles: 800 each of cyan, magenta, and yellow. A four-inch print head contains 8 such segments for a total of 19,200 nozzles.<br>
The nozzles within a single segment are grouped for reasons of physical stability as well as minimization of power consumption during printing. In terms of physical stability, as shown in Fig. 88 groups of 10 nozzles are grouped together and share the same ink channel reservoir. In terms of power consumption, the groupings are made so that only 96 nozzles are fired simultaneously from the entire print head. Since the 96 nozzles should be maximally distant, 12 nozzles are fired from each segment. To fire all 19,200 nozzles, 200 different sets of 96 nozzles must be fired.<br>
Fig. 90 shows schematically, a single pod 395 which consists of 10 nozzles numbered 1 to 10 sharing a common ink channel supply. 5 nozzles are in one row, and 5 are in another. Each nozzle produces dots 15.875(im in diameter. The nozzles are numbered according to the order in which they must be fired.<br>
Although the nozzles are fired in this order, the relationship of nozzles and physical placement of dots on the printed page is different. The nozzles from one row represent the even dots from one line on the page, and the nozzles on the other row represent the odd dots from the adjacent line on the page. Fig. 91 shows the same pod 395 with the nozzles numbered according to the order in which they must be loaded.<br>
The nozzles within a pod are therefore logically separated by the width of 1 dot. The exact distance between the nozzles will depend on the properties of the ink jet firing mechanism. In the best case, the print head could be designed with staggered nozzles designed to match the flow of paper. In the worst case there is an error of 1/3200 dpi. While this error would be viewable under a microscope for perfectly straight lines, it certainly will not be apparent in a photographic image.<br>
As shown in Fig. 92, three pods representing Cyan 398, Magenta 397, and Yellow 396 units, are grouped into a tripod 400. A tripod represents the same horizontal set of 10 dots, but on different lines. The exact distance between different color pods depends on the ink jet operating parameters, and may vary from one ink jet to another. The distance can be considered to be a constant number of dot-widths, and must therefore be taken into account when printing: the dots printed by the cyan nozzles will be for different lines than those printed by the magenta or yellow nozzles. The printing algorithm must allow for a variable distance up to about 8 dot-widths.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 93, 10 tripods 404 are organized into a singlepodgroup 405. Since each tripod contains 30 nozzles, each podgroup contains 300 nozzles: 100 cyan, 100 magenta and 100 yellow nozzles. The arrangement is shown schematically in Fig. 93, with tripods numbered 0-9. The distance between adjacent tripods is exaggerated for clarity.<br>
As shown in Fig. 94, two podgroups (PodgroupA 410 and PodgroupB 411) are organized into a single flregroup 414, with 4 firegroups in each segment 415. Each segment 415 contains 4 firegroups. The distance between adjacent firegroups is exaggerated for clarit"<br><br><br>
Load And Print Cycles<br>
The print head contains a total of 19,200 nozzles. A Print Cycle involves the firing of up to all of these<br>
nozzles, dependent on the information to be printed. A Load Cycle involves the loading up of the print head<br>
with the information to be printed during the subsequent Print Cycle.<br>
Each nozzle has an associated NozzleEnable (289 of Fig. 76) bit that determines whether or not the<br>
nozzle will fire during the Print Cycle. The NozzleEnable bits (one per nozzle) are loaded via a set of shift<br>
registers.<br>
Logically there are 3 shift registers per color, each 800 deep. As bits are shifted into the shift register they are directed to the lower and upper nozzles on alternate pulses. Internally, each 800-deep shift register is comprised of two 400-deep shift registers: one for the upper nozzles, and one for the lower nozzles. Alternate bits are shifted into the alternate internal registers. As far as the external interface is concerned however, there is a single 800 deep shift register.<br>
Once all the shift registers have been fully loaded (800 pulses), all of the bits are transferred in parallel to the appropriate NozzleEnable bits. This equates to a single parallel transfer of 19,200 bits. Once the transfer has taken place, the Print Cycle can begin. The Print Cycle and the Load Cycle can occur simultaneously as long as the parallel load of all NozzleEnable bits occurs at the end of the Print Cycle.<br>
In order to print a 6" x 4" image at 1600 dpi in say 2 seconds, the 4" print head must print 9,600 lines (6 x 1600). Rounding up to 10,000 lines in 2 seconds yields a line time of 200 microseconds. A single Print Cycle and a single Load Cycle must both finish within this time. In addition, a physical process external to the print head must move the paper an appropriate amount.<br>
Load Cycle<br>
The Load Cycle is concerned with loading the print head's shift registers with the next Print Cycle's<br>
NozzleEnable bits.<br>
Each segment has 3 inputs directly related to the cyan, magenta, and yellow pairs of shift registers. These inputs are called CDataln, MDataln, and YDataln. Since there are 8 segments, there are a total of 24 color input lines per print head. A single pulse on the SRClock line (shared between all 8 segments) transfers 24 bits into the appropriate shift registers. Alternate pulses transfer bits to the lower and upper nozzles respectively. Since there are 19,200 nozzles, a total of 800 pulses are required for the transfer. Once all 19,200 bits have been transferred, a single pulse on the shared PTransfer line causes the parallel transfer of data from the shift registers to the appropriate NozzleEnable bits. The parallel transfer via a pulse on PTransfer must<br><br>
take place after the Print Cycle has finished. Otherwise the NozzleEnable bits for the line being printed will be incorrect.<br>
Since all 8 segments are loaded with a single SRClock pulse, the printing software must produce the data in the correct sequence for the print head. As an example, the first SRClock pulse will transfer the C, M, and Y bits for the next Print Cycle's dot 0, 800, 1600, 2400, 3200, 4000,4800, and 5600. The second SRClock pulse will transfer the C, M, and Y bits for the next Print Cycle's dot 1, 801, 1601, 2401, 3201, 4001, 4801 and 5601. After 800 SRClock pulses, the PTransfer pulse can be given.<br>
It is important to note that the odd and even C, M, and Y outputs, although printed during the same Print Cycle, do not appear on the same physical output line. The physical separation of odd and even nozzles within the print head, as well as separation between nozzles of different colors ensures that they will produce dots on different lines of the page. This relative difference must be accounted for when loading the data into the print head. The actual difference in lines depends on the characteristics of the ink jet used in the print head. The differences can be defined by variables D( and D2 where Di is the distance between nozzles of different colors (likely value 4 to 8), and D2 is the distance between nozzles of the same color (likely value = 1). Table 3 shows the dots transferred to segment n of a print head on the first 4 pulses.<br><br>
And so on for all 800 pulses. The 800 SRClock pulses (each clock pulse transferring 24 bits) must take place within the 200 microseconds line time. Therefore the average time to calculate the bit value for each of the 19,200 nozzles must not exceed 200 microseconds /19200 = 10 nanoseconds. Data can be clocked into the print head at a maximum rate of 10 MHz, which will load the data in 80 microseconds. Clocking the data in at 4 MHz will load the data in 200 microseconds.<br>
Print Cycle<br>
The print head contains 19,200 nozzles. To fire them all at once would consume too much power and<br>
be problematic in terms of ink refill and nozzle interference. A single print cycle therefore consists of 200<br>
different phases. 96 maximally distant nozzles are fired in each phase, for a total of 19,200 nozzles.<br>
•	4 bits TripodSelect (select 1 of 10 tripods from a firegroup)<br>
The 96 nozzles fired each round equate to 12 per segment (since all segments are wired up to accept the same print signals). The 12 nozzles from a given segment come equally from each firegroup. Since there are 4 firegroups, 3 nozzles fire from each firegroup. The 3 nozzles are one per color. The nozzles are determined by:<br>
•	4 bits NozzleSelect (select 1 of 10 nozzles from a pod)<br>
The duration of the firing pulse is given by the AEnable and BEnable lines, which fire the PodgroupA<br><br>
and PodgroupB nozzles from all firegroups respectively. The duration of a pulse depends on the viscosity of the ink (dependent on temperature and ink characteristics) and the amount of power available to the print head. The AEnable and BEnable are separate lines in order that the firing pulses can overlap. Thus the 200 phases of a Print Cycle consist of 100 A phases and 100 B phases, effectively giving 100 sets of Phase A and Phase B.<br>
When a nozzle fires, it takes approximately 100 microseconds to refill. This is not a problem since the entire Print Cycle takes 200 microseconds. The firing of a nozzle also causes perturbations for a limited time within the common ink channel of that nozzle's pod. The perturbations can interfere with the firing of another nozzle within the same pod. Consequently, the firing of nozzles within a pod should be offset by at least this amount. The procedure is to therefore fire three nozzles from a tripod (one nozzle per color) and then move onto the next tripod within the podgroup. Since there are 10 tripods in a given podgroup, 9 subsequent tripods must fire before the original tripod must fire its next three nozzles. The 9 firing intervals of 2 microseconds gives an ink settling time of 18 microseconds.<br>
Consequently, the firing order is:<br>
TripodSelect 0, NozzIeSelect 0 (Phases A and B)<br>
TripodSelect 1, NozzIeSelect 0 (Phases A and B)<br>
TripodSelect 2, NozzIeSelect 0 (Phases A and B)<br>
TripodSelect 9, NozzIeSelect 0 (Phases A and B) TripodSelect 0, NozzIeSelect I (Phases A and B) TripodSelect 1, NozzIeSelect 1 (Phases A and B) TripodSelect 2, NozzIeSelect 1 (Phases A and B)<br>
TripodSelect 8, NozzIeSelect 9 (Phases A and B)     -<br>
TripodSelect 9, NozzIeSelect 9 (Phases A and B)<br>
Note that phases A and B can overlap. The duration of a pulse will also vary due to battery power and ink viscosity (which changes with temperature). Fig. 95 shows the AEnable and BEnable lines during a typical Print Cycle.<br>
Feedback From The Print head<br>
The print head produces several lines of feedback (accumulated from the 8 segments). The feedback<br>
lines can be used to adjust the timing of the firing pulses.Although each segment produces the same feedback,<br>
the feedback from all segments share the same tri-state bus lines. Consequently only one segment at a time can<br>
provide feedback. A pulse on the SenseEnable line ANDed with data on CYAN enables the sense lines for<br>
that segment. The feedback sense lines are as follows:<br>
•	Tsense   informs the controller how hot the print head is. This allows the controller to adjust timing of firing pulses, since temperature affects the viscosity of the ink.<br>
•	Vsense   informs the controller how much voltage is available to the actuator. This allows the controller to compensate for a flat battery or high voltage source by adjusting the pulse width.<br>
•	Rsense   informs the controller of the resistivity (Ohms per square) of the actuator heater. This allows<br><br>
the controller to adjust the pulse widths to maintain a constant energy irrespective of the heater resistivity.<br>
• Wsense informs the controller of the width of the critical part of the heater, which may vary up to ± 5% due to lithographic and etching variations. This allows the controller to adjust the pulse width appropriately.<br>
Preheat Mode<br>
The printing process has a strong tendency to stay at the equilibrium temperature. To ensure that the<br>
first section of the printed photograph has a consistent dot size, ideally the equilibrium temperature should be<br>
met before printing any dots. This is accomplished via a preheat mode.<br>
The Preheat mode involves a single Load Cycle to all nozzles with Is (i.e. setting all nozzles to fire), and a number of short firing pulses to each nozzle. The duration of the pulse must be insufficient to fire the drops, but enough to heat up the ink surrounding the heaters. Altogether about 200 pulses for each nozzle are required, cycling through in the same sequence as a standard Print Cycle.<br>
Feedback during the Preheat mode is provided by Tsense, and continues until an equilibrium temperature is reached (about 30° C above ambient). The duration of the Preheat mode can be around 50 milliseconds, and can be tuned in accordance with the ink composition.<br>
Print Head Interface Summary<br>
The print head has the following connections:<br><br><br>
Internal to the print head, each segment has the following connections to the bond pads:<br>
Pad Connections<br>
Although an entire print head has a total of 504 connections, the mask layout contains only 63. This is<br>
because the chip is composed of eight identical and separate sections, each 12.7 micron long. Each of these<br>
sections has 63 pads at a pitch of 200 microns. There is an extra 50 microns at each end of the group of 63<br>
pads, resulting in an exact repeat distance of 12,700 microns (12.7 micron, 1/2")<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
bend compensation layer, ambient temperature has negligible direct effect on the bend actuator. The resistivity of the TiN heater changes only slightly with temperature. The following simulations are for an water based ink, in the temperature range 0 °C to 80°C.<br>
The drop velocity and drop volume does not increase monotonically with increasing temperature as one may expect. This is simply explained: as the temperature increases, the viscosity falls faster than the surface tension falls. As the viscosity falls, the movement of ink out of the nozzle is made slightly easier. However, the. movement of the ink around the paddle - from the high pressure zone at the paddle front to the low pressure zone behind the paddle - changes even more. Thus more of the ink movement is 'short circuited' at higher temperatures and lower viscosities.<br><br>
The temperature of the IJ46 print head is regulated to optimize the consistency of drop volume and drop velocity. The temperature is sensed on chip for each segment. The temperature sense signal (Tsense) is connected to a common Tsense output. The appropriate Tsense signal is selected by asserting the Sense Enable (Sen) and selecting the appropriate segment using the D[C0.7] lines. The Tsense signal is digitized by the drive ASIC, and drive pulse width is altered to compensate for the ink viscosity change. Data specifying the viscosity/temperature relationship of the ink is stored in the Authentication chip associated with the ink.<br>
Variation with Nozzle Radius<br>
The nozzle radius has a significant effect on the drop volume and drop velocity. For this reason it is<br>
closely controlled by 0.5 micron lithography. The nozzle is formed by a 2 micron etch of the sacrificial<br>
material, followed by deposition of the nozzle wall material and a CMP step. The CMP planarizes the nozzle<br>
structures, removing the top of the overcoat, and exposed the sacrificial material inside. The sacrificial<br>
material is subsequently removed, leaving a self-aligned nozzle and nozzle rim. The accuracy internal radius<br>
of the nozzle is primarily determined by the accuracy of the lithography, and the consistency of the sidevvall<br><br>
angle of the 2 micron etch.<br>
The following table shows operation at various nozzle radii. With increasing nozzle radius, the drop velocity steadily decreases. However, the drop volume peaks at around a 5.5 micron radius. The nominal nozzle radius is 5.5 microns, and the operating tolerance specification allows a ± 4% variation on this radius, giving a range of 5.3 to 5.7 microns. The simulations also include extremes outside of the nominal operating range (5.0 and 6.0 micron). The major nozzle radius variations will likely be determined by a combination of the sacrificial nozzle etch and the CMP step. This means that variations are likely to be non-local: differences between wafers, and differences between the center and the perimeter of a wafer. The between wafer differences are compensated by the 'brightness' adjustment. Within wafer variations will be imperceptible as long as they are not sudden.<br><br>
Ink Supply System<br>
A print head constructed in accordance with the aforementioned techniques can be utilized in a print<br>
camera system similar to that disclosed in PCT patent application No. PCT/AU98/00544. A print head and<br>
ink supply arrangement suitable for utilization in a print on demand camera system will now be described.<br>
Starting initially with Fig. 96 and Fig. 97, there is illustrated portions of an ink supply arrangement in the form<br>
of an ink supply unit 430. The supply unit can be configured to include three ink storage chambers 521 to<br>
supply three color inks to the back surface of a print head, which in the preferred form is a print head chip<br>
431. The ink is supplied to the print head by means of an ink distribution molding or manifold 433 which<br>
includes a series of slots 434 for the flow of ink via closely toleranced ink outlets 432 to the back of the print<br>
head 431. The outlets 432 are very small having a width of about 100 microns and accordingly need to be<br>
made to a much higher degree of accuracy than the adjacent interacting components of the ink supply unit such<br><br>
as the housing 495 described hereafter.<br>
The print head 431 is of an elongate structure and can be attached to the print head aperture 435 in the ink distribution manifold by means of silicone gel or a like resilient adhesive 520.<br>
Preferably, the print head is attached along its back surface 438 and sides 439 by applying adhesive to the internal sides of the print head aperture 435. In this manner the adhesive is applied only to the interconnecting faces of the aperture and print head, and the risk of blocking the accurate ink supply passages 380 formed in the back of the print head chip 431 (see Fig. 88) is minimised. A filter 436 is also provided that is designed to fit around the distribution molding 433 so as to filter the ink passing through the molding 433.<br>
Ink distribution molding 433 and filter 436 are in turn inserted within a baffle unit 437 which is again attached by means of a silicone sealant applied at interface 438, such that ink is able to, for example, flow through the holes 440 and in turn through the holes 434. The baffle unit 437 can be a plastic injection molded unit which includes a number of spaced apart baffles or slats 441-443. The baffles are formed within each ink channel so as to reduce acceleration of the ink in the storage chambers 521 as may be induced by movement of the portable printer, which in this preferred form would be most disruptive along the longitudinal extent of the print head, whilst simultaneously allowing for flows of ink to the print head in response to active demand therefrom. The baffles are effective in providing for portable carriage of the ink so as to minimize disruption to flow fluctuations during handling.<br>
The baffle unit 437 is in turn encased in a housing 445. The housing 445 can be ultrasonically welded to the baffle unit 437 so as to seal the baffle unit 437 into three separate ink chambers 521. The baffle unit 437 further includes a series of pierceable end wall portions 450 - 452 which can be pierced by a corresponding mating ink supply conduit for the flow of ink into each of the three chambers. The housing 445 also includes a series of holes 455 which are hydrophobically sealed by means of tape or the like so as to allow air within the three chambers of the baffle unit to escape whilst ink remains within the baffle chambers due to the hydrophobic nature of the holes 455.<br>
By manufacturing the ink distribution unit in separate interacting components as just described, it is possible to use relatively conventional molding techniques, despite the high degree of accuracy required at the interface with the print head. That is because the dimensional accuracy requirements are broken down in stages by using successively smaller components with only the smallest final member being the ink distribution manifold or second member needing to be produced to the narrower tolerances needed for accurate interaction with the ink supply passages 380 formed in the chip.<br>
The housing 445 includes a series of positioning protuberances 460 - 462. A first series of protuberances is designed to accurately position interconnect means in the form of a tape automated bonded film 470, in addition to first 465 and second 466 power and ground busbars which are interconnected to the TAB film 470 at a large number of locations along the surface of the TAB film so as to provide for low resistance power and ground distribution along the surface of the TAB film 470 which is in turn connected to the print head chip 431.<br>
The TAB film 470, which is shown in more detail in an opened state in Figs. 102 and 103, is double sided having on its outer side a data/signal bus in the form of a plurality of longitudinally extending control line interconnects 550 which releasably connect with a corresponding plurality of external control lines. Also<br><br>
provided on the outer side are busbar contacts in the form of deposited noble metal strips 552.<br>
The inner side of the TAB film 470 has a plurality of transversely extending connecting lines 553 that alternately connect the power supply via the busbars and the control lines 550 to bond pads on the print head via region 554. The connection with the control lines occurs by means of vias 556 that extend through the TAB film. One of the many advantages of using the TAB film is providing a flexible means of connecting the rigid busbar rails to the fragile print head chip 431.<br>
The busbars 465, 466 are in turn connected to contacts 475, 476 which are firmly clamped against the busbars 465, 466 by means of cover unit 478. The cover unit 478 also can comprise an injection molded part and includes a slot 480 for the insertion of an aluminum bar for assisting in cutting a printed page.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 98 there is illustrated a cut away view of the print head unit 430, associated platen unit 490, print roll and ink supply unit 491 and drive power distribution unit 492 which interconnects each of the units 430, 490 and 491.<br>
The guillotine blade 495 is able to be driven by a first motor along the aluminum blade 498 so as to cut a picture 499 after printing has occurred. The operation of the system of Fig. 98 is very similar to that disclosed in PCT patent application PCT/AU98/00544. Ink is stored in the core portion 500 of a print roll former 501 around which is rolled print media 502. The print media is fed under the control of electric motor 494 between the platen 290 and print head unit 490 with the ink being interconnected via ink transmission channels 505 to the print head unit 430. The print roll unit 491 can be as described in the aforementioned PCT specification. In Fig. 99, there is illustrated the assembled form of single printer unit 510.<br>
Features and Advantages<br>
The IJ46 print head has many features and advantages over other printing technologies. In some cases,<br>
these advantages stem from new capabilities. In other cases, the advantages stem from the avoidance of<br>
problems inherent in prior art technologies. A discussion of some of these advantages follows.<br>
High Resolution<br>
The resolution of a IJ46 print head is 1,600 dots per inch (dpi) in both the scan direction and transverse<br>
to the scan direction. This allows full photographic quality color images, and high quality text (including<br>
Kanji). Higher resolutions are possible: 2,400 dpi and 4,800 dpi versions have been investigated for special<br>
applications, but 1,600 dpi is chosen as ideal for most applications. The true resolution of advanced<br>
commercial piezoelectric devices is around 120 dpi and thermal ink jet devices around 600 dpi.<br>
Excellent Image Quality<br>
High image quality requires high resolution and accurate placement of drops. The monolithic page<br>
width nature of IJ46 print heads allows drop placement to sub-micron precision. High accuracy is also<br>
achieved by eliminating misdirected drops, electrostatic deflection, air turbulence, and eddies, and maintaining<br>
highly consistent drop volume and velocity. Image quality is also ensured by the provision of sufficient<br>
resolution to avoid requiring multiple ink densities. Five color or 6 color 'photo' ink jet systems can introduce<br>
halftoning artifacts in mid tones (such as flesh-tones) if the dye interaction and drop sizes are not absolutely<br>
perfect. This problem is eliminated in binary three color systems such as used in IJ46 print heads.<br><br>
High Speed (30 ppm per print head)<br>
The page width nature of the print head allows high-speed operation, as no scanning is required. The<br>
time to print a full color A4 page is less than 2 seconds, allowing full 30 page per minute (ppm) operation per<br>
print head. Multiple print heads can be used in parallel to obtain 60 ppm, 90 ppm, 120 ppm, etc. IJ46 print<br>
heads are low cost and compact, so multiple head designs are practical.<br>
Low Cost<br>
As the nozzle packing density of the IJ46 print head is very high, the chip area per print head can be<br>
low. This leads to a low manufacturing cost as many print head chips can fit on the same wafer..<br>
All Digital Operation<br>
The high resolution of the print head is chosen to allow fully digital operation using digital halftoning.<br>
This eliminates color non-linearity (a problem with continuous tone printers), and simplifies the design of<br>
drive ASICs.<br>
Small Drop Volume<br>
To achieve true 1,600 dpi resolution, a small drop size is required. An IJ46 print head's drop size is<br>
one picoliter (1 pi). The drop size of advanced commercial piezoelectric and thermal ink jet devices is around<br>
3 pi to 30 pi.<br>
Accurate Control of Drop Velocity<br>
As the drop ejector is a precise mechanical mechanism, and does not rely on bubble nucleation,<br>
accurate drop velocity control is available. This allows low drop velocities (3 - 4 m/s) to be used in<br>
applications where media and airflow can be controlled. Drop velocity can be accurately varied over a<br>
considerable range by varying the energy provided to the actuator. High drop velocities (10 to 15 m/s) suitable<br>
for plain-paper operation and relatively uncontrolled conditions can be achieved using variations of the nozzle<br>
chamber and actuator dimensions.<br>
Fast Drying<br>
A combination of very high resolution, very small drops, and high dye density allows full color printing<br>
with much less water ejected. A 1600 dpi IJ46 print head ejects around 33% of the water of a 600 dpi thermal<br>
ink jet printer. This allows fast drying and virtually eliminates paper cockle.<br>
Wide Temperature Range<br>
IJ46 print heads are designed to cancel the effect of ambient temperature. Only the change in ink<br>
characteristics with temperature affects operation and this can be electronically compensated. Operating<br>
temperature range is expected to be 0 °C to 50 °C for water based inks.<br>
No Special Manufacturing Equipment Required<br>
The manufacturing process for 1J46 print heads leverages entirely from the established semiconductor<br>
manufacturing industry. Most ink jet systems encounter major difficulty and expense in moving from the<br>
laboratory to production, as high accuracy specialized manufacturing equipment is required.<br><br>
High Production Capacity Available<br>
A 6" CMOS fab with 10,000 wafer starts per month can produce around 18 million print heads per<br>
annum. An 8" CMOS fab with 20,000 wafer starts per month can produce around 60 million print heads per<br>
annum. There are currently many such CMOS fabs in the world.<br>
Low Factory Setup Cost<br>
The factory set-up cost is low because existing 0.5 micron 6" CMOS fabs can be used. These fabs<br>
could be fully amortized, and are essentially obsolete for CMOS logic production. Therefore, volume<br>
production can use 'old' existing facilities. Most of the MEMS post-processing can also be performed in the<br>
CMOS fab.<br>
Good Light- Fastness<br>
As the ink is not heated, there are few restrictions on the types of dyes that can be used. This allows<br>
dyes to be chosen for optimum light-fastness. Some recently developed dyes from companies such as Avecia<br>
and Hoechst have light-fastness of 4. This is equal to the light-fastness of many pigments, and considerably in<br>
excess of photographic dyes and of ink jet dyes in use until recently.<br>
Good Water- Fastness<br>
As with light-fastness, the lack of thermal restrictions on the dye allows selection of dyes for<br>
characteristics such as water-fastness. For extremely high water-fastness (as is required for washable textiles) reactive dyes can be used.<br>
Excellent Color Gamut<br>
The use of transparent dyes of high color purity allows a color gamut considerably wider than that of<br>
offset printing and silver halide photography. Offset printing in particular has a restricted gamut due to light<br>
scattering from the pigments used. With three-color systems (CMY) or four-color systems (CMYK) the gamut<br>
is necessarily limited to the tetrahedral volume between the color vertices. Therefore it is important that the<br>
cyan, magenta and yellow dies are as spectrally pure as possible. A slightly wider 'hexcone' gamut that<br>
includes pure reds, greens, and blues can be achieved using a 6 color (CMYRGB) model. Such a six-color<br>
print head can be made economically as it requires a chip width of only 1 mm.<br>
Elimination of Color Bleed<br>
Ink bleed between colors occurs if the different primary colors are printed while the previous color is<br>
wet. While image blurring due to ink bleed is typically insignificant at 1600 dpi, ink bleed can 'muddy' the midtones of an image. Ink bleed can be eliminated by using microemulsion-based ink. for which IJ46 print heads are highly suited. The use of microemulsion ink can also help prevent nozzle clogging and ensure long-term ink stability.<br>
High Nozzle Count<br>
An IJ46 print head has 19,200 nozzles in a monolithic CMY three-color photographic print head.<br>
While this is large compared to other print heads, it is a small number compared to the number of devices<br>
routinely integrated on CMOS VLSI chips in high volume production. It is also less than 3% of the number of<br><br>
movable mirrors which Texas Instruments integrates in its Digital Micromirror Device (DMD), manufactured using similar CMOS and MEMS processes.<br>
51,200 Nozzles per A4 Page width Print head<br>
A four color (CMYK) IJ46 print head for page width A4/US letter printing uses two chips. Each 0.66<br>
cm2 chip has 25,600 nozzles for a total of 51,200 nozzles.<br>
Integration of Drive Circuits<br>
In a print head with as many as 51,200 nozzles, it is essential to integrate data distribution circuits (shift<br>
registers), data timing, and drive transistors with the nozzles. Otherwise, a minimum of 51,201 external<br>
connections would be required. This is a severe problem with piezoelectric ink jets, as drive circuits cannot be<br>
integrated on piezoelectric substrates. Integration of many millions of connections is common in CMOS VLSI<br>
chips, which are fabricated in high volume at high yield. It is the number of of)-chip connections that must be<br>
limited.<br>
Monolithic Fabrication<br>
IJ46 print heads are made as a single monolithic CMOS chip, so no precision assembly is required. All<br>
fabrication is performed using standard CMOS VLSI and MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems)<br>
processes and materials. In thermal ink jet and some piezoelectric ink jet systems, the assembly of nozzle<br>
plates with the print head chip is a major cause of low yields, limited resolution, and limited size. Also, page<br>
width arrays are typically constructed from multiple smaller chips. The assembly and alignment of these chips<br>
is an expensive process.<br>
Modular, Extendable for Wide Print Widths<br>
Long page width print heads can be constructed by butting two or more 100 mm 1J46 print heads<br>
together. The edge of the IJ46 print head chip is designed to automatically align to adjacent chips. One print<br>
head gives a photographic size printer, two gives an A4 printer, and four gives an A3 printer. Larger numbers<br>
can be used for high speed digital printing, page width wide format printing, and textile printing.<br>
Duplex Operation<br>
Duplex printing at the full print speed is highly practical. The simplest method is to provide two print<br>
heads - one on each side of the paper. The cost and complexity of providing two print heads is less than that<br>
of mechanical systems to turn over the sheet of paper.<br>
Straight Paper Path<br>
As there are no drums required, a straight paper path can be used to reduce the possibility of paper<br>
jams. This is especially relevant for office duplex printers, where the complex mechanisms required to turn<br>
over the pages are a major source of paper jams<br><br>
High Efficiency<br>
Thermal ink jet print heads are only around 0.01% efficient (electrical energy input compared to drop<br>
kinetic energy and increased surface energy). IJ46 print heads are more than 20 times as efficient.<br>
Self-Cooling Operation<br>
The energy required to eject each drop is 160 nJ (0.16 microJoules), a small fraction of that required<br>
for thermal ink jet printers. The low energy allows the print head to be completely cooled by the ejected ink,<br>
with only a 40 °C worst-case ink temperature rise. No heat sinking is required.<br>
Low Pressure<br>
The maximum pressure generated in an IJ46 print head is around 60 kPa (0.6 atmospheres). The<br>
pressures generated by bubble nucleation and collapse in thermal ink jet and Bubblejet systems are typically in<br>
excess of 10 MPa (100 atmospheres), which is 160 times the maximum IJ46 print head pressure. The high<br>
pressures in Bubblejet and thermal ink jet designs result in high mechanical stresses.<br>
Low Power<br>
A 30 ppm A4 IJ46 print head requires about 67 Watts when printing full 3 color black. When printing<br>
5% coverage, average power consumption is only 3.4 Watts.<br>
Low Voltage Operation<br>
IJ46 print heads can operate from a single 3V supply, the same as typical drive ASICs. Thermal ink<br>
jets typically require at least 20 V, and piezoelectric ink jets often require more than 50 V. The IJ46 print<br>
head actuator is designed for nominal operation at 2.8 volts, allowing a 0.2 volt drop across the drive<br>
transistor, to achieve 3V chip operation.<br>
Operation from 2 or 4 AA Batteries<br>
Power consumption is low enough that a photographic IJ46 print head can operate from AA batteries.<br>
A typical 6" x 4" photograph requires less than 20 Joules to print (including drive transistor losses). Four AA<br>
batteries are recommended if the photo is to be printed in 2 seconds. If the print time is increased to 4 seconds,<br>
2 AA batteries can be used.<br>
Battery Voltage Compensation<br>
IJ46 print heads can operate from an unregulated battery supply, to eliminate efficiency losses of a<br>
voltage regulator. This means that consistent performance must be achieved over a considerable range of<br>
supply voltages. The IJ46 print head senses the supply voltage, and adjusts actuator operation to achieve<br>
consistent drop volume.<br>
Small Actuator and Nozzle Area<br>
The area required by an IJ46 print head nozzle, actuator, and drive circuit is 1764 u.m2. This is less<br>
than 1% of the area required by piezoelectric ink jet nozzles, and around 5% of the area required by Bubblejet<br>
nozzles. The actuator area directly affects the print head manufacturing cost.<br><br>
Small Total Print head Size<br>
An entire print head assembly (including ink supply channels) for an A4, 30 ppm, 1,600 dpi, four color<br>
print head is 210 mm x 12 mm x 7 mm. The small size allows incorporation into notebook computers and<br>
miniature printers. A photograph printer is 106 mm x 7 mm x 7 mm, allowing inclusion in pocket digital<br>
cameras, palmtop PC's, mobile phone/fax, and so on. Ink supply channels take most of this volume. The print<br>
head chip itself is only 102 mm x 0.55 mm x 0.3 mm.<br>
Miniature Nozzle Capping System<br>
A miniature nozzle capping system has been designed for IJ46 print heads. For a photograph printer<br>
this nozzle capping system is only 106 mm x 5 mm x 4 mm, and does not require the print head to move.<br>
High Manufacturing Yield<br>
The projected manufacturing yield (at maturity) of the IJ46 print heads is at least 80%, as it is primarily<br>
a digital CMOS chip with an area of only 0.55 cm2. Most modern CMOS processes achieve high yield with<br>
chip areas in excess of 1 cm2. For chips less than around 1 cm', cost is roughly proportional to chip area. Cost<br>
increases rapidly between 1 cm and 4 cm, with chips larger than this rarely being practical. There is a strong<br>
incentive to ensure that the chip area is less than 1 cm2. For thermal ink jet and Bubblejet print heads, the chip<br>
width is typically around 5 mm, limiting the cost effective" chip length to around 2 cm. A major target of IJ46<br>
print head develoment has been to reduce the chip width as much as possible, allowing cost effective<br>
monolithic page width print heads.<br>
Low Process Complexity<br>
With digital IC manufacture, the mask complexity of the device has little or no effect on the<br>
manufacturing cost or difficulty. Cost is proportional to the number of process steps, and the lithographic<br>
critical dimensions. IJ46 print heads use a standard 0.5 micron single poly triple metal CMOS manufacturing<br>
process, with an additional 5 MEMS mask steps. This makes the manufacturing process less complex than a<br>
typical 0.25 micron CMOS logic process with 5 level metal.<br>
Simple Testing<br>
IJ46 print heads include test circuitry that allows most testing to be completed at the wafer probe stage.<br>
Testing of all electrical properties, including the resistance of the actuator, can be completed at this stage.<br>
However, actuator motion can only be tested after release from the sacrificial materials, so final testing must<br>
be performed on the packaged chips.<br>
Low Cost Packaging<br>
IJ46 print heads are packaged in an injection molded polycarbonate package. All connections are made<br>
using Tape Automated Bonding (TAB) technology (though wire bonding can be used as an option). All<br>
connections are along one edge of the chip.<br>
No Alpha particle sensitivity<br>
Alpha particle emission does not need to be considered in the packaging, as there are no memory elements<br>
except static registers, and a change of state due to alpha particle tracks is likely to cause only a single extra<br><br>
dot to be printed (or not) on the paper.<br>
Relaxed Critical Dimensions<br>
The critical dimension (CD) of the IJ46 print head CMOS drive circuitry is 0.5 microns. Advanced<br>
digital IC's such as microprocessors currently use CDs of 0.25 microns, which is two device generations more<br>
advanced than the IJ46 print head requires. Most of the MEMS post processing steps have CDs of 1 micron or<br>
greater.<br>
Low Stress during Manufacture<br>
Devices cracking during manufacture are a critical problem with both thermal Inkjet and piezoelectric<br>
devices. This limits the size of the print head that it is possible to manufacture. The stresses involved in the<br>
manufacture of IJ46 print heads are no greater than those required for CMOS fabrication.<br>
No Scan Banding<br>
IJ46 print heads are full page width, so do not scan. This eliminates one of the most significant image<br>
quality problems of ink jet printers. Banding due to other causes (mis-directed drops, print head alignment) is<br>
usually a significant problem in page width print heads. These causes of banding have also been addressed.<br>
'Perfect' Nozzle Alignment<br>
All of the nozzles within a print head are aligned to sub-micron accuracy by the 0.5 micron stepper<br>
used for the lithography of the print head. Nozzle alignment of two 4" print heads to make an A4 page width<br>
print head is achieved with the aid of mechanical alignment features on the print head chips. This allows<br>
automated mechanical alignment (by simply pushing two print head chips together) to within 1 micron. If finer<br>
alignment is required in specialized applications, 4" print heads can be aligned optically.<br>
No Satellite Drops<br>
The very small drop size (1 pi) and moderate drop velocity (3 m/s) eliminates satellite drops, which are<br>
a major source of image quality problems. At around 4m/s, satellite drops form, but catch up with the main<br>
drop. Above around 4.5 m/s, satellite drops form with a variety of velocities relative to the main drop. Of<br>
particular concern is satellite drops which have a negative velocity relative to the print head, and therefore are<br>
often deposited on the print head surface. These are difficult to avoid when high drop velocities (around 10<br>
m/s) are used.<br>
Laminar Air Flow<br>
The low drop velocity requires laminar airflow, with no eddies, to achieve good drop placement on the print<br>
medium. This is achieved by the design of the print head packaging. For 'plain paper applications and for<br>
printing on other 'rough' surfaces, higher drop velocities are desirable. Drop velocities to 15 m/s can be<br>
achieved using variations of the design dimensions. It is possible to manufacture 3 color photographic print<br>
heads with a 4 m/s drop velocity, and 4 color plain-paper print heads with a 15 m/s drop velocity, on the same<br>
wafer. This is because both can be made using the same process parameters.<br><br>
No Misdirected Drops<br>
Misdirected drops are eliminated by the provision of a thin rim around the nozzle, which prevents the<br>
spread of a drop across the print head surface in regions where the hydrophobic coating is compromised.<br>
No Thermal Crosstalk<br>
When adjacent actuators are energized in Bubblejet or other thermal Inkjet systems, the heat from one<br>
actuator spreads to others, and affects their firing characteristics. In IJ46 print heads, heat diffusing from one<br>
actuator to adjacent actuators affects both the heater layer and the bend-cancelling layer equally, so has no<br>
effect on the paddle position. This virtually eliminates thermal crosstalk.<br>
No Fluidic Crosstalk<br>
Each simultaneously fired nozzle is at the end of a 300 micron long ink inlet etched through the<br>
(thinned) wafer. These ink inlets are connected to large ink channels with low fluidic resistance. This<br>
configuration virtually eliminates any effect of drop ejection from one nozzle on other nozzles.<br>
No Structural Crosstalk<br>
This is a common problem with piezoelectric print heads. It does not occur in IJ46 print heads.<br>
Permanent Print head<br>
The IJ46 print heads can be permanently installed. This dramatically lowers the production cost of<br>
consumables, as the consumable does not need to include a print head.<br>
No Kogation<br>
Kogation (residues of burnt ink, solvent, and impurities) is a significant problem with Bubblejet and<br>
other thermal ink jet print heads. IJ46 print heads do not have this problem, as the ink is not directly heated.<br>
No Cavitation<br>
Erosion caused by the violent collapse of bubbles is another problem that limits the life of Bubblejet<br>
and other thermal ink jet print heads. IJ46 print heads do not have this problem because no bubbles are<br>
formed.<br>
No Electromigration<br>
No metals are used in IJ46 print head actuators or nozzles, which are entirely ceramic. Therefore, there<br>
is no problem with electromigration in the actual ink jet devices. The CMOS metalization layers are designed<br>
to support the required currents without electromigration. This can be readily achieved because the current<br>
considerations arise from heater drive power, not high speed CMOS switching.<br>
Reliable Power Connections<br>
While the energy consumption of IJ46 print heads are fifty times less than thermal ink jet print heads,<br>
the high print speed and low voltage results in a fairly high electrical current consumption. Worst case current<br>
for a photographic IJ46 print head printing in two seconds from a 3 Volt supply is 4.9 Amps. This is supplied<br>
via copper busbars to 256 bond pads along the edge of the chip. Each bond pad carries a maximum of 40 mA.<br>
On chip contacts and vias to the drive transistors carry a peak current of 1.5 mA for 1.3 microseconds, and a<br><br>
maximum average of 12 mA.<br>
No Corrosion<br>
The nozzle and actuator are entirely formed of glass and titanium nitride (TiN), a conductive ceramic commonly used as metalization barrier layers in CMOS devices. Both materials are highly resistant to corrosion.<br>
No Electrolysis<br>
The ink is not in contact with any electrical potentials, so there is no electrolysis.<br>
No Fatigue<br>
All actuator movement is within elastic limits, and the materials used are all ceramics, so there is no<br>
fatigue.<br>
No Friction<br>
No moving surfaces are in contact, so there is no friction.<br>
No Stiction<br>
The IJ46 print head is designed to eliminate stiction, a problem common to many MEMS devices.<br>
Stiction is a word combining "stick" with "friction" and is especially significant in MEMS due to the relative<br>
scaling of forces. In the IJ46 print head, the paddle is suspended over a hole in the substrate, eliminating the<br>
paddle-to-substrate stiction which would otherwise be encountered.<br>
No Crack Propagation<br>
The stresses applied to the materials are less than 1% of that which leads to crack propagation with the<br>
typical surface roughness of the TiN and glass layers. Corners are rounded to minimize stress 'hotspots'. The glass is also always under compressive stress, which is much more resistant to crack propagation than tensile stress.<br>
No Electrical Poling Required<br>
Piezoelectric materials must be poled after they are formed into the print head structure. This poling<br>
requires very high electrical field strengths - around 20,000 V/cm. The high voltage requirement typically<br>
limits the size of piezoelectric print heads to around 5 cm, requiring 100,000 Volts to pole. IJ46 print heads<br>
require no poling.<br>
No Rectified Diffusion<br>
Rectified diffusion - the formation of bubbles due to cyclic pressure variations - is a problem that<br>
primarily afflicts piezoelectric ink jets. IJ46 print heads are designed to prevent rectified diffusion, as the ink<br>
pressure never falls below zero.<br>
Elimination of the Saw Street<br>
The saw street between chips on a wafer is typically 200 microns. This would take 26% of the wafer<br>
area. Instead, plasma etching is used, requiring just 4% of the wafer area. This also eliminates breakage during<br><br>
sawing.<br>
Lithography Using Standard Steppers<br>
Although IJ46 print heads are 100 mm long, standard steppers (which typically have an imaging field<br>
around 20 mm square) are used. This is because the print head is 'stitched' using eight identical exposures.<br>
Alignment between stitches is not critical, as there are no electrical connections between stitch regions. One<br>
segment of each of 32 print heads is imaged with each stepper exposure, giving an 'average' of 4 print heads<br>
per exposure.<br>
Integration of Full Color on a Single Chip<br>
IJ46 print heads integrate all of the colors required onto a single chip. This cannot be done with page<br>
width 'edge shooter' ink jet technologies-Wide Variety of Inks<br>
IJ46 print heads do not rely on the ink properties for drop ejection. Inks can be based on water,<br>
microemulsions, oils, various alcohols, MEK, hot melt waxes, or other solvents. IJ46 print heads can be 'tuned' for inks over a wide range of viscosity and surface tension. This is a significant factor in allowing a wide range of applications.<br>
Laminar Air Flow with no Eddies<br>
The print head packaging is designed to ensure that airflow is laminar, and to eliminate eddies. This is<br>
important, as eddies or turbulence could degrade image quality due to the small drop size.<br>
Drop Repetition Rate<br>
The nominal drop repetition rate of a photographic IJ46 print head is 5 kHz, resulting in a print speed<br>
of 2 seconds per photo. The nominal drop repetition rate for an A4 print head is 10 kHz for 30+ ppm A4<br>
printing. The maximum drop repetition rate is primarily limited by the nozzle refill rate, which is determined<br>
by surface tension when operated using non-pressurized ink. Drop repetition rates of 50 kHz are possible<br>
.   using positive ink pressure (around 20 kPa). However, 34 ppm is entirely adequate for most low cost<br>
consumer applications. For very high-speed applications, such as commercial printing, multiple print heads<br>
can be used in conjunction with fast paper handling. For low power operation (such as operation from 2 AA<br>
batteries) the drop repetition rate can be reduced to reduce power.<br>
Low Head-to-Paper Speed<br>
The nominal head to paper speed of a photographic IJ46 print head is only 0.076 m/sec. For an A4<br>
prim head it is only 0.16 m/sec, which is about a third of the typical scanning ink jet head speed. The low<br>
speed simplifies printer design and improves drop placement accuracy. However, this head-to-paper speed is<br>
enough for 34 ppm printing, due to the page width print head. Higher speeds can readily be obtained where<br>
required.<br>
High Speed CMOS not Required<br>
The clock speed of the print head shift registers is only 14 MHz for an A4/letter print head operating at<br><br>
30 ppm. For a photograph printer, the clock speed is only 3.84 MHz. This is much lower than the speed capability of the CMOS process used. This simplifies the CMOS design, and eliminates power dissipation problems when printing near-white images.<br>
Fully Static CMOS Design<br>
The shift registers and transfer registers are fully static designs. A static design requires 35 transistors<br>
per nozzle, compared to around 13 for a dynamic design. However, the static design has several advantages,<br>
including higher noise immunity, lower quiescent power consumption, and greater processing tolerances.<br>
Wide Power Transistor<br>
The width to length ratio of the power transistor is 688. This allows a 4 Ohm on-resistance, whereby<br>
the drive transistor consumes 6.7% of the actuator power when operating from 3 V. This size transistor fits beneath the actuator, along with the shift register and other logic. Thus an adequate drive transistor, along with the associated data distribution circuits, consumes no chip area that is not already required by the actuator. There are several ways to reduce the percentage of power consumed by the transistor: increase the drive voltage so that the required current is less, reduce the lithography to less than 0.5 micron, use BiCMOS or other high current drive technology, or increase the chip area, allowing room for drive transistors which are not underneath the actuator. However, the 6.7% consumption of the present design is considered a cost-performance optimum.<br>

Prior Art ink jet technologies<br>
Similar capability print heads are unlikely to become available from the established ink jet<br>
manufacturers in the near future. This is because the two main contenders - thermal ink jet and piezoelectric<br>
ink jet- each have severe fundamental problems meeting the requirements of the application.<br>
The most significant problem with thermal ink jet is power consumption. This is approximately 100<br>
times that required for these applications, and stems from the energy-inefficient means of drop ejection. This<br>
involves the rapid boiling of water to produce a vapor bubble which expels the ink. Water has a very high heat<br><br>
capacity, and must be superheated in thermal Inkjet applications. The high power consumption limits the nozzle packing density as<br>
The most significant problem with piezoelectric ink jet is size and cost. Piezoelectric crystals have a /VQvy small deflection at reasonable drive voltages, and therefore require a large area for each nozzle. Also, each piezoelectric actuator must be connected to its drive circuit on a separate substrate. This is not a significant problem at the current limit of around 300 nozzles per print head, but is a major impediment to the fabrication of page width print heads with 19,200 nozzles.<br>
Comparison of IJ46 print heads and Thermal Ink Jet (TIJ) printing mechanisms<br><br>
It would be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that numerous variations and/or modifications may be made to the present invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present embodiments are, therefore, to be considered in all respects to be illustrative and not restrictive.<br><br>
The invention also relates to an ink jet printhead having a nozzle array wherein each nozzle has a moving nozzle with an externally arranged actuator.<br>
Our co-pending US patent application serial no. 09/112,821 discloses a moving nozzle generally.<br>
Such a moving nozzle device is actuated by means of a magnetically responsive element for effecting<br>
displacement of the moving nozzle and, in so doing, to effect ink ejection.<br>
A problem with this arrangement is that it is required that parts of the device be hydrophobically treated to inhibit the ingress of ink into the region of the actuator.<br>
A moving nozzle-type device is proposed where the need for hydrophobic treatment is obviated.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 104 of the drawings, a nozzle assembly is designated generally by the reference numeral 510. An ink jet printhead has a plurality of nozzle assemblies 510 arranged in an array 514 (Figs. 108 and 109) on a silicon substrate 516. The array 514 will be described in greater detail below.<br>
The assembly 510 includes a silicon substrate or wafer 516 on which a dielectric layer 518 is deposited. A CMOS passivation layer 520 is deposited on the dielectric layer 518.<br>
Each nozzle assembly 510 includes a nozzle 522 defining a nozzle opening 524, a connecting member in the form of a lever arm 526 and an actuator 528. The lever arm 526 connects the actuator 528 to the nozzle 522.<br>
As shown in greater detail in Figs. 105 to 107 of the drawings, the nozzle 522 comprises a crown portion 530 with a skirt portion 532 depending from the crown portion 530. The skirt portion 532 forms part of a peripheral wall of a nozzle chamber 534 (Figs. 105 to 107 of the drawings). The nozzle opening 524 is in fluid communication with the nozzle chamber 534. It is to be noted that the nozzle opening 524 is surrounded by a raised rim 536 which "pins" a meniscus 538 (Fig. 105) of a body of ink 540 in the nozzle chamber 534.<br>
An ink inlet aperture 542 (shown most clearly in Fig. 109 of the drawing) is defined in a floor 546 of the nozzle chamber 534. The aperture 542 is in fluid communication with an ink inlet channel 548 defined through the substrate 516.<br>
A wall portion 550 bounds the aperture 542 and extends upwardly from the floor portion 546. The skirt portion 532, as indicated above, of the nozzle 522 defines a first part of a peripheral wall of the nozzle chamber 534 and the wall portion 550 defines a second part of the peripheral wall of the nozzle chamber 534.<br>
The wall 550 has an inwardly directed lip 552 at its free end which serves as a fluidic seal which inhibits the escape of ink when the nozzle 522 is displaced, as will be described in greater detail below. It will be appreciated that, due to the viscosity of the ink 540 and the small dimensions of the spacing between the lip<br><br>
552 and the skirt portion 532, the inwardly directed lip 552 and surface tension function as a seal for inhibiting the escape of ink from the nozzle chamber 534.<br>
The actuator 528 is a thermal bend actuator and is connected to an anchor 554 extending upwardly from the substrate 516 or, more particularly, from the CMOS passivation layer 520. The anchor 554 is mounted on conductive pads 556 which form an electrical connection with the actuator 528.<br>
The actuator 528 comprises a first, active beam 558 arranged above a second, passive beam 560. In a preferred embodiment, both beams 558 and 560 are of, or include, a conductive ceramic material such as titanium nitride (TiN).<br>
Both beams 558 and 560 have their first ends anchored to the anchor 554 and their opposed ends connected to the arm 526. When a current is caused to flow through the active beam 558 thermal expansion of the beam 558 results. As the passive beam 560, through which there is no current flow, does not expand at the same rate, a bending moment is created causing the arm 526 and, hence, the nozzle 522 to be displaced downwardly towards the substrate 516 as shown in Fig. 106 of the drawings. This causes an ejection of ink through the nozzle opening 524 as shown at 562 in Fig. 106 of the drawings. When the source of heat is removed from the active beam 558, i.e. by stopping current flow, the nozzle 522 returns to its quiescent position as shown in Fig. 107 of the drawings. When the nozzle 522 returns to its quiescent position, an ink droplet 564 is formed as a result of the breaking of an ink droplet neck as illustrated at 566 in Fig. 107 of the drawings. The ink droplet 564 then travels on to the print media such as a sheet of paper. As a result of the formation of the ink droplet 564, a "negative" meniscus is formed as shown at 568 in Fig. 107 of the drawings. This "negative" meniscus 568 results in an inflow of ink 540 into the nozzle chamber 534 such that a new meniscus 538 (Fig. 105) is formed in readiness for the next ink drop ejection from the nozzle assembly 510.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 108 and 109 of the drawings, the nozzle array 514 is described in greater detail. The array 514 is for a four color printhead. Accordingly, the array 514 includes four groups 570 of nozzle assemblies, one for each color. Each group 570 has its nozzle assemblies 510 arranged in two rows 572 and 574. One of the groups 570 is shown in greater detail in Fig. 109 of the drawings.<br>
To facilitate close packing of the nozzle assemblies 510 in the rows 572 and 574, the nozzle assemblies 510 in the row 574 are offset or staggered with respect to the nozzle assemblies 510 in the row 572. Also, the nozzle assemblies 510 in the row 572 are spaced apart sufficiently far from each other to enable the lever arms 526 of the nozzle assemblies 510 in the row 574 to pass between adjacent nozzles 522 of<br><br>
the assemblies 510 in the row 572. It is to be noted that each nozzle assembly 510 is substantially dumbbell shaped so that the nozzles 522 in the row 572 nest between the nozzles 522 and the actuators 528 of adjacent nozzle assemblies 510 in the row 574.<br>
Further, to facilitate close packing of the nozzles 522 in the rows 572 and 574, each nozzle 522 is substantially hexagonally shaped.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that, when the nozzles 522 are displaced towards the substrate 516, in use, due to the nozzle opening 524 being at a slight angle with respect to the nozzle chamber 534 ink is ejected slightly off the perpendicular. It is an advantage of the arrangement shown in Figures 108 and 109 of the drawings that the actuators 528 of the nozzle assemblies 510 in the rows 572 and 574 extend in the same direction to one side of the rows 572 and 574. Hence, the ink droplets ejected from the nozzles 522 in the row 572 and the ink droplets ejected from the nozzles 522 in the row 574 are parallel to one another resulting in an improved print quality.<br>
Also, as shown in Figure 108 of the drawings, the substrate 516 has bond pads 576 arranged thereon which provide the electrical connections, via the pads 556, to the actuators 528 of the nozzle assemblies 510. These electrical connections are formed via the CMOS layer (not shown).<br>
Referring to Figure 100 of the drawings, a development of the invention is shown. With reference to the previous drawings, like reference numerals refer to like parts, unless otherwise specified.<br>
In this development, a nozzle guard 580 is mounted on the substrate 516 of the array 514. The nozzle guard 580 includes a body member 582 having a plurality of passages 584 defined therethrough. The passages 584 are in register with the nozzle openings 524 of the nozzle assemblies 510 of the array 514 such that, when ink is ejected from any one of the nozzle openings 524, the ink passes through the associated passage 584 before striking the print media.<br>
The body member 582 is mounted in spaced relationship relative to the nozzle assemblies 510 by limbs or struts 586. One of the struts 586 has air inlet openings 588 defined therein.<br>
In use, when the array 514 is in operation, air is charged through the inlet openings 588 to be forced through the passages 584 together with ink travelling through the passages 584.<br>
The ink is not entrained in the air as the air is charged through the passages 584 at a different velocity from that of the ink droplets 564. For example, the ink droplets 564 are ejected from the nozzles 522 at a<br><br>
velocity of approximately 3m/s. The air is charged through the passages 584 at a velocity of approximately<br>
lm/s.<br>
The purpose of the air is to maintain the passages 584 clear of foreign particles. A danger exists that these foreign particles, such as dust particles, could fall onto the nozzle assemblies 510 adversely affecting their operation. With the provision of the air inlet openings 588 in the nozzle guard 580 this problem is, to a large extent, obviated.<br>
Referring now to Figures 111 to 113 of the drawings, a process for manufacturing the nozzle assemblies 510 is described.<br>
Starting with the silicon substrate or wafer 516, the dielectric layer 518 is deposited on a surface of the wafer 516. The dielectric layer 518 is in the form of approximately 1.5 microns of CVD oxide. Resist is spun on to the layer 518 and the layer 518 is exposed to mask 600 and is subsequently developed.<br>
After being developed, the layer 518 is plasma etched down to the silicon layer 516. The resist is then stripped and the layer 518 is cleaned. This step defines the ink inlet aperture 542.<br>
In Figure 11 lb of the drawings, approximately 0.8 microns of aluminum 602 is deposited on the layer 518. Resist is spun on and the aluminum 602 is exposed to mask 604 and developed. The aluminum 602 is plasma etched down to the oxide layer 518, the resist is stripped and the device is cleaned. This step provides the bond pads and interconnects to the ink jet actuator 528. This interconnect is to an NMOS drive transistor' and a power plane with connections made in the CMOS layer (not shown).<br>
Approximately 0.5 microns of PECVD nitride is deposited as the CMOS passivation layer 520. Resist is spun on and the layer 520 is exposed to mask 606 whereafter it is developed. After development, the nitride is plasma etched down to the aluminum layer 602 and the silicon layer 516 in the region of the inlet aperture 542. The resist is stripped and the device cleaned.<br>
A layer 608 of a sacrificial material is spun on to the layer 520. The layer 608 is 6 microns of photosensitive polyimide or approximately 4 jam of high temperature resist. The layer 608 is softbaked and is then exposed to mask 610 whereafter it is developed. The layer 608 is then hardbaked at 400°C for one hour where the layer 608 is comprised of polyimide or at greater than 300°C where the layer 608 is high temperature resist. It is to be noted in the drawings that the pattern-dependent distortion of the polyimide layer 608 caused by shrinkage is taken into account in the design of the mask 610.<br><br>
In the next step, shown in Figure 1 lie of the drawings, a second sacrificial layer 612 is applied. The layer 612 is either 2 u.m of photo-sensitive polyimide which is spun on or approximately 1.3 \xm of high temperature resist. The layer 612 is softbaked and exposed to mask 614. After exposure to the mask 614, the flayer 612 is developed. In the case of the layer 612 being polyimide, the layer 612 is hardbaked at 400°C for approximately one hour. Where the layer 612 is resist, it is hardbaked at greater than 300°C for approximately one hour.<br>
A 0.2 micron multi-layer metal layer 616 is then deposited. Part of this layer 616 forms the passive beam 560 of the actuator 528.<br>
The layer 616 is formed by sputtering 1,000A of titanium nitride (TiN) at around 300°C followed by sputtering 50A of tantalum nitride (TaN). A further l,OO0A of TiN is sputtered on followed by 50A of TaN and a further K000A of TiN.<br>
Other materials which can be used instead of TiN are TiB2, MoSi? or (Ti, A1)N.<br>
The layer 616 is then exposed to mask 618, developed and plasma etched down to the layer 612 whereafter resist, applied for the layer 616, is wet stripped taking care not to remove the cured layers 608 or 612.<br>
A third sacrificial layer 620 is applied by spinning on 4 u.m of photo-sensitive polyimide or approximately 2.6 jam high temperature resist. The layer 620 is softbaked whereafter it is exposed to mask 622. The exposed layer is then developed followed by hardbaking. In the case of polyimide, the layer 620 is hardbaked at 400°C for approximately one hour or at greater than 300°C where the layer 620 comprises resist.<br>
A second multi-layer metal layer 624 is applied to the layer 620. The constituents of the layer 624 are the same as the layer 616 and are applied in the same manner. It will be appreciated that both layers 616 and 624 are electrically conductive layers.<br>
The layer 624 is exposed to mask 626 and is then developed. The layer 624 is plasma etched down to the polyimide or resist layer 620 whereafter resist applied for the layer 624 is wet stripped taking care not to remove the cured layers 608, 612 or 620. It will be noted that the remaining part of the layer 624 defines the active beam 558 of the actuator 528.<br>
A fourth sacrificial layer 628 is applied by spinning on 4 u.m of photo-sensitive polyimide or approximately 2.6u.m of high temperature resist. The layer 628 is softbaked, exposed to the mask 630 and is then developed to leave the island portions as shown in Figure 112k of the drawings. The remaining portions<br><br>
of the layer 628 are hardbaked at 400°C for approximately one hour in the case of polyimide or at greater than 300°C for resist.<br>
As shown in Figure 1111 of the drawing a high Young's modulus dielectric layer 632 is deposited. The layer 632 is constituted by approximately lum of silicon nitride or aluminum oxide. The layer 632 is deposited at a temperature below the hardbaked temperature of the sacrificial layers 608, 612, 620, 628. The primary characteristics required for this dielectric layer 632 are a high elastic modulus, chemical inertness and good adhesion to TiN.<br>
A fifth sacrificial layer 634 is applied by spinning on 2um of photo-sensitive polyimide or approximately 1.3 urn of high temperature resist. The layer 634 is softbaked, exposed to mask 636 and developed. The remaining portion of the layer 634 is then hardbaked at 400°C for one hour in the case of the polyimide or at greater than 300°C for the resist.<br>
The dielectric layer 632 is plasma etched down to the sacrificial layer 628 taking care not to remove any of the sacrificial layer 634.<br>
This step defines the nozzle opening 524, the lever arm 526 and the anchor 554 of the nozzle assembly 510.<br>
A high Young's modulus dielectric layer 638 is deposited. This layer 638 is formed by depositing 0.2u,m of silicon nitride or aluminum nitride at a temperature below the hardbaked temperature of the sacrificial layers 608, 612, 620 and 628.<br>
Then, as shown in Figure 11 lp of the drawings, the layer 638 is anisotropically plasma etched to a depth of 0.35 microns. This etch is intended to clear the dielectric from all of the surface except the side walls of the dielectric layer 632 and the sacrificial layer 634. This step creates the nozzle rim 536 around the nozzle opening 524 which "pins" the meniscus of ink, as described above.<br>
An ultraviolet (UV) release tape 640 is applied. 4um of resist is spun on to a rear of the silicon wafer 516. The wafer 516 is exposed to mask 642 to back etch the wafer 516 to define the ink inlet channel 548. The resist is then stripped from the wafer 516.<br>
A further UV release tape (not shown) is applied to a rear of the wafer 516 and the tape 640 is removed. The sacrificial layers 608, 612, 620, 628 and 634 are stripped in oxygen plasma to provide the final nozzle assembly 510 as shown in Figures 111 r and 112r of the drawings. For ease of reference, the reference numerals illustrated in these two drawings are the same as those in Figure 104 of the drawings to indicate the<br><br>
relevant parts of the nozzle assembly 510. Figures 114 and 115 show the operation of the nozzle assembly 510, manufactured in accordance with the process described above with reference to Figures 111 and 110, and these figures correspond to Figures 105 to 107 of the drawings.<br>
