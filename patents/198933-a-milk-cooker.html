This invention relates to a cooker commonly used as a milk cooker.<br>
Milk cookers comprising a double-jacketed vessel provided with a ferrule on die sidewall of the vessel and a whistle for fitting on the said ferrule are well known in the prior art (Indian PatNo.11435 ). The available milk cookers are all cup shaped for technical reasons as the hermetic sealing at the lip of the double walled vessel can be readily provided for cup shaped vessels. The preferred form of the whistle has an inverted cup shaped thin walled whistle body joined at its mouth to an internally mreaded thicker nut and to a whistle tongue within the said whistle body. This configuration of the whistle is the preferred form in the market because the whistling sound produced is quite loud for mis configuration and it is also the easiest from the manufacturing point of view. The thicker nut and the whistle tongue are joined to the whistle body by soldering. In the routine use of die milk cooker there are occasions when die milk cooker has to be used repeatedly. This is particularly true for small milk cookers, which are cheaper than die larger ones. There are also occasions when all die water within the space between die walls of die double-jacketed vessel has been boiled off and fresh water has to be poured in while die cooker is still hot The heat transmitted from the stove (and occasionally die flames of die stove) travels upwards by die side of die cup shaped vessel and heats up die whistle during operation. Hence die whistle is very hot during operation. This is a hindrance in unscrewing die whistle for filling die hot vessel wim water during or immediately after a milk cooking operation. The heat transmitted upwards from die stove also damages die whistle in course of time. This is particularly noted for die most efficient types of whistles having a soldered tongue and a soldered mreaded thick whistle moudi. In course of time die soldered parts of die whistle get detached. The user has either to purchase a new whistle (which is often not available) or invest in anomer milk cooker. The same argument holds good when cookers provided wim a whistle on their side wall are being used for cooking other food items. The object of mis invention is to propose a means whereby die heat transmitted upwards from die stove is prevented from directly heating up die whistle thereby allowing repeated removal and refitting of the whistle during and between cooking and ensuring its trouble free long term performance.<br>
Accordingly this invention provides a cooker (Q) comprising a vessel (V), a container (J) (for holding the water to energize a whistle) provided on to me said vessel, a ferrule (F) provided on die side wall of the cooker for introducing water into die said container (J) and a whistle (W) for fitting on die said ferrule, die body (B) of said whistle enclosing a blind or open cavity (C) communicating wtdi the moudi (M) of die whistle tiirough a narrow orifice (O) and wim die exterior through anodier opening (P) situated on die wall of die whistle body close to me said<br><br>
narrow orifice (O), characterized in that a heat shield for the whistle comprising a plate (S) made of a heat stable material such as metal is provided under the said whistle (W) (in its fitted position).<br>
The heat shield comprising the metal plate extends outwards beyond the central end of the whistle (in its fitted position) for a radial length of at least one fourth the length of the said whistle, said metal plate having a breadth of at least half the breadth of the said whistle. In the preferred embodiments the metal plate (S) extends over the entire under surface of the said whistle or also beyond its limits. Preferably the metal plate is positioned spaced from the said whistle to reduce heat transmission and to enable easy manual operation. The spacing is usually at least 1mm. The preferred embodiment of the whistle according to the invention has a whistle tongue housed within the whistle body, the narrow orifice being bounded between the tongue of the whistle and the said whistle body.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein: Fig. 1: is the side elevation of a cooker according to die invention;<br>
Fig.2: is the sectional elevation of me cooker shown in Fig.l, the section being taken in the plane Y-Y shown in Fig.1;<br>
Fig.3: is die pictorial view of the whistle used in die cooker according to the invention; Fig.4: is the bottom plan view of the whistle shown in Fig.3; Fig. 5: is the sectional elevation of the whistle shown in Figs.3 and 4.<br>
As shown in the figures, the cooker Q according to the invention comprises a cup shaped vessel V, an externally tfireaded ferrule F provided on die side wall of the cooker for introducing water into the water jacket J, and a whistle W for fitting on me said ferrule. The water container J is provided on to me said vessel V by folding the top ends of me two walls of me cooker. The whistle W has a whistle body B housing a blind or open cavity C communicating wim die internally threaded mouth M of the whistle through a narrow orifice O and with the exterior through another opening P situated on the wall of me whistle body close to die said narrow orifice O. The cooker is provided with a metal plate S under the said whistle W. This metal plate preferably extends outwards from me said cooker wall beyond the central end of die whistle (in its fitted position) for a radial length of at least one fourth the length and breadth at least half the breadth of the said whistle. The plate preferably covers die entire undersurface of the whistle and also extends beyond its limits as shown in the figures and is positioned sufficiently spaced from the whistle for easy manual operation. The nut U fixes the ferrule F to the outer wall of the cooker and the L shaped metal plate S is fitted to the outer wall of the cooker through two rivets R. The commonly used efficient whistle has an inverted cup shaped diin walled whistle body B joined at its mourn to an internally threaded thicker nut N and to a whistle tongue T witiiin me<br><br>
said whistle body, said internally threaded nut N being dimensioned to fit on the said externally threaded ferrule. This is the type of efficient whistle that is quickly damaged as the flames of the stove soon dislodge the soldered tongue T and the diick nut N from the cup shaped whistle body B. In another preferred and easily made embodiment said metal plate S when viewed from die side is L shaped, the vertical limb of the said L being provided with a hole, said ferrule F being introduced through the said hole and the metal plate S fixed to the said cooker Q by tightening a nut such as U over the threaded ferrule, the whistle W being provided over the part of the ferrule projecting outwards beyond the said fitted vertical limb of the said metal plate S. The metal plate S has a length of at least 1 cm and breadth of at least 0.5 cm in the preferred embodiments. The metal plate shields me whistle from the heat transmitted upwards diereby enabling repeated removal and refitting of the whistle during and between cooking and ensuring its trouble free long term performance. The cooker mat is illustrated is commonly used as a milk cooker.<br>
Only the preferred embodiment of the cooker according to the invention has been illustrated and described in this specification. The invention should not be construed to be limited to this particular embodiment but has a broader scope in enabling the protection of the whistle provided on the side wall of other embodiments. Also instead of milk any other cooking medium can be taken within the vessel.<br><br><br>
