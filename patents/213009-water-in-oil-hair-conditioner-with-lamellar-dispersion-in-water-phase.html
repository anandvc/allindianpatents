WATER-IN-OIL HAIR CONDITIONER WITH LAMELLAR DISPERSION IN WATER PHASE<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai-400 020, State of Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
WATER-IN-OIL    HAIR     CONDITIONER    WITH    LAMELLAR DISPERSION   IN WATER   PHASE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Traditionally; hair conditioners have used a combination of cationic." surfactants and" long chain fatty " alcohols to provide a desirable viscosity and an opaque appearance. It is generally believed that the conditioning benefit is mainly due to the deposition of lamellar gel phase formed by a mixture of alkyl cationic quaternary ammonium compound and fatty alcohol. In most U.S. conditioners dialkyl cationic quat is used, whereas monoalkyl quat is used in most European formulations. The difference between these two systems is that the dialkyl quat can form a lamellar gel phase by itself while the monoquat is too water soluble to do. so alone and- ::reqti±res: the addition"-of fatty alcohol to create the lamellar- gel structure.<br>
Recent results suggest that to achieve the best instrumental<br>
wet . combing for conditioners, less fatty alcohol is<br>
preferred. However., it is also known that taking fatty<br>
alcohol out of the dialkyl-based conditioners results in a<br>
translucent and thin product. These attributes are<br>
considered negatives by consumers.	Therefore a<br>
problem in the art has been to thicken and opacify the non-fatty alcohol containing lamellar system. In the present invention,  the compositions have both high viscosity and<br><br><br>
opacity through the use of a high internal phase water-in-oil emulsion with the lamellar gel particles dispersed inside the internal water phase.<br>

Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, % means weight %. The starting materials set forth herein are either known or can be prepared in accordance with known methods.<br>
By the word lamellar is meant lypotropic lamellar phases.<br>
The lamellar phases including lamellar dispersion consist,:. of.■ stacks of, surfactant bilayersr -separated." by a solvent, , usually water. The non-polar portions of the. surfactant associate with each other and form a bilayer "unit. Water"is* dispersed""between the layers of surfactant polar groups. In this invention, the lamellar phase consists of a multilayered vesicle (or liposome)-like structure at ambient temperature. That is, the surfactant systems used in this invention have a Krafft temperature<br>
higher than 25°C. The Krafft temperature corresponds to the . melting point of the hydrocarbon chains in the surfactant, { and is the temperature below which the surfactant | hydrocarbon chains are solid-like and ordered. For example, 
chloride ; is about 47°C. ■ Below that temperature including: room temperature the surfactants form lamellar dispersed phases with  particle sizes in the ranges of sub-micron , to; ten microns.<br>
