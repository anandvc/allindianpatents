				<td>Fungicidal composition comprising a pyridvlmethvlbenzamide derivative and a<br>
thiazolecarboxamide derivative<br>
The present invention relates to novel fungicidal compositions comprising a pyridylmethylbenzamide derivative and a thiazolecarboxamide derivative, The present invention also relates to a method of combating phytopathogenic fungi by applying at a locus infested or liable to be infested such a composition.<br>
European patent application EP-A-1056723 genetically discloses the possibility of combining pyridylmethybenzamide derivatives with known fungicidal products to develop a fungicidal activity.<br>
International patent application WO 02/069713 discloses fungicidal mixtures comprising a pyridylmethylbenzamide derivative and phosphorous acid or one of its derivatives.<br>
Internationa] patent application WO 2004/079788 discloses numerous fungicidal mixtures comprising a pyridylmethybenzamide derivative and an other fungicide active ingredient. Thiazolecarboxamide derivatives are not cited as potential partners of pyridylmethybenzamide derivatives.<br>
Some of the above mentioned mixtures have shown a synergistic effect. Nevertheless, it is always of high-interest in agriculture to use novel pesticidal mixtures showing a synergistic effect in order to avoid or to control the development of resistant strains to the active ingredients or to the mixtures of known active ingredients used by the fanner while minimising, the doses of chemical products spread in the environment and reducing the cost of the treatment.<br>
We have now found some novel fungicidal compositions which possess the above mentioned characteristics.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a composition comprising : a) a pyridylmethylbenzamide derivative of general formula (I)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which :<br>
-	R1 may be a hydrogen atom, an optionally substituted alkyl group or an<br>
optionally substituted acyl group;<br>
-	R2 may be a hydrogen atom or an optionally substituted alkyl group;<br>
-	R3 and R4 may be chosen independently from each other as being a halogen<br>
atom, a hydroxyl group, a cyano group, a nitro group, -SF5, a trialkylsilyl group, an<br>
optionally substituted amino group, an acyl group, or a group E, OE or SE, in which<br>
E may be an alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, aryl or a heterocyclyl<br>
group each of which may optionally be substituted;<br>
-	p represents 0, 1,2,3 or 4;<br>
-	q represents 0, 1,2, 3 or 4;<br>
and its agriculturally acceptable optical and/or geometric isomers, tautomers and<br>
addition salts with an acid or a base;<br>
and<br>
b) N-(cyano-2-thienylmethyl)-4-ethyl-2-(ethylamino)-5-thiazolecarboxamide;<br>
in a (a) / (b) weight ratio of from 0.01 to 10.<br>
N-(cyano-2-thienylmethyl)-4-ethyl-2-(ethylamino)-5-thiazolecarboxamide   is a thiazolecarboxamide derivative fungicide also known as ethaboxam. In the context of the present invention :<br>
-	the term halogen means bromine, chlorine, iodine or fluorine;<br>
-	the term alkyl means a linear or branched saturated hydrocarbon group containing<br>
from 1 to 6 carbon atoms;<br>
-	the term alkenyl means a linear or branched hydrocarbon group containing from 2<br>
to 6 carbon atoms and an unsaturation in the form of double bond;<br>
-	the term alkynyl means a linear or branched hydrocarbon group containing from 2<br>
to 6 carbon atoms and an unsaturation in the form of a triple bond;<br>
-	the term alkoxy means a linear or branched alkyloxy group containing from to 1 to<br>
6 carbon atoms;<br>
-	the term acyl means a formyl group or linear or branched alkoxycarbonyl group<br>
containing from 2 to 6 carbon atoms;<br>
-	the term cycloalkyl means a saturated cyclic hydrocarbon group containing from 3<br>
to 8 carbon atoms;<br>
-	the term aryl means a phenyl or naphthyl group;<br>
-	the term heterocyclyl means saturated, partially saturated, unsaturated or aromatic<br>
cyclic group containing from 3 to 8 atoms, which may be a carbon atom, a nitrogen<br>
atom, a sulphur atom or an oxygen atom. Examples of such hetercoyclyl may be pyridyl, pyridinyl, quinolyl, furyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl, oxazolinyl; - the term "optionally substituted " means that the group thus termed may be substituted with one or more groups which may be halogen, alkyl, alkoxy, hydroxyl, nitro, amin, cyano or acyl.<br>
The composition according to the present invention provides a synergistic effect. This synergistic effect allows a reduction of the chemical substances spread into the environment and a reduction of the cost of the fungal treatment.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the term "synergistic effect" is defined by Colby according to the article entitled "Calculation of the synergistic and antagonistic responses of herbicide combinations" Weeds, (1967), 15, pages 20-22.<br>
The latter article mentions the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which E represents the expected percentage of inhibition of the disease for the combination of the two fungicides at defined doses (for example equal to x and y respectively), x is the percentage of inhibition observed for the disease by the compound (I) at a defined dose (equal to x), y is the percentage of inhibition observed for the disease by the compound (II) at a defined dose (equal to y). When the percentage of inhibition observed for the combination is greater than E, there is a synergistic effect.<br>

The composition according to the present invention may further comprise an other additional component such as an agriculturally acceptable support, carrier or filler.<br>
In the present specification, the term "support" denotes a natural or synthetic, organic or inorganic material with which the active material is combined to make it easier to apply, notably to the parts of the plant. This support is thus generally inert and should be agriculturally acceptable. The support may be a solid or a liquid. Examples of suitable supports include clays, natural or synthetic silicates, silica, resins, waxes, solid fertilisers, water, alcohols, in particular butanol, organic solvents, mineral and plant oils and derivatives thereof. Mixtures of such supports may also be used.<br>
The composition may also comprise other additional components. In particular, the composition may further comprise a surfactant. The surfactant can be an emulsifier, a dispersing agent or a wetting agent of ionic or non-ionic type or a mixture of such surfactants. Mention may be made, for example, of polyacrylic acid salts, lignosulphonic acid salts, phenolsulphonic or naphthalenesulphonic acid salts, polycQndensates of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols or with fatty acids or with fatty amines, substituted phenols (in particular alkylphenols or arylphenols), salts of sulphosuccinic acid esters, taurine derivatives (in particular alkyl taurates), phosphoric esters of polyoxyethylated alcohols or phenols, fatty acid esters of polyols, and derivatives of the above compounds containing sulphate, sulphonate and phosphate functions. The presence of at least one surfactant is generally essential when the active material and/or the inert support are water-insoluble and when the<br>
vector agent for the application is water. Preferably, surfactant content may be comprised between 5% and 40% by weight of the composition.<br>
Additional components may also be included, e.g. protective colloids, adhesives, thickeners, thixotropic agents, penetration agents, stabilisers, sequestering agents. More generally, the active materials can be combined with any solid or liquid additive, which complies with the usual formulation techniques.<br>
In general, the composition according to the invention may contain from 0.05 to 99% (by weight) of active material, preferably 10 to 70% by weight.<br>
Compositions according to the present invention can be used in various forms such as aerosol dispenser, capsule suspension, cold fogging concentrate, dustable powder, emulsifiable concentrate, emulsion oil in water, emulsion water in oil, encapsulated granule, fine granule, flowable concentrate for seed treatment, gas (under pressure), gas generating product, granule, hot fogging concentrate, macrogranule, microgranule, oil dispersible powder, oil miscible flowable concentrate, oil miscible liquid, paste, plant rodlet, powder for dry seed treatment, seed coated with a pesticide, soluble concentrate, soluble powder, solution for seed treatment, suspension concentrate (flowable concentrate), ultra low volume (ulv) liquid, ultra low volume (ulv) suspension, water dispersible granules or tablets, water dispersible powder for slurry treatment, water soluble granules or tablets, water soluble powder for seed treatment and wettable powder.<br>
These compositions include not only compositions which are ready to be applied to the plant or seed to be treated by means of a suitable device, such as a spraying or dusting device, but also concentrated commercial compositions which must be diluted before they are applied to the crop..<br>
The fungicidal compositions of the present invention can be used to curatively or preventively control the phytopathogenic fungi of crops. Thus, according to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for preventively or curatively controlling phytopathogenic fungi of crops characterised in that a fungicidal composition as hereinbefore defined is applied to the seed, the plant and/or to the fruit of the plant or to the soil in which the plant is growing or in which it is desired to grow.<br>
The composition as used against phytopathogenic fungi of crops comprises an effective and non-phytotoxic amount of an active material of general formula (I).<br>
The expression "effective and non-phytotoxic amount" means an amount of composition according to the invention which is sufficient to control or destroy the fungi present or liable to appear on the crops, and which does not entail any appreciable<br>
symptom of phytotoxicity for the said crops. Such an amount can vary within a wide range depending on the fungus to be combated, the type of crop, the climatic conditions and the compounds included in the fungicidal composition according to the invention.<br>
This amount can be determined by systematic field trials, which are within the capabilities of a person skilled in the art.<br>
The method of treatment according to the present invention is useful to treat propagation material such as tubers or rhizomes, but also seeds, seedlings or seedlings pricking out and plants or plants pricking out. This method of treatment can also be useful to treat roots. The method of treatment according to the present invention can also be useful to treat the overground parts of the plant such as trunks, stems or stalks, leaves, flowers and fruits of the concerned plant.<br>
Among the plants that can be protected by the method according to the present invention, mention may be made of cotton; flax; vine; fruit or vegetable crops such as Rosaceae sp. (for instance pip fruit such as apples and pears, but also stone fruit such as apricots, almonds and peaches), Ribesioidae sp., Juglandaceae sp., Betulaceae sp., Anacardiaceae sp., Fagaceae sp,, Moraceae sp., Oleaceae sp., Actinidaceae sp., Lauraceae sp,, Musaceae sp.

The fungicidal composition according to the present invention may also be used against fungal diseases liable to grow on or inside timber. The term "timber" means all types of species of wood, and all types of working of this wood intended for construction, for example solid wood, high-density wood, laminated wood, and plywood. The method for treating timber according to the invention mainly consists in contacting one or more compounds of the present invention, or a composition according to the invention; this includes for example direct application, spraying, dipping, injection or any other suitable means.<br>
The dose of active material usually applied in the treatment according to the present invention is generally and advantageously between 10 and 2000 g/ha, preferably between 50 and 1500 g/ha for applications in foliar treatment. The dose of active substance applied is generally and advantageously between 2 and 200 g per 100 kg of seed, preferably between 3 and 150 g per 100 kg of seed in the case of seed treatment. It is clearly understood that the doses indicated above are given as illustrative examples of the invention. A person skilled in the art will know how to adapt the application doses according to the nature of the crop to be treated.<br>
The fungicidal composition according to the present invention may also be used in the treatment of genetically modified organisms with the compounds according to the invention or the agrochemical compositions according to the invention. Genetically modified plants are plants into whose genome a heterologous gene encoding a protein of interest has been stably integrated. The expression "heterologous gene encoding a protein of interest" essentially means genes which give the transformed plant new agronomic properties, or genes for improving the agronomic quality of the transformed plant.<br>
The compositions according to the present invention may also be used fore the preparation of composition useful to curarively or preventively treat human and animal fungal diseases such as, for example, mycoses, dermatoses, trichophyton diseases and candidiases or diseases caused by Aspergillus spp., for example Aspergillus fumigatus. <br><br><br><br>
