Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000412<br>
TURBINE OFFSET MATCHING CONTROL SYSTEM<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to methods and systems for<br>
controlling an engine and more particularly to methods and systems for enabling<br>
a deceleration fuel cutoff operating mode of the engine.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements In this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Automatic transmissions use a fluid clutch known as a torque<br>
converter to transfer engine torque from the engine to the transmission. The<br>
torque converter operates through hydraulic force provided by pressurized fluid<br>
from the automatic transmission. The torque converter multiplies engine torque<br>
and directs it through the transmission.<br>
[0004] A conventional torque converter includes a sealed chamber<br>
filled with hydraulic fluid. The chamber includes a pump (or impeller) driven by<br>
the engine, a turbine connected to an output shaft, and a stator that provides<br>
torque multiplication. A torque converter is said to "slip" when the impeller speed<br>
and the turbine speed are not equivalent. Some converters incorporate a lockup<br>
mechanism such as a mechanical clutch that engages at cruising speeds to<br>
physically link the impeller with the turbine. The physical link causes the impeller<br>
and the turbine to rotate at the same or near the same speed, thereby reducing<br>
1<br><br>
GM Reference No. GP-308648-PTT-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000412<br>
or eliminating slip. The dutch is applied and released via fluid supplied through a<br>
hollow shaft at the center axis of the rotating converter assembly,<br>
[0005] In some applications, the engine may employ a deceleration fuel<br>
cutoff device that is capable of operating the engine in a deceleration fuel cutoff<br>
(DFCO) mode. Operating in a DFCO mode Is desirable during overrun<br>
conditions (i.e., going down a hill) or in city traffic, as well as for engine speed<br>
limitation purposes. Operation in the DFCO mode contributes to improved fuel<br>
economy.<br>
[0006] in order to enter the DFCO mode, it is desirable for the torque<br>
converter clutch to be applied. This reverses the transfer of torque. More<br>
specifically, the applied clutch allows torque to be transferred from rotating drive<br>
wheels back to the engine crankshaft when the vehicle coasts. If the slip across<br>
the torque converter is too high or too low prior to entering the DFCO mode, the<br>
application of the torque converter clutch may be delayed or may not occur at all.<br>
Hence, delaying or preventing the engine from operating in the DFCO mode and<br>
thus, impacting fuel economy.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] Accordingly, a control system for enabling an engine to operate<br>
in a deceleration fuel cutoff (DFCO) mode is provided. The system includes: an<br>
enable module that selectively enables a DFCO mode based on an accelerator<br>
pedal position; and an engine speed module that regulates engine speed based<br>
2<br><br><br>
GM Reference No. GP-308648-PTT-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-0GQ412<br>
on turbine speed during a predetermined time period after the DFCO mode is<br>
enabled.<br>
[0008] In other features, a method for enabling a deceleration fuel<br>
cutoff mode of an internal combustion engine is provided. The method includes:<br>
receiving a deceleration fuel cutoff (DFCO) request wherein the DFCO request is<br>
initiated based on an accelerator pedal position; controlling engine speed based<br>
on turbine speed after receiving the DFCO request; applying a torque converter<br>
clutch when the engine speed is within a predetermined range of the turbine<br>
speed; and enabling the DFCO mode after the clutch is applied.<br>
[0009] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0014] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should be<br>
understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features. As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that executes one<br>
or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or<br>
other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
t<br>
[0015] Referring to Figure 1, a vehicle 10 includes an engine 12 that<br>
drives a transmission 14. Air flows into the engine 12 through a throttle 16.<br>
Fuel is combined with the air to be combusted within cylinders 18. The<br>
combustion process reciprocally drives pistons (not shown) within the cylinders<br>
18. The pistons rotatably drive a crankshaft 22 to produce drive torque. The<br>
engine 12 includes N cylinders 18. Although Figure 1 depicts four cylinders (N =<br>
4), it is appreciated that the engine 12 may include additional or fewer cylinders<br>
18. For example, engines having 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 16 cylinders are<br>
contemplated.<br>
[0016] Torque from the engine 12 is supplied to the transmission 14<br>
through a torque converter (TC) 24. The torque converter 24 may be any known<br>
lockup converter including a turbine, a stator, and a torque converter clutch<br>
(TCC). The transmission 14 multiplies the drive torque generated by the engine<br>
12 through one of a plurality of gear ratios to drive a vehicle driveline 26. The<br>
4<br><br>
GM Reference No. GP-308648-PTT-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000412<br>
transmission 14 includes a hydraulic pump 28 that regulates pressurized fluid<br>
within the transmission 14 and controls fluid flow to and from the TC 24 via at<br>
least one solenoid-operated valve 30.<br>
[0017] An engine speed sensor 38 generates an engine speed signal<br>
based on a rotational speed of the crankshaft 22. A turbine speed sensor 40<br>
generates a turbine speed signal based on a rotational speed of the turbine<br>
within the torque converter 24. The control module receives the signals and<br>
commands a current and/or pulse width modulated signal to the solenoid 30 in<br>
order to vary the supply of pressurized fluid to the torque converter 24. The<br>
control module 32 controls a slip rate of the TC 24 by varying the pressurized<br>
fluid.<br>
[0018] A vehicle operator manipulates an accelerator pedal 34 to<br>
regulate the throttle 16. A pedal position sensor 36 senses the position of the<br>
accelerator pedal 34 and generates a pedal position signal that is communicated<br>
to the control module 32. The control module 32 generates a throttle control<br>
signal based on the pedal position signal. A throttle actuator (not shown) adjusts<br>
the throttle 16 based on the throttle control signal to regulate air flow into the<br>
engine 12. Such method of controlling the throttle 18 is referred to as electronic<br>
throttle control (ETC). The control module 32 adjusts fuel quantity and generates<br>
a fuel signal to the engine 12 based on the air flow.<br>
[0019] When the pedal position signal indicates that the pedal 34 has<br>
been released and the vehicle is operating in a coast mode, the control module<br>
32 communicates with the engine 12 and various sensors and actuators to<br>
5<br><br>
GM Reference No, GP-308648-PTT-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000412<br>
control the activation of a deceleration fuel cutoff (DFCO) mode. In order to<br>
smooth the transition into the DFCO mode, the control module 32 controls the<br>
throttle 16 based on engine speed, turbine speed, and a turbine offset matching<br>
method and system according to the present disclosure.<br>
[0020] More particularly, the control module 32 determines when the<br>
DFCO mode is desired and controls the throttle 16 and fuel such that the engine<br>
speed is equal to the turbine speed plus a predetermined offset. Controlling the<br>
engine speed to be within a predetermined range of the turbine speed allows for<br>
the torque converter clutch to be applied. Once the torque converter clutch is<br>
applied, the DFCO mode is enabled thereby disabling fuel to the engine 12.<br>
Thereafter, the transmission 14 backdrives the unfueled engine 12 through the<br>
torque converter 24 to maintain a default engine speed.<br>
[0021] Referring to Figure 2, a dataflow diagram illustrates various<br>
embodiments of a turbine offset matching system that may be embedded within<br>
the control module 32. Various embodiments of turbine offset matching systems<br>
according to the present disclosure may include any number of sub-modules<br>
embedded within the control module 32. The sub-modules shown may be<br>
combined and/or further partitioned to similarly control the engine during<br>
activation of the DFCO mode. Inputs to the system may be sensed from the<br>
vehicle 10, received from other control modules (not shown) within the vehicle<br>
10, and/or determined from other sub-modules within the control module 32. In<br>
various embodiments, the control module 32 of Figure 2 includes a DFCO enable<br>
module 50 and an engine speed control module 52.<br>
6<br><br>
GM Reference No. GP-308648-PTT-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000412<br>
[0022] The DFCO enable module 50 receives as input the accelerator<br>
pedal position 54. Based on the accelerator pedal position 54, the DFCO enable<br>
module 50 selectively sets a DFCO enable flag 56. The DFCO enable flag 56 is<br>
set to TRUE when the accelerator pedal position 54 indicates that an accelerator<br>
pedal tip-out has occurred (e.g., the operator has released the pedal 34 (Figure<br>
1}). Otherwise the DFCO enable FLAG 56 remains set to FALSE. The engine<br>
speed control module 52 receives as input the DFCO enable flag 56, engine<br>
speed 58, turbine speed 60, and gear 62. When the DFCO enable flag 56 is<br>
TRUE, the engine speed control module 52 controls a desired engine speed to<br>
be nearly the same as the turbine speed. In various embodiments the desired<br>
engine speed is controlled to be near the turbine speed plus a predetermined<br>
offset. More particularly, the engine control module 52 controls the throttle 16<br>
(Figure 1) via a throttle control signal 64 as a function of gear 62 and engine<br>
speed 58 such that the desired engine speed is achieved. The throttle 16 is<br>
controlled for a predetermine time period. Once the time period expires, the<br>
desired engine speed is gradually adjusted back to a default value and the<br>
throttle is controlled via the throttle control signal 64 accordingly.<br>
[0023] Referring now to Figure 3, a method of turbine offset matching<br>
for deceleration fuel cutoff is shown. The method can be run continually during<br>
engine operation. DFCO enable conditions are evaluated at 100. If the DFCO<br>
mode is desired at 100, control evaluates a timer at 102. If a time since<br>
accelerator pedal tip-out has not expired at 102, engine speed is controlled via<br>
the ETC at 104.  More particularly, the throttle is controlled based on gear and<br>
7<br><br>
GM Reference No, GP-308648-PTT-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000412<br>
current engine speed such that the ultimate engine speed is near the turbine<br>
speed plus a predetermined offset (e.g., 100 RPM). Control continues to control<br>
the engine speed via the throttle at 104 until the timer expires at 102. When the<br>
timer expires at 102; the throttle is controlled back to a default value at 106.<br>
[0024] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing •<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present disclosure, can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure has been<br>
described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the<br>
disclosure should not be so limited since other modifications will become<br>
apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, specification,<br>
