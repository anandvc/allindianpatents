DESCRIPTION PORPHYRAZINE COLORING MATTER, INK, INK SET AND COLORED PRODUCT<br>
Technical Field [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a novel porphyrazine coloring matter, an ink, an ink set, a method for Inkjet recording using this ink or ink set, and a colored product thereby.<br>
Background Art [0002]<br>
Recently, as image recording materials, materials to form color images are particularly in the main stream, and specifically Inkjet recording materials, thermal transfer image recording materials, recording materials using an electrophotographic method, transfer silver halide photosensitive materials, printing inks, recording pens and the like are extensively used. In addition, color filters are used in LCD (liquid crystal display) and PDP (plasma display panel) for displays and in electronic parts such as CCD (imaging device) for photographing equipments. In these color image recording materials and color filters are used coloring matters (dyes and pigments) of 3 primary colors for so-called additive and subtractive color processes to reproduce and record full color images, but it is the case that there is no coloring matter which has absorption characteristics to realize preferable color reproduction areas and is durable to various use conditions, and therefore improvement is strongly desired. [0003]<br>
The Inkjet recording method has been rapidly spreading and also developing because its material cost is low, rapid recording is possible, noise in recording is less and also color recording is easy. The Inkjet recording method includes a continuous method where ink droplets are continuously flown and an on-demand method where ink droplets are flown responding to an image information signal, and its discharging<br><br>
method includes a method where ink droplets are discharged by applying pressure with piezoelectric elements, a method where bubbles are generated in ink by heat to discharge ink droplets, a method using an ultrasonic wave, a method where ink droplets are absorbed and discharged by electrostatic force, or the like. In addition, examples of ink suitable for Inkjet recording include a water-based ink, an oil-based ink, a solid (melting-type) ink and the like. [0004]<br>
Required points on the coloring matter to be used in an ink suitable for such Inkjet recording includes such points that its solubility or dispersibility to solvent is good, high density recording is possible, its hue is good in both monochrome and combination color, it is tolerant to light, heat, and active gases in the atmosphere (oxidizing gas such as NOx and ozone and other gases such as SOx), it has excellent fastness to water and chemicals, its fixation to record-receiving materials is good and therefore it hardly bleeds out, it is excellent in storage stability as ink, it has no toxicity, it is also inexpensively available, and so on. Particularly, strongly desired is a cyan coloring matter which has a good cyan hue, is excellent in light fastness (durability to light), ozone fastness (durability to ozone gas) and moisture fastness (durability under high humidity), and does not exhibit bronze phenomenon (also referred to as bronzing phenomenon). The bronze phenomenon means a glare phenomenon caused by that coloring matter is aggregated on the surface of glossy paper and the like due to association and aggregation of coloring matter or malabsorption of ink Into media to give metallic luster. Occurrence of this phenomenon causes inferiority in all views of glossiness, print quality and print density. [0005]<br>
Phthalocyanine and triphenylmethane skeletons are representative of the skeleton for water-soluble cyan coloring matters used for an ink suitable for inkjet recording. The typical phthalocyanine coloring matter which is the most widely reported and used includes phthalocyanine derivatives classified into from A to H below.<br><br>
[0006]<br>
A: known phthalocyanine coloring matters such as C.I.Direct Blue 86, C.I.Direct Blue 87, C.I.Direct Blue 199, C.I.Acid Blue 249, C.I.Reactive Blue 71. [0007]<br>
B: the phthalocyanine coloring matters described in Patent Literatures 1 to 3 and the like<br>
(for example, a mixture of Cu-Pc-(S03Na)m(S02NH2)n : m + n = a number of 1 to 4). [0008]<br>
C: the phthalocyanine coloring matters described in Patent Literature 4 and the like (for example, Cu-Pc-(C02H)m(CONRiR2)n : m + n = a number of 0 to 4). [0009]<br>
D: the phthalocyanine coloring matters described in Patent Literature 5 and the like (for example, Cu-Pc-(S03H)m(S02NRiR2)n : m + n = a number of 0 to 4 and m * 0). [0010]<br>
E: the phthalocyanine coloring matters described in Patent Literature 6 and the like (for example, Cu-Pc-(S03H)i(S02NH2)m(S02NRiR2)n : I + m + n = a number of 0 to<br>
4).<br>
[0011]<br>
F: the phthalocyanine coloring matters described in Patent Literature 7 and the like (for example, Cu-Pc-(S02NRiR2)n : n = a number of 1 to 5). [0012]<br>
G: the phthalocyanine coloring matters described in Patent Literatures 8, 9, 12 and the like<br>
(the phthalocyanine compound where the substitution position of the substituent is controlled and the phthalocyanine coloring matter where a substituent is introduced at the p-position). [0013]<br>
H: the benzo pyridoporphyrazine coloring matters having a pyridine ring and a benzene ring which are described in Patent Literatures 10, 13, 14 and the like.<br><br>
[0014]<br>
The phthalocyanine coloring matter as typified by C.I.Direct Blue 86 or C.I.Direct Blue 199 used generally and widely at present has a characteristic of having excellent light fastness compared with magenta coloring matters and yellow coloring matters known in general. The phthalocyanine coloring matter is not very preferable as a cyan ink because it has a green tinged hue under acidic conditions. Therefore, when these coloring matters are used as a cyan ink, they are preferably used under neutral to alkaline conditions. However, although the ink is neutral to alkaline, it is possible that the hue of printed matter is largely changed when the record-receiving material to be used is an acidic paper, [0015]<br>
In addition, when the phthalocyanine coloring matter is used as a cyan ink, the hue of printed matter is changed to be green tinged as well as color fading occurs due to oxidizing gases such as nitrogen oxide gas and ozone which are often raised as an environmental issue in recent years, resulting in that the print density is decreased. [0016]<br>
On the other hand, the triphenylmethane coloring matter is good in hue, but very inferior in light fastness, ozone fastness and moisture fastness. [0017]<br>
From here on, when the application field of inkjet recording is expanded and widely used for articles on exhibition of ads and the like, the coloring matter and ink to be used there will be more and more strongly required to have a good hue and be inexpensive as well as to be excellent in light fastness, fastness to active gases in the environment and moisture fastness because they will be more often exposed to light and active gases in the environment (oxidizing gases such as NOx, SOx and ozone, and the like). However, it is difficult to develop a cyan coloring matter (for example, phthalocyanine coloring matter) and a cyan ink satisfying these requirements at a high level. So far, Patent Literatures 3, 8 to 12, 14 and the like disclose the phthalocyanine coloring matters where active gas fastness is imparted, but any cyan<br><br>
coloring matter and cyan ink have yet to be obtained whicii satisfies all the quality of<br>
hue, light fastness, ozone fastness and moisture fastness, does not exhibit the<br>
bronze phenomenon, and also can be produced inexpensively. Therefore, the<br>
requirements of the market have not yet been satisfied enough.<br>

Effect of the Invention [0031]<br>
An ink using the compound of the present invention is an ink which has a good hue as a cyan ink and is excellent in light fastness, ozone fastness and moisture fastness. In addition, It exhibits no crystal precipitation, no change in physical properties and color after storage for a long period of time, nor the like, so it has good storage stability. Further, it can show a color tone in a wide visible region by using together with other magenta ink and yellow ink, particularly a blue hue in a wider range when used together with magenta ink. Therefore, a cyan ink using the porphyrazine coloring matter of the present invention is extremely useful as an ink for Inkjet recording.<br><br>
Best Mode for Carrying out the invention 10032]<br>
The present invention will be specifically explained. The ink suitable for Inkjet recording of the present invention is characterized by containing the porphyrazine coloring matter of the above formula (1). That is, it has been found that an ink using tetrabenzoporphyrazine (typically referred to as phthalocyanine) where 1 to 3 of the 4 benzo rings are replaced with nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings as a mother nucleus of coloring matter and a porphyrazine coloring matter where an unsubstituted sulfamoyi group and a substituted sulfamoyi group are introduced has extremely excellent fastness to ozone gas, hardly causes bronze phenomenon and further exhibit a blue hue in a wider range when used together with magenta ink.<br>
In this connection, when the term "alkyl" is used in the present description, the preferable number of carbon atoms varies depending on the use situation but is generally about 1 to 20, preferably about 1 to 10; and the term "aryl" used in the present description varies depending on the use situation but is typically an aromatic ring group having about 6 to 14 carbon atoms, preferably an aromatic ring group having about 6 to 10 carbon atoms, and can specifically include a phenyl group or a naphthyl group. In addition, the halogen atom can include a chlorine atom, a bromine atom, an iodine atom and the like, typically preferably a chlorine atom. Further, the heterocycle can include a heterocycle having 3 to 10 rings which contains a heteroatom such as an oxygen atom, a nitrogen atom or/and a sulfur atom. [0033]<br>
In the above formula (1), the nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring in 6-menbered aromatic rings of A to D includes, for example, a 6-membered aromatic ring containing 1 to 2 nitrogen atoms such as a pyridine ring, a pyrazine ring, a pyrimidine ring or a pyridazine ring. Among them, a pyridine ring is the most preferable. In the above formula (1), 1 to 3 out of A to D are nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings and the rest are benzene rings. As the number of nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings is increased, ozone fastness is improved<br><br>
but bronzing phenomenon is apt to occur, tlierefore it is advisable tliat the number of nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings is accordingly controlled to select a well balanced ratio in view of ozone fastness and bronzing phenomenon.

Specific examples of A, B, C, D, E, X and Y in the porphyrazine coloring matter represented by the above formula (1) of the present invention are shown in Table 1, but the porphyrazine coloring matter to be used in the present invention is not limited to the following examples. In addition, when the nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring corresponding to A, B, C or D is a pyridine ring, positional isomers of the nitrogen atom exist as described afterward and synthesis for coloring matter gives a mixture of isomers. It is difficult to isolate these isomers and it is also difficult to identify isomers by analysis. Therefore, the mixture is typically used as it is, and these isomers are not distinguished to describe here because no problem is particularly posed in the present invention in spite of a mixture of isomers. [0039] [Table 1]<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
(wherein, A, B, C and D have the same meanings as In the formula (1)) [0044]<br>
In order to synthesize the copper porphyrazine coloring matter represented by the above formula (6), a conventional known manner can be applied. For example, It is obtained by reaction of a 6-membered nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring dicarboxylic acid derivative having aromaticity with a phthalic acid derivative in the presence of catalyst and a copper compound.<br>
The number of nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings and the number of benzene rings in A, B, C and D can be adjusted by changing the molar ratio in reaction of the nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring dicarboxylic acid derivative with the phthalic acid derivative. For example, when 1 to 3 out of 4 aromatic 6-membered rings of A to D in the present invention are nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings and the rest are benzene rings, an intended compound can be obtained by that the nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring dicarboxylic acid derivative and the phthalic acid derivative are respectively used at a use ratio in the range of 0.25 mol to 0.75 mol according to the content ratio so that the total of the both is 1 mol. For example, in the case of 1 nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring and 3 benzene rings, it is advisable the nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring dicarboxylic acid derivative is used at a ratio of 0.25 mol and the phthalic acid<br><br>
derivative is used at a ratio of 0.75 mol.<br>

[0045]<br>
The method to synthesize copper porphyrazine coloring matter typically includes the nitrile method and Wyler method, which require different reaction conditions and the like. The nitrile method is a method for synthesis of a porphyrazine coloring matter using, as a material, a dicarbonitrile compound such as pyridine-2,3-dicarbonitrile, pyrazine-2,3-dicarbonitrile and phthalonitrile. On the other hand, Wyler method utilizes, as a material, a dicarboxylic acid compound such as phthalic acid, quinolinic acid, 3,4-pyridine dicarboxylic acid and 2,3-pyrazinedicarboxylic acid, an acid anhydride compound such as phthalic anhydride, quinolinic anhydride, 3,4-pyridinedicarboxylic anhydride and 2,3-pyrazinedicarboxylic anhydride, a dicarboxamide compound such as phthalamide, pyridine-2,3-dicarboxamide, a dicarboxylic acid monoamide compound such as phthalamic acid and pyrazine-2,3- dicarboxylic acid monoamide, and acid imide<br><br>
compounds such as phthalimide and quinolinic acid imide. In Wyler method, addition -of urea is essential and the use amount of urea is a molar quantity of 5 to 100 times mol to 1 mol of the total amount of the nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring dicarboxylic acid derivative and the phthalic acid derivative. [0046]<br>
Typically, the reaction is carried out in the presence of a solvent and the nitrile method utilizes, as a solvent, an organic solvent having a boiling point of 100°C or more, more preferably 130'*C or more. The solvent includes, for example, n-amylalcohol, n-hexanol, cyclohexanol, 2-methyl-1-pentanol, 1-heptanol, 1-octanol, 2-ethylhexanol, N,N-dimethylaminoethanol, benzyl alcohol, ethyleneglycol, propylene glycol, trichlorobenzene, chloronaphthalene, nitrobenzene, quinoline, sulfolane, urea or the like. On the other hand, Wyler method utilizes, as a solvent, an aprotic organic solvent having a boiling point of ISO'C or more, more preferably 180°C or more. The solvent includes, for example, trichlorobenzene, chloronaphthalene, nitrobenzene, quinoline, sulfolane, urea or the like. The use amount of solvent is 1 to 100 times mass of the total amount of the nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring dicarboxylic acid derivative and the phthalic acid derivative. [0047]<br>
The catalyst in the nitrile method Includes cyclic bases such as quinoline and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5,4,0]-7-undecene; amines such as tributylamine, ammonia and N,N-dimethylaminoethanol; and alkali metal alcoholates such as sodium ethoxide and sodium methoxide. On the other hand, the catalyst in Wyler method includes ammonium molybdate, boric acid and the like. The addition amount is 0.001 to 1 time mol to 1 mol of the total amount of the nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring dicarboxylic acid derivative and the phthalic acid derivative. [0048]<br>
The copper compound includes metal copper or copper compounds such as halide, carboxylic acid salt, sulfuric acid salt, nitric acid salt, acetylacetonate or complexes of copper. The copper compound includes copper chloride, copper<br><br>
bromide, copper acetate, copper acetylacetonate and the like. Tine use amount of the copper compound is 0.15 to 0.35 times mo! to 1 mo! of the total amount of the nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring dicarboxylic acid derivative and the phthalic acid derivative. [0049]<br>
The reaction temperature in the nitrile method is typically 100 to 200°C and preferably 130 to 170°C. On the other hand, the reaction temperature in Wyler method is 150 to 300°C and preferably 170 to 220'C. In addition, the reaction time varies depending on the reaction conditions, however is typically 1 to 40 hours. After completion of reaction, the copper porphyrazine coloring matter of the above formula (6) is obtained by filtration, washing and drying. [0050]<br>
The present invention will be more specifically explained taking, for an example, the  compound  (copper diben2obis(2,3-pyrido)porphyrazine)   represented  by the above formula (6) where two out of A to D are pyridine rings and the rest two are benzene rings. [0051]<br>
The copper dibenzobis(2,3-pyrido)porphyrazine represented by the above formula (6) where two out of A, B, C and D are pyridine rings and the rest two are benzene rings is obtained by reaction of quinolinic acid (0.5 mol), phthalic anhydride (0.5 mol), copper (II) chloride (0.25 mol), ammonium phosphomolybdate (0.004 mol) and urea (6 mol) in a sulfolane solvent at 200'C for 5 hours. The reactivity varies depending on the kind or the use amount of quinolinic acid, phthalic anhydride, metal compound, solvent, catalyst and the like, not limited to the above. [0052]<br>
In addition, when synthesis is carried out by the above methods, the main component is copper diben2obis(2,3-pyrido)porphyrazine, and five kinds of isomers {the formulas (7-A) to (7-E)} where the positions of the pyridine ring and the pyridine ring   nitrogen   atom   are   different   are   produced.   At  the   same   time,   copper<br><br>
tribenzo(2,3-pyrido)porphyrazine {the formula (8) described later} represented by the above formula (6) where one out of A to D is a pyridine ring and the rest three are benzene rings and copper benzotris(2,3-pyrido)porphyrazine represented by the above formula (6) where three out of A to D are pyridine rings and the rest one is a benzene ring are by-produced and positional isomers of the pyridine ring nitrogen atom {the formulas (9-A) to (9-D) described later} further exist in these compounds, resulting in a complex mixture. Furthermore, copper tetrakis(2,3-pyrido)porphyrazine and copper phthalocyanine (copper tetrabenzoporphyrazine) are also produced even in an small amount. In general, it is difficult to isolate only the intended product from these mixtures, which are used intact in most cases as copper dibenzobis(2,3-pyrido)porphyrazine where the two are pyridine rings and the rest two are benzene rings on average.<br>
In the above description, copper dibenzobis(2,3-pyrido)porphyrazine where two out of A to D are pyridine rings and the rest two are benzene rings is mentioned. Even in the case of a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring except for pyridine, the compound where two are said nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings and the rest two are benzene rings can be obtained as well by carrying out synthesis according to the above, corresponding to said nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring. Moreover, it can be obtained as well, in the case of a compound having 1 or 3 nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings; a mixture of a compound having 1 nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring and a compound having 2 and/or 3 nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings; or the like, by changing the use ratio of the nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring dicarboxylic acid derivative and the phthalic acid derivative respectively depending on the ratio of the nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring and the benzene ring of the intended compound so that the ratio is in the range of about 0.25 moi to 0.75 mol and the total of the both is 1 mol. [0053]<br><br><br><br><br>
[0056]<br>
Next, the copper chlorosulfonylporphyrazine compound represented by the formula (3) is obtained by chlorosutfonylation of the copper porphyrazine coloring matter represented by the formula (6) in chlorosulfonic acid, or by sulfonation of the copper porphyrazine coloring matter represented by the fonnula (6) in sulfuric acid or fuming sulfuric acid followed by conversion of the sulfo group into a chlorosulfonyl group with a chlorination agent. The thus obtained chlorosulfonyl group or sulfo group is not introduced on the heteroaromatic ring group but introduced on the benzene ring, in A to D of the formula (6). Typically one chlorosulfonyl group or sulfo group is introduced on a benzene ring, so the number of the group introduced is within the number of the benzene ring. Therefore, the number of chlorosulfonyl groups (n) in the formula (3) is 1 to 3 corresponding to the number of the benzene ring of the compound of the formula (3). The intended compound of the formula (3) can be obtained by synthesis, as another example, of copper chlorosulfonylporphyrazine compound represented by the formula (3), where the copper porphyrazine coloring<br><br>
matter having a sulfo group represented by the formula (11) described later is synthesized by cyclocondensation with sulfophthalic acid having a sulfo group and quinolinic acid, followed by conversion of the sulfo group into a chlorosulfonyl group. The number of SO2CI groups (n) in the obtained compound of the formula (3) is 1 to 3 on average and preferably 2 to 3 on average, as above. [0057]<br>
The conditions of chlorosulfonylation reaction of the copper porphyrazine coloring matter are that chlorosulfonic acid is typically used as a solvent and the use amount is 3 to 20 times by weight of the porphyrazine coloring matter and preferably 5 to 10 times by weight. The reaction temperature is typically 100 to 150°C and preferably 120 to ISOC. The reaction time varies depending to the reaction conditions such as reaction temperature, however typically 1 to 10 hours. In this case, the substituent of the copper porphyrazine compound obtained is a mixture of a chlorosulfonyl group and a sulfo group, so it is preferable in the present invention that a chlorination agent such as thionyl chloride other than chlorosulfonic acid is further added to the reaction solution with chlorosulfonic acid to carry out the reaction so that the sulfo groups are all chlorosulfonylated. The amount of the chlorination agent other than the chlorosulfonic acid to be added is about 0.5 to 10 equivalents and preferably 0.5 to 5 equivalents to the sulfo group in the sulfo-substituted copper porphyrazine coloring matter. The chlorination agent includes chlorosulfonic acid, thionyl chloride, sulfuryl chloride, phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus pentachloride, phosphorus oxychloride and the like, but not limited thereto. [0058]<br>
In addition, the copper chlorosulfonylporphyrazine compound is also obtained<br>
by that a chlorination agent is applied to the copper porphyrazine coloring matter<br>
having a sulfo group represented by the following formula (11) for conversion of the<br>
sulfo group into a chlorosulfonyl group. The solvent to be used for chlorination<br>
reaction includes sulfuric acid, fuming sulfuric acid, chlorosulfonic acid, benzene,<br>
toluene,	nitrobenzene,	chlorobenzene,	N,N-dimethylformamide,<br><br>
N,N-dimethylacetoamide and the like, but not limited thereto. Further, the chlorination agent includes chlorosulfonic acid, thionyl chloride, sulfuryl chloride, phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus pentachloride, phosphorus oxychloride and the like, but not limited thereto. [0059]<br><br>
Next, the intended compound of the above formula (1) can be obtained by reaction of the copper chlorosulfonylporphyrazine compound (hereinafter, optionally, also referred to as chlorosulfonyl-POR) obtained above with the organic amine represented by the following formula (4) in the presence of ammonia (or in the presence of an aminating agent) in a water solvent, typically at pH 7 to 10, preferably pH 8 to 10, and typically 0 to 100°C, preferably 5 to 70°C, typically for 1 to 20 hours. Ammonia or ammonia source to be used for the reaction (the both are also together referred to as an aminating agent) includes, for example, ammonium salts such as ammonium chloride and ammonium sulfate, urea, ammonia water, ammonia gas and the like, but not limited thereto. In addition, the reaction of the copper chlorosulfonylporphyrazine compound, organic amine and an aminating agent is typically carried out in a water solvent.<br>
In this connection, for adjustment of the pH in the condensation, for example, commercially available 28% ammonia water is used directly or, if needed, after<br><br>
diluting with water. In addition, for example, when a compound of the formula (1) where b is 2 and c is 1 is aiso desired to be synthesized, a compound of the above formula (11) where p is 3 can be introduced into a chlorosulfonyl derivative and then reacted at the pH of the reaction system adjusted with an alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide or an alkali metal carbonate such as sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate in the presence of at least 2 mol equivalent of ammonia to said chlorosulfonyl-POR, in order to obtain a compound of the above formula (1) where b is 2 and c is 1.<br>
The pH in the reaction system is advisably in the range of typically 7 to 10, preferably 7.5 to 10 and more preferably 8 to 9.5 to carry out the reaction. In the case of obtaining the above formula (1), there is a tendency that a pH smaller than 7 in the reaction system results in that the chlorosulfonyl-POR is hydrolyzed to increase the ratio of a sulfonic acid derivative as a by-product, and a pH larger than 10 in the reaction system results in that hydrolyzation of the chlorosulfonyl-POR occurs as well as ammonia, if existing in large excess in the reaction system, is preferentially reacted with the chlorosulfonyl-POR to extremely decrease the reaction rate of the organic amine of the following formula (4) with the chlorosulfonyl-POR.<br>
Therefore, it is advisable that the addition ratio of ammonia, the organic amine of the following formula (4) and said chlorosulfonyl-POR and the pH in the reaction system are appropriately set in view of these points. [0061]<br><br>
(wherein, E, X and Y have the same meanings as in the formula (1)) [0062]<br>
in this connection, the use amount of the organic amine represented by the above formula (4) is typically 0,5 mol equivalent to 4 mol equivalent, preferably 0.5<br><br>
mol equivalent to 3.5 mol equivalent and more preferably 1 mol equivalent to 3 mol equivalent of the theoretical value to 1 mol of the copper chlorosulfonylporphyrazine compound. However, it varies depending on the reactivity of organic amine and the reaction conditions and not limited to these. [0063]<br>
The method to produce the organic amine represented by the formula (4) will be explained.<br>
For example, typically 0.95 to 1.1 mol of an aniline or a naphthylamine corresponding to X is reacted with 1 mol of 2,4,6-trichloro-S-triazine (cyanuric chloride) in water at typically pH 3 to 7 and typically 5 to 40°C for typically 2 to 12 hours to obtain a first condensate. Next, typically 0.95 to 1.1 mol of an aniline or a naphthylamine corresponding to Y is reacted at typically pH 4 to 10 and typically 5 to sec for typically 0.5 to 12 hours to obtain a second condensate. Next, 1 to 50 mol of an alkylene diamine corresponding to E is reacted at typically pH 9 to 12 and typically 5 to 90°C for typically 0.5 to 8 hours to obtain the organic amine of the above formula (4). For pH adjustment in the condensation, typically an alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, an alkali metal carbonate such as sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and the like can be used. In this connection, the sequence order of the condensation is appropriately determined according to the reactivity of each compound and not limited to the above. [0064]<br>
In addition, the copper porphyrazine coloring matters represented by the above formulas (1) and (2) are synthesized by reacting a copper chlorosulfonylporphyrazine compound represented by the above formula (3) with the organic amine represented by the above formula (4) in the presence of ammonia (or in the presence of an aminating agent), and therefore it can be considered theoretically that some chlorosulfonyl-POR of the formula (3) is hydrolyzed by water mixed in the reaction system and produced a compound converted into sulfonic acid as a by-product, which is thus mixed in the intended coloring matters of the formulas (1) and (2). It is,<br><br>
however, difficult to distinguish unsubstituted sulfamoyi groups from sulfonic acid groups in mass spectrometric analysis, so in the present invention, chlorosulfonyl groups in formula (3) except for chlorosulfonyl groups reacted with organic amine represented by the formula (4) are all described as converted into unsubstituted sulfamoyi groups. [0065]<br>
In addition, in some of the copper porphyrazine coloring matter represented by the above formulas (1) and  (2),  impurities are by-produced  in which  copper porphyrazine ring (Pz) forms a dimer (for example, Pz-L-Pz) or a trimer via a divalent linking group (L), which may be mixed into the reaction product. [0066]<br>
The divalent linking group represented by the above L includes -SO2-, -SO2-NH-SO2- and the like, and a by-product where these two Ls are combined may be formed in the case of a trimer.<br>
In addition, optionally by-produced are copper tetrakis(2,3-pyrido)porphyrazine and copper phthalocyanine(copper tetra benzoporphyrazine) having an unsubstituted sulfonamide group and a substituted sulfonamide group in the formula (1) of the present invention which are from copper tetrakis(2,3-pyrido)porphyrazine and copper phthalocyanine (copper tetra benzoporphyrazine ) which are described above to be produced in a small amount in the above synthesis of copper porphyrazine.<br>
These by-products including copper tetrakis(2,3-pyrido)porphyrazine which is by-produced in a small amount in synthesis of copper porphyrazine are about within 35% at most, typically within 30% and preferably within 15% to the whole synthetic coloring matter. These by-products are all coloring matters and also referred to as by-produced coloring matter in the present description. Among these by-produced coloring matters, for example, copper phthalocyanine (copper tetra benzoporphyrazine) having an unsubstituted sulfonamide group and a substituted sulfonamide group in the formula (1) of the present invention is within the range of 0 to 35% at most, typically within 0 to 30%. In addition, another by-produced coloring<br><br>
matter may be contained in an amount of about 0 to 15%, wjiiie the rest is copper porphyrazine coloring matter represented by the formula (1) in the present invention.<br>
Therefore, the coloring matter of the present Invention is obtained typically as a mixture of coloring matters containing 65% to 100%, more preferably 85% to 100% and optionally 85 to 99% of the copper porphyrazine coloring matter of the formula (1) and 0 to 35%, more preferably 0 to 15% and optionally 1 to 15% of by-produced coloring matters. [0067]<br>
The copper porphyrazine coloring matter of the present invention thus obtained can be separated by filtration and the like after adding out or salting out. Salting out is preferably carried out, for example, under acidic to alkali conditions, preferably in the range of pH 1 to 11. The temperature in salting out is not particularly limited, but it is preferred to heat typically to 40 to 80°C, preferably 50 to 70°C, and then add a sodium chloride and the like for salting out. [0068]<br>
The copper porphyrazine coloring matters represented by the above formula (1) and the formula (2) synthesized by the above method is obtained in free acid form or a salt form thereof. Its free acid form can be obtained, for example, by adding out. On the other hand, its salt form can be obtained by salting out; or if the desired salt cannot be obtained by salting out, for example, by utilizing a typical salt exchange method of adding a desired organic or inorganic base to its free acid form.<br>
A preferable porphyrazine coloring matter represented by the formula (1) or (2) of the present invention is one where 1 to 3, preferably 1 to 2 out of A to D are pyridine rings or pyrazine rings (more preferably pyridine rings); the sum of b and c is 2 to 3, c is 0.1 to 2.5 and the rest is b (more preferably ,the sum of b and c is 3, c is 1 to 2.5 and b is 0.5 to 2); X is a sulfoanilino group or a sulfonaphthyl group (more preferably a sulfoanilino group), and these may be further substituted by 1 to 2 groups selected from the group consisting of a sulfo group and a carboxy group; and Y is an anilino group substituted by 1 to 2 groups selected from the group consisting of a<br><br>
sulfo group and a carboxy group (more preferably a sulfoanilino group). A combination of a more preferable one among these and another, particularly a combination of 2 or 3 kinds of more preferable ones, is more preferable.<br>
The porphyrazine coloring matter represented by the formula (1) of the present invention can be mixed with a conventional phthalocyanine coloring matter for use. In that case, the porphyrazine coloring matter of the present invention is 50 to 100%, preferably 70 to 100% and more preferably 90 to 100%) and a conventional phthalocyanine coloring matter is 0 to 50%), preferably 0 to 30%) and more preferably about 0 to 10%.. As the conventional phthalocyanine coloring matter, any of the phthalocyanine coloring matters described in Background Art can be used. [0069]<br>
Next, the ink of the present invention will be explained.<br>
The porphyrazine coloring matter of the above formula (1) or the salt thereof which is produced by the above method exhibits vivid cyan.
