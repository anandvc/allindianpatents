				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of tiles and slabs from waste slag of foundry Cupola .<br>
Cupola slag is a waste generated from fire-clay lined Cupola furnaces during production of iron castings. Large quantity of Cupola furnace slags to the tune of 0.25 million tonnes per year is generated in India and it does not find any use at present, on the contrary to blast furnace slag which is extensively utilised primarily for cement production. With increasing demand and production of iron castings year after year, there is going to be further increase in generation of this waste slag. In our copend-ing application no. 1728/del/94, we have described and claimed a process of production of glazing material from foundry cupola slag.<br>
The slag after being separated out from Cupola furnaces is transported and dumped outside foundry areas. This not only occupies important land space but more important adds to the solid waste pollution around foundries. Lack of availability of dumping sites nearby foundries due to fast urbanisation has necessitated transportation to far away places which has enhanced cost of handling this waste material while pollution problem remains as such. Main constituents of the Cupola slag are generally found in the following ranges :<br>
SiO      40 - 60 %<br>
2 Al O     10 - 20 %<br>
2 3 Fe O      2 - 5  %<br>
2 3<br>
CaO      10 - 30 % Others   1-5  %<br>
Fire clay lined cupola slag with cement binder is being attempted for tiles and slabs for the first time and hence there is no prior art to this.<br>
Against this background, efforts were initiated for fruitful utilisation of this industrial waste product which has hitherto not been exploited to its fullest potential. The slag was found to hold a good promise for being utilised for making some value added products for building application viz. tiles and slabs for wall, floor, platform, facade, roof etc.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of tiles and slabs from waste slag of foundry<br>
Cupola for useful purpose, in building construction for various applications.<br>
The tiles and slabs prepared by this process of this invention are useful for floor and wall tiles and slabs used in building construction. The slabs and tiles thus prepared from waste slag of foundry cupola using cement binder have adequate strength, good finish, wear resistance, appeal.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of tiles and slabs from waste slag of foundry cupola which comprises; heating cupola slag to 105G-1150°C and furnace cooling,<br>
crushing and grinding the cupola slag, sieving to give a fineness in the range of 105 to 210 microns particle size, mixing pulverised slag with cement binders such as porlland cement in the range of 10 to 40%, mixing water to form a semi solid mixture, pouring in the moulds and applying to a pressure of 15-150 kg/cm2 to form the tiles and slabs, removing resultant product, drying for 20 to 24 hours, curing in water for a period of 3 to 28 days, finally polishing if required.<br>
Slag lumps collected from the dumps are crushed and subjected to grinding. Before crushing and grinding slag can also be heated between 1050°C to 1150°C and cooled in furnace for improved properties of toughness and wear. The ground slag is passed through sieve and the powder collected under this sieve size is used for processing. Powder can be as fine as 105 micron or as coarse as 210 micron depending upon suitability. The fine powder is bended with cement binders such as ordinary portland cement in suitable proportion (10 to 40%) and water is added to this blend followed by thorough mixing to make a semi solid mixture. The mix is poured in the moulds of different size and pressed at a pressure of 15 to 150 kg/cm2 for casting tiles and slabs. The cast product is ejected out of the mould and subjected to curing in water for 3-28 days after air drying for 24 hours. The tile and slab so obtained can be polished to give very fine finish and appeal, if required. The cement binders can be grey or white and pigments can also be added to bring desired colours and shades.<br>
The tiles prepared according to the process of the invention when tested show adequate strength and low moisture absorption, wear resistance within prescribed limits.<br>
The present invention is illustrated with the help of the following examples which should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE i<br>
Cupola slag having a composition : Sio2  66% ,  Al2O3   18%,<br>
Fe2O3  4%  ,  CaO 11% , MgO 1% was heated to  1050 C  ,  furnace cooled, ground to a fineness passing through 150 B.S. sieve. The ground slag was mixed with Portland cement of standard quality in the ratio of 70:30 by weight. Water is added to the mixture<br>
followed by thorough mixing to make a semi dry mass which is<br>
poured in a mould of 10 cm X 10 cm and pressed at  25 kg/cm2<br>
pressure for few minutes. The tile of 12mm thickness so formed is removed and air dried for 24 hours and then cured in water for 10 days. Water absorption and dry transverse strength as per IS<br>
1237-1980  for  cement concrete flooring tiles were found to  be<br>
9.9% and 30kg/cm2 respectively.<br>
Example 2<br>
Cupola slag having a composition : SiO2   55.5%,  Al2O3   13%,<br>
Fe2O3   6%, CaO  25%, MgO 0.5%  was  ground to a fineness passing<br>
through 210 micron. The ground slag was mixed with Portland cement of standard quality in the ratio of 60:40 by weight. Water is added to the mixture followed by thorough mixing to make a<br>
semi  dry mass which is poured in a mould of 10 cm X 10  cm and pressed at 150 kg/cm2 pressure for few minutes. The tile of  12mm<br>
thickness so formed is removed and air dried for 24 hours and then cured in water for 28 days. Water absorption and dry trans-<br>
verse strength as per IS  1237-1980 for cement concrete flooring<br>
tiles were found to be 9.8% and 32 kg/cm2 respectively. Wear  on<br>
the tile was 2mm.<br>
The main advantages of the process of the present invention are :<br>
1.	The process relates to exploitation of a hitherto usefully<br>
unutilised  industrial waste posing disposal  and environmental<br>
pollution problem for preparing value added products useful  in<br>
building application.<br>
2.	Total amount of the waste slag is processed without rejecting<br>
any fraction of it.<br>
3.	The process leads to formation of newnew products which, can  be<br>
used  as floor and wall tiles and slabs for platforms  in  houses,<br>
and laboratories.<br>
4.	The cement binders employed in the process  are commercially<br>
available  at a reasonably low cost.<br>
5.	The process is simple and does not involve use of either  very<br>
high temperatures or expensive raw materials.<br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A process for the preparation of tiles and slabs from waste slag of<br>
foundry cupola which comprises; heating cupola slag to 1050-1150°C<br>
and furnace cooling, crushing and grinding the cupola slag, sieving to<br>
give a fineness in the range of 105 to 210 microns particle size,<br>
mixing pulverised slag with cement binders such as portland cement<br>
in the range of 10 to 40%, mixing water to form a semi solid mixture,<br>
pouring in the moulds and applying to a pressure of 15-150 kg/cm2 to<br>
form the tiles and slabs, removing resultant product, drying for 20 to<br>
24 hours, curing in water for a period of 3    to 28 days, finally<br>
polishing if required.<br>
2.	A process for the preparation of tiles and slabs from waste slag of<br>
foundry  cupola  substantially  herein  described  with  reference  to<br>
examples.<br></td>
