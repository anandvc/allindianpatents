				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR A SYNCHRONIZATION CHANNEL<br>
IN AN OFDMA SYSTEM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to wireless communication systems,<br>
and more particularly relates to a method and apparatus for a synchronization<br>
channel in an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a wireless communication system which includes a number of base<br>
stations or cells, an initial task for a wireless communication device is to recognize<br>
and acquire the signals transmitted from the cells. Another primary task is to<br>
search the cells to determine which cell is the best for establishing communication<br>
with. As more and more complex signaling systems are developed, these<br>
important tasks become more difficult and more tirne-consuming. Recently,<br>
orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) signaling systems have<br>
been proposed. The OFDMA systems are scalable bandwidth systems designed to<br>
work in different bandwidths. In addition, the OFDMA systems utilize a multi-<br>
carrier modulation approach having, perhaps, hundreds of subcarriers within a<br>
narrow (e.g., 5 MHz) frequency range. While the scalability of OFDMA systems<br>
facilitates the introduction and expansion of such systems, the complexity of<br>
OFDMA systems must nevertheless allow for signal acquisition by OFDMA<br>
wireless communication devices in a timely manner for quick activation and<br>
seamless transition from cell to cell. A synchronization channel is provided for<br>
initial signal acquisition and cell search. However, as the number of cell sites<br>
increases and the complexity of the OFDMA systems increase, the synchronization<br>
channel signal must include more and more information. Parsing the signal into<br>
sequence elements for quick and reliable reception alleviates some of the problem,<br>
but the sequence elements must themselves each carry sequence index information.<br>
Thus, what is needed is a method and apparatus for generating and<br>
processing an improved synchronization channel including a plurality of sequence<br>
elements in an ODFMA system. Furthermore, other desirable features and<br><br>
characteristics of the present invention will become apparent from the subsequent<br>
detailed description of the invention and the appended claims, taken in conjunction<br>
with the accompanying drawings and this background of the invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a method in a<br>
wireless communication system includes the step of transmitting an orthogonal<br>
frequency domain multiple access (OFDMA) signal including a synchronization<br>
channel signal transmitted within a localized portion of a bandwidth of the<br>
OFDMA signal, the synchronization channel signal having predetermined time<br>
domain symmetry within the localized portion of bandwidth and including<br>
information for providing at least partial cell identification information. In<br>
addition, a method in a wireless communication system in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the present invention includes the step of transmitting an OFDMA<br>
signal including a synchronization channel signal, the synchronization channel<br>
signal including a plurality of synchronization channel signal sequence elements<br>
and the OFDMA signal including a plurality of subcarriers and a plurality of<br>
OFDMA symbol periods, wherein the plurality of synchronization channel signal<br>
sequence elements are distributed among either or both of the plurality of<br>
subcarriers and a plurality of time intervals such as the plurality of OFDMA<br>
symbols periods.<br>
Also, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a method<br>
for receiving OFDMA signals includes the steps of isolating a portion of a<br>
bandwidth of the OFDMA signals which includes a synchronization channel<br>
signal, detecting a position of the synchronization channel within the portion of the<br>
bandwidth of the OFDMA signals, and decoding the synchronization channel<br>
signal to derive at least partial cell identification information therefrom.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, an orthogonal frequency division multiple access<br>
(OFDMA) wireless communication system 100 in accordance with an embodiment<br><br>
of the present invention includes a plurality of base stations 110 and a wireless<br>
communication device 120. The plurality of base {stations 110 communicate with<br>
the wireless communication device 120 via OFDMA radio frequency (RF) signals<br>
on a plurality of subcarriers for wireless communications. Associated with each of<br>
the plurality of base stations 110 is a coverage area 125 wherein the wireless<br>
communication device 120 can receive OFDMA signals from and transmit signals<br>
to one or more of the plurality of base stations 110. The wireless communication<br>
device 120 will typically receive signaling and other messaging from a base station<br>
having the strongest signal strength, or otherwise some preferable signal<br>
characteristics such that the particular base station 110 is the "best server" to the<br>
particular wireless communication device 120. The plurality of base stations 110<br>
are coupled to a network system controller 130 for centralized control of the<br>
OFDMA wireless communication system.<br>
An OFDMA wireless communication system is a multi-carrier modulation<br>
scheme which has been proposed as a next generation solution for present wide-<br>
area code division multiple access (WCDMA) wireless communication systems.<br>
OFDMA is a more general case of an orthogonal frequency domain multiplexing<br>
(OFDM) system wherein data for different users can be transmitted simultaneously<br>
on different subcarriers. OFDMA wireless communication systems have a large<br>
number of subcarriers, wherein a subcarrier only occupies a small fraction of the<br>
OFDMA channel bandwidth (e.g., fifteen kilohertz (kHz) per subcarrier in a five<br>
megahertz (MHz) OFDMA channel bandwidth). Thus, for example, in a five MHz<br>
range, there could be approximately three hundred subcarriers. OFDMA system<br>
design provides a highly scaleable, multiple system bandwidth solution because, as<br>
OFDMA systems are designed to work in different bandwidths, more subcarriers<br>
can be added as needed. In addition, the OFDMA system design being<br>
contemplated for next-generation evolution of the WCDMA system supports both<br>
a synchronized system and an unsynchronized system and allows for a large<br>
number base station identifiers (cell index) and OFDMA symbol structures with<br>
both short and long cyclic prefix lengths.<br>
An OFDMA system in accordance with the embodiment of the present<br>
invention defines a synchronization channel which significantly reduces the time<br><br>
required for a wireless communication device 120 to synchronize to the OFDMA<br>
system by acquiring the OFDMA system timing simultaneous with identifying the<br>
strongest base station 110, or "best server" as described above, for establishing<br>
communication therewith (i.e., the initial acquisition and cell search time). The<br>
OFDMA initial acquisition and cell search process should detect an OFDMA<br>
symbol timing, a frame boundary and a frequency error as well as detect cell<br>
specific information such as an identification of the base station 110 and, if<br>
necessary, other cell specific information such as the system bandwidth, the<br>
number of transmission antennas on the base station 110 or a cyclic prefix length.<br>
The synchronization signal in accordance with the embodiment of the present<br>
invention includes at least partial cell (i.e., base station) identification information.<br>
The cell identification information of the synchronization channel could be partial<br>
cell identification information identifying a group of individual base stations 110<br>
(e.g., cell group identification information) or could be full cell identification<br>
information identifying a unique base station 110, and may further provide sector<br>
identification information in embodiments in which base stations 110 are<br>
partitioned by antenna coverage patterns and resource allocation into multiple<br>
sectors.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, an exemplary OFDMA frame structure depicts a single<br>
OFDMA frame 200 of ten milliseconds transmission time comprising one hundred<br>
and forty OFDMA symbols. The frame 200 includes twenty sub-frames 210, 220,<br>
where the first sub-frame 210 is the synchronization channel occupying a seven<br>
OFDMA symbol sub-frame 210 where the seven OFDMA symbols 230 form a<br>
short cyclic prefix (CP) sub-frame. The remaining nineteen sub-frames 240 can<br>
either be a long CP sub-frame having six OFDMA symbols 240 or a short CP sub-<br>
frame having seven OFDMA symbols 230. While the example in FIG. 2 depicts<br>
the synchronization channel in a first sub-frame 210 having a short cyclic prefix,<br>
location of the synchronization channel and the cyclic prefix thereof can be defined<br>
in any manner or location to accommodate the OFDMA system design. By<br>
locating the synchronization channel in the first sub-frame 230 (as shown) or the<br>
last sub-frame in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the frame boundary is defined by the synchronization channel.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 3, an OFDMA frame structure in accordance with an<br>
alternate embodiment of the present invention is depicted. In accordance with this<br>
alternate embodiment, the synchronization channel 310 is assigned to the end of<br>
more than one of the twenty sub-frames 320 in order to detect the synchronization<br>
channel 310 regardless of the CP length. The synchronization channel 310 is<br>
transmitted every N sub-frame 320 in order to reduce the initial acquisition and cell<br>
search time and memory size of initial acquisition in unsynchronized OFMDA<br>
systems, where N is an aliquot of twenty. It will be recognized by those skilled in<br>
the art that the system parameters of the sub-frames, the length and number of<br>
symbols of the OFDMA system frame and other frame structure parameters may<br>
be modified in accordance with a plurality of system designs, and the frame<br>
structure of an OFDMA system in accordance with the present invention is not<br>
restricted to the embodiments of FIG. 2 or FIG. 3.<br>
The synchronization channel, in accordance with an embodiment of the<br>
present invention, is transmitted within a localized portion of the bandwidth of the<br>
OFDMA signal, e.g., the center 1.25 MHz bandwidth of the OFDMA signal,<br>
regardless of the system bandwidth, thereby reducing the initial acquisition and<br>
cell search time while preserving the scalability of the OFDMA wireless<br>
communication system. Referring to FIG. 4, predetermined resource blocks 410<br>
are predefined frequency bands. While it is recognized that any frequency band<br>
can be defined for the resource blocks, in accordance with one embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the resource block (RB) size is 0.375 MHz and the<br>
synchronization channel 420 is generally defined to be 1.5 MHz, thus occupying<br>
four resource blocks 410. Subcarrier symbols in system bandwidth except for the<br>
center resource blocks 410 occupied by the synchronization channel 420 are<br>
utilized for other channels. In another embodiment, the bandwidth of the<br>
synchronization channel is related to the OFDMA signal bandwidth. Some<br>
examples of this are OFDMA system bandwidths 430, 440, 450,460, 480.<br>
In a twenty megahertz OFDMA system 430 (having forty-eight resource<br>
blocks 410) and a ten megahertz OFDMA system 440 (having twenty-four<br>
resource blocks 410), the synchronization channel 420 uses the central twelve<br>
resource blocks 410. In a five megahertz OFDMA system 450 (having twelve-<br><br>
resource blocks 410), the synchronization channel 420 uses all twelve resource<br>
blocks 410. In a 2.5 MHz OFDMA system 460 (having six resource blocks 410),<br>
the synchronization channel 420 uses only the central four resource blocks 410.<br>
Utilizing the symmetry of the synchronization channel 420, the spectrum 470 of<br>
the synchronization channel 420 covers the central portion of the four resource<br>
locks 410 of the synchronization channel 420. Unused subcarriers on either side of<br>
the synchronization channel spectrum 470 can be used for guard bands or data<br>
(e.g., low rate channels such as acknowledgements of received uplink traffic, or<br>
other data streams/channels).<br>
In another embodiment where the bandwidth of the synchronization<br>
channel is related to the OFDMA signal bandwidth, the synchronization channel<br>
signal may be repeated in the frequency dimension to further improve<br>
performance. For example, the synchronization channel signal information may be<br>
contained in the central four resource blocks. Then, each additional set of four<br>
resource blocks that are within the synchronization channel bandwidth may contain<br>
another transmission or repetition of the synchronization channel signal contained<br>
in the central four resource blocks.<br>
In addition to the partial or full cell identification information or the<br>
repetition or transmission of the synchronization channel signal, for five megahertz<br>
or larger bandwidth OFDMA systems, the synchronization channel 420 can use<br>
frequency bands other than the center four resource blocks to enhance cell search<br>
performance. For example, all or a portion of additional cell specific information<br>
such as frequency reference information, transmission antenna information, pilot<br>
stream information or cyclic prefix (CP) length information could be included in<br>
the synchronization channel 420 information. In addition, the OFDMA system<br>
could be designed to redundantly transmit the synchronization channel on two or<br>
more of a plurality of subcarriers the portion of bandwidth occupied by the<br>
synchronization channel 420.<br>
For the case where the OFDMA system bandwidth is 1.25 MHz 480, only<br>
three resource blocks 410 can be accommodated and the synchronization channel<br>
420 uses all three resource blocks 410. While a number of variations of OFDMA<br>
system bandwidth have been shown, other structures are possible wherein the<br><br>
synchronization channel is transmitted in a localized portion of the OFDMA<br>
system bandwidth.<br>
FIG. 5 depicts a five megahertz OFDMA communication system signal<br>
bandwidth where the localized synchronization channel bandwidth 510 is located<br>
in the center 1.25 MHz of the five megahertz bandwidth and within, but smaller<br>
than a bandwidth spanned by a multiple number of resource blocks 520. Tn this<br>
instance, the synchronization channel bandwidth 510 does not cover a multiple of<br>
the resource block size 520. In accordance with the embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a data signal 530 is transmitted simultaneously with the synchronization<br>
channel in a portion of the bandwidth spanned by an integer number of resource<br>
blocks 520 that is not utilized by the synchronization channel 510. For improved<br>
detection of the data signal 530, it may be separated from the synchronization<br>
channel by bandwidths where no information is transmitted called guard bands<br>
540.<br>
The synchronization channel signal is a sequence divided into<br>
synchronization channel signal sequence elements. An example of a preferred<br>
sequence type in accordance with the present invention is a generalized chirp like<br>
(GCL) sequence. For example, a length-NG GCL sequence of "index" u which is<br>
defined as<br><br>
where b is a complex scalar of unit amplitude and<br><br>
and NG is a prime number (i.e., NG=NGX1) is particularly suitable for a sequence<br>
divided into synchronization channel signal sequence elements in accordance with<br>
the present invention. Where NG is a prime number., the cross-correlation between<br>
any two sequences of distinct "class" is optimal and there will NG-1 unique<br>
sequences in the set that can be used as unique group identifiers or unique cell<br>
identification information. The GCL sequence can be represented more simply<br>
and compactly by choosing 6=1 and q = 0.<br>
Additional examples of sequence types that can be used for the<br>
synchronization channel sequence elements in accordance with the present<br><br>
invention may include a Pseudo-random Noise (PN) sequence or a maximal length<br>
binary sequence. When a structured sequence with limited choices of sequence<br>
length, (such as GCL or maximal-length binary) is used, the number of elements in<br>
the original sequence may not match size of the synchronization channel. In this<br>
case, the sequence may be modified to fit within the resources available for the<br>
synchronization channel signal sequence (e.g., by truncation or cyclic extension<br>
thereof). In accordance with another aspect of the embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the synchronization signal includes a plurality of synchronization<br>
channel signal sequence elements that are distributed over the OFDMA signal<br>
subcarriers and/or the OFDMA symbol periods as determined by the OFDMA<br>
system design or by signal propagation conditions that the system is expected to<br>
operate in.<br>
FIG. 6, comprising FIGs. 6A, 6B and 6C, depicts frame structures for<br>
synchronization channel sequence element assignment in accordance with the<br>
present invention wherein the synchronization channel sequence elements are<br>
distributed over frequency (the subcarriers) first and then over time. The present<br>
invention, however, is not limited to this synchronization channel sequence<br>
element assignment scheme and may alternatively distribute the synchronization<br>
channel sequence elements over time first and then frequency if, for example, the<br>
system design allows changes in time faster than in frequency. Referring to FIG.<br>
6A, the synchronization channel signal is transmitted over a sub-frame 610 with a<br>
frame structure of seven OFDMA symbols, wherein the synchronization channel<br>
sequence elements are transmitted on a plurality of subcarriers in adjacent or<br>
proximal OFDMA symbol periods. While not shown, in some embodiment's pilot<br>
symbols or other symbols such as control symbols may occupy part or all of one or<br>
more of the OFDMA symbol periods in sub-frame 610, such that the time spacing<br>
between some of the aforementioned proximal OFDMA symbol periods may be<br>
more than one OFDMA symbol period.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a first OFDMA symbol period<br>
620 includes a common GCL sequence of modulation symbols or zeros forming<br>
thirty-eight sequence elements mapped onto thirty-eight subcarriers, the GCL<br>
sequence in the first OFDMA symbol period 620 being common for all of the base<br><br>
stations 110 in the OFDMA wireless communication system 100. By using every<br>
other sub-carrier (e.g., even numbered subcarriers) for this common GCL sequence<br>
620, the waveform can have a predetermined time domain symmetry. This<br>
common GCL sequence 620 may be present in. all synchronization channel<br>
transmissions and may be located in the first OFDMA symbol period of the sub-<br>
frame 610, thereby utilized as a frame boundary indicator. Referring to FTG. 7, an<br>
example of the sub-carrier mapping of the synchronization channel signal in the<br>
first OFDMA symbol period 620 is shown where modulated symbols are mapped<br>
to every other subcarrier (the thirty-eight occupied subcarriers 702) with the<br>
intervening subcarriers 704 having zeros or nuE sets mapped thereto. The<br>
modulation symbols are mapped to even numbered subcarriers in order to create or<br>
define the symmetry of the waveform in the time domain (i.e., the predetermined<br>
time domain symmetry of the synchronization channel signal waveform). This<br>
symmetry characteristic can be utilized for coarse OFDMA symbol timing<br>
detection and frequency error detection.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 6A, the subsequent six OFDMA symbol periods<br>
630 include the GCL sequence unique to a group of cells or base stations, or<br>
unique to the cell or base station 110 (depending on the embodiment) as a plurality<br>
of synchronization channel sequence elements mapped onto a plurality of<br>
subcarriers, each OFDMA symbol period having all seventy-five subcarriers used<br>
for the GCL synchronization channel sequence elements and filling the six<br>
OFDMA symbol periods 630 in a "zig-zag" fashion. For example, FIG. 6A<br>
depicts the synchronization channel signal GCL sequence including 449<br>
synchronization channel sequence elements. The second OFDMA symbol period<br>
630 is filled with synchronization channel signal sequence elements (phases) 0 to<br>
74 ordered from top to bottom. The third OFDMA symbol period 630 is filled<br>
with synchronization channel signal sequence elements 75 to 149 ordered from<br>
bottom to top, but in an alternate embodiment could also be ordered from top to<br>
bottom. In a like manner, the remaining OFDMA symbol periods 630 are filled<br>
with the remaining synchronization channel signal sequence elements, with the<br>
sixth OFDMA symbol being filled with synchronization channel signal sequence<br>
elements (phases) 375 to 449 ordered from bottom to top. Instead of filling the<br><br>
OFDMA symbol periods of the synchronization channel in a "zig-zag" fashion, the<br>
OFDMA symbol periods 630 could all be filled from top to bottom or vice versa in<br>
accordance with the OFDMA system design, the sequence type and/or the<br>
processing necessary to combine the synchronization channel sequence elements.<br>
In addition, instead of filling the synchronization channel in a frequency-first<br>
fashion, the OFDMA symbol periods 630 could be filled in a time-first fashion<br>
(e.g., from left to right on each subcarrier, right to left on each subcarrier, or left to<br>
right on some subcarriers and right to left on other subcarriers). Or, instead of the<br>
above described filling methods, any arbitrary two-dimensional filling pattern<br>
could be used.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6B, a synchronization channel signal unique to a cell or<br>
base station 110 or a group of cells (e.g., a GCL sequence common to multiple<br>
cells) is also transmitted over a sub-frame 610 with a frame structure of seven<br>
OFDMA symbols, wherein the synchronization channel sequence elements are<br>
transmitted on a plurality of subcarriers in adjacent or proximal OFDMA symbol<br>
periods. In accordance with this embodiment of the present invention, the first<br>
OFDMA symbol period 620 includes zeros mapped onto 37 subcarriers and<br>
elements of a cell-specific or group-specific GCL sequence forming thirty-eight<br>
sequence elements mapped onto thirty-eight subcarriers, for one or a group of the<br>
base stations 110 in the OFDMA wireless communication system 100. The<br>
subsequent six OFDMA symbol periods 630 include additional elements of the<br>
cell-specific GCL sequence mapped onto a plurality of subcarriers, each OFDMA<br>
symbol period having all seventy-five subcarriers (phases), filling the six OFDMA<br>
symbol periods 630 in the "zig-zag" fashion. FIG. 6B depicts the synchronization<br>
channel signal GCL sequence including 487 synchronization channel sequence<br>
elements. The second OFDMA symbol period 630 is filled with synchronization<br>
channel signal sequence elements (phases) 38 to 112 ordered from bottom to top.<br>
The third OFDMA symbol period 630 is filled with synchronization channel signal<br>
sequence elements 113 to 187 ordered from top to bottom. In a like manner, the<br>
remaining OFDMA symbol periods 630 are filled with the remaining<br>
synchronization channel signal sequence elements, with the sixth OFDMA symbol<br><br>
being filled with synchronization channel signal sequence elements (phases) 413 to<br>
487 ordered from top to bottom.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6C, another alternate structure of a synchronization<br>
channel sequence assignment is shown. In accordance with the present invention,<br>
the synchronization channel sequence elements may be distributed over the<br>
OFDMA symbol periods (as shown in FTG. 6A) or may be distributed over more<br>
than one of the plurality of subcarriers of the OFDMA signal, or a combination of<br>
both distributions. In the alternate embodiment of FIG. 6C, there are ten<br>
synchronization channel symbol periods in the frame structure 640. In order to<br>
accommodate a longer common GCJL sequence (e.g., longer than thirty-eight<br>
sequence elements), a first portion 650 of the synchronization channel includes two<br>
OFDMA symbol periods 660, 670. The first OFDMA symbol period 660 may be<br>
used as a frame boundary indicator. In accordance with the alternate embodiment<br>
of the present invention, the synchronization channel sequence elements are<br>
mapped to every second sub-frame such that the first synchronization channels<br>
650, which includes seventy-five subcarriers, is mapped to the first OFDMA<br>
symbol period 660 and the second OFDMA symbol period 670. Each of the<br>
OFDMA symbol periods 660, 670 with the common GCL sequence includes<br>
thirty-eight sub-carriers, where the use of even numbered sub-carriers maintains<br>
the predetermined time domain symmetry of the synchronization channel as shown<br>
in FIG. 7 and discussed above.<br>
Channel conditions could change during a gap between the sub-frames. To<br>
accommodate the differential processing of the synchronization channel sequence<br>
elements, the subsequent OFDMA symbol period 670 may repeat, as shown in<br>
FIG. 6C, the last sequence element (e.g., phase 37) of the previous OFDMA<br>
symbol period 620. Following the first synchronization channels 660, the second<br>
synchronization channels 680 include eight OFDMA symbol periods having 592<br>
synchronization channel sequence elements mapped to seventy-five subcarriers for<br>
each OFDMA symbol period. The eight OFDMA symbol periods 680 for the<br>
second synchronization channels use every second sub-frame and are filled in a<br>
"zig-zag" fashion (as shown) or any arbitrary two-dimensional filling pattern as<br>
discussed above, repeating the last sequence element of an OFDMA symbol period<br><br>
as the first sequence clement of the next OFDMA symbol period. Accordingly, the<br>
third OFDMA symbol period is filled with synchronization channel signal<br>
sequence elements (phases) 0 to 74 ordered from top to bottom. The fourth<br>
OFDMA symbol period is filled with synchronization channel signal sequence<br>
elements 74 to 148 ordered from bottom to top.<br>
Within each synchronization channel sequence element, GCL sequence<br>
elements may preferably be employed such that differential processing of the GCL<br>
sequence elements will provide determination of the sequence index. GCL<br>
sequence elements have 0 dB peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and optimal<br>
cross correlation properties. If a GCL sequence is applied in the frequency domain<br>
on all subcarriers, the properties still hold for the corresponding time-domain<br>
waveform since the Fourier transform of a GCL sequence is also a GCL sequence.<br>
In addition, if a GCL sequence is passed through a differential demodulator, the<br>
resulting output sequence is a complex exponential with a frequency that<br>
corresponds to the original sequence index. Thus, using GCL sequence elements,<br>
each synchronization channel signal sequence element will have sequence index<br>
properties for inherently determining the sequence index thereof. As mentioned<br>
earlier, other types of sequences could also be used, but it is preferred that the<br>
sequence have properties that enable sequence index detection based on the<br>
differential demodulation of the sequence. One example of a sequence other than<br>
GCL that has such properties is a maximal-length binary sequence, since a<br>
differential demodulation of a maximal-length binary sequence produces a<br>
cyclically shifted version of the same sequence with a predetermined shift value.<br>
Thus, with a maximal-length binary sequence, each cell ID can be associated with<br>
a particular cyclic shift value of the sequence, and the cell ID can be recovered<br>
based on differential processing.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, a block diagram of the OFDMA base station 110<br>
includes a base station controller 810 coupled to the network controller 130 and<br>
controlling the operation of the base station 110. The controller is coupled to<br>
receiver circuitry 812 and transmitter circuitry 814, and may further include a<br>
receiver/transmitter switch 816 for controlling the transmission and reception of<br>
the OFDMA signals over the antenna 818 if communications over the antenna 818<br><br>
arc duplexed. OFDMA signals received by the receiver circuitry 812 arc<br>
demodulated thereby and. provided to the controller 810 for decoding thereof. In<br>
addition, the controller 810 provides signals to the transmitter circuitry 814 for<br>
modulation thereby and transmission therefrom. While a single antenna 818 is<br>
shown, it is to be understood that base stations 110 may be, and are typically,<br>
configured into sectors and may employ multiple antennas for receive diversity,<br>
and/or transmission beamforming applications, space time coding, multiple input<br>
multiple output (MIMO), or other system design transmission signaling schemes.<br>
Therefore, many transmit and receive antenna configuration are possible in various<br>
embodiments and FIG. 8 is not intended to be a complete schematic representation<br>
of such antenna configurations but rather to exemplify components helpful toward<br>
understanding the embodiments disclosed herein. With multiple antennas, it is<br>
useful to convey the number of antennas to the wireless communication devices<br>
120 to know how many pilot streams to search for during initial acquisition and<br>
cell search. Thus, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
additional cell specific information that may be transmitted as part of the<br>
synchronization channel signal may include the number of antennas of the base<br>
station 110 or pilot stream information. The controller 810 is coupled to a storage<br>
device 820 which stores information for the operation of the base station 110 such<br>
as cell identification information and other cell specific information such as<br>
frequency reference information, transmission antenna information (such as the<br>
number of antennas), pilot stream information and cyclic prefix length information.<br>
Tn accordance with the present invention, the controller 810 includes a<br>
synchronization channel generator 822 for generating a synchronization channel<br>
signal having time domain symmetry within a portion of the OFDMA signal<br>
bandwidth and comprising at least partial cell identification information, the<br>
synchronization channel generator 822 providing the synchronization channel<br>
signal to the transmitter circuitry 816 for transmission therefrom. Sometimes the<br>
synchronization channel generator 822 generates a synchronization channel signal<br>
including at least a portion of additional cell specific information. A data signal<br>
generator 824 generates an OFDMA data signal for providing to the transmitter<br>
circuitry 816 for transmission therefrom and, in accordance with one aspect of the<br><br>
present invention wherein the bandwidth is divided into a set of resource blocks,<br>
the data signal is transmitted simultaneously with the synchronization channel<br>
signal on a portion of a bandwidth spanned by an integer number of predetermined<br>
resource blocks when the synchronization channel signal spans a bandwidth<br>
smaller than a bandwidth spanned by the integer number of predetermined resource<br>
blocks. Data could be voice or MBMS transmissions that are generated by a<br>
calling wireless communication device 120 or by a content provider and may be<br>
multiplexed onto the subcarriers and interleaved at the base station 110 or<br>
multiplexing may be performed by the network controller 130. The<br>
synchronization channel generator 822 defines the time domain symmetry of the<br>
synchronization channel signal in one embodiment by mapping modulation signals<br>
and zeros onto a plurality of subcarriers thereof.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, operation of the synchronization channel generator 822<br>
in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention begins by retrieving<br>
information 910 from the storage device 820. At a minimum, this information<br>
includes cell identification information uniquely identifying the base station 110 or<br>
at least partial cell identification information, such as group cell identification<br>
information. Additional cell specific information, as discussed above, could also<br>
be retrieved 910.<br>
Next, the synchronization channel signal is generated 912 by encoding the<br>
cell identification information. The synchronization channel signal is parsed into a<br>
plurality of synchronization channel sequence elements 914. The predetermined<br>
time domain symmetry of the synchronization channel signal is then defined 916.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, step 916 would include providing an<br>
even number of subcarriers in a resource block and may include mapping the<br>
generated synchronization channel signal as modulation symbols and zeros onto a<br>
plurality of subcarriers where the modulation symbols are mapped to every nth<br>
subcarrier of at least a portion of the subcarriers utilized for the synchronization<br>
channel signal, where n is an integer greater than or equal to two.<br>
After the time domain symmetry is defined 916, the synchronization<br>
channel signal is provided 918 to the transmitter circuitry 816 for transmission<br>
from the base station 110. The synchronization channel signal is periodically<br><br>
transmitted from the base station 110 to enable initial acquisition and cell search.<br>
Thus, the synchronization channel signal may, in addition to the foregoing be<br>
provided to the transmitter circuitry 816 redundantly either in time or across<br>
subcarriers for improved initial acquisition and cell search. The redundancy and<br>
the content of the synchronization channel signal can be revised and/or redefined<br>
based upon the bandwidth of the OFDMA signal (i.e., in response to the scaling of<br>
the OFDMA signal bandwidth).<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, a wireless communication device 120 in accordance<br>
with the embodiment of the present invention is shown. The wireless<br>
communication device 120 includes an antenna 1002 for receiving and transmitting<br>
radio frequency (RF) signals. A receive/transmit switch 1004 selectively couples<br>
the antenna 1002 to receiver circuitry 1006 and transmitter circuitry 1008 in a<br>
manner familiar to those skilled in the art. The receiver circuitry 1006<br>
demodulates and decodes the RF signals to derive information therefrom and is<br>
coupled to a controller 1010 for providing the decoded information thereto for<br>
utilization thereby in accordance with the function(s) of the wireless<br>
communication device 120. The controller 1010 also provides information to the<br>
transmitter circuitry 1008 for encoding and modulating information into RF signals<br>
for transmission from the antenna 1002. While a single antenna 1002 is depicted,<br>
those skilled in the art will recognize that diversity antennas could be used with<br>
diversity receivers for improved signal reception.<br>
The controller 1010 is coupled to user interface circuitry 1012 including,<br>
for example, a display for presenting video output to a user, a speaker for<br>
providing audio output to the user, a microphone for receiving voice input, and<br>
user controls, such as a keypad, for receiving user input thereby. The controller<br>
1010 is further coupled to a nonvolatile memory device 1014 for storing<br>
information therein and for retrieving and utilizing information therefrom.<br>
In accordance with the embodiment of the present invention, the receiver<br>
circuitry 1006 includes a synchronization channel signal filter device 1016 for<br>
isolating a portion of the OFDMA signal bandwidth which includes the<br>
synchronization channel signal. The synchronization channel signal filter device<br>
1016 could be a bandpass filter or any other device or process for filtering the<br><br>
OFDMA signal to isolate a localized portion of the OFDMA signal bandwidth.<br>
For example, a fast Fourier transform (FFT) could be utilized to isolate the<br>
localized portion of the OFDMA signal bandwidth during processing instead of a<br>
hardware filter. Once isolated, the signal is provided to the controller for initial<br>
acquisition and cell search processing.<br>
Referring to FTG. 11, the initial signal acquisition and cell search process<br>
begins by examining the signal filtered by the filter 1016 to determine if there is<br>
any signal 1110. When a signal is detected 1110, the initial acquisition and cell<br>
search method is performed in accordance with the present invention. First, the<br>
predetermined time domain symmetry of the synchronization channel signal is<br>
utilized to perform coarse OFDMA symbol timing detection and fractional<br>
frequency offset detection 1112. This step 1112 could be performed by differential<br>
correlation of the received synchronization channel signal being calculated in the<br>
time domain or by correlation calculation with known synchronization channel<br>
signal sequence elements in the time domain.<br>
Generalized chirp like (GCL) sequences are preferably suited to differential<br>
processing in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention. However,<br>
as mentioned previously, the present invention can use other sequence types. The<br>
time domain waveforms of the GCL-modulated OFDM signals have low PAPR,<br>
In addition, because of the use of different indices of the GCL sequences, any pair<br>
of the sequence elements will have low cross correlation at all time lags, which<br>
improves the code detection and CIR estimation. Also, GCL sequences have<br>
constant amplitude, and the NG-point DFT of GCL sequences also have constant<br>
amplitude. GCL sequences of any length additionally have an "ideal" cyclic<br>
autocorrelation (i.e., the correlation with the circularly shifted version of itself is a<br>
delta function). And, the absolute value of the cyclic cross-correlation function<br>
between any two GCL sequences is constant and equal to <br>
u1, and u2 are all relatively prime to NG (a condition that can be easily guaranteed if<br>
NG is a prime number).<br>
The cross-correlation at all lags actually achieves the minimum<br>
cross-correlation value for any two sequence elements that have the ideal<br>
autocorrelation property (meaning that the theoretical minimum of the maximum<br><br>
value of the cross-correlation over all lags is achieved). The minimum is achieved<br>
when the cross correlations at all lags is equal to  The cross correlation<br>
property allows the impact of an interfering signal be evenly spread in the time<br>
domain after correlating the received signal with the desired sequence in the time<br>
domain. Hence, the cell-search symbol can also be used to perform or assist<br>
coherent channel estimation at the wireless device even before the broadcast pilot<br>
symbols are processed. Compared with BPSK or even QPSK preambles, the<br>
complex-valued GCL sequences can be systematically constructed with guaranteed<br>
good PAPR and good correlation.<br>
Differential processing of the GCL sequence elements enables the one step<br>
fast cell search for GCL sequence elements, step 1112. To facilitate differential<br>
processing in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
sequence elements have preferably been generated in accordance with a sequence<br>
design methodology for a sequence length Np where a prime number NG is the<br>
smallest prime number larger than Np. The integer "u" is the sequence index. The<br>
sequence elements were generated according to<br><br>
NG-1 sequence elements are generated having an optimal cyclic cross<br>
correlation between any pair of them. The sequence elements have been truncated<br>
to Np and distributed over Np subcarriers. Due to the oversampling introduced in<br>
OFDMA signaling with null subcarriers, and also the use of localized bandwidth<br>
for the synchronization signal, the PAPR will be degraded to different degrees for<br>
different "u" from the theoretical OdB value (at Nyquist sampling rate). If desired,<br>
indices that have the best PAPR among NG-1 candidates can be chosen. The cell<br>
search sequences used by different cells are obtained from different indices "u" of<br>
these GCL sequence elements. The index "u" will also act as a cell ID.<br>
The cell search 1112 determines directly the sequence indices "u" (and<br>
hence the strongest or candidate cell ID's or group ID's) from the received signal.<br>
First, the coarse OFDMA cell-search symbol timing is determined (e.g., using the<br>
time domain symmetry of the cell-search symbol). Then, the fractional part of the<br>
frequency offset is estimated and removed (e.g., based on the phase of the half-<br><br>
symbol differential correlation, peak). After these steps, a block of N received time-<br>
domain samples representing the received cell-search symbol is transformed to the<br>
frequency domain using the usual FFT process.<br>
Assuming that an integer frequency offset may still be present, the<br>
occupied subcarriers (even vs. odd) can be determined next by various techniques<br>
such as a maximum energy detector (e.g., total energy in the even subcarriers of<br>
the cell-search symbol vs. energy in the odd subcarriers). The frequency domain<br>
data on the occupied subcarriers as Y(m) for m = 1 to Np (i.e., ignoring the unused<br>
subcarriers) is denoted where Su(m) is the GCL sequence mapped onto those<br>
subcarriers.<br>
Next, a vector of "differential-based" values is computed based on the pairs<br>
of occupied subcarriers. These values, which are obtained by differentially<br>
demodulating the occupied subcarriers of the received symbol, are conveniently<br>
collected into vector format (e.g., a differential-based vector) for efficient FFT-<br>
based processing. The differential-based vector is computed as<br><br>
where "O " denotes conjugation. Other ways to obtain the "differential-based"<br>
vector may include, but are not limited to:<br><br>
or<br><br>
where "abs( )" denotes the absolute value.<br>
Assuming that there is only one base station, and that it is transmitting a<br>
cell-search symbol with a GCL sequence index of u, and that the channel does not<br>
change significantly between two adjacent occupied subcarriers, which is<br>
approximately satisfied as long as the spacing of occupied subcarriers is not too<br>
large, ignoring the channel amplitude and frequency offset, Y(m)* Y*(m+1) is<br>
approximately equal to<br><br><br><br>
Thus, the sequence index information u is carried in the differential-based<br>
vector. In the multi-cell case, by processing the differential-based vector and<br>
identifying a set of prominent frequency components of the vector, we can identify<br>
the strongest cell index and one or more indices of potential handoff candidates as<br>
well. To obtain the frequency domain components, a commonly used tool is to<br>
take an FFT or IFFT (say T-point, T&gt;=NP-1) on {Z(m)} (step 1114) to get<br><br>
The peak position (say nmax) of {z(n)} gives information about the strongest<br>
cell's index u, i.e., the mapping between the identified prominent frequency<br>
component at nmax to a corresponding transmitted sequence index is determined as<br><br>
The peak values are also rough estimates of the channel power at the<br>
occupied subcarriers. Thus, IFFT of the synchronization channel signal in the<br>
frequency domain is used to detect the frame boundary and decode the cell<br>
identification information 1114. Thus, utilizing the sequence index properties of<br>
the synchronization channel sequence elements, multiplying one sequence element<br>
by the complex conjugate of a next sequence element will derive the sequence<br>
index u 1114. Accordingly, in a single step, the controller 1010 can perform GCL<br>
sequence index detect to extract the cell specific information (e.g., u) from the<br>
synchronization channel signal. When the synchronization channel signal is<br>
determined to be, in some embodiments, the strongest synchronization channel<br>
signal 1116, wireless OFDMA communication is established with the base station<br>
1118.<br>
Note that for the purpose of explanation, the above equations were<br>
described for the case of the GCL sequence elements being mapped to different<br>
subcarriers of one OFDMA symbol period. However, the proposed detection<br>
method can also be applied when the sequence is mapped in other ways, such as<br>
"zig-zag". In general, the differential demodulation step can be performed over<br>
adjacent sequence elements even if the adjacent sequence elements are mapped to<br>
different OFMDA symbol periods and/or different subcarriers. In addition, the<br>
differential processing from multiple received instances of the synchronization<br>
channel can be combined to further improve the detection robustness. Multiple<br><br>
received instances of the synchronization channel may be available due to either<br>
receive diversity with multiple antennas, or from subsequently received<br>
synchronization signals that are transmitted periodically by the base station, for<br>
example.<br>
As described for some embodiments of the invention, the time domain<br>
symmetry of the synchronization signal can be provided by mapping modulation<br>
symbols or sequence elements to even-numbered subcarriers in the localized<br>
synchronization channel bandwidth and zeros to other subcarriers in the localized<br>
synchronization channel bandwidth. Other embodiments of the invention may<br>
utilize other methods for providing time domain symmetry. One example includes<br>
mapping modulation symbols or sequence elements to every Nth subcarrier in the<br>
localized synchronization channel bandwidth and zeros to the other subcarriers in<br>
the localized synchronization channel bandwidth, where N is a positive integer,<br>
and where the subcarrier in the localized synchronization channel bandwidth<br>
containing the first of the every Nth subcarrier can be arbitrarily chosen. An<br>
additional example is to use modulation symbols or sequence elements that are<br>
purely real (i.e., their imaginary part is zero) in the localized synchronization<br>
channel bandwidth, since the Fourier transform of a real signal is symmetric in<br>
magnitude around, its central portion. Methods of sequence design and/or mapping<br>
and/or signal repetition other than the provided examples can also be used to<br>
provide predetermined time domain symmetry.<br>
Thus, it can be seen that the present invention provides an initial acquisition<br>
and cell search method utilizing synchronization channel signal sequence elements<br>
with low computational load and a small number of receiver processing steps<br>
which nevertheless provides the four main function of initial acquisition and cell<br>
search (i.e., OFDMA symbol timing detection, frequency error detection, frame<br>
boundary detection and cell specific information detection) in an OFDMA system<br>
supporting multiple system bandwidths, both synchronized and un-synchronized<br>
systems, a large cell index and an OFDMA symbol structure with both short and<br>
long cyclic prefix length. While at least one exemplary embodiment has been<br>
presented in the foregoing detailed description of the invention, it should be<br>
appreciated that a vast number of variations exist. It should also be appreciated<br><br>
that the exemplary embodiment or exemplary embodiments arc only examples, and<br>
are not intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration of the invention<br>
in any way. Rather, the foregoing detailed description will provide those skilled in<br>
the art with a convenient road map for implementing an exemplary embodiment of<br>
the invention, it being understood that various changes may be made in the<br>

synchronization channel signal sequence elements comprises the step of maximal length<br>
binary sequence differential processing the plurality of synchronization channel signal<br>
sequence elements to derive at least partial cell identification information therefrom.<br>
18.	The method of Claim 13 wherein the step of detecting comprises the step of<br>
detecting a position of the synchronization channel as a synchronization channel signal<br>
within the portion of the bandwidth of the OFDMA signals, and wherein the step of<br>
decoding comprises the step of decoding the synchronization channel signal to derive at<br>
least partial cell identification information therefrom.<br><br>
A method and apparatus is provided for<br>
transmitting an orthogonal frequency domain multiple<br>
access (OFDMA) signal including a synchronization<br>
channel signal transmitted within a localized portion<br>
of a bandwidth of the OFDMA signal (818), the<br>
synchronization channel signal having predetermined<br>
time domain symmetry within the localized portion<br>
of the bandwidth (816). The synchronization channel<br>
signal enables an initial acquisition and cell search<br>
method with low computational load which provides<br>
OFDMA symbol timing detection and frequency error<br>
detection by differential processing of sequence elements<br>
of the synchronization channel signal (1112) and<br>
frame boundary detection and cell specific information<br>
detection (1114) in an OFDMA system supporting<br>
multiple system bandwidths, both synchronized and<br>
un-synchronized systems, a large cell index and an<br>
OFDMA symbol structure with both short and long<br>
cyclic prefix length.</td>
