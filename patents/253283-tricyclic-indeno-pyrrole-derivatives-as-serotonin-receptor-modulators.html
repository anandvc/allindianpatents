FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to a series of compounds, to<br>
pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds, and to use of the<br>
compounds and compositions as therapeutic agents. More specifically, compounds<br>
of the present invention are tricyclic indeno-pyrrole compounds. These compounds<br>
are serotonin receptor (5-HT) ligands and are useful for treating diseases, disorders,<br>
and conditions wherein modulation of the activity of serotonin receptors (5-HT) is<br>
desired (e.g. addiction, anxiety, depression and obesity).<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Serotonin has been implicated in a number of diseases, disorders, and<br>
conditions that originate in the central nervous system, including diseases, disorders,<br>
and conditions related to, for example, sleeping, eating, perceiving pain, controlling<br>
body temperature, controlling blood pressure, depression, anxiety, addiction and<br>
schizophrenia. Serotonin also plays an important role in peripheral systems, such as<br>
the gastrointestinal system, where it has been found to mediate a variety of<br>
contractile, secretory, and electrophysiologic effects.<br>
Because of the broad distribution of serotonin within the body, there is<br>
a need for drugs that affect serotonergic systems. In particular, agonists, partial<br>
agonists, and antagonists of serotonergic systems are of interest for the treatment of<br>
a wide range of disorders, including anxiety, depression, hypertension, migraine,<br>
obesity, compulsive disorders, schizophrenia, autism, neurodegenerative disorders<br>
(e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinsonism, and Huntington's chorea), and<br>
chemotherapy-induced vomiting.<br>
The major classes of serotonin receptors (5-HT1-7) contain one to<br>
seven separate receptors that have been formally classified. See Glennon, et al.,<br>
Neuroscience and Behavioral Reviews, 1990, 14, 35; and D. Hoyer, et al.<br>
Pharmacol. Rev. 1994, 46, 157-203.<br>
For example, the 5-HT2 family of receptors contains 5-HT2a, 5-HT2b, and<br><br>
5-HT2c subtypes, which have been grouped together on the basis of primary structure,<br>
secondary messenger system, and operational profile. All three 5-HT2 subtypes are G-<br>
protein coupled, activate phqspholipase C as a principal transduction mechanism, and<br>
contain a seven-transmembrane domain structure. There are distinct differences in the<br>
distribution of the three 5-HT2 subtypes in a mammal. The 5-HT2b and 5-HT2a<br>
receptors are widely distributed in the peripheral nervous system, with 5-HT2a also<br>
found in the brain. The 5-HT2c receptor has been found only in the central nervous<br>
system, being highly expressed in many regions of the human brain. See G. Baxter, et<br>
al. Trends in Pharmacol. Sci. 1995, 16, 105-110.<br>
Subtype 5-HT2a has been associated with effects including<br>
vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation, and bronchoconstriction, as well as certain CNS<br>
effects, while subtype 5-HT2c has been associated with diseases that include<br>
depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, addiction, panic disorders,<br>
phobias, psychiatric syndromes, and obesity. Very little is known about the<br>
pharmocologic role of the 5-HT2b receptor. See F. Jenck, et al., Exp. Opin. Invest.<br>

Certain compounds of the invention may exist in different isomeric (e.g.<br>
enantiomers and distereoisomers) forms. The invention contemplates all such<br>
isomers both in pure form and in admixture, including racernic mixtures. Enol forms<br>
are also included.<br>
The compounds of the invention can exist in unsolvated as well as<br>
solvated forms, including hydrated forms, e.g., hemi-hydrate. In general, the<br>
solvated forms, with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol,<br>
and the like are equivalent to the unsolvated forms for the purposes of the invention.<br>
Certain compounds of the invention also form pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts, e.g., acid addition salts. For example, the nitrogen atoms may form<br>
salts with acids. Examples of suitable acids for salt formation are hydrochloric,<br>
sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, citric, oxalic, malonic, salicylic, malic, furmaric, succinic,<br>
ascorbic, maleic, methanesulfonic and other mineral carboxylic acids well known to<br>
those in the art. The salts are prepared by contacting the free base form with a<br><br>
sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce a salt in the conventional manner.<br>
The free base forms may be regenerated by treating the salt with a suitable dilute<br>
aqueous base solution such, as dilute aqueous hydroxide potassium carbonate,<br>
ammonia, and sodium bicarbonate. The free base forms differ from their respective<br>
salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar<br>
solvents, but the acid salts are equivalent to their respective free base forms for<br>
purposes of the invention. (See, for example S. M. Berge, et al., "Pharmaceutical<br>
Salts," J. Pharm. Sci., 66: 1-19 (1977) which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
As used herein, the term "composition" is intended to encompass a<br>
product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any<br>
product which results, directly or indirectly, from a combination of the specified<br>
ingredients in the specified amounts.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be used in the form of<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts derived from inorganic or organic acids. The<br>
phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" means those salts which are, within the<br>
scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of<br>
humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the<br>
like and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts are well-known in the art. For example, S. M. Berge et al. describe<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in J. Pharmaceutical Sciences, 1977, 66: 1<br>
et seq. The salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of<br>
the compounds of the invention or separately by reacting a free base function with a<br>
suitable organic acid. Representative acid addition salts include, but are not limited<br>
to acetate, adipate, alginate, citrate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate,<br>
bisulfate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, digluconate, glycerophosphate,<br>
hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, fumarate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide,<br>
hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethansulfonate (isothionate), lactate, maleate,<br>
methanesulfonate, nicotinate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, oxalate, palmitoate, pectinate,<br>
persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, succinate, tartrate,<br>
thiocyanate, phosphate, glutamate, bicarbonate,<br>
p-toluenesulfonate and undecanoate. Also, the basic nitrogen-containing groups can<br>
be quaternized with such agents as lower alkyl halides such as methyl, ethyl, propyl,<br>
and butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; dialkyl sulfates like dimethyl, diethyl,<br>
dibutyl and diamyl sulfates; long chain halides such as decyl, lauryl, myristyl and<br><br>
stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; arylalkyi halides like benzyl and phenethyl<br>
bromides and others. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible products are thereby<br>
obtained. Examples of acids which can be employed to form pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable acid addition salts include such inorganic acids as hydrochloric acid,<br>
hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid and such organic acids as<br>
oxalic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid and citric acid.<br>
Basic addition salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation<br>
and purification of compounds of this invention by reacting a carboxylic acid-<br>
containing moiety with a suitable base such as the hydroxide, carbonate or<br>
bicarbonate of a pharmaceutically acceptable metal cation or with ammonia or an<br>
organic primary, secondary or tertiary amine. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
include, but are not limited to, cations based on alkali metals or alkaline earth metals<br>
such as lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and aluminum salts and<br>
the like and nontoxic quaternary ammonia and amine cations including ammonium,<br>
tetramethylammonium, tetraethylammonium, methylammonium, dimethylammonium,<br>
trimethylammonium, triethylammonium, diethylammonium, and ethylammonium<br>
among others. Other representative organic amines useful for the formation of base<br>
addition salts include ethylenediamine, ethanolamihe, diethanolamine, piperidine,<br>
piperazine and the like.<br>
Dosage forms for topical administration of a compound of this invention<br>
include powders, sprays, ointments and inhalants. The active compound is mixed<br>
under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed<br>
preservatives, buffers or propellants which can be required. Opthalmic formulations,<br>
eye ointments, powders and solutions are also contemplated as being within the<br>
scope of this invention.<br>
Actual dosage levels of active ingredients in the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of this invention can be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active<br>
compound(s) which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a<br>
particular patient, compositions and mode of administration. The selected dosage<br>
level will depend upon the activity of the particular compound, the route of,<br>
administration, the severity of the condition being treated and the condition and prior<br>
medical history of the patient being treated. However, it is within the skill of the art to<br>
start doses of the compound at levels lower than required to achieve the desired<br><br>
therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is<br>
achieved.<br>
When used in the above or other treatments, a therapeutically effective<br>
amount of one of the compounds of the present invention can be employed in pure<br>
form or, where such forms exist, in pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester or<br>
prodrug form. Alternatively, the compound can be administered as a pharmaceutical<br>
composition containing the compound of interest in combination with one or more<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The phrase "therapeutically effective<br>
amount" of the compound of the invention means a sufficient amount of the<br>
compound to treat disorders, at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any<br>
medical treatment. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the<br>
compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the<br>
attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgement. The specific<br>
therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a<br>
variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder;<br>
activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the<br>
age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of<br>
administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific<br>
compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or<br>
coincidental with the specific compound employed; and like factors well known in the<br>
medical arts. For example, it is well within the skill of the art to start doses of the<br>
compound at levels lower than required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and<br>
to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved.<br>
The total daily dose of the compounds of this invention administered to<br>
a human or lower animal may range from about 0.0001 to about 1000 mg/kg/day.<br>
For purposes of oral administration, more preferable doses can be in the range of<br>
from about 0.001 to about 5 mg/kg/day. If desired, the effective daily dose can be<br>
divided into multiple doses for purposes of administration; consequently, single dose<br>
compositions may contain such amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the<br>
daily dose.<br>
The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions that<br>
comprise compounds of the present invention formulated together with one or more<br>
non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. The pharmaceutical compositions<br><br>
can be specially formulated for oral administration in solid or liquid form, for<br>
parenteral injection or for rectal administration.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be administered<br>
to humans and other mammals orally, rectaIly, parenterally , intracisternally,<br>
intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments or drops), bucally<br>
or as an oral or nasal spray. The term "parenterally," as used herein, refers to modes<br>
of administration which include intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal,<br>
intrasternal, subcutaneous and intraarticular injection and infusion.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising a component of the present invention and a physiologically<br>
tolerable diluent. The present invention includes one or more compounds as<br>
described above formulated into compositions together with one or more non-toxic<br>
physiologically tolerable or acceptable diluents, carriers, adjuvants or vehicles that<br>
are collectively referred to herein as diluents, for parenteral injection, for intranasal<br>
delivery, for oral administration in solid or liquid form, for rectal or topical<br>
administration, among others.<br>
The compositions can also be delivered through a catheter for local<br>
delivery at a target site, via an intracoronary stent (a tubular device composed of a<br>
fine wire mesh), or via a biodegradable polymer. The compounds may also be<br>
complexed to ligands, such as antibodies, for targeted delivery.<br>
Compositions suitable for parenteral injection may comprise<br>
physiologically acceptable, sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions,<br>
suspensions or emulsions and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable<br>
solutions or dispersions. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers,<br>
diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (propyleneglycol,<br>
polyethyleneglycol, glycerol, and the like), vegetable oils (such as olive oil),<br>
injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate, and suitable mixtures thereof.<br>
These compositions can also contain adjuvants such as preserving,<br>
wetting, emulsifying, and dispensing agents. Prevention of the action of<br>
microorganisms can be ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for<br>
example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be<br>
desirable to include isotonic agents, for example sugars, sodium chloride and the like.<br>
Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by<br><br>
the use of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and<br>
gelatin.<br>
Suspensions, ih addition to the active compounds, may contain<br>
suspending agents, as for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene<br>
sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide,<br>
bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, or mixtures of these substances, and the like.<br>
In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of the drug, it is desirable<br>
to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This<br>
can be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous<br>
material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends<br>
upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and<br>
crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug<br>
form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.<br>
Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices<br>
of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending<br>
upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed,<br>
the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable<br>
polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable<br>
formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or<br>
microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.<br>
The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration<br>
through a bacterial-retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of<br>
sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or<br>
other sterile injectable medium just prior to use.<br>
Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets,<br>
pills, powders and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound may<br>
be mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier,<br>
such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as<br>
starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol and silicic acid; b) binders such as<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose and acacia;<br>
c) humectants such as glycerol; d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium<br>
carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates and sodium<br>
carbonate; e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin; f) absorption accelerators<br>
such as quaternary ammonium compounds; g) wetting agents such as cetyl alcohol<br><br>
and glycerol monostearate; h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay and i)<br>
lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene<br>
glycols, sodium lauryl' sulfate and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets<br>
and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.<br>
Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in<br>
soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as<br>
well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.<br>
The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills and<br>
granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and<br>
other coatings well-known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally<br>
contain opacifying agents and may also be of a composition such that they release<br>
the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract,<br>
optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be<br>
used include polymeric substances and waxes.<br>
The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if<br>
appropriate, with one or more of the above-mentioned excipients.<br>
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the<br>
active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly<br>
used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and<br>
emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate,<br>
benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethyl<br>
formamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and<br>
sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid<br>
esters of sorbitan and mixtures thereof.<br>
Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions may also include<br>
adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening,<br>
flavoring and perfumingagents.<br>
Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably<br>
suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with<br>
suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol<br>
or a suppository wax which are solid at room temperature but liquid at body<br>
temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active<br>
compound.<br><br>
Compounds of the present invention can also be administered in the<br>
form of liposomes. As is known in the art, liposomes are generally derived from<br>
phospholipids or other lipid substances. Liposomes are formed by mono- or multi-<br>
lamellar hydrated liquid crystals which are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any<br>
non-toxic, physiologically acceptable and metabolizable lipid capable of forming<br>
liposomes can be used. The present compositions in liposome form can contain, in<br>
addition to a compound of the present invention, stabilizers, preservatives, excipients<br>
and the like. The preferred lipids are natural and synthetic phospholipids and<br>
phosphatidyl cholines (lecithins) used separately or together.<br>
Methods to form liposomes are known in the art. See, for example,<br>
Prescott, Ed., Methods in Cell Biology,Volume XIV, Academic Press, New York, N.Y.<br>
(1976), p. 33 et seq.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs" as used herein<br>
represents those prodrugs of the compounds of the present invention which are,<br>
within the scope of sound medical judgement, suitable for use in contact with the<br>
tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic<br>
response, and the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and<br>
effective for their intended use, as well as the zwitterionic forms, where possible, of<br>
the compounds of the invention. Prodrugs of the present invention may be rapidly<br>
transformed: in vivo to the parent compound of the above formula, for example, by<br>
hydrolysis in blood. A thorough discussion is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella,<br>
Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,V. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in<br>

Separation of Enantiomers for Selected Compounds of the Invention<br>
The following compounds were separated into their respective enantiomers using a<br>
10 mm x 250 mm Chiral Pak AD-RH chiral column.<br><br><br>
The following procedure was utilized to evaluate representative<br>
compounds of the present invention as 5HT2c receptor agonists. The results of this<br>
assay are set forth in Table 1.<br>
Cell culture<br>
HEK 293 EBNA expressing the human 5HT2c receptor (VSV Isoform;<br>
Burns et al., NATURE 387:30308, 1997) were grown in DMEM containing 10%<br>
dialysed FBS, 9 µg/ml blasticidin at 37°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere.<br>
Calcium mobilization<br>
HEK 293 EBNA cells expressing human 5HT2C receptor (2x104/well)<br>
were seeded in black 384-well collagen coated plates and incubated overnight at<br>
37°C in a 5% CO2/95% atmosphere. After removing medium, cells were treated with<br>
HBSS buffer (137 mM NaCI, 5.4 mM KCI, 5.5 mM Glucose, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5,<br>
2.1 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM CaCl2, 0.02mM MgSO4, 3.0mM NaHCO3, and 0.64mM<br>
KH2PO4) containing the Calcium3 dye (Molecular Device, CA), 2.5 mM probenecid<br>
and 0.08% pluronic acid for 60 minutes according to manufacture's instruction.<br>
Compounds that were solubilized in 100% DMSO were diluted in CsCI Ringers<br>
buffer (58.3 mM CsCI, 5.4 mM KCI, 5.5 mM Glucose, 2.0 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 2.1 mM<br>
MgCl2,1.2 mM CaCl2) such that the final DMSO concentration did not exceed 5%.<br>
5HT was utilized as a positive control. Ligand induced calcium release and<br>
consequent fluorescence was measured on a Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader<br>
(FLIPR, Molecular Device, CA).<br>
Data analysis<br>
All data were analyzed by nonlinear least square curve fitting using<br>
Prism 4.0 software. Agonist stimulation of calcium-induced fluorescence in FLIPR<br>
was fitted to sigmoidal dose response using equation Y=Bottom + (Top-<br>
Bottom)/(1+10^((LogEC50-X))), where X is the logarithm of concentration of<br>
compounds and Y is the fluorescent response.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
