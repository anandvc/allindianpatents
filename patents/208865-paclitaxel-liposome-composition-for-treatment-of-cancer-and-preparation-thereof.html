The  following  specification  particularly  describes the nature  of the<br>
invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.	<br>
1<br><br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for treatment of cancer, especially relates to a paclitaxel liposome composition for treatment of cancer and method of preparation thereof.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Paclitaxel is an anticarcinogen found by the National Cancer Institute, USA through screening thousands of plants in the 1960s. It is generally used for treatment of oophoroma, breast carcinoma and non-small-cell lung carcinoma. Because paclitaxel is difficult to be dissolved in water and many officinal solvents, all of the paclitaxel injections provided presently in the domestic and overseas market were prepared with the complex dissolvent of polyoxyethylated castor oil and anhydrous ethanol. The polyoxyethylated castor oil in the complex dissolvent will result in the release of histamine when degraded in body, and thus may cause serious hyperallergic reaction/pleoergy.<br>
A paclitaxel injection (trade name is Taxol) is registered in China by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, USA, and it was pointed out in the specification that "all patients who receive the Taxol should be given in advance corticosteroid (such as dexamethasone), diphenhydramine and H2 receptor antagonist (such as cimitidine, ranitidine) in order to prevent the occurrence of serious hyperallergic reaction." And it also said that "precipitation (crystal) may appear when diluted with physiological saline or<br>
5% glucose before injection. So it is necessary to be filtrated with 0.22 n m<br>
millipore filter to assure the safety in administration." Also paclitaxel itself has haematics toxicity, bone marrow depression, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia and other toxicities. Therefore, change of paclitaxel"s dosage form are demanded urgently to increase its solubility, improve its stability and clinical compliance, and avoid the allergic reaction caused by the above complex dissolvent and other toxic side effect.<br>
Practicable progress was achieved from the basic researches of paclitaxel liposome in the early 1990s and the recent preclinical study. The experiments indicated that the paclitaxel liposome preparation had similar<br>
2<br><br>
therapeutic effectiveness with reduced toxicity and improved tolerance compared to the paclitaxel injection preparation. SharmaA reported a paclitaxel liposome (code name TTL) made from three synthetic phosphatides (Int. J. Cancer 1997, 71, 103-107) with better stability than the paclitaxel liposome (code name ETL) made from single lecithin. But it did not say how much the difference of stability was between the two preparations, and only mentioned that the ETL preparation maintained its stability for 24 hours after dissolved in water and that the solvent used was benzene or butanol. Benzene has much toxicity when used as solvent.<br>
In US patent No. 5,415,869 (1995), it was mentioned that aggregation occurred in the paclitaxel liposome preparation made from single lecithin. Thus electronegative or electropositive ingredient such as phosphatidyl glycerol (PG) was introduced. The ratio of lecithin to PG adopted by the patent was 9:1 or 3:7 while chloroform was used as solvent, the paclitaxel liposome did not aggregation. But when the ratio was 5:5 the paclitaxel liposome crystal precipitated. PG is difficult to obtain due to its low content in lecithin. And there are only expensive products of PG of reagent grade overseas. Also chloroform has too much toxicity when used as solvent.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
One object of the present invention is to provide a paclitaxel liposome composition for treatment of cancer without polyoxyethylated castor oil.<br>
The second object of the present invention is to provide a paclitaxel liposome composition for treatment of cancer, which has good colliquefaction with the water soluble transfusion and can be infused directly into 5% glucose solution for intravenous drip after shaking, and has reduced toxicity and can avoid the hyperallergic reaction caused by the complex dissolvent and has improved stability and relatively lower cost.<br>
The third object of the present invention is to provide a method of preparation of paclitaxel liposome composition for treatment of cancer without polyoxyethylated castor oil.<br>
The fourth object of the present invention is to provide a method of preparation of paclitaxel liposome composition for treatment of cancer with<br>
3<br><br>
improved water solubility and stability using liposome imbedding technique.<br>
These and other objects will be further described and represented through the following detailed illustration.<br>

In the present invention, the single lecithin together with cholesterol and ammo acids is used as the stabilizing agent. Amino acids are amphoteric material, which can show electrification at given pHs such as in the present technical scheme. So this will prevent aggregation and precipitations of taxol crystal. The method uses easily obtained material so that the cost is low compared to the reported methods, in which electronegative ingredient such as PG or electropositive ingredient were added. And the obtained paclitaxel liposome has better stability than that only with single lecithin. Aggregation does not occur and crystal does not precipitate in the obtained paclitaxel liposome when standing after dissolved with water (table 2).<br>

The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for treatment of cancer, especially relates to a paclitaxel liposome composition for treatment of cancer and method of preparation thereof.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Paclitaxel is an anticarcinogen found by the National Cancer Institute, USA through screening thousands of plants in the 1960s. It is generally used for treatment of oophoroma, breast carcinoma and non-small-cell lung carcinoma. Because paclitaxel is difficult to be dissolved in water and many officinal solvents, all of the paclitaxel injections provided presently in the domestic and overseas market were prepared with the complex dissolvent of polyoxyethylated castor oil and anhydrous ethanol. The polyoxyethylated castor oil in the complex dissolvent will result in the release of histamine when degraded in body, and thus may cause serious hyperallergic reaction/pleoergy.<br>
A paclitaxel injection (trade name is Taxol) is registered in China by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, USA, and it was pointed out in the specification that "all patients who receive the Taxol should be given in advance corticosteroid (such as dexamethasone), diphenhydramine and H2 receptor antagonist (such as cimitidine, ranitidine) in order to prevent the occurrence of serious hyperallergic reaction." And it also said that "precipitation (crystal) may appear when diluted with physiological saline or<br>
5% glucose before injection. So it is necessary to be filtrated with 0.22 n m<br>
millipore filter to assure the safety in administration." Also paclitaxel itself has haematics toxicity, bone marrow depression, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia and other toxicities. Therefore, change of paclitaxel"s dosage form are demanded urgently to increase its solubility, improve its stability and clinical compliance, and avoid the allergic reaction caused by the above complex dissolvent and other toxic side effect.<br>
Practicable progress was achieved from the basic researches of paclitaxel liposome in the early 1990s and the recent preclinical study. The experiments indicated that the paclitaxel liposome preparation had similar<br>
2<br><br>
therapeutic effectiveness with reduced toxicity and improved tolerance compared to the paclitaxel injection preparation. SharmaA reported a paclitaxel liposome (code name TTL) made from three synthetic phosphatides (Int. J. Cancer 1997, 71, 103-107) with better stability than the paclitaxel liposome (code name ETL) made from single lecithin. But it did not say how much the difference of stability was between the two preparations, and only mentioned that the ETL preparation maintained its stability for 24 hours after dissolved in water and that the solvent used was benzene or butanol. Benzene has much toxicity when used as solvent.<br>
In US patent No. 5,415,869 (1995), it was mentioned that aggregation occurred in the paclitaxel liposome preparation made from single lecithin. Thus electronegative or electropositive ingredient such as phosphatidyl glycerol (PG) was introduced. The ratio of lecithin to PG adopted by the patent was 9:1 or 3:7 while chloroform was used as solvent, the paclitaxel liposome did not aggregation. But when the ratio was 5:5 the paclitaxel liposome crystal precipitated. PG is difficult to obtain due to its low content in lecithin. And there are only expensive products of PG of reagent grade overseas. Also chloroform has too much toxicity when used as solvent.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
One object of the present invention is to provide a paclitaxel liposome composition for treatment of cancer without polyoxyethylated castor oil.<br>
The second object of the present invention is to provide a paclitaxel liposome composition for treatment of cancer, which has good colliquefaction with the water soluble transfusion and can be infused directly into 5% glucose solution for intravenous drip after shaking, and has reduced toxicity and can avoid the hyperallergic reaction caused by the complex dissolvent and has improved stability and relatively lower cost.<br>
The third object of the present invention is to provide a method of preparation of paclitaxel liposome composition for treatment of cancer without polyoxyethylated castor oil.<br>

In the present invention, the single lecithin together with cholesterol and ammo acids is used as the stabilizing agent. Amino acids are amphoteric material, which can show electrification at given pHs such as in the present technical scheme. So this will prevent aggregation and precipitations of taxol crystal. The method uses easily obtained material so that the cost is low compared to the reported methods, in which electronegative ingredient such as PG or electropositive ingredient were added. And the obtained paclitaxel liposome has better stability than that only with single lecithin. Aggregation does not occur and crystal does not precipitate in the obtained paclitaxel liposome when standing after dissolved with water (table 2).<br>
