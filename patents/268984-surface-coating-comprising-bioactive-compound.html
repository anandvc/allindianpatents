				<td>Background of the Invention Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to use of coatings on medical devices for the purpose of down-regulating complement activation. The present invention relates to methods for modifying medical devices, including those having inorganic or metal surfaces, for the purpose of improving biocompatibility. The invention also relates to methods for attaching bioactive compounds to the surface of a medical device that may have a therapeutic effect and or improve the function of the device.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
The implantation of medical devices and/or other biomaterials in a body can result in injury and initiation of the inflammatory response. The complement and coagulation systems can play a role in a body's acceptance or rejection of a medical device.<br>
Both the complement and coagulation systems comprise a complex set of proteins that when activated, exert their effects through a cascade of protein-protein and protein-cell interactions. The complement system is a certain part of the immune system and helps to protect the body from invading pathogens. The complement system comprises three pathways: the classical pathway, the alternative pathway, and the lectin pathway [ 1 ]. These pathways proceed differently in their initial steps but they converge at the level of C3 to share the same terminal components that result in the attack of target cells. In addition to producting terminal complexes that are capable of lysing target cells, activation of the complement cascades results in production of inflammatory mediators and stimulation of inflammitory cells. The classical pathway is triggered by antibody recognition, whereas, the alternate pathway is antibody independent and can be initiated by certain surface markers on pathogen cells. The alternate pathway is thought to be the major contributor to inflammation associated with blood material interactions. However, evidence exists that the classical pathway can also contribute [2-4]. For this reason, an<br>
ideal modulator of material induced inflammation would provide for down-regulation of both pathways.<br>
Increasing knowledge about the underlying factors that contribute to many types of inflammatory diseases, transplantation rejection, sepsis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) has triggered a wide spread effort to identify therapeutic targets for both the complement and coagulation systems. Both natural and synthetic regulators of these systems have been identified in a variety of forms including proteins, peptides, antibodies, oligonucleotides, and synthetic molecules [5-19]. A peptide of particular interest is compstatin [4]. Natural regulators of complement activation (RCA) include factor H, factor H like protein 1 (FHL-1), factor H related proteins (FHR-3, FHR-4), C4 binding protein (C4bp), complement receptor 1 (CRl), decay-accelerating factor (DAF), and membrane cofactor protein (MCP). Under normal conditions, these proteins keep the activation processes of complement in check and all have been considered in one form or another as potential treatments for immune system dysfunctions. Certain types of viruses produce complement regulatory proteins as a means of evading the human immune system. Two regulators of interest due to their high potency are vaccinia virus complement control protein (VCP) and small pox inhibitor of complement enzymes (SPICE) [20].<br>
Biomaterials used for medical devices act as substitutes for natural tissue. Compatibility characterizes a set of material specifications which address the various aspects of material-tissue interactions. More specifically, hemocompatibility defines the ability of a biomaterial to stay in contact with blood for a clinically relevant period of time without causing alterations of the formed elements and plasma constituents of the blood or substantially altering the composition of the material itself.<br>
Cardiovascular devices and extracorporeal circulation (ECC) devices come into contact with large volumes of blood. This contact initiates an inflammatory reaction that is responsible for many adverse side effects [21, 22], The type and severity of side effects depends on a number of factors including the type of device and procedure, the patient's susceptibility to inflammation, and the biocompatibility of the materials from which the devices are constructed [23]. Many of these factors can not be controlled. However, by improving the hemocompatibility of materials used to construct the blood contacting surfaces of these devices, it is possible substantially decrease side effects and improve patency.<br>
In the case of cardiovascular devices, the most serious side effect of blood-material contact is activation of the coagulation cascade and thrombus formation. However, it is now clear that side effects associated with complement activation and inflammation also play a major role in determining the long term success of these devices. For example, restenosis after stent placement occurs in 8% to 80% of patients within 6 months depending on both anatomic and clinical risk factors [24]. Stent implantation results in early deendothelialization, injury to smooth muscle cells and thrombus deposition. With time, this leads to smooth muscle cell proliferation, migration and deposition of extracellular matrix. In some patients this process occur in excess and leads to neointimal growth and narrowing of the artery lumen. Inflammation plays a pivotal role in this process, where activated inflammatory cells secrete factors that stimulate smooth muscle cell growth and matrix deposition. Methods that can reduce inflammation associated with stent implantation may reduce the incidence of restenosis.<br>
Side effects associated with ECC procedures including cardiopulmonary bypass, plasmapheresis, plateletpheresis, leukopheresis, LDL removal, hemodialysis, ultrafiltration, and hemoperfusion, stem from a series of events that occur when blood contacts artificial materials including, but not limited to, adsorption of plasma proteins, platelet adhesion and activation, activation of the complement and coagulation cascades, and activation of leukocytes. These events can lead to a systemic inflammatory response and can cause serious complications. Examples of complications include, but are not limited to, myocardial dysfunction, respiratory failure, renal and neurological dysfunction, bleeding disorders, altered liver function, and multiple organ failure. Systemic inflammation is also thought to play role in the accelerated arteriosclerosis that is commonly observed in hemodialysis patients [25-28]. Furthermore, many patients who are in need of hemodialysis or hemofiltration already have compromised immune systems. For example, approximately 20% of sepsis patients require hemodialysis. Unfortunately, although the dialysis can be successful in removing toxins from the patient's blood, it can simultaneously, further exacerbate the patient's inflammatory condition.<br>
The majority of therapeutics for immune disorders are developed for systemic administration. Because ECC causes dysfunctions of the same systems, many of these therapeutics have also been considered as treatments for patients undergoing ECC, most notably, cardiopulmonary bypass [18, 23, 29]. However, there are limitations and<br>
side effects associated with systemic delivery of these therapeutics; the patient's immune system can be compromised, leaving them at greater risk for infection, or they can be put at risk for serious bleeding.<br>
To this end, much work has been done to improve a material's hemocompatability for medical devices and these approaches more or less fall into two main categories. In the first category, materials have been modified to make them inert. This has largely been accomplished by modifying the materials with hydrophilic polymers such as PEO [18, 23, 29-38]. The intent here has been to inhibit protein adsorption and platelet adhesion to the device and thereby minimize activation of the complement and coagulation cascades. A limitation of this type of approach is the inability to attach a sufficient amount of hydrophilic polymer to the device surface without altering the material's bulk properties, or in the case of dialysis, without altering the device's ability to remove toxic components from the blood. It has also proven difficult to modify the surfaces of some types of materials due to an inability to impart needed functional groups. In the second category, proteins, peptides or carbohydrates have been applied to the device surface that have the capacity to down regulate the complement or coagulation cascade [39,40]. Within this category, the most widely used approach has been to modify materials with heparin. Here, the device displays a therapeutic component, however, depending on the protein or peptide used for coating, the primary source of the problem, namely nonspecific blood-material interactions, can still persist and the side effects that result from those interactions may not be completely offset by the therapeutic factor. Furthermore, some methods that can be used to activate materials to allow for coupling to therapeutic proteins or peptides can, in of themselves, promote complement activation [39]. Both types of approaches have shown some improvement over their unmodified counterparts in experimental systems; however, solid improvements in clinical outcomes remain questionable and further improvements to materials for medical devices are very much needed.<br>
Methods for modifying the surfaces of medical devices with passivating molecules such as polyethylene oxide (PEO) have been described. These methods have been shown to reduce protein adsorption and platelet adhesion. One prior art method involves modifying inorganic and metal substrates to incorporate PEO chains by first silanizing the metal, second exposing the metal to a hydrophilic polymer or block copolymer containing one or more hydrophilic blocks or other passivating molecule, and<br>
third causing the formation of a covalent bond between the silane layer and the passivating molecule by for example, applying UV or gamma irradiation. A similar approach involving the application of UV activatable silane reagents has been used to covalently bond polymeric films to silicone wafers (Prucker et al, 1999).<br>
A major limitation of prior art methods is the inability to attach additional molecules to the substrate after it has been modified with a passivating molecule. Caldwell et al have described a method for applying a passivating coating to surfaces, while simultaneously, incorporating functional groups that could be used to specifically immobilize proteins or other biomolecules (US patent 5,516,703). However, the method of Caldwell et al. utilizes its application to hydrophobic surfaces, primarily those that are polymeric.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment In one embodiment, coatings that are protein resistant or coatings that contain a protein resistant component and a therapeutic component are applied to surfaces of metal or inorganic substrates by first treating a surface of the substrate with a silane reagent, hydrolyzing the silane reagent such that the silane reagent can react with other silanol groups or metal oxides, curing the silane layer such that the silane layer forms bonds with the surface of the substrate, incubating the silane-modified surface with surfactants or coatings, such as those described herein, and exposing the silane-modified surface to a source of radiation including, for example, ultraviolet (UV), gamma, or electron beam.<br>
Silane reagents include those having the formula<br>
RnSiX(4-n)<br>
wherein X is a hydrolyzable group, such as alkoxy, acyloxy, amine, or halo and wherein n is an integer. Preferred hydrolyzable groups include, but are not limited to, methoxy, ethoxy, and chlorine. R is a nonhydrolyzable group that enables the silane layer to form a bond with and promote the adsorption of the surfactant or coating. R may also be prone to radical formation upon exposure to radiation and thereby facilitate the formation of a covalent bond between the silane layer and the surfactant or coating layer. For example, R may contain a vinyl group (i.e. a double bonded carbon) or a UV activatable group, for example, benzophenone. Examples of preferred silane reagents include octadecyltrimethoxysilane (ODtMOS), trichlorovinyl silane (TCVS), hexamethyl disilazane (HMDS), PS200 (Glassclad®18 from United Chemical) and 4-(3'-chlorodimethylsilyl)propyloxybenzophenone.<br>
Silicon (Si) is the center of the silane molecule which contains a nonhydrolyzable group (R) with hydrolyzable group (X). The hydrolyzable group (X) of the silane molecule can hydrolyze to produce silanol, which reacts with other silanol groups or metal oxides. The alkoxy groups of the silane reagent can react with water or a solution of water to form silanol groups. A solution containing water can also contain another solvent to enable or enhance solubility of the materials.<br>
R is a nonhydrolyzable group that enables the silane layer to form a bond with and promote the adsorption of the surfactant or coating. R may also be prone to radical formation upon exposure to radiation and thereby facilitate the formation of a bond between the silane layer and the surfactant or coating layer. Some embodiments comprise curing the silane layer such that the silane layer forms stable bonds with the surface of the substrate. In some embodiments, curing the silane layer comprises heating the silane layer for a certain time at a certain temperature. In some embodiments, curing the silane layer can be done at a lowered pressure.<br>
In an embodiment, the silane-modified surface is incubated with a surfactant or coating and subsequently exposed to a source of radiation including, for example, ultraviolet (UV), gamma, or electron beam. Radiation curing can use ultraviolet (UV), electron beam (EB), or gamma electromagnetic radiation which may induce the formation of free radicals within either the R group of the silane layer or carbon-carbon bonds within the surfactant or coating. Free radicals can be generated and rapidly<br>
recombined to form bonds with nearby molecules. Due to the proximity of the surfactant or coating with the silane layer, some of the free radicals can form bonds between the surfactant or coating and the silane layer, thereby grafting the surfactant or coating to the silane-modified surface. The hydrophobic polymer segment of a surfactant or coating is likely to adsorb to a substrate through multiple sites. Therefore, this grafting approach is likely to produce multiple points of attachment between the silane layer and individual surfactant or coating molecules, resulting in increased stability of the surfactant or coating layer on the surface. Called photopolymerization, the UV-curing process is a photochemical reaction. Specially formulated coatings are exposed to a UV-Iight source, initiating crosslinking. EB curing crosslinks coatings by exposing them to ionizing radiation in the form of a concentrated beam of highly charged electrons from which energy is transferred to the sample. Alternatively, radiation curing can use gamma radiation which is a type of high-energy radiation. Gamma rays are very short wavelength electromagnetic radiation and are extremely energetic.<br>
The present embodiments preferably provide one or more of the following advantages over prior art methods. The present embodiments provide means to modify inorganic and metal substrates with a passivating layer, where the passivating layer contains functional groups that can be used to attach additional molecules having desirable activities to the surface. The present embodiments provide means to produce a more effective and robust passivating layer for inhibiting protein adsorption/activation and platelet adhesion by utilizing an end group activated Pluronic (EGAP) in place of an unmodified Pluronic or other passivating molecules that have been used previously to modify metal and inorganic substrates. The present embodiments also describe a very simple and cost effective coating that involves the application of a single silane layer to metal substrates and which reduces protein adsorption and complement activation.<br>
Other advantages include, but are not limited to:<br>
-an improvement in the level of adsorption of surfactants on substrates that is achieved by preheating substrates prior to immersing them in a solution of the surfactant. The adsorption of certain surfactants may be entropically driven. Therefore, by increasing the temperature of the sample, the driving force for adsorption is increased. However, if the temperature of the surfactant solution is increased above the critical micelle temperature, the adsorption efficiency may decrease due to the engagement of surfactant molecules in micelles. By increasing the temperature of the substrate to be coated rather<br>
than heating the surfactant solution, it is possible to increase the driving force for adsorption at the sample surface without causing undue micelle formation in the bulk surfactant solution, thereby promoting a higher level of adsorption of surfactant on the substrate.<br>
-the methods described herein produce very smooth, thin coatings that do not crack or peel after expansion and contraction of a coated device.<br>
One embodiment is a medical device comprising: a structure adapted for introduction into a patient or contact with blood or tissue of a patient, wherein the structure comprises a surface; a layer of hydrolyzed and cured silane reagent on the surface of the medical device; a layer of coating applied on a si lane-modified surface of the medical device, wherein the coating on the silane-modified surface of the medical device is substantially non-activating or deactivating to the complement cascade as compared to the non-coated surface of the medical device.<br>
A related aspect is a method for coating a medical device with a surface coating comprising: providing the medical device with a surface; exposing the surface to a silane reagent; hydrolyzing the silane reagent to form a silane layer on the surface; curing the silane reagent onto the surface to stabilize a bond between the silane layer and the surface, thereby creating a silane-modified surface on the medical device; providing a coating; adsorbing the coating on the silane-modified surface of the medical device; wherein the surfactant on the silane-modified surface of the medical device is substantially non-activating compared to the non-coated surface of the medical device; and applying irradiation to the coating on the silane-modified surface of the medical device.<br>
A related aspect is a method for coating a medical device with a surface coating comprising: providing the medical device with a surface; exposing the surface to a silane reagent; hydrolyzing the silane reagent to form a silane layer on the surface; curing the silane reagent onto the surface to stabilize a bond between the silane layer and the surface, thereby creating a silane-modified surface on the medical device; providing a coating; adsorbing the coating on the silane-modified surface of the medical device; wherein the surfactant on the silane-modified surface of the medical device is substantially non-activating compared to the non-coated surface of the medical device; applying irradiation to the coating on the silane-modified surface of the medical device;<br>
and coupling a therapeutic entity to the coating on the silane-modified surface of the medical device.<br>
Examples of application areas include* but are not limited to: medical devices (such as stents, heart valves, pace makers, pacemaker leads, pumps, guide wires, filters, blood gas sensors, surgical tools), dental devices (such as dental tools and dental implants), orthopedic devices (such as hip implants, knee implants, bone screws, pins, and other fixation devices), diagnostic devices, microfluidic devices, protein, DNA and tissue array substrates, especially those requiring a conducting surface, analytical equipment that requires the attachment of biomolecules to inorganic or metal substrates (for example QCM, TIRF based methods).<br>
A combined approach is described herein that provides advantages both in terms of manufacturability and expected clinical outcomes for ECC devices, cardiovascular devices and other medical devices. In this approach, a coating is applied to the device comprising a protein-resistant component and a therapeutic component. The coating renders the material inert and prevents activation of the complement and coagulation systems. In preferred embodiments, one or more areas of the materials are coated with a copolymer that is also end group activated to link to a therapeutic entity. The therapeutic entity can be a protein, peptide, oligonucleotide, protein fragment, protein analog, proteoglycan, antibody, carbohydrate, drug or other natural or synthetic molecule that is capable of down-regulating the complement or coagulation systems. Hence, a coating of preferred embodiments provides a component for rendering the material inert and a component for preventing activation of the complement or coagulation systems and is shown below:<br><br>
wherein the copolymer comprises one or more hydrophilic domains and at least one hydrophobic domain. Preferred embodiments include a medical device comprising a class of compounds for coating a medical device with the formula:<br><br>
wherein the copolymer comprises one or more hydrophilic domains and at least one hydrophobic domain.<br>
In certain embodiments, the surface to be coated is hydrophobic. Examples of preferred surfaces include, but are not limited to, polystyrene, polyurethane, polyethersulfone, polytetrafluoroethylene, and silicone. Lesser hydrophobic materials and biodegradable materials are also included in preferred embodiments. These materials include, but are not limited to, polyvinyl acetate (PVAC), cellulose acetate, biodegradable polymers such as (PGA), polylactide (PLA), poly(e-caprolactone, poly(dioxanone) (PDO), trimethylene carbonate, (TMC) polyaminoacids, polyesteramides, polyanhydrides, polyorthoesters and copolymers of these materials.<br>
The coating composition can also be used to coat metals or inorganic materials, including, but not limited to, stainless steel, cobalt chromium alloys, titanium, titanium nickel alloys, titanium aluminum vanadium alloys, tantalum, aluminum, pyrolytic carbon, glass, ceramics and combinations thereof. It is recognized that some metals may require a pretreatment to achieve stable bonding of the coating composition to the substrate. Such pretreatments are well known to those skilled in the art and may involve such processes as silanization or plasma modification. A coating is applied to the material in the form of a multiblock copolymer that contains one or more hydrophilic domains and at least one hydrophobic domain. The hydrophobic domain can be adsorbed to a hydrophobic surface by hydrophobic bonding while the hydrophilic domains can remain mobile in the presence of a fluid phase.<br>
Preferred copolymer units for forming the copolymer coating of preferred embodiments include, but are not limited to, polyethylene oxide (PEO) and polypropylene oxide (PPO), PEO and polybutadiene, PEO and poly(N-acetylethyleneimine), PEO and phenyl boronic acid, PEO and polyurethane, PEO and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), and PEO and polydimethyl sulfoxide. In the preceding pairs of copolymer units, preferably, the hydrophilic domain comprises PEO. Copolymers using copolymer units of this type and their application to coating materials to prevent protein adsorption have been described previously [39,41-48].<br>
In a certain embodiment, the copolymer comprises pendant or dangling hydrophilic domains, such as polyethylene oxide) (PEO) chains. The other domain(s) of the copolymer comprises a hydrophobic domain, such as a poly(propylene oxide) (PPO) chain. Additionally, a linking group (R) is attached to the copolymer on one end adjacent to the hydrophilic domain to form an end-group activated polymer. For example, the end-<br>
group activated polymer may be in the form of any arrangement of the PEO and PPO blocks with the general formula:<br>
(R-PEO)a(PPO)b	(1)<br>
where a and b are integers, are the same or different and are at least 1, preferably a is between 1 and 6, and b is between 1 and 3, more preferably a is 1 to 2, and b is 1. The polymeric block copolymer has a PEO (-C2H4-O-) content between 10 wt % and 80 wt%, preferably 50 wt % and 80 wt %, more preferably between 70 wt % and 80 wt %.<br>
The PEO chains or blocks are of the general formula:<br>
-(-C2H4-0-)U	(2)<br>
where u is the same or different for different PEO blocks in the molecule. Typically, u is greater than 50, preferably between 50 and 150, more preferably between 80 and 130. The PPO blocks are of the general formula;<br>
-(-C3H6-0-)v	(3)<br>
where v may be the same or different for different PPO blocks in the molecule. Typically, v is greater than 25, preferably between 25 and 75, more preferably between 30 and 60.<br>
The copolymers may be branched structures and include other structures (e.g. bridging structures, or branching structures) and substituents that do not materially affect the ability of the copolymer to adsorb upon and cover a hydrophobic surface. Examples include the following copolymers described in the following paragraphs.<br>
In another embodiment, the end-group activated polymer of preferred embodiments is a derivative of a polymeric tri-block copolymer with pendant R groups, as in Formula (4), below. For example, these tri-block copolymers have a hydrophobic center block of polypropylene oxide and hydrophilic end blocks of polyethylene oxide with terminal R groups, and can be represented by the formula:<br>
R- (-C2H4-0-)x-(-C3H6-0-)y-(-C2H4-0-)z-H	(4)<br>
where y is between 25 and 75, preferably between 30 and 60, and x and z are preferably the same, but may be different, and are between 50 and 150, preferably 80 and 130. Certain types of these polymeric surfactants are commercially referred to as "PLURONIC™" or "POLOXAMERS™", and are available, for example, from BASF. As used herein, "PLURONIC" refers to an end-group activated polymer.<br>
Another suitable class of polymeric block copolymers is the di-block copolymers where a=l and b=l, and can be represented by the formula;<br>
R-PEO-PPO-H	(5)<br>
where PEO and PPO are defined above.<br>
Another suitable class of polymeric block copolymers is represented by the commercially available TETRONIC™ surfactants (from BSAF), which are represented by the formula:<br>
(R-(0-C2H4)u-(0-C3H6)v)2N-CH2-CH2-N((-C3H6-0-)v-(-C2H4-0-)u-H)2	(6)<br>
As used herein, the terms "PLURONIC" or "PLURONICS" refer to the block copolymers defined in Equation (1), which include the PLURONICS™ tri-block copolymer surfactants, the di-block surfactants, the TETRONIC™ surfactants, as well as other block copolymer surfactants as defined.<br>
As disclosed previously, a specific functional group is attached to the free end of a hydrophilic domain to form an end-group activated polymer. The specific functional group (R) may contain a member of the reactive group, such as, hydrazine group, maleimide group, thiopyridyl group, tyrosyl residue, vinylsulfone group, iodoacetimide group, disulfide group or any other reactive group that is stable in an aqueous environment and that does not significantly impair the adsorption of the copolymer on the surface. R may also comprise functional groups capable of forming ionic interactions with proteins, for example a nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) group, which, when bound to a metal ion forms a strong bond with histidine tagged proteins. NTA modified PLURONICS are described in US Patent Number 6,987,452 to Steward et al., hereby incorporated by reference. R may also comprise oligonucleotides that can bind to oligonucleotide tagged proteins. Oligonucleotide modified PLURONICS are described in PCT application No PCT/US02/03341 to Neff et al., hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the R group comprises an R'-S-S group where R' is to be displaced for the immobilization of a therapeutic entity. In one embodiment, the substituent R' can be selected from the group consisting of (1) 2-benzothiazolyl, (2) 5-nitro-2-pyridyl, (3) 2-pyridyl, (4) 4-pyridyl, (5) 5-carboxy-2-pyridyl, and (6) the N-oxides of any of (2) to (5). A preferred end group includes 2-pyridyl disulfide (PDS). The reactivity of these groups with proteins and polypeptides is discussed in U.S. Patent No. 4,149,003 to Carlsson et al. and U.S. Patent No. 4,711,951 to Axen et al, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference. As mentioned above, end group activated polymers (EGAP)s are generally a class of composition comprising a block copolymer backbone and an activation or reactive group.<br>
Preferred embodiments include the use of EGAP coatings for inhibiting biological signaling pathways. In that respect, the second component of the coating of preferred embodiments can be a therapeutic entity that is attached to the material through the activated end groups of the EGAP. The therapeutic entity can be a protein, protein fragment, peptide, oligonucleotide, carbohydrate, proteoglycan or other natural or synthetic molecule that is capable of down-regulating the complement or coagulation systems. As mentioned above, many therapeutic factors that influence the complement and/or coagulation cascades have been described recently and many of these can be considered practical options for down-regulating complement or coagulation from the solid phase as described herein. Regulators of complement activation, including, but not limited to, factor H, factor H like protein 1 (FHL-1), factor H related proteins (FHR-3, FHR-4), C4 binding protein (C4bp), complement receptor 1 (CR1), decay-accelerating factor (DAF), and membrane cofactor protein (MCP), VCP SPICE, and compstatin can be used for this purpose. RCA proteins can be acquired from either natural sources or produced recombinantly. Furthermore, the active domains of these proteins have been identified and recombinantly produced fragments that include these domains or variants of these domains may be used. In a certain embodiment, more than one therapeutic entity can be immobilized onto one surface with the use of EGAP material. The use of EGAP for protein immobilization has been described previously by Caldwell and others. However, Caldwell and others used EGAP to prepare biologically active surfaces for the purpose of evaluating or promoting specific protein-protein interactions and cell adhesion to surfaces [49-53],<br>
Alternatively, the second component of the coating of preferred embodiments can be a therapeutic entity that is capable of removing specific components from a fluid. For example, to remove specific components from blood, the second component can be an antibody.<br>
In a certain embodiment, a material is coated with a block copolymer that displays an immobilized factor H with a disulfide group as a linker to the block copolymer. Factor H is a plasma protein that acts as a multifaceted complement regulator [54]. It facilitates the degradation of C3b by acting as a cofactor to factor I; it has decay accelerating activity for the alternate pathway C3 convertase, (C3bBb); and it competes with Factor B for binding to C3b. It has also been reported to interfere with the Cl complex and may, thereby, inhibit the classical pathway [55]. Because it can potentially<br>
down-regulate both the classical and the alternative pathways of complement, factor H is a preferred candidate for developing materials for ECC devices and other medical devices. It is also advantageous to use factor H from the standpoint that it is natural component of blood and is therefore not likely to cause side effects given the amounts that would be incorporated on a material surface. Furthermore, Andersson et al have previously investigated the potential to use Factor H as a complement regulator from the solid phase and found that indeed, the protein can function to down regulate complement when attached to a material surface [39]. However, limitations were encountered in Andersson et al. that indicated that an improved technique for bonding the protein to surfaces was needed. The approach described herein addresses these limitations and provides a valuable method for improving biocompatibility and, simultaneously, incorporating a therapeutic component into materials used for medical devices.<br>
The modified polymeric surfactant adsorbs with the hydrophobic domain of the copolymer upon the hydrophobic surface and the pendant hydrophilic domain of the copolymer and attached therapeutic entity dangling away from the surface into the aqueous surroundings. Using a triblock copolymer as an example, the adsorbed surface can be illustrated by the formula below:<br>
PEO	THERAPEUTIC ENTITY<br>
-PRO<br>
SUBSTRATE<br>
As used herein, the term "surfactant" refers to a surface-active substance. A surfactant can adhere to a surface and provide an effect. In a preferred embodiment, a surfactant can render a surface inert and prevent activation of the complement and coagulation systems. Herein, the term "coating" may be used interchangeably with "surfactant."<br>
Preferred embodiments provide for a method for coating a medical device with a surface coating comprising: providing the medical device with a surface; providing a surfactant; adsorbing the surfactant on the surface of the medical device;<br>
wherein the surfactant on the surface of the medical device is substantially non-activating or deactivating to the complement cascade as compared to the non-coated surface of the medical device. In a certain embodiment, a medical device comprises a surfactant comprising a block copolymer. In another embodiment, a medical device comprises a surfactant comprising a block copolymer comprising hydrophobic regions and hydrophilic regions. In another embodiment, a medical device comprises a surfactant comprising a PLURONICS block copolymer. In another embodiment, a medical device comprises a surfactant comprising a therapeutic entity attached thereto. In another embodiment, a medical device comprises a surfactant comprising a compound with the formula:<br><br>
wherein the copolymer comprises one or more hydrophilic domains and at least one hydrophobic domain.<br>
Preferred embodiments can be formed by dipcoating a substrate in a aqueous solution containing EGAP. The EGAP material is applied to the substrate in a solution of water, buffer, or a combination of water and an organic solvent, such as alcohol. Due to their ampiphilic nature, these copolymers will self assemble on hydrophobic materials from aqueous solutions. The hydrophobic block forms a hydrophobic bond with the material while the hydrophilic blocks remain mobile in the fluid phase. In this way, the hydrophilic chains form a brush like layer at the surface that prevents adsorption of proteins and cells.<br>
When the EGAP material is bonded to the substrate, the material displays an aryl disulfide. A therapeutic entity comprising at least one cysteine is incubated with the substrate containing the EGAP material. Through a nucleophilic reaction, the therapeutic entity is bonded to the EGAP material by a disulfide bond.<br>
Alternatively, preferred embodiments can be formed by dipcoating a substrate with an EGAP material and subsequently linking a therapeutic entity with a heterobifunctional crosslinker. As like the above procedure, the EGAP material is applied to the material in a solution of water, buffer, or a combination of water and an organic solvent, such as alcohol. When the EGAP material is bonded to the substrate, the material displays an activated end group. A therapeutic entity is incubated with a heterobifunctional crosslinker; hence, the therapeutic entity would display a crosslinkable functional group. The therapeutic entity linked to the crosslinker is then incubated with<br>
the EGAP material to react with the activated end group. Therefore, the preferable active functional groups on the heterobifunctional crosslinker are sulfhydryl group or sulfhydryl reactive group, to react with a terminal disulfide on the EGAP material or sulfhydryl group on the reduced EGAP material, respectively, and any functional group that is reactive toward an available functional group on the therapeutic entity. Ideally, the crosslinker would not alter the activity of the protein and could react with the protein under mild conditions. Such crosslinkers are commercially available from a number of manufacturers. Examples of preferred crosslinkers include N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP), m-Maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (MBS), and N-Succinimidyl S-Acetylthioacetate (SATA).<br>
Advantages of preferred embodiments include the use of a non hazardous coating method, no harsh environmental conditions, no toxic chemicals and no toxic waste products. Preferred embodiments incorporate a simple coating method that is readily incorporated in production process and does not require highly skilled personnel.<br>
Alternatively, preferred embodiments include a therapeutic entity that is attached to the material of a medical device. The therapeutic entity can be a protein, protein fragment, peptide, oligonucleotide, carbohydrate, proteoglycan or other natural or synthetic molecule that is capable of down-regulating the complement or coagulation systems. As mentioned above, many therapeutic factors that influence the complement and/or coagulation cascades have been described recently and many of these can be considered practical options for down-regulating complement or coagulation from the solid phase as described herein. Regulators of complement activation, including, but not limited to, Factor H, factor H like protein 1 (FHL-1), factor H related proteins (FHR-3, FHR-4), C4 binding protein (C4bp), complement receptor 1 (CR1), decay-accelerating factor (DAF), membrane cofactor protein (MCP), VCP and SPICE can also be used for this purpose. Factor H can immobilize to certain materials, such as stainless steel and nitinol, without the use of EGAP. Factor H can effectively be immobilized on both metal substrates by direct adsorption.<br>
The composition of preferred embodiments can be used for any medical device that is in contact with blood. The term "medical device" appearing herein is a device having surfaces that contact human or animal bodily tissue and/or fluids in the course of their operation. The definition includes endoprostheses implanted in blood contact in a human or animal body such as balloon catheters, A/V shunts, vascular grafts,<br>
stents, pacemaker leads, pacemakers, heart valves, and the like that are implanted in blood vessels or in the heart. The definition also includes within its scope devices for temporary intravascular use such as catheters, guide wires, and the like which are placed into the blood vessels or the heart for purposes of monitoring or repair. The medical device can be intended for permanent or temporary implantation. Such devices may be delivered by or incorporated into intravascular and other medical catheters.<br>
The compositions of preferred embodiments can be used for any device used for ECC. As stated above, ECC is used in many medical procedures including, but not limited to, cardiopulmonary bypass, plasmapheresis, plateletpheresis, leukopheresis, LDL removal, hemodialysis, hemofiltration filters, ultrafiltration, and hemoperfusion. Extracorporeal devices for use in surgery include blood oxygenators, blood pumps, blood sensors, tubing used to carry blood and the like which contact blood which is then returned to the patient.<br>
Examples of application areas include, but are not limited to: medical devices (such as stents, heart valves, pace makers, pacemaker leads, pumps, guide wires, filters, blood gas sensors, surgical tools), dental devices (such as dental tools and dental implants), orthopedic devices (such as hip implants, knee implants, bone screws, pins, and other fixation devices), diagnostic devices, microfluidic devices, protein, DNA and tissue array substrates, especially those requiring a conducting surface, analytical equipment that requires the attachment of biomolecules to inorganic or metal substrates (for example QCM, TIRF based methods).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a medical device comprises a structure adapted for introduction into a patient, wherein the structure comprises a surface; a layer of surfactant adsorbed on the surface of the medical device, wherein the surfactant on the surface of the medical device is substantially non-activating or deactivating to the complement cascade as compared to the non-coated surface of the medical device. In a certain embodiment, a medical device comprises a surfactant comprising a block copolymer. In another embodiment, a medical device comprises a surfactant comprising a block copolymer comprising hydrophobic regions and hydrophilic regions. In another embodiment, a medical device comprises a surfactant comprising a PLURONICS block copolymer. In another embodiment, a medical device comprises a surfactant comprising a therapeutic entity attached thereto. In another embodiment, a medical device comprises a surfactant comprising a compound with the formula:<br>
wherein the copolymer comprises one or more hydrophilic domains and at least one hydrophobic domain.<br>
The disclosure below is of specific examples setting forth preferred methods. The examples are not intended to limit scope, but rather to exemplify preferred embodiments.<br>
EXAMPLE 1 IMMOBILIZATION OF FACTOR H ON SUBSTRATE WITH EGAP<br>
Factor H is coupled to a substrate or device that is coated with EGAP-PDS. Factor H contains numerous cysteine residues, some of which may serve as sites for coupling via the PDS groups [56]. The combination of Factor H and EGAP on the surface of the substrate or device acts to down regulate complement activation.<br>
A device or substrate is coated with Factor H by covering the device surface with a solution containing 0.1 to 4% of EGAP in water or water containing buffer salts. This may be accomplished using a dip coating method, for example. After a coating period of 30 minutes to 24 hours, the substrate is washed using water or buffer. Factor H is diluted into phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and then added to the coated substrate. After and incubation period of 2-24 hours, the substrate is washed with buffer. The following controls are prepared for comparison: (1) The substrate is coated with unmodified F108 and subsequently incubated with Factor H and washed as indicated above. (2) The substrate is not treated with any initial coating but is incubated with Factor H and washed as indicated above. (3) The substrate is coated with unmodified F108 only, and (4) The substrate is left untreated. The amount of Factor H that is bound to each surface is determined by enzyme immunoassay using a commercially available biotinylated anti-factor H in conjunction with HRP modified streptavidin for detection.<br>
Each substrate is evaluated to determine the ability of the surface bound factor H to inhibit complement activation when it comes into contact with whole blood, plasma or serum. To accomplish this, two types of assays are performed; one being an analysis of the surface to determine what has stuck to it and the other being an analysis of the blood to determine if specific proteins involved in the complement cascade have been activated. The amount of C-3 fragments that are bound to the substrate are<br>
determined by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). The amounts of fluid phase C3a, Cls-ClNA, and sC5b-9 complexes that are generated as a result of surface contact between the blood and the substrate are monitored using EIA.<br>
In a previous study, it was found that Factor H could be applied to materials to down regulate complement activation. However, the method used to conjugate factor H to the material was, in of its self, complement activating. Coating a material with EGAP material produces the necessary sites for conjugating Factor H, however, it does not promote compliment activation. To the contrary, it produces a surface that is less biologically active than Polystyrene (PS) and most other materials to which it would be applied for blood contacting devices.<br>
It is anticipated that it will be possible to bind higher amounts of biologically active Factor H to material surfaces than has previously been achieved using alternative methods. A previous study compared the amounts of Factor H bound to surfaces that displayed either pyridyl disulfide groups or sulfhydryl groups. Both surfaces were prepared by reacting a polyamine modified PS with N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP) and the latter was obtained by subsequently treating the surface with dithiothreitol (DTT). It was found that greater amounts of Factor H bound to the material that was modified with SPDP only. In spite of this, the overall biological activity was lower. These results suggest that the conformation of Factor H on the two surfaces differed and that the SPDP modified surface caused a decrease in the biological activity of bound Factor H. PDS groups are more reactive toward free cysteines in factor H and could result in greater coupling efficiency. However, the SPDP modified surface, is also likely to be more hydrophobic and for this reason, it could result in greater amounts of nonspecifically bound proteins as well as a decrease in Factor H activity due to strong interfacial forces between the protein and the material. Using the EGAP approach described herein, it is possible to incorporate PDS groups at the material surface and thereby, achieve high coupling efficiencies without producing a hydrophobic or potentially denaturing surface.<br>
Tethering Factor H to materials using EGAP decreases steric hindrance by incorporating a flexible spacer between the protein and the material. This makes it more accessible for binding to target proteins in blood or plasma.<br>
The EGAP coating produces a highly hydrated brushlike layer at the material surface that effectively buffers the Factor H from the material. This prevents denaturation and preserves the native protein conformation and activity.<br>
The EGAP coating prevents nonspecific protein adsorption. In blood and plasma there are many proteins that when adsorbed onto an artificial material can promote complement activation. For example, when fibrinogen adsorbs onto a material surface, it changes conformation such that it signals for the activation of EGAP prevents this type of interaction and thereby minimizes the risk of immune system activation. When combined with Factor H, the system prevents initial activation and then incorporates a backup, being Factor H that can down regulate any activation that might occur during an ECC procedure.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 DERIVATIZATION OF FACTOR H TO INCORPORATE<br>
SULFHYDRYL REACTIVE GROUP<br>
Factor H was incubated with various concentrations of N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP) ranging from 7 to 67% at room temperature for 1 hour. Unbound SPDP was removed by dialysis. The activities SPDP modified factor H samples were measured and compared to that of unmodified factor H by measuring the ability of factor H to act as a cofactor to factor I. Factor I is another regulator of complement activation that inactivates C3b by cleaving it into inactive C3b (iC3b) and then into C3c and C3dg. This function of factor I is dependent on the presence of active factor H. The activities of the various solutions of modified factor H were thus determined by combining them with C3b and factor I and subsequently measuring the levels of degradation of C3b as follows: Aliquots of 10 ug C3b and 0.6 ug factor I were incubated together with factor H samples in the concentrations of 0.5, 1 &amp; 2, ug for 60 min at 37°C. The reactions were terminated by boiling the samples in reducing electrophoresis sample buffer. The samples were then run on SDS-PAGE. An aliquot containing 10 ng of undigested C3b was added as a control to each gel. The gels were Coomassie stained, scanned and the amount of undigested alfa-prime chain of C3b in each sample was evaluated using NIH-image quant.<br>
The results are shown in Figure 1. The ratio of SPDP to factor H and the number of samples tested for each data point are given in the legend. The results<br>
indicate that Factor H is unaffected after treatment with 7% SPDP, but loses its activity gradually at higher concentrations. At 28% SPDP or higher, a totally inactive factor H is obtained, while concentrations between 25% and 7% yield partial inactivation.<br>
EXAMPLE 3A<br>
IMMOBILIZATION OF FACTOR H ON SUBSTRATE WITH EGAP AND HETEROBIFUNCTIONAL CROSSLINKER<br>
Factor H is activated using a heterobifunctional crosslinker and then coupled to a substrate or device that is coated with EGAP. The combination of Factor H and EGAP on the surface of the substrate or device acts to down regulate complement activation.<br>
A device or substrate is coated with Factor H by covering the device surface with a solution containing 0.1 to 4% of EGAP in water or buffer. This may be accomplished using a dip coating method, for example. After a coating period of 30 minutes to 24 hours, the substrate is washed using water or water containing buffer salts. Factor H is activated using a heterobirunctional crosslinker that is reactive towards amine groups, for example, and that incorporates a functional group that can be used to couple directly to the pyridyl disulfide group (PDS) present on EGAP. One such commercially available crosslinker is N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP). The crosslinker incorporates pyridyl disulfide groups on the protein that can be reduced to yield sulfhydryl groups that will react directly with EGAP. Factor H is reacted with SDPD in phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 for 30-60 minutes and then purified using a PD-10 column. The activated protein is treated with 25 mM DTT in acetate buffer, pH 4.5. It is purified using a PD-10 column where it is also exchanged into phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The product is incubated with the EGAP coated substrate for a period of 2-24 hours followed by washing with buffer. Controls are prepared as described in Example 1. The amount of Factor H that is bound to the surface is determined by enzyme immunoassay using a commercially available biotinylated anti-factor H in conjunction with HRP modified streptavidin for detection.<br>
The modified substrate is evaluated to determine the ability of the surface bound factor H to inhibit complement activation when it comes into contact with whole blood, plasma or serums described in Example 1.<br>
EXAMPLE 3B<br>
IMMOBILIZATION OF FACTOR H ON SUBSTRATE WITH EGAP AND HETEROBIFUNCTIONAL CRQSSLINKER<br>
Factor H was activated using a heterobifunctional crosslinker, SPDP, and then coupled to an EGAP coated substrate. Using EGAP, it was possible to immobilize factor H in a dose dependant manner.<br>
Substrates were coated with Factor H by covering them with a solution containing 1% of EGAP in water. After a coating period of 24 hours, substrates were washed with water. Control samples were prepared by substituting PLURONIC F108 for EGAP using the same procedure. Factor H was activated using a heterobifunctional crosslinker that is reactive towards amine groups and that incorporates a functional group that can be used to couple directly to the pyridyl disulfide group (PDS) present on EGAP. In this example, N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP) was used. Factor H was reacted with SDPD in PBS, pH 7.5 for 30-60 minutes and then purified using a PD-10 column. The crosslinker effectively incorporated pyridyl disulfide groups on the protein. The EGAP coated surface was reduced by incubation with 25 mM DTT for 30 minutes and then washed taking care not to expose the surface to air. Immediately after washing, the substrate was reacted with different concentrations of the SPDP modified factor H for a period of 2-24 hours and finally, washed with buffer. The amount of Factor H that was bound to the surface was determined by enzyme immunoassay using a biotinylated anti-factor H in conjunction with HRP modified streptavidin for detection.<br>
The results are shown in Figure 2 and indicate that factor H is effectively bound to the surface in a dose dependant manner. Based on the low levels of factor H bound to F108 coated control samples (see Figure 3 (E)), it is clear that the coupling to EGAP-coated surfaces is specifically mediated by functional groups on<br>
EGAP.<br>
In a previous study, it was found that Factor H could be applied to materials to down regulate complement activation. However, the method used to conjugate factor H to the material was, in of its self, complement activating. Coating a material with EGAP produces the necessary sites for conjugating Factor H, however, it does not promote compliment activation. To the contrary, it produces a surface that is less biologically active than Polystyrene (PS) and most other materials to which it would be applied for blood contacting devices.<br><br>
It is anticipated that it will be possible to bind higher amounts of biologically active Factor H to material surfaces using EGAP than has previously been achieved using alternative methods. A previous study compared the amounts of Factor H bound to surfaces that displayed either pyridyl disulfide groups or sulfhydryl groups. Both surfaces were prepared by reacting polyamine modified PS with N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP) and the latter was obtained by subsequently treating the surface with dithiothreitol (DTT). It was found that greater amounts of Factor H bound to the material that was modified with SPDP only. In spite of this, the overall biological activity was lower. These results suggest that the conformation of Factor H on the two surfaces differed and that the SPDP modified surface caused a decrease in the biological activity of bound Factor H. PDS groups are more reactive toward free thiols in factor H and could result in greater coupling efficiency. However, the SPDP modified surface, is also likely to be more hydrophobic and for this reason, it could result in greater amounts of nonspecifically bound proteins as well as a decrease in Factor H activity due to strong interfacial forces between the protein and the material. Using the EGAP approach described herein, it is possible to incorporate functional groups at the material surface with very good reactivity and thereby, achieve high coupling efficiencies without producing a hydrophobic or potentially denaturing surface.<br>
Tethering Factor H to materials using EGAP decreases steric hindrance by incorporating a flexible spacer between the protein and the material. This makes it more accessible for binding to target proteins in blood or plasma. Furthermore, the EGAP coating produces a highly hydrated brush like layer at the material surface that effectively buffers the Factor H from the material. This prevents denaturation and preserves the native protein conformation and activity.<br>
EXAMPLE 4 IMMOBILIZATION OF FACTOR H USING EGAP AND SATA CROSSLINKER<br>
Factor H was activated using a heterobifunctional crosslinker, SATA, and then coupled to a substrate or device that was coated with EGAP. The EGAP-factor H coating was effectively applied to various types of materials including polystyrene, polyether sulfone (PES), cellulose acetate (CA), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), silicone, and polyurethane (PU).<br>
Substrates or devices were coated with Factor H by covering the surface with a solution containing 1% EGAP in water. Control samples were prepared by substituting PLURONIC F108 for EGAP using the same procedure. Uncoated (UN) samples were also included for comparison. After a coating period of 24 hours, the substrates were washed with buffer. Factor H was activated using a heterobifunctional crosslinker, N-succinimidyl S-Acetylthioacetate (SATA) (Pierce Scientific). The N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester portion of this crosslinker reacts with amine groups on factor H and incorporates a protected sulfhydryl group that can be used to couple directly to the pyridyl disulfide group present on EGAP. SATA was dissolved in DMSO and then reacted with Factor H in PBS, pH 7.5 for 30-60 minutes. The activated factor H was purified using a PD-10 column. The modified groups on factor H were then deacetylated to remove the protecting group by treatment with hydroxylamine. A final purification on a PD-10 column was performed. EGAP coated substrates were incubated with the modified factor H overnight and then washed with buffer. The amount of Factor H that was bound to the surface was determined by enzyme immunoassay using a biotinylated anti-factor H in conjunction with HRP modified streptavidin for detection. The results are shown in Figure 3 below and indicate that the EGAP-factor H coating was effectively applied to various types of materials including, polyether ether sulfone (PES), polyurethane (PU), polytetraflouroethylene (PTFE), cellulose acetate (CA), and polystyrene (PS).<br>
EXAMPLE 5 REDUCED COMPLEMENT ACTIVATION ON SUBSTRATE<br>
COATED WITH EGAP AND FACTOR H. COMPLEMENT ACTIVATION IS MEASURED BY PRODUCTION OF C3A<br>
Factor H was activated using a heterobifunctional crosslinker and then coupled to an EGAP coated substrate. Coated substrates and controls were incubated with human serum and the level of complement activation was accessed by measuring the amount of C3a generated. EGAP-Factor H coated substrates produced less complement activation compared to controls. Furthermore, both EGAP and F108 coated substrates produced less complement activation than untreated substrates.<br>
A 96 well polystyrene plate was coated with Factor H by adding 300 uL of 1% EGAP in PBS to each well and placing the plate on a shaker at room<br>
temperature overnight. After coating, the substrate was washed with PBS. Factor H was reacted with 3.5% w/w SPDP in PBS, pH 7.5 for 1 hour and then purified by dialysis. The EGAP coated substrate was treated with 25 mM DTT for 1 hour. The DTT was removed and the plate was washed with PBS/EDTA pH 6.0 taking care not to expose the substrate to air. After washing, the substrate was immediately reacted with the SPDP activated factor H (100 ^ig/mL) overnight at 4° C. The factor H solution was removed and the substrate was washed with PBS. The following substrates were used as controls: untreated PS, polystyrene coated with F108 (results not shown), PS coated with EGAP, and PS coated with EGAP followed by incubation with native factor H. All substrates were incubated with human serum for different time periods up to one hour. At the end of each incubation period, EDTA was added to the serum to stop any further complement activation. The amount of C3a in each serum sample was measured by enzyme immunoassay.<br>
The results are shown in Figure 4 below and indicate that the EGAP-Factor H coating effectively inhibits the generation of C3a compared to controls. Furthermore, the EGAP coating alone reduced the generation of C3a compared to the naked substrate.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
IMMOBILIZATION OF FACTOR H ON STAINLESS STEEL AND NTTINOL<br>
WITH EGAP<br>
Factor H was activated using a heterobifunctional crosslinker, SATA, and then coupled to a stainless steel device that was pretreated followed by coating with EGAP. Factor H was effectively bound to stainless steel via EGAP.<br>
Stainless steel and nitinol stent devices were cleaned and/or pretreated followed by coating with EGAP and factor H as described in Example 4. Control samples were prepared by substituting PLURONIC F108 for EGAP using the same procedure. Factor H was activated using SATA as described in Example 4. EGAP coated substrates were incubated with the modified factor H overnight and then washed with buffer. The amount of Factor H that was bound to the surface was determined by enzyme immunoassay as described in Example 4. The results for stainless steel are shown in Figure 5 and indicate that the EGAP-factor H coating was effectively applied to the metal substrate. Furthermore, based on the low amount of factor H measured on the F108<br>
coated stainless, it is clear that the binding to EGAP coated substrates is specifically mediated by the PDS functional group on EGAP.<br>
EXAMPLE? IMMOBILIZATION OF FACTOR H ON SUBSTRATE WITH EGAP<br>
AND UNMODIFIED F1Q8<br>
Factor H is coupled to a substrate or device that is coated with a combination of EGAP and unmodified F108. The ratio of EGAP to unmodified F108 is varied in order to vary the number of reactive sites for Factor H coupling and, in turn, vary the surface density of Factor H on the substrate or device. The optimal density of Factor H is determined by measuring the substrate's ability to down regulate complement activation. Although it is likely that the highest density of Factor H possible is optimal for this system, many potentially interesting peptides and synthetic regulators of complement may have some beneficial effects but also possibly some adverse or unknown effects on related blood components including platelets and leukocytes. This EGAP approach potentially provides an optimal system for determining such interactions and how concentrations effect such interactions. Furthermore, the protein, whether produced recombinantly or by purification from natural sources, is the most expensive component of the coating. For this reason, it is beneficial to determine the least amount of protein that can be used to achieve the desired level of performance. This system provides a means to effectively determine this level and subsequently reproduce this level with a high level of confidence.<br>
A series of solutions containing the following ratios of F108 to EGAP are prepared in PBS where the total concentration of surfactant is 1%: (0:100,5:95,10:90,<br>
*<br>
25:75, 50:50, 75:25,100:0). Substrates are coated with these solutions for a period of 24 hours, followed by washing with PBS. Factor H is diluted into phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and then added to the coated substrate. After and incubation period of 2-24 hours, the substrate is washed with buffer. The amount of Factor H that is bound to each substrate is determined by enzyme immunoassay using a commercially available biotinylated anti-factor H in conjunction with HRP modified streptavidin for detection.<br>
Each substrate is evaluated to determine the ability of the surface bound factor H to inhibit complement activation when it comes into contact with whole blood, plasma, or serum as described in Example 5.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
IMMOBILIZATION OF TWO OR MORE THERAPEUTIC ENTITIES ON SUBSTRATE WITH EGAP<br>
In this example, two or more therapeutic entities are immobilized on a substrate or device using EGAP where each entity affects a different component of the immune or haemostatic system. For example, a regulator of complement might be combined with a regulator of coagulation. EGAP provides a simple method for coimmobilizing two such factors and potentially enables one to control the ratio and densities of the factors, which may very well be critical in the delivery of two or more therapeutic agents from the solid phase.<br>
Two or more types of EGAP are prepared where the end group activation process yields different types of terminal functional groups. These are referred to as EGAP-A and EGAP-B. Two or more therapeutic entities, referred to as TA and TB, are modified to react preferentially with EGAP-A and EGAP-B, respectively. EGAP-A and EGAP-B are combined in a predetermined ratio in PBS where the total concentration of EGAP is 1%. Substrates are coated with these solutions for a period of 24 hours, followed by washing with PBS. If the buffer conditions required for coupling TA to EGAP-A are the same as those required for coupling TB to EGAP-B, then TA and TB are diluted into buffer and added to the coated substrate simultaneously. If different buffer conditions are required, TA and TB are added to the substrate sequentially. Controls are prepared as described in Example 2. The amounts of TA and TB that are bound to each surface are determined by enzyme immunoassay.<br>
Each substrate is evaluated to determine the ability of the combined surface bound TA and TB to inhibit complement activation when the substrate comes into contact with whole blood as described in Example 2.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
IMMOBILIZATION OF COMPLEMENT ACTIVATION REGULATOR AND MMUNOCAPTURE AGENT ON SUBSTRATE WITH EGAP<br>
In this example a substrate or device is coated with a regulator of complement activation and an immuno capture agent using EGAP. The purpose of the immunocapture agent is to remove unwanted components from the blood such as<br>
autoimmune antibodies, immunoglobulins, immune complexes, tumor antigens, or low-density lipoproteins.<br>
In one variation, the immunocapture agent is immobilized with the regulator of complement activation as described in Example 5. In the other variation one part of the device is coated with EGAP/immunocapture agent and another part of the device is coated with EGAP/regulator of complement activation. In the later variation, the device is coated with EGAP as described in Example 2. The first selected region of the device is then incubated with a solution containing the immunocapture agent by either dip coating or controlled addition of the protein solution to a contained region of the device. The second selected region is then treated similarly with a solution containing the regulator of complement activation.<br>
EXAMPLE 10 COATING OF THERAPEUTIC ENTITIES AND UNMODIFIED F108 ON<br>
SUBSTRATE<br>
hi this example the device is coated in one region with one or more therapeutic entities as described in any one of the previous examples. The remainder of<br>
the device is coated with unmodified F108.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
DIRECT IMMOBILIZATION OF FACTOR H ON STAINLESS STEEL AND NTTINOL Stainless steel and nitinol stents were cleaned and/or pretreated followed by coating with factor H. Prior to coating, factor H was activated with SATA and purified as described in Example 4. Stents were incubated with solutions containing 100 |ig/mL of the modified factor H for two hours and then washed thoroughly with buffer. The amounts of Factor H bound to the surfaces were determined by enzyme immunoassay as described in Example 4. The results for stainless steel and nitinol are shown in Figure 6 (A) and (B), respectively. The results indicate that factor H was effectively immobilized on both metal substrates by direct adsorption.<br>
EXAMPLE 12A MODIFICATION OF METALS WITH SILANE REAGENT<br>
Substrates (Multi-Link Zeta® stents (Guidant), nitinol stents or 316L stainless steel discs Jhat were electropolished) were cleaned and preconditioned by sonicating in a basic cleaning solution (CIP 100, Steris) for 30 minutes at 37°C. Substrates were rinsed four times with purified water and 3 times with 95:5 ethanohwater. Anhydrous ethanol was heated to 40 to 50°C. An aliquot of octadecyltrimethoxysilane (ODtMOS) was added to the alcohol to obtain a 4% (v/v) solution. The silanc solution was mixed for 5 minutes at 40 to 50°C and then immediately added to samples. Samples were incubated with the silane solution with mixing for 3 hours at room temperature and then washed three times with anhydrous ethanol. Stainless steel samples were cured for 10 minutes at approximately 110-150°C and nitinol samples were cured overnight at 40 to 50°C.<br>
EXAMPLE 12B MODIFICATION OF METALS WITH SILANE REAGENT<br>

EXAMPLE 12C MODIFICATION OF METALS WITH SILANE REAGENT AND SURFACTANT<br>
Nitinol stents were cleaned and preconditioned by sonicating in a basic cleaning solution (CIP 100, Steris) for 30 minutes at 37°C. Substrates were rinsed four times with purified water and 3 times with 95:5 ethanol:water. An aliquot of octadecyltrimethoxysilane (ODtMOS) was added to 95:5 ethanohwater to obtain a 2% (v/v) solution. The silane solution was mixed for 5 minutes and then immediately added to samples at room temperature. Samples were incubated with the silane solution with<br>
mixing for 2 minutes and then washed three times with anhydrous ethanol. Samples were cured overnight at 40 to 50°C under vacuum. A subset of samples was incubated with a 1% solution of Pluronic® F108 (F108) or EGAP overnight with mixing and then washed three times with PBS.<br>
EXAMPLE 13 IMMOBILIZATION OF F108 OR EGAP ON SILANIZED METAL SUBSTRATES<br>
WITH APPLICATION OF UV LIGHT<br>
Solutions of F108 or EGAP (1%, w/v) were prepared in purified water. Silanized metal substrates were prepared as described under Example 12 and immediately transferred, while still very hot, to tubes containing F108 or EGAP solutions. The substrates were incubated in these solutions overnight, at room temperature with agitation. The samples were then either, (1) washed with water, (2) washed with water and exposed to UV light (254 nm) while covered with a minimal amount of water, or (3) exposed to UV light while covered with a minimal amount of 1% F108 or EGAP solution. For samples exposed to UV light, each sample surface was exposed to the radiation for 1.5 hours. After treatment with UV, samples were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS).<br>
EXAMPLE 14<br>
IMMOBILIZATION OF F108 OR EGAP ON SILANIZED METAL SUBSTRATES WITH APPLICATION OF E-BEAM IRRADIATION Solutions of F108 or EGAP (1%, w/v) were prepared in purified water. Silanized metal substrates were prepared as described under Example 12A or Example 12B and immediately transferred, while still very hot, to tubes containing F108 or EGAP solutions. The substrates were incubated in these solutions overnight, at room temperature with agitation. The samples were then either, (I) washed with water, (2) washed with water and exposed to electron beam irradiation (e-beam, 25 kGy) while covered with water, or (3) exposed to e-beam (25 kGy) while covered with 1% F108 or EGAP solution. After e-beam treatment, samples were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS).<br>
EXAMPLE 15A<br>
REDUCTION IN PEOTFTN ADSORPTION ON STAINLESS STEEL MODIFIED WITH SILANE AND COATED WITH F108 OR EGAP<br>
Stainless steel samples (electropolished, 316L stainless steel discs) were silanized as described in Example 12A and coated with EGAP as described in Example 13. Control samples included untreated stainless steel (UN), stainless steel that was silanized (S) as described in Example 12, stainless steel that was silanized as described in Example 12 and coated with F108 as described in Example 13 (S-HF108), and stainless steel that was silanized as described in Example 12 and coated with EGAP as described in Example 13 (S+EGAP). Two sets of samples were prepared in quadruplet where one set of samples was washed three times with water and one set of samples was washed three times with 1% SDS. All samples were washed a final three times with water and three times with PBS and then incubated with horse radish peroxidase conjugated streptavidin diluted 1:500 in PBS. After washing 3 times with wash buffer, a color solution (10 mg phenylenediamine and 10 jaL of 50% H2O2 in 40.5 mL of 35 mM citric acid 1-hydrate, 70 mM Na2HPO4-2H20) was added and allowed to develop for 5 minutes at room temperature. HzSO4 was added to stop the color reaction and the absorbance of each sample was measured at 492 nm.<br>
The protein adsorption results are displayed in Figure IX. These results show that the silane treatment alone substantially reduced protein adsorption compared to the untreated stainless steel. Substrates coated with the silane plus either F108 or EGAP resulted in significantly lower levels of protein adsorption compared to the untreated and the silane modified substrates. Silane modified and surfactant modified samples retained their protein repelling properties even after washing with SDS indicating that the coatings were stably fixed on the surface.<br>
EXAMPLE 15B<br>
REDUCTION IN PROTEIN ADSORPTION ON STAINLESS STEEL MODIFIED WITH SILANE AND COATED WITH F108 OR EGAP<br>
Stainless steel samples (electropolished, 316L stainless steel discs) were silanized as described in Example 12A or Example 12B and coated with EGAP as described in Example 13 with the exception that samples were exposed to UV for 3 hours instead of 1.5 hours. Samples were prepared in quadruplet and incubated with horse radish peroxidase conjugated streptavidin diluted 1:500 in PBS. After washing 3 times<br>
with wash buffer, a color solution (10 mg phenylenediamine and 10 uL of 50% HiOa in 40.5 mL of 35 mM citric acid 1-hydrate, 70 mM Na2HPO4-2H2O) was added and allowed to develop for 5 minutes at room temperature. HjSC^ was added to stop the color reaction and the absorbance of each sample was measured at 492 run.<br>
The protein adsorption results are displayed in Figure 8 and 9. These results show that substrates coated with silane plus either F108 or EGAP displayed significantly lower levels of protein adsorption compared to substrates modified with silane only. Furthermore, adsorbed protein levels on EGAP modified substrates were significantly lower than those on F108 coated substrates. These results support the hypothesis that the functional group on EGAP undergoes some crosslinking during the UV irradiation process that stabilizes the surfactant on the surface and thereby improves the protein repelling properties of the coating.<br>
EXAMPLE 16 IMMOBILIZATION OF BIOACTIVE COMPOUND ON SILANIZED. EGAP COATED<br>
METAL SUBSTRATES.<br>
Factor H was activated using a heterobifunctional crosslinker, N-succinimidyl S-acetylthioacetate (SATA) (Pierce Scientific). An aliquot of SATA dissolved in DMSO (10 mg/mL) was added to a solution of factor H in PBS, pH 7.5 to obtain 3.5% (w/w) SATA/factor H. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes at room temperature, after which, the SATA activated factor H was purified using a PD-10 column. The newly incorporated functional groups on factor H were then deacetylated to remove the protecting group by treatment with hydroxylamine. A hydroxylamine solution was prepared by dissolving 2.61 g of hydroxylamine hydrochloride (Pierce) and 0.698 g of Na2EDTA (Sigma) in 50 ml of 75 mM phosphate buffer (PB), pH 7.5. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.5 and purified water was added to bring the total volume to 75 mL (final concentrations 50 mM PB, 25 mM EDTA, 0.5 M Hydroxylamine, pH 7.5). A 100 ^L aliquot of the hydroxyl amine solution was added per 1 mL of activated factor H solution and allowed to react for two hours at room temperature. A final purification on a PD-10 column was performed and the recovered protein was diluted with PBS to obtain approximately 100 ug/mL. Unmodified substrates and substrates<br>
prepared as described under Examples 12A or 12B and Example 13 or Example 14 were incubated with the modified factor H overnight and then washed with buffer.<br>
The amount of Factor H bound to each substrate was measured by enzyme immunoassay. Substrates were washed three times with wash buffer (20 mM phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.02% (v/v) Antifoam, pH 7.5) and then incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C.with blocking buffer (1% (w/v) BSA in wash buffer). After blocking, substrates were washed 3 times with wash buffer and then incubated with a 50:50 mixture of anti-factor H and biotinylated anti-factor H diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer for 30 minutes at 37°C. Substrates were washed three times with wash buffer and then incubated with horse radish peroxidase modified streptavidin diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer for 30 minutes at 37°C. After washing 3 times with wash buffer, a color solution (10 mg phenylenEdiamine and 10 nL of 30% H2O2 in 40.5 mL of 35 mM citric acid 1-hydrate, 70 mM Na2HPO4-2H2O) was added and allowed to develop for 5 minutes at room temperature. H2SO4 was added to stop the color reaction and the absorbance of each sample was measured at 492 nm.<br>
Figures 10, 11, and 12 show the EIA results for factor H immobilization on Stainless steel modified according to Example 12B and Example 14, stainless steel modified according to Example 12A and Example 13, and nitinol modified according to Example 12C, respectively. These results show that the factor H is effectively immobilized on both stainless steel and nitinol using the procedures described herein.<br>
EXAMPLE 17 REDUCTION DSf C3A PRODUCTION ON NITINOL COATED WITH EGAP AND<br>
FACTORH<br>
Nitinol stents were silanized as described in Example 12 and then incubated overnight in either 1% EGAP or F108 in water. The samples were washed three times with water and three times with PBS and then coated with factor H as described in Example 16 (EGAP+FH and F108+FH, respectively). Control samples included untreated nitinol (UN), nitinol coated with factor H as described in Example 16 (UN+FH), nitinol silanized as described in Example 12 (S), nitinol silanized as described in Example 12 and coated with factor H as described in Example 16 (S+FH), nitinol<br>
silanized as described in Example 12, coated with 1% F108 overnight, washed three times with water and three times with PBS (F108). All stent samples were prepared in triplicate. Nine parts human serum were combined with 1 part Owren's veronal buffered saline (VBS). Stents were incubated with 1 mL of the diluted serum in polypropylene tubes for 30 minutes at 37°C. After 30 minutes, samples were placed on ice and 1 mL of ice cold veronal buffered saline containing 40 mM EDTA (VBS-EDTA) was immediately added. The serum was removed from each sample and stored at -80°C. The amount of C3a in each serum sample was measured using a C3a enzyme immunoassay kit (Quidel) according to the manufacturer's directions.<br>
The results of the C3a assay are shown Figure 13 and show that the Factor H coating produces a benefit in terms of reducing C3a production. These results also indicate that the silane alone reduces C3a production.<br>
EXAMPLE 18<br>
REDUCTION IN COMPLEMENT CONVERTASE ATTACHMENT ON STAINLESS STEEL TREATED WITH SILANE AND COATED WITH EGAP AND FACTOR H<br>
Stainless steel samples (electropolished, 316L stainless steel discs) were silanized as described in Example 12, coated with EGAP as described in Example 13, and coated with factor H as described in Example 16 (EGAP+FH). Control samples included untreated stainless steel (UN) and stainless steel that was silanized as described in Example 12 and coated with EGAP as described in Example 13 (S+EGAP). All samples were prepared in triplicate and evaluated for their ability to activate complement when incubated with human serum. Complement activation was evaluated by measuring the formation of complement convertases on the sample surface as follows: Nine parts human serum were combined with one part VBS. A 300 \iL aliquot of the diluted serum was added to each sample in a polypropylene tube and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. After removing the serum, samples were washed with PBS and transferred to clean polypropylene tubes. An assay solution was prepared that contained a peptide that could be cleaved by the complement convertase. Upon cleavage of this peptide, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) was released to produce a fluorescent signal. A 500 f^M solution of the peptide (Boc-Leu-Gly-Arg-AMC (Bachem)) was prepared in PBS. Samples were incubated with the peptide solution for 24 hours at 37°C. The assay solutions were then<br>
transferred to a black 96 well PS plate and the fluorescence was measured at 360nm excitation, 460 run emission. An AMC standard (Molecular Probes) was used to prepare a standard curve for calibration.<br>
The results of the CCA assay are displayed in Figure 14 and show that the Factor H coating provides a benefit in terms of reducing the number of complement convertases formed on the surface. From this figure, one can also see that the silane plus EGAP coating alone reduces the number of complement convertases formed on the surface. These results indicate that the coatings described herein reduce complement activation on stainless steel.<br>
EXAMPLE 19<br>
SUBSTRATES COATED WITH EGAP AND FACTOR H ARE NONTHROMBOGENIC<br>
Substrates were coated with EGAP or F108 by covering them with a solution containing 1% of EGAP or F108 in water for a 24 hour period followed by washing with PBS. Factor H was activated using a heterobifunctional crosslinker that is reactive towards amine groups and that incorporates a functional group that can be used to couple to the pyridyl disulfide group (PDS) present on EGAP. In this example, N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP) was used. Factor H was reacted with SPDP in PBS,.pH 7.5 for 30-60 minutes and then purified using a PD-10 column. One set of EGAP coated surfaces was reduced by incubation with 25 mM DTT for 30 minutes and then washed taking care not to expose the surface to air. After washing, the substrates were either left in buffer or immediately reacted with the SPDP modified factor H for 2 hours and finally, washed with buffer.<br>
Whole blood was collected into 50 ml Falcon tubes containing heparin (1 U/mL). All items which came in contact with the blood (except the test surfaces) were heparin coated (Corline) to minimize activation. The blood was transferred to the wells of a slide chamber and covered with the test surface (F108, EGAP or EGAP plus factor H coated substrates). The chambers were rotated vertically and after incubation EDTA was added. Two assays were performed on the resulting blood samples. The numbers of platelets were counted and the levels of thrombin antithrombin (TAT) were measured. The results of platelet counts and TAT levels are shown in Figures 15 and 16, respectively. The lowest platelet loss was seen with the surfaces coated with EGAP plus<br><br>
factor H and surfaces coated with nonreduced EGAP, closely followed by reduced EGAP. The TAT levels were in agreement with the platelet loss with the lowest levels for EGAP plus factor H and nonreduced EGAP, followed by reduced EGAP. All EGAP coated surfaces performed better in both assays than F108 coated surfaces. These results strongly suggest that the EGAP-surfaces (with or without factor H) are non-thrombogenic.<br>
EXAMPLE 20<br>
APLICATION OF SMOOTH. THIN COATING WITH BIOACTIVE COMPOUND THAT DOES NOT CRACK OR PEEL UPON EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION OF<br>
A DEVICE<br>
Stainless steel stent, (Multi-Link Zeta® stents (Guidant)) were silanized as described in Example 12, coated with EGAP as described in Example 13, and coated with factor H as described in Example 16. After application of the coating, stents were crimped onto balloon delivery devices and rexpanded. Reexpanded stents were removed from the balloon delivery devices and evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).<br>
Figure 17 is an SEM image of a coated stent at SOX that shows the coating is thin and homogenous. Figure 18 is a SEM image of the inner diameter of a stent strut at 500X that shows that the coating does not crack or peal after crimping and reexpansion.<br>
