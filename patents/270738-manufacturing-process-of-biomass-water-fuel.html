3. PREMABLE TO THE DESCRIPTION:<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br>
Field of the invention <br>
The present invention relates to manufacturing process for preparing Biomass Water Fuel from, but not limited to, all types of Agro wastes  agro – by products and any organic wastes i.e., sewage sludge, landfill organics, etc. More particularly, the present invention relates to a manufacturing process for preparing Biomass Water Fuel from high moisture carbonaceous materials such as Biomass. <br><br>
Back ground and prior art of the invention <br>
Coal and Oil are generally used as fuels or starting materials in the chemical industry.  Nearly half of the total coal produced all over the world is low rank coal (LRC) such as sub bituminous, lignitic and brown coals However, the coal usage is under attack by the global warming/climate change alarmists due to the quantity of CO2 released. Further, the energy demand has increased significantly and increased the demand for steam coal, especially for low Sulphur and low ash Low Rank Coals. The total current world Oil production is excess of 85 million barrels/day. It is expected to rise to 118 mm barrels/ day in 2030. Strong growth in China’s oil demand expected to be 110 mm barrels/day and India’s Oil demand will be 80 mm barrels/day same period. Hence, BWF/ LRCWF (Biomass Water Fuel/ Low Rank Coal Water Fuel) are the only affordable alternate fuel solution to the huge shortfall in oil supplies which can lead towards energy independence and price stability.  Because, the alternative energy sources including fuel cells, nuclear, and renewable energy sources, i.e. solar, wind, and geothermal, are much costlier, based on the current technologies than coal fired generators. Even with substantial government subsidies all the alternative sources combined will generate only a small fraction of the projected power requirements, so fossil fuels will remain by far the largest energy resource for the foreseeable future. <br>
Hence, it can be stated that there is need for an efficient process to convert biomass and other organic wastes into a combustible liquid fuel, i.e. biomass-water fuel (BWF).  BWF will be a sustainable, affordable and an alternate renewable fuel with a reduced carbon footprint, and thereby it reduces adverse environmental impacts and related issues across the world.	 <br><br><br>
Object of the invention <br>
The main object of this invention is to provide a manufacturing process for preparing stable and easily transportable liquid fuel from renewable sources like high moisture carbonaceous materials from agro as well as organic wastes. Accordingly, the present invention provides a manufacturing process for converting Biomass into Biomass Water Fuel which is a pumpable, non hazardous, non toxic and low cost alternative to petroleum derived fuels that can use existing oil and coal infrastructure for handling, storage and transportation. <br><br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a process for preparing such an alternative renewable fuel which is environmentally beneficial. Accordingly, BWF combustion offers environmental benefits over bulk coal or oil firing by reducing uncontrolled emissions of dust, NOX, and SOX as the water in BWF modulates combustion and reduces flame temperatures during the combustion. <br><br>
Yet another object of the invention is the provision of more effective methods of homogenizing biomass and other non-coal carbonaceous materials for producing high grade, homogeneous slurry fuels for energy related applications. <br><br>
Still another object of this invention is to provide process for preparation of such a fuel at a fraction of the cost of oil on an equivalent energy basis.<br><br>
 Summary of the Invention <br>
Present invention discloses a process for permanently reducing the inherent water content of biomass or any high moisture carbonaceous wastes by means of hydrothermal treatment. In this process biomass water slurry is heated to feedstock specific temperatures and the corresponding saturated steam pressure to permanently reduce the inherent moisture.  Following hydrothermal treatment the product is reformulated into a stable BWF that can be used in the power plants and industrial boilers as substitute for petro-fuels. <br><br><br><br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
In one embodiment, the process of preparing Biomass Water Fuel from any high moisturize carbonaceous material involves primarily three key unit operations namely, a pressurized high speed shearing to create a biomass slurry, a Hydrothermal (HT) treatment; and a dewatering and Biomass Water Fuel formulation. In the said HT process Biomass slurry formed by means of high speed shearing is hydro thermally treated as dilute slurry at biomass specific temperatures beginning as 240° C, but not exceeding 300° C, and the corresponding saturated steam pressure, not exceeding 2000 psi, for under 10 minutes, being resource specific. Water is removed via expansion and expulsion by CO2 and oils being hydrophobic are retained on the Biomass surface in the pressurized aqueous environment. The overall process, which resembles as coalification, can be represented as removing the inherent moisture and reusing this moisture as the carrier fluid. The Biomass is also upgraded to a higher heating value by HT treatment with the release of carboxyl groups and any alkali species in biomass are also released into the aqueous phase and can be removed by washing the product during the final mechanical dewatering to reduce the potential for boiler tube fouling.<br>
Low-rank coal (LRC) may be added to increase the energy content of the final product and to aid mechanical high shear dispersion and hydrothermal processing. Other non-coal carbonaceous materials (e.g., wood, wood wastes, agriculture by products, plantation crops, municipal and industrial solid and liquid wastes, and other biomass materials) may also be added as a method of improving the products of hydrothermal treatment. In this embodiment, the coal and other carbonaceous material are preferably mixed and subjected to hydrothermal treatment as a blend. High speed dispersion/homogenization is especially applicable to these fuels, as it successfully breaks down the cellulose structures that hinder its ability to form high density, low viscosity, and stable slurries. <br>
	However, significant improvements have been raised through the identification of more ideal processing conditions. Through their extensive testing, the inventors have been able to optimize the hydrothermal treatment process to maximize the desirable slurry characteristics.<br>
	These optimization efforts have determined that performing the hydrothermal treatment at a temperature within the range of 240° C to 300° C to produce slurries with the highest solid loadings and the best rheological properties while allowing recovery of most of energy density from the original feedstock.  <br>
	In this Following HT, biomass can be formulated into pumpable, combustible biomass water fuels used as renewable substitute for fossil fuel. During such aforesaid process, the wood vinegar extracted as a by product can also be used as fertilizers and other agricultural and chemical ingredients purposes. <br><br>
