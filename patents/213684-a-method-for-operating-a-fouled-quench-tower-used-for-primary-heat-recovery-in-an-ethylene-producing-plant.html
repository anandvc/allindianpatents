2. APPLICANT<br>
(a)	Name: Dorf Ketal Chemicals India Pvt. Ltd<br>

The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be<br>
performed.	<br><br><br>
A METHOD FOR OPERATING A FOULED QUENCH TOWER USED FOR PRIMARY HEAT RECOVERY IN AN ETHYLENE PRODUCING PLANT<br>
BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method of operating a primary fractionator, also termed a quench tower, in an ethylene plant with anti-foulants, particularly defoamers.<br>
In the manufacture of lighter hydrocarbon products such as ethylene, heavier hydrocarbons such as naphtha or diesel oil are cracked in pyrolysis heaters at temperatures of approximately 850Â°C to form mixtures of smaller molecules including, but not limited to, ethylene, propylene, and butadiene. Such mixtures, commonly termed cracked gases, are cooled in various stages of an ethylene plant until they are separated in the fractionation section of the ethylene plant.<br>
During primary heat recovery, the cracked gases pass through and are cooled by a series of heat exchangers, also termed transfer line exchangers, before being quenched with a heavy oil. This heavy oil, which is known as quench oil or bottoms quench oil, accumulates in the bottom of the primary fractionator. The primary fractionator contains varying components of fuel oil species ranging from the bottoms of the column to the beginning of what is called the rectification section of the column. The rectification section of the column is prone to severe fouling problems related to species such as styrene, indene, di-vinyl benzene, alpha-methyl styrene, indene derivatives, naphthalene and other higher ring compound derivatives.<br>
The polymerization products of these species deposit at a very rapid rate not only<br>
on upper tray surfaces, but also beneath tray surfaces. Due to this fouling problem,<br>
|2<br><br>
an increase in column pressure drop along with reduction in fractionation efficiencies are experienced. Consequently, the quality of gasoline condensing in the quench water tower and also the quality of fuel oil made from the system are negatively effected. Typically, the problem of fouling in the rectification section is also accompanied by poor viscosity control in the bottom of the quench oil tower due to improper operations of the primary fractionator. The deposition of the fouling species, commonly as polymers, obstructs the vapor and liquid flow inside the fractionator and due to the reduced surface area available, the environment is conducive to increased froth/foam generation in the column. The presence of foam further increases the pressure drop and results in entrainment of higher boiling point products into the lighter products and vice versa. Due to excessive foaming, the column pressure drop increases very rapidly and is a major reason for reduced unit efficiencies.<br>
As fouling continues to occur, the rate of foaming also increases in the column resulting in plant operators having to reduce unit feed rates significantly and, ultimately, shut down the plant for cleaning the primary fractionator.<br>
The present invention provides a method to operate primary fractionators which are fouled due to polymer deposition by providing an appropriate chemical agent to extend run length of the primary fractionator.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates data for Example 1 in which the feed rate, reflux rate, and column pressure of a primary fractionation column are plotted against time.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates data for Example 2 collected at in which column pressure for a quench tower is plotted against time.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention includes methods for reducing foam in primary fractionators which are experiencing diminished operation efficiencies due to deposits of polymerized hydrocarbon species. The invention comprises the step of adding a foam reducing amount of a foam reducing composition at the primary fractionator. A reduction in foaming is achieved whereby the operational efficiency of the process is improved based upon operation parameters including, but not limited to, liquid-gas contact ratio, product top temperature, pressure differentials, gasoline end point or combinations thereof.<br>
The preferred foam reducing composition is a polysiloxane. A representative polysiloxane useful in the present invention is dimethyl polysiloxane. This is a commercially available chemical which can be purchased, for example, from Dorf Ketal Chemicals India Pvt. Ltd. Other suitable foam reducing compositions include, but are not limited to, ethylene oxide propylene oxide copolymers, fatty<br>
acid ethoxylates, poly-iso-butylenes and fatty acid esters. Suitable examples of<br>
|4<br><br><br>
these compounds are also available from Dorf Ketal Chemicals India Pvt. Ltd.<br>
The foam reducing composition may be added to the process in neat form, or in any suitable solvent. Representative solvents may be aromatic in character and include, but are not limited to. toluene, xylene, naphtha. It is preferred that the foam reducing composition be applied either upstream of the particular site experiencing foaming problems or directly to the site of the foaming problem. Specifically, the deposit reducing composition may be added continuously or periodically to the primary fractionator reflux. Primary fractionators may themselves include internal components including ripple trays, sieve trays, bubble cap trays, valve trays.<br>
The preferred polysiloxane described above may be applied to the process at end use concentrations ranging from 0.000 I % to 0.1 % with 0.0005% to 0.0025% being the preferred range (all percentages herein are expressed on a weight/weight basis). These percentages convert into working dosage rates of 1 part per million to about 1000 parts per million hydrocarbon. Specific dosages may be determined by the conditions existing in the particular process. Although the most preferred range for a polysiloxane is provided, it is understood that the present invention is not to be limited by the specific compound or concentration set forth herein. It is further envisioned that the present invention may be applied to the process along<br>
with   other   hydrocarbon   treatment   agents   such   as   corrosion   inhibiting<br>
|5<br><br>
compositions.<br>
The following examples are provided in order to more clearly illustrate the present invention, and while being illustrative, are in no way meant to be construed as limiting the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
An ethylene production plant utilizing naphtha in the production of light hydrocarbons including ethylene, propylene, and butadiene experienced fouling of the primary fractionator resulting in reduction of column efficiencies even when operated at lower than normal feed rates. Considering the loss of column efficiencies indicated by higher column pressure drop and increased gasoline end point even at 20% reduced plant feed rates, the plant operators contemplated shutting the unit down to clean the column.<br>
However, the present invention was practiced on the respective process in order to achieve acceptable operational parameters and the utility of the present invention was thusly demonstrated. An anti-foaming agent comprising a polysiloxane was injected along with the reflux to the column. The particular agent was dimethyl polysiloxane available from Dorf Ketal Chemicals India Pvt. Ltd. and was fed into the column so as to achieve a working concentration of approximately 100 parts per million.<br>
|6<br><br>
Within a few hours of using the anti-foam ing agent, column pressure drop was reduced as shown in Fig. I. It was observed that during the fouled condition, the gasoline end point had increased by 20Â°c which was also reflected in the color of the respective gasoline. The fouled condition resulted in a brownish colored gasoline in contrast to gasoline normally having a yellowish green coloration. After the polysiloxane compound was injected into the retlux, the plant operators subsequently observed that the color of the gasoline was restored to its normal yellowish green color, along with reduction in gasoline end point indicating improvement of the column operations.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates the data associated with this experiment wherein time is provided on the X axis and the kilograms per hour of feed rate and reflux mass are provided on the left hand Y axis. In addition, pressure drop in kilograms per centimeter2 is provided on the right hand Y axis. Arrow A indicates the initial injection of the polysiloxane compound into the reflux. Column pressure was measured, as indicated on the X axis. A dramatic reduction in column pressure is evident from the data presented in graphic form.<br>
Example 2<br>
A plant, experienced fouling problems due to increased column pressure drop.<br>
The pressure drop in this plant operated at normal values of 0.07 to 0.08<br>
kilograms per centimeter2. However, the fouling problems resulted in much<br>
elevated values ranging from 0.135 to 0.15 kilograms per centimeter2. With the 7<br><br>
fouling problem, reduced feed rates and reflux rates were observed although the pressure drop in the column remained high.<br>
In order to avoid a costly shut down of the manufacturing facility, the plant operators utilized the present invention wherein polysiloxane was injected into the quench oil tower at an injection rate of 10 to 20 parts per million based on column reflux rates. The specific polysiloxane utilized was identical to that of Example 1.<br>
Within hours after the initial injection of the anti-foam, operators observed column pressure reduced to a value of approximately 0.109 kilograms per centimeter2 while the column feed rates improved from 175 tons per hour of naphtha to 184 tons per hour of naphtha. During the same time period, reflux rates increased from 20 tons per hour to 30 tons per hour. The improvement in column operations are shown in Fig. 2 in which sampling times are indicated along the X axis and column pressures are indicated in kilograms per centimeter2 on the Y axis.<br>
While the invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will appreciate that certain substitutions, alterations and omissions may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention. Accordingly, the foregoing description is meant to be exemplary only and should not limit the scope of the invention set forth in the following claims.<br>
