BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to coating die which is used for drawing an optical fiber, and to an optical fiber drawing method therefor.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
It is common for a plurality of resin coating to be applied to an optical fiber from a viewpoint of maintaining mechanical strength and "transmission characteristics. An ultraviolet curable resin having relatively lower Young' s modulus are applied to an optical fiber as a first coating layer and an ultraviolet curable resin having relatively higher Youngs modulus and a second coating layer.<br>
An optical fiber drawing apparatus for applying an ultraviolet curable resin is explained with reference to FIG. 2 as follows.<br>
In FIG. 2, a reference numeral 1 indicates an optical fiber. The optical fiber 1 is formedbyperformingheat-meltingprocessing so as to extend a raw material 2 of an optical fiber in a drawing furnace 3. A liquid first ultraviolet curable resin is applied to an outside of the optical fiber 1 by passing the optical fiber<br><br>
2<br>
1 through a first resin coating apparatus 4. Furthermore, by passing the optical fiber 1 through a first hardening apparatus 5 (UV lamp) for irradiation with ultraviolet light, the resin is hardened; thus, a first coating resin is formed on the optical fiber 1.<br>
Consequently, a second coating resin layer such as an ultraviolet curable resin is formed on the first coating resin layer by passing the resin-coated optical fiber through a second resin coating apparatus 6 and a second hardening apparatus 7. A resin-coated optical fiber 8 is wound by a winding apparatus 9. The resin coating process is performed vertically.<br>
Recently, it is required that the productivity of the optical fiber be improved in accordance with an increase in demand there for. In particular, high speed ultraviolet curable resin coating processing is required to be realized. However, if high speed coating processing is realized, there is a problem in that ultraviolet curable resins cannot be applied stably and in uniform thickness.<br>
For a solution to the above-mentioned problem, a coating process which is described in Japanese Examined Patent Application, Second Publication No. Hei 7-5336 is known. According to this coating process, defects in the coating resin is prevented from occurring in coating die by controlling the application temperature of the liquid ultraviolet curable resin and by<br><br>
3<br>
controlling the viscosity of a region of the liquid ultraviolet curable resin, in which shear rate is slower than a critical shear rate, in the applying temperature with in a predetermined range. In this coating process, it is disclosed that the viscosity is in a range of 500 cps to 3000 cps in an application temperature of 60°C to 100°C in a region in which shear rate in the applying temperature is slower than a critical shear rate.<br>
However, as disclosed in the above-mentioned prior art document, shear rate of an ordinary ultraviolet curable resin is in a range of 104 to 105 sec-1 If the drawing process is performed while the shear rate must be slower than the critical shear rate, the line speed cannot be high. If a high speed drawing such as a line speed of 10 m/sec is performed, interfacial shear rate becomes quite high; thus, it easily becomes higher than its critical shear rate.<br>
On the other hand, designing aspect of coating die becomes important along with an increasing drawing speed of the optical fiber. Japanese Examined Patent Application, Second Publication No. Hei 7-91092 is an example of such design for coating die. A coating die which is disclosed in this prior art document is explained with reference to FIGS. 3, 4, and 5 as follows.<br>
In FIG. 3, reference numeral 1 is an optical fiber. A resin 12 is applied to the optical fiber 1 while the optical fiber 1 is passing through a guiding die 10 and a die 11. Reference numeral<br><br>
4<br>
13 indicates a holder for supporting the guiding die 10 an the die 11. Reference numeral 14 indicates a guiding die hole. Reference numeral 15 indicates a bottom face of the guiding die. Reference numeral 16 indicates a tapered section of the die 11. Reference numeral 17 indicates an exit hole of the die 11. Reference numeral 18 indicates a top face of the die 11. A reference numeral 19 indicates a meniscus.<br>
In FIGS. 4A and 5A, the guiding die 10, a die 11, and shapes thereof are shown. In the above-mentioned prior art document, the relationship betweenB andH in FIG. 4, the relationship between G and C, the relationship between G and D, and the range of angle a   are disclosed.<br>
In the above-mentioned prior art document, a case in which a tapered section of the die 11 has two steps by modifying a structure shown in FIG. 4B is mentioned. However, the detail of such structure is not disclosed. Also, a case in which a tapered section of the dies 11 has a curve by modifying a structure shown in FIG. 5B is mentioned. However, the detail of such structure is not disclosed.<br>
Also, the required shape of the die 11 is different between a case in which a resin is applied to an optical fiber and a case in which a resin is further applied to the resin-coated optical fiber.  Furthermore, in actual drawing operation, while the drawing speed increases from a low speed such as a starting speed<br><br>
5<br>
(for example, 0.5 m/sec) to a high speed in which a product is drawn on an operational basis (for example, 30 m/sec), temperature of an optical fiber which is coated by a resin is not fixed. Therefore, coating conditions becomes unstable to a certain degree. In order to obtain a high quality optical fiber, coating operation must be performed stably so as to avoid slipping phenomena of resin in each drawing speed range.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
An embodiment of the present invention is explained with reference to the drawings as follows.<br>
In FIG. 1, an example of an optical fiber drawing die according to the present invention is shown.<br>
The drawing die is used in a first resin coating apparatus 4 which is contained in an optical fiber drawing apparatus shown in FIG. 2 and a second resin coating apparatus 6.<br>
The shape of the drawing die is determined in accordance with dimensions A, B, D, and an angle C shown in FIG. 1A, and dimensions A, B, D, and an angle C and E shown in FIG. 1B. These dimensions and angles are determined in accordance with an interfacial shear rate of the optical fiber which is to be coated with a coating resin.<br>
The basic formula for calculating the interfacial shear rate is as follows.<br>
First, a solution of a Navier-Stokes equation Fl is<br><br>
10<br>
calculated by using a boundary condition according to formulae F2 and F3. <br><br>
Here, v indicates a resin speed,  r indicates a position<br>
in a radial direction, pindicates a pressure value.  z indicates<br>
a position in an optical fiber under conditions that a forward<br>
direction is a positive direction. Rf indicates a radius of an<br>
optical fiber. Vf indicates speed of an optical fiber. Rd<br>
indicates a radius of a die (a function of Z).<br>
A solution of the function of Z can be represented by a formula 4.<br><br>
The interfacial shear rate can be represented by a formula 5 and formula F6 as follows.<br><br>
Here, a value of the right-hand side of the formula F6 such as dp/dz is unknown. In order to obtain a value of dp/dz, it is necessary to determine a pressure value Pini at an entrance of an upper part of the die and a pressure value Pout at an exit<br><br>
11<br>
of lower part of the die. Otherwise, it is necessary to introduce<br>
a flow amount Q. That is, if formulae F7 and F8 substitute a formula F6; thus, a formula F9 is obtained.<br><br>
Here, integration range in the z axis direction is in a range in which a resin does not produce vortex flow.<br>
When an optical fiber made from a glass is coated, interfacial shear rate is calculatedby substituting a pressure value of coating resin in a coating pot into a Pini at an entrance of top of a die. When a resin-coated optical fiber is coated, an interfacial shear rate is calculated in accordance with a flow amount of resin which is calculated according to a coating diameter of resin which is already coated.<br>
. As a result of an experiment which is executed for the present embodiment, a range of stable interfacial shear rate is -1.5 X 105 to 0 sec-1 when an optical fiber which is made from a glass is coated by resin. Also a range of stable interfacial shear rate is -3 X 105 to 2X105 sec-1 when a resin-coated optical fiber is coated.<br>
An optical fiber drawing apparatus according to the present<br><br>
12<br>
invention uses a die having -1.5 X 10s to 0 sec-1 of interfacial shear rate in a first resin coating apparatus 4 for performing a resin coating operation on an optical fiber. An optical fiber drawing apparatus according to the present invention also uses a die having -3 X 105 to 2X105 to sec-1 of interfacial shear rate in a second resin coating apparatus 6 for performing a resin coating operation to a resin-coated optical fiber. That is, such a structure is employed so as to improve drawing efficiency by having a die for coating an optical fiber by resin and a die for coating a resin-coated optical fiber respectively. The shapes of the die are different each other.<br>
Also, an optical fiber drawing method according to the present invention uses the above-mentioned optical fiber drawing apparatus to perform a drawing operation for an optical fiber. By this method, it is possible to realize stable resin applying operation and productive drawing operation in an resin coating apparatus even in a high drawing speed.<br>
Hereinafter, an example of a shape of an optical fiber drawing die and calculation of interfacial shear rate is shown as follows.<br>
Example 1<br>
In an example for performing a resin coating operation on an optical fiber made from glass, an example of calculation of interfacial shear rate and drawing operation by using dies (types<br><br>
13<br>
1 and 2) shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B are performed under conditions that coating pressure is 0.3 Mpa, resin viscosity is 0.9, 1.5, and 2. 0 Pasec, a glass diameter is 125 µm, and a finished-coated diameter is 190 µm. A result for the type 1 die is shown in TABLE 1. A result for the type 2 die is shown in a TABLE 2.<br><br>
14<br><br><br>
/J<br><br><br>
16<br>
A, B, C, and D in the TABLE 1 indicate the same sections and angles shown in FIG. 1A. A, B, C, D, and E in the TABLE 2 indicate the same sections and angles shown in FIG, 1B. Symbols "O" in TABLES 1A and 1B mean that coating error did not occur regardless of resin viscosity and speed of resin coating operation such as accelerated speed phase or operational speed. Symbols "A" me an that at least one coating error occurred during the. accelerated speed phase at at least one resin viscosity. Symbols "X" mean that an optical fiber broke because of abnormal coating during accelerated speed phase or an abnormal coating occurred during an operational speed. Example 2<br>
In an example for performing a resin coating operation on a resin-coated optical fiber, interfacial shear rate is calculated by substituting an actual measured value so as to perform a drawing experiment by using dies (types 1 and 2) shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B under condition such that resin viscosities are 0.9, 1.5, and 2.0 Pa'sec, diameters of already-coated optical fibers were 190 µm. Results for the type 1 die are shown in TABLE 3. Results for the type 2 die are shown in TABLE 4.<br><br>
n<br><br><br>
)8<br><br><br>
19<br>
Symbols such as in TABLES 3 and 4 have<br>
the same meanings the cases in TABLES 1 and 2 . When a drawing operation was impossible because the optical fiber broke, a value which was inferred by data obtained from a case of low line speed was used instead.<br>
According to the above results, a stable range for interfacial shear rate is preferably -1.5 X 105 to 0 sec-1 in a case in which an optical fiber made from a glass is coated by resin. It is preferable that a coated optical fiber be coated at a stable interfacial shear rate within a range of -3 X 105 to 2 X 105 sec-1. According to this example of an optical fiber drawing die, interfacial shear rate of an optical fiber to the coated resin is calculated in accordance with a pressure value of resin inside a coating pot, and the interfacial shear rate is set in a range of -1.5 X 105 to 0 sec-1. Therefore, it is possible to perform a stable resin coating operation on an optical fiber even when an absolute value of the interfacial shear rate exceeds 105 sec-1.<br>
Also, according to this example of an optical fiber drawing die, interfacial shear rate of the resin-coated optical fiber of the coated resin is calculated in accordance with a coated-resin diameter, and interfacial shear rate is set in a range of -3 X 105 to 2 X 105sec-1. Therefore, it is possible to perform a stable resin coating operation on the resin-coated optical fiber even<br><br>
20<br>
when an absolute value of the interfacial shear rate exceeds 105 sec-1.<br>
Also, in this example of an optical fiber drawing apparatus, interfacial shear rate is set according to different shapes of dies between a die for performing a resin-coating operation to an optical fiber and a die for performing resin-coating operation on a resin-coated optical fiber. Therefore, it is possible to perform a stable resin coating operation even in a high-speed drawing operation.<br>
Also, in this example of an optical fiber drawing method, it is possible to perform stable resin coating operation by using the above-mentioned optical fiber drawing apparatus even if the absolute value of interfacial shear rate exceeds 105 sec-1. Therefore, it is possible to perform drawing operation at higher drawing speed and to realize an optical fiber drawing method which can realize high productivity and cost reduction.<br><br>
