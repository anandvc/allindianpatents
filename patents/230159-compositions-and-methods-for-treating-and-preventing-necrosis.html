				<td>COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR TREATING AND PREVENTING NECROSIS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to methods and compositions for treating and preventing cell<br>
necrosis. More specifically, the methods and compositions of the present invention prevent or<br>
treat necrosis by means of inhibiting the activity of intracellular elastase acting in the cells<br>
undergoing necrosis.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Elastase is a serine protease that catalyses the degradation of proteins, including elastin, a major<br>
structural protein of mammalian connective tissue. The art has suggested that the inhibition of<br>
elastase may be effective in the treatment of various conditions and diseases.<br>
For example, US 4,683, 241 indicate:; that elastase is believed to play an important role in the<br>
etiology of inflammatory connective tissue diseases. This patent discloses a class of phenolic<br>
esters exhibiting elastase inhibitory action.<br>
US 5, 216,022 discloses the use of aromatic esters of phenylenedialkanoates as inhibitors of<br>
human neutrophil elastase (also known as leukocyte elastase), for treating numerous neutrophil<br>
elastase-mediated conditions.<br>
US 6,159, 938 indicates that the inhibition of endogenous vascular elastase may be effective in<br>
treating pulmonary vascular disease and other related conditions.<br>
Necrosis is the relatively uncontrolled process of cell death following perturbation to the cellular<br>
environment, resulting in cell rupture. Necrosis may be treated by the use of high pressure<br>
oxygen.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The inventors have unexpectedly found that intracellular elastase is involved in necrotic cell<br>
death, and that the inhibition of said enzyme within the affected cells may serve as an effective<br>
tool for treating and/or preventing cell necrosis and diseases associated therewith.<br>
The present invention provides a method for treating and preventing necrosis of cells and<br>
diseases associated therewith, comprising inhibiting the enzymatic activity of one or more<br>
elastase enzymes within said cells.<br>
In one aspect, the above mentioned method comprises administering to a subject a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of one or more elastase inhibiting agents, wherein said agents<br>
inhibit the enzymatic activity of intrace lular elastase in the cells to be treated.<br>
The present invention also encompasses a method for inhibiting and preventing cell necrosis in<br>
vitro, comprising causing an effective amount of one or more elastase inhibitors to enter the cells<br>
to be treated. The inventors have also surprisingly found the inhibition of elastase within the<br>
affected cells may shift cell necrosis, at least partially, into apoptotic cell death.<br>
Thus, in a preferred embodiment, the invention provides a method for treating and preventing<br>
cell necrosis and diseases associated therewith, comprising: inhibiting the enzymatic activity of<br>
elastase within said cells; and<br>
inhibiting apoptotic cell death.<br>
The present invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment and/or<br>
prevention of cell necrosis and diseases associated therewith, wherein said compositions<br>
comprise therapeutically effective amounts of one or more agents that inhibit the enzymatic<br>
activity of one or more elastase enzymes in the cells to be treated.<br><br>
Thus, the abovementioned pharmaceutical compositions comprise one or more elastase inhibitors<br>
that are capable of entering the cells to be treated, in combination with one or more suitable<br>
pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients.<br>
According to one preferred embodiment of the invention, the abovementioned pharmaceutical<br>
compositions further comprise one or more inhibitors of apoptosis.<br>
In a further aspect of the present invention is provided the use of one or more elastase inhibitors<br>
in the preparation of a medicament for treating and/or preventing necrosis of cells and diseases<br>
associated therewith, wherein said elastase inhibitors are capable of entering said cells.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the invention is also directed to the use of one or more elastase<br>
inhibitors together with one or more inhibitors of apoptosis in the preparation of a medicament<br>
for treating and/or preventing necrosis of cells and diseases associated therewith, wherein said<br>
elastase inhibitors are capable of entering said cells.<br>
The inhibitors of elastase activity used according to the invention for treating and preventing cell<br>
necrosis, and diseases associated therewith, are: all capable of entering into the target cells, such<br>
that said inhibitors exert their inhibitory actions within said cells.<br>

caspase inhibitors and the hydrophilic bile salt ursodeoxycholic acid. Other methods known in<br>
the art for inhibiting apoptosis, for example, by means of regulation of expression of pro-and<br>
anti-apoptotic proteins, may also be used according to the present invention. Such methods are<br>
described, for example, by Li et al. [Acia. Anaesthesiol Sin, 38 (4), p. 207-215 (2000)].<br>
Examples<br>
Experimental protocol<br>
1. Models of necrosis in vitro<br>
Staurosporine and anti-Fas-induced necrosis<br>
Human promonocytic U-937 cells in logarithmic phase were seeded at a concentration of<br>
4X105/ml. Afterwards the cells were w;ished twice and seeded again in glucose-free RPMI- 1640<br>
medium (Beit Haemek, Israel) supplemented with 2 mM pyruvate (Beit Haemek, Israel) and<br>
10% dialyzed FCS (Gibco, BRL) for one hour.<br>
The rat pheochromocytoma PC-12 cell line was propagated in DMEM medium (Gibco, BRL),<br>
supplemented with 5% heat- inactivated calf serum, 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, and 2<br>
mM L-glutamine. PC-12 cells in logarithmic phase were seeded at a concentration of 1.2x<br>
105/WELL in 24-well plates (Cellstar). Then the cells were washed twice and maintained in<br>
glucose-free RPMI-1640 medium (Bei Haemek, Israel), and supplemented with 2 mM pyruvate<br><br>
and 10% dialyzed FCS for one hour. U-937 and PC-12 cells were incubated with and without 1<br>
uM oligomycin (Sigma) for 45 min, and cells were treated with or without 1.25 uM<br>
staurosporine (STS) (Sigma) for an additional seven hours in U-937 cells or five hours in PC-12<br>
cells. Alternatively, cells were treated with or without 100 ng/ml anti-Fas (Upstate<br>
biotechnology, USA) for the same time period.<br>
KCN-induced necrosis<br>
U-937 and PC-12 cells cultured in complete RPMI-1640 medium were washed and seeded in<br>
glucose-free RPMI-1640 medium, as described above, and treated with or without 0.5 mM KCN<br>
(Merck, Germany) for seven hours with U-937 cells, or for five hours with PC-12 cells.<br>
2.	Testing of elastase inhibitor<br>
200 uM elastase inhibitor III (MeOSue Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-CMK from Calbiochem) when added<br>
was administered 30 min before addition of the inducers. The inhibitor was dissolved in DMSO<br>
to a concentration of 100 mM. The finsd concentration of DMSO in the system was 0. 2%, and<br>
was added to all treatments. In separate experiments, 200 uM of an elastase inhibitor (CE1037,<br>
manufactured by Cortech Inc.) was administered 30 min before addition of the inducers. The<br>
inhibitor was dissolved in PBS.<br>
3.	Cell death assay<br>
Trypan blue exclusion<br>
At each time point, cell viability was determined by the trypan blue exclusion method (Daniel<br>
CP, Parreira A., et al. Leukemia Res. 11 191-196 (1987). Assays were performed in duplicate.<br>
Morphological quantification of apoptosis and necrosis<br>
Cells undergoing morphological changes associated with apoptotic or necrotic cell death were<br>
monitored as described by McGahon et al. [Methods Cell Biol, 46: p. 153- 85 (1995)]. Briefly, 1<br><br>
ml of the cells was collected and centriluged. The pellet was resuspended in a 20-fold dilution of<br>
the dye mixture (composed of 100 µ-g/ml acridine orange and 100 µg/ml ethidium bromide in<br>
PBS), placed on a glass slide and viewed on an inverted fluorescence microscope. A minimum of<br>
200 cells was scored for each sample.<br>
Preparation of cell lvsates<br>
4X107 U-937 cells, treated or untreated with the various inducers, were collected after three<br>
hours of incubation, washed twice with ice-cold PBS and resuspended at 108/ml in ice-cold<br>
lysing buffer (50 nM Tris-HCL pH 7.5 0.1 % NP-40, 1 mM DTT, 100 uM leupeptin and 100<br>
uM TLCK). The cells were broken by the use of a polytron device (4 cycles of 7 seconds each)<br>
on ice, and the debris was pelleted by c entrifugation in an ultracentrifuge at 120,000 x g for 30<br>
minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was used for further studies or stored at -70°C. The protein<br>
content of each sample was determined by the proi:ein assay (BioRad).<br>
5. Electrophoresis<br>
Electrophoresis on a gelatin substrate gel was performed as previously described (Distefano J. F.,<br>
Cotto C. A., et al. Cancer Invest. 6, 487-498, (1988)). Proteases were reversibly inactivated by<br>
addition of 100 µl aliquots of the cell lysates containing 200 µg protein to 50 µl of 0.625 M Tris-<br>
HC1 buffer, pH 6.8, with 2.5% SDS, 10% sucrose and 0. 03% phenol red. Samples were then<br>
electrophorated using 0.1% gelatin copolymerized in 11% polyacrylamide gel. After<br>
electrophoresis, the gels were subjected to three repeated immersions in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer,<br>
pH 7.0, containing 2. 5% (V/V) Tritor-x-100 in order to remove the SDS and reactivate the<br>
proteases. The gels were sliced and incubated overnight at 37° C in 0.1 M glycine-NaOH buffer,<br>
pH 7.0, with or without 100 uM TPCK (ehymotrypsin-like serine protease inhibitor) and 100 uM<br>
elastinal (elastase-like serine protease inhibitor). The bands of protease activity were developed<br>
with amido black staining.<br><br>
Results<br>
1.	Anti-Fas-induced apoptosis/necrosis in U-937 cells<br>
Fig. 1 indicates that treatment with anti-Fas induced about 60% apoptosis as compared to the<br>
control. Oligomycin is inactive by itself, however, addition of 100 ng/ml anti-Fas to oligomycin<br>
switched apoptotic cell death to necrotic cell deai:h. Under these conditions, about 70% necrosis<br>
occurred and apoptosis returned to control level. Nuclear morphology was determined and<br>
analyzed by fluorescence microscope after double-staining with acridine orange and ethydium<br>
bromide.<br>
2.	Induction of elastase-like activity luring necrotic cell death induced by anti-Fas in the<br>
presence of oligomycin<br>
U-937 cells were maintained in glucose-free medium preincubated with or without 1 µM<br>
oligomycin for 45 min and treated with or without 100 ng/ml anti-Fas for three hours.<br>
Following this, cell lysates were prepared as described in "Experimental protocol" and applied to<br>
a gelatine substrate gel electrophoresis. The results, which are presented in Fig. 2 indicate that<br>
treatment with anti-Fas and oligomycin caused the appearance of a band of protease activity (line<br>
D), which was not found in the untreated control cells (lane A), anti-Fas-treated cells (lane B), or<br>
oligomycin- treated cells (lane C). This band disappeared in the presence of 100 uM elastinal<br>
(lane D), but not in the presence of 100 uM TPCK (lane D), indicating that treatment with anti-<br>
Fas and oligomycin induced an elastase- ike activity, but not a chymotrypsin-like activity.<br>
3.	Induction of elastase-like activity during necrotic cell death induced by KCN<br>
U-937 cells were treated with or without 0.5 mM KCN for three hours and then cell lysates were<br>
prepared as decribed in "Experimental protocol" and applied to a gelatine substrate gel<br>
electrophoresis. The results, which are presented in Fig. 3, show that treatment with KCN caused<br>
the appearance of a band of protease activity (lane B), which was not found in the untreated<br>
control cells (lane A). This band disappeared in the presence of 100 uM elastinal (lane B), but<br><br>
not in the presence of 100 uM TPCK (lane B), indicating that treatment with KCN induced an<br>
elastase-like activity, but not a chymotrypsin-like activity.<br>
4.	Effect of elastase inhibitor on indue ion of elastase- like activity during necrotic cell death<br>
U-937 cells were treated with or without 5 mM KCN. 200 uM elastase inhibitor (Cortech) was<br>
added for three hours and then cell lysates were prepared as decribed in "Experimental protocol"<br>
and applied to a gelatine substrate gel electrophoresis. The results are presented in Fig. 4. It can<br>
be seen that treatment with KCN caused the appearance of a band of protease activity (lane B),<br>
which was not found in the untreated control cells (lane A). This band disappeared when KCN<br>
was administered in the presence of 200 uM elastase inhibitor (lane C).<br>
5.	Prevention of KCN-induced necros:is by elastase inhibitor III in PC-12 cells<br>
Exposure of PC-12 cells to 0.5 mM KCN induced massive necrotic cell death compared to the<br>
control. Addition of elastase inhibitor III which was inactive by itself significantly inhibited<br>
necrosis induced by KCN (Fig. 5, B). The protective effect of elastase inhibitor III is also seen<br>
when cell survival was determined under the same conditions by trypan blue exclusion (Fig. 5,<br>
A).<br>
6.	Inhibitory effect of elastase inhibitor III on KCN- induced necrosis in U-937 cells<br>
Treatment with KCN caused 95% necrosis as; compared to 10% in the control. Addition of<br>
elastase inhibitor HI with KCN markedly reduced necrotic cell death to 21%, and shifted 22% of<br>
the necrotic cell death to apoptotic cell death. 52% of the cells were protected from necrotic cell<br>
death by this inhibitor. Elastase inhibitor III did not cause any cell damage (Fig. 6).<br>
7.	Inhibitory effect of permeable versus non-permeable elastase inhibitor on anti-Fas-induced<br>
necrosis<br>
Fig. 7A shows anti-Fas-induced apoptosis/necrosis. Under these conditions cells were exposed to<br>
a permeable elastase inhibitor (Cortech Inc.). This exposure completely abrogated apoptotic as<br><br>
well as necrotic cell death (Fig. 7B). The non permeable elastase inhibitor-elastinal had no effect<br>
in this system (Fig. 7C).<br>
8.	STS-induced apoptosis/necrosis in PC-12 cells<br>
Fig. 8 indicates that treatment with 1.25 uM STS induced about 73% apoptosis as compared to<br>
the control. Oligomycin is inactive by itself, however, addition of STS to oligomycin switched<br>
apoptotic cell death to necrotic cell death. Under these conditions, about 70% necrosis occurred<br>
and apoptosis returned to control level. Nuclear morphology was determined and analyzed by<br>
fluorescence microscope after double-staining with acridine orange and ethidium bromide.<br>
9.	Inhibition of STS-induced apoptosis by elastase inhibitor in PC-12 cells<br>
Exposure of PC-12 cells to 1.25 uM STS induced massive apoptotic cell death as compared to<br>
the control. Addition of 200 uM elastase inhibitor (Cortech, Inc.) which was inactive by itself<br>
significantly inhibited apoptosis induced by STS (Fig. 9).<br>
10.	Prevention of STS-induced necrosis by elastase inhibitor in PC-12 cells<br>
As seen in Fig. 10 A, 1.25 uM STS with 1 uM oligomycin induced about 70% necrosis. 200 uM<br>
elastase inhibitor was inactive by itself, but completely abrogated necrosis- induced by STS.<br>
Under the same conditions 100 uM ehistase inhibitor markedly reduced necrotic cell death to<br>
9%, and shifted 39% of the necrotic cell death to apoptotic cell death (Fig. 10B).<br>
11.	Inhibitory effect of elastase inhibitor on KCN-induced necrosis in PC-12 cells<br>
Exposure of PC-12 cells to 0.5 mM KCN induced massive necrotic cell death as compared to the<br>
control. Addition of 200 uM elastase inhibitor which was inactive by itself significantly inhibited<br>
necrosis induced by KCN (Fig. 11).<br><br>
12. Effect of elastase inhibitor on STS-induced necrosis in U-937 cells<br>
As seen in Fig. 12 treatment with STS in the presence of oligomycin markedly reduced cell<br>
survival as compared to control. Elastase inhibitor had a slight effect by itself, but it significantly<br>
inhibited cell killing induced by STS and oligomycin. The inhibitory effect was measured during<br>
prolong incubation of 48 hours. Cell v ability was measured by trypan blue exclusion. Similar<br>
results were obtain for apoptosis (Data r ot shown).<br><br>
