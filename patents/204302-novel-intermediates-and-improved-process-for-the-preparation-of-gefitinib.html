FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of Gefitinib. Gefitinib which is (4-(3'-chloro-4'-fluorophenylamino)-7-methoxy-6-[3-(4-morpho-hnyl)propoxy]quinazoline) has the formula-I given below. It is an addition to the arsenal of anti-tumor agents, especially the epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, that has shown promising results in pre-clinical and clinical trials. The antitumor activity of gefitinib has provoked interest in its potential for clinical application in the treatment of a variety of solid tumors, especially non-small cell lung cancer and hematological malignancies. The safety and oral bioavailability of this drug has encouraged many countries to launch this drug.<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Gefitinib of the formula-I is reported for the first time by Gibson, KH (Zeneca) in EP 0823900. Equivalent patents for gefitinib are US 5770599 and WO 9633980. Antitumor activity of gefitinib is described in Clin. Cancer Res., 2000, 6,2053-63. Pharmacokinetics and tolerability of gefitinib is described in Clin. Pharmacokin., 2001, 40, 297-306. Clinical studies of gefitinib related to lung cancer are described in Lung Cancer, 2000, 29 (Suppl. 1), page 72.<br>
Process for the preparation of gefitinib disclosed in EP 0823900 starts with the quinazoline derivative of the formula-II (Scheme-I). Quinazoline derivative of the formula-II is reacted with methanesulfonic acid and L-methionine to get the demethylated derivative of the formula-Ill. Protection of the hydroxy group present in<br><br>
compound of the formula-Ill as its acetate followed by reaction with thionyl chloride gave the chloro derivative of the formula-V. Reaction of the compound of the formula-V with 3-chloro-4-fluoroaniline gave the anilino derivative of the formula-VL Deprotection of the acetate group followed by etherification of the resulting compound with 3-morpholinopropyl chloride gave crude gefitinib of the formula-I after column chromatography. This material was further purified by recrystallization from toluene.<br><br>
Scheme-I The main draw back in this process is formation of impurities during the introduction of morpholinopropyl side chain. During this stage main impurity that can form is N-alkylated derivative of the formula-VIII. Due to its chemically related property, removal of this impurity needs column chromatography. Such a process is not commercially viable for bulk production and also will not be cost effective. Also the process involves steps like protection and deprotection of phenolic hydroxy group during the synthesis of process. This leads to more number of steps in making gefitinib and therefore the process<br><br><br>
become lengthy and time consuming. Also, the basic raw material used in the synthesis is not readily available on commercial scale and it needs to be prepared from 2-amino-4,5-dimethoxybenzoic acid as per the process given in EP 0566226.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
Keeping in view of the difficulties in the above described process for the preparation of gefitinib on a commercial scale, we aimed to develop a simple and economically viable and commercially applicable process for the preparation of gefitinib of the formula-I.<br>
Accordingly, the main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of gefitinib of the formula-I which is simple and economical and commercially applicable.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of gefitinib of the formula-I which involves employment of readily and cheaply available raw materials.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to avoid the formation of impurities such as compound of the formula-VIII.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of gefitinib of the formula-I which has short in number of steps making it simple and economical.<br><br>
According to another objective of the present invention there is provided novel compound of the formula-X, which is an intermediate for the preparation of compound of the formula-I and a process for its preparation.<br><br>
According to still another objective of the present invention there is provided novel compound of the formula-XI, which is an intermediate for the preparation of compound of the formula-I and a process for its preparation.<br><br>
According to yet another objective of the present invention there is provided novel compound of the formula-XII, which is an intermediate for the preparation of compound of the formula-I and a process for its preparation.<br><br>
According to further objective of the present invention there is provided novel compound of the formula-XIII, which is an intermediate for the preparation of compound of the formula-I and a process for its preparation.<br><br><br>
According to another objective of the present invention there is provided novel compound of the formuIa-XIV, which is an intermediate for the preparation of compoimd of the formula-I and a process for its preparation.<br><br>
According to still another objective of the present invention there is provided novel compound of the formula-XV, which is an intermediate for the preparation of compound of the formula-I and a process for its preparation.<br><br>
During our sustained research in developing an improved process for the preparation of gefitinib of the formxxla-I, we realized that if we introduce the morpholinopropyl side chain at an early stage of the synthesis, the process would be simpler, shorter and free from related impurities.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides an improved process for the preparation of compound of formula-I,<br><br><br>
which comprises,<br>
(i)        Reacting iso-vanilUn of the formula-IX,<br><br>

(ii) Nitrating the compound of the formula-X using a nitrating reagent at a temperature in the range of 5 to 60 °C, to get the novel nitro derivative of the formula-XI,<br><br>
(iii) Reacting the compound of the formula-XI with hydroxylamine salt in a polar solvent medium at a temperature in the range of 20 to 60 °C in the presence of a base to get the novel oxime derivative of the formula-XII,<br><br><br>
(iv) Reacting the compound of the formula-XII with a dehydrating agent at a temperature in the range of 20 to 140 °C in the presence or absence of a solvent to get the novel compound of the formula-XIII,<br><br>
(v) Hydrolyzing the compound of the formula-XIII using a base or an acid in a solvent medium and at a temperature in the range of 20 to 80 °C to get the novel amide compound of the formula-XIV,<br><br>

(x) Purifying the crude compound of the formula-I by acid / base treatment or by recrystallization from solvents to get pharmaceutically acceptable grade gefitinib of the formula-I.<br>
The process is shown in Scheme-II.<br><br><br>
Accordingly, the basic raw material selected for the synthesis of gefitinib is iso-vanillin. Earlier reported process (WO 01/04102 within Example (25) for the preparation of compound of the formula-XVI consists of hydrolysis of gefitinib of formula-I with 6N<br><br>
hydrochloric acid. Since gefitinib itself is a target compound, preparation of compound of formula-XVI from gefitinib is of no commercial value as such.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, iso-vanillin of the formula-IX is reacted with 3-morpholinopropyl halide in the presence of a base to get the 0-alkylated compound of the formula-X.

In the second step, nitration is done by using dilute nitric acid or a nitration mixture such as sulfuric acid/nitric acid. The percentage of nitric acid can be between 10-70%, preferably 30-60%. Temperature of the reaction is preferably, between 20-50 °C. The nitration product of the formula-XI can be isolated by neutralization of reaction mass with a base to basic pH followed by extraction into a solvent.

The temperature of reaction is between 20-140 °C, preferably 40-130 °C. In case of acetic or propionic anhydride the amoimt can be 5-10 fold excess. Isolation of the product of the formula-XIII can be done by distilling off the excess reagent and subsequently diluting the reaction mass with water and neutralization of the mass pH to basic. The base used for neutralization is selected from sodium or potassium hydroxide; carbonate, bicarbonate, ammonia, triethylamine, etc., preferably potassium carbonate or ammonia.<br>
The amide compound of the formula-XV can be obtained in one-step process from the compound of the formula-XIII by reduction-cum-hydrolysis or in a step-wise maimer.
