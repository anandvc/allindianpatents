INTERFERING SMART SHELF<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[01] The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Application No. 11/091,696 filed March 28, 2005 (Attorney Docket No. 005222.00379). The entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[02] The present invention relates generally to inventory monitoring systems and methods. More particularly, the present invention provides systems and methods for identifying stored items with the use of radio frequency identification tags attached to storage shelves.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
[03] Businesses use a variety of systems for tracking inventory. For example, it is common to use bar code scanners to read bar codes attaches to products to identify and count the products. One limitation of such systems is that they require a line of sight between the bar code scanner and* the bar code. If the product containing the bar code is not positioned properly with respect to the bar code scanner or an object is placed between the bar code scanner and the bar code, the bar code scanner cannot read the bar code.<br>
[04] The use of radio frequency identification (RFID) tags has increased in part because systems that use RFID tags do not have some of the limitations associated with bar code systems. For example, RFID tag readers generally do not require a line of sight with RFID tags. RFID tags are also capable of storing large amounts of information.<br>
[05] With conventional RFID system configurations RFID tags are attached to products with adhesives. RFID tags have been used infrequently with low priced products. As the price of products decreases, the cost of an RFID tags becomes a larger percentage of the price of the product and the use of RFID tags becomes cost prohibitive. There are also costs associated with applying RFID tags to products and programming RFID tags.<br><br>
WO 2006/104587	PCT/US2006/005546<br>
3<br>
Another limitation with conventional RFID system configurations is that it can be difficult for RFID tag readers to read RFID tags attached to objects that contain liquid or metal.<br>
[06] Therefore, there exists a need in the art for inventory tracking systems and methods that take advantage of the capabilities offered by RFID tags while limiting the costs associated with using, applying and programming such tags.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[07] Aspects of the present invention provide systems and methods that can be used to perform inventory monitoring. Among other advantages, the disclosed systems and methods facilitate efficient and continuous inventory tracking. In one embodiment of the invention, a plurality of RFID tags are coupled to a shelf. Objects placed on the shelf prevent an RFID tag reader from reading corresponding RFID tags. The number of objects placed on the shelf may be determined by identifying how may RFID tags are unreadable.<br>
[08] In another embodiment of the invention, computer-executable instructions for performing one or more of the disclosed methods are stored on a computer-readable medium, such as a floppy disk or CD-ROM.<br>

 	 Computer device 100 can operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers or other devices, such as a server, a router, a network personal computer, a peer device or other common network node, a wireless telephone or wireless personal digital assistant. Computer 100 includes a network interface 150 that couples system bus 114 to a local area network (LAN) 152. Networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks and home computer systems.<br>
[23] A wide area network (WAN) 154, such as the Internet, can also be accessed by computer device 100. Figure 1 shows a modem unit 156 connected to serial port interface 126 and to WAN 154. Modem unit 156 may be located within or external to computer 100 and may be any type of conventional modem such as a cable modem or a satellite modem. LAN 152 may also be used to connect to WAN 154. Figure 1 shows a router 158 that may connect LAN 152 to WAN 154 in a conventional manner.<br>
[24] It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other ways of establishing a communications link between the computers can be used.

 	 Figure 2 illustrates a conventional RFID tag 204. The structure and operation of RFID tags are well-known to those skilled in the art. A semiconductor chip 224 stores information such as the identification of an object, properties of the object or any other information. An antenna 226 may wrap around semiconductor chip 224 and absorb electromagnetic radiation emitted by a source, such as RFID reader 134 (shown in Figure 1). The received electromagnetic radiation energy may be used to provide power to semiconductor chip 224, In particular, the energy may be used to read information stored in chip 224 and transmit electromagnetic radiation from tag 204 to a reader. Of course, a variety of other tags may be used with the present invention. For example, the present invention may be used with active RFID tags. Active RFID tags contain a power source, such as a battery, that can be used to provide power to chip 224 and antenna 226. One of the advantages of active RFID tags is that they generally have a longer range than passive RFID tags, such as tag 204 shown in figure 2.<br>
Exemplary Embodiments<br>
[27] Figure 3 illustrates a smart shelf system in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. A shelf 302 supports a group of objects 304a-304c. A plurality of RFID tags 306a-306h are coupled to shelf 302. Objects 304a-304c included material or are contained in packages that contain material that interfere with the operation of RFID tag reader systems. For example objects 304a-304c may contain metal, water br some other material that interferes with the transmission of radio frequency energy.<br>
[28] In the exemplary system shown in Figure 3, object 304a is placed between RFID tag reader 308 and RFID tag 306a. Object 304a includes or contains a material that prevents RFID tag reader 308 from reading RFID tag 306a. For example, object 304a may be a product placed within a metallic wrapper. With the exemplary system shown in Figure 3, RFID tag reader 308 may determine a number of objects placed on shelf 302 by determining how many of RFID tags 306a-306h are unreadable.<br>
[29] There is a one-to-one correspondence between RFID tags and objects in the system shown in Figure 3. In alternative embodiments, there may not be a one-to-one correspondence. For example, at different times a single shelf or other storage apparatus may be used to store objects having different sizes. An RFID tag reader or other device may be programmed to recognize that a single object corresponds to more than one<br><br>
WO 2006/104587                                                    8	PCT/US2006/005546<br>
RFID tag.   RFID tags may also be arranged in two dimensional arrays and/or placed above or beside corresponding objects.<br>
[30] Figure 4 illustrates a system for managing inventory that includes a plurality of smart shelves, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. An RFID tag reader 402 is used to determine inventory placed on smart shelves 404a-404c. RFID tag reader 402 may function in a manner similar to that of RFID tag reader 308 (shown in Figure 3). RFID tag reader 402 may be implemented with a handheld computer device that includes RFID tag reading functionality or some other device that is capable of reading RFID tags, such as one located in a fixed position. RFID tag reader 402 may also use a plurality of antenna elements. For example, smart shelves 404a-404c may each include an antenna element located in a fixed position and coupled to RFED tag reader 402. After collecting inventory information from smart shelves 404a-404c, RFID tag reader 402 may transmit the inventory information to an inventory server 406.<br>
[31] Inventory server 406 may include an inventory database 408 and an inventory management application 410. Inventory database 408 may store information regarding objects stored on smart shelves 404a-404c. Inventory management application 410 main retrieve information from inventory database 408 and perform such functions as reporting inventory data to a corporate office 412 or ordering new inventory from a supplier, such as supplier 414. Inventory server 406 is shown coupled to corporate office 412 and supplier 414 via the Internet 416. One skill m the art will appreciate that a variety of different communication channels may be used to communicate inventory information. For example, inventory server 406 may be configured to communicate with supplier 414 directly over a telephone line and transmit inventory data to corporate office 412 via a satellite link. One skilled in the art will appreciate that aspects of the invention may be used with a variety of conventional systems that obtain inventory information and then act on the inventory information by generating reports, performing comparisons, ordering inventory, etc.<br>
[32] Figure 5 illustrates a method may be used to monitor the presence of objects, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. First, in step 502 RFID tags are coupled to a shelf. Step 502 may be use to retrofit existing shelves and may not be needed with existing smart shelves.  As used herein, an RFID tag is coupled to a shelf<br><br>
WO 2006/104587	PCT/US2006/005546<br>

when the RFID tag is attached to, embedded within or otherwise arranged to maintain a fixed position relative to the shelf. In step 504 it is determined whether or not the RFED tags are tuned. Step 504 may include placing an object between an RFID tag and RFID tag reader and determining whether or not the RFID tag reader can read the RFID tag. When the RFID tags are not tuned, in step 506 the RFID tags are tuned.<br>
[33] It may be necessary to tune RFID tags when, for example, new or different objects are placed on a smart shelf. Each type of object may have different characteristics that impact the reading of RFID tags. For example, a first object may prevent the reading of an RFID tag while a second object have less metal may not prevent the reading of the RFID tag.<br>
[34] Figure 6 illustrates an exemplary configuration for tuning RFID tags, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. An RFID tag 602 is adhered to a shelf 604. The position of an interfering member 606 may be adjusted to control the amount of radio frequency energy transferred between an RFID tag reader 608 and RFID tag 602. For example, interfering member 606 may be formed of a metallic substance that blocks or reduces the transmission radio frequency energy. The readability of RFID tag 602 is a function of the amount that interfering member 606 is placed between RFID tag 602 and RFID tag reader 608. The tuning characteristics may be optimized for a given product 610 to ensure that RFID tag 602 cannot be read by RFID reader 608 when object 610 is placed between RFID tag 602 and RFID tag reader 608. Of course, RFID tags may be tuned by bending their antennas, changing their angles with respect to an RFID reader or with any other conventional tuning methods.<br>
[35] Returning to Figure 5, in step 508 an RFID tag reader illuminates a shelf with electromagnetic radiation. Step 508 may include the conventional process of an RFID tag reader transmitting radio frequency radiation. Next, in step 510 it is determined how many RFID tags are unreadable with the RFID tag reader. As discussed with reference to Figure 3, objects may be positioned to prevent RFID tags from being read by an RFID tag reader. In step 512 the quantity of objects is determined based on the determination made in step 510. When there is a one-to-one correspondence between objects and RFID tags, the quantity of objects corresponds to the number of tags that are unreadable. In step 514, the quantity of objects is transmitted from the RFID tag reader to a computer<br><br>
WO 2006/104587                                                                        10	PCT/US2006/005546<br>
device, such as inventory server 406 (shown in Figure 4). Next, in step 516 the computer device determines whether the quantity of objects is below a predetermined minimum. When the quantity is below the predetermined minimum, in step 518 the computer device transmits an order to a supplier. For example, a store may desire to maintain a certain quantity of products and a computer device may be programmed to order additional products when the quantity available drops below a predetermined minimum.<br>
[36] One skill in the art will appreciate that aspects of the invention may be used with a variety of conventional systems designed to maintain inventories and process inventory data.<br>
[37] While the invention has been described with respect to specific examples including presently preferred modes of carrying out the invention, those skilled in the art will appreciate that there are numerous variations and permutations of the above described systems and techniques that fall within the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. For example, aspects of the invention may be used with system that operate at frequencies other than radio frequencies.<br><br>
