				<td>Background of Invention<br>
This invention relates to phenol and acetone production, particularly to removing<br>
salts from washed cleavage product from the reaction of cumene hydroperoxide with<br>
an acid catalyst, and to a low sodium washed cleavage product.<br>
Sodium is a constituent of reagents commonly used in manufacturing phenol.<br>
Other metals may appear in place of or in addition to sodium. In product recovery<br>
aspects of phenol processes, metal salt constituents can hinder process efficiency and<br>
will contaminate process byproducts. Removing metals in selected aspects of the<br>
phenol process can improve process efficiencies and reduce the production of<br>
problematic byproducts.<br>
Phenol can be produced from oxidation of cumene to cumene hydroperoxide,<br>
followed by acid catalyzed decomposition to a cleavage product comprising solutions<br>
of phenol, acetone, and byproducts that include organic acids. The decomposition is<br>
commonly called cleavage. Cleavage product is treated with alkaline wash solutions to<br>
remove acid catalyst and a portion of the organic acid byproducts. After washing, the<br>
cleavage product and wash solutions can contain salts predominantly including<br>
sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium bisulfate (NaHSO4), sodium sulfate (Na 2 SO4),<br><br>
sodium phenate (NaOC 6 H 5), sodium carbonate (Na 2 CO 3), sodium bicarbonate<br><br>
(NaHCO ), and sodium salts of organic acids such as formic, acetic, benzoic,<br>
propionic, and oxalic acids in various combinations. Washed cleavage product (WCP) is<br>
separated from the wash solutions and refined in recovery operations entailing<br>
distillation and separation to recover products acetone and phenol, unreacted<br>
cumene, and alpha-methylstyrene (AMS). Recovery also purges low-boiling and high-<br>
boiling byproduct impurities.<br>
Residual salts entering the recovery operations as constituents in the washed<br>
cleavage product can result in fouling of separation and heat exchange equipment.<br>
Fouling can be delayed or slowed by operating recovery processes at reduced<br>
efficiencies. Ultimately, heavy organic waste products from the phenol process contain<br>
concentrations of salts that can present a disposal problem for the heavy organic<br>
impurities that might, for example, otherwise be burned as waste fuel.<br>
Representative phenol manufacturing methods using various alkaline solutions to<br>
wash cleavage product are described in US Patents 2,734,085; 2,737,480; 2,744,143;<br>
3,931,339; 4,262,1 50; 4,262,1 51; 4,626,600; 5,245,090 5,304,684; 5,510,543;<br>
6,066,767. US Patent 4,568,466 to Salem et al discloses ion exchange applications to<br>
high-purity boiler feed waters. US Patent 4,747,954 to Vaughn et al. teaches<br>
formulations of ion exchange resins. All of these patents are hereby incorporated by<br>
reference herein in their entirety.<br>
There is a need in the field of manufacturing phenol and acetone for<br>
improvements to benefit the efficiency and economics of production, particularly<br>
regarding productivity, recovery operations, and waste disposal. It would be desirable<br>
to improve the production of phenol and acetone in ways that (1) increase product<br>
recovery and plant availability, (2) reduce waste generation, (3) divert salt constituents<br>
out of process subsystems that incur operating and maintenance costs when elevated<br>
salt levels are characteristically present, (4) separate salt constituents from organic<br>
byproduct and waste streams to facilitate more cost effective disposal of the organics,<br>
and (5) facilitate greater internal recycle of recoverable intermediate byproducts and<br>
unused reagent, thereby reducing costs of makeup reagents.<br>
Summary of Invention<br>
The present invention removes cations and anions from washed cleavage product<br>
from the reaction of cumene hydroperoxide with an acid catalyst. The method<br>
contemplates using an alkaline washing operation to neutralize the acid and remove<br>
the bulk of the ions from the cleavage product. The washed cleavage product is then<br>
passed through cation and anion exchangers to remove the ions prior to distillation or<br>
other processing to recover acetone, phenol and other compounds from the cleavage<br>
product. The ion removal greatly reduces fouling in the product recovery, with less<br>
waste disposal, less operating downtime and longer operation between maintenance<br>
cycles, better heat transfer and energy efficiency, higher production rates, and the<br>
like.<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides a process for reducing ion content of washed<br>
cleavage product from the reaction of cumene hydroperoxide with an acid catalyst.<br>
The process includes contacting the washed cleavage product with a cation exchanger<br>
to remove positively charged ions including sodium, contacting the washed cleavage<br>
product with an anion exchanger to remove negatively charged ions including sulfate,<br>
and recovering exchanger effluent lean in sodium and sulfate. The washed cleavage<br>
product supplied to the exchangers can be whole washed cleavage product, or<br>
dewatered cleavage product, e.g. obtained by coalescing the whole washed cleavage<br>
product. The washed cleavage product preferably comprises a molar ratio of acetone<br>
to phenol from 0.8 to 1.5, from 2 to 30 weight percent cumene, from 4 to 20 weight<br>
percent water, and from 10 to 400 ppmw sodium, more preferably less than 300<br>
ppmw sodium and especially less than 200 ppmw sodium. The exchanger effluent<br>
preferably has less than 10 ppmw sodium, more preferably less than 5 ppmw, and<br>
especially less than 2 ppmw sodium.<br>
The cation exchanger is preferably a strong acid cation exchange resin in<br>
hydrogen form, or a weak acid cation exchange resin in hydrogen form. The anion<br>
exchanger is preferably a weak base anion exchange resin in free base form, or a<br>
strong base anion exchange resin in hydroxide form. The ion exchangers can be a<br>
mixed bed of exchanger media comprising both cation and anion exchangers,<br>
preferably with an effluent having a sodium concentration less than 5 ppmw. In<br>
another embodiment, the anion and cation exchangers comprise serial beds of anion<br>
and cation exchange resins, respectively, preferably with an effluent having a sodium<br>
concentration less than 10 ppmw and a pH from 3.5 to 6.0.<br>
The process preferably includes a cation exchange adsorption cycle at a<br>
temperature from 20 ° to 80 ° C and a feed rate to the cation exchange resin bed from<br>
1 to 60 cubic meters per cubic meter of bed volume per hour (BV/hr). A cation<br>
exchange regeneration cycle preferably employs from 0.5 to 10 weight percent<br>
aqueous sulfuric acid. The process preferably includes an anion exchange adsorption<br>
cycle at a temperature from 20 ° to 80 ° C and a feed rate to the anion exchange resin<br>
bed from 1 to 60 BV/hr. An anion exchange regeneration cycle can employ aqueous<br>
NaOH, sodium phenate, or a combination thereof, at NaOH or NaOH-equivalent<br>
concentration from 0.2 to 8 weight percent.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides a process for producing <br>
phenol that includes oxidizing cumene to cumene hydroperoxide, cleaving the<br>
cumene hydroperoxide in the presence of an acid catalyst to form a cleavage product<br>
mixture including phenol and acetone, washing the cleavage product mixture with<br>
alkaline wash solution to form a washed cleavage product, contacting the washed<br>
cleavage product with a cation exchanger and an anion exchanger to form a polished<br>
cleavage product of reduced ion content, preferably as described above, and<br>
recovering phenol and acetone from the polished cleavage product. The washing can<br>
include coalescing a whole washed cleavage product to separate an aqueous phase<br>
and recover the washed cleavage product for the exchanger contacting, wherein the<br>
recovered washed cleavage product comprises a molar ratio of acetone to phenol from<br>
0.8 to 1.5, from 2 to 30 weight percent cumene, from 4 to 20 weight percent water,<br>
and from 10 to 400 ppmw sodium, more preferably less than 300 ppmw sodium and<br>
especially less than 200 ppmw sodium.<br>
The product recovery can include distillation of the polished cleavage product and<br>
recovery of an aqueous stream recycled to the washing step. The process can also<br>
include dephenolating spent wash water from the washing. The dephenolation can<br>
include acidifying the spent wash water and extracting phenol from the acidified wash<br>
water with an immiscible solvent obtained from the phenol and acetone recovery, and<br>
recycling the extract to the cleavage product in the washing. The process can further<br>
include regenerating the cation and anion exchanger with aqueous and organic fluids,<br>
recycling spent aqueous fluid to the dephenolation, and recycling spent organic fluid<br>
to the washing.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a process for manufacturing phenol from cumene stream (10),<br>
including cumene hydroperoxide concentrator (20), cumene oxidizer (30) to cumene<br>
hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide cleavage (40) to a mixture of phenol and<br>
acetone, washing (50) with one or more alkaline solutions, ion exchange (60) to<br>
remove salts, acetone recovery (70), phenol distillation (80), and wastewater<br>
dephenolation (90).<br>
Feed cumene stream (10) and product stream (22) from the oxidizer (30) are<br>
introduced into conventional concentrator (20). The concentrator (20) supplies feed<br>
cumene (10), together with any cumene recovered from the oxidizer product stream<br>
(22), as a combined cumene stream (24) to the conventional oxidizer (30). A recycle<br>
cumene stream (26) is supplied to the oxidizer (30) from downstream acetone<br>
recovery (70), discussed below. Air (28) is introduced to the oxidizer (30) to partially<br>
oxidize the cumene to cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) in a well known manner. The<br>
byproduct dimethylbenzyl alcohol (DMBA) is also formed to a lesser extent, as well as<br>
acetophenone (AP), and other oxidation byproducts. Spent air (32) is exhausted from<br>
the oxidizer (30). The oxidizer product stream (22), including the CHP, DMBA, AP, and<br>
unreacted cumene, is supplied to the concentrator (20) as previously mentioned,<br>
where unreacted cumene is recovered for recycle to the oxidizer (30).<br>
The effluent in concentrator product stream (34) is rich in CHP for feed to<br>
cleavage reactor (40). A stream (36) typically recycles acetone from downstream<br>
acetone recovery (70), discussed below. A catalyst stream (38), commonly sulfuric<br>
acid, is supplied to the cleavage reactor (40) to facilitate the CHP cleavage to form a<br>
product mixture (42) with phenol and acetone as the principal products, along with<br>
unreacted AP and cleavage byproducts comprising alpha-methyl styrene (AMS), cumyl<br>
phenol, and other organic acids.<br>
The product mixture (42) flows to washing (50) to be contacted with one or more<br>
alkaline wash solutions (48), typically aqueous NaOH, in a manner well known in the<br>
art. An alkaline recycle stream (52) containing phenate from downstream acetone<br>
recovery (70) and a second phenate-containing stream (54) from wastewater<br>
dephenolation (90) are also fed to the washing system (50) to reduce the makeup<br>
alkaline solution requirements and minimize phenol losses.<br>
The alkaline washing results in an aqueous phase of spent wash (56) and a<br>
washed cleavage product (WCP) (58) as an organic phase. The alkaline wash<br>
neutralizes and extracts a major portion of the acid catalyst and salt components from<br>
the product phase, including mineral and organic acids. The product phase retains<br>
minor portions of acid catalyst, sodium cations, and salt anions, and a minor<br>
proportion of water. The spent wash (56) typically comprises from 85 to 95 weight<br>
percent of the alkaline solution feed streams (48), (52), (54). The whole WCP phase<br>
typically comprises at least 75 weight percent of organic compounds, but can include<br>
up to 25 weight percent of wash solution dispersed in the WCP. A preferred step in the<br>
present invention includes dewatering the whole WCP using conventional coalescing<br>
equipment and methodologies to further separate the residual wash solution from the<br>
WCP. This can help reduce energy use and flow volume in downstream product<br>
recovery by reducing the aqueous content of the WCP (58) to from 85 to 95 weight<br>
percent. Water from the coalescing step is discharged with the spent wash (56).<br>
WCP (58) is introduced to ion exchange unit (60) to remove sodium cations and<br>
salt-forming anions that can include sulfate, bisulfate, carbonate, bicarbonate,<br>
phenates, and other organic acid radicals, as discussed in more detail below. Ion<br>
exchange preferably removes from 50 to 98 percent of the sodium and produces a<br>
polished WCP (62) with less than 10 ppmw sodium, more preferably less than 5<br>
ppmw, and especially less than 2 ppmw sodium. Thus, a typical sodium content of 30<br>
to 40 ppmw in the prior art WCP can be reduced to less than 5 ppmw. Ion exchangers<br>
have finite unit mass capacity for adsorption and are typically rotated through<br>
successive, repeating cycles of adsorption operation, regeneration, and standby.<br>
Parallel ion exchange trains can be installed to permit continuous processing, such<br>
that saturated ion exchange modules undergo regeneration off-line while regenerated<br>
modules continue in service. A wastewater stream (64) produced during regeneration<br>
of the ion exchange resins is preferably treated in dephenolation unit (90). The water<br>
for regeneration is preferably obtained from vacuum towers elsewhere in the facility,<br>
e.g. jet condensate, which is sodium free. Caustic for regeneration of cation<br>
exchanger can be supplied from stream 48 and/or phenate recycle stream 54<br>
described below.<br>
Polished WCP (62) is fed to acetone fractionation unit (70), which primarily<br>
produces a purified acetone product (68) and a crude phenol product (72), plus light<br>
and heavy organic byproduct streams, (74) and (76), respectively. Acetone<br>
fractionation (70) also recovers the cumene recycle stream (26), the acetone recycle<br>
stream (36), and recycle aqueous stream (52), previously mentioned. Recovered water<br>
is sent to the dephenolation unit (90) via line (78). The crude phenol (72) in the prior<br>
art without ion exchange polishing would typically have a sodium content of 100-120<br>
ppmw, but this can be as low as about 1 5 ppmw in the present invention. Another<br>
benefit in the acetone fractionation (70) is that the lower sodium content of the<br>
polished WCP reduces the frequency of acetone column washings from several times a<br>
year, when the sodium in the WCP feed to the column is more than 30 ppmw, to more<br>
than a year using the principles of the present invention. The significance of this<br>
surprising result is that the acetone fractionation unit (70) can be washed during<br>
scheduled plant maintenance shutdowns, instead of shutting down the plant<br>
frequently due to the need to wash the acetone distillation column.<br>
The crude phenol product (72) is forwarded to a phenol fractionation unit (80),<br>
which primarily produces a purified phenol product (82), plus second light and second<br>
heavy organic byproduct streams (84) and (86), respectively. In the prior art the crude<br>
heavy byproducts from the phenol recovery might have a typical sodium content of<br>
200-300 ppmw and 2000-2500 in the concentrated heavy byproducts, whereas with<br>
the present invention the sodium content could be 30 ppmw and 300 ppmw in the<br>
crude and concentrated heavy byproducts, respectively. This is a significant<br>
improvement because byproducts of up to 500 ppmw sodium can be easily burned as<br>
a fuel, whereas more than 500 ppmw usually requires special treatment for ash<br>
handling, and more than 2000-2500 ppmw usually requires costly disposal by<br>
incineration.<br>
Phenol fractionation (80) also recovers an intermediate solvent stream (88) used in<br>
dephenolation (90). Acetone fractionation (70) and phenol fractionation (80) are more<br>
or less conventional, but the benefits of reduced sodium and other ion contents in the<br>
polished WCP (62) and crude phenol product (72) can include more efficient operation<br>
and longer operation between maintenance shutdowns due to less fouling; less waste<br>
disposal; and the like.<br>
The spent wash (56) is a primary wastewater feed to dephenolation (90), which is<br>
conventional except that a slightly larger unit than normal may be required to process<br>
wastewater (64) generated during aqueous regeneration of the ion exchange resins in<br>
unit (60). The spent wash (58) is acidified with acid (92) to convert phenate to phenol,<br>
and contacted with the solvent (88) from phenol fractionation to extract phenol from<br>
the spent wash (58) according to a well known procedure. The solvent is recovered<br>
and dosed with caustic (94), which converts phenol to phenate and allows the phenate<br>
to preferentially distribute in an aqueous phase that is recycled as stream (54) to the<br>
washing (50). After giving up phenol to the solvent, the dephenolated wash water<br>
leaves dephenolation (90) as wastewater (96). Spent solvent (98) from dephenolation<br>
(90) is directed to acetone fractionation (70) for recovery of cumene and AMS.<br>
The method of the present invention can be used in a new acetone-phenol plant,<br>
and it can also be implemented in existing plants by retrofit. Incorporating ion<br>
exchange into an existing phenol plant can facilitate the ability of the existing plant to<br>
concentrate and separate products, while avoiding collateral costs for maintenance<br>
and waste disposal that would otherwise occur for similar production increase without<br>
reduction in salt loadings in the WCP achieved with ion exchange.<br>
Fig. 2 shows an embodiment of an ion exchange train (100) with cationic<br>
exchanger bed (102) and anionic exchanger bed (104) operated in series. A network<br>
of main process lines and utility lines used for flushing, regenerating, and rinsing, are<br>
also shown. In production mode, WCP stream (104) is directed to the inlet of the<br>
cation unit (106) and distributed across the top of the cation resin bed (102). The<br>
cation unit (106) is maintained in a flooded state by monitoring the level in the vent<br>
separator (108) through which non-condensables are purged to line (110).<br>
The WCP stream (104) contacts the cation exchange resin bed (1 02) to remove<br>
sodium ions, which are exchanged for hydrogen or other cations. The cation exchange<br>
resin bed (102) can comprise either a strong-acid type or a weak-acid type resin.<br>
Strong-acid ion exchange resins typically have sulfonic acid functional groups, and<br>
representative examples are available commercially from Rohm &amp; Haas under the<br>
trade designations Amberlyst ® 1 5, Amberlyst ®35, Amberlyst ® 36, and the like.<br>
Weak-acid ion exchange resins typically have carboxylic acid moieties, and<br>
representative examples are commercially available from Rohm &amp; Haas under the<br>
trade designations Amberlite ® lRC 76, Amberlite ® IRC 84, and the like.<br>
As WCP (104) passes through the cation unit (106), the cationic resin converts<br>
soluble salts to their corresponding acids, including phenol. For example, ion<br>
exchange interactions can proceed as follows:<br>
Na SO + 2Rz-H ? 2Rz-Na + H SO<br>
2 4 2 4<br>
NaHSO + Rz-H ? Rz-Na + H SO<br>
4 2 4<br>
NaC H O +Rz-H ? Rz-Na + C H OH<br>
6 5 6 5<br>
NaROO + Rz-H ? Rz-Na + ROOH<br>
wherein "Rz"represents a moiety in the ion exchange medium, either acidic or<br>
basic, and "R" represents an organic radical in the WCP stream (104).<br>
The acidic WCP effluent (11 2) then passes through the anion unit (114) containing<br>
anion exchange resin bed (104). The anion unit (114) is maintained in flooded state<br>
via vent separator (116) and non-condensables purge stream (118) in a manner<br>
similar to cation unit (106). Either a weakly or strongly basic exchange resin or a<br>
series of weakly and strongly basic exchange resins can be used. Weakly basic ion<br>
exchange resins typically have tertiary amine moieties; representative examples are<br>
available commercially from Rohm &amp; Haas under the trade designations Amberlyst ®<br>
A21, Amberlyst ® A23, Amberlyst ® A24, and the like. Strong anion exchange resins<br>
typically have quaternary ammonium ions; a representative example is commercially<br>
available from Rohm &amp; Haas under the trade designation Amberlyst ® A26 OH, and the<br>
like.<br>
When a weakly basic exchanger is used, the mineral acid is removed according to<br>
the following reaction:<br>
H SO + 2Rz-NR ? RzNHR HSO<br>
2 4 2 2 4<br>
wherein "NR " represents an amine function on the weak base resin. When a<br>
strongly basic exchanger is used, both mineral and weakly acidic organic acids are<br>
removed. Initially the exchanger is converted from its hydroxide form to a phenolic<br>
form, and stronger organic acids then progressively replace the phenolic groups,<br>
followed by mineral acids:<br>
C 6 H 5 OH + Rz-OH ? Rz-OC 6 ' H 5 +H 2 O<br>
ROOH +Rz-OH ? Rz-OOR + H 2 O<br><br>
ROOH +Rz-OC 6 H 5 ? Rz-OOR + C 6 H 5 OH<br><br>
H 2 SO 4 +2RZ-OC 6 H 5 ? Rz 2 -SO 4 + 2C 6 H 5 OH<br><br>
H 2 SO 4 +2Rz-OOR ? Rz 2 -SO 4 + 2ROOH<br><br>
The effluent (120) from the anion exchanger (114) thus has a reduced acid<br>
content and is essentially neutralized relative to the feed (11 2) for acetone and phenol<br>
recovery. Downstream materials of construction are considered when specifying the<br>
anion unit (114).<br>
When adsorptive capacity in an operating ion exchanger becomes saturated, the<br>
exchanger is taken off-line for regeneration. As a practical consideration, resin<br>
saturation in industrial plant operation can fall short of absolute saturation due to<br>
economic and operating issues that are determined on plant-specific bases. Criteria<br>
by which operating "saturation" is defined can include minimizing reagent<br>
consumption, minimizing organic waste production, controlling waste quality,<br>
optimizing plant maintenance turnaround cycles, or maximizing product purities, for<br>
example. To replace the exchanger entering regeneration, an exchanger waiting in<br>
standby (refer below to Fig. 4) will be placed in operation before isolating the<br>
exchanger to be regenerated from the manufacturing streams. This description<br>
assumes cationic and anionic exchangers (106), (114) will be regenerated in a shared<br>
cycle. It is also possible to regenerate cation and anion exchangers independently at<br>
different frequencies or intervals, depending on respective rates of capacity<br>
utilization.<br>
Regeneration occurs in three stages, displacement, cation exchange resin<br>
regeneration, and anion exchange resin regeneration. WCP is first displaced from<br>
piping and vessels with nitrogen (1 22), flowing from the cation unit (106) through the<br>
anion unit (114), discharging to the product recovery line (120). The cation and anion<br>
units are de-pressured via the vent lines (110), (118). After displacement by nitrogen,<br>
residual liquid is recycled via lines (1 24), (1 26) to the cleavage product washing unit.<br>
Displacement preferably includes "sweetening off" the exchangers, which entails<br>
passing at least two bed volumes of acetone or other solvent through the cation and<br>
anion exchangers (106), (114) while maintaining the beds (102), (104) in a flooded<br>
condition. Sweetening off promotes good wetting of the exchanger media by aqueous<br>
regenerant streams. The solvent-purged resin can then be contacted with water for<br>
subsequent regeneration steps without complications of forming multiple liquid<br>
phases.<br>
The cation exchanger (1 06) is initially back-washed with cold condensate (128),<br>
for example at 1 5-30 ° C, discharging out of the top via line (1 30) to a phenolic water<br>
collection tank (1 32). The cation exchanger (106) is regenerated with sulfuric acid<br>
(1 34) diluted with cold condensate via line (1 36), which enters the top of the unit 106<br>
via a distributor located above the exchanger bed (102) and discharges via line (138)<br>
to the tank (132). Acid regeneration is followed by acid displacement via cold<br>
condensate line (1 36), with discharge (1 38) to the tank (1 32). The cation exchanger<br>
(106) is then fast rinsed via cold condensate line (1 36), continuing the discharge (1 38)<br>
to the phenolic water tank (132). After the phenol content of the fast rinse water<br>
discharge (1 38) falls to an acceptable concentration, for example below 0.5 weight<br>
percent, the fast rinse water discharge is diverted via line (140) directly to wastewater<br>
treatment, which can include dephenolation. Fast rinse is stopped when an acceptable<br>
low conductivity level has been reached, for example 10-20 micromhos.<br>
The anion exchanger (114) is initially back-washed with warm condensate via<br>
backwash line (142), for example at 30-50 ° C, with discharge via line (11 2) and<br>
discharge line (144) to the phenolic water collection tank (132). The anion exchanger<br>
(114) is regenerated with a distributor at the top using sodium hydroxide (caustic)<br>
solution (146) diluted with warm condensate via line (148), discharging via line (1 50)<br>
to the tank (1 32). Caustic regeneration is followed by displacement with warm<br>
condensate (148) and discharge (1 50) to the tank (1 32). The anion exchanger (114) is<br>
then fast-rinsed with cold condensate via lines (1 52), (11 2) and discharge (1 50) to the<br>
tank (1 32). When the phenol content of the fast rinse water falls to an acceptable<br>
concentration, for example below 0.5 weight percent, the fast rinse water is diverted<br>
via line (1 54) directly to wastewater treatment, which can include dephenolation. Fast<br>
rinse is stopped when an acceptable low conductivity has been reached, for example<br>
10-20 micromhos.<br>
After completing the cation and anion regeneration, the water is displaced with<br>
nitrogen (122) from the cation unit (106) through the anion unit (114), discharging via<br>
line (1 54) to wastewater treatment. The cation and anion units (106), (114) are de-<br>
pressured via vent lines (110), (118). Residual liquid is drained and recycled via lines<br>
(124), (126) to the cleavage product washing unit. The exchanger units (1 06), (1 14)<br>
are back-filled with polished WCP via line (1 56) and are left liquid-filled and off-line<br>
until needed for adsorption operation.<br>
A mixed-resin bed (200) is shown in Fig. 3, providing both a cation exchange bed<br>
(202) and an anion exchange bed (204) in a common vessel (206). Alternatively, the<br>
resins can comprise a heterogeneous mixture of each type of resin in a single bed (not<br>
shown). The resin beds (202), (204) are separated by a physical spacer such as<br>
perforated support plates (208) and/or a layer of inert resin (210). Upper main nozzle<br>
(212) and lower main nozzle (214) are used for ion removal by using nozzle (21 2) as<br>
an inlet and (214) as an outlet. Regeneration fluids can be introduced and removed at<br>
ports (216), (218), (220), as well as at the main nozzles (212), (214) for independent<br>
bed regeneration, which would proceed generally as described above. A representative<br>
compact bed system for mixed resins is commercially available from Rohm &amp; Haas<br>
under the trade designation Amberpack ® .<br>
For continuous process operations in plants configured using either separate<br>
cationic/anionic exchanger beds or mixed-bed exchangers, at least two sets of ion<br>
exchanger units are preferred. In a two-set system, one exchanger set will be in<br>
adsorption service, while another set is in regeneration/standby status, and any<br>
additional sets are in standby status. Fig. 4 shows a pair of exchangers (200a), (200b)<br>
with WCP feed line (202) and polished WCP effluent line (204) configured for up-flow<br>
operation by selectively opening or closing valves (206a), (206b), (208a), (208b),<br>
(210a), (210b), (212a), (212b), (214a), (214b). If the solid-body valves (206b), (208b),<br>
(210a), (212a), (214a) are closed and the outline-body valves (206a), (208a), (210b),<br>
(212b), (214b) are open, the drawing shows exchanger (200a) in adsorption service<br>
and exchanger (200b) in regeneration.<br>
Regeneration flows and discharges are provided through a piping network using<br>
the main vessel process inlet/outlet connections (216a), (216b), (218a), (218b). Line<br>
(220) introduces regenerant and flushing fluids via distributors for down-flow.<br>
Drainage and discharge use the header (222), which can also be used for the<br>
introduction of any upflow displacement and rinse streams in conjunction with vent<br>
header (224).<br>
Metal ion removal from WCP, particularly of sodium ions, has various technical and<br>
commercial advantages. Reducing the metal ion content of the WCP can increase the<br>
capacity of a phenol plant, typically by 5-10%, e.g. by increasing operating periods<br>
due to less frequent as well as shorter shutdowns for cleaning fouling deposits from<br>
heat transfer equipment in the distillation units. Ion removal from WCP can also lower<br>
utility costs by 5-10% at the same production rate, e.g. by reducing fouling in heat<br>
exchange networks in the product recovery system. The ion removal also removes<br>
salts that can form heavy-end organic byproducts, and thus reduces or eliminates the<br>
processing in heavy-end salt removal systems conventional in phenol plants, as well<br>
as heavy ends incineration and ash emissions.<br>
Example 1.Table 1 shows a composition of a simulated washed cleavage product<br>
synthesized for testing ion removal according to the present invention. Industrial phenol<br>
process systems, without coalescers, can produce a WCP with sodium levels in a range of<br>
about 25 to 30 parts per million by weight (ppmw). Higher values are not uncommon,<br>
however, and this case exhibits a sodium ion concentration of 61 ppmw. Coalescing can<br>
reduce sodium levels to 20 ppmw or slightly lower. The WCP composition in Table 1<br>
exemplifies a potential WCP feed to an ion exchange unit. This composition was used in the<br>
testing reported below in Examples 2-3.<br>
[t1]<br>
Example 2: Four cationic exchanger resins were tested in a batch-mode stirred reactor to<br>
measure of resin capacities to adsorb sodium ion from WCP. The tests used cationic<br>
macroreticular resins based on sulfonated, crosslinked styrene-divinylbenzene copolymers.<br>
Typical properties for each are shown in Table 2.<br>
[t2]<br>
Batch testing comprised stirring a 0.5 gram resin sample in 200 grams of synthetic<br>
washed cleavage product (see Example 1) containing about 61 ppmw of dissolved sodium.<br><br>
Four resin tests were run maintaining the solutions at a temperature of about 50o C to<br>
prevent phase separation. Sodium ion concentrations were measured for samples taken at<br>
1 5-minute intervals during a one-hour run. Table 3 lists the measured sodium ion<br>
concentrations at the tests sample intervals. The results show the four resins to have roughly<br>
equal adsorption capacities and differing adsorption rates.<br>
[t3]<br>
Example 3;The ion exchange adsorption rates and capacities for sodium and<br>
sulfate in WCP were next determined in a continuous-flow column test using a two-<br>
bed exchanger unit for the resins of Example 2. The synthetic WCP of Example ! was<br>
pumped through the two beds in series. The tests beds were fabricated using ½ -inch<br>
diameter stainless steel tubing, and the beds were immersed in a thermostatically<br><br>
controlled oil bath to maintain operating temperatures at about 50o C. The first bed<br>
held the Cation C4 resin of Example 2, above, and the second bed used a gel-type<br>
acrylic weak-base anion exchange resin in free-base form (Anion A1). Corresponding<br>
to the cation resin properties reported in Table 2, above, the Anion A resin had a<br>
typical anion exchange capacity of 5.98 eq/kg and 1.66 eq/L, and a moisture holding<br>
capacity of 60 weight percent.<br>
Sodium ion concentrations were measured in effluent samples from the second (anion)<br><br>
exchanger bed, collected at 4-hour intervals. Test conditions were maintained at 50° C, and<br>
the WCP flow rate was kept at 8 bed volumes per hour (BV/h). Based on the Cation C4<br>
adsorption capacity reported in Table 1 and the WCP feed concentration of 61 ppmw sodium<br>
set in Example 1, above, it was estimated that the test column of this example had a<br>
theoretical capacity to treat 830 bed volumes of the synthetic WCP solution to complete<br>
sodium removal. The test lasted until rising effluent sodium concentration began to emerge<br>
in the effluent of the second-stage resin bed, measured at 780 and 820 bed volumes.<br>
Analyses are reported in Table 4. The data are reported at increments of cumulative WCP<br>
volume treated, reported in terms of bed volume (BV), defined as the empty-space volume<br>
occupied by the resin in the column.<br>
[t4]<br>
The resin in each column was regenerated using regeneration flow rates about<br>
equal to the operating bed flow rate of 8 BV/h. Switching from the synthetic WCP feed,<br>
acetone solvent (neat) was pumped through the columns for 1 hour, followed by<br>
demineralized water for 1 hour. The cation bed was physically disconnected from the<br>
anion bed, and 6 BV (30 mL) of 1 N H SO was pumped through the cation bed,<br>
followed by approximately 24 BV demineralized water and 1 2 BV of acetone through<br>
the cation bed. Through the anion bed were pumped 3 BV (1 5 mL) of 1 Normal NaOH,<br>
followed by approximately 20 BV demineralized water and 12 BV of acetone. The<br>
cation bed was then connected to the anion bed and 8 BV of acetone pumped through<br>
the combined system. The feed was then switched to WCP for the next cycle of<br>
testing.<br>
Example 4: An additional series of tests were run with commercial WCP using a<br>
WCP flow rate of 37.5 BV/h. Fresh (new) resins were installed in the columns, using<br>
the Cation C4 and Anion Al. For this experiment, sample analyses were performed<br>
using ion-chromatography/mass spectrometry, indicating an average sodium<br>
concentration of 59 ppmw in the commercial WCP.<br>
Three adsorption campaigns were run, and after each adsorption run the columns were<br>
regenerated using the protocol of Example 3. Subsequent adsorption cycles were run using<br>
the same flow conditions as the first cycle. The data for the adsorption series are shown in<br>
Table 5. The results show that sodium levels were consistently reduced to levels of about 10<br>
ppmw or less through multiple cycles of resin loading and regeneration.<br>
[t5J<br>
Sulfate ion content was also measured in the effluent. The results presented in Table 6<br>
show a pronounced reduction in WCP sulfate concentrations paralleling the sodium ion<br>
concentrations.<br>
