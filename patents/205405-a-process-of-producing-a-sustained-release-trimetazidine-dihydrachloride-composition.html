A process of producing a sustained release tiimetaadine dihydrfu:;hloride composition<br>
APPLICANTS<br>
USV Limited, BSD Marg, Govandi Station Road, Govsctidi, Mumbai 400088, Maliarashtra, India, an Indian company<br>
INVENTORS Under Section 28(2)<br>
Dr  Gidwani  Suresh  Kumar, Singtiuikar Purashottam and Tewari Prashmit Kumar, dl Indian nationals and of USV Limited,  BSD Marg, Govandi Station Road, Govandi, Mumbai 400088, Mdiarashtra, India<br><br><br>
This invention relates to a process of producing a sustained release trimetazidine dihydrochloride composition.<br>
This invention also relates to sustained release trimetazidine pharmaceutical compositions and sustained release matrix pharmaceutical compositions containing 60 mg of trimetazidine dihydrochloride and hydrocolioid forming materials and or hydrophobic pol^^Tners and or other hydrophobic materials as a retardant, which release trimetazidine in a sustained and reproducible manner over a prolonged period of time to achieve the sustained effect of trimetazidine over a 24 hour period after oral administration.<br>
Trimetazidine dihydrochloride [l-(2, 3, 4-trimethoxybenzyl)-piperazine dihydrochloride] composed of formula<br><br>
is freely soluble in water, about 80%. It has two pKa values 4.32 and 8.95. It regulates ionic and extra cellular exchanges, correcting the abnormal flow of ions across the cell membrane caused by ischemia and  preventing  cellular  edema  caused by anoxia.  Thus it<br><br>
ensvires the function.! ng of the ion pumps and tJio sodium-potassium transmembrane flux and maintains the cellular homeostasis.<br>
Trimetazidine dihydrocliloride is used therapeutically, as a coronary vasodilator for the prophylactic treatment of anginal chest pain attack and during such attacks, during chorioretinal attacks as well as- for the treatment of giddiness of vascular origin (Vertigo of Maniere, acouphenous).<br>
Trimetazidine dihydrochloride is administered orally in<br>
doses of 40 to 60mg daily in divided doses as an<br>
immediate release preparation.  It is quickly absorbed<br>
and eliminated by the organism with plasma half life of<br>
around 6.0 ± 1.4 hours and T max of around 1.8 ± 0.7<br>
hours. Since it has a shorter plasma half life, in<br>
practice 20mg preparation is given twice or thrice a day<br>
in order to ensure relatively constant plasma levels but,<br>
due to the fact that it is absorbed quickly, these<br>
immediate release forms lead to maximum plasma levels<br>
immediately after administration and to a very low plasma<br>
level at the time of the next dose, r^sultinq in qreat<br>
differnncoG in peak and trough plar.ma levels at steady<br><br><br>
safe drug in the long treatment of chronic ischemic disorders. This compels the necessity of fabricating the immediate release dosage form into a sustained release once-a-day preparation for achieving regular and constant plasma levels, which is also favourable for compliance of the patient to his treatment.<br>
U.S. Patent 4,814,176 and U.S. Patent 4,755,544 by Makino, Yuji; Matugi, Hideo; Suzuki, Yoshiki; describes a sustained release preparation comprising a) chitin, chitosan or a mixture thereof or a) non-anionic cellulose ether, and b) anionic polymer compounds (Ganterz®) such as those having a carboxyl group, a sulfonic group or a group capable of providing the same. It mentions trimetazidine as one of the examples in the description which can be included in such systems but does not provide any detailed study on trimetazidine as a sustained release preparation.<br>
European Patent Application No. 0 673 649 by Huet de Barochez describes pharmaceutical compositions for the prolonged release of trimetazidine or of one of its pharmaceutically acceptable salts characterized in that prolonged release of trimetazidine is controlled by the use of a mixture of water insoluble polymer and a<br><br>
plasticizer coated on a reservoir system containing 80mg of trimetazidine dihydrochloride. However the in-vivo bioavailability study conducted on 12 volunteers shows steady state plasma concentration (Css) at around llGng/ml with 80mg dose.<br>
As reported in the literature, the maximum dose which usTially should be formulated in a sustained release dosage form should not exceed the total dose administered by conventional forms during the maintenance period. Optimization of sustained release dosage form design requires minimization of the total dose delivered and maximization of the duration of the drug release. However, European Patent Application No. 0 673 649 describes 80mg dose for prolonged release which is quite high compared to the total conventional dose, 40 to 60mg, in divided doses.<br>
In the present invention the same required steady state plasma concentration of trimetazidine can be achieved with just 60mg dose fabricated in a sustained release once-a-day matrix composition.<br>
Catherine Ilarpey, Pnncnle clauser, Claude I.abrid, vTcan-Lonis  Froyria  (Cardiovascular  Drug  Koviews,  19B0),<br><br>
determined the pharmacokinetic parameters after single and repeated doses of 20mq trimotazidine dihydrochloride. Their study shov/s steady state plasma concentration of 8 4.8 ± 14.8ng/ml with repeated b.l-d, and maximum plasma concentration C„,,., of 53.6 ± 9.0ng/ml v/ith single dose administration.<br>
Since a sustained release dosage form should give approximately the same steady state plasma concentration as that achieved with an immediate release dosage form, it has been decided to achieve Css around 84ng/ml with the sustained release compositions of the present invention.<br>
The present invention is based on the scientific calculation of the dose of trimetazidine dihydrochloride desired, based on the data available from in~vivo studies which are well documented in the scientific literature. The model used here is based on the mathematical equations provided by Dobrinska and Welling (1975) which give fairly accurate calculations about loading dose and maintenance dose for achieving sustained release effect.<br><br>
The dose of trimetazidi ne dihydrncliloridc is calculated<br>
bv considering the follov/ing phai-macokinetic values from<br>
the literature.<br>
Plasma concentration   Css = 8'1ng/:iil<br>
Elimination half life    t 1/2  -  6.0 honrs.<br>
Volume of distribution  Vd = 294 litres.<br>
T max  = 1.8 ± 0.7 hours.<br>
Using the Dobrinska and Welling model, the calculated loading dose is 15.87Cmg, the maintenance dose is 44.000mg and the total dose is 59.r;Bmg of trimetazidine dihydrochloride for achieving a sustained release effect for 2 4 hours.<br>
The object of the present invention is to prepare a composition containing 60mg of trimetazidine dihydrochloride by suitable technology shov/ing demonstrable release rate and facilitated in-vivo absorption for the desired period. The emphasis is to develop a simple monolithic system composed of hydrocolloid forming materials and/or hydrophobic polymers and/or other hydrophobic materials and other excipients with improved kineticr; of extended release doasge forms, and the simplest method producing it .<br><br>
According to the invention there is provided a process of producing a sustained release trimetazidine dihydrochloride composition comprising granulating trimetazidine dihydrochloride and hydrophobic material by hot melt granulation or by extrusion, sizing   and mixing the granules   with auxiliary  substances.<br>

In the present invention the pharmaceutical composition, such as tablets, may be produced by dry mixing of active substance v/ith diluent, hydrocolloid forming agent and/or hydrophobic polymer and/or other hydrophobic material and, optionally, further auxiliary substances and granulating this mixture with aqueous or organic solution of the binder. This may be follov.'ed by drying and corivnrt.i ng it into qrnnuln ol 30^m to 2.0mm, pro fornbly l00μm to 1.0mm, by milling and sizing. Subsequently,<br><br>
other  appropriate pharmaceutical auxiliary substances are admixed with the sized granules.<br>
In the present invention the pharmaceutical composition,<br>
such as tablets, may alternatively be produced by dry<br>
mixing of active substance, optionally further auxiliary<br>
substances, hydrophobic polymers and/or other hyd^opliol^ic<br>
material(s) and binder in an extruder. This mixture is<br>
extruded at a temperature of 40 to 120°C, preferably 60<br>
to 90°C, in a simple extruder used for injection m.olding<br>
of  plastics,  followed  by  extrusion  of  the  molted<br>
homogeneous mass with gradual cooling to room temperature<br>
and converting into granules of 30//[n to 2.0mm, preferably<br>
100/im to 1.0mm, by milling and sizing. Subsequently,<br>
other appropriate pharmaceutical auxiliary substances are<br>
admixed with the sized granules.<br>
In the present invention the pharmace\itical composition, such as tablets, may alternatively be produced by dry mixing of active substance and optionally further auxiliary substance and granulating this mixt\]re with hydrnphobi.c polymers and/or other hydrophobic material (s) by a hot melt granulation technique using a jacketed rapid mixer granulnt-or at-, a temperature of 10 to I2n"c, preferably 60 to 80"C.  TITIS is&gt;    foljov/ed by gradual<br><br>
cooling of the granulate mass to room temperature v;ith continuous mixing. The resulting mass is further granulated with aqueous or organic solution of the binder, followed by drying and converting it into granules of 30/xm to 2.0mm, preferably 100//m to 1.0mm, by milling and sizing.<br>
Subsequently appropriate other pharmaceutical auxilj.ary substances are admixed with the sjzed granules. The composition produced in this manner is subsequently processed in the usual manner to produce pharmaceutical dosage forms, such as by compression into tablets or by the filling of pressed slugs into capsules. The tablets can be coated with a film using standard coating processes and methods such as a conventional coating pan or fluid coating process.<br>
The sustained release tablets according to the present invention release trimetazidine dihydrochloride in a Controlled manner which provides an effect over a time period up to 24 hours, preferably over 18 hours as per the calculations.<br>
