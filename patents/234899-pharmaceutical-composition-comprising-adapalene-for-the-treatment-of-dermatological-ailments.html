				<td>The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition intended for the treatment of dermatological ailments.<br>
The  invention  relates  to the use of  6-[3-(l-adamantyl)-4-methoxyphenyl]-2-naphthanoic acid,   the chemical  structure of which  is as  follows:<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
in pharmaceutical compositions, in particular dermatological compositions, for the treatment of dermatological ailments with an inflammatory or proliferative component.<br>
6-[3-(1-Adamantyl)-4-methoxyphenyl]-2-naphthanoic acid (hereinafter referred to as adapalene) is a retinoid derived from naphthoic acid, having antiinflammatory properties. This molecule has been the subject of development for the topical treatment of common acne and dermatoses sensitive to retinoids.<br>
Adapalene has been described by the Applicant in Patent EP 0 199 636, and the latter has also provided a method for synthesizing this component in Patent EP 0 358 574.<br><br>
The Applicant markets adapalene formulated at a weight concentration of 0.1% in the form of an alcoholic lotion, an aqueous gel and a cream. These compositions are intended for the treatment of acne.<br>
Finally, adapalene is described as having a beneficial action on photo-damaged skin (Photographic assessment of the effects of adapalene 0.1 and 0.3% gels and vehicle on photo-damaged skin. M. Goldfarb et al., Clinical Dermatology, Vienna, Austria, May 2000).<br>
The Applicant has developed a new<br>
pharmaceutical composition containing adapalene at a weight concentration of 0.3%, intended for the treatment of dermatological ailments with an inflammatory or proliferative component. Specifically, the Applicant has noted, surprisingly, that, in addition to exhibiting better therapeutic efficacy compared to known compositions, the composition according to the invention exhibits good tolerance, comparable to those of the known compositions with a lower concentration of active principle.<br>
The results regarding tolerance observed in trials relating to photo-damaged skin (indication "photodamage"), obtained on individuals on average 65 years old, could not be exploited in the context of the present invention. Specifically, as regards use of adapalene on young individuals (in particular regarding acne with populations of teenagers or young adults),<br>
the skin exhibits very different physiopathological characteristics (presence of many lesions, in particular inflammatory lesions, modifying skin permeability, hypercornification of the follicular channel, immuno response, bacterial colonization of the skin (P. acnes), sebaceous hyperplasia with hyperseborrhea).<br>
Thus, a subject of the present invention is the use of 6-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-methoxyphenyl]-2-naphthanoic acid (adapalene), or its salts, for producing a pharmaceutical composition intended for the treatment of dermatological ailments with an inflammatory or proliferative component, characterized in that the pharmaceutical composition comprises 0.3% by weight of adapalene relative to the total weight of the composition.<br>
The term "adapalene salts" is intended to mean the salts formed with a pharmaceutically acceptable base, in particular in organic bases such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and aqueous ammonia, or organic bases such as lysine, arginine or N-methylglucamine.<br>
The term "adapalene salts" is also intended to mean the salts formed with fatty amines such as dioctylamine and stearylamine.<br>
The administration of the composition according to the invention may be carried out enterally, parenterally, topically or occularly.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition according to the invention is preferably applied topically.<br>
Enterally, the pharmaceutical composition may be in the form of tablets, gelatin capsules, dragees, syrups, suspensions, solutions, powders, granules, emulsions, or suspensions of microspheres or nanospheres or of lipid or polymeric vesicles for controlled release. Parenterally, the pharmaceutical composition may be in the form of solutions or suspensions for infusion or for injection.<br>
Topically, the pharmaceutical composition according to the invention is more particularly intended for treatment of the skin and the mucous membranes, and may be in the form of ointments, creams, milks, pomades, powders, impregnated pads, solutions, gels, sprays, lotions or suspensions. It may also be in the form of suspensions of microspheres or nanospheres or of lipid or polymeric vesicles, or of polymeric patches and hydrogels for controlled release. This composition for topical application may be in anhydrous form, in aqueous form or in the form of an emulsion.<br>
In a preferred variant of the invention, the pharmaceutical composition according to the invention is in the form of a gel, a cream or a lotion.<br>
In particular, the pharmaceutical composition may be an aqueous gel containing in particular one or more ingredients chosen from Carbomer 940 (BF Goodrich, Carbopol 980) and propylene glycol, or a cream containing in particular one or more ingredients chosen from perhydrosqualene, cyclomethicone, PEG-20 methyl glucose sequistearate and methyl glucose sequistearate, or a polyethylene glycol-based alcoholic lotion.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition according to the invention may also contain inert additives or combinations of these additives, such as<br>
wetting agents;<br>
flavour enhancers;<br>
preserving agents such as para-hydroxybenzoic acid<br>
esters;<br>
stabilizers;<br>
moisture regulators;<br>
pH regulators;<br>
osmotic pressure modifiers;<br>
emulsifiers;<br>
UV-A and UV-B screening agents;<br>
and antioxidants, such as a-tocopherol,<br>
butylhydroxyanisole or butylhydroxytoluene,<br>
superoxide dismutase, ubiquinol or certain metal-<br>
chelating agents.<br>
Of course, those skilled in the art will take care to select the optional compound(s) to be added to<br>
these compositions in such a way that the advantageous properties intrinsically attached to the present invention are not, or are not substantially, adversely affected by the envisaged addition.<br>
The use of adapalene for producing a<br>
pharmaceutical composition according to the invention is intended for the treatment of dermatological ailments with an inflammatory or proliferative component, chosen from:<br>
common acne, comedones, polymorphous acne,<br>
nodulocystic acne, acne conglobata, secondary acne<br>
such as solar, drug-related or occupational acne,<br>
widespread  and/or severe forms of psoriasis,<br>
ichtyoses and ichtyosiform states,<br>
Darier's disease,<br>
actinic keratoses,<br>
palmo plantar keratoderma and keratosis pilaris,<br>
leucoplasias and leucoplasiform states, lichen<br>
planus,<br>
any benign or malignant, severe and extensive<br>
dermatological preparations.<br>
The composition according to the invention is particularly suitable for the treatment of acne, such as common acne, and in particular for the treatment of common acne of moderate to moderately severe intensity.<br>
Various formulations of compositions comprising 0.3% of adapalene will now be given, by way<br>
of illustration in no way limiting in nature, as will results showing the therapeutic shape of the composition according to the invention and the good tolerance to it by the treated patients.<br>
EXAMPLE 1 - Formulation for topical administration<br>
In this example, various concrete topical<br>
formulations comprising 0.3% of adapalene are<br>
illustrated.<br>
The adapalene of the present example is<br>
provided by the company Sylachim, Division Finorga<br>
(product reference CF9611996).<br>

Adapalene	3 mg<br>
Carbomer 934 (BF Goodrich Carbopol 974)      4.5 mg<br>
Disodium edetate	1 mg<br>
PEG 20 methyl glucose sesquistearate         35 mg<br>
Methyl glucose sesquistearate	35 mg<br>
Glycerol	30 mg<br>
Methyl paraben	2 mg<br>
Cyclomethicone •	130 mg<br>

EXAMPLE 2 - Effectiveness of 0.3% adapalene gel and comparison with the 0.1% adapalene gel<br>
Tests were carried out on a population consisting of patients suffering from acne. In this population, three groups were differentiated; the first received a daily topical application of the 0.3% adapalene gel, the second a daily topical application of the 0.1% adapalene gel in the same vehicle, and the third is a control group which receives a daily topical application of the gel corresponding to the composition of the first two gels but containing no active agent.<br>
Figures 1 to 3 give the results obtained in terms of regression of the number of lesions according to their nature.<br>
These observations lead to the following conclusions:<br>
the 0.3% adapalene gel acts more rapidly than the 0.1% adapalene gel; specifically, from the fourth week of treatment, a difference is noted between the effectiveness of the 0.1% adapalene gel and the 0.3% adapalene gel;<br>
the 0.3% adapalene gel produces a clearly greater therapeutic effect after 8 weeks of treatment.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 - Tolerance regarding the 0.3% adapalene gel<br>
1.   Measurement of the plasma concentration of adapalene<br>
Eight individuals suffering from common acne of medium to moderately severe intensity are treated for 10 days with 2 g of 0.3% adapalene gel applied daily over 1000 cm2 of skin to be treated (face, chest and back) .<br>
Blood samples are taken on the days 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. During day 10, and following the final application, samples are taken at 1, 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16 and 24 hours.<br>
The plasma concentration of total adapalene (free and conjugated) in these samples is determined using the following protocol:<br>
enzymatic hydrolysis with a mixture of (3-<br>
glucurodinase and arylsulfatase;<br>
liquid-liquid extraction;<br>
passage through HPLC (high performance liquid<br>
chromatography);<br>
then fluorometric detection.<br>
This method makes it possible to detect a minimum concentration of 0.15 ng/ml and permits quantification of the adapalene for a minimum concentration of 0.25 ng/ml. Conclusion:<br>
The plasma concentrations of adapalene measured after 10 days of treatment are very low and confirm the safety of daily use of the 0.3% adapalene gel.<br>
2 a) Clinical observation of the side effects caused by topical administration of the 0.3% adapalene gel Two types of observation could be made:<br>
firstly, monitoring of the patients treated within the framework of point 1 of the present example 3 made it possible to note that tolerance to the 0.3% adapalene gel was good for all the patients. They all showed signs of dryness of the skin and of desquamation<br>
with a maximum on the seventh day of treatment, these symptoms then decrease up to the end of the treatment. 2 b) Furthermore, reference may also be made to the tests described in Example 2 above.<br>
In parallel to the measurements of<br>
effectiveness, the experimenters recorded the possible side effects caused, firstly, by topical application of the 0.3% adapalene gel and those caused, secondly, by application of the 0.1% adapalene gel; finally, the same observations were made on a control population to which a gel without active principle was administered.<br>
The observations are given in the table below.<br><br>
Upon reading this table, it is noted that the occurrence of undesirable side effects is statistically the same for the two gels with the different concentrations of active agent. The intensity of the undesirable side effects is average, which leads to the<br>
conclusion that the two gels are well-tolerated by the patients.<br>
On the basis of these observations, it may be concluded that patients suffering from common acne can be treated with 0.3% adapalene gel, such an exposure to adapalene being described as weak or very weak under clinical conditions.<br>
It therefore ensues from these various studies that a pharmaceutical composition containing 0.3% of adapalene exhibits a benefit/risk ratio which makes it particularly suitable for the treatment of dermatological elements with an inflammatory or proliferative component, and in particular, common acne.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
