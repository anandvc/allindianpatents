				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
AZO-METAL CHELATE DYE AND OPTICAL RECORDING MEDIUM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD	<br>
The present invention relates to an azo-metal chelate dye<br>
and the like suitable for high-speed recording. More<br>
specifically, the present invention relates to an azo-metal<br>
chelate dye which exhibits a specific film absorption spectrum<br>
and to an optical recording medium using this azo-metal chelate<br>
dye (in the present invention, an optical recording medium is<br>
referred to as "a disc" or "an optical disc" in some cases).<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In recent years, as computers become faster and hard disc<br>
capacity increases, volume of data which can be dealt with has<br>
increased. In response to this, large-capacity recording<br>
media are now in increasing demand and DVD-Rs have therefore<br>
been developed as large-capacity recordable CDs. Various<br>
types of dyes, including cyanine dyes and metal chelate dyes,<br>
have been proposed for use in the recording layer of DVD-Rs.<br>
A number of optical media have been proposed which use metal<br>
chelate dyes that are, excellent in light-resistance and<br>
weather-resistance among these dyes (See Patent Document 1).<br>
In addition, there is a report about an azo-metal chelate<br>
dye consisting of a metal and an azo dye compound, where the<br>
azo dye compound is formed of a diazo component including<br>
nitrogen atoms and a coupler component including a<br>
fluorine-substituted alkylsulfonylamino group (See Patent<br>
Document 2). Moreover, there is a report to the effect that<br>
the recording characteristics of an optical recording medium,<br>
such as light-resistance and durability, can be improved by<br>
using an azo-metal chelate dye as a recording layer of the<br>
optical recording medium. Here, the azo-metal chelate dye<br>
consists of a metal and an azo dye compound which includes a<br>
coupler component where an amino group on a benzene ring forms<br>
a fused heterocycle(See Patent document 3).<br><br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Problems to be solved by the Invention<br>
Incidentally, along with further increase in data volume,<br>
greater importance is given to increase in the speed with which<br>
information is recorded on optical recording media. For<br>
example, normal recording speed is approximately 3.5m/s in<br>
DVD-Rs (hereinafter, referred to as lX-speed recording in some<br>
cases) . However, there is a market demand for optical recording<br>
media capable of recording information thereon at a high speed<br>
faster than approximately 28m/s (hereinafter, referred to as<br>
8X-speed recording in some cases), which corresponds to eight<br>
times the speed IX.<br>
The development of dyes that are particularly suitable<br>
for high-speed recording is an issue to be addressed in order<br>
to respond to this market demand.<br>
In view of the foregoing issue, it is an object of the<br>
present invention to provide an azo-metal chelate dye capable<br>
of high-speed recording and an optical recording medium using<br>
this azo-metal chelate dye.<br>
Means for solving the problems<br>
In consideration of the fact that it is difficult to<br>
achieve high reflectivity of an optical recording medium in<br>
high-speed recording and the fact that it is possible to achieve<br>
high reflectivity of an optical recording medium if the high<br>
refraction index of a recording layer is increased, the present<br>
inventors set an objective of obtaining an azo-metal chelate<br>
dye with a higher refraction index. Specifically, the present<br>
inventors focused on the following two optical densities that<br>
can be obtained by measuring the absorption spectrum of a<br><br>
coating film including dyes. That is, the optical density 0D2<br>
at the absorption peak or absorption shoulder on the long<br>
wavelength side; and the optical density 0D1 at the absorption<br>
peak or absorption shoulder on the short wavelength side, both<br>
of which are in the absorption band ranging from 500 to 700 nm.<br>
The present inventors then determined that it is possible to<br>
provide dyes with a high refraction index by setting the 0D2/0D1<br>
value higher than a predetermined value, and therefore<br>
completed the present invention.<br>
Specifically, the gist of the present invention is an<br>
azo-metal chelate dye consisting of a metal and an azo dye<br>
compound. The azo-metal chelate dye is characterized in that<br>
the OD2/OD1 value measured by the following method is greater<br>
than 1.25.<br>
(Method of measuring the OD2/OD1 value)<br>
(1)	After adding 20 mg of azo-metal chelate dye into 2 g of an<br>
octafluoropentanol (OFP) solvent, supersonic dispersion is<br>
performed at temperatures between 50°C and 55°C for 60 minutes<br>
to obtain a solution A. The solution A is then cooled to room<br>
temperature (25±5°C) to obtain a solution B.<br>
(2)	The solution B is applied onto a polycarbonate substrate<br>
by spin coating at a rotating speed of 800 rpm. The substrate<br>
onto which the solution B has been spin coated is then annealed<br>
at 80°C for 5 minutes. The substrate thus obtained, onto which<br>
the solution B has been spin coated, being referred to as a coated<br>
substrate A.<br>
(3)	The absorption spectrum of the coated substrate A is<br>
measured in a range of 400 to 800 nm.<br>
(4)	Concerning the absorption peaks seen in a range of 500 to<br>
700 nm in the obtained absorption spectrum, the absorption peak<br>
at which the optical density is the greatest and the absorption<br>
peak at which the optical density is the second greatest are<br>
selected. Here, the optical density at the peak on the long<br>
wavelength side is defined as 0D2 and the optical density at<br>
the peak on the short wavelength side is defined as OD1. Then,<br>
the OD2/OD1 value is calculated.<br><br>
Another gist of the present invention is an optical<br>
recording medium having a recording layer on a substrate, on<br>
which recording and/or reading of information is performed by<br>
use of applied light. The optical recording medium is<br>
characterized in that the recording layer contains an azo-metal<br>
chelate dye consisting of a metal and an azo dye compound, and<br>
that the azo-metal chelate dye has the 0D2/0D1 value of greater<br>
than 1.25, which is measured by the following method.<br>
(Method of measuring the 0D2/0D1 value)<br>
(1)	After adding 20 mg of azo-metal chelate dye into 2 g of an<br>
octafluoropentanol (OFP) solvent, supersonic dispersion is<br>
performed at temperatures between 50°C and 55°C for 60 minutes<br>
to obtain a solution A. The solution A is then cooled to room<br>
temperature (25±5°C) to obtain a solution B.<br>
(2)	The solution B is applied onto a polycarbonate substrate<br>
by spin coating at a rotating speed of 800 rpm. The substrate<br>
onto which the solution B has been spin coated is then annealed<br>
at 80°C for 5 minutes. The substrate thus obtained, onto which<br>
the solution B has been spin coated, being referred to as a coated<br>
substrate A.<br>
(3)	The absorption spectrum of the coated substrate A is<br>
measured in a range of 400 to 800 nm.<br>
(4)	Concerning the absorption peaks seen in a range of 500 to<br>
700 nm in the obtained absorption spectrum, the absorption peak<br>
at which the optical density is the greatest and the absorption<br>
peak at which the optical density is the second greatest are<br>
selected. Here, the optical density at the peak on the long<br>
wavelength side is defined as OD2 and the optical density at<br>
the peak on the short wavelength side is defined as OD1. Then,<br>
the OD2/OD1 value is calculated.<br>
According to the present invention, an azo-metal chelate<br>
dye allowing for high-speed recording and an optical recording<br>
medium capable of high-speed recording using this azo-metal<br>
chelate dye are provided.<br><br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The best mode for carrying out the invention (hereinafter<br>
referred to as an embodiment) will be described in detail below.<br>
Note that, the present invention is not limited to the following<br>
embodiment, and can be implemented with various modifications<br>
within the spirit thereof.<br>
In the present embodiment, used is an azo-metal chelate<br>
dye consisting of a metal and an azo dye compound, which has<br>
the OD2/OD1 value of larger than 1.25 which is measured by a<br>
predetermined measurement method.<br>
A description will be given of a reason for setting the<br>
OD2/OD1 value to a predetermined value in the present<br>
embodiment.<br>
As a high-speed recording method, a method can be employed<br>
in which a dye having a higher optical density (absorption) at<br>
the recording wavelength is used for efficient absorption of<br>
the recording laser light. This is the method for shifting the<br>
wavelength at which the maximum absorption of the dye occurs<br>
to longer wavelengths longer than that of the dye used in the<br><br>
conventional low-speed recording. However, when such a dye<br>
having the absorption maximum at longer wavelengths is used,<br>
the reflectivity of a disc tends to be decreased compared to<br>
the conventional one. For this reason, when using the<br>
above-described method, it is often difficult to satisfy the<br>
requirement concerning the reflectivity of optical discs. For<br>
example in DVDs, the standard, "disc should have a reflectivity<br>
of 45% or more" for readout from the recording portion, is often<br>
difficult to be satisfied. Accordingly, when using the<br>
above-described method, the reflectivity often needs to be<br>
secured at the expense of the recording sensitivity to some<br>
extent.<br>
Different aspects from those in the above-described<br>
method were taken into consideration in the present embodiment,<br>
leading to identification of a dye for high-speed recording<br>
which can provide sufficient reflectivity even in high-speed<br>
recording and is excellent in recording sensitivity.<br>
Hereinafter, a detailed description thereof will be given.<br>
First, the present inventors set an objective of<br>
obtaining an azo-metal chelate dye with a higher refraction<br>
index on the basis of the knowledge that a dye film (recording<br>
layer) having a higher refraction index leads to higher<br>
reflectivity of a disc in a specific film thickness range (90<br>
nm or less)(See Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.H10-208303<br>
(JP10-208303), Figs. 1 to 5, for example).<br>
Meanwhile, in the absorption spectrum of the azo-metal<br>
chelate dye film, two absorption bands are seen in a range of<br>
500 to 700 nm: that is, an absorption band considered to be<br>
generated due to localization of electrons in ligands; and an<br>
absorption band considered to be generated due to interaction<br>
between a metal and the ligands (See Fig. 1, note that the Fig.<br>
1 will be described later).<br>
In the present embodiment, out of the two absorption bands<br>
seen in the 500 to 700 nm range, the optical density at the<br>
absorption peak on the short wavelength side and the optical<br>
density of the absorption peak at the long wavelength side are<br><br>
defined as 0D1 and OD2, respectively. It has been determined<br>
that an azo-metal chelate dye having particularly a high<br>
refraction index can be obtained by setting the OD2/OD1 value<br>
to greater than 1.25. As a result, an optical recording medium<br>
having sufficient reflectivity even in high-speed recording can<br>
be obtained. The 0D2/0D1 value is measured by the following<br>
method.<br>
(Method of measuring the 0D2/0D1 value)<br>
(1)	After adding 20 mg of azo-metal chelate dye into 2 g of an<br>
octafluoropentanol (OFP) solvent, supersonic dispersion is<br>
performed at temperatures between 50°C and 55°C for 60 minutes<br>
to obtain a solution A. The solution A is then cooled to room<br>
temperature (25±5°C) to obtain a solution B.<br>
(2)	The solution B is applied onto a polycarbonate substrate<br>
by spin coating at a rotating speed of 800 rpm. The substrate<br>
onto which the solution B is spin coated is then annealed at<br>
80°C for 5 minutes. The substrate thus obtained, onto which<br>
the solution B is spin coated, is referred to as a coated<br>
substrate A.<br>
(3)	The absorption spectrum of the coated substrate A is<br>
measured in a range of 400 to 800 nm.<br>
(4)	Concerning the absorption peaks seen in a range of 500 to<br>
700 nm in the obtained absorption spectrum, the absorption peak<br>
at which the optical density is the greatest and the absorption<br>
peak at which the optical density is the second greatest are<br>
selected. Here, the optical density at the peak on the long<br>
wavelength side is defined as OD2 and the optical density at<br>
the peak on the short wavelength side is defined as 0D1. The<br>
OD2/OD1 value is then calculated.<br>
Hereinafter, the above-described processes (1) to (4)<br>
will be described.<br>
First, 20 mg of azo-metal chelate dye, which is to be<br>
measured, is added into 2 g of an octafluoropentanol (OFP)<br>
solvent. Thereafter, supersonic dispersion is performed at<br>
temperatures between 50°C and 55°C for 60 minutes to obtain a<br>
solution A. The supersonic dispersion is performed in order<br><br>
to disperse or dissolve an azo-metal chelate dye into a solvent.<br>
Publicly known methods may be used for supersonic dispersion.<br>
Next, the solution A is cooled to room temperature<br>
(25±5°C) to obtain a solution B. A cooling method for the<br>
solution A is to leave the solution A at room temperature. Rapid<br>
cooling of the solution A by use of ice water and the like is<br>
not preferable because there is a possibility that<br>
crystallization is excessively accelerated. Here, after the<br>
solution A is cooled to room temperature, it is preferable that<br>
the solution A be filtrated through a filter (0.2 µm, for<br>
example). For the filter, Teflon filters (registered<br>
trademark, manufactured by Millipore Corporation) and the like<br>
can be cited. Filtration through a filter removes undisclosed<br>
components and components that have not been sufficiently<br>
dispersed in the solution A. The solution thus obtained is<br>
referred to as a solution B. However, if dyes that have not<br>
been dissolved in the solution A are observed, the supernatant<br>
thereof may be collected and used as the solution B.<br>
Note that, as apparent from the above description, the<br>
azo-metal chelate dye may be present in the "solution A" in a<br>
state where the whole or part of the azo-metal chelate dye is<br>
dissolved in the solution A. Alternatively, the azo-metal<br>
chelate dye may be present in the "solution A" in a state where<br>
the whole or part of the azo-metal chelate dye is dispersed in<br>
the solution A.<br>
Further, the solution B is applied onto a polycarbonate<br>
substrate by spin coating at a rotating speed of 800 rpm. For<br>
the spin-coating device, publicly known devices can be employed<br>
that are used to form recording layers of CD-Rs and DVD-Rs.<br>
Specifically, the solution B is dropped on the polycarbonate<br>
substrate which is rotating at the speed of 800 rpm, thereby<br>
giving a coating film made of the solution B on the polycarbonate<br>
substrate.<br>
Thereafter, the substrate onto which the solution B is<br>
spin coated is annealed at 80°C for 5 minutes. This is performed<br>
in order to remove the solvent in the solution B. The solvent<br><br>
is preferably removed completely from the solution B by<br>
annealing the substrate at 80°C for 5 minutes. However, the<br>
solvent does not necessarily have to be completely removed as<br>
long as the measurement of the absorption spectrum, which will<br>
be described later, can be performed well.<br>
The substrate thus obtained, onto which the solution B<br>
is spin coated, is referred to as a coated substrate A. The<br>
absorption spectrum of the coated substrate A is measured in<br>
a range of 400 to 800 nm. Publicly known methods may be employed<br>
to measure the absorption spectrum. Specifically, the sample<br>
light (400 to 800 nm) , which is used to measure the absorption<br>
spectrum, is applied from the substrate side of the coated<br>
substrate A. Air is used as a reference sample, and the<br>
intensity of light in the reference sample and the intensity<br>
of light passed through the coated substrate A are measured.<br>
Then, the absorption spectrum of the coated substrate A is<br>
measured.<br>
The following method can be cited as the more specific<br>
method for the absorption spectrum.<br>
A disc onto which an azo-metal chelate dye film is applied<br>
is cut out to have a sector shape. Using ultraviolet-visible<br>
spectrophotometer, measurement is made by applying light from<br>
the surface (on the substrate side) that is opposite to the dye<br>
film side. For the spectroscope and measurement conditions<br>
employed in the measurement, commercially available<br>
spectroscopes and general measurement conditions can be<br>
employed. For example, the U-3300(manufactured by Hitachi,<br>
Ltd.) was used in the examples of the present embodiment. The<br>
following measurement conditions were adopted: wavelength scan<br>
speed of 300 nm/min; optical density measuring (Absorbance)<br>
mode at a sampling cycle of 0.5 nm.<br>
Azo-metal chelate dyes having higher OD2/OD1 values<br>
measured by this method exhibit higher refraction indices . Fig<br>
2 is a graph showing the relation between the OD2/OD1 values<br>
and the refraction indices of dye films having various azo-metal<br>
chelate dyes to which the present embodiment is applied. The<br><br>
measurement result shown in Fig. 2 also establishes that the<br>
higher 0D2/0D1 value leads to a higher refraction index. The<br>
measurement result shown in Fig. 2 indicates that the maximum<br>
refraction index of the film of the present embodiment, having<br>
the value of 1.25 or more, approximately equals to 3.3.<br>
Because sufficient reflectivity for high-speed recording<br>
application can be obtained, the 0D2/0D1 value is greater than<br>
1.25, preferably 1.26 or more, more preferably 1.27 or more,<br>
further preferably 1.28 or more, and particularly preferably<br>
1.29 or more. In addition, the higher OD2/OD1 values are<br>
preferable in consideration of the purpose of the present<br>
invention. However, the value is preferably 5 or less, more<br>
preferably 3 or less. If the value is greater than 5, the width<br>
of the absorption band is narrow, which may cause absorption<br>
to be dependent largely on wavelength.<br>
It is to be noted that, in some cases, two or more distinct<br>
absorption peaks are not identified in the region raging from<br>
500 to 700 nm when the absorption spectrum of a dye film of an<br>
azo-metal chelate dye is measured by the above-described<br>
measurement method. An example of such a case is where the<br>
absorption spectrum in the region raging from 500 to 700 nm is<br>
observed as an absorption spectrum having a plurality of<br>
absorption shoulders. In this case, among the obtained peaks,<br>
the absorption peak or absorption shoulder at which the optical<br>
density is the greatest and the absorption peak or absorption<br>
shoulder at which the optical density is the second greatest<br>
may be used to calculate the OD2/OD1 value.<br>
Fig. 5 shows an example of the absorption spectrum of a<br>
dye film of an azo-metal chelate dye in a case where an absorption<br>
shoulder is seen. Concerning the absorption spectrum shown in<br>
Fig. 5, a method of determining the OD2/OD1 value will be<br>
described by way of example. When the absorption spectrum-as<br>
shown in Fig. 5 is obtained, the absorption shoulder observed<br>
on the short wavelength side may be defined as OD1 in the<br>
absorption spectrum ranging from 400 to 700 nm.<br>
As a preferable example of dyes having a high OD2/OD1 value,<br><br>
azo-metal chelate dyes having a specific structure can be cited.<br>
It has been determined that a disc using these dyes in the<br>
recording layer exhibits stable higher reflectivity than that<br>
of a disc using the conventional dyes in the recording layer,<br>
even when the recording layer has the absorption maximum<br>
wavelength at longer wavelengths.<br>
Hereinafter, a description will be given of an example<br>
of an azo-metal chelate dye having the above-described specific<br>
structure.<br>
First, 1,3,4-thiadiazole ring is selected as the diazo<br>
component among heterocyclic rings including nitrogen atoms.<br>
The diazo component is combined with the coupler component<br>
having condensed rings which include a fluorine-substituted<br>
alkylsulfonylamino group and an amino group, thereby preparing<br>
an azo dye compound. The recording layer containing an<br>
azo-metal chelate dye which is formed of this azo dye compound<br>
and a metal is preferable because it may exhibit excellent<br>
light-resistance and weather-resistance. In addition, the<br>
azo-metal chelate dye in which the 1,3, 4-thiadiazole ring, that<br>
is, the diazo component, is substituted with a hydrogen atom<br>
or a ester group is preferable because it tends to exhibit the<br>
0D2/0D1 value that satisfies the requirements of the present<br>
embodiment. This is considered to be due to the fact that<br>
azo-ligands may coordinate to a metal ion with small steric<br>
hindrance, which may be accomplished by selecting, as a<br>
substituent of the diazo component, a hydrogen atom which is<br>
smallest in terms of spatial structure or an ester group which<br>
is highly polarized. A specific example of this structure is<br>
as follows:<br>
(formula 1)<br><br><br>
(where R1 represents a hydrogen atom or an ester group<br>
represented as CO2R3, R3 represents a straight or branched chain<br>
alkyl group which may be substituted or a cycloalkyl group which<br>
may be substituted, R2 represents a straight or branched chain<br>
alkyl group which may be substituted, at least one of X1 and<br>
X2 represents a NHSO2Y group, Y represents a straight or branched<br>
chain alkyl group which is substituted with at least two<br>
fluorine atoms, R4 and R5 independently represents a hydrogen<br>
atom or a straight or branched chain alkyl group which may be<br>
substituted, and R6, R7, R8 and R9 independently represents a<br>
hydrogen atom or a alkyl group having 1 to 2 carbon atoms)<br>
Chelate bonds are formed between the azo dye compound<br>
represented by the above-described formula (1) and a metal,<br>
thereby forming an azo-metal chelate dye to which the present<br>
embodiment is applied. In addition, the azo dye compound<br>
represented by the above-described formula (1) is formed in such<br>
a way that the diazo component, which is 1,3, 4-thiadiazole ring,<br>
is combined with the coupler component having condensed rings<br>
including a fluorine-substituted alkylsulfonylamino group and<br>
an amino group.<br>
A substituent Ri in the diazo component represents a<br>
hydrogen atom or an ester group represented as CO2R3. R3<br>
represents a straight or branched chain alkyl group which may<br>
be substituted or a cycloalkyl group which may-be substituted.<br>
A substituent in R3 is not particularly limited as long as it<br>
is a typical element such as oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur, in<br>
addition to a halogen atom. As R3, for example, an<br>
unsubstituted straight or branched chain alkyl group, an<br><br>
unsubstituted cycloalkyl group, a fluorine-substituted<br>
straight or branched chain alkyl group, or a straight or<br>
branched chain alkyl group which is substituted with an alkoxy<br>
group is preferable. Particularly preferably, R3 represents<br>
a hydrogen atom; a straight or branched chain alkyl group having<br>
1 to 4 carbon atoms such as an ethyl group, a propyl group, an<br>
isopropyl group, a butyl group, an isobutyl group, a t-butyl<br>
group and a sec-butyl group; and a cycloalkyl group having 3<br>
to 8 carbon atoms such as a cyclopopyl group, a cyclobutyl group,<br>
a cyclopentyl group, a cyclohexyl group and a cycloheptyl group.<br>
From the reason that the steric hindrance effect is small, a<br>
straight chain alkyl group having 1 to 2 carbon atoms such as<br>
a methyl group and an ethyl group; and a cycloalkyl group having<br>
3 to 6 carbon atoms such as a cyclopentyl group and a cyclohexyl<br>
group are particularly preferable.<br>
From the viewpoint of satisfying the certain 0D2/0D1<br>
value in the present embodiment, the substituent Ri in the diazo<br>
component is most preferably a hydrogen atom which shows<br>
smallest steric hindrance effect. As preferable examples of<br>
the specific compound for this diazo component, the compounds<br>
having the structures shown in the following (formulae 2) can<br>
be cited,<br>
(formulae 2)<br><br><br>
At least one of Xi and X2 in the coupler component<br>
represents NHS02Y. In this case, preferably, any one of Xi and<br>
X2 represents NHS02Y, and more preferably, Xi represents NHS02Y.<br>
X2 is not particularly limited in a case where Xx represents<br>
NHS02Y, and Xi is not particularly limited in a case where X2<br>
represents NHS02Y. However, a hydrogen atom is preferable in<br>
consideration of simplicity of synthesis.<br>
Y represents a straight or branched chain alkyl group<br><br>
which is substituted with at least two fluorine atoms. For the<br>
alkyl group, a straight or branched chain alkyl group having<br>
1 to 6 carbon atoms is more preferable. More preferably, Y<br>
represents a straight chain alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon<br>
atoms. The number of fluorine atoms to be introduced is<br>
generally 2 or more; whereas normally 7 or less, preferably 5<br>
or less, and more preferably 3 or less. Specific example of<br>
Y includes a difluoromethyl group, a trifluoromethyl group, a<br>
pentafluoroethyl group, a pentafluoropropyl group, a<br>
2,2,2-trifluoroethyl group and a 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl group.<br>
For Y, a trif luoromethyl group and a 2, 2, 2-trif luoroethyl group<br>
are particularly preferable.<br>

straight or branched chain alkyl group which may be substituted.<br>

group, an ethylmethylamino group and a butylpentylamino group;<br>
and the like can be cited.<br>
A straight or branched chain alkyl group and an alkoxy<br>
group may be further substituted with substituents cited as R4<br>
and R5. A hydrogen atom, a straight chain alkyl group having<br>
1 to 6 carbon atoms and an alkoxy group having 1 to 8 carbon<br>
atoms are preferable for R4 and R5. A hydrogen atom, an alkyl<br>
group having 1 to 2 carbon atoms and an alkoxy group having 1<br>

the above-described alkyl and alkoxy groups are not substituted.<br>
A hydrogen atom, a methyl group, an ethyl group and a methoxy<br>
group are particularly preferable for R4 and R5.<br>
R2 represents a straight or branched chain alkyl group<br>
which may be substituted. For R2, for example, a straight chain<br>
alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms such as a methyl group,<br>
an ethyl group, a propyl group, a butyl group, a pentyl group<br><br>
and a hexyl group; a branched chain alkyl group having 3 to 8<br>
carbon atoms such as an isopropyl group, a sec-butyl group, an<br>

diisobutylamino group, a di-t-butylamino group, a dihexylamino<br>

and the like can be cited.<br>
Among these, an unsubstituted straight chain alkyl group<br>
having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or an unsubstituted branched chain<br>
alkyl group having 3 to 8 carbon atoms are preferable for R2.<br>
When unsubstituted straight chain alkyl groups are used, the<br>
number of carbon atoms is generally set to range from 1 to 6<br>
inclusive. The number of carbon atoms is preferably set to 5<br>
or less, more preferably set to 4 or less. Meanwhile, when<br>
unsubstituted branched chain alkyl groups are used, the number<br>
of carbon atoms is set to range from 3 to 8 inclusive. The number<br>
of carbon atoms is preferably set to 7 or less, more preferably<br>
set to 6 or less, further preferably set to 5 or less, and<br>
particularly preferably set to 4 or less. A methyl group, an<br>
ethyl group, a propyl group, an isopropyl group and an isopropyl<br>
group are particularly preferable for R2.<br>
Each of R6, R7, R8 and R9 independently represents a<br>
hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 2 carbon atoms. Use<br>
of hydrogen atoms and alkyl groups having 1 to 2 carbon atoms<br>
is preferable because it makes it easy to set the 0D2/0D1 value<br>
to a predetermined value. In alkyl groups having 1 to 2 carbon<br>
atoms, a hydrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom may be substituted<br>
with other substituents (such as a halogen atom) . However, the<br>
alkyl groups are preferably unsubstituted alkyl groups. For<br>
alkyl groups having 1 to 2 carbon atoms, a methyl group and an<br>
ethyl group can be cited. In light of simplicity of synthesis<br>
and spatial structure, a hydrogen atom is the most preferable<br>
for R6, R7, R8 and R9.<br>
The molecular weight of the azo dye compounds represented<br>
by the general formula (1) is generally 2000 or less. Among<br>
others, the azo dye compounds with the molecular weight of 1000<br>
or less are preferable because they lead to dyes that exhibit<br>
increased solubility in solvents and are excellent in<br><br>
light-resistance, weather-resistance and high reflectivity.<br>
Among the azo dye compounds represented by the general formula<br>
(1), compounds shown in the following (formulae 3 to 30) can<br>
be cited as the specific examples..<br>
[formulae 3]<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Except for structure, there are no limitations on<br>
azo-metal chelate dyes. However, in consideration of applying<br>
the azo-metal chelate dyes to optical recording media, which<br>
are capable of recording and reading by means of laser light<br>
with short wavelengths and are needed in ever-greater numbers<br>
in the future, dyes that exhibit the maximum absorption at a<br>
wavelength of 700 nm or less are preferable, and dyes that<br>
exhibit the maximum absorption at a wavelength ranging from 650<br>
to 500 nm are further preferable, which are measured for a single<br>
layer dye film.<br>
In azo-metal chelate dyes to which the present embodiment<br>
is applied, as metals that form a chelate with the azo dye<br><br>
compounds represented by the formula (1), various kinds of<br>
metals that can form a complex can be employed. For such metals,<br>
elements belonging to 9, 10 and 11 groups are preferable.<br>
Particularly preferably, at least one such metal is selected<br>
from the group consisting of Co, Ni, Cu and Pd. This is because<br>
use of the above-described metals makes the shape of absorption<br>
spectrum favorable and improves solubility in various solvents,<br>
light-resistance and durability.<br>
Hereinafter, an optical recording medium having in a<br>
recording layer an azo-metal chelate dye to which the present<br>
embodiment is applied will be described.<br>
The optical recording medium to which the present<br>
embodiment is applied has a substrate, and a recording layer<br>
including an azo-metal chelate dye that has the OD2/OD1 value<br>
of which is greater than 1.25. Preferably, the optical<br>
recording medium of the present embodiment has a substrate, and<br>
a recording layer including an azo-metal chelate dye consisting<br>
of the azo dye compound represented by the formula (1) and a<br>
metal. The optical recording medium may be a layered-structure<br>
in which an under coat layer, a metal reflecting layer, a<br>
protection layer and the like are provided on a substrate as<br>
appropriate. For the preferable example of the<br>
layered-structure, for example, an optical recording medium<br>
having high reflectivity can be cited in which a recording layer,<br>
a metal reflecting layer and a protection layer are provided<br>
on a substrate.<br>
Hereinafter, by taking an optical recording medium having<br>
such a layered-structure as an example, a description will be<br>
given of an optical recording medium to which the present<br>
embodiment is applied.<br>
Basically, the material for the substrate of the optical<br>
recording medium to which the present embodiment is applied may<br>
be one that is transparent to the recording light and reading<br>
light. For example, polymer material such as polycarbonate<br>
resin, vinyl chloride resin, acrylic resin such as methyl<br>
polymethacrylate, polystyrene resin, epoxy resin, vinyl<br><br>
acetate resin, polyester resin, polyethylene resin,<br>
polypropylene resin, polyimide resin and amorphous polyolef in,<br>
inorganic material such as glass can be used. Polycarbonate<br>
resin is preferably used in light of high throughput, cost,<br>
resistance to hygroscopicity and the like.<br>
Using injection molding and the like, these materials for<br>
a substrate are molded into a disc shape to serve as a substrate.<br>
It is to be noted that guide grooves and pits may be formed on<br>
the surface of the substrate when needed. It is preferable that<br>
these guide grooves and pits be provided at a time when the<br>
substrate is molded. However, it is also possible to provide<br>
guide grooves and pits on the substrate by use of an ultraviolet<br>
curing resin layer. When the guide grooves have spiral shapes,<br>
it is preferable that the groove pitch be in a range of around<br>
0.4 to 1.2 µm inclusive, particularly preferably in a range of<br>
around 0.6 to 0.9 µm inclusive.<br>
In terms of the atomic force microscope (AFM) measurement<br>
value, it is preferable that the groove depth is generally in<br>
a range of 100 to 200 nm inclusive. In particular, the groove<br>
depth is preferably in a range of around 150 to 180 nm inclusive<br>
in order to achieve from 1X recording, meaning low-speed, to<br>
8X recording meaning high-speed. When the groove depth is<br>
greater than the lower limit, large modulated amplitude can be<br>
obtained even in a low-speed recording, when the groove depth<br>
is less than the upper limit, sufficient reflectivity can be<br>
easily obtained. The groove width is generally in a range of<br>
0 .20 to 0. 40 µm inclusive in terms of the atomic force microscope<br>
(AFM) measurement value. For high-speed recording application,<br>
it is further preferable that the groove width be in a range<br>
of 0.28 to 0.33 µm inclusive. When the groove width is greater<br>
than the lower limit, sufficient push-pull signal amplitude can<br>
be easily obtained. Moreover, deformation of the substrate has<br>
a significant influence on the amplitude of the recording signal.<br>
For this reason, when recording at speeds higher than 8X,<br>
setting the groove width to be greater than the above lower limit<br>
will suppresses the influence of thermal interference,<br><br>
facilitating to obtain small jitter. Furthermore, wide<br>
recording power margin is provided to give excellent recording<br>
characteristics and recording conditions, for example,<br>
tolerance to variations in laser power is increased. In the<br>
case where the groove width is less than the upper limit, when<br>
performing low-speed recording such as 1X, it is possible to<br>
suppress thermal interference in recording marks and to obtain<br>
excellent jitter value.<br>
The optical recording medium to which the present<br>
embodiment is applied can record information, such as address<br>
information, information about type of media, condition of<br>
recording pulse and optimal recording power. Formats such as<br>
LPP and ADIP, which are described in DVD-R and DVD+R standards,<br>
may be used to record the information.<br>
In the optical recording medium to which the present<br>
embodiment is applied, a recording layer including an azo-metal<br>
chelate dye having the above-described specific properties and<br>
structure is formed on a substrate, or on an under coat layer<br>
and the like which have been provided as required. The<br>
recording layer including such an azo-metal chelate dye has high<br>
sensitivity, high reflectivity and relatively high<br>
decomposition temperature (or the temperature at which the<br>
amount begins to decrease in terms of TG-DTA measurement) . The<br>
recording layer including the above-described azo-metal<br>
chelate dye can achieve high-speed recording with single<br>
composition.<br>
As the conventional recording layers which have been<br>
regarded to have high sensitivity, there are known a recording<br>
layer which uses a dye having higher absorption coefficient at<br>
the recording light wavelength and a recording layer using a<br>
low-temperature decomposition dye which decomposes at<br>
temperatures lower than 240°C. However, in the former case,<br>
it is difficult to obtain a reflectivity of 40% or more using<br>
this dye as a single component. In addition, in the latter case,<br>
there have been the following problems: that is, deterioration<br>
owing to reading light power; crosstalk that occurs because of<br><br>
the tendency of recording marks to spread; and jitter tends to<br>
be large because of thermal interference.<br>
On the other hand, according to the recording layer<br>
including the azo-metal chelate dye having the above-described<br>
specific properties and structure, it is possible to solve these<br>
problems and to achieve high-speed recording. Higher<br>
reflectivity is obtained in spite of the fact that the dye used<br>
in this recording layer has the absorption peak at longer<br>
wavelengths, that is, the dye has a high absorption coefficient<br>
at recording and reading wavelengths. It is conceivable that<br>
reason for this is due to a high refraction index in the recording<br>
layer.<br>
Generally, it is believed that it is preferable for the<br>
recording layer of an optical recording medium to have a<br>
refraction index ranging from 2 to 3 and an extinction<br>
coefficient ranging from 0.03 to 0.1 within (recording and<br>
reading light wavelength) ± 3 nm. In order to perform<br>
high-speed recording, it is preferable that the refraction<br>
index in this range be as high as possible (for example, 2.5<br>
or more) . This is preferable because a higher refraction index<br>
makes recording modulation amplitude larger, since it is<br>
possible to ensure large optical path difference at the same<br>
film thickness. The higher the refraction index is, the higher<br>
the reflectivity of a disc is, thereby leading to high recording<br>
modulation amplitude with thinner film thickness. Use of this<br>
recording layer having a high refraction index allows for<br>
reduction in the film thickness, which is required for<br>
high-speed recording at 8X or more, and realizes excellent<br>
high-speed recording because thermal interference and<br>
crosstalk are suppressed.<br>
As methods of forming the recording layer of the optical<br>
recording medium to which the present embodiment is applied,<br>
thin-film forming methods that are generally performed, such<br>
as vacuum deposition method, sputtering method, doctor blade<br>
method, casting method, spin coating method and dipping method<br>
can be cited. From the viewpoint of mass productivity and cost,<br><br>
spin coating method is particularly preferable.<br>
When spin coating method is used for forming a film, the<br>
rotation speed is preferably in a range of 500 to 10000 rpm.<br>
In some cases, treatments like annealing or application of vapor<br>
of solvent may be performed after spin coating. Application<br>
solvents, which are used when application methods such as doctor<br>
blade method, casting method, spin coating method and dipping<br>
method are employed to form a recording layer, are not<br>
particularly limited unless the substrate is damaged. For the<br>
application solvent, for example, a ketone alcohol solvent such<br>
as diacetone alcohol, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-butanone; a<br>
cellosolve solvent such as methylcellosolve and<br>
ethylcellosolve; a chain hydrocarbon solvent such as n-hexane<br>
and n-octane; a cyclic hydrocarbon solvent such as cyclohexane,<br>
methylcyclohexane, ethylcyclohexane, dimethyl cyclohexane,<br>
n-butylcyclohexane, t-butylcyclohexane and cyclooctane; a<br>
perfluoroalkylalcohol solvent such as tetrafluoropropanol,<br>
octafluoropentanol and hexafluorobutanol; a<br>
hydroxycarboxylate solvents such as methyl lactate, ethyl<br>
lactate and methyl isobutylate; and the like can be cited.<br>
When forming a recording layer, additives such as<br>
quencher, ultraviolet absorber, adhesive and the like may be<br>
mixed with the above-described dye as appropriate.<br>
Alternatively, substituents having various effects such as<br>
quenching effect and ultraviolet absorbing effect can be<br>
introduced into the above-described dye. As a singlet oxygen<br>
quencher to be added to increase light-resistance and<br>
durability of the recording layer, metal complexes such as<br>
acethylacetonate complex, bisdithiol complex, such as<br>
bisdithio-α-diketone complex and bisphenyldithiol complex,<br>
thiocatehol complex, salicylaldehydeoxime complex, and<br>
thiobisphenolate complex are preferable. In addition, amine<br>
compounds are also preferable.<br>
Moreover, in order to improve recording characteristics<br>
and the like, other dyes may be used together. In addition,<br>
an azo-metal chelate dye to which the present embodiment is<br><br>
applied can be used in combination with a dye used for low-speed<br>
recording in order to implement both of high-speed recording<br>
and low-speed recording. However, the mixing ratio thereof<br>
should be less than 60% with respect to the weight of the<br>
azo-metal chelate dye, preferably 50% or less, and further<br>
preferably 40% or less. Meanwhile, when the above-described<br>
dye for low-speed recording is used together, the mixing ratio<br>
is generally set to 0.01% or more. If the mixing ratio of the<br>
dye for low-speed recording is excessively high, it is likely<br>
that the recording sensitivity required for high-speed<br>
recording at 8X or more cannot be obtained<br>
As dyes which can be used together, azo dye compounds which<br>
belong to the same family as those represented by the formula<br>
(1) can be cited. Moreover, as dyes that can be used together,<br>
azo dyes or azo-metal chelate dyes that belong to the same family<br>
as the azo-metal chelate dyes having the above-described<br>
specific properties or structures, cyanine dyes, squarylium<br>
dyes, naphthoquinone dyes, anthraquinone dyes, porphyrin dyes,<br>
tetrapyraporphyrazine dyes, indophenol dyes, pyrylium dyes,<br>
thiopyrylium dyes, azulenium dyes, triphenylmethane dyes,<br>
xanthene dyes, indanthrene dyes, indigo dyes, thioindigo dyes,<br>
merocyanine dyes, bis-pyromethene dyes, thiazin dyes, acridine<br>
dyes, oxazine dyes, indoaniline dyes and the like can be cited,<br>
and dyes belonging to other families may also be used. As agents<br>
that accelerate thermal decomposition of dyes, metallic<br>
compounds such as metal anti-knocking agents, metallocene<br>
compounds and acetylacetonate metal complex can be cited.<br>
Moreover, binders, leveling agents and antifoaming<br>
agents can be used together as needed. As preferable binders,<br>
polyvinylalcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, nitrocellulose,<br>
cellulose acetate, ketone resin, acryl resin, polystylene resin,<br>
urethane resin, polyvinylbutyral, polycarbonate and<br>
polyolefin can be cited.<br>
The film thickness of the recording layer (dye layer) is<br>
not particularly limited. However, it is preferable that the<br>
thickness be in a range of 50 to 300 nm inclusive. When the<br><br>
film thickness of the dye layer is greater than the<br>
above-described lower limit, the influence of thermo diffusion<br>
can be suppressed, and therefore it is facilitated to perform<br>
favorable recording. In addition, occurrence of distortion in<br>
recording signals is reduced, and therefore it is easy to make<br>
the signal amplitude large. When the film thickness of the dye<br>
layer is less than the above-described upper limit, it is easy<br>
to make the reflectivity higher and to provide excellent reading<br>
signal characteristics.<br>
Moreover, the groove-portion film thickness of the<br>
recording layer is generally in a range of 90 to 180 nm inclusive,<br>
preferably in a range of 50 to 90 nm inclusive. The<br>
portion-between-grooves film thickness is generally in a range<br>
of 50 to 100 nm inclusive, preferably in a range of 30 to 70<br>
nm inclusive. When the groove-portion film thickness or the<br>
portion-between-grooves film thickness is greater than the<br>
above-described lower limit, it is possible to secure large<br>
amplitude of the address information (LPP and ADIP), thereby<br>
making it easy to reduce the occurrence of errors. When the<br>
groove-portion film thickness or the portion-between-grooves<br>
film thickness is less than the above-described upper limit,<br>
it is possible to suppress the influence of heat accumulation<br>
in recording marks and to prevent increase in crosstalk, thereby<br>
making it easy to provide small jitter.<br>
The optical recording medium to which the present<br>
embodiment is applied can exhibit a reflectivity of 40% or more<br>
by combining the recording layer including the azo-metal<br>
chelate dye having the above-described specific properties or<br>
structure and the form of the groove provided on a substrate.<br>
Thus, for example, DVD-Rs (in terms of standards, there are two<br>
types: DVD-R and DVD+R, which are collectively referred to as<br>
DVD-R hereinafter) can be realized that have reading<br>
compatibility with DVD-ROMs. Note that, reflectivity means<br>
the value measured by using a disc reader (such as a DVD player,<br>
DVD-ROM test system and DVD drive) in which laser having<br>
wavelength ranging from 650+10 nm to 650-5 nm is mounted on a<br><br>
pickup when grooves on an optical disc are tracked.<br>
Next, a reflecting layer is preferably formed on the<br>
recording layer to have a thickness from 50 to 300 ran. For<br>
materials used for the reflecting layer, material exhibiting<br>
sufficient reflectivity at the reading light-wavelength can be<br>
used. For example, metal such as Au, Al, Ag, Cu, Ti, Cr, Ni,<br>
Pt, Ta and Pd can be separately used. Alternatively, alloy of<br>
these metals can also be used. Among these, Au, Al and Ag have<br>
high reflectivity and therefore are suited for the material for<br>
the reflecting layer. In particular, Ag and Ag alloy have<br>
excellent reflectivity and thermal conductivity and are<br>
therefore preferable. In addition to these metals, the<br>
following elements may be contained therein. For example,<br>
metals and semimetals such as Mg, Se, Hf, V, Nb, Ru, W, Mn, Re,<br>
Fe, Co, Rh, Ir, Cu, Zn, Cd, Ga, In, Si, Ge, Te, Pb, Po, Sn and<br>
Bi can be cited. Among these, material which contains Ag as<br>
a principal component is particularly preferable, because it<br>
is not expensive to manufacture, has tendency to exhibit<br>
increased reflectivity when it is combined with azo-metal<br>
chelate dye, and provides white beautiful ground color when a<br>
print-receiving layer is provided, which will be described<br>
later. Here, the principal component means element accounting<br>
for 50% or more of the material. It is also possible that thin<br>
films having low refraction index are alternately laminated<br>
with thin films having high refraction index to form a<br>
multi-layered film by using material composed of other than<br>
metals, and this multi-layered film is used as the reflecting<br>
layer.<br>
As methods for forming the reflecting layer, sputtering<br>
method, ion-plating method, chemical vapor deposition and<br>
vacuum deposition can be cited. In addition, publicly known<br>
organic or inorganic intermediate layer and adhesion layer can<br>
be provided on a substrate or under a reflecting layer in order<br>
to enhance reflectivity, improve recording characteristics and<br>
enhance adherence.<br>
The materials used for a protection layer formed on a<br><br>
reflecting layer are not particularly limited, as long as the<br>
reflecting layer is protected from external forces. For<br>
example, thermoplastic resin, thermosetting resin, electron<br>
beam curing resin, UV curing resin and the like can be cited<br>
as organic substance. Moreover, SiO2, SiN4, MgF2, SnO2 and the<br>
like can be cited as inorganic substance. Thermoplastic resin,<br>
thermosetting resin or the like may be dissolved into an<br>
appropriate solvent to obtain an application solution. The<br>
application solution may then be applied to a substrate,<br>
followed by drying. In this way, thermoplastic resin,<br>
thermosetting resin or the like are formed. UV curing resin<br>
may be applied to a substrate as it is and cured by UV light.<br>
Alternatively, UV curing resin may be dissolved into an<br>
appropriate solvent to prepare an application solution. The<br>
application solution may then be applied to the substrate,<br>
followed by irradiation with UV light for curing. In this way,<br>
UV curing resin is formed. For UV curing resin, acrylate resin<br>
such as urethane acrylate, epoxy acrylate and polyester<br>
acrylate can be used. Separate use or mixed use of these<br>
materials may be possible. Additionally, these materials may<br>
be used in a form of a single layer film as well as in a form<br>
of a multi-layered film.<br>
As in the case of forming a recording layer, as methods<br>
for forming the protection layer, coating methods such as spin<br>
coating method and casting method, sputtering method, chemical<br>
vapor deposition and the like may be used. Among these methods,<br>
spin coating method is preferable. The film thickness of the<br>
protection layer generally ranges from 0.1 to 100 µm inclusive.<br>
In the present embodiment, the film thickness of the protection<br>
film preferably equals to 3 µm or more, more preferably equals<br>
to 5 µm or more, whereas preferably 30 µm or less, more preferably<br>
20 µm or less.<br>
Note that, the present embodiment is not limited to the<br>
foregoing aspects, and various modifications thereof are<br>
possible. For example, an optical recording medium may include<br>
two or more recording layers. In addition, methods including<br><br>
the following may be used: a method of bonding a substrate having<br>
no grooves, which is called a dummy substrate, to the reflecting<br>
layer surface; and a method of bonding two optical recording<br>
media together in a state where the reflecting layer surfaces<br>
are allowed to come in contact with each other. UV curing resin,<br>
inorganic thin film or the like may be formed onto the substrate<br>
mirror-finished surface in order to protect the surface and to<br>
prevent adherence of dusts and the like. Furthermore, a<br>
print-receiving layer can also be formed on the protection layer<br>
provided on the reflecting layer, or on the substrate bonded<br>
to the reflecting layer surface.<br>
Recording to the thus obtained optical recording medium<br>
is generally performed by applying laser light to the recording<br>
layer(s) provided on one surface or on both surfaces of the<br>
substrate. Generally, the portions of the recording layer to<br>
which laser light is applied thermally deform, that is,<br>
decomposition, heat generation, melting and the like are caused<br>
by absorption of laser light energy. The recorded information<br>
is generally read by reading the reflectivity difference<br>
between the portion where thermal deformation owing to laser<br>
light has occurred and the portion where thermal deformation<br>
has not occurred.<br>
Lasers used for recording and reading are not<br>
particularly limited. However, a dye laser that can be tuned<br>
to various wavelengths over the visible range, a helium-neon<br>
laser with a wavelength of 633 nm, a high-power semiconductor<br>
laser with a wavelength of near 680, 660 or 635 nm, which has<br>
been developed recently, a blue laser with a wavelength of near<br>
400 nm and a second harmonic YAG laser with a wavelength of 532<br>
nm, and the like can be used. Among these lasers, the<br>
semiconductor laser is suitable because it is compact and<br>
lightweight, excellent in handleability and advantageous<br>
costwise. In an optical recording medium to which the present<br>
embodiment is applied, high density recording and reading can<br>
be achieved by using one or a plurality of wavelengths selected<br>
among these.<br><br>
Examples<br>
Hereinafter, a specific description will be given of the<br>
present embodiment on the basis of examples. However, the<br>
present examples are not intended to limit the present<br>
embodiment as long as it does not depart from the scope thereof.<br>
(Example 1)<br>
(a) Example of preparing compounds<br>
(Diazo coupling)<br>
Here, 1.15 g of 2-amino-l,3, 4- thiadiazole (structural<br>
formula la) was dissolved into a mixture containing 13.7 g of<br>
acetic acid, 11.8 g of phosphoric acid and 4.7 g of sulfuric<br>
acid. After cooling the resultant solution to 5°C or less, 3.4<br>
g of 43% nitrosylsulfuric acid was added dropwise to this<br>
solution. In this way, a diazo solution of 2-amino-l,3,4-<br>
thiadiazole was prepared. Next, the thus obtained diazo<br>
solution was added dropwise to 44 ml of methanol solution<br>
containing 2.2 g of the compound represented by the following<br>
structural formula lb at 5°C or less . Thereafter, the resultant<br>
solution was stirred for 2 hours. Subsequently, 28% ammonia<br>
water was added thereto for neutralization, followed by<br>
filtration and purification of the deposited crystal. In this<br>
way, 1.3 g of an azo-compound represented by the following<br>
structural formula lc was obtained.<br><br>
Here, 1.3 g of the azo-compound represented by the<br>
structural formula lc was dissolved into 52 ml of<br>
tetrahydrofuran. Then, undissolved components were separated<br>
by filtration. Next, 0.47 g of nickel acetate tetrahydrate was<br>
dissolved into 7 ml of methanol. The resultant solution was<br>
added dropwise to THF solution containing the azo-compound<br><br>
represented by the structural formula lc at room temperature.<br>
Furthermore, 72 ml of water was added to this solution, followed<br>
by filtration, purification and drying of the deposited crystal.<br>
In this way, 0.8 g of an azo-nickel chelate dye was obtained.<br>
This azo-nickel chelate dye showed the maximum absorption<br>
wavelength at 588 nm (in chloroform) and 141 L/gcm absorption<br>
coefficient per gram. The coating film thereof showed the<br>
maximum absorption wavelength at 607 nm.<br>
(b) Recording example<br>
An octafluoropentanol (hereinafter referred to as OFP)<br>
solution containing 1.7 wt% of the thus prepared azo-nickel<br>
chelate dye was applied by spin coating on a transparent<br>
polycarbonate substrate with guide grooves having 0.74 µm track<br>
pitch, 160 nm groove depth and 0.31 urn groove width. Then the<br>
substrate was annealed at 100°C for 20 minutes. This recording<br>
layer has the portion-between-grooves film thickness of 55 nm<br>
and the groove-portion film thickness of 85 nm. Silver is<br>
sputtered on this recording layer to have a thickness of 120<br>
nm, and UV curing resin is applied by spin-coating thereon to<br>
have a thickness of 3 µm. Furthermore, after an adhesive was<br>
applied by spin coating, a dummy substrate having no grooves<br>
(a transparent substrate) was bonded to the substrate. Using<br>
a 660 nm semiconductor laser tester (NA = 0.65), 8X-speed (28<br>
m/s linear velocity) recording was performed on this disc in<br>
accordance with recording pulse condition that is compliant<br>
with DVD-R standards ver2.01. Thereafter, the disc was read<br>
at lX-speed (3.5 m/s linear velocity) . An excellent result was<br>
obtained. Specifically, 8X-speed recording sensitivity was<br>
26.8 mW, and jitter (hereinafter, meaning jitter with respect<br>
to clock IT = 38.2 ns) was 8.2%. A lX-speed recording was<br>
performed on this disc, an excellent result was obtained.<br>
Specifically, recording sensitivity was 6.2 mW, recording<br>
modulation amplitude was 55%, and jitter was 7.8%. The disc<br>
exhibited an excellent reflectivity of 47%, which was measured<br>
by a DVD-ROM test system (LMA220 manufactured by ShibaSoku Co. ,<br>
Ltd. The measuring was performed at a wavelength of 647 nm).<br><br>
Incidentally, the upper limit of the power of a recording<br>
laser with a wavelength of near 660 nm has been rapidly raised<br>
these days. However, in consideration of mass productivity,<br>
beam shape (when beam is allowed to have preferable shape, power<br>
is reduced) and price, it is preferable that 8X-speed recording<br>
sensitivity be around 28 mW. In addition, jitter is less than<br>
9%, preferably less than 8%.<br>

(Comparative example 1)<br>

reading of this disc was performed as in the case of the example<br>

(Comparative example 2)<br>
(a) Example of preparing compounds<br>

wavelength at 585 nm (in chloroform) and 125 L/gcm absorption<br><br><br>
coefficient per gram. The coating film thereof showed the<br>
maximum absorption wavelength at 604 nm.<br>
(b) Recording example<br>
A disc was fabricated under the same conditions as those<br>
in the comparative example 1 with the exception that a dye having<br>
the structural formula shown above was used. Then, recording<br>
and reading of this disc were performed as in the case of the<br>
example 2 . As for the result, sufficient recording sensitivity-<br>
was not obtained even at 4X-speed recording. The recording<br>
sensitivity was 48 mW and insufficient, and jitter was 13% which<br>
was poor. Note that the reflectivity of this disc was 48%, which<br>
was measured using a DVD-ROM test system.<br>
(Example 9)<br>
The azo-nickel chelate dye prepared in the example 4 was<br>
mixed with the nickel chelate dye prepared in the Comparative<br>
example 2 at a weight ratio of 60:40. Then, an OFP solution<br>
containing 1.9 wt% of the mixed dye was prepared. Next, this<br>
solution was applied by spin coating on a polycarbonate<br>
substrate with guide grooves having 0.74 µm track pitch, 163<br>
nm groove depth and 0.32 µm groove width. Thereby, a recording<br>
layer having 60 nm portion-between grooves thickness and 90 nm<br>
groove portion thickness was formed. Except for this, a disc<br>
was fabricated as in the case of the example 2. Then, 8X-speed<br>
recording and lX-speed reading were performed. Here,<br>
excellent results were obtained. Specifically, 8X-speed<br>
recording sensitivity was 25.4 mW, jitter was 7.3%, and<br>
reflectivity was 49%. Meanwhile, even at lX-speed recording,<br>
excellent recording characteristics were obtained. lX-speed<br>
recording sensitivity was 6 . 0 mW, j itter was 7 .1%, and recording<br><br>
modulation amplitude was 61%. In other words, recording<br>
characteristics were obtained which satisfy DVD-R standards<br>
even at lX-speed recording or 8X-speed recording.<br>
(Example 10)<br>
A disc was fabricated under the same conditions and using<br>
the same methods as those in the example 9 with the exception<br>
that the dye prepared in the example 2 and the dye prepared in<br>
the comparative example 1 were used. Recording and reading were<br>
then performed as in the case of the example 9. As a result,<br>
excellent recording and reading characteristics were obtained.<br>
Specifically, 8X-speed recording sensitivity was 26 mW, jitter<br>
was 7.2%, and reflectivity was 49%. lX-speed recording<br>
sensitivity was 6.2 mW, jitter was 7.1%, and recording<br>
modulation amplitude was 60%.<br>
(Example 11)<br>
A disc was fabricated under the same conditions and using<br>
the same methods as those in the example 9 with the exception<br>
that a mixed dye, which was obtained by mixing the dye prepared<br>
in the example 5 with the dye prepared in the comparative example<br>
1, was used (weight ratio of 60:40) . Recording and reading were<br>
then performed as in the case of the example 9. As a result,<br>
excellent recording and reading characteristics were obtained.<br>
Specifically, 8X-speed recording sensitivity was 26.2 mW,<br>
jitter was 7.3%, and reflectivity was 50%. lX-speed recording<br>
sensitivity was 6.2 mW, jitter was 7.1%, and recording<br>
modulation amplitude was 61%.<br>
(Example 12)<br>
A disc was fabricated under the same conditions and using<br>
the same -methods as those in the example 9 with the exception<br>
that a mixed dye, which was obtained by mixing the dye prepared<br>
in the example 1 with the dye prepared in the comparative example<br>
1 with a weight ratio of 50:50, was used. Recording and reading<br>
were then performed as in the case of the example 9. At 28 mW,<br>
8X-speed recording sensitivity was slightly unsatisfactory.<br>
However, jitter was 7.5% and reflectivity was 52%.<br>
Additionally, excellent lX-speed recording sensitivity was<br><br>
obtained. Specifically, the recording sensitivity was 6.4 mW,<br>
and jitter was 7.1% and recording modulation amplitude was 61%.<br>
(Comparative example 3)<br>
(a) Example of preparing compounds<br>
Under the same conditions as those in the example 1, a<br>
nickel chelate dye including the azo-compound 105c was obtained.<br>
This azo-nickel chelate dye showed the maximum absorption<br>
wavelength at 589 nm (in chloroform) and 109 L/gcm absorption<br>
coefficient per gram. The coating film thereof showed the<br>
maximum absorption wavelength at 607 nm.<br><br>
(b) Recording example<br>
A disc was fabricated under the same conditions as those<br>
in the example 2 with the exception that a dye having the<br>
structural formula shown above was used. Then, recording and<br>
reading were performed as in the case of the example 2. At 28<br>
mW, the recording sensitivity was slightly unsatisfactory,<br>
showing poor j itter of 9.3%. When recording was performed under<br>
the same conditions as those in the example 9 where recording<br>
sensitivity can be enhanced, 8X-speed recording sensitivity was<br>
25 mW. However, large thermal interference effect led to poor<br>
recording characteristics, i.e., 11% jitter. Note that the<br>
reflectivity of this disc was 46%, which was measured using a<br>
DVD-ROM test system.<br>
(Comparative example 4)<br>
(a) Example of preparing compounds<br>
Under the same conditions as those in the example 1, a<br>
nickel chelate dye including the azo-compound 106c was obtained.<br>
This azo-nickel chelate dye showed the maximum absorption<br>
wavelength at 585 nm (in chloroform) and 132 L/gcm absorption<br><br>
coefficient per gram. The coating film thereof showed the<br>
maximum absorption wavelength at 609 nm.<br><br>
(b) Recording example<br>
A disc was fabricated under the same conditions as those<br>
in the example 2 with the exception that a dye having the<br>
structural formula shown above was used. Then, recording and<br>
reading were performed as in the case of the example 2.<br>
Excellent 8X-speed recording sensitivity was obtained, i.e.,<br>
22 mW. However, owing to large thermal interference effect,<br>
excellent recording characteristics were obtained only at the<br>
power smaller than the recording sensitivity by 1 mW. The<br>
reflectivity was reduced to 39%, which is not preferable for<br>
the reading operation of DVD-Rs.<br>
(Comparative example 5)<br>
(a) Example of preparing compounds<br>
Under the same conditions as those in the example 1, a<br>
nickel chelate dye including the azo-compound 107c was obtained.<br>
This azo-nickel chelate dye showed the maximum absorption<br>
wavelength at 589 nm (in chloroform) and 91 L/gcm absorption<br>
coefficient per gram. The coating film thereof showed the<br>
maximum absorption wavelength at 601 nm.<br><br><br>
in the example 2 with the exception that a dye having the<br>
structural formula shown above was used. Then, recording and<br>
reading were performed under the same recording conditions as<br>
those of the comparative example 1. However, sufficient<br>
recording sensitivity was not provided even at 28 mW and 4X<br>
-speed recording, resulting in poor recording performance.<br>
Note that the reflectivity of this disc was 46%, which was<br>
measured using a DVD-ROM test system.<br>
(Comparative example 6)<br>
(a) Example of preparing compounds<br>
Here, 13.99 g of 1, 2, 3,4-tetrahydroquinoline and 14.52<br>
g of potassium carbonate were dissolved into 350 ml of methanol.<br>
The resultant solution was maintained at temperatures between<br>
45°C and 50°C with constant mixing. To this solution, 25.54<br>
g of dimethyl sulfate was added dropwise. Subsequently, the<br>
solution was stirred for 3 hours at temperatures between 45°C<br>
and 50°C. Thereafter, the solution was left overnight. For<br>
toluene extraction, 350 ml of toluene and 350 ml of water were<br>
added to this solution. The extracted toluene solution was<br>
dried using anhydrous sodium sulfate, followed by removal of<br>
toluene to obtain a brown solution. This solution was<br>
column-purified to obtain 12.9 g of a pale yellow solution<br>
represented by the following structural formula (e).<br><br>
Here, 12.9 g of the compound represented by the above<br>
structural formula (e) was added dropwise to 230 g of<br>
concentrated sulfuric acid which had been cooled to between 0°C<br>
and 5°C, while maintaining the temperature at 0°C to 5°C.<br>
Subsequently, a mixture of 36 g of concentrated sulfuric acid<br>
and 9.0 g of concentrated nitric acid was added dropwise to the<br>
resultant solution while maintaining the temperature at 0°C to<br><br>
5°C. After the mixture solution was added, the solution was<br>
returned to room temperature, followed by stirring for 2 hours.<br>
The reacted solution was poured into 300 ml of ice water for<br>
cooling. Then, the solution was adjusted to pH 9 by the addition<br>
of 50% aqueous sodium hydroxide while cooling the solution.<br>
After stirring for 1 hour, the deposited crystal was separated<br>
by filtration and dried. Thus, 12.4 g of red crystal<br>
represented by the following structural formula (f) was<br>
obtained,<br>
(formula 49)<br><br>
Here, 31.4 g of iron powder was suspended in 183 ml of<br>
DMF-water (2:1) solution, and the solution was heated to between<br>
85°C and 90°C with constant mixing. To this solution, a mixture<br>
obtained by mixing 6.7 ml of hydrochloric acid with 91.5 ml of<br>
DMF-water (2:1) solution was added dropwise. Subsequently,<br>
while maintaining the temperature at 85°C to 95°C, 183 ml of<br>
DMF solution containing 12.0 g of the compound represented by<br>
the above structural formula (f) was added dropwise to this<br>
solution by taking 15 minutes. The resultant solution was<br>
stirred for 20 minutes at the temperature between 80°C to 90°C.<br>
Thereafter, while the solution was left for cooling, 6.39 g of<br>
sodium hydrogencarbonate was added thereto, followed by<br>
stirring for 10 minutes. The solution was then filtrated to<br>
remove iron powder, and the filtrate was poured into 500 ml of<br>
ice water for toluene extraction. After the resultant solution<br>
was dried using anhydrous sodium sulfate, toluene was removed<br>
to obtain 5.47 g of a brown liquid represented by the following<br>
structural formula (g).<br>
(formula 50)<br><br><br>
Under nitrogen flow, 9.31 g of trifluoromethanesulfonic<br>
anhydride was stirred, and was maintained a temperature of 20°C<br>
or below. Here, 40 ml of toluene solution containing 5.47 g<br>
of the compound represented by the above structural formula (g)<br>
was added dropwise. The resultant solution was subsequently<br>
stirred for 4 hours at the temperature between 10°C and 15°C.<br>
Thereafter, the solution was left overnight. To the reacted<br>
solution, 2 ml of water is added at the temperature between 10°C<br>
to 25°C and was stirred for 1 hour. Thereafter, the deposited<br>
solid substance was the separated by filtration. The substance<br>
thus harvested was then dissolved into ethyl acetate, and 150<br>
ml of water was added thereto. Then, the resultant solution<br>
was extracted with ethyl acetate. After the resultant solution<br>
was dried using anhydrous sodium sulfate, ethyl acetate was<br>
removed to obtain 6.87 g of a dark brown liquid represented by<br>
the following structural formula (h).<br>
(formula 51)<br><br>
Here, 0.58 g of 2-amino-5-methyl-l,3,4-thiadiazole<br>
represented by the above-described structural formula (i) was<br>
dissolved into a mixture of 5ml of acetic and 3 ml of propionic<br>
acid. To this solution, 1 ml of sulfuric acid was added dropwise<br>
at the temperature between 0°C and 5°C. Then, 1.78 g of 43%<br>
nitrosylsulfuric acid was added dropwise to the resultant<br><br>
solution at the temperature between 0°C and 5°C. In this way,<br>
diazotization was performed. Then, 1.77 g of the compound<br>
represented by the structural formula (h), 0.2 g of urea and<br>
2.0 g of sodium acetate were dissolved into 20 ml of methanol.<br>
To this solution, the resultant diazo solution was added<br>
dropwise at the temperature between 0°C and 5°C and was stirred<br>
for 3 hours. Thereafter, the resultant solution was left<br>
overnight. The deposited crystal was separated by filtration<br>
and then dried. Thus, 1.44 g of red crystal was obtained which<br>
is represented by the following structural formula (j).<br>
(formula 52)<br><br>
Here, 1.30 g of an azo-compound represented by the<br>
structural formula (j) , which was obtained as described above,<br>
was dissolved into 50 ml of THF. At room temperature, 6 ml of<br>
methanol solution containing 0.46 g of nickel acetate<br>
tetrahydrate was then added to the resultant solution.<br>
Thereafter, this solution was stirred for 3 hours at room<br>
temperature, followed by addition of 50 ml of water. The<br>
deposited crystal was then separated by filtration, and the<br>
obtained crystal was washed with water and dried. In this way,<br>
0. 59 g of a nickel chelate compound was obtained. This compound<br>
showed Xmax at 591 nm (s=9.9 x 104) (in chloroform), 113L/gcm<br>
absorption coefficient per gram, and the coating film thereof<br>
showed the maximum absorption wavelength at 613 nm.<br>
(Measurement of the OD2/OD1 value)<br>
Here, 20 mg of dyes prepared in the examples 1 to 8 and<br>
comparative examples 1 to 6 were respectively added into 2 g<br>
of octafluoropentanol (OFP) solvents. Thereafter, supersonic<br>
dispersion was performed at temperatures between 50°C and 55°C<br>
for 60 minutes to obtain solutions A. The solutions A were then<br><br>
cooled to room temperature (25±5°C). Thereafter, the<br>
solutions A were filtrated through 0.2 µm filters (manufactured<br>
by Millipore Corporation) to obtain solutions B. The solutions<br>
B were respectively applied by spin coating on 1.2 mm thickness<br>
polycarbonate substrates having 170 nm groove depth, 500 nm<br>
groove width and 1600 nm trackpitch at a rotating speed of 800<br>
rpm. Then, the thus obtained films composed of only dyes were<br>
annealed in the constant temperature oven for 5 minutes, where<br>
80°C air is blowing. Thereafter, the substrates were left in<br>
a room, whereby the substrates were cooled to room temperature<br>
(fabrication of coated substrates A) .<br>
The absorption spectra of these coated substrates A were<br>
then measured, wherein the coated substrates A were cut out to<br>
have sector shapes and were used as samples to be measured. Air<br>
was used as a reference sample. Measurement was then made using<br>
U-3300(manufactured by Hitachi, Ltd.). The following<br>
measurement conditions were adopted: wavelength scan speed of<br>
300 nm/min; and optical density measuring (Absorbance) mode at<br>
a sampling cycle of 0.5 nm.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the absorption spectrum of the coated<br>
substrate A where the dye prepared in the example 1 is used.<br>
In addition, Table 1 shows wavelengths and optical densities<br>
at OD1 and OD2 as well as the OD2/OD1 value for each coated<br>
substrate A.<br><br><br>
In addition, Fig. 3 shows the 0D2/0D1 values measured in<br>
the examples 1 to 8 and in the comparative examples 1 to 6. As<br>
can be seen from the results shown in Fig. 3, there is a boundary<br>
between the values in the examples 1 to 8 and the values in the<br>
comparative examples 1 to 6 at 1.25. Moreover, Fig. 4 shows<br>
the maximum absorption wavelengths (wavelengths at which the<br>
0D2 values are obtained) of the coated substrates A fabricated<br>
in the examples 1 to 8 and in the comparative examples 1 to 5,<br>
and shows the measurement results for the reflectivity of each<br>
of the discs at a 40 mm radius, measured by using a DVD-ROM test<br>
system (647 nm). From the results shown in Fig. 4, it can be<br><br>
learned that the discs prepared in the comparative examples 1<br>
to 5 tend to exhibit decreased reflectivity with increase in<br>
the maximum absorption wavelengths as indicated by the<br>
regression line in Fig. 4. As a trend in the dyes prepared in<br>
the comparative examples 1 to 5, it is difficult to obtain a<br>
reflectivity of 45% or more that is required in the DVD standards<br>
for reading by using dyes having the absorption maximum at<br>
wavelengths longer than 605 ran. On the other hand, it can be<br>
determined that the discs using the dyes prepared in the<br>
examples 1 to 8 allow to secure high reflectivity even when dyes<br>
having the absorption maximum at the vicinity of 610 nm are used.<br>
(Measurement of reference data)<br>
Here, 0.06 g of the azo-metal chelate dyes, respectively<br>
represented by the following structural formulae (S-l) to (S-6)<br>
were added to 5 g of OFP solvents, and were subject to supersonic<br>
dispersion at 50°C for 60 minutes. Thereafter, the solutions<br>
were left in a room, whereby the solutions were cooled to room<br>
temperature. The solutions were then filtrated through 0.2 urn<br>
filters (manufactured by Millipore Corporation). The<br>
resultant solutions were applied by spin coating on<br>
mirror-finished surface replicas (polycarbonate substrates<br>
with no guide grooves) so that substantially half area of each<br>
disc surface was covered. After drying, a reflecting layer was<br>
sputtered on a part of a recording layer formed by the<br>
spin-coating. The step height between the uncoated portion<br>
covered with the reflecting layer and the recording layer<br>
covered with the reflecting layer was measured by using a<br>
three-dimensional surface roughness meter (ZYGO: Maxim 5800,<br>
manufactured by Canon Inc.), whereby the film thickness was<br>
determined. In addition, using the automatic<br>
wavelength-scanning ellipsometer (MEL-30S, manufactured by<br>
JASCO Corporation) , light with wavelengths between 580 and 650<br>
nm was applied to the recording layer to which the reflecting<br>
layer was not applied, thereby measuring the reflectivity and<br>
the phase difference in variable-angle measurement mode. Then,<br>
with reference to the above-described film thickness, the<br><br>
combination of refraction index n and extinction coefficient<br>
k, which gives favorable convergence, was determined for each<br>
wavelength. Among the refraction indices for the wavelengths<br>
thus obtained, the refraction index that gives the maximum value<br>
is defined as n.<br>
Meanwhile, for each of the (S-l) to (S-6) dyes, a coated<br>
substrate A formed by use of the dye was fabricated and the<br>
absorption spectrum was measured as in the case of the<br>
above-described "method of measuring the 0D2/0D1 value" Then<br>
the 0D2/0D1 values were calculated.<br>
Table 2 and Fig. 2 show the thus determined 0D2/0D1 values<br>
and n values (maximum refraction indices). Starting from the<br>
left side (i.e. , from the smallest 0D2/0D1 value to the largest<br>
one), data points respectively represent the values for the<br>
(S-l) to (S-6) dyes.<br>
