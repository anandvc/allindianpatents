				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a'sideview mirror for vehicles and an anole adjusting device thereof, and more particularly, a sideview mirror for vehicles and an angle adjusting device thereof by which a driver can accurately and easily see the view at the rear of a vehicle at unit magnification with respect to the movement direction of the vehicle', and the angle of the sideview mirror can be automatically or manually adjusted according to the physical conditions of the driver.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Generally, a vehicle has a pair of sideview mirrors externally protruded at the driver's side and passenger's side of each front side window frame of the vehicle, so that a driver can view the rear of the left and right side roads with respect to the movement direction of the vehicle.<br>
A conventional sideview mirror for vehicles of the planar reflector type having ,-n almost plane reflecting surface is protruded beyond the front body of the vehicle horizontally with respect to a forward-backward axis of the vehicle body, which causes an air resistance.<br>
Such an air resistance increases fuel consumption of the vehicle, and resultantly causes air pollution.<br>
In addition, this planar reflector type sideview mirror has a relatively small rear viewing angle, for example, less than 20.degree., and it may be exoosed to water drops, moisture and frost in bad weather such as rainy or snowy weather,<br>
thereby making it difficult for the driver to view the rear. As a result, there \s a danger of an accident.<br>
Furthermore, while driving at night, the ray emitted from the headlights of the following vehicle is directly reflected at the sideview mirror (at the reflection factor of 50%). making the driver's view unclear. As a result, there is a problem that the conventional type siaeview mirror is lacking in safety.<br>
Considering these problems, a sideview mirror capable of reducing the length thereof protruded beyond the body of the vehicle and increasing the rear view angle using an optical element is disclosed in PCT Application No. W095/31365 and U.S. Patent Application No. US5,559,640, respectively.<br>
Firstly, in the aforesaid PCT Application W095/31365, as disclosed in the " specification and drawings thereof, the driver can see the view at the rear of the vehicle through a sideview mirror constructing of two reflectors and four lenses.<br>
However, in the PCT Application WOS5/31365, since the four lenses are arranged upwardly and downwardly, and the two reflectors are arranged between the lenses, it is difficult to adjust an optical axis passed and reflected through each of the lenses and reflectors due to vibration of the vehicle. In addition, an eye lens (screen lens) through which the driver finally view the rear of the vehicle is installed at ^ lower portion of a sc-called "A pillar". As a result, there is a problem that tne construction and installation of the sideview mirror is complicated.<br>
In addition, in the construction according to the above PCT application, it is difficult to focus on an object at a long distance and at a short distance at the same time, and moreover the sideview mirror is difficult to be designed to see the rear view ;ii the unit mrirjnifir.ntion Thus, tho sidoview mirror of the PCT application has almost<br>
not been put into practical use yet.<br>
Meanwhile, in the sideview mirror according to the U.S Patent Application No. US5,559,640, as disclosed in the specification and drawings thereof, a relatively small convex mirror is arranged outside the vehicle, and a magnifier by which an image reflected from the convex mirror is magnified to be reflected on the convex lens is arranged between the convex mirror and the convex lens which the driver look at, thereby making it possible for the driver to view the rear of the vehicle.<br>
In the sideview mirror for vehicles according to the above U.S. Patent Application, however, the image of a magnifier directed toward the driver's eye is greatly distorted in a vertical direction and in a horizontal direction As a result, there 11; a problem that the function as a sideview mirror for vehicles canno! be substantially implemented.<br>
Accordingly, a "sideview mirror for vehicles" directed to solve these conventional problems is disclosed in Korean Utility Model Publication No. 7653S and U S. Patent Publication No. 5,264,962 by the applicant of the present invention.<br>
Since the aforesaid sideview mirror for vehicles proposed by the applicant includes two lens groups, that is, an object lens system and an eye lens system, and a planar reflector inserted between these systems, it provides a relatively wide field of view toward the rear of the vehicle and a relatively short optical axis for thereby making it easy for the driver to view the rear of the vehicle.<br>
However, in this sideview mirror for vehicles proposed by the applicant, it is not easy for the image incident upon the object lens system to be passed through tne "y \\}', ',y,h.-m to hove an unit magnification In pnrticular, there is a problem that the driver's eye is not easily made consistent with the axis of the eye lens system in<br>
the housing installed adjacent to the driver's side.<br>
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS TO BE SOI VFn<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a sideview mirror for vehicles and an angle adjusting device thereof, and more particularly, to a sideview mirror for vehicles and an angle adjusting device thereof by which a driver can accurately and easily see the view at the rear of a vehicle at unit magnification with respect to the movement direction of the vehicle, and the angle of the sideview mirror can be automatically or manually adjusted according to the physical conditions of the driver.<br>

Hereinafter, the sideview mirror for vehicles and angle adjusting device thereof according to the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Prior to explanation of the sideview mirror for vehicles and angle adjusting device thereof according to the present invention, an afocal system designed to view at unit magnification by an optical system for viewing rearwardly is adapted to the   ' sideview mirror of the present invention.<br>
The afocal system- which is an optical system for viewing the rear cf the  sideveiw mirror according to the present invention is as follows.<br>
To design an afocal system with two groups of lens, the total powe' k of the system, which is expressed as function of individual lens power k,, k2 and tne distance d between two lens groups as the equation, is set to zero, i.e.,<br>
k=k,+k2-M2d=0	(1)<br>
The Lagrange invariant of the afocal system is expressed as follows;<br>
nfi£,=n2h&amp;2	(2)<br>
And the angular magnification, MA is represented as follows;<br>
MA=p2/3i=h1/h2	(3)<br>
Where, n, and n2 represent the index of refraction of each lens, fj, and £2 represent field angle, that is, half the angle formed by an object and an eye from the optical axis, ,'iri'i h, .'i/i'l 1 1, represent the beam height of paraxial parallel rays oefore and after the ray passing through the system, respectively.<br>
To make the afocal system an unit magnification system,<br>
h,/h2 =1,   i.e., |hj = ht(1-kld)i = |hj	(4)<br>
The equation (4) says, k,d=0, or d=2/k,. When k,d=0. the system is same as a pair of glass window, and do noting for the optical path of the ray from the object. When d=2/k,, the distance d must be a positive value to have physical meaning and k.&gt;0.    And, the distance d is twice the focal length of first lens group. In this case, the equation (1) says k,=k:. fn another word, the two lens groups have the same focal length, and the distance between the two groups of lens are sum of each focal length. And, it says the system is kind of Kepler telescope system with uni: magnification,<br>
When the aperture of tne system is palced at the distance b from the second lens group (eye lens system of the present invention), the diamerer ratio between the two lens groups is reoresented as follows-<br>
Hence, if b is larger than the focal length of a first lens group, the aarneter of the second lens group is larger than that of the first lens group<br>
As described above, the sideview mirror for the vehicle or" the present invention is manufactured with its basic concept of the afocal system having unit magnification. Hereinafter, the sideview mirror for the vehicle according to the present invention will now be described.<br>

and at the same time an aperture formed at the other side is directed to the interior of the vehicle 1; an object lens system arranged at an external aperture portion of the housing 3 and adapted to refract a ray from the rearward portion of the vehicle 1 to be converged; an eye lens system arranged in the forward portion of the object lens along the movement direction of an optical axis (Lpc) passing through the object lens system and adapted to form an afocal optical system along with the object lens system by magnifying and refracting the ray passing through the object lens system so that it becomes an image having either unit magnification at which the driver can see as seen with the naked eye or a predetermined magnification; and an air guiding unit installed at the circumferential portion of the housing 3 outside the vehicle 1 and adapted to guide air from the outside to the object lens system and eye lens system<br>
The housing 3 includes an outer tubular unit 5 connected thereto so :nat an aperture formed at one side is directed to the rear of the vehicle 1 and the other side thereof is directed to the interior of the vehicle 1 and an inner tubular unit 7 communicating with the outer tubular unit 5 and pivotably connected to the outer tubular unit 5.<br>
A spherical unit 6 is formed inside the other end of the outer tubular unit 5 connected toward the interior of the vehicle 1, and a spherical unit 8 of the inner tubular unit 7 is pivotabiy connected to the spherical unit 6.<br>
The air guiding unit includes an air inlet 25 extended to face the aperture of the outer tubular unit 5 and adapted to receive air from the outside, an outer auct 23 connected to the outer tubular unit 5 to surround the same at a distance for guiding air therebetween, and an inner duct 24 connected to the inner tubular unit 7 to surround the end portion of the inner tubular unit 7 at a distance for guiding air<br>
thereoetween.<br>
Inside the outer duct 23, an opening and closing device (not shown) for opening and closing the air inlet 25 is prepared, and an air guiding tube 27 forming an air flow channel is connected.<br>
At the terminal of the air guiding tube 27, a first branching pipe 29 and second branching pipe 31 are connected to guide the air received from the air inlet 25 to the object lens system and eye Isns system.<br>
The first branching pipe 29 is arranged in a coil shape at the circumferential portion of the outer tubular unit 5, of which the end portion is fixed on the surface of tr&gt;2 object lens 11 arranged at the outermost portion of the outer tubular unit 5 to irrect air<br>

Figure 3 is a perspective view illustrating the arrangement state of optical elements according to the embodiment of the present invention. Figure 4 is a explanatory view illustrating an optical path of the optical elements according to the embodiment of the present invention. Figure 5 is a view illustrating the state of using a sideview mirror for vehicles according to the present invention.<br>
As shown rn these drawings, the object lens system has an optical transmission member 9 arranged inside the outer tubular unit 5 and adapted to refract and reflect an image at the rear of the vehicle 1 to be converged on the interior of the vehicle 1<br>
The optical transmission member 9 is configured as a so-called Amici type prism wherein an object lens of a convex lens type for refracting a passed ray to be converged; an upper reflecting unit 13 arranged at a predetermined angle (45 degree in this embodiment) within the focal length of the object lens 11 and adapted to reflect the ray passing through an upper side of the horizontal center line of ;he object lens 11. and a lower reflecting unit 15 arranged within the focal length of the object lens 11 so that the upper reflecting unit 13 is at a right angle with the internal angle and s reciprocal contact line corresponds to the horizontal center line of the object lens 11 and adapted to reflect the ray passing through a lower portion of the horizontal center line of the object lens 11 are integrally formed.<br>
The eye lens system includes an eye lens of a convex lens type arranged in an innr.T nporture portion of the inner tubular unit 7 and adapted to magnify and refract the image incident through the optical transmission member 9 to form an image having<br>
either unit magnification or a predetermined magnification and a third reflecting unit 17 of a planar reflector type or a prism arranged between the optical transmission member 9 and the object lens 19 and adapted to reflect the image received from the optical transmission member 9.<br>
Herein, the third reflecting unit 17 can be configured as a planar reflector arranged beyond the focal length of the object lens 11 so that the optical path (LPL, LPR) reflected by the upper reflecting unit 13 and the lower reflecting unit 15 cross each other, and can be configured as a prism<br>
In addition, the eye lens 19 is configured as a single convex lens. However, according to the distance between the sideview mirror and the driver, that is, in the case wnere the sideview mirror is relatively far from the driver, for example, the sia'eview mirror at the passenger's side, a plano-convex lens can be installed ;n a forward aperture portion of the inner tuoular unit 7 and a concave-convex lens can be installed between the plano-convex lens and the third reflecting unit 17.<br>
In the above optical transmission member 9, the object lens 1 1, upper reflecting<br>
unit 13, and lower reflecting unit 15 are integrally formed. However, the object lens 11,<br>
upper reflecting unit 13, and lower reflecting unit 15 can be configured independently,<br>
or the upper reflecting unit 13 and the lower reflecting unit 15 are integrally formed while<br>
the object lens formed independently is arranged at one side thereof.	<br>
In addition, although the third reflecting unit 17 and the eye lens 19 are formed independently, it is also possible to form the third reflecting unit 17 and the eye lens 19 integrally with each other.<br>
The operation of the sideview mirror according to the present invention thusly LOfiUfu'jod will now be described.<br>
Firstly, when the image of an object at the rear of the vehicle connected with the smr; 3 passes through the object lens 11 in the form of an almost parallel ray, the upper reflecting unit 13 reflects the ray incident through an upper portion cf the horizontal center line of the object lens 11 on the lower reflecting unit 15 at a rejection angle corresponding to the incident angle, and the lower reflecting unit 15 reflects the same to the third reflecting unit 17.<br>
At the same time, the lower reflecting unit 15 reflects the ray incident through a lower portion of the horizontal center line of the object lens 11 on the upper reflecting unit 13 at a predetermined reflection angle, and the upper reflecting unit 13 reflects the same to the third reflecting unit 17 at a reflection angle corresponding to the incident angle.<br>
Accordingly, the rays reflected by the upper reflecting unit 13 and the lower reflecting unit 15, respectively, are crossed with each other at the focal point of the object lens, and thus an image formation is achieved on the third reflecting unit in a state tha: the lateral and longitudinal portions of the image are corrected.<br>
The ray reflected by the third reflecting unit 17 passes through the eye lens 19 constructing the afocal optical system along with the optical transmission member 9, is magnified to form an image having either unit magnification or a predetermined magnification, and is transmitted to the driver in the form of an almost parallel ray, thereby making the driver see the view at the rear without distortion accurately and easily.<br>
Meanwhile, in the case where water drops or frost are formed on the surface of th" ')!)|f-r t loir, 11 or eyo lens 19 while the vehicle moves, when the air inlet 25 is opened by the opening and closing device (not snown) of the air inlet 25, air enters<br>
the air guiding tube 27.<br>
The air entering the air guiding tube 27 is filtered through the filtering member 33, and is injected on the surface of the object lens 11 and eye lens 19 via the first branching pipe 29 and second branching pipe 31, respectively, thereby removma water drops or frost on the surface of the object lens 11 and eye lens 19.<br>
On the contrary, in the case where the vehicle 1 is stopped, air is guided from the outside by applying power to the blowing device 35, for thereby enabling the guided air to be injected on the surface of the object lens 11 and eye lens 19 via the branching pipes 29 and 31, respectively.<br>
Furthermore, in the case where ice is formed on the surface of the object isr.s 11 at a relatively low outdoor temperature in winter, power is applied to the heater coii 37 to thus heat air, and the heated air is injected on the surface of the object lens 11, thereby easily removing ice formed on the surface.<br>

I he operation of the automatic angle adjusting device of a siceview mirror thusiy constructed will now be described.<br>
When an user press a switch (not shown) attached to a adjusting panel at the oriver's side for automatically adjusting the sideview mirror laterally, the motor 60 in the auto driving oox 50 installed within the mounting groove 41 inside the door panel mounted inside a door (not shown) is driven, and accordingly the motor axis 61 is rotated in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction.<br>
Al the same time at the end portion of the motor axis 61, the driving gear 70 configured as a oevel gear is rotated by the rotating power of the motor axis 61, and<br>
the first reduction gear 71 configured as a bevel gear vertically crossing the driving gear 70 to be engaged with each other is rotated by rotating power. At the same time, the second reduction gear 72 at the lower side of the first reduction gear 71, th:rd reduc:ion gear 73 engaging with the second reduction gear 72, fourth reduction gear 74 installed at the upper side of the third reduction gear 73, fifth reduction gear 75 engaging with the fourth reduction gear 74, and sixth reduction gear 76 installed at the lower side of the fifth reduction gear 75 are sequentially rotated in a state that the ro;a:mg power of the driving gear 70 is reduced.<br>
At this time, of the first and second relay gears 81 and 82 rotatably installed at 'he upper side of the power conversion link 80 and engaged witn the sixth reduction gear 76 to be rotated by rotating power, the horizontal power transmission gear' 10 is encaged with one side of the second relay gear 82 for thereby receiving the rotating power of the second relay gear 82. The vertical power transmission gear 130 installed at the other side of the second relay gear 82 is spaced apart therefrom, so it cannot receives the rotating power of the second relay gear 82.<br>
Therefore, the horizontal power transmission gear 110 and the horizontal adjusting gear 120 receiving the rotating power of the second relay gear 82 are rotated, and at the same are moved laterally along the horizontal rack gear 111 of the door panel 40 engaged with the horizontal adjusting gear 120, thereby making it possible to automatically adjusting the inner tubular unit 7 of the sideview mirror 2 in a horizontal direction.<br>

On the other hand, the horizontal power transmission gear 110 is space apart from the second relay gear 82, it cannot receive the rotritmq power of the second relay gear 82<br>
Therefore, the vertical rotating axis 140 installed at the center of the vertical<br>
power transmission gear 130 is rotated while the vertical power transmission gear 130 is rotated. At the same time, since the vertical adjusting member 160 of which the upper end portion is hingeably connected to the center of a lower end of the connecting member 150 installed in the inner tubular unit 7 of the sideview mirror 2 and in which the guide ring 161 penetrated by the vertical rotating axis 140 to be engaged therewith is fixed to the vertical adjusting member 160 rises or falls along the vertical rotating axis 140, it is possible to automatically adjust the inner tubular unit 7 of the sideview mirror 2 in the vertical direction.<br>

The operation of the thusly constructed manual angle adjusting device of a sideview mirror will now be described.<br>
When the user intends to manually adjust the sideview mirror in order to move the same laterally, the spring 232 installed between the horizontal flow preventing unit 230 and the spring receiver 231 is compressed by slightly pushing the horizontal adjusting handle 250 in a forward direction.<br>
At the same time, the connection between the  spiral groove 223 on the circumferential surface of the horizontal flow preventing unit 230 and the friction gear 23•£ in a forward portion of the horizontal adjusting handle 160 is released. Thus, when the horizontal adjusting handle 260 is rotated in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction, the horizontal adjusting gear 250 integrally formed in a forwarc portion cf the horizontal adjusting handle 260 to be engaged with the horizontal rack gear 240 formed on the door panel 40 is rotated in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction, thereby making it possible to adjust the sideview mirror 2 laterally.<br>

200 in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction.<br>
At the same time, while the vertical rotating axis 140 installed at the center of the vertical power transmission gear 270 is rotated, the vertical adjusting member 160 of which the upper end portion is hingeably connected to the center of a lower end of the connecting member 150 installed in the inner tubular unit 7 of the sideview mirror 2 and in which the guide ring 161 penetrated by the vertical rotating axis 140 to be engaged therewith is fixed rises or falls along the vertical rotating axis 140.
