Useful diazo components include all mono- to binuclear carbo- or heterocyclic organic radicals or residues of aromatic character which can bear customary disperse dye substituents except in particular water-solubiiizing substituents, i.e. sulphonic acid groups especially. Useful diazo components further include residues of monoazo compounds. Examples of diazo components are: preferably substituted phenyl, thienyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, pyrazolyl, imidazolyl, triazolyl, benzothiazolyl or benzisothiazolyl radicals.<br><br>
All the alky) groups mentioned contain, unless otherwise stated, 1 to 8 and especially 1 to 4 carbon atoms, they can be straight-chain or branched and may be substituted, for example by halogen atoms, preferably bromine or chlorine atoms, hydroxyl, alkoxy, phenyl- phenoxy, cyano, rhodan, acyl, acyloxy or acylamino groups.<br><br>
All alkyl, alkylene and alkenyl radicals are straight chain, unless stated otherwise.<br>
The process for preparing the novel dyes of the formula (I) is characterized in that a diazotized amine of the formula (II)<br><br>
is coupled with a compound of the formula (III)<br><br>
Diazotizing and coupling are carried out according to commonly known methods.<br>
The compounds of the formulae II and III are known or are easy to prepare from known compounds by methods known to one skilled in the art.<br>
The novel dyes of the formula (I) exhibit excellent exhaustion from an aqueous suspension onto textile material composed of manufactured synthetic or natural polymer hydrophobic macromolecular organic substances. They are particularly useful for dyeing or printing textile material composed of linear aromatic polyesters and also of cellulose acetate and cellulose triacetate.<br>
Dyeing or printing is accomplished by processes known per se, for example those described in French patent 1 445 371.<br>
The dyeings obtained have good allround fastnesses; worth emphasizing are the light fastness, the fastness to dry heat setting and coating and also the excellent wet fastnesses, after thermal stabilization (thermomigration fastness).<br><br>
The formulae (I) dyes used according to the invention can be used for dyeing and printing manufactured natural polymer and especially synthetic hydrophobic fibre materials, in particular textile materials. Textile materials composed of blend fabrics comprising sudvmanufactured natural polymer or synthetic hydrophobic fibre materials are likewise dyeable or printable with the dyes of the formula (I).<br>
Useful manufactured natural polymer hydrophobic textile materials include for example acetate filament (cellulose acetate) and cellulose triacetate.<br>
Synthetic hydrophobic textile materials consist for example of linear aromatic polyesters, for example polyesters from terephthalic acid and glycols, particularly ethylene glycol, or condensation products of terephthalic acid and 1,4-bis-(hydroxymethyl)-cyclohexane; of polycarbonates, for example those formed from alpha, alpha-dimethyl-4t4'-dihydroxydiphenylmethane and phosgene, of fibres based on polyvinyl chloride and especially on polyamide.<br>
The textile material mentioned may be present at dyeing or printing in the various processing forms, for example as fibre, yarn or web, as a woven or loop-formingly knitted fabric or in the form of carpets.<br>
The dyes of the formula (I) are applied to the textile materials by known dyeing processes. For example, polyester fibre materials are exhaust dyed from an aqueous dispersion in the presence of customary anionic or nonionic dispersants with or without customary carriers at temperatures between 80 and 140°C. Cellulose acetate is preferably dyed at between about 65 to 85°C and cellulose triacetate at temperatures ofupto115°C.<br>
Polyamide-based fibre materials are preferably dyed at a pH of 3 to 7 and especially 3 to 5. The dyeing is preferably carried out at a temperature of 70 to 110°C and especially 80 to 105°C.<br>
The liquor ratio depends on the apparatus, the substrate and the make-up form. However, the liquor ratio can be chosen within a wide range, for example from 4:1 to 100:1, but preferably 5:1 to 30:1.<br><br>
The formula (I) dyes used according to the invention can be applied in the customary dyeing processes, such as for example in the exhaust process, continuous process or printing process.<br>
The formula (I) dyes used according to the invention are also useful for dyeing from short liquors, for example in continuous dyeing processes or batch and continuous foam dyeing processes.<br>
Preference is given to dyeing, especially dyeing by the exhaust process.<br>
The dyeing liquors or print pastes, in addition to water and the dyes, may contain further additives, for example wetting agents, antifoams, levelling agents or agents to influence the properties of the textile material, for example softeners, flame retardants or soil, water and oil repellants, and also water softeners and natural or synthetic thickeners, for example alginates or cellulose ethers.<br>
The amounts in which the dyes of the formula (I) are used in the dyebaths or print pastes can vary within wide limits, depending on the desired depth of shade. Advantageous amounts will generally be in the range from 0.01% to 15% by weight and especially 0.1% to 10% by weight, based on the weight of fibre and based on the print paste, respectively.<br>
The dyes of the formula (I) can likewise be used for mass coloration of polyester. The disperse dyes according to the invention can also first be processed into concentrates in which a polymer which is compatible with the polymer to be coloured serves as a carrier for the disperse dyes. The carrier material should belong to the same category of polymers or be a generally high-compatible substance. This avoids adverse repercussions for the mechanical, thermal and optical properties. Such preparations contain the disperse dyes according to the invention (or generally pigments and/or dyes) in highly concentrated form in a polymer-carrier adapted to the end product and which are used for mass coloration of polymers are customarily termed masterbatches. Alternatively, pellets or liquid formulations (dispersions) or simply dry blends can also . be prepared for mass coloration of polymers.<br>
The disperse dyes according to the invention are useful for pigrnenting macromolecular organic materials of natural or synthetic origin, for example plastics, resins, coatings,<br><br>
paints, electrophotographic toners and developers, colour filters and also inks, including printing inks.<br>
The disperse^yes according to the invention are also useful as colorants in aqueous and non-aqueous ink jet inks, microemulsion inks and also in such inks which are employed in the hot melt process.<br>
Ink jet inks generally contain in total 0.5% to 15% by weight and preferably 1.5% to 8% by weight (reckoned dry) of one or more of the disperse dyes according to the invention.<br>
Microemulsion inks are based on organic solvents, water and if appropriate an additional hydrotropic substance (interface mediator). Microemulsion inks contain in general 0.5% to 15% by weight and preferably 1.5% to 8% by weight of one or more of the disperse dyes according to the invention, 5% to 99% by weight of water and 0.5% to 94.5% of organic solvent and/or hydrotropic compound.<br>
"Solvent-based" ink jet inks contain preferably 0.5% to 15% by weight of one or more of the disperse dyes according to the invention, 85% to 99.5% by weight of organic solvent and/or hydrotropic compounds.<br>
Hot-melt inks are usually based on waxes, fatty acids, fatty alcohols or sulphonamides which are solid at room temperature and become liquid on heating, the preferred melting range being situated between about 60°C and about 140°C. Hot-melt ink jet inks consist essentially for example of 20% to 90% by weight of wax and 1% to 10% by weight of one or more of the disperse dyes according to the invention. There may further be included 0% to 20% by weight of an additional polymer (as "dye-dissolver"). 0% to 5% by weight of dispersing assistant, 0% to 20% by weight of viscosity modifier, 0% to 20% by weight of plasticizer, 0% to 10% by weight of tack additive, 0% to 10% by weight of transparency stabilizer (prevents crystallization of waxes, for example) and also 0% to 2% by weight of antioxidant.<br>
Parts and percentages in the examples which follow are by weight. The temperatures are indicated in degrees Celsius.<br><br>
