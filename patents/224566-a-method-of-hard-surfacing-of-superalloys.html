				<td>The invention relates to a method of hard surfacing of super alloys using laser for applications in high temperature wear resistance coatings particularly on gas turbine components to combat severe high temperature fretting wear conditions. Conventionally hard surfacing of super alloys are being carried out using Tungsten Inert gas (TIG) welding process.<br>
There are disadvantages associated with the present system of hard surfacing of super alloys using Tungsten Inert gas welding process.<br>
The main disadvantage associated with the present system of hard surfacing of super alloys are that there are distortion in dimension due to high heat input.<br>
Another disadvantages associated with the present system of hard surfacing of super alloys is that there is excessive dilution of base metal with clad layers leading to poor wear resi stance.<br>
Yet another disadvantages associated with the present invention of hard surfacing of super alloys is that the heat affected zone cracking leads to high rejection rate of processed components.<br>
With the availability of Lasers capable of high power density, flexible operation and easy adaptability to working environment, the application range to laser seems to be unlimited. However in reality the laser assisted processing is predominantly used in low level applications such as sheet metal cutting, marking, micro drilling etc}<br>
Therefore the main objective of the present invention is  to<br>
provide a simple and low cost means of hard surfacing of super #llPy» to combat »ev«re high temperature fretting wear conditions as experienced by gas turbine components.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to utilize the precisely controllable high power CO2 laser source in hard surfacing of super alloys.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to develop clad hard surface using cobalt based alloy with very fine grain micro structure and high hardness essential for high wear resistance at operating elevated temperatures.<br>
j<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to develop clad hard surfacing of super alloys with minimum distortion and reduced clad thickness to avoid excessive po*t machining operation still another objective of the present invention is to develop clad hard surfacing of super alloys with negligible dilution of base metal leading to better wear resistance properties.<br>
Further objective of the present invention is to develop hard surfacing of super alloys with negligible heat affected zone cracking of the base metal to avoid rejection of components.<br>
Yet further objective of the present invention is to develop hard surfacing of super alloys with minimum clad thickness to avoid wastage of costly cobalt based alloys.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a method of hard surfacing of super alloys using laser for applications in high temperature wear resistance coatings particularly on gas turbine components comprising the steps of|<br>
a)	the  super alloy  samples are  cleaned,   shot  blasted  to<br>
ensure better absorption of laserbeam;<br>
b)	the   cleaned  super alloy sample  surface  is  exposed  to<br>
laser source  with a variable power source    and<br>
a   powder   feeder      attached  to  the  laser   head   at   a predetermined angle using a special fixture;<br>
c)	a defocused laser beam of sufficient energy density is  used<br>
to  melt  a small layer of the base  metal and the powder  to  be<br>
clad is fed into the laser beam simultaneously;<br>
d)	the powder melts and mixes with the thin liquid layer of  the<br>
base  metal  and  freezes to form,a clad layer with a  very  good<br>
metallurgical bond;<br>
e)	the  sample  is   moved under the  laser  beam  to  form  a<br>
continuous  clad  layer  of  sufficient  thickness  without   any<br>
porosity and defects;<br>
f)	the clad thickness and width is increased  by multiple  over<br>
lapping passes.<br>
The nature of the invention, its objective and further advantages residing in the same will be apparent from the following description made with reference to non limiting exemplary embodiments of the invention.<br>

Figure 3 shows graph 2, EDX line scan analysis for the elements Cv, Co and Ni<br>
Figure 4  shows graph 3,  Distance from  interface (O)f mm<br>
The Hard surfacing of super alloys is illustrated by the results of a typical experiment as illustrated below.<br>
According to the present invention the hard surfacing of super allloys assisted by lack is simple and a low cut option which when clad with external powder feed produces surface with uniform high hardness and with uniform very fine micrestructure. In this process of hard surfacing the dilution of base material with that of clad is negligible and there is total absence of he'at affected zone and its consequent cracking. The process thereby results in negligible distortion and reduced rejection rate. The process also produces a hard surface results in near net shape dimension requiring minimal post machining operation.<br>
The process can also be automated with flexible and precise control of parameters which facilitates consistent quality and control over undesirable interactions.<br>
DETAILED  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESS<br>
The super alloy samples are cleaned, shot blasted to ensure better absorption of the laser beam. A standard 5 kW laser source is used whose power can be varied. A special powder delivery system ensures uniform supply of hard surfacing powder into the laser beam at a predetermined angle. The powder feeder is attached to the laser head using a special fixture. The cleaned super alloy sample surface is exposed to laser source. A defocused laser beam of sufficient energy density<br>
is used to  melt a small layer of the base  metal and the  powder<br>
to  be  clad is fed into the  laser  beam  simultaneously.    The<br>
powder melts and  mixes with the thin liquid layer of base  metal<br>
and    freezes  to  form  a  clad  layer   with   a   very   good<br>
metallurgical bod.  The sample is  moved under the  laser beam to<br>
form   a continuous clad  layer of sufficient  thickness  without<br>
any  porosity  and  defects.  The clad  thickness  and  width  is<br>
increased by  multiple over lapping passes.<br>
The  following  tables gives details of parameters used  and  the<br>
properties of the  clad surface thus obtained.<br>
Table  I :  Details of  Base metal, Alloy powder used  for  cladding<br>
and  the Laser parameters.<br>

cross section of single track and multiple  track clad  layers<br>

Figure 3 shows the Graph II: EDAX analysis indicating negligible dilution of base metal in the clad layer<br>
Figure 4 shows the Graph III: Comparison of multiple clad layer hardness values; Present invention Vs TIG welding<br>
Results:<br>
For our trials we used commercially available hard surfacing powder with characteristics as shown in Table I. The optimum laser parameters for successful cladding were obtained at 2 kW laser power as given in Table I belows<br>
Table I: Details of Base  metal.  Alloy powder used for  cladding and  Laser parameters.<br>
Base  metal	Ni base super alloy, Udimet 5QO<br>
Clad alloy1	Cobalt based alloy, stelite 694<br>
Particle size:5O-12O  u m<br>
Optimum  laser parameters     Laser power &amp; Dia.:2kW,5mm<br>
Powder feed rate: 16 gms/min. Traverse  speed of base metal: 10O<br>
mm/min.<br>
The photographs of both single pAss and multiple pass claddings show similar features<br>
(Figure 1). No porosity, no heat affected zone cracking and no other defects were observed. The low dilution of base metal into the clad layer as shown in Graph 1 wherein the nickel concentration in the clad layer is very low indicates the high purity of the clad layer deposited and the precise control of process parameters. Detailed chemical composition of the clad layer at different locations was carried out using EDAX facility and the results are given in table 2 below:<br>
Table 2.Composition of clad  surface at different locations<br><br>
Major element Ch rom i um 	Powder (wt X )            Clad (wt X ) 26 - 3O         26.77 27.19 27.85 26.96 <br>
Tungsten 	IB - 21          18. O   18.14 2O. 14 18.32 <br>
Nickel 	4-6         6.78    6.O8  6.43  6.41 <br>
Cobalt 	Min.38         4O.71   39.41 39. O7 4O.O <br>
From   the  results it can be seen that the  clad  layer  at different  locationS has the same composition to that of the<br>
stellite powder.<br>
Defect free, homogenous cladding of 1.2 mm maximum height and 3.5 mm maximum width could be obtained at 2 kW power level for single track samples, The micro hardness was uniform throughout the entire cross section and in the range of 69O —715 HV (Graph H) as against the base metal hardness of 45O IIV.<br>
In the case of multi clad samples, a maximum defect free clad thickness of 3 mm height and 2O mm width could easily be established. This validates that the hard surfacing can be obtained even for larger thickness even though for many applications thickness of the order of 1—1.5 mm is sufficient. The microhardness results were also satisfactory and a maximum value of 8OO HV could be achieved as against the base metal hardness of 45O HV. It is evident from the graph III that higher hardness could be achieved even with lower thickness as compared to TIG welded claddings. This becomes a direct evidence for the economics of the present invention.<br>
This hard surfacing can easily be automated to get reliable and consistent results on large components. The laser source makes it easy to adapt this process to different working envi ronments.<br>
