Ferrocenediphosphines<br>
The present invention relates to ferrocene-1,1 '-diphosphines which contain a ferrocene-substituted, secondary phosphino group in the 1 position and a secondary phosphino group in the 1' position; a process for preparing them; complexes of transition metals with these ferrocenediphosphines as ligands; and the use of the metal complexes as homogeneous catalysts in stereoselective syntheses of organic compounds.<br>
Chiral ligands have been found to be extraordinarily important auxiliaries for catalysts in homogeneous stereoselective catalysis. Metal complexes by means of which not only a sufficient catalytic activity but also a high stereoselectivity can be achieved are of practical use. Without these two properties, scale-up to industrial processes cannot be achieved for economic reasons.<br>
The activity of such catalysts is frequently found to be specific for particular substrates. To be able to carry out optimizations for particular substrates, it is therefore necessary to have a sufficient number of chiral ligands available. There is therefore a continuing need for further efficient chiral ligands which are simple to prepare and give good results in stereoselective catalytic reactions. Ligands whose properties can be matched to particular catalytic tasks and can be optimized are of particular interest. Ligands which can be built up in a modular fashion are particularly useful here.<br>
Ferrocene is a very useful skeleton for the preparation of ligands and has been used success¬fully for providing different substitutions with secondary phosphino radicals. In addition, diphosphine ligands which have a ferrocene skeleton and contain a stereogenic P atom have become known; see, for example, C. Gambs et al., Helvetica Chimica Acta Volume 84 (2001), pages 3105 to 3126, or WO 2005/068477. However, such diphosphines have not attained any practical importance since the preparation of pure diastereomers is complicated and the diastereomers frequently tend to undergo undesirable epimerization.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that more stable ferrocene-1,1 '-diphosphines having a stereogenic P atom are obtained when a P atom contains a ferrocenyl radical which is substituted in the ortho position relative to the bond between the cyclopentadienyl ring (Cp ring) and the P atom, in particular by substituents which contain at least one stereogenic carbon atom. In addition, it has surprisingly been found that these very modular diphosphines<br><br>
can be prepared in a simple fashion and can be optimized for a given catalytic problem by variation of subsiituents in the phosphino radicals and in the Cp ring. It has also surprisingly been found that complexes with TM8 metals are very effective, homogeneous catalysts for asymmetric syntheses, in particular for hydrogenations of a,(3-unsaturated carboxylic acids, and display very high catalytic activities and stereoselectivities.<br>

The P-bonded P(lll) substituent Phos can also be an aminophosphino radical of the formula -PRi7NR18Ria, where R17, Ri8 and R19 are each, independently of one another, open-chain hydrocarbon radicals as have been mentioned above for secondary phosphino groups as P-bonded P(lll) substituent, including the preferences, or R,7 has this meaning and R18 and R19 together form a bivalent hydrocarbon radical which has from 3 to 7 and preferably from 4 to 6 carbon atoms and is unsubstituted or substituted by Ci-CValkyl, Ci-C-alkoxy, C1-C4-alkylthio, phenyl, benzyl, phenoxy or (Ci-C4-alkyl}3Sk<br>

or R19 and R^ together form a bivalent hydrocarbon radical which has from 3 to 7 and pre¬<br>
ferably from 4 to 6 carbon atoms and is unsubstituted or substituted by Ci-C4-alkyl, C,-C4-<br>
F	alkoxy, Ci-C4-alkylthio, phenyl, benzyl, phenoxy or (Ci-C^alkyl^Si-. R-,B and R2] have the<br>
meanings given above when R19 and R20 together form a bivalent hydrocarbon radical.<br>
The compounds of the formula I can be prepared in a simple and modular fashion in high yields even as enantiomerically pure diastereomers. Even intermediates can be obtained as<br>
enantiomehcally pure diastereomers, which makes the preparation of pure diastereomeric end products easier. It is advantageous to start out from 1,1 '-dihaloferrocene, which is commercially available, for example 1,1'-dibromoferrocene, and in which a halogen can be selectively replaced by a metal using metallation reagents such as an alkyllithium.<br><br>
In a first variant, the group R?HalP- is then introduced by reaction with Rr-P(ha\)2. Reaction with ortho-metallated and Y-substituted ferrocenes leads to a central intermediate of the formula VIII which can be obtained as pure diastereomer by heating and recrystallization:<br><br>
where Hal is halogen (CI, Br or I, preferably Br), In the compounds of the formula VIII, a desired Phos group can be introduced after renewed metallation (replacement of Hal) by reaction with halophosphines of the formula Phos-Hal.<br>
In another variant, the Phos group is firstly introduced by reaction with Phos-Hal and the R2HalP- group is then introduced by metallation and subsequent reaction with RrP(Hal}2. This gives intermediates of the formula X,<br><br>
which are reacted in a final step with ortho-metallated and Y-substituted ferrocenes to give compounds of the formula I. The mixtures of diastereomers obtained can be converted into one pure diastereomer by heating and recrystallization.<br>
The invention further provides a process for preparing compounds of the formula I, which comprises the steps:<br>
a)      metallation of a 1,1'-dihaloferrocene to give a 1-metallo-1'-haloferroceneand<br>
subsequent reaction with a compound of the formula R;rP(Hal)2, where Hal is chlorine, bromine or iodine, to form a compound of the formula VI,<br><br><br>
In process step b), mixtures of diastereomers of the P-chiral compounds of the formula VIII are obtained. Mixtures of diastereomers of compounds of the formula VIM as obtained in process step b) can be separated into their various stereoisomers by means of known methods, for example chromatography.<br>
However, these mixtures can also be converted into pure diastereomers in a surprisingly simple manner by plain thermal treatment and, if appropriate, subsequent recrystaliization. Thermal treatment and, if appropriate, recrystaliization is advisable before carrying out process step c) so as to avoid purification steps such as separations on chiral columns after process step c) in order to produce pure diastereomers. Thermal treatment can, for example,<br><br>
comprise taking up the reaction product in an inert solvent and heating it at from 40 to 150"C, preferably from 60 to 120°C,fora period of minutes to hours, for example from 10 minutes to 10 hours. Suitable solvents are mentioned below.<br>
The dihaloferrocenes and dihalophosphines used in process step a) are either known, some of them are commercially available or they can be prepared by analogous methods. Compounds of the formula VIII are known or can be prepared by known or analogous methods. Known Y-substituted ferrocenes are used as starting materials and are metaliated in the ortho position. Metallations of ferrocenes using alkyllithiums or magnesium Grignard compounds are known reactions which are described, for example, by T. Hayashi et al., Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 53 (1980), pages 1138 to 1151, or in Jonathan Clayden Organolithiums: Selectivity for Synthesis (Tetrahedron Organic Chemistry Series), Pergamon Press (2002). The alkyl in the alkyllithium can, for example, contain from 1 to 6 carbon atoms and pre¬ferably from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Methyllithium, s-butyllithium, n-butyllithium and t-butyl-iithium are frequently used. Magnesium Grignard compounds are preferably compounds of the formula (Ci-C4-afkyl)MgXo, where Xo is CI, Br or I.<br>
The reactions in process steps a), b) and c) are advantageously carried out at low tempera¬tures, for example from 20 to -100°C, preferably from 0 to -80"C. After addition of reagents, the temperature can also be increased, for example to room temperature. The reactions are advantageously carried out under inert protective gases, for example nitrogen or noble gases such as helium or argon.<br>
The reactions are advantageously carried out in the presence of inert solvents. Such solvents can be used either alone or as a combination of at least two solvents. Examples of solvents are aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons and also open-chain or cyclic ethers. Specific examples are petroleum ether, pentane, hexane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene, diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, tert-butyl methyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether or ethylene glycol diethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, tetrahydro-furan and dioxane.<br>
In the reactions in process steps a), b) and c), use is made of at least equivalent amounts of the reactants or an excess of one reactant of up to 1.5 equivalents.<br><br>

The novel compounds of the formula I are ligands for complexes of transition metals which are excellent catalysts or catalyst precursors for asymmetric syntheses, for example the asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral, unsaturated, organic compounds. If prochiral unsaturated organic compounds are used, a very high excess of optical isomers can be induced in the synthesis of organic compounds and a high chemical conversion can be achieved in short reaction times. The enantioselectivities and catalyst activities which can be achieved are excellent. Furthermore, such ligands can also be used in other asymmetric addition or cycfization reactions.<br>

It has surprisingly been found that, in the hydrogenation of carboxylic acids of the formula XV using rhodium complexes and ligands of the formula I as catalysts, quite outstanding optical yields of over 97% ee (ee equals enantiomeric excess) and, in addition, even at a high ratio of substrate to catalyst of 5000 and above, complete conversion can be achieved within short reaction times, i.e. a high catalyst activity is observed. The hydrogenation of carboxylic acids of the formula XV using metal complexes of chiral bidentate ligands is described in WO 2002/02500 A1.<br>
A particularly preferred embodiment of the process of the invention is characterized in that compounds of the formula XV,<br><br>
where<br>
R03 and R« are each, independently of one another, H, CrC6-alkyl, Ci-C6-haloalkyl, CrC6-alkoxy, Ci-C6-alkoxy-C-rC6-alkyl or CrCeralkoxy-CTCe-alkyloxy and Ros is CrC6-alkyl, are hydrogenated by means of hydrogen in the presence of rtiodium complexes having ligands of the formula I as catalysts to give compounds of the formula XVI<br><br><br>
R03 is preferably methoxypropyloxy, R04 is preferably methoxy and Ros is preferably isopropyl.<br>
The process of the invention can be carried out at low or elevated temperatures, for example temperatures of from -20 to 150°C, preferably from -10 to 100°C and particularly preferably from 10 to 80"C. The optical yields are generally better at a relatively low temperature than at higher temperatures.<br>
The process of the invention can be carried out at atmospheric pressure or superatmospheric pressure. The pressure can be, for example, from 105 to 2x107 Pa (pascal). Hydrogenations can be carried out at atmospheric pressure or at superatmospheric pressure.<br>
Catalysts are preferably used in amounts of from 0.0001 to 10 mol%, particularly preferably from 0.001 to 10 mol% and very particularly preferably from 0.01 to 5 mol%, based on the compound to be hydrogenated.<br>
The preparation of the ligands and catalysts and also the hydrogenation can be carried out without a solvent or in the presence of an inert solvent, with it being possible to use one solvent or mixtures of solvents. Suitable solvents are, for example, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons (pentane, hexane. petroleum ether, cyclohexane, methylcyclo-hexane, benzene, toluene, xylene), aliphatic halogenated hydrocarbons (methylene chloride, chloroform, dichloroethane and tetrachloroethane), nitriles (acetonitrile, propionitrite, benzo-nitrile), ethers (diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, t-butyl methyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, ethylene glycol diethyl ether, diethyiene glycol dimethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, diethylene glycol monomethyl or monoethyl ether), ketones (acetone, methyl isobutyl ketone), carboxylic esters and lactones (ethyl or methyl acetate, valerolactone), N-sub-stituted lactams (N-methylpyrrolidone), carboxamides (dimethylacetamide, dimethyl-formamide), acyclic ureas (dimethylimidazoline) and sulphoxides and sulphones (dimethyl sulphoxide, dimethyl sulphone, tetramethylene sulphoxide, tetramethylene sulphone) and alcohols (methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether) and water. The solvents can be used alone or as a mixture of at least two solvents.<br><br>
The reaction can be carried out in the presence of cocatalysts, for example quaternary ammonium halides (tetrabutylammonium iodide}, and/or in the presence of protic acids, for example mineral acids (see, for example, US-A-5,583,241 and EP-A-0 691 949). The presence of fluorinated alcohols such as 1,1,1-trifluoroethanol or of bases (amines, alkali metal hydroxides, carbonates and hydrogencarbonates) can likewise promote the catalytic reaction.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is a process for preparing chiral organic compounds by asymmetric addition of hydrogen onto a carbon-carbon or carbon-heteroatom double bond in prochiral organic compounds in the presence of a catalyst, which is characterized in that the addition reaction is carried out in the presence of catalytic amounts of at least one metal complex according to the invention and under neutral to acidic conditions. For the purposes of the present invention, neutral to acidic conditions means the absence of basic components and particularly preferably addition of an acid.<br>
Suitable acids are, for example:<br>
a)	organic acids: aliphatic (linear, branched or cyclic) or aromatic, unhalogenated or halogenated (fluorinated or chlorinated) carboxylic acids, sulphonic acids and phosphoric(V) acids which preferably have 1-20 carbon atoms, particularly preferably 1-12 carbon atoms, for example formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, n-, i-butyric acid, benzoic acid, pnenyJ-acetic acid, cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, chloroacetic acid, fluoroacetic acid, dichloroacetic acid and difluoroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid, perfluorobutyric acid, methanesulphonic acid, ethanesulphonic acid, benzenesulphonic acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid, chlorobenzenesulphonic acid, trifluoromethanesulphonic acid, phosphonic acids and phosphorous acids; and<br>
b)	inorganic acids such as HCI (aqueous); sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, HF, HBF4, HI, HBr, solid acids such as ion exchange resins.<br>
The acid is preferably added in an amount of 1-1 000 000 equivalents of acid per equivalent of catalyst; preferably 1-10 000 equivalents, particularly preferably 10-1000 equivalents.<br>
In processes carried out under neutral to acidic conditions, preferably due to an addition of acid, an increase in the optical yields is surprisingly observed.<br><br>
The metal complexes used as catalysts can be added as separately prepared, isolated compounds or else can be formed in situ prior to the reaction and then be mixed with the substrate to be hydrogenated. It can be advantageous to add additional ligands in the reaction using isolated metal complexes or to use an excess of ligands in the in-situ preparation. The excess can be, for example, up to 6 mol and preferably up to 2 mol, based on the metal compound used for the preparation.<br>
The process of the invention is generally carried out by placing the catalyst in a reaction vessel and then adding the substrate, if appropriate reaction auxiliaries and the compound to be added on and subsequently starting the reaction. Gaseous compounds to be added on, for example hydrogen or ammonia, are advantageously introduced under pressure. The process can be carried out continuously or batchwise in various types of reactor.<br>
The chiral, organic compounds according to the invention are active substances or inter¬mediates for preparing such substances, in particular in the production of flavours and fragrances, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.<br>

D)	Use examples (hydrogen ations)<br><br>
Example D1: Hydrogenation using a substrate/catalyst ratio (S/C) of 2000. 3.04 mg (0.0041 mmol) of ligand B1 and 1.47 mg (0.0039 mmol) of [Rh(nbd)z]BF4 are weighed into a 25 ml Schlenk vessel provided with magnetic stirrer and rubber septum and dissolved in 2 ml of methanol. The solution is stirred for about 10 minutes. A solution of 2.4 g (7.783 mmol) of substrate S1 in 8 ml of methanol is then added. The resulting solution is transferred under pressure by means of a cannula into a 50 ml steel autoclave which is<br><br>
provided with heating and has previously been flooded with argon. The autoclave is connected via a reducing valve to a hydrogen reservoir. The autoclave is closed and the argon is replaced by hydrogen by two cycles of pressurization with hydrogen (60 bar) and depressurization. The autoclave is then pressurized again with 60 bar of hydrogen and the hydrogenation is started at 25DC by switching on the stirrer. After 19.5 hours, the stirrer is switched off, the autoclave is depressurized and the hydrogenation solution is taken out. The conversion and the enantiomeric excess (ee) are determined by means of HPLC (Chirapak AD; 0.46 x 250 mm; hexane/EtOH/AcOH 950:50:1; flow = 0.7 ml/minute; 20°C. The con¬version is quantitative and the ee is 97.4% (S configuration).<br>
The hydrogenations D2 to D25 and comparative examples Comp. 1 to Comp. 4 are carried out analogously at the temperatures and hydrogen pressures indicated in Table 2. In the case of hydrogenations having a relatively high S/C, less catalyst (0.85 mg (0.0023 mmol) of [Rh(nbd)2]BF4 and 0.0024 mmol of ligand) and more substrate are used. In all hydro¬genations, the substrate concentration is 0.78 molar. An analogous procedure is used for the ligandsB2 toB18 and B19 for comparison. The results are shown in Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
1.87 mg (0.005 mmol) of [Rh(nbd)2]BF4 and 0.005 mmol of ligand are weighed into a 10 ml Schlenk vessel provided with magnetic stirrer and rubber septum and dissolved in 1 ml of methanol. The solution is stirred for 10 minutes and a solution of 143 mg (0.5 mmol) of substrate S2 in 4 ml of methanol (S/C = 100) or 285 mg (1 mmol) in 9 ml {SIC = 200) is then added. The resulting solution is transferred under pressure via a cannula to a 50 ml steel autoclave and hydrogenated in a manner analogous to that described in Example D1. The conversion and the enantiomeric excess (ee) are determined by means of HPLC (Chirapak AD-H; 0.46 x 250 mm). The results are shown in Table 3.<br><br><br>
The hydrogenations are carried out in 1.2 ml ampoules. Instead of stirring, intensive shaking is carried out. In a glove box, solutions having a volume of 0.5 ml and compositions shown in Table 4 are prepared in the 1.2 ml ampoules under a nitrogen atmosphere. The catalysts are prepared in situ by mixing 1 equivalent of [Rh(nbd)2]BF4 with 1.3 equivalents of ligand in dichloroethane and subsequently distilling off the dichloroethane under reduced pressure. The substrate is dissolved in the hydrogenation solvent and added as a solution to the catalyst. The ampoules are fixed in place in a pressure-rated, heatable container, the container is closed, the desired temperature is set, the nitrogen atmosphere in the container is replaced by a hydrogen atmosphere at the desired pressure and the hydrogenation is started by switching on the shaker. The conversion and the enantiomeric excess (ee) for the substrates S3 and S4 are determined by means of GC (Chrasii-L-val). The hydrogenation samples from substrate S4 are derivatized beforehand by means of TMS-diazomethane. The conversion and ee for substrate S5 are determined by means of GC (Lipodex-E). The results are summarized in Table 4.<br><br><br><br>
4.89 mg (0.0067 mmol) of ligand B3 and 2.12 mg (0.0032 mmol) of [lr(cod)CI]2 are weighed into a 25 ml Schlenk vessel provided with magnetic stirrer and rubber septum and dissolved in 2 ml of toluene. The solution is stirred for about 10 minutes. A solution of 260 mg (1.27 mmol) of substrate S6,4.7 mg of tetrabutylammonium iodide and 30 mg of acetic acid in 3 ml of toluene is then added. The resulting solution is transferred under pressure via a cannula into a 50 ml steel autoclave provided with heating. The hydrogenation is carried out in a manner analogous to that described in Example D1 (hydrogenation time = 19 hours; room temperature; hydrogen pressure = 80 bar). The conversion and the enantiomeric excess (ee) are determined by means of HPLC (Chiracs! OO-H). The conversion is quantitative and the ee is 31% (R configuration).<br><br><br>
