Field  Of  The  Invention<br>
The present invention relates to aerosol valve actuators of the enclosure or spray dome type. Such actuators generally have a shell-like member mounted onto the pressurized product container and or over the mounting cup of the aerosol valve on the container, and a finger aotuatable means associated with the shell-like enclosure and operatively connected to the aerosol valve stem for actuating the aerosol valve and dispensing  the  product.<br>
Background  Of  The  Invention<br>
In many prior art aerosol valve  actuators of the nature referred to above, the finger actuatable means is a finger pad that is integrally molded as one place with the shell-like enclosure and extends into an opening in the upper portion of the shell-like enclosure. The finger pad has an integral hinge molded to the shell-like enclosure. Inherent in the one-piece molding process is the fact that a results at visible gap exists between the outer periphery of the finger pad and the periphery of the hole in the upper portion of the enclosure. Further, when one-piece prior art actuators of this type are assembled onto the aerosol valve, the finger pad in certain instances may be pushed by the valve stem above its normal non-operating position to a higher them desired position above the top wall posing, leaving a large separation    or    gap     (sometimes    referred    as     a     "smiling"<br><br>
appearance) between the bottom of a portion of the finger pad opposite the hinge and the surrounding shell-like enclosure. The customer and consumer when first encountering such an aerosol actuator may find the above-referenced gaps as aesthetically unappealing, and in the latter Instance as indicating  some  defect  in  the  product.<br>
In other prior art aerosol valve actuators of the above general type, the finger pad is molded as a separate member from the shell-like enclosure and is snap fitted into the shell-like enclosure. In such known prior art actuators, however, there still remains a visible gap between the substantially vertical outer sides of the finger pad and the perimeter of the hole in the upper portion of the shell-like enclosure. Further, when such two-piece prior art actuators of this type are assembled onto the aerosol valve, the finger pad in certain instances is still subject to being pushed by the valve stem above its normal non-operating position to a still higher position above the top wall opening, again leaving the aforesaid large "smiling" gap as in the above-referenced one-piece actuators. The problem of visually unappealing gaps or perceived defects remains for the customer and consumer. Additionally, in such actuators, the snap fit connection is not always sufficient to maintain the two pieces of the actuator assembled during shipping, and feeding and assembly  of  the  actuator  to  the  aerosol  container,   etc.<br>
Still further prior art aerosol valve actuators of the above general type have protruding surfaces positioned below the  top of  the  finger pads  or actuating buttons  to prevent  the<br><br>
finger pad or button being pushed through the opening in the upper portion of the enclosure upon assembly onto the valve. The buttons/pads of such prior art actuators still have substantially vertical sides at the elevation where the buttons/pads pass through the opening, accordingly still show an aesthetically unappealing gap between the vertical sides of the button or pad and the enclosure opening, and thus do not provide the appearance of a smooth surface continuation between the perimeter of the opening in the upper portion of the enclosure and the radially inward upper surface of the finger pad or button immediately adjacent the opening perimeter.<br>
Additionally, there can be a problem of excessive spray noise in enclosure or spray dome   actuators. In such actuators where the spray nozzle is inside the enclosure, sprays through a hole in the side wall of the enclosure, and terminates even slightly short of the side wall, the enclosure motioned on the container cam, act as a resonant sound chamber and  greatly  amplify  the  sound  of  the  spray  noise.<br>
P^ITT^TY  Of  The  Invention<br>
The present invention is intended to provide a gapless, at least two piece, aerosol valve actuator which is strongly constructed, easily manufactured and assembled, functions reliably and efficiently, does not create excessive spray noise, and is aesthetically appealing in its assembled condition. In particular, in the assembled and non-operative condition,      the     finger    pad    actuating    member     leaves     no<br><br>
discernable gap between the perimeter of the opening In the upper portion of the shell-like enclosure and the immediately adjacent finger pad upper surface radially inward of the opening perimeter toward the actuator central awls. Further, by virtue of its design configuration, the finger pad actuating member cannot be pushed through the opening upon assembly  of  the  actuator  onto  the  valve  stem.<br>
The  aerosol  valve  actuator  includes  a  first   shell-like member  and  a  second  actuating member,   the  two  mailers  being<br>
discrete and distinct from one another rather than being integrally molded as one piece. The first shell-like member has a side wall with exterior and interior wall surfaces, an open bottom for mounting to an aerosol container (either by being directly snapped onto the pressurized container and/or by being snapped over the aerosol valve mounting cup mounted on top of the aerosol container), and an upper portion having an opening therein with defining perimeter. The second, actuating, meaner is inserted into the bottom opening of the first shell-like member and is connected to the first shell¬like member, for example by being snap fit or friction fit upon assembly to the inner side wall of the first shell-like member. The second actuator member has a finger actuating pad biased to an upper position when not actuated, a depending tube from the finger actuating pad for cormector to an aerosol valve stem, and an outlet tube in fluid connection with the depending tube and having an outlet nozzle within which a conventional nozzle Insert may be provided as desired. The  outer  end  of   the  outlet  nozzle  is   snap  fit  and  extends<br><br>
into a product dispensing opening la the side wall of the container, firstly to assure maintaining the assembly during shipping and feeding of the actuator, and secondly to lessen spray noise upon actuation since the spray noise can not enter back into the first shell-like member to create a resonant amplification  thereof.<br>
Upon assembly, the finger actuating pad in its non-actuated position extends completely across the opening in the upper portion of the first shall-like member, and has an outer perimeter greater than said opening perimeter. The finger actuating pad has an upper surface including a portion adjunct the pad perimeter which, when the finger pad is in its non-actuated upper position to which It is biased, underlies and contacts the underside of the upper portion of the first shell-like member directly adjacent the upper portion opening. The finger pad cannot be pushed upwardly through the upper opening to leave a large gap (the "smiling" effect) indicating a possible assembly defect, and there is no visible gap in the non-actuated position between the perimeter of the upper portion opening in the first member and the directly adjacent radially inward (toward the actuator central axis)   visible  finger  pad upper  surface.<br>
Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description, drawings and claims.<br><br>

Detailed  Description  Of  Embodiment<br>
Referring to Figs. 1-3, aerosol valve actuator 10 of the present invention is shown assembled from two discrete, separately molded, plastic members 11 and 12. In known fashion, the actuator 10 is for mounting on an aerosol container   (not   shown)   which  may  contain  a  wide  variety  of<br><br>
pressurized products. An aerosol valve (not shown) is located In knovm fashion at the top of the aerosol container In a mounting cup attached to the container, with the aerosol valve stem extending upwardly in known fashion for actuation by aerosol valve actuator 10. Valve actuator 10 can be snapped on to the aerosol container Itself and/or over the rim of the mounting  cup,   again  all  as  well  known.<br>
Member 11 of the aerosol valve actuator 10 Is a shell-like enclosure, in particular shown separately in Fig. 7 in upside-down perspective and shown assembled in cross-section in Fig. 6. Actuating member 12 of actuator 10 Is in particular shown separately in Fig. 8 audit shown assembled in cross-section in Fig. 6. The manner of assembly of shell-like enclosure member 11 and actuating member 12 is described in further  detail  hereinafter.<br>
Shell-like member 11 has side wall 13 with exterior   interior wall surfaces 14 and 15, an open bottom 16 for mounting to an aerosol container, and upper portion 17 having opening 18 therein which has a perimeter 19. Opening 18 may have a downwardly extending flange 20 extending about all or a portion of the opening, or may lack such a flange. The flange 20 may also extend considerably deeper down into upper portion 17 and/or at a substantial angle, if desired for aesthetic reasons. Member 11 may have either a continuous horizontal rib or separate discrete horizontal ribs 21 extending inwardly of Interior wall surface 15 adjacent open bottom 16 to snap onto the aerosol container quid/or over the rim  of  the  mounting  cup  of  the  aerosol  valve.     Side  wall  13<br><br>
has an opening 22 therein for product dispensing as hereinafter described. Side wall 13 further may have brackets 23 and 24 with slots 25 and 26, the brackets extending from interior wall surface 15 adjacent opening 22, for the purpose of assembling actuating messier 12. Circumferentially spaced vertical ribs 27 extending inwardly of interior wall surface 15 also may be provided to lend strength and support to the shell-like  enclosure  member  11.<br>
Referring in particular to Figs. 5,6, and 8, actuating member 12 of aerosol valve actuator 10 includes finger actuating pad 30 (having a central top surface depression 31^ if desired), product tribe 32 depending from the bottom of the finger pad 30 sued having a lower flared socket 33 for engaging the usual aerosol valve stem (not shown), and outlet tube 34 molded into actuating member 12 in fluid connection with depending product tube 32. Outlet tube 34 terminates in outlet nozzle 35 within which may be inserted a conventional nozzle insert 36. Depending below outlet nozzle 35 is bracket 37 having lower bracket side extensions 38 and 39 (see Fig. 8) . Finger pad supporting ribs 40 and 41 also depend from finger pad 30 and extend rearward from product tube 32. Actuating member 12 may be of a contrasting color to enclosure member  11.<br>
When aerosol valve actuator 10 is assembled, actuating member 12 is inserted into the open bottom 16 of shell-like enclosure 11, and bracket extensions 38 and 39 are snap or friction fit into slots 25 and 26 of brackets 23 and 24 of member  11   (see  Figs.   5  and  6).     Outlet  nozzle  35  has  a  front<br><br>
circular end 35X forward of depending bracket 37. Circular end 35A may be dimensioned to snap fit and extend within, and   abut the side wall of, circular product dispensing opening 22 in the side wall of enclosure 11 (see Pig. 6), which prevents spray noise from circular and 35a having an adjacent path back inside shell-like enclosure 11 to create undesirable resonsuit intensification of the spray noise by the enclosure 11. Still further, it is assured that this assembly is retained during transportation of the actuators to a customer, feeding of the actuators to the aerosol containers with aerosol valves by the customers, and assembly of the actuators  onto  the  aerosol  containers.<br>
In the assembled condition of actuator 10, finger actuator pad 30 by virtue of its dimensioning and mounting is biased up against the underside of upper portion 17 of shell¬like enclosure member 11. Flange 20 may or may not be present as part of upper portion 17. When finger pad 30 is actuated by the user,' product tube 32 is pushed downwardly against the aerosol valve stem, aided by outlet tube 34 flexing adjacent outlet nozzle 35. Product in the aerosol container will then flow up tube 32, out tube 34, through the nozzle, and through the exit hole 22 in the enclosure member 11. Then the actuating finger 30 is released, the finger pad 30 is biased back  to  its  non-actuated upper  position  of  Fig.  6.<br>
Finger pad 30 is sized to have an outer surrounding perimeter 45 which is greater than the surrounding perimeter 19 of opening 18 in upper portion 17 of enclosure member 11 (see  Figs.  5,6).     Finger  pad  30  extends.  In  its  non-actuated<br><br>
position,   across opening 18, and has an upper surface 46 Including portion 47 thereof directly adjacent perimeter 45 which underlies and contacts the upper portion 17 of member 11 directly adjacent its opening 18. This contact, in the described embodiment, will be against the bottom of flange 20 that fully encircles opening 18 (see Fig. 6). if it is desired to eliminate flange 20 for design reasons, the contact will be further upward against the underside of upper portion 17 adjacent the perimeter 19 of opening 18. In either event, it will be seen that there will be no visible gap between opening perimeter 19 in member 11 and the Immediately adjacent, radially Inward (toward the vertical axis x-x of actuator  10},  upper  surface  46  of  finger pad  30.<br>
In addition to eliminating the visually less-than-aesthetlc aforedesorlbed gap, the structural dimensioning described Dove provides that finger pad 30 cannot be pushed up through opening 18 when the assembled actuator 10 is first maimed on the aerosol valve stem. The disadvantageous "smiling"  effect  is  thereby  eliminated.<br>
Now referring to Fig. 4, a generalized prior art actuator showing is indicated which is a top plan view corresponding to Fig. 3 for ease of description and comparison. In Fig. 4, actuating finger pad or button 60 is positioned within opening 61 in the upper portion 62 of the shell-like enclosure of an aerosol actuator 63. Here, however, as contrasted with Fig. 3, a gap 64 extends about the perimeter 65 of the finger pad or button 60. (It should again be noted that reference numeral  20   in  Fig.   3 refers  not  to  any  gap  but  rather  to  a<br><br><br>
flange of the shell-like enclosure). Gap 64 in the prior art of Fig. 4 is considered unattractive to aerosol product marketers and to consumers, and may also allow for finger pad or button 60 to be pushed in part above the top of the actuator 63 when the actuator is assemblies to the valve stem, thereby creating the "smiling" effect. The generalized actuator of Fig. 4 may include any of the three types referenced above  in  the  "Background  Of  The  Invention."<br>
The several features of the present invention described above together define a unique, simple and strong aerosol actuator which Is easily manufactured and assembled, is aesthetically pleasing, does not create excessive spray noise, and which functions  reliably and efficiently for  the consumer.<br>
It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that variations and/or modifications may be made to the present invention without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The present embodiment is, therefore, to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive. It should also be understood that positional terms as used in the specification are used and Intended in relation to the normal positioning shown in the assembly and cross-sectional drawings    are not  otherwise  Intended  to  be  restrictive.<br><br><br>
