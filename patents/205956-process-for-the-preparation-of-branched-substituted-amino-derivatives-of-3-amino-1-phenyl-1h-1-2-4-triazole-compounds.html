COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"PROCESS  FOR THE  PREPARATION  OF BRANCHED  SUBSTITUTED AMINO DERIVATIVES OF 3-AMINO-1 -PHENYL- 1H-[1, 2, 4] TRIAZOLE<br>
COMPOUNDS"<br>
SANOFI-SYNTHELABO, 174, Avenue de France, F-75013 Paris, France,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
A subject-matter of the present invention is novel branched substituted amino derivatives of 3-amino-l -phenyl- 1H-[1, 2, 4] triazole, precesses for their preparation and the pharmaceutical compositions comprising them.<br>
These novel triazole derivatives have an antagonistic activity with respect to CRF (Corticotropin releasing factor) and can thus constitute active principles of pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) is a peptide whose sequence of 41 amino acids was characterized by Vale W. et. Al. in 1981 (Science, 1981, 213, 1394-1397). CRF is the main endogenous factor involved in the regulation of the hypothalamohypophy so suprarenal axis (release of adrenocorticotropic hormone: ACTH) and its pathologies, and also in the depressive syndromes which result from its dysfuncitoning. CRF also causes the secretion of (3-Hptroin and of corticosterone. CRF is therefore the physiological regulator of the secretion of adrnocorticotropc hormone<br><br>
Cortisol by the effect of ACTH at the suprarenal level and more generally of peptides derived from proopiomelanocortin (POMC). In addition to its location in the hypothalamus, CRF is widely distributed in the central nervous system but also in extraneuronal tissues, such as the suprarenal glands and the testicles. The presence of CRF has also been demonstrated during inflammatory processes.<br>
Numerous animal experiments have shown that the central administration of CRF causes varied anxiogenic effects, such as modification of the behaviour in general: for example neophobia, reduction in sexual receptivity and decrease in food consumption and slow-wave sleep in the rat. The<br>
intracerebroventricular injection of CRF also increases the excitation of the noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus which is often associated in animals with a state of anxiety. In the rat, the central or peripheral administration of CRF or of related peptides (for example urocortin, sauvagine) induces, in addition to central effects, such as increase in alertness and in emotional reactivity to the surroundings, modifications in gastric dumping, in acid secretion, in intestinal transit time and in faecal excretion, as well as tensional effects. CRF is also involved in the complex regulation of inflammatory responses, on the one hand with a pro-inflammatory role in some animal models (degranulation of mastocytes resulting in the<br><br>
release of inflammatory molecules, such as histamine, prostaglandins, and the like) and, on the other hand, as inhibitor of the effects brought about by the increase in the vascular permeability as a result of the inflammation.<br>
The use of a peptide antagonist, α-helical CRF(9-41) (CCH-CRF) , or of specific antibodies (Rivier J. et al.,   Science, 1984, 224,   889-891) has made it possible to confirm the role of this peptide .in all these effects. These experiments have also confirmed the important role of CRF in man in the integration of the complex responses observed during physiological, psychological or immunological stress, simultaneously at the neuroendocrinal, visceral and behavioural levels (Morley J.E. et  al.,   Endocrine Review, 1987, 8,   3, 256-287; Smith M.A. et al., Horm. Res., 1989, 31,   66-71). In addition, clinical data militate in favour of the effective involvement of CRF in many disorders resulting from a condition of stress (Gulley L.R. et al.,   J. Clin. Psychiatry, 1993, 54,   1,    (suppl.), 16-19), for example:<br>
the existence of the CRF test (i.v. administration) in man has made it possible to show the modification in the ACTH response in depressive patients (Breier A. et al.,   Am. J. Psychiatry, 1987, 144,   1419-1425).<br>
the discovery of an endogenous CRF hypersecretion in certain pathologies, for example a<br><br>
high level of CRF in the cephalorrhachidian fluid in non-medicated patients who are depressed or affected by dementia of Alzheimer's disease type (Nemeroff C.B. et al.,   Science 1984, 226,   4680, 1342-1343; Regul. Pept., 1989, 25,   123-130) or a decreased density of CRF receptors in the cortex of suicide victims (Nemeroff C.B. et al.,   Arch. Gen. Psychiatry, 1988, 45,   577-579).<br>
the dysfunctioning of CRF-dependent neurons is even suggested in the severe pathologies which are Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, Huntington's chorea and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (De Souza E.B., Hospital Practice, 1988, 23,   59).<br>
The central administration of CRF in many animal species produces behavioural effects similar to those obtained in man in stress situations. When they are repeated over time, these effects can result in various pathologies, such as: fatigue, hypertension, heart and tensional disorders, modification in gastric dumping and in faecal excretion (colitis, irritable bowel), modification in acid secretion, hyperglycaemia, retarded growth, anorexia, neophobia, migraines, reproductive disorders, immunosuppression (inflammatory processes, multiple infections and cancers) and varied neuropsychiatric disorders (depression, anorexia or bulimia nervosa and anxiety).<br>
The injection via the intracerebroventricular route of the reference peptide antagonist, αH-CRF (9-41), prevents the effects obtained either by the<br><br>
administration of exogenous CRF or by the use of stress-inducing agents (ether, restraint, noise, electric shock, weaning from ethanol or surgery) capable by themselves of inducing an increase in the level of endogenous CRF. These results are confirmed by the study of many antagonist peptide molecules which are structurally related to CRF and which have a prolonged duration of action with respect to aH-CRF (9-41) (Rivier J. et al.,   J. Med. Chem., 1993, 36,   2851-2859; Menzaghi F. et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1994, 269,   2, 564-572; Hernandez J.F. et  al., J. Med. Chem., 1993, 36,   2860-2867) .<br>
Such CRF-antagonist peptide compounds are disclosed, for example, in Patents US 5 109 111, US 5 132 111 and US 5 245 009 and in Patent Applications WO 92/22 576 and WO 96/19 499.<br>
In addition, preliminary studies have shown that tricyclic anti-depressants can modulate the level of CRF and the number of CRF receptors in the brain (Grigoriadis D.E. et al., Neuropsychopharmacology, 1989, 2,   53-60). Likewise, benzodiazepine anxiolytics are capable of inhibiting the effect of CRF (Britton K.T. et al.,   Psychopharmacology, 1988, 94,   306), without the mechanism of action of these substances being entirely elucidated. These results confirm, if necessary, the growing need for non-peptide antagonist molecules for CRF receptors.<br><br>
It is also important to point out three possible consequences of conditions of chronic stress, which are immunodepression, fertility disorders and the development of diabetes.<br>
CRF exerts such effects by interacting with specific membrane receptors which have been characterized in the pituitary gland and the brain of numerous species (mouse, rat and man), as well as in .the heart, the squelettal muscle (rat, mouse) and in the myometrium and the placenta during pregnancy. The 3-amino-l-phenyl-lH-[1,2,4]triazole compounds are not represented to any great extent. Mention may be made in particular of compounds carrying a phenyl at the 5-position as disclosed by Ebenreth A. et al.    (Pharmazie, 1992, 47(1),   556-7) and by Bozo E., Szilagil G. and Janaky J. (Arch. Pharm., 1989, 322(10), 583-7, Patents Nos. HU44522, HU195791, 1986), who claim antiinflammatary-antirheumatic properties. In two Japanese patents (JP 02091061 and JP 2729810, 1988), Inamori et al. claim the preparation of 3-amino-l-phenyl-lH-[1,2,4]triazoles as insecticides.<br>
In the Neurocrine patent application published under the number WO 96/39 400, 3-amino-5-phenyl-lH-[1,2,4]triazole compounds are disclosed as antagonists of CRF receptors.<br>
It has now been found, according to the present invention, that some 3-amino-1-phenyl-1H-[1,2,4]triazole derivatives which are a subject-matter<br><br>
of the present invention have an  excellent affinity with respect to CRF receptors. Furthermore, due to their structure, these molecules have good dispersibility and/or solubility in solvents or solutions commonly used in therapeutics, which confers a pharmacological activity on them and also make possible the ready preparation of oral and parenteral pharmaceutical dosage forms.<br>

The compounds of the invention in the free form generally exhibit weak base properties.<br>
The salts of the compounds of formula (I) with pharmaceutically acceptable acids are the preferred salts but those which can make it possible to isolate the compounds of formula (I), in particular to purify them or to obtain pure enantiomers or diastereoisomers, are also a subject-matter of the invention.<br>
Mention may be made, among the pharmaceutically acceptable acids for the preparation of the addition salts to the compounds of formula (I), of hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, fumaric, citric, oxalic, sulphuric, ascorbic, tartaric, maleic, mandelic, methanesulphonic, lactobionic, gluconic, glucaric, succinic, sulphonic or hydroxypropane-sulphonic acids.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be prepared according to two synthetic routes A and B.<br>
Synthetic route A is represented in SCHEME 1.<br><br>
SCHEME 1: Route A<br><br><br>
By route A, the compound (I) is prepared by condensation of the anilinoguanidine hydrochloride (II) with an acid halide of R4-CO-X type or an acid anhydride R4-CO-O-CO-R4 in the presence of an organic base' (pyridine, triethylamine, and the like) in an organic solvent, preferably pyridine.<br>
In the case where R4 represents hydrogen, the acid halide is replaced by formic acid (Chem. Ber., 1965, 98,   1476-1486).<br>
The anilinoguanidine hydrochloride (II) is obtained by reaction of a phenylhydrazine hydrochloride (III) with a cyanamide (IV) in a refluxing alcohol, preferably isopropanol, according to the method described by Erczi et al.    (Eur. J. Med. Chem., 1993, 28,   185-193).<br>
The phenylhydrazine hydrochloride (III) may be commercially available or may be prepared from the corresponding aniline by diazotization and then reduction by tin(II) chloride or by alkaline sulphates.<br>
The cyanamide (IV) is prepared from the secondary amine (V) by reaction with cyanogen bromide in an organic solvent, such as diethyl ether or acetonitrile.<br>
This synthetic route A is particularly efficient when R5 is a group of alkyl type.<br>
Synthetic route B is represented in SCHEME 2.<br><br>
SCHEME   2<br><br><br>
When the starting amine is secondary, the alternative form Bl is used and when it is primary, the alternative form B2 is used.<br>
By route Bl, the aminotriazole (I) is prepared by condensation of phenylhydrazine (III) with an -N-acyl-S-methylisothiourea (VI) by heating in toluene, xylene, dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulphoxide. When the phenylhydrazine (III) is salified, for example in the hydrochloride form, a base such as triethylamine, N, N-diethylaniline or caesium carbonate is added.<br>
The N-acyl-s-methylisothiourea (VI) is obtained from the iV-acylthiourea (VII) by S-methylation with iodomethane in a solvent, such as dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran, after the action of a base, preferably sodium hydride, or else in dimethylformamide or tetrahydrofuran in the presence of caesium carbonate.<br>
The N-acylthiourea (VII) is obtained by addition of the secondary amine (V) to the acyl isothiocyanate R4CONCS. The operating conditions, temperature and solvent can vary according to the reactivity of the amines. The solvents used can be, for example, acetone, dichloromethane, benzene, toluene or chloroform.<br>
The acyl isothiocyanate R4CONCS is prepared beforehand by reaction between an acyl halide R4COCl and<br><br>
an alkaline thiocyanate (ammonium thiocyanate, .for example) in acetone, generally.<br>
By route B2, the aminotriazole (I) is prepared from an NH aminotriazole (VIII) by an alkylation reaction. The operating conditions vary according to the reactivity of the secondary amine and of the halide. The systems used can be: sodium hydride/DMF, potassium hydride/benzene/crown ether, potassium hydride/tetrahydrofuran/crown ether, alkaline terfc-butoxide/DMSO.<br>
The synthetic conditions for the preparation of the NH aminotriazole (VIII) from the primary amine (XI) via the intermediates N-alcylthiourea (X) and then N-acyl-S-methylisothiourea (IX) are similar to those described for route Bl.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are salified,<br>
	,    ...<br>
generally in the hydrochloride form. These hydrochlorides can be in the form of crystalline or amorphous solids obtained by precipitation from a solvent (or a mixture of solvents), such as pentane, diisopropyl ether or diethyl ether.<br>
The primary amines (XI) and the secondary amines (V) used, when they exhibit an asymmetric carbon (R6 = CH(Rs)R7), can be in the racemic or enantiomeric form.<br>
Among the usual methods for the synthesis of primary amines, two methods have been particularly used, one from amino acid, the other from substituted<br><br>
phenyl ketone (1). in the latter case, the synthesis is carried out according to SCHEME 3 below. The substituted phenyl ketone (1) is converted to the oxime<br>
(2)	and then to the benzyloxime (3). The benzyloxime<br>
(3)	is reduced, either with lithium aluminium hydride, in order to obtain a racemic amine, or with a chiral complex, such as a chiral oxazaborolidine-borane complex, in order to obtain an amine in the form of an enantiomer.<br><br>
The compounds of formula (I) above also comprise those in which one or more hydrogen or carbon atoms have been replaced by their radioactive isotope, for example tritium or carbon-14. Such labelled compounds are of use in research, metabolic or pharmacokinetic work or alternatively in biochemical assays as receptor ligands.<br><br>
The compounds of the present invention have formed the subject of biochemical and pharmacological studies. They have highly advantageous pharmacological properties. The compounds of the invention displace, at concentrations of less than 10 μM, the binding of iodinated CRF or related peptides (urotensin, sauvagine), for example 125I-Tyr-CRF, to receptors present on brain membranes or on cultured cells, according to the method described by E. B. De Souza (J. Neurosci., 1987, 7,   1, 88-100).<br>
The antagonist activity of the compounds according to the invention has been demonstrated by their ability to inhibit some activities associated with CRF. In particular, the compounds of formula (I) are capable of inhibiting the secretion of corticotropin (ACTH) induced by CRF. The study on the secretion of ACTH induced by CRF has been carried out in  vivo  in conscious rats, according to a method adapted from C. Rivier et al.,   Endocrinology, 1982, 110(1),   272-278.<br>
CRF is a neuropeptide which controls the activity of the hypothalamohypophysosuprarenal axis. This factor is responsible for endocrinal and behavioural responses related to stress.<br>
Indeed, it has been shown that CRF can modulate the behaviour and also some functions of the autonomous nervous system (G. F. Koob, F. E. Bloom, Fed. Proc, 1985, 44,   259; M. R. Brown, L. A. Fisher,<br><br>
Fed. Proc, 1985, 44,   243). More particularly, CRF induces the secretion of corticotropin (ACTH), (3-endorphins and other peptides derived from proopiomelanocortin (A. Tazi et al.,   Regul. Peptides,   1987, 18,   37; M. R. Brown et al. ,   Regul. Peptides,<br>
1986,	16,   321; C. L. Williams et al., Am. J. Physiol.,<br>
1987,	G 582, 253).<br>
The compounds of the invention may therefore be used in regulating the secretion of these endogenous substances. They are more especially applied, as active principles in medicaments for decreasing the response to stress, (behaviour, emotional states, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular disorders or disorders of the immune system) and more generally in pathologies involving CRF, for example psychiatric disorders, anxiety, depression, anorexia and bulimia nervosa, epilepsy, disorders of sexual activity and of fertility, Alzheimer's disease or others.<br>
The compounds of the invention are very stable and are therefore particularly appropriate in forming the active principle of medicaments.<br>
The invention also applies to the pharmaceutical compositions comprising, as active principle, a compound of formula (I) or one of its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, optionally in combination with one or more appropriate inert excipients.<br><br>
In each dosage unit, the active principle of formula (I) is present in amounts suitable for the daily doses envisaged. Each dosage unit is suitably adjusted according to the dosage and the type of administration anticipated, for example tablets, hard gelatin capsules and the like, chartulas, phials, syrups and the like, drops or transdermal or transmucosal patches, so that such a dosage unit comprises 0.5 to 800 mg of active principle, preferably 0.5 to 200 mg having to be administered each day.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can also be used in combination with another active principle used in the desired therapy, such as, for example, anxiolytics, antidepressants or anorexigenics.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) have little toxicity; their toxicity is compatible with their use as a medicament in the treatment of the above disorders and diseases.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can be formulated in pharmaceutical compositions for administration to mammals, in particular man, for the treatment of the abovesaid diseases.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions thus obtained are advantageously presented in various forms, such as, for example, injectable solutions or solutions to be taken orally, dragees,itablets or hard gelatin capsules. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one compound of formula. (I) or one of its salts<br><br>
as active principle are in particular of use in the preventive or curative treatment of diseases related to stress and more generally in the treatment of all pathologies involving CRF, such as, for example: Cushing's disease, neuropsychiatry disorders, such as depression, anxiety, panic attacks, post-traumatic<br>
stress, compulsive obsessive disorders, mood disorders, behavioural disorders, aggressiveness, anorexia, bulimia, hyperglycaemia, premature labour, at-risk pregnancies, retarded growth, sleep disorders, epilepsy and depressions of all types; degenerative disorders: Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease; Huntington's chorea and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; vascular, cardiac and qerebral disorders; disorders of sexual activity and of fertility; premature labour, immunodepression, immunosuppression, inflammatory processes, multiple infections, interstitial cystitis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, uveitides, psoriasis and diabetes; cancers; functional gastrointestinal disorders and inflammations which result therefrom (irritable and inflammatory colon, diarrhoea); disorders of pain perception, fibromyalgias related or not related to sleep disorders, fatigue or migraine; or symptoms related to (alcohol) dependence and to weaning from drugs.<br>
The posology can vary widely as a function of<br><br>
the age, weight and state of health of the patient, of the nature and severity of the ailment and of the<br><br>
administration route. This posology comprises the administration of one or more doses of approximately 0.5 mg to 800 mg of active principle, preferably 0.5 to 200 mg, each day.<br>
In the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention for oral, sublingual, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, transdermal, transmucosal, local or rectal administration, the active principle can be administered to animals and human beings in unit forms of administration, mixed with conventional pharmaceutical vehicles. Appropriate unit forms of administration comprise forms intended for the oral route, such as tablets, hard gelatin capsules, powders, granules and solutions or suspensions to be taken orally, forms for sublingual and buccal administration, forms for subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intranasal or intraocular administration and forms for rectal administration.<br>
