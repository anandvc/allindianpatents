Description<br>
A device for feeding a product, in particular an infusion product,<br>
to a packaging machine<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to a device for feeding a product to<br>
a packaging machine.<br>
In particular, this invention can be advantageously used for<br>
5    feeding an infusion product such as tea, coffee, camomile, herbs<br>
or the like to an automatic packaging machine for making infusion<br>
packets, which the present specification expressly refers to but<br>
without restricting the scope of the invention.<br>
10    Background Art<br>
Usually, an automatic machine for making infusion packets<br>
such as filter bags, sachets, filter-paper pods, etc. comprises a<br>
plurality of stations located one after the other along a<br>
production line forming part of the automatic machine itself, and<br>
15 including, in particular, a feed station for placing measured<br>
quantities of infusion product on a web of filter material used to<br>
make the packets.<br>
The feed station as a whole is in turn of known type and is<br>
defined by an upright tubular duct, into the open, funnel-shaped<br>
20 top end of which the infusion product is placed, and whose bottom<br>
end is connected with conveyor means designed to receive the<br>
infusion product from the tubular duct and to feed it to the<br>
hopper of a metering device which places measured quantities of<br>
the product on a web of filter paper.<br>
25 At present, the conveyor means most widely used for<br>
applications of this kind can be divided broadly into the<br>
following two types: a first type, described for example in US<br>
patent US 4,628,973, comprises a rotary drum consisting basically<br>
of  a hollow frustoconical body.  The  flared  top  end of  the<br><br>
WO 2006/048762	PCT/IB2005/003361<br>
2<br>
frustoconical body receives the bottom end of the aforementioned<br>
tubular duct, whilst the bottom end of the frustoconical body is<br>
partly inserted into the hopper of the metering device.<br>
Feed stations equipped with rotary drums of this kind are<br>
5    very effective for feeding the infusion product and have for many<br>
years been the most widely used. These feed stations have inherent<br>
operating limits,  however, particularly at the high speeds at<br>
which modern packaging machines now normally operate.<br>
A second type of conveyor means, described for example in<br>
10     European patent application No.  EP 1.34 0.669 A2,  comprises an<br>
endless conveyor belt trained around a pair of pulleys, mounted<br>
under the upright tubular duct and leading into the hopper of the<br>
metering device, preferably at an angle to the hopper itself.<br>
This solution has considerable disadvantages, due in<br>
15 particular to the powdery nature of the infusion product fed to<br>
the metering device hopper.<br>
Indeed, the infusion product particles tend to adhere to the<br>
conveyor pulleys, causing them to jam and eventually leading to<br>
conveyor failure and prolonged down time.<br>
2	0         Moreover,  cleaning the conveyor and conveyor pulleys to<br>
remove infusion product particles and dust may be a difficult and<br>
laborious task, often requiring the conveyor drive mechanisms and<br>
components to be completely dismantled.<br>
The aim of this invention is to provide an infusion product<br>
25    feeding device that overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art<br>
described above.<br>
In particular, it is an aim of the present invention to<br>
provide feed device that is at once simple and efficient and that<br>
is capable of feeding the infusion product to a packaging machine<br>
3	0    that operates at high production speeds.<br>
Disclosure of the invention<br>
This invention accordingly provides a device for feeding a<br>
product,  in particular  an  infusion product,  to  a packaging<br>
3 5    machine,  the device being of the type comprising means  for<br>
collecting and transporting the product and means for conveying<br>
the product itself, the conveying means being connected to the<br><br>
WO 2006/048762	PCT/IB2005/003361<br>
3<br>
collection means to receive the product from the collection means<br>
and to feed the product to an operating station of the packaging<br>
machine,  the device being characterised in that the conveying<br>
means comprise vibrating channelling means.<br>
5<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
The technical characteristics of the invention, with<br>
reference to the above aims, are clearly described in the claims<br>
below  and  its  advantages  are  apparent  from  the  detailed<br>
10 description which follows, with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawing which illustrates a preferred, non restricting embodiment<br>
of the invention provided merely by way of example, and which<br>
represents a feeding device according to the invention in a front<br>
view.<br>
15<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments of the Invention<br>
With reference to the accompanying drawing, the numeral 1<br>
denotes in its entirety, a feeding device used for feeding an<br>
infusion product  (tea, coffee, camomile, etc.)  to an automatic<br>
2	0    packaging machine (of known type and therefore not illustrated)<br>
which is designed to make packets (also of known type and not<br>
illustrated). More specifically, the device 1 forms an integral<br>
part of an operating feed station of the packaging machine itself.<br>
â–  As illustrated in the accompanying drawing, the device 1<br>
25    comprises a substantially funnel-shaped container 2 having a<br>
flared open top end 3 which is fitted with a lid 4 and into which<br>
the infusion product is placed, and a bottom end 5 which is<br>
connected to a hollow vertical tubular element 6.<br>
The bottom end 7 of the tubular element 6 ends at and gives<br>
3	0    onto conveying means 8 which are designed to receive the infusion<br>
product falling out of the container 2 through the tubular element<br>
6 itself and to feed it (arrow F) to a hopper 9 of a customary<br>
metering device 10 forming part of the operating feed station of<br>
the packaging machine.<br>
3 5 More specifically, the tubular element S is equipped with<br>
manual adjustment means 11 for adjusting the distance of its<br>
bottom end 7 from the conveying means 8 in such a way as to<br><br>
WO 2006/048762	PCT/IB2005/003361<br>
4<br>
control  the  quantity  of  infusion  product  falling  onto  the<br>
conveying means 8.<br>
With reference to the accompanying drawing,  the conveying<br>
means 8 comprise a substantially tube-shaped duct 12, a first<br>
5    portion 13 of which is located under the end 7 of the tubular<br>
element 6 and a second portion 14 of which is tilted towards the<br>
hopper 9 and leads into the hopper 9 itself.<br>
The duct 12,  in particular at its first portion 13,  is<br>
supported by and  coupled  with vibrating  actuating means  15<br>
10     designed to impart to the duct 12 a vibrating motion of defined<br>
amplitude in order to feed the infusion product on the duct 12<br>
itself quickly towards the hopper 9 of the metering device 10.<br>
At the top of it, the duct 12 is preferably equipped with<br>
opening/closing elements 16 providing easy access to the inside of<br>
15    the duct 12 for maintenance purposes so as to enable cleaning to<br>
be carried out quickly and easily.<br>
Positioned and operating on the tubular element 6 there are<br>
permanent magnet means 17 for retaining any metal particles that<br>
may be present in the infusion product, thereby preventing such<br>
2 0    metal particles from advancing along the element 6 and reaching<br>
the hopper 9.<br>
During use, the metal particles retained by the means 17 can<br>
be removed by staff responsible for the maintenance of the<br>
packaging machine.<br>
25 The invention described can be modified and adapted in several<br>
ways without thereby departing from the scope of the inventive<br>
concept. Moreover, all the details of the invention may be<br>
substituted by technically equivalent elements.<br><br>
