				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a device for milling treatment, in particular, rock or other materials, with a<br>
spindle drum which is rotatably mounted on a drum support about a drum axis, in which a plurality of<br>
tool spindles are supported eccentrically to the drum axis to be rotatably drivable about spindle axes and<br>
carry machining tools at their ends projecting from the spindle drum. The invention further relates to a<br>
method for milling rock or the like using such a device.<br>
For the milling of rock or other hard materials as for example of extraction products in underground or<br>
open-work mining, of tarmac or concrete components in road or structural engineering, a plurality of<br>
milling systems are known, which are mainly rotary driven drums or discs, at the circumference of which<br>
are mounted milling tools, for example round shaft bits, in an evenly distributed manner. If rock or coal<br>
is extracted in underground mining with such a drum provided with milling tools at its circumference, for<br>
example with the help of a drum shearer loader, and the cutting disk or drum cuts or mills the material to<br>
be extracted with a full face cut, approximately half of all machining tools arranged at the circumference<br>
of the drum are engaged simultaneously. Each machining tool is engaged with the material to be<br>
machined during the full face cut via half a rotation, that is 180°, which results in that the hard metal tips<br>
of the tools are heated to very high temperatures and wear quickly, especially in harder materials.<br>
A further disadvantage with the known machines consists in that the entire contact pressure, with which<br>
the drum abuts against the rock, is distributed onto a large number of individual tools, so that for every<br>
individual chisel in use, only a comparatively small pressure force is available. If the entire pressure of<br>
the drum against the rock is for example about 2000 N, and about 20 individual tools are always used<br>
during a full cut, on the average every individual tool has only a contact pressure of 100 N . Furthermore,<br>
it is also difficult to axially drive into the material to be machined with the known devices, in which the<br>
tools are drivingly connected at the circumference of a roller or a drum, which problem can be attributed<br>
to the fact that the optimum cutting speed is at the outer diameter of the drums, and that the cutting speed<br>
is consistently reduced in the direction towards the axis of rotation of the drum or the roller, and becomes<br>
so small in the proximity of the axis of rotation, that cutting is practically impossible there. Even when<br>
the drum is provided with tools at its face side, these cannot break out the rock abutting their face during<br>
the axial driving-in of the drum in a reasonable manner.<br>
From DE 34 45 492 C2, a boring head for boring in rock is known , which comprises a tool support with<br>
boring tools, which is mounted on a central shaft, which is coupled to bore rods extending between the<br>
bore hole and the boring head. The boring tools at the tool support can be rotatably driven via a planetary<br>
gear transmission.<br>
It is the object of the invention to create a device for the milling treatment of rock or other materials of<br>
the above-mentioned type, which is able to also treat very hard materials with a high milling<br>
performance, whereas, compared to conventionally driven tools, the pressing forces exerted by the<br>
spindle drum are reduced and the edge lives of the tools are extended. Particularly, the device according<br>
to invention shall have a high operational security, be compact and offer the possibility to receive<br><br>
2<br>
machining tools of different types as for example milling rollers, saw blades, undercutting tools or the<br>
like with arbitrary weights and sizes.<br>
This object is being solved with the invention with the features as defined in the independent claims. As<br>
at least two of the tool spindles can be driven by a common transmission gear drive, which comprises<br>
driven gear wheels drivingly connected to the tool spindles and a common drive element, in particular a<br>
drive gear wheel or also a drive chain, a drive transmission belt or the like, which drive element<br>
cooperates with the driven gear wheels, while the drive element and the spindle drum can be rotated<br>
relatively to one another, a particularly compact arrangement of a device is created, in which the at least<br>
two tool spindles with the tools thereon are driven synchronously outside the centre axis of the spindle<br>
drum. The machining tools arranged at the tool spindles can thereby be adjusted easily so that even<br>
during a full cut with an abutment of 180° respectively only one machining tool or only a few tools are<br>
used simultaneously, so that the entire available pressing force of the spindle drum can respectively only<br>
be used by one or a few tools, that is, the individual tool presently in engagement with the rock has a<br>
very high loosening force.<br>
It is possible that the spindle drum comprises a rotary drive, which is decoupled from the transmission<br>
gear drive. In this embodiment, the spindle drum is thus rotated by a rotary drive and the tool spindles<br>
experience their drive independently of the rotary speed of the spindle drum. With this embodiment, it is<br>
even feasible to stop the spindle drum in any case briefly during the axial drive-in of the device into the<br>
rock and to bore a short distance into the rock only by rotation of the tool spindles, and only then to start<br>
the drive for the spindle drum.<br>
It has proved to be particularly advantageous if the spindle drum and at least some of the tool spindles<br>
have a common rotary drive, so that, with a rotation of the spindle drum, the tool spindles which are also<br>
acted upon by the common rotary drive are also automatically rotated.<br>
In this context, it is constructional ly advantageous if the drive element formed from a drive gear wheel is<br>
arranged irrotationally with respect to the drum support, in particular firmly connected to the drum<br>
support. The driven gear wheels drivingly connected to the tool spindles then mesh with the drive gear<br>
wheel arranged irrotationally with respect to the drum support, whereby the tool spindles are rotated<br>
when the spindle drum in which the tool spindles are received is driven by the rotary drive. Very high<br>
forces and torques can be transferred with such a planetary gear drive with a particularly compact design.<br>
The tool spindles are preferably received in bearing bushes by means of bearings in a rotary manner and<br>
are conveniently sealed by shaft seals. It is particularly advantageous with such an arrangement, if the<br>
bearing bushes with the tool spindles mounted therein in a rotary manner are inserted and locked in an<br>
exchangeable manner like cartridges in drum chambers provided at the spindle drum. The tool spindles<br>
can then be replaced with their bearings and possibly seals by simple exchange of the bearing bushes in<br>
the structural unit, for example when they are worn or when tool spindles for other machining tools are to<br><br>
3<br>
be used. The tool spindles in the bearing bushes are pre-mounted, so that removal and fitting of this<br>
structural unit only takes a very short time.<br>
Preferably, all tool spindles can be drivable via the common drive gear wheel of the transmission gear<br>
drive. However, it is also easily possible that a first group of tool spindles is drivable via a first common<br>
drive gear wheel and a second group of tool spindles is drivable via a second common drive gear wheel,<br>
for example in a case in which a first group of tool spindles is arranged at the spindle drum on a pitch<br>
circle having a larger diameter and a second group of tool spindles is arranged on a pitch circle having a<br>
smaller diameter. The gear transmission ratios between the tool spindles of the first group and the first<br>
drive gear wheel and the tool spindles of the second group and the second drive gear wheel and/or the<br>
directions of rotation of the tool spindles of the first and second group can then be different. As already<br>
suggested above, the tool spindles of the first group and those of the second group can be arranged with a<br>
different radial distance from the drum axis in the spindle drum, that is, on two different pitch circles.<br>
The tool spindles are preferably arranged uniformly distributed over the circumference in the spindle<br>
drum.<br>
In a particularly advantageous embodiment of the device according to invention it is possible that the<br>
machining tool(s) of one tool spindle is/are arranged in an offset manner relative to the arrangement of<br>
the machining tool(s) of the tool spindle being arranged in front or behind that one tool spindle in the<br>
drum circumference direction . In other words, the machining tools of tool spindles following each other<br>
in the circumferential direction of the spindle drum can be arranged with regard to one another in a<br>
phase-shift manner . This arrangement makes it possible to ensure in a particularly advantageous manner<br>
during the execution of the method according to the invention for milling of rock, that an individual tool<br>
arranged at a tool spindle reaches engagement with the rock to be machined at another point than an<br>
individual tool of a tool spindle lying in front of it in the direction of rotation. It is thus ensured by the<br>
phase-shifted arrangement of the tools that the impact points of the individual tools or cutters of the<br>
different tool spindles do not overlap, but that a following tool machines the rock at a point which the<br>
tools of a tool spindle moved previously through the rock have left. Thereby a particularly effective<br>
treatment of the rock or the like is achieved. In order to achieve the desired phase shift or the offset angle<br>
as exactly as possible, the machining tools are preferably arranged in an adjustable manner at the tool<br>
spindles, that is, they can be adjusted in their angular position relative to the tool spindles.<br>
The machining tools can comprise one or several machining bits or individual tools at every tool spindle.<br>
In a particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention, at least some of the individual tools can<br>
consist of straight shank bits, while in some cases, flat chisel tools or roller bits have proved themselves,<br>
in particular roller bits which are formed conically on one side. For many machining uses it has proved to<br>
be advantageous if the machining tools project at the most with 50% of their machining surfaces radially<br>
over the outer circumference, that is, that at the most half of the individual machining tools of a tool<br>
spindle are in simultaneous engagement with the rock or the like.<br><br>
4<br>
The spindle drum can be provided with a preferably centrically arranged dust extraction opening, through<br>
which the fine dust which results during the milling treatment of the rock or the like can be extracted. It<br>
is also advantageous, if the device is provided with at least one sprinkling device for the machining tools,<br>
with which on the one hand the resulting dust can be bound by water sprayed on the machining point,<br>
and on the other hand, a cooling of the machining tools can be provided. The sprinkling device is<br>
preferably arranged at the spindle drum and/or at the drum support.<br>
With the device according to invention, machining tools of different types can be used. It is thus<br>
possible, when the machining tools of one or several of the tool spindles essentially consist of a chisel<br>
support and several round bits, flat bits and/or roller chisels arranged thereon, whereas the arrangement is<br>
in such a manner that the chisel/bit tools arranged at the chisel support machine the rock or other<br>
respectively machined material in an undercutting manner in one or more layers. The arrangement is<br>
preferably made in such a manner that a tool operating in several layers tapers in the direction of the rock<br>
to be machined, preferably in the form of steps. The machining tools can essentially also consist of<br>
milling rollers, which are arranged on one or several tool spindles. These milling rollers can be formed<br>
cylindrically or can taper conically or expand towards the rock to be machined.<br>
If the drive element consists of a drive gear wheel geared on the outside, which is connected to the drum<br>
support, the direction of rotation of the tool spindles is the same as the one of the spindle drum. If the<br>
drive element consists of a drive gear wheel geared on the inside, the tool spindles driven from such a<br>
drive gear ring rotate in the opposite direction of the spindle drum.<br>
In order to provide the rotary drive for the spindle drum independent from the transmission gear drive<br>
for the tool spindles, a constructional embodiment has proven to be advantageous, in which the spindle<br>
drum comprises a reception bore for a drive shaft running coaxially to the drum axis, which drive shaft is<br>
rotatably supported in the reception bore and is coupled to the drive element for the tool spindle. The<br>
drive shaft is thus mounted rotatably concentrically in the spindle drum, which is not only particularly<br>
compact, but which also ensures a high stability of the construction. The spindle drum can comprise a<br>
closed housing with an approximately cup-shaped drum base and a housing lid, so that the drive element,<br>
that is, in particular the drive gear wheel, is received in the inside of the drum base and is connected to<br>
the drive shaft and is covered by the housing lid.<br>
The transmission drive for the tool spindles is preferably arranged in an encapsulated manner in the<br>
spindle drum. The machining tools with their respective tool spindles can be in an overhung position at<br>
the spindle and can project from the spindle drum at the face and/or at the circumference.<br>
So as to favour the axial driving-in of the device into the rock, it has been proved to be advantageous if<br>
the spindle drum is, additionally to the tool spindles which are arranged distributed over its<br>
circumference, provided with milling tools with a core milling cutter arranged in the inside of the pitch<br>
circle described by the tool spindles, which core milling cutter is preferably arranged with a small<br><br>
5<br>
eccentricity to the drum axis. With the help of the core milling cutter which is formed in a driveable<br>
manner, it can be ensured that the entire rock present in front of the face of the spindle drum will be<br>
milled during the axial feed motion of the device therein.<br>
In order to ensure a particularly stable reception of the tool spindles, the machining tools with their<br>
respective tool spindles are preferably mounted at the spindle drum by means of a two-point bearing. A<br>
fixed floating bearing can be provided for this, alternatively, an engaged bearing, in particular in the X-<br>
arrangement can be used, for example by means of taper roller bearings or the like.<br>
Especially in cases where machining tools with a comparatively large axial length are to be used, for<br>
example tools with long milling shanks, it is particularly advantageous if the spindle drum comprises an<br>
approximately plate-like bearing flange in the proximity of the drum support for the reception of the first<br>
bearings of the tool spindles and a support journal projecting concentrically to the drum axis, at which at<br>
least one support element for the reception of the second bearings of the tool spindles is arranged. The<br>
regions of the machining tools which machine the rock are then between the two bearings, so that a<br>
particularly sturdy support is achieved. With this embodiment of the invention it can further be<br>
convenient, that the support element or the support journal comprises a bearing journal arranged<br>
concentrically to the spindle drum axis for the additional support of the spindle drum. Thereby it is then<br>
possible to also mount the spindle drum itself by means of a two-point bearing, that is to additionally<br>
support it at the end which is turned away from the drum support, and therewith to avoid bending which<br>
can occur with long tools and an overhung bearing.<br>
The support element can consist of a lid flange arranged at the face of the support journal, which flange<br>
is provided with bearing receptions for the second bearing. The machining tools are then covered by the<br>
lid flange at their face and machine the rock only with individual tools which are arranged at their<br>
circumference and which project radially between the plate-like bearing flange and the lid flange of the<br>
spindle drum therefrom. It is also possible that at least two support elements are provided, which are<br>
arranged at different distances from the bearing flange and which respectively receive the second<br>
bearings of different tool spindles. With this arrangement, the second bearings of the tool spindles then<br>
have a distance from the face (free) end of the machining tools, which can then also be in engagement<br>
with the rock with their faces.<br>
So as to avoid damages of the device by overloading, it has proved to be convenient that the drive<br>
element is connected to the drum support via an overload clutch, which can for example be a spring-<br>
loaded friction clutch. The spring load acting on the clutch is preferably adjustable, so that the activation<br>
value at which the clutch is released and the drive element slips through at the drum support can be<br>
adjusted.<br>
The spindle drum can, at its rear side, which is turned away from the machining tools, be provided with a<br>
demountable covering cap sealed with regard to the drum support by means of a shaft seal, which cap<br><br>
6<br>
enables access to the transmission gear drive and other parts lying below, which have to be serviced or<br>
inspected occasionally.<br>
Generally, the tool spindle axes in the spindle drum will be aligned parallel to the drum axis. It is<br>
however also possible to arrange the tool spindle axes in an inclined manner relative to the drum axis,<br>
whereby the milling result can be improved further with some rocks or materials to be machined. In a<br>
further embodiment of the invention, every machining tool preferably comprises several individual tools<br>
arranged evenly over the circumference of the machining tool, and is mounted to the associated tool<br>
spindle using a detent coupling, whereby the number of possible lock positions of the detent coupling is<br>
adapted to the number at the machining tool so that these are in the same relative position to the tool<br>
spindle in every locked position. The detent coupling responds when the machining tool is blocked by<br>
the rock which it engages, so that the associated tool spindle which carries this tool can rotate further to<br>
the next lock position, into which the machining tool then locks again and rotates further. The machining<br>
tool thereby locks again in such a position where its relative position to the machining tools of adjacent<br>
tool spindles remains the same, that is, the originally adjusted phase shift or the offset of the machining<br>
tools of successive tool spindles remains after the response of the detent coupling and locking of the tool.<br>
The device according to invention and the method that can be effected thereby are particularly suitable<br>
for the removal of mineral extraction products as for example coal, ore rock or the like. The device can<br>
be used for this purpose as replacement for a well-known cutting head of a drum shearing machine or as<br>
cutting head of a selective cut or full cu heading machine. The device and the method can<br>
advantageously also be used for the machining of concreted or tarmacked surfaces or buildings, for<br>
example when milling tarmacked or concreted road surfaces, during demolition of concrete buildings or<br>
the like. It is often advantageous for the different applications if the device according to the invention is<br>
mounted to an adjustable arm and is engaged with this against the rock or the like to be machined. Use of<br>
the device according to the invention is also conceivable with small appliances, for example with hand-<br>
held plaster milling devices.<br>

The various embodiments of the device according to the invention shown in the drawings, which device<br>
is designated as 10 in its entirety, serve for the milling of rock, for example mineral extraction products<br>
such as coal or ore, or also for the processing of concrete, tarmac or other building materials, for example<br>
during the milling of road surfaces or the like. As far as the different embodiments of the device<br>
according to the invention conform in their constructional details, a repeated description of these<br>
recurring details with different embodiments shall be forgone. Rather, after the detailed description of the<br>
fundamental construction on the basis of fig. 1, essentially only the differences of the different<br>
embodiments will be explained.<br>
Referring to fig. 1, it can be seen that the device 10 according to the invention comprises a drum support<br>
11 for the mounting to a machine body (not shown) suitable therefore, for example an extension arm of a<br>
winning machine or a road milling machine. The drum support 11 comprises a central bearing reception<br>
12, in which a spindle drum 13 is pivoted by means of two taper roller bearings 15 adjusted in a back-to-<br>
back arrangement. The bearing journal 14 projects with its rear end 16 from the bearing reception 12 of<br>
the drum support 11 rearwardly and supports a drive wheel 17 there which is coupled to a rotary drive for<br>
the rotation of the spindle drum, not shown in detail.<br><br>
8<br>
The bearing journal 14 changes into a circular plate-like bearing flange 18 of the spindle drum at its other<br>
end opposite the drive wheel 17, which journal comprises several, in the example of the embodiment six,<br>
evenly distributed drum chambers 20 on a pitch circle 19 near its outer circumference. The drum<br>
chambers 20 each receive a bearing bush 21 with a tool spindle 22 mounted rotatably therein, whereby<br>
the bearing bushes with the tool spindles mounted therein like a cartridge are inserted into their<br>
respective drum chamber 20 in an exchangeable manner and are locked in the inserted state by means of<br>
fixing screws 23. At their rear end, with which the tool spindles project rearwardly from the bearing<br>
flange 18 of the spindle drum, they are provided with driven gear wheels 24 which mesh with a driving<br>
gear wheel 25, which is secured firmly to the drum support 11 with screws 27 at a gear wheel reception<br>
26 provided for this. One can see in the first embodiment shown in fig. 1, that the gearings of the driven<br>
gear wheels 24 of the tool spindles 22 roll off at the drive gear wheel 25 firmly mounted to the drum<br>
support 11, when the spindle drum 13 is rotated by the rotary drive effective at the drive wheel 17, so<br>
that the tool spindles are also rotated hereby. With this design, there exists a fixed gear transmission ratio<br>
between the rotatably driven spindle drum 13 and the tool spindles synchronously driven by the gear<br>
drive 24, 25 pivoted therein. . With a gear transmission ratio of for example 10:1, the tool spindles rotate<br>
with 500 rpm when the spindle drum is driven with 50 rpm. The gear transmission ratio can be changed<br>
by a change of the diameters of the drive gear wheels and of the driven gear wheel or a change of the<br>
number of teeth. To this end, the drive gear wheel 25 can be disassembled and can be replaced by for<br>
example by a smaller gear wheel, while also other tool spindles with correspondingly larger drive gear<br>
wheels are inserted at the same time.<br>
For the attachment of the entire device 10 to a machine frame (not shown) provided for this, as for<br>
example an arm of a drum shearing machine or a road milling machine, mounting holes 28 for fixing<br>
screws are provided at the drum support 11, which screws are threaded through access holes 29 provided<br>
in the bearing flange 18 of the spindle drum and can be screwed into threaded bores at the machine frame<br>
aligned with the mounting holes 28 by means of a suitable tool as for example an alien key. The entire<br>
device can be quickly installed at the machine frame without disassembly of any parts of the device.<br>
In fig. IA it can easily be seen that the bearing flange 18 of the spindle drum 13 is provided with a<br>
housing lid 30 at its rear side, which is screwed to the bearing flange 18 and together with this forms a<br>
closed housing 31 for the transmission gear drive 24, 25 of the tool spindles. In order to prevent an<br>
ingress of humidity or dirt into the housing 31, the housing lid 30 is provided with a seal 32 at its radial<br>
inner edge, with which the sealing with regard to the drum support is effected.<br>
The front ends of the tool spindles projecting from the free side of the spindle drum form cone seat<br>
receptions 33 for machining tools, different designs of which being shown in fig. 2 to 14. All these<br>
different designs of the machining tools can also be used with the embodiment of the design according to<br>
the invention according to fig. 1, as will be described in detail in the following.<br><br>
9<br>
With the embodiment of the invention shown in fig. 2, it is possible to adjust the number of revolutions<br>
and the direction of rotation of the individual tool spindles independently of the number of revolutions<br>
and the direction of rotation of the spindle drum. For this, the spindle drum 13 comprises a rotary drive,<br>
which is decoupled from the transmission gear drive of the tool spindles. This is solved constructional ly<br>
in that the spindle drum 13 comprises a reception bore 35 for a drive shaft 36 running coaxially to the<br>
drum axis 34, which shaft is mounted in the reception bore in a rotary manner with two cylinder roller<br>
bearings 37. The front bearing flange 18 of the spindle drum forms a closed housing 31 with an<br>
approximately cup-shaped drum base 38 and a housing lid 30, and the drive gear wheel 25 of the<br>
transmission gear drive for the tool spindles is irrotationally mounted on the drive shaft 36 and is<br>
received in the housing 31 between the drum base 38 and the housing lid 30. There it meshes with the<br>
driven gear wheels 24 of the tool spindles 22.<br>
The drive shaft is provided with a front gear wheel 39 at its rear end, which can be coupled to a spindle<br>
drive motor (not shown), so as to rotate the drive shaft 36 and thus the drive gear wheel 25 mounted<br>
thereon on the inside of the spindle drum and to hereby effect the rotary drive of the tool spindles, so that<br>
the number of revolutions of the tool spindles can be adjusted independently of the number of<br>
revolutions of the spindle drum.<br>
In the embodiment according to fig. 2, the tool spindles are not received in bearing bushes and inserted<br>
cartridge-like in drum chambers at the spindle drum, but the individual shafts are mounted directly in the<br>
spindle drum, whereas the rear of respectively two cone roller bearings is arranged in the drum base and<br>
the front bearing pointing to the machining side in the housing lid 30. The sealing of the spindle drum in<br>
relation to the drum support 11 is effected by means of a shaft seal ring 40 in this example of the<br>
embodiment, which is arranged in the transition region of the bearing flange 18 to the bearing journal 14.<br>
With the example of an embodiment according to fig. 2, chisel rings 42 with respectively six individual<br>
tools 43 in the form of impact chisels mounted thereon are used as machining tools 41, whereas the<br>
arrangement is such that the sphere of activity 45 defined by the impact tips 44 of the individual tools 43<br>
projects with a relatively small segment over the outer circumference 46 of the spindle drum, so that,<br>
with the example of an embodiment shown, no more than two individual tools 43 project radially over<br>
the outer circumference 46 of the spindle drum at the same time. The circle line 4 describing the<br>
individual spheres of activity 45 of the six machining tools 41 defines the milling diameter of the device<br>
in the rock, that is, the range within which the machining tools machine the rock with their individual<br>
tools. It can be seen that no more than 1/3 of all individual tools are engaged at the milling line 47 in the<br>
rock at a respective time, that is, every tool only breaks out rock on 1/3 of the path covered by a rotation<br>
of the tool spindle and is subjected to the loads created thereby.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the device according to fig. 2, as provided with machining tools 41 in the form of conical,<br>
two-stage chisel milling cutters 48, which respectively comprise six individual tools 43 at axially<br>
successively arranged mounting circles. The chisel milling cutters mill through the rock 49 in two stages<br><br>
10<br>
during the operation of the device, so that the radially external machining tools impact the rock 49 in a<br>
first sphere of activity 46a closer to the device, and the radially inner tools in a second sphere of activity<br>
46b which establishes deeper in the rock. It can easily be seen that, by the overlapping of the rotation of<br>
the spindle drum 13 and the rotation of the tool spindle, the individual tools 43 are actually engaged with<br>
the rock only for a short time, whereby the wear of the tools is considerably reduced in a particularly<br>
advantageous manner compared to known cutting drums or the like. Instead of an arrangement in two<br>
stages, an arrangement in three or more stages can of course also be selected for the individual tools, in<br>
order to remove the rock or another material to be milled in one operation by a direction-free, lateral<br>
method of the device in an undercutting manner. An axial driving-in of the device into the rock is<br>
generally possible without any problem.<br>
With embodiment shown in fig. 4, the machining tools are end milling cutters 50, which comprise a<br>
support shaft 51 connected rigidly to the respective tool spindle 22, at the circumference of which are<br>
arranged individual tools 43, which can for example consist of straight shank chisels received in suitable<br>
tool holders. The individual tools are preferably arranged in a spiral form over the length of the support<br>
shaft 51 in this embodiment, while the arrangement can also take place in several spirals. With this<br>
arrangement, it is easily possible to drive axially into the material to be cut, and subsequently to remove<br>
the material in the entire driven depth or length of the shaft milling cutters by a direction-free, lateral<br>
method of the device. So as to ease the cutting, that is, the driving-in in the axial direction, it is possible<br>
to taper the diameter of the tools at least at their front region towards the face in the direction of the rock.<br>
In fig. 5, the preferred mode of operation which can be achieved with the device according to the<br>
invention can be seen in a particularly illustrative manner. While the spindle drum rotates with a first<br>
rotation speed in the direction of arrow A, for example with 50 rpm, the individual tool spindles rotate<br>
synchronously with a rotation speed corresponding to the chosen gear reduction, that is, with the<br>
embodiments of the device according to fig. 1, 3 and 4, in the same direction of rotation as the spindle<br>
drum. With an assumed gear transmission ratio of 1: 10, the rotation speed of the tool spindles is thus<br>
500 rpm. It can be seen that the first machining tool 41A, which impacts the rock 49 to be milled,<br>
impacts recesses 52 into the rock 49 with its four individual tools 43 with a certain rhythm or distance.<br>
The following machining tool 41B drives rock out between the recesses 52, whereby a wave profile 54 is<br>
formed in the rock at the approximately semicircular milling edge 53. The machining tools 41C and 41D<br>
following now successively remove the raised tips 55 in the wave profile, shown in a hatched<br>
representation, whereby the milling edge is smoothed as far as possible, and with the further feed of the<br>
spindle drum in the direction of the arrow 56, the described procedure with the machining tools 41E to<br>
41H can repeat itself. Alternatively, the tools 41E-H can also even be used for a further smoothing of the<br>
milling edge 53 in the rock. On the other hand, it is also possible, depending on the chosen gear<br>
reduction ratio and number of the individual tools 43 at the machining tools, that a first machining tool,<br>
for example tool 41 A, pre-cuts, and that the regions remaining between the recesses 52 are knocked off<br>
with the following tool, and that the tool following in the circumferential direction of the drum then<br><br>
11<br>
again drives out new recesses 52 as the first tool and that the following tool mills the regions remaining<br>
therebetween. The representation according to fig. 5 is selected as if the tools 41A-D drive approximately<br>
simultaneously into the rock 49 to be cut, which is normally not the case in practice. It has proven to be<br>
particularly advantageous in experiments, if the tools - in the shown case the machining tools 4IA-H - are<br>
constructed in such a manner, that, with the shown engagement of 180° (full cut) only one individual tool<br>
of all (five) effective machining tools is in engagement with the rock on the 180° region of the milling<br>
edge 53, as then the entire pressing force or feeding force exerted on the spindle drum by the device can<br>
be used by only one individual tool, and not, as was usual up to now, is distributed simultaneously on<br>
several bits. The machining tools are positioned and adjusted in the preferred form so that the tools<br>
following in each case do not drive exactly into the outline produced by the preceding tools at the rock,<br>
but in an offset manner.<br>
A further embodiment of the device according to the invention is shown in fig. 6. This embodiment is<br>
based on the device according to fig. 1 and differs from this by the mounting of the drive gear wheel 25,<br>
at which the driven gear wheels 24 of the tool spindles roll off. In the embodiment according to fig. 6, the<br>
drive gear wheel 25 is connected to the drum support 11 via an overload clutch 57, which effects a<br>
friction-locked connection between the drum support 11 and the drive gear wheel 25 via clutch linings<br>
58. The activation moment where the overload clutch operates and the drive gear wheel begins to slip<br>
through with regard to the drum support can be adjusted. For this, an adjustment ring 59 can be engaged<br>
against the clutch package formed by the clutch linings and the intermediate part of the drive gear wheel<br>
25 via a thread 60, in order to preload a plate spring 61 which then acts thereon with a constant spring<br>
load over the circumference of the clutch. With this arrangement, it is ensured that the device is not<br>
damaged when a tool driving into the rock blocks, as in such a case, the overload clutch responds and<br>
separates all machining tools from the common drive of the spindle drum and the tools until the blocking<br>
of the concerned individual tool ceases. The synchronisation of the individual machining tools with one<br>
another still remains , as these all stay in engagement with the driven gear wheel during the activation of<br>
the clutch.<br>
The embodiment of the device according to the invention shown in fig. 7 also uses the overload clutch,<br>
which is designed exactly as with the embodiment according to fig. 7. In the embodiment shown in fig.<br>
7, however, there is selected a separate drive from the spindle drum drive for the tool spindles. For this, a<br>
drive ring 62 is mounted in a rotary manner at the drum support 11 at a front section 11 a, which ring<br>
supports the drive gear wheel mounted via the overload clutch 57 at its outer circumference. The drive<br>
ring is provided with an internal gearing 63 at it axial rear region, into which gearing engages a drive<br>
pinion (not shown) of a common tool drive, so as to effect the rotation of the drive ring on the drum body<br>
11, and to drive the tool spindles hereby.<br>
Fig. 8 again shows the device according to fig. 1, this time with machining tools in the form of cutting<br>
plates 64, which essentially consist of an approximately plate-shaped support 65 and respectively four<br>
cutting discs 66 arranged evenly over the circumference of the support 65, which discs are rotatably<br><br>
12<br>
mounted in the support 65. The arrangement is such that the axes of rotation of the discs 66 do not run<br>
parallel to the axis of rotation of the support 65 mounted irrotationally on the associated tool spindle, but<br>
are inclined inwardly towards the rock, so that during the cut of the cutting discs into the rock 49 the<br>
faces of the cutting discs do not come into contact with the rock, but that it is ensured that the cutting<br>
discs 66 actually only machine the rock with their rotating cutting edge 67. By the rotary mounting of the<br>
cutting discs in the support of the cutting plates it is ensured that the cutting discs can roll off in the rock<br>
along their cutting edge at the generated milling edge 53. In a preferred further development of this<br>
embodiment, not shown, the individual cutting discs can be coupled to one another via a suitable<br>
coupling tool as for example a belt transmission or a gear wheel transmission present in the inside of the<br>
support, whereby it is ensured that, during the rotation of the tool spindle, an individual tool (cutting<br>
disc) coming into engagement with the rock already comprises the same circumferential speed, as a<br>
preceding individual tool leaving the engagement, so that a possible damage does not occur here by the<br>
sudden acceleration of the cutting disc during contact with the surrounding rock. The machining tools<br>
which are used in the embodiment according to fig. 8 are particularly suitably for somewhat softer rocks<br>
to be machined, for example during the production of coal.<br>
With the embodiment shown in fig. 9, the spindle axes 68 of the tool spindles 22 are not aligned parallel<br>
to the drum axis 34 of the spindle drum 13, but are inclined inwardly in the direction of the rock. For<br>
this, the bearing bushes 21 are bored diagonally for the reception of the tool spindles mounted therein<br>
and the drive gear wheel 25 is a formed as a bevel gear, at which the driven gear wheels 24 of the<br>
diagonal tool spindles formed at the tool spindles roll off.<br>
With the embodiment of the device according to the invention according to fig. 10, the tool spindles 22<br>
are arranged on two different pitch circles 19a, 19b, as can easily be seen in fig. 10. The drive of the first<br>
group 69 of tool spindles on the first, outer pitch circle 19a and of the second group of 70 of tool spindles<br>
on the inner pitch circle 19b takes place through a common drive element in the form of a stepped drive<br>
gear wheel 25, which comprises a first gear ring of larger diameter 25a for the tool spindles of the first<br>
group lying outside and a second gear ring 25b with smaller diameter, which drives the tool spindles of<br>
the second group 70 which lie radially somewhat further inside. In all other respects, the structure of the<br>
embodiment according to fig. 10 corresponds to the one used with fig. 1.<br>
With the embodiments of the device according to the invention described up to now with a common<br>
drive for the spindle drum and the tool spindles mounted rotatably therein, the direction of rotation of the<br>
spindle drum and the tool spindles was the same. Fig. 11 now shows an embodiment where the tool<br>
spindles rotate against the direction of rotation of the spindle drum 13. For this, the drive element for the<br>
tool spindles consists of a drive gear ring 71 geared on the inside, which is centrally fastened to the drum<br>
support 11 and in which engage the tool spindles with their driven gear wheels 24, as can be seen in the<br>
drawing.<br><br>
13<br>
With the embodiments shown in fig. 12 and 13, shaft milling cutters with a comparatively long support<br>
shaft 51 are used as machining tools 41, which cannot, due to the large axial length of the tools, be<br>
overhung alone like the embodiments shown so far. Accordingly, with the embodiments according to fig.<br>
12	and fig. 13, the machining tools are mounted at the spindle drum with their respective tool spindles by<br>
means of a two-point mounting. The spindle drum comprises a plate-like bearing flange 18 in the<br>
proximity of the drum support 11 for the reception of the first bearings of the tool spindle for this, which<br>
form the fixed bearing for the two-point bearing with the shown embodiment and which is executed in<br>
the form of a mounted bearing in a back-to-back arrangement with cone roller bearings. The spindle<br>
drum further comprises a projecting support journal 72 arranged concentrically to the drum axis 34<br>
which supports a support element 73 for the reception of the second bearings 74 of the machining tools<br>
arranged on the tool spindles near its free end. With embodiments according to fig. 12 and fig. 13, the<br>
second bearings at the support element form the floating bearing for the fixed floating bearing of the<br>
machining tools. They consist of cylinder roller bearings, which are particularly suitable for the reception<br>
of large radial forces. With the embodiment according to fig. 12, the support element consists of a lid<br>
flange 75 arranged at the face of the support journal 72, which flange is provided with bearing receptions<br>
76 for the cylinder roller bearings 74. This embodiment of the two-point bearing for the machining tools<br>
is particularly stable, but it is not suitable for an axial driving of the tools into the rock to be machined, as<br>
the machining tools are not effective at the face, by being covered by the lid flange 75. This disadvantage<br>
is avoided with the embodiment according to fig. 13, where two support elements 73a. 73b are provided,<br>
which support respectively every second machining tool at the circumference of the spindle drum in a<br>
star-shaped manner. The two support elements 73a, 73b are arranged with different distances s, S from<br>
the bearing flange 18 for this, and support the respective second bearings of different tool spindles in<br>
star-shaped projecting arms 77. So that the spindle drum in the embodiment according to fig. 12 or fig.<br>
13	cannot sag due to the forces acting on the machining tools, the lid flange 75 or the support journal 72<br>
can be provided with a bearing journal 86 arranged concentrically to the spindle drum axis 34, shown<br>
with dash-dot lines in the drawings for the additional support of the spindle drum by means of a bearing<br>
(not shown), which is for example present in the same machine frame as the drum support at this<br>
opposite side.<br>
Finally, with the embodiment shown in fig. 14, the spindle drum 13 is, additionally to the tool spindles<br>
22, which are distributed evenly over its circumference with milling tools 41 arranged thereon, provided<br>
with a core milling device 78 arranged on the inside of the pitch circle 19 described by the tool spindles,<br>
which milling device is arranged with a small eccentricity e to the drum axis 34, and which is driven<br>
opposite to the direction of rotation of the tool spindles. The core milling device thereby consists of a<br>
reception cartridge 79, on the inside of which is mounted a milling shaft 80 in a rotary manner, which<br>
carries a milling head 81 at its front end pointing towards the rock. At its rear end, which projects from<br>
the reception cartridge 79, the milling shaft is provided with a front gear wheel 82 which is flanged<br>
thereon. The reception cartridge 79 with the shaft mounted therein is inserted in a milling cutter reception<br>
provided at the bearing flange 18 of the spindle drum 13 and is irrotationally fixed. In the mounted<br><br>
14<br>
condition, the front wheel 82 meshes with an internally geared milling cutter drive gear ring 83, which is<br>
firmly mounted to the drum support 11 and which engages in a circumferential groove 84 provided at the<br>
rear side of the bearing flange of the spindle drum. The core milling cutter is thereby driven in the<br>
opposite rotary direction to the direction of rotation of the spindle drum and favours in particular during<br>
the axial driving-in of the tool into the rock the excavation of the material possibly remaining in the<br>
central area 85 described by the tool spindles.<br>
The invention is not limited to the shown and described examples of embodiments, but different changes<br>
and additions are feasible, without leaving the scope of the invention. It is for example possible to let the<br>
tool spindles of a first group of tools and the tool spindles of a second group of tools rotate in opposite<br>
directions, in particular when the tools of the first group are provided on a different pitch circle to those<br>
of the second group. The details shown and described on the basis of the individual embodiments can be<br>
combined with one another in most diverse ways, which can be noted by the expert without special<br>
difficulties. With the selection of suitable machining tools it is easily possible, to use the device<br>
according to the invention also for the machining of other materials than rock or coal, for example for the<br>
machining of metal, wood or plastics.<br><br>
