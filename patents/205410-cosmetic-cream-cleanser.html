COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section  10)<br>
COSMETIC CREAM CLEANSER<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House,   165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra,  India<br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
■1 8 MAY 2004<br><br>
COSMETIC CREAM CLEANSER<br>
The invention concerns a cosmetic cream for cleansing skin and having excellent skinfeel properties.<br>
Cream type cosmetic cleansers are difficult to formulate. The term "cream" requires both opacity and a certain thickness.  Consumers associate the attributes of opacity and thickness with creamy products.  Chemicals imparting these properties can interfere with lathering, phase stability on storage and skinfeel.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,336,497 (Guerrero et al.) discloses cosmetic compositions functioning to remove soil from body surfaces. A combination of silicone copolyol sulfosuccinate and an amphoteric surfactant are employed to achieve a cleaning result.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,236,710 (Guerrero et al.) is a related disclosure reporting on a combination of an anionic sulfosuccinate and an emulsifying polyacrylate.  More particularly the patent refers to a silicone copolyol<br>
sulfosuccinate and an  <br>
crosspolymer.<br>
U.S. Patent 6,113,892 (Newell et al.) discloses compositions delivering both a cleansing action and conditioning. Products disclosed include components which must be selected from a high foaming anionic surfactant, a polymeric cationic conditioning agent, a silicone copolyol sulfosuccinate, an emollient and water.<br>
2<br><br>
Although there have been some significant advances in this art, improvements are still necessary to achieve creamy products with thickness and the proper aesthetics.<br>
Accordingly, it is an advantage of the present invention to provide a cosmetic cream cleanser which delivers a dense luxurious foam.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is to provide a cosmetic cream cleanser which is opaque and thick with nevertheless good lather characteristics.<br>
These and other advantages of the present will become wo-.  : readily apparent from consideration of the summary and detailed description which follows.<br>
A cosmetic cream cleanser composition is provided which includes:<br>
(i)   from 0.1 to 20% of a silicate;<br>
(ii)  from 0.001 to 2% of a crosslinked<br>
carboxyvinyl polymer other than a long<br>
chain <br>
methacrylate containing polymer;<br>
(iii) from 0.01 to 40% of a silicone copolyo] sulfosuccinate; and<br>
(iv)  a cosmetically acceptable carrier;<br>
wherein the composition has a viscosity ranging from 20,000 to 500,000 cp.<br>
^3<br><br>
Now it has been discovered that a combination of a silicate, a crosslinked carboxyvinyl polymer and a silicone copolyol sulfosuccinate results in a cream cleansing composition with highly desirable characteristics.  These include excellent lather, good storage stability and a rich skinfeel.<br>
A first element of the present invention is that of a silicate.  Illustrative of this category are aluminum magnesium silicate, magnesium silicate, aluminum silicate, chemically modified magnesium aluminum silicate, smectite clay, bentonites, hectorites, pyrogenic colloidal silica, organically modified montmorillonite clay, hydrated aluminum silicate, fumed silica, barium silicate, calcium silicate, alumina, zeolite and combinations thereof.  Particularly preferred is aluminum magnesium silicate available commercially under the trademarks of Gel White and Veegum.<br>
Advantageously, the silicates will be finally divided powders having an average particle size ranging from 0.0001 micron to 50 micron, preferably from 0.01 micron to 10 micron, more preferably from 0.1 to 1.5 micron.  Amounts of the silicate may range from 0.1 to 20%, preferably from 0.5 to 10%, optimally from 1 to 5% by weight of the composition.<br>
A second element of the present invention is that of a crosslinked carboxyvinyl polymer other than a long chain<br>
  alkyl acrylate or methacrylate containing polymer.<br>
Illustrative are acrylic acid/ethyl acrylate copolymers and<br>
the carboxyvinyl polymers sold under the Carbopol<br>
trademark.  The latter consists essentially of a colloidally water-soluble polyalkyenyl polyether crosslinked polymer of<br>
A<br><br>
acrylic acid crosslinked with from 0.75% to 2.00% of a crosslinking agent such as a polyallyl sucrose or polyallyl pentaerythritol.  Specific commercial examples include<br>
Carbopol® 934, Carbopol® 940, Carbopol® 950, Carbopol® 951, Carbopol® 980, Carbopol® 981 and Carbopol® 1342.<br>
Particularly useful in Carbopol  934, a water-soluble<br>
polymer of acrylic acid crosslinked with about 1% of a polyallyl ether of sucrose having an average of about 5.8 allyl groups for each sucrose molecule.  These materials are described in U.S. Patent 2,798,053 (Brown) herein incorporated by reference.  Long chain fatty group substituted polymeric ester of acrylic or methacrylic acid<br>
such as Pemulen® with CTFA name of acrylates/C10-30 alkyl<br>
acrylate crosspolymer are outside the scope of this invention.  Amounts of the polymer may range from about 0.001 to about 2%, preferably from about 0.005 to about 1%, optimally from about 0.01 to about 0.1% by weight of the composition.<br>
Another important element of the present invention is that of a silicone copolyol sulfosuccinate.<br>
The preferred silicone copolyol sulfosuccinate is of the formula:<br>
5<br><br><br>
wherein R is an alkylene oxide polymer; M is a cation selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, ammonium and alkanolammonium ions, x and y range in value so as to produce a compound with an equivalent weight between 70 0 and 160 0 grams. R may be further defined as a polymer of ethylene or propylene oxide in the following forms:<br><br><br><br>
wherein a and b may independently range in value from 0 to 30.<br>
A related preferred silicone copolyol sulfosuccinate structure according to the present invention is represented by the formula:<br><br>
wherein X is an amine group obtained from alcohol amines, ethoxylates or propoxylates, preferably derived from the group consisting of monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, monoisopropanolamine or diglycolamine.<br>
7<br><br><br>
wherein X is an amine group as described above and obtained from sulfite salts containing the amine group.<br>
The silicone copolyol sulfosuccinates of the present invention are generally prepared by reacting the ethoxylated polyether side chains of dimethicone copolyol with maleic anhydride to form a monoester and then converting the monoester to sulfosuccinate by sulfonation of the double bond with a metallic sulfite.  Metallic sulfite and amine salts may also be used either alone or in combination for sulfonation of the double bond.  The resulting sulfosuccinate is a silicone-based surfactant which exhibits highly improved mildness and foam stabilizing properties.<br>
9<br><br>
Commercially, the silicone copolyol sulfosuccinates are available from the Mclntyre Chemical Company under the trademark of Mackanate DC-30   and DC-30A.<br>

Sample A is reflective of the present invention.  This formula had a satisfactory viscosity with nice skin feel, good lather and good storage stability.  Sample B included<br>
Gel White® (silicate) and Carbopol® 980 (crosslinked<br>
carboxyvinyl polymer) but omitted the dimethicone copolycl sulfosuccinate.  Although Sample B exhibited the desired high viscosity, the feel was rather gritty in a manner unacceptable to most consumers.  Sample C combined the C1<br>
White  with the dimethicone copolyol sulfosuccinate but<br>
removed Carbopol  980.  The result was a product of<br>
borderline viscosity, although having nice skinfeel and lather.  Sample C was not stable and separated within two<br>
weeks of oven storage at 50°C.  Sample D omitted both Ge..<br>
White  and Carbopol  980.  The result was an extremely .<br>
viscosity product that was not stable separating within<br>
three days.  Sample E lacked Gel White  but did include<br>
Carbopol  980 and dimethicone copolyol sulfosuccinate.<br>
Viscosity was found to be too low and the formula unstai<br>
separating within three davs of storage at 50°C.  Sample <br>
omitted both Gel White  and Carbopol  980.  Long term<br>
stability was inadequate; separation occurred within 4 <br>
at 50°C.  Sample G is identical to Sample A except that<br>
Pemulen  repla es Carbopol .  Long term stability of Sa<br>
G was inadequate.  Evident from this study is that all components are necessary for the present invention.<br>
