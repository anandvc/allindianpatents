				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a composition and more particularly to a process for preparation of the composition useful for treatment in chronic respiratory disorders such as cold, cough, allergic, asthma, migraine, piles, sinusitis, throat infection, fungi, bacteria and virus, seasonal allergic rhinitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, whooping cough etc. The said composition is non-alcoholic and non-sedative in nature.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
During the last two decades there has been an increased occurrence of respiratory disorders amongst the children and the adults. The main reason for these disorders are smoke, dust, vehicular/ industrial pollution and humidity.<br>
The houses and apartment buildings harbor their own allergens. While almost anything in dust can trigger an allergic reaction, the most important indoor allergens are pet dander, molds, cockroaches, and dust mites. Unlike seasonal allergies, indoor allergies may last all year long. They tend to be at their worst in the late summer, when dust mites, molds, and other insects are all at their peaks. The symptoms can actually be worse in the winter, though, when the windows are closed and we are shut in with the allergens. An allergic reaction is a reaction of the immune system to a foreign "invader," a substance that is not native to your body. Exposure to this invader, an allergen, triggers the reaction. It is the effects of the mediators on cells and tissues that cause the symptoms of an allergic reaction. When house dust particles come to rest in the linings of the eyes, nose, or airway of a susceptible person, an allergic reaction can occur. The usual symptoms of indoor allergic reactions are those of many other allergic reactions: Itchy stuffy nose, clear nasal discharge, Itchy watery swollen bloodshot eyes, Sneezing, Scratchy swollen throat.<br>
Several studies have indicated that the prevalence rate of Asthma is increasing in many regions while the morbidity rate remains high. At present, the preventive therapy for asthma is mainly based on systemic corticosteroids administered by inhalation and oral route. The significant adverse effects were found with long-term use of hormone.<br>
Similarly in Sinusitis, any infection of the nasal passages that cause it to swell can affect the opening to the sinuses. If the ostium (opening) is blocked, air and mucous secretions are collected and cause pressure on the sinus cavity walls. This is the main reason why we have pain during sinusitis. Sinusitis, in simple terms, means an inflammatory process in the nasal sinuses due to viral, bacterial, and fungal infections or allergic reactions. Sinuses are paired hollow cavities or air spaces in the head. They are within the bones of the skull that surround the nasal passage, hence they are also referred to as para nasal sinuses.<br>
Similarly in case of migraines, contrary to public perception, migraine is not just a king-size regular headache. In fact, the cause of migraine pain is the opposite of ordinary tension headaches. Migraine is a neurological disorder. Migraine occurs when blood vessels in the head contract (which is the cause of tension headache pain) which occurs<br><br>
during the aura phase of the headache. Some medical professionals think there may be some swelling of the meninges (the thin layer of tissue that covers the brain) involved, Migraineurs may have an insufficiency of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which can make them particularly vulnerable to an attack if it gets too low. Serotonin is also involved in regulating the digestive system, and migraine sufferers may find themselves prone to digestive difficulties.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,193,995 describes herbal mixture for the treatment of nasal congestion that comprises of plurality of herbs thoroughly mixed together and combined with an adhesive. This type of herbal bandage made of a mixture of white pepper, dried ginger, rhizome and cinnamon twig powder with adhesive. The present invention differs from the above patent because the patent abstract is a topical dosage form and it is for the treatment of nasal congestion where as present invention is an oral syrup formulation for treating cough from different etiologies and related symptoms.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,287,567 describes a method of making an herbal drink and an apparatus developed for relieving symptoms of fatigue, congestion, fever and asthma. The drink is formed by straining water through a combination of equal portions of rosehip, goldenseai, comfrey leaf, bee pollen, spearmint, chickweed, comfrey root chamomile flower, catnip, mullein, pennyroyal, eucalyptus, and licorice root. The therapy does not address severe conditions such as bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchitis, and other respiratory disorders and also the product is not cost-effective since it involves special apparatus for administration of the medicament.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6,197,306 describes herbal composition mainly for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and respiratory disorders and a process for preparing the same. The composition comprises of Bryonia, Ipecacuanha, Drosera, and Antimony Potassium Tartrate. The product preparation involves use of pharmaceutically hazardous organic solvents for extraction process.<br>
Thus there is a need to provide a composition having an improved therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of various types of cough and respiratory disorders.<br>
In view of forgoing shortcomings inherent in the known types of herbal compositions as mentioned in the prior art, there is a need to provide a composition having an improved therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of various types of cough and respiratory disorders wherein the same can be utilized for relieving cough from different etiology and also related symptoms.<br>
There is a further is a need to provide a composition, which is devoid of use of pharmaceutically unacceptable organic solvents and which does not contain codeine or any other sedative agent which causes side effects like dizziness, delirium, etc. Still further, there is a need to provide a composition which does not freeze, at subzero temperatures thus preserving the medicinal properties of the herbs and thereby making it more efficacious.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus according to the present invention there is provided a process for preparation of a composition having an improved therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of various types of cough and respiratory disorders and which is devoid of use of pharmaceutically unacceptable organic solvents and which does not contain codeine or any other sedative agent which causes side effects like dizziness, delirium, etc.<br>
