REMOTE CONTROL LOCK OPERATION SYSTEM FOR VEHICLES<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS The present application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. ยง119 to Japanese Patent Application Nos. 2001-204744 and 2001-204743, filed on July 5, 2001, the entire contents thereof are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention	.<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a remote control lock operation system for vehicles comprising a hand-held remote control transmitter, a. receiver capable of receiving a signal transmitted by the transmitter, a control unit for determining whether or not the signal received by the receiver is acceptable and then operating and controlling the lock actuator based on the received signal when it is acceptable. The inventioij also relates to a system and method for providing an emergency, operation of the lock control system even when the hand-held remote control transmitter has been lost.<br>
Description of Background Art [0002] In four-wheeled vehicles of recent years, a remote control operation system<br>
"using an infared signal for locking and unlocking the door locking mechanism	without	<br>
using the key is widely employed.	<br>
[0003] On the other hand, in light vehicles such as the conventional motorcycles, and scooters, various mechanical locking mechanisms (for example,, a main stand locking mechanism, a handle locking mechanism, and so on) are provided in right positions for mechanically disabling traveling of the vehicles for prevention of theft or tampering. These mechanical locking mechanisms are adapted, to be locked and.unlocked<br>
2<br><br><br><br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 0505-1052P<br>
arbitrarily by the user by directly operating the lock operation portion provided on the<br>
vehicle body with the key,<br>
[0004] In order to enable the mechanical locking mechanism as described above to be<br>
unlocked by the remote control lock operation system using the infrared signal,<br>
without using the key, it is possible to have a remote control lock operation system for<br>
mechanical locking mechanism by combining the transmitter, the receiver, the lock<br>
actuator for driving the mechanical locking mechanism, and the control unit with the<br>
mechanical locking mechanism.<br>
[0005} However, a remote control lock operation system thus constructed, can be<br>
unlocked easily, by simply connecting the battery power source to the wiring section<br>
leading to the lock actuator. As such, a vehicle so equipped can be readily stolen.<br>
Moreover, with this configuration the total number of the components of the system is<br>
large, and thus the system becomes complex, which may result an increase in costs and<br>
weight.<br>
(0006J Another problem exists in the case where the user has lost the remote control<br>
transmitter, or for some other reason is not available. If this occurs, the infrared signal<br>
that corresponds to the prescribed identification data of the system cannot be<br>
transmitted. Thus, the lock actuator cannot be operated and controlled (that is, locked<br>
and unlocked) without using a key.<br>
SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION [0007] The present invention is proposed considering the above circumstances. It is an object of the present invention to provide a simple system and method for enabling and disabling the mechanical locking mechanism for a vehicle by means of a hand-held remote control transmitter.<br>
[0008] In addition, it is an object of the present invention to provide a mobile communication terminal system and a method for emergency operation of the infrared remote control lock system, even when the remote control transmitter has been lost, or for some reason is not available.<br>
[0009] In order to achieve'the aforementioned object, the present invention provides a remote control lock operation system for vehicles comprising a hand-held transmitter,<br><br>
3<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 0505-1052P<br>
a receiver capable of receiving the signal transmitted by the transmitter, a mechanical locking mechanism for mechanically disabling travel of the vehicle, a lock actuator capable of at least unlocking the mechanical locking mechanism, and a control unit for determining whether or not the signal received by the receiver is acceptable, and operating and controlling the lock actuator based on the received signal when the signal is acceptable. The receiver, the mechanical'locking mechanism, the lock actuator and the control unit thereof, and the wiring section connecting the lock actuator and the receiver to the control unit are provided in a common module housing, and are mounted to the vehicle body via the housing.<br>
[0010] Also, since the mechanical locking mechanism, the receiver, and the lock actuator, the control unit, and the interconnecting wiring section are integrated and united together in the common module housing, the total number of the components is small. Thus, it is easy to handle and to install on the vehicle body. As a consequence, the system may be reduced in size, weight, and cost. In addition, modification of the portion on the vehicle body on which the system is to be mounted may be minimized. Further, since the wiring section leading to the lock actuator can be hidden and protected in the module housing and not to be exposed toward the outside, it is possible to prevent an unauthorized person from unlocking and stealing the vehicle by simply connecting the wiring section directly to the buttery power source, or changing connection thereof.<br>
[0011] The invention also provides a drive enable signal generating means controlled by the control unit based on the signal received by the receiver, and which is capable of generating a drive enable signal for enabling actuation or operation of the engine. The drive enable signal generating means is mounted in the module housing together with the wiring section for connecting the means to the control unit. Accordingly, in the unlikely event that the main power source is turned on by an unauthorized person, the engine cannot be started unless the drive enable signal generating means in the module housing generates a drive enable signal based on the regular signal received by the receiver,<br>
[0012] Further, in the invention, a part of a power distribution circuit for distributing a power from the vehicle-mounted battery to the vehicle-mounted electric equipment, a<br><br><br>
4<br><br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 0505-1052P<br>
main relay for opening and closing the part of the power distribution circuit, and a main switch for turning the main relay on and off are mounted in the module housing. Thus, since the main switch and the main relay are also integrated in the module housing, the system can further be consolidated.<br>
[0013] The vehicle of the present invention is a two-wheeled vehicle inlcuding a front fork for rotatably supporting the front wheel, a steering shaft rotatably supported on the front portion of the vehicle body for linking the front fork and the steering handle to steer and operate the front wheel, a front body cover for covering the front side of the steering shaft, and an inner cover connected to the front body cover for covering the rear side of the steering shaft.  The module housing is disposed in a vehicle body space formed between the front body cover and the inner cover. A signal receiving portion of the receiver on the rear surface thereof is exposed toward the rear through the opening of the inner cover.   The mechanical locking mechanism is a handle locking mechanism capable of locking the rotation of the steering shaft. Accordingly, the remote control lock operation system, including the handle locking mechanism unitized integrally therewith, may be easily provided in the two-wheeled vehicle. Moreover, the signal receiving portion of the receiver may be secured toward the rear through the opening on the inner cover, and in this position, be able to receive signals over a wide range of angles.<br>
[0014] The invention furthers provides a mobile communication terminal having an infrared transmitting port capable of transmitting the infrared signal, input operation means for commanding transmission of the infrared signal from the infrared transmitting port arbitrarily, and transmission control means for allowing the infrared signal corresponding to the prescribed identification data to be transmitted from the infrared transmitting port in response to the input operation on the input operation means.<br>
[0015] The mobile communication terminal can be used instead of the hand-held remote control transmitter in those cases when the remote control transmitter has been lost or is not available for some reason. The user enters data into the mobile communication terminal via the input operation means, and allows an infrared signal corresponding to the prescribed identification data to be transmitted from the infrared<br><br><br>
5<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 05G5-1052P<br>
transmitting port with the infrared transmitting port of the mobile communication terminal faced toward the infrared receiving portion on the remote control receiver. When the infrared signal is received by the infrared receiving portion on the remote control receiver, the control unit of the remote control lock operation device operates and controls the lock actuator upon receipt of the infrared signal. Therefore, even when the remote control transmitter is not in the user's hands due to loss or some other reasons, the lock actuator can be operated and controlled easily by utilizing the mobile communication terminal provided with an infrared transmitting port, without using the key.<br>
[0016] Further, the invention provides for an emergency operating system for operating and controlling the lock actuator of the infrared remote control lock operation device including a mobile communication terminal having an infrared transmitting port that is capable of transmitting an infrared signal and a service center capable of transmitting a command signal as needed to the mobile communication terminal. The mobile communication terminal includes receiving means capable of receiving a command signal transmitted from the service center, and transmission control means for allowing an infrared signal corresponding to the prescribed identification data to be transmitted from the infrared transmitting port upon receipt of the command signal. The service center includes communication means for receiving notification from the user, and information storage means in which information for identifying the user upon receipt of notification is stored in advance.<br>
[0017] In addition, the invention involves a method of emergency operation for operating and controlling the lock actuator of the infrared remote control lock operation device. The steps of the method of the include:<br>
[0018] entering a transmission program in advance into the mobile communication terminal having an infrared transmitting port capable of transmitting an infrared signal and the capability of receiving the signal transmitted from the service center so that the terminal transmits the infrared signal corresponding to the prescribed identification data from the infrared transmitting port according to the command signal transmitted from the service center,<br><br>
6<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 0505-1052P<br>
[0019J identifying the user when the service center received notification from the user, [0020] facing the infrared transmitting port on the mobile communication terminal toward the infrared receiving portion on the remote control receiver, and {0021} transmitting the infrared signal corresponding to the prescribed identification data from the infrared transmitting port of the terminal toward the infrared receiving portion on the remote control receiver by transmitting the command signal from the service center to the mobile communication terminal based on the identification to operate and control the lock actuator.<br>
[0022] As the result of above aspects of the invention, in the case where the remote control transmitter is not in the user's hands due to loss or having been forgotten, the service center can identify the user upon receipt of notification from the user. Then, after identifying the user, a command signal is transmitted to the mobile communication terminal. When the communication terminal receives the command signal from the service center, the terminal transmits the infrared signal corresponding to the prescribed identification data from the infrared transmitting port upon receipt of the command signal. Therefore, if the infrared transmitting port faces toward the infrared receiving port on the remote control receiver, the infrared signal transmitted from the infrared transmitting port is received by the infrared receiving portion on the remote control receiver, and the control unit of the remote control lock operation device operates and controls the lock actuator according to the received signal. Therefore, even when the remote control transmitter has been lost, or is not in the user's hands due to some other reasons, the lock actuator can be operated and controlled by using the mobile communication terminal having the infrared transmitting port easily without using key.<br>
[0023] In addition, since the terminal must receive the command signal transmitted after identification of the user by the service center before operating and controlling the lock actuator using the mobile communication terminal, unauthorized operation or theft of the vehicle can be prevented.<br>
[0024] Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. However, it should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments<br><br><br>

Attorney Docket No. 0505-1052P<br><br>
[0035] The steering shaft 1 of the scooter V is rotatably supported by the head pipe of the metallic vehicle body frame, not shown, and extends vertically but inclining toward the rear inside, or the back side of the front body cover Ff formed of metal or synthetic resin as a front vehicle body. A front fork 2 for rotatably supporting the front wheel Wf is connected to the lower end of the steering shaft 1, and the upper end of the steering shaft 1 is connected to the central portion of the bar handle H. Therefore, turning operation of the bar handle H is transmitted to the steering shaft 1 and the front fork 2, and thus the front wheel Wf is steered.<br>
[0036] The central portion of the bar handle H and the upper end of the steering shaft 1 are covered by the handle cover He being formed of metal or synthetic resin and rotated integrally therewith for appearance sake. The left and right handle grips Hg on both ends of the bar handle H are projected respectively from the left and right ends of the handle cover He.<br>
[0037] The rear side of the portion lower than the handle cove He of the steering shaft 1 is covered by the inner cover I being formed of metal or synthetic resin and extending integrally upward from the front end of the step ST. The inner cover I is detachably connected to the backside of the front body cover Ff, and a vehicle body space 3 is formed between the rear side of the cover Ff and the inner cover I, through which the steering shaft 1 passes,<br>
[0038] A lock module M including a handle locking mechanism L for locking rotation of the steering shaft 1 (therefore^ the handle H) while being parked. A main portion of the remote control lock operation system for remotely controlling the same integrally united with each other is mounted in the vehicle body space 3. [0039] Referring to Fig. 2, the construction of the lock module M will be described. The lock module M has a box-shaped module housing 4.   Mounted in the module housing 4, are an infrared receiver R being capable of receiving the infrared signal transmitted from the infrared transmitter T carried by the occupant, a handle locking mechanism L as a mechanical locking mechanism that disables traveling of the vehicle mechanically, and a lock actuator A coupled to the handle locking mechanism L for locking and unlocking the same. Also mounted in the module housing 4 are a control unit C for determining whether of not the signal received by the receiver R is<br><br><br>
9<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 0505-1052P<br><br>
acceptable and operating and controlling the lock actuator A based on the received signal when it is acceptable are mounted in the module housing 4, and the wiring sections 5, 6 connecting the lock actuator A and the receiver R with the control unit C respectively.<br>
(,(10401, Also.., a. part of a. nower distribution circuit 8 for distributing, a nower to the respective vehicle-mounted electric equipment 7 from a buttery BA, a main relay 9 capable of opening and (/losing thje part of the power distribution circuit 8, and a main switch SW for turning the main relay 9 on and off are mounted in the module housing 4. The main switch SW being jalso connected to the lock actuator A, is adapted to operate the lock actuatoJ" A, irrespective of the control unit C, to unlock the handle locking mechanism L by turning fhe switch SW on.<br>
[0041] The module housing 4 is inserted into the vehicle body space 3 through the opening la formed on the inner cover I from the backside, and fixed on a suitable position on the vehicle body frame, not shown, for example, on the head pipe, or the like. In this fixed state, at least a part of the rear surface 4r of the module housing 4 is exposed toward the outside through the opening la of the inner cover I.   The signal receiving portion Ra of the receiver R is disposed on the rear surface 4r of the module housing 4 so as to be capable of receiving the signal from the rear. [0042] The handle locking mechanism L comprises a lock case 10 fixed on the front end of the module housing 4 and a lock pin 11 driven by the lock actuator A and moves from the lock case 1ยฐ toward and away from the steering shaft 1. The steering shaft 1 is formed with a locking hole la on the peripheral wall thereof at the position corresponding to the lock Pin M- The lock pm 11 engages the locking hole la to lock the steering shaft 1 at a prescribed rotational position, that is, brings the locking mechanism L in the locked state, when it is positioned at the prescribed frontmost locking position.<br>
[0043] Locking pin 11 comes out of the locking hole la and allows free rotation of the<br>
steering shaft 1, that is, brings the locking mechanism L into the unlocked state, when<br>
it is in the unlocking position that is backed away from the locked position by a<br>
prescribed amount.	<br><br>

Attorney Docket No. 0505-1052P<br>
[0044] A key cylinder (not shown) in which; the ignition key can be inserted is disposed in the module housing 4| The cooperative relation between the key cylinder and the handle locking mechanism L is the same as that between the handle locking mechanism for motorcycles and the key cylinder that is known in the related art, so that the handle locking mechanism L can be lopked in conjunction with pulling out of the ignition key. The key cylinder is constructed so -as to open and close the main switch SW in conjunction with the operation of the ignition key as in the case of the key cylinder for ignition key in thie motorcycle that is known in the related art. [0045] The transmitter T is embedded with a Operating switch 12 for performing the<br>
unlocking operation, and with signal transmittihg means (not shown) that is capable of<br>
(	<br>
transmitting the infrared signal! corresponding to the specific ED code by input<br>
operation of the switch 12. The structure of such infrared transmitter is well known in<br>
the related art.	;<br>
[0046] The control unit C includes an ID code verification means CI as a signal<br>
determination portion including ;the CPU and;the memory, an actuator driving means<br>
C2 for supplying actuation command signal to the lock actuator A, main relay driving<br>
means C3 for supplying actuation command signal to the main relay. 9, and the power<br>
supply circuit C4.	<br>
[0047] The ID code verification means CI verifies and determines whether or not the infrared signal received by the ihfrared receiver R is acceptable, that is, whether or not the ID code of the received signal coincides with the specific ED code stored in advance. When the ID code verification means CI determines that the received signal is a regular infrared signal (the ED code was coincided), the actuation command signal is supplied from the actuator driving means Cยฃ to the lock actuator A. [0048] The main relay 9 is connected to the tpain relay driving means C3 and the main switch SW in the module housing 4, and turning ON of the main relay 9 enables power<br>
 distribution from the buttery BK to the respective electric equipment 7 (including the engine starting circuit) mounted on the vehicje.<br><br>
[0049] Subsequently,  the  operation   of the  aforementioned  embodiment  will  be<br>
described.	 <br><br><br>
11<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 0505-1052P<br>
[0050] It is assumed that the scooter V is in the parked state and the handle locking mechanism L is in the locked state,<br>
[0051] When the infrared signal [is transmitted from the infrared transmitter T and received by the infrared receiver R in this state, whether or not the received signal is<br>
i<br>
acceptable, that is, whether not the ID code in the received signal coincides with the specific ID code stored in advancl is determined at the ID code verification means CI in the control unit C. When the received signal is determined to be a regular infrared signal (the ID code is coincided)), the actuator driving means C2 is turned ON and supplies an actuation command!signal to the lock actuator A so as to switch the<br>
actuator A into the unlocked state, thereby unlocking the handle locking mechanism L.<br>
j<br>
Simultaneously, the ID code verification means CI turns the main relay driving means C3 ON, and brings the main relay 9 into the power distribution enabled state. [0052] When the main switch SW is switched from OFF to ON by operating the ignition key, the main relay 9 is turned ON and thus the main power supply is applied, whereby enabling power distribution to the respective electric equipment 7 including the engine staring circuit. Therefore, when the starting switch (not shown) is turned ON by operating me ignition key in this state, power is distributed to the engine staring circuit so that the engine can be started. When starting operation is terminated, the scooter V is brought into a state of being able to travel.<br>
[0053] This embodiment provides a theft prevention mechanism in the case where the main relay 9 is brought into the power distribution enabled state as described above but left as it is with the main switch SW in the OFF state. This is provided by the control unit C which is programmed in such a manner that when the main switch SW is not turned on even after a certain period of time elapsed since the main relay 9 is brought into the power distribution enabled state, the ID code verification means CI turns the main relay driving means C3 [OFF. This brings the main relay 9 into the power distribution disabled state and invalidates the previous ID code verification, therefore restoring the lock actuator A agin to the locked state.<br>
[0054] In order to stop the engine in the operating state, the main switch SW is switched from ON to OFF by (operating the ignition key. As a consequence, power distribution to the electric systen of the engine is closed off, and thus the engine stops.<br>

Subsequently, when the ignition k|y is pulled out from the key cylinder (as in the case of the handle locking mechanism in the motorcycle that is known in the related art)<br><br>
from this state, the lock of the locking mechanism L is simultaneously actuated, so that<br>
the steering shaft 1 is locked.      <br>
[0055] This embodiment also provides a theft prevention mechanism in the case where<br>
it<br>
the engine is left as it is in the stopped state.  This is accomplished by programming<br>
the control unit C in such a manner that when a certain period of time has elapsed after<br>
 : the engine is stopped, the ID code verification means CI turns the main relay driving<br>
means C3 OFF, This agains brings the main relay 9 into the power distribution<br>
disabled state and invalidates the previous ID code verification. Thus, the lock actuator<br>
A is again restored to the locked state.<br>
[0056] When the ignition key is operated and the main switch SW is turned ON in a<br><br>
state in which the handle locking mechanism L is locked, the lock actuator A can be<br><br>
operated irrespective of the remcjite control lock operation system to unlock the handle<br><br><br>
locking mechanism L. Therefore, it can be unlocked with the ignition key without using the transmitter T as in the case of the normal remote control door locking device for vehicles in the related art.    <br>
[0057] As described above, according to this embodiment, the handle locking mechanism L, the receiver R, and the lock actuator A and the control unit C thereof<br><br>
that are the main components of the remote control lock operation system, and the<br>
wiring sections 5, 6 for connecting the lock actuator A and the receiver R to the control<br>
unit G are all unitized in the common module housing 4. As such, they can be<br>
mounted on the vehicle body via the housing 4 in a single operation. Also, the total<br>
number of the components is sijhall, and thus the unit is easy to handle and install on<br>
the vehicle body.	 <br>
[0058] Since the wiring section 5 leading to the lock actuator can be hidden and<br><br>
protected in the module housing 4 and not to be exposed toward the outside, the<br>
chance of an unauthorized userilconnecting the wiring section 5 directly to the buttery<br><br>
power source BA or changing ti|e connection thereof may be effectively prevented.<br><br><br>
13<br><br><br><br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 0505-1052P<br><br><br>
[0059] Furthermore, the main switch SW and the main relay 9 are also integrated in the<br>
module housing 4, the system may further be consolidated, and thus the costs may be<br>
reduced.	 <br>
[0060] Fig. 3 shows a second embodiment of the integrated handle lock module M. In<br>
this embodiment, the drive enable signal generating means 20 controlled by the control<br>
unit C based on the signal receives by the receiver R and capable of generating a drive<br>
enable signal for enabling starting or operation of the engine is mounted in the module<br>
housing 4 together with the wiring section 21 for connecting the means 20 to the<br>
control unit C.	<br>
[0061] As the drive enable signal generating means 20, for example, a digital signal<br>
i(ON-OFF signal) output means for enabling and disabling ignition (fuel injection) of<br>
the engine, a default reference! voltage output means for enabling and disabling<br>
ignition (fuel injection), or a digital code output means for enabling and disabling<br>
ignition (fuel injection) may be used. The output means is connected to the ignition<br>
control system, the fuel injection control system, or the starter motor control system of<br>
the engine, not shown. The drive enable signal generating means 20 is located in the<br>
module housing 4.	<br>
[0062] Therefore, according to this embodiment, in the unlikely event that the main power source is turned by an unauthorized user, neither the fuel injection control system, the starter motor control! system of the engine, nor the engine can be started or be operated, unless the drive enable signal generating means 20 generates a drive enable signal based on the regular signal received by the receiver R. This then, affords another means for theft prevention.<br>
[0063] Fig. 4 shows a third em|odiment of the integrated handle lock module M. In this embodiment, a transmitter IT' and a receiver R' for transceiverthe electric wave signal corresponding to the specific ID code is used instead of the transmitter T and the<br>
receiver R for transceiverthe inffared signal. Therefore, the module housing 4 does not<br>
have an infrared receiver R, ann an antenna 30 and an electric wave receiving circuit<br>
31 constituting the electric wavereceiver R' are integrated in the housing 4 instead.<br>
[0064] Fig. 5 shows a fourth embodiment of the integrated handle lock module M.<br>
Indicator output means 40 is provided in the module housing 4. The indicator output<br>
14<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 0505-1052P <br>
means 40, being controlled by th| control unit C based on the signal received by the<br>
infrared receiver R, supplies a lignjt emitting signal to the indicator 42 including a LED<br>
or a electric bulb of the vehicle instrument panel 41.<br>
[0065] Fig. 6, shows the use of at mobile phone TP as an emergency communication<br>
means for operating the lock actnator, when the hand-held remote transmitter is not<br>
available.   The mobile phone TP has the conventional function of a normal mobile<br>
phone. It includes an infrared transceiver port P capable of sending and receiving the<br>
infrared signal, and a transmission control means 11 for allowing the infrared signal<br>
corresponding to the ID code by the input operation on the operating panel 10 to be<br>
transmitted from the infrared transceiver port P.<br>
[0066] The construction of thef operating panel 10 is basically the same as the<br>
operating panel on. a conventional normal mobile phone. Thus, the mobile phone TP<br>
can be used as a normal mobile jphone by operating it in the normal way. In addition,<br>
the operating panel 10 is adapted to be capable of transmitting the infrared signal<br>
arbitrarily from the infrared transceiver port P based on the specific input operation of<br>
the operating panel 10.     Therefore, the operating panel 10 constitutes an input<br>
operation means of the present j mention for arbitrarily commanding the transmission<br>
of the infrared signal from the inj j-ared transceiver port P.<br>
[0067] The ID code as the specific identification data and the transmitting program for<br>
allowing the infrared signal coresponding to the ID code to be transmitted from the<br>
infrared transceiverport P by the input operation on the operating panel 10 are entered<br>
in advance into the storage section of the transmission control means 11.<br>
[0068] Therefore, in the case where the remote control transmitter T is lost or not in<br>
the user's hands due to some omer reason, the specific input operation is made on the<br>
operating panel 10 of the mobile phone TP with the infrared transceiver port P of the<br>
mobile phone TP faced toward [the infrared receiving portion Ra of the remote control<br>
receiver R.     The   transmission   control  means   11   allows  the  infrared  signal<br>
corresponding to the ID code to the transmitted from the infrared transceiver port P in<br>
response to the input operation: When the infrared signal is received by the infrared<br>
receiving portion Ra of the remote control receiver R, the control unit C of the remote<br>
control lock operation device! RM operates and controls the lock actuator A and<br><br><br>
15<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 0505-1052P<br><br>
unlocks the same as in the case of the aforementioned normal remote control operation<br>
upon receipt of the infrared signal <br>
[0069] Therefore, even when the remote control transmitter T has been lost or is not in<br>
the user's hands due some other reason, the lock actuator A can easily be operated and<br>
controlled by means of the mobfle phone TP having the infrared transceiver port P<br><br>
without using the key.	 <br>
[0070] Fig. 7 shows a second means of providing an emergency communication means<br>
for operating the lock actuator. Icomnded are the mobile phone TP, and a service center<br>
SS capable of transmitting a command signal to the mobile phone.<br>
[0071] The mobile phone TP serves as a mobile communication terminal having the<br>
infrared transceiver port P capaoje of sending and receiving the infrared signal. The<br>
service center SS is capable of transmitting the command signal to the mobile phone<br>
TP as needed.	 <br>
[0072] The mobile phone TP has a function as a conventional normal mobile phone<br>
4<br>
and includes a receiving means  12 capable of receiving command electric wave as a<br>
command signal transmitted from the service center SS, and a transmission control means 11' for allowing the infrared signal corresponding to the ID code to be transmitted from the infrared transceiver port P upon receipt of the command electric wave.<br>
[0073] The ID code as the specific identification data and the transmission program for<br>
transmitting the infrared signal corresponding to the ID code from the infrared<br>
transceiver port P upon receipt Of the command electric wave are entered in the storage<br>
II &gt; ft I<br>
[0074] The service center SS ii receiving notification from the<br>
section of the transmission control means 11' in advance.<br>
eludes a communication means 20 such as phone for ,user, and an information storing means 21 such as a<br>
personal computer in which personal information for identifying the user upon receipt<br><br>
of the notification (for exampjles, the ID code, the vehicle body frame number, the license number, and so on of me user) are registered and stored in advance. In the service center SS, support persbnnel may be available 24 hours/day for receiving the notification from users and responding thereto.<br><br>
16<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 0505-1052P<br>
[0075] As is described thus far, inthe case where the remote control transmitter T has been lost or is not in the user's hands due to some other reason, the user notifies the<br>
service center SS by means of the a mobile phone TP, or other means. In the service<br>
center SS, identification of the reiser is made based on information stored in the<br>
information storing means 21 upon receipt of notification from the user. After<br>
identification is made, the command electric wave is transmitted to the mobile phone<br>
TP of the user in question.	<br>
transceiver port P upon receipt o: signal transmitted from the inf receiving portion Ra of the transceiverport P faced toward t<br>
[0076] When the mobile phone. TP of the user received the command electric wave from the service center SS, thi 1 transmission control means 11' of the phone TP transmits the infrared signal corresponding to the specific ID code from the infrared<br>
jthe command electric wave. In this case, the infrared<br>
pred transceiver port P is received by the infrared<br>
remote contrql receiver R by keeping the infrared<br>
he infrared receiving portion Ra of the remote control<br><br>
receiver R. Upon receipt of the<br><br>
infrared signal, the control unit C of the remote control<br><br>
lock operation device RM oper |es and controls the lock actuator A and unlocks the same as in the case of the aforer. jj;ntioned normal remote control operation. [0077] Therefore, even when the remote control transmitter T has been lost or is not in the user's hands due to some ther reason, the lock actuator A can be operated and controlled by means of the motbile  phone TP with the infrared transceiver port P easily<br><br>
without using the key.   In addition, the tenhinal must receive the command electric<br><br>
wave transmitted after identification of thr user by the service center SS before<br>
operating and controlling the leclc actuator Using the mobile communication terminal.<br>
Thus, it provides an effective rt runs for preventing unauthorized operation and theft.<br>
[0078] Fig. 8 shows a laptop computer and p electronic notepad. Each of these may<br>
also serve as means for emergency communication for operating the lock actuator.<br>
Various other third party equip used, such as; a mobile game machine, a wristwatch, or<br>
a pocket bell may also be  used, so long| as they are equipped with an infrared<br>
transmitter.	<br>
[0079] The embodiments of  present invention have been described thus far, the present invention is not limited thereto, and various minor design modifications are<br><br>
17<br><br>
(       Attorney Docket No. 05O5-1052P<br>
possible. For example, a scootis  is exempted as a vehicle. However, the term "vehicle" in the present invention pay be two-wheeled vehicle other than the scooter, or may be any of three-wheeled i ihicles or for-wheeled vehicles, and whether or not the vehicle is motorized.[0080] In addition, even though (he main switch SW is adapted to be opened and closed by the operation of the ignition key irj the aforementioned embodiments, the main switch may be a manual switch or a rejnote control switch independent of the<br>
operation of the ignition key in the present invention.<br>
[0081] Furthermore, even though the main switch SW and the main relay 9 is mounted<br>
in the module housing 4, the mai i switch or thje main relay may be mounted outside of<br>
the module housing 4.	 <br>
[0082] Still further, the key cylender of the jgnition key is disposed in the module<br>
housing 4 so that the required ci operative relations are established with respect to the<br>
main switch SW or the handle locking [mechanism L in the aforementioned<br>
embodiments. However, the kej! cylinder ma^l be disposed outside the module housing<br>
4 in the vicinity of the main swich SW or the} handle locking mechanism L, so that the<br>
required cooperative relations may be established with respect to the main switch SW<br>
- or the handle locking mechanist | L.	<br>
(0083) Still further, even though the locking mechanism L is locked by manual โข operation (that is, in conjunction with pulling out of the ignition key from the key cylinder) in the aforementiorH A embodiments, it is also possible to construct the locking mechanism L in such;, ยง manner th|t not only unlocking operation but also locking operation thereof are pi jrformed by tie signal transmitted from the transmitters TT'.	 <br>
J0084] Furthermore, in the description abovk both of the user-specific identification data (ID code) and the transmming progranj for allowing the terminal TP to transmit the infrared signal correspond!: jg to the specific identification data (ID code) from the infrared transmitting port P in iresponse to the command signal transmitted from the service center SS are entered; in the mobile communication terminal TP in advance. However, the system may be constructed R in such a manner that the user-specific identification data (ID code) is only registered to the service center SS without being<br><br><br>
18 <br>
Attorney Docket No. 0505- 1052P<br>
entered into the mobile  communication terminal TP. In this case, when the service<br>
center SS transmite the command signal to the mobile communication terminal TP<br>
based on the identification user, it transi nits the specific identification data (ID<br>
code) through the command signal so that the terminal TP transmits the infrared signal<br>
corresponding to the specific identification  data (ID code) from the infrared<br>
transmitting the port P according to the present invention.<br>
[0085] i ne invention inus described affords numerous benefits. These are highlighted<br>
below:	 (0086] 1.)    Since the mechani||l locking r jechanism, the receiver, and the lock<br>
actuator and the control unit t| ereof that ai b the main components of the remote<br>
control lock operation system, and the wiring isection for connecting the lock actuator<br>
or the like to the control unit are unitized injithe common module housing, and thus<br>
they can be mounted on the vehicle body via the housing at a time, the total number of<br>
the components is small, and tht s it is easy to handle and to install on the vehicle body.<br>
Therefore, the size, weight, and cost of the system are reduced.    In addition,<br>
modification of the portion on me vehicle bo jly on which the system is to be mounted<br>
may be minimized. Furthermore in the, since the v Bring section leading to the lock actuator<br>
can be hidden and protected in -the module ihousing so as not to be exposed to the<br>
outside, dishonest unlocking, and thus theft'lof the vehicle by connecting the wiring<br>
section directly to the buttery-cower source  or changing connection thereof may be<br>
effectively prevented.	 <br>
[0087)2.) In the unlikely evlnt that the triain power source is turned on by an<br>
unauthorized user, starting of Ihgjne and the operation cannot be enabled unless the<br>
drive enable signal generating pneans generates a drive enable signal based on the<br>
regular signal received by the receiver,  This provides an effective means for<br>
preventing theft of the vehicle!;;	j<br>
[0088] 3.) The main switch;: and the mair; relay are also integrated in the module housing. Thus the system ca| be consolidated, thereby further contributing to cost reduction.	 <br>
[0089] 4.) The remote control |ock operation system with the unitized handle locking mechanism integrated into a two-wheeled vehicle, and secured toward the rear through<br><br><br>
19 <br>
	     Attorney Docket No. 0505-1052P<br>
the opening on the inner cover,in this positi|n, the signal receiving portion of the<br>
receiver is able to receive infraredj Signals from a wide range of angles.<br>
[0090] 5.)  When the remote control transmitter has been lost or is not in the user's<br>
hands due to some other reason the infrared ijignal for operating and controlling the<br>
lock actuator may be transmitted [toward the iafrared receiving portion of the remote<br>
control receiver by means of thii [mobile communication terminal having the infrared<br>
transmitting port capable of trarnsmitting me fifrared signal.   Thus, the lock actuator<br>
can be operated and controlled easily without ising the remote control transmitter thus<br>
without using the key.	 <br>
[0091] In addition, the mobile |communica^on terminal serves as an alternative<br>
transmitter, and thus it is n| $ necessary fo provide a separate remote control<br>
transmitter, thereby offering another way to rejhice costs.<br>
[0092] 6.)    With the invention! mobile coramunication terminal must receive the<br>
command signal transmitted after dentificatic h of the user by the service center before<br>
operating and controlling the lock actuator using the mobile communication terminal.<br>
Thus, it is an effective means for preventing unauthorized operation.<br>
[0093] The invention being thai described, jt will be obvious that the same may be<br>
varied in many ways.  Such vaiiations are n jt to be regarded as a departure from the<br>
spirit and scope of the inventil|, and all su ?h modifications as would be obvious to<br>
one skilled in the art are inte| led to be injuded within the scope of the following<br>
