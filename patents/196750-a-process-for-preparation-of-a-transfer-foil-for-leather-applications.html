support   is   selected   from   polyester   and   bi-axialy   oriented<br>
polypropylene (BOPP) with or without paper and wherein the<br>
thickness of said release coat layer is between 1-3 GSM (grams per<br>
sq meter);<br>
(b)	applying feel modifier layer with or without covering coating layer<br>
over the said release coat layer applied by step (a) wherein the said<br>
feel modifier layer has a thickness of 1-6GSM and comprises at least<br>
two layers selected from the two combinations, the first combination<br>
comprising a mixture of feel modifier as first layer and a top coat as<br>
second layer, the second combination being a feel modifier as first<br>
layer and a cover coat as second layer wherein feel modifier layer is<br>
selected from a single layer of wax or a combination of wax and<br>
lubricant or a separate layer of wax and lubricant and wherein the<br>
cover coat is selected from natural resins and wherein the top coat<br>
layer is selected from lacquer and lacquer emulsions of resins;<br>
(c)	applying a colour coating on to the said feel modifier layer wherein<br>
colourent is used with or without dispersing agent, with or without<br>
cross-linking or curing agents and the colourant is selected from<br>
metallic pigments, pearl pigments of organic or inorganic nature or<br>
dyestuffs and wherein the thickness of colourant layer is between 3-<br>
40 GSM;<br>
(d)	applying an adhesive layer adapted to contact leather surface<br>
provided over the colour coating applied by step (c) wherein the<br>
thickness of adhesive layer between 2-15 GSM.<br>
In accordance with this invention the transfer foil for leather applications comprises a<br>
paper or release film support to have a release coating provided thereon. A feel modifier<br>
layer with or without top protecting coating layer is provided onto said release coating. A<br>
covering and/or colourant layer is	<br>
provided on the feel modifier layer and an adhesive layer adapted to contact the leather surfaces is provided onto said covering/colourant layer. The feel modifier layer comprises a plurality of layers. According to an embodiment, the layer comprise at least two layers. One of said layers is a mixture of feel modifiers and a top coat or feel modifier and cover coat.<br>
The top coat layer is a protective coating for protecting the covering coat layer. The top coat layer consists of lacquer and lacquer emulsions of various resins, such as hitocellulose, copolymer of vinyl chloride and vinyl acetate, polyurethane with or without cross linking agents with or without fillers.<br>
The covering coat layer comprises essentially natural resins such as shellac, caesin, albumin and gelatene or plasticizers. Alternatively, the covering coat layer may be selected from natural resins or synthetic resins such as acrylic, methacrylic, synthetic rubber, vinyl resin, nitrocellulose resins or polyurethane. In accordance with another embodiment, the natural resin may be present alongwith the synthetic resin.<br>
A transfer foil according to a preferred embodiment of this invention is herein described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
Fig. 1        shows cross sectional view of the<br>
transfer foil.<br>
Referring to the? drawing particularly fig.i the transfer foil proposed by the present invention has a met/gloss base paper or a release film 1 having a release coating 2 provided thereon. A feel modifier coating 3 is provided onto said release coating 2 to provide a feel touch to the leather as required by the user. A covering and/or a colour coating 4 is provided onto said feel modifier layer 3 to provided the colour to the leather and finally an adhesive coating 5 adapted to contact the leather surface is provided onto the covering/colour coating 4.<br>
The feel modifer coating/layer 3 comprises &amp; plurality  of layers.  According to an  embodiments  the feel  modifier layer comprises atleast two layers.   One of said layer is a mixture of feel modifiers and a  top coat or feel modifier and cover coat.<br>
According  to  another embodiment   the  feel modifier  layer  comprises three layers namely a  feel<br>
modifier layer adjacent to the release coat, a top coat layer adjacent to the feel modifier layer, and a covering layer adjacent the top coat.<br>
The feel modifier layer comprises a combination of or only a single wax such as microcrystallene wax, paraffin, natural or synthetic waxes in solution or emulsion form. The waxes incorporated in the feel modifier imparts a waxy feel to leather.<br>
According to an embodiment the feel modifier layer also comprises oils used singularly or in combination with polydialkyl siloxane, olefin modified siloxanes, diethylene modified silicon oils, epoxy modified silicon oils alcohol modified silicon oils.<br>
According to another embodiment the feel modifier layer comprises a combination of waxes and lubricants as this also improves the scuff resistance properties. It a waxy feel is required, then the content of waxes present in the feel modifier layer is greater than that of the lubricants. However, if a silky feel is required then the content of lubricants present in the feel modifier layer is greater than the waxes. The feel modifier layer can consist of a combination of waxes and lubricants, or separate layers<br>
of waxes and lubricants.<br>
The top coat layer is a protective coating far protecting the covering coat layer. The coat layer consists of lacquer and lacquer emulsions of various resins, such as hitocellulase, copolymer of vinyl chloride and vinyl acetate, polyurethane with or without cross linking agents with or without fillers.<br>
