				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to alternative and augmentative communication system<br>
(AAC) and in particular alternative and augmentative communication system adapted for<br>
easy and intuitive manner of communication, which can be customized and reconfigured<br>
and also adapted to operate in multilingual mode. The system and method of<br>
communication of the invention is adapted for user friendly interface support to cater to<br>
requirement of easy access involving different modes of communication based on the<br>
users capacity to interact and is directed to a more intuitive and reliable alternative and<br>
augmentative communication.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The alternative and augmentative communication systems are basically directed to<br>
facilitate communication by individuals whose own abilities to communicate are not<br>
sufficient enough and need to interact and communicate by use of some support<br>
communication system. Usually such systems are adapted to receive inputs from the<br>
user and translate the input into an output message, which communicate the intended<br>
communication. Such known augmentative support systems include visual displays and<br>
synthesized speech.<br>
It is always important to develop augmentative communication systems, which could<br>
improve upon the rate of communication of successful communication with minimum<br>
possible user intervention. Such requirement of alternative and augmentative<br>
communication therefore necessitates the development of user interfaces with coding<br>
system to generate desired messages. In particular all such devices usually utilize codes<br>
supplied by the user to generate desire messages. Therefore the need to code the<br>
messages has led to the development of several coding systems and depending upon the<br>
user interfaces such variety of codlings usually are known to employ truncated words,<br>
words without vowel, contractions or sequences of graphic characters as input codes.<br>
Such coding are usually known to involve fixed code system where the user is required<br>
to specify a fixed code to generate a specific message alternatively it is also known be<br>
variable where the coding usually depend upon factors such as frequency or recency of<br>
use or the probable grammatical character of the message.<br>
It is also known to have augmentative communication employing databases containing<br>
variety of messages. In such cases the user can indicate the selected output message in<br>
the form of a string. Importantly also the alternative and augmentative communication<br>
system are well known to be a multi disciplinary involving areas of Artificial Intelligence<br>
(AI), Natural Languages Processing (NLP), Human Computer Interaction (HQ),<br>
Psychology and the like.<br>
US6289301 discloses a system and method for frame- based augmentative<br>
communication using pre- define lexical slots. US626007 discloses a system and method<br>
for frame based augmentative communication having a predefined nearest neighbor<br>
association between communication frames. US5956667 describe the system and<br>
method for frame based augmentative communication. US6266631 discusses another<br>
system and method for frame based augmentative communication having pragmatic<br>
parameters and navigational indicators. It would be apparent from the above that these<br>
are related to augmentative communication systems involving stored sets of pre defined<br>
messages for specific situations and adapted to retrieve them in an efficient manner<br>
according to the needs of the user. This is essentially betterment of the stored sentence*<br>
communication mode.<br><br>
US5299125 discloses a natural language processing system and method for parsing a<br>
plurality of input symbol sequences into syntactically or pragmatically correct word<br>
massages which is not sufficiently robust enough for wide language coverage.<br>
US5210689 discloses a system and method for automatically selecting among a plurality<br>
of input modes. US6005549 disclosed an user interface method and apparatus.<br>
It would be apparent from the above that while several variety of alternative and<br>
augmentative communication systems are presently in use, given the purpose of such<br>
systems there is a constant need for its development to favour wide language coverage<br>
and also its reconfigurability for multilinguality. Moreover, considering the variety and<br>
nature of incapacity of individuals such systems to favour wide application should<br>
preferably involve user friendly access so that user can access and use the system and<br>
communicate conveniently and reliably. It is also found that apart from the multi lingual<br>
character such systems should preferably have the adaptability were the user can input<br>
instructions in one language and generate the communication in another language suited<br>
for the purpose. In some situations standard peripherals like keyboard, mouse etc.<br>
known for use in such computer based communication system are not sufficient for the<br>
user and these also affect the required user friendly characteristics and limit<br>
augmentative communications. It is also found that simple coding of communicable<br>
messages is not always sufficient and it is experience that there is a need for imparting<br>
reconfigurability, intuitiveness and multilingual features in such augmentative<br>
communication systems for a wider and more effective and reliable alternative<br>
communication system.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The basic object of the present invention is directed to provide an alternative and<br>
augmentative communication system (AAC) and a method of alternative and<br>
augmentative communication and in particular to an alternative and augmentative<br>

using a graphical user interface means , a reconfigurable and multilingual Indian<br>
language based natural language generation means; and text-to speech<br>
converter means preferably Bengali/Hindi text-to-speech systhesizer.<br>
In the above method of the invention the said communication is following anyone or<br>
more of (i) stored sentence communication mode, (ii) keyboard communication mode<br>
wherein the keyboard supports adaptations and predictions in Indian languages and (iii)<br>
Iconic communication mode.<br>
Advantageously in the above method before the actual communication is started the<br>
user sets the language of communication as well as selects the options whether the<br>
special access mechanism is to be activated or not. To generate the said output in<br>
another language the SSU of one language (input) is matched with the SSU of another<br>
language (output) using multilingual SSU map. The method also uses multilingual<br>
dictionary resource for matching of concepts in different languages and communicate in<br>
the multilingual mode.<br>
The content customization can be advantageously carried out by selectively modifying<br>
anyone or more of the following:<br>
a)	list of stored data;<br>
b)	forest data structure alongwith icon-concept map information;<br>
c)	lexical knowledge base used by NLG module.<br>
The method effectively makes use of special access mechanism comprising scanning<br>
preferably automatic focusing- defocusing of GUI elements, auto scrolling using special<br>
hardware switches. Thus the method of the present invention carries out block scanning<br>
mechanism in addition to the row and column scanning mechanism.<br>
In accordance with one aspect the stored sentence mode of communication comprises:<br>
i)	considering a list of sentences by the user;<br>
ii) selection of a sentence by the user to be executed and/or spoken out by a<br>
text to speech converter preferably Bengali/Hindi text-to-speech<br>
synthesizer.<br>
The said language of communication can be vernacular using ITRANS (a standard of<br>
representing Indian language text using roman alphabets) for internal representations to<br>
store the sentences.<br>
In accordance with another aspect the keyboard mode of communication involving<br>
adaptations and predictions in Indian languages comprises:<br>
considering of a virtual keyboard by the user comprising of alphabets of the selected<br>
language, composing the text involving edit options and displaying the composed text in<br>
a display area .<br><br>
In accordance with another aspect the iconic mode of communication used by the user.<br>
Comprise:<br>
means for considering set of icon-text pairs by the user each representing a<br>
concept;<br>
;<br>
means for interacting with the system with the question and possible answer<br>
based feedback mechanism;<br>
means for completing the selection process and out putting system-generated<br>
text.<br>
Following the above method the output is generated by the user by specifying the exact<br>
type affirmative, negative, interrogative, tense aspect and modalities of the desired<br>
single output sentence.<br>
In the above method the natural language is generated following the steps of :<br>
i) the UI file from the ICM is sent to the converter whereby the UI file is converted<br>
to SSU frames;<br>
ii) forwarding the unmodified SSU frame to the SSU planner to arrange the SSUs in<br>
proper order;<br>
iii) forwarding the ordered SSU to frame value modifier ,wherein each of the SSU<br>
from the frame is extracted and sent to the SSU Modifier for extraction of each<br>
QH block present in the SSU and forward the same to the QH Modifier and also<br>
extracting the verb from the frame and sending to Verb modifier<br>
iv) the modified SSU and AV Blocks are combined together to produce a modified<br>
SSU frame which is output of frame value modifier;<br>
v) providing the modified frame as input to the sentence maker to produce the final<br>
sentence as output from this frame.<br>
The said step of conversion of UI file to a SSU comprises use of two resources<br>
comprising (i) a SSU-PP frame which lists the pre/post positions for each SSU and (ii) a<br>
lexical knowledge database. In particular, for the arrangement of the SSU in proper<br>
order the resource used is the knowledge of the relative SSU ranks.<br>
Preferably, in the above method the said OH block modification is operated using a (i)<br>
qualifier planner to arrange qualifiers inside a QH block using a resource file that<br>
encodes knowledge about qualifier ordering in a form of regular expressions (ii) a<br>
qualifier modifier to properly inflect each qualifier according to a linguistic rule and (iii) a<br>
headword modifier to modify the headword according to some linguistic rules stored in a<br>
rule base.<br>

Figure 11 illustrate the another embodiment of special access switches.<br>
Reference is first invited to Figure 1 which illustrates by way of a block representation<br>
the features in accordance with a preferred aspect of the system and method for an<br>
intuitive, customizable, multilingual and recofigurable alternative and augmentative<br>
communication in accordance with the present invention. As represented in said figure<br>
the basic essential means used by the system involve the Content Developer (CD),<br>
Graphical User Interface (GUI) and the Natural Language Generator (NLG), which are<br>
shown shaded.<br>
The Content Developer (CD) means is used to populate the system with contents which<br>
is adapted to basically provide two types of content (i) natural language root words<br>
associated with icons and (ii) sentences / phrases. The root words are selectively<br>
adapted to be stored in a hierarchical tree format in a text file as clearly shown in Figure<br>
2. Each record in the data file as shown in said Figure 2 comprise of the following parte<br>
Word type &gt; <word categoryx tree path> where,<br>
Word type indicates whether this is root node or a normal node in the tree. Word<br>
category indicates whether the word is a verb / adjective/adverb etc. Tree path indicates<br>
the path in the tree starting from root node whose end node is the word. Word is the<br>
actual root word.<br>
The Content Developer (CD) is also adapted to produce a text file containing the<br>
information related to word-icon association. The records in this file is of the form:<br><image name: word>. Another text file contains the stored sentences / phrases. Using<br>
this module, user can customize the system content according to his / her need. In<br><br>
particular for the purpose of customizability the system is adapted such that the content<br>
as well as the layout of the interfaces (i.e. the way the content is displayed to the user)<br>
can be changed as per the requirement of the user. This is an essential requirement of<br>
any AAC system because the content and layouts are user dependent. For example, a<br>
set of icons may be relevant to a particular user but the same set can be not so relevant<br>
(or even totally irrelevant) to some other user. Similarly, a particular way of displaying<br>
the system content may be of interest to a particular user or a group of users with<br>
similar requirements but may not be so to some other user (s). The former is related to<br>
system content customization whereas the later is related to layout customization<br>
(technically called adaptation).<br>
The system is adapted such that the Content Developer (CD) operatively interacts with<br>
the Graphical User Interface (GUI) module as also shown in Figure 1 for facilitating<br>
content customization. For the purpose the system is provided with means for storage of<br>
content data including:<br>
list of stored sentences (used in SCM);<br>
forest data structure along with icon-concept map information (used in ICM);and<br>
lexical knowledge base used by NLG module.<br>
The CD module is adapted to add or modify the existing content and such adaptation<br>
features are inbuilt into the system and doesn't require direct intervention of the user.<br>
Another essential aspect of the system is the Graphical User Interface (GUI) means<br>
which is adapted to help the user to perform various communication tasks in an easy<br>
and intuitive way. In Figure 3, a screen shot of the interface is given.<br>
In particular in accordance with an important aspect of the system of the invention the<br>
interface is specifically adapted to support three different modes of communication.<br>
(i) Communication through pre stored sentence / phrases<br>
(ii) Communication through typed messages (with the help of a virtual keyboard) and<br>
(Hi) Communication via icon selection.<br>
In the first mode of communication, a set of pre-stored sentences / phrases is shown to<br>
the user. User can select any one from the list and the system then "speaks out" the<br>
selected sentence / phrase using a text to speech synthesizer means. Figure 4 gives a<br>
screen shot of the system in this particular mode. As clearly apparent from said figure<br>
the SCM (stored sentence mode of communication) is adapted for the following:<br>
showing a list of sentences to the user ;<br>
if the language of communication is vernacular, then the internal representation used to<br>
store the sentences is ITRANS (a standard of representing Indian language text using<br>
roman alphabet);<br>
to display non-English text, FC is used to convert internal representation to the font of<br>
the particular language before displaying it to the user;<br>
the system displays a limited number of sentences at a time (10 in the current system),<br>
if number of stored sentences exceeds that number, there are options to get next or<br>
previous set of sentences;<br><br>
if the SAM module is enabled, these sentences will be automatically scanned<br>
sequentially;<br>
if a sentence is selected by the user (either using SAM or normally with mouse/<br>
keyboard), the selected sentence will be "spoken out" by the TTS;<br>
It is also possible to incorporate icons along with text in this mode. There is an exit<br>
option that can be used to exit from this mode of communication.<br>
In the second mode, a virtual keyboard involving adaptations and predictions in Indian<br>
languages (such as in the user's native language) with various editing facilities is<br>
provided to the user. User can "type in" text using this keyboard and can "speak out" the<br>
typed text with the help of a text to speech synthesizer. In figure 5, a screen shot of<br>
such a virtual keyboard in Bengali is given, along with different editing facilities. In this<br>
KCM (keyboard mode of communication) the system is thus adapted for the following:<br>
showing a virtual keyboard is shown to the user;<br>
the keyboard is provided with alphabet of the said language, a display area to display<br>
the composed text and a set of standard editing options that includes {Back Space,<br>
Space, Clear, Speak, Exit};<br>
for non-English language communication, FC is used to display keys and composed text<br>
in the native language;<br>
for vernacular languages, the internal representation that is used to store composed text<br>
is ITRANS;<br>
using speak option, the composed text can be "spoken out" (using the TTS module).<br>
The exit option can be used to exit from this mode of communication.<br>
In the third mode, user selects a set of icons from the interface. The system then can<br>
form this selected icon set. Depending upon the cognitive ability of the user, this mode<br>
can operate in two variants. In one variant, user specifics the type of sentence he/she<br>
needs and correspondingly the system outputs a single sentence of that particular type.<br>
However specifying the sentence outputs all possible sentences that can be formed out<br>
of the selected icon set and the user can choose any one from them. The selected<br>
sentence can also be "spoken out" using a text - to - speech synthesizer. Figure 6 and<br>
figure 7 shows the two variant of the system working in this particular mode. Figure 8<br>
demonstrates the behavior of the interface in terms of state transition diagram in this<br>
mode. An exemplary list of actions based on which a state transition can occur is as<br>
follows: An item is selected and the item is a verb; An item is selected and the item is a<br>
word; An item is selected and the item is a verb / word category; Item to display next<br>
set of icons is selected; Item to display previous set of icons is selected; Item to undo<br>
the current selections made so far is selected; Item to go to adverb selection state is<br>
selected; Item to go to word qualifier selection state is selected; Item to exit the<br>
selection mode and go to output mode is selected.<br>
A more detailed illustration is apparent from Figure 8 which shows the various states<br>
indicative of:<br>
BS (P) → user can select only a verb in this state<br>
PS (PC) → user can select a verb category in this state<br>
BS (A) → user can select adverb (s) in this state<br>
HS (P, PC) → user can select either a verb or a verb category<br>
HS (W, WC) → user can select either word (s) or word category<br><br>
BS (W) → user can select only word (s) in this state<br>
BS (Q) → user can select word qualifier (s) in this state<br>
PS (WC) → user can select a word category in this state<br>
C1, C2 → these are control states to determine next state of the system<br>
Thus in this ICM (Iconic mode of communication) the system is adapted for :<br>
i)	Showing a set of icon-text pair is shown to the user;<br>
ii) Each icon-text pair represents a concept. For example, the concept of weat" will<br>
be displayed to the user as an icon of eating along with the text "eat".<br>
iii) The system is verb driven. User has to select a verb first to communicate<br>
something.<br>
iv) Whenever user selects a verb, the system is adapted to ask a series of questions<br>
to the user (each question corresponds to a SSU of the SSU frame of the verb).<br>
The SSU frame is a structural model of natural language sentences. Each<br>
question is accompanied by a set of possible answers.<br>
v) User can select one/more answer (s) of a question or can skip the current<br>
question and goes to the next (if any)/previous (if any) question.<br>
vi) In case of wrong selection (s), user can undone it.<br>
vii) A verb can be qualified by adverbs (ex. moving fast) or a word can be qualified by<br>
word qualifiers (ex. a red ball).<br>
viii) Once the selection is complete, the system goes to output mode.<br>
ix) The output (natural language sentence) can be produced in two different ways. In<br>
one case, user specifies the exact type (affirmative/negative/interrogative),<br>
tense, aspect, and modality of the desired output sentence. The system<br>
accordingly produces a single output sentence.<br>
x) In other variant, the system produces all possible output sentences (syntactically<br>
different) that can be produced from the user selection. User can choose one<br>
from this output set.<br>
xi) In the first variant, user can optionally "speak out" the generated sentence<br>
whereas in the second case, the system automatically "speaks out" the selected<br>
sentence.<br>
xii) A concept hierarchy is used to display large number of concepts in a limited<br>
display area. For example, large numbers of verbs are organized under verb<br>
categories; large numbers of words are organized under word categories etc.<br>
xiii) There are options to restart the whole communication process (in ICM) (by using<br>
restart option) or to exit this particular mode (using exit option).<br>
Importantly, the system of the invention achieves intuitiveness since the GUI module is<br>
adapted to work in an interactive manner. This is particularly true in ICM mode of<br>
communication where this feature is primarily required. The ICM mode is verb driven.<br>
User has to select a verb first to initiate communication. For example, to indicate "I ate<br>
an apple yesterday", user will first select the main verb "eat". Then the system will pose<br>
a series of questions to the user along with possible set of answers for each question.<br><br>
User can select one/more answer (s) from the set. For example, to construct the above<br>
sentence, once user selects the verb "eat", the system will ask the question "who" along<br>
with possible answers {I, You, He, She, Father etc}. An icon will accompany each of<br>
these possibilities. User will select "I" from this set. Similarly, user will select "apple" for<br>
"what" and "yesterday" for "when". After this selection is complete, the GUI module will<br>
invoke the NLG module to construct the appropriate sentence. This easy to understand<br>
question-answering technique of communication is intuitive and incorporated in the<br>
system of the invention.<br>
The adaptability and reconfigurability of the system of the invention in such ionic mode<br>
of communication is further illustrated in greater detail in relation to the components of<br>
natural language generator (NLG) of the present system as per accompanying Figure 9.<br>
In particular a sequential summary of the working and functionality of the various<br>
modules is given below.<br>
The UI file from ICM is sent to the converter (UC) adapted to convert the UI file to a SSU<br>
frame. Two resource bases are operatively linked for such conversion. A SSU-PP map<br>
that lists the pre / post positions for each SSU, and a lexical knowledge base containing<br>
the lexical category, person, number, gender information of lexical items (verbs, words,<br>
qualifiers).<br>
The SSU frame generated by the converter is unmodified. It contains SSUs that are not<br>
in proper order. The value of each SSU is also not modified and contains root words only.<br>
Furthermore, the qualifiers in individual QH blocks (constituents of a SSU) are not<br>
properly ordered. The verb is also not inflected.<br>
This unmodified SSU frame is then sent to the SSU planner (SP) that arranges the SSU<br>
in proper order (the order in which they actually appear in a sentence). The resource<br>
used here is the knowledge of relative SSU ranks (the relative rank of each SSU with<br>
respect to other SSUs in a language).<br>
The output of SP is a SSU frame with ordered SSUs but unmodified values. The verb is<br>
also unmodified. It is then sent to the frame value modifier (FVM) to modify all these<br>
values.<br>
FVM consists of two independent components, the SSU modifier (SM) and the verb<br>
modifier (VM). In FVM, each SSU from the frame is extracted and sent to the SM.<br>
Similarly the FVM extracts the verb from the frame and sends it to the VM.<br>
SM consists of QH_block modifier (QM). SM extracts each QH_block present in the SSU<br>
and sends it to the QM to get it modified.<br>
The QM consists of three components. They are (1) a qualifier planner (QP) that<br>
arranges qualifiers inside a QH_block. QP uses a resource file that encodes knowledge<br>
about qualifier ordering in the form of regular expressions, (2) a qualifier modifier that<br>
properly inflects each qualifier according to some linguistic rule and (3) a headword<br>
modifier that modifies the headword according to some linguistic rules. The linguistic<br>
rules are stored in the rule base.<br>
The output of a QM is a modified QH_block. All these modified QH_blocks are composed<br>
together according to certain linguistic rules by SM to form a modified SSU.<br>
The VM modifies the AV_block with the help of a rule base.<br>
All these modified SSUs and AV_block are combined together to produce a modified SSU<br>
frame. This is the output of FVM.<br><br>
This modified frame is then taken as input by the sentence maker and produces final<br>
sentence as output from this frame.<br>
Importantly, the range of sentences that can be produced using the system of the<br>
invention m fairly large in number (using the SSU model). To reduce the resulting<br>
cognitive load, the GUI is designed to work In a question-answering mode (using the<br>
semantics of SSU). Moreover, using the question-answering mode of ICM along with the<br>
SSU model of natural language sentences in the system of the invention, the limitations<br>
of the existing systems to produce sentences having only at most three components,<br>
namely agent, action and patient (theme) can be avoided. For example, sentences like<br>
"John ate an apple". However, these types of sentences cover a very limited domain in<br>
any natural language, even if the said domain is restricted to grammatically simple<br>
sentences only. The way these sentences are produced by the existing system is not<br>
particularly suitable to produce even simple sentences with many components. For<br>
example, sentences like "John, Alex and Mary are going to the movie today with Mary's<br>
uncle in a white ambassador". If the NLG techniques that are used in the existing system<br>
is used to produce this type of sentences from the input set {John, Mary, Alex, go,<br>
movie, Mary, uncle, white, ambassador}, then either a large amount of information is<br>
required to produce the said sentence or there will be many possibilities from which one<br>
possibility has to be selected. Using SSU model of the invention, sentences that are even<br>
more complicated than the one cited above can be generated easily with little cognitive<br>
load on the user. Thus the SSU model increases the flexibility in the communication<br>
process by giving the user power to generate a large number of sentences in an easy<br>
way.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention the system is provided with a<br>
versatile, reconflgurable and intuitive Natural Languages Generator (NLG) means. This is<br>
adapted to generate natural language sentence (s) from the selected set of icons. The<br>
design of each SSU is either a noun or pre / postpositional phrases along with some<br>
semantic information embedded into it. Any natural language simple sentences can be<br>
viewed as a collection of such SSU's along with one / more verb phrases (consisting of a<br>
verb with adverbs).. Furthermore, any complex sentence can be analyzed as a<br>
composition of a number of such simple SSU frames. The semantic information is used<br>
to perform the ordering of different SSU components as well as ordering the SSUs in a<br>
sentence. The semantic information also helps to some extent to the design of an<br>
intuitive user interface. The natural language generator takes the user selection as its<br>
input, produces a SSU frame from that input, performs certain linguistic task on the<br>
frame and finally produces the semantically and syntactically correct natural language<br>
text as output. Figure 9 further shows the architecture of the NLG module.<br>
Importantly also in accordance with another aspect the system is adapted for the<br>
multilingual mode of operation in Iconic communication mode (ICM). The multilingual<br>
characteristics in the system of the invention is achieved by way of:<br>
The NLG module of the system is completely re-configurable. So system in different<br>
languages (Bengali, Hindi and other Indian languages as well as English) can be made<br>
easily by re-configuring the NLG module.<br>
User can provide input in one language and can get the output in some other language.<br>
However, for this to happen, the NLG module incorporates two additional resources:<br>
A multilingual SSU map that maps the SSU of one language to the corresponding SSU of<br>
another language .A multilingual dictionary that contains mapping of concepts in<br>
different languages (e.g., the concept "Eating" will have an entry in the multilingual<br>
dictionary as "Eat" in English, "khAoYA" in Bengali, "khAnA" in Hindi etc.). The modified<br>
ICM in that case is illustrated in Figure 9 (the gray colored boxes indicate the resources).<br><br>
Advantageously, the NLG in the present system is highly modular where the I/O of each<br>
module along with the resources they use is clearly specified (the basic architecture is<br>
shown in the next figure). The formats of the resources (the gray colored boxes) are<br>
very easy to understand and change. This complete standardization of the architecture<br>
and resource formats is the key to language re-configurability. By changing a few sub-<br>
modules and/or some resource files will result in a NLG modules for a new language. The<br>
SSU model also helps in this process by facilitating identification and standardization of<br>
the resources and making them easy to change, even for a non- technical person.<br>
Regarding TTS, addition of Indian language TTS (for Bengali and Hindi language<br>
communication) is a novel feature in such systems and were not done before.<br>
Advantageously further the system of the invention is re-configurable. That means all<br>
the modules or sub-modules are specifically adapted to be replaced with new ones (with<br>
same functionality) that conform to the I / O standard of the specific module / sub-<br>
module. For example, by changing few sub-modules of the NLG module (namely<br>
QH_block modifier, Verb Modifier), NLG for three different languages (Bengali, Hindi,<br>
English) can be developed. Similarly, by changing the output component of the ICM sub-<br>
module of the GUI module, two different GUI versions of the system can be developed.<br>
In accordance wit a preferred aspect of the present invention the system comprises of<br>
Special Access Mechanism (SAM) adapted for people with severe neuro-motor<br>
disabilities. This segment of user cannot use normal peripheral devices like keyboard<br>
involving adaptations and predictions in Indian languages, mouse etc due to their<br>
physical disability. Using the SAM module, users can access the system with special<br>
purpose access devices. For the purpose the system is provided with special access<br>
switches. These switches can be used in different modes like single switch two switch<br>
etc. In single switch mode, the on-screen items are automatically scanned one after<br>
another and the switch is used to select a particular item while it is being scanned. In<br>
two-switch mode, one switch is used to "shift" the scan from one item to another and<br>
the other switch is used to select a particular item. Figure 10 illustrates the mechanism<br>
through a state transition diagrams. User can customize the scanning speed and number<br>
of switches according to his / her need. As represented in said figure R is indicative of →<br>
register switch is "clicked"; S is indicative of → shift switch is "clicked"; F is indicative of<br>
→ finished input selection and RST is indicative of → restart selection process<br>
In accordance with a preferred aspect the SAM module consists of means for scanning<br>
such as automatic focusing-defocusing of GUI elements, auto-scrolling and means for<br>
special access switches. In particular in accordance with a preferred aspect the special<br>
access mechanism includes:<br>
i) A keyboard involving adaptations and predictions in Indian languages<br>
adapted with features for block scanning mechanism in addition to the row<br>
and column scanning mechanism;<br>
ii) Auto-scrolling mechanism adapted to display large number of concepts in<br>
a limited display area;<br>
iii) Special access switches.<br>
In accordance with another preferred aspect of the system of the invention there is<br>
provided Font converter means adapted to display non-English natural language text. In<br>
case of Indian languages, the system internally works with a standard known as ITRANS.<br>
The font converter module is used to convert from ITRANS to respective language fonts.<br>
In case of English, this module is not required.<br><br>
In accordance with yet another aspect the system of the invention involves a Text to<br>
Speech Synthesizer means adapted to "speak out" whatever text user wants to<br>
communicate. For Bengali and Hindi, indigenously developed TT5 systems are being<br>
used to "speak out" the text.<br>
In the system of the invention the CD operation is the first to be performed (at least<br>
once) in the system. However, due to the feature of customizability and personalization<br>
with respect to varied need of the users, later CD operations are also permitted. Before<br>
the actual communication process starts, user can set the language of communication as<br>
well as whether to start SAM or not. Depending on those choices, the system<br>
automatically invokes FC and SAM modules (if required). In the GUI process, user can<br>
use any of the three modes of communications by selecting the appropriate option. If<br>
invoked, SAM, FC and GUI operates in parallel. In ICM, once a user finishes selection of<br>
icons (thus constructing an UI file), he / she can invoke NLG module to get a textual<br>
output. Optionally, user can invoke the "ITS module to get a spoken output. In SCM,<br>
selection of an item automatically invokes the TTS whereas in KCM, the TTS is optional.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, FC, TTS, and NLG can be<br>
used in other applications also. For example, in a machine translation'system, the FC<br>
component can be used to display generated target language text if the text is not in<br>
English, whereas the NLG can be used as the target language generator. One of the<br>
many applications of the TTS is as an integral component in a screen-reader system for<br>
visually handicapped.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the present invention to provide a system for alternative<br>
and augmentative communication, which can be easily reconfigured to develop systems<br>
for any particular language. The input / output of every module / sub module is<br>
adaptable for standardization such as for the Bengali, Hindi and English version of the<br>
systems;<br>
Based on the present preferred language adaptability of the system for Bengali, Hindi<br>
and English the following language pairs, namely Bengali-Hindi, Hindi-English, English-<br>
Bengali, Bengali-English, Hindi-Bengali, and English-Hindi can be generated. The method<br>
can be extended to other languages that are structurally similar to any of the three<br>
languages, namely Bengali, Hindi or English.<br>
The system is also adapted to operate in multilingual mode. This is particularly relevant<br>
in case of third mode, of communication, namely communication through icons. In this<br>
mode, user selects icons. Each icon has a text associated with it that conveys the<br>
meaning. The system produces natural language sentence(s) based on the selection.<br>
However, user can select icons in a particular language (meaning the text with each icon<br>
will be displayed in that language) and the system can produce output in some other<br>
language. In this way, the system can be used in a multilingual environment also.<br>
Moreover, the system is also customizable and intuitive to serve as a user friendly and a<br>
more reliable communicable media.<br><br>
