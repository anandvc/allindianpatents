	"Stabilized heterogeneous matrix system containing enzymes"<br>

3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed. <br><br>
Field of invention:<br>
This invention relates to a heterogeneous matrix system comprising at least one lipid and stabilizer maintained in the vicinity of enzyme(s) which provides stability to the enzyme formulation. The invention may be formulated into powder, granules or tablet form. Further the invention may optionally comprise active and/or inactive ingredients processed by suitable technique.<br>
Background and Prior art:<br>
The stability of bioactive molecules such as enzymes and proteins remains a critical issue in biotechnology and pharmaceutical dosage forms. Loss of catalytic activity of bioactive molecules due to high temperature, pH and other denaturing influences is one of the most important concerns for commercialization and industrial application of the enzymes. Both storage and operational stabilities affect the usefulness of enzyme-based products. Storage stability, or shelf life, refers to maintenance of catalytic abilities of the enzyme in the period between manufacture and eventual use. Operational stability describes the persistence of enzyme activity during a process. Immobilization of bioactive molecules can give notable stability and generally prevent loss of activity.<br>
Enzymes are usually processed by the spray drying or the freeze-drying technique. The commonly used method for preparing solid protein pharmaceuticals is lyophilization (freeze-drying). However, this process generates a variety of freezing and drying stresses, such as solute concentration, formation of ice crystals, pH changes, etc. All of these stresses can denature proteins to various degrees. It has been shown that many additives, such as sugars, certain amino acids, some amines, and glycerol, stabilize proteins against these stresses during freezing and drying processes. Still, in many cases the use of these additives is insufficient to stabilize proteins completely. Even after successful lyophilization, the long-term storage stability of proteins may still be very limited, especially at high storage temperatures. Most proteins are only marginally stable at neutral pH and room temperature and hence are readily denatured by increasing (occasionally decreasing) the temperature, pressure, and by pH changes. Additionally,<br><br>
freeze dried products are very prone to absorb moisture when subjected to further processing in different formulations.<br>
Spray-drying technique is preferred over the freeze drying as it has low cost and good scale-up potential. In order to produce stable, storable enzymes, drying is one possibility. Indeed, removal of water reduces the movement freedom of the protein molecules and thus inhibits conformational changes leading to activity loss. But, spray-drying technique does not completely remove water.<br>
Stabilizing an enzyme normally means suppressing the unfolding of the protein and retaining the catalytic activity. The most important methods for stabilizing enzymes are modification of the protein structure by direct site mutagenesis and binding the biomolecule to polymeric carriers. But these approaches are not so feasible for the industrial (scale-up) application for the development of solid dosage form. Different approaches have been utilized for the stabilization of the enzyme in the solid dosage form, which include use of stabilizers, use of additives that increase thermostability of the enzymes, novel dosage forms (e.g. nanosphere), different coating layers (Coated granules WO 9723606) etc., but among these very few have a scale up potential. Many thermoelastic additives are used for the stabilization of enzyme in the tablet form e.g. Carrageenan. These agents can be tableted very easily under low pressure and at the same time show significant elastic recovery, due to this they can be expected to store less stress in the tablet and to embed the enzyme softly.<br>
Bioactive materials such as enzymes are reported in the tablet form for textile applications (US20030171238). This patent describes the use of effervescent material in combination with the enzyme for the textile and pulp industry. The tablet weight described in this is l gm to 100 gm, which is not feasible for the therapeutically active enzymes. In this patent application, the stability of the enzyme during compression and on storage is not mentioned.<br><br>
Enzymes are preferably delivered in the solid dosage form. In the solid dosage form, tablets are the suitable dosage form for application of these materials because enzymes are formulated in the dry state. The limited stability of enzymes during long-term storage has been attributed to the deleterious effects of moisture and microbial contamination due to moisture present in the granules or tablet. Tablet can be prepared by the dry granulation, wet granulation or direct compression. Also, in the wet granulation the residual moisture in granules provides mobilization to the enzyme and this leads to loss of activity. To avoid the water for granulation many solvents have been tried for the granulation, but water-miscible solvents are, in many cases, more problematic than hydrophobic solvents as regards protein stability. This is because hydrophilic solvents, unlike their hydrophobic counterparts, can remove the essentially bound water from the surface of the enzyme molecule. These hydrophobic solvents can not be used as a vehicle for binder due the residual volatile impurities. In case of direct compression or dry granulation the pressure applied to make the tablet or slug is more as compared to pressure required for granules prepared by wet granulation. The pressure, heat and environmental moisture are the major factors that affect the stability of enzyme during processing as well as during storage.<br>
Tablet dosage form can be prepared by wet granulation, dry granulation, direct compression or combination of these. Tablet containing enzymes such as amylases, proteases, lipases, invertases, papain, pepsin, pancreatin etc. have been described long ago in the patent US 3515642. In this invention sorbitol has been used for the stabilization processed by freeze-drying and spray drying. Also this invention utilizes the aqueous and non-aqueous solvent for the processing. But use of solvents has its own disadvantages and effects on enzyme stability.<br>
WO9500121 discloses production of a directly compressible enzyme powder by mixing a liquid enzyme preparation with a suitable carrier, using the principle of wet granulation technique, which can then be compressed to get a tablet. The powder has moisture content at most 10%. This high level of moisture may provide mobilization to the enzyme, and thus stability of enzyme is doubtful. Also the carrier used for this purpose must be able to absorb liquid.<br><br>
WO 9723606 teaches that repeated scavenger layers and special coatings are necessary to produce stable enzyme granules. Practically this invention is time consuming; process is complex due to number of coating steps and expensive due to four different coating layers of the material. This invention deals with only delayed release of the enzyme.<br>
Due to compaction pressure the losses of activity up to 50% has been reported for the different enzymes (C L D Teng, Pharm Res., 5, 1988, 776-780). This operational stability has become a serious issue for the commercialization of the enzyme product.<br>
Many additives have been reported to increase the thermostability and in some cases even activity of the enzymes like salts, polyols (polyethylene glycol, glycerol), dextran, bovine serum albumine, polyethylenimine, polyelectrolytes, organic osmolytes (e.g. betaine), organic solvents (isooctane, cyclohexane, chloroform, benzene), sugars (e.g. lactiol, mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol, inositol, erythritol) (US 3515642).<br>
There are few reports where lipidic materials such as glyceryl monooleate have been used for protection of peptide molecules such as insulin and serratiopeptidase (Paradkar et al.). Enzyme loaded in lipid powder has been used in the preparation of dough in baking industry for achieving release at specific temperature (WO 0219828). The release of the enzyme is dependent on the temperature and the activity of the enzyme which is utilized in the system only. Lipidic pellets containing enzymes have been used in animal feed (WO 9212645). The limitation of this invention is that the enzyme(s) are stabilized only when they are coated with the coating agent at least 1%, preferably 15-35%. Controlled release for about five days was obtained by using implants of enzyme in glyceryl palmitostearate (T. Pongjanyakul et al, UP, 271 53-62, 2004).<br>
But no attempts have been made to achieve improved storage and operational stability of enzyme using heterogeneous lipid matrix, especially in the tablet form.<br>
Object of invention<br>
The primary objective of the present invention is to develop a heterogeneous matrix system for improved stability of enzyme.<br><br>
Another objective of the invention is to present the heterogeneous matrix in a suitable form depending on its use.<br>
Additionally, the objective of the invention is to maintain it in the vicinity of the lipid and stabilizer.<br>
A further objective of the invention is to develop a heterogeneous matrix containing enzymes, optionally in combination with other active ingredients in the presence of pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
Other objects, aspects and advantages of this invention will become apparent from reading the remaining specification and claims.<br>
Summary of invention:<br>
The present invention provides a heterogeneous matrix system for improved stability of enzyme in different forms like powder, granules, tablet or any other suitable solid dosage form. The heterogeneous matrix system in the form of granules, tablet or powder comprises (a) lipid and stabilizer maintained in the vicinity of enzyme(s), and optionally (b) active(s) and/or inactive ingredients processed by suitable technique.
