				<td>The invention rotates to a fuel pump for delivering fuel into a fuel tank of a motor<br>
vehicle, having a drive impeller rotating in a housing, with rings of guide blade<br>
defining blade chambers arranged on both end faces of the impeller, opposing<br>
blade chambers being connected to one another, with partially annular ducts, which<br>
are arranged in the area of the guide blades in an inlet-side housing part and in an<br>
outlet-side housing part and which together with the blade chambers from a<br>
delivery chamber for delivering a liquid from an inlet duct to an outlet duct, one of<br>
the partially annular ducts being annular ducts to connected to the inlet duct and<br>
the other. The opposing partially annular duct, being connected to the outlet duct.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
Such fuel pumps are known as peripheral or side-channel pumps and are often<br>
used in the fuel tanks of present-day motor vehicles. The partially annular ducts<br>
extend over an angular range of approximately 300 to 330°.<br>
A disadvantage of the known fuel pumps is that vortices occur in the area of the<br>
blade chambers as the delivered liquid flows over. These vortices lead to a low<br>
efficiency of the fuel pump and lead, particularly when delivering hot fuel, to<br>
gassing of the fuel. The gassing leads to a further reduction in the efficiency of the<br>
fuel pump.<br>
A prior DE Patent No. 4427874 discloses an invention " IC engine fuel pump<br>
to reserve tank"<br>
the abstract of which recites the opposing ends of the first and second feed<br>
channels (31,33) standing axial to the feed pump chamber (13) are offset to<br>
one another in the pump wheel sense (9) and the entry end (25) of the first<br>
channel (31) as held in the intake cap (17) is offset from the end of channel<br>
(33) housed in the intermediate cover (21) by a defined amount against the<br>
pump wheel rotation. The outlet (27) end of the second feed channel (33) is<br>
otherwise offset from the axially opposing channel (31) end, again by a<br>
defined amount . The offset of the respective channel ends is obtained by<br>
twisting the cap (17) towards the cover (21) round the rotation axis of the<br>
pump shortening the length of the channels at their ends furthest from the<br>
intake and outlet respectively.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is to design a fuel pump of the type described in the<br>
introductory part so that it has a maximum possible efficiency.<br>
According to the invention this object is achieved in that the partially annular duct<br>
in the inlet-side housing part continuously narrows away from the inlet duct and /<br>
or the partially annular duct in the outlet-side housing part continuously widens<br>
toward the outlet duct, and that the continuous narrowing or widening extends over<br>
at least 80% of the length of the corresponding partially annular duct.<br>
This design allows the liquid being delivered to be continuously transferred from the<br>
partially annular duct in the inlet-side housing part to the partially annular duct in<br>
the outlet-side housing part. This also makes it possible to generate a uniform rise<br>
in pressure increasing toward the outlet duct in the two partially annular housing<br>
parts. This means that there is a uniform flow through the opposing Made<br>
chambers as they move from the inlet duct to the outlet duct. This serves to<br>
prevent the rate of flow as the liquid flows over from one blade chamber into the<br>
opposing Made chambers increasing the closer these Made chambers get to the<br>
outlet duct, as is the case in the known fuel pump. The fuel pump according to the<br>
invention therefore has an especially high efficiency.<br>
Abrupt flow variations in the delivery chamber lead to gassing of the fuel,<br>
particularly when the fuel being delivered is at high temperature. According to<br>
another advantageous further embodiment of the invention such abrupt flow<br>
changes are readily prevented if the narrowing or widening is continuous over the<br>
proposed area of the length of the partially annular duct.<br>
According to another advantageous farther embodiment of the invention the<br>
narrowing or widening of the partially annular ducts is particularly easy to configure<br>
if at least one of the partially annular duct is of wedge shaped design in a section<br>
along the delivery chamber.<br>
In order to further reduce pressure fluctuations in the delivery chamber it is of help,<br>
according to another advantageous further embodiment of the invention, if the<br>
delivery chamber has substantially the same cross-section at any point, the cross-<br>
section of the partially annular duct in the inlet-side housing part being larger in<br>
proximity to the inlet duct than the cross-section of the partially annular duct in the<br>
outlet-side housing part.<br>
The invention permits numerous embodiments. In order to further illustrate its<br>
basic principle, one such embodiment is represented in the drawing and is<br>
described below.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a fuel delivery unit for a motor vehicle having a fuel pump according<br>
to the invention,<br>
Fig. 2 shows a tangential, sectional representation through the fuel pump In the<br>
area of a delivery chamber.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a fuel delivery unit intended to be arranged in a fuel tank of a motor<br>
vehicle and having a housing 1 and a fuel pump 3 in the form of a side-channel<br>
pump driven by an electric motor 2. The fuel pump 3 has an impeller 6 arranged<br>
between an inlet-side housing part 4 and an outlet-side housing part 5. An inlet<br>
duct 7 is ananged in the inlet-side housing part 4 and an outlet duct 8 in the outlet-<br>
side housing part 5. The impeller 6 is fixed on a shaft 9 of the electric motor 2. The<br>
fuel pump 3 has opposing rings of guide blades 11 defining blade chambers 10 on<br>
both end faces of the Impeller 6. The housing parts 4, 5 each have a partially<br>
annular duct 12, 13 in the area of the blade chambers 10. The partially annular<br>
ducts 12,31 together with the blade chambers 10 form a delivery chamber 14<br>
leading from the inlet duct 7 through the impeller 6 to the outlet duct 8. For the<br>
purpose of simplification, the inlet duct 7 and the outlet duct 8 are shown turned<br>
into the plane of projection. As a rule, the delivery chamber 14 extends over an<br>
angular range of approximately 300 to 330°. As the impeller 6 rotates the guide<br>
blades 11 produce a circulatory flow, running transversely to the direction of<br>
movement of the guide blades 11, in the delivery chamber 14. In so doing the<br>
delivered fuel flows over from the inlet-side housing part 4 to the outlet-side<br>
housing part 5 through the interconnected blade chambers 10.<br>
Fig 2, in a tangential section through the fuel pump in Fig. 1 in the area of the<br>
delivery chamber 14, shows that the partially annular duct 12 arranged in the inlet-<br>
side housing part 4 narrows away from the inlet duct 7, viewed in the direction of<br>
flow. The partially annular duct 13 arranged in the outlet-side housing part 5<br>
furthermore widens toward the outlet duct 8 viewed in the direction of flow. In<br>
order to show this more dearly the fuel flows and the direction of movement of the<br>
impeller 6 are identified by arrows in the drawing. The widening and narrowing<br>
extend virtually over the entire length of the partially annular ducts 12, 13 and each<br>
virtually have a wedge shape. The partially annular ducts 12, 13 widen and narrow<br>
to the same degree, so that over the whole area of the partially annular duds 12,<br>
13 the delivery chamber 14 has substantially the same cross-section.<br>
