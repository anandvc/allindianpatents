100-400mg	Convolvulus pluricaulis<br>
The drugs are administered with varying dose schedule and a careful monitoring of the clinical symptomatology presented different results.<br>
On the basis of oral administration of varying dose schedule, the most effective and preferred dose range comprised of:<br>
Centella asiatica	250 - 450 mg<br>
Hippophae salicifolia      300 - 600 mg Convolvulus pluricaulis 150-300 mg<br>
The remainder is optionally known additive to make the required preparation.<br>
Centella asiatica (Mandukparni):<br>
This is a plant commonly known as 'Mandukparni' belonging tq family "Umbelliferae" whose dried whole plant are extracted to collect the<br>
mixture of alkaloids and glycoside compound.   Studies have indicated that it has memory improving and tranquilizing effects.<br>
Hippophae salcipholia (Badriphal)<br>
This plant commonly known as 'Seabuckthorn/Badriphal, belongs to family "Elacagnoceae" whose dried fruit, pulp are extracted to collect the mixture of flnvonoids, glycosidcs and lorpcnic compounds. Various studies have indicated that it improves the behavioural pattern and memory performance. II also enhances The .general body immunity in nine effective manner.<br>
Convolvuls pluricaulis (Shankhpushpi):<br>
This plant is commonly known as ' Shankhpushpi' belongs to family "Convolvulaceae" whose dried leaves and flowers are extracted to collect the alkaloids (shankhapushpine) compound. Several studies have<br>
suggested that mixture possessing is effective in reducing anxiety and |<br>
i<br>
improving the mental functions. It has also hypotensive effects.<br>
The known additives are excipients such as calcium sulphate Example -1:<br>
The preparation containing the organic extract of Centella asiatica administered in the dose of . 3oo "   mg continuously for three months ! to the aged showing cognitive decline, a mild improvement in behavioural I pattern was noticed.  Improvement in sleep pattern was also reported by ' the aged cases.<br>
Example -2:<br>
The preparation containing the organic extract of Hippophae salcifolia administered in the dose of 300mg continuously for 3<br>
months lo the agcd reporting loss of cognitive functions exhibited mild improvement in.short term memory and concentration ability.<br>
Example -3:<br>
The preparation containing the organic extract of Convolvulus pluricaulis administered in continuously for three months in the dose of 200 mg to the ageds complaining loss of cognitive functions exhibited improvement in mental ability and also modified behavioural pattern.<br>
Example -4:<br>
The preparation containing the organic extract of Centella asiatica in the dose of . 250 mg along with organic extract of Hippophae<br>
. )<br>
salcifolia in the dose of  350 mg administered to the ageds showing loss of cognitive function exhibited better mental performance and improvement in early mental fatigue than the earlier.<br>
Example -5:<br>
The preparation containing the organic extract of Centella asiatica in the dose of'.300 mg and Convolvulus pluricaulis in the dose of 200 nig continuously for three months to the ageds of cognitive deficits exhibited better feeling of well being due to reduction in anxiety scores and improved sleep pattern..<br>
Example - 6:<br>
The preparation containing Ihe organic extract of Hippophae salcifolia in the dose of : 400 mg aJong with the organic extract of Convolvulus pluricaulis in the dose of 200mg to the ageds of loss of cognitive functions showed improved body immunity and reduced anxiety and tension resulting in improvement in better mental performance and feeling of well being.<br>
Example - 7:<br>
The preparation containing the organic extract of Centella asitica in the dose of 250 mg., Hippophae salcifolia in the dose of 400mg and Convolvulus pluricaulis in the dose of 250 mg adminstered to the ageds complaining loss of mental performance exerted better results than the before therapy. A better short and long-term memory along with improved concentration ability was noted. The behavioural pattern also improved. A general body immunity and feeling of well being was also important results in this group.<br>
In this formulation the combination of organic extracts of Centella asiatica, Hippophae salicifolia and Convolvulus pluricaulis has been added for the prevention and management of loss of cognitive fucntions among the aged people. Loss of cognitive functions among the ageds is not due to single factor but multiple factors. Centella asiatica increases the protein synthesis in the neurons thus it, prevents the rapid brain tissue loss among the ageds. Hippophae salcifolia having antioxident property prevents the rapid degenerative changes in the brain. The organic extract of Convolvulus pluricaulis improves the short-term memory among the ageds. Anxiety and depression are the main clinical presentation among the ageds whose association showed positive correlation with decline of concentration ability, short and long term memory among the ageds. The combined formulation, by regulating the neurotransmitter modifies the human behavior and thus prevents the cognitive deterioration among the ageds.<br>
As far as the use of single drug in traditional practice the effectivity is minimized significantly and does not cover all the aspects of cognitive deficits.<br>
The herbal formulation is useful for the prevention and management of senile dementia comprises mixture of organic extract of Centella asiatica (Mandukparni), Hippophae salicifolia (Badriphal) and Convolvulus pluricaulis (Shankhapushpi) in a prescribed doses. The proportion of the organic extract of the three herbs was determined on the basis of repeated trials and the effective dose was determined on the basis of therapeutic results. The preferred dose depends upon the therapeutic efficacy of the organic extract in the dose 7'as~.described'-': .' hereiri.. ' T; If the dose given in terms of mg is the weight of the organic extract of the drug found useful in regulating various sign and symptoms of the subjects. The proportion of the organic extract of three plants exerted significant results among the patients suffering from senile dementia and other age related neurological problems. The organic extract of Hippophae salicifolia has shown beneficial effect in the regulation of cholinergic system, which is a marker for ageing brain or senile dementia. Hippophae salicifolia can alone produce significant effects in arresting the ageing process but the mixture of Centella asiatica • ' shows better results by increasing protein synthesis in the cells playing part in memory and cognition. The Convolvulus pluricaulis regulates the various neurotransmitters like 5-HT in the brain. When the formulation is prepared in the specific weight of the organic extract of the three plants it has been observed that the decline in overall cognitive functions may be minimized. If the proportion is altered no beneficial effect could be achieved. The organic extract of single drug Convolvulus pluricaulis exerts effects only on the central nervous system. The administration of single Centella asiatica or Convolvulus pluricaulis has a little effect on the cognitive function but if given in the combination of Hippophae salcifolia the claims can be sustained.<br>
