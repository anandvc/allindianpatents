TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an electronic key system for a motorcycle, which starts an engine only when it is identified that a request is fed from a qualified user as a result of verification of an ID from wireless communication between a transmitter-receiver or a transmitter (electronic key) that the user carries and a control unit mounted on a specific vehicle.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
There are electronic key systems for a specific vehicle as disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2001-349110 and Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2001-249117. In the electronic key systems for a vehicle in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2001-349110 and Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2001-349117, an actuating unit (switch) is installed on the door handle or on the trunk lid of the specific vehicle, and when an user operates (actuates) the actuating unit, communication with the electronic key is starter and an ID transmitted from the electronic key is verified against an ID registered in the control unit. When it is proved that the result showing that the IDs are identical is obtained, the door lock or the like is released.<br>
In the related art, there is also proposed an<br>
electronic key system in which a transmitting antenna is provided on each door of a four-wheeled vehicle, and only the door to which a mobile machine approaches can be unlocked independently of other doors of the specific vehicle (For example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 10-317754).<br>
Furthermore, there is proposed an electronic key system for a motorcycle in which communication between a transmitter-receiver that a user carries and an immobilizer installed on the specific vehicle can be started by inserting a key into a key cylinder installed on the specific vehicle (For example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2001-12123).<br>
When such electronic key system is applied to a motorcycle, an actuating unit corresponding to the actuating unit (switch) which is installed on the door handle of the four-wheeled vehicle must be mounted anywhere on the motorcycle.  In particular, when it is applied to a motorcycle having a storage space for a helmet under an openable and closable seat, considering an actuating operation or an action to taking in and out the helmet of the user or the like, it is desirable to install the actuating unit at the position such as on a seat where the user can naturally access.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
In view of such subject described above, an object of<br>
The present invention is to provide an electronic key system for a motorcycle in which the control unit can be actuated smoothly in a series of operation of the user when riding on the specific vehicle and operability of actuation by the electronic key can be improved.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided an electronic key system for a motorcycle comprising:<br>
a control unit mounted to a specific vehicle;<br>
a mobile transmitter or transmitter-receiver that a user carries;<br>
characterized in that the specific vehicle comprising an openable and closable seat on which the user sits, and a locking unit for locking the seat against an opening operation until an unlock instruction is supplied,<br>
the control unit comprising:<br>
a means for supplying a request signal (Sr) to the mobile transmitter or transmitter-receiver based on a turning-ON operation of a start switch installed in the seat or in the vicinity of the seat;<br>
a means for detecting a response signal (Sa) based on the request signal (Sr) transmitted from the mobile transmitter or transmitter-receiver; and<br>
a means for supplying an unlock instruction to the locking unit when it is identified that a request is fed from a qualified user as a result of verification of the response signal (Sa).<br>
When the user rides on the specific vehicle, the user performs an action to take a helmet stored under the openable and closable seat out. In this case, since the start switch is provided in the seat or in the vicinity of the seat, the start switch can be operated easily by<br>
performing an operation included in a series of operations performed by the user when riding on the specific vehicle, such as pushing a part of the seat, whereby operability is improved.<br>
In addition, since the start switch is provided at the position that cannot be viewed from the outside, the person other than the qualified user cannot find the start switch easily, and thus it is also effective for protecting against theft.<br>
An electronic key system for a motorcycle according to the present invention is the electronic key system for a motorcycle including a control unit mounted to a specific vehicle, and a mobile transmitter that a user carries, the specific vehicle including an openable and closable seat on which the user sits, and a locking unit for locking the seat against the opening operation until an unlock instruction is supplied, the mobile transmitter including a means for supplying a request signal to the control unit based on the user's input, the control unit including a means for receiving a request signal from the mobile transmitter based on a turning-ON operation of a start switch installed in the seat or in the vicinity of the seat, and a means for supplying an unlock instruction to the locking unit when it is identified that a request is fed from a qualified user as a result of verification of the request signal.<br>
In this case as well, the control unit can be actuated smoothly by a series of operations of the user when riding<br><br>
on the specific vehicle, and thus operability of the actuation by the electronic key is improved.<br>
In the invention described above, it is also possible to provide a means for stopping power supply at least to a circuit system of the control unit, which performs communication, when the specific vehicle is not actuated for a predetermined period, and a means for supplying power to the circuit system based on the turning-ON operation of the start switch.<br>
Accordingly, when the specific vehicle is not actuated for a predetermined period, power supply to the communication-related circuit is stopped until the start switch is turned ON subsequently, whereby power consumption during waiting time can significantly be reduced.<br>
In addition, since communication with the outside (communication with the mobile transmitter-receiver or reception of a request signal from the mobile transmitter) is not performed unless the start switch is turned ON, and the start switch cannot be found easily, it is also effective for protecting against theft.<br>
In the invention described above, it is also possible to provide a means for supplying power intermittently at least to the circuit system of the control system, which performs communication, when the specific vehicle is not activated for a predetermined period, and a means for supplying power constantly to the circuit system based on the turning-ON operation of the start switch.<br>
Accordingly, when the specific vehicle is not actuated for a predetermined period, power supply to the communication related circuit is performed intermittently until the start switch is turned ON thereafter, whereby power consumption during waiting time may be reduced.<br>
In the invention described above, an operating element of the start switch may be provided so as to oppose the back surface of the superficial skin of the seat.  In this case, by pressing the portion of the superficial skin of the seat corresponding to the portion where the operating element of the start switch is located, the start switch can easily be turned ON.<br>
Normally, when opening the seat, two actions (two behaviors) including the steps of unlocking the seat by operating the start switch and lifting the seat are necessary. However, by providing the operating element of the start switch so as to oppose the back surface of the superficial skin on the side surface of the seat (including the surface at the back of the seat), the start switch can be operated simultaneously with touching the seat for opening the seat. Therefore, the operation from the operation of the start switch to lifting of the seat can be performed by one behavior, thereby improving usability.<br>
In the invention described above, the start switch may be provided on a handle used at least for manually opening and closing the seat.  In this case, when a helmet stored under the openable and closable seat is taken out, the<br>
action to grip the handle and lift the seat up is performed. When performing this action, the start switch can easily be operated, and thus it is advantageous for improving operability.<br>
In particular, by disposing the start switch on the handle at the position opposing the seat, the start switch may be provided at the position where the user touches naturally when opening the seat, thereby usability is increased.<br>
The above and other objects features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown by way of illustrative example.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Referring now to Fig. 1 to Fig. 14, some embodiments in which an electronic key system for a motorcycle according to the present invention is applied to a scooter will be described.<br>
An electronic key system 10A according to a first embodiment includes, as shown in Fig. 1, a mobile transmitter-receiver 12 that a user carries, and a control unit 14 mounted to a specific vehicle 100A (See Fig. 4) and a specific vehicle 100B (See Fig. 7). The mobile transmitter-receiver 12 includes the one having a key-shape and including the 1C chip integrated therein, or the one having a card-shape and including an 1C chip integrated therein. However, when it is applied mainly as a keyless system, the card-shape is employed.  In this embodiment, the mobile transmitter-receiver 12 of the card-shape is assumed for description.  Since the mobile transmitter-receiver 12 is referred to as electronic key, the mobile transmitter-receiver is referred to as electronic key 12 in the description below.<br>
The electronic key 12 has a card-shape as described above and, as shown in Fig. 2, includes a battery 20, a power supply circuit 22, a CPU 24, a receiving circuit 26, and a transmitting circuit 28.<br>
The power circuit 22 is a circuit for supplying power from the battery 20 to the receiving circuit 26, the transmitting circuit 28, and the CPU 24.  The receiving circuit 26 includes a receiving antenna, not shown, receives<br>
a request signal Sr or the like transmitted from the control unit 14 through the receiving antenna, and takes the signal out from a carrier wave and demodulates the same. The demodulated signal is supplied to the CPU 24. The frequency of the carrier wave of the request signal Sr is from 100 kHz to 300 kHz.<br>
The CPU 24 performs at least two programs (a request signal verifying means 30 and a response signal generating means 32). The request signal verifying means 30 verifies whether or not the signal supplied from the receiving circuit 26 is the request signal Sr, and if it is the request signal Sr, control is transferred to the response signal generating means 32. The response signal generating means 32 reads ID data stored in a ROM, not shown, based on the request from the request signal verifying means 30, adds an attribute indicating response to the ID data, and outputs it to the transmitting circuit 28 as transmitting data Dt. The transmitting circuit 28 includes a transmitting antenna, not shown, modulates the carrier wave based on the transmitting data Dt supplied from the CPU 24, and transmits it as response signal Sa through the transmitting antenna. The frequency of the carrier wave of the response signal Sa is from 200 MHz to 500 MHz.<br>
On the other hand, the control unit 14 mounted to the specific vehicles 100A and 100B is constructed of, for example, a system LSI, and includes a power circuit 40, a CPU 42, a receiving circuit 44, a transmitting circuit 46,<br>
an input circuit 48, a first driving circuit 52 (for driving an actuator) and a second driving circuit 54 (for driving a main relay) as shown in Fig. 3.  In the periphery of the control unit 14, at least a battery 60, a main switch 62, a seat actuator (a driving source of the locking unit) 64, a main relay 66, a start switch 70, a transmitting antenna 72.<br>
The main switch 62 includes two fixed contacts 62a and 62b and one movable contact 62c. And one fixed contact 62a is connected to the battery 60, and the other fixed contact 62b is connected to the main relay 66.<br>
A start switch 70 is connected to the input circuit 48, and the state of ON/OFF of the start switch 70 is supplied to the CPU 42 through the input circuit 48.<br>
In the first embodiment, the scooter as shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 7 are assumed as the specific vehicles 100A and 100B. Each of the specific vehicles 100A and 100B includes a handle 102, a front wheel 104, a rear wheel 106 and, in addition, an openable and closable seat 108 on which the user sits. A space 110 for storing a helmet, not shown, is provided under the seat 108 as shown in Fig 5 and Fig. 8. Normally, when not riding on the specific vehicle, the helmet is stored in the space 110.<br>
A handle 112 (referred to as seat handle 112 for differentiating from the handle 102 used by the driver for steering) to be used at least for manually opening and closing the seat 108 is provided around the rear portion of the seat 108. The seat handle 112 is provided with two bars<br>
(left bar 114L and right bar 114R). The left bar 114L is provided from the left side of the rear portion of a vehicle body 116 along the left side surface of the rear portion of the seat 108, and the right side bar 114R is provided from the right side of the rear portion of the vehicle body 116 along the right side surface of the rear portion of the seat 108.<br>
Then, when the user opens or closes the seat 108, the seat 108 can be opened or closed for example by gripping the left bar 114L and pressing the vehicle body 116 downward.<br>
In the case where the specific vehicles 100A and 100B are build for two, the seat handle 112 is designed so that the person sitting on the rear portion of the seat 108 (not the driver) can grip the seat handle 112 to maintain his/her posture stable when the specific vehicles 100A and 100B are traveling.<br>
In the case where the seat handle 112 is mounted to the rear portion of the seat 108, not on the vehicle body 116, the user can grip, for example, the left bar 114L when the user opens or closes the seat 108.<br>
In the specific vehicle 100A, as shown in Fig. 4 to Fig. 6, the start switch 70 is provided in the seat 108.<br>
More specifically, the seat 108 includes a bottom plate 120 formed, for example, of metal or synthetic resin at the bottom thereof, and urethane material 124 is filled between the bottom plate 120 and a superficial skin 122 as shown in Fig. 6.<br>
The start switch 70 is stored in a storage space 126 formed in the urethane material 124, and a housing 128 of the start switch 70 is fixed to the bottom plate 120 with, for example, a screw, etc. The start switch 70 is installed on, for example, the left side surface inside the seat 108 at the position corresponding to the portion which the user touches when opening the seat 108.<br>
An operating element 70a of the start switch 70 opposes the back surface of a superficial skin 122a on the left side surface of the seat 108. The distance between the distal end of the operating element 70a and the back surface of the superficial skin 122a is determined to such distance that the start switch 70 is turned ON when the user presses the superficial skin 122a on the left side surface of the seat 108 for opening the seat 108.  In the example described above, the case in which the start switch 70 is provided on the left side surface of the seat 108. However, it may be provided either on the right side surface of the seat 108 or on both of the left side surface and the right side surface.<br>
In the specific vehicle 100B, as shown in Fig. 7, the start switch 70 is provided on the handle 112. More specifically, as shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, a recess 130 is formed at the lengthwise center of the left bar 114L and/or the right bar 114R at the position opposing the rear portion of the seat 108, and the start switch 70 is provided in the recess 130, so that the start switch 70 is integrated with the left bar 114L and/or the right bar 114R.<br>
Normally, when gripping, for example, the left bar 114L, the lengthwise center thereof is gripped. However, since the start switch 70 is provided at this position as described above, the hand of the user touches the start switch 70 naturally when operating the seat handle 112.<br>
On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 3, the power circuit 40 in the control unit 14 supplies power from the battery 60 to the CPU 42, the receiving circuit 44, and the transmitting circuit 46.<br>
The receiving circuit 44 has a receiving antenna, not shown, receives a response signal Sa or the like transmitted from the electronic key 12 through the receiving antenna, and takes them out from the carrier wave and demodulates the same. The demodulated signal is supplied to the CPU 42.<br>
The CPU 42 performs at least three programs (a request signal generating means 80, a response signal verifying means 82, and an observing means 84).<br>
The request signal generating means 80 read request data Dr (data which is a source of the request signal Sr) from a ROM, not shown, based on the turning ON operation of the start switch 70, and supplies it to the transmitting circuit 46.<br>
The transmitting circuit 46 modulates the carrier wave based on the request data Dr supplied from the CPU 42 and transmits it through the transmitting antenna 72 as the request signal Sr.<br>
The range in which the request signal Sr can be<br><br>
transmitted is, as shown in Fig. 10A and Fig. 10B, a spherical range of 1 to 1.5 m in radius about the transmitting antenna 72 mounted to the specific vehicles 100A and 100B (range shown by a circle A in Fig. 10A and Fig. 10B), and is smaller than the range in which the response signal Sa can be transmitted (the range of several meters in radius about the electronic key 12).<br>
Therefore, when the scooter is assumed as the specific vehicles 100A and 100B, in order to ensure communication with the electronic key 12 that the user carries when the user rides on the specific vehicle, or when the user is opening the seat 108, it is desired to install the transmitting antenna 72, for example, at the position near the center of the specific vehicles 100A and 100B as shown in Fig. 10A and Fig. 10B.<br>
The position near the center of the specific vehicles 100A and 100B means the area from a point PI, which is at one-fourth of the line segment 140 between the center 104a of the front wheel 104 and the center 106a of the rear wheel 106 to a point P2, which is at three-fourth of the same line segment, for example, from the center 104a of the front wheel 104.  This point is similar even if there is a type of autobicycle which is not illustrated.  In the first embodiment, the transmitting antenna 72 is installed at the position near the front portion of the seat 108.<br>
The response signal verifying means 82 verifies whether or not the signal supplied from the receiving circuit 44 is<br><br>
the response signal Sa, and if it is the response signal Sa, verifies whether or not ID data contained in the response signal Sa is identical to the ID data registered in a memory, not shown.<br>
The observing means 84 observes the presence of arrival of the response signal Sa (whether or not conformity of ID was detected by the response signal verifying means 82) based on the output of the request signal Sr. From the time point when the request data Dr is outputted, the request signal generating means 80 enters into a standby state for waiting input of the response signal Sa. When the response signal Sa arrived within a predetermined time period, it outputs an unlock signal to the first driving circuit 52 and a turning ON signal to the second driving circuit 54.<br>
The first driving circuit 52 drives the actuator 64 based on input of the unlock signal from the CPU 42, and releases the locking state of the handle 102 and the seat 108. With this unlocking operation, steering by the handle 102 is enabled, and the seat 108 is moved slightly upward, so that the user can easily recognized that the handle 102 and the seat 108 are unlocked.<br>
The second driving circuit 54 is turned ON based on input of the turning ON signal from the CPU 42, and then when the main relay 66 is turned ON by the main switch 62 being turned ON, the engine starts and thus the specific vehicle is enabled to travel.<br>
When the main switch 62 is turned OFF, the main relay<br>
66 is also turned OFF and the engine is stopped imultaneously. When the locking operation is performed, or, for example, when the handle 102 and the seat 108 are operated to the locked state, after the helmet is stored in the space 110, under the seat 108, the verification of the response signal Sa in the control unit 14 is stopped, and the second driving circuit 54 is turned OFF.<br>
Referring now to the timing chart shown in Fig. 11A to Fig. HE, a typical processing of the electronic key system 10A according to the first embodiment will be described. Though the request signal Sr is a signal having a pulse train based on the request data Dr, and the response signal Sa is a signal having a pulse train based on data containing ID data, those signal trains are represented as a signal of one pulse in Fig. HA to Fig. HE for the sake of simplification of description.<br>
At the time point tl in Fig. HA, when the start switch 70 is turned ON with the electronic key 12 held by the user, as shown in Fig. lie, a request signal Sr is transmitted from the control unit 14 (see the time point t2), and communication with the electronic key 12 is started.<br>
When the electronic key 12 is held by the user, a request signal Sr is received through the receiving circuit 26 (See Fig. 2) of the electronic key 12.  The electronic key 12 transmits a response signal Sa based on reception of the request signal Sr, as shown in Fig. 11D (See the time point t3). The response signal Sa is supplied to the CPU 42<br>
through the receiving circuit 44 of the control unit 14 (See Fig. 3), and ID data contained in the response signal Sa is verified. When the ID data is determined to be identical, as shown in Fig. HE, the locked state of the handle 102 and the seat 108 is released (unlocked) through the control unit 14 and the first driving circuit 52 (at the time point t4). At this time, the second driving circuit 54 is turned ON.<br>
Subsequently, when the main switch 62 is turned ON at the time point t5 in Fig. 11B, the engine starts and the specific vehicle is enabled to travel.<br>
In this manner, in the electronic key system 10A according to the first embodiment, the start switch 70 is provided in the seat 108 or on the seat handle 112. Normally, when the user rides on the specific vehicle 100A or 100B, an action to take a helmet stored under the openable and closable seat 108 out is performed.  In this case, the action to hold the seat 108 or to grip the seat handle 112 and lift the seat 108 up is performed. When performing this action, the start switch 70 can easily be operated. Therefore, operability regarding starting of the electronic key system 10A may be improved.<br>
In addition, since the start switch 70 is provided at the position which cannot be viewed from the outside, the person other then the qualified user cannot find the start switch 70 easily, and thus it is also effective for protecting against theft.<br>
In the specific vehicle 100A, since the operating<br>
element 70a of the start switch 70 is provided so as to oppose the back surface of the superficial skin 122 of the seat 108, the start switch 70 can easily be operated by pressing the portion of the superficial skin 122 of the seat 108 corresponding to the portion where the operating element 70a of the start switch 70 is located.<br>
In other words, when opening the seat 108, two actions (two behaviors) including the steps of unlocking the seat 108 by operating the start switch 70 and lifting the seat 108 are necessary. However, since the operating element 70a of the start switch 70 is provided so as to oppose the back surface of the superficial skin 122a, for example, of the left side surface of the seat 108, the start switch 70 can be operated simultaneously with touching the seat 108 for opening the seat 108. Therefore, the operation from the operation of the start switch 70 to lifting of the seat 108 can be performed by one behavior, thereby improving usability.<br>
On the other hand, in the specific vehicle 100B, since the start switch 70 in particular is provided at the lengthwise center of the left bar 114L and/or the right bar 114R at the position opposing the seat 108, the form in which the start switch 70 is provided at the position where the user touches naturally when opening the seat 108 is achieved, thereby usability is improved.<br>
Since the recess 130 is formed on the lengthwise center of the left bar 114L and/or the right bar 114R at the<br>
position opposing the rear portion of the seat 108, and the start switch 70 is provided in the recess 130, so that the start switch 70 is integrated with the left bar 114L and/or the right bar 114R, advantages such as downsizing, lightweight, and low cost maybe obtained.<br>
In addition, since the seat handle 112 can be mounted to the vehicle body 116 after assembly, it is not necessary to modify the configuration of the vehicle body 116 or the wiring route significantly for providing the start switch 70. Therefore, the control unit 14 can be mounted only by slight modification in design, which is advantageous in terms of costs.<br>
The start switch 70 employed may be a mechanical contact type as described above, or may be a capacitance touch switch, or a switch employing a principle of piezoelectric device or a switch utilizing a Hall element.<br>
Subsequently, referring to Fig. 12 and Fig. 13, an electric key system 10B according to a second embodiment will be described. Members or units corresponding to Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 are represented by the same reference numerals and will not be described again.<br>
An electronic key 12 of the electronic key system 10B according to the second embodiment is, as shown in Fig. 12, constructed in almost the same manner as the electronic key 12 according to the first embodiment (See Fig. 2), but differs in that an operating switch 150 is provided.<br>
A CPU 24 performs at least one program (a request<br>
signal generating means 152). The request signal generating means 152 is activated based on the turning ON operation of the operating switch 150, reads ID data stored in a ROM, not shown, adds an attribute indicating response to the ID data, and outputs it to a transmitting circuit 28 as transmitting data Dt. The transmitting circuit 28 includes a transmitting antenna, not shown, modulates a carrier wave based on the transmitting data Dt supplied from the CPU 24, and transmits it to a request signal Sq through the transmitting antenna. The frequency of the carrier wave of the request signal Sq is from 200 MHz to 500 MHz.<br>
On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 13, a control unit 14 mounted on the specific vehicles 100A and 100B has substantially the same construction as the control unit 14 according to the first embodiment (See Fig. 3) described above, but differs in that the transmitting circuit 46 and the transmitting antenna 72 do not exist, in that a switching circuit 160 for selectively stopping supply of electric power to the receiving circuit 44, and in that a switching control circuit 154 for outputting a turning ON signal So and an intermittent pulse signal Sk to the switching circuit 160 to control ON and OFF the switching circuit 160 is provided.<br>
The receiving circuit 44 includes a receiving antenna, not shown, receives a request signal Sq or the like transmitted from the electronic key 12 through the receiving antenna, takes them out from the carrier wave and<br>
demodulates the same. The demodulated signal is supplied to the CPU 42.<br>
The CPU 42 performs at least three programs (a request signal verifying means 156, an observing means 84, and a timer means 158).<br>
The request signal verifying means 156 verifies whether or not the signal supplied from the receiving circuit 44 is the request signal Sq, and when it is the request signal Sq, verifies whether or not ID data included in the request signal Sq is identical to the ID data registered in a memory, not shown.<br>
The observing means 84 observes the presence of arrival of the request signals Sq (whether or not conformity of ID was detected by the request signal verifying means 156). When the request signal Sq from the electronic key 12 that the qualified user carries is detected, an unlocking signal is supplied to the first driving circuit 52 to release the locked state of the handle 102 and the seat 108, and the second driving circuit 54 is turned ON. Subsequently, when the main relay 66 is turned ON by the main switch 62 being turned ON, the engine starts and the specific vehicle is enabled to travel.<br>
When the main switch 62 is turned OFF, the main relay 66 is also turned OFF and thus the engine is stopped simultaneously. At this time, the second driving circuit 54 is turned OFF.<br>
The timer means 158 outputs a continuation instruction<br>
signal Sc to the switching control circuit 154 when the start switch 70 is turned ON, during a period in which the main switch 62 is in ON-state, and during a period from the time point when the main switch 62 is turned OFF to the time point when the timer means 158 counts a predetermined value.<br>
When timer means 158 also outputs an intermittent instruction signal Sp to the switching control circuit 154 at the stage where it started to count a reference clock supplied from a clock generator, not shown, from the time point when the main switch 62 is turned OFF, and counted to a predetermined value (for example, at the state where a period of two days, a week, and so on have elapsed).<br>
The switching control circuit 154 outputs the turning ON signal So to the switching circuit 160 during period in which the continuation instruction signal Sc is supplied from the timer means 158. The switching circuit 160 turns a switch 162 ON based on the turning ON signal So supplied, and accordingly, power supply to the receiving circuit 44 is constantly continued.<br>
At the time point when the intermittent instruction signal Sp is supplied from the timer means 158, the switching control circuit 154 generates an intermittent pulse signal Sk of which the attribute is switched to ON and OFF intermittently and output it to the switching circuit 160. The switching circuit 160 repeats ON operation and OFF operation based on the supplied intermittent pulse signal Sk. Accordingly, power supply to the receiving circuit 44 is<br>
made intermittently and thus the control unit 14 is transferred to a power saving mode.<br>
When the start switch 70 is turned ON in this power saving mode, the continuation instruction signal Sc is output to the switching control circuit 154 from the timer means 158, whereby power supply to the receiving circuit 44 is constantly continued.<br>
In the electronic key system 10B according to the second embodiment, when the specific vehicles 100A and 100B are not actuated for a predetermined period, power supply to the receiving circuit 44 is made intermittently until the start switch 70 is turned ON thereafter.  Therefore, power consumption during standby may be reduced.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 14, an electronic key system IOC according to a third embodiment will be described. The members and units corresponding to Fig. 13 will be represented by the same reference numerals and will not be described again.<br>
An electronic key 12 used in the electronic key system IOC according to the third embodiment is the same as the electronic key 12 according to the second embodiment described above (See Fig. 12).<br>
A control unit 14 has substantially the same construction as the control unit 14 according to the second embodiment (See Fig. 13), but differs in that a turning ON signal So and a turning OFF signal Sf are supplied from a switching control circuit 154.<br>
In other words, a timer means 158 outputs a<br>
continuation instruction signal Sc to the switching control circuit 154 when a start switch 70 is turned ON, during a period in which a main switch 62 is in ON-state, and during a period from the time point when the main switch 62 is turned OFF to the time point when the timer means 158 counts a predetermined value.<br>
The timer means 158 also outputs a stop instruction signal Ss to the switching control circuit 154 at the stage where it started to count a reference clock supplied from a clock generator, not shown, from the time point when the main switch 62 is turned OFF, and counted to a predetermined value.<br>
The switching control circuit 154 outputs the turning ON signal So to the switching circuit 160 during period in which the continuation instruction signal Sc is supplied from the timer means 158, and accordingly, power supply to the receiving circuit 44 is constantly continued.<br>
At the time point when the stop instruction signal Ss is supplied from the timer means 158, the switching control circuit 154 supplies a turning OFF signal Sf.  The switching circuit 160 turns the switch 162 OFF based on the supplied turning OFF signal Sf, whereby power supply to the receiving circuit 44 is completely stopped.<br>
When the start switch 70 is turned ON during a period in which power supply to the receiving circuit 44 is stopped, the continuation instruction signal Sc is supplied from the<br>
timer means 158 to the switching control circuit 154, whereby power supply to the receiving circuit 44 is constantly continued.<br>
In the electronic key system IOC according to the third embodiment, when the specific vehicles 100A and 100B are not actuated for a predetermined period, power supply to the receiving circuit 44 is not performed at all until the start switch 70 is turned ON thereafter.  Therefore, power consumption during standby can be significantly reduced.<br>
In addition, it is also effective for protecting against theft because communication with the outside (communication with the electronic key 12) is not performed unless the predetermined start switch 70 is turned ON, and the start switch 70 cannot be found by the person other than the qualified user.<br>
