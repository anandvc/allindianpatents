				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
    Field of the Invention<br>
The invention is directed to quinolinone-carboxamide compounds which are useful as 5-HT4 receptor agonists. The invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds, methods of using such compounds for treating or preventing medical conditions mediated by 5-HT4 receptor activity, and processes and 20    intermediates useful for preparing such compounds.<br>
State of the Art<br>
Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is a neurotransmitter that is widely distributed throughout the body, both in the central nervous system and in peripheral<br>
   systems. At least seven subtypes of serotonin receptors have been identified and the interaction of serotonin with these different receptors is linked to a wide variety of physiological functions. There has been, therefore, substantial interest in developing therapeutic agents that target specific 5-HT receptor subtypes.<br>
In particular, characterization of 5-HT4 receptors and identification of<br>
   pharmaceutical agents that interact with them has been the focus of significant recent activity. (See, for example, the review by Langlois and Fischmeister, J. Med. Chem. 2003, 46, 319-344.) 5-HT4 receptor agonists are useful for the treatment of disorders of reduced motility of the gastrointestinal tract. Such disorders include irritable bowel syndrome (DBS), chronic constipation, functional dyspepsia, delayed gastric emptying,<br>
    gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), gastroparesis, post-operative ileus, intestinal<br><br>
pseudo-obstruction, and drug-induced delayed transit. In addition, it has been suggested that some 5-HT4 receptor agonist compounds may be used in the treatment of central nervous system disorders including cognitive disorders, behavioral disorders, mood disorders, and disorders of control of autonomic function.<br>
	Despite the broad utility of pharmaceutical agents modulating 5-HT4 receptor<br>
activity, few 5-HT4 receptor agonist compounds are in clinical use at present. One agent,<br>
cisapride, that was utilized extensively for treatment of motility disorders of the<br>
gastrointestinal tract was withdrawn from the market, reportedly due to cardiac side<br>
effects. Late stage clinical trials of another agent, prucalopride, have been suspended.<br>
	Accordingly, there is a need for new 5-HT4 receptor agonists that achieve their<br>
desired effects with minimal side effects. Preferred agents may possess, among other properties, improved selectivity, potency, pharmacokinetic properties, and/or duration of action.<br>
	SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides novel compounds that possess 5-HT4 receptor agonist activity. Among other properties, compounds of the invention have been found to be potent and selective 5-HT4 receptor agonists. In addition, compounds of the invention have been found to exhibit favorable pharmacokinetic properties which are predictive of 20    good bioavailability upon oral administration.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides a compound of formula (I):<br><br>
CO<br>
wherein:<br>
	R1 is hydrogen, halo, hydroxy, Chalky!, or<br>
R2 is Cs^alkyl, or R3 is hydrogen or R4 is —S(0)2R6 or —C(O)R7;<br><br>

or, R5 and R6 taken together form Ca^alkylenyl; and<br>
	R7 is hydrogen, Chalky!, or pyridyl;<br>
or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt or solvate or stereoisomer thereof.<br>
The invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the invention and a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier.<br>
The invention also provides a method of treating a disease or condition associated   with 5-HT4 receptor activity, e.g. a disorder of reduced motility of the gastrointestinal tract, the method comprising administering to the mammal, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention.<br>
Further, the invention provides a method of treating a disease or condition associated with 5-HT4 receptor activity in a mammal, the method comprising   administering to the mammal, a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention.<br>
The compounds of the invention can also be used as research tools, i.e. to study biological systems or samples, or for studying the activity of other chemical compounds. Accordingly, in another of its method aspects, the invention provides a method of using a  compound of formula (I), or a phannaceutically acceptable salt or solvate or stereoisomer thereof, as a research tool for studying a biological system or sample or for discovering new 5-HT4 receptor agonists, the method comprising contacting a biological system or sample with a compound of the invention and determining the effects caused by the compound on the biological system or sample.<br>
	In separate and distinct aspects, the invention also provides synthetic processes<br>
and intermediates described herein, which are useful for preparing compounds of the invention.<br>
The invention also provides a compound of the invention as described herein for use in medical therapy, as well as the use of a compound of the invention in the     manufacture of a formulation or medicament for treating a disease or condition associated with 5-HT4 receptor activity, e.g. a disorder of reduced motility of the gastrointestinal tract, in a mammal.<br><br>

Optimum reaction conditions may vary wife the particular reactants or solvent used, but<br>
   such conditions can be determined by one skilled in the art by routine optimization procedures.<br>
Additionally, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, conventional protecting groups may be necessary to prevent certain functional groups from undergoing undesired reactions. The choice of a suitable protecting group for a particular functional group, as<br>
    well as suitable conditions for protection and deprotection, are well known in the art. For example, numerous protecting groups, and their introduction and removal, are described in T. W. Greene and G. M. Wuts, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Edition, Wiley, New York, 1999, and references cited therein.<br>
In one method of synthesis, compounds of formula (I) are prepared as illustrated in<br>
    Scheme A. (The substituents and variables shown in the following schemes have the definitions provided above unless otherwise indicated).<br><br><br>
Scheme A<br>
hi Scheme A, L represents a leaving group such as chloro, bronio, iodo, or ethoxy, or the<br>
reagent L—R4 is the carboxylic acid HO-C(O)R7, i.e. L formally represents hydroxy.<br>
	Optimal reaction conditions for the reaction of Scheme A may vary depending on<br>
the chemical properties of the reagent L—R4, as is well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
For example, when L is a halo leaving group, such as chloro, the reaction is typically conducted by contacting intermediate (ID) with between about 1 and about 4 equivalents of a compound of formula L—R4 in an inert diluent, such as dichloromethane,<br>
   in the presence of an excess of base, for example between about 3 and about 6<br>
equivalents, of base, such as A^-diisopropylethylamine or l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU). Suitable inert diluents also include TV^V-dimethylformamide, trichloromethane, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, tetrahydrofuran, and the like. The reaction is typically conducted at a temperature in the range of about -100 °C to about 30 °C for<br>
    about a quarter hour to about 2 hours, or until the reaction is substantially complete. Exemplary reagents L—R4 in which L is chloro include methanesulfonylchloride and acetylchloride.<br>
When the reagent L—R4 is a carboxylic acid, Scheme A represents an amide coupling reaction which is typically conducted by contacting intermediate (in) with<br>
    between about 1 and about 4 equivalents of a compound of a carboxylic acid L—R in an inert diluent, for example, AyV-dimethylformamide, in the presence of a coupling agent such as benzotriazol-1-yloxytripyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBop). The reaction is typically conducted at ambient temperature, for about a quarter hour to about 2 hours, or until the reaction is substantially complete. Suitable alternative<br>
   coupling agents include 1,3 dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), l-(3-<br>
dimethylaniinopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide (BDC), and PyBop combined with 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole (HOAt).<br>
The amide coupling of intermediate (10) with the carboxylic acid L—R4<br>
alternatively can be performed by converting L—R4 to an activated ester, such as an<br>
11<br><br>
**<br>
.AT-hydroxy succmimide (NHS) ester or ap-nitrophenyl ester, or an acid imidazole, which<br>
is then reacted with intermediate (LET).<br>
Alternatively, when the reagent L—R4 is a liquid, for example ethyl formate, the reaction can be performed by dissolving (ID) in a large excess of the reagent L—R4, and 5    heating to a temperature of between about 50 °C and about 100 °C for about 12 to about 24 hours.<br>
The product of formula (I) is isolated and purified by conventional procedures. For example, the product can be concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure, taken up in an aqueous weak acid solution and purified by HPLC chromatography.<br>
10	Alternatively, compounds of formula (I) can be prepared by JV-alkylating a<br>
compound of formula (I) in which R2 is hydrogen, which can be prepared according to Scheme A. The AT-alkylation reaction is typically conducted by contacting a compound of formula (I) in which R2 is hydrogen with between about 1 and about 4 equivalents of a compound of the formula L'—R2 in which L' is a leaving group such as iodo or brorno.<br>
15    This reaction is typically conducted in a polar aprotic solvent such as dimethylfbrmamide in the presence of between about 2 and about 4 equivalents of strong base, such as potassium terf-butoxide. Typically, the reaction is performed at a temperature of between about 60 °C and about 100 °C for between about 6 and about 24 hours, or until the reaction is substantially complete.<br>
20	In yet another alternative, compounds of formula (I) in which R1 is other than<br>
hydrogen are prepared by conventional processes from compounds of formula (I) in which R1 is hydrogen.<br>
Intermediates of formula (EOT) are prepared from readily available starting materials. For example, when the carbon bearing the substituent —OR3 is not chiral, an<br>
25    intermediate of formula (ffi) is prepared by the procedure illustrated in Scheme B.<br>

Scheme B<br><br>
where L1 independently represents a halo leaving group such as bromo, chloro, or iodo. A negatively-charged counterion is also present associated with the positively-charged 5    intermediate (V) or (V1).<br>
First, an intermediate of formula (IV) is reacted with an oxirane compound, for example, 2-bromomethyloxirane (commonly, epibromohydrin) to form an azetidine salt of formula (V). This reaction is typically conducted by contacting (IV) with between about 2 and about 4 equivalents of 2-bromomethyloxirane in a polar diluent, such as 10    ethanol. The reaction is typically conducted at ambient temperature for between about 24 and about 48 hours or until the reaction is substantially complete.<br>
It will be understood that in the process of Scheme B and in other processes described below using intermediate (IV), intermediate (IV) can be supplied in the form of the freebase or in a salt form, with appropriate adjusment of reaction conditions, as 15    necessary, as known to those skilled in the art.   *<br>
An intermediate of formula (V1), in which R3 is Ci-salkyl, can be prepared by contacting intermediate (V) with from slightly less than one equivalent to about one<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2005/100350	PCT/TJS2005/011393<br>
%r equivalent of a compound of formula L'—R3, where R3 is Ci_3alkyl, in an inert diluent in<br>
the presence of between about 1 and about 3 equivalents of a strong base, such as potassium terf-butoxide or sodium hydride. The reaction is typically conducted at ambient temperature for between about a quarter hour to an hour, or until the reaction is 5    substantially complete. Suitable inert diluents include dichloromethane, trichloromethane, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, and the like.<br>
Next, the azetidine intermediate (V) or (V1) is reacted with an amine of the formula EySIR5 to provide the intermediate (HI). Typically, the azetidine intermediate is dissolved in an inert diluent, such as ethanol, and contacted with between about 1 and<br>
10    about 8 equivalents of the amine H2NR5. For example, when the amine EySTR5 is a volatile reagent, such as methylamine, preferably, between about 5 and about 7 equivalents of the amine are used. The reaction is typically conducted at a temperature of between about 50 °C and about 100 °C for between about 12 and about 24 hours or until the reaction is substantially complete.<br>
15	An intermediate of formula (DT) in which R5 is hydrogen, can be prepared from<br>
the azetidine intermediate (V) or (V1) using ammonium formate in place of ammonia, i.e. in place of the reagent EkNR5 indicated in Scheme B. Alternatively, to prepare intermediate (HT) where R5 is hydrogen, the azetidine ring of (V) or (V) can be opened by reaction with an azide, such as sodium azide, which is then followed by a reduction<br>
20    reaction to provide intermediate (HT), or the ring can be opened by reaction with ammonium hydroxide.<br>
As described in detail in Example 4a, when R3 and R5 are hydrogen and the carbon bearing the substituent —OR3 is not chiral, an intermediate of formula (HI) can be prepared by reacting intermediate (IV) with an oxiranyhnethyl compound having a<br>
25    protected nitrogen atom and then deprotecting. One useful reagent is 2-oxiranylmethyl-isoindole-l,3-dione, commonly epoxypropylphthalimide, which is reacted with intermediate (TV) to form an intermediate in which aphthalimidyl-substituted 2-hydroxy<br>

WO 2005/100350	PCT/US2005/011393<br>
is joined to the nitrogen of the azabicylcooctane ring of formula (IV). The phthalimidyl group is then removed by refluxing in hydrazine to form an intermediate of formula (ID) in which R3 and R5 are hydrogen.<br>
An intermediate of formula (Tfl) in which R3 and R5 are hydrogen can also be prepared by reaction of the azetidine (V) with the anion of phthahmide and subsequent treatment with hydrazine.<br>
In an alternative method of synthesis, an intermediate of formula (HT) in which R3 is hydrogen, can be prepared by reaction of intermediate (TV) with a protected intermediate (VI):<br>
10	OH   R5<br>
(VI)<br>
followed by a deprotection step. In formula (VT), P1 is an amino-protecting group, L' is a halo leaving group, and the asterisk denotes a chiral center. The process utilizing an intermediate of formula (VI) is useful for preparing forms of intermediate (IH) in which<br>
1 5    the stereochemistry at the center marked by the aserisk is specifically (R) or (5) as well as for preparing non-chiral forms of intermediate (HI).<br>
Typically, intermediate (IV) is contacted with between about 1 and about 2 equivalents of intermediate (VI) in a polar diluent, such as methanol, in the presence of more than one equivalent of a base, such as JV^-diisopropylethylamine. The reaction is<br>
20    typically conducted at a temperature of between about 60 °C and about 100 °C for<br>
between about 12 and about 24 hours, or until the reaction is substantially complete. The protecting group P1 is removed by standard procedures to provide an intermediate of formula (in). A useful protecting group P1 is Boc, which is typically removed by treatment with an acid, such as trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
25	In yet another alternative process for the preparation of intermediate QJL),<br>
intermediate (VI) can first be converted to a cyclized form (VTT):<br>
d      R5 (VH)<br>
before reaction with intermediate (TV) to provide intermediate (HI). Intermediate (VH) is 30    typically prepared by dissolving intermediate (VI) in an inert diluent, for example,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, in the presence of base, for example sodium hydroxide. The reaction of<br>

AVO 2005/100350<br><br>
PCT/US2005/011393<br><br>
(VTI) with (TV) to provide intermediate (DT) is typically performed by contacting intermediate (TV) with between about 1 and about 4 equivalents of intermediate (VH) in a polar diluent, such as methanol. The reaction is typically conducted at a temperature of between about 60 °C to about 100 °C for between about 1 and about 4 hours, or until the 5    reaction is substantially complete. The protecting group P1 is removed by standard procedures to provide an intermediate of formula (IH).<br>
The protected intermediate (VI) can be prepared from an oxirane as illustrated in Scheme C for the particular example of forming a Boc-protected chiral intermediate (VI1) using a chiral oxirane. The reaction is equally useful for the preparation of non-chiral 10    compounds of formula (VI).<br>

As shown in Scheme C, abenzylamine 2 is contacted with at least one equivalent of a cliiral oxirane 1 in a non-polar diluent such as hexane or toluene to form the 2-hydroxypropylamine 3. The reaction is typically conducted at room temperature for 15    between about 12 and about 24 hours, or until the reaction is substantially complete. The intermediate 3 is typically reacted with a slight excess of di-ter?-butyl dicarbonate (commonly (Boc)2O), for example, about 1.1 equivalents, under a hydrogen atmosphere in the presence of a transition metal catalyst to provide the Boc protected intermediate (VI'). The reaction is typically conducted at ambient temperature for between about 8 to about 24 hours.<br>

¥ ihe protected aminoazabicyclooctane, or commonly, aminotropane 5 is first reacted with<br>
the substituted quinolinone carboxylic acid (VET). Typically, this reaction is conducted by first converting (VET) to an acid chloride by contacting (VTH) with at least one equivalent, preferably between about 1 and about 2 equivalents of an activating agent, 5    such as thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride in an aromatic diluent, such as toluene,<br>
benzene, xylene, or the like. The reaction is typically conducted at a temperature ranging from about 80 °C to about 120 °C for about 15 minutes to about 4 hours, or until the reaction is substantially complete.<br>
The acid chloride solution is typically added to a biphasic mixture of about 1<br>
10    equivalent of the aminotropane 5 to form a protected intermediate, which is extracted by standard procedures. The biphasic mixture of 5 is generally prepared by dissolving 5 in an aromatic diluent, such as used above, and adding an aqueous solution containing an excess of base, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, preferably about 2 to 5 equivalents of base.<br>
15	Alternatively, the amide coupling of intermediate 5 with the carboxylic acid (VET)<br>
can be performed in the presence of a coupling agent such as 1,3 dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), 1 -(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC), or benzotriazol-1-yloxytripyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBop), optionally combined with l-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole (HOAt), as described<br>
20    above for the amide coupling of intermediate (in) with a carboxylic acid. In yet another alternative, the amide coupling of intermediate 5 with the carboxylic acid (VET) can be performed by converting (VTO) to an activated ester, also described above.<br>
The protecting group P1 is removed by standard procedures to provide an intermediate of formula (IV). For example when the protecting group is Boc, typically<br>
25    removal is by treatment with an acid, such as trifluoroacetic acid, providing the acid salt of the intermediate. The acid salt of intermediate (TV) can be converted to the free base, if desired, by conventional treatment with base. The protecting group Cbz, for another example, is conveniently removed by hydrogenolysis over a suitable metal catalyst such as palladium on carbon.<br>

As described in detail in Example la below, to prepare the protected intermediate 5', first, 2,5-dimethoxy tetrahydrofuran 6 is contacted with between about 1 and 2 equivalents, preferably about 1.5 equivalents of benzyl arnine and a slight excess, for 5    example about 1.1 equivalents, of 1,3-acetonedicarboxylic acid 7 in an acidic aqueous solution in the presence of a buffering agent such as sodium hydrogen phosphate. The reaction mixture is heated to between about 60 and about 100 °C to ensure decarboxylation of any carboxylated intermediates in the product, 8-benzyl-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-3-one 8, commonly ]V-benzyltropanone.<br>
1 0	The intermediate 8 is typically reacted with a slight excess of di-te?Y-butyl<br>
dicarbonate (commonly (Boc^O), for example, about 1.1 equivalents, under a hydrogen atmosphere in the presence of a transition metal catalyst to provide the Boc protected intermediate 9, 3-oxo-8-azabicyclo[3,2.1]octane-8-carboxylic acid te?t-butyl ester. The reaction is typically conducted at ambient temperature for about 12 to about 72 hours.<br>
15    Finally, intermediate 9 is contacted with a large excess, for example at least about 25<br>
equivalents, of ammonium formate in an inert diluent, such as methanol, in the presence of a transition metal catalyst to provide the product 5'in the endo configuration with Mgh stereospecificity, for example endo to exo ratio of &gt;99:1 . The reaction is typically conducted at ambient temperature for about 12 to about 72 hours or until the reaction is<br>
20    substantially complete. It is advantageous to add the ammonium formate reagent in portions. For example, intermediate 9 is contacted with an initial portion of ammonium formate of about 15 to about 25 equivalents. After an interval of about 12 to about 36 hours, an additional portion of about 5 to about 10 equivalents of ammonium formate is added. The subsequent addition can be repeated after a similar interval. The product 5'<br>
25    can be purified by conventional procedures, such as alkaline extraction.<br>

^(rug-induced delayed transit. In addition, it has been suggested that some 5-HT4 receptor<br>
agonist compounds may be used in the treatment of central nervous system disorders<br>
including cognitive disorders, behavioral disorders, mood disorders, and disorders of<br>
control of autonomic function.<br>
5	hi particular, the compounds of the invention increase motility of the<br>
gastrointestinal (GI) tract and thus are expected to be useful for treating disorders of the GI tract caused by reduced motility in mammals, including humans. Such GI motility disorders include, by way of illustration, chronic constipation, constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (C-IBS), diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis, and functional<br>
10    dyspepsia.<br>
hi one aspect, therefore, the invention provides a method of increasing motility of the gastrointestinal tract in a mammal, the method comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier and a compound of the invention.<br>
15	When used to treat disorders of reduced motility of the GI tract or other conditions<br>
mediated by 5-HT4 receptors, the compounds of the invention will typically be administered orally in a single daily dose or in multiple doses per day, although other forms of administration may be used. The amount of active agent administered per dose or the total amount administered per day will typically be determined by a physician, in<br>
20    the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered and its relative activity, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like.<br>
Suitable doses for treating disorders of reduced motility of the GI tract or other<br>
25    disorders mediated by 5-HT4 receptors will range from about 0.0007 to about<br>
20 mg/kg/day of active agent, including from about 0.0007 to about 1 mg/kg/day. For an average 70 kg human, this would amount to from about 0.05 to about 70 mg per day of active agent.<br>
hi one aspect of the invention, the compounds of the invention are used to treat<br>
30    chronic constipation. When used to treat chronic constipation, the compounds of the invention will typically be administered orally in a single daily dose or in multiple doses per day. Preferably, the dose for treating chronic constipation will range from about 0.05<br>

irritable bowel syndrome. When used to treat constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, the compounds of the invention will typically be administered orally in a single daily dose or in multiple doses per day. Preferably, the dose for treating constipation-5    predominant irritable bowel syndrome will range from about 0.05 to about 70 mg per day. hi another aspect of the invention, the compounds of the invention are used to treat diabetic gastroparesis. When used to treat diabetic gastroparesis, the compounds of the invention will typically be administered orally in a single daily dose or in multiple doses per day. Preferably, the dose for treating diabetic gastroparesis will range from about 0.05 10    to about 70 mg per day.<br>
hi yet another aspect of the invention, the compounds of the invention are used to treat functional dyspepsia. When used to treat functional dyspepsia, the compounds of the invention will typically be administered orally in a single daily dose or in multiple doses per day. Preferably, the dose for treating functional dyspepsia will range from about 0.05 15    to about 70 mg per day.<br>
The invention also provides a method of treating a mammal having a disease or condition associated with 5-HT4 receptor activity, the method comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention or of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the invention.<br>
20	As described above, compounds of the invention are 5-HT4 receptor agonists. The<br>
invention further provides, therefore, a method of agonizing a 5-HT4 receptor in a mammal, the method comprising administering a compound of the invention to the mammal, hi addition, the compounds of the invention are also useful as research tools for investigating or studying biological systems or samples having 5-HT4 receptors, or for 25    discovering new 5-HT4 receptor agonists. Moreover, since compounds of the invention exhibit binding selectivity for 5-HT4 receptors as compared with binding to receptors of other 5-HT subtypes, particularly 5-HT3 receptors, such compounds are particularly useful for studying the effects of selective agonism of 5-HT4 receptors in a biological system or sample. Any suitable biological system or sample having 5-HT4 receptors may be 30     employed in such studies which may be conducted either in vitro or in vivo.<br>
Representative biological systems or samples suitable for such studies include, but are not limited to, cells, cellular extracts, plasma membranes, tissue samples, mammals (such as<br>
mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, pigs, etc.) and the like.<br>

^	In this aspect of the invention, a biological system or sample comprising a 5-HT4<br>
receptor is contacted with a 5-HT4 receptor-agonizing amount of a compound of trie invention. The effects of agonizing the 5-HT4 receptor are then determined using conventional procedures and equipment, such as radioligand binding assays and 5     functional assays. Such functional assays include ligand-mediated changes in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), ligand-mediated changes in activity of the enzyme adenylyl cyclase (which synthesizes cAMP), ligand-mediated changes in incorporation of analogs of guanosine triphosphate (GTP), such as [35S]GTPyS (guanosine 5'-O-(y-thio)triphosphate) or GTP-Eu, into isolated membranes via receptor 10    catalyzed exchange of GTP analogs for GDP analogs, ligand-mediated changes in free intracellular calcium ions (measured, for example, with a fluorescence-linked imaging plate reader or FLEPR® from Molecular Devices, Inc.), and measurement of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. A compound of the invention may agonize or increase the activation of 5-HT4 receptors in any of the functional assays listed above, 15     or assays of a similar nature. A 5-HT4 receptor-agonizing amount of a compound of the invention will typically range from about 1 nanomolar to about 500 nanomolar.<br>
Additionally, the compounds of the invention can be used as research tools for discovering new 5-HT4 receptor agonists. In this embodiment, 5-HT4 receptor binding or functional data for a test compound or a group of test compounds is compared to the 20    5-HT4 receptor binding or functional data for a compound of the invention to identify test compounds that have superior binding or functional activity, if any. This aspect of the invention includes, as separate embodiments, both the generation of comparison data (using the appropriate assays) and the analysis of the test data to identify test compounds of interest.<br>
25	Among other properties, compoimds of the invention have been found to be potent<br>
agonists of the 5-HT4 receptor and to exhibit substantial selectivity for the 5-HT4 receptor subtype over the S-HTs receptor subtype in radioligand binding assays. Further, compounds of the invention have demonstrated superior pharmacokinetic properties in a rat model. Compounds of the invention are thus expected to be highly bioavailable upon 30    oral administration. In addition, these compounds have been shown not to exhibit an unacceptable level of inhibition of the potassium ion current in an in vitro voltage-clamp model using isolated whole cells expressing the hERG cardiac potassium channel. The<br>
voltage-clamp assay is an accepted pre-clinical method of assessing the potential for<br>
34<br><br>
WO 2005/100350	PCT/US2005/011393<br>
pharmaceutical agents to change the pattern of cardiac repolarization, specifically to cause, so-called QT prolongation, which has been associated with cardiac arrhythmia. , (Cavero et al., Opinion on Pharmacotherapy, 2000,1, 947-73, Fermini et a/., Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, 2003, 2, 439-447) Accordingly, pharmaceutical compositions 5    comprising compounds of the invention are expected to have an acceptable cardiac profile.<br>
There properties, as well as the utility of the compounds of the invention, can be demonstrated using various in vitro and in vivo assays well-known to those skilled in the art. Representative assays are described in further detail in the following examples. 10<br>

Assay 3: Whole-cell cAMP Accumulation Flashplate Assay with HEK-293 cells expressing human S-BTT^c) Receptors<br>
hi this assay, the functional potency of a test compound was determined by 10    measuring the amount of cyclic AMP produced when HEK-293 cells expressing 5-HT4 receptors were contacted with different concentrations of test compound.<br>
a.	Cell Culture<br>
HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney) cells stably-transfected with cloned human 5-HT4(C) receptor cDNA were prepared expressing the receptor at two different densities:<br>
1 5    (1) at a density of about 0.5-0.6 pmol/nig protein, as determined using a [3H]-GR1 13808 membrane radioligand binding assay, and (2) at a density of about 6.0 pmol/mg protein. The cells were grown in T-225 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) containing 4,500 mg/L D-glucose (GIBCO-Invitrogen Corp.: Cat #1 1965) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (GIBCO-Invitrogen Corp.: Cat #10437) and (100<br>
20    units) penicillin-(100 u.g) streptomycin/ml (GIBCO-Invitrogen Corp.: Cat #15140) hi a 5% COa, humidified incubator at 37°C. Cells were grown under continuous selection pressure by the addition of geneticin (800 i^g/mL: GIBCO-hivitrogen Corp.: Cat #10131) to the medium.<br>
b.	Cell Preparation<br>
25	Cells were grown to roughly 60-80% confluency. Twenty to twenty-two hours<br>
prior to assay, cells were washed twice, and fed, with serum-free DMEM containing 4,500 mg/L D-glucose (GIBCO-Invitrogen Corp.: Cat #1 1965). To harvest the cells, the media was aspirated and 10 mL Versene (GIBCO-hivitrogen Corp.: Cat #15040) was added to each T-225 flask. Cells were incubated for 5 min at RT and then dislodged from<br>
30    the flask by mechanical agitation. The cell suspension was transferred to a centrifuge tube containing an equal volume of pre-warmed (37°C) dPBS and centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 rpm. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was re-suspended in pre-warmed<br>

and marked as time zero. The cells were counted with a Coulter counter (count above 8 (am, flask yield was 1-2 x 107 cells/flask). Cells were resuspended at a concentration of 5 x 105 cells/ml inpre-warmed (37°C) stimulation buffer (as provided in the flashplate 5    kit) and preincubated at 37°C for 10 min.<br>
cAMP assays were performed in a radioimmunoassay format using the Flashplate Adenylyl Cyclase Activation Assay System with 125I-cAMP (SMP004B, PerkinElmer Life Sciences Inc., Boston, MA), according to the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
Cells were grown and prepared as described above. Final cell concentrations in<br>
10    the assay were 25 x 103 cells/well and the final assay volume was 100 uL. Test<br>
compounds were received as 10 mM stock solutions in DMSO, diluted to 400 uM into 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4 at 25°C, containing 0.1% BSA, and serial (1:5) dilutions then made in the same buffer. Cyclic AMP accumulation assays were performed with 11 different concentrations of compound ranging from 10 pM to 100 uM (final assay<br>
15    concentrations). A 5-HT concentration-response curve (10 pM to 100 uM) was included on every plate. The cells were incubated, with shaking, at 37°C for 15 min and the reaction terminated by addition of 100 ul of ice-cold detection buffer (as provided in the flashplate kit) to each well. The plates were sealed and incubated at 4°C overnight. Bound radioactivity was quantified by scintillation proximity spectroscopy using the<br>
20    Topcount (Packard BioScience Co., Meriden, CT).<br>
The amount of cAMP produced per mL of reaction was extrapolated from the cAMP standard curve, according to the instructions provided in the manufacturer's user manual. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis with the GraphPad Prism Software package using the 3-parameter sigmoidal dose-response model (slope<br>
25    constrained to unity). Potency data are reported as pECso values, the negative decadic logarithm of the ECso value, where ECso is the effective concentration for a 50 % maximal response.<br>
Test compounds exhibiting a higher pEC5o value in this assay have a higher potency for agonizing the 5-HT4 receptor. The compounds of the invention which were<br>
30    tested in this assay, for example, in the cell line (1) having a density of about<br>
0.5-0.6 pmoymg protein, had a pECso value ranging from about 7.0 to about 9.0, typically ranging from about 7.5 to about 8.5.<br>

Assay 4: In viti-o Voltage Clamp Assay of Inhibition of Potassium Ion Current in Whole Cells Expressing the hERG Cardiac Potassium Channel<br>
CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with hERG cDNA were obtained from Gail Robertson at the University of Wisconsin. Cells were held in cryogenic storage until 5    needed. Cells were expanded and passaged hi Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium/F12 supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and 200 u.g/mL geneticin. Cells were seeded onto poly-D-lysine (100 p,g/mL) coated glass coverslips, in 35 mm2 dishes (containing 2 mL medium) at a density that enabled isolated cells to be selected for whole cell voltage-clamp studies. The dishes were maintained in a humidified, 5% CC&gt;2 environment at 37°C.<br>
10	Extracellular solution was prepared at least every 7 days and stored at 4°C when<br>
not in use. The extracellular solution contained (mM): NaCl (137), KC1 (4), CaCl2 (1.8), MgCIa (1), Glucose (10), 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-l-piperazineethanesulphonic acid (HEPES) (10), pH 7.4 with NaOH. The extracellular solution, in the absence or presence of test compound, was contained in reservoirs, from which it flowed into the recording chamber<br>
15    at approximately 0.5 mL/min. The intracellular solution was prepared, aliquoted and<br>
stored at -20°C until the day of use. The intracellular solution contained (mM): KC1 (130), MgCla (1), ethylene glycol-bis(beta-amuioethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-tetfa acetic acid salt (EGTA) (5), MgATP (5), 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-l-piperazineethanesulphonic acid (HEPES) (10), pH 7.2 with KOH. All experiments were performed at room temperature (20-22°C).<br>
20	The coverslips on which the cells were seeded were transferred to a recording<br>
chamber and perfused continuously. Gigaohm seals were formed between the cell and the patch electrode. Once a stable patch was achieved, recording commenced in the voltage clamp mode, with the initial holding potential at -80 mV. After a stable whole-cell current was achieved, the cells were exposed to test compound. The standard voltage<br>
25    protocol was: step from the holding potential of -80 mV to +20 mV for 4.8 sec, repolarize to -50 mV for 5 sec and then return to the original holding potential (-80 mV). This voltage protocol was run once every 15 sec (0.067 Hz). Peak current amplitudes during the repolarization phase were determined using pClamp software. Test compounds at a concentration of 3 |jM were perfused over the cells for 5 minutes, followed by a 5-minute<br>
30    washout period in the absence of compound. Finally a positive control (cisapride, 20 nM) was added to the perfusate to test the function of the cell. The step from -80 mV to +20 mV activates the hERG channel, resulting in an outward current. The step back to -50 mV<br>
65<br><br>
WO 2005/J00350	PCT/US2005/011393<br>
results in an outward tail current, as the channel recovers from inactivation and deactivates.<br>
Peak current amplitudes during the repolarization phase were determined using pCLAMP software. The control and test article data were exported to Origin® (OriginLab 5    Corp., Northampton MA) where the individual current amplitudes were normalized to the initial current amplitude in the absence of compound. The normalized current means and standard errors for each condition were calculated and plotted versus the time course of the experiment.<br>
Comparisons were made between the observed K current inhibitions after the 10    five-minute exposure to either the test article or vehicle control (usually 0.3 % DMSO). Statistical comparisons between experimental groups were performed using a two-population, independent t-test (Microcal Origin v. 6.0). Differences were considered significant at p 
The smaller the percentage inhibition of the potassium ion current in this assay, 15    the smaller the potential for test compounds to change the pattern of cardiac repolarization when used as therapeutic agents. The compounds of the invention which were tested in this assay at a concentration of 3 jiM exhibited an inhibition of the potassium ion current of less than about 20 %, typically, less than about 15%.<br>
Assay 5: /« vitro Model of Oral Bioavailability: Caco-2 Permeation Assay<br>
20	The Caco-2 permeation assay was performed to model the ability of test<br>
compounds to pass through the intestine and get into the blood stream after oral administration. The rate at which test compounds in solution permeate a cell monolayer designed to mimic the tight junction of human small intestinal monolayers was determined.<br>
25	Caco-2 (colon, adenocarcinoma; human) cells were obtained from ATCC<br>
(American Type Culture Collection; Rockville, MD). For the permeation study, cells were seeded at a density of 63,000 cells/cm2 on pre-wetted transwells polycarbonate filters (Costai-; Cambridge, MA). A cell monolayer was formed after 21 days in culture. Following cell culture in the transwell plate, the membrane containing the cell monolayer<br>
30    was detached from the transwell plate and inserted into the diffusion chamber (Costar;<br>

control. The air manifold delivered 95% O?/5% CO2 to each half oi a diffusion chamber and created a laminar flow pattern across the cell monolayer, which was effective in reducing the unstirred boundary layer.<br>
The permeation study was performed with test compound concentrations at 5     100 uM and with   C-mannitol to monitor the integrity of the monolayer. All<br>
experiments were conducted at 37 °C for 60 inin. Samples were taken at 0, 30 and<br>
60 min from both the donor and receiver sides of the chamber.  Samples were analy/.ed by<br>
HPLC or liquid scintillation counting for test compound and mannitol concentrations.<br>
The permeation coefficient (Kp) in cm/sec was calculated.<br>
10	hi this assay, a Kp value greater than about 10x1 0^(&gt; cm/sec is considered<br>
indicative of favorable bioavai lability. The compounds of the invention that were tested in this assay exhibited Kp values of between about 10 x 1 0 () cm/sec and about 50 x 1 0"6 cm/sec, typically between about 20 x 10"° cm/sec and about 40 x 10"° crn/sec.<br>
Assay 6: Pharmacokinetic Study in the Rat<br>
15	Aqueous solution formulations of test compounds were prepared in 0. 1 % lactic<br>
acid at apH of between about 5 and about 6. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (CD strain, Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were dosed with test compounds via intravenous administration (IV) at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg or by oral gavage (PO) at a dose of 5 mg/kg. The dosing volume was 1 mL/kg for IV and 2 ml 7kg for PO administration.<br>
20     Serial blood samples were collected from animals pre-dose, and at 2 (IV only), 5, 15, and 30 min, and at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours post-dose. Concentrations of lest compounds in blood plasma were determined by liquid cbromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS/MS) (MDS SCIEX, API 4000, Applied Biosysterns, Foster City, C'A) with a lower limit of quantitation of 1 ng/mL.<br>
25	Standard pharmacokinctic parameters were assessed by non-compartmental<br>
analysis (Model 201 for IV and Model 200 for PO) using WinNonlin (Version 4.0. 1 , Pharsight, Mountain View, CA). The maximum in the curve of test compound concentration in blood plasma vs. time is denoted Cinax. The area under the concentration vs. time curve from the time of dosing to the last measurable concentration (AUC(O-t))<br>
30 was calculated by the linear trape/oidal rule. Oral bioavailability (F(%)), i.e. the dose-normalized ratio of AUC(O-t) forPO administration to AUC(O-t) for IV administration, was calculated as:<br><br>
WO 2005/100350	PCT/liS20<l5></l5>
F(%) = AUCpo/AUCiv x Doseiv/Dosepo x 1 00%<br>
Test compounds which exhibit larger values of the parameters Cmax. AUC(O-t). andF(%) in this assay are expected to have greater bioavailability when administered orally. The compounds of the invention that were tested in this assay had Cmax values 5     typically ranging from about 0.1 to about 0.25 Lig/nrL and AUC(O-t) values typically ranging from about 0.4 to about 0.9 [ig-hr/mL. By way of example, the compound of Example 1 had a Crnax value of 0.17 ug/mL, an AUC(O-t) value of 0.66 fig-hr/mL and oral bioavailability (F(%)) in the rat model of about 35 %.<br>
