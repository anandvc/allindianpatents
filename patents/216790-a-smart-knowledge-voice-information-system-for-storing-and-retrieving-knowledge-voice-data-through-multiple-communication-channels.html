BACKGROUND ART<br>
Knowledge management is the name given to the set of systematic and disciplined actions that an organization can take to obtain the greatest value from the knowledge available to it. "Knowledge" in this context includes both the experience and understanding of the people in the organization and the information artifacts, such as documents and reports, available within the organization and in the world outside. Effective knowledge management typically requires an appropriate combination of organizational, social, and managerial initiatives along with, in many cases, deployment of appropriate technology. It is the technology and its applicability that is the focus of this paper.<br>
Patent application no. US2005265524 describes a system and method for communicating using a telecommunications device which includes automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. The ASR system which is capable of recognizing at least one prestored command from a voice input to the telecommunication device is activated. The ASR system compares the voice input to the at least one prestored command. When at least a first portion of the voice input matches the prestored command, the ASR system reviews a second portion of the voice input to determine a parameter value. A tone system generates a tone frequency corresponding to the parameter value.<br>

Patent application number WO2006004845 explains a voice messaging system comprising of a common message store, a local data store located remotely from the common message store, and a media server. The media server is operable to receive a call directed to a number serviced by the media server, prompt the user for a voice message, direct the voice message to the local data store for temporary storage, notify the common message store that the voice message is present in the local data store, respond to a request to transfer the voice message to the common message store, and direct the local data store to erase the message upon receipt of a communication from the common message store that the voice message was successfully saved.<br>
Large organizations possess a lot of information on varied subjects but they don't always know who knows what and how much. People also don't have the ability to become experts in every domain possible before they fully experience it. They end up paying a heavy price or go through a lot of inconvenience in doing these activities especially the first time. Good information sharing is the key to successful collaborative working and early intervention to help people at risk of poor outcomes. The best way to experience information is to share the details using voice. The quality of data defines the usage and application in people's life.<br>
It would be apparent from the above mentioned background art that the provision of IVR system is well known and commonly in use. Similarly there are softwares available for corporate document maintenance providing a knowledge management system. Importantly however such solutions are used in isolation and are often proprietary in nature resulting in customer pain and loss of quality.<br>
While the above state of the art reveals the provision/gadget/means to fill the gap in voice data management systems, it is found that the use of multiple available communication channels will make it easy for the user to access data. Further speech recognition as well as voice quality enhancement will add a lot of value for the user. Because of use of multiple input communication channels and multiple output channels a user can easily access information anywhere. Further a similar kind of system can be used to provide a live feed on various communication channels. It is also important to notice that the way received data is organized is very important as it will, in the end, affect retrieval of data. Hence with these thoughts in mind we now move to the objective of the present invention.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide for a smart 'knowledge voice' information system to store and retrieve voice data through Telephone, VOIP, Web, Email and SMS/MMS.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The details of the invention, its objects and advantages are explained hereunder in greater detail in relation to non-limiting exemplary illustration of the knowledge voice system in accordance with the invention adapted to retrieve/receive and/or store and/or filter and/or enhance voice quality and/or send/deliver voice data as per the accompany figures wherein:<br>
Fig 1 is schematic illustration of all the input and output channels of knowledge voice system;<br>
Fig 2 is schematic detailed illustration of input and output mechanism; Fig 3 is a broad level data flow chart of data storage in Knowledge voice system; Fig 4 is a broad level data flow chart of data retrieval in Knowledge voice system; Fig 5 is a sample flow chart for knowledge voice access over phone line;<br>
Reference is first invited to accompanying Fig 1, which illustrates the input and output channels of knowledge voice system. Information can be entered in to knowledge voice system from Telephone (dialing knowledge voice numbers with or without access restriction), VOIP (dialing knowledge voice globally accessible numbers with or without access restriction), WEB (using knowledge voice feature enable sites with or without access restriction and uploading voice data), EMAIL (with the voice file as an attachment or text as the message body or subject line and sending the email to knowledge voice email addresses), SMS (sending text message to knowledge voice SMS number that converts text to voice), MMS (sending voice message to knowledge voice MMS number) and API(knowledge voice system retrieve voice data from other voice data supplier using API). Stored/live information can be retrieved from Telephone (dialing knowledge voice numbers with or without access restriction and using speech recognition or prior voice data knowledge for search), VOIP (dialing knowledge voice globally accessible numbers with or without access restriction and using speech recognition or prior voice data knowledge for search), WEB (using knowledge voice feature enable sites with or without access restriction<br>
and searching using text string), EMAIL (with the voice file as an attachment or text as the message body or subject line and sending the email to knowledge voice email addresses to get results back in email as attachment), SMS (sending text message to knowledge voice SMS number and getting the MMS in return having the desired result), MMS (sending voice message to knowledge voice MMS number which after speech recognition sends back result MMS) and API(knowledge voice system also provides stored voice data access as webservice using API)<br>
Reference is now invited to accompanying in Fig 2, which illustrates data input and output mechanism in detail: (Table Removed)<br>
Reference is now invited to accompanying figure 3, which illustrates flow chart for storing voice data in knowledge voice system. Voice data reach knowledge voice system from various channels (1). Data received is passed to relevant module for basic processing (2). Further received data is enhanced and filtered depending on the need (3). It is then assessed that the data is for live feed or for storage. Data for storage is then indexed and pushed to database for future retrieval and live data is sent to relevant channel.<br>
Reference is now invited to accompanying figure 4, which illustrate the method of retrieving stored voice information data from database. Query is received through telephone, VOIP, web, email, SMS/MMS (1), query is then sent for basic processing (2), further processed data in (2) is queried in the database (3). Relevant result obtained in (3) are then packaged for delivery (4).<br>
Reference is now invited to accompanying figure 5, it shows a sample flow when a<br>
user call knowledge voice system over telephone.<br>
0001: Call comes to knowledge voice system<br>
0002: user is prompted with some options to choose from<br>
0003: If user pressed 1 in 0002 system prompts for user name and password<br>
0004: If user pressed 2 in 0002 system prompts for message number user wants to<br>
play<br>
0005: If user pressed 3 in 0002 system prompts for search the database using<br>
speech recognition<br>
0006: If user pressed 4 in 0002 system provide information about knowledge voice<br>
to user<br>
0007: System conduct a search on the basis of speech recognition in the database<br>
0008: After conducting the speech recognition search system comes up with all the<br>
answer and let user chose which one he/she wants to listen to<br>
0009: system looks for whether the message number provided in 0004 is correct or<br>
not<br>
0010: Wrong username /password entered in 0003<br>
0011: information provided in 0003 is correct<br>
0012: record your message for a duration of 300 seconds<br>
0013: play the message number entered in 0009<br><br>
0014: Message number information provided in 0009 is not correct 0015: save the voice data spoken in 0012 into database<br>
It is thus possible by way of above disclosed knowledge voice system in particular that it would voice information sharing across various communication mediums providing an ease for a user to access and retrieve the information. Further various applications that can be built on knowledge voice system will help organizations and governments to improve the system. It will further benefit in improving the quality of life and better information sharing with in the users.<br><br><br><br><br>
