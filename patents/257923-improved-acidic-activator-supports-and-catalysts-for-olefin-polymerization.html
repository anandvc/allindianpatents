				<td>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/877,039 entitled "Improved Acidic Activator-Supports 'and Catalysts for Olefin Polymerization," which was filed on June 25, 2004 and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION."<br>
This invention relates to the field of olefin polymerization catalyst compositions, methods for the polymerization of olefins, and olefin polymers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Mono-1-olefins (a-olefins), including ethylene, can be polymerized with catalyst compositions employing titanium, zirconium, vanadium, chromium or other metals, impregnated on a. variety of support materials, often in the presence of cocatalysts. These catalyst compositions may be useful for both homopolymerization of ethylene, as well as copolymerization of ethylene with comonomers such as propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, or oier higher a-olefins. Therefore, there.exists a constant .search to develop new olefin polymerization catalysts, catalyst.activation .processes, and methods of making and using catalysts that will provide enhanced catalytic activities and polymeric materials tailored to specific end uses.<br>
One type of catalyst system comprises organometal compounds, particularly metallocene compounds. It is known that contacting water with trimefhylaluminum under appropriate conditions forms methyl aluijainoxane; and subsequently contacting methyl aluminoxane with a metallocene compound forms a metallocene polymerization catalyst. However, in order to achieve the desired high polymerization activities, large amounts of methyl aluminoxane, and hence large amounts of expensive trimethylaluminum, are nscessary to form the active metallocene catalysts. This feature has been an/impediment to the commercialization of •metallocene catalyst .'systems, therefore improvements in catalyst compositions and in methods of making the catalyst are needed to afford the desired high polymerization activities.<br>
What are needed are new catalyst compositions and methods of making the catalyst compositions that afford high polymerization activities, and will allow polymer properties to be maintained within the desired specification ranges. One method to achieve this goal is to develop new polymerization methods that provide and utilize catalysts of sufficiently high activity as to be commercially viable.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION    •<br>
This invention comprises catalyst compositions, methods for preparing catalyst compositions, and methods for polymerizing olefins and acetylenes using the catalyst compositions. In the course of examining-metallocene olefin polymerization catalysts, it was discovered that increased activity in metalldcene catalyst compositions could be achieved by precontacting the metallocene compound- with an alkene or alkyne monomer and an organoaluminum cocatalyst for some period of .time before the mixture is contacted with an aiidic activator-support.<br>
The mixture of at least one metallocene, alkene or alkyne monomer, and organoaluminum cocatalyst compound, before it is contacted with the activator-support, is termed the "precontacted" mixture. The mixture of metallocene, monomer, organoalumimun cocatalyst, and activator-support, formed from contacting the precontacted mixture with the acidic activator-support, is termed the "postcpntacted" mixture. This terminology is used regardless of what type of reaction oc.curs .between components of the mixtures. For example, according to this description, it is possible for. the precontacted organoaluminum compound, once it is admixed with the metallocene or metallocenes and the olefin or alkyne monomer, to have a different chemical formulation, and structure from the distinct organoaluminum compound used to prepare the precontacted mixture. Accordingly, the metallocene, the organoalurrununi: compound,::the olefin or alkyne, and the acidic activator-svpport, whether precontacted or postcontacted, are described according to the corresponding metallocene, organoaluminum compound/ olefin or alkyne, and acidic activator-support used to contact the other components rapreparing the precontacted or postcontacted mixtures.<br>
. Therefore, in one aspect, the catalyst.composition of this invention comprises: at least one precontacted metallocene; at least one .pireppntacted organoaluminum compound; at least ore precontacted olefin or alkyne; and at least one postcontacted acidic activator-support.<br>
In another aspect, the precontacted metallocene comprises a compound having the fbllowingfornv'1"'<br>

wherein at least one substituent on (X1) is optionally a bridging group that connects<br>
(X1) and (X2); '	.<br>
wherein (X3) and (X4) are independently an aliphatic group, an aromatic group, a cyclic group, a combination of aliphatic and cyclic groups, an oxygen group, a sulfur group, a nitrogen group, a phosphorus group, an arsenic group, a carbon group, a silicon group, a germanium group, a tin group, a lead group, a boron group, an aluminum group, an inorganic group, an organometallic group, or a substituted derivative thereof, any one of which having<br>
s<br>
from 1 to 20 carbon atoms; or a halide.<br>
wherein (X2) is independently a cyciopentadienyl group, an indenyl group, a fluorenyl<br>
group, a boratabenzene group, an aliphatic -group; an aromatic group, a cyclic group, a<br>

wherein each substituent on the substituted (X2) is independently an aliphatic group, an aromatic group, a cyclic group, a combination of aliphatic and cyclic groups, an oxygen group, a sulfur group, a nitrogen group, a phosphorus group, an arsenic group, a carbon<br>
group, a silicon group, a germanium group, a. tin group, a lead group, a boron group, an aluminum group, an inorganic group, an organometallic group, or a substituted derivative thereof, any one of which having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms; a halide; or hydrogen; and wherein at least one substituent on (X2) is optionally a bridging group that connects (X1) and (X2).<br>
In another aspect of this. invention;.: tfce precontaoted organoaluminum compound comprises an organoaluminum compouhd-with the following formula:<br>
wherein (X5) is a hydrocarbyl having from 2 to 20 carbon atoms; (X*) is an alkoxide or aryloxide, any one of which having from 1 tp. 20 carbon atoms, halide, or hydride; and n is a number from 1 to 3, inclusive.<br>

The activator-support of this invention, of which fluo'rided silica-alumina is one example, exhibits enhanced acidity as compared to the corresponding untreated solid oxide compound. The activator-support also functions as a catalyst activator as compared to the corresponding untreated solid -oxide. Accordingly, the acidic activator-support functions as an "activator"<br>
because it is not merely an inert support component of the catalyst composition, but is involved in effecting the observed catalytic chemistry.<br>
In another aspect of this invention, for example, precontacting a metallocene compound with 1-hexene and triethylaluminum, typically for at least 10 minutes, prior to contacting this mixture with-the acidic activator-support such as fluorided silica-alumina, the productivity of the subsequent olefin polymerization was increased by several-fold as compared to a catalyst composition using'-the 'same components, but without a precontacting step. The enhanced activity catalyst composition of this invention can be used for liomopolymerization of an ccrolefin monomer, for copolymerization.of an cc-olefin and a comonomer, and for polymerization of alkynes as. well.<br>
This invention also comprises methods of making catalyst compositions that utilize at least one metallocene catalyst, at least one! ofganoaluminum compound as cocatalysts, and an acidic activator-support. The methods of this invention comprise precontacting the metallocene catalyst and an organoaluminum cocatalyst with an olefin or alkyne compound typically, but not necessarily,, a.monomer- tb-"be-polymerized or copolymerized, prior to contacting this precontacted mixture with: tbie. acidic activator-support. Such methods allow ::br, among other things, attaining a high polymerization activity and productivity.<br>
Thus, in one aspect, this invention provides a process to produce a catalyst composition, comprising:<br>

	i<br>
Unsaturated reactants that are useful in the precontacting step and in the polymerization processes with .catalyst compositions of this invention include olefin compounds having from 2 to 30 carbon .atoms per molecule and having at least one olefinic double bond. This invention encompasses. nQmopolymerization processes using a single olefin, as well as copc-lymerization reacti(!)ps;-;mth at least one different olefinic compound. Typically, copolymers of ethylene comprise, a'major amount of ethylene (&gt;50 mole percent) and a minor amount of comonomer 
Acyclic, cyclic, pplycyclic, terminal ..(a)| internal, linear, branched, substituted, unsubstituted, functionalized, and non?functionalized olefins may be employed in this invention. For example, typical unsaturated compounds that can be polymerized with the catalysts of this invention include, but are not limited to, propylene,. 1-butene, 2-butene, 3-methyl-1-butene, isobutylene, 1-pentene, 2-pentene, 3-methyl-l-pentene, 4-methyl-l-•pentene, 1-hexene, 2-hexene, 3-hexene, .'3-ethyl-l-hexene, 1-heptene, 2-heptene, 3-heptene, the four normal octenes, the four normal hpnenes, the five normal decenes, and mixtures of any two or more thereof. Cyclic and bicyclic olefins, including but not limited to,<br>
cyclopentene,  cyclohexene,  norbornylene,  norbomadiene,  and the  like,   may also be polymerized as described above.<br>
Acetylenes may be also be polymerized according to this invention. Acyclic, cyclic, terminal, internal, linear, branched, substituted, unsubstituted, functionalized, and non-functionalized alkynes may be employed in this invention. Examples of alkynes that can be polymerized include, but are not limited to, diphenylacetylene, 2-butyne, 2-hexyne, 3-hexyne, 2-heptyne, 3-heptyne, 2-octyne, 3-octynej 4Tp.ctyne, and the like.<br>
In one aspect, when a copolyrher is desired, the monomer ethylene may be copolymerized with a comonomer. In another aspect, examples of the comonomer include, but are not limited to, propylene, 1-butenei 2-butene, 3-methyl-l-butene, isobutylene, 1-pcntene, 2-pentene, 3-methyl-l-pentene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 1-hexene, 2-hexene, 3-hexene, 3-ethyl-l-hexene, 1-heptene, 2-heptene, 3-heptene, the four normal octenes, the four normal nonenes, or the five normal decenes.

Alternatively, an amount sufficient to give the above described concentrations by weight, in the copolymer produced can be used.<br>
While not intending to -be bound .by this theory,- in the event that branched, substituted, or functionalized olefins are used-as'reactants, it is believed that steric hindrance may impede and/or slow the polymeri2atiori. process. Thus, branched and/or cyclic portion(s) of the olefin removed somewhat from the.carbon-carbon double bond would not be expected to hinder the reaction in the way that the same olefin substituents situated more proximate to the carbon-carbon double bond might. In one aspect, at least one reactant for the catalyst compositions of this invention is . ethylene, so the' polymerizations are either hcmopolymerizations or copolymerizations-with a different acyclic, cyclic, terminal, internal, linear, branched, substituted, or unsubstitiited olefin. In addition, the catalyst compositions of<br>
this invention may be used in polymerization of diolefin compounds, including but are not limited to, 1,3-butadiene, isoprene, 1,4-pentadjene, and 1,5-hexadiene.<br>
The Solid Acidic Activator-Support<br>
The present invention provides catalyst compositions comprising at least one<br>
mcitallocene compound, at least one organpaluminum compound, at least one olefin or<br>
allryne, and at least one acidic activator-support. In one aspect, the metallocene compound<br>
and the organoaluminum compound are prec'ontacted'with the olefin or alkyne to form a<br>
procontacted mixture, prior to contacting this precontacted mixture with the acidic activator-<br>
support.	• . .<br>
The present invention encompasses catalyst compositions comprising an acidic acrivator-support, methods for preparing, catalyst compositions comprising an acidic activator-support, and methods for polymerizing olefins and acetylenes using these catalyst compositions. In this invention, the metallocene compound may be contacted with an olofinic or acetylenic monomer and an organoaluminum compound for a first period of time pr.or to contacting this mixture with the-acidic activator-support. Once the precontacted mixture of metallocene, unsaturated monomer, and organoaluminum compound has been<br>
contacted with the acidic activator-s.upporti/this pomposition, which further comprises the<br>
'.'•" '"•• acidic activator-support,  is  termed the  "postcbntacted" mixture.     In . one aspect, the<br>
pcstcontacted mixture may be further allowed to remain in contact for a second period of time prior to being charged into the reactor in which the polymerization process will be carried out. In another aspect, the postebhtacted mixture may be charged into the reactor immediately after being prepared, or may "be prepared, directly in the reactor, and the polymerization reaction initiated immediately-thereafter. In this aspect, the second period of time during which the postcontacted mixture'is allowed to remain in contact is the minimal amount of time required to prepare the postcontacted mixture and initiate the polymerization process.<br>
In one aspect, the present invention.encompasses catalyst compositions comprising a chemically-treated solid oxide which serves .as an acidic' activator-support, and which is typically used in combination with an orgarioaluminum compound. In another aspect, the activator-support comprises at least one solid oxide treated with-at least one electron-withdrawing anion; wherein the solid-oxide is silica, alumina, silica-alumina, aluminum phosphate, heteropolytungstates, titania, zirconia, magnesia, boria, zinc oxide, mixed oxides<br>
thereof, or mixtures thereof; and wherein the' electron-withdrawing anion is    fluoride, chloride, bromide, phosphate, triflate, bisuliate, sulfate, or any .combination thereof.<br>
The activator-support includes the contact product of at least one solid oxide compound and at least one electron-withdrawing anion source. In one aspect, the solid oxide compound comprises an inorganic oxide. It is not required that the solid oxide compound be calcined prior to contacting the electron-withdrawing anion source. The contact product may be calcined either during or after the solid', oxide compound is contacted with the electron-withdrawing anion source. In this aspeeti the solid oxide compound may be calcined or uncalcined. In another aspect, the activators-support may comprise the contact.product of at least one calcined solid oxide compound and at least one electron-withdrawing anion source.<br>
The activator-support exhibits enh.anc.ed acidity as compared to the corresponding untreated solid oxide compound. The activator-support also functions as a catalyst activator as compared to the corresponding untreated solid oxide. While not intending to be bound by ttieory, it is believed that the activator-support may function as an ionizing solid oxide compound by completely or partially extracting an anionic ligand from the metallocene. However, the activator-support is an- activator regardless of .whether it ionizes the metallocene, abstracts an anionic ligand to. form an-ion pair, weakens the metal-ligand bond in the metallocene, simply coordinates to an anionic ligand when it contacts the activator-support, or any other mechanisms by which activation may occur. While the activator-iiupport activates the metallocene in the absence of cocatalysts, it is not necessary to eliminate oocatalysts from the catalyst composition. The activation function of the activator-support is evident in the enhanced activity of catalyst cpinposjition as a whole, as compared to a catalyst composition containing the corresponding untreated solid oxide. However, it is believed ^at i;he activator-support functions as an activator, even in the absence of an organoaluminum compound, aluminoxanes, organoboron compounds, or ionizing ionic compounds.<br>
In one aspect, the activator-support of this invention comprises a solid inorganic oxide material, a mixed oxide material, or a combination of inorganic oxide materials, that is :hemically-treated with an electron-withdrawing component, and optionally treated with a metal. Thus, the solid oxide of this invention encompasses oxide materials such as alumina, "mixed oxide" compounds thereof such as.^silica-alumina, and combinations and mixtures thereof. The mixed oxide compounds such as • silica-alumina single chemical phases witt<br>
more than one metal combined with oxygen to form a solid oxide compound, and are encompassed by this invention.<br>
In one aspect of this invention, the activator-support further comprises a metal or metal ion selected from zinc, nickel, vanadium, silver, copper, gallium, tin, tungsten, molybdenum, or any combination thereof;'. Examples of activator-supports that further comprise a metal or metal ion include, -but are not limited to, zinc-impregnated chlorided alumina, zinc-impregnated fluorided alumina, zinc-impregnated chlorided silica-alumina, zinc-impregnated fluorided silica-aluminai zinc-impregnated sulfated alumina, or any combination thereof.<br>
In another aspect, the activator-support,of this invention comprises a solid oxide of relatively high porosity, which exhibits Lewis acidic or Bransted acidic behavior. The solid o:dde is chemically-treated with an electron-withdrawing component, typically an electron-withdrawing anion or an electron-withdrawing anion source, to form a activator-support. Vftiile not intending to be bound by the following statement, it is believed that treatment of the inorganic oxide with an electron-Withdrawing component augments or enhances the a;idiry of the oxide. Thus, the activatorrsupppri exhibits Lewis or Bronsted acidity, which is topically greater than die Lewis' or Bnansted. acidity of-the untreated solid oxide. One method to quantify the acidity of the chemically-treated and untreated solid oxide materials is by<br>
comparing the polymerization activities of the treated and untreated oxides under acid<br>
i	•<br>
catalyzed reactions. Generally, it is observed that the greater the electron-withdrawing ability<br>
or Lewis acidity of the activator-support, the greater its polymerization activity.<br>
In one aspect, the chemically-treated, solid oxide comprises a solid inorganic oxide comprising oxygen and at least one element selected from Group 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10, 11, :.2,13, 14, or 15 of the periodic table, or comprising oxygen and at least one element selected Jrorn the lanthanide or actinide elements.

In one aspect of this invention, the solid oxide, material is chemically-treated by contacting it with at least one electron-withdrawing anion, which may be derived from any electron-withdrawing component or.an.electrpnrwithdrawing anion source. Further, the solid oxide material is optionally chemically-treitdd with a metal ion, then calcining to form a metal-containing or metal-impregnated chemically-treated solid oxide. Alternatively, a solid oxide material and an electron-withdrawing anion source are contacted and calcined simultaneously. The method by which the oxide is contacted with an electron-withdrawing component, typically a salt or an acid of. an electron-withdrawing anion, includes, but is not limited to, gelling, co-gelling, .impregnation: of one -compound onto another, and the like. Typically, following any contacting method, the contacted mixture of oxide compound, electron-withdrawing anion,- and optionally the metal ion is calcined.<br>
The electron-withdrawing component used to treat the oxide is any component that increases the Lewis or Br0nsted acidity of the solid oxide upon treatment. In one aspect, the e'.ectron-withdrawing component is an electrpn-withdrawmg anion source compound derived from a salt, an acid, or other compound such as a volatile organic compound that may serve as a source or precursor for that anion.

In., addition, other ionic or non-ionic compounds that serve as sources for .these electron-withdrawing anions may also be employed in the present invention.<br>
When the electron-withdrawing component comprises a salt of an electron-v/ithdrawing anion, the counterfoil or cation of that salt may be any cation that allows the salt to revert or decompose back, to-the acid during-calcining. Factors that dictate the suitability of the particular salt to serve as a source for the electron-withdrawing anion include, but are<br>
net limited to, the solubility of the salt in the desired solvent, the lack of adverse reactivity of the cation, ion-pairing effects between the cation and anion, hygroscopic properties imparted to the salt by the cation, and the like, and thermal stability of the anion. Examples of suitable cations in the salt of the electron-withdrawing anion include, but are not limited to, ammonium, trialkyl ammonium, tetraalkyl ammonium, tetraalkyl phosphonium, H+, [K(OEt2)2]+, and the like.<br>

Combinations of electron withdrawing components may be contacted with the oxide material simultaneously or individually, and any order that affords the desired activator-support acidity. For example, one aspect of this invention is employing two or more electron-withdrawing anion source compounds in two or more separate contacting steps. Thus, one example of such a process by. which an activator-support is prepared is as follows: a selected solid oxide compound, or combination of oxide compounds, is contacted with a first electron-withdrawing anion source compound to form a first mixture, this first mixture is then calcined, the calcined first mixture is then contacted with a second electron-withdrawing anion source compound to form a second mixture, followed by calcining said second mixture to form a treated solid oxide compound. In such a process, the first and second electron-withdrawing anion source,compounds are typically different compounds, although they may be the same compound<br>

An ionizing ionic compound is an ionic compound which can function to enhanos activity of the catalyst composition. While not bound by theory, it is believed that the ionizing ionic compound may be capable of reacting with the metalldcenc compound and converting the metallocene into a cationic metallpcene compound. Again, while not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed-that the ipnizjng ionic compound may function as an ionizing compound by completely or partially extracting an anionic ligand, possibly a non-ii 5-alkadienyl Hgand sufch as (X3) or (X*), fitom the metallpeene. However, the ionizing ionic compound is an activator regardless of whether it is ionizes the metallocene, abstracts an (X3) or (X4) ligand in a fashion as to form an ion pair, weakens the metal-(X3) or metal-(X4) bond in the metallocene, simply coordinates to an (X3) or (X4) ligand, or any other mechanisms by which activation may occur: Further, it is not necessary that the ionizing ionic compound activate the: metallocene only. The activation function of the ionizing ionic compound is evident in the enhanced activity of catalyst composition as a whole, us compared to a catalyst composition contaiaing catalyst composition that does not comprise any ionizing ionic compound.<br>

Preparation of the Catalyst Composition<br>
In accordance with this invention, the catalyst compositions may be prepared by a process comprising precontacting an organoaluminum cocatalyst compound with an olefra or alkyne and an organometal compound for an effective period of time, before this mixture is contacted with the activator-support for ah effective period of time. In one aspect, the process of preparing the catalyst of this invention may occur in an inert atmosphere and under substantially anhydrous conditions. Thus, the atmosphere is substantially oxygen-free and substantially free of water as the reaction begins, to prevent deactrvation of the catalyst. In one aspect of this invention, for example, 1-hexene, triethykluminurn, and a zirconium metaUocene, such as fcw(mdenyl)zirconium dichloride or feis(cyc!opentadienyl)-zirconium dichloride are precontacted for at least 30 minutes prior to contacting this mixture with a fluorided silica-alumina activator-support Once this precontacted mixture is brought into contact with the activator-support, this postcontacted mixture is allowed to remain in contact for trom 1 minute to 24 hours, typically from 5-minutes to 5 hours, and more typically from 10 minutes to 1 hour, prior to using this mixture in a polymerization process.<br>
Typically, the mixture of metaUocene, olefin or alkyne monomer, and organoaluminum compound, before it is contacted with the activator-support, is termed the "precontacted" mixture. Accordingly, the components of the precontacted mixture are termed precontacted metallocene, ptecontaeted.olefin or alkyne monomer, and precontacted organoaluminum compound. The mixture of the precontacted mixture and the acidic activator-support, that is, the mixture of the metallocene, olefin or alkyne monomer, organoaluminum compound, aad acidic activator-support, is typically termed the "postcontacted" mixture. Accordingly, the components of the postcontaeted mixture are termed postcontacted metallocene, postcontaeted olefin or alkyne monomer, postcontacted organoaluminum compound, and postcontacted acidic activator-support.<br>
In one aspect of this invention, improved catalytic-activities may be achieved when the precontacted mixture comprises various components other man the metallocene, olefin or alkyne monomer, and organoaluminum compound In this aspect, the components of the precontacted mixture and the. postcontacted mixture vary, such that the resulting catalyst composition can be tailored for the desired- activity, or to accommodate a particular polymerization process.<br>
The precontacting step may be carried out in a variety of ways, including but not limited to, blending. Furthermore, each of the organometal, monomer, and organoaluminum<br>
cocatalyst compounds can be fed into a reactor separately, or various combinations of these compounds can be contacted with each other before being farther contacted in the reactor. Alternatively, all three compounds can be contacted together before being introduced into the reactor. Typically, the mixture of metallocene, alkene or alkyne, and organoaluminum compound was precontacted from minutes to days in a separate reactor, prior to contacting this mixture with activator-support to form the postcontacted mixture. This precontacting step is usually carried out under an inert atmosphere. Further, the precontacting step may be carried out with stirring, agitation, heating, cooling, sotiican'on, shaking, under pressure, at room temperature, in an inert solvent (typically a hydrocarbon), and the like. However, such conditions are not necessary as the precontacting step may be carried out by simply allowing the components to stand substantially undisturbed.<br>
In another aspect of this invention, the precontacted mixture is prepared first by contacting an organoaluminum compound, an olefin or acetylene, and an organometa] (typically a metallocene) compound before injection into the reactor, typically for 1 minute tc 9 days, more typically from 1 minute to 24 hours. The components of the precontacted mixture are generally contacted at a temperature from 10°C to 200°C, typically from 15°C to 80°C. This precontacted mixture is then placed in contact with the acidic activator-support, typically a fluorided silica-alumina activator-support as disclosed herein, to form the postcontacted mixture.<br>
The postcontacted mixture is prepared by contacting and admixing the acidic activator-support and the precontacted mixture for any length of time and at any temperature and pressure that allows complete contact and reaction between the components of the postcontacted mixture. For example, this postcontacted mixture is usually allowed to remain in contact for from 1 minute to 24 hours, typically from 5 minutes to 5 hours, and more typically from 10 minutes to 1 hour, prior to using this mixture in a polymerization process. Once the acidic activator-support and the precontacted mixture have been in contact for a period of time, the composition comprises a post-contacted organometal compound .(typically, a metallocene), a postcontacted organoaluminum compound, a postcontacted olefin or alkyne, and a postcontacted acidic, activator-support (typically fluorided silica-alumina). Generally, the postcontacted acidic activator-support is the majority, by weight, of the composition. Often, the specific nature of the final components of a catalyst prepared as described herein are not known, therefore the catalyst composition of the present invention is<br>
described as comprising ppstcontaoted compounds and components. Further, because the exact order of contacting can be varied* it is believed that this terminology is best to describe the composition's components.<br>
In one aspect, the postcontacting step in which the precontacted mixture is placed in contact with the acidic activator-support is typically carried out in an inert atmosphere. Contact times between the acidic activator-support and die precontacted mixture typically range from time O.I hour to 24 hours, and from 0.1 to 1 hours is more typical. The mixture may be heated to a temperature from between 0°F (-17.7 °C) to 150°F (65.56 °C). Temperatures between 40°F (4.44 9C) to 95°F (35 °C) are typical if the mixture is heated at all. While not intending to be bound by theory, these conditions are thought to assist in the deposition of a catalytically-effective amount of the catalyst on the acidic activator-support.<br>
In general, heating is carried out at a temperature and for a duration sufficient to allow adsorption, impregnation, or interaction of precontacted mixture and the acidic activator-support, such that a portion of the components of the precontacted mixture is immobilized, adsorbed, or deposited thereon. For example, in one aspect, a catalyst composition of this invention is prepared by contacting ,1-hexene, triethylaluminum, and a zirconium metallocene, such as i&gt;ts(indenyl)zirconium dichloride or 6u(cyclbpentadienyl)-zirconium dichloride for at least 30 minutes, followed by contacting this precontacted mixture with a fluorided silica-alumina activator-support for at least 10 minutes up to one hour to form the active catalyst.<br>
More than one metalloeene can be .used in the catalyst composition and methods of the present invention. When a catalyst composition comprises more than one metalloeene, the metalloeene compounds are employed in one or more precontacted mixtures. Thus, these multiple metalloeenes may be employed in the same precontacted mixture and then used in the same posteontacted mixture, they can be employed in different precontacted mixtures which are then used to prepare the same posteontacted mixture, or they can be employed in different precontacted mixtures and different posteontacted mixtures which are then introduced into the polymerization reactor. • • '<br>
In one aspect, the molar ratio of .the organometal or metalloeene compound to the organoaluminum compound is 1:1 to 1:10,000, typically from 1:1 to 1:1,000, and more typically from 1:1 to 1:100. These molar ratios reflect flic ratio<br>
the total amount of organoaluminum compound in both the precontacted mixture and this postcontacted mixture.<br>
Generally, the molar ratio of olefin or aQcyne monomer to organometal or metallocene compound in the precontacted mixture is 1:10 to 100,000:1, typically from 10:1 to 1,000:1.<br>
In another aspect of this invention^.the weight ratio of the acidic activator-support tc the organoaluminom compound generally ranges from 1:5 to 1,000:1, typically from 1:3 tc 100:1, and more typically from 1:1 to 50:1, In a further aspect of mis invention, the weigh! ratio of the metallocene to the acidic activator-support is typically from 1:1 to 1:10,000,000. more typically from 1:10 to 1:100,000, even more typically from 1:20 to 1:1000. These ratios that involve the acidic activator-support are based on the amount of the components mat have been added to make up the postoontacted mixture to provide the catalyst composition.<br>
One aspect of mis invention is that alumhioxane is not required to form the catalyst composition disclosed herein, &amp; feature mat allows lower polymer production costs. Accordingly, the present invention uses only AlRj-type organoaluminum compounds which does not activate the metallocene catalyst in the same manner as an organoaluminoxane. Additionally, no expensive borate compounds or MgClj are required to form the catalyst composition of mis invention, although aluminoxane, borate compounds, MgCl2) or combinations thereof can optionally be used in some aspects of this invention. However, another aspect of mis invention is the use of optional cocatalysts, including, but not limited to, at least one aluminoxane, at least one organoboron compound, at least one ionizing ionic compound, or any combination thereof.<br>
It is believed that the unexpected enhancements in the catalytic activity observed from precontacting certain catalyst components may be related to the formation of organoaluminum metallacycUc compounds, • based upon the reported synthesis of aluminacyclo-pentanes (ACPs) according to the following reaction scheme, Scheme 1, using (n^jHsfcZrCfe, AJEtj, and CH2=CHCHjR (R - CjH7, GjHn, or CgHn), where T15-C5H5 = Cp.<br><br>
One reaction scheme to produce ACPs is .described in: U.M. Dzhemilev and A.G. Ibragimov, Journal ofOrganometaltic Chemistry, 1994, 466, 1-4, which, along with the references and citations referred to therein, each of which is incorporated by reference herein, in its entirety. Other reaction schemes to produce ACPs are described in Khalikov, L.M.; Parfenova, L. V.; Rusakov, S.V.; Ibragimov, A.G.; Dzhemilev,.U.. M. Russian Chemical Bulletin, International Addition 2000, 49, (12), 2051-2058. See also:* Negishi, E.; Kondafcov, Denis, Y.; Choueiry, D.; Kasai, KL; Takahashi, T. Journal of.the American Chemical Society 1996, 775, 9577-9588, each of which is incorporated by referenced herein, in its entirety. According to Scheme 1, when the organotnetal .(typically metallocene) compound and an organoaluminum compound are precontacted with an olefin, an aluminacyclopentane can form. While not intending to be bound by mis statement, according to ibis reaction scheme and analogous reactions schemes described in Dzjiemilev, U. M:; Ibragimov, A. G. Russian Chemical Reviews 2000, 69, (2) 121-135 when the organometal (typically mefaflocene) compound and an organoaluminum compound are precontacted with an alkyne, an aluminacyclopentene can form. A mixture of an olefin and an alkyne in the precontacted mixture would be expected to form an aluminacyclopentane and an atuminacyclopentene, in an analogous manner.<br>
La accordance with KhaHkoV, L.M.; Parfenova, L. V.; Rusakov, S.V.; Ibragimov, A.G.; Dzhemilev, U. M. Russian Chemical Bulletin, International Addition 2000, 49, (12). 2051-2058, and the references: and citations referred to therein, mere are several possible mechanisms by which Scheme 1 can operate, one of which is presented in Scheme 2. Note mat only one regioisomer of intermediate B is shown, leading to the aluminacyclopentane (AGP) regioisomer C shown.<br><br><br>
However, this scheme would also be expected to provide some of the a-substituted aluminacyclopentane, structure D, shown here:<br><br>

EtAi;<br>
D   .<br>
Thus, for any particular compound disclosed herein, any general structure presented also encompasses all isomers, including all regioisomers that may arise from a particular set of substitutents or from a particular reaction scheme, as the context requires.<br>
Another aspect of this invention is the catalyst composition comprising aluminacyctopentanes or metaliacyclopentane of a metalloeene, such as a zoconacyclopentanes. Thus, this-invention encompasses a catalyst composition comprising a precontacted metallocenej a precoatacted .olefin or alkyne, a postcontaeted acidic activator-support, and an aluminacyelopentane. This invention also encompasses a catalyst composition comprisiag a precontacted metalloeene, a precontacted olefin or alkyne, a postcontaeted acidic activator-support, and a metallacyclopehtane or a metallacyclopentene of a metalloeene.<br>
Also, while not intending to be hound by theoretical statements, the reaction schemes above may also explain why triethyJahiminum -(TEA) worlds well to fonn the precontacted solution, while trimethylaluminom (TMA) does not. As indicated in Scheme 2, if the<br>
aluminum alkyl compound used in the precontacted mixture contains jJ-hydrogen atoms, these alkyl groups can participate in the P-H elimination process shown when coordinated to the organometal compound, thereby forming the arcom'um-ahirninurn compound and ths resulting ztreonacyclopentane and ACP. Tlie ethyl groups of TEA have p-hydrogeri atoms while the methyl groups of TMA do not<br>
While not intending to he bound by the theory, it is believed that different aluminacyclopentanes (ACPs) can arise when two olefihs are present in solution. For example, if both CHrCHCHjR and CHr=CH2 are present in solution, additional aluminacyclopentanes analogous to C and D are believed to be accessible in a precontacL solution that contained both CH2s=CHCHiR and CHjK^Hj (regardless of whether thti ethylene was introduced pr was derived front AIEts), which could also give rise to the following aluminacyclopentanes E-H, derived from homocoupling of the same two olefins at: a single metal site<br>
As illustrated in Scheme 2, these various aluminacyclopentanes would arise from the analogous zirconacyclopentanes.<br>
in another aspect, this invention encompasses a catalyst composition that comprises a precontacted metallocene, a precontacted olefin or alkyne, a postcontacted acidic activator-support, and an aluminacyelopentane. Thus, the catalyst composition of this invention can comprise an aluminacyelopentane (E, F, G, H) or an aluminacyclopentene (I), whether generated by the reaction schemes disclosed herein, or whether prepared independently. Similarly, this invention also encompasses a catalyst composition that comprises a precontacted metallocene, a precontacted olefin or alkyne, a postcontacted acidic activator-support, and a zirconacyclic species. As indicated in Scheme 2 and the references cited above, this cyclic organometal species can be a zirconacyclopentane (J) or a zirconacyclopentene (K) of any metalloeene used in this invention, whether generated by the<br>

well as by gas (ethane) evolution when TEA is employed as the an organoaluminum compound, Accordingly, one aspect of this invention comprises preparing .organoaluminum metallacyclic compounds, based upon the synthesis of aluminacyclopentanes reported in U.M. Ctehemilev and A.G. Ibragjmov, Journal ofOrganometallic Chemistry, 1994, 466,1-4, and using the reaction mixture comprising -the aluminacyclopentanes in place of the precontacted mixture, according to the present reaction,.<br>
In another aspect of this invention, the components of the precontacted mixture and the postcontacted mixture vary, such that the resulting catalyst composition can be tailored for the desired activity, or the method of preparing the catalyst composition can accommodate the desired polymerization process. For example, in one aspect, the catalyst composition of this invention comprises a precontacted metallocene, a precontacted organoaluminum compound, a postcontacted olefin or alkyne, and a postcontacted acidic activator-support In another aspect, the catalyst composition of this invention comprises it precontacted metallocene, a posteontacted organoaluminum compound, a precontacted olefin or alkyne, and a postcontacted acidic activator-support. In a further aspect, the catalyst: composition of this invention comprises, a 'precontacted metallocene, a postcontacted organoaluminum compound, a precontacted olefin or alkyne, and a precontacted acidic activator-support lit yet another aspect, the catalyst composition of this invention comprises a precontacted metallocene, a precontaeted olefrri or alkyne, a postcontacted acidic activator* support, and an aluminacyclopentane or aluminacyclopentene. In each of these aspects in which the components of the precontacted or postcontacted mixtures vary, the relative amounts, of each component in the precantacfced or postcontacted mixtures are typically within the same ranges as those .disclosed, here for the catalyst composition comprising a precontacted metallocene, a precontacted organoalaminum compound, a precontacted olettn or alkyne, and a postcontacted acidic activator-support<br>
Utility of the Catalyst Compositipn in Polymerization Processes<br>
In one aspect, catalyst composition of this invention can have an activity greater than a catalyst composition mat uses the same components, but does not involve precontacting the organometal compound, the organoaluminum compound, and an olefin or alkyne monomer.<br>
Polymerizations using the catalysts of this invention can be carried out in any manner known in the art Such polymerization .processes include, but are not limited to slurry polymerizations, gas phase polymerizations, solution polymerizations, and the like, including multi-reactor combinations thereof Thus, any polymerization zone known in the art to produce ethylene-containing polymers can be utilized. For example, a stirred reactor can be utilized for a batch process, or the reaction can be carried Out continuously in a loop reactor or in a continuous stirred reactor.<br>
After catalyst activation, a catalyst, composition is used to homopolymerize ethylene, or copolymerize ethylene with a comonomer. In 'one aspect, a typical polymerization method is a slurry polymerization process (also known as the particle form process), which is well known in the art and is disclosed, for example in U.S. Patent No. 3,248,179, which is incorporated by reference herein, in its entirety. Other polymerization methods of the present invention for slurry processes are those employing a loop reactor of the type disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,248,179, and those utilized in a plurality of stirred reactors either in series, parallel, or combinations thereof, wherein the reaction conditions are different in the different reactors, which is also incorporated by reference herein, in its entirety.<br>

Pretreatmeat pressures ate typically, but not necessarily, lower Own polymerization pressures, arid generally range from atmospheric pressure to 100 psig (791 kilopascal (kPa)). In one aspect, pretreatment pressures are from atmospheric pressure to 50 psig (446 kPa).<br>
In yet another aspect, (he polymerization reaction pressure can be any pressure that does not terminate the polymerization reaction, and it typically conducted at a pressure higher than the pretreatment pressures.

Further, hydrogen can be used in the polymerization process of mis invention to control polymer molecular weight.<br>
When a coporymer of ethylene is prepared according to this invention, comonomer is introduced into the reaction zone in sufficient quantity to produce the desired polymer composition. A typical copolymer composition is generally from 0.01 to 10 weight percent comonomer based on the total weight of the monomer and comonomer, however this co-polymer composition varies outside mis range depending upon the copolymer specification and desired composition. Thus, any amount of copolymer sufficient to give the described polymer composition in the copolymer produced can be used.<br>
Polymerizations using the catalysts of this invention can be carried out in any manner known in the art. Such processes that can-polymerize monomers into polymers include, but: are not limited to slurry polymerizations, gas phase polymerizations, solution polymerizations, and multi-reactor combinations thereof. Thus, any polymerization zone known in the art to produce olefin-containing polymers can be utilized. In one aspect, for example, a stirred reactor can be utilized for a batch process, or the reaction can be carried out continuously in a loop reactor or in a continuous stirred reactor. In another aspect, for example, the polymerizations disclosed herein are carried out using a slurry polymerization process in a loop reaction zone. Suitable diluents used in slurry polymerization are well known in the art and include hydrocarbons, which are liquid under reaction conditions. The term "diluent" as'used in this disclosure does not necessarily mean an inert material, as this term is meant to include compounds arid compositions that may contribute to polymerization process. Examples of hydrocarbons that can be used as diluents include, but are not limited to, cycldhexane, isobutane, n-butane, propane, n-pentane, isopentane, neopentane, and n-<br>
hexane. Typically, isobutane is used as the diluent in a slurry polymerization. Examples of this technology are found hi U.S. Patent Nos. 4,424,341; 4,501,885; 4,613,484; 4,737,280; and 5,597,892; each of which is incorporated by reference herein, in its entirety.<br>

Heat and pressure can be employed appropriately to obtain optimal polymerization reaction conditions.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the polymerization reactor can comprise a solution polymerization reactor. During solution polymerization, the monomer is contacted with the catalyst composition by suitable stirring or other means. A carrier comprising an inert organic diluent or excess monomer can be employed. If desired, the monomer can be brought in the vapor phase into contact with the catalytic reaction product, in the presence or absence of liquid material. The polymerization zone is maintained at temperatures and pressures that will result in the formation of a solution of die polymer in a reaction medium. Agitation can be employed during polymerization to obtain better temperature control and to maintain uniform polymerization mixtures throughout the polymerization zone. Adequate means are utilized for dissipating the exothermic heat of polymerization. The polymerization can be<br>
effected in a batch manner, or in a continuous manner. The reactor can comprise a series o!:~ at least one separator that employs high pressure and low pressure to separate the desired polymer.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, the polymerization reactor system can comprise the combination of two or more reactors. Production of polymers in multiple reactors car include several stages in at least two separate polymerization reactors interconnected by a transfer device making it possible .to transfer the polymers resulting from the first: polymerization reactor into the second reactor. The desired polymerization conditions in one: of the reactors can be different from the operating conditions of the other reactors, Alternatively, polymerization in. multiple reactors can include the manual transfer of polymer from one reactor to subsequent reactors for continued polymerization. Such reactors can include any combination including, but not limited to, multiple loop reactors, multiple gas reactors, a combination of loop and gas 'reactors, a combination of autoclave reactors or solution reactors with gas at loop reactors, multiple solution reactors, or multiple autoclave reactors.<br>
In another aspect of this invention, the catalyst can be made in a variety of methods, including, hut not limited to, continuously feeding the catalyst components directly into the polymerization reactor, including at least one -optional precontacting step of some or all the catalyst components prior io introducing them into the reactor. In this aspect, each optional precontacting steps can involve precontacting for a different time period. In this aspect, the invention can encompass multiple, optional precontacting. steps, for multiple time periods, prior to initiating (be polymerization reaction. Further, these multiple, optional precontacting steps can take place in at least one precontacting vessel prior to introducing the precontacted components into the reactor, they can take place in the polymerization reactor itself, or any combination thereof, including the use. of multiple precontacting vessels comprising different catalyst components. Thus, in mis aspect, any precontacting steps can encompass precontacting of any combination of catalyst components, including any optional catalyst components. Also in this aspect, the multiple, optional precontacting steps can involve different precontacting time periods.<br>
In another aspect of this invention, the catalyst can be made by continuously feeding die catalyst components into any number of optional precontacting vessels and subsequently<br>
introducing the components continuously Into flic reactor.  In one aspect, for example, ifa present invention provides a process to produce a catalyst composition, comprising:<br>
contacting at least one metallocene, at least one organoaluminum compound, and at least one olefin or alkyne for a first period of time to form a precontacted mixture comprising at least one precontacted metallocene, at least one precontacted organoalurnininn compound, and at least one precontacted olefin or alkyne; and<br>
contacting tho precontacted mixture with at least one acidic activator-support for a second period of time to form a postcontaeted mixture comprising at least one postcontaeted metallocene, at least one posteontacted organoaluminum compound, at least one postcontaeted olefin or alkyne, and at least one posfcontacted acidic activator-support.<br>
In another aspect, for example, the present invention provides a process to produce ;i catalyst composition, comprising:<br>
contacting at least two, catalyst components comprising at least one metallocene, at least one organoaluminum compound, at least one olefin or alkyne, or at least one acidic activator-support for a first period of time to form a precontacted mixture comprising precontacted catalyst components; and<br>
contacting OK precontacted mixture with any catalyst components not used to fonn the precontacted mixture, and optionally contacting the precontacted mixture with additional catalyst components comprising at least one metallocene, at least one organoaluminum compound, at least one olefin or alkyne, or at least one acidic activator-support for a second period of time to form a postcontaeted mixture comprising at least one postcontaeted metallocene, at least one posfcontacted organoaluminum compound, at least one postcontaeted olefin or alkyne, and at least one postcontaeted acidic activator-support.<br>
In another aspect, each ingredient can be fed to the reactor, either directly or through at least one precoatacting vessel, using known feeding, measuring, and controlling devices, such as pumps, mass and volumetric flow meters and controllers, and die like. Feed-hack signals and control loops can be used in connection with ibis continuous catalyst formation and introduction. The mass flow meter can be a coriolis-type meter adapted to measure a variety of flow types such as from a positive displacement-type pump with three heads. Other types of pumps, meters, and combinations of similar types of devices can be used as means for feed and control to measure and control a feed Tate of a catalyst component.<br>
Various combinations of means for feed and control can also be used for each respective component depending upon the type of component, chemical compatibility of the component, and the desired quantity and flow rate of the component, and as well known to one of ordinary skill in the ait. For example, a suitable meter for means for feed and control can be, but is not limited to, a thermal mass flow meter, a volumetric flow meter such as an orifice-type, diaphragm-type, a level-type meter, or the like.<br>
In another aspect, the catalyst components can he combined in a variety or different orders and combinations prior to being introduced into the polymerization reactor. In one aspect, for example, the metallocene can be precontacted with an aluminum alkyl and an olefin in a first precontacting vessel, for a first precontacting time, for example, up to 7-ID days, to form a first precontacted solution. This first precontacted solution can then be fed to a second precontacting vessel along with the treated solid oxide component, and optionally more aluminum alkyl, for a second precqntacting time. Jn this aspect, for example, th<: second precontacting time can be shorter longer or the same as first time. for example hour .after which mixture fed from vessel directly into reactor itself. in another aspect of mis invention all catalyst components brought together the: period prior to being introduced reactor.></:>
In another aspect, a portion of eatb catalyst component can be fed into the reactor directly, while the remainder is fed into a precontacting vessel. In mis aspect, for example, it is sometimes desirable to limit the exposure of the metallocene or treated solid oxide to the aluminum alkyl, in which casje only a small amount of aluminum alkyl can be introduced into the precontacting vessel, either alone or from a solution also containing the olefin and metallocene, while the remainder of the aluminum alkyl can be fed directly into the reactor. Likewise, the amount of olefin fed as part of the catalyst preparation may be fed from multiple sources. For example, 1-hexene may be added to .the metallocene solution in a first precontacting step to form a first precontacted solution, more 1-hexene may be added separately in a second precontacting step to form a second precontaqted solution, and still more 1-hexene may be added directly to' the reactor. Similarly any of the other catalyst components pan also be added in multiple steps to the entire reactor system.<br>
After the polymers are produced, they can be fanned into various articles, including but not limited to, household containers, utensils, film products, drums, fuel tanks, pipes, geomembranes, and linens. Various processes can fbrra these articles. In one aspect, additives and modifiers can be added to the polymer in order to provide particular desired effects.<br>
Definitions<br>
In order to more clearly define the terms used herein, the following definitions tire provided. To the extent that any definition or usage provided by any document incorporated herein by reference conflicts wife the definition or usage provided herein, the definition or usage provided herein controls.<br>
The term polymer is used herein to mean horaopolymers comprising ethylere, copolymers of ethylene and another olefinic comonomcr, or any combination thereof. The term polymer is also used herein to mean homoporymers and copolymers of acetylenes.<br>
The term cocatalyst is used herein to refer to the at least one organoaluminum compound mat constitutes a. component Of Che catalyst mixture. Typical coeatalysts are trialkyl aluminum compounds, difilkyl aluminum halide compounds, and alkyl aluminum dihalide compounds..

The term inert atmosphere is used herein to refer to any type of ambient atmosphere mat is substantially unreactive toward .the particular reaction, process, or material around which the atmosphere surrounds or blankets. Thus, this term is typically used herein to refer to the use of a substantially oxygen-free and moisture-free blanketing gas, including but noi: limited to dry argon, dry nitrogen, dry helium, or mixtures thereof, when any precursor, component, intermediate, or product of a reaction or process is sensitive to particular gases 01 moisture. Additionally, inert atmosphere is also used herein to refer to the use of dry air as a blanketing atmosphere when the precursors, components, intermediates, or products of the reaction or process are only moisture-sensitive and not oxygen-sensitive. However, inert atmosphere as used herein would typically exclude CQz ox CO because these gases would be expected to be reactive toward the particular reaction, process, or material around which they would surround or blanket, despite their occasional use as inert blanketing gases b other processes.<br>
The term precontacted mixture is. used herein to describe a first mixture of catalyst components that are contacted for a first period of time prior to the first mixture being used to form a postcontacted or second mixture of catalyst components that are contacted for a second period of time. In one aspect of the invention, the precontacted mixture describes a mixture of metallocene, olefin or alkyne monomer, and organoaluminum compound, before this mixture is contacted with the acidic activator-support and optionally an organoaluminum compound. Thus, precontacted describes components that are used to contact each other, hut prior to contacting the components in die second,, postcontacted mixture. Accordingly, this invention may occasionally distinguish between a component used to prepare the precontacted mixture and that component after the mixture has been prepared. For example, according to this description) it is possible for the piecontacted organoaluminum compound, once it is admixed with the metalldcehe-aod the olefin or alkyne monomer, to have reacted to form at least one different chemical compound, formulation, or structure from the distinct organoaluminum compound used to prepare 'the precontacted mixture. In this case, the precontacted organoaluminum compound1 or component is described as comprising an organoaluminum compound that Was used to prepare the precontacted mixture.<br>
Similarly, the term postcontacted mixture is .used herein to describe a second mixture of catalyst components that ate contacted for a second period of time, and one constituent of which is the preeontacted or first mixture of catalyst components that were contacted for a first period of time. Typically, the term postcontacted mixture is used herein to describe Ibe mixture of metallocene, olefin or alkyne monomer, organoaluminum compound, and aciclic activator-support, formed from contacting the precontacted mixture of a portion of these components with the any additional components added to make up the postcontacted mixture. Generally, the additional component added to make up the postcontacted mixture is the acidic activator-support, and optionally may include an organoaluminura compound the same or different from the organoaluminum compound, ased to, prepare the precontacted mixture, as described herein. Accordingly, this invention may also occasionally distinguish between a component used to prepare the postcontacted mixture and that component after the mixture has been prepared.<br>

analogs or derivatives. Thus, the meteflocenes of this invention typically comprise at least one cyclopentadienyl, indenyl, fluorenyl, orTjoralabenfceiie ligand, or substituted derivatives thereof. Possible substituents on these, ligands include hydrogen, therefore the description "substituted derivatives thereof" in this invention comprises partially saturated ligands such as tetrahydroindenyl, tetrahydrofluorenyl, octahydrofluorenyl, partially saturated indenyl, partially saturated fluorenyl, substituted partially saturated indenyl, substituted partially saturated fluorenyl, and the like. In some contexts, the metallocene may be referred to simply as the "catalyst", in much the same way the term "cocatalysf1 may be used herein to refer to an organs-aluminum compound.<br>
The terms catalyst composition, catalyst mixture, and the like are used herein to refer to either the preeontacted mixture or the postcontacted mixture as the context requires. The use of these terms does not depend upon the actual product of the reaction of the components of the mixtures, the nature of the active catalytic site, or the fate of the aluminum cocatalyst, metallocene compound, olefin or alkyne monomer used to prepare the preeontacted mixture, or the specific reactions of the acidic activator-support after combining these component;. Therefore, the terms catalyst composition, catalyst mixture, and the like include both heterogeneous compositions and homogenous compositions.<br>
The term hydrocarbyl is used to specify a hydrocarbon radical group that includes, but is not limited to aryl, alkyl, eycloalkyl, alkeayl, cycloalkenyl, cycloalkadienyl, alkynyl, aralkyl, aralkenyl, aralkynyl, and the like, end includes all substituted, unsubstituted, branched, linear, heteroatom substituted derivatives thereof.<br>
The terms solid acidic activator-support, acidic activator-support, or simply activator-support, and the like are used herein to indicate, a treated, solid, inorganic oxide of relatively high porosity, which exhibits Lewis acidic or Brernsted acidic behavior, and which has beer, treated with an electron-withdrawing component, typically an anion, and which is calcined The electron-withdrawing component is typically an electron-withdrawing anion source compound. Thus, in one aspect, the treated solid oxide compound comprises the calcined contact product of at least one solid oxide compound with at least one electron-withdrawing anion source compound. In another aspect; the activator-support or "treated solid oxide compound" comprises at least one ionizing, acidic solid oxide compound.

EXAMPLE!   -Preparation of a Fluoride^ Silica-Alumina Acidic Activator-Support<br>
The silica-alumina used to prepare the fluorided silica-alumina acidic activator-support in this Example was obtained from W.R. Gtace as Grade MS 13-110, containing 13%<br>
alumina, having a pore volume of 1.2 co/g and a surface area of 400 ra2/g. This material wiis fluorided by impregnation to incipient wetness with a solution containing ammoaiu-n bifluoride in an amount sufficient to equal 10 wt % of the weight of the silica-alumina. This impregnated material was then dried in a vacuum oven for 8 hours at 100°C. The thus-fluorided silica-alumina samples were then calcined as follows. 10 grams of the alumina were placed in a 1.75-inch quartz .tube fitted with a sintered quartz disk at the bottom. While the silica was supported on the disk, dry air .was blown up through the disk at the linear rale of 1.6 to 1.8 standard cubic feet per hour. An electric furnace around the quartz tube was used to increase the temperature of the tube at the rate of 400°C per hour to a finiJ temperature of 450°C. At this temperature,' the silica-alumina was allowed to fluidize for three hours in the dry air. Afterward, the silica-alumina was collected and stored under dry nitrogen, and was used without exposure to the atmosphere.<br>

A stock solution of 45 mg of bis(cyclopetttadi«ryl)zirconium dichloride in 45 mL of dry, degassed toluene was prepared for the experiments of Table 1.

autoclave. The autoclave was sealed, 2 lifers of isobutane Were added, along with 20 g of I -hexene and 1 mL of 15 wt % triethylaluminum (TEA) in heptane. Stirring was initiated and maintained at 700 rpm as the reactor was heated to 90"C over a period of 2 minutes. The total pressure was brought to 550 psig (3890 ,kPa) with ethylene. Ethylene was fed to hie reactor on demand to maintain the pressure at 550 psig (3890 kPa). After 1 hr, the stirrer and heating were then stopped and the reactor wasiapidry depressurized.

This precontacted solution was then charged to the 1 gallon (3.785 L) autoclave immediately followed by 200 mg of the activator-support. The autoclave was men sealed and 2 L of isobutane, along with 20 g of 1-hexene, were quickly added to the reactor. Stirring was initiated and maintained at 700 rpm as the reactor was heated to 90°C over a period of 2 minutes. The total pressure was brought to 550 psig (3890 kPa) with ethylene. Thus, the postcontacted mixture, containing the precontacted solution and the support activator, was allowed to remain in contact for a period of 2 minutes prior to introducing ethylene. Ethylene was fed to the reactor on demand to maintain; the pressure at 550 psig (3890 kPa). After 53 minutes, the stirrer and heating were then stopped and the reactor was rapidly depressurized. The autoclave was then opened and the solid polyethylene was physically removed.

Stirring was initiated and maintained at 700 rpm as the reactor was heated to 80°C over a period:of 2 minutes. The total pressure was brought to 450 psig (3200 kPa) with ethylene. Thus, the postcontacted mixture, containing the precontacted solution and the support activator, was allowed to remain in contact for a period of 2 minutes prior to introducing ethylene. Ethylene was fed to the reactor on demand to maintain the pressure at 450 psig (3200 kPa). After $0 minutes, die stirrer and heating were then stopped and the reactor was rapidly depiessuijzed. The autoclave was then opened and the solid polyethylene was physically removed.<br>

wherein Rl is melhyl, R2 is butenyl (-CHzCHaQKBa), and R3 is H.<br>
Example SA represents a standard catalytic run, that was obtained as follows. Under a nitrogen atmosphere, 2 mL of 1-hexene,' 2 roL of a solution of catalyst solution prepared from [T)s-cyclopentadienylrT|S-{9-fhiorBnyl)' bex-1-ene] zirconium dichloride, CH2=CHCHaCH2C(CH3)(CpX9-Flti)ZrCl3, in toluene (2 mg/mL), arid 1 mL of 15 wt. % triethylaluminum in hq&gt;tane solution were added to a Diels-Alder tube. This solution was immediately added to 250 mg of activator-support Thus, Example SA of Table 4 represents polymerization data obtained from . the near simultaneous contacting of CHj=CHCH2CH2C(CH3)(Cp)(?-Flu)ZrCl2, TEA, 1-hexene, and fluorided silica-alumina activator-support, without precontacting the onsa-metallocene, triethylalummum (TEA), and 1-hexene, and therefore provides a baseline .for comparison with Examples SB and SC.<br>
Example SB represents a catalytic run obtained in the same manner as the standard run of Example 5 A, except that Example SB included a precontacting step of 0.25 hours for the metallocene CHiHSHCHzCHjCfCHjjXC^XS-^ZrClsi TEA, and 1-hexene, prior to contacting this mixture with the fluorided silica-alumina activator-support.<br>
Example SC represents a catalytic run obtained in the same manner as the standard run of Example 5 A, except that Example 5C included no precontacting of the metallocene, TEA, and 1-hexene, but instead included a "postcoritacted" step (according to the definitions herein) of 0.50 hours in which all components, namely the metallocete CH2<:hch2ch2c tea l-hexener and we fluorided silicji-alumina activator-support were contacted prior to adding this posteontacted mixture the reactor example demonstrates that an increase in activity is obtained by precontacting metallocene hexane whereas when all reactants are initiating a polymerization run decrease was observed.></:hch2ch2c>
Example 5D was prepared as follows. The metallocene catalyst: CH2=CHCH2GH2CCCH3XCp)(9-FUi)Zra2 (24 rag) was placed in a Diels-Alder tube and maintained in the dark by covering the tube with aluminum foil. A 12-mL sample of dry heptane (but no hexene) was added and this mixture was stirred while 2 mL of 15 wL % triethylaluminum in heptane was added. This slurry was stirred in the dark at roorr. temperature for 17 hours, to provide a light yellow solution. This sample was maintained fan the dark until use. Example 5D included a "posteontactbg" step of 0.25 hours for 2 rnLs of this precontacted solution, 1 mL of 15 wt % TEA, and the fluorided silica-alumina activator-support prior to adding to the reactor. Example 5D provides a baseline for comparison of Examples 5E and 5F.<br>
Example 5E was prepared as .follows. The metallocene catalyst CHi=CHCHiCH2C(CHj)(CpK9-Flu)ZrCl2 (24 mg) was placed in a Diels-Alder tube and maintained in the dark by covering the tube with aluminum foil. A 12-mL sample of 1 -hexene was added and this mixture: was stirred while 2 mL of IS wt % triethylaluminum in heptane was added. This slurry was stirred in Hie dark at room temperature for 17 hours, to provide a dark yellow solution in which all the catalyst had .dissolved. This sample was maintained in the dark until use. This Example included a "postcontacting" step of 0.25 hours for 2 mLs of this solution, 1 mL of .15 wt % TEA, and the fluorided silica-alumina activator-support prior to adding to the reactor;<br>
Example 5F was prepared as follows, The metallocene catalyst (10 mg) was placed m a Diels-Alder tube, to which 20 mL of 1-hexene and 2 mL of 15 wt % triethylalurainutn in heptane were added. This mixture was maintained in the dark and the Diels-Alder tube was put m an ultra sonic bath and sonicated for 10 minutes. A dark yellow solution was obtained in which all the catalyst had dissolved. This sample was maintained in the dark until use. This Example included a "postcontacting" step of 0.25 hours for 4 mLs of this solutioni 1 mL of 15 wt % TEA, and the fluorided silica-alumina activator-support prior to adding to the reactor. Examples 5E and 5F show that a large increase in activity is obtained by precontacting the metallocene, TEA and 1-hexene compared to Example 5D, where 1-hexene was excluded.<br>
Polymerization reactions were carried out as follows. Following any preedntact and postcontact steps for a particular sample, a catalyst, slurry (comprising metallocene, organoalummum, olefin, and activator-support) was added to a 1 -gallon (3.785 L) autoclave<br>
under an isobutane purge. The autoclave was sealed, 2 liters of isobutane were added, and stirring was initiated and maintained at 700 tpin. The reactor was quickly heated to 80°C over &amp; period of 2 minutes. A 25-g sample of 1-hexene was forced into the reactor, and the total pressure was brought to 450 psig (3200 kPa) with ethylene. Ethylene was fed to the reactor on demand to maintain me ^pressure at 450 paig (3200 kPa) for 1 hour. The stirrer and heating were then stopped and the -reactor was rapidly depressurized. The autoclave was then opened and (he solid polyethylene was physically removed.<br>
