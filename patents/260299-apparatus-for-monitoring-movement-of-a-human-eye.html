FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to apparatus, systems, and methods for<br>
monitoring movement of a human eye, e.g., for monitoring fatigue, purposeful communication, and/or controlling devices based upon movement of an eye, eyelid, and/or<br>
other components of the eye or eyes of a person.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
It has been suggested to use movement of the human eye to monitor involuntary<br>
conditions, such as a person's wakefulness or drowsiness. For example, U.S. Patent No.<br>
3,863,243 discloses a device that sounds an alarm to warn a person using the device that<br>
they are beginning to fell asleep. The device includes a frame similar to a set of eyeglasses<br>
onto which is mounted an optical fiber and a photocell that are directed towards the user's<br>
eye when the frame is worn. The photocell detects the intensity of light reflected off of the<br>
user's eye, i.e., either by the eyelid when the eye is closed or the eye surface when the eye<br>
is open. A timer distinguishes between regular blinks, and an extended time period during<br>
which the eye is closed, i.e., a time period that may indicate that the person is falling<br>
asleep. When a threshold time elapses, an alarm is sounded to notify and/or wake the user.<br>
Another device is the Alertness Monitor by MTI Research Inc., which may be<br>
mounted on safety glasses, and emits a continuous infrared beam of light along the axis of<br>
the eyelid at a strategic position where the beam cannot be broken by the eyelashes except<br>
during an eyeblink, giving it the ability to measure eyeblink frequency. Other devices,<br>
such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,469,143 and 4,359,724, directly engage the<br>
eyelid or eyebrow of a user to detect movement of the eye and activate an alarm when a<br>
drowsiness condition is detected. Such devices may include mechanical devices, e.g., a<br>
mechanical arm, or a piezo-electric film against the eyelid.<br>
It has been suggested to mount cameras or other devices to a dashboard, roof, or<br>
other location in a vehicle to monitor a driver's awareness. Such devices, however,<br>
require the user to maintain constant eye contact with the camera. In addition, they do not<br>
monitor eyelid movement if the user turns his head sideways or downwards, turns around,<br><br>
exits the vehicle, if the user moves around rapidly, or if the camera moves relative to the<br>
individual. Further, such cameras may violate privacy and/or have problems seeing<br>
through eyeglasses, sunglasses, or even contact lenses, and may not operate effectively in<br>
sunlight.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention is directed to apparatus, systems, and methods for<br>
monitoring movement of one or more eyes, eyelids, and/or pupils of a subject. Generally,<br>
humans blink at least about 5-30 times per minute, or about 7,000-43,000 times per day.<br>
Each involuntary-reflexive blink lasts about 200-300 milliseconds, generally averaging<br>
about 250 milliseconds, amounting to about 1,750-10,800 seconds per day of eye closure<br>
due to involuntary blinking. As tiredness or sleepiness occurs, the eye blink may get<br>
longer and slower and/or the blink rate may vary, and/or the eyelids may begin to droop<br>
with small amplitude eye lid blinks, e.g., until the eyes begin to close for short term<br>
"microsleeps," i.e., sleep conditions that last for about 3-5 seconds or longer, or for<br>
prolonged sleep. Furthermore, the pupils may constrict more sluggishly, show unstable<br>
fluctuations in size, shrinking progressively in diameter, and/or demonstrate delayed<br>
responses to light flashes (i.e. delayed pupil response latency) as sleepiness and fatigue<br>
progresses. In addition, other ocular manifestations of drowsiness may occur, such as slow<br>
or delayed saccadic eye tracking responses, e.g., to a stimulus (i.e., delayed saccadic<br>
response latency), with either over- or under-shooting the target, and/or a loss of directed<br>
, gaze with or without binocular vergence or divergence, eye drift, or esophoria.<br>
In one embodiment, an apparatus for monitoring eyelid, pupil, and/or eye<br>
movement is provided that includes a device configured to be worn on a person's head, a<br>
light source for directing light towards the eyes of the person when the device is worn, and<br>
first and second fiberoptic bundles coupled to the device, the first bundle positioned for<br>
viewing a first eye of the person wearing the device, the second bundle positioned for<br>
viewing a second eye of the person wearing the device. The apparatus may also include a<br>
camera coupled to the first and second bundles for acquiring images of the first and second<br>
eyes.<br>
Optionally, the apparatus may also include a third fiberoptic bundle oriented away<br>
from the user, e.g., for viewing a region towards which the user's head is turned. In<br><br>
addition or alternatively, the apparatus may carry one or more spatial sensors. The camera<br>
may be coupled to the first and second bundles for acquiring images of the first and second<br>
eyes, as well as to the third bundle for acquiring images of the area towards which the<br>
user's head and/or eyes are directed. The spatial sensors may allow simultaneous<br>
measuring or tracking of the user's head movement, e.g., relative to the user's eye<br>
movements. In addition, the arrays of emitters and/or sensors coupled to the camera may<br>
allow measurement of a variety of oculometric parameters of one or both eyes, such as<br>
eyelid velocity, acceleration and deceleration, eye blink frequency, "PERCLOS"<br>
(percentage of time the eyelid is open), the vertical height of the palpebral fissure (i.e. the<br>
region between the eye lids not covering the pupil), e.g., as a distance or percentage related<br>
to a completely open eye, and the like.<br>
In another embodiment, a self-contained device is provided for detecting<br>
movement of a person's eyelid that includes a device adapted to be worn on the person's<br>
head, an emitter on the device for directing light towards an eye of the person when the<br>
device is worn, and a camera for detecting light from the emitter. The sensor produces an<br>
output signal indicating when the eye is open or closed, and a transmitter on the frame is<br>
coupled to the sensor for wireless transmission of the output signal to a remote location.<br>
The frame may also include a processor for comparing the output signal to a<br>
predetermined threshold to detect drowsiness-induced eyelid movement. Similar to the<br>
previous embodiments, the emitter and sensor may be a solid state biosensor device for<br>
emitting and detecting infrared light, or alternatively an array, e.g., one or two dimensional<br>
array, of emitters and/or sensors in a predetermined configuration on the frame, e.g., in a<br>
vertical, horizontal, diagonal, or other linear or other geometric array of more than one<br>
emitter and/or sensor oriented towards one or both eyes. In particular, an array of emitters<br>
and/or sensors may allow measurement of oculometric parameters, such as those identified<br>
elsewhere herein.<br>
The emitter and/or sensors may be affixed to any number of points on the frame,<br>
e.g., around the lens and/or in the nose bridge, or alternatively anywhere along the frame,<br>
including near or on the nasal portion of the frame, the attachment of a temple piece of the<br>
frame, and/or surface mounted on the lens of an eyeglass. Alternatively, the emitter and/or<br>
sensor may be embedded in the lens of an eyeglass, or otherwise such that they operate<br>
through the lens. Thus, the emitters) and/or sensor(s) may be fixed on an eye-frame such<br><br>
that they move with the wearer's head movements, and continuously focus on the user's<br>
eyes in any body position, whether the user is in a vehicle, outdoors or in any other<br>
environment.<br>
In still another embodiment, a system is provided for monitoring movement of a<br>
person's eye. The system includes a device configured to be worn on a person's head, one<br>
or more emitters on the device for directing light towards an eye of the person when the<br>
device is worn, and a camera, e.g., a CCD or CMOS device. The emitter(s) may be<br>
configured for projecting a reference frame towards the eye. The camera may be oriented<br>
towards the eye for monitoring movement of the eye relative to the reference frame. The<br>
camera may be provided on the device or may be provided remote from the device, but in<br>
relatively close proximity to the user.<br>
Light from the emitters) may be emitted towards the eye of a user wearing the<br>
device to illuminate the eye(s) of the user, while projecting a reference frame onto the eye.<br>
The emitters) may project light "invisibly" to the user, i.e., outside the scotopic (night-<br>
vision) or photopic (day-vision) range of normal vision, e.g., in the infrared light range,<br>
such that the illumination and/or reference frame do not interfere substantially with the<br>
user's vision. The camera may image light produced by the emitters, e.g., in the infrared<br>
light range, thereby detecting the projected light as a spot of light, band of light or other<br>
"glint." Movement of the eye relative to the reference frame may be monitored with the<br>
camera. A graphical output of the movement monitored by the camera, e.g., relative to a<br>
reference frame projected onto the eye, may be monitored. For example, infrared light<br>
from the emitters may be reflected off of the retina as a "red reflex" under white light, as a<br>
white or dark black pupil under infrared light, including the image of a dark pupil using<br>
methods of subtraction known in the art.<br>
A processor, e.g., using one or more of these methods, may detect movement of the<br>
eye's pupil, e.g., measuring movement relative to the reference frame. This movement<br>
may be graphically displayed, showing the movement of the eye's pupil relative to the<br>
reference frame. Optionally, the output signal from the one or more sensors may be<br>
correlated with video signals produced by the camera monitoring movement of the eye<br>
relative to the reference frame, e.g., to determine the person's level of drowsiness, or<br>
psycho- or neuro-physiological cognitive, emotional, and/or alertness-related state of mind.<br><br>
In yet another embodiment, a method is provided for controlling a computing<br>
device or other electronic or electro-mechanical device (e.g. radio, television, wheel-chair,<br>
telephone, alarm system, audible, visible or tactile alerting system, etc.) using a device<br>
worn on a user's head. The device may include one or more components, similar to other<br>
embodiments described herein, including a camera having at least one objective lens<br>
directed towards at least one eye of the user. The computer device may include a display<br>
including a pointer displayed on the display. The display may include a heads-up or<br>
heads-down display attached to the device worn on the user's head or otherwise attached<br>
or disposed on the user's head, a desk computer monitor that may be disposed in front of<br>
the user, a digitally projected image on a screen (e.g., as in a drive or flight simulator), and<br>
the like. Movement of the user's eye(s) may be monitored using the camera, and<br>
movement of the eye(s) may be correlated relative to the pointer on Ihe display to cause the<br>
pointer to follow movement of the eye(s), e.g., similar to a computer mouse. Optionally,<br>
the camera may monitor the user's eye(s) for predetermined eye activities, e.g., blinks for<br>
predetermined lengths of time, that may correspond to instructions to execute one or more<br>
commands identified with the pointer on the display, e.g., similar to "double-clicking" on a<br>
computer mouse.<br>
Other aspects and features of the present invention will become apparent from<br>
consideration of the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Turning to the drawings, FIG. 1 shows a patient 10 in a bed 12 wearing a detection<br>
device 30 for detecting eye and/or eyelid movement of the patient 10. The detection<br>
device 30 may include any of the biosensor devices described herein, which may be used<br>
for monitoring voluntary movement of the eye, e.g., for purposeful communication, for<br><br>
monitoring involuntary eye movement, e.g., drowsiness or other conditions, and/or for<br>
controlling of one or more electronic devices (not shown). The detection device 30 may<br>
be coupled to a processing box 130 that converts the detected eye and/or eyelid movement<br>
into a stream of data, an understandable message, and/or into other information, which<br>
may be communicated, for example, using a video display 50, to a medical care provider<br>
40.<br>
Turning to FIGS. 2,6A, and 7A, an exemplary embodiment of an apparatus or<br>
system 14 is shown that includes an aimable and focusable detection device 30 that is<br>
attachable to a conventional pair of eyeglasses 20. The eyeglasses 20 include a pair of<br>
lenses 21 attached to a frame 22, which includes bridgework 24 extending between the<br>
lenses 21, and side members or temple pieces 25 carrying ear pieces 26, all of which are<br>
conventional; Alternatively, because the lenses 21 may not be necessary, the frame 22<br>
may also be provided without the lenses 21.<br>
The detection device 30 includes a clamp or other mechanism 27 for attaching to<br>
one of the side members 25 and an adjustable arm 31 onto which is mounted one or more<br>
emitters 32 and sensors 33 (one shown). The emitter 32 and sensor 33 are mounted in a<br>
predetermined relationship such that the emitter 32 may emit a signal towards an eye 300<br>
of a person wearing the eyeglasses 20 and the sensor 33 may detect the signal reflected<br>
from the surface of the eye 300 and eyelid 302. In the exemplary embodiment shown in<br>
FIGS. 6A and 7A, the emitter 32 and sensor 33 may be mounted adjacent one another.<br>
Alternatively, as shown in FIGS. 6B and 7B, the emitter 32' and sensor 33' may be<br>
mounted on the frame separately away from one another, e.g., such that the emitter 32' and<br>
sensor 33' are disposed substantially laterally with respect to each other. In a further<br>
alternative, shown in FIGS. 6C and 7C, the emitter 32" and sensor 33" may be mounted<br>
across the eye 300 in axial alignment with another. As the eyelid 302 closes, it may break<br>
the beam 340 being detected by the sensor 33".<br>
In one embodiment, the emitter 32 and sensor 33 produce and detect continuous or<br>
pulsed light, respectively, e.g., within the infrared range to minimize distraction or<br>
interference with the wearer's normal vision. The emitter 32 may emit light in pulses at a<br>
predetermined frequency and the sensor 33 is configured to detect light pulses at the<br>
predetermined frequency. This pulsed operation may reduce energy consumption by the<br>
emitter 32 and/or may minimize interference with other light sources. Alternatively, other<br><br>
predetermined frequency ranges of light beyond or within the visible spectrum, such as<br>
ultraviolet light, or other forms of energy, such as radio waves, sonic waves, and the like,<br>
may be used.<br>
The processing box 130 is coupled to the detection device 30 by a cable 34<br>
including one or more wires therein (not shown). As shown in FIG. 9, the processing box<br>
130 may include a central processing unit (GPU) 140 and/or other circuitry, such as the<br>
exemplary circuitry shown in FIGS. 3-5, for receiving and/or processing an output signal<br>
142, such as a light intensity signal, from the sensor 33. The processing box 130 may also<br>
include control circuitry 141 for controlling the emitter 32 and/or the sensor 33, or the<br>
CPU 140 may include internal control circuitry.<br>
For example, in one embodiment, the control circuitry 141 may control the emitter<br>
32 to produce a flickering infrared signal pulsed at a predetermined frequency, as high as<br>
thousands of pulses per second to as little as about 4-5 pulses per second, e.g., at least<br>
about 5-20 pulses per second, thereby facilitating detection of non-purposeful or<br>
purposeful eyeblinks as short as about 200 milliseconds per blink. The sensor 33 may be<br>
controlled to detect light pulses only at the predetermined frequency specific to the flicker<br>
frequency of the emitter 32. Thus, by synchronizing the emitter 32 and the sensor 33 to<br>
the predetermined frequency, the system 10 may be used under a variety of ambient<br>
conditions without the output signal 142 being substantially affected by, for example,<br>
bright sun light, total darkness, ambient infrared light backgrounds, or other emitters<br>
operating at different flicker frequencies. The flicker frequency may be adjusted to<br>
maximize the efficient measurement of the number of eye blinks per unit time (e.g. about<br>
ten to about twenty eye blinks per minute), the duration of each eye blink (e.g. about 200<br>
milliseconds to about 300 milliseconds), and/or PERCLOS (i.e., the percentage of time<br>
that the eyelid is completely or partially closed), or to maximize efficiency of the system,<br>
while keeping power consumption to a minimum.<br>
The control circuitry 141 and/or processing box 130 may include manual and/or<br>
software controls (not shown) for adjusting the frequency, focus, or intensity of the light<br>
emitted by the emitter 32, to turn the emitter 32 off and on, to adjust the threshold<br>
sensitivity of the sensor 33, and/or to allow for self-focusing with maximal infrared<br>
reflection off of a closed eyelid, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br><br>
In addition, the processing box 130 also may include a power source 160 for<br>
providing power to the emitter 32, the sensor 33, the CPU 144, and/or other components in<br>
the processing box 130. The processor box 130 may be powered by a conventional DC<br>
battery, e.g., a nine volt battery or a rechargeable lithium, cadmium, or hydrogen-generated<br>
battery, and/or by solar cells attached to or built within the system 14. Alternatively, an<br>
adapter (not shown) may be connected to the processor box 130, such as a conventional<br>
AC adapter or a twelve volt automobile lighter adapter.<br>
The CPU 140 may include timer circuitry 146 for comparing the length of<br>
individual elements of the output signal 142 to a predetermined threshold to distinguish<br>
between normal blinks and other eyelid movement. The timer circuitry 146 may be<br>
separate discrete components or may be provided internally within the CPU 140, as will be<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art. The CPU 140 may convert the output signal 142<br>
into a stream of data 144, which may be used to communicate to other persons or<br>
equipment. For example, the stream of data 144 produced by the CPU 140 may be a<br>
binary signal, such as Morse code or ASCI code. Alternatively, the CPU .140 may be<br>
capable of producing other outputs, e.g., synthesized voice signals, control signals for<br>
equipment, or pictorial representations.<br>
To facilitate communication, the processing box 130 may include a variety of<br>
output devices for using the stream of data 144. For example, an internal speaker 150 may<br>
be provided, that may produce an alarm sound or a synthesized voice. An output port 148<br>
may be provided to which a variety of equipment, such as the video display 50 shown in<br>
FIG. 1, may be directly coupled by hard-wire connections.<br>
In addition or alternatively, the processing box 130 may include a transmitter 152<br>
coupled to the CPU 144 for wireless communication of the stream of data 144 to a remote<br>
location. For example, as shown in FIG. 9, the system 14 may include a receiving and<br>
processing unit 154, such as a computer or other control or display system. The<br>
transmitter 152 may be a radio frequency ("RF") transmitter capable of producing a short<br>
range signal, for example, reaching as far as about one hundred feet or more, or<br>
alternatively about forty five feet to fifty feet, even through walls or obstacles.<br>
Alternatively, other transmitters, e.g., an infrared transmitter, may be provided.<br>
The transmitter 152 may also be coupled to an amplifier (not shown) to allow the<br>
stream of data to be transmitted hundreds or thousands of feet or more, e.g., using<br><br>
Bluetooth or other RF protocols. For example, the amplifier and transmitter 152 may<br>
communicate via telephone communication lines, satellites and the like, to transmit the<br>
stream of data to a remote location miles away from the system, where the data can be<br>
monitored, analyzed in real time, or stored (e.g., as in a truck or aircraft "black box"<br>
recorder) for future or retrospective analysis. The system may include, or may be coupled<br>
to a global positioning system (GPS) for monitoring the location, movement, and/or state<br>
of cognitive alertness, wakefulness, sleepiness, or emotional/behavioral performance<br>
and/or safety of an individual wearing the detection device 30.<br>
The receiving and processing unit 154 may include a receiver 156, e.g., a radio<br>
frequency receiver, for receiving signals 153, including the stream of data, transmitted by<br>
the transmitter 152. A processor 158 is coupled to the receiver 156 for translating, storing,<br>
and/or using the information in the stream of data, the processor 158 being coupled to<br>
memory circuitry 160, a communication device 162, and/or a control system 164. For<br>
example, the receiving and processing unit 154 may include the memory circuitry 160<br>
therein into which the processor 158 may simply store the stream of data for subsequent<br>
retrieval and analysis.<br>
The processor 158 may interpret the stream of data, for example, by converting a<br>
binary code in the stream of data into an understandable message, i.e., a series of letters,<br>
words and/or commands, and/or may use augmentative communication devices or<br>
software (such as KE:NX or Words Plus) to facilitate communication. The resulting<br>
message may be displayed on the communication device 162, which may include a video<br>
display for displaying text, pictures and/or symbols, a synthesized voice module for<br>
providing electronic speech, and the like.<br>
Alternatively, the stream of data may be displayed graphically on a computer video<br>
screen or other electronic display device as a "real time" message signal or numerically<br>
(e.g., displaying blink rate, blink duration, PERCLOS, etc.), or displayed graphically<br>
similar to an EKG or EEG tracing. In addition, as shown in FIG. 12C, the stream of data<br>
may be displayed along with other physiological data, such as skin conductance, body<br>
temperature, cardiovascular data (e.g. heart rate, blood pressure), respiratory data (e.g.<br>
respiration rate, blood oxygen and carbon dioxide levels), electromyographic (EMG)<br>
and/or actigraphic data (i.e. body movement, position), and/or other sleep<br>
polysomnographic (PSG) or electroencephalographic (EEG) variables. Alternatively, the<br><br>
stream of data may be integrated with controllers that monitor automobile or mechanical<br>
functions (e.g. vehicle speed, acceleration, braking functions, torque, sway or tilt, engine<br>
or motor speed, etc.) to make intelligent decisions regarding slowing down or speeding up<br>
the vehicle depending upon road and/or vehicle conditions, as well as functions relating to<br>
the state of consciousness, wakefulness, attentiveness, and/or real time performance<br>
vigilance responses of the driver or machine operator.<br>
In addition, the message may be interpreted by the processor 158 for directing the<br>
control system 164 to control one or more pieces of machinery or equipment. For<br>
example, the stream of data may include a command to direct the control system 164 to<br>
control relay switches or other devices to turn off and on an electrical device, such as an<br>
appliance, electrical wheelchair, engine, light, alarm, telephone, television, computer, a<br>
tactile vibrating seat, and the like, or to operate an eye-activated computer mouse or other<br>
controller.<br>
Alternatively, the processor 158 may use the stream of data to control PC, IBM,<br>
Macintosh, and other computers, and/or compatible computer software and/or hardware,<br>
e.g., to interact with a computer similar to a mouse, a "return" key, and/or a joystick."<br>
For example, the stream of data may include commands to activate a series of menus from<br>
which submenus or individual items may be selected, as are used in commercially<br>
available general use software and computer games, as well as special communications<br>
software, such as WORDS-PLUS or Ke:NX. The processor 158 may then control, scroll,<br>
or select items from computer software programs, operate a printer, or other peripheral<br>
device (e.g., selecting a font, paragraph, tab or other symbol operator, selecting commands,<br>
such as "edit," "find," "format," "insert," "help," or controlling CD-ROM or disc drive<br>
operations, and/or other Windows and non-Windows functions).<br>
Alternatively, the receiver 156 may be coupled directly to a variety of devices (not<br>
shown), such as radio or television controls, lamps, fans, heaters, motors, vibro-tactile<br>
seatsj remote control vehicles, vehicle monitoring or controlling devices, computers,<br>
printers, telephones, lifeline units,: electronic toys, or augmentative communication<br>
systems, to provide a direct interface between the user and the devices.<br>
During use, the detection device 30 may be placed on a user's head, i.e., by putting<br>
the eyeglasses 20 on as shown in FIG. 1. The adjustable arm 31 and/or the clamp 27 may<br>
be adjusted to optimally orient the emitter 32 and sensor 33 towards the user's eye 300<br><br>
(shown in FIGS. 6A-6C and 7A-7C). The emitter 32 may be activated and a beam of light<br>
340 directed from the emitter 32 towards the eye 300. The intensity and/or frequency of<br>
the emitter 32 and/or the threshold sensitivity of the sensor 33 or other focus may then be<br>
adjusted (e.g. manually or automatically using self-adjusting features).<br>
Because of the difference in the reflective characteristics of the surface of the eye<br>
300 itself and the eyelid 302, the intensity of the light reflected off of the eye 300 depends<br>
upon whether the eye 300 is open or closed. For example, FIGS. 6A and 6B illustrate an.<br>
open eye condition, in which a ray of light 340 produced by the emitter 32 strikes the<br>
surface of the eye 300 itself and consequently is scattered, as shown by the rays 350. Thus,<br>
the resulting light intensity detected by the sensor 33 is relatively low, i.e., the sensor 33<br>
may not receive any substantial return signal.<br>
In FIGS. 7A and 7B, the eye 300 is shown with the eyelid 302 closed as may occur<br>
during normal blinks, moments of drowsiness, intentional blinks, or other eyelid<br>
movement. Because the light 340 strikes the eyelid 302, it is substantially reflected back<br>
to the sensor 33, as shown by the ray 360, resulting in a relatively high light intensity being<br>
detected by the sensor 33. Alternatively, as shown in 7C, the beam of light 340 may be<br>
broken or cut by the eyelid 302 when the eye 300 is closed.<br>
The sensor 33 consequently produces a light intensity signal that indicates when<br>
the eye 300 is open or closed, i.e., corresponding to the time during which reflected light is<br>
not detected or detected, respectively, by the sensor 33. Generally, the intensity of the<br>
infrared light reflected from the surface of the eyelid is not substantially affected by skin<br>
pigmentation. If it is desired to adjust the intensity of light reflected from the eyelid, foil,<br>
glitter, reflective moisturizer creams and the like may be applied to increase reflectivity, or<br>
black eye liner, absorptive or deflective creams and the like may be applied to reduce<br>
reflectivity.<br>
Returning to FIG. 9, the light intensity detected by the sensor 33 results in an<br>
output signal 142 including a series of time-dependent light intensity signals (as shown, for<br>
example, in FIG. 12B). The output signal 142 is received by the CPU 140 coupled to the<br>
sensor 33, which compares the length of time of each light intensity signal 142, for<br>
example, corresponding to a closed eye condition, with a predetermined threshold. The<br>
timer circuitry 146 may provide a threshold time to the CPU 140 for distinguishing normal<br>
blinks from intentional and/or other unintentional eyelid movement, which the CPU 140<br><br>
may then filter out of the output signal 142. The CPU 140 then produces a stream of data<br>
144 that may be used for voluntary and/or involuntary communication.<br>
In one useful application, the detection device 30 may be used to detect impending<br>
drowsiness or "micro-sleeps" (i.e., sleep intrusions into wakefulness lasting a few seconds)<br>
of a user, with the processing box 130 triggering a warning to alert the user, others in his<br>
or her presence, or monitoring equipment of the onset of drowsiness. The threshold of the<br>
timer circuitry 146 may be adjusted such that the CPU 140 detects relatively long periods<br>
of eye closure, as may occur when a person is falling asleep.<br>
For example, because normal blinks are relatively short, the threshold may be set at<br>
a time ranging from close to zero seconds up to several seconds, e.g., between about two<br>
and three hundred milliseconds (200-300 ms), or, in another embodiment, about two<br>
hundred fifty milliseconds (250 ms), e.g., to distinguish normal blinks from drowsiness-<br>
induced eyelid movement. When the CPU 140 detects a drowsiness condition, i.e., detects-<br>
a high light intensity signal exceeding the predetermined threshold time, it may activate a<br>
warning device. The warning device may be included within the processing box 130, such<br>
as the speaker 150, or alternatively on the frame, for example, by mounting a warning light<br>
(not shown) or an alarm speaker (not shown in FIG. 9, see FIG. 10C) on the frame. In<br>
another alternative, the warning device may be a tactile device, e.g., a vibrating seat, and<br>
the like, as described elsewhere herein.<br>
Alternatively, the detection device 30 may be used to unobtrusively record or<br>
monitor drowsiness-induced eyelid movement, with the CPU 140 producing a stream of<br>
data 144 that the transmitter 152 may transmit to the receiving and processing unit 154<br>
(FIG. 9). For example, the device 30 may be used in conjunction with a vehicle safety<br>
system to monitor a driver's level of awareness or attentiveness. The stream of data 144<br>
may be transmitted to a receiving and processing unit 154 mounted in a vehicle, which<br>
may store data on the driver's drowsiness and/or may use the data to make decisions by<br>
predetermined algorithmic responses to control the vehicle, e.g., adjust the vehicle's speed<br>
or even turn the vehicle's engine off. Thus, the detection device 30 may be used to<br>
monitor truck drivers, taxi drivers, ship or airline pilots, train conductors or engineers,<br>
radar or airport control tower operators, operators of heavy equipment or factory<br>
machinery, scuba divers, students, astronauts, entertainment participants or observers, and<br>
the like.<br><br>
The detection device 30 and system 14 may also be used in a medical diagnostic,<br>
therapeutic, research, or professional setting to monitor the wakefulness, sleep patterns,<br>
and/or sympathetic and parasympathetic effects of stressful conditions or alerting drugs<br>
(e.g. caffeine, nicotine, dextro-amphetarnine, methylphenidate, modafanil), sedating drugs<br>
(e.g. benzodiazapines, Ambien), or cireadian rhythmaltering effects of light and darkness<br>
or melatonin, which may affect blink rate, blink velocity, blink duration, or PERCLOS of a<br>
patient or vehicle operator. The signals may be stored and analyzed in real time for trend<br>
changes measured over time to predict drowsiness effects of individuals using device.<br>
Similar to the method just described, the CPU 140 may produce a stream of data<br>
144, which the transmitter may send to a remote receiving and processing unit 154. The<br>
receiving and processing unit 154 may store the stream of data 144 in the memory circuitry<br>
160 for later retrieval and analysis by researchers, medical professionals, or safety<br>
personnel (e.g., similar to the way in which flight recorder data may be stored in an<br>
aircraft's "black box" recorder). The receiving and processing unit 154 may also display<br>
the stream of data 144, for example at a nurse's station, as an additional parameter to<br>
continually monitor a patient's physical, mental, or emotional condition. The unit 154<br>
may store and/or produce a signal, e.g., by a series of algorithms, that must be responded<br>
to within a predetermined time (e.g., performance vigilance monitoring) to prevent false<br>
positives and negatives.<br>
A number of medical conditions may be monitored by the detection device 30 and<br>
system 14, such as petit mal epilepsy, in which the eyes flutter at a rate of about three<br>
cycles per second, grand mal or psychometer seizures, where the eyes may stare or close<br>
repetitively in a jerky manner, myoclonic seizures, in which the lids may open and close in<br>
a jerky manner, or tics, or other eye movements, such as encountered by people with<br>
Tourette's syndrome. The system may be used to monitor g-LOC (loss of consciousness)<br>
of pilots caused by positive or negative g-force effects, hypoxemia of passengers or crew<br>
in aircraft due to losses in cabin pressure, nitrogen narcosis or "the bends" in divers, or the<br>
effects of gases, chemicals, drugs, and/or biological agents on military personnel or other<br>
individuals.'<br>
The system may also be used to monitor psychological situations, for example, to<br>
detect stress or when a person lies (e.g., by closing or otherwise moving their eyes when<br>
lying), during hypnosis, to monitor attentiveness, to measure one or more of: the<br><br>
"negative" side effects and/or "positive" therapeutic effects of drugs or pharmaceuticals on<br>
conditions where ocular functions are compromised (e.g. L-dopa in improving blink rates<br>
in Parkinson's disease; drugs usedto treat ocular tics or neuromuscular disorders such as<br>
ALS or myasthenia gravis); drag or alcohol levels based on correlative ocular measures<br>
(e.g. nystagmus or delayed pupil responses to light flashes); the therapeutic and side<br>
effects of anti-convulsants, drugs, alcohol, toxins, or the effects of hypoxia or ventilation,<br>
and the like. Neurological conditions in patients of all ages may also be monitored where<br>
the innervation or mechanical function of the eye or eyelid may be affected, such as in<br>
Parkinson's disease, muscle diseases, e.g., myotonia, myotonic muscular dystrophy,<br>
blepharospasm, photophobia or light sensitivity, encephalopathy, seizures, Bell's palsy, or<br>
where the condition may produce loss of vision (e.g. macular degeneration), eyelid<br>
drooping or ptosis, such as third cranial nerve palsy or paresis, brainstem lesions or stroke,<br>
tumors, infection, metabolic diseases, trauma, degenerative conditions, e.g., multiple<br>
sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, polyneuropathy, myesthenia gravis, botulism,<br>
tetanus, tetany, tardive dyskinesia, brainstem encephalitis, and other primary eyelid<br>
conditions, such as exophthalmos, thyrotoxicosis or other thyroid-conditions.' In a similar<br>
manner, the detection device 30 may be used in an ambulatory fashion to study the<br>
progression and/or regression of any of the above neuro-ophthalmological and<br>
opthalmological disturbances.<br>
Similarly, the detector device 30 may be used in biofeedback applications, for<br>
example, in biofeedback, hypnosis or psychological therapies of certain conditions (e.g. tic<br>
disorders). The detector device 30 may produce a stimulus, e.g. activating a light or<br>
speaker, and monitor the user's eyelid movement in anticipation of receiving a response,<br>
e.g., a specific sequence of blinks, acknowledging the stimulus within a predetermined<br>
time. If the user fails to respond, the processor may store the response, e.g. including response time, and/or may automatically transmit a signal, such as an alarm signal.<br>
In addition, the detection device 30 may be used to monitor individuals in non-<br>
medical settings, such as during normal activity in a user's home or elsewhere. For<br>
example, individuals with involuntary medical conditions, such as epilepsy, or narcolepsy,<br>
may be monitored, or other individuals, such as, infants and children, prison inmates,.<br>
demented patients (e.g., with Alzheimer's disease), law enforcement personnel, military<br>
personnel, bank tellers, cashiers, casino workers, students, swing or graveyard shift<br><br>
workers, and the like, may be monitored. Similar applications may be applied in a sleep<br>
laboratory during polysomnographic procedures (e.g. PSG, MSLT or MWT) for<br>
monitoring sleep patients to measure parameters, such as onset of sleep, sleep latency, time<br>
of eyelid closing or opening, time of awakening during the night, etc., or to animal<br>
research where eye blinking, pupil changes, and/or- slow or rapid eye movement may be a<br>
factor to be studied, or to the ocular neuro-developmental functions of infants.<br>
The detection device 30 may be used to study or monitor the drowsiness,<br>
awakening, or alerting effects of prescribed pharmaceuticals (e.g. stimulants), alcohol or<br>
other illicit drugs, toxins, poisons, as well as other relaxing, sedating or alerting techniques<br>
or devices. Similarly, the performance and vigilance abilities of the user may be tested and<br>
analyzed as a direct function of, or in relationship to, PERCLOS.<br>
When the CPU 140 detects the presence of particular eyelid movement,; such as an<br>
extensive period of eye closure, which may occur, for example, during an epileptic seizure,<br>
a syncopal episode, a narcoleptic episode, or when dozing off while driving or working,<br>
the CPU 140 may produce an output signal which activates an alarm. Alternatively, the<br>
transmitter 152 may send an output signal to shut off equipment being used, to notify<br>
medical personnel, such as by automatically activating a telephone to dial emergency<br>
services, to signal remote sites, such as police stations, ambulances, vehicle control<br>
centers, guardians, and the like.<br>
The system 14 may also find useful application for voluntary communication. A user wearing the detection device 30 may intentionally blink in a predetermined pattern,<br>
for example, in Morse code or other blinked code, to communicate an understandable<br>
message to people or equipment (e.g., to announce an emergency). The CPU 140 may<br>
convert a light intensity signal 142 received from the sensor 33 and corresponding to the<br>
blinked code into a stream of data 144, or possibly directly into an understandable message<br>
including letters, words and/or commands.<br>
The Stream of data 144 may then be displayed on a video display 50 (see FIG. 1)<br>
coupled to the output port 148, or emitted as synthesized speech on the internal speaker<br>
150. The stream of data 144 may be transmitted by the transmitter 152 via the signal 153<br>
to the receiving and processing unit 154 for displaying messages, or for controlling<br>
equipment, such as household devices, connected to the control system 164. In addition to<br>
residential settings, the system 14 may be used by individuals in hospitalized or nursing<br><br>
care, for example by intubated, ventilated, restrained, paralyzed or weakened patients, to<br>
communicate to attending medical staff and/or to consciously signal a nurse's station.<br>
These include all patients who have no physical ability to communicate verbally, but who<br>
retain ability to communicate using eye blinking of one or both eyes (e.g., patients with<br>
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, transverse myelitis, locked-in syndrome, cerebravascular<br>
strokes, terminal muscular dystrophy and those intubated on ventilation).<br>
The device may be used in any environment or domain, e.g., through water or other<br>
substantially transparent fluids. Further, the device 30 may also be used as an emergency<br>
notification and/or discrete security tool. A person who may be capable of normal speech<br>
may wear the device 30 in the event of circumstances under which normal communication,<br>
i.e., speech, is not a viable option. For example, a bank or retail employee who is being<br>
robbed or is otherwise present during the commission of a crime may be able to discretely<br>
blink out a preprogrammed warning to notify security or to call law enforcement.<br>
Alternatively, a person with certain medical conditions may wear the device in the event<br>
that they are physically incapacitated, i.e., are unable to move to call for emergency<br>
medical care, but are still able to voluntarily move their eyes. In such cases, a pre-recorded<br>
message or identifying data (e.g. name of the user, their location, the nature of the<br>
emergency, etc.) may be transmitted to a remote location by a specific set of eyeblink<br>
codes or preprogrammed message. In this manner, the detection device 30 may be used to<br>
monitor patients in an ICU setting, patients on ventilators, prisoners, elderly or disabled<br>
persons, heavy equipment operators, truck drivers, motorists, ship and aircraft pilots, train<br>
engineers, radar or airport control tower operators, or as a nonverbal or subliminal tool for<br>
communication by military guards, police bank tellers, cashiers, taxi-drivers, and the like.<br>
The detection device 30 may also be used as a recreational device, for example, as a<br>
children's toy similar to a walkie-talkie or to operate a remote control toy vehicle.<br>
In addition, it may be desirable to have the CPU 140 perform an additional<br>
threshold comparison to ensure continued use of the detection device 30. For example,<br>
additional timer circuitry may be coupled to the CPU 140 such that the CPU 140 may<br>
compare the light intensity signals: received from the sensor 33 to a second predetermined<br>
threshold provided by the timer circuitry. The second predetermined threshold may<br>
correspond to a time period during which a person would normally blink. If the CPU 140<br>
fails to detect a normal blink within this time period or if the user fails to respond to a<br><br>
predetermined stimulus (e.g. a blinking light or sound), the CPU 140 may produce a<br>
signal, activating the speaker 150 or transmitting a warning using the transmitter 152.<br>
This may be useful, if, for example, the detection device 30 is removed by a<br>
perpetrator during commission of a crime, falls off because of the onset of a medical<br>
episode, as well as to prevent "false alarms," or to measure the "state of attentiveness" of<br>
the user. Alternatively, performance vigilance tasks may be required of the user to -<br>
determine whether the signal transmitted is a purposeful or "false alarm" signal, and also<br>
for measuring attention or drowsiness levels for purposes of biofeedback, and also to<br>
measure compliance of the user wearing the device.<br>
Alternatively, the polarity of the output signal 142 may be reversed such that a<br>
stream of data is produced only when the eye is opened, for example, when monitoring<br>
patients in a sleep lab to measure onset of sleep, sleep latency, time of eyelid closure, etc.,<br>
or to monitor sleeping prison inmates. For such uses, the CPU 140 may activate an alarm<br>
only when an open eye condition is detected, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the<br>
art.<br>
Turning to FIG. 8, another embodiment of the detection device 30 is shown. In this<br>
embodiment, the emitter and sensor are a single solid state light emission and detecting<br>
biosensor device 132, which are mounted directly onto the eyeglasses 20. The biosensor<br>
device 132, which may produce and detect infrared light, may be as small as two<br>
millimeters by four millimeters (2 mm x 4 mm) and weigh only a few grams, thereby<br>
enhancing the convenience, comfort and/or discretion of the detection device 30. Because<br>
of the small size, the biosensor device 133 may be mounted directly in the lens 21, as<br>
shown in FIG, 8, on an outside or inside surface of the lens 21, in the bridgework 24 or at<br>
another location on the frame 22 that may facilitate detection of eye movement. The<br>
biosensor device 132 may measure less than about five millimeters by five millimeters<br>
surface area, and may weigh as little as about one ounce, thereby providing a<br>
emitter/sensor combination that may be unobtrusive to vision, portable, and may be<br>
conveniently incorporated into a light weight eye frame. Because the entire system may be<br>
self-contained on the frame, it moves with the user no matter which direction he or she<br>
looks and may operate in a variety of environments or domains, day or night, underwater,<br>
etc.<br><br>
Hamamatsu manufactures a variety of infrared emitter and detector devices that<br>
may be used for the biosensor device 132, such as Model Nos. L1909, L1915-01, L2791-<br>
02, L2792-02, L2959, and 5482-11, or alternatively, a Radio Shack infrared emitter,<br>
Model No. 274-142, may be used. Multiple element arrays, e.g., linear optical scanning<br>
sensor arrays, appropriate for use may be available from Texas Advanced Optoelectronic<br>
Solutions, Inc. (TAOS) of Piano, TX, such as Model Nos. TSL 201 (64 pixels x 1 pixel),<br>
TSL 202 (128 x 1), TSL 208 (512 x 1), TSL 2301 (102 x 1). These sensors may be used in<br>
combination with lens arrays to facilitate focusing of the detected light, such as the Selfoc<br>
lens array for line scanning applications made by NSG America, Inc. of Irvine, CA.<br>
In addition, multiple biosensor devices 132 may be provided on the eyeglasses 20,<br>
for example, a pair of biosensor devices 132 may be provided, as shown in FIG. 8, for<br>
detecting eyelid movement of each eye of the user (not shown). A cable 134 may extend<br>
from each biosensor device 132 to a processing box 130, similar to the processing box 130<br>
described above. The CPU 140 of the processing box 130 (not shown in FIG. 8) may<br>
receive and compare the output signal from each biosensor device 132 to further augment<br>
distinguishing normal blinks from other eyelid movement.<br>
The pair of biosensor devices 132 may allow use of more sophisticated codes by<br>
the user, e.g., blinking each eye individually or together, for communicating more<br>
effectively or conveniently, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. In one form,<br>
a blink of one eye could correspond to a "dot," and the other eye to a "dash" to facilitate<br>
use of Morse code. The output signals from each eye could then be interpreted by the CPU<br>
140 and converted into an understandable message.<br>
In another form, a right eye blink (or series of blinks) may cause an electric<br>
wheelchair to move to the right, a left eye blink (or series of blinks) may move to the left,<br>
two simultaneous right and left eye blinks may cause the wheelchair to move forward,<br>
and/or four simultaneous right and left eye blinks may cause the wheelchair to move<br>
backward. Similar combinations or sequences of eye blinks may be used to control the<br>
on/off function, or volume or channel control of a television, AM/FM radio, VCR, tape<br>
recorder or other electronic or electromechanical device, any augmentative<br>
communications or controlling device, or any device operable by simple "on/off' switches<br>
(e.g., wireless television remote controls single switch television control units, universal<br>
remote controllers, single switch multi-appliance units with AC plug/wall outlet or wall<br><br>
switch modules, computer input adapters, lighted signaling buzzer or vibrating signal<br>
boxes, switch modules of all types, video game entertainment controller switch modules<br>
and switch-controlled electronic toys).<br>
In additional alternatives, one or more lenses or filters may be provided for<br>
controlling the light emitted and/or detected by the biosensor device, an individual emitter,<br>
and/or detector. For example, the angle of the light emitted may be changed with a prism<br>
or other lens, or the light may be columnated or focused through a slit to create a<br>
predetermined shaped beam of light directed at the eye or to receive the reflected light by<br>
the sensor. An array of lenses may be provided that are adjustable to control the shape,<br>
e.g. the width, etc., of the beam of light emitted or to adjust the sensitivity of the sensor.<br>
The lenses may be encased along with the emitter in plastic and the like, or provided as a<br>
separate attachment, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
Turning to FIG. 10 A, another embodiment of a system 414 is shown that includes a<br>
frame 422 including a biosensor device 432 with associated processor and transmitter<br>
circuitry 430 provided directly on the frame 422, for example, to enhance the convenience<br>
and discretion of the system 414. The frame 422 may include a bridge piece 424 onto<br>
which the biosensor device 432 may be fixedly, slidably, and/or adjustably mounted, and a<br>
pair of ear supports 423,425.<br>
One of the supports 423 may have a larger size compared to the other support 425,<br>
for example, to receive the processor and transmitter circuitry 430 embedded or otherwise<br>
mounted thereon. A processor 440, similar to the CPU 140 in the processing box 130<br>
previously described, may be provided on the frame 422, and a power source, such as a<br>
lithium battery 460, may be inserted or affixed to the support 423. A radio frequency or<br>
other transmitter 452 (e.g., using Bluetooth or other protocols) is provided on the support<br>
423, including an antenna 453, which may be embedded or otherwise fastened along the<br>
ear support 423, in the temple piece or elsewhere in the frame 422.<br>
The system 414 may also include manual controls (not shown) on the ear support<br>
423 or elsewhere on the frame 422, for example to turn the power off and on, or to adjust<br>
the intensity and/or threshold of the biosensor device 432. Thus, the system 414 may be<br>
substantially self-contained on the frame 422, which may or may not include lenses (not<br>
shown) similar to eyeglasses. External cables or wires may be eliminated, thereby<br><br>
providing a more convenient and comfortable system for communication and/or<br>
monitoring a user.<br>
In another alternative, shown in FIGS. 10B, 10C, and 10D, a linear array 530 of<br>
emitters 532 and sensors 533 may be provided, e.g., in a vertical arrangement mounted on<br>
a nose bridge 524 of an eye frame 522. A CPU 540,\battery 460, transmitter antenna 543,<br>
and warning indicator 550 may also be provided on the frame 522, e.g., in the temple piece<br>
525, similar to the previously described embodiments. An LED 542 or similar stimulus<br>
device may also be provided at a predetermined location on the eye frame 522 to allow<br>
routine biofeedback responses from the user. In addition, a receiver 544 may be provided<br>
for receiving the stream of data created by the CPU 540 and transmitted by the transmitter<br>
543.<br>
As shown particularly in FIG. 10C, each of the sensors 533 and the emitter 532<br>
may be coupled to the CPU 540 or other control circuitry for controlling the emitter 532<br>
and/or for processing the light intensity signals produced by the sensors 532. Thus, the<br>
CPU 540 may cycle through the sensors 533 in the array 530 and sequentially process the<br>
signal from each of the sensors 533, similar to the processors described elsewhere herein.<br>
As shown in FIG. 10D, the emitter 532 includes a lens 534 to focus a beam of light<br>
(indicated by individual rays 360a, 360b) onto the eye 300, e.g., towards the pupil 301.<br>
The sensors 533 are embedded within, the nose bridge 524 and a slit 535 is provided for<br>
each, the slits 535 having a predetermined size to control the reflected light detected by<br>
each sensor 533. Thus, each sensor 535 may detect movement of the eyelid 302 past a<br>
particular portion of the eye 300, e.g., to measure PERCLOS, as shown in FIG. 12A. The<br>
sensors or emitters may have lenses or columnating devices to focus emitted or reflected<br>
light.<br>
The linear array 530 may facilitate measurement of additional parameters related to<br>
eyelid movement in addition to mere eye closure, for example, to measure the velocity of<br>
the eyelid opening or closing, i.e., the rate of eye closure, the CPU 540 may compare the<br>
time delay between the activation of successive sensors 533. In addition, the output<br>
signals from the sensors 553 may be processed to measure the percentage of pupil<br>
coverage of the eyelid 302, for example, due to partial eye closure, as a function of time,<br>
e.g., to monitor when the eye is partially, but not completely, closed, and/or to monitor the<br><br>
percentage of time that the eye is closed (PERCLOS), as shown in FIGS. 12A-12C, e.g.,<br>
compared to the user's baseline of maximal eye opening.<br>
Turning to FIG. 12D, in another embodiment, a two-dimensional array of sensors<br>
may be provided. Although a 5x5 array 633 and a 9x11 array 733 are shown as exemplary<br>
embodiments,; other arrays including any number of elements in the array may be provided.<br>
For example, as described further below, the sensors may be in the form of a CMOS or<br>
CCD device, including hundreds or thousands of pixels in a grid or other pattern. The<br>
sensors 633,733 may then be used to measure surface area reflectivity of light from the<br>
emitter 632, i.e., the processor (not shown) may process the signals from each sensor in the<br>
array 633,733 to create a stream of data indicating the percentage of surface area of the<br>
eye 300 covered by the eyelid 302 and/or relative position of the pupil.<br>
The sensors in the array 633,733 may be sufficiently sensitive or have sufficient<br>
resolution such that they may detect "red reflex" or the equivalent infrared "bright pupil"<br>
reflection due to the reflection of light off of the retina through the pupil 301. Thus, the<br>
sensors may produce a light intensity signal that includes a substantially zero value,<br>
indicating no red reflex or bright pupil, a low output, indicating red reflex or white pupil<br>
reflex, and a high output, indicating reflection off of a closed eyelid 302. The red reflex<br>
may appear as a bright white light pupil (resulting from infrared light from the emitter(s)<br>
reflecting off of the retina when the eyelid is open, or as a dark or "black pupil" if the<br>
processor uses subtraction algorithms). The processor may process the light intensity<br>
signals to detect when the pupil 301 is covered by the eyelid 302, i.e., at which point the<br>
user cannot see, even though their eye 300 may not be entirely covered by the eyelid 302,<br>
generally at a PERCLOS value of about 50-75 percent in primary gaze. Alternatively, as<br>
the eyelid, eye, and pupil descend, the sensor(s) may detect a red reflex or bright pupil<br>
even though the PERCLOS measurement may be as great as 75-80 percent or more, e.g.,<br>
where the eye may still see through a narrow slit-like palpebral fissure opening in<br>
downward gaze.<br>
In another alternative, the processor and/or transmitter circuitry (such as the CPU<br>
140 in the processor box 130 of FIG. 2, or the CPU's 440, 540 of FIGS. 10A and 10B)<br>
may include identification circuitry (not shown), either as a discrete memory chip or other<br>
circuit element, or within the CPU itself. The identification circuitry may be<br>
preprogrammed with a fixed identification code, or may be programmable, for example, to<br><br>
include selected identification information, such as the identity of the user, the user's<br>
location, biometric measures specific to the user (e.g. unique iris or retinal patterns, finger<br>
prints, voice identification), an identification code for the individual detection device, and<br>
the like.<br>
The GPU may selectively add the identification information to the transmitted<br>
stream of data 553, or the identification information may be automatically or periodically,<br>
continuously or continuously, included in the stream of data 553, thereby allowing the<br>
stream of data 553 to be associated with a particular detection device, individual user,<br>
and/or a specific location. The identification information may be used by the processor,<br>
for example, at a remote location, to distinguish between streams of data received from a<br>
number of detection devices, which may then be stored, displayed, etc. as previously<br>
described. Thus, the detection device may not require users to consciously communicate<br>
certain identification or other standard information when the system is used.<br>
As shown in FIG. 11A, the receiver 544 may allow the user to control one or more<br>
devices coupled to the receiver 544 through a single switch multi-appliance control unit<br>
550. The control unit 550 includes its own transmitter adapted to transmit on/off or other<br>
control signals that may be received by individual control modules 552a-552f. The user 10<br>
may blink to create a transmitted stream of data 553 that includes commands to turn off<br>
and on, or otherwise control, selected appliances using the control unit 550 and control<br>
modules 552a-552f, such as, a radio 554, a television 556, a light 558a. a light 562<br>
controlled by a wall switch 560, a fan 566 plugged into a wall socket 564, and the like.<br>
Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 11B, the receiver 554 may be coupled to other<br>
systems, such as a computer 570 and printer 572, a vehicle integration system 574, a<br>
lifeline unit 576, a GPS or other satellite transmitter 578, and the like. The transmitted<br>
stream of data 553 may be processed alone or along with additional data, such as other<br>
vehicle sensor information 573, and/or human factors (e.g. EKG, EEG, EOG, pulse, blood<br>
pressure, respiratory rate, oximetry, actigraphy, head position, voice analysis, body<br>
temperature, skin conductance, self-assessment measures and performance vigilance<br>
responses, observation by others through a fixed non-wearable dash-board or visor-<br>
mounted camera system, etc.), to further enhance monitoring a user, such as a long-<br>
distance truck driver.<br><br>
Turning to FIG. 13, yet another embodiment of a system 810 for monitoring eye<br>
movement is shown. Generally, the system 810 includes a frame 812 that may include a<br>
bridge piece 814 and a pair of ear supports 816, one or more emitters 820, one or more<br>
sensors 822, and/or one or more cameras 830,840. The frame 812 may include a pair of<br>
lenses (not shown), such as prescription, shaded, or protective lenses, although they may<br>
be omitted. Alternatively, the system may be provided on other devices that may be worn<br>
on a user's head, such as a pilot's oxygen mask, protective eye gear, a patient's ventilator,<br>
a scuba or swimming mask, a helmet, a hat, a head band, a head visor, protective head<br>
gear, or within enclosed suits protecting the head and/or face, and the like (not shown).<br>
The components of the system may be provided at a variety of locations on the device that<br>
generally minimize interference with the user's vision and/or normal use of the device.<br>
As shown, an array of emitters 820 are provided on the frame 812, e.g., in a vertical<br>
array 820a and a horizontal array 820b. In addition or alternatively, the emitters 820 may<br>
be provided in other configurations, such as a circular array (not shown), and may or may<br>
not include light filters and/or diffusers (also not shown). In an exemplary embodiment,<br>
the emitters 820 are infrared emitters configured to emit pulses at a predetermined<br>
frequency, similar to other embodiments described elsewhere herein. The emitters 820<br>
may be arranged on the frame such that they project a reference frame 850 onto a region of<br>
the user's face including one of the user's eyes. As shown, the reference frame includes a<br>
pair of crossed bands 850a, 850b dividing the region into four quadrants. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, the intersection of the crossed bands may be disposed at a location<br>
corresponding substantially to the eye's pupil during primary gaze, i.e., when the user is<br>
looking generally straight forward. Alternatively, other reference frames may be provided,<br>
e.g., including vertical and horizontal components, angular and radial components, or other<br>
orthogonal components. Optionally, even one or two reference points that remain<br>
substantially stationary may provide sufficient reference frame for determining relative<br>
movement of the eye, as explained further below.<br>
An array of sensors 822 may also be provided on the frame 812 for detecting light<br>
from the emitters 820 that is reflected off of the user's eyelid. The sensors 822 may<br>
generate output signals having an intensity identifying whether the eyelid is closed or<br>
open, similar to other embodiments described elsewhere herein. The sensors 822 may be<br>
disposed adjacent to respective emitters 820 for detecting light reflected off of respective<br><br>
portions of the eyelid. Alternatively, sensors 822 may only be provided in a vertical array,<br>
e.g., along the bridge piece 814, for monitoring the amount of eyelid closure, similar to<br>
embodiments described elsewhere herein. In a further alternative, the emitters 820 and<br>
sensors 822 may be solid state biosensors (not shown) that provide both the emitting and<br>
sensing functions in a single device. Optionally, the emitters 820 and/or sensors 822 may<br>
be eliminated, e.g., if the cameras 830,840 provide sufficient information, as explained<br>
further below.<br>
Circuitry and/or software may be provided for measuring PERCLOS or other<br>
parameters using the signals generated by the array of sensors. For example, FIG. 17<br>
shows an exemplary schematic that may be used for processing signals from a five element<br>
array, e.g., to obtain PERCLOS measurements or other alertness parameters.<br>
Returning to FIG. 13, the system 810 also includes one or more cameras 830<br>
oriented generally towards one or both of the user's eyes. Each camera 830 may include a<br>
fiber optic bundle 832 including a first end mounted to or adjacent the bridge piece 814 (or<br>
elsewhere on the frame 812, e.g., at a location that minimizes interferences with the user's<br>
vision), and a second end 837 that is coupled to a detector 838, e.g., a CCD or CMOS<br>
sensor, which may convert images into digital video signals. An objective lens 834 may<br>
be provided on the first end of the fiber optic bundle 832, as shown in FIG. 14, e.g., to<br>
focus images onto the fiber optic bundle 832. Optionally, the fiber optic bundle 832 may<br>
include one or more illumination fibers that may terminate adjacent the lens 834 to provide<br>
emitters 836, also as shown in FIG. 14. The illumination fiber(s) may be coupled to a light<br>
source (not shown), e.g., similar to the embodiment shown in FIG. 22 and described<br>
further below. Although only one camera 830 is shown in FIG. 13 (e.g., for monitoring<br>
the user's left eye), it will be appreciated that another camera (not shown) may be provided<br>
in a symmetrical configuration for monitoring the other of the user's eyes (e.g., the right<br>
eye), including similar components, e.g., a fiber optic bundle, lens, emitter(s) and/or<br>
detector (although, optionally, the cameras may share a common detector, as explained<br>
further below). Optionally, it may be desirable to have multiple cameras (not shown)<br>
directed towards each eye, e.g., from different angles facing the eye(s). Optionally, these<br>
camera(s) may include fiberoptic extensions, prismatic lenses, and/or reflecting mirrors<br>
(e.g., reflecting infrared light), impenetrable or blocking mirrored surfaces on the side of<br>
the lenses facing the eyes, and the like. Such accessories may be provided for bending,<br><br>
turning, reflecting, or inverting the images of the eyes transmitted to the camera(s) in a<br>
desired manner.<br>
The camera(s) 830 may be configured for detecting the frequency of light emitted<br>
by the emitters 820 and/or 836, e.g., infrared light or other light beyond the visible range.<br>
Optionally, if the fiber optic bundle(s) 832 include one or more illumination fibers for<br>
emitters 836, the emitters' 820 on the frame 812 may be eliminated. In this embodiment, it<br>
may also be possible to eliminate the sensors 822, and use the camera(s) 830 to monitor<br>
movement of the user's eye(s), e.g., as explained further below. Optionally, the system<br>
810 may include a second camera 840 oriented away from the user's head, e.g., to monitor<br>
the user's surroundings, such an area directly in front of the user's face. The camera 840<br>
may include similar components to the camera 830, e.g., a fiberoptic bundle 841, lens (not<br>
shown), and/or emitters) (also not shown). Optionally, the camera 830 may sufficiently<br>
sensitive to generate images under ambient lighting conditions, and the emitters may be<br>
omitted. The camera 840 may be coupled to a separate detector 839, as shown in FIG. 13,<br>
or may share the detector 838 withthe camera(s) 830, as explained further below.<br>
Each of the fiberoptic bundles 832, 841 may include, for example, between about<br>
five thousand and one hundred thousand (5,000-100,000) pixelated light-carrying optical<br>
fibers, or between about ten thousand and fifty thousand (10,000-50,000) fibers. The<br>
number of fibers may depend on the particular needs of a given application, e.g., to<br>
provide a desired optical resolution in the images obtained of the user's eye(s) (i.e., for.the<br>
"endocamera(s)" fibers), as well as of the surrounding environment (i.e., for the<br>
"exocamera" fibers). Optionally, the fibers for the bundles may include one or more<br>
illumination fibers. In exemplary embodiments, bundles may be used having five<br>
thousand (5,000) fibers (providing 15 x 75 pixel resolution), ten thousand (10,000) fibers<br>
(providing 100 x 100 pixel resolution), fifty thousand (50,000) fibers (providing 224 x 224<br>
pixel resolution), and one hundred thousand (100,000) fibers (providing 316 x 316 pixel<br>
resolution). The resulting fiber optic bundle(s) 832, 841 may have a diameter, for<br>
example, between about three to five millimeters (3-5 mm), with or without cladding. The<br>
fiber optic bundle(s) 832, 841 may be secured along the frame 812 or may be provided<br>
within the frame 812. For example, the frame 812 may be formed with one or more<br>
passages, e.g., extending from the bridge piece 814 to the ear supports 816, for receiving<br>
the fiber optic bundle(s) 832, 841 therethrough. Alternatively, the fiber optic bundle(s)<br><br>
832, 841 may be molded, fused, or otherwise embedded into the frame 812, e.g., when the<br>
frame 812 is made. Optionally, the fiber optic bundle(s) 832, 841 may extend from the<br>
frame 812 to a detector and/or processor (not shown) separate from the frame 812, similar<br>
to me embodiments described below with reference to FIGS. 18A and 18B.<br>
One or both of the ear supports 816 may include a panel 818 for mounting one or<br>
more components, e.g., a controller or processor, such as exemplary processor 842, a<br>
transmitter 844, an antenna 845, detector(s) 838, 839, and/or a battery 846. The processor<br>
840 may be coupled to the emitters 820, the sensors 822, and/or the cameras 830,840<br>
(e.g., to the'detector(s) 838,839) for controlling their operation. The transmitter 844 may<br>
be coupled to the processor 842 and/or detector(s) 838, 839 for receiving the output signals<br>
from the sensors 822 and/or cameras 830, 840, e.g., to transmit the signals to a remote<br>
location, as described below. Alternatively, the transmitter 844 may be coupled directly to<br>
output leads from the sensors 822 and/or the cameras 830, 840. The frame 812 may also<br>
include manual controls (not shown), e.g., on the ear support 816, for example, to turn the<br>
power off and on, or to adjust the intensity and/or threshold of the emitters 820, the<br>
sensors 822, and/or the cameras 830, 840.<br>
If desired, the system 810 may also include one or more additional sensors on the frame 812, e.g., physiological sensors, for example, for the purposes of integration and<br>
cross-correlation of additional bio-or neuro-physiological data relating to the cognitive,<br>
emotional, and/or behavioral state of the user. The sensors may be coupled to the<br>
processor 842 and/or to the transmitter 844 so that the signals from the sensors may be<br>
monitored, recorded, and/or transmitted to a remote location. For example, one or more<br>
position sensors 852a, 852b may be provided, e.g., for determining the spatial orientation<br>
of the frame 812, and consequently the user's head. For example, actigraphic sensors may<br>
be provided to measure tilt or movement of the head, e.g., to monitor whether the user's<br>
head is drooping forward or tiltingto the side. Acoustic sensors, e.g., a microphone 854<br>
may be provided for detecting environmental noise or sounds produced by the user.<br>
In addition or alternatively, the frame 812 may include one or more sensors for<br>
measuring one or more physical characteristics of the user, e.g., for the purpose of<br>
physiological systems integration and/or cross correlation. For example, EEG electrodes<br>
856 may be provided on the ear support 816, above or below the nasion, on the mastoid,<br>
over the occipital area, and/or other region that may contact the user's skin (e.g., moist<br><br>
surface contact electrodes), or may not contact the user's skin (e.g., dry wireless<br>
electrodes) to measure and transmit brain activity (e.g., waking, drowsy, or other sleep-<br>
related brain activity), e.g., of different frequencies ranging from about one to five hundred<br>
Hertz (1-500 Hz) for visual or short or long term spatial and/or temporal trend analysis<br>
(e.g. Fast Fourier or spectral analysis). An EKG electrode (not shown) may be provided<br>
that is capable of measuring cardiac activity through a skin contact site. A pulse sensor<br>
(not shown) may be used to measure cardiovascular pulsations, or an oximetry sensor 858<br>
may be used to measure oxygen saturation levels. A thermistor or other sensor may<br>
measure respiratory air flow, e.g., through the user's nose. A thermistor, thermocouple, or<br>
other temperature sensor (not shown) may be provided for measuring the user's skin<br>
temperature. A sweat detector (not shown) may be provided for measuring moisture on<br>
the user's skin, and/or a microphone or other acoustic sensor (also not shown) may be<br>
attached to the frame 812 to detect vocal or breathing sounds of the user. One or more<br>
electrooculographic (EOG) electrodes may be provided that contact the user's skin at<br>
desired areas that measure fluctuations in electrical potentials during movement of the<br>
eyes.<br>
In addition, the system 810 may include one or more feedback devices on the frame<br>
812. These devices may provide feedback to the user, e.g., to alert and/or wake the user,<br>
when a predetermined condition is detected, e.g., a state of drowsiness or lack of<br>
consciousness. The feedback devices may be coupled to the processor 842, which may<br>
control their activation. For example, a mechanical vibrator device 860 may be provided<br>
at a location that may contact the user, e.g., on the ear support 816, that may provide tactile<br>
vibrating stimuli through skin contact. An electrode (not shown) may be provided that<br>
may produce relatively low power electrical stimuli. A visible white or colored light<br>
emitter, such as one or more LED's may be provided at desired locations, e.g., above the<br>
bridge piece 814. Alternatively, audio devices 862, such as a buzzer or other alarm, may<br>
be provided, similar to other embodiments described elsewhere herein. In a further<br>
alternative, aroma-emitters may be provided on the frame 810, e.g., on or adjacent to the<br>
bridge piece 814.<br>
In addition or alternatively, one or more feedback devices may be provided<br>
separate from the frame 812, but located in a manner capable of providing a feedback •<br>
response to the user. For example, audio, visual, tactile (e.g., vibrating seat), or olfactory<br><br>
emitters may be provided in the proximity of the user, such as any of the devices described<br>
elsewhere herein. In a further alternative, heat or cold generating devices may be provided<br>
that are capable of producing thermal stimuli to the user, e.g., a remotely controlled fan or<br>
air conditioning unit.<br>
The system 810 may also include components that are remote from the frame 812,<br>
similar to other embodiments described elsewhere herein. For example, the system 810<br>
may include a receiver, a processor, and/or a display (not shown) at a remote location from<br>
the frame 812, e.g., in the same room, at a nearby monitoring station, or at a more distant<br>
location. The receiver may receive signals transmitted by the transmitter 842, including<br>
output signals from the sensors 822, cameras 830, 840, or any of the other sensors<br>
provided on the frame 812.<br>
A processor may be coupled to the receiver for analyzing signals from the<br>
components on the frame 812, e.g., to prepare the signals for graphical display. For<br>
example, the processor may prepare the signals from the sensors 822 and/or cameras 830,<br>
840 for display on a monitor, thereby allowing the user to be monitored by others.<br>
Simultaneously, other parameters may be displayed, either on a single or separate<br>
display(s). For example, FIGS. 15A-15I show signals indicating the output of various<br>
sensors that may be on the frame 812, which may be displayed along a common time axis<br>
or otherwise correlated, e.g., to movement of the user's eye and/or level of drowsiness.<br>
The processor may superimpose or otherwise simultaneously display the video signals in<br>
conjunction with the other sensed parameters to allow a physician or other individual to<br>
monitor and personally correlate these parameters to the user's behavior.<br>
In a further alternative, the processor may automatically process the signals to<br>
monitor and/or study the user's behavior. For example, the processor may use the output<br>
signals to monitor various ocular parameters related to eye movement, such as eye blink<br>
duration (EBD), eye blink frequency, eye blink velocity, eye blink acceleration, interblink<br>
duration (IBD), PERCLOS, PEROP (percentage eyelid is open), pupil size fluctuations,<br>
eye gaze and eye ball movements, and the like, such as those described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,542,081, incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The video signals from the camera 830 may be processed to monitor various eye<br>
parameters, such as pupillary size, location, e.g., within the four quadrant defined by the<br>
crossed bands 850, eye tracking movement, eye gaze distance, and the like. For example,<br><br>
because the camera(s) 830 may be capable of detecting the light emitted, by the emitters<br>
822, the camera(s) 830 may detect a reference frame projected onto the region of the user's<br>
eye by the emitters. FIG. 16 shows an exemplary video output from a camera included in a<br>
system having twenty emitters disposed in a vertical arrangement. The camera may detect<br>
twenty discrete regions of light arranged as a vertical band. The camera may also detect a<br>
"glint" point, G, and/or a moving bright pupil, P. Thus, the movement of the pupil may be<br>
monitored in relation to the glint point, G, and/or in relation to the vertical band 1-20.<br>
Because the emitters 822 are fixed to the frame 812, the reference frame 850 may<br>
remain substantially stationary relative to the user. Thus, the processor may determine the<br>
location of the pupil in terms of orthogonal coordinates (e.g., x-y or angle-radius) relative<br>
to the reference frame 850. Alternatively, if the reference frame is eliminated, the location<br>
of the pupil may be determined relative to any stationary "glint" point on the user's eye or<br>
other predetermined reference point. For example, the camera 830 itself may project a<br>
point of light onto the eye that may be reflected and detected by the camera. This "glint"<br>
point may remain substantially stationary since the camera 830 is fixed to the frame 812,<br>
thereby providing the desired reference point from which subsequent relative movement of<br>
the eye may be determined.<br>
In addition, video signals from a remote camera separate from the frame 812 may<br>
image the user's face from a distance (e.g., on the dashboard of a car, a drive, flight, or<br>
other simulator, or in a sonar, radar, or other monitoring station), e.g., to monitor various<br>
facial measures, such as facial expression, yawning frequency, and the like, in addition, or<br>
alternative to, the projected light reference frame from the emitters. In addition or<br>
alternatively, the parameters from other sensors may be processed and correlated, such as<br>
head orientation, tilt, body movement, physiological parameters, and the like. In one<br>
embodiment, the processor may correlate two or more of these various parameters to<br>
generate a composite fatigue index ("COFI"). For example, when eye blinks or pupil<br>
coverage by the eyelid exceed a threshold duration, the processor may monitor the position<br>
sensors to detect head tilt and/or the physiological sensors for brain activity likely to<br>
indicate that the user is falling asleep or otherwise becoming incapable of driving or<br>
operating equipment. The processor may assign numerical values to these parameters<br>
using an empirical algorithm stored in memory and add or otherwise correlate the<br>
parameters to assign a numerical COFI to the user's current condition.<br><br>
When a predetermined COFI threshold is exceeded, the system 810 may activate an<br>
alarm or otherwise notify the user and/or another party at a remote location. Thus, the<br>
system 810 may provide a more effective way to monitor the user's fatigue, drowsiness,<br>
alertness, mental state, and the like. In a further alternative, the system 810 may be used to<br>
generate predetermined outputs, e.g., to activate or deactivate equipment, such as a vehicle<br>
being operated by the user when a predetermined condition, e.g., COFI value, is<br>
determined by the system 810.<br>
Alternatively, the processor may be provided on the frame 812, e.g. as part of<br>
processor 842, for monitoring the parameters for a predetermined event to occur, such as<br>
exceeding a predetermined COFI threshold. In a further alternative, the eye tracking<br>
parameters described above may be monitored by a remote camera, e.g., in a fixed position<br>
in front of the; user, such as the dashboard of a vehicle arid the like. The remote camera<br>
may be coupled to the processor, either directly or via its own transmitter, which may also'<br>
be integrated into the COFI determination and/or monitored by third parties along with<br>
algorithmically defined response measures. Additional information on the various<br>
apparatus, systems, and methods for using them are described in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
6,163,281, issued December 19, 2000, 6,246,344, issued June 12,2001, and 6,542,081,<br>
issued April 1, 2003, the entire disclosures of which are expressly incorporated by<br>
reference herein.<br>
Returning to FIG. 13, in an alternative embodiment, the cameras 832, 840 may be<br>
coupled to a single detector (not shown), similar to the configuration shown in FIG. 22.<br>
The fiber optic bundles 832,841 may be coupled to one or more lenses for delivering<br>
and/or focusing images from the cameras 830, 840 onto respective regions of the detector.<br>
The detector may be a CCD or CMOS chip having an active imaging area, e.g., between<br>
about five and ten millimeters (5-10 mm) in cross-section. In exemplary embodiments, the<br>
active imaging area of the detector may be square, rectangular, round, or elliptical, as long<br>
as there is sufficient area for receiving simultaneous images from both cameras 830 and<br>
camera 840. Exemplary outputs displaying simultaneous video images from the cameras<br>
830, 840 is shown in FIGS. 20A and 20B, and described further below. In this alternative,<br>
with sufficient resolution and processing, it may be possible to eliminate the emitters 820<br>
and/or sensors 822 from the system 810.<br><br>
Turning to FIGS. 18A and 18B, another embodiment of an apparatus 910 is shown<br>
for monitoring eyelid movement of an individual wearing the apparatus 910. As described<br>
elsewhere herein, the apparatus 910 may be used as a biosensor, a communicator, and/or a<br>
controller, and/or may be included in a system, e.g., for monitoring voluntary-purposeful<br>
and/or involuntary-nonpurposeful movement of one or both of the user's eyes.<br>
As shown, the apparatus 910 includes a helmet 912 that may be worn on a user's<br>
head, and a biosensor assembly 920. The helmet 912 may be a standard aviator's helmet,<br>
such as those used by helicopter or jet aircraft pilots, e.g., including a pair of night vision<br>
tubes or other goggles 914 mounted thereon. Optionally, the helmet 912 may include one<br>
or more heads-up displays, e.g., small flat-panel LCDs mounted in front of or adjacent one<br>
or both eyes. Alternatively, the helmet 912 may be replaced with a frame (not shown, see,<br>
e.g., FIG. 13) including a bridge piece, a rim extending above or around each eye, and/or a<br>
pair of ear supports, similar to other embodiments described herein. The frame may<br>
include a pair of lenses (also not shown), such as prescription, shaded, and/or protective<br>
lenses, although they are not necessary for operation of the apparatus. Alternatively, one<br>
or both lenses may be replaced with displays, e.g., relatively small fiat panel LGDs, which<br>
may be used as a simulator and/or recreational device, as explained further below. In<br>
further alternatives, the apparatus 910 may include other devices that may be worn on a<br>
user's head, such as a hat, cap, head band, head visor, protective eye and head gear, face<br>
mask, oxygen mask, ventilator mask, scuba or swimming mask, and the like (not shown).<br>
The components of the apparatus 910 may be provided at a variety of locations on<br>
the helmet 912 (or other head-worn device), e.g., to generally minimize interference with<br>
the user's vision and/or normal activity while wearing the apparatus 910. As shown, the<br>
biosensor assembly 920 includes a camera 922 mounted on top of the helmet 912, e.g.,<br>
using Velcro, straps, and/or other temporary or removable connectors (not shown). This<br>
may allow the camera 922 to be removed when not in use. Alternatively, the camera 922<br>
may be substantially permanently connected to the helmet 912, incorporated directly into<br>
the helmet 912 (or other frame), connected to a head-mounted television, LCD monitor or<br>
other digital display, and the like, similar to other embodiments described herein.<br>
The biosensor assembly 920 also includes one or more fiber optic bundles 924 that<br>
extend from the camera 922 to the front of the helmet 912 to provide one or more<br>
"endocameras" for imaging the user's eye(s). As shown, a pair of fiber optic bundles 924<br><br>
are shown that extend from the camera 922 to respective tubes of the goggles 914. In the<br>
exemplary embodiment, the fiber optic bundles 924 may be sufficiently long to extend<br>
from the camera 922 to the goggles 914, e.g., between about twelve and eighteen inches<br>
long, although alternatively, the fiber optic bundles 924 may be longer, e.g., between about<br>
two and four feet long, or shorter, depending upon the location of the camera 922 on the<br>
helmet 910 (or if the camera 922 is provided separately from the helmet 910).<br>
Ends 926 of the fiber optic bundles 924 may be permanently or removably attached<br>
to the goggles 914, e.g., to brackets 916 connected to or otherwise extending from the<br>
goggles 914. Alternatively, the fiber optic bundles 924 may be held temporarily or<br>
substantially permanently onto the goggles 914 using clips, fasteners, adhesives, and the<br>
like (not shown). As shown, the ends 926 of the fiber optic bundles 924 are mounted<br>
below the goggles 914 and angled: upwardly towards the eyes of the user. The angle of the<br>
ends 926 may be adjustable, e.g., about fifteen degrees up or down from a base angle of<br>
about forty five degrees. Alternatively, the ends 926 of the fiber optic bundles 924 may be provided at other locations on the helmet 912 and/or goggles 914, yet be directed towards<br>
the eyes of the user.<br>
With additional reference to FIG. 19, each fiber optic bundle 924 may include a<br>
fiber optic image guide 928, i.e., a bundle of optical imaging fibers, and an illumination<br>
fiber bundle 930, e.g., encased in shrink tubing (not shown), extending between the camera<br>
922 and the ends 926 of the fiber optic bundle 924. Each illumination fiber bundle 930<br>
may include one or more optical fibers coupled to a light source, e.g., within the camera<br>
922. For example, the camera 922 may include a light emitting diode (LED) housing 932<br>
including one or more LEDs 934 (one shown for simplicity), and the illumination fiber<br>
bundle(s) 930 may be coupled to the LED housing 932 to deliver light to the end(s) 926.<br>
The light emitted by the light source 934 may be outside the range of normal<br>
human vision, for example, in the infrared range, e.g., with a nominal output wavelength<br>
between about eight hundred forty and eight hundred eighty nanometers (840-880 cm),<br>
such that the light emitted does not interfere substantially with the user's normal vision.<br>
The light source may generate light substantially continuously or light pulses at a desired<br>
frequency, similar to the embodiments described elsewhere herein. Alternatively, other<br>
sources of light for illummating the face and/or one or both eyes of the user may be<br>
provided instead of the illumination fiber bundle 930. For example, similar to the<br><br>
embodiments described elsewhere herein, one or more emitters (not shown) may be<br>
provided, e.g., an array of emitters disposed along one or more regions of the helmet 912<br>
and/or goggles 914.<br>
The end 926 of each fiber optic bundle 924 may include one or more lenses, e.g.,<br>
an objective lens 936 (shown in FIG. 18A) that may focus the image guide 928 in a desired<br>
manner, e.g., towards an eye of the user. Each image guide 928 may have forward line of<br>
sight (zero degrees (0°) field of view) and the objective lens 936 may provide a wider field of view, e.g., about forty five degrees (45°). Optionally, the line of sight may be<br>
adjustable, e.g., between about thirty and sixty degrees (30-60°) by adjusting theiobjective<br>
lens 936. Further, the objective lens 936 may optimize the viewing distance, e.g., to about<br>
two inches (2 in.), thereby improving focus on the user's eye(s). Thus, the image guide(s)<br>
928 may carry images of the user's eye(s) through the fiber optic bundle(s) 924 to the<br>
camera 922.<br>
As shown in FIG. 19, the camera 922 may include one or more lenses, e.g., a<br>
magnification section 938, for delivering and/or focusing images from the image guide(s)<br>
928 (and/or camera 944) onto the active area 942 of the imaging device 940. The imaging<br>
device 940 may be a variety of known devices that provide a two-dimensional active area<br>
for receiving images, e.g., a CMOS or CCD detector. In an exemplary embodiment, the<br>
imaging device 940 may be a CMOS device, such as that made by Sensovation, Model<br>
cmos SamBa HR-130, or Fast Camera 13 made by Micron Imaging, Model MI-MV13.<br>
The magnification section 938 may be mechanically mated to the camera 922 via a C-<br>
mount or other connection (not shown).<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, each image guide 928 may be capable of providing<br>
as many as ten to fifty thousand (10,000 to 50,000) pixels of image data, e.g., similar to the<br>
fiberoptic bundles described elsewhere herein, which may be projected onto the active area<br>
942 of the imaging device 940. For the apparatus 910 shown in FIGS. 18A and 18B, the<br>
images from both fiber optic bundles 924 are projected onto a single imaging device 940,<br>
as shown in FIG. 19, i.e., such that the images from each of the user's eyes occupy less<br>
than half of the active area 942.<br>
Optionally, the apparatus 910 may include an "exocamera" 944 oriented away from<br>
the user's head, e.g., to monitor the user's surroundings, similar to the embodiments<br>
described elsewhere herein. For example, as shown in FIG. 18A, another fiber optic<br><br>
bundle 945 may be provided that extends from the camera 922. As shown, the fiber optic<br>
bundle 945 is oriented "forward," i.e., generally in the same direction as when the user<br>
looks straight ahead, and terminates in a microlens 946. This fiber optic bundle 945 may<br>
be relatively short and/or substantially rigid such that its field of the view is substantially<br>
fixed relative to the helmet 912, Alternatively, the exocamera 944 may be provided at<br>
other locations on the helmet 912 and/or goggles 914, e.g., including a flexible fiberoptic<br>
bundle, similar to the exocamera 840 described above. Thus, the exocamera 944 may<br>
provide images away from the user, e.g., straight ahead of the user's face.<br>
The exocamera 944 may or may not include one or more illumination fibers, but<br>
may include an image guide that may be coupled to the imaging device 940, e.g.-, via the<br>
magnification section 938 or separately. Thus, the images from the exocamera 944 may be<br>
delivered onto the same active area 942 as the images of each, of the user's eyes received<br>
from the image guides 928, similar to other embodiments described herein. This<br>
configuration may allow or facilitate temporal and/or spatial synchronization, allowing for<br>
overlaying or superimposing endocamera image(s) over exocamera images, or through<br>
"triangulation measurements" or other algorithms for eye tracking purposes to identify<br>
"where," "what," and/or "how long" (duration of gaze) the user's eyes are looking at<br>
relative to the user's head directional position.<br>
Thus, the camera 922 may simultaneously capture images from one or more<br>
"endocameras," i.e., from fiber optic bundles 924 and from the exocamera 944. This may<br>
ensure that the images captured by each device are synchronized with one another, i.e.,<br>
linked together in time such that an image of one eye taken at a specific time correspond to<br>
an image of the other taken at substantially the same time. Further, these images may be<br>
substantially synchronized with data from other sensors, e.g., one or more physiological<br>
sensors, which may enhance the ability to monitor and/or diagnose the user, and/or predict<br>
the user's behavior. Because of this synchronization, image data may be captured at<br>
relatively high rates, e.g., between about five hundred and seven hundred fifty frames per<br>
second or Hertz (500-750 Hz). Alternatively, separate detectors may be provided, which<br>
capture image data that may be synchronized, e.g., by a processor receiving the data. In<br>
this alternative, slower capture rates may be used, e.g., between about thirty and sixty<br>
Hertz (30-60 Hz), to facilitate synchronization by a processor or other device subsequent<br>
to capture. Optionally, the camera 922 and/or associated processor may be capable of<br><br>
capturing relative slow oculometrics, e.g., at rates of between about fifteen and sixty (15-<br>
60) frames per second.<br>
FIGS. 20A and 20B illustrate exemplary outputs from a camera receiving<br>
simultaneous image signals from two endocameras 2010 and an exocamera 2020 (or from<br>
a device compiling images from separate cameras and/or detectors). As shown, an<br>
endocamera is; directed towards each of the user's eyes, and the exocamera is directed<br>
outwardly at the user's surroundings (i.e., generally straight in front of the user's face). In<br>
FIG. 20A, both of the user's eyes 2010L, 2010R are open and the exocamera image 2020<br>
shows a horizontal view of the room ahead of the user. In contrast, in FIG. 20B, one of the<br>
user's eyes 2010L is completely closed, and the other eye 2010R is partially closed such<br>
that the eyelid covers most of the pupil. The exocamera image 2020 shows that the user's<br>
head has begun to tilt to the left and droop forward. Optionally, additional information<br>
may be displayed and/or stored along with these images, such as real time data from other<br>
sensors on the apparatus 910, similar to that shown in FIGS. 12A-12C or FIGS. 15A-15I.<br>
Returning to FIGS. 18A, 18B, and 19, the images from the camera 922 (and/or<br>
camera 944) may be transferred from the apparatus 910 via cable 948 (best seen in FIG.<br>
18A). For example, the imaging device 940 may convert the optical images from the<br>
active area 942 into electrical signals that may be carried via the cable 948 to one or more<br>
processors and/or controllers (not shown), similar to other embodiments described'<br>
elsewhere herein. Alternatively, images from the fiberoptic bundles 924 and/or exocamera<br>
944 may be carried from the apparatus 910 to one or more remote devices, e.g., camera,<br>
detector, and/or processor (not shown), similar to other embodiments described herein. In<br>
this alternative, the bundles 924 may be between about two and six feet long, e.g.,<br>
providing sufficient length to allow the user to move normally yet remain coupled to the<br>
remote device(s).<br>
Alternatively or in addition, the apparatus 910 may include a wireless transmitter<br>
(not shown), such as a short or long range radio frequency (RF) transmitter, e.g., using<br>
Bluetooth or other protocols, that may be coupled to the camera 922. The transmitter may<br>
be located in the camera 922 or elsewhere on the helmet 912. The transmitter may<br>
transmit images signals representing the image data to a receiver at a remote location,<br>
similar to other embodiments described elsewhere herein. In yet another alternative, the<br>
apparatus 910 may include memory (also not shown) for storing the image data, either<br><br>
instead of or in addition to the transmitter and/or cable 948. For example, the data may be<br>
stored in a recorder device, e.g., similar to a "black box" recorder used in aircraft, such that<br>
the recorder may be retrieved at a later time, e.g., for analysis after a vehicular accident,<br>
medical incident, and the like.<br>
Optionally, the apparatus 910 may include one of more controllers (not shown),<br>
e.g., within the camera 922, and/or on or in the helmet 912 for controlling various<br>
components of the apparatus 910. For example, a controller may be coupled to the one or<br>
more LEDs 934 such that the LEDs 934 emit pulses at a predetermined frequency, e.g., to<br>
reduce energy consumption of the apparatus 910. In addition, the apparatus 910 may<br>
include one or more power sources, e.g., batteries and/or cables, for providing electrical<br>
power to one or more components of the apparatus 910. For example, one or more<br>
batteries (not shown) may be provided in the camera 922 for providing power to the<br>
imaging device 940 and/or the LED(s) 934.<br>
If desired, the apparatus 910 may also include one or more additional sensors (not<br>
shown), e.g., on the helmet 910. The sensors may be coupled to the biosensor assembly<br>
920, cable 948, and/or wireless transmitter (not shown) if included so that the signals from<br>
the sensors may be monitored, recorded, and/or transmitted to a remote location. For •<br>
example, one or more position sensors may be provided, e.g., for determining the spatial<br>
orientation of the helmet 912, and consequently the user's head, as described elsewhere<br>
herein. In addition or alternatively, the apparatus 910 may include one or more .<br>
physiological sensors (not shown), e.g., for measuring one or more physical characteristics<br>
of the user, such as one or more EEG electrodes, EKG electrodes, EOG electrodes, pulse<br>
sensors, oximetry sensors, thermistors, thermocouples, or other temperature sensors, e.g.,<br>
for measuring the user's skin temperature, sweat detectors for measuring moisture on the<br>
user's skin, and/or sensors for measuring respiratory air flow, e.g., through the user's nose.<br>
In addition, the apparatus 910 may include one or more feedback devices (also not<br>
shown), e.g., to alert and/or wake the user, such as a mechanical vibrator device that may<br>
provide tactile vibrating stimuli through skin contact, one or more electrodes that may<br>
produce relatively low power electrical stimuli, one or more light emitters, such as LEDs,<br>
audio devices, aroma-emitters, and the like. Alternatively, feedback devices may be<br>
provided separate from the apparatus 910, but located in amanner capable of providing a<br>
feedback response to the user. For example, audio, visual, tactile (e.g., a vibrating seat), or<br><br>
aroma-emitters may be provided in the proximity of the user, such as any of the devices<br>
described above. In a further alternative, heat or cold generating devices may be provided<br>
that are capable of producing thermal stimuli to the user, e.g., a remotely controlled fan or<br>
air conditioning unit.<br>
A system including the apparatus 910 may include components that are remote<br>
from the apparatus 910, similar to other embodiments described elsewhere herein. For<br>
example, the system may include one or more receivers, processors, and/or displays (not<br>
shown) at a remote location from the apparatus 910, e.g., in the same room, at a nearby<br>
monitoring station, or at a more distant location. The receiver may receive signals<br>
transmitted by a transmitter on the apparatus 910, including image signals from the camera<br>
922 and/or signals from other sensors on the apparatus 910.<br>
A processor may be coupled to the receiver for analyzing signals from the<br>
apparatus 910, e.g., to prepare the signals for graphical display. For example, the<br>
processor may prepare the video signals from the camera 922 for display on a monitor,<br>
similar to the images shown in FIGS. 20A and 20B, thereby allowing the user to be<br>
monitored by third parties, e.g., medical professionals, supervisors or other co-workers,<br>
and the like. Simultaneously, other parameters may be displayed, either on a single<br>
monitor or on separate displays, similar to other embodiments described elsewhere herein.<br>
The processor may superimpose or otherwise simultaneously display video signals of the<br>
user's eyes and/or exocamera images, alone or in conjunction with the other sensed<br>
parameters, to allow a physician or other individual to monitor and personally correlate<br>
these parameters to the user's behavior.<br>
In a further alternative, the processor may automatically process the signals to<br>
monitor or study the user's behavior. For example, the processor may use the output<br>
signals to monitor various parameters related to eye movement, such as eye blink duration<br>
(EBD), eye blink frequency, eye blink velocity, eye blink acceleration, interblink duration<br>
(IBD), PERCLOS, PEROP (percentage eyelid is open), and the like. The video signals<br>
from the camera 922 may be processed to continuously or discontinuously and/or<br>
sequentially monitor single or multiple eye parameters, in any combination or pattern of<br>
acquisition, such as pupillary size, relative location, eye tracking movement, eye gaze<br>
distance, and the like, as described elsewhere herein. Thus, the apparatus 910 and/or<br><br>
system may monitor one or more oculometrics or other parameters, such as those disclosed<br>
in U.S. Patent No. 6,542,081, incorporated by reference herein.<br>
To facilitate monitoring pupillary size (e.g., dilation, constriction, and/or<br>
eccentricity) and/or eye movement, the system may include a processor communicating<br>
with the camera 922 for processing the video signals and identifying a pupil of the eye<br>
from the video signals. For example, with higher resolution cameras, such as CMOS and<br>
CCD detectors, the processor may be able to identify the edges, and consequently the<br>
circumference, diameter, and/or cross-sectional area of the pupil. A display may be coupled to the processor for displaying video images of the eye from the video signals<br>
processed by the processor.<br>
In addition, turning to FIGS. 21A-21C, a processor may superimpose a graphic on<br>
the display, e.g., onto the video images to facilitate identifying and/or monitoring the pupil<br>
301 of an eye 300. As shown, because of the contrast between the edge of the pupil 301<br>
and the surrounding iris 304, the processor may approximate this border, and create a<br>
graphic halo, ellipse, or other graphic 306 that may be superimposed on the image data of<br>
one or both eyes (only one eye 300 shown in FIGS. 21A-21C for simplicity). An observer<br>
may use this graphic 306 to facilitate monitoring the user of the apparatus 910.<br>
In addition or alternatively, the processor may automatically analyze the<br>
information regarding the size and/or shape of the pupil 301 (or the graphic 306), thereby<br>
correlating the video signals to determine the person's level of drowsiness or other<br>
physical and/or mental condition. This analysis may include monitoring the relative<br>
location of the pupil, a size of the pupil, and/or an eccentricity of the pupil, e.g., over time.<br>
For example, the processor may monitor the diameter of the pupil 300 over time, which<br>
may displayed in chart form, e.g., as shown in FIG. 15E, stored in memory as a function of<br>
time, and/or superimposed on images of the eye, e.g., in real time.<br>
For example, FIG. 21A may show the pupil 301 in a relaxed state under ambient<br>
conditions, e.g., corresponding to graphic 306 having a diameter "d1." As shown in FIG.<br>
21B, if the user blinks or closes the eye 300, the pupil 301 may dilate, such that the pupil<br>
301 is initially dilated when the eye 300 is reopened, as represented by graphic 306 having<br>
a diameter "d2." The processor may compare changes in diameter of the graphic 306 or<br>
the pupil 301 itself to determine the delay for the pupil 301 to return to the diameter "d1"<br>
after a blink or other eye closure. This delay or loss of reactivity to visible or invisible<br><br>
light flashes may at least partially indicate a level of drowsiness, a level of impairment,<br>
e.g., intoxication, and/or me onset of a medical event, including lethal or terminal events<br>
such as brain damage or brain death due to hypoxemia, hypoglycemia, stroke, myocardial<br>
infarction, toxins, poisons, and the like.<br>
In addition or alternatively, the processor may determine the approximate<br>
eccentricity of the pupil, e.g., as it is partially covered by the eyelid 302. For example, as<br>
shown in FIG. 21C, when the eyelid 302 is partially closed, the halo 306 superimposed on<br>
the images may adopt an elliptical shape corresponding to a width "w" and height "h" of<br>
the exposed portion of the pupil 301. The height "h" may be related to the diameter "d1,"<br>
i.e., the ratio of the height "h" to diameter "d1" may be equal to or less than one (h/ d1 &gt; 1),<br>
as an indicator of the degree that the eyelid 302 covers the pupil 301. For example, this<br>
ratio may reduce from one to zero once the pupil 301 is completely covered by the eyelid<br>
302.<br>
Similarly, the width "w" may also be related to the diameter "d1" (w// d1 &gt; 1), as an<br>
indicator of the degree that the eyelid 302 covers the pupil 301, e.g., as the eyelid 302<br>
begins to cover more than half of the pupil 301. In addition or alternatively, a ratio of the<br>
height and width (h/w &gt; 1) may relate information on eccentricity of the pupil 301, e.g.,<br>
based upon coverage by the eyelid 302. Such parameters may be analyzed individually,<br>
collectively, and/or along with other oculometric and/or physiological parameters to<br>
monitor, analyze and/or predict future behavior of the user. The data may be compared<br>
with empirical or other data retained or accessed by the processor to provide information<br>
regarding the user's condition, e.g., a COFI value, as described elsewhere herein.<br>
if, for example, the analysis of the user's pupil results in a determination that the<br>
user's alertness level has fallen below a predetermined level, a warning may be provided to<br>
the user and/or to one or more third persons, similar to other embodiments described<br>
herein. Such methods may also be useful to determine whether the user is being affected<br>
by drugs, alcohol, and/or medical conditions, as explained elsewhere herein.<br>
In addition, as a threshold and/or to test the user's vigilance, an apparatus or<br>
system, such as any of those described herein, may test the user's pupillary response. Such<br>
a test may confirm that a patient is active, i.e., not asleep, or even deceased, while wearing<br>
the apparatus. For example, if a light source is flashed for a predetermined duration and/or<br>
pulse frequency at the user's eye, the user's pupil may dilate briefly from its relaxed state<br><br>
(based upon ambient lighting), and then constrict back to the relaxed state within a<br>
predictable period of time.<br>
Turning to FIG. 22A, an exemplary method is shown for testing the vigilance of a<br>
user of any of the apparatus and systems described herein. For example, a user may wear<br>
the apparatus 810 shown in FIG. 18 monitoring one or both of the user's eyes, as described<br>
further above. At step 2210, base or parameters of the user's eye(s) may be determined<br>
under a related state. For example, the relaxed diameter of the pupil may be measured or<br>
otherwise monitored under ambient conditions.<br>
At step 2220, one or more pulses of light may be emitted towards the eye(s), which<br>
may cause the eye(s) to dilate and/or constrict from the relaxed state, e.g., at substantially<br>
the same frequency as the frequency of pulsed light flashes. For example, one or more<br>
emitters on the apparatus 810 may be activated in a predetermined sequence to cause the<br>
eye(s) to dilate. Thereafter, in step 2230, the eye(s) of the user may be monitored, e.g.,<br>
subconsciously or unconsciously with the camera 830 or sensors 822, to determine the<br>
reaction time of the eye to return to the relaxed state. The reaction time may be compared<br>
to an empirical database or other data to confirm that the user is conscious, awake, and/or<br>
alive. If desired, steps 2220 and 2230 may be repeated one or more times to confirm the<br>
reaction time and/or provide an average reaction time, if desired, e.g., to avoid false<br>
negative determinations.<br>
If the light source is outside the visible light range, e.g., within the infrared range,<br>
the pupil may still react to flashes of light in this manner. One advantage of using infrared<br>
light is that it may not distract or bother the user, since the user will not consciously<br>
observe the light. Yet, the pupil may still react to such flashes sufficiently that a system<br>
monitoring the eye may identify when the pupil dilates and constricts in response to such<br>
flashes.<br>
It may be sufficient, e.g., during a threshold test, to generate a single flash of light<br>
and monitor the pupil's response. Alternatively, a series of flashes may be used to monitor<br>
pupillary response over time, e.g., to study trends or eliminate false data that may arise<br>
from a single flash. For a series of flashes, the pulse rate should be longer than the time<br>
the pupil takes to naturally return to its relaxed state after dilating in response to a flash of<br>
light, e.g., at least between about fifty and one hundred milliseconds (50-100 ms).<br>
Alternatively, pulses of light, e.g., near-infrared light (having wavelengths between about<br><br>
640-700 nanometers) may be directed at the user's eye(s). The system may detect<br>
rhythmic fluctuations in pupillary response. Such responses may result from a primitive<br>
oculometric response, possibly relating to night vision, e.g., "seeing" in the dark or sensing<br>
infrared light sources in the dark.<br>
Such pupillary response testing may also be used to identify false positives, e.g.,<br>
when a user has died, yet the system fails to detect any eye closure and/or movement.<br>
Similarly, pupillary response testing may also be able to determine whether a user is asleep<br>
or unconscious. In addition, pupillary response testing may be used to determine whether<br>
a user is under the influence of alcohol, drugs, and the like, which may affect the rate at<br>
which the pupil constricts back to its relaxed state after dilating in response to flashes of<br>
light. In addition or alternatively, pupillary response testing may also be used to determine<br>
the blood concentration or amount of drug or alcohol in the user's body depending on<br>
correlation between oculometric measures and corresponding scientifically-determined<br>
blood levels.<br>
Turning to FIG. 22B, another method for testing threshold vigilance is shown.<br>
This method generally involves providing stimuli instructing the user to deliberately move<br>
their eye(s) in a desired manner, at step 2240, and monitoring the eye at step 2250, e.g., for<br>
deliberate movement confirming that the user has followed the instructions and moved<br>
their eye(s) in the desired manner. Any of the apparatus described herein may include one<br>
or more stimulus devices, e.g., speakers, lights, vibratory or other tactile devices.<br>
Alternatively, such devices may be provided remotely from the user, e.g., on a dashboard<br>
of a vehicle, a video display, and the like.<br>
For example, a user may be instructed to close their eye(s) for a predetermined time<br>
if a visible light on the apparatus is activated. Once the light is activated, the system may<br>
monitor the eye(s) to confirm that the user responds within a predetermined time frame<br>
and/or in a predetermined manner (e.g., one or more blinks in a predetermined sequence).<br>
Alternatively, other stimuli may be provided instead of light flashes, such as visible<br>
instructions on a display (on or separate from the apparatus), audible signals (e.g., verbal<br>
commands from a speaker on or near the device), tactile signals, and the like. In these<br>
embodiments, the user may be instructed to perform a series of actions, e.g., looking up or<br>
down, left or right, blinking in a desired sequence, closing their eye until instructed,<br>
following a pointer on a display, and. the like. Such testing may be useful to confirm, for<br><br>
example, whether a test subject is awake, aware, and/or alert during a series of tests or<br>
while perfonnirig various activities.<br>
In. another embodiment, apparatus and systems, such as those described elsewhere<br>
herein, may be used to control a computer system, e.g., similar to a computer mouse,<br>
joystick, and the like. For example, with reference to the apparatus 810 shown and<br>
described with reference to FIGS. 13, the camera(s) 830 may be used to monitor the<br>
location of the user's pupil(s) to direct and/or activate a mouse pointer on a computer<br>
screen or other display, A processor receiving the image data from the camera 922 may<br>
analyze the image data to determine the relative location of the pupil(s) within the active<br>
area 942 of the detector 940. Optionally, one or more displays may be fixed relative to the<br>
frame 812 disposed in front of or within the field of view of one or both of the user's eyes.<br>
For example, a flat panel LCD or other display (not shown) may be mounted to the frame<br>
812 in place of lenses. Such an apparatus may be used for simulations, e.g., within a<br>
medical or other research facility, for recreational use, e.g., as a video game console, and<br>
the like.<br>
Turning to FIG. 23, an exemplary method is shown for controlling a computing<br>
device based upon detected eye movement using any of the apparatus or systems described<br>
herein. For example, the apparatus 910 shown in FIG. 18A may be used that includes a<br>
fiberoptic bundle 924 for imaging one or both eyes of the user. Optionally, as explained<br>
further below, the apparatus may also carry one or more exocameras, e.g., disposed<br>
adjacent one or both eyes of the user that may be oriented outwardly along the user's<br>
forward view. First, at step 2310, it may be desirable to initialize a system including such<br>
an apparatus, i.e., establish a reference frame, such as abase or reference location, a<br>
reference frame with orthogonal components, and the like. For example, the user may be<br>
instructed to look at a pointer or other predetermined location on the display, thereby<br>
maintaining the user's eye(s), and consequently the user's pupil(s) substantially stationary.<br>
The processor may analyze the image data from the camera 830 while the user's eye(s) are<br>
substantially stationary, e.g., to determine the location of the pupil on the images that<br>
corresponds to the reference point or "base location." For example, the pointer or base<br>
location may be located substantially straight ahead of the user's pupil. Optionally, the<br>
user may be instructed to look sequentially at two or more identified locations on the<br>
display, thereby providing a scale for relative movement of the user's eye. In this<br><br>
alternative, it may be desirable to have the user look at opposite corners of the display,<br>
e.g., to identify the limits of appropriate eye movement relative to the display.<br>
Once initialization is complete, the user may be free to move their eye(s), e.g., left<br>
and right, up and down, e.g., relative to the pointer and/or the rest of the display. At step<br>
2320, the system may monitor such movement of the eye, i.e., the processor may analyze<br>
the image data to determine the relative location of the user's pupil(s) from the base<br>
location(s). For example, if the user moves his/her eye(s) up and right from the base<br>
location, i.e., up and right relative to the pointer on the computer screen, the processor may<br>
determine this movement. In response, at step 2330, the processor may move the pointer<br>
up and right, i.e., thereby tracking the user's gaze. When the user stops moving his/her<br>
eye(s), the processor may stop the pointer once it arrives at the location where the user is<br>
currently looking on the display.<br>
Optionally, at step 2340, the user may be able to execute a command once the<br>
pointer has moved to a desired location on the display, e.g., similar to activating a button<br>
on a mouse. For example, the processor may monitor the image data for a signal from the<br>
user, e.g., one or more purposeful blinks in a predetermined sequence. This may be as<br>
simple as a single blink of a predetermined duration, e.g., several seconds long, to a more<br>
complicated series of blinks, e.g., including one or both of the user's eyes. Alternatively,<br>
the signal may be a predetermined period with no blinks, e.g., three, five, or more seconds<br>
long. When the processor identifies the signal, the processor may activate the command.<br>
For example, the user may stop moving their eye(s) when it reaches an icon, word<br>
command, and the like on the display, and the processor may move the point until it<br>
overlies or otherwise is located at the icon or command. The user may then blink or act, as<br>
explained above, similar to a "double-click" of a button on a computer mouse, thereby<br>
instructing the processor to complete the selected command or communicate the selected<br>
command to a desired destination. For example, the selected command may result in a<br>
computer program being executed, or a piece of equipment or other device being activated,<br>
deactivated, or otherwise controlled in a desired manner. Thus, the system may be used to<br>
complete a variety of tasks, from controlling a computer device coupled to the processor<br>
and/or display, to turning on or off a light switch or vehicle. Such apparatus and/or<br>
systems may thereby provide methods for using a computer hands-free, i.e., using only<br>
movement of the user's eye(s).<br><br>
For example, in one application, the system may be used to operate a vehicle, such<br>
as a helicopter, jet, or other aircraft, e.g., to activate or otherwise control weapons,<br>
navigational, or other onboard systems. In another application, the system may be used in<br>
a video game or other simulation, e.g., to enhance virtual reality immersion. For example,<br>
the system may allow a user to quickly navigate through multiple menus, scenes, or other<br>
activities, while leaving the user's hands See to perform other functions, e.g., perform<br>
other activities in addition or simultaneously with eye-controlled functions, which may<br>
allow more and/or more complicated tasks at the same time.<br>
In addition, one or more exocameras may be used to enhance and/or otherwise<br>
facilitate tracking eye movement relative to the pointer on the display. For example, an<br>
exocamera may be provided adjacent at least one eye, e.g., at a predetermined distance or<br>
other relationship from the eye, that is oriented towards the display. Thus, the exocamera<br>
may provide images of the display, e.g., showing movement of the pointer in real time that<br>
may synchronized with movement of the eye monitored with the endocamera. The<br>
processor may relate this data using triangulation or other algorithms to enhance accuracy<br>
of tracking the pointer with eye movement. This may ensure the accuracy that, when the<br>
user intends to execute a command by blinking with the pointer on a command, the<br>
intended command is actually selected, e.g., when the display shows multiple available<br>
commands.<br>
In addition, such systems and methods may be used in medical or other diagnostic<br>
procedures, such as vigilance testing. For example, the processor may analyze data from<br>
the endocameras and exocameras to correlate movement of the eye(s) relative to images on<br>
the display to study a variety of oculometric parameters, such as slow rolling eye<br>
movement, poor eye fixation and/or tracking, wandering gaze, increased eye blinking,<br>
hypnotic staring, prolonged eyelid droops or blinking, slow velocity eyelid opening and<br>
closing, startled eyelid opening velocities, long-term pupillary constrictive changes,<br>
unstable pupil diameters, obscured visual-evoked pupil reactions, and/or other parameters<br>
discussed elsewhere herein. These procedures may be used to study an individual's<br>
responsive faced with various environmental, alcohol or drug-induced, and/or other<br>
conditions.<br>
Turning to FIG. 24, in another embodiment, anapparatus 2410 may be provided<br>
for transcutaneously lighting an eye 300 of a user wearing the apparatus 2410. The<br><br>
apparatus 2410 may be generally similar to any of the embodiments described herein, such<br>
as the frame 812 shown in FIG. 13. As shown, the apparatus 2410 may include one or<br>
more emitters or other light source(s) 2422 that contact the user's head 308, e.g., the user's<br>
temple(s) adjacent one or both eyes 300 (one shown for simplicity). In addition, the<br>
apparatus 2410 may include one or more sensors, such as fiberoptic bundle 2430, e.g.,<br>
terminating in a lens 2434 for acquiring images of the user's eye 300.<br>
In one exemplary embodiment, an infrared emitter 2422 may be fixedly or<br>
adjustably mounted on one or both ear pieces 2422 of a frame 2412 such that the emitter<br>
2422 contacts and transmits light towards the user's skin. For example, the emitter 2422<br>
may include a plurality of LEDs, which may be emit collimated, non-coherent (non-laser)<br>
infrared light. The emitter 2422 may be oriented generally towards the eye 300 such that<br>
light from the emitter 2422 may travel through or along the user's head 308 into the eye<br>
300, as represented by dashed arrows 2450. For example, it has been found that skin and<br>
other tissue may be at least translucent to certain frequencies of light, such as infrared<br>
light., Thus, at least some of the light from the emitter(s) 2422 may transmit<br>
transcutaneously along or through the user's skin and/or other tissue until at least some of<br>
the light enters the eye 300.<br>
The light may reflect off of the retina (not shown) within the eye 300, such that at<br>
least some of the light escapes out of the pupil 301, as represented by arrows 2452. The<br>
lens 2434 and fiberoptic bundle 2430 may relay images of the eye to a detector (not<br>
shown), similar to other embodiments described herein, which may identify the pupil 301<br>
as a bright spot on the images due to the light 2452. A processor or other device coupled<br>
to the detector may monitor the pupil 301, such as its relative location on the images, size,<br>
and/or shape, similar to other embodiments described herein, e.g., using the "white pupil"<br>
or "dark pupil" techniques described elsewhere herein. In addition or alternatively, the<br>
transcutaneous light may illuminate the entire eye 300, especially the retina, which may be<br>
observed from in front of the user's face, e.g., as a dimmer sphere or other shape with the<br>
pupil 301 showing as a bright spot surrounded by the dimmer shape.<br>
This embodiment may have the advantage that one or more emitters do not have be<br>
positioned in front of the user's eye, which may partially obstruct or distract the user's<br>
field of view. Furthermore, because this system uses infrared sensing cameras and/or<br>
detectors that operated independently of the angle of incident infrared light, this<br><br>
embodiment may eliminate technical difficulties arising out of a loss of proper orientation<br>
of emitters to detectors. In addition, without emitter(s) in front of the eye, glint or other<br>
reflections off of the eye may be eliminated, which may facilitate analyzing the image data.<br>
It will be appreciated that the various components and features described with the<br>
particular embodiments may be added, deleted, and/or substituted with the other<br>
embodiments, depending upon the intended use of the embodiments. For example,<br>
