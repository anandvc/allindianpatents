				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a cost effective and commercially viable process for the preparation of cefpodoxime acid at an industrial scale.<br>
Chemically, cefpodoxime acid is [(6R-[6α,7β(Z)]]-7-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-. methoxyimino) acetamido]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid having Formula I, as shown in the accompanied drawings and is known from the US Patent No. 4,409,215. Although cefpodoxime acid is not suitable for oral administration, its ester derivatives, especially 1-(isoproxycarbonyloxyl)ethyl ester i.e. cefpodoxime proxetil of Formula II, as shown in the accompanied drawings, are valuable orally administered antibiotics characterized by high broad spectrum activity against gram positive and gram negative microorganisms. Cefpodoxime proxetil is an effective alternative to currently used β-lactams for emperical therapy in a wide range of community acquired infections in both adult and paediatric patients.<br>
Several general processes are known for the preparation of cephalosporin antibiotics viz., US 4,4409,215, US 5,109,131, GB 2012276 and WO 00/63214. However, attempts for extending these processes for preparing cefpodoxime acid at an industrial scale did not give desired results with respect to yield and quality. More particularly, the synthetic process comprising coupling of reactive acid derivative of compound of Formula III, as shown in the accompanied drawings, with reactive derivative of an open chain compound of Formula IV, as shown in the accompanied drawings, wherein X is a halogen selected from chloro, bromo and iodo, to get a compound of Formula V, as shown in the accompanied drawings, and its subsequent cyclization with thiourea to obtain cefpodoxime acid of Formula I was found to be unsatisfactory at a commercial scale. Processes cited in US 4,409,215-and GB 2012276 require protection at the carboxylic position of the compound of Formula III followed by the steps of coupling and cyclization as described above. The product obtained is then subjected to hydrolysis to get cefpodoxime acid. The additional steps of protection and deprotection result in low yields and cost escalation. The processes cited in WO 00/63214 and US 5,109,131 require formation of compound of Formula V as above and its subsequent cyclization with thiourea in a mixture of organic solvent and water to afford cefpodoxime acid.<br><br>
Cefpodoxime acid thus obtained is of poor quality and contains anti isomer of cepodoxime acid as a major impurity.<br>
Hence, none of the processes heretofore described are completely satisfactory for various reasons.<br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of cefpodoxime acid of Formula I, which process involves simple operations and gives good yields and high purity (99%) by HPLC. Cefpodoxime acid thus obtained gives cefpodoxime proxetil of very high purity and in high yield.<br>
In particular, the  present invention  provides A process for the preparation of cefpodoxime acid of Formula I as shown in the accompanied drawings, comprising (i)       reacting a compound of Formula VI, as shown in the accompanied drawings, wherein R is hydrogen or a silyl group and R' is a silyl group or COOR1 is a carboxylic acid salt, with a compound of Formula IV,  as shown in the accompanied   drawings,   or  its  acid   halide,   acid   anhydride,   mixed   acid anhydride,  reactive ester, reactive amide and the acid azide derivatives wherein X is a halogen, to obtain a compound of Formula VII as shown in the accompanied drawings, wherein X and R' are as defined above, desilylating   or  acidifying  the  compound   of  Formula  VII   to   isolate  the compound of formula V, as shown in the accompanied drawings, and reacting the compound of Formula V, with thiourea in aqueous medium in the presence of a weak base as described herein to obtain cefpodoxime acid of Formula I, as shown in the accompanied drawings.<br>
Cefpodoxime acid, so obtained may be converted into its ester such as cefpodoxime proxetil by the methods known in the art.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for the preparation of the intermediates of Formula V, wherein X is a halogen. The compounds of Formula V are not in the literature.<br>
Carboxylic acid salts of compound of Formula VI include salt with a metal such as sodium or potassium, or salt with an organic amine such as triethylamine, pyridine, diclyclohexylamine or N, N-dimethylaniline.<br><br>
R and R' in the compound of Formula VI may be silyl groups which may be the same or different. Suitable silyl groups are trialkyl silyl groups wherein the alkyl substitutents may be the same or different. Preferred alkyl substituents are methyl, ethyl, isopropyl and tert-butyl. Preferred silyl groups are trimethylsilyl and tert-butyldimethylsilyl.<br>
X in the compounds of Formula IV, V and VIII is a halogen selected from chloro, bromo and iodo. X is preferably bromo.<br>
Reactive acid derivatives of the compound of Formula IV include the acid halides, the acid anhydride, mixed acid anhydrides, reactive esters, reactive amides and the acid azide. Preferred mixed acid anhydrides include anhydrides with lower alkanoic acids such as pivalic acid, trichloroacetic acid or anhydride with a carbonic acid such as monomethylcarbonate. Preferred reactive esters include p-nitrophenylester, N-hydroxysuccinimido ester, N-hydroxyphthalimido ester, 2-mercaptobenzothioazolyl ester and 2-mercapto-5-methyl-1,3,4-thiadiazolyl ester. Among the reactive acid derivatives of Formula IV, acid halides are preferred.<br>
When the compound of Formula IV is employed in the form of a free acid, the reaction step (i) is carried out in the presence of a condensing agent such as dicylohexylcarbodiimide or a Vilsmier reagent which may be prepared for example from dimethylformamide and phosphorous oxychloride.<br>
Where a reactive derivative of the acid of Formula IV is employed, the use of such a condensing agent is not required, however, it may be desirable to carry out the reaction in the presence of a base which may be an alkali metal compound such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate or an organic amine such as triethylamine, lutidine and pyridine.<br>
The reaction of step (i) is usually conducted in a suitable solvent. When R, R' or both are silyl in the compound of Formula VI, suitable solvents for the reaction include halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, hydrocarbons such as toluene, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran or polar solvents such as dimethylformamide, or a mixture thereof. When R is hydrogen and COOR1 is a<br><br>
carboxylic acid salt in the compound of Formula VI, suitable solvents for the reaction include methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, water, or a mixture thereof.<br>
The starting compounds of Formula VI wherein R, R' or both are silyl may be obtained by silylating the corresponding 7-amino-3-methoxymethyl 3-cephem-4-' carboxylic acid of Formula III with a suitable silylating agent. Appropriate silylating agents include halosilanes such as trimethylsilylchloride (TMCS), dimethyldichlorosilane (DMDCS), silylated amides such as N,  0-bistrimethylsilyl acetamide (BSA), silazanes such as 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS), silylated ureas such as N, N'-bis-(trimethylsilyl) urea (BSU), or a mixture thereof<br>
Where COOR' is a carboxylic acid salt in the compound of Formula VI, it may be obtained in a conventional manner, for example by treatment of compound of Formula III with a base such as sodium bicarbonate, triethylamine etc.<br>
Compounds of Formula III and IV may be obtained by methods known in the art.<br>
Desilylation (Step ii) of a compound of Formula VII (wherein R1 is a silyl group) may be carried out according to conventional methods such as treatment with methanol / water to isolate compound of Formula V.<br>
Isolation of the compound of Formula V is an important aspect of the process of our invention and instrumental in obtaining the compound of Formula I in high yields and good quality. The reactions of steps (i) and (ii) result in the formation of impurities alongwith the desired product which are automatically removed during the isolation of compound of Formula V.<br>
The reaction of a compound of Formula V with thiourea is carried out in the presence of a weak base such as sodium acetate and sodium bicarbonate in an aqueous medium comprising water and a water miscible organic solvent such as ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, acetone, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, N, N-dimethylformamide or a mixture thereof. Compound of Formula V is added to aqueous solution of the weak base at a temperature of about 0 to 5°C. Thereafter,<br><br>
an aqueous solution of thiourea is added to the above mixture at a temperature of about 0 to 10°C. The reaction may then be carried out a temperature of about 0 to 60°C, preferably at 0-25°C, more preferably at 10-20°C. Cefpodoxime acid of purity 99% is obtained by washing the reaction mixture with ethyl acetate and acidifying the aqueous layer to a pH of about 2.5 to 3.<br>
However, the reaction of compound of Formula IV with thiourea is best carried out in water since a mixture of solvent and water may carryover impurities to the aqueous layer which may then precipitate along with the desired product. Also, lower yields are obtained as cefpodoxime acid is soluble in the water miscible solvents mentioned above.<br>
Cefpodoxime acid so obtained may be converted to cefpodoxime proxetil by methods known in the art such as reaction with 1-iodoethylisopropyl carbonate in the presence of 1,8-diazabicyclo [5.4.0] undec-7-ene (DBU) in N, N-dimethylformamide.<br>
In the following section a preferred embodiment is described by way of example to' illustrate the process of this invention. However, it is not intended in any way to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
