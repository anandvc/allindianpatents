SLTBsrrrrriz? PYRIDINE DERIVATIVES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The presets invention relates to compounds, which are openers of the KCNQ family potassium ion channels. The compounds are useful in the treatment of disorders and diseases being responsive to opening of the KCNQ family potassium ion channels; one such disease is epilepsy.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Ion channels are cellular proteins that regulate the flow of ions, including potassium, calcium, chloride and sodium into and out of cells. Such channels are present in all animal and human cells and affect a variety of processes including neuronal transmission, muscle contraction- and cellular secretion.<br>
Humans have over 70 genes encoding potassium channel subtypes (Jentsch Nature Reviews Nevroscienee 2000. 1, 21 -30) with a great diversity with regard to both stucture and function- Neuronal potassium channels, which are found in the brain, are primarily responsible for maintaining a negative resting membrane potential, as well as controlling membrane repolarisation following an action potential.<br>
One subset of potassium channel genes is the KCNQ family. Mutations in four out of five KCNQ genes have been shown to underlie diseases including cardiac arrhythmias, deafness and epilepsy (Jentsch Nature Reviews Neuroscience 2000, 1,21-30).<br>
The KCNQ4 gene is thought to encode the molecular correlate of a potassium channel found in outer hair cells of the cochlea and in Type I hair cells of the vestibular apparatus, in which, mutations can lead to a form of inherited deafness.<br>
KCNQ1 (KvLQTl) is co-assembled with the product of the KCNE1 (minimal K(+&gt;channel<br>
protein) gene in the heart to form a cardiac-delayed rectifier-like K(H-) current. Mutations in this charmd csi cause cme fern of inherited long QT syndrome type 1 (LQT1), as well as being assoc^sd wish a form of deafness (Robbins Pharmacol Ther 2001, 90. 1-19).<br><br>
The genes KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 were discovered in 3988 and appear to be mutated in an inherited form of epilepsy known as benign familial neonatal convulsions (Rogawski Trends in Neurosciences 2000: 23; 393-398). The proteins encoded by the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 proteins are localised in the p)TamidaI neurons of the human cortex and hippocampus, regions of the brain associated with seizure generation and propagation (Cooper e: al. Proceedings National Academy of Science USA 2000, 91, 4914-4919).<br>
KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 are two potassium channel subunits that form "M-currents" when expressed in vitro. The M-current is a non-inactivating potassium current found in many neuronal cell types. In each cell type, it is dominant in controlling membrane excitability by being the only sustained current in the range of action potential initiation (Marrion Annual Review Physiology? 1997, 59. 483-504). Modulation of the M-current has dramatic effects on neuronal excitability, for example activation of the current will reduce neuronal excitability. Openers of these KCNQ channels, or activators of the M-cuirent will reduce excessive neuronal activity and may thus be of use in the treatment of seizures and other diseases and disorders characterised by excessive neuronal activity, such as neuronal hyperexcitability including convulsive disorders, epilepsy and neuropathic pain.<br>
Retigabine (D-23129; 7V-(2-amino-4-(4-fluoroben2ylamino)-phenyl) carbamic acid ethyl ester) and analogues thereof are disclosed in EP554543. Retigabine is an anti-convulsive compound with a broad spectrum and potent anticonvulsant properties, both in vitro and in vivo. It is active after oral and intraperitoneal administration in rats and mice in a range of anticonvulsant tests including: electrically induced seizures, seizures induced chemically by pentylenetetrazole, picrotoxin and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and in a genetic animal model, the DBA/2 mouse (Rostock et al. Epilepsy Research 1996, 23,211 -223). In addition, retigabine is active in the amygdala kindling model of complex partial seizures, further indicating that this compound has potential for anti-convulsive therapy. In clinical trials, retigabine has recently shown effectiveness in reducing the incidence of seizures in epileptic patients (Bialer et al. Epilepsy Research 2002, 51, 31-71).<br>
Retigabine has been shown to activate a K(+) current in neuronal cells and the pharmacology of this induced current displays concordance with the published<br><br>
phannacclogy of the M-charmeL which recently was correlated to the KCNQ2/3 K(-r) channel hezercmuhiiner. This suggests that activation of KCNQ2/3 channels may be responsible for some of the anticonvulsant activity of this agent (Wickenden et al. Molecular Pharmacolog}- 2000. 58. 591-600) - and that other agents working by the same mechanism may have similar uses.<br>
KCNQ 2 and 3 channels have also been reported to be upregulated in models of neuropathic pain (Wickenden ec ai. Society for Neuroscience Aosrracis 2002, 454. T)i and potassium channel modulators have been hypothesised to be active in both neuropathic pain and epilepsy (Schroder et al. Neuropharmacology 2001, 40, 888-898).<br>
Retigabine has also been shown to be beneficial in animal models of neuropathic pain (Blackbum-Munro and Jensen European Journal of Pharmacology 2003. 460. 109-116), and it is thus suggested that openers of KCNQ channels will be of use in treating pain disorders including neuropathic pain.<br>
The localisation of KCNQ channel mRNA is reported in brain and other central nervous system areas associated with pain (Goldstein et al. Society for Neuroscience Abstracts 2003, 53.8).<br>
In addition to a role in neuropathic pain, the expression of mRNA for KCNQ 2-5 in the trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia and in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis implies that openers of these channels may also affect the sensory processing of migraine pain (Goldstein et al. Society for Neuroscience Abstracts 2003, 53.8).<br>
Recent reports demonstrate that mRNA for KCNQ 3 and 5, in addition to that for KCNQ2, are expressed in astrocytes and glial cells. Thus KCNQ 2,3 and 5 channels may help modulate synaptic activity in the CNS and contribute to the neuroprotective effects of KCNQ channel openers (Noda et al., Society for Neuroscience Abstracts 2003, 53.9).<br>
Retigabine and other KCNQ modulators may thus exhibit protection against the<br>
neurodegenerative aspects of epilepsy, as retigabine has been shown to prevent limbic neurodegeneration and the expression of markers of apoptosis following kainic acid-induced<br><br>
status epiiepticus in the rat (Foeri et ai. Epilepsia 2002. 45 Suppi z, S-i-rf;. This may have relevance for preventing the progression of epilepsy in patients, L=_ be irri-^pileptogenic, Retigabine has also been shown to delay the progression of hippocainpai V^wT?:-a- in the rat a further model of enilsDsv development fTober et al. Eurovean Jatrna! Of Pharmacology-1996.. 303, 163-169).<br>
It is thus suggested that these properties of retigabine and other KCNQ moduiaiors-may prevent neuronal damage induced by excessive neuronal activation, and such compounds may be of use in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, and be disease modifying (or antiepileptogenic) in patients with epilepsy.<br>
Given that anticonvulsant compounds such as benzodiazepines and chlormethiazole are used clincially in the treatment of the ethanol withdrawal syndrome and that other anticonvulsant compounds e.g. gabapentin, are very effective in animal models of this syndrome (Watson et al. Neuropharmacology? 1997, 36. 1369-1375). other anticonvulsant compounds such as KCNQ openers are thus expected to be effective in this condition.<br>
mRNA for KCNQ 2 and 3 submits are found in brain regions associated with anxiety and emotional behaviours such as bipolar disorder e.g. hippocampus and amygdala (Saganich et al. Journal ofNeuroscience 2001,21, 4609-4624), and retigabine is reportedly active in some animal models of anxiety-like behaviour (Hartz et al. Journal ofPsychopharmacology 2003,17 suppl 3, A28,B16), and other clinically used anticonvulsant compounds are used in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Thus, KCNQ openers may be useful for the treatment of anxiety disorders and bipolar disorder.<br>
WO 200196540 discloses the use of modulators of the M-current formed by expression of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes for insomnia, while WO 2001092526 discloses that modulators of KCNQ5 can be utilized for the treatment of sleep disorders.<br>
WOO 1/022953 describes the use of retigabine for prophylaxis and treatment of neuropathic<br>
pain such as allodynia, hyperalgesic pain, phantom pain, neuropathic pain related to diabetic neuropathy and neuropathic pain related to migraine.<br><br>
WO02;049628 describes the \:se cf reiigabine for the treatment c-f ^~?oe~y disorders such as anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder, panic anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, social phobia, performance anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, acute srress rsacdon, adjustment disorders, hypochondriacal disorders- separation anxiety -disorder, agoraphobia and specific phobias,<br>
WO97/15300 describes the use of reugabine for the treatment of oeorodegtamraiive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease; Huntington's cnorea; sclerosis sucu as muiupie sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Creutzfeld-Jakob disease; Parkinson's disease; encephalopathies induced by AIDS or infection by rubella viruses, herpes viruses, borrelia and unknown pathogens; trauma-induced neurodegenerations; neuronal hyperexcitation states such as in medicament withdrawal or intoxication; and neurodegenerative diseases of the peripheral nervous system such as polyneuropathies and polynsuritides.<br>
KCNQ channel openers have also been found to be effective in the treatment of stroke, therefore it can be expected that selective KCNQ openers are effective in the treatment of stroke (Schroder et al., Pfiugers Arch.. 2003; 446(5): 607-16; Cooper and Jan, Arch Neurol., 2003, 60(4):496-500; Jensen, CNS Drug Rev., 2002, 8(4):353-60).<br>
KCNQ channels have been shown to be expressed in dopaminergic and cholinergic circuits in the brain that are associated with the brain's reward system, particularly the ventral tegmental area (Cooper et al., JNeurosci, 2001,21, 9529-9540). Therefore, KCNQ channel openers are expected to be effective in hyperexcitability disorders that involve the brain!s reward system such as cocaine abuse, nicotine withdrawal and ethanol withdrawal.<br>
Potassium channels comprised of the KCNQ4 subunits are expressed in the inner ear (Kubisch et al., Cell., 1999 Feb 5;96(3):437-46) and opening of these channels is therefore expected to treat tinnitus.<br>
Hence, there is a great desire for novel compounds which are potent openers of the KCNQ<br>
family of potassium channels.<br><br>
Also desired are novel compounds with improved properties relative to known compounds, which are openers of the KCNQ family potassium channels, such as retigabine. Improvement of one or more of the following parameters is desired: half-life., clearance, selectivity, interactions with other medications, bioavailability, potency, formulability. chemical stability7, metabolic stability, membrane permeability, solubility and therapeutic index. The improvement of such parameters may lead to improvements such as:<br>
•	an improved dosing regime by reducing the number of required doses a day.<br>
•	ease of administration to patients on multiple medications,<br>
•	reduced side effects,<br>
•	enlarged therapeutic index,<br>
•	improved tolerability or<br>
•	improved compliance.<br>

The compounds of the invention have been tested and shown effect in at least one of the<br>
below models:<br>
Relative efflux through the KCNQ2 channel.<br>
This exemplifies a KCNQ2 screening protocol for evaluating compounds of the preseni invention. The assay measures the relative efflux through the KCNQ2 channel, and was carried out according to a method described by Tang et al. (Tang, W. et. aL J. BiomoL Screen. 2001. 6? 325-331) forhERG potassium channels with the modifications described below.<br>
An adequate number of CHO cells stably expressing voltage-gated KCNQ2 channels were plated at a density sufficient to yield a confluent mono-layer on the day before the experiment. The cells were loaded with 1 jxCi/ml [86Rb] over night On the day of the experiment cells were washed with a HBSS-containing buffer (Hanks balanced salt solution provided from Invitrogen, cat# 14025-050). Cells were pre-incubated with drug for 30 minutes and the 86Rb+ efflux was stimulated by a submaximal concentration of 15 mM potasium chloride in the continued presence of drug for additional 30 minutes. After a suitable incubation period, the supernatant was removed and counted in a liquid scintillation counter (Tricarb). Cells were lysed with 2 mM sodium hydroxide and the amount of Tlb+ was counted. The relative efflux was calculated ((CPMsupe^CPMsupcr^ CPMceii))cmpd/<br>

The compounds of the invention have an EC50 of less than 20000nM. hi most cases less than 2000 nM and in many cases less than 200 nM. Accordingly, the compounds of me invention<br><br>
are considered to be useful in the treatment of disesLses associated with the KCNQ family potassium channels.<br>
Electrophysiological patch-clamp recordings in CHO cells<br>
Voltage-activated KCNQ2 currents were recorded from mammalian CHO cells by use of conventional patch-clamp recordings techniques in the whole-cell patch-clamp configuration (Hamill OP etal. PfliigersArch 1981; 391: 85-100). CHO cells with stable oppression oi voitago-acuvaieu KCJNQ2 cnanneib were grown under normai cell culture conditions in CO2 incubators and used for electrophysiological recordings 1-7 days after plating. KCNQ2 potassium channels were activated by voltage steps up to + 80 mV in increments of 5-20 mV (or with a ramp protocol) from a membrane holding potential between - 100 mV and - 40 mV (Tatulian L et al. JNeuroscience 2001; 21 (15): 5535-5545). The electrophysiological effects induced by the compounds were evaluated on various parameters of the voltage-activated KCNQ2 current. Especially effects on the activation threshold for the current and on the maximum induced current were studied.<br>
Some of the compounds of the invention have been tested in this test. A left-ward shift of the activation threshold or an increase in the maximum induced potassium current is expected to decrease the activity in neuronal networks and thus make the compounds useful in diseases with increased neuronal activity - like epilepsia.<br>
Electrophysiological recordings of KCNQ2, KCNQ2/KCNQ3 or KCNQ5 channels in oocytes<br>
Voltage-activated KCNQ2, KCNQ2/KCNQ3 or KCNQ5 currents were recorded from Xenopus oocytes injected with mRNA coding for KCNQ2, KCNQ2+KCNQ3 or KCNQ5 ion channels (Wang et al., Science 1998,282, 1890-1893; Lerche et nL9JBiol Chem 2000, 275, 22395-400). KCNQ2, KCNQ2/KCNQ3 or KCNQ5 potassium channels were activated by voltage steps from the membrane holding potential (between - 100 mV and - 40 mV) up to 4- 40 mV in increments of 5-20 mV (or by a ramp protocol). The electrophysiological effects induced by the compounds were evaluated on various parameters of the voltage-activated KCNQ25 KCNQ2/KCNQ3 or KCNQ5 currents. Especially effects on the activation threshold for the current and on the maximum induced current were studied.<br><br>
The hvperpoiarizing enecis 01 so—^ c-f :i~e ^rn~poinds were also tested directly on the membrane potential airing current cLarrp.<br>
Maxiiauni electroshock<br>
The test was conducted in srouns or male mice using corneal electrodes and administerins a square wave current of 26mA for 0.4 seconds in order to induce a convulsion characterised by a tonic hind limb extension (Wlaz et al. Epilepsy Research 1998; 30, 219-229).<br>
Pilocarpine induced seizures<br>
Pilocarpine induced seizures are induced by intraperitoneal injection of pilocarpine 250mg/kg to groups of male mice and observing for seizure activity resulting in loss of posture within a period of 30 minutes (Starr et al. Pharmacolog)' Biochemistry and Behavior<br>
1993,45,321-325).<br>
Electrical seizure -threshold test<br>
A modification of the up-and-down method (lumbal! et al. Radiation Research 1957, 1-12) was used to determine the median threshold to induce tonic hind-limb extension in response to corneal electroshock in groups of male mice. The first mouse of each group received an electroshock at 14 mA, (0.4 s, 50 Hz) and was observed for seizure activity. If a seizure was observed the current was reduced by 1 mA for the next mouse, however, if no seizure was observed then the current was increased by 1 mA. This procedure was repeated for all 15 mice in the treatment group.<br>
Chemical seizure -threshold test<br>
The threshold dose of pentylenetetrazole required to induce a clonic convulsion was measured by timed infusion of pentylenetetrazole (5mg / mL at 0.5 mL/minute) into a lateral tail vein of groups of male mice (Nutt et al. J Pharmacy and Pharmacology 1986, 38, 697-698).<br>
Amygdala kindling<br>
Rats underwent surgery to implantation of tri-poiar electrodes into the dorsolateral amygdala. After surgery the animals were allowed to recover before the groups of rats received either varying doses of test compouDd or the drag's vehicle. The animals were<br><br>
stimulated with their initial after discharge threshold - 25 uA daily for 3-5 weeks arid on each occasion seizure severity, seizure duration, and duration of electrical after discharge were noted. (Racine. ElectroencephalograpJiy and Clinical Neurophysiology* 1972, 32, 281-294).<br>
Side effects<br>
Central nervous system side-effects were measured by measuring the time mice would romau^ vi* xOtai'ou apparatus (Capacio oi ai. urug una Cnemicai loxicoiogy 1992, ID, A /"/-201); or by measuring their locomotor activity by counting the number of infra-red beams crossed in a test cage (Watson et al. Neuropharmacology 1997, 36,1369-1375). Hypothermic actions on the animals core body temperature of the compound were measured by either rectal probe or implanted radiotelemetry transmitters capable of measuring temperature (Keeney etal. Physiology' and Behaviour 2001, 74, 177-184).<br>
Pharmacokinetics<br>
The pharmacokinetic properties of the compounds were determined via. i.v. and p.o. dosing to Spraque Dawley rats, and, thereafter, drawing blood samples over 20 hours. Plasma concentrations were determined with LC/MS/MS.<br><br><br><br>
