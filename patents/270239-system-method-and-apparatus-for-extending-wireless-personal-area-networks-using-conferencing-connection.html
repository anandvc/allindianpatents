				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention.<br>
[001] ThA present invention relates generally to conferencing, and more particularly,<br>
to extending the range of wireless piconets or wireless Personal Area<br>
Networks (PANs) by use of a conferencing connection.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art.<br>
[002] Audio conferencing and video conferencing enable geographically remote<br>
individuals or groups to communicate with each other from their respective<br>
locations. Conferencing serves a valuable purpose by reducing the time and<br>
expense required by traveling to meet in person. Accordingly,<br>
teleconferencing enables increased profitability, productivity, and efficiency<br>
within or among organizations. Conferencing also allows enterprises to speed<br>
decision-making and empower dispersed teams. Conferencing is particularly<br>
beneficial in the fields of business, medicine, education, and government.<br>
[003] In audio conferencing, speakerphones are examples of endpoint devices used<br>
to enable audio communication between participants at two or more sites. An<br>
example of a speakerphone can be found in the POLYCOM®<br>
SOUNDSTATION® line of products. Video conferencing offers the<br>
additional ability to communicate graphic information and to view the facial<br>
expressions and body language of the conference participant(s) located at a<br>
remote site. Video conferencing offers the benefits of face-to-face<br>
communication without the inconvenience, expense, and uncertainty<br>
associated with traveling. An example of a video conferencing unit can be<br>
found in the POLYCOM® VIEWSTATION® line of products.<br>
*1»&gt;	*-t*	&gt;-«r	»-(<br>
[004] It is often desirable to share data with remote participants during a conference.<br>
Video conferencing and collaboration, together with data sharing and<br>
collaboration, allow increasingly dispersed organizations to pull their human<br>
Page2of 26<br><br>
and information resources together to create new ways of working and<br>
interacting. A video conferencing system can provide a rich and effective<br>
collaborative environment, even though participants may be thousands of<br>
miles apart.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[005] Wireless devices are becoming increasingly prevalent. Eliminating wires<br>
offers flexibility and mobility, and eliminates clutter. Huge sums have been<br>
invested worldwide on wireless technologies and standards. Current wireless<br>
technologies, such as Bluetooth, 802.11, and IR (infrared), are limited,<br>
however, for use within a restricted range.<br>
[006] A need has therefore arisen to provide conferencing solutions that overcome<br>
the deficiencies of the prior art. Embodiments of the present invention<br>
advantageously combine features of long-distance audio and video<br>
conferencing with features of short-range wireless technology.<br>
[007] A video conferencing unit establishes a wireless piconet in the vicinity of the<br>
video conferencing unit. When engaged in an audio or video conference with<br>
one or more remote conferencing units, the piconet may be extended to<br>
include the remote locations using the data channels employed by the video<br>
conferencing system. In this way, devices in wireless communication with<br>
any one of the conferencing units can connect to a remote piconet to receive<br>
and/or transmit data over the conference connection. Embodiments of the<br>
present invention provide a Bluetooth bridge that allows virtual physical<br>
proximity.<br>
[008]         Thus, during an audio or video conference, another mode of communication is<br>
n-t*	&gt;~f*	*-**	*+••<br>
advantageously provided, wherein remote devices can communicate wirelessly<br>
as if they are in the same room. For example, a wireless device at a near end<br>
can wirelessly transmit data to a near-end video conferencing unit, which<br>
Page2Afo26<br><br>
sends the data via a conference connection to a far-end conferencing unit,<br>
which wirelessly transmits the data to a far-end wireless device. Examples of<br>
such wirelessly transmitted data include electronic business cards, images,<br>
Bluetooth pen data, Bluetooth whiteboard data, phone numbers, video<br>
numbers, calendar data, address book data, keyboard data, mouse data, audio<br>
from a wireless microphone, audio to a wireless loudspeaker, etc.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention therefore improve and enhance<br>
collaboration among remotely located parties.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0012] Reference is now made to Figure 1, which depicts a wireless-network-enabled<br>
conference endpoint 100 at a first physical location 105 (Site A). Endpoint<br>
100 may comprise a wireless-network-enabled video conferencing unit<br>
(VCU). An exemplary block diagram of a suitable video conferencing unit is<br>
depicted in Figure 3. In other embodiments, endpoint 100 may comprise a<br>
wireless-network-enabled audio conferencing unit without video capability.<br>
#-fr	**•■	***■<br>
For  example,   endpoint   100   may  comprise   a  wireless-network-enabled<br>
speakerphone comprising the components of the VCU of Figure 3, excluding<br>
Page 3 of 26<br><br>
any video channels, video encoders, video decoders, video monitors, and<br>
video cameras.<br>
[0013] Endpoint 100 is capable of establishing a radio-frequency Personal Area<br>
Network 110 (PAN A) with one or more similarly enabled devices 120, 130,<br>
and 140. In some embodiments, the one or more devices 120, 130, and 140<br>
may comprise Bluetooth-enabled devices capable of short-range wireless<br>
communications according to the Bluetooth standard. The one or more<br>
devices 120, 130, and 140 may comprise such devices as, for example, a<br>
Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a mobile phone, a printer, a laptop, a<br>
display device, a projector, a camera, a Bluetooth whiteboard, a Bluetooth<br>
pen, a speaker, a microphone, a headset, a keyboard, a mouse, and any other<br>
devices capable of communicating wirelessly in a PAN. PAN A 110 is not<br>
limited to a Bluetooth piconets and may, for example, comprise an Ultrawide<br>
Band ("UWB") network or other suitable network. In other embodiments,<br>
infrared (IR) or 802.11 communications may be used.<br>
[0014] Also shown in Figure 1 is a wireless-network-enabled conference endpoint<br>
150 at a physical location 155 (Site B) which is remote from location 105 (Site<br>
A). Endpoint 150 may comprise a wireless-network-enabled video<br>
conferencing unit 150. An exemplary block diagram of a suitable video<br>
conferencing unit is depicted in Figure 3. In other embodiments, endpoint 150<br>
may comprise a wireless-network-enabled audio conferencing unit without<br>
video capability. For example, endpoint 150 may comprise a wireless-<br>
network-enabled speakerphone comprising the components of the VCU of<br>
Figure 3, excluding any video channels, video encoders, video decoders, video<br>
monitors, and video cameras.<br>
[0015] In one embodiment, endpoints 100 and 150 are capable of audiovideo (AV)<br>
and data communication via a conference connection 145. ^The conference<br>
connection 145 may comprise a video channel, an audio channel, a control<br>
channel, and a Bluetooth channel. The conference connection 145 may<br>
comprise,  for example, one or more ISDN (Integrated Services Digital<br>
Page 4 of 26<br><br>
Network) lines, an Internet Protocol (IP) connection over a Local Area<br>
Network (LAN), a Wide Area Network (WAN), or the Internet, or any other<br>
suitable data communications means such as a fiber optic connection,<br>
microwave, or satellite link, etc. Any IP-based standard may be employed,<br>
whether now known or later developed. Examples of presently known IP-<br>
based standards include without limitation Real Time Transport Protocol<br>
(RTP), Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP), Session Initiation Protocol<br>
(SIP), H-Series (e.g., H.323, and H.324, etc.), and T-Series (e.g., T.120, etc.),<br>
among others. In other embodiments, wherein audio conferencing is enabled<br>
and video conferencing is not, conference connection 145 may comprise, for<br>
example, a VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol), SIP, or ISDN connection.<br>
[0016] Endpoint 150 is capable of establishing a wireless Personal Area Network 160<br>
(PAN B) with one or more devices 170 and 180. PAN B 160 may comprise a<br>
Bluetooth piconet. The one or more devices 170 and 180 may comprise, for<br>
example, Bluetooth-enabled devices capable of short-range wireless<br>
communications using the Bluetooth system. The one or more devices 170<br>
and 180 may comprise such devices as, for example, a Personal Digital<br>
Assistant (PDA), a mobile phone, a printer, a laptop, a display device, a<br>
projector, a camera, a Bluetooth whiteboard, a Bluetooth pen, a speaker, a<br>
microphone, a headset, a keyboard, a mouse, and any other devices capable of<br>
communicating wirelessly in a PAN.<br>
[0017] Using connection 145, PAN A 110 may be linked to PAN B 160 such that<br>
devices 120, 130, 140, 170, and 180 (and any other devices which may join<br>
PAN A or PAN B) are in data communication with one another. Video<br>
conferencing connection 145 therefore allows virtual physical proximity of<br>
devices that are hundreds or thousands of miles away.<br>
[0018] While Figure 1 depicts a point-to-point conferencing sj«tem, the system can<br>
be scaled to provide for multipoint conferencing, in which additional video<br>
conferencing units are linked by connection 145. Connection 145 may<br>
comprise   a  multipoint  control   unit   (MCU)  to   enable   multiple   video<br>
Page 5 of 26<br><br>
conferencing units to join in a single video conference. In a three-party<br>
conference, for example, wherein each PAN comprises a Bluetooth piconet,<br>
the maximum number of devices in each PAN is tripled.<br>
[0019] Bluetooth is a standard and a specification for small form-factor, low-cost,<br>
short-range radio links between mobile PCs, mobile phones, peripherals, and<br>
other portable devices. Unlike conventional radio operator networks, a<br>
Bluetooth piconet does not require an access point and, unlike infrared<br>
communication (e.g., per the IrDA standard), Bluetooth does not require a<br>
line-of-sight connection.<br>
[0020] Bluetooth devices can function in circuit switched mode and packet switched<br>
mode. Circuit switched mode is the most common mode for voice<br>
communication, while packet switched mode is usually preferred for Internet<br>
data and higher bandwidth mobile communication systems.<br>
[0021] A Bluetooth Personal Area Network includes a master and up to seven slaves,<br>
thereby permitting the interconnection of up to eight devices in a limited<br>
radius (e.g., 10 meters). In a process referred to as Device Discovery, the<br>
master seeks devices by broadcasting requests; those slaves which are in a<br>
"discoverable" state answer with their identification numbers. Data<br>
encryption is available for those users and applications that require additional<br>
security.<br>
[0022] Bluetooth profiles are published definitions of implementations of Bluetooth<br>
wireless technology for particular uses. Profiles are the "services" offered by<br>
a device. In order for two Bluetooth-enabled devices to interoperate to<br>
complete a user task, both devices must implement a set of common profiles.<br>
[0023]       The signal transmitted by the Bluetooth link may be either half-duplex or full-<br>
    duplex. Full duplex links in a Bluetooth piconet can send data at more than 64<br>
Kbps - a speed sufficient to accommodate several voice channels.   A half-<br>
duplex link can be established with a data rate of 721 kilobits per second in<br>
Page 6 of 26<br><br>
one direction and 57.6 Kbps in the other. If a half-duplex link having the<br>
same speed in both directions is required, a link with 432.6 Kbps in each<br>
direction can be made.<br>
[0024] Unlike many other wireless standards, the Bluetooth wireless specification<br>
includes both link layer and application layer definitions for product<br>
developers which support data, voice and content-centric applications.<br>
[0025] The Bluetooth protocol architecture is further described in the Bluetooth<br>
specification. The contents of the most recent Bluetooth Specification Rev<br>
v2.0 + EDR, dated November 4, 2004, which can be found at<br>
http://www.bluetooth.com, are incorporated herein by reference. The<br>
principles of various embodiments of the present invention may be used,<br>
however, with prior and next generations of the Bluetooth specification.<br>
[0026] The Bluetooth specification may be described as a protocol stack with the<br>
Bluetooth Radio layer as its base. The radio layer defines the requirements for<br>
a Bluetooth transceiver operating in the 2.4 GHz ISM (industrial, scientific<br>
and medical) band. A transceiver that takes part in a power-controlled link<br>
must be able to measure its own receiver signal strength and determine if the<br>
transmitter on the other side of the link should increase or decrease its output<br>
power level. A Receiver Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) makes this possible.<br>
The instructions to alter the transmitter power are carried in the LMP (Link<br>
Manager Protocol) link.<br>
[0027] Above the radio layer in the Bluetooth stack is the Baseband layer which<br>
describes the specification of the Bluetooth Link Controller (LC) which<br>
carries out the baseband protocols and other low-level link routines. The<br>
baseband is the physical layer of the Bluetooth stack. It manages physical<br>
channels and links apart from other services like error correction, data<br>
	*-t*	*fr	*f<br>
whitening, hop selection and Bluetooth security. The baseband protocol is<br>
implemented as a Link Controller which works with the link -manager for<br>
carrying out link level routines like link connection and power control.   The<br>
Page 7 of 26<br><br>
baseband also manages asynchronous and synchronous links, handles packets<br>
and does paging and inquiry to access and inquire Bluetooth devices in the<br>
area. The baseband transceiver applies a time-division duplex (TDD) scheme<br>
(alternate transmit and receive). Therefore, apart from the different hopping<br>
frequency (frequency division), the time is also slotted.<br>
[0028] Thirteen different packet types are defined for the baseband layer of the<br>
Bluetooth system. Each packet consists of three entities: the access code<br>
(68/72 bits), the header (54 bits), and the payload (0-2745 bits). Access codes<br>
are used for timing synchronization, offset compensation, paging and inquiry.<br>
The header contains information for packet acknowledgement, packet<br>
numbering for out-of-order packet reordering, flow control, slave address and<br>
error check for header. The packet payload can contain voice field, data field<br>
or both. If it has a data field, the payload will also contain a payload header.<br>
[0029] A Bluetooth controller operates in two major states: Standby and Connection.<br>
There are seven sub-states which are used to add slaves or make connections<br>
in the piconet. These are page, page scan, inquiry, inquiry scan, master<br>
response, slave response and inquiry response. The Standby state is the<br>
default low power state in the Bluetooth unit. Only the native clock is running<br>
and there is no interaction with other devices. In the Connection state, the<br>
master and slave can exchange packets, using the channel (master) access<br>
code and the master Bluetooth clock.<br>
[0030] The Link Manager carries out link setup, authentication, link configuration<br>
and other protocols. It discovers other remote Link Managers and<br>
communicates with them via the Link Manager Protocol (LMP). To perform<br>
its service provider role, the Link Manager uses the services of the underlying<br>
Link Controller (LC).<br>
**»■	w*	M*<br>
[0031] The Link Manager Protocol essentially consists of a number of PDLJ (protocol<br>
Data-Units), which are sent from one device to another, determined by the<br>
Page 8 of 26<br><br>
AM_ADDR in the packet header.   Link Manager PDUs are always sent as<br>
single-slot packets and the payload header is therefore one byte.<br>
[0032] When a connection has been established between two Bluetooth devices, the<br>
connection consists of an ACL link. One or more SCO links can then be<br>
established.<br>
[0033] Each Bluetooth link has a timer that is used for link supervision. This timer is<br>
used to detect link loss caused by devices moving out of range, the power-<br>
down of a device, or other similar failure. An LMP procedure is used to set<br>
the value of the supervision timeout.<br>
[0034] The Host Controller Interface (HCI) provides a command interface to the<br>
Baseband Link Controller and Link Manager and access to hardware status<br>
and control registers. It provides a uniform command method of accessing the<br>
Bluetooth baseband capabilities. The HCI Link commands provide the host<br>
with the ability to control the link layer connections to other Bluetooth<br>
devices. These commands allow the Link Manager to exchange LMP<br>
commands with remote Bluetooth devices.<br>
[0035] The Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) is above the<br>
Baseband Protocol in the Bluetooth stack and resides in the data link layer. It<br>
supports higher level protocol multiplexing, packet segmentation and<br>
reassembly, and the conveying of quality of service information. L2CAP<br>
permits higher level protocols and applications to transmit and receive L2CAP<br>
data packets up to 64 kilobytes in length. Both Synchronous Connection-<br>
Oriented (SCO) links and Asynchronous Connection-Less (ACL) links are<br>
supported. L2CAP is packet-based, but follows a communication model<br>
based on channels. A channel represents a data flow between L2CAP entities<br>
in remote devices.   Channels may be connection-oriented or connectionless.<br>
»-f*	*+r	tfp-<br>
L2CAP relies on the flow control mechanism provided by the Link Manager<br>
-layer in the baseband.<br>
Page 9 of26<br><br>
[0036] The RFCOMM protocol provides emulation of RS-232 serial ports over the<br>
L2CAP protocol. Two device types exist that RFCOMM accommodates:<br>
Type 1 devices (communication end points such as computer and printers);<br>
and, Type 2 devices (devices that are part of the communication segment such<br>
as modems). On Type 1 devices, some port drivers must provide flow control<br>
services as specified by the API they are emulation. For example, an<br>
application may request a particular flow control mechanism such as<br>
XON/XOFF or RTS/CTS and expect the port driver to handle the flow<br>
control. On Type 2 devices, the port driver may need to perform flow control<br>
on the non-RFCOMM part of the communication path - the physical RS-232<br>
port.<br>
[0037] The Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) provides a means for applications to<br>
discover which services are provided by or available through a Bluetooth<br>
device. It also allows applications to determine the characteristics of those<br>
available services. A specific Service Discovery protocol is required in the<br>
Bluetooth environment inasmuch as the set of services that are available<br>
changes dynamically based on the RF proximity of Bluetooth-enabled devices<br>
which may be in motion. SDP uses a request/response model wherein each<br>
transaction consists of one request protocol data unit (PDU) and one response<br>
PDU. Every SDP PDU consists of a PDU header followed by PDU-specific<br>
parameters. The header contains three fields: a PDU ID which identifies the<br>
type of PDU; a TransactionID field which uniquely identifies request PDUs<br>
thereby permitting the matching of response PDUs to request PDUs; and, a<br>
ParameterLength field that specifies the length (in bytes) of all parameters<br>
contained in the PDU.<br>
[0038] SDP allows Bluetooth-enabled devices to discover what other Bluetooth-<br>
enabled devices have to offer in the way of services. The process of looking<br>
for any offered services is generally referred to as "browsing"; "searching"<br>
generally refers to looking for a specific service. _ In SDP, the mechanism for<br>
browsing for services is based on an attribute shared by all services classes<br>
Page 10 of 26<br><br>
called the BrowseGroupList attribute. The value of this attribute contains a<br>
list of Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs). Each UUID represents a<br>
browse group with which a service may be associated for the purpose of<br>
browsing.<br>
[0039] Reference is now made to Figure 2, which depicts a block diagram of an<br>
exemplary video conferencing system in accordance with one embodiment of<br>
the present invention. In the example of Figure 2, a video conferencing unit<br>
200 in a conference room A is capable of establishing a radio-frequency PAN<br>
with various Bluetooth-enabled devices in conference room A. In the present<br>
example, the Bluetooth-enabled devices in the PAN in conference room A<br>
include a printer 220, a PDA 230, and a cellular telephone 240. Other<br>
Bluetooth-enabled devices, including but not limited to those described above<br>
in connection with Figure 1, may be included in the PAN in conference room<br>
A.<br>
[0040] Various layers of the video conferencing unit 200, including radio layer 202,<br>
hardware layer 204, HCI layer 206, L2CAP layer 208, other Bluetooth stack<br>
components 210, and application layer 212 are depicted in Figure 2.<br>
Additional layers may be included, such as those as described in the Bluetooth<br>
specification, but are not illustrated for purposes of simplicity.<br>
[0041] A network interface (NI) 214 is linked to the HCI layer 206 via channel 216.<br>
The network interface 214 may operate according to the H.323 standard for<br>
audio, video, and data communications across IP-based networks, including<br>
the Internet. The network interface 214 may also operate according to the<br>
H.320 standard for ISDN video conferencing. The network interface 214 may<br>
also operate according to other standards and protocols, whether currently<br>
known or later developed. In accordance with the present embodiment,<br>
channel 216 may comprise a proprietary RTP channel for sending and<br>
receiving Bluetooth data.<br>
Page 11 of 26<br><br>
[0042] The video conferencing unit 200 in conference room A is capable of sending<br>
and receiving audio, video, and data via a broadband connection 245, to and<br>
from a video conferencing unit 250 in conference room B, which is remote<br>
from conference room A. In the present example, the broadband connection<br>
245 may comprise, for example, a connection via an IP network or ISDN line.<br>
The conference connection 245 may comprise a video channel, an audio<br>
channel, a control channel, and a Bluetooth channel.<br>
[0043] Various layers of the video conferencing unit 250, including radio layer 252,<br>
hardware layer 254, HCI layer 256, L2CAP layer 258, other Bluetooth stack<br>
components 260, and application layer 262 are depicted in Figure 2.<br>
Additional layers may be included, such as those as described in the Bluetooth<br>
specification, but are not illustrated for purposes of simplicity.<br>
[0044] A network interface 264 is linked to the HCI layer 256 via channel 266. In<br>
accordance with the present embodiment, channel 266 may comprise a<br>
proprietary RTP channel for sending and receiving Bluetooth data. The<br>
network interface 264 may operate according to the H.323 standard for audio,<br>
video, and data communications across IP-based networks, including the<br>
Internet. The network interface 264 may also operate according to the H.320<br>
standard for ISDN video conferencing. The network interface 264 may also<br>
operate according to other standards and protocols, whether currently known<br>
or later developed.<br>
[0045] The video conferencing unit 250 in conference room B is capable of<br>
establishing a radio-frequency PAN with various Bluetooth-enabled devices in<br>
conference room B. In the present example, the Bluetooth-enabled devices in<br>
the PAN in conference room B include a personal computer 270 (such as a<br>
handheld PC or a laptop PC, etc.) and a PDA 280.<br>
	***	&gt;-f*	»-W*<br>
[0046] Once a conference is connected, such as, for example, an H.323 or H.320<br>
video conference, the VCUs 200 and -250 exchange data pertaining to their<br>
respective capabilities.   For example, VCU 200 may communicate that it is<br>
Page 12 of 26<br><br>
able to send and receive video, audio, and Bluetooth data, and VCU 250 may<br>
also communicate that it is able to send and receive video, audio, and<br>
Bluetooth data.<br>
[0047] Following the capabilities exchange, the act of device identification (also<br>
referred to as device discovery) is performed. Each of the VCUs 200 and 250<br>
performs a radio scan both locally and remotely, and the results are collected<br>
and exchanged. Therefore, in the example of Figure 2, VCU 200 discovers<br>
local devices (printer 220, PDA 230, and cellular telephone 240) and remote<br>
devices (PC 270 and PDA 280); VCU 250 discovers local devices (PC 270<br>
and PDA 280) and remote devices (printer 220, PDA 230, and cellular<br>
telephone 240). All such devices (printer 220, PDA 230, cellular telephone<br>
240, PC 270, and PDA 280) appear as if they are in the same room and in the<br>
same radio network. Each device has an address (e.g., a network address, etc.)<br>
and a set of attributes (e.g., what Bluetooth profile is supported such as<br>
headset profile, data exchange profile, etc.).<br>
[0048] In one exemplary illustration of the principles of the present invention, PDA<br>
230 in conference room A and PDA 280 in conference room B can perform an<br>
RS232 data exchange and thereby exchange contact information in the form of<br>
electronic business cards via connection 245. The data exchange occurs as if<br>
they were in the same physical piconet, even though their respective physical<br>
locations may be hundreds or thousands of miles apart.<br>
[0049] A method for exchanging contact information between Bluetooth PDAs may<br>
be performed as follows. First, the PDAs each search for like devices. Next,<br>
a connection is established between the PDAs, such as PDA 230 and PDA 280<br>
of Figure 2. The data including the electronic business card data (which may<br>
be, for example, stored in vCard or text format) is transmitted pursuant to the<br>
	device profiles-An application implementing the exchange of such data may<br>
be based on the Object Push profile specified in Bluetooth vl.l profiles.<br>
Finally, the connection is closed.<br>
Page 13 of 26<br><br>
[0050] In another exemplary illustration of the principles of the present invention, a<br>
conference participant can directly dial a video number or a phone number<br>
from his or her PDA 230, PDA 280, or cellular telephone 240, etc. Users<br>
often store address books and contact information in their PDAs and cellular<br>
telephones. Allowing users to directly dial such numbers advantageously<br>
allows users to keep their contact information in a central repository.<br>
[0051] A method for directly dialing a number from a wireless device such as a<br>
Bluetooth PDA may be performed as follows. First, a conference participant<br>
dials a video or audio number stored in the directory of his or her PDA, such<br>
as PDA 230 of Figure 2. The video conferencing unit 200 includes a phone<br>
driver. The PDA 230 connects to the video conferencing unit 200 and sends<br>
the number over the Bluetooth link 216 to the video conferencing unit 200,<br>
which subsequently dials the number.<br>
[0052] In another exemplary illustration of the principles of the present invention,<br>
conference participants can synchronize a set of data such as address books or<br>
calendars stored in their wireless devices. An application implementing the<br>
synchronization of such address book or calendar data may be based on the<br>
Object Synchronization Profile specified in Bluetooth vl.l Profiles.<br>
[0053] In another exemplary illustration of the principles of the present invention,<br>
conference participants may engage in collaborative drawing. For example, a<br>
near-end user may draw on his or her PDA and share the drawing with the far<br>
end. An application implementing the drawing collaboration is developed on<br>
top of the SDK (software development kit) of the specific PDA being used<br>
and is based on the particular profile the SDK uses.<br>
[0054] In another exemplary illustration of the principles of the present invention, an<br>
audio phone call can be added into a video conference.   The conferencing<br>
tation, such as VCU 200, includes a built-in POTS-like audio port, for a<br>
Bluetooth cell phone, such as cellular telephone 240. The conferencing<br>
station acts as a Bluetooth headset, while the Bluetooth cell phone acts as an<br>
Page 14 of 26<br><br>
audio gateway. An application implementing this feature can be based on the<br>
Headset Profile (or Handsfree Profile) specified in Bluetooth vl .1 Profiles.<br>
[0055] In another exemplary illustration of the principles of the present invention, a<br>
conference participant can draw on a whiteboard to show his or her idea to<br>
other conference participants. Instead of moving the video camera to point to<br>
the whiteboard or using a wired whiteboard, the image can be sent wirelessly<br>
to the VCU, which then transfers the image to the far end and displays the<br>
drawing on a display device. Thus, a Bluetooth whiteboard may join the PAN<br>
in conference room A, and drawings on the Bluetooth whiteboard may be<br>
viewed on a monitor in remotely located conference room B. An application<br>
implementing this feature can be based on the Serial Port Profile and<br>
developed on top of the particular whiteboard vendor's SDK.<br>
[0056] In another exemplary illustration of the principles of the present invention, a<br>
conference participant may draw a diagram on a piece of paper using a<br>
Bluetooth pen such as that licensed by Anoto. A Bluetooth pen captures the<br>
image, and sends it over the Bluetooth link to the video conference unit. An<br>
application implementing this feature can be based on Anoto's SDK.<br>
[0057] In another exemplary illustration of the principles of the present invention, a<br>
more user-friendly way is provided for navigating UI (user interface) items or<br>
receiving user input by using a Bluetooth-enabled mouse and keyboard. An<br>
application implementing this feature may be based on the HID (human<br>
interface device) profile specified in Bluetooth vl.l Profiles.<br>
[0058] In another exemplary illustration of the principles of the present invention,<br>
audio data can be transferred wirelessly from a Bluetooth-enabled microphone<br>
to the VCU base station. Whereas a traditional micpod is wire-connected to<br>
the base station, which makes room integration harder, a wireless micpod may<br>
#-*•■	*-t*	&gt;-t*<br>
instead be used. An application implementing this feature can be based on a<br>
proprietary protocol to achieve the highest data throughput out of the<br>
Bluetooth link 216.<br>
Page 15 of 26<br><br>
[0059] In another exemplary illustration of the principles of the present invention, an<br>
application running on the VCU provides the ability to print files such as<br>
documents, slides, and business cards, etc. from the far end during a<br>
conference. For example, a document stored on personal computer 270 in<br>
conference room B can be printed at printer 220 in remotely located<br>
conference room A. The application implementing this feature can be based<br>
on one or more of the following profiles which provide Bluetooth printing<br>
functionalities: Basic Printing Profile, Hardcopy Cable Replacement Profile,<br>
Basic Imaging Profile, PAN profile, Object Push Profile, or Serial Port<br>
Profile, etc., depending on the particular printer.<br>
[0060] In another exemplary illustration of the principles of the present invention, the<br>
above-described applications, e.g., synchronization, collaboration, etc., may be<br>
combined depending on what application you have on your PC. Windows®<br>
and Mac OS provide some Bluetooth support. Applications can be based on<br>
the OS support and profiles, or used with third-party applications.<br>
[0061] Figure 3 depicts a block diagram of an exemplary video conferencing unit<br>
according to one embodiment of the invention. The video conferencing unit<br>
comprises a media processor 310 in data communication with an interface 320<br>
comprised of a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Bluetooth module<br>
330 is connected to antenna board 340 for RF communication and to interface<br>
320 for data communication. A high-speed serial link may be used to connect<br>
Bluetooth module 330 and interface 320. Bluetooth module 330 comprises<br>
software and code for communicating according to the Bluetooth<br>
specification. Bluetooth module 330 may comprise software for<br>
implementing any of the above-described applications for business card<br>
exchange, direct dialing, data synchronization, drawing collaboration, adding<br>
an audio call, Bluetooth whiteboard transmission, Bluetooth pen imaging,<br>
Bluetooth user inputs, wireless microphones, wireless printing, and wireless<br>
PC applications, among others.  In other embodiments, communications .may<br>
Page 16 of 26<br><br>
be carried out according to a different standard or protocol, such as UWB,<br>
802.11, IR, or other wireless communication specification.<br>
[0062] Various components shown in Figure 3 may be external to the video<br>
conferencing unit. For example, one or more of the cameras, monitors,<br>
microphones, speakers, and sub-woofer may be external to the video<br>
conferencing unit.<br>
[0063] While the present invention has been described with respect to a limited<br>
number of embodiments, those skilled in the art will appreciate numerous<br>
modifications and variations therefrom. It is intended that the appended<br>
claims cover all such modifications and variations as fall within the true spirit<br>
