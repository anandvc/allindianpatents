HORIZONTAL GRINDING-TYPE RICE MILLING MACHINE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a horizontal grinding-type rice polishing (milling)<br>
machine in which a feeding roller, a grinding roller and a discharging roller are circularly<br>
and fixedly installed on a horizontal rotation axis from one end side to the other end side,<br>
and the grinding roller is covered with a bran removing screen of concentric cylindrical<br>
shape to form a rice polishing room, whereby unpolished rice supplied by the feeding<br>
roller is polished in the rice polishing room and discharged from the discharging roller as<br>
polished rice.<br>
Background Art<br>
A horizontal grinding-type rice polishing machine which is so configured that a feeding<br>
roller, (a plurality of) grinding rollers and a discharging roller are circularly and fixedly<br>
installed on a horizontal rotation axis from one end side to the other end side, and the<br>
grinding roller is covered with a bran removing screen of concentric cylindrical shape to<br>
form a rice polishing room, whereby unpolished rice supplied by the feeding roller is<br>
polished in the rice polishing room and discharged from the discharging roller as polished<br>
rice has been conventionally known in the art.<br>
In the rice polishing machine of the above configuration, unpolished rice is delivered<br>
from an unpolished rice hopper and fed into the rice polishing room through a spiral<br>
groove formed on the outer periphery of the feeding roller. In the rice polishing room,<br>
rice being polished or rice after polished (hereinafter, "rice" in the rice polishing room<br>
refers to the rice in mixed state of unpolished rice, rice being polished and rice after<br>
polished) is pushed out to the discharging roller as a result of being pushed by the<br>
unpolished rice which is successively fed by the feeding roller, and finally pushed into a<br>
polished rice outlet from the discharging roller.<br>
It is requested that polishing degree of polished rice is adjusted in accordance with the<br>
intended polishing degree, and in accordance with the type of the rice, and the polishing<br>
degree can be adjusted by changing the residence time, the loading amount and the<br>
passage in the rice polishing room.<br>
As a means for appropriately setting the residence time and loading amount in the rice<br>
polishing room, a stopper for restricting passage by preventing flow of the rice or a flap<br>
for controlling the flow rate is conventionally provided along the inner peripheral surface<br>
of the bran removing screen. The stopper is fixedly provided on the inner peripheral<br>
surface of the bran removing screen so as to make the gap with respect to the grinding<br>
roller extremely small thereby preventing the rice from flowing and guiding the rice to the<br>
region where a stopper is not provided, and thus restricting the passage. The flap<br>
narrows the gap with respect to the grinding roller to some degree, thereby controlling the<br>
flow rate of the rice in the gap. That is, according to the conventional measure, the<br>
loading amount and the flow rate (residence time) of the rice in the rice polishing room<br>
are adjusted by making the flap variable or enabling manual changing of its angle by an<br>
operator.<br>
However, such a variable-type flap applied along the circumferential direction of the<br>
bran removing screen cannot be so long. That is, such a flap cannot be effective along<br>
the substantially entire circumference of the bran removing screen, so that there is a<br>
limitation in equalizing distribution of rice in the rice polishing room. This made the<br>
structure of the bran removing screen complicated.<br>
Also, though a structure in which a fixed-type flap is fixedly provided on the inner<br>
peripheral surface of the bran removing screen in the same manner as the stopper is also<br>
adopted in combination with the variable flap, since the bran removing screen itself is<br>
essentially fixedly provided and cannot be modulated in accordance with the type of the<br>
rice or the intended polishing degree, the position of the fixed-type flap is also fixed and<br>
there is a case that a desired polishing degree cannot be achieved.<br>
As another means for adjusting the polishing degree, a structure of adjusting free<br>
opening of an outlet of polished rice is known. That is, at an outlet of polished rice, a<br>
shutter having a pushing force against the flow direction of polished rice is provided, and<br>
free opening of the shutter is adjusted. The narrower the free opening, the higher the<br>
polishing degree becomes because of increase of the residence time in the rice polishing<br>
room.<br>
However, if the free opening is controlled as described above, the polishing efficiency<br>
is deteriorated on the other hand. That is, as a result of decreasing the discharge amount<br>
of the polished rice per unit time, longer time is required for obtaining the intended<br>
amount of polished rice.<br>
Yet another problem associated with the conventional horizontal grinding-type rice<br>
polishing machine is that since the spiral groove of the feeding roller is formed as one<br>
groove from the initial end surface to the terminal end surface of the roller, the pressure of<br>
the unpolished rice to be discharged into the rice polishing room from the outlet end of<br>
the groove concentrates at one point under rotation, and rotation of the pressure<br>
concentrated point may cause vibration of axial center of the rotation axis. Furthermore,<br>
in association with that the degree of pressure application on the rice polishing room in<br>
one rotation varies depending on arrangement of the stopper and flap provided nearest to<br>
the inlet in the rice polishing room and opposing to the terminal end surface of the feeding<br>
roller, vibration occurs in the grinding roller, which results in unequal rice polishing or<br>
adversely affects on the durability of parts.<br>
Furthermore, in assembling the grinding roller and discharging roller on the rotation<br>
axis, the assembly is proceeded in the manner that first the feeding roller is assembled on<br>
the rotation axis while cantilevering the inlet end side of the rotation axis, and thereafter<br>
the center hole of each grinding roller is passed on the rotation axis to be slid to a<br>
predetermined position in sequence. However, as the grinding rollers are assembled to<br>
the rotation axis, the part of the outlet side end is downwardly inclined because of the<br>
weight of the grinding rollers. This causes the assembled grinding rollers to slide toward<br>
the outlet side end and come off, and also causes a trouble in assembling additional<br>
grinding roller to a predetermined position.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a horizontal grinding-type rice polishing machine<br>
which is so configured that a feeding roller, a grinding roller and a discharging roller are<br>
circularly and fixedly installed on a horizontal rotation axis from one end side to the other<br>
end side, and the grinding roller is covered with a concentric cylindrical bran removing<br>
screen to form a rice polishing room, whereby unpolished rice supplied by the feeding<br>
roller is polished in the rice polishing room and discharged from the discharging roller,<br>
and the first object of the invention is to configure adjusting members for adjusting<br>
loading amount and residence time of rice in the rice polishing room that is attached<br>
inside the bran removing screen with simple and effective structures.<br>
In order to achieve this object, according to the present invention, a stopper or a flap is<br>
fixedly provided on an inner peripheral surface of each of the two-part split screen halves<br>
of the bran removing screen, the stopper or the flap being formed by a circular arc<br>
member which curves along the circumference of a circular cross section perpendicular to<br>
the axial center of the cylinder, so that between the flap and the outer periphery of the<br>
grinding roller, a distance that allows passing of rice while restricting passing amount is<br>
secured, and a distance between the stopper and the outer periphery of the grinding roller<br>
prevents the rice from flowing.<br>
Therefore, it becomes possible to achieve sufficient loading of unpolished rice and<br>
residence time in the rice polishing space by means of a fixed-type stopper and flap with<br>
simple structure without providing a movable flap inside the bran removing screen as is<br>
the conventional case.<br>
Also, position of a joint surface between the screen halves of the bran removing screen<br>
is variable in the circumferential direction about the rotation axis, whereby the position of<br>
the stopper or flap attached to each screen half is made changeable in the circumferential<br>
direction about the rotation axis. For example, by making it possible to arrange the joint<br>
surface in horizontal position and in vertical position, it is possible to prepare two types of<br>
bran removing screens, that is, the bran removing screen configured by jointing the screen<br>
halves one on another, and the bran removing screen configured by jointing the screen<br>
halves side to side. As a result of this, the flow passage of rice in the rice polishing<br>
room is changed with regard to the circumferential direction of the bran removing screen,<br>
and moreover, relative positions of the stopper and the flap with respect to the unpolished<br>
rice outlet in the upstream side feeding roller and the discharging roller and polished rice<br>
outlet on the downstream side of the rice polishing room are changed in the<br>
circumferential direction about the rotation axis. Therefore, delivery of rice in the rice<br>
polishing room and introduction of unpolished rice to the rice polishing room and<br>
discharge of polished rice from the rice polishing room can be optimized, resulting that<br>
the rice polishing performance is improved.<br>
In the case where it is desired to change the polishing degree in accordance with the<br>
type or property of the unpolished rice, by preparing several types of screen halves having<br>
different attaching positions and shapes (thickness and the like) of the stopper and flap<br>
prepared, and forming the bran removing screen while selecting and combining arbitrary<br>
two types among these types, it is possible to comply with various types and properties of<br>
unpolished rice.<br>
Furthermore, the screen halves of the bran removing screen have the same structure,<br>
and are so configured that when the respective ends in the axial direction are inverted, the<br>
stopper and the flap are inverted, and in the rice polishing machine, at least one screen<br>
half can be arranged so that the respective ends in the axial direction are inverted.<br>
As described above, it is possible to configure two types of bran removing screens each<br>
having different setting of loading amount and residence time in accordance with the type<br>
or the like of unpolished rice by preparing two screen halves having the same structure, so<br>
that a horizontal grinding-type rice polishing machine having many conforming variations<br>
can be provided with low cost.<br>
In each of the screen halves having the same structure, the total of even number of the<br>
stopper and the flap are attached so that they align alternately in the axial direction.<br>
For example, assumption is made for the case that the bran removing screen is formed<br>
by jointing the screen halves one on the other, the upper screen half is made invertible as<br>
described above, and as for the lower screen half, the member nearest to the inlet side end<br>
is a stopper and the member nearest to the outlet side end is a flap.<br>
When the member nearest to the inlet side end is a flap and the member nearest to the<br>
outlet side end is a stopper, in the upper screen half, all of combinations of stopper or flap<br>
arranged opposing to each other in the vertical direction while interposing each grinding<br>
roller therebetween are combination of stopper and flap. Incidentally, the vertical<br>
position of the flap and the stopper is transposed sequentially from the inlet side end. In<br>
this bran removing screen, most of rice blocked by each stopper flows to the outlet side<br>
via each flap.<br>
When the upper screen half is inverted, and the member nearest to the inlet side end is<br>
a stopper and the member nearest to the outlet side end is a flap, combinations of stopper<br>
or flap opposing to each other while interposing each grinding roller in the bran removing<br>
screen are such that combination of upper stopper and lower stopper and combination of<br>
upper flap and lower flap are alternately repeated in sequence from the inlet side end.<br>
Since the part where the stoppers are arranged on the upper and lower sides is configured,<br>
the flow passage of rice is extremely narrowed. The bran removing screen may be<br>
configured as described above when it is required to set the loading amount of rice and<br>
residence time in the rice polishing room higher.<br>
The second object of the invention is to provide a structure capable of smoothly<br>
discharging polished rice in accordance with closing degree of outlet when a measure of<br>
changing loading amount and residence time of rice in the rice polishing room by<br>
changing free opening (closing degree of outlet) is adopted.<br>
For achieving this object, a primary outlet having a shutter of which free opening is<br>
adjustable and a secondary outlet not having the shutter are provided, and by adjusting the<br>
free opening of the shutter, the polished rice is discharged from the primary outlet under<br>
low polishing degree condition, from the secondary outlet under high polishing degree<br>
condition and from the primary outlet and the secondary outlet under intermediate<br>
polishing degree condition.<br>
Therefore, by adjusting residence time and loading amount of rice in the rice polishing<br>
room by adjustment of free opening of the shutter, it is possible to smoothly discharge rice<br>
of high polishing degree from the secondary outlet even when the closing degree is<br>
increased, while having the structure of changing the polishing degree. On the other<br>
hand, when it is requested to obtain rice of low polishing degree, the opening degree of<br>
the shutter is increase, thereby discharging such rice immediately from the primary outlet.<br>
In such a configuration, by proving the secondary outlet at higher position than the<br>
primary outlet, it is possible to discharge rice of high polishing degree from the secondary<br>
outlet in responding to increase of level of the rice that is not discharged from the primary<br>
outlet and hence filled in the rice polishing room when the closing degree of the shutter is<br>
increased.<br>
Furthermore, when the secondary outlet for high polishing degree is provided in<br>
duplicate, it is possible to further increase the polishing degree by selectively closing one<br>
of the outlet and elongating the residence time in the rice polishing room, and it is<br>
possible to increase polishing efficiency by using both of the outlets.<br>
Furthermore, by providing the two secondary outlets are provided in the form of pair<br>
disposed left and right when viewed in the direction of the rotation axis, it is possible to<br>
guide the rice discharged from the secondary outlets to the polished rice discharging<br>
trough while making the rice hinder the rotation axis and drop smoothly and equally<br>
leftward and rightward without retention.<br>
Furthermore, the third object of the present invention is, in a horizontal grinding-type<br>
rice polishing machine having a structure that unpolished rice is drawn into a spiral<br>
groove formed on the circumference of the feeding roller from an unpolished rice hopper;<br>
unpolished rice is supplied inside the rice polishing room from an outlet end of the spiral<br>
groove by means of rotation of the feeding roller, to eliminate deviation of supply of<br>
unpolished rice from the feeding roller to the rice polishing room, thereby preventing<br>
occurrence of vibration of the rotation axis.<br>
In order to achieve this object, according to the present invention, a parr of spiral<br>
grooves of the feeding roller is formed with a phase shift of 180° in the circumferential<br>
direction of the feeding roller. As a result of this, it is possible to feed the unpolished<br>
rice in well-dispersed condition from the feeding roller to the rice polishing room, so that<br>
the rotation axis is prevented from vibrating and vibration does not occur during rotation<br>
of the grinding roller, with the result that uniform rice polishing is secured and durability<br>
of parts is improved.<br>
Furthermore, the fourth object of the present invention is to provide a structure for<br>
supporting the rotation axis in horizontal position so that when the grinding roller and the<br>
discharging roller are assembled on the rotation axis, the cantilevered rotation axis will<br>
not be inclined due to weight of the fitted grinding rollers and the like.<br>
In order to achieve this object, according to the present invention, a case for<br>
accommodating the feeding roller has a lifter latching block, and the rotation axis is<br>
supported in horizontal position by inserting the lifter latching block between the feeding<br>
roller that has been attached on the rotation axis and the bearing support which cantilevers<br>
the rotation axis in installing the grinding roller and the discharging roller on the rotation<br>
axis.<br>
As a result of this, the rotation axis will not be inclined until the rotation axis is inserted<br>
into each of the grinding rollers and discharging roller and each of the grinding rollers and<br>
discharging roller are slid to predetermined positions on the rotation axis to be fitted<br>
therewith, so that the grinding rollers having fitted with the axis will not go off, and hence<br>
assembling operation of the grinding rollers and discharging roller on the rotation axis can<br>
be conducted readily and smoothly.<br>
Furthermore, the bearing support is formed with a recess portion nearest the position<br>
where the lifter latching block is to be positioned for horizontally supporting the rotation<br>
axis, and the lifter latching block not being used is fitted in the recess portion. That is,<br>
during when it lifting and supporting of the rotation axis is not required, the block is<br>
placed on the bearing support at the position where the block will not prevent rotation of<br>
rotation axis and feeding roller, in the case of detaching the grinding roller or discharging<br>
roller from the rotation axis because of maintenance and the like, the detaching operation<br>
can be smoothly conducted because the block is placed near the setting position.<br>

4.<br>
On a lower supporting frame 20, an inlet side supporting panel (front panel) 12 and an<br>
outlet side supporting panel (rear panel) 13 are fixedly provided in standing manner while<br>
10<br>
leaving a fore-and-aft span therebetween, and a cylindrical rice polishing unit cover 22 is<br>
interposed between the inlet side supporting panel 12 and the outlet side supporting panel<br>
13. Hereinafter, unless otherwise specified, the present machine will be explained<br>
provided that the side of the outlet side supporting panel 13 (left side in Fig. 1) is the front<br>

from polished rice outlets 6a and 6b formed in a polished rice outlet member 6 which is<br>
fixedly provided on the outlet side supporting panel 13 and will be described later,<br>
thereby causing the adjusting connecting rod 26 or 27 to advance or retract in the<br>
fore-and-aft direction to open/close the opening/closing shutter 29 or to adjust the opening<br>
of the fine-adjusting shutter 28, thus achieving adjustment of the flow amount of<br>
unpolished from the unpolished rice hopper 14.<br>
A grinding roller shaft 10 which is a rotation axis is horizontally journaled between the<br>
inlet side supporting panel 12 and the outlet side supporting panel 13 while being covered<br>
with the rice polishing unit cover 22. In the working example of Fig. 1, a feeding roller<br>
5, six grinding rollers 1, a discharging roller 9 and an end portion clamping screw 35 are<br>
fitted on the grinding roller shaft 10.<br>
The feeding roller 5 is arranged in the feeding roller case 11, and in the rice polishing<br>
unit cover 22, the six grinding roller 1, the discharging roller 9 and the end portion<br>
claming screw 35 are arranged in this order toward the outlet side supporting panel 13.<br>
Furthermore, the six grinding rollers 1 and the discharging roller 9 are covered with a<br>
bran removing screen S cylindrically interposed between the inlet side supporting panel<br>
12 and the outlet side supporting panel 13 within the rice polishing unit cover 22. In this<br>
way, the rice polishing unit is formed between the inlet side supporting panel 12 and the<br>
outlet side supporting panel 13.<br>
Arrangement of the grinding roller shaft 10, and procedure of assembling the feeding<br>
roller 5, the grinding rollers 1, the discharging roller 9 and the end portion clamping<br>
screw 35 on the grinding roller shaft 10 will be explained with the use of Figs. 1, 5, 6 and<br>
the like.<br>
First, the inlet side supporting panel 12 and the outlet side supporting panel 13 are<br>
fixedly provided on the lower supporting frame 20 in standing manner, and the feeding<br>
roller case 11 is fixedly provided on the inlet side supporting panel 12 as described above,<br>
and then a bearing cover 34 for wrapping a bearing 36 is fixedly provided on the outside<br>
end (rear end) of the feeding roller case 11.<br>
From this state, the grinding roller shaft 10 is inserted into axial holes of the bearing 36<br>
and the bearing cover 34 attached to the feeding roller case 11 from front side via a<br>
polished rice discharging opening 13a of the outlet side supporting panel 13 (see Figs. 1,<br>
16 and 17), and a step of the grinding roller shaft 10 is brought into contact with the<br>
bearing 36.<br>
The grinding roller shaft 10 thus positioned in the axial direction protrudes behind the<br>
bearing 36, that is, protrudes on the opposite side to the polished rice discharging side,<br>
and an input pulley 23 for receiving engine power and a bran removing fan driving pulley<br>
24 for driving a bran removing fan 41 as will be described later are circularly installed<br>
and fixed to this protruded portion as weights. Under the condition that the rear end part<br>
of the grinding roller shaft 10 is weighed, the constituents of the rice polishing unit as<br>
described above are sequentially slid from the front end part of the polished rice outlet<br>
side along the grinding roller shaft 10 and latched after being positioned.<br>
Among the constituents of the rice polishing unit to be assembled on the grinding roller<br>
shaft 10, first, the grinding roller shaft 10 is penetrated in the center hole of the feeding<br>
roller 5, the feeding roller 5 is slid backward along the grinding roller shaft 10, and in the<br>
state of being in contact with the step provided in the grinding roller shaft 10, the feeding<br>
roller 5 is latched to the grinding roller shaft 10 via a key so as to disable relative rotation.<br>
In the condition that the feeding roller 5 is fitted to the grinding roller shaft 10 in the<br>
feeding roller case 11, the remainder of the constituents of the rice polishing unit, that is,<br>
the six grinding rollers 1, the one discharging roller 9 are fitted from the polished rice<br>
outlet side. In this operation, if the grinding roller shaft 10 is inclined frontward and<br>
downward because of the weight of the grinding rollers 1 sequentially assembled, it is no<br>
longer possible to easily slide the grinding rollers 1 and the discharging roller 9 having<br>
passed through the grinding roller shaft 10 to the respective predetermined positions, and<br>
even if such rollers are latched by means of keys, they will come off again. In view of<br>
this, as shown by the imaginary lines in Figs. 1 and 5, a lifter latching block 8 is<br>
interposed between the lower end of the feeding roller 5 and the bottom surface of the<br>
roller case 11, thereby supporting the grinding roller shaft 10 together with the feeding<br>
roller 5 from below.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, the lifter latching block 8 is arranged in a vertically penetrating<br>
hole 15 provide in the bottom portion of the feeding roller case 11 in the normal condition,<br>
and fixed by screw to a closing rid 16 disposed beneath the same by means of a<br>
hold-functioning bolt with nut 8a. Furthermore, the closing rid 16 is clamped to the<br>
feeding roller case 11 by means of a bolt 51. In this way in the case where it is not<br>
necessary to interpose the lifter latching block 8 under the feeding roller 5, such as during<br>
normal rice polishing operation, the lifter latching block 8 is arranged in the hole 15 while<br>
being attached inside the closing rid 16 to form a part of the feeding roller case 11.<br>
And, when attaching/detaching the grinding rollers 1 to/from the grinding roller shaft<br>
10, the lifter latching block 8 is separated from the closing rid 16 by removing the nut<br>
from the hold-functioning bolt 8a, and as shown by the imaginary line in Fig. 5, the lifter<br>
latching block 8 is inserted into an inlet bearing support 11 and moved, to be inserted<br>
between the bottom surface of the feeding roller 5 and the inner surface of the feeding<br>
roller case 11. At this time, the operator can easily move the lifter latching block 8 while<br>
holding the hold-functioning bolt 8a, and since the hold-functioning bolt 8a exists in the<br>
hole 15, the lifter latching block 8 does not exceedingly enters the interior.<br>
As described above, by supporting the feeding roller 5 by interposing the lifter latching<br>
block 8 between the feeding roller 5 and the feeding roller case 11, it is possible to hold<br>
the grinding roller shaft 10 in substantially horizontal position, and it is possible to easily<br>
and reliably slide each grinding roller 1 and the discharging roller 9 to the respective<br>
predetermined positions on the grinding roller shaft 10 and latched with keys until the last<br>
end portion clamping screw 35 is fitted on the grinding roller shaft 10.<br>
Each grinding roller 1 having been slid to a predetermined position on the grinding<br>
roller shaft 10 is latched so as to disable rotation relative to the grinding roller shaft 10,<br>
and after finishing fitting of all of the grinding rollers 1, the discharging roller 9 is fitted<br>
on the grinding roller shaft 10. Then, in this state, the feeding roller 5, the grinding<br>
rollers 1, the discharging roller 9 are slid toward the polished rice outlet side and fixed by<br>
clamping so as not to come off the grinding roller shaft 10 by screwing the end clamping<br>
screw 35 on the grinding roller shaft 10. Furthermore, the polished rice outlet member 6<br>
is attached and fixed to the outlet side supporting panel 13 while inserting the grinding<br>
roller shaft 10 in an axial hole 6c of the polished rice outlet member 6, and a bearing<br>
cover 33 is fixedly provided on the polished rice outlet member 6 while fitting the front<br>
end portion of the grinding roller shaft 10 in an axial hole of the bearing cover 33 which<br>
wraps a bearing 37. In this way, assembly of constituents of the rice polishing unit to be<br>
assemble to the grinding roller shaft 10 completes.<br>
After that, two screen halves 2 of half-split cylindrical shape as shown in Figs. 7 and 8<br>
are arranged around the grinding roller 1, and joint flanges 2a which are formed at the<br>
outer peripheral ends of the screen halves 2 so as to parallel to the axial center are jointed<br>
and clamped with each other, thereby forming a single cylindrical bran removing screen as shown in Figs. 4, 9 and the like. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1, on an inlet side<br>
opening end and an outlet side opening end of the bran removing screen S, the inlet side<br>
supporting panel 12 and the outlet side supporting panel 13 are fixed respectively,<br>
whereby the bran removing screen S is interposed between the supporting panels 12 and<br>
13 provided in the fore-and-aft direction. In this way, an approximately circular rice<br>
polishing unit is formed between the cylindrical bran removing screen S and the grinding<br>
rollers 1.<br>
In the present rice polishing machine, as shown in Figs. 9,10 and the like, the position<br>
where the joint flanges 2a of the respective screen halves 2 are jointed with each other<br>
may be such that the screen halves 2 are arranged one on the other while interposing a<br>
horizontal joint surface J therebetween, or may be such that, as shown in Fig. 4, the joint<br>
surface J is vertically arranged and the screen halves 2 are arranged on the left and right<br>
sides of the joint surface J. As described above, by rotationally moving the position of<br>
the screen halves 2 (position of the joint flanges 2a) about the grinding roller shaft 10, it is<br>
possible to change the positions of a stopper 3 and a flap 4 fixedly provided on the bran<br>
removing screen S as will be described later about the grinding roller shaft 10. Details<br>
of which will be described later.<br>
Furthermore, after interposing the above-described adjusting connecting rods 26 and 27<br>
between inlet side supporting panel 12 and the outlet side supporting panel 13 above the<br>
bran removing screen S, the rice polishing unit cover 22 is interposed between the inlet<br>
side supporting panel 12 and the outlet side supporting panel 13 so as to cover the bran<br>
removing screen S and the adjusting connecting rods 26 and 27, whereby assembling of<br>
the rice polishing unit is almost completed.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, inside the lower supporting frame 20 is provided a funnel-shape<br>
bran collecting trough 21. During rice polishing operation, bran drops from the rice<br>
polishing room formed between the grinding rollers 1 and the bran removing screen S via<br>
a slit 2b of the bran removing screen S (see Fig. 7 and the like) to be collected in the bran<br>
collecting trough 21.<br>
Also, in the rear part of the feeding roller case 11, a bran removing air duct lla is<br>
formed, under which a bran removing fan case 40 wrapping the bran removing fan 41 is<br>
provided, and a blowing duct opening directed upwardly of the bran removing fan case 40<br>
is jointed with the lower end inlet of the bran removing air duct lla. With such a<br>
configuration, the air generated by the bran removing fan 41 is introduced into the hollow<br>
feeding roller 5 within the feeding roller case 11 via the bran removing air duct lla, and<br>
further introduced into the grinding roller 1 along the grinding roller shaft 10.<br>
Furthermore, a grinding stone la provided on the outer periphery of each grinding roller 1<br>
is appropriately formed with blow passage Ib communicating inside and outside the<br>
grinding roller 1 as a notch as shown in Figs. 1, 4 and the like, and the air from the bran<br>
removing fan 41 having been introduced into the grinding roller 1 is blown into the rice<br>
polishing room as bran removing air from inside the grinding roller 1, thereby discharged<br>
the bran into the bran collecting trough 21 via the slit 2b of the bran removing screen S<br>
from the rice polishing room.<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 and 3, power is transmitted from the fan driving pulley 24 fixedly<br>
provided on the grinding roller shaft 10 to the fan input pulley 25 attached to the bran<br>
removing fan 41 via a belt 43, whereby the bran removing fan 41 is rotationally driven.<br>
For the purpose of adjusting the tension of the belt 43, a tension pulley 42 is attached on<br>
the rear surface of the upper part of the bran removing fan case 40 so as to allow position<br>
change in the left-and-light direction.<br>
Next, arrangement and configuration of the stopper 3 and the flap 4 attached on the<br>
inner peripheral surface of the bran removing screen S shown in Figs. 7 to 11 will be<br>
explained.<br>
The bran removing screen S can be split longitudinally into the two screen halves 2 of<br>
half-split cylindrical shape according to the aforementioned configuration. On the inner<br>
peripheral surface of each screen half 2, as shown in Figs. 7, 8 and the like, a plurality of<br>
stoppers 3 and flaps 4 are fixedly provided in parallel by spot welding in the<br>
circumferential direction thereof (in the direction of circular arc of the circular cross<br>
section perpendicular to the grinding roller shaft 10). Other possibility is to configure<br>
the screen half 2 to which only the stoppers 3 are attached or the screen half 2 to which<br>
only the flaps 4 are attached.<br>
The flap 4 is a flat and slim plate member, and the stopper 3 is a slim plate member<br>
having an L-shaped cross section which is bent in a circular arc shape along the<br>
circumferential direction of the cross section of each screen half 2.<br>
The distance between the inner peripheral surface of the bran removing screen S and<br>
the outer peripheral surface of the grinding roller 1 is about 8.5 mm. The thickness of<br>
the flap 4 is about 1.6 mm, and hence a gap of about 6.9 mm arises between the flap 4 and<br>
the inner peripheral surface of the bran removing screen S, which becomes resistance for<br>
rice flowing in the rice polishing room. That is, the flap 4 restricts flow amount of the<br>
rice, though it does not have a blocking power that completely blocks flow of the rice.<br>
In this way, it is possible to adjust the passing time and the residence time of the rice in<br>
the rice polishing room.<br>
On the other hand, the thickness of the stopper 3 is about 7.5 mm, and hence a gap of<br>
only about 1 mm thick arises with respect to the inner peripheral surface of the bran<br>
removing screen S. Such a small gap prevents almost all of the rice from passing<br>
therethrough, so that the rice cannot move from the inlet side to the outlet side unless it<br>
keeps away from the stopper 3 in the rice polishing room. That is, the stopper 3 has a<br>
function of changing the passage of the rice.<br>
Both the stopper 3 and the flap 4 provide a certain distance between the respective ends<br>
and the respective joint flanges 2a of the screen halves 2 in their longitudinal direction,<br>
thereby keeping a gap of about 8.5 mm thick for allowing passage of the rice as described<br>
above. Referring to Fig. 9, the distance between each end of the stopper 3 and the flange<br>
2a is set to be a half of G2 (for example, about 85 mm), and the distance between each<br>
end of the flap 4 and the flange 2a is set to be a half of G3 (for example, about 60 mm).<br>
As for the stopper 3 and the flap 4 within the bran removing screen S, various<br>
arrangements can be considered. First, in the present working example, as described<br>
above, the position of each of the screen halves 2 to be jointed with each other can be<br>
changed so that they surround the grinding roller shaft 10, and by changing the position as<br>
described above, it is possible to change the arrangement position of the stopper 3 and the<br>
flap 4 into the circumferential direction of the cross section perpendicular to the grinding<br>
roller shaft 10. For example, in Fig. 9, while the screen halves 2 are arranged one on the<br>
other and jointed with each other via the horizontal joint surface J, it is also possible to<br>
arrange the screen halves 2 on the left and right sides and joint them via the vertical joint<br>
surface J in the position rotated by 90° about the grinding roller shaft 10 as shown in Fig.<br>
4, or to convert the screen halves 2 by rotation of 180°.<br>
Since position of the stopper 3 and the flap 4 attached to each screen half 2 can be<br>
changed in the circumferential direction of the bran removing screen S, relative positions<br>
of the stopper 3 and the flap 4 with respect to the outlet ends of feeding spiral grooves 50a<br>
and 50b formed on the outer periphery of the feeding roller 5 on the upstream side of the<br>
rice polishing room as will be described later, the discharging roller 9, and accordingly the<br>
polished rice outlets 6a and 6b as will be described later are changed, so that it is possible<br>
to preferably adjust the conditions in introducing unpolished rice into the rice polishing<br>
room and in discharge polished rice from the polishing room.<br>
Also various options can be expected as for arrangement of the stopper 3 and the flap 4<br>
in each screen half 2, and various options can be expected as for combination of screen<br>
halves 2 having different configuration of the stopper 3 and flap 4.<br>
As for each screen half 2, as shown in Figs. 7 and 8, it is expected that two stoppers 3<br>
and two flaps 4 are arranged alternately. Each of the stopper 3 and the flap 4 is arranged<br>
around the outer periphery of each, among the six grinding rollers 1 on the grinding roller<br>
shaft 10, of the middle four grinding rollers 1A, IB, 1C and ID other than two grinding<br>
rollers positioned on either side, as shown in Figs. 10,12 and the like.<br>
Figs. 9 to 13 show the bran removing screens S which is formed by arranging the<br>
screen halves 2 of the same structure one on the other to render them a screen upper half<br>
2U and a screen lower half 2L, respectively, and jointing them with each other, wherein<br>
the screen upper half 2U is inverted with regard to the fore-and-aft direction (the inlet end<br>
and the outlet end are inverted) between the bran removing screen S shown in Figs. 10<br>
and ll(a)-(d) and the bran removing screen S shown in Fig. 12 and Figs. 13(a)-(d). As a<br>
consequence, the sequence in the grinding roller shaft 10 direction of the stopper 3 and<br>
the flap 4 arranged along the upper half outer periphery of each of the middle four<br>
grinding rollers 1 is also inverted between the screen upper halves 2U of the respective<br>
working examples.<br>
In the case of the working example shown in Fig. 10 and Figs. ll(a)-(d), among the<br>
grinding rollers 1A, IB, 1C and ID, as for two alternate grinding rollers 1A and 1C, the<br>
upper half is surrounded by the flap 4 and the lower half is surrounded by the stopper 3 as<br>
shown in Figs. ll(a) and (c), and as for the remaining two alternate grinding rollers IB<br>
and ID, the upper half is surrounded by the stopper 3 and the lower half is surrounded by<br>
the flap 4 as shown in Figs. ll(b) and ll(d). In other words, for any of the middle four<br>
grinding rollers 1A, IB, 1C and ID, either one of the upper half and the lower half is<br>
surrounded by the stopper 3 and the other the upper half and the lower half is surrounded<br>
by the flap 4.<br>
To the contrary, in the cases of the wording example shown in Fig. 12 and Figs.<br>
13(a)-(d), among the middle four grinding rollers 1, as for two alternate grinding rollers,<br>
both of the upper half and the lower half are surrounded by the stopper 3 as shown in Figs.<br>
13(a) and (c), and as for the remaining two alternate grinding rollers, both of the upper<br>
half and the lower half are surrounded by the flap 4 as shown in Figs. 13(b) and (d).<br>
If comparison is made for the fluidity of rice between these working examples, in the<br>
case where the bran removing screen S shown in Figs. 12 and 13 are used, the rice<br>
existing on the upstream side of the pair of stoppers 3 vertically arranged in the rice<br>
polishing room can move downstream only via a very small gap of length G2 formed<br>
between the pair of stoppers 3 vertically formed on the left and right sides of the objective<br>
grinding rollers 1A and 1C. For the remaining two grinding rollers IB and ID, the flaps<br>
4 arranged in the vertical direction form thin gaps on the top and bottom and gaps having<br>
a regular thickness of G3 on the left and right sides of each grinding roller 1.<br>
To the contrary, in the case where the bran removing screen S shown in Fig. 10 and Fig.<br>
11, the stopper 3 is arranged on the outer periphery of each of the four middle grinding<br>
rollers 1 so that the rice is prevented from flowing from the inlet side to the outlet side in<br>
the rice polishing room, however, the rice flows from the inlet side to the outlet side via a<br>
thinned gap (hereinafter, referred to as "thin gap") between the flap 4 provided opposite to<br>
the stopper 3 and the grinding roller 1, and via gaps having a regular thickness of Gl on<br>
the left and right sides formed between the respective stopper 3 and flap 4 on the left and<br>
right sides of each grinding roller 1. Incidentally, the position of the thin gap is inverted<br>
in vertical direction for every one of the four middle grinding rollers 1, thereby preventing<br>
the communication of rice directed from the inlet side to the outlet side of the rice<br>
polishing room from deviating to either one of the upper side and lower side.<br>
As described above, since the bran removing screen S shown in Figs. 12 and 13 has<br>
higher effect of preventing flowing of rice by means of the stopper 3 than the bran<br>
removing screen S shown in Figs. 10 and 11, and hence it can elongate the loading time<br>
and the residence time of the rice in the rice polishing room, the polishing degree is<br>
improved.<br>
Which one is to be used may be determined in accordance with the practical request,<br>
however, even such a situation occurs that one embodiment of the bran removing screens<br>
S is desired, though the other embodiment of the bran removing screens S has been<br>
prepared, it is possible to immediately respond to such a situation by reassembling the<br>
screen S while inverting the screen upper half 2U with regard to the fore-and-aft direction<br>
(inverting the inlet end and the outlet end) from the both screen halves 2U and 2L.<br>
Also, it is possible to invert the screen lower half 2L with regard to the fore-and-aft<br>
direction in place of the screen upper half 2U.<br>
Alternatively, it is also possible that one of the two screen halves 2 has the stopper 3<br>
and the flap 4 as shown in Figs. 7 and 8, and the other of the two screen halves 2 has only<br>
the stopper 3, and these halves are assembled to form the bran removing screen S, or it is<br>
also possible that both of the screen halves 2 have only the stopper 3 for extremely<br>
improving the polishing degree. Also, it is possible to use the screen halves 2 having<br>
only the flap 4.<br>
Next, explanation on the unpolished rice feeding spiral groove 50 formed on the outer<br>
peripheral surface of the feeding roller 5 will be made with reference to Fig. 14.<br>
The feeding roller 5 illustrated in Fig. 1 is formed with a single spiral groove (feeding<br>
spiral groove) 50 for taking unpolished rice dropping from the unpolished rice hopper 14<br>
from its inlet end (right end) to its outlet end (left end) on its outer peripheral surface.<br>
To the contrary, the feeding roller 5 shown in Fig. 14 is formed with two feeding spiral<br>
grooves 50a and 50b which are parallel with each other on its outer peripheral surface.<br>
The feeding spiral grooves 50a and 50b are arranged with a phase shift of 180° or<br>
arranged in such manner that the respective initial ends and the respective terminal ends<br>
of the grooves 50a and 50b are deviated by 180° from each other, respectively at the rear<br>
end peripheral edge and the front end peripheral edge of the feeding roller 5.<br>
In this manner, since two feeding spiral grooves 50a and 50b alternately run in parallel<br>
and at regular intervals along the axial center of the feeding roller 5 on the outer<br>
peripheral surface of the feeding roller 5, the unpolished rice can be equally taken from<br>
the grooves 50a and 50b, and furthermore, unpolished rice is fed into the polishing room<br>
from the terminal ends of the grooves 50a and 50b of which rotation angles differ from<br>
each other by 180°, with the result that it is possible to reduce the vibration by keeping a<br>
balance during rotation of the grinding rollers 1.<br>
Next, configuration of the polished rice outlet formed in the polished rice outlet<br>
member 6 will be explained.<br>
In the lower part of the polished rice outlet member 6, as shown in Figs. 2 and 15-17, a<br>
lower polished rice outlet 6a which is the primary outlet is opened, and in the upper part<br>
of the polished rice outlet member 6, as shown in Fig. 16, a pair of upper polished rice<br>
outlets 6b which is the secondary outlet is provided on the left and right sides on the<br>
bearing cover 33. That is, the polished rice outlet member 6 is provided with the total of<br>
three outlets of polished rice, all of which communicate with the opening 13a formed in<br>
the outlet side supporting panel 13 as shown in Figs. 16 and 17.<br>
As shown in Figs. 15 to 17, a polisher rice outlet trough 46 extends outwardly in the<br>
downward diagonal direction from the lower polisher rice outlet 6a, and the polished rice<br>
outlet trough 46 comprises a left and right passages 46b for the polished rice dropping<br>
from the upper polished rice outlets 6b and a center passage 46a for the polished rice from<br>
the lower polished rice outlet 6a.<br>
Furthermore, an outlet side cover 7 is attached on the front surface of the polished rice<br>
outlet member 6 so as to cover the upper polished rice outlets 6b and the front surface of<br>
the polished rice outlet member 6 in the vicinity of the bearing cover 33, and inside the<br>
outlet side cover 7, polished rice passages from the left and right upper polished rice<br>
outlets 6b to the left and right passages 46b in the polished rice outlet trough 46 are<br>
formed. In addition, transparent peep windows 32 are fitted into the outlet side cover 7<br>
so as to oppose to each of the left and right upper polished rice outlets 6b, so that it is<br>
possible to visually check the discharge condition of the polished rice from the upper<br>
polished rice outlets 6b and the polishing degree of the polished rice.<br>
Furthermore, it is also possible to make each of the upper polished rice outlets 6b<br>
capable of opening/closing, whereby when it is desired to reduce the rice polishing time,<br>
the polished rice is discharged from both of the two upper polished rice outlets 6b,<br>
whereas when it is desired to further improve the polishing degree no matter the rice<br>
polishing time is elongated, the polished rice is discharged from only one of the upper<br>
polished rice outlet 6b.<br>
A pressure adjusting shutter 18 is provided so as to cover the polished rice outlet trough<br>
46, of which upper end portion is pivoted so as to be able to swivel in the vertical<br>
direction on a horizontal pivot axis 18b which is hung on the polished rice outlet trough<br>
46 above the lower polished rice outlet 6a. Also, inside the pressure adjusting shutter 18,<br>
a shutter for lower polished rice outlet 18a placed in the center passage 46a is integrally<br>
formed, of which lower end can completely close the lower polished rice outlet 6a by<br>
coming into contact with the floor surface of the center passage 46a. Incidentally, when<br>
the lower end of the shutter for lower polished rice outlet 18a is in contact with the floor<br>
surface of the center passage 46a, the pressure adjusting shutter 18 including the shutter<br>
for lower polished rice outlet 18a is somewhat inclined downward and rearward.<br>
A weight attaching rod 31 is provided integrally with the pressure adjusting shutter 18<br>
so as to protrude frontward and downward therefrom. To this weight attaching rod 31,<br>
an adjusting weight 30 can be attached while adjusting the number or position thereof,<br>
and the pressure adjusting shutter 18 is urged downward by the gravity exerted on the<br>
adjusting weight 30, which results in generation of a force of pushing the lower end of the<br>
shutter for lower polished rice outlet 18a against the polished rice outlet trough 46 (center<br>
passage 46a). Magnitude of this pushing force determines the free opening of the lower<br>
polished rice outlet 6a. That is, when the pushing force is weak, the free opening is large,<br>
so that the rice discharged from the lower polished rice outlet 6a pushes the shutter for<br>
lower polished rice outlet 18a and discharged along the center passage 46a. The<br>
stronger the pushing force, the smaller the free openings is, and when the pushing force is<br>
made so strong that the free opening is nearly 0, the rice discharged from the lower<br>
polished rice outlet 6a is blocked by the shutter 18a for lower polished rice outlet so that it<br>
can no longer flow down along the center passage 46a.<br>
Incidentally, a spare adjusting weight 30 is attached by passing the same on a spare<br>
weight attaching rod 45 which is horizontally provided on the outlet bearing support 6 so<br>
as to protrude therefrom in the vicinity of the polished rice outlet trough 46. When it is<br>
desired to increase the pushing force of the pressure adjusting shutter 18, the spare<br>
adjustment weight 30 is removed from the spare weight attaching rod 45 and is attached<br>
to the weight attaching rod 31. When it is desired to decrease the pushing force of the<br>
pressure adjusting shutter 18, excess adjusting weight 30 is removed from the weight<br>
attaching rod 31 and attached to the spare weight attaching rod 45.<br>
In this way, by adjusting the number or position of the adjusting weight 30 to be<br>
attached to the weight attaching rod 31, the urge force of the pressure adjusting shutter 18<br>
is adjusted, and the free opening of the lower polished rice outlet 6a is adjusted, with the<br>
result that the residence time of the rice within the rice polishing room formed between<br>
the bran removing screen S and the grinding rollers 1, that is. grinding time and loading<br>
amount are adjusted.<br>
That is, in the case of raising the polishing degree of the polished rice to be discharged,<br>
the adjusting weight 30 on the weight attaching rod 31 is weighed to strengthen the<br>
pushing force of the pressure adjusting shutter 18 provided in the lower polished rice<br>
outlet 6a against discharging of the polished rice, that is, to strengthen the closing degree,<br>
thereby elongating the residence time of the polished rice in the rice polishing room<br>
between the grinding rollers 1 and the bran removing screen S. When the loading<br>
amount of the rice in the rice polishing room increases and the level position elevates as a<br>
consequence this, the polished rice is automatically discharged from the upper polished<br>
rice outlets 6b. Incidentally, in this situation, if the upper polished rice outlets 6b are<br>
designed to be able to open/close, and one of them is in the open state, the residence time<br>
and loading amount in the rice polishing room are further increased, so that the polishing<br>
degree is further elevated. The polished rice discharged from the upper polished rice<br>
outlets 6b passes inside the outlet side cover 7 and drops while being guided by the left<br>
and the right passages 46b of the polished rice outlet trough 46.<br>
In the case of lowering the polishing degree of the polished rice, the degree of pushing<br>
of the pressure adjusting shutter 18 is lowered by adjusting the number and position of the<br>
adjusting weight 30 on the weight attaching rod 31. In this case, the polished rice<br>
mainly drops from the lower polished rice outlet 6a which is the primary outlet and drops<br>
into the center outlet 46a of the polished rice outlet trough 46.<br>
As described above, by adjusting the free opening of the pressure adjusting shutter 18,<br>
the polished rice is discharged from only the lower polished rice outlet 6a which is the<br>
primary outlet when the rice polishing is conducted under the low polishing degree<br>
condition; from only the upper polished rice outlets 6b which is the secondary outlet<br>
when the rice polishing is conducted under the high polishing degree condition; and from<br>
the total of three outlets of the lower polished rice outlet 6a and the upper polished rice<br>
outlets 6b when the rice polishing is conducted under the intermediate polishing degree<br>
condition.<br>
In this way, the polishing degree is adjusted by adjusting the free opening of the<br>
pressure adjusting shutter 18 and thus adjusting the residence time and loading amount of<br>
the rice in the rice polishing room, and in addition, even when the high polishing degree<br>
is selected, the polished rice is smoothly discharged by the upper polished rice outlet 6b,<br>
so that efficiency of rice polishing is secured.<br>
Also, as shown in Fig. 16, in the bearing cover 33, a bearing cleaning fan 48 is fixed to<br>
the front end of the grinding roller shaft 10, which blows the air having taken from a<br>
cooling air intake 49 downwardly formed on the front end of the bearing cover 33 against<br>
the bearing 37. Small rice particles and bran that have leaked to the bearing 37 via the<br>
axial hole 6c of the polished rice outlet member 6 from the discharging roller 9 is returned<br>
to the side of the discharging roller 9 by this air, thereby preventing the bearing 37 from<br>
seizing up due to such adhered objects.<br>
Furthermore, as illustrated in Figs. 15 and 16, the outlet side of the discharging roller 9<br>
is configured in a truncated cone shape, and an extruding member 47 for improving the<br>
discharge efficiency is provided in this part. The extruding member 47 is designed to be<br>
attachable on the surface of the truncated cone of the discharging roller 9 by mean of a<br>
bolt, and have a variable shape and thickness.<br>
