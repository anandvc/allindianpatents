SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR TRANSPORTATION VEHICLE MONITORING, FEEDBACK AND CONTROL<br>
. [0001] The present application claims priority to U.S. provisional appHcatioii of Kapadia, Ser. No. 60/219/736, filed My 20, 2000, and U.S. provisional application of Kapadia and Vieira, Ser. No. 60/275,520 filed March 14,2001, the entiretj^ of which is hereby incorporated into the present application by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of tile Invention<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to methods and systems for transportation vehicle operation, performance and condition monitoring and feedback.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
[0003] In the case of a transportation vehScle accident^ e.g., an aircraft crash, a transportation vehicle data recorder (TVDR)^ e.g,, a Flight Data Recorder (FDRj also Icnown as.a 'black box"), is used to aid in determining the cause of the crash. However^ the TVDR is not always easily located in the remains of the transportation vehicle wreckage. The TVDR also does not monitor existing transportation vehicle conditions during Operation, for example, FDRs do not monitor existing transportation vehicle conditions during flight. Moreover, conventional • TVDRs are not appropriate tools for gathering and analyzing research data that can eventually be used to improve transportation technology as a whole.<br>
[0004] This is a significant deficiency as operators of transportation vehicles such as aircraft are under significant business presssure to reduce the risk of accidents and to ensure that tlie costs of operating these transportation vehicles are minimized. Various certified conamercial tools axe available for these purposes on large commercial transportation vehicles such as conamercial aircraft whose operators typically maintain custom software and hardware^ for example, data down link, i.e,, transmission fi:om a commercial aircraft to ground stations, capability presently employed on large ahrliners for communication with home base. Such data down link technology iises, for example, lh.e Airborne Call and Recording System (ACARS). Conventionally, such software applications used for aircraft performance analysis are written by commercial transportation carriers^ for example^ specific commercial airline companies each design their own aircraft performance analysis tools.<br><br>
[0005] NevertJieless, such performance analysis technology is prohibitively expensive to maintain for small commercial transportation carriers and non-commercial transportation vehicle operators witii more limited manpower and operational resources.<br>
[0006] Moreover? in the commercial and non-coromercial aircraft industry, as well £is any other transportation vehicle industry, there are few tools for real-time diagnosis of transportation vehicle condition to improve safety and access to assistance for transportation vehicle operators. Additionally, there are presently no methods or systems for easily monitoring characteristics of an individual transportation veMcie's condition, perfommnce and operation. Moreover, there is presently no method or s-ystem for comparing tixe condltioo, performance or operation of particiilar types of transportation vebicles, a plurality of transportation vehicles^ under various atmospheric conditions, on psirticular geographic or topological routes, etc., with each other or against emphical parameters.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] Accordingly, various embodknents of the invention are directed at providing monitoring and feedback systems and methods that provide monitoring of transportation vehicle performance, operation and condition characteristics. An on-vehicle component of the system both stores and transmits information aboul: the performance, operation and/or condition of the transportation vehicle fo a base-station component of the S3^stem. The base-station component of these systems may store the information received firomthe on-vehicle component^ performs analysis of the vehicle characteristics and both stores and transmits feedback information to the transportation vehicle based on that analysis. This feedback tofommtion may be received by a human operator or an automated or semi-automated system of an on-velticie component of the systems to provide information about the performance, operation or condition of the vehicle ■ and/or control performance or operation of the transportation vehicle.<br>
[0008] Additioiaally, it is foreseeable that the monitoring information provided to the base-station component and feedback info:cmation provided to the on-vehicle component may be archived and used to proiile operation, peiformance, or conditions of a particular transportation vehi.cle, a particular type of transportation vehicle or a plurality of transportation vehicles over a period of time, under specific environmental conditions or any other useful criteria. This archived information may also be used to perform investigation of the performance, operation or condition of a transportation vehicle in the case of an accident, e.g., a plane crash. In accordance with at least one embodiment of ttie inventionj an expert system may be included in one or both of the on-vehicle component and the base-station component that analyses and learns from &amp;e<br><br>
archived informatioE and may suggest and/or actuate taking a particular action or set of actions or prohibit taking that action or set of actions to conUol operation of the transportation vehicle if, for example, it recognizes that one or more particnlai actions are advisable or inadvisable.<br>
[0009] Tliese and other features and advantages of this invention are described in or are apparent from the following detailed description of the systems and methods according to this<br>
invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0010] Further objects and advantages of this invention will be evident when the foUovmg detailed description is read in oonjiinction with the attached drawings, in which:<br>
[0011] Figure 1 illustrates one implementation of the embodiments of the invention used in conjunction with a transportation vehicle that is an ahrcrafi and transmission capability provided by satellite;<br>
[0012] Figure 2 illustrates a functional block diagram of one implementation of the on-vehicle component provided on a transportation vehicle in accordance with the embodiments of the invention; and<br>
[0013] Figure 3 illustrates a functional flock diagram of one implementation of the base-station component provided to monitor and provide feedback to the transportation vehicles.<br>
•<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0014]   It should be appreciated that the term 'transportation vehicle' may include any vehicle used for transportation of cargo and/or people. Therefore, transportation vehicles may include cars, trucks, boats, shipsj planes^ satellites, or any other now kno^\n or later developed vehicle for transportation that includes equipment that is susceptible to failure.<br>
[0015] According to the embodimentSj the transportation vehicle monitoring and feedback system is implemented in conjunction with a transportation vehicle. For ease of explanation, description of various embodiments of the invention will refer to a transportation vehicle that is an aircraft. However., it should be appreciated that the transportation vehicle may be any other potentially transportation vehicle including but not limited to aircraft, rockets^ missiles, blimps, balloons, satellites^ a land-based vehicle, including but not limited to automobiles such as cars, trucks, utility veihicles, buses, trains, tanlcs, remotely operated land vehicles, or a watercraft, i-e.. a veidcle capable of providing transportation via a body of water, inciudiug but not liroited to boats, ships&gt; submarines, hovercrafts, etc.<br><br>
[0016] At least one of the embodixaents of the inveritioii may be implemented in conjunction with transportation vehicle data recorders (TVDRs) in transportation vehicles, e.g., FDR in aircraft. For example, on an aircraft, on-board components of the monitoring and feedback system may be coupled to the secondary feed of the aircraft's "black box'* or FDR.<br>
[0017] Digital data transmission technology has advanced significantly in recent years and both technology and processing capabilities have now progressed to the point that rehable digp^tal data transmission equipment can be economically installed on a transportation vehicle platform. Such on-vehicle equipment may be used in conjunction with existing transmission technology, for example, ACARS-VHF, the Internet, and also as an effective adjunct to the Global Positioning System (GPS) to communicate with a base-station component Additionally, software has advanced to die point that operators can be provided with simple to develop, economic^ commercial packages that are autonomous in operation, user friendly, flexible and reliable.<br>
[0018] Figure I illustrates one implementation of a transportation vehicle monitoring and feedback system designed in accordance with the at least one embodiment of the invention and implemented in a transportation vehicle that is an aircraft. As shown in Fig. I, a base-station 110 communicates with a transportation ^'elncle 120, in this instance an aircraft, via at least one sateUite 130 and an antenna 140- The transportation vehicle 120 communicates with the satellite 130 via a transmission link 150 that may be, for example, a radio-fi-equency communication link, conventionally understood in the satellite communication industry. The satellite 130 communicates with the antenna 140, which may be, for example, a land-based transceiver, via a communication link 160., which may be, for example, a radio-ftequency communication link. The antenna 140 communicates with the base-station 110 via a communication link 170, w^iich may be^, for example, a radio-frequency comrnxmication link, a cable, a wireless link, a communication path on the Internet, an Intranet and/or any public or private network.<br>
[0019] Data transmission from the transportation vehicle 120 to the base-station 110 may be performed using any of various alternative transmission formats and technologies to provide the constiment transmission links 150-170. For instance, when implemented with transportation vehicles 120 that are aircraft or other airborne vehicles, ACARS may be used to provide that data transmission links necessary to provide communication between the transportation vehicle 120 and the base-station 110.<br><br>
[0020) ACARS is a certified, widely used aeronautical commumcation device, and as such presents one low risk method for e^tabiishmg air to ground data comtmmications tixat may be xised, for example, when the transportation vehicle is an aircraft or other airboine; transportation vehicle. Although conventioiml use of airborne broadband applications is still expeiimental, there is good reason to believe that such communication methodologies vnll soon be certified by regulatory organisations. The use of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite telephony is also possible through the use of certified aircraft applications, e.g., Collins® Satcom facility. It is also foreseeable that Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) umy be utilized to provide communication links between base-stations and transportation vehicles, as an extension of broadband application with enhanced portal facilities.<br>
[0021] ACARS is available for aknost all fLlght patiis on the globe and is transmitted in the foUowiug frequencies:<br>
13L550 MHz - ACARS Primaiy channel for North America 131,475 MHz - Company channel for Air Canada®<br>
(and some European airlines in North Ajcnerica) 130.025 MHz"- ACARS Secondary channel for North America 129,125 MHz - ACAJRS Tertiary channel for North America 136.900 MHz - ACARS channel situated near London 13U25 MHz - ACARS channel Primary channel for Europe 131.525 MHz - ACARS channel Tertisrj' channel for Europe 131.550 MHz - ACARS Primary channel for Asia/Pacific 131.450 MHz - ACARS Primary channel for Japan [0022] It shoxild be understood that, particular with the implementation of invention embodiments with aircrafts, an antemia assembly, e.g., one including a blade antenna, may track satellites dynamically to provide communication with the base station(s) to ensure that one or more communication links is maintained to provide continuous or periodic communication with the base station* Such an abiHty to track a sateiilfe may be provided, in part^ using an attitude controller.<br>
[0023] Alternatively, the antenna iissembly may use one or more patch antennas, e.g., manufactured usiug mold technology, to provide commimication with the base station(s). Additionally, such a patch antenna may suffer fi:om issues related to cloud cover and transmission and reception noise. This and other noise suffered by the communication sy'stem<br><br>
may be reduced by using a filter, for example, a filter designed by Dynocon located in Toronto,<br>
Canada-<br>
[0024] One or more antennas or antenna assemblies may be placed on the tail section of to aircraft to help ensure that there at least one antenna or antenna assemble that has a sufficient Spatial relationship with the location of one or more satellites. In such a configuration, or any other configuration in which more than one antemia or antenna assembly is available, an ftlgorithm may be utilx^ed to dynamically switch between the feeds of the plurality of antennas or antennas assemblies to provide the best possible communication comiection between the transportation vehicle and the base station(s). In such an implementation, the algorithm could allow for switching between feeds if^ for examplCj a feed signal fades.<br>
[0025] Alternatively, such an implementation may allow for dynamic selection of the antenna or antenna assembly with the strongest communication signal c^abiMty. Additionally, ;in implementation, the algorithm may be set up to communicate through a default selected antenna or antenna assembly and switch to another antenna oi antenna assembly oiily when the signal quality on the alternative anteima(s)/antenna assembly(s) is better. Moreover, the algorithm may be set up so that switching ^vill only occur when the quality is significantly better (e^gvi by a predetermined factor) to reduce imnecessary switching when quality from antemia(s)/antenna assembly(s) is virtually the same.<br>
[0026] Transmission between the transportation vehicle(s) and the base $tation(s) may occur in the KU band with a secondary option being the L band,<br>
[0027] In accordance with at least one implementation the antenna assembly "used to provide communication with the base station(s) may be incorporated with one or more antenna structures used on the transportation vehicle, thus^ reduchig the hardware exposed on the trcinsportation vehicle.<br>
[0028] It should be understood that transportation vehicle operators, e,g., actual operators or carriers or other organizations controlling operation of the transportation vehicles, may use one or more communication providers^ iacluding satellite relay providers, in connection with their use of the monitoring and feedback system including one or more communication providers associated with the monitoring and feedback system.<br>
[0029] In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, transportation vehicle operators may operate their own base stations with more limited support provided by the monitoring and feedback system operators. Thus; it should be understood that there may be : some communication cormection between the base stations and one or more remote archive<br><br>
facilities* Such facilities may be centraJized based on geographic or political region or based on relative use of the monitoring and feedback system in particiilar geographic areas.<br>
[0030] In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, the monitoring and feedback system may monitor and store supplemental data, i.e., transportation vehicle operational data not specifically requested by a particular operator.<br>
[0031] Figure 2 illustrates various sub-components ihBt may be incorporated in the on-vehicle component 1200 of the monitoring and feedback system along vdih other equipment potentially used m conjunction with the on-vehicle component 1200. As illustrated in Figure 2, the tL"anspo.rtation vehicle 120 may include an on-vehicle component 1200 of the monitorijig and feedback system 100 that may work in conjxmction with a transportation vehicle data bus 1210^ e.g., an FDR when the transportation vehicle is an aircraft. The on-vehicle component 1200 may include an operational memory 1220, a transportation vehicle data bus interface 1230, a controller 1240, processor 1250, auxihaiy sensors 1260, a memory buffer storage system 1270 and a transceiver unit 1280. All of the elements are opemtionally coupled together, i.e., coupled together in such a way that the elements may cooperate, by a data/control/communication bus i290.<br>
[0032] As illustrated in Fig. 2, the operational memory 1220 can be implemented using any appropriate combination of alterable, volatile or non-volatile memoi::^' or non-alterable, or fixed, memory- Any alterable memory, whether volatile or non-volatile, can be implemented using any one or more of static or dynamic RAM, a floppy disk and disk drive, a writable or re-rewritable optical disk and disk drive, a hard drive, flash memory or the hke. Similarly, any non-alterable or fixed memory can be implemented using any one or more of ROM, PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, an optical ROM disk, such as a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM disk, and disk dri\^e or the like.<br>
[0033] The operational memory 1220 stores instructions for operation of the on-vehicle component 1200. These instructions are fetched by the processor 1250 under the control of the controller 1240.<br>
[0034] The transportation vehicle data bus interface 1230 provides an interface between the transportation vehicle data bus 1210 and the on-vehicle component 1200. It should be appreciated that tlie transportation vehicle data bus interfece may provide an interface with a traiisportation vehicle data recorder, if one is present on the transportation vehicle and to sensors that conventionally provide information to meters within the operator area of the transportation vehicle, e.g., the cockpit.<br><br>
[0035] The controller 1240 controls operation and co-operation of the operational memory 1220^ transportation vehicle databns interface 1230, processor 1250, axixiliaxy sensors 1260, memory buffer storage system 1270 and transceiver unit 1280. The processor 1250 works wththe controller 1240 to control operation and co-operation of the other elements 1220^ 1230 and 1250-1280. In co-operation with the controller 1240, the processor 1250 fetches instructions from the operational memory 1220 and decodes them, winch may cause the processor 1250 to transfer data from the operational memory 1220, to perfonn data reduction techniques and/or encryption to data provided by the transportation vehicle data bus 1210 ^/ia the interface 1230, or to store such data in the memoiy buffer storage system 1270 or transmit it via the transceiver unit 1280.<br>
[0036] The monitoring and feedback system may be activated upon power-up or embarkation of the traasport vehicle, e.g., take-off, launch, etc. It is foreseeable that the rrionitoring and feedback may utilize different phases of operation. For example^ on-vehicle sensors may sense power-up or embarkation and the controller 1240 illustrated ta Fig. 2 may control the system to begin sensing, storing and transmitting data to the base-station 110 illustrated in Fig. 1. More specifically, whan the embodiments of the invention are implemented in an aircrafl; such sensors may monitor engine operation, weight or motion in wheel assemblages of the aircraft, etc., e.g., to determine when data sensing, storage and transmission $bould begin. Similarly, the controller 1240 may control the on-vehicle component 1200 to cease data sensing, storage and transmission based on information from such sensors, by manual control of a vehicle operator or base-station personnel, etc.<br>
[0037] The auxiliary sensors 1260 can acquire information about the performance, operation and/or condition of the transportation vehicle that is supplementary to the data conventionally monitored by transportation vehicle systems and provided to a transportation vehicle operator, for example, via the transportation vehicle data bus 1210. For example, the auxiliary sensors 1260 may include video, audio, or audio-video data recorders iostalled at various locations throughont tiie transportation vehicle. It should be appreciated that data from such recorders may be streaming data, i.e., a sequence of "moving images", potentially with accompanying sound, that may be compressed xising known compression algorithms, transmitted to the base-jtation component 1100 and displayed by the viewer as the images arrive, or may simply provide snap shot data that provides information about a specific instant in time on a periodic or base-station activated basis/<br><br>
[0038J It is foreseeable that one or more of the aiaxiliary sensors 1260, for example video anci/or voice recorders, may be activated by base-statioa personnel as necessary, and, potentially, only m the event of transportatioa vehicle operator authorization or some other emergency indicator.<br>
[0039] A-uxiliary sensors 1260 roay include various types of sensors that are specific to types of transportation vehicles. Fox example, auxiliary sensors 1260 oc a transportation vehicle such as a train may include one or more sensors that determine whether a train is sufficiently stable or coupled to a train track. Additionally, auxiliary sensors 1260 may include sensors for each car that indicates the weight of the cai' with or without cargo, what model the car is, what model an engine is, etc.<br>
[0040] Auxiliary sensors 1260 may include sensors associated with train enginesj e.g., the sensors are engine specific. Additionally, other circuitry and hardware associated with the . on-board component of the monitoring and feedback system may also be incorporated in each engine. "When implemented with transportation veMcles that are trains^ i.e., modular transportation vehicles that change in their configuration, which may incorporate one or more Engines and passenger and cargo receptacles, the on-board component may include intelligence that allows sensors mcluded in each receptacle to interact and cooperate to monitor the train cooperatively. Thus&gt; when more than one engine is used in a train, the hardware and software in each engine can cooperate to identify only one engine that includes hardware and software acting as the main intelligence of the train. In such an implementation, a configuration program may be run following interconneotion of tlie constituent receptacles and engines of the train to inventory what equipment is included in the train and define how the hardware is related, e.g., how many engines are included, how many cars, tlae weight of each car with or without cargo, die models of the car$&gt; etc. Additionally^ this coniiguration noay identify what engine component acts as the main on-board component of the monitoring and feedback system.<br>
[0041] Additionally, on-board or off-board liardware and/or sofh^'are may be configured to determine what a payload and/or power distribution is on the train. This inforaaation may be tis&amp;d by Artificial Intelligence (AT), explained in detail below, to determine an expected operation of the train and identify reasonable operation parameters for the train. These parameters may then be compared against actual operation of the train to determine whether the train is operating within expected parameter ranges, or, for example, characteristics that indicate dangerous or unexpected operation. This AI may utilize previously archived data to formulate<br><br>
tile reasOEiaWe operation paxameiers lor luai ana otuei: trams VH^GU. UH tac o-eiennixieu configuration of the train (as explained beiow).<br>
[0042] Similarly, if the transportation vehide(s) being monitored is a tractor trailer (consisting of a tractor and a trailer component), a truck, a semi-trailer, etc., auxiliary sensors 1260 may include one or more sensors that determine whether the vehicle is snf&amp;ciently stable or interacting safely with a road, by, e.g., monitoring the pressure experienced on various wheels on the vehicle to ensure that they are within industry accepted parameter ranges , Additionally, anxiliary sensors 1260 may include sensors for trailer that indicates die weight of the trailer with or without cargo, what model the trailer is, what model a tractor is, what size engine the tractor includes, etc. Furthers the auxiliary sensors 1260 may iociude a sensor, for example a level gauge, configured to detemiine whether the tractor-trailer ha$ toppled over,<br>
[0043] Auxiliary sensors 1260 may include sensors associated with tractors, e.g., the sensors are tractor specific. Additionally, other circuitry and hardware associated with the onboard component of the monitoring and feedback system may also be incorporated in each tractor. When implemented with transportation vehicles that are tractor-trailers, i.e., modular transportation vehicles that change in their configuration, which may. incorporate one or more trailers, the on-board component naay include intelligence that allows sensors included in both<br>
the tractor and the tratler(s) to interact and cooperate to monitor the tractor trailer cooperatively.<br>
• In such an implementation, a configuration program may be run following interconnection of the<br>
constituent tractor and trailer(s) to inventory what equipment is included in the tractor trailer and<br>
define how the hardware is related, e.g., how many trailers are included and of what they are, the<br>
weight of each trailer with or without cargo, the length of the trailer, the models of the trailer(s)<br>
and tractor, etc. AdditLonally, on-board or off-board hardware and/or software nmy be<br>
configured to determine what a payiaad and/or power distribution is on the iractor-trailer. This<br>
information may be used by AI, explained in detail below, to determine an expected operation of<br>
liie tractor-trailer and identify reasonable operation parameters for its operation in various<br>
weather conditions. These parameters may then be compared against actual operation of the<br>
tiactor-trailer to determine whether the tractor-trailer is operating within expected parameter<br>
ranges, or, for example, characteristics that indicate dangerous or unexpected operation. This AI<br>
may utilize previously archived data to formulate the reasonable operation parameters for that<br>
and other tractor-trailers based on the determined configuration of the tractor-trailer (as<br>
explained below).<br><br>
(0044] la accordance vdth at least one embodiment oi the mventiou, the auxiliary sensors 1260 may include sensors tiat detect the temperature within, for example, refrigerated or heated receptacles on the traiisportation vehicle^ for example^ in a trailer of a tractor trailer^ in a trucic on a train, in a sHp, an aircraft, etc. Additionally, a detection daat a temperature is not within an acceptable or expected range may trigger issuance of an alert to the transportation vehicle operator to address the temperature disparrtj\ Altemativelyp or in addition, the on-board component may be configured to provide remote control of the temperature of the receptaole(s).<br>
[0045] In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, the auxiliary sensors 1260 may include sensors that are configured to monitor fox and detect pathogens on the transportation vehicle. Such an embodiment may be used to protect against transportation of disease.bearing agents from one geographic area to another via the transportation vehicle(s). Similarly, tiie monitoiing and feedback system may be used as one mechanism for ensuring that cargo is firee of certain pathogens, for example, a shipment of cattle is transported using a transportation vehicle that is configured with sensors that monitor for various diseases. For example, the $ensor(s) may be configured to sense the presence and concentration of a wide .variety of specified vapors released into either the breath or body fluids of a Hving entity. The sensor(s) may provide these benefits using a sample chamber and a pluralit&gt;^ of sensors located on a chip raclnded within or adjacent to the sample chamber. Vapors are directed to pass tixrongh the sample chamber, whereupon the sensors provide a distinct combination of electrical signals in response to each. The sensors of the sensor(s) can take the foim of chemically sensitive resistors having resistances that vary according to the identity and concentration of an adjacent vapor. Such an embodiment may be particularly useful to cargo transportation carriers, e.g.5 based on outbrealcs of hoof and moutii disease.<br>
[0046] In accordance with at least one embodknent of the invention, the auxiliary sensors 1260 may include sensors that are configured to monitor for and detect spoilage of perishable cargo in any number of ways. For example, the sensor(s) may be configured to sense the presence and concentration of a wide variety of specified vapors as resulting from gases released during either decomposition or spoilage of foodstuffe. The sensor(s) may provide these benefits using a sample chamber and a plurality of sensors located on a chip included within or adjacent to the sample chamber. Vapors are directed to pass through the sample ctiamber, whereupon the sensors provide a distinct combination of electrical signals in response to each. Tlie sensors of the sensot(s) can take the form of chemically sensitive resistors hamg resistances that vary according to the identity and concentration of an adjacent vapor.<br><br>
{0047] Embodiments of the mvention that include sensors configured to detect pathogens and/or spoilage may be used to certify that cargo is free of contamination and/or decay to, for example, customs facilities, food and drug inspectors, insurance earners. Additionally, by including sensors that may continuously monitor for indications of disease or decay, the number of personnel charged with caring for the cargo may be decreased or the level of sldll of those personnel may be decreased.<br>
[0048} As with all types of transportation vehicles, a transportation vehicle profile may be configured and associated with all monitored and archived data associated with a corresponding transportation vehicle. This transpoitation vehicle may include identification data as well as characteristics of the transportation vehicle, for example, engine size and other operational characteristics of a tractor^ Trailers may also include some sensor or identification mechanism that may be recognised by the hardware or software of the on-boaxd component of the trailer that allows the component to recognize and record the identity of the trailer(s) with which it is coupled and its characteristics, e.g., number of tires, axles, etc. Additionally, sensors imay be included that register an amount of air pressure in tires on the trailer(s) and/or the tractor.<br>
[0049] Similarly, transportation veMcles such as ships and aircraft may include aindliary sensor 1260 lhat indicate some measure of hull integrity of the transportation vehicle, e.g., based on pressxure, huU resistance, etc.<br>
[0030] Auxiliary sensor 1260 may also include, e.g., for ships and oti^er water craft, sensors that detect an amount of rocking of the vessel(s) to determine calnmess of the water and stability of the vessels), sensors for measuring wmd speed and direction, relative or true location of the vessel(s) (e.g-^ using triangulation techniques or GPS technology), sensors for measuring the amount of cargo or weight being earned on the vessel(s), etc. Additionally, the sensors may include a sensor that, once a breach in a cargo hull has been detected, e.g., by a hull mtegrity detector, detects an egress rate of cargo of the breached hull. This sensor may operate in combination v-dth an algorithm that detemiines the amount of cargo leaving the hull of the sMp based on sensed changes in water displacement of the vessel and known dimensions and configurations of the vessel.<br>
[0051] Additionally, the monitoring and feedback system may include or receive sensoiy information from sensors located off board the transportation vehicle(s3 but in proximity to it-For example, the system may include or receive sensory information fiom sensors that indicate track condition of train traclcs that indicate, for example^ track conditions such as obstructions* integrity, etc. This information may then be used to provide real-time or near real-time feedback<br><br>
information to trains or train navigation controllers that w^y, "based on that infonnatiorL, re-route the trains or alter the operation of the trains to accommodate for the track conditions-<br>
[0052] The memory buffer storage system 1270 can also be implemented using any appropriate combination of alterable, volatile or non-volatile memory or non-alterable, or fixed, rnemory. The alterable memory^ whether volatile or non-volatile, can be implemented using any one or more of static or dynamic RAM, a floppy disk artd disk drive, a -v^Titable or re-rewritable optical disk and disk drive, a hard drive, flash memory or the like. Similarly, the non-alterable or fixed memory can be implemented using any one or more of ROM, PROM^ EPROM, EEPROM, an optical ROM disk, such as a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM disk, and disk drive or the like.<br>
[0053] Storage and processing of monitored data may be performed to compensate or handle both metric and English units. For example, data transmitted &amp;om a particular transportation vehicle may include indicia of what data measurements are taken, the units in Which the data was measured die order in which the data is transmitted, the frequency with which the data is transmitted, etc. Alternatively, all of that information may be included in a ff arsportation vehicle profile associated wi'fli transportation vehicle identification data stored at a base station(s) and/or a centralised data archive repository(s). Both this profile and the identification data may be associated with previously monitored operation data of the associated transportation vehicle and feedback data previousl)' provided to the transportation vehicle,<br>
[0054] The transceiver unit 1280 is a combination transmitrer/receiver and may be implemented, for example, using various communications technology such a5 wireless technology, including cellular telephony, radio, etc. It may be preferable for the transceiver to have ftiU duplex capability, that is, the ability to transmit and receive simultaneously.<br>
[0055] Upon transportation vehicle power up, or at any other appropriate time, e.g., takeoff of an aircraft, laxmch of a nautical vessel, etc., data transmission is initiated by a data bus reader and other monitoring devices.<br>
[0056] The content of this data transmission may also be captured by an on-vehicle memory buffer storage system 1270, It should be appreciated that tie operational memory 1220, controller 1240 and processor 1250 may be incorporated in, for example, a central processing unit.<br>
[0057] Data transmission rates may be dependent on the communications medium and i signal quality available for the particular transportation vehicle* For example, an analog cellular system may be available in remote comers of Afiica, which would mandate a slower, simpler<br><br>
inStallatioii. It should be appreciated that the traBSceiver vmt 1280 will include some type of antenna, design of wliich may depend on the type of transportation vehicle using the system 100. Moreover, antenna location on the transportation vehicle may depend on the type of transportation vehicle utiliziag the systern 100, fox example, an aircraft may need an antenna location that is certified-by a regulatory authority for a range of frequencies and tested accordingly for the individual operator.<br>
|0058] As data is being stored in the memory birSer storage system 1270, it is also transmitted in real-time, in streaming or packet burst form, to the base-station 110 via the transceiver unit 1280. This transceiver unit 1280 may include, for example, a FAA-approved antenna located on the front of the transportation vehicle when it is an aircraft. The data may be transmitted to the base-station 110 and monitored, stored, and analyzed m real-time, for example, if indicated by the transportation vehicle's service projEUe, explained below. Data transmission may be performed using conventionaily understood methods, for example, utilizing ACARS-VHF, the Internet, WAP, and/or satellite transmission.<br>
[0059J The data/control/communication bus 1290 operationally couples all of the Elements 1220-1280 together so that the on-vehicle component niay store and transmit performance, operation and/or condition data to the base-station component.<br>
[0060] In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, transmission of data between the transportation vehicle(s) and base station($) may be packet based. A packet may be thought of as the unit of data that is routed between an origin and a destination on a network, e.g., the Internet. The packet may be thought of as a chunk of a data file divided up to an efficient size for routing. Each of these packets is separately numbered and includes an address, for example, an Internet Protocol address, of the destination. The individxial packets for a given file may travel different routes through the network. When they have all arrived, they are reassembled into the original file using any connection-oriented protocol (for example, by a Transmission Control Protocol layer at the receiving end).<br>
[0061] The terms "packet" and "daitagram" are similar in meaning. A protocol similar to TCP, the User Datagram Protocol(UDP) uses the term datagram and may also be used in an embodiment of the invention to provide communication between the transportation vehicie(s) and the base station(s).<br>
[0062] In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, the data communicated with the transportation vehicles is encrypted, i.e., the data is converted into a , form, called a ciphertext, that cannot be easily understood by unaufliori^ed people, prior to<br><br>
transmission of the data. Subsequently, followiag reception of the data at either the transportatiOD. vehicle(s) or the base station(s), the data is decrypted, i,e., converting ui^^ encrypted data bade into its original form, so it can be understood. In accordance with at least one embodiment, the data is encrypted using an encryption algorithm that is specific to the monitoring and feedback system, for example, a symmetric algorithm (same key for encryption aind decryption) using block encryption (see block cipher) of 128 bits in size, supporting key sizes of 128,192 and 256 bits. In accordance with at least one embodiment, the encryption algorithm is implemented in the hardware and software of the transportation vehicle using a plug-in application, i.e., one or mot&amp; programs that can easily be installed and iised as part of a Web browser and is recognised aiitomaticaliy by the browser, its function being integrated into a main HTML file that is being presented,<br>
[0063] In one implementation of this embodiment, the monitoring and feedback system utilises a key-escrow arrangement. In such an implementatioru aU users of the system may be required to provide the system adininistrator(s) with a copy of a key used by the carrier for encryption/decryption. Decryption keys may be stored in a secure place, used only by the administrator(s)j and used only under specific circumstances, e.g., degradation of the user's key copy, under court order, under specific authorization of the user, etc.<br>
[0064] In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, the monitoring and feedback supports Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol^ which is a con:unonly-used protocol for managing the security of a message transnnssion over a network, e.g.^ the Internet. SSL uses a program layer located between thp Internet's Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Transport Control Protocol (TCP) layers. SSL is included as part ofboth the Microsoft and Netscape browsers and most Web server products. SSL uses the public-and-private key encryption system from Rivist-Shamir Aldeman (RSA) encryption and authentication system, which also includes the use of a digital certificate. Aitemativelyj or in addition, the monitoring and feedback system may support S-HTTP protocol.<br>
[0065] It should be appreciated that the data provided by the transportation vehicle data bus 1210 as well as any data provided by auxiliarj^ sensors 1260 may be compressed prior to transmission to the base-station HOC and storage in fiie memory buffer storage system 1270, Accordingly, it should be appreciated that the data may be compressed using either a lossy or lossless compression algorithm run by the processor 1250 base on mstructions stored in the operational memory 1220 under the direction of the controller 1240.<br><br>
[0066) It may be preferable for compression perfoimed on the data that 15 stored in the memory buffer storage system 1270 be performed using a lossy compression aigorithm whereas the same data is compressed losing a lossless compression algorithm prior to transmission to the base-Station. Such an implementation may be preferable, for example, when there is an increased interest in particularly accurate archival data stored at the base-station. Alternatively, it piay be preferable for compression performed on the data that is stored in the memory buffer storage system 1270 may be performed using a lossless compression algorithm whereas the salme data is compressed using a lossy compression algorithm prior to transmission to the base-station. Such an implementation may be preferable, for example, when the amount of bandwidth available fox transmission of data to the base-station is limited,<br>
[0067] Moreover, data may be compressed xising conventional data reduction technologies that transmit only a delta or change in a data parameter rather than resending the dita parameter itself. Such technologies may be particularly beneficial for implementation by thje on-vehicle component 1200 for transmittiagp for example^ video data. Conventional data reduction technology may involve extracting raw data from a data stream using, for example^ AIRJNC*^ 429 code conversion algorithms for traiisportation vehicles that are aircraft. When data reduction technology is implemented in the on-vehicle component 1200, liie base-station cqimponent 1100 may include modeling software and mathematical processing algorithms for converting this raw data into performance infonnation.<br>
[0068] Thus, in accordance with at least one embodiment of the iuventiorL, data trimsmitted between the transportation vehicle(s) and base station(s) may be compressed prior to triinsmission and decompressed subsequent to transmissiorL The compression/decompression may be implemented using various compression/decompression schemes. Although the compression/decompression may be implemented using a lossless or a lossy technique, lossless miay be preferred if data integrity is important. The compression may be used to reduce the size of data in order to save space or transmission time. For data transmission, compression can be pefcrfomied on just the data content or on the entire transmission unit (including header data) depending on a number of factors.<br>
[0069] In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, monitoring data may be transmitted to the base station(s), at which analysis is performed to determine^ for example, whether the vehicle is operating under acceptable and/or expected conditions, A|ltematively, data may be pre-processed on the transportation vehicle(s) so that only data associated with operational parameters that have not been met are transmitted to the base station-<br><br>
In such a situation, the transportation vehicle may traasmit data that indicates operational characteristics that have been identified. For example, a vehicle that is operating at an acceptable or expected speed biit an unacceptable or unex^pected fuel coiisx^mption, may only transmit information indicating that there is an unacceptable fuel consumption. The infonnation regarding the speed may be discarded, archived, or transmitted at a lesser fi-equency than the diata associated vnib. problematic parameter values. Such an embodiment may provide a reduced necessity to compress data because the amount of data transmitted to the base station(s) would be reduced.<br>
[0070] In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, transmission of data raay from die tran^ortation vehicle to the base station may be repeated multiple times, for example, five times. In such an embodiment ^^ data is analyzed to pick fi:om among the multiple sets of data to identify the best set of data for subsequent analysis and use in the monitoring and feedback system. This selection of ^1?esf' data may be performed in any nimiber of ways.<br>
[0071] For example, the determination may be based on one or more reasonable parameter ranges. Thus, for example, a set of data may include a plurality of monitoring and/or feedback parameters. One or more of these parameters m.ay be checked against corresponding parameter ranges that have been predetenrdned to contain reasonable or expected values. Based on whether the p3rameter(s) included in the data sets fall within the predetermined range, one or more data sets may be selected as being appropriate for subsequent use in analysis.<br>
[0072] Alternatively, the determination of which data set(s') is best may be based on previously received data. For example, a data set (prestmaably previously identified as being accurate or being the best &amp;om among a plurality of data sets) sent at time n may be compared •with the plurality of data sets transmitted at time n+L That is, one or more parameter valu£;s uiay be compared between time n and n+1 to determine whether the data is reasonable. Such a configuration wo^Jld allow the ability to determine whether the data set indicates too wide a fluctuation than is possible. For example, an aircraft speed at time n being reported as 425 mph but 756 mph at time n+L As an example of a data range of fluctuation between tictie n and n+1, aa aigorittmi may be set up to discount a data set "in which the speed parameter changes by, for example, more than 20%, or alternatively, for example, more than 50 mph. It should be understood that tune times at which data are sent may or may not be continuous; therefore, for ejcample, data may be transmitted, for example^ continuously, every 2 seconds, every minute, etc.<br><br>
[0073] A tbdxd option is to use a check siim to indicate the integrity of the data sets traasroitted between the transportation vehicle and the base station, A checksum is a coimt of the number of bits in a traBsmission unit that is included -with the unit so that the receiver can check to see whether the same number of bits arrived. For example j in the present sitoalion, the checksum cotild include the number of bits in one or more parameters or in an entire data set. If the counts match, it's assumed that the complete transmission was received. Both Transmission Coiatrol Protocol and User Datagram Protocol communication layers provide a checksum coimt and verification as one of their services.<br>
[0074] It is foreseeable that the on-vehicle component 1200 of the monitoring and feedback system 100 may be implemented in a general purpose computer, a special purpose computer and/or one or more Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), for example, a combination of ASIC and flash memory chips.<br>
[0075] It is foreseeable that the on-vehicle component 1200 may receive transportation vehicle data sent to the TVDR, if one is included on the vehicle, via the transportation vehicle ' data bus 1210. Subsequently^ the on-vehicle component 1200 of the system may transmit the flight data and store it in the memory bxjffer storage system 1270 illustrated in Fig. 2.<br>
[0076] The equipment incorporated in the on-vehicle component 1200 of the system may be powered either from a transportation vehicle specific source or independently using a miniiTTimi power consumption level. The duality of the real-time data storage on the transportation vehicle and at the base-station provides efficient, easily accessible and virmaUy instant data retrieval capabilities.<br>
[0077] The on-vehicle component 1200 may require no transportation vehicle operator monitoring at any time. In such an implementation, a transportation vehicle operator may be contacted by base-station personnel or an automated algorithm running at the base-$,tation only ■when transportation vehicle operation, perfomiance or condition criteria do not meet acceptable piiirameters. However^ it should be appreciated that a panel mounted display unit may be incorporated in the on-vehicle system component to provide status information to the crew. The triansportation vehicle data transmitted firom the on-vehicle component 1200 to the base-station 110 may be archived at the base-station 110 and processed to display the data in pre-determined formats to show transportation path profiles and transportation vehicle operation. Moreover, basic tnend monitoring may be performed to provide transportation vehicle fleet profile cpmparison analysis.<br><br>
[0078] As illustrated in Figure 3, the base-station 110 includes a base-station component 1100 of the monitoring and feedback system 100 tb-at may include, for example, a transceiver IIIO5 controller 1120, operational memory 1130, processor 1140, archival memory system 1150 and network interface 1160* All of the elements are operationally conpled together, i.e., coupled together in such a way that the elements may cooperate^ by a data/contxol/conimunication bns 1170.<br>
[0079] The transceiver 1110 provides the software and hardware for interfacing with the aittemia 140 illtistrated in Figure 1. Similarly to the transceiver unit 1280, the transceiver 1110 may be implemented, for example, using various communicadons technology such as. wireless technology including, e*g.j ceUular telephony, mdio, etc* It may be preferable for the transceiver 1110 to be configured to provide full duplex capability, that is, the ability to transmit and receive over antenna 140 simultaneously. Additionally, data transmission rates shall be dependent on the communications mediiim and available signal quality. Feedback data transmission may be performed using conventionally understood methods, for example, utilizing ACARS-VHF, the hatemet, WAP, and/or satellite transmissiorL<br>
[0080J It should be appreciated that the feedback data generated by the base-station component 1100 may be compressed prior to transmission from the base-station 1100 and storage in the archive^memory system 1150 using either a lossy or lossless compression algorithm.<br>
[0081] Moreover, data to be transmitted may be reduced using conventional data reduction technologies that transmit only a delta or change in a data parameter rather than resending the data parameter itself. Additionally; it is foreseeable that the feedback data may be encrypted prior to transmission to the transportation vehicle 110.<br>
[0082] The operational memory 1130 can be implemented using any appropriate combination of alterable^ volatile or non-volatile memory or non-alterable, or fixed^ memory. /my alterable memory, whether volatile or non-volatile, can be implemented using any one or more of static or dynamic RAM, a floppy disk and disk drive, a writable or re-rewritable optical disk and disk drive, a hard drive, flash memory or the like. Similarly, any non-alterable or fixed memory c&amp;a be implemented using any one or more of ROM, PROM, EPR.OM, EEPROM, an optical ROM disk, such as a CD*-ROM or DVD-B.OM disk, and disk drive or the like. The operational memory 1130 stores instmclions for operation of the on-vehicle component llOO.<br>
[0083] The controller 1120 controls operation and co-operation of the operational memory 1130, processor 1140, the archive memory system 1150 and the network interface<br><br>
1160. The processor 1140 works with the controller 1120 to control opexation and co-operation of the other elements 1110^ 1130,1150 and 1160. In co-operation with the controller 1120, the processor U40 fetches instructions &amp;om the operational memory 1130 and decodes thenx, which m$.y ca-use the processor 1140 to transfer data firom the operational memory 1130, to perform, for examplej decompression techniques or decryption techniques to decompress or decrypt data transmitted firom the on-vehicle component 1200^ or to store such data in the archive memory<br>
system 1150.<br>
[0084] Moreover, the processor 1140 may fetch instructions from the operational memory 1130 to perform analysis of data stored in the archive memory system 1150 so as to compare data received from the on-vehicle component 1200 with parameters to help ensure that thte transportation vehicle is operating, performing or is in a condition that is acceptable. For example^ the processor 1140 may determine whether a transportatiou vehicle is maintaining the path indicated by its travel plan, for example* a flight plan, anticipated roirte via road, or navigation plan, based on information received &amp;om the on-vehicle component 1200 and, for example, information &amp;om a GPS or LEO satellite.<br>
[0085] The archival memory system 1150 can be implemented using any appropriate combination of alterable, volatile or non-volatile memory or non-alterable, or fixed, memory. The alterable memory, whether volatile or uon-volarile, can be implemented using any one or more of static or d&gt;Tiainic RAI^^, a floppy disk and disk drive, a writable or re-rewritable opticed disk and disk drive, a hard drive, flash memory or the iUce. Similarly, the non-alterable or fixed r&amp;emory can be implemented using any one or more of ROM, PROM, EPROM, EEPROM^ an optical ROM disk, such as a CD-ROM or DVD*ROM disk, and dislc drive or the like.<br>
[0086] The archival memory system 1150 may be significantly large in size to store transportation vehicle data for both multiple trips by particular transportation vehicles and for iDnltiple transpoitation vehicles as well. Thus, the storage capability for the archival memory System 1150 may be many Gigabytes or larger.<br>
[0087] The network interface 1160 may provide access to additional information that may be used by base-station personnel or algorithms run via the processor 1140 on the base-station component 1100 of the monitoring and feedback system to determine weather a transportation vehicle is operating outside predetermined parameters. Such parameters may be set to help ensure that transportation vehicles operate in a safe manner, e.g.^ to avoid a potential accidents an efficient maimer^ e.g., for the purpose of fuel or time efficiency, an iixstracted' manner, e.e^„ when specific transportation vehicles should only operate at a specific speed.<br><br>
altitude^ etc. based on characteristics of the transportation vehicle and, for example, environmental conditions such as wind speed, prepipitation, temperature, turbulence, etc. The additional information provided vi^ the network interface 1160 may include meteorologicid information, routing information, traffic patterns, transportation path closures, Gtc, The network interface 1160 may provide access to a public and/or private communication network^ for axamplSj a wide area network, local area network, an Intranet, the Internet or any other private and/or public transportation network.<br>
[0088] The contxol/data/communication bus 1170 operationally couples all of the elements 1110-1170 together so that the on-vehicle component may store and transmit performance, operation and/or condition data to the base-station component.<br>
[0089] The controller 1120, operational memory 1130, processor 1140 and network interface 1160 may be implemented ia a PC work^totion with, for example, a Windows'^ operating system, proprietary data, processing software and video processing capabilities. Because standard transmission and data storage equipment may be used to implement the base-station component 1100 of the monitoring and feedback system, software/hardware updates and system maintenance can be p^ormed regularly and proficiently.<br>
[0090] One key feature of at least one of the embodiments of the invention is the resulting reliability of data collection and feedback analysis provided to transportation vehicle operators. With reliability comes dependability and accuracy.<br>
[0091] At least one of the embodiments of the invention is designed to workin conjunction with transportation vehicle recorders such as FDRs. The on-vehdcle component 1200 of the system in such an embodiment is specifically designed to capture data '""behind" the transportation vehicle recorders so as not to interfere with proven data collection environments. In this way, that embodiment works in conjunction with the transportation vehicle recorders instead of interfering with them.<br>
[0092] Moreover^ the on-vehicle component 1200 of the monitoring and feedback system 100 may be implemented with a minimum number of moving parts so as to rniniinize mechanical failure resulting from the inevitable erratic movement experienced by transportation vehicles 120- Additionally, at least ocie embodiment of the invention may be implemented such that any or all of the moving parts are, in effect, a backup system should the capability to transmit data from the transportation vehicle 120 to the base-station 110 be unavailable for some reason.<br><br>
[0093] Systems and methods designed in accordance with the embodiments of the mvention may be advantageously implemented mUx a transportation system that prevents transportation accidents, such as controlled flight into terrain (CFTT) accidents.<br>
[0094] The impacts of the embodiments on the passenger transportation industry are numerous. For example, with reference to w transportation, a study of 1,039 aircraft accidents talcen from the Aviation Accident Database between 1997 and 1999,22% were identified as the result of mechanical failure, 10% were due to sabotage and 20% were due to weather. According to this data, potentially 52% of large-scale aircraft casualties resulting in lost lives could have been avoided if equipment failures and v^eafher conditions could have been naonitored in real-time and actions could have been taken to correct the situation. According to the same study, 46% of the aircraft accidents v^^ere attributed to human error. Again, the potential for savings in lost lives is immeasurable, simply by recogoizing procedural or navigational errors before they result in objectionable and adverse results.<br>
[0095] Moreover^ the other benefits that nuiy conceivably result fi:om implementation of the embodiments of the invention are numerous,<br>
[0096] First, transportation vehicles implementing systems designed in accordance v^th the embodiments of the invention may be able to have systems customized by selectLng higher or lov^er data transmission rates, higher or lower data storage capacities in either or both on- • vehicle and base-station equipment, aixd selection of additional data analysis tools^ e.g., topographical data, weather data, etc. The operational memory 1130 of the base-station component 1100 and/or the operational memory 1220 of the on-vehicle component 1200 may include service profile data that may include, for example, (1) an indication of aparticulai* data transmission rate for commimicating on an up-link fiom the base-station to the transportation vehicle^ on a down-link &amp;om the transportation vehicle to the base-station, or both; (2) an amount of maximtnn data storage to be maintaiaed at the base-station for down-loading fi'om the transportation vehicle; (3) a selection of which transportation tools may be utilized in conjunction with analysis performed at the base-station on the data down-loaded by the transportation vehicle to the base-station.<br>
[0097] Moreover, it is foreseeable that a particular transportation vehicle's service profile may include identification of specific auxiliary sensors 1260 incorporated in the on-vehicle component 1200. It is foreseeable that at least one-hundied-and-fifty parameters may be monitored by the base-station 100. Therefore, the service profile may be customizable because^ for example, the transportation vehicle data bus 1210 incorporated within a transportation<br><br>
vehicle can be programmed to ejdxa^t whatever data set the on-vehicle component 1200 requests.<br>
{0098] This opportunity to customize implementation of a system designed in accordance "with the embodiments allows transportation vehicle operators to implement a scalable monitoring and feedback system at a lower cost while allowing for adding system options at some time subsequent to initial implementation of the system.<br>
{00991 Second, individtial, and non-commercial vehicle transportation operators presently without the means of providing their own base-station can effectively share these facilities and resources with other individual, and/or non-commercial vehicle ixansportation operators at an affordable cost.<br>
[00X001	Third, implementation of systems and methods designed in accordance<br>
with the embodiments may be quickly recognized by the insurance industry as a tool for ultimately reducing their payout risk. As result, transportation operators and carriers may have lower insurance premiums.<br>
[00101]	Fourth^ when the aviation industry introduces trans-polar flights,<br>
previously xmavailable flight route information will be immediately accessible. Presently; the polar regions are very poorly covered by high-quality communications, and extensive use is still made of HF. Data transmission for transportation vehicle tracking purposes is therefore poor. Access to an LEO transmission and communication facility will greatly improve polar region monitoring,<br>
[00102]	Although presently there are other known methods of capturing flij^t data<br>
iljformation^ most of these differ signiScantly from the embodiments of the invention because they do not consider real-time data transmission. Moreover^ these other systems are not directed at stoiing long term infbimation for the purposes of performing performance, operation and condition analysis of one or more transportation vehicles.<br>
[00103]	The embodiments of ihe invention may utilize a standard computer, video<br>
iand transceiver equipment, such as FAA-approved transceiver equipment, to monitor and relay data transmissions between transportation vehicles and base stations, as well as store these transmissions both on-vehicle and at the base-station for archival purposes.<br>
[00104]	Moreover, such archived data may be used for route cost proving, i.e., the<br>
ability to compare actual transportation vehicle performance, and therefore operating costs, against the predicted transportation vehicle economic model for the route hence providing a real time validation of predicted costs.<br><br>
[00105]	As mentioned above, the embodiments of the invendon may be used as a<br>
tool for aveiting transportation vehicle accidents^ Data transmitted in real-time to the base-station 110 from the transportation vehicle 120 may be monitored by base-station persoixnelj and/or automated and/or semi-automated base-5tatioB equipment. As a result, the base-station personnels and/or automated and/or semi-automated base-station equipment may identify any deviation of performance, operation or condition data from acceptable parameters more quickly. As a result, real-time monitoring of the performance, operation and condition of the transportation vehicle 120 by the base-station component 110 allows the identification and diagnosis of malfunction of equipment mcorporated in the transportation vehicle 110 a$ well as n'aiQsportation vehicle operator error.<br>
[00106]	Therefore, such monitoring provides the ability to provide real-time<br>
feedback to transportation vehicle operators. With such feedback comes an increased capability to minimize, correct, or compensate for potentially problematic scenarios on the transportation veihicle. The potential benefit of such monitoring and feedback capability may be readily appreciated if, for example, a fire has occuxred in a cargo hold of an aircraft or shipping vessel. By monitoring these areas, the system is able to provide information to allow transportation vehicle operators to take necessary steps to avert accidents.<br>
[00107]	As mentioned above, tEe embodiments of the invention may be tised as a<br>
tool for investigation of transportation vehicle accidents. In the event of a transportation vehicle accident, investigation may begin immediately because data lias been captured and stored realtime in an immediately accessible location. Thus, the dependency on a missing transportation vehicle recorders for accurate information is minimized.<br>
[00108]	As mentioned above, the embodiments of the invention may be used as a<br>
tool for profiling operation and performance of transportation vehicles.<br>
[00109]	The embodiments of the invention may receive performance, operation<br>
atid condition data from existing sensor ou^uts^ e.g., existing flight sensors in an aircraft as well a$ the Flight Management System (FMS). However, although not required for implementation oif all of the embodiments of the invention disclosed herein, the on-vehicle component 1200 of the monitoring and feedback system may incorporate auxiliary sensors 1260. Thxis, sensors may be incorporated within and on the exterior of the transportation vehicle. Such sensors may iaclude, but are not limited to, sensors for monitoring v^d sheer» lift, cross-winds, pitch, roll, etc., for aircraft, water temperature, pitchy roU, etc, for watercraft, speed, momentum^ braiing<br><br>
efficacy, etc. for land-based vehicles, or an^^ other cLaracteristic that may be indicative of environmental effects on a transportation vehicle.<br>
[OOllO]	In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
monitoring and feedback system may also inclnde a database of rules developed in part and/or used by Axtificiai Intelligence (AI) in the form of an expert system incorporated in the transportation vehicle momtormg, feedback and control system to create a system that may automatically respond to or display helpful assistance to event(s) that have occurred based on arohived information indicating at least one previous occurrence of the event(s) and the action(s) that were previously taken in response. For example, the archived information may include information indicating a past occurrence of a particular event or set of events and the action or set of actions that were initiated by a pilot of the same transportation vehicle, type of transportation vehicle, or a similar transportation vehicle^ to successfully respond to that event or set of events, match, the presently occurring situation. Similarly, the archived information may irjiClude information indicating a past occurrence of a particular event or set of events and the action or set of actions that were initiated by a pilot of the same transportation vehicle, type of transportation vehicle, or a similar transpoitation vehicle, that were xmsuccessful in responding to that event or set of events.<br>
:	[00111]	Further, the event or set of events need not be completely identical to a<br>
previous event or set of events. Rather, the previous event or set of events need only be sufficiently sunilar to be relevant. One measure of similarity may be provided by determining how many factors are variable in the present scenario and determining how many of the variable factors have identical or sufficiently simil£ir values, A determination of whether a variable factor has a present value that is sufficiently similar to a past value may be made be comparing the present value with the past value to determine whether the present value is within a predetermined acceptobie variation range firom the past value, For example, if the variable factor is 20,000 feet altitude, a predetermined acceptable variation range may be 19^500 to 20j500 feet altitude. Therefore, if archived scenario information indicates a scenario in which the altitude is 20,000 feet, than a present value of the altitude should be between 19,500 and 20,500 feet to be deemed sufficiently similar to the previous value of 20,000 feet for the piarposes of determining similarity of scenario.<br>
[00112]	The expert system may generate or tise rules formulated based on<br>
archived scenario information. For example, such rules may be formulated based on measured parameters obtained either directly or inferentially, by examining active devices and components<br><br>
based on simulated evolution and using algorithms to determine the best response for one or more components of the vehicle to respond to.<br>
(00113]	Such an expert system may learn (e.g., acqiire inforaiation and roles for<br>
using the information), reason (e*g., use the rules to reach approximate or definite coixcltisions)^ and perform self-cotrection. Such an expert system may be implexnented in, for example, one or mote computer programs that simulate the judgement and behavior of a human or an organization that has expert knowledge and experience operation of a particular transportation vehicle^ a particular type of transportation vehicle, various groups of transportation vehicles, generally or in specified sooxmio^, e.g., electrical storms^ high winds, low visibilit}', extreme turbulence^ etc.<br>
[00114]	The expert system may include or utilize a knowledge base containing<br>
accumulated experience and a set of rules for applying the knowledge base to new situations. Some part or all of the knowledge base containing accumulated experience may be included in the archived scenario information. Alternatively, the knowledge base containing accumulated experience may include some part or all the archived scenario infonnatioix. The set of rules for applying the knowledge base to new situations may include rules indicating how the knov/ledge base is applied to new situations by includuag rules indicating how the knowledge base is applied to each parfciciilar situation that is described.<br>
[00115]	Tlie one or more computer programs may use previously determined rules<br>
based on natural selection, crossover, and mutation to arrive at a solution that best satisfies the situation the vehicle finds itself in at that present time. This information may be used as an alert either aurally, visually or to manage the vehicle based on previously stored data retrieved by event and value. Alerts may be generated based on industry supported parameters; for example, if a transportation vehicle is operating outside of generally accepted parameters, an alert may be generated to the vehicle crew and/or base station or other personnel. The present situation and result may tiien be input into the archived information to build the database for fixture use by either the same vehicle or any other similar vehicle on the same neural network. Over time, a number of above-average solutions increases, and better-fit solutions may be created, until a good solution to the problem at hand is found.<br>
[00116]	As a result, at least one embodiment of the invention provides a<br>
laavigation system that includes an expert system that collects, stores and analyzes scenario data associated with operation of one or more transportation vehicles. Analysis may include<br><br>
forraulatiou of expert system rules used to cinalyze liie scenario data, and additional scenario data collected during further operatiorL of the one or more transportation vehicles.<br>
[00117]	It shoxild be appreciated that, such expert systems may be used to assist iri<br>
or control operation of one or more transportation vehicles after a period of time that allows the expert system to become sufficiently adept at assistiag or controlling transportation vehicle operation. For example, a set of operation controlled by a pilot of a Boeing 747 aircraft, flying from Atlanta to Washington, D.C., may be stored using a na^/igation system according to one embodiment of the invention. Subsequently, that set of operations may be used to suggest operations to a pilot of that aircraft or anotlaer Boeing 747 aircraft from Atlanta to Washington, D.C. Moreover, a set of operations controlled by many pilots in a particular plane^ or type of plane on a particular route may be used to formulate suggested operations to a pilot of that plane or type of plane.<br>
[00118]	In accordance -with at least one embodiment of the invention^ the<br>
navigation system, including an expert system, may be configured to operate as a warning system under a transportation vehicle crew's control. Such a system may be configured to provide suggested operations or sets of operations via, audio, visual^ or audiovisual messaging. Thus, the navigation system may include^ and the expert^ system may control or be coupled to, for example, one or more speakers, one or more video screens, one or more graphical user iiiterfaces, etc.<br>
[00119]	In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, die<br>
navigation system, including an expert system, may be configured to initiate conective control operation of one or more traixsportation veiiicles. For example, if the expert "system determines that one or more operations toitiated by the crew of the transportation vehicle would be inadvisable, the expert system may be configured to prohibit that operation and/or initiate an alternative more ad\isable operation. Alternatively, or in addition, if the expert system detsrmines that one or more operations shotild be initiated by the crew of the transportation vehicle, tiie expert system luay be coufigured to initiation those operations.<br>
[00120]	In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
rtavigation system, includiag an expert system, may be configured to solely control operation of one or more transportation vehicles- In such an embodiment, the navigation system may also include vision and various oth^ systems for remote vehicle control using, for example, neural and cellular networks and evolutionary computation-<br><br>
(00121]	Sxich embodimeuts may be used in an aircraft experiencing various<br>
expected or imexpected scenarios. For example, when an aircraft encoimters turbulence^ the system may be able to provide the aircraft with archived scenario information, one or more possible operations to be initiated, one ox more sets of possible operations to be initiated, etc. These suggested or possible operations may be formulated based on previously archived scenarios that are similar to one presently being experienced by the aircraft. For example, a same or similar degree of turbulence may have been experienced by the same aircraft, a same type of aircraft or a similar type of aircraft As a result, the expert system could provide suggested operation(s) to handle the present scenario. Alternatively, the expert system could control the aircraft to some extent to either initiate or prohibit certain operation(s) based on the archived scenario information and any operation rules based on that previoa'Sly archived scenario information. For example^ the expert system may recogni2e that, based on the previously archived scenario information, and the characteristics of the present situation sensed by, for example, on-board sensors, the flaps may be adjusted in a specific manner to minimize the jerldness felt during turbulence making the flight smoother.<br>
[00122]	As another example, suppose an aircraft experiences a tire blow out on<br>
talce-off. By virtue of implementing an embodiment of the invention, the crew members and/or ground personnel (e.g., base station personael and other individuals and organizations associated with the operation, maintenance and safety of the transportation vehicle) have access to previous mfonn3n.on on similar situations for the same or a similar model aircraft with similar payloads. This archived scenario infortnation may have been provided by implementing an embodiment'of the invention to at least monitor the operation of this or other transportation vehicles,<br>
[00123]	As a result, the crew and groxmd personnel may have access to the<br>
scenario information that indicates transfportationvehicle configurations at landing for previous scenarios, including^ for example, results, flaps aisles, speed of aircraft^ type of aircraft^ destination of aircraft, spoiler configurations, weather conditions and a host or other relevant information on the actions taken in previous takeofis. The crew and/or ground persoimel may also have access to suggested operalion(s) to be undertaken in the present scenario to address the present issue(s).<br>
[00124]	Such an expert system used in combination with a transportation vehicle<br>
has various areas of utility which are not limited to use m aircraft For example, suppose a ship out on the ocean hits an object, thus rupturing ibe hull. As a result of the rupture, the ship is taking on water and listing to the port side. By virtue of implementing an embodiment of the<br><br>
inventiorL, the ship crew members and/or other off-ship personnel (e.g., coast guard persomiel, hai'bor masters, and/or other individuals and organizaiions associated with, the operation^ maintenance and safety of the transpoitation vehicle) have access to previous infomiatioii on similar situations for the same or a similar model ship with similar payloads.<br>
[00125]	This archived scenarj-o information may have been provided by<br>
implementing an embodiment of the invention to at least monitor the operation of this or other traospoitation vehicles. As a result, the crew and/or o&amp;ship personnel may have access to the scenario information that indicates transportation vehicle operations that may be taken to remedy the large amount of water being talcen on, the listing of the ship, or any resulting environmental de^adation occurring as a result of a collision for previous scenarios, including, for example, results, ballast tank operations, speed of the transportation vehicle, type of ship, size of ship, location of ship&gt; motor configurations, amount of cargoj location of cargo, amount of fuel^ weather conditions and a host or other relevant information on the actions talcen in previous collision scenarios. The crew and/or off-ship personnel may also have access to suggested operation(s) to be undertalcen in the present scenario to address the present issue(s).<br>
[00126]	Implementing an embodiment of the invention including an expert system<br>
may also allow a pilot approaching an airport for the first time in inclement weather to access a cdculated landing based onprevibus experiences for similar aircraft in similar conditions. By \'irtu6 of implementing an embodiment of the invention, the pilot and other crew members aiid/'or other ground personnel may have access to previous information on similar situations for the same or a similar model plane at this particular aiq^orL<br>
[00127]	This archived scenario information ipay have been provided by<br>
implementing an embodiment of the invention to at least monitor the operation of this or other planes. As a result, the crew and/or ground personnel may have access to the scenario mformation that indicates transportation vehicle operations that may be taken to safely na\dgate the plane into the airport for previous scenarios, including, for example, results, speed of the aircraft, decent, type of plane^ identity of plane, time of day^ size of plane, age of plane, weight of plane, number of passengers, location of cargo, amount of fuel, weather conditions and a host or other relevant information on the actions taken in previous landing scenarios. The crew and/or ground persoxmel may also have access to suggested operation(s) to be undertaken in the present scenario to address the present issue(s).<br>
[00128]	Such a navigation and monitoring system may also be implemented to<br>
control the operation of the transportation vehicle to some extent. For example, the system may<br><br>
be used in a situation in wHch a public transport vehicle experience a tire blowout. In accordance -with at least one embodiment of the invention, the system may be configured to automatically formulate braking and steering operations that would most likely bring tbie vehicle to a stop whilst restricting the driver fi:om maHng fatal mistakes like braking too hard. By vhtue of irnplementing an embodiment of the mvention, the system may have control to initiate specific actions and to prohibit specific actions based on previously archived scenario information on similar situations for the same or a similar transportation vehicles. As a result, an operator of the vehicle may be guided or constrained by the operation of the system ba^ed on pasit experience that was learned by the expert system.<br>
[00129}	This archived scenaiio information may have been provided by<br>
implementing an embodiment of the invention to at least monitor the operation of this or other transportation vehicles. As a result^ the vehicle operator, and his/her passengers, may benefit from, the experience of other operators using previously archived scenario information that indicates transportation vehicle operations that may be taken to bring transportation vehicles to a s£ife stop in previous scenarios, including, for example^ results, speed of the transportation vehicle, type of transportation vehicle, size of transportation vehicle, location of vehicle, inclination of the surface or surfaces on widch the vehicle is driving, number of passengers, number of tires, type of tires^ amount of in'Qation of tires, braking speedy steering angle or angles, amount of fuel, weather conditions and a host or other relevant information on the actioiis taken in tii^ blow out scenarios.<br>
[00130]	Similarly, personal cars may be fitted to include a sy.5tem designed in<br>
accordance with an embodiment of the veidcle monitoring and feedback system. For example, a car monitored by such a system, on encount^ing an ice patch, may be controlled under the giiidance of the system such that the system automatically references similar instances on the same road or a similar road when cars of a same or a similar type and configuration encountered the situation, and may, based on present environmental conditions, formulate and initiate action to stabilize the car. Similarly, suppose an aircraft looses its engines and is forced to make an emergency landing over water. If such an aircraft is monitored by a s^^stem designed in accordance with one of the embodiments of the invention, the system may formulate one or more best possible angles of dissent for the aircraft based on references with previous instances and weather conditions and present configurations and assist the pilot to make a safe landing.<br>
[00131]	It should be understood that any expert system explained above may be<br>
ictaplemented using a combination of opersition memory 1220. controller 1240, processor 1250,<br><br>
anxiliaiy sensors 1260, memory buffer storage sj^stem 1270 illustrated in Fig. 2^ among other features, if necessaiy. Additionally, the exj:&gt;ert system may also, or altemativelyj use the operational memory 1130, controller 1120, processor 1140 and archive memory system 1150 illustrated in Fig. 3, among other features, if necessary.<br>
[00132]	In accord^ce with at least one embodiment of the invention the<br>
monitoring and feedback system is compatable with the Bluetooth industry specification, which is a computing and telecommuoicaiions industry specification that describes how mobile phones, computers, and personal digital assistants interconaect with each other and with home and business phones and computers using a short-range wireless connection. Thus, passengers' mobile phones, computers, personal data assistants^ pagers and other personal computing and telecommunication equipment may be.<br>
[00133]	Additionally, it is foreseeable that the on-vehicie component 1200 may be<br>
co:afigured to allow for a technician to transfer data from the on-vebicle component to a hand held device using a Bluetooth or other wireless transfer protocol or technology. Such a hand held device may include analysis software that may allow for the analysis of data transferred from the on-vehicle component 1200, e.g., some or all of the analysis performed in the base staition component 1100.<br>
:        [00134]	In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, the on-board<br>
component includes a network, e.g,, a local area network or virtual area network, which allows, fox example, cooperation, communication and interaction of components of the on~board component, including sensors and interfaces, as well as other on-boird equipment. In such an implementation passengers may have access to the capabilit}^ of printing out elect:"0nic mail,   -sending and receiving faxes, sending and receiving e-mail, browsing public or private networks, etc., via personal data assistants, personal computers, phones, pagers, xiser interfaces built into the transportation vehicle, or any other device located on-board the transportation vehicle(s).<br>
[00135]	At least one embodiment of the invention may be used in combination<br>
with or include hardware, software and functionality associated with video-on-demand capability. That is, the transportation vehicle may be equipped with equipment to allow passengers on the transportation vehicle to be exposed to (e.g., view or listen to) uploaded data      f such as, for example, television shows, nev/spapers^ books&gt; movies, audio programs, e.g., music, raiiio, etc., at their discretion. This data may be provided in one or more memory devices on the transportation vehicle. For example, an aircraft may include one or more memory units that are<br><br>
configured to store a plurality, e.g., 300, movies, for passengers of the aircraft to watch at their<br>
discretioix, for e&gt;:am.pie, for a fee.<br>
(00136]	The audio-video data stored on the transportatioii vehicle may be updated<br>
ov€5r time to provide new and/or more timely data for ie\ne\y by the passengers. This updating may be performed by transmirttag data frorii an audio-video data source to the transportation vehicle when the vehicle is not in use. However, such a data link may not be possible, for example, when an aircraft is too close to an airport, it is possible that the comxnumcation signal with the base statioii(s) may be weakened, reduced or lost Therefore, this updatiog may alternatively be performed by a technician accessing the memory units to provide new audio-video data in the transportation vehicle dat^L, e.g,, by ustQg a uotebook computer, Psrsoxial Data Assistant (PDA). This technician could also access memory 1270 on the transportation vehicle that store monitoring (previously transmitted to the base ^tion(s)) and feedback data (previously received from the base $tation(s)), as discussed elsewhere in this specification.<br>
[00137]	By periodically accessmg the previous monitoring and feedback data, the<br>
system may be provided with another mechanism to ensure that all data is beiag communicated to and from the transportation vehicle, which may or may not be an issue. For example, it is possible that crew of either a transportation vehicle or a base station may not appreciate that a commnnication link has been lost during ti'ansmission of data. Although the monitoring and feedback systems designed in accordance fmih at least one embodiment of the invention may include mechaoisms for detemiming when a link has been lost and re-establishing the commucucaiion link, the ability to access on-board memory includmg, for example^ the p^e^ao^ls week's monitoring and feedback data, would allow an archive of data stored, for example, at the base station(s) or a centraliaid archive, to include the most complete data possible. Such a centralized archive of data may be implemented at one or more secure facilities, e.g., for the puijDOse of disaster recovery and redundancy of service data. By storing identical data at more than one location, the likelihood of losnig access to that data at any given point of time is decreased,<br>
[00138]	Alternatively^ or hi addition, the on-transportation vehicle audio-video<br>
data memory may be supplemented with the ability to %dew other audio-video data, e.g., obscure mo\'ies5 Ksted in sn on-boaid index;, and uploadable via an uplink signal from, for example, the base station(s) and/or one or more supplemental audio-video data support station(s). This uplink signal may be the same uplink signal that is used to provide feedback information from the base station{s) to the transportation vehicle. ID. such an implementation^ the data to be uploaded for<br><br>
video-on-demand may be compressed and^ optionally, interleaved witli the feedback data provided from the base station(s).<br>
[00139]	In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
hardware located on a plurality of transportation vehicles is identical, for example, the equipment used on all aircraifc's is identical, all aircraft owned by a particular earner is identical or on a particular model of aircraft is id^tical. In this way, faulty equipment may be swapped for iully functional equipment with ease because of standardizatiotL Moreover, particular se(rvices, such as continuous momtoring of flight paih and in-flight parameters, requested by the operator, for example, a pilot or airline canier, associated with a particular transportation vehicle may be easily and efficientiy loaded into the standard hardware. Thus, standard hardware may be used by technicians to configure custom systems and service packages for particular transportation vehicles in an effective manner. During such a config:aration, hardware (having a unique identification data) and an associated service package for the transportation vehicle axe associated with the vehicle in the monitoring and feedback data system archives, e.g,, the hardware and service package are associated with a 'tail number" of an aircraft^ a vehicle identification number on an automobile, etc.<br>
'	[00140]	Subsequent to configuration, operators of the transportation vehicles<br>
pilots, carriers, dispatchers, etc.) can monitor which transportation vehicles fhey choose and which parameters associated with those transportation vehicles they choose.<br>
[00141]	It should be understood that, with reference to any of the embodiments of<br>
the invention, transportation vehicle operators may use the monitored data for their own use. Thus, it is possible that the invention may be used to monitor operation of transportation vehicles and provide a platform that allows a canier to provide feedback to crew of the transportation vehicle. Therefore, it should be understood that, the carrier may utilize its ovm personnel to provide feedback services to the transportation vehicle based on monitored parameters of the transportation vehicles' operation. This monitoring inforxDation may be provided, for example, using landiines, following receipt of the momtoring information by one or more base station(s). Further, the carrier (an organization with a plurality of transportation vehicles in a fleet, e-g,^ an air line, a tmcldng company, a shipping company etc.) may check on specific transportation vehicles, vehicle models, operators, etc. For example, the carrier may check on specific aircraft, aircraft xnodels, operators, e.g^, pilots, crew, geographic regions (e.g.^ xa case of locaii2ed weather), etc. It should be understood that, if data is being commxmicated to carriers, that the each carrier may have a carrier-specific encryption scheme that allows only<br><br>
fhem, or them and the system operators, access to that data. Alternatively, encryptioa schemes may be specific to mdividixal operators, e.g.^ private pilots.<br>
[00142]	In accordance with at least.one embodiment of the invention^ different<br>
transmission ftequencies may be used for differexit types of transportation vehicles^ for example, aircraft may transmit data in a different frequency range Ihan both shipping vehicles and azitomotive vehicles. In this way, data transmitted ixom tbese vehicles may differentiated from ear^b other and routed to the appropriate system components and/or hidiistry-speoific base st^tion(s). Alternatively, or in addition, information indicating the type of transportation vehicle may be included in headers associated with packet information transmitted to and from the transportation vehicle(s). Further, private encryption keys may be associated with particular operators, carriersj vehicle types or industries to ensure that data associated with, for example, a commercial freight tmcldng organization's fleet is not confused vath data associated with or accessed by a commercial, international aii'line. It should he appreciated that Ihese private keys may be static or dynamically changed on a periodic, e.g,, monthlyj quarterly, or yearly, basis,<br>
[00143 J	At least one embodiment of the invention may be utilised in conjiihotion<br>
with simulator trakiing of transportation vehicle personnel. For example, by recording and aLTchiving the parameters associated with transportation vehicle accidents, the data may be used to simulate potentially detrimental situations in a simulator environment for personnel training. For example, if monitored and archived data associated with a previous aircraft accident indicated that an aircraft suffered from the adverse consequences of certain events, e.g,, high cross winds, a failed engine and poor visibility, the circumstances may be identically reproduced iu a simulator setting for training of personnel.<br>
[00144]	Further, if data ttansmitted from a transportation vehicle indicates that the<br>
vehicle crew are unable to perform theh duties, e.g., due to illness, accident or equipment malfunction, the data received from the vehicle ia real-time or near-real-time may be used to override the controls of the vehicle. Subsequentiy&gt; the vehicle may be operated remotely using a simulator. In such a situation, video data from a camera on board the vehicle may be used to steer the vehicle, e,g., for a landing (e.g,, airciafr), docking (e.g., shipping or other v<issel or stopping train automobile truck etc. such a remote operation capability may be beneficial for example if an airline cockpit is filled with smoke so that the crew cannot read gauges monitors to operate plane engineer becomes incapacitated due illness driver mis asleep at wheel it possible transportation vehicles></issel><br>
operated remotely or oral instructions or an alert may be generated to assist the transportation vehicle crew in safe operatioiL<br>
[00145]	It should be understood that the data monitored on the transportation<br>
vehicle may be digital data and/or analog data. Thus, the monitoring and feedback system may be implemented with transportation vehicles that utilize analog data meters^ e.g., older air craft which may not include an FDR, automotive transportation (e.g., cars, trucks^ tractor trailers,<br>
etc.), trains, ships, etc.<br>
[00146]	The data transmitted firom the transportation vehicle(s) may be stored in a<br>
database and processed or analyzed using visual basic application for monitoring and analysis. Alternatively, the d^ita may be analyzed and stored in any manner; however^ it may be preferable to store and analy2e the data using a widely accepted or standard data format.<br>
[00147]	In accordance vdUx at least one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
monitoring and feedback system may utilize GPS technology to accurately identify a position of a transportation vehicle(s) continuously, periodically and/or upon an explicit request to do so,<br>
[00148]	In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
monitoring and feedback system may utilize GPS or other location tracking data to determine speed of the transportation vehicle. Such a capability may be beneficial to self-regulate tiansporTation vehicle operators and crew to ensure that they are not exceeding a maximum legal limit. Alternatively, such an indication of speed naay be used to determine whether a transportation vehicle is experiencing traffic congestion, e.g., a traffic jam on a highway experienced by a truck driver, experiencing inclement weather conditions, e.g., a localized hail stoim, or is suffering from equipment problems.<br>
[00149]	ha accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention^ the<br>
monitoring and feedback system njiay be configured to compare location data associated with one or more transportation vehicles with maps, e.g., road mapSj to determine a travel route of one or more transportation vehicles.<br>
[00150]	Thus, following a determination that a particular transportation vehicle is<br>
operating at a speed that is slower than expected (based on, for example, an indicated GPS position and a previously known speed limit at that position)^ the monitoring and feedback system may react by performing various actions. This determination may take into account the fact that a nransportation vehicle may be stopped at an intersection or stopped completely; therefore^ the average speed of a vehicle may be compared with a range of speeds^ e.g., X 
 <br>
Speed 
[00151]	The momtoring and feedback system may then deterxoine if other<br>
monitored traiisportation vehicles are traveling near (based on some predetermined distance metric) the slowly moving transportation veMcle, Subsequently, the system may determine whether transportation vehicles traveling along the same route as the slowly moving vehicle are also traveling slowly. If so, the monitoring and feedback system may, for example, query the transportation vehicle operator(s) moving slowly to determine why they are moving slowly. This reason may be due to^, for example, a traffic jam or locahzed inclement weather. Following a deteimination of why the vehicles are moving slowly, the monitoring and feedback system may convey alert information to other transportation vehicles which may soon experience the cati^e of the delay, i.e., they are moving toward the area where vehicles are moving slowly. This alert xoay be provided automatically as a broadcast only to identified, monitored, transportation vehicles. This alert may be supplemented ^vith information on alternative travel routes that may avoid delays.<br>
[00152]	Alternatively, following a determination ihat more than one transportation<br>
vehicle is mo\'ing slowly within a geographic area, a weather service may be referred to determine whether that area is experiencing inclement weather. Therefore, it may not be necessary to contact the slowly moving trau^ortation vehicles to determine the reason for the decreased speed. That is, a determination may be made that the slow rate of speed is due to traffic congestion if there is not inclement weather reported by the weather service,<br>
{O0IS3]	Further^ following a determination that more than one transportation<br>
vehicle is moving slowly withia a geograpliic area, a service reporting status of pending road work may be referred to determine whether that area is undergoing constructiotL Therefore, it may not be necessary to contact The slowly moving transportation vehicles to determine the reason for the decreased ^eed. That is, a detemiination may be made that the slow rate of speed is due to traffic congestion based on the information from the status reporting service.<br>
[00154J	Additionally, the monitoririg and feedback system may refer to both a<br>
weather service and a road construction status service prior to contacting the slowly moving transportation vehicles' operators or to alerting other transportation vehicles.<br>
[00155]	If it is detemuned tliat a particular txaosportation vehicle is operating<br>
below an expected speed, but no other proximate transportation vehicles are experiencing similar decreased sneeds. the monitorina and feedback svstem mav automatically, semi-<br><br>
automatically or at the request ot a system operator, access mamxenance recoras lo aexennme whether the transportatioia vehicle has a histoi^^ of operation problems. Alternatively &gt; or ia addition the system may automatically, seroi-automatically, or at the discretion of a system operator, contact the vehicle operator to offer assistance based on the detected and isolated slow rate of travel and/or based on a known history of operation problems.<br>
[00156]	At least ozie embodiment of the invention may be used to enforce<br>
ntiandatoiy rest reqxnxements for operators of transportation vehicles. For example, a government or a particular carrier may have mandatory prescribed rest periods to ens-ure that their vehicle operators are not mentally or physically fatigued. The monitoring and feedback system may monitor an amount of time th^it a transportation velucle is operated mthin a specific period and alert the operator and/or carrier when prescribed rest is required. Moreover, archived data indicating whether or not a carrier's operators are following prescribed rest-reqxnrements may be used to improve insurance premiuisis paid by the carrier on its vehicles, show regulatory compliance etc. It is foreseeable that a transportation vehicle may include a profile of opexator(s) associated with the transportation vehicle. Therefore, in the case of a tractor trailer operated by a pair of individuals, the on-board component may be configured to recognize which operator is operating the transpoitation vehicle. Alternatively^ the on and/or off-board components may simply recognize that prescribed rest peripd monitoring may not be effectively performed for transportation vehicles operated by more than one operator on a given vehicle trip.<br>
(00157]	In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, the system<br>
base station(s) may detect when a transportation vehicle's on-board component is not operating efiectiveiy. For example, the base $tation(s) may detect when an on-board component has been tampered with, e^g., because the base station(s)'receipt of a signal that is continuously or periodically transmitted from the on-board component is interrupted. Such a signal may include a data signature that is proprietary to the system or is specific to the particular on-board component.<br>
[00158]	Additionally, in accordance with at least one embodiment of the<br>
invention, if an on-board component is malfunctioning in some way, a data signature may indicate the maMinctioning to the base station(s). Thus, the on-board component may include self diagnostic hardware and/or software that allows the on-board component to recogrdze when, for example, specific sensors are not operational or malfunctioning, whether other parts of the<br><br>
on-board component are xnalfunctioimig, or the on-board component has been tampered with. ' This self-diagnostic information may then be transmitted to tie base station(s).<br>
[00159]	One or more operational parameters of a monitored trartsportation vehicle<br>
may be monitored at various rates, for example, one or more operation parameters may be monitored ten times a second, once a seoond, ten times a minute, once every ten minutes, etc., a^d stored in a memory buffer (e.g., a First In First Out buffer). Each of the monitored operation parameters may be transmitted at the same or a lower rate to the base station(s). For example, the monitored data may be pre-procegsed on board the transportation vehicle, as explained elsewhere in this specification. The monitored operation parameters may also be si:ored on board the transportation vehicle for the dxiration of a vehicle's immediate operation-fbr example, an aircraft's flight, a train's operation until it reaches its destination, etc. At that time, the data may be transmitted to a long term memory on the transportation vehicle until such time that a technician accesses and download that data, as explained elsewhere in this<br>
Specification*<br>
[00160]	In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
tnonitoring and feedback system may be used to detect theft of a transportation vehicle and recover the transportation vehicle. For example, the location of the transportation vehicle may be monitored based on, for example, GPS technology or other technology allowing traoldjig of the transportation vehicle. Following some indication that the transportation vehicle has been stolen, e.g., a telephone call from the operator of the transportation velticle, the monitoring and feedback system may be used to locate thai transportation vehicle for reacquisition. Alternatively, or in addition^ the monitoring and feedback system may be configured to provide some degree of remote control of the transportation vehicle so that vehicle may be rendered non-operational. Such a configuration may involve including a remote activated "kill switch".<br>
[00161]	In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, the auxiliary<br>
sensors 1260 may include sensors coufigm-ed to determine quantity and location of cargo including, luggage and passengers. For example^ in passenger transportation vehicles, sensors may be included in seats that indicate the presence of a passenger. Additionally, for passenger ships, sensors may be included in cabins or bunks to indicate the presence of passenger(s). Such information may be beneficial for accident recovery, for example, to indicate how many passengers were on an aircraft, in a train car, etc. These sensors may determine whether a passenger is sitting in the seat at a time when all passengers must be seated, for example, at take off of an aircraft. Alternatively, or in addition, the sensors may determine whether a passenger<br><br>
is sittmg in the seat when, for example, a train leaves a traia station, or periodically during operation of the transportation vehicle. This infonnation may be useful ia determining relative capacity of a transportatioji vehicle during operation over a given route.<br>
[00162]	Additionally, sensors may be included in cargo bays that indicate the<br>
presence, quantity (size and/or weight), and location of cargo.<br>
[00163]	In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
tratnsportation vehicle may include passenger iuterfaces, e.g., located at each seat on a transportation vehicle, that allow a passenger to initialize, and/or, maintain, update and/or utilize a personalized passenger profile,<br>
[00164]	Such a profile may include, for example, identificatioii data associated<br>
with the passenger, e.g., name, address, frequent flyer number, frequent traveler number^ company affiliation^ language spoken, dietary preferences or restrictions, health issues (e.g-., dijabetesj epilepsy, etc.), medicatioiis, allergies, data associated with an account that the traveler has with the transportation vehicle carrier, movie "choiceSp elecnonic-niail account informatiori, information indicating previous trips on transportation vehicles, musical tastes, preferred ambient temperature, etc* Based on this itiformatioii, a user may access on-board electronic mail<br>
r<br>
capability to, for example, check their electronic mail accounts, view movies or read books available in a repository of data stored on board the transportation vehicle or available via a liok with off-board repositories (as explained elsewhere in this apphcation), check stock market information, etc. It should be appreciated that data communicated by a passenger via the onboard component's communication liuk(s) may be encrypted m any number of ways and at the discretion of the passenger to protect the pa5senger(s)' privacy.<br>
[00165]	Additionally, some or all of the crew may have limited access to<br>
information included in. the passenger(s) profile to pirovide improved service to the passenger(s) ■ by, for example, spealdng to the passenger in their native language without having to determine what language that may be, recognizhig health concerns earlier based on ioformation that a passenger may not be able to convey (e.g., when a passenger has slipped into a diabetic coma), etc.<br>
[00166]	A passenger and their passenger profile may be associated with a<br>
particular seat, cabin, compartment or bunk on the transportation vehicle by assignment o£ for example, a ticketing agent that assigns the seats and provides this information to the monitoring and feedback system. Alternatively, passengers may have personalized identification data and passwords that they may key into a console at or near their seat<br><br>
[00167]	Fxirfher, the passengers may have identification cards ox keys, tor<br>
example, smart cards, that may be inserted, scanned or otherwise read by a reader that reads the identification data off the card and accesses associated information stored in a repository, eitlier on or off board, or reads the passenger's profile data off the card as well.<br>
[00168]	Moreover, the cards or keys may be both readable and v^Titable in that the<br>
reader included at the system may also have the capability to write data to the card or key, if the passenger profile data is stored on the card or key.<br>
[00169]       ' "In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, one or more sehsors and components may have unique IP addresses associate with each of them. Such an implementation may allow system operations and processes to imiquely identify the sensors and components to better enable communication, interaclion and cooperation. For example, each seat may have an IP address associated with it and any associated passenger presence sensor, passenger interface, etc. Similarly, for passenger ships, e.g., cruise ships, an IP address may be associated with each passenger cabin, bunk, etc.<br>
[00170]	la accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, passengers<br>
may be optionally exposed (e.g,j at their discretion) to stored or broadcast audio-video pnogramming. The broadcast audio-video programming may be interleaved with other data on communication link(s) to the transportation vehicle. In at least one implementation of this embodiment, a carrier operating one or more transportation vehicles may be able to optionally expose passengers to customisied programming provided, for example, daily, twice daily, etc., by the monitoring and feedback system's on-board component receiving that programming via the communication link(s) with the transportation vehicle. In accordance with at least one eUabodiment of the invention the on-board component of the transportation vehicle may be configured to mterface with mobile phones, computers, personal data assistants and other    " personal computing and telecommunication equipment to allow passengers to utilize data communication links provided in the on-board component of the system.<br>
[00171]	In accordance with at least one embodiment of the inventiorL, passengers<br>
may be provided with passive transponders, e.g., in decorative pins or on bracelets, that include identification data about the passenger. These passive transponders may be configured to interact with sensors located on board the traEisportation vehicle (e.g., located in door frames) as part of the monitoring and feedback system* Interaction of these transponders and the sensors may be used to determine a location of a passenger on the transportation vehicle, e.g., parents ate looking for a child on a large cruise ship*<br><br>
[00172]	In accordance with at least one embodiment of the inventioii, safety<br>
equipment provided on board transportation vehxcle(s) may be equipped with passive trauisponders. The monitoring and feedback system's on-board component may be configured to identify the identity of those transponders and keep a coxmt of how many transponders have bsen identified dining a particular period. For example, in the event that a transportation vehicle emergency occurs, life vests may be distributed to passengers and crew prior to evacuating the transportation vehicle. Access of a receptacle including the life vests may trigger operation of the on-board component such that, a determination is made whether the life vest is being worn by a passenger (for example, by detecting whether a clip securing the life vest on the passenger has been operated) and how many life vest^ are being worn by passengers. This information may be communicated to the base station(s) to assist rescue operations. Such iofonnation may be useful in determining how many passengers were evacuated and ti&amp;Qd to be recovered-Moreover, depending on the strengdi of the transponders, they may be used to help locate the erv'acuated passengers.<br>
[00173]	In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, the on-board<br>
component of the system may be configured to recognize cargo bemg loaded onto and off the vehicle and stored on the vehicle by recognizing transponders attached to the cargo. For example^ the cargo may be luggage, plats of products, etc. The transponders may include unique identification data and be associated with specific cargo in a database accessible by or included in the on-vehicle component of the system. This information may be used to control or assist in loading and ofi-loadiog of cargo and/or checldng again transportation vehicle manifests. This additional information may be beneficial by reducing or minimizing the amount of time necessary to ensure that all cargo has been loaded or off-loaded at a port, destination, or prior to arrival.<br>
[00174]	In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, the on-board<br>
component of the system may be configtired to include one or more interfaces that provide the capabilit)^ to connect medical equipment tvithin the transportation veliicle, e.g,, an aircraft or cruise ship, to the on-board component, which may be configured to send and receive infonnation to and fi-om doctors^ medical peacsonnel, etc., off-board the transportation vehicle. Such interfaces and transmission capability may allow real-time or near real time transmission of medical data relating to a sick or injured person on the transportation vehicle. This transmission and subsequent remote medical diagnosis or advice may allow the transportation vehicle crew to manage and/or resolve a medical situation.<br><br>
