				<td>This invention relates to an energy efficient air heater. The heater of the present invention is highly efficient in heat transfer, compact in size, quick to start, low thermal mass and reduces heat wastage and hence the present invention is very energy efficient. The heater of this invention is useful in wider areas of applications like domestic, industrial heaters, dryers, hospital room warmers, room heaters, hot air knives and many tailor made needs.<br>
Conventional air heaters are normally fabricated with bare coiled wire, wire wound around ceramic rods or wire embedded ceramic beads in tubular metal sheaths over which fins of different kinds are arranged. These air heaters may or may not be provided with other essential components such as thermostats, air generating systems, blowing ducts, outlets etc. Most of such heaters suffer from the draw back of low power utilization as well as low thermal efficiency due to poor coefficient of heat transfer. Considering the high cost of power as well as to achieve higher thermal efficiency it will be advantageous if a heater having improved properties is made available. Such a heater will also reduce heat wastage resulting in energy conservation, which is a very important criterion in the economic development of a country such as India.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is, therefore to provide an improved energy efficient air heater which utilizes less power and has higher thermal efficiency , compact in size and has wider applicability .<br>
It has been an object of the present invention to provide a sufficiently strong ceramic honeycomb monolith structure with plurality of parallel holes (here -after called channels) with predetermined wall thickness and channel size to insert and weave an electrode in and out of all or some of the holes in a predetermined fashion, there by creating series of parallel channels with nearly parallel woven elements from a single electrode or more.<br>
It has also been an object of the present invention to provide a ceramic honeycomb monolithic body with plurality of channels of circular, square, rectangular, triangular or any other cross section to act as the support structure for the electrical resistance heating element woven through its channels and the channels in turn to act as passages for air when air is blown through them or allowed to pass through them.<br>
It has also been an objective of the present invention to provide an efficient air heater employing ceramic honeycomb monolithic structures with plurality of parallel holes, made of cordierite or steatite or alumina or alumina silica based formulations.<br>
Yet another objective of the invention is to reduce the size of the heater to more than 30% of the conventional air heater of similar heat output and productive heat requirements there by allowing better space management.<br>
Still another important objective of the present invention is to provide a heating unit, which minimizes start-up times due to its low thermal mass owing to its high coefficient of heat transfer there-by improving the productivity, reduce down times and improves the over all utilization of power.<br><br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a heater with an electrical resistance-heating element woven in such a fashion that all its windings are well insulated from one another due to the ceramic honeycomb channel walls separating them and with no scope of short-circuiting with the outer structure.<br>
We have observed that ceramic honeycomb monolithic units fabricated from materials such as cordierite or steatite can be used in the manufacture of heaters. We have further observed that configurations such as circular/ triangular / rectangular / square /hexagonal and any other shaped honeycomb monolithic units fabricated from the above said materials when used in the manufacture of heaters, and the electrical resistance heating element is woven through the channels of the honeycomb, the resulting heaters when used in generation of hot air are energy efficient.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
In its very simplest of forms, the present invention relates to an improved energy efficient air heater employing a ceramic honeycomb monolithic body with plurality of parallel holes of circular, square, rectangular, triangular, hexagonal or any other geometric shape of cross section forming the element support channels and when the electrical resistance heating element is woven through these channels in such a fashion that the said heating element passes through each channel only once and there is an annular space in between the said heating element and the said channel walls and these channels also serve as passages for air when air is blown through or allowed to pass through these channels.<br>
The electrical resistance heating element may be round, flat, rectangular or any other cross section and is of predetermined length. The said heating element is inserted and woven through the channels of the honeycomb monolithic structure in such a fashion that the said heating element passes only once through each of the channels in a predetermined fashion.<br>
The electrode element may be wound through the channels as a straight wire or as zigzag bent wire or alternately as coiled wire of predetermined coil diameter. Both the ends of the electrical resistance-heating element are extending out of the channels from one end of the honeycomb to be properly terminated for power connection.<br>
Two electrodes of appropriate length are inserted in to two empty channels of the honeycomb and fixed rigidly in those channels by means of suitable ceramic cement. Each end of the electrical resistance heating element extending out of the ceramic honeycomb body is securely and rigidly terminated to each of the fixed electrodes respectively.<br>
The heater is canned in an appropriate container in such a fashion that the rigidly fixed electrodes are always positioned on the air inlet end of the main body. The electrodes are terminated out side the heater body to a connector.<br><br>
When power is supplied to the electrode and air is blown through the channels of the honeycomb, heat is generated in the electrical resistance heating element .The air passing through the channels of the honeycomb is in intimate contact with the entire length and surface area of electrode in individual channels thereby creating a most favorable condition for efficient convective heat transfer and provide us with an energy efficient air heating system.<br>
The ceramic honeycomb channel walls act as good insulators positioned in-between every two parallel element windings besides supporting the electrode at every winding point thereby providing a stable and strong unit.<br>
Not much heat storing is observed in the heater body during the operating period, as air is allowed to pass through all the channels with out preference. As air passes through the channels continuously, almost entire heat generated in the electrical resistance-heating element is transferred.<br>
And the resulting air heater is energy efficient and has many distinct advantages over the conventional air heaters.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
Accordingly we have fabricated an energy efficient air heater with ceramic honeycomb monolithic body '6' made of cordierite, steatite, and alumina- silica based materials. An electrical resistance heating element '5' is woven through the channels in the said manner and terminated at the two electrodes, fixed rigidly in two empty channels of the ceramic honeycomb unit. This ceramic honeycomb unit is in-turn fitted in to the main body ' 1' with provision for air inlet '2' and air outlet '3'. The electrodes are positioned on the air inlet side of the heater. The electrodes are terminated out side the main body to a connector. A diffuser '4' to spread air uniformly is in between the air inlet and the honeycomb body. A thermocouple '7' is provided in some applications.<br>
Figure. No .1.	Represents the view of the heater in one of its simplest forms<br>

other geometrical shape and size to suit specific needs.<br>
The wall thickness of the channels may vary from 0.2mm to 2.0mm or more as per<br>
requirement.<br>
The cross sectional open area of the channel can be anywhere from 0.04 sq .mm to 100<br>
