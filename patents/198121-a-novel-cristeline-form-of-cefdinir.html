FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the process for the preparation of novel crystalline form<br>
of Cefdinir, 7p-[(Z)-2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-hydroxyiminoacetamido]-3-vinyI"3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cefdinir of Formula I is a very useful antimicrobial agent and is chemically known as 7p-[(Z)-2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-hydroxyiminoacetamido]-3-vinyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid.<br><br>
Cefdinir is an oral antibiotic and was first disclosed in US patent 4,559,334. The product obtained according to above invention was crystalline like amorphous product, not a crystalline product.<br>
US patent 4,935,507 discloses the methods of producing crystalline cefdinir that offered better filtration rate, high purity and stable cefdinir suitable for pharmaceutical preparation. This was prepared by treating amorphous cefdinir with sodium bicarbonate solution and the resulting aqueous solution was subjected to column chromatography and then adjusting the pH between 1-2 at 35-40°C followed by cooling to obtain cefdinir crystal A. Alternatively, amorphous cefdinir was dissolved in methanol and to this solution added water at 35°C, stirred and allowed to stand at room temperature to obtain cefdinir crystal A.<br>
Though, US patent 4,935,507 claims crystalline form A, advantages may yet be realized by others, heretofore undiscovered forms of cefdinir. The present invention includes a novel crystalline form of cefdinir. Polymorphism is the property of some molecules and molecular complexes to assume more than one crystalline or amorphous form in solid state. A molecule like cefdinir of Formula I may give to a variety of solids having distinct physical properties like solubility, melting point, powdered X-ray diffractogram (XRD). The differences in the physical properties of polymorphs result from the orientation and intermolecular interactions of adjacent molecules (complexes) in the bulk solid. Accordingly, polymorphs are distinct solids sharing the same molecular formula, which may be thought of as analogous to unit cell metallurgy, yet having distinct advantageous and or disadvantageous physical properties compared to other forms in the polymorph family. The present invention provides a new crystalline form of cefdinir having moisture content in the range of 5.5-7.0%, but typically 6-7%, amounting closely to sesquihydrate and herein called as cefdinir crystal B. Further, the major advantages realized in the present invention are avoiding the use of chromatographic technique and highly pure cefdinir crystal B is obtained. It is an objective of the present invention to provide a stable, nontoxic, non-solvate crystalline modification of cefdinir, which is substantially free of impurities.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the process for the preparation of a novel crystalline form of cefdinir, hereinafter called as cefdinir crystal B. More particularly, the novel form may contain water up to 5.5-7.0% by weight but typically close to 6.3% w/w which corresponds to the stoichiometric value of-1.5 mole of water per mole of cefdinir. The novel crystal B of cefdinir of the present invention may be characterized by powdered X-ray diffraction and infrared absorption spectrum. Thus powdered X-ray diffraction of novel cefdinir crystal B and crystal A were determined on Seifert XRD 3003TT system using a copper target X-ray tube, a nickel filter and the sample was placed in a pyrex glass holder. The scan rate was 1.8 degrees, two theta per minute with the step size of 0.03 degrees two theta over the range from 5 to 50 degrees.<br>
The novel cefdinir crystal B has powdered X-ray diffraction pattern essentially as shown in Table 1 and the powdered X-ray diffraction pattern reported for crystal A is given in Table 2. The powdered X-ray diffraction patterns are expressed in terms of two theta and relative intensities.<br><br>
TABLE-1: LIST OF 20 AND RELATIVE INTENSITY FOR CEFDINIR CRYSTAL B.<br><br><br>
TABLE-2: LIST OF 29 AND RELATIVE INSENTIES FOR CEFDINIR CRYSTAL A<br><br>
The infrared absorption spectra of cefdinir crystal B and crystal A were determined on Perkin Elmer-spectrum ONE infrared spectrophotometer.<br>
The infrared absorption spectrum of cefdinir crystal B (Fig 3) shows characteristics peaks at 1017, 1049, 1121, 1134, 1191, 1428, 1545, 1613, 1667, 1780, 3295 and 3595 Cm-1<br>
Whereas the infrared spectrum of cefdinir crystal A (Fig 4) shows characteristics peaks at 1013, 1175, 1460, 1519, 1556, 1594, 1622, 1682 and 1766 Cm-1<br>
It is evident from the above data that the novel crystalline form of present invention is different from the cefdinir crystal A reported in US patent 4,935,507. The powdered X-ray diffraction pattern of crystal B shows maximum peak at 11.710.2 degree two theta whereas crystal A shows maximum peak at 21.5±0.2 degree two theta. We have found that this novel cefdinir crystal B has excellent storage stability characteristics and suitable for pharmaceutical formulation.<br>
The stress stability studies of cefdinir crystal B were carried out. The samples were kept under the conditions of 60°C±2°C and the purity and assay of samples were determined before and after the stress test by high performance liquid chromatography and given in Table 3.<br>
TABLE'S: STRESS STABILITY DATA OF CEFDINIR CRYSTAL B<br><br><br>
As shown in the TabIe-3 even after keeping the samples at 60°C±2°Cfor fifteen days the compounds have not degraded. Therefore, it is evident that cefdinir crystal B is quite stable.<br>
The process comprises the step of condensation of 7-amino-3-vinyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylate 4-methoxybenzyl ester hydrochloride with 2-benzothiazolyl (Z)-2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-trityloxyiminothioacetate in the presence of trialkylamine in any suitable solvent such as A^,//-dimethylacetamide, A'jA^-dimethylformamide, methylene dichloride and like and mixture thereof. Specifically the condensation is carried out at a temperature range of 40-50°C. After completion of reaction, the reaction mass is cooled and product is extracted into suitable organic solvent and washed with dilute base and water. The suitable solvent can be selected from methylene dichloride, chloroform, toluene, ethylene dichloride etc., most preferably methylene dichloride. Further, organic layer is treated with trifluoroacetic acid at a temperature of about 10-15°C for 4-5 h to remove carboxyl protecting groups. Thereafter, the organic layer was cooled to 0°C and water was added. The layers were separated, and on cooling the aqueous layer, trifluoroacetic acid salt of cefdinir precipitated out, which is isolated by filtration.<br>
Further, the wet cefdinir trifluoroacetic acid salt is suspended in water and neutralized with aqueous ammonia at a temperature of 0-30°C most preferably at 20-25°C to obtain highly purified cefdinir crystal B.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention is a process to produce cefdinir crystal B from cefdinir crystal A.<br>
The process comprises of suspending cefdinir crystal A in water at 35-40°C and treating with trifluoroacetic acid to prepare cefdinir.trifluoroacetic acid salt. The trifluoroacetic acid salt of cefdinir is isolated in high purity. Typically purity is analyzed by HPLC and is greater than 99.5% and generally closer to 99.6%. The trifluoroacetic acid salt of cefdinir is then neutralized by adjusting the pH to 3.0-3.2 with aqueous ammonia in water at 0-30°C preferably at 20-25°C to obtain highly pure cefdinir crystal B as off white solid. Typically, the purities are greater than 99% by HPLC in commercial lots. The trifluoroacetic acid salt of cefdinir is preferably used as wet material without drying.<br>
The cefdinir crystal A can be prepared by methods known in the art (US 4,935,507) and then can easily be converted to cefdinir crystal B.<br>
The present invention hence provides a novel crystalline form, crystal B of cefdinir and a method of its preparation, which is amenable to large-scale production, and suitable for formulation.<br>
The novel crystalline form, crystal B of cefdinir of the present invention is readily filterable and easily dried. Moreover, the cefdinir crystal B prepared is of high purity typically greater than 99.5% as seen by HPLC. The novel crystalline form shows excellent storage stability and hence suitable for formulation. The novel crystal B of cefdinir may contain 5.5-7.0% of water and has<br>
a decomposition range of 188-192°C.<br><br>
Having thus described the various aspects of the present invention, the following examples are provided to illustrate specific embodiments of the present invention. They are not intended to be limiting in anyway.<br>
