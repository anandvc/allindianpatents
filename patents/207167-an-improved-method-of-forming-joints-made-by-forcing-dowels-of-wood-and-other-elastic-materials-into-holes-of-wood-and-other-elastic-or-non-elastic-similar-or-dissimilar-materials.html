				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an improved method of forming joints made by forcing dowels of wood and other elastic materials into holes of v/ood and other elastic or non-elastic, similar or dissimilar materials.<br>
The joints made by pressing dowels of wood and other materials into holes in bodies of wood and other materials in the existing methods suffer from one  drawback that the  dowels and holes are required to be of exactly correct size and/or taper to ensure  adequate  tightness  of the  joints  formed by pressing the dowels into the holes involving an increased cost and time  for fabricating the same,  and from another drawback that the joints formed at a given humidity and temperature condition of the atmosphere lose their tightness when exposed to a different humidity and temperature condition of the atmosphere because of shrinkage or expansion of wood and other materials with loss or gain of moisture and/or due to thermal effects.<br>
One  object of the present  invention is to provide a relatively fast and inexpensive method of forming joints between dowels of v/ood and other elastic materials,  and holes of equal or smaller size,  and equal or greater taper,  requiring thereby reduced fabrication cost and time.<br>
Another object of the  invention is to provide a method in which the   tightness of the joints formed at a given humidity and temperature condition of atmosphere  is not lost when exposed to an atmosphere  of lower or higher humidity and temperature condition.<br>
Yet another object of the  invention is  to provide a method in which the  tightness of the  joints is  not lost  through<br>
-    2    -<br>
mechanical  handling of the  bodies  joined by pressing  dowels  into holes therein.<br>
In the existing method the  dowels used are incompressible in their lateral directions by the pressure applied thereon when these are forced into the holes in bodies of wood and other materials.<br>
In the invented method the dowels have been made laterally compressible  by slitting these longitudinally along the  axis thereof starting from the end to be entered into the holes upto a part  of its length to  be   inserted into  the holes. A lateral   compressive  force  is  thereby generated between the outer surface  of the  dowels and the   inner surface  of the  holes when the dowels are pressed into the   suitably tapered holes to maintain the tightness of the  joints when exposed to an atmosphere of relatively low or high humidity  and temperature  condition*<br>
In addition,  an adhesive of known types is applied on the  outer surface of the  dowels and,   if necessary,  also on the inner surface of the  holes,  immediately before forcing the dowels into the suitably tapered holes to maintain the tightness of the joints during mechanical handling of the bodies joined together.<br>
Thus the  invention provides an improved method of forming joints by forcing dowels of wood and other elastic materials into holes of wood and other elastic or non-elastic,   similar or dissimilar materials,   comprising insertion of the  dowels by pressure into the  holes,   characterised in that the method comprises the steps of :    (a)  fabricating dowels of round or oval cross-section and of diameter exactly equal  or of diameter less to that  of  the holes at the  outer end thereof;<br>
-    3    -<br>
(b)	fabricating holes of appoximately round or ovel/cross-section and of<br>
diameter tapering from the  outer end to the inner end thereof;<br>
(c)	slitting the dowels longitudinally along the axis starting<br>
from the  tip towards the base thereof,  along a part of the length<br>
from the tip to the base,   into at least two equal sections;<br>
(d)	applying an adhesive of known types on the  outer surface  of<br>
the  dowels and if necessary,   on the  inner surface of the holes<br>
as well,   immediately before forcing the dowels  into the holes;<br>
and (e) inserting the dowels into the holes by applying force<br>
thereon.<br>
The invention is described fully and particularly in an unrestricted manner with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which -<br>
Figure  1 illustrates one existing method of forming dowels and holes;<br>
Figure 2 illustrates another existing method of forming dowels and holes;<br>
Figure 3 illustrates one invented method of forming dowels and holes;   and<br>
Figure 4 illustrates cross-sections of dowels used in the invented method by splitting the same  into longitudinal sections along the axis,   into : (A)  two equal sections,   (B)  three equal sections and (C)  four equal sections.     Multiple sections may also be used.<br>
Referring to Figure  1,   dowels (D) and holes  (H) are each made of round cross-sections of uniform diameter throughout their entire length,   the diameter of dowels  being made  exactly equal  to<br>
-    4    -<br>
that of the outer side of the corresponding holes, to ensure a tight fit between the two,  when the  dowels are forced into the holes.<br>
Referring to Figure 2,  while the  dowels (D)  are made of round cross-section of diameter tapering along the length to be inserted into    the holes,  the holes (H) are made of round cross-section of diameter tapering from their outer end to the inner end at a predetermined angle,   requiring    the angle of taper of the  dowels and holes to be made exactly equal.<br>
Referring to Figure 3,   the  dowels (D) are made  of round cross-section of uniform diameter along their entire length, having an axial slit (s)  cut from their tip (T)  towards their base  (B),  extending over a part (P) which is  10% to 100% of their entire length from tip (T)  to base  (B);  and the  corresponding holes (H)  are made of round cross-section with the diameter at their outer end (0) being either exactly or approximately equal to the diameter of the dowels  (D).     The dowels  after insertion into  the holes taper    to reduced diameter at their inner end (I) at an angle i.e.  2° to 60° with the axis of the holes.<br>
Referring to Figure 4, the number of the axially split up sections in the dowels used in the invented method may be two to four or more.<br>
Because of the use of laterally compressible  dowels,   and the need for fabrication of dowels and holes  of only equal or approximately equal size and taper,  and because  of the  application of an adhesive  on the surface  of the  dowels and if necessary,   on              the  inner surface of the holes as well,   Joints  of durable tightness<br>
-    5    -<br>
D 11 3-46OO-3-04<br>
are formed at a reduced fabrication cost and at an increased speed in the Invented method.<br>
There may be various modifications of the method of forming the  joints by forcing dowels of wood and other materials into holes in bodies of wood and other materials following the <br>
inventive concept disclosed In the instant application.     It Is to be  noted that all such modifications will  fall within the scope of the  inventive concept of the  instant application.<br>
