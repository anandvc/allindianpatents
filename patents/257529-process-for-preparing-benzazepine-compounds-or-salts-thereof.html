for preparing benzazepine compounds of the formula (1): O<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>

(Formula Removed)<br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above, or salts thereof (hereinafter, these compounds including salts are occasionally referred to as "benzole acid compounds (4)" or simply as "compounds (4)").<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
It is known that the benzazepine compounds of the above formula (1) or salts thereof are useful as an intermediate for preparing a pharmaceutically active benzazepine compound having vasopressin antagonistic-activity, e.g. the compounds (10) as mentioned hereinafter (cf.JP-A-4-154765).<br>
It is also known that the benzazepine compounds (1) have been<br><br>
prepared by the processes as shown in the following Reaction schemes A and B (cf. JP-A-4-154765 and Kazumi Kondo et al., Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry 7(1999), pp. 1743-1754). Reaction Scheme A:<br><br><br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein R1, R2 and X1 are as defined above. Reaction Scheme B:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1, R2 and X1 are as defined above.<br>
However, the methods shown in the above Reaction Schemes A and B are not suitable for producing the desired compounds (1) on industrial scale. That is, the starting compound (4) to be used in Reaction Scheme A is hardly obtainable in high yield and in high purity, and hence, the method of Reaction Scheme A is not suitable as an industrial process. Besides, the method of Reaction Scheme B can not give the desired compounds (1) in high yield and in high purity, and hence it is not suitable as an industrial process.<br>
It is further known that the benzoic acid compounds of the above formula (4) are useful as an intermediate for preparing a pharmaceutically active benzazepine compound having vasopressin antagonistic activity (cf. JP-A-4-154765). The benzoic acid compounds (4) are usually prepared by a process as shown in the following Reaction Scheme C (cf. Yasuhiro Torisawa et al., Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal<br><br>
