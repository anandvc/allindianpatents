Ri    is chlorine, methyl, methoxy, acetoxy, pivaloyloxy or hydroxyl;<br>
R2    is chlorine or methyl;<br>
R3    is hydrogen, halogen or methyl; and<br>
R4    is C1-C6-alkyl or benzyl, where the phenyl moiety of the benzyl radical may carry a halogen or methyl substituent, and<br><br><br>
Y2  is a phenyl radical or a 5- or 6-membered saturated or unsaturated heterocyclyl radical having at least one heteroatom selected from the group consisting of N, 0 and S, where the cyclic radicals may have one to three substituents selected from the group consisting of halogen, C1-C4 -alkyl,   C1-C4-alkoxy, C1-C4-haloalkyl, C1-C4-haloalkoxy, C1-C4-alkoxy-C2-C4-alkenyl, C1-C4-'alkoxy-C2-C4-alkynyl; and<br>
Y3, Y4  independently of one another are hydrogen, C1-C4-alkyl, C1-C4-alkoxy, C1-C4-alkylthio, N'-C1-C4-alkylamino, C1-C4-haloalkyl or C1-C4-haloalkoxy;<br>
in a synergistically effective amount.<br>
Moreover, the invention relates to methods for controlling harmful fungi using mixtures of the compounds I and II and to the compositions comprising the compounds I and II.<br>
The compounds of the formula I, their preparation and their action against harmful fungi are known from the literature (EP-A 727 141; EP--A 897 904; EP-A 899 255; EP-A 967 196).<br>
Mixtures of benzophenones of the formula I with other fungicidally active compounds are known from EP-A 1 023 834*<br>
The compounds of the formula II and processes for their preparation are described in WO-A 96/19442, EP-A 1 017 670 and EP-A 1 017 671-<br>
DE-A 197 22 223 describes mixtures of compounds of the formula ZZ and active compounds from the class of the Strobilurins.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide further particularly effective mixtures for controlling harmful fungi and in particular for certain indications.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide mixtures which have an improved activity against harmful fungi, combined with a reduced total amount of active compounds applied (synergistic mixtures), with a view to reducing the application rates and improving the activity spectrum of the known compounds I and II.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the mixtures defined at the outset. Moreover, we have found that applying the compounds I and the compounds II simultaneously, i.e. together or<br><br>
separately, or applying the compounds I and the compounds II successively provides better control of harmful fungi than is possible with the individual compounds alone.<br>
The mixtures according to the invention act synergistically and are therefore particularly suitable for controlling harmful fungi and in particular powdery mildew fungi in cereals, vegetables, fruit, ornamental plants and grapevines.<br>
The following compounds of the formula I are preferred mixing partners, the individual preferences applying on their own and in combination.<br>
Preference is given to compounds I in which R1 is chlorine, methoxy, acetoxy or hydroxyl, and particular preference is given to compounds in which R1 is methoxy, acetoxy or hydroxyl. Very particular preference is given to compounds in which R1 is methoxy.<br>
Mixtures comprising compounds I in which R2 is chlorine or methyl are mixtures according ro the invention. Preference is given to compounds I in whrn R2 is methyl.<br>
Moreover, preference is given to compounds I in which R3 is hydrogen, methyl, chlorine or bromine, and with particular preference hydrogen, chlorine or bromine.<br>
In addition, preference is given to compounds I in which R4 is C1-C4-alkyl or bezzyl, where the phenyl moiety of the benzyl radical'may carry  halogen or methyl substituent. Particularly preferred are compc-Z-ds  of the formula I in which R4 is C1-C4-alkyl, prer5rHi:lj rietihyl*<br>
Furthermore preferred are compounds of the formula I in which the<br>
substituents R1, R2, R3- and R4 are as defined below:<br>

Among the compounds II, preference is given to those in which<br>
X-  is chlorine, difluoromethoxy or trifluoromethyl;<br>
x2 and X^ are hydrogen;<br>
X-5  is hydrogen or fluorine;<br>
X5  is chlorine, fluorine, trifluoromethyl or difluoromethoxy;<br>
Y1  is methylenecyclopropyl;<br>
Y2  is unsubstituted or substituted phenyl, thienyl, pyrazolyl, pyrrolyl, .imidazolyl, thiazolyl, furyl, pyridazinyl or pyrimidinyl. Preferred substituents on these ring systems are halogen (in particular F and Cl),<br><br>
C1-C4-alkoxy (in particular methoxy) and C1-C4-alkyl (in particular methyl). The number of ring'substituents may be from 1 to 3, in particular 1 or 2 - Unsubstituted phenyl or phenyl which is substituted in the 4-position by fluorine, methyl, trifluoromethyl or methoxy are particularly preferred; y3 and Y4 are hydrogen-<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Preference is given to fungicidal nixtures, which comprise, as component a), one of the compounds: 1-33, 1-35, 1-42, 1-44, I-46, 1-60, or preferably 1-18, 1-28, 1-37, and, as component b), one of the compounds: 11-15, 11-32, 11-62, 11-68, or preferably 11-59, 11-69.<br>
The quantitative ratio of the compounds I and II can be varied within wide ranges; the active compounds are preferably employee: in a weight ratio in the range from 100:1 to 0,1:1, preferably from 50:1 to 1:1, with particular preference from 20:1 to 1:1.<br>
When preparing the mixtures, it is preferred to employ the pure active compounds I and II, to which further active compounds against harmful fungi or other pests, such as insects, arachnids or nematodes, or else herbicidal or growth-regulating active ingredients or fertilizers can be admixed.<br>
The mixtures of the compounds I and II, or the compounds I and is used simultaneously, jointly or separately, exhibit outstanding  activity against a wide range of phyropathogenic fungi, in particular from the classes of the Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes, Phycomycetes and Deuteromycetes. Sone of them act systemically and can therefore be employed as foliar- and soil-acting fungicides•<br><br>
They are especially important for controlling a large number of fungi in a variety of crop plants, such as cotton, vegetable species (e.g. cucumbers, beans,   tomatoes, potatoes and cucurbits), barley, grass, oats, bananas, coffee, maize, fruit species, rice, rye, soya, grapevine, wheat, ornamentals, sugar cane, and a variety of seeds.<br>
They are particularly suitable for controlling the following phytopathogenic fungi: Erysiphe graminis (powdery mildew) in cereals, Erysiphe cichoracearum and Sphaerotheca fuliginea in cucurbits, Podosphaera leucotricha in apples, Uncinula necator in grapevines, Puccinia species in cereals, Rhizoctonia species in cotton, rice and lawns, Ustilago species in cereals and sugar cane, Venturia inaequalis (scab) in apples, Helminthosporium species in cereals, Septoria nodorum in wheat, Botrytis cinera (gray mold) in strawberries, vegetables, ornamentals and grapevines, Cercospora arachidicola in groundnuts, Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides in wheat and barley, Pyricularia oryzae in rice, Phytophthora infestans in potatoes and tomatoes, Plasmopara viticola in grapevines, Pseudoperonospora species in hops and cucumbers, Alternaria species in vegetables and fruit, Mycosphaerella species in bananas and Fusarium and Verticillium species.<br>
They can furthermore be employed in the protection of materials (for example the protection of wood), for example against Paecilomyces variotii.<br>
The compounds I and II can be applied simultaneously, that is either together or separately, or successively, the sequence, in the case of separate application, generally not having any effe^-on the result of the control measures,<br>
Depending on the kind of effect desired, the application rates to the mixtures according to the invention are, in particular in agricultural crop areas, from 0.01 to 10 kg/ha, preferably 0.1 to 5 kg/ha, in particular 0,2 to 3.0 kg/ha.<br>
The application rates of the compounds I are from 0,005 to 6.0 kg/ha, preferably 0.08 to 3-0 kg/ha, in particular 0.12 tc 2.0 kg/ha.<br>
Correspondingly, in the case of the compounds II, the application rates are from 0.005 to 4.0 kg/ha, preferably 0.02 to 2.0 kg/na. in particular 0.08 to 1.0 kg/ha.<br><br>
For seed treatment, the application rates of the mixture are generally from 0.001 to 250 g/kg of seed, preferably 0-01 to 100 g/kg, in particular 0.01 to 50 g/kg.<br>
If phytopathogenic harmful fungi are to be controlled, the separate or joint application of the compounds I and II or of the mixtures of the compounds I and II is effected by spraying or dusting the seeds, the plants or the soils before or after sowing of the plants, or before or after plant emergence.<br>
The fungicidal synergistic mixtures according to the invention or the compounds I and II can be formulated for example in the form of ready-to-spray solutions, powder and suspensions or in the form of highly concentrated aqueous, oily or other suspensions, dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dusts, materials for broadcasting or granules, and applied by spraying, atomizing, dusting, broadcasting or watering. The use form depends on the intended purpose; in any case, it should ensure as fine and uniform as possible a distribution of the mixture according to the invention-<br>
The formulations are prepared in a known manner, e.g. by extending the active compound with solvents and/or carriers, if desired using emulsifiers and dispersants, it being possible also to use other organic solvents as auxiliary solvents if water is used as the diluent. Suitable auxiliaries for this purpose are essentially: solvents such as aromatics (e.g. xylene), chlorinated aromatics (e.g, chlorobenzenes), paraffins (e.g. mineral oil fractions), alcohols (e.g. methanol, butanol), ketones (e,g  cyclohexanose), amines (e.g. ethanolamine, dimethylformcunide) and water; carriers such as ground natural minerals (e.g. kaolins, clays, talc, chalk) and ground synthetic minerals (e.g. finely divided silica, silicates); emulsifiers such as nonionic and anionic emulsifiers (e.g. polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, alkylsulfonates and arylsulfonates) and dispersants such as lignosulfite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Suitable surfactants are the alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts and ammonium salrs of aromatic sulfonic acids, e.g. ligno-, phenol-, naphthalene- and dibutylnaphthalenesulfonic acid, and of fatty acids, alkyl- and alkylarylsulfonates, alkyl, lauryl ether and fatty alcohol sulfates, and salts of sulfated hexa-, hepta- and octadecanols, or of fatty alcohol glycol ethers, condensates of sulfonated naphthalene and its derivatives with formaldehyde, condensates of naphthalene or of the naphthalenesulfonic acids with phenol and formaldehyde.<br><br>
polyoxyethylene octylphenol ether, ethoxylated isooctyl-, octyl-or nonylphenol, alkylphenyl or tributylphenyl polyglycol ethers, alkylaryl polyether alcohols, isotridecyl alcohol, fatty alcohol/ethylene oxide condensates, ethoxylated castor oil, polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers or polyoxypropylene, lauryl alcohol polyglycol ether acetate, sorbitol esters, lignosulfite waste liquors or methylcellulose.<br>
Powders, materials for broadcasting and dusts can be prepared by mixing or jointly grinding the compounds I or II or the mixture of the compounds I and II with a solid carrier.<br>
Granules (e.g. coated granules, impregnated granules or homogeneous granules) are usually prepared by binding the active compound, or active compounds, to a solid carrier,<br>
Fillers or solid carriers are, for example, mineral earths, such as silicas, silica gels, silicates, talc, kaolin, limestone, lime, chalk, bole, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic materials and fertilizers, such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas, and products of vegetable origin, such as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and nutshell meal, cellulose powders or other solid carriers.<br>
The formulations generally comprise from 0,1 to 95% by weight, preferably 0.5 to 90% by weight, of one of the compounds I and II or of the mixture of the compounds I and II. The active compounds are employed in a purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably 95% to 100% (according to NMR or EBZJZ  spectrum).<br>
The compounds I or II, the mixtures, or the corresponding formulations, are applied by txeating the harmful fungi, their habitat, or the plants, seeds, soils, areas, materials or spaces to be kept free from them with a fungicidally effective amount of the mixture, or of the compounds I and II in the case of separate application-<br>
Application can be effected before or after infection by the harmful fungi-<br>
Use Example<br>
The synergistic activity of the mixtures according to the invention can be demonstrated by the following experiments:<br><br>
The active compounds, separately or together, are formulated as a 10% emulsion in a mixture of 63% by weight of cyclohexanone and 27% by weight of emulsifier, and diluted with water to the desired concentration*<br>
Evaluation is carried out by determining the infected leaf areas in percent. These percentages are converted into efficacies. The efficacy (H) is calculated as follows using Abbot's formula:<br>
W = (1 - a)*100/β<br>
a  corresponds to the fungal infection of the treated plants in<br>
% and (3   corresponds to the fungal infection of the untreated<br>
(control) plants in %<br>
An efficacy of 0 means that the infection level of the treated plants corresponds to that of the untreated control plants; an efficacy of 100 means that the treated plants were not infected.<br>
The expected efficacies of the mixtures of the active compounds were determined using Colby's formula [R.S. Colby, Weeds 15. 20-22 (1967)] and compared with the observed efficacies.<br>
Colby's formula: E = x + y - x-y/100<br>
E   expected efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control,<br>
when using the mixture of the active compounds A and B at the<br>
concentrations a and b x   efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using<br>
active compound A at a concentration of a y  efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when  using<br>
active compound B at a concentration of b.<br>
Use example 1: Protective activity against mildew of cucumber caused by Sphaerotheca fuliginea<br>
Leaves of cucumber seedlings of the cultivar 'Chinese snake' which had been grown in pots were, at the cotyledon stage, sprayed to runoff point with an aqueous preparation of active compound which had been prepared from a stock solution comprising 10% of active compound, 85% of cyclohexanone and 5% of emulsifier, 20 hours after the spray coating had dried on  the plants were inoculated with an aqueous spore suspension of mildew of cucumber {Sphaerotheca  fuliginea).  The plants were then cultivated in a greenhouse at 20-24°C and 60-80% relative<br><br>
atmospheric humidity for 7 days* The extent of the mildew development was then determined visually in % infection of the cotyledon surface-<br>
The visually determined values for the percentage of infected leaf areas were converted into efficacies in % of the untreated control. An efficacy of 0 means the same infection as in the untreated control, an efficacy of 100 means 0% infection. The expected efficacies for combinations of active compounds were determined using Colby's formula (Colby, S. R, (Calculating synergistic and antagonistic responses of herbicide Combinations", Weeds, 15, pp. 20 - 22, 1967) and compared to the observed efficacies*<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The test results show that, for all mixing ratios, the observed efficacy is higher than the efficacy calculated beforehand using Colby's formula (from Synerg 166A, XLS).<br><br><br><br>

separately, or applying the compounds I and the compounds II successively provides better control of harmful fungi than is possible with the individual compounds alone.<br>
The mixtures according to the invention act synergistically and are therefore particularly suitable for controlling harmful fungi and in particular powdery mildew fungi in cereals, vegetables, fruit, ornamental plants and grapevines.<br>
The following compounds of the formula I are preferred mixing partners, the individual preferences applying on their own and in combination-<br>
Preference is given to compounds I in which R is chlorine, methoxy, acetoxy or hydroxy1, and particular preference is given to compounds in which R1 is methoxy, acetoxy or hydroxyl. Very particular preference is given to compounds in which R1 is methoxy-<br>
Mixtures comprising compounds I in which R2 is chlorine or methyl are mixtures according to the invention. Preference is given to compounds I in which R2 is methyl.<br>
Moreover, preference is given to compounds I in which R3 is hydrogen, methyl, chlorine or bromine, and with particular preference hydrogen, chlorine or bromine.<br>
In addition, preference is given to compounds I in which R4 is C1-C4-alkyl or benzyl, where the phenyl moiety of the benzyl radical may carry a halogen or methyl substituent. Particularly preferred are compounds of the formula I in which R4 is C1-C4-alkyl, preferably methyl.<br>

Preference is given to fungicidal mixtures, which comprise, as component a), one of the compounds; 1-33, 1-35, 1-42, 1-44, 1-46; 1-60, or preferably 1-18, 1-28, 1-37, and, as component b), one of the compounds: 11-15, 11-32, 11-62, 11-68, or preferably 11-59, 11-69.<br>
The quantitative ratio of the compounds I and II can be varied within wide ranges; the active compounds are preferably employed in a weight ratio in the range from 100:1 to 0*1:1, preferably from 50:1 to 1:1, with particular preference from 20:1 to 1:1.<br>
When preparing the mixtures, it is preferred to employ the pure active compounds I and II, to which further active compounds against harmful fungi or other pests, such as insects, arachnids or nematodes, or else herbicidal or growth-regulating active ingredients or fertilizers can be admixed.<br>
The mixtures of the compounds I and II, or the compounds I and ll used simultaneously, jointly or separately, exhibit outstanding  activity against a wide range of phytopathogenic fungi, in particular from the classes of the Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes, Phycomycetes and Deuteromycetes. Some of them act systemically and can therefore be employed as foliar- and soil-acting fungicides,<br><br>
They are especially important for controlling a.large number of fungi in a variety of crop plants, such as cotton, vegetable species (e.g. cucumbers, beans, tomatoes, potatoes and cucurbits), barley, grass, oats, bananas, coffee, maize, fruit species, rice, rye, soya, grapevine, wheat, ornamentals, sugar cane, and a variety of seeds.<br>
They are particularly suitable for controlling the following phytopathogenic fungi: Erysiphe graminis (powdery mildew) in cereals, Erysiphe cichoracearum and Sphaerotheca fuliginea in cucurbits, Podosphaera leucotricha in apples, Uncinula necator in grapevines, Puccinia species in cereals, Rhizoctonia species in cotton, rice and lawns, Ustilago species in cereals and sugar cane, Venturia inaequalis (scab) in apples, Helminthosporium species in cereals, Septoria nodorum in wheat, Botrytis cinera (gray mold) in strawberries, vegetables, ornamentals and grapevines, Cercospora arachidicola in groundnuts, Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides in wheat and barley, Pyricularia oryzae in rice, Phytophthora infestans in potatoes and tomatoes, Plasmopara viticola in grapevines, Pseudoperonospora species in hops and cucumbers, Alternaria species in vegetables and fruit, Mycosphaerella species in bananas and Fusarium and Verticillium species-<br>
They can furthermore be employed in the protection of materials (for example the protection of wood), for example against Paecilomyces variotii.<br>
The compounds I and II can be applied simultaneously, that is either together or separately, or successively, the sequence, in the case of separate application, generally not having any effect on the result of the control measures.<br>
Depending on the kind of effect desired, the application rates of the mixtures according to the invention are, in particular in agricultural crop areas, from 0,01 to 10 kg/ha, preferably 0.1 to 5 kg/ha, in particular 0.2 to 3-0 kg/ha.<br>
The application rates of the compounds I are from 0.005 to I 6.0 kg/ha, preferably 0.08 to 3-0 kg/ha, in particular 0.12 to 2.0 kg/ha.<br>
Correspondingly, in the case of the compounds II, the application rates are from 0.005 to 4.0 kg/ha, preferably 0.02 to 2.0 kg/ha, * in particular 0.08 to 1.0 kg/ha.<br><br>
generally from 0,001 to 250 g/kg of seed, preferably 0.01 to 100 g/kg, in particular 0,01 to 50 g/kg.<br>
If phytopathogenic harmful fungi are to be controlled, the separate or joint application of the compounds I and II or of the mixtures of the compounds I and II is effected by spraying or dusting the seeds, the plants or the soils before or after sowing of the plants, or before or after plant emergence.<br>
The fungicidal synergistic mixtures according to the invention or the compounds I and II can be formulated for example in the form of ready-to-spray solutions, powder and suspensions or in the form of highly concentrated aqueous, oily or other suspensions, dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dusts, materials for broadcasting or granules, and applied by spraying, atomizing, dusting, broadcasting or watering. The use form depends on the intended purpose; in any case, it should ensure as fine and uniform as possible a distribution of the mixture according to the invention.<br>
The formulations are prepared in a known manner, e.g. by extending the active compound with solvents and/or carriers, if desired using emulsifiers and dispersants, it being possible also to use other organic solvents as auxiliary solvents if water is used as the diluent- Suitable auxiliaries for this purpose are essentially: solvents such as aromatics (e.g. xylene), chlorinated aromatics (e.g. chlorobenzenes), paraffins (e.g. mineral oil fractions), alcohols (e.g. methanol, butanol), ketones (e.g. cyclohexanone), amines (e.g. ethanolamine, dimethylformamide) and water; carriers such as ground natural minerals (e.g. kaolins, clays, talc, chalk) and ground synthetic minerals (e.g. finely divided silica, silicates); emulsifiers such as nonionic and anionic emulsifiers (e.g. polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, alkylsulfonates and arylsulfonates) and dispersants such as lignosulfite waste liquors and methyIcellulose-<br>
Suitable surfactants are the alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts and ammonium salts of aromatic sulfonic acids, e.g. ligno-, phenol-, naphthalene- and dibutylnaphthalenesulfonic acid, and of fatty acids, alkyl- and alkylarylsulfonates, alkyl, lauryl ether and fatty alcohol sulfates, and salts of sulfated hexa-, hepta- and octadecanols, or of fatty alcohol glycol ethers, condensates of sulfonated naphthalene and its derivatives with formaldehyde, condensates of naphthalene or of the naphthalenesulfonic acids with phenol and formaldehyde.<br><br>
polyoxyethylene octylphenol ether, ethoxylated isooctyi-, octyl-or nonylphenol, alkylphenyl or tributylphenyl polyglycol ethers, alkylaryl polyether alcohols, isotridecyl alcohol, fatty alcohol/ethylene oxide condensates, ethoxylated castor oil, polyoxyethylene'alkyl ethers or polyoxypropylene, lauryl alcohol polyglycol ether acetate, sorbitol esters, lignosulfite waste liquors or methylcellulose.<br>
Powders, materials for broadcasting and dusts can be prepared by mixing or jointly grinding the compounds I or II or the mixture of the compounds I and II with a solid carrier.<br>
Granules (e.g. coated granules, impregnated granules or homogeneous granules) are usually prepared by binding the active compound, or active compounds, to a solid carrier.<br>
Fillers or solid carriers are, for example, mineral earths, such as silicas, silica gels, silicates, talc, kaolin, limestone, lime, chalk, bole, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic materials and fertilizers, such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas, and products of vegetable origin, such as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and nutshell meal, cellulose powders or other solid carriers.<br>
The formulations generally comprise from 0,1 to 95% by weight, preferably 0.5 to 90% by weight, of one of the compounds I and II or of the mixture of the compounds I and II. The active compounds are employed in a purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably 95% to 100% (according to NMR or HPLC spectrum).<br>
The compounds I or II, the mixtures, or the corresponding formulations, are applied by treating the harmful fungi, their habitat, or the plants, seeds, soils, areas, materials or spaces to be kept free from them with a fungicidally effective amount of the mixture, or of the compounds I and II in the case of separate application.<br>
Application can be effected before or after infection by the  harmful fungi.<br>
Use Example<br>
The synergistic activity of the mixtures according to the  invention can be demonstrated by the following experiments:<br><br>
The active compounds, separately or together, are formulated as a 10% emulsion in a mixture of 63% by weight of cyclohexanone and 27% by weight of emulsifier, and diluted with water to the desired concentration.<br>
Evaluation is carried out by determining the infected leaf areas in percent. These percentages are converted into efficacies. The efficacy (H) is calculated as follows using Abbot's formula:<br>
W = (1-a /p &gt; 100<br>
a  corresponds to the fungal infection of the treated plants in<br>
% and β   corresponds to the fungal infection of the untreated<br>
(control) plants in %<br>
An efficacy of 0 means that the infection level of the treated plants corresponds to that of the untreated control plants; an efficacy of 100 means that the treated plants were not infected.<br>
The expected efficacies of the mixtures of the active compounds were determined using Colby's formula [R-S. Colby, Weeds 15., 20-22 (1967)] and compared with the observed efficacies-<br>
Colby's formula: E = x + y - x-y/lOO<br>
E   expected efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control,<br>
when using the mixture of the active compounds A and B at the<br>
concentrations a and b X  efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using<br>
active compound A at a concentration of a y  efficacy expressed in % of the untreated control, when usinq<br>
active compound B at a concentration of b.<br>
Use example 1: Protective activity against mildew of cucumber caused by Sphaerotheca fuliginea<br>
Leaves of cucumber seedlings of the cultivar "Chinese snake" which had been grown in pots were, at the cotyledon stage, sprayed to runoff point with an aqueous preparation of active compound which had been prepared from a stock solution comprising 10% of active compound, 85% of cyclohexanone and 5% of emulsifier. 20 hours after the spray coating had dried on, the plants were inoculated with an aqueous spore suspension of mildew of cucumber (Sphaerotheca fuliginea).   The plants were then cultivated in a greenhouse at 20-24°C and 60-80% relative<br><br>
atmospheric humidity for 7 days. The extent of the mildew ' development was then determined visually in % infection of the cotyledon surface.<br>
The visually determined values for the percentage of infected leaf areas were converted into efficacies in % of the untreated control. An efficacy of 0 means the same infection as in the untreated control, an efficacy of 100 means 0% infection- The expected efficacies for combinations of active compounds were determined using Colby's formula (Colby, S, R* (Calculating synergistic and antagonistic responses of herbicide Combinations", Weeds, 15, pp- 20 - 22, 1967) and compared to the observed efficacies*<br><br><br><br><br><br>
*) calculated using Colby's formula<br>
The test results show that, for all mixing ratios, the observed efficacy is higher than the efficacy calculated beforehand using Colby's formula (from Synerg 166A, XLS).<br><br><br><br>
