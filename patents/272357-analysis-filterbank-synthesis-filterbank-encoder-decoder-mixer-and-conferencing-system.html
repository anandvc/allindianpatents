Analysis Filterbank, Synthesis Filterbank, Encoder, De-<br>
coder, Mixer and Conferencing System<br>
Background<br>
The present invention relates to an analysis filterbank, a<br>
synthesis filterbank and systems comprising any of the<br>
aforementioned filterbanks, which can, for instance, be im-<br>
plemented in the field of modern audio encoding, audio de-<br>
coding or other audio transmission-related applications.<br>
Moreover, the present invention also relates to a mixer and<br>
a conferencing system.<br>
Modern digital audio processing is typically based on cod-<br>
ing schemes which enable a significant reduction in terms<br>
of bitrates, transmission bandwidths and storage space,<br>
compared to a direct transmission or storage of the respec-<br>
tive audio data. This is achieved by encoding the audio<br>
data on the sender site and decoding the encoded data on<br>
the receiver site before, for instance, providing the de-<br>
coded audio data to a listener.<br>
Such digital audio processing systems can be implemented<br>
with respect to a wide range of parameters comprising a<br>
typical storage space for a typical potentailly standard-<br>
ized stream of audio data, bitrates, computational complex-<br>
ity especially in terms of an efficiency of an implementa-<br>
tion, achievable qualities suitable for different applica-<br>
tions and in terms of the delay caused during both, the en-<br>
coding and the decoding of the audio data and the encoded<br>
audio data, respectively. In other words, digital audio<br>
systems can be applied in many different fields of applica-<br>
tions ranging from an ultra-low quality transmission to a<br>
 <br>
high-end-transmission and storage of audio data (e.g. for a<br>
high-quality music listening experience).<br>
However, in many cases compromises may have to be taken in<br>
terms of the different parameters such as the bitrate, the<br>
computational complexity, quality and delay. For instance,<br>
a digital audio system comprising a low delay may require a<br>
higher bitrate of a transmission bandwidth compared to an<br>
audio system with a higher delay at a comparable quality<br>
level.<br>

Detailed Description of the Embodiments<br>
Figs. 1 to 24 show block diagrams and further diagrams de-<br>
scribing the functional properties and features of differ-<br>
ent embodiments of an analysis filterbank, a synthesis fil-<br>
terbank, an encoder, a decoder, a mixer, a conferencing<br>
system and other embodiments of the present invention. How-<br>
ever, before describing an embodiment of a synthesis fil-<br>
terbank, with respect to Figs. 1 and 2, an embodiment of an<br>
analysis filterbank and a schematic representation of input<br>
frames being processed by an embodiment of an analysis fil-<br>
terbank will be described in more detail.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a first embodiment of an analysis filterbank<br>
100 comprising a windower 110 and time/frequency converter<br>
120. To be more precise, the windower 110 is configured to<br>
receiving a plurality of time-domain input frames, each in-<br>
put frame comprising a number of ordered input samples at<br>
an input 110i. The windower 110 is furthermore adapted to<br>
generating a plurality of windowed frames, which are pro-<br>
vided by the windower at the output 110o of the windower<br>
110. Each of the windowed frames comprises a plurality of<br>
windowed samples, wherein the windower 110 is furthermore<br>
configured to processing the plurality of windowed frames<br>
in an overlapping manner using a sample advance value as<br>
will be explained in more detail in the context of Fig. 2.<br>
 <br>
The time/frequency converter 120 is capable of receiving<br>
the windowed frames as output by the windower 110 and con-<br>
figured to providing an output frame comprising a number of<br>
output values, such that an output frame is a spectral rep-<br>
resentation of a windowed frame.<br>
In order to illustrate and outline, the functional proper-<br>
ties and features of an embodiment of an analysis filter-<br>
bank 100, Fig. 2 shows a schematic representation of five<br>
input frames 130-(k-3), 130-(k-2), 130-(k-1), 130-k and<br>
130-(k+1) as a function of time, as indicated by an arrow<br>
140 at the bottom of Fig. 2.<br>
In the following, the operation of an embodiment of an<br>
analysis filterbank 100 will be described in more detail<br>
with reference to the input frame 130-k, as indicated by<br>
the dashed line in Fig. 2. With respect to this input frame<br>
130-k, the input frame 103-(k+1) is a future input frame,<br>
whereas the three input frames 130-(k-1), 130-(k-2), and<br>
130-(k-3) are past input frames. In other words, k is an<br>
integer indicating a frame index, such that the larger the<br>
frame index is, the farther the respective input frame is<br>
located "in the future". Accordingly, the smaller the index<br>
k is, the farther the input frame is located "in the past".<br>
Each of the input frames 130 comprises at least two subsec-<br>
tions 150, which are equally long. To be more precise, in<br>
the case of an embodiment of an analysis filterbank 100, on<br>
which the schematic representation shown in Fig. 2 is<br>
based, the input frame 130-k as well as the other input<br>
frames 130 comprise subsections 150-2, 150-3 and 150-4<br>
which are equal in length in terms of input samples. Each<br>
of these subsections 150 of the input frame 130 comprises M<br>
input samples, wherein M is a positive integer. Moreover,<br>
the input frame 130 also comprises a first subsection 150-1<br>
which may comprise also M input frames. In this case, the<br>
first subsection 150-1 comprises an initial section 160 of<br>
the input frame 130, which may comprise input samples or<br>
 <br>
other values, as will be explain in more detail at a later<br>
stage. However, depending on the concrete implementation of<br>
the embodiment of an analysis filterbank, the first subsec-<br>
tion 150-1 is not required to comprise an initial section<br>
160 at all. In other words, the first subsection 150-1 may<br>
in principle comprise a lower number of input samples com-<br>
pared to the other subsections 150-2, 150-3, 150-4. Exam-<br>
ples for this case will also be illustrated later on.<br>
Optionally, apart from the first subsection 150-1, the<br>
other subsections 150-2, 150-3, 150-4 comprise typically<br>
the same number of input samples M, which is equal to the<br>
socalled sample advance value 170, which indicates a number<br>
of input samples by which two consecutive input frames 130<br>
are moved with respect to time and each other. In other<br>
words, as the sample advance value M, as indicated by an<br>
arrow 170 is, in the case of an embodiment of an analysis<br>
filterbank 100, as illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2 equal to<br>
the length of the subsections 150-2, 150-3, 150-4, the in-<br>
put frames 130 are generated and processed by the windower<br>
110 in an overlapping manner. Furthermore, the sample ad-<br>
vance value M (arrow 170) is also identical with the length<br>
of the subsections 150-2 to 150-4.<br>
The input frames 130-k and 130-(k+1) are, hence, in terms<br>
of a significant number of input samples, equal in the<br>
sense that both input frames comprise these input samples,<br>
while they are shifted with respect to the individual sub-<br>
sections 150 of the two input frames 130. To be more pre-<br>
cise, the third subsection 150-3 of the input frame 130-k<br>
is equal to the fourth subsection 150-4 of the input frame<br>
130-(k+1). Accordingly, the second subsection 150-2 of the<br>
input frame 130-k is identical to the third subsection 150-<br>
3 of the input frame 130-(k+1).<br>
In yet other words, the two input frames 130-k, 130-(k+1)<br>
corresponding to the frame indices k and (k+1) are in terms<br>
of two subsections 150 in the case of the embodiments shown<br>
 <br>
in Fig. 2, identical, apart from the fact that in terms of<br>
the input frame with the index frame (k+1), the samples are<br>
moved.<br>
The two aforementioned input frames 130-k and 130-(k+1)<br>
furthermore share at least one sample from the first sub-<br>
section 150-1 of the input frame 130-k. To be more precise,<br>
in the case of the embodiment shown in Fig. 2, all input<br>
samples in the first subsection 150-1 of the input frame<br>
130-k, which are not part of the initial section 160, ap-<br>
pear as part of the second subsection 150-2 of the input<br>
frame 130-(k+1). However, the input samples of the second<br>
subsection 150-2 corresponding to the initial section 160<br>
of the input frame 130-k before, may or may not be based on<br>
the input values or input samples of the initial section<br>
160 of the respective input frame 130, depending on the<br>
concrete implementation of an embodiment of an analysis<br>
filterbank.<br>
In the case of the initial section 160 existing so that the<br>
number of input frames in the first subsection 150-1 is<br>
equal to the number of input samples in the other subsec-<br>
tions 150-2 to 150-4, in principle two different cases have<br>
to be considered, although also further cases in between<br>
these two "extreme" cases, which will be explained, are<br>
possible.<br>
If the initial section 160 comprises "meaningful" encoded<br>
input samples in the sense that the input samples in the<br>
initial section 160 do represent an audio signal in the<br>
time-domain, these input samples will also be part of the<br>
subsection 150-2 of the following input frame 130-(k+l).<br>
This case, is however, in many applications of an embodi-<br>
ment of an analysis filterbank, not an optimal implementa-<br>
tion, as this option might cause additional delay.<br>
In the case, however, that the initial section 160 does not<br>
comprise "meaningful" input samples, which in this case can<br>
 <br>
also be referred to as input values, the corresponding in-<br>
put values of the initial section 160 may comprise random<br>
values, a predetermined, fixed, adaptable or programmable<br>
value, which can for instance be provided in terms of an<br>
algorithmic calculation, determination or other fixing by a<br>
unit or module, which may be coupled to the input 110i of<br>
the windower 110 of the embodiment of the analysis filter-<br>
bank. In this case, however, this module is typically re-<br>
quired to provide as the input frame 130-(k+1), an input<br>
frame which comprises in the second subsection 150-2 in the<br>
area corresponding to the initial section 160 of the input<br>
frame before "meaningful" input samples, which do corre-<br>
spond to the corresponding audio signal. Moreover, the unit<br>
or module coupled to the input HOi of the windower 110 is<br>
typically also required to provide meaningful input samples<br>
corresponding to the audio signal in the framework of the<br>
first subsection 150-1 of the input frame 130-(k+1).<br>
In other words, in this case, the input frame 130-k corre-<br>
sponding to the frame index k is provided to the embodiment<br>
of an analysis filterbank 100 after sufficient input sam-<br>
ples are gathered, such that the subsection 150-1 of this<br>
input frame can be filled with these input samples. The<br>
rest of the first subsection 150-1, namely the initial sec-<br>
tion 160 is then filled up with input samples or input val-<br>
ues, which may comprise random values or any other values<br>
such as a predetermined, fixed, adaptable or programmable<br>
value or any other combination of values. As this can, in<br>
principle, be done at a very high speed compared to a typi-<br>
cal sampling frequency, providing the initial section 160<br>
of the input frame 130-k with such "meaningless" input sam-<br>
ples, does not require a significant period of time on the<br>
scale presented by a typical sampling frequency, such as a<br>
sampling frequency in the range between a few kHz and up to<br>
several 100 kHz.<br>
However, the unit or module continues collecting input sam-<br>
ples based on the audio signal to incorporate these input<br>
 <br>
samples into the following input frame 130-(k+1) corre-<br>
sponding to the frame index k+1. In other words, although<br>
the module or unit did not finish collecting sufficient in-<br>
put samples to provide the input frame 130-k in terms of<br>
the first subsection 150-1 with sufficient input samples to<br>
completely fill up the first subsection 150-1 of this input<br>
frame, but provides this input frame to the embodiment of<br>
the analysis filterbank 100 as soon as enough input samples<br>
are available, such that the first subsection 150-1 can be<br>
filled up with input samples without the initial section<br>
160.<br>
The following input samples will be used to fill up the re-<br>
maining input samples of the second subsection 150-2 of the<br>
following input frame 130-(k+1) until enough input samples<br>
are gathered, such that the first subsection 150-1 of this<br>
next input frame can also be filled until the initial sec-<br>
tion 160 of this frame begins. Next, once again, the ini-<br>
tial section 160 will be filled up with random numbers or<br>
other "meaningless" input samples or input values.<br>
As a consequence, although the sample advance value 170,<br>
which is equal to the length of the subsection 150-2 to<br>
150-4 in the case of the embodiment shown in Fig. 2 is in-<br>
dicated in Pig. 2 and the error representing the sample ad-<br>
vance value 170 is shown in Fig. 2 from the beginning of<br>
the initial section 160 of the input frame 130-k until the<br>
beginning of the initial section 160 of the following input<br>
frame 130-(k+1).<br>
As a further consequence, an input sample corresponding to<br>
an event in the audio signal corresponding to the initial<br>
section 160 will in the last two cases will not be present<br>
in the respective input frames 130-k, but in the following<br>
input frame 130-(k+1) in the framework of the second sub-<br>
section 150-2.<br>
 <br>
In other words, many embodiments of an analysis filterbank<br>
100 may provide an output frame with a reduced delay as the<br>
input samples corresponding to the initial section 160 are<br>
not part of the respective input frame 130-k but will only<br>
be influencing the later input frame 130-(k+1). In other<br>
words, an embodiment of an analysis filterbank may offer in<br>
many applications and implementations the advantage of pro-<br>
viding the output frame based on the input frame sooner, as<br>
the first subsection 150-1 is not required to comprise the<br>
same number of input samples as the other subsection 150-2<br>
to 150-4. However, the information comprised in the "miss-<br>
ing section" is comprised in the next input frame 130 in<br>
the framework of the second subsection 150-2 of that re-<br>
spective input frame 130.<br>
However, as indicated earlier, there may also exist the<br>
case, in which none of the input frames 130 does comprise<br>
the initial section 160. In this case, the length of each<br>
of the input frames 130 is no longer an integer multiple of<br>
the sample advance value 170 or the length of the subsec-<br>
tion 150-2 to 150-4. To be more precise, in this case, the<br>
length of each of the input frames 130 differs from the<br>
corresponding integer multiples of the sample advance value<br>
by the number of input samples, which the module or unit<br>
providing the windower 110 with the respective input frames<br>
stops short of providing the full first subsection 150-1.<br>
In other words, the overall length of such an input frame<br>
130 differs from the respective integer number of sample<br>
advance values by the difference between the lengths of the<br>
first subsection 150-1 compared to the length of the other<br>
subsections 150-2 to 150-4.<br>
However, in the last two cases mentioned, the module or<br>
unit, which can for instance comprise a sampler, a sample-<br>
and-hold-stage, a sample-and-holder or a quantizer, may<br>
start providing the corresponding input frame 130 short of<br>
a predetermined number of input samples, such that each of<br>
the input frames 130 can be provided to the embodiment of<br>
 <br>
an analysis filterbank 100 with a shorter delay as compared<br>
to the case in which the complete first subsection 150-1 is<br>
filled with corresponding input samples.<br>
As already indicated, such a unit or module which can be<br>
coupled to the input 110i of the windower 110 may for in-<br>
stance comprise a sampler and/or a quantizer such as an<br>
analog/digital converter (A/D converter) . However, depend-<br>
ing on the concrete implementation, such a module or unit<br>
may further comprise some memory or registers to store the<br>
input samples corresponding to the audio signal.<br>
Moreover, such a unit or module may provide each of the in-<br>
put frames in an overlapping manner, based on a sample ad-<br>
vanced value M. In other words, an input frame comprises<br>
more than twice the number of input samples compared to the<br>
number of samples gathered per frame or block. Such a unit<br>
or module is in many embodiments adapted such that two con-<br>
secutively generated input frames are based on a plurality<br>
of samples which are shifted with respect to time by the<br>
sample advance value. In this case, the later input frame<br>
of the two consecutively generated input frames is based on<br>
at least one fresh output sample as the earliest output<br>
sample and the aforementioned plurality of samples is<br>
shifted later by the sample advance value in the earlier<br>
input frame of the two input frames.<br>
Although, so far an embodiment of an analysis filterbank<br>
100 has been described in terms of each input frame 130<br>
comprising four subsections 150, wherein the first subsec-<br>
tion 150 is not required to comprise the same number of in-<br>
put samples as the other subsections, it is not required to<br>
be equal to four as in the case shown in Fig. 2. To be more<br>
precise, an input frame 130 may comprise in principle, an<br>
arbitrary number of input samples, which is larger than<br>
twice the size of the sample advance value M (arrow 170),<br>
wherein the number of input values of the initial section<br>
160, if present, are required to be included in this num-<br>
 <br>
ber, as it might be helpful considering some implementa-<br>
tions of an embodiment based on a system utilizing frames,<br>
wherein each frame comprises a number of samples which is<br>
identical to the sample advance value. In other words, any<br>
number of subsections, each having a length identical to<br>
the sample advance value M (arrow 170) can be used in the<br>
framework of an embodiment of an analysis filterbank 100,<br>
which is greater or equal to three in the case of a frame<br>
based system. If this is not the case, in principle, any<br>
number of input samples per input frame 130 can be utilized<br>
being greater than twice the sample advance value.<br>
The windower 110 of an embodiment of an analysis filterbank<br>
100, as shown in Fig. 1, is configured to generating a plu-<br>
rality of windowed frames based on the corresponding input<br>
frames 130 on the basis of the sample advance value M (ar-<br>
row 170) in an overlapping manner as previously explained.<br>
To be more precise, depending on the concrete implementa-<br>
tion of a windower 110, the windower 110 is configured to<br>
generating the windowed frame, based on a weighing func-<br>
tion, which may for instance comprise a logarithmic depend-<br>
ence to model the hearing characteristics of the human ear.<br>
However, other weighing functions may also be implemented,<br>
such as a weighing function modeling, the psycho-acoustic<br>
characteristics of the human ear. However, the windower<br>
function is implemented in an embodiment of an analysis<br>
filterbank, can, for instance, also be implemented such<br>
that each of the input samples of an input frame is multi-<br>
plied by a real-valued windower function comprising real-<br>
valued sample-specific window coefficients.<br>
An example for such an implementation is shown in Fig. 2.<br>
To be more precise, Fig. 2 shows a schematical crude repre-<br>
sentation of a possible window function or a windowing<br>
function 180, by which the windower 110, as shown in Fig. 1<br>
generates the windowed frames, based on the corresponding<br>
input frames 130. Depending on the concrete implementation<br>
of an analysis filterbank 100, the windower 110 can fur-<br>
 <br>
thermore provide windowed frames to the time/frequency con-<br>
verter 120 in a different way.<br>
Based on each of the input frames 130, the windower 110 is<br>
configured to generating a windowed frame, wherein each of<br>
the windowed frames comprises a plurality of windowed sam-<br>
ples. To be more precise, the windower 110 can be config-<br>
ured in different ways. Depending on the length of an input<br>
frame 130 and depending on the length of the windowed frame<br>
to be provided to the time/frequency provider 120, several<br>
possibilities of how the windower 110 is implemented to<br>
generate the windowed frames can be realized.<br>
If, for instance, an input frame 130 comprises an initial<br>
section 160, so that in a case of an embodiment shown in<br>
Fig. 2 the first subsection 150-1 of each of the input<br>
frames 130 comprises as many input values or input samples<br>
as the other subsections 150-2 to 150-4, the windower 110<br>
can for instance be configured such that the windowed frame<br>
also comprises the same number of windowed samples as the<br>
input frame 130 comprises input samples of input values. In<br>
this case, due to the structure of the input frames 130, as<br>
described before, all the input samples of the input frame<br>
apart from the input values of the input frames 130 in the<br>
initial section 160 may be processed by the windower 110<br>
based on the windowing function or the window function as<br>
previously described. The input values of the initial sec-<br>
tion 160 may, in this case, be set to a predetermined value<br>
or to at least one value in a predetermined range.<br>
The predetermined value may for instance be an embodiment<br>
of some analysis filterbank 100 equal to "the value 0<br>
(zero), whereas in other embodiments, different values may<br>
be desirable. For instance, it is possible to use, in prin-<br>
ciple, any value with respect to the initial section 160 of<br>
the input frames 130, which indicates that the correspond-<br>
ing values are of no significance in terms of the audio<br>
signal. For instance, the predetermined value may be a<br>
 <br>
value which is outside of a typical range of input samples<br>
of an audio signal. For instance, windowed samples inside a<br>
section of the windowed frame corresponding to the initial<br>
section 160 of the input frame 130 may be set to a value of<br>
twice or more the maximum amplitude of an input audio sig-<br>
nal indicating that these values do not correspond to sig-<br>
nals to be processed further. Other values, for instance<br>
negative values of an implementation-specific absolute<br>
value, may also be used.<br>
Moreover, in embodiments of an analysis filterbank 100,<br>
windowed samples of the windowed frames corresponding to<br>
the initial section 160 of an input frame 130 can also be<br>
set to one or more values in a predetermined range. In<br>
principle, such a predetermined range, may for instance be<br>
a range of small values, which are in terms of an audio ex-<br>
perience meaningless, so that the outcome is audibly indis-<br>
tinguishable or so that the listening experience is not<br>
significantly disturbed. In this case, the predetermined<br>
range may for instance be expressed as a set of values hav-<br>
ing an absolute value, which is smaller than or equal to a<br>
predetermined, programmable, adaptable or fixed maximum<br>
threshold. Such a threshold may for instance be expressed<br>
as a power of 10 or a power or two as 10s or 2s, where the<br>
s is an integer value depending on the concrete implementa-<br>
tion.<br>
However, in principle the predetermined range may also com-<br>
prise values, which are larger than some meaningful values.<br>
To be more precise, the predetermined range may also com-<br>
prise values, which comprise an absolute value, which is<br>
larger than or equal to a programmable, predetermined or<br>
fixed minimum threshold. Such a minimum threshold may in<br>
principle be expressed once again in terms of a power of<br>
two or a power of ten, as 2s or 10s, wherein s is once<br>
again an integer depending on the concrete implementation<br>
of an embodiment of an analysis filterbank.<br>
 <br>
In the case of a digital implementation, the predetermined<br>
range can for instance comprise values which are expressi-<br>
ble by setting or not setting the least significant bit or<br>
plurality of least significant bits in the case of a prede-<br>
termined range comprising small values. In the case that<br>
the predetermined range comprises larger values, as previ-<br>
ously explained the predetermined range may comprise val-<br>
ues, representable by setting or not setting the most sig-<br>
nificant bit or a plurality of most significant bits. How-<br>
ever, the predetermined value as well as the predetermined<br>
ranges may also comprise other values, which can for in-<br>
stance be created based on the aforementioned values and<br>
thresholds by multiplying these with a factor.<br>
Depending on the concrete implementation of an embodiment<br>
of an analysis filterbank 100, the windower 110 may also be<br>
adapted such that the windowed frames provided at the out-<br>
put HOo do not comprise windowed samples corresponding to<br>
input frames of the initial sections 160 of the input<br>
frames 130. In this case, the length of the windowed frame<br>
and the length of the corresponding input frames 130, may<br>
for instance differ by the length of the initial section<br>
160. In other words, in this case, the windower 110 may be<br>
configured or adapted to disregarding at least a latest in-<br>
put sample according to the order of the input samples as<br>
previously described in terms of time. In other words, in<br>
some embodiments of an analysis filterbank 100, the win-<br>
dower 110 may be configured such that one or more or even<br>
all input values or input samples of the initial section<br>
160 of an input frame 130 are disregarded. In this case,<br>
the length of the windowed frame is equal to the difference<br>
between the lengths of the input frame 130 and the length<br>
of the initial section 160 of the input frame 130.<br>
As a further option, each of the input frames 130 may not<br>
comprise an initial section 160 at all, as indicated be-<br>
fore. In this case, the first subsection 150~1 differs in<br>
terms of the length of the respective subsection 150, or in<br>
 <br>
terms of the number of input samples from the other subsec-<br>
tions 150-2 to 150-4. In this case, the windowed frame, may<br>
or may not, comprise windowed samples or windowed values<br>
such that a similar first subsection of the windowed frame<br>
corresponding to the first subsection 150-1 of the input<br>
frame 130 comprises the same number as windowed samples or<br>
windowed values as the other subsections corresponding to<br>
the subsections 150 of the input frame 130. In this case,<br>
the additional windowed samples or windowed values can be<br>
set to a predetermined value or at least one value in the<br>
predetermined range, as indicated earlier.<br>
Moreover, the windower 110 may be configured in embodiments<br>
of an analysis filterbank 100 such that both, the input<br>
frame 130 and the resulting windowed frame comprise the<br>
same number of values or samples and wherein both, the in-<br>
put frame 130 and the resulting windowed frames do not com-<br>
prise the initial section 160 or samples corresponding to<br>
the initial section 160. In this case, the first subsection<br>
150-1 of the input frame 130 as well as the corresponding<br>
subsection of the windowed frame comprise less values or<br>
samples compared to the other subsections 150-2 to 150-4 of<br>
the input frame 130 of the corresponding subsections of the<br>
windowed frame.<br>
It should be noted that, in principle, the windowed frame<br>
is not required to correspond either to a length of an in-<br>
put frame 130 comprising an initial section 160, or to an<br>
input frame 130 not comprising an initial section 160. In<br>
principle, the windower 110 may also be adapted such that<br>
the windowed frame comprises one or more values or samples<br>
corresponding to values of the initial section 160 of an<br>
input frame 130.<br>
In this context, it should also be noted that in some em-<br>
bodiments of an analysis filterbank 100, the initial sec-<br>
tion 160 represents or at least comprises a connected sub-<br>
set of sample indices n corresponding to a connected subset<br>
 <br>
of input values or input samples of an input frame 130.<br>
Hence, if applicable, also the windowed frames comprising a<br>
corresponding initial section comprises a connected subset<br>
of sample indices n of windowed samples corresponding to<br>
the respective initial section of the windowed frame, which<br>
is also referred to as the starting section or start sec-<br>
tion of the windowed frame. The rest of the windowed frame<br>
without the initial section or starting section, which is<br>
sometimes also referred to as the remainder section.<br>
As already previously indicated, the windower 110 can in<br>
embodiments of an analysis filterbank 100 be adapted to<br>
generating the windowed samples of windowed values of a<br>
windowed frame not corresponding to the initial section 160<br>
of an input frame 130, if present at all, based on a window<br>
function which may incorporate psycho-acoustic models, for<br>
instance, in terms of generating the windowed samples based<br>
on a logarithmic calculation based on the corresponding in-<br>
put samples. However, the windower 110 can also be adapted<br>
in different embodiments of an analysis filterbank 100,<br>
such that each of the windowed samples is generated by mul-<br>
tiplying a corresponding input sample with a sample-<br>
specific windowed coefficient of the window function de-<br>
fined over a definition set.<br>
In many embodiments of an analysis filterbank 100, the cor-<br>
responding windower 110 is adapted such that the window<br>
function, as for instance, described by the window coeffi-<br>
cients, is asymmetric over the definition set with respect<br>
to a midpoint of the definition set. Furthermore, in many<br>
embodiments of an analysis filterbank 100, the window coef-<br>
ficients of the window function comprise an absolute value<br>
of more than 10%, 20% or 30%, 50% of a maximum absolute<br>
value of all window coefficients of the window function in<br>
the first half of the definition set with respect to the<br>
midpoint, wherein the window function comprises less window<br>
coefficients having an absolute value of more than the<br>
aforementioned percentage of the maximum absolute value of<br>
 <br>
the window coefficients in the second half of the defini-<br>
tion set, with respect to the midpoint. Such a window func-<br>
tion is schematically shown in context of each of the input<br>
frames 130 in Fig. 2 as the window function 180. More exam-<br>
ples of window functions will be described in the context<br>
of the Figs. 5 to 11, including a brief discussion of spec-<br>
tral and other properties and opportunities offered by some<br>
embodiments of an analysis filterbank as well as a synthe-<br>
sis filterbank implementing window functions as shown in<br>
these figures and described in passages.<br>
Apart from the windower 110, an embodiment of an analysis<br>
filterbank 100 also comprises the time/frequency converter<br>
120, which is provided with the windowed frames from the<br>
windower 110. The time/frequency converter 120 is in turn<br>
adapted to generating an output frame or a plurality of<br>
output frames for each of the windowed frames such that the<br>
output frame is a spectral representation of the corre-<br>
sponding windowed frame. As will be explained in more de-<br>
tail later on, the time/frequency converter 120 is adapted<br>
such that the output frame comprises less than half the<br>
number of output values compared to the number of input<br>
samples of an input frame, or compared to half the number<br>
of windowed samples of a windowed frame.<br>
Furthermore, the time/frequency converter 120 may be imple-<br>
mented such that it is based on a discrete cosine transform<br>
and/or a discrete sine transform such that the number of<br>
output samples of an output frame is less than half the<br>
number of input samples of an input frame. However, more<br>
implementation details of possible embodiments of an analy-<br>
sis filterbank 100 will be outlined shortly.<br>
In some embodiments of an analysis filterbank, a<br>
time/frequency converter 120 is configured such that it<br>
outputs a number of output samples, which is equal to the<br>
number of input samples of a starting section 150-2, 150-3,<br>
150-4, which is not the starting section of the first sub-<br>
 <br>
section 150-1 of the input frame 130, or which is identical<br>
to the sample advance value 170. In other words, in many<br>
embodiments of an analysis filterbank 100, the number of<br>
output samples is equal to the integer M representing the<br>
sample advance value of a length of the aforementioned sub-<br>
section 150 of the input frame 130. Typical values of the<br>
sample advance value or M are in many embodiments 480 or<br>
512. However, it should be noted that also different inte-<br>
gers M can easily be implemented in embodiments of an<br>
analysis filterbank, such as M = 360.<br>
Moreover, it should be noted that in some embodiments of an<br>
analysis filterbank the initial section 160 of an input<br>
frame 130 or the difference between the number of samples<br>
in the other subsections 150-2, 150-3, 150-4 and the first<br>
subsection 150-1 of an input frame 130 is equal to M/4. In<br>
other words, in the case of an embodiment of an analysis<br>
filterbank 100 in which M = 480, the length of the initial<br>
section 160 or the aforementioned difference is equal to<br>
120 (=M/4) samples, whereas in the case of M = 512, the<br>
length of the initial section 160 of the aforementioned<br>
difference is equal to 128 (=M/4) in some embodiments of an<br>
analysis filterbank 100. It should, however, be noted that<br>
also in this case different lengths can also be implemented<br>
and do not represent a limit in terms of an embodiment of<br>
an analysis filterbank 100.<br>
As also indicated earlier, as the time/frequency converter<br>
120 can for instance be based on a discrete cosine trans-<br>
form or a discrete sine transform, embodiments of an analy-<br>
sis filterbank are sometimes also discussed and explained<br>
in terms of parameter N = 2M representing a length of an<br>
input frame of a modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT)<br>
converter. In the aforementioned embodiments of an analysis<br>
filterbank 100, the parameter N is hence equal to 960 (M =<br>
480) and 1024 (M = 512).<br>
 <br>
As will be explained in more detail later on, embodiments<br>
of an analysis filterbank 100 may offer as an advantage a<br>
lower delay of a digital audio processing without reducing<br>
the audio quality at all, or somehow significantly. In<br>
other words, an embodiment of an analysis filterbank offers<br>
the opportunity of implementing an enhanced low delay cod-<br>
ing mode, for instance in the framework of an (audio) codec<br>
(codec = coder/decoder or coding/decoding), offering a<br>
lower delay, having at least a comparable frequency re-<br>
sponse and an enhanced pre-echo behavior compared to many<br>
codex available. Moreover, as will be explained in the con-<br>
text of the embodiments of a conferencing system in more<br>
detail, only a single window function for all kinds of sig-<br>
nals is capable of achieving the aforementioned benefits in<br>
some embodiments of an analysis filterbank and embodiments<br>
of systems comprising an embodiment of an analysis filter-<br>
bank 100.<br>
To emphasize, the input frames of embodiments of an analy-<br>
sis filterbank 100 are not required to comprise the four<br>
subsections 150-1 to 150-4 as illustrated in Fig. 2. This<br>
only represents one possibility that has been chosen for<br>
the sake of simplicity. Accordingly, also the windower is<br>
not required to be adapted such that the windowed frames<br>
also comprise four corresponding subsections or the<br>
time/frequency converter 120 to be adapted such that it is<br>
capable of providing the output frame based on a windowed<br>
frame comprising four subsections. This has simply been<br>
chosen in the context of Fig. 2 to be capable of explaining<br>
some embodiments of an analysis filterbank 100 in a concise<br>
and clear manner. However, statements in the context of the<br>
input frame in terms of the length of the input frames 130<br>
can also be transferred to the length of the windowed<br>
frames as explained in the context of the different options<br>
concerning the initial section 160 and its presence in the<br>
input frames 130.<br>
 <br>
In the following, a possible implementation of an embodi-<br>
ment of an analysis filterbank in view of an error resil-<br>
ient advanced audio codec low delay implementation (ER AAC<br>
LD) will be explained with respect to modifications in or-<br>
der to adapt the analysis filterbank of the ER AAC LD to<br>
arrive at an embodiment of an analysis filterbank 100 which<br>
is also sometimes referred to as a low-delay (analysis fil-<br>
terbank). In other words, in order to achieve a suffi-<br>
ciently reduced or low delay, some modifications to a stan-<br>
dard encoder in the case of an ER AAC LD might be useful,<br>
as defined in the following.<br>
In this case, the windower 110 of an embodiment of an<br>
analysis filterbank 100 is configured to generating the<br>
windowed samples zin based on the equation or expression<br>
 <br>
wherein i is an integer indicating a frame index or a block<br>
index of a windowed frame and/or of an input frame, and<br>
wherein n is the integer indicating a sample index in the<br>
range between -N and N-1.<br>
In other words, in embodiments comprising an initial se-<br>
quence 160 in the framework of the output frames 130, the<br>
windowing is extended to the pass by implementing the ex-<br>
pression or equation above for the sample indices n = -N,...,<br>
N-1, wherein w(n) is a window coefficient corresponding to<br>
a window function as will be explained in more detail in<br>
the context of Figs. 5 to 11. In the context of an embodi-<br>
ment of the analysis filterbank 100, the synthesis window<br>
function w is used as the analysis window function by in-<br>
verting the order, as can be seen by comparing the argument<br>
of the window function w(n-1-n). The window function for an<br>
embodiment of a synthesis filterbank, as outlined in the<br>
context of Figs. 3 and 4, may be constructed or generated<br>
based on the analysis window function by mirroring (e.g.<br>
with respect to the midpoint of the definition set) to ob-<br>
 <br>
tain a mirrored version. In other words, Fig. 5 shows a<br>
plot of the low-delay window functions, wherein the analy-<br>
sis window is simply a time-reverse replica of the synthe-<br>
sis window. In this context, it should also be noted that<br>
x'i,n represents an input sample or input value correspond-<br>
ing to the block index i and the sample index n.<br>
In other words, compared to the aforementioned ER AAC LD<br>
implementation (e.g. in the form of a codec), which is<br>
based on a window length N of 1024 or 960 values based on<br>
the sine window, the window length of the low-delay window<br>
comprised in the window 110 of the embodiment of the analy-<br>
sis filterbank 100 is 2N{=4M), by extending the windowing<br>
into the past.<br>
As will be explained in more detail in the context of Figs.<br>
5 to 11, the window coefficients w(n) for n=0,...,2N-1 may<br>
obey the relations given in table 1 in the annex and table<br>
3 in the annex for N=960 and N=1024 in some embodiments,<br>
respectively. Moreover, the window coefficients may com-<br>
prise the values given in the tables 2 and 4 in the annex<br>
for N=960 and N=1024 in the case of some embodiments, re-<br>
spectively.<br>
In terms of the time/frequency converter 120, the core MDCT<br>
algorithm (MDCT = Modified Discrete Cosine Transform) as<br>
implemented in the framework of the ER AAC LD codec is<br>
mostly unchanged, but comprises the longer window as ex-<br>
plained, such that n is now running from -N to N-1 instead<br>
of running from zero to N-. The spectral coefficients or<br>
output values of the output frame Xi,k are generated based<br>
on the following equation or expression<br>
 <br>
 <br>
wherein zi,n is a windowed sample of a windowed frame or a<br>
windowed input sequence of a time/frequency converter 120<br>
corresponding to the sample index n and the block index i<br>
as previously explained. Moreover, k is an integer indicat-<br>
ing the spectral coefficient index and N is an integer in-<br>
dicating twice the number of output values of an output<br>
frame, or as previously explained, the window length of one<br>
transform window based on the windows_sequence value as im-<br>
plemented in the ER AAC LD codec. The integer no is an off-<br>
set value and given by<br>
 <br>
Depending on the concrete length of an input frame 130 as<br>
explained in the context of Fig. 2, the time/frequency con-<br>
verter may be implemented based on a windowed frame com-<br>
prising windowed samples corresponding to the initial sec-<br>
tion 160 of the input frames 130. In other words, in the<br>
case of M=480 or N=960, the equations above are based on<br>
windowed frames comprising a length of 1920 windowed sam-<br>
ples. In the case of an embodiment of an analysis filter-<br>
bank 100 in which the windowed frames do not comprise win-<br>
dowed samples corresponding to the initial section 160 of<br>
the input frames, 130, the windowed frames comprise the<br>
length of 1800 windowed samples in the aforementioned case<br>
of M=480. In this case the equations given above can be<br>
adapted such that the corresponding equations are carried<br>
out. In the case of the windower 110, this can for instance<br>
lead to the sample index n running from the -N,..., 7N/8-1 in<br>
the case of M/4 = N/8 windowed samples missing in the first<br>
subsection, compared to the other subsections of the win-<br>
dowed frame as previously explained.<br>
Accordingly, in the case of a time/frequency converter 120,<br>
the equation given above can easily be adapted by modifying<br>
the summation indices accordingly to not incorporate the<br>
 <br>
windowed samples of the initial section or starting section<br>
of the windowed frame. Of course, further modifications can<br>
easily be obtained accordingly in the case of a different<br>
length of the initial section 160 of the input frames 130<br>
or in the case of the difference between the length of the<br>
first subsection and the other subsections of the windowed<br>
frame, as also previously explained.<br>
In other words, depending on the concrete implementation of<br>
an embodiment of an analysis filterbank 100, not all calcu-<br>
lations as indicated by the expressions and equations above<br>
are required to be carried out. Further embodiments of an<br>
analysis filterbank may also comprise an implementation in<br>
which the number of calculations can be even more reduced,<br>
in principle, leading to a higher computational efficiency.<br>
An example in the case of the synthesis filterbank will be<br>
described in the context of Fig. 19.<br>
In particular, as will also be explained in the context of<br>
an embodiment of a synthesis filterbank, an embodiment of<br>
an analysis filterbank 100 can be implemented in the frame-<br>
work of a socalled error resilient advanced audio codec en-<br>
hanced low-delay (ER AAC ELD) which is derived from the<br>
aforementioned ER AAC LD codec. As described, the analysis<br>
filterbank of the ER AAC LD codec is modified to arrive at<br>
an embodiment of an analysis filterbank 100 in order to<br>
adopt the low-delay filterbank as an embodiment of an<br>
analysis filterbank 100. As will be explained in more de-<br>
tail, the ER AAC ELD codec comprising an embodiment of an<br>
analysis filterbank 100 and/or an embodiment of a synthesis<br>
filterbank, which will be explained in more detail later<br>
on, provides the ability to extend the usage of generic low<br>
bitrate audio coding to applications requiring a very low<br>
delay of the encoding/decoding chain. Examples come for in-<br>
stance from the field of full-duplex real-time communica-<br>
tions, in which different embodiments can be incorporated,<br>
such as embodiments of an analysis filterbank, a synthesis<br>
 <br>
filterbank, a decoder, and encoder, a mixer and a confer-<br>
encing system.<br>
Before describing further embodiments of the present inven-<br>
tion in more detail, it should be noted that objects,<br>
structures and components with the same or similar func-<br>
tional property are denoted with the same reference signs.<br>
Unless explicitly noted otherwise, the description with re-<br>
spect to objects, structures and components with similar or<br>
equal functional properties and features can be exchanged<br>
with respect to each other. Furthermore, in the following<br>
summarizing reference signs for objects, structures or com-<br>
ponents which are identical or similar in one embodiment or<br>
in a structure shown in one of the figures, will be used,<br>
unless properties or features of a specific object, struc-<br>
ture or component are discussed. As an example, in the con-<br>
text of the input frames 130 summarizing reference signs<br>
have already been incorporated. In the description relating<br>
to the input frames in Fig. 2, if a specific input frame<br>
was referred to, the specific reference sign of that input<br>
frame, e.g. 130-k was used, whereas in the case of all in-<br>
put frames or one input frame, which is not specifically<br>
distinguished from the others is referred to, the summariz-<br>
ing reference signs 130 has been used. Using summarizing<br>
reference signs thereby enable a more compact and clearer<br>
description of embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Moreover, in this context it should be noted that in the<br>
framework of the present application, a first component<br>
which is coupled to a second component can be directly con-<br>
nected or connected via a further circuitry or further com-<br>
ponent to the second component. In other words, in the<br>
framework of the present application, two components being<br>
close to each other comprise the two alternatives of the<br>
components being directly connected to each other or via a<br>
further circuitry of a further component.<br>
 <br>
Fig. 3 shows an embodiment of a synthesis filterbank 200<br>
for filtering a plurality of input frames, wherein each in-<br>
put frame comprises a number of ordered input values. The<br>
embodiment of the synthesis filterbank 200 comprises a fre-<br>
quency/time converter 210, a windower 220 and an over-<br>
lap/adder 230 coupled in series.<br>
A plurality of input frames provided to the embodiment of<br>
the synthesis filter bank 200 will be processed first by<br>
the frequency/time converter 210. It is capable of generat-<br>
ing a plurality of output frames based on the input frames<br>
so that each output frame is a time representation of the<br>
corresponding input frame. In other words, the fre-<br>
quency/time converter 210 performs a transition for each<br>
input frame from the frequency-domain to the time-domain.<br>
The windower 220, which is coupled to the frequency/time<br>
converter 210, is then capable of processing each output<br>
frame as provided by the frequency/time converter 210 to<br>
generate a windowed frame based on this output frame. In<br>
some embodiments of a synthesis filterbank 200, the win-<br>
dower 220 is capable of generating the windowed frames by<br>
processing each of the output samples of each of the output<br>
frames, wherein each windowed frame comprises a plurality<br>
of windowed samples.<br>
Depending on the concrete implementation of an embodiment<br>
of a synthesis filterbank 200, the windower 220 is capable<br>
of generating the windowed frames based on the output<br>
frames by weighing the output samples based on a weighing<br>
function. As previously explained in the context of the<br>
windower 110 in Fig. 1, the weighing function may, for in-<br>
stance, be based on a psycho-acoustic model incorporating<br>
the hearing capabilities or properties of the human ear,<br>
such as the logarithmic dependency of the loudness of an<br>
audio signal.<br>
 <br>
Additionally or alternatively, the windower 220 may also<br>
generate the windowed frame based on the output frame by<br>
multiplying each output sample of an output frame with a<br>
sample-specific value of a window, windowing function or<br>
window function. These values are also referred to as win-<br>
dow coefficients or windowing coefficients. In other words,<br>
the windower 220 may be adapted in at least some embodi-<br>
ments of a synthesis filterbank 200 to generate the win-<br>
dowed samples of a windowed frame by multiplying these with<br>
a window function attributing a real-valued window coeffi-<br>
cient to each of a set of elements of a definition set.<br>
Examples of such window functions will be discussed in more<br>
detail in the context of Figs. 5 to 11. Moreover, it should<br>
be noted that these window function may be asymmetric or<br>
non-symmetric with respect to a midpoint of the definition<br>
set, which in turn is not required to be an element of the<br>
definition set itself.<br>
Moreover, the windower 220 generates the plurality of win-<br>
dowed samples for a further processing in an overlapping<br>
manner based on a sample advance value by the overlap/adder<br>
230, as will be explained in more detail in the context of<br>
Fig. 4. In other words, each of the windowed frames com-<br>
prises more than twice the number of windowed samples com-<br>
pared to a number of added samples as provided by the over-<br>
lap/adder 230 coupled to an output of the windower 220. As<br>
a consequence, the overlap/adder is than capable of gener-<br>
ating an added frame in an overlapping manner by adding up<br>
at least three windowed samples from at least three differ-<br>
ent windowed frames for at least some of the added samples<br>
in embodiments of a synthesis filterbank 200.<br>
The overlap/adder 230 coupled to the windower 220 is then<br>
capable of generating or providing an added frame for each<br>
newly received windowed frame. However, as previously men-<br>
tioned, the overlap/adder 230 operates the windowed frames<br>
in an overlapping manner to generate a single added frame.<br>
 <br>
Each added frame comprises a start section and a remainder<br>
section, as will be explained in more detail in the context<br>
of Fig. 4,and comprises furthermore a plurality of added<br>
samples by adding at least three windowed samples from at<br>
least three different windowed frames for an added in the<br>
remainder section of an added frame and by adding at least<br>
two windowed samples from at least two different windowed<br>
frames for an added samples in the starting section. De-<br>
pending on the implementation, the number of windowed sam-<br>
ples added to obtain an added sample in the remainder sec-<br>
tion may be at least one sample higher compared to the num-<br>
ber of windowed samples added to obtain an added sample in<br>
the start section.<br>
Alternatively or additionally and depending on the concrete<br>
implementation of an embodiment of a synthesis filterbank<br>
200, the windower 220 may also be configured to disregard-<br>
ing the earliest output value according to the order of the<br>
ordered output samples, to setting the corresponding win-<br>
dowed samples to a predetermined value or to at least a<br>
value in the predetermined range for each windowed frame of<br>
the plurality of windowed frames. Moreover, the over-<br>
lap/adder 230 may in this case be capable of providing the<br>
added sample in the remainder section of an added frame,<br>
based on at least three windowed samples from at least<br>
three different windowed frames and an added sample in the<br>
starting section based on at least two windowed samples<br>
from at least two different windowed frames, as will be ex-<br>
plained in the context of Fig. 4.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a schematic representation of five output<br>
frames 240 corresponding to the frame indices k, k-1, k-2,<br>
k-3 and k+1, which are labeled accordingly. Similar to the<br>
schematic representation shown in Fig. 2, the five output<br>
frames 240 shown in Fig. 4 are arranged according to their<br>
order with respect to time as indicated by an arrow 250.<br>
With reference to the output frame 240-k, the output frames<br>
240-(k-1), 240-(k-2) and 240-(k-3) refer to past output<br>
 <br>
frames 240. Accordingly, the output frame 240- (k+1) is with<br>
respect to the output frame 240-k a following or future<br>
output frame.<br>
As already discussed in the context of the input frames 130<br>
in Fig. 2, also the output frames 240 shown in Fig. 4 com-<br>
prise, in the case of the embodiment shown in Fig. 4, four<br>
subsets 260-1, 260-2, 260-3 and 260-4 each. Depending on<br>
the concrete implementation of the embodiment of a synthe-<br>
sis filterbank 200, the first subsection 260-1 of each of<br>
the output frames 240, may or may not, comprise an initial<br>
section 270, as was already discussed in the framework of<br>
Fig. 2 in the context of the initial section 160 of the in-<br>
put frames 130. As a consequence, the first subsection 260-<br>
1 may be shorter compared to the other subsections 260-2,<br>
260-3 and 260-4 in the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 4.<br>
The other subsections 260-2, 260-3 and 260-4, however, com-<br>
prise each a number of output samples equal to the afore-<br>
mentioned sample advance value M.<br>
As described in the context of Fig. 3, the frequency/time<br>
converter 210 is in the embodiment shown in Fig. 3 provided<br>
with a plurality of input frames on the basis of which the<br>
frequency/time converter 210 generates a plurality of out-<br>
put frames. In some embodiments of a synthesis filterbank<br>
200, the length of each of each of the input frames is<br>
identical to the sample advance value M, wherein M is once<br>
again a positive integer. The output frames generated by<br>
the frequency/time converter 210 however do comprise at<br>
least more than twice the number of input values of an in-<br>
put frame. To be more precise, in an embodiment in accor-<br>
dance with the situation shown in Fig. 4, the output frames<br>
240 comprise even more than three times the number of out-<br>
put samples compared to the number of input values, each of<br>
which also comprises in embodiments related to the shown<br>
situation M input values. As a consequence, the output<br>
frames can be divided into subsections 260, wherein each of<br>
the subsections 260 of the output frames 240 (optionally<br>
 <br>
without the first subsection 260-1, as discussed earlies)<br>
comprise M output samples. Moreover, the initial section<br>
270 may in some embodiments comprise M/4 samples. In other<br>
words, in the case of M = 480 or M = 512, the initial sec-<br>
tion 270, if present at all, may comprise 120 or 128 sam-<br>
ples or values.<br>
In yet other words, as explained in the context of the em-<br>
bodiments of the analysis filterbank 100 before, the sample<br>
advance value M is also identical to the lengths of the<br>
subsections 260-2, 260-3 and 260-4 of the output frames<br>
240. Depending on the concrete implementation of an embodi-<br>
ment of a synthesis filterbank 200, also the first subsec-<br>
tion 260-1 of the output frame 240 can comprise M output<br>
samples. If, however, the initial section 270 of the output<br>
frame 240 does not exist, the first subsection 260-1 of<br>
each of the output frames 240 is shorter than the remaining<br>
subsections 260-2 to 260-4 of the output frames 240.<br>
As previously mentioned, the frequency/time converter 210<br>
provides to the windower 220 a plurality of the output<br>
frames 240, wherein each of the output frames comprises a<br>
number of output samples being larger than twice the sample<br>
advance value M. The windower 220 is then capable of gener-<br>
ating windowed frames, based on the current output frame<br>
240, as provided by the frequency/time converter 210. More<br>
explicitly, each of the windowed frames corresponding to an<br>
output frame 240 is generated based on the weighing func-<br>
tion, as previously mentioned. In an embodiment based on<br>
the situation shown in Fig. 4, the weighing function is in<br>
turn based upon a window function 280, which is schemati-<br>
cally shown over each of the output frames 240. In this<br>
context, it should also be noted that the window function<br>
280 does not yield any contribution for output samples in<br>
the initial section 270 of the output frame 240, if pre-<br>
sent.<br>
 <br>
However, as a consequence, depending on the concrete imple-<br>
mentations of different embodiments of a synthesis filter-<br>
bank 200, different cases have to be considered once again.<br>
Depending on the frequency/time converter 210, the windower<br>
220 may be adapted or configured quite differently.<br>
If, for instance, on the one hand, the initial section 270<br>
of the output frames 240 is present such that also the<br>
first subsections 260-1 of the output frames 240 comprise M<br>
output samples, the windower 220 can be adapted such that<br>
it may or may not generate windowed frames based on the<br>
output frames comprising the same number of windowed sam-<br>
ples. In other words, the windower 220 can be implemented<br>
such that it generates windowed frames also comprising an<br>
initial section 270, which can be implemented, for in-<br>
stance, by setting the corresponding windowed samples to a<br>
predetermined value (e.g. 0, twice a maximum allowable sig-<br>
nal amplitude, etc.) or to at least one value in a prede-<br>
termined range, as previously discussed in the context of<br>
Figs. 1 and 2.<br>
In this case, both, the output frame 240 as well as the<br>
windowed frame based upon the output frame 240, may com-<br>
prise the same number of samples or values. However the<br>
windowed samples in the initial section 270 of the windowed<br>
frame do not necessarily depend on the corresponding output<br>
samples of the output frame 240. The first subsection 260-1<br>
of the windowed frame is, however, with respect to the sam-<br>
ples not in the initial section 270 based upon the output<br>
frame 240 as provided by the frequency/time converter 210.<br>
To summarize, if at least one output sample of the initial<br>
section 270 of an output frame 240 is present, the corre-<br>
sponding windowed sample may be set to a predetermined<br>
value, or to a value in a predetermined range, as was ex-<br>
plained in the context of the embodiment of an analysis<br>
filterbank illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2. In the case of the<br>
initial section 270 comprises more than one windowed sam-<br>
 <br>
ple, the same may also be true for this or these other win-<br>
dowed samples or values of the initial section 270.<br>
Moreover, the windower 220 may be adapted such that the<br>
windowed frames do not comprise an initial section 270 at<br>
all. In the case of such an embodiment of a synthesis fil-<br>
terbank 200, the windower 2.20 can be configured to disre-<br>
garding the output samples of the output frames 240 in the<br>
initial section 270 of the output frame 240.<br>
In any of these cases, depending on the concrete implemen-<br>
tation of such an embodiment, the first subsection 260-1 of<br>
a windowed frame may or may not comprise the initial sec-<br>
tion 270. If an initial section of the windowed frame ex-<br>
ists, the windowed samples or values of this section are<br>
not required to depend on the corresponding output samples<br>
of the respective output frame at all.<br>
On the other hand, if the output frame 240 does not com-<br>
prise the initial section 270, the windower 220 may also be<br>
configured to generating a windowed frame based on the out-<br>
put frame 240 comprising or not comprising an initial sec-<br>
tion 270 itself. If the number of output samples of the<br>
first subsection 260-1 is smaller than the sample advance<br>
value M, the windower 220 may in some embodiments of a syn-<br>
thesis filterbank 200 be capable of setting the windowed<br>
samples corresponding to the "missing output samples" of<br>
the initial section 270 of the windowed frame to the prede-<br>
termined value or to at least one value in the predeter-<br>
mined range. In other words, the windower 220 may in this<br>
case be capable of filling up the windowed frame with the<br>
predetermined value or at least one value in the predeter-<br>
mined range so that the resulting windowed frame comprises<br>
a number of windowed samples, which is an integer multiple<br>
of the sample advance value M, the size of an input frame<br>
or the length of an added frame.<br>
 <br>
However, as a further option, which might be implemented,<br>
both the output frames 240 and the windowed frames might<br>
not comprise an initial section 270 at all. In this case<br>
the windower 220 may be configured to simply weighing at<br>
least some of the output samples of the output frame to ob-<br>
tain the windowed frame. Additionally or alternatively, the<br>
windower 220 might employ a window function 280 or the<br>
like.<br>
As previously explained in the context of the embodiment of<br>
the analysis filterbank 100 shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the<br>
initial section 270 of the output frames 240 corresponds to<br>
the earliest samples in the output frame 250 in the sense<br>
that these values correspond to the "freshest" samples hav-<br>
ing the smallest sample index. In other words, considering<br>
all output samples of the output frame 240, these samples<br>
refer to samples corresponding to a smallest amount of time<br>
will have elapsed when playing back a corresponding added<br>
sample as provided by the overlap/adder 230 compared to the<br>
other output samples of the output frame 240. In other<br>
words, inside the output frame 240 and inside each of the<br>
subsections 260 of the output frame, the freshest output<br>
samples correspond to a position left in the respective<br>
output frame 240 or subsection 260. In yet other words, the<br>
time as indicated by the arrow 250 corresponds to the se-<br>
quence of output frames 240 and not to the sequence of out-<br>
put samples inside each of the output frames 240.<br>
However, before describing the processing of the windowed<br>
frames 240 by the overlap/adder 230 in more detail, it<br>
should be noted that in many embodiments of the synthesis<br>
filterbank 200, the frequency/time converter 210 and/or the<br>
windower 220 are adapted such that the initial section 270<br>
of the output frame 240 and the windowed frame are either<br>
completely present, or not present at all. In the first<br>
case, the number of output or windowed samples in the first<br>
subsection 260-1 is accordingly equal to the number of out-<br>
put samples in an output frame, which is equal to M. How-<br>
 <br>
ever, embodiments of a synthesis filterbank 200 can also be<br>
implemented, in which the either or both of the fre-<br>
quency/time converter 210 and the windower 220 may be con-<br>
figured such that the initial section 270 is present, but<br>
the number of samples in the first subsection 260-1 is yet<br>
smaller than the number of output samples in an output<br>
frame of a frequency/time converter 210. Moreover, it<br>
should be noted that in many embodiments all samples or<br>
values of any of the frames are treated as such, although<br>
of course only a single or a fraction of the corresponding<br>
values or samples may be utilized.<br>
The overlap/adder 230 coupled to the windower 220 is capa-<br>
ble of providing an added frame 290, as shown at the bottom<br>
of Fig. 4, which comprises a start section 300 and a re-<br>
mainder section 310. Depending on the concrete implementa-<br>
tion of an embodiment of a synthesis filterbank. 200, the<br>
overlap/adder 230 can be implemented such that an added<br>
sample as comprised in the added frame in the start section<br>
is obtained by adding at least two windowed samples of at<br>
least two different windowed frames. To be more precise, as<br>
the embodiments shown in Fig. 4 is based on four subsec-<br>
tions 260-1 to 260-4 in the case of each output frames 240<br>
and the corresponding windowed frames, an added sample in<br>
the start section 300 is based upon three or four windowed<br>
samples or values from at least three or four different<br>
windowed frames, respectively, as indicated by an arrow<br>
320. The question, whether three or four windowed samples<br>
will be used in the case of the embodiment used in Fig. 4<br>
depends on the concrete implementation of the embodiment in<br>
terms of the initial section 270 of the windowed frame<br>
based on the corresponding output frame 240-k.<br>
In the following, with reference to Fig. 4, one might think<br>
of the output frames 240 as shown in Fig. 4 as the windowed<br>
frames provided by the windower 220 based on the respective<br>
output frames 240, as the windowed frames are obtained in<br>
the situation illustrated in Fig. 4 by multiplying at least<br>
 <br>
the output samples of the output frames 240 outside the<br>
initial section 270 with values derived from the window<br>
function 280. Hence, in the following with respect to the<br>
overlap/adder 230, the reference sign 240 may also be used<br>
for a windowed frame.<br>
In the case of the windower 220 being adapted such that the<br>
windowed samples in an existing initial section 270 is set<br>
to a predetermined value or a value in the predetermined<br>
range, the windowed sample or windowed value in the initial<br>
section 270 may be utilized in adding up the remaining<br>
three added samples from the second subsection of the win-<br>
dowed frame 240-(k-1) (corresponding to the output frame<br>
240-(k-1)), the third subsection from the windowed frame<br>
240-(k-2) (corresponding to the output frame 240-(k-2)) and<br>
the fourth subsection of the windowed frame 240-(k-3) (cor-<br>
responding to the output frame 240-(k-3)), if the predeter-<br>
mined value or the predetermined range are such that sum-<br>
ming up the windowed sample from the initial section 270 of<br>
the windowed frame 240-k (corresponding to the output frame<br>
240-k) does not significantly disturb or alter the outcome.<br>
In the case that the windower 220 is adapted such that an<br>
initial section 270 does not exist in the case of a win-<br>
dowed frame, the corresponding added sample in the start<br>
section 300 is normally obtained by adding the at least two<br>
windowed samples from the at least two windowed frames.<br>
However, as the embodiment shown in Fig. 4 is based upon a<br>
windowed frame comprising four subsections 260 each, in<br>
this case, the added sample in the start section of the<br>
added frame 290 is obtained by adding up the aforementioned<br>
three windowed samples from the windowed frames 240-(k-1),<br>
240-(k-2) and 240-(k-3).<br>
This case can, for instance, be caused by the windower 220<br>
being adapted such that a corresponding output sample of an<br>
output frame is disregarded by the windower 220. Moreover,<br>
it should be noted that if the predetermined value or the<br>
 <br>
predetermined range comprises values, which would lead to a<br>
disturbance of the added sample, the overlap/adder 230 may<br>
be configured such that the corresponding windowed sample<br>
is not taken into consideration for adding up the respec-<br>
tive windowed sample to obtain the added sample. In this<br>
case, windowed samples in the initial section 270 may also<br>
be considered to be disregarded by the overlap/adder, as<br>
the corresponding windowed samples will not be used to ob-<br>
tain the added sample in the start section 300.<br>
In terms of an added sample in the remainder section 310,<br>
as indicated by arrow 330 in Fig. 4, the overlap/adder 230<br>
is adapted to adding up at least three windowed samples<br>
from at least three different windowed frames 240 (corre-<br>
sponding to three different output frames 240). Once again,<br>
due to the fact that a windowed frame 240 in the embodiment<br>
shown in Fig. 4 comprises four subsections 260, an added<br>
sample in the remainder section 310 will be generated by<br>
the overlap/adder 230 by adding up four windowed samples<br>
from four different windowed frames 240. To be more pre-<br>
cise, an added sample in the remainder section 310 of the<br>
added frame 290 is obtained by the overlap/adder 230 by<br>
adding up the corresponding windowed sample from the first<br>
section 260-1 of the windowed frame 240-k, from the second<br>
subsection 260-2 of the windowed frame 240-(k-1) of the<br>
third subsection 260-3 from the windowed frame 240-(k-2)<br>
and from the fourth subsection 260-4 from the windowed<br>
frame 240-(k-3).<br>
As a consequence of the described overlap/add procedure as<br>
described, the added frame 290 comprises M = N/2 added sam-<br>
ples. In other word, the sample advance value M is equal to<br>
the length of the added frame 290. Moreover, at least in<br>
terms of some embodiments of an synthesis filterbank 200,<br>
also the length of an input frame is, as mentioned before,<br>
equal to the sample advance value M.<br>
 <br>
The fact that in the embodiment shown in Fig. 4, at least<br>
three or four windowed samples are utilized to obtain an<br>
added sample in the start section 300 and the remainder<br>
section 310 of the added frame, respectively, is has been<br>
chosen for the sake of simplicity only. In the embodiment<br>
shown in Fig. 4, each of the output/windowed frames 240<br>
comprises four starting sections 260-1 to 260-4. However,<br>
in principle, an embodiment of the synthesis filterbank can<br>
easily be implemented in which an output or windowed frame<br>
only comprises one windowed sample more than twice the num-<br>
ber of added samples of an added frame 290. In other words,<br>
an embodiment of a synthesis filterbank 200 can be adapted<br>
such that each windowed frame only comprises 2M+1 windowed<br>
samples.<br>
As explained in the context of an embodiment of an analysis<br>
filterbank 100, an embodiment of a synthesis filterbank 200<br>
can also be incorporated in the framework of an ER AAC ELD<br>
codec (codec = coder / decoder) by a modification of an ER<br>
AAC LD codec. Therefore, an embodiment of a synthesis fil-<br>
ter 200 may be used in the context of an AAC LD codec in<br>
order to define a low bitrate and low delay audio cod-<br>
ing/decoding system. For instance, an embodiment of a syn-<br>
thesis filterbank may be comprised in a decoder for the ER<br>
AAC ELD codec along with an optional SBR tool (SBR = Spec-<br>
tral Bank Replication). However, in order to achieve a suf-<br>
ficiently low delay, some modifications might be advisable<br>
to implement compared to an ER AAC LD codec to arrive at an<br>
implementation of an embodiment of a synthesis filterbank<br>
200.<br>
The synthesis filterbank of the aforementioned codecs can<br>
be modified in order to adapt an embodiment of a low (syn-<br>
thesis) filterbank, wherein the core IMDCT algorithm (IMDCT<br>
= Inverse Modified Discrete Cosine Transform) may remain<br>
mostly unchanged in terms of the frequency/time converter<br>
210. However, compared to an IMDCT frequency/time con-<br>
verter, the frequency/time converter 210 can be implemented<br>
 <br>
with a longer window function, such that the sample index n<br>
is now running up to 2N-1, rather than up to N-1.<br>
To be more precise, the frequency/time converter 210 can be<br>
implemented such that it is configured to provide output<br>
values Xi,n based on an expression<br>
  r<br>
wherein n is, as previously mentioned, an integer indicat-<br>
ing a sample index, i is an integer indicating a window in-<br>
dex, k is a spectral coefficient index, N is a window<br>
length based on the parameter windows_sequence of an ER AAC<br>
LD codec-implementation such that the integer N is twice<br>
the number of added samples of an added frame 2 90. More-<br>
over, n0 is an offset value given by<br>
 <br>
wherein spec[i][k] is an input, value corresponding to the<br>
spectral coefficient index k and the window index I of the<br>
input frame. In some embodiments of a synthesis filterbank<br>
200, the parameter N is equal to 960 or 1024. However, in<br>
principle, the parameter N can also acquire any value. In<br>
other words, further embodiments of a synthesis filterbank<br>
200 may operate based on a parameter N=360 or other values.<br>
The windower 220 and the overlap/adder 230 may also be<br>
modified compared to the windowing and overlap/adds imple-<br>
mented in the framework of an ER AAC LD codec To be more<br>
precise, compared to the aforementioned codec, the length N<br>
of a window function is replaced by a length 2N window<br>
function with more overlap in the past and less overlap in<br>
the future. As will be explained in the context of the fol-<br>
lowing Figs. 5 to 11, in embodiments of a synthesis filter-<br>
 <br>
bank 200, window functions comprising M/4 = N/8 values or<br>
window coefficients may actually be set to zero. As a con-<br>
sequence, these window coefficients correspond to the ini-<br>
tial sections 160, 270 of the respective frames. As previ-<br>
ously explained, this section is not required to be imple-<br>
mented at all. As a possible alternative, the corresponding<br>
modules (e.g. the windowers 110, 220) may be constructed<br>
such that multiplying with a value zero is not required. As<br>
explained earlier, the windowed samples may be set to zero<br>
or disregarded, to mention only two possible implementa-<br>
tion-related differences of embodiments.<br>
Accordingly, the windowing performed by the windower 220 in<br>
the case of such an embodiment of a synthesis filterbank<br>
comprising such a low delay window function can be imple-<br>
mented according to<br>
 <br>
wherein the window function with window coefficients w(n)<br>
now has a length of 2N window coefficients. Hence, the sam-<br>
ple index runs from N = 0 to N = 2N-2, wherein relations as<br>
well as values of the window coefficients of different win-<br>
dow functions are comprised in the tables 1 to 4 in the an-<br>
nex for different embodiments of a synthesis filterbank.<br>
Moreover, the overlap/adder 230 can furthermore be imple-<br>
mented according to or based on the expression or equation<br>
 <br>
wherein the expressions and the equations given before<br>
might be slightly altered depending on the concrete imple-<br>
mentation of an embodiment of a synthesis filterbank 200.<br>
In other words, depending on the concrete implementation,<br>
especially in view of the fact that a windowed frame does<br>
 <br>
not necessarily comprise an initial section, the equations<br>
and expressions given above might, for instance, be altered<br>
in terms of the borders of the summing indices to exclude<br>
windowed samples of the initial section in the case an ini-<br>
tial section is not present or comprises trivial windowed<br>
samples (e.g. zero-valued samples). In other words, by im-<br>
plementing at least one of an embodiment of an analysis<br>
filterbank 100 or of a synthesis filterbank 200, an ER AAC<br>
LD codec optionally with an appropriate SBR tool can be im-<br>
plemented to obtain an ER AAC ELD codec, which can, for in-<br>
stance, be used to achieve a low bitrate and/or low delay<br>
audio coding and decoding system. An overview of an end<br>
coder and a decoder will be given in the framework of Figs.<br>
12 and 13, respectively.<br>
As already indicated several times, both embodiments of an<br>
analysis filterbank 100 and of a synthesis filterbank 200<br>
may offer the advantage of enabling an enhanced low delay<br>
coding mode by implementing a low delay window function in<br>
the framework of an analysis/synthesis filterbank 100, 200<br>
as well as in the framework of embodiments of an encoder<br>
and decoder. By implementing an embodiment of an analysis<br>
filterbank or a synthesis filterbank, which may comprise<br>
one of the window functions, which will be described in<br>
more detail in the context of Figs. 5 to 11, several advan-<br>
tages may be achieved depending on the concrete implementa-<br>
tion of an embodiment of a filterbank comprising a low de-<br>
lay window function. Referring to the context of Fig. 2, an<br>
implementation of an embodiment of a filterbank may be ca-<br>
pable of producing the delay compared to the codec based on<br>
orthogonal windows, which are used in all state-off-the-art<br>
codex. For instance, in the case of the system based on the<br>
parameter N=960, the delay reduction from 960 samples,<br>
which equals a delay of 20 ms at a sampling frequency of 48<br>
kHz, to 700 samples can be realized, which is equal to a<br>
delay of 15 ms at the same sampling frequency. Moreover, as<br>
will be shown, the frequency response of an embodiment of a<br>
synthesis filterbank and/or of an analysis filterbank is<br>
 <br>
very similar to the filterbank using a sign window. In com-<br>
parison to a filterbank employing the socalled low overlap<br>
window, the frequency response is even much better. Fur-<br>
thermore, the pre-echo behavior is similar to the low-<br>
overlap window, so that an embodiment of a synthesis fil-<br>
terbank and/or of an analysis filterbank can represent an<br>
excellent trade-off between quality and low delay depending<br>
on the concrete implementation of an embodiment of the fil-<br>
terbanks. As a further advantage, which may, for instance,<br>
be employed in the framework of an embodiment of a confer-<br>
encing system, is that only one window function can be used<br>
to process all kinds of signals.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a graphical representation of a possible win-<br>
dow function, which can, for instance, be employed in the<br>
framework of a windower 110, 220 in the case of an embodi-<br>
ment of an analysis filterbank 100 and in the case of a<br>
synthesis filterbank 200. To be more precise, the window<br>
functions shown in Fig. 5 correspond to an analysis window<br>
function for M=480 bands or a number of output samples in<br>
the case of an embodiment of an analysis filterbank in the<br>
upper graph. The lower graph of Fig. 5 shows the corre-<br>
sponding synthesis window function for an embodiment of a<br>
synthesis filterbank. As both window functions shown in<br>
Fig. 5 correspond to M=480 bands or samples of an output<br>
frame (analysis filterbank) and an added frame (synthesis<br>
filterbank), the window functions shown in Fig. 5 comprise<br>
the definition set of 1920 values each with indices n=0, ...<br>
1919.<br>
Moreover, as the two graphs in Fig. 5 clearly show, with<br>
respect to a midpoint of the definition set, which is in<br>
the case here not part of the definition set itself, as the<br>
midpoint lies between the indices N=959 and N=960, both<br>
window functions comprise a significant higher number of<br>
window coefficients in one half of the definition set with<br>
respect to the aforementioned midpoint having absolute val-<br>
ues of the window coefficients, which are larger than 10%,<br>
 <br>
20%, 30% or 50% of the maximum absolute value of all window<br>
coefficients. In the case of the analysis window function<br>
in the upper graph of Fig. 5, the respective half of the<br>
definition set is the definition set comprising the indices<br>
N=960,... 1919, whereas in the case of the synthesis window<br>
function in the lower graph of Fig. 5, the respective half<br>
of the definition set with respect to the midpoint com-<br>
prises the indices N=0, ..., 959. As a consequence, with re-<br>
spect to the midpoint, both the analysis window function<br>
and the synthesis window function are strongly asymmetric.<br>
As already shown in the context of both the windower 110 of<br>
an embodiment of the analysis filterbank as well as in the<br>
case of the windower 220 of the embodiment of the synthesis<br>
filterbank, the analysis window function and the synthesis<br>
window function are in terms of the indices an inverse of<br>
each other.<br>
An important aspect with respect to the window function<br>
shown in the two graphs in Fig. 5 is that in the case of<br>
the analysis window shown in the upper graph, the last 120<br>
windowing coefficients and in the case of the synthesis<br>
window function in the bottom graph in Fig. 5, the first<br>
120 window coefficients are set to zero or comprise an ab-<br>
solute value so that they can be considered to be equal to<br>
0 within a reasonable accuracy. In other words, the afore-<br>
mentioned 120 windowing coefficients of the two window<br>
functions can therefore be considered to cause an appropri-<br>
ate number of samples to be set to at least one value in a<br>
predetermined range by multiplying the 120 window coeffi-<br>
cients with the respective samples. In other words, depend-<br>
ing on the concrete implementation of embodiments of an<br>
analysis filterbank 100 or a synthesis filterbank 200, the<br>
120 zero-valued windowed coefficients will result in creat-<br>
ing the initial section 160, 270 of the windowed frames in<br>
embodiments of an analysis filterbank and a synthesis fil-<br>
terbank, if applicable, as previously explained. However,<br>
even if the initial sections 160, 270 are not present, the<br>
 <br>
120 zero-valued window coefficients can be interpreted by<br>
the windower 110 by the time/frequency converter 120, by<br>
the windower 220 and by the overlap/adder 230 in embodi-<br>
ments of an analysis filterbank 100 and a synthesis filter-<br>
bank 200 to treat or process the different frames accord-<br>
ingly, even in the case that the initial sections 160, 270<br>
of the appropriate frames are not present at all.<br>
By implementing an analysis window function or a synthesis<br>
window function as shown in Fig. 5 comprising 120 zero-<br>
valued windowing coefficients in the case of M=480 (N=960),<br>
appropriate embodiments of an analysis filterbank 100 and a<br>
synthesis filterbank 200 will be established in which the<br>
initial sections 160, 270 of the corresponding frames com-<br>
prise M/4 samples or the corresponding first subsections<br>
150-1, 260-1 comprise M/4 values or samples less than the<br>
other subsections, to put it in more general terms.<br>
As previously mentioned, the analysis window function shown<br>
in the upper graph of Fig. 5 and the synthesis window func-<br>
tion shown in the lower graph of Fig. 5 represents low-<br>
delay window functions for both an analysis filterbank and<br>
a synthesis filterbank. Moreover, both the analysis window<br>
function and the synthesis window function as shown in Fig.<br>
5 are mirrored versions of each other with respect to the<br>
aforementioned midpoint of the definition set of which both<br>
window functions are defined.<br>
It should be noted that the usage of the low-delay window<br>
and/or employing an embodiment of an analysis filterbank or<br>
a synthesis filterbank in many cases do not result in any<br>
noticeable increase in computational complexity and only a<br>
marginal increase in storage requirements, as will be out-<br>
lined later on during the complexity analysis.<br>
The window functions shown in Fig. 5 comprise the values<br>
given in table 2 in the annex, which have been put there<br>
for the sake of simplicity only. However, by far, it is not<br>
 <br>
necessary for an embodiment of an analysis filterbank or a<br>
synthesis filterbank operating on a parameter M=480 to com-<br>
prise the exact values given in table 2 in the annex. Natu-<br>
rally, the concrete implementation of an embodiment of an<br>
analysis filterbank or a synthesis filterbank can easily<br>
employ varying window coefficients in the framework of ap-<br>
propriate window functions, so that, in many cases, employ-<br>
ing window coefficients will suffice, which employ, in the<br>
case of M=480, the relations given in table 1 in the annex.<br>
Moreover, in many embodiments having filter coefficients,<br>
window coefficients as well as lifting coefficients, which<br>
will be subsequently introduced, the Figs, given are not<br>
required to be implemented as precisely as given. In other<br>
words, in other embodiments of an analysis filterbank as<br>
well as a synthesis filterbank and related embodiments of<br>
the present invention, also other window functions may be<br>
implemented, which are filter coefficients, window coeffi-<br>
cients and other coefficients, such as lifting coeffi-<br>
cients, which are different from the coefficients given be-<br>
low in the annex, as long as the variations are within the<br>
third digit following the comma or in higher digits, such<br>
as the fourth, fifth, etc. digits.<br>
Considering the synthesis window function in the bottom<br>
graph of Fig. 5, as previously mentioned, the first M/4=120<br>
window coefficients are set to zero. Afterwards, approxi-<br>
mately until index 350, the window function comprises a<br>
steep rise, which is followed by more moderate rise up to<br>
an index of approximately 600. In this context, it should<br>
be noted that around an index of 480 (=M), the window func-<br>
tion becomes larger than unity or larger than one. Follow-<br>
ing index 600 until approximately sample 1100, the window<br>
function falls back from its maximum value to a level of<br>
less than 0.1. Over the rest of the definition set, the<br>
window function comprises slight oscillations around the<br>
value 0.<br>
 <br>
Fig. 6 shows a comparison of the window function as shown<br>
in Fig. 5 in the case of an analysis window function in the<br>
upper graph of Fig. 6, and in the case of a synthesis win-<br>
dow function in the lower graph of Fig. 6. Moreover, as a<br>
dotted line, two graphs also comprise the socalled sine<br>
window function, which is for instance, employed in the<br>
aforementioned ER AAC codecs AAC LC and AAC LD. The direct<br>
comparison of the sine window and the low-delay window<br>
function as shown in the two graphs of Fig. 6 illustrate<br>
the different time objects of the time window as explained<br>
in the context of Fig. 5. Apart from the fact that the sine<br>
window is only defined over 960 samples, the most striking<br>
difference between the two window functions shown in the<br>
case of an embodiment of an analysis filterbank (upper<br>
graph) and in the case of a synthesis filterbank (lower<br>
graph) is that the sine window frame function is symmetric<br>
about its respective midpoint of the shortened definition<br>
set and comprises in the first 120 elements of the defini-<br>
tion set (mostly) window coefficients being larger than<br>
zero. In contrast, as previously explained, the low-delay<br>
window comprises 120 (ideally) zero-valued windowed coeffi-<br>
cients and is significantly asymmetric with respect its re-<br>
spective midpoint of the prolonged definition set compared<br>
to the definition set of the sine window.<br>
There is a further difference, which distinguishes the low-<br>
delay window from the sine window, while both windows ap-<br>
proximately acquire a value of approximately 1 and a sample<br>
index of 480 (=M), the low-delay window function reaches a<br>
maximum of more than one approximately 120 samples after<br>
becoming larger than 1 and a sample index of approximately<br>
600 (= M + M/4; M = 480), while the symmetric sine window<br>
decreases symmetrically down to 0. In other words, the sam-<br>
ples which will be treated, for instance by multiplying<br>
with zero in a first frame will be multiplied in the fol-<br>
lowing frame with values greater than 1 due to the overlap-<br>
ping mode of operation and the sample advantage value of<br>
M=480 in these cases.<br>
 <br>
A further description of further low-delay windows will be<br>
given, which can for instance be employed in other embodi-<br>
ments of an analysis filterbank or a synthesis filterbank<br>
200, the concept of the delay reduction which is achievable<br>
with the window functions shown in Figs. 5 and 6 will be<br>
explained with reference to the parameter M=480, N=960 hav-<br>
ing M/4 = 120 zero-valued or sufficiently low values. In<br>
the analysis window shown in the upper graph of Fig. 6, the<br>
parts that access future input values (sample indices 1800<br>
to 1920) is reduced by 120 samples. Correspondingly, in the<br>
synthesis window in the lower graph of Fig. 6, the overlap<br>
with past output samples, which would require a correspond-<br>
ing delay in the case of a synthesis filterbank is reduced<br>
by another 120 samples. In other words, in the case of a<br>
synthesis window the overlap with the past output samples,<br>
which is needed to complete the overlap/add operation, or to<br>
finish the overlap/add along with the reduction of 120 sam-<br>
ples in the case of an analysis window will be resulting an<br>
overall delay reduction of 240 samples in the case of a<br>
system comprising both embodiments of an analysis filter-<br>
bank and a synthesis filterbank.<br>
The extended overlap, however, does not result in any addi-<br>
tional delay as it only involves adding values from the<br>
past, which can easily be stored without causing additional<br>
delay, at least on the scale of the sampling frequency. A<br>
comparison of the time of sets of the traditional sine win-<br>
dow and the low-delay window shown in Figs. 5 and 6 illus-<br>
trate this.<br>
Fig. 7 comprises in three graphs, three different window<br>
functions. To be more precise, the upper graph of Fig. 7<br>
shows the aforementioned sine window, whereas the middle<br>
graph shows the socalled low-overlap window and the bottom<br>
graph shows the low-delay window. However, the three win-<br>
dows shown in Fig. 7 correspond to a sample advance value<br>
or parameter M = 512 (N = 2M =1024). Once again, the sine<br>
 <br>
window as well as the low-overlap window in the two topmost<br>
graphs in Fig. 7 are defined only over limited or shortened<br>
definition sets comprising 1024 sample indices as compared<br>
to the low delay window function as shown in the bottom<br>
graph of Fig. 7, which is defined over 2048 sample indices.<br>
The plots of the window shapes of a sine window, the low-<br>
overlap window and the low-delay window in Fig. 7 comprise<br>
more of less the same characteristics as previously dis-<br>
cussed in terms of the sine window and the low delay win-<br>
dow. To be more precise, the sine window (top graph in Fig.<br>
7) is once again symmetric with regard to the appropriate<br>
midpoint of the definition set lying between indices 511<br>
and 512. The sine window acquires a maximum value at ap-<br>
proximately the value M = 512 and drops down from the maxi-<br>
mum value back to zero again at the border of the defini-<br>
tion set.<br>
In the case of the low-delay window shown in the bottom<br>
graph of Fig. 7, this low-delay window comprises 128 zero-<br>
valued window coefficients, which is once again a quarter<br>
of the sample advance value M. Moreover, the low-delay win-<br>
dow acquires a value of approximately 1 at a sample index<br>
M, while the maximum value of the window coefficients is<br>
acquired approximately 128 sample indices n after becoming<br>
larger than one in terms of an increasing index (around in-<br>
dex 640) . Also with respect to the other features of the<br>
plot of the window function, the window function for M =512<br>
in the bottom graph of Fig. 7 does not significantly differ<br>
from the low delay windows for M = 480 shown in Figs. 5 and<br>
6, apart from an optional shift due to the longer defini-<br>
tion sets (2048 indices compared to 1920 indices). The low-<br>
delay window shown in the bottom graph of Fig. 7 comprises<br>
the values given in table 4 in the annex.<br>
However, as previously explained, it is not necessary for<br>
embodiments of a synthesis filterbank or an analysis fil-<br>
terbank to implement the window function with the precise<br>
 <br>
values as given in table 4. In other words, window coeffi-<br>
cients may differ from the values given in table 4, as long<br>
as they hold the relations given in table 3 in the annex.<br>
Moreover, in embodiments of the present invention also<br>
variations with respect to the window coefficients can eas-<br>
ily be implemented, as long as the variations are within<br>
the third digit following the comma, or in higher digits<br>
such as the fourth, fifth, etc. digits, as previously ex-<br>
plained.<br>
In the middle graph of Fig. 7 the low-overlap window has<br>
not been described so far. As previously mentioned the low<br>
delay window also comprises a definition set comprising<br>
1024 elements. Moreover, the low-overlap window also com-<br>
prises at the beginning of a definition set and at the end<br>
of a definition set, a connected subset in which the low-<br>
overlap window vanishes. However, after this connected sub-<br>
set in which the low-overlap window vanishes, a steep rise<br>
or decay follows, which comprises only a little over 100<br>
sample indices each. Moreover, the symmetric low-overlap<br>
window does not comprise values larger than 1 and may com-<br>
prise a lesser stop-band attenuation compared to window<br>
functions as employed in some embodiments.<br>
In other words, the low-overlap window comprises a signifi-<br>
cant lower definition set while having the same sample ad-<br>
vance value, as the low delay window and does not acquire<br>
values larger than one. Moreover, both the sine window and<br>
the low-overlap window are with respect to their respective<br>
midpoints of the definition sets orthogonal or symmetric,<br>
while the low-delay window is asymmetric in the described<br>
manner over the midpoint of its definition set.<br>
The low overlap window was introduced in order to eliminate<br>
pre-echo artifacts for transients. The lower overlap avoids<br>
spreading of the quantization noise before the signal at-<br>
tack, as illustrated in Fig. 8. The new low-delay window,<br>
however, has the same property, but offers a better fre-<br>
 <br>
quency response, as will be apparent by comparing the fre-<br>
quency responses shown in Figs. 10 and 11. Therefore, the<br>
low delay window is capable of replacing both traditional<br>
AAC LD windows, i.e. the sign window at the low-overlap<br>
window, so that a dynamic window shape adaptation is not<br>
required to be implemented anymore.<br>
Fig. 8 shows for the same window functions shown in Fig. 7<br>
in the same order of graphs an example of quantization<br>
noise spreading for the different window shapes of the sine<br>
window or the low-overlap window and the low-delay window.<br>
The pre-echo behavior of the low-delay window as shown in<br>
the bottom graph of Fig. 8 is similar to the low overlap<br>
window behavior as shown in the middle graph of Fig. 8,<br>
while the pre-echo behavior of the sine window in the top<br>
graph of Fig. 8 comprises significant contributions in the<br>
first 128 (M = 512) samples.<br>
In other words, employing a low-delay window in an embodi-<br>
ment of a synthesis filterbank or an analysis filterbank,<br>
may result in an advantage concerning an improved pre-echo<br>
behavior. In the case of an analysis window, the path that<br>
accesses future input values and, thus would require a de-<br>
lay, are reduced by more than a sample and preferably by<br>
120/128 samples in the case of a block length or sample ad-<br>
vance value of 4 80/512 samples, such that it reduces the<br>
delay in comparison to the MDCT (Modified Discrete Cosine<br>
Transform) . At the same time it improves the pre-echo be-<br>
haviors, since a possible attack in the signal, which might<br>
be in those 120/128 samples, would only appear one block or<br>
one frame later. Correspondingly, in the synthesis window<br>
the overlap with past output samples to finish their over-<br>
lap/add operation, which would also require a corresponding<br>
delay, is reduced by another 120/128 samples, resulting in<br>
an overall delay reduction of 240/256 samples. This also<br>
results in an improved pre-echo behavior since those<br>
120/128 samples would otherwise contribute to the noise<br>
spread into the past, before a possible attach. Altogether<br>
 <br>
this means, a pre-echo appears possibly one block or frame<br>
later, and the resulting pre-echo from the synthesis side<br>
alone is 120/128 samples shorter.<br>
Such a reduction, which might be achievable by employing<br>
such a low-delay window, as described in Figs. 5 to 7, de-<br>
pending on the concrete implementation of an embodiment of<br>
a synthesis filterbank or an analysis filterbank can be es-<br>
pecially useful when considering the human hearing charac-<br>
teristics, especially in terms of masking. To illustrate<br>
this, Fig. 9 shows a schematic sketch of the masking behav-<br>
ior of the human ear. To be more precise, Fig. 9 shows a<br>
schematic representation of the hearing threshold level of<br>
the human ear, as a function of time, when a sound or a<br>
tone having a specific frequency is present during a period<br>
of time of approximately 200 ms.<br>
However, shortly before the aforementioned sound or tone is<br>
present, as indicated by the arrow. 350 in Fig. 9, a pre-<br>
masking is present for a short period of time of approxi-<br>
mately 20 ms, therefore, enabling a smooth transition be-<br>
tween no masking and the masking during the presence of the<br>
tone or sound, which is sometimes referred to as simultane-<br>
ous masking. During the time in which the sound or tone is<br>
present, the masking is on. However, when the tone or sound<br>
disappears, as indicated by the arrow 360 in Fig. 9, the<br>
masking is not immediately lifted, but during a period of<br>
time or approximately 150 ms, the masking is slowly re-<br>
duced, which is also sometimes referred to as post-masking.<br>
That is, Fig. 9 shows a general temporal masking property<br>
of human hearing, which comprises a phase of pre-masking as<br>
well as a phase of post-masking before and after a sound or<br>
tone being present. Due to the reduction of the pre-echo<br>
behavior by incorporating a low-delay window in an embodi-<br>
ment of an analysis filterbank 100 and/or a synthesis fil-<br>
terbank 200, audible distortions will be severely limited<br>
in many cases as the audible pre-echoes will, at least to<br>
 <br>
some extent, fall into the pre-masking period of the tempo-<br>
ral masking effect of the human ear as shown in Fig. 9.<br>
Moreover, employing a low-delay window function as illus-<br>
trated in Figs. 5 to 7, described in more detail with re-<br>
spect to relations and values in tables 1 to 4 in the an-<br>
nex, offers a frequency response, which is similar to that<br>
of a sine window. To illustrate this, Fig. 10 shows a com-<br>
parison of the frequency response between the sine window<br>
(dashed line) and an example of a low-delay window (solid<br>
line) . As can be seen by comparing the two frequency re-<br>
sponses of the two aforementioned windows in Fig. 10, the<br>
low-delay window is comparable in terms of the frequency<br>
selectivity to the sine window. The frequency response of<br>
the low-delay window is similar or comparable to the fre-<br>
quency response of the sine window, and much better than<br>
the frequency response of the low-overlap window, as in<br>
comparison with the frequency responses shown in Fig. 11<br>
illustrate.<br>
To be more precise, Fig. 11 shows a comparison of the fre-<br>
quency responses between the sine window (dashed line) and<br>
the low-overlap window (solid line). As can be seen, the<br>
solid line of the frequency response of the low-overlap<br>
window is significantly larger than the corresponding fre-<br>
quency response of the sine window. As the low-delay window<br>
and the sine window show comparable frequency responses,<br>
which can be seen by comparing the two frequency responses<br>
shown in Fig. 10, also a comparison between the low-overlap<br>
window and the low-delay window can easily be drawn, as the<br>
plot shown in Figs. 10 and 11 both show the frequency re-<br>
sponse of the sine window and comprise the same scales with<br>
respect to the frequency axis and the intensity axis (db).<br>
Accordingly, it can easily be concluded that the sine win-<br>
dow which can easily implemented in an embodiment of a syn-<br>
thesis filterbank as well as in an embodiment of an analy-<br>
sis filterbank offers compared to the low-overlap window a<br>
significantly better frequency response.<br>
 <br>
As the comparison of the pre-echo behavior shown in Fig. 8<br>
is also shown at the low-delay window offers a considerable<br>
advantage compared to pre-echo behavior, while the pre-echo<br>
behavior of the low-delay window is comparable to that of a<br>
low-overlap window, the low-delay window represents an ex-<br>
cellent tradeoff between the two aforementioned windows.<br>
As a consequence, the low-delay window, which can be imple-<br>
mented in the framework of an embodiment of an analysis<br>
filterbank as well as an embodiment of a synthesis filter-<br>
bank and related embodiments, due to this trade-off, the<br>
same window function can be used for transient signals, as<br>
well as tonal signals, so that no switching between differ-<br>
ent block lengths or between different windows is neces-<br>
sary. In other words, embodiments of an analysis filter-<br>
bank, a synthesis filterbank and related embodiments offer<br>
the possibility of building an encoder, a decoder and fur-<br>
ther systems that do not require switching between differ-<br>
ent sets of operational parameters such as different block<br>
sizes, or block lengths, or different windows or window<br>
shapes. In other words, by employing an embodiment of an<br>
analysis filterbank or a synthesis filterbank with the low-<br>
delay window, the construction of an embodiment of an en-<br>
coder, decoder and related systems can considerably simpli-<br>
fied. As an additional opportunity, due to the fact that no<br>
switching between different sets of parameters is required,<br>
signals from different sources can be processed in the fre-<br>
quency-domain instead of the time-domain, which requires an<br>
additional delay as will be outlined in the following sec-<br>
tions.<br>
In yet other words, employing an embodiment of a synthesis<br>
filterbank or an analysis filterbank offers the possibility<br>
of benefiting from an advantage of low computational com-<br>
plexity in some embodiments. To compensate for the lower<br>
delay as compared to a MDCT with, for instance, a sine win-<br>
dow, a longer overlap is introduced without creating an ad-<br>
 <br>
ditional delay. Despite the longer overlap, and correspond-<br>
ingly, a window of about twice the length of the corre-<br>
sponding sine window with twice the amount of overlap and<br>
according benefits of the frequency selectivity as outlined<br>
before, an implementation can be obtained with only minor<br>
additional complexity, due to a possible increase size of<br>
block length multiplications and memory elements. However,<br>
further details on such an implementation will be explained<br>
in the context of Figs. 19 to 24.<br>
Fig. 12 shows a schematic block diagram of an embodiment of<br>
an encoder 400. The encoder 400 comprises an embodiment of<br>
an analysis filterbank 100 and, as an optional component,<br>
an entropy encoder 410, which is configured to encoding the<br>
plurality of output frames provided by the analysis filter-<br>
bank 100 and configured to outputting a plurality of en-<br>
coded frames based on the output frames. For instance, the<br>
entropy encoder 410 may be implemented as a Huffman encoder<br>
or another entropy encoder utilizing an entropy-efficient<br>
coding scheme, such as the arithmetic coding-scheme.<br>
Due to employing an embodiment of an analysis filterbank<br>
100 in the framework of an embodiment of an encoder 400,<br>
the encoder offers an output of the number of bands N while<br>
having a reconstructional delay of less than 2N or 2N-1.<br>
Moreover, an in principle an embodiment of an encoder also<br>
represents a filter, an embodiment of an encoder 400 offers<br>
a finite impulse response of more than 2N samples. That is,<br>
an embodiment of an encoder 400 represents an encoder which<br>
is capable of processing (audio) data in a delay-efficient<br>
way.<br>
Depending on the concrete implementation of an embodiment<br>
of an encoder 400 as shown in Fig. 12, such an embodiment<br>
may also comprise a quantizer, filter or further components<br>
to pre-process the input frames provided to the embodiment<br>
of the analysis filterbank 100 or to process the output<br>
frames before entropy encoding the respective frames. As an<br>
 <br>
example, an additional quantizer can be provided to an em-<br>
bodiment of an encoder 400 before the analysis filterbank<br>
100 to quantize the data or to requantize the data, depend-<br>
ing on the concrete implementation and field of applica-<br>
tion. As an example for processing behind the analysis fil-<br>
terbank, an equalization or another gain adjustment in<br>
terms of the output frames in the frequency-domain can be<br>
implemented.<br>
Fig. 13 shows an embodiment of a decoder 450 comprising an<br>
entropy decoder 460 as well as an embodiment of a synthesis<br>
filterbank 200, as previously described. The entropy de-<br>
coder 460 of the embodiment of the decoder 450 represents<br>
an optional component, which can, for instance, be config-<br>
ured for decoding a plurality of encoded frames, which<br>
might, for instance, be provided by an embodiment of an en-<br>
coder 400. Accordingly, the entropy decoder 4 60 might by a<br>
Huffman or algorithmic decoder or another entropy decoder<br>
based on an entropy-encoding/decoding scheme, which is<br>
suitable for the application of the decoder 450 at hand.<br>
Moreover, the entropy decoder 460 can be configured to pro-<br>
vide a plurality of input frames to the synthesis filter-<br>
bank 200, which, in turn, provides a plurality of added<br>
frames at an output of the synthesis filterbank 200 or at<br>
an output of the decoder 450.<br>
However, depending on the concrete implementation, the de-<br>
coder 450 may also comprise additional components, such as<br>
a dequantizer or other components such as a gain adjuster.<br>
To be more precise, in between the entropy decoder 460 and<br>
the synthesis filterbank, a gain adjuster can be imple-<br>
mented as an optional component to allow a gain adjustment<br>
or equalization in the frequency-domain before the audio<br>
data will be transferred by the synthesis filterbank 200<br>
into the time-domain. Accordingly, an additional quantizer<br>
may be implemented in a decoder 450 after the synthesis<br>
filterbank 200 to offer the opportunity of requantizing the<br>
 <br>
added frames prior to providing the optionally requantized<br>
added frames to an external component of the decoder 450.<br>
Embodiments of an encoder 400 as shown in Fig. 12 and em-<br>
bodiments of a decoder 450 as shown in Fig. 13 can be ap-<br>
plied in many fields of audio encoding/decoding as well as<br>
audio processing. Such embodiments of an encoder 400 and a<br>
decoder 450 can, for instance, be employed in the field of<br>
high-quality communications.<br>
Both, an embodiment of an encoder or coder as well as an<br>
embodiment for a decoder offer the opportunity of operating<br>
the said embodiment without having to implement a change of<br>
parameter such as switching the block length or switching<br>
between different windows. In other words, compared to<br>
other coders and decoders, an embodiment of the present in-<br>
vention in the form of a synthesis filterbank, an analysis<br>
filterbank and related embodiments is by far not required<br>
to implement different block lengths and/or different win-<br>
dow functions.<br>
Initially defined in the version 2 of the MPEG-4 audio<br>
specification, a low-delay AAC coder (AAC LD) has, over<br>
time, increasing adaptation as a full-bandwidth high-<br>
quality communications coder, which is not subjected to<br>
limitations that usual speech coders have, such as focusing<br>
on single-speakers, speech material, bad performance for<br>
music signals, and so on. This particular codec is widely<br>
used for video/teleconferencing in other communication ap-<br>
plications, which, for instance, have triggered the crea-<br>
tion of a low-delay AAC profile due to industry demand.<br>
Nonetheless, an enhancement of the coders' coding effi-<br>
ciency is of wide interest to the user community and is the<br>
topic of the contribution, which some embodiments of the<br>
present invention are capable of providing.<br>
Currently, the MPEG-4 ER AAC LD codec produces good audio<br>
quality at a bitrate range of 64 kbit/s to 4 8 kbit/s per<br>
 <br>
channel. In order to increase the coders' coding efficiency<br>
to be competitive with speech coders using the proven spec-<br>
tral band replication tool (SBR) is an excellent choice. An<br>
earlier proposal on this topic, however, was not pursued<br>
further in the course of the standardization.<br>
In order not to lose the low codec delay that is crucial<br>
for many applications, such as serving telecommunication<br>
applications, additional measures have to be taken. In many<br>
cases, as a requirement for the development of respective<br>
coders, it was defined that such a coder should be able to<br>
provide an algorithmic delay as low as 20 ms. Fortunately,<br>
only minor modifications have to be applied to existing<br>
specifications in order to meet this goal. Specifically,<br>
only two simple modifications turn out to be necessary, of<br>
which one is presented in this document. A replacement of<br>
the AAC LD coder filterbank by an embodiment of a low-delay<br>
filterbank 100, 200 alleviates a significant delay increase<br>
in many applications. Accompanying by a slight modification<br>
to the SBR tool reduces the added delay by introducing this<br>
into the coder, such as the embodiment of the encoder 400<br>
as shown in Fig. 12.<br>
As a result, the enhanced AAC ELD coder or AAC EL decoder<br>
comprising embodiments of low-delay filterbanks, exhibit a<br>
delay comparable to that of a plane AAC LD coder, but is<br>
capable of saving a significant amount of the bitrate at<br>
the same level of quality, depending on the concrete imple-<br>
mentation. To be more precise, an AAC ELD coder may be ca-<br>
pable of saving up to 25% or even up to 33% of the bitrate<br>
at the same level of quality compared to an AAC LD coder.<br>
Embodiments of a synthesis filterbank or an analysis fil-<br>
terbank can be implemented in a socalled enhanced low-delay<br>
AAC codec (AAC ELD), which is capable of extending the<br>
range of operation down to 24 kbit/s per channel, depending<br>
on the concrete implementation and application specifica-<br>
tion. In other words, embodiments of the present invention<br>
 <br>
can be implemented in the framework of a coding as an ex-<br>
tension of the AAC LD scheme utilizing optionally addi-<br>
tional coding tools. Such an optional coding tool is the<br>
spectral band replication (SBR) tool, which can be inte-<br>
grated or additionally be employed in the framework of both<br>
an embodiment of an encoder as well as an embodiment of a<br>
decoder. Especially in the field of low bitrate coding, SBR<br>
is an attractive enhancement, as it enables an implementa-<br>
tion of a dual rate coder, at which the sampling frequency<br>
for a lower part of the frequency spectrum is encoded with<br>
only half of the sampling frequency of the original sam-<br>
pler. At the same time, SBR is capable of encoding a higher<br>
spectral range of frequencies based on the lower part, such<br>
that the overall sampling frequency can, in principle, be<br>
reduced by a factor of 2.<br>
In other words, employing SBR tools make an implementation<br>
of delay-optimized components especially attractive and<br>
beneficial, as due to the reduced sampling frequency of the<br>
dual core coder, the delay saved may, in principle, reduce<br>
the overall delay of the system by a factor of 2 of the<br>
saved delay.<br>
Accordingly, a simple combination of AAC LD and SBR would,<br>
however, result in a total algorithmic delay of 60 ms, as<br>
will be explained in more detail later on. Thus, such a<br>
combination would render the resulting codec unsuitable for<br>
communication applications, as generally speaking, a system<br>
delay for interactive two-way communications should not ex-<br>
ceed 50 ms.<br>
By employing an embodiment of an analysis filterbank and/or<br>
of a synthesis filterbank, and, therefore, replacing the<br>
MDCT filterbank by one of these dedicated low-delay filter-<br>
banks may, therefore, be capable of alleviating the delay<br>
increase caused by implementing a dual rate coder as previ-<br>
ously explained. By employing the aforementioned embodi-<br>
ments, an AAC ELD coder may exhibit the delay well within<br>
 <br>
the acceptable range for bi-directional communication,<br>
while saving of up to 25% to 33% of the rate compared to a<br>
regular AAC LD coder, while maintaining the level of audio<br>
quality.<br>
Therefore, in terms of its embodiments of a synthesis in-<br>
terbank, an analysis filterbank and the other related em-<br>
bodiments, the present application describes a description<br>
of possible technical modifications along with an evalua-<br>
tion of an achievable coder performance, at least in terms<br>
of some of the embodiments of the present invention. Such a<br>
low-delay filterbank is capable of achieving a substantial<br>
delay reduction by utilizing a different window function,<br>
as previously explained, with multiple overlaps instead of<br>
employing a MDCT or IMDCT, while at the same time offering<br>
the possibility of perfect reconstruction, depending on the<br>
concrete implementation. An embodiment of such a low-delay<br>
filterbank is capable of reducing the reconstruction delay<br>
without reducing the filter length, but still maintaining<br>
the perfect reconstruction property under some circum-<br>
stances in the case of some embodiments.<br>
The resulting filterbanks have the same cosine modulation<br>
function as a traditional MDCT, but can have longer window<br>
functions, which can be non-symmetric or asymmetric with a<br>
generalized or low reconstruction delay. As previously ex-<br>
plained, an embodiment of such a new low-delay filterbank<br>
employing a new low-delay window may be capable of reducing<br>
the MDCT delay from 960 samples in the case of a frame size<br>
of M = 480 samples to 720 samples. In general, an embodi-<br>
ment of the filterbank may be capable of reducing the delay<br>
of 2M to (2M - M/2) samples by implementing M/4 zero-valued<br>
window coefficients or by adapting the appropriate compo-<br>
nents, as previously explained, accordingly such that the<br>
first subsections 150-1, 2 60-1 of the corresponding frames<br>
comprise M/4 samples less than the other subsections.<br>
 <br>
Examples for these low-delay window functions have been<br>
shown in the context of Figs. 5 to 7, wherein Figs. 6 and 7<br>
comprise the comparison with the traditional sign window as<br>
well. However, it should be noted that the analysis window<br>
is simply a time-reverses replica of the synthesis window<br>
as previously explained.<br>
In the following, a technical description of a combination<br>
of a SBR tool with a AAC LD coder in order to achieve a low<br>
bitrate and low delay audio coding system will be given. A<br>
dual rate system is used to achieve a higher coding gain<br>
compared to a single rate system, as explained earlier on.<br>
By employing a dual rate system, a more energy efficient<br>
encoding as possible having lesser frequency bands will be<br>
provided by the corresponding coder, which leads to a bit-<br>
wise reduction due to some extent, removing redundant in-<br>
formation from the frames provided by the coder. To be more<br>
precise, an embodiment of a low-delay filterbank as previ-<br>
ously described is used in the framework of the AAC LD core<br>
coder to arrive at an overall delay that is acceptable for<br>
communication applications. In other words, in the follow-<br>
ing, the delay will be described in terms of both the AAC<br>
LD core and the AAC ELD core coder.<br>
By employing an embodiment of a synthesis filterbank or an<br>
analysis filterbank, a delay reduction can be achieved by<br>
implementing a modified MDCT window/filterbank. Substantial<br>
delay reduction is achieved by utilizing the aforementioned<br>
and described different window functions with multiple<br>
overlap to extend the MDCT and the IMDCT to obtain a low-<br>
delay filterbank. The technique of low-delay filterbanks<br>
allows utilizing a non-orthogonal window with multiple<br>
overlap. In this way, it is possible to obtain a delay,<br>
which is lower than the window length. Hence, a low delay<br>
with a still long impulse response resulting in good fre-<br>
quency selectivity can be achieved.<br>
 <br>
The low-delay window for a frame size of M = 480 samples<br>
reduces the MDCT delay from 960 samples to 720 samples, as<br>
previously explained.<br>
To summarize, in contrast to a MPEG-4 ER AAC LD codec, an<br>
embodiment of an encoder and an embodiment of a decoder 450<br>
may under certain circumstances be capable of producing a<br>
good audio quality at a very small bit range. While the<br>
aforementioned ER AAC LD codec produces good audio quality<br>
as a bit range of 64 kb/sec to 48 kb/sec per channel, the<br>
embodiments of the encoder 400 and the decoder 450, as de-<br>
scribed in the present document, can be capable of provid-<br>
ing an audio coder and decoder, which is under some circum-<br>
stances able to produce at an equal audio quality at even<br>
lower bitrates of about 32 kb/sec per channel. Moreover,<br>
embodiments of an encoder and decoder have an algorithmic<br>
delay small enough to be utilized for two-way communication<br>
systems, which can be implemented in existing technology by<br>
using only minimum modifications.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention, especially in the<br>
form of an encoder 4 00 and a decoder 450, achieve this by<br>
combining existing MPEG-4 audio technology with a minimum<br>
number adaptation necessary for low-delay operations neces-<br>
sary for low-delay operation to arrive at embodiments of<br>
the present invention. Specifically, the MPEG-4 ER AAC low-<br>
delay coder can be combined with a MPEG-4 spectral band<br>
replication (SPR) tool to implement embodiments of an en-<br>
coder 400 and a decoder 450 by considering the described<br>
modifications. The resulting increase in algorithmic delay<br>
is alleviated by minor modifications of the SPR tool, which<br>
will not be described in the present application, and the<br>
use of an embodiment of a low-delay core coder filterbank<br>
and an embodiment of an analysis filterbank or a synthesis<br>
filterbank. Depending on the concrete implementation, such<br>
an enhanced AAC LD coder is capable of saving up to 33% of<br>
the bitrate at the same level of quality compared to a<br>
 <br>
plain ACC LD coder while retaining low enough delay for a<br>
two-way communication application.<br>
Before a more detailed delay analysis is presented with<br>
reference to Fig. 14, a coding system comprising a SBR tool<br>
is described. In other words, in this section, all compo-<br>
nents of a coding system 500 shown in Fig. 14a are analyzed<br>
with respect to their contribution to the overall system<br>
delay. Fig. 14a gives a detailed overview of the complete<br>
system, wherein Fig. 14b puts emphasis on the sources of<br>
delay.<br>
The system shown in Fig. 14a comprises an encoder 500,<br>
which, in turn, comprises an MDCT time/frequency converter,<br>
operates in the dual rate approach as a dual rate coder.<br>
Moreover, the encoder 500 also comprises a QMF-analysis<br>
filterbank 520, which is part of the SBR tool. Both the<br>
MDCT time/frequency converter 510 and the QMF-analysis fil-<br>
terbank (QMF = Quadrature Mirror Filter) are coupled to-<br>
gether both in terms of their inputs and their outputs. In<br>
other words, both the MDCT converter 510 as well as the<br>
QMF-analysis filterbank 520 is provided with the same input<br>
data. However, while the MDCT converter 510 provides the<br>
low band information, the QMF-analysis filterbank 520 pro-<br>
vides the SBR data. Both data are combined into a bit<br>
stream and provided to a decoder 530.<br>
The decoder 530 comprises an IMDCT frequency/time converter<br>
54 0, which is capable of decoding the bit stream to obtain,<br>
at least in terms of the low band parts, a time-domain sig-<br>
nal, which will be provided to an output of the decoder via<br>
a delayer 550. Moreover, an output of the IMDCT converter<br>
540 is coupled to a further QMF-analysis filterbank 560,<br>
which is part of a SBR tool of the decoder 530. Further-<br>
more, the SBR tool comprises a HF generator 570, which is<br>
coupled to an output of the QMF-analysis filterbank 560 and<br>
capable of generating the higher frequency components based<br>
on the SBR data of the QMF-analysis filterbank 520 of the<br>
 <br>
encoder 500. An output of the HF generator 570 is coupled<br>
to a QMF-synthesis filterbank 580, which transforms the<br>
signals in the QMF-domain back into the time domain in<br>
which the delayed low band signals are combined with the<br>
high band signals, as provided by the SBR tool of the de-<br>
coder 530. The resulting data will then be provided as the<br>
output data of thee decoder 530.<br>
Compared to Fig. 14a, Fig. 14b emphasizes the delay sources<br>
of the system shown in Fig. 14a. To be even more precise,<br>
depending on the concrete implementation of the encoder 500<br>
and the decoder 530, Fig. 14b illustrates the delay sources<br>
of the MPEG-4 ER AAC LD system comprising a SBR tool. The<br>
appropriate coder of this audio system utilizes a<br>
MDCT/IMDCT filterbank for a time/frequency/time transforma-<br>
tion or conversion with a frame size of 512 or 480 samples.<br>
The results in reconstruction delays, therefore, which are<br>
equal to 1024 are 960 samples, depending on the concrete<br>
implementation. In case of using the MPEG-4 ER AAC LD codec<br>
in combination with SBR in a dual rate mode, the delay<br>
value has to be doubled due to the sampling rate conver-<br>
sion.<br>
A more detailed overall delay analysis and requirement<br>
shows that in the case of an AAC LD codec in combination<br>
with a SBR tool, an overall algorithmic delay of 16 ms at a<br>
sampling rate of 48 kHz and the core coder frame size of<br>
480 samples will be the result. Fig. 15 comprises a table,<br>
which gives an overview of the delay produced by the dif-<br>
ferent components assuming a sampling rate of 48 kHz and<br>
the core coder frame size of 480 samples, wherein the core<br>
coder effectively runs at a sampling rate of 24 kHz due to<br>
the dual rate approach.<br>
The overview of the delay sources in Fig. 15 shows that in<br>
the case of an AAC LD codec along with a SBR tool, an over-<br>
all algorithmic delay of 16 ms would result, which is sub-<br>
stantially higher than what is permissible for telecommuni-<br>
 <br>
cation applications. This evaluation comprises the standard<br>
combination of the AAC LD coder along with the SBR tool,<br>
which includes the delay contributions from the MDCT/IMDCT<br>
dual rate components, the QMF components and the SBR over-<br>
lap components.<br>
However, using the adaptations described previously and by<br>
employing embodiments as described before, an overall delay<br>
of only 42 ms is achievable, which includes the delay con-<br>
tributions from the embodiments of the low-delay filter-<br>
banks in the dual rate mode (ELD MDCT + IMDCT) and the QMF<br>
components.<br>
As with respect to some delay sources in the framework of<br>
the AAC core coder as well as with respect to the SBR mod-<br>
ule, the algorithmic delay of the AAC LD core can be de-<br>
scribed as being 2M samples, wherein, once again, M is the<br>
basic frame length of the core coder. In contrast, the low-<br>
delay filterbank reduces the number of samples by M/2 due<br>
to introducing the initial sections 160, 270 or by intro-<br>
ducing an appropriate number of zero-valued or other values<br>
in the framework of the appropriate window functions. In<br>
the case of the usage of an AAC core in combination with a<br>
SBR tool, the delay is doubled due to the sampling rate<br>
conversion of a dual rate system.<br>
To clarify, some of the numbers given in the table in Fig.<br>
15, in the framework of a typical SBR decoder, two delay<br>
sources can be identified. On the one hand, the QMF compo-<br>
nents comprise a filterbank's reconstruction delay of 640<br>
samples. However, since the framing delay of 64-1 = 63 sam-<br>
ples is already introduced by the core coder itself, it can<br>
be subtracted to obtain the delayed value given in the ta-<br>
ble in Fig. 15 of 577 samples.<br>
On the other hand, the SBR HF reconstruction causes an ad-<br>
ditional delay with a standard SBR tool of 6 QMF slots due<br>
 <br>
to the variable time grid. Accordingly, the delay is in the<br>
standard SBR, six times 64 samples of 384 samples.<br>
By implementing embodiments of filterbanks as well as im-<br>
plementing an improved SBR tool, a delay saving of 18 ms<br>
can be achieved by not implementing a straightforward com-<br>
bination of a AAC LD coder along with a SBR tool having an<br>
overall delay of 60 ms, but an overall delay of 42 ms is<br>
achievable. As previously mentioned, these figures are<br>
based on a sampling rate of 48 kHz and on a frame length of<br>
M = 480 samples. In other words, apart from the socalled<br>
framing delay of M » 480 samples in the aforementioned ex-<br>
ample, the overlap delay, which is a second important as-<br>
pect in terms of delay optimization, can be significantly-<br>
reduced by introducing an embodiment of a synthesis filter-<br>
bank or an analysis filterbank to achieve a low bitrate and<br>
a low-delay audio coding system.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention can be implemented in<br>
many fields of application, such as conferencing systems<br>
and other bi-directional communication systems. At the time<br>
of its conception around 1997, the delayed requirements set<br>
for a low-delay general audio coding scheme, which lead to<br>
the design of the AAC LD coder, were to achieve an algo-<br>
rithmic delay of 20 ms, which is met by the AAC LD when<br>
running at a sample rate of 48 kHz and a frame size of M -<br>
480. In contrast to this, many practical applications of<br>
this codec, such as teleconferencing, employ a sampling<br>
rate of 32 kHz and, thus, work with a delay of 30 ms. Simi-<br>
larly, due to the growing importance of IP-based communica-<br>
tions, the delay requirements of modern ITU telecommunica-<br>
tion codec allow delay of, roughly speaking, 40 ms. Differ-<br>
ent examples include the recent G.722.1 annex C coder with<br>
an algorithmic delay of 40 ms and the G.729.1 coder with an<br>
algorithmic delay of 48 ms. Thus, the overall delay<br>
achieved by an enhanced AAC LD coder or AAC ELD coder com-<br>
prising an embodiment of a low-delay filterbank can be op-<br>
 <br>
erated to fully lie within the delay range of common tele-<br>
communication coders.<br>
Fig. 16 shows a block diagram of an embodiment of a mixer<br>
600 for mixing a plurality of input frames, wherein each<br>
input frame is a spectral representation of a corresponding<br>
time-domain frame being provided from a different source.<br>
For instance, each input frame for the mixer 600 can be<br>
provided by an embodiment of an encoder 400 or another ap-<br>
propriate system or component. It should be noted that in<br>
Fig. 16, the mixer 600 is adapted to receive input frames<br>
from three different sources. However, this does not repre-<br>
sent any limitation. To be more precise, in principle, an<br>
embodiment of a mixer 600 can be adapted or configured to<br>
process and receive an arbitrary number of input frames,<br>
each input frame provided by a different source, such as a<br>
different encoder 400.<br>
The embodiment of the mixer 600 shown in Fig. 16 comprises<br>
an entropy decoder 610, which is capable of entropy decod-<br>
ing the plurality of input frames provided by the different<br>
sources. Depending on the concrete implementation, the en-<br>
tropy decoder 610 can for instance be implemented as a<br>
Huffman entropy decoder or as an entropy decoder employing<br>
another entropy decoding algorithm such as the socalled<br>
Arithmetic Coding, Unary Coding, Elias Gamma Coding, Fibo-<br>
nacci Coding, Golomb Coding or Rice Coding.<br>
The entropy decoded input frames are then provided to an<br>
optional dequantizer 620, which can be adapted such that<br>
the entropy decoded input frames can be dequantized to ac-<br>
commodate for application-specific circumstances, such as<br>
the loudness characteristic of the human ear. The entropy<br>
decoded and optionally dequantized input frames are then<br>
provided to a scaler 630, which is capable of scaling the<br>
plurality of entropy frames in the frequency domain. De-<br>
pending of the concrete implementation of an embodiment of<br>
a mixer 600, the scaler 630 can for instance, scale each of<br>
 <br>
the optionally dequantized and entropy decoded input frames<br>
by multiplying each of the values by a constant factor 1/P,<br>
wherein P is an integer indicating the number of different<br>
sources or encoders 400.<br>
In other words, the scaler 630 is in this case capable of<br>
scaling down the frames provided by the dequantizer 620 or<br>
the entropy decoder 610 to scale them down to prevent the<br>
corresponding signals from becoming too large in order to<br>
prevent an overflow or another computational error, or to<br>
prevent audible distortions like clipping. Different imple-<br>
mentations of the scaler 630 can also be implemented, such<br>
as a scaler which is capable of scaling the provided frame<br>
in an energy conserving manner, by for instance, evaluating<br>
the energy of each of the input frames, depending on one or<br>
more spectral frequency bands. In such a case, in each of<br>
these spectral frequency bands, the corresponding values in<br>
the frequency domain can be multiplied with a constant fac-<br>
tor, such that the overall energy with respect to all fre-<br>
quency ranges is identical. Additionally or alternatively,<br>
the scaler 630 may also be adapted such that the energy of<br>
each of the spectral subgroups is identical with respect to<br>
all input frames of all different sources, or that the<br>
overall energy of each of the input frames is constant.<br>
The scaler 630 is then coupled to an adder 640,which is ca-<br>
pable of adding up the frames provided by the scaler, which<br>
are also referred to as scaled frames in the frequency do-<br>
main to generate an added frame also in the frequency do-<br>
main. This can for instance be accomplished by adding up<br>
all values corresponding to the same sample index from all<br>
scaled frames provided by the scaler 630.<br>
The adder 640 is capable of adding up the frames provided<br>
by the scaler 6340 in the frequency domain to obtain an<br>
added frame, which comprises the information of all sources<br>
as provided by the scaler 630. As a further optional compo-<br>
nent, an embodiment of a mixer 600 may also comprise a<br>
 <br>
quantizer 650 to which the added frame of the adder 640 may<br>
be provided to. According to the application-specific re-<br>
quirements, the optional quantizer 650 can for instance be<br>
used to adapt the added frame to fulfill some conditions.<br>
For instance, the quantizer 650 may be adapted such that<br>
the tact of the dequantizer 620 may be reversed. In other<br>
words, if for instance, a special characteristic underlies<br>
the input frames as provided to the mixer, which has been<br>
removed or altered by the dequantizer 620, the quantizer<br>
650 may then be adapted to provide these special require-<br>
ments of conditions to the added frame. As an example, the<br>
quantizer 650 may for instance be adapted to accommodate<br>
for the characteristics of the human ear.<br>
As a further component, the embodiment of the mixer 600 may<br>
further comprise an entropy encoder 660, which is capable<br>
of entropy encoding the optionally quantized added frame<br>
and to provide a mixed frame to one or more receivers, for<br>
instance, comprising an embodiment of an encoder 450. Once<br>
again, the entropy encoder 660 may be adapted to entropy<br>
encoding the added frame based on the Huffman algorithm or<br>
another of the aforementioned algorithms.<br>
By employing an embodiment of an analysis filterbank, a<br>
synthesis filterbank or another related embodiment in the<br>
framework of an encoder and a decoder, a mixer can be es-<br>
tablished and implemented which is capable of mixing sig-<br>
nals in the frequency-domain. In other words, by implement-<br>
ing an embodiment of one of the previously described en-<br>
hanced low-delay AAC codecs, a mixer can be implemented,<br>
which is capable of directly mixing a plurality of input<br>
frames in the frequency domain, without having to transform<br>
the respective input frames into the time-domain to accom-<br>
modate for the possible switching of parameters, which are<br>
implemented in state-of-the-art-codecs for speech communi-<br>
cations. As explained in the context of the embodiments of<br>
an analysis filterbank and a synthesis filterbank, these<br>
embodiments enable an operation without switching parame-<br>
 <br>
ters, like switching the block lengths or switching between<br>
different windows.<br>
Fig. 17 shows an embodiment of a conferencing system 7 00 in<br>
the form of a MCU (Media Control Unit), which, can for in-<br>
stance be implemented in the framework of a server. The<br>
conferencing system 700 or MCU 700 comprises for a plural-<br>
ity of bit streams, of which in Fig. 17, two are shown. A<br>
combined entropy decoder and dequantizer 610, 620 as well<br>
as a combined unit 630, 640 which are labeled in Fig. 17 as<br>
"mixer". Moreover, the output of the combined unit 630, 640<br>
is provided to the combined unit comprising a quantizer 650<br>
and the entropy encoder 660, which provides as the mixed<br>
frames an outgoing bit stream.<br>
In other words, Fig. 17 shows an embodiment of a conferenc-<br>
ing system 700 which is capable of mixing a plurality of<br>
incoming bit streams in the frequency domain, as the incom-<br>
ing bit stream as well as the outgoing bit streams have<br>
been created using a low-delay window on the encoder side,<br>
whereas the outgoing bit streams are intended and capable<br>
of being processed, based on the same low-delay window on<br>
the decoder side. In other words, the MCU 700 shown in Fig.<br>
17 is based on the use of one universal low-delay window<br>
only.<br>
An embodiment of a mixer 600 as well as an embodiment of a<br>
conferencing system 700 is therefore suitable to be applied<br>
in the framework of embodiments of the present invention in<br>
the form of an analysis filterbank, a synthesis filterbank<br>
and the other related embodiments. To be more precise, a<br>
technical application of an embodiment of a low-delay codec<br>
with only one window allows a mixing in the frequency-<br>
domain. For instance, in (tele-) conferencing scenarios<br>
with more than two participants or sources, it might often<br>
be desirable to receive several codec signals, mix them up<br>
to one signal and further transmit the resulting encoded<br>
signal. By employing an embodiment of the present invention<br>
 <br>
on the encoder and the decoder side, in some embodiments of<br>
a conferencing system 700 and the mixer 600, the implemen-<br>
tational method can be reduced compared to a straightfor-<br>
ward manner of decoding the incoming signals, mixing the<br>
decoded signals in the time-domain and re-encoding the<br>
mixed signal again into the frequency-domain.<br>
The implementation of such a straightforward mixer in the<br>
form of a MCU is shown in Fig. 18 as a conferencing system<br>
750. The conferencing system 750 also comprises a combined<br>
module 760 for each of the incoming bit streams operating<br>
in the frequency domain and capable of entropy decoding and<br>
dequantization of the incoming bit streams. However, in the<br>
conferencing system 750 shown in Fig. 18, the modules 7 60<br>
are coupled to the IMDCT converter 770 each, of which one<br>
is operating in the sine window mode of operation, whereas<br>
the other one is currently operating in the low-overlap<br>
window mode of operation. In other words, the two IMDCT<br>
converters 770 transform the incoming bit streams from the<br>
frequency-domain into the time-domain, which is necessary<br>
in the case of a conferencing system 750 as the incoming<br>
bit streams are based on an encoder, which uses both, the<br>
sine window and the low-overlap window, depending on the<br>
audio signal to encode the respective signals.<br>
The conferencing system 750 furthermore comprises a mixer<br>
780, which mixes in the time-domain the two incoming sig-<br>
nals from the two IMDCT converters 770 and provides a mixed<br>
time-domain signal to a MDCT converter 790, which transfers<br>
the signal from the time-domain into the frequency-domain.<br>
The mixed signal in the frequency domain as provided by the<br>
MDCT 790 is then provided to a combined module 7 95, which<br>
is then capable of quantizing an entropy encoding the sig-<br>
nal to form the outgoing bit stream.<br>
However, the approach according to the conferencing system<br>
750 has two disadvantages. Due to the complete decoding and<br>
 <br>
encoding done by the two IMDCT converters 770 and the MDCT<br>
790, the high computational cost is to be paid by imple-<br>
menting the conferencing system 750. Moreover, due to the<br>
introduction of the decoding and encoding, an additional<br>
delay is introduced which can be high under certain circum-<br>
stances .<br>
By employing on the decoder and encoder sites, embodiments<br>
of the represent invention, or to be more precise, by im-<br>
plementing the new low-delay window, these disadvantages<br>
can be overcome or eliminated depending on the concrete im-<br>
plementation in the case of some embodiments. This is<br>
achieved by doing the mixing in the frequency domain as ex-<br>
plained in the context of the conferencing system 700 in<br>
Fig. 17. As a consequence, the embodiment of a conferencing<br>
system 700 as shown in Fig. 17 does not comprise transforms<br>
and/or filterbanks which have to be implemented in the<br>
framework of the conferencing system 750 for decoding an<br>
encoding the signals in order to transform the signals from<br>
the frequency domain into the time-domain and back again.<br>
In other words, the bit stream mixing in the case of dif-<br>
ferent window shapes results in additional cost of one ad-<br>
ditional block of delay due to the MDCT/IMDCT converter<br>
770, 790.<br>
As consequence, in some embodiments of the mixer 600 and in<br>
some embodiments of the conferencing system 700 as addi-<br>
tional advantages, lower computational costs and a limita-<br>
tion with respect to additional delay can be implemented,<br>
such that in some cases even no additional delay might be<br>
achievable.<br>
Fig. 19 shows an embodiment of an efficient implementation<br>
of a low-delay filterbank. To be more precise, before dis-<br>
cussing the computational complexity and further applica-<br>
tion related aspects, in the framework of Fig. 19, an em-<br>
bodiment of a synthesis filterbank 800 will be described in<br>
more detail, which can for instance be implemented in an<br>
 <br>
embodiment of a decoder. The embodiment of a low-delay<br>
analysis filterbank 800, hence, symbolizes a reverse of an<br>
embodiment of a synthesis filterbank or an encoder.<br>
The synthesis filterbank 800 comprises an inverse type-iv<br>
discrete cosine transform frequency/time converter 810,<br>
which is capable of providing a plurality of output frames<br>
to a combined module 820 comprising a windower and an over-<br>
lap/adder. To be more precise, the time/frequency 810 is an<br>
inverse type-iv discrete cosine transform converter, which<br>
is provided with an input frame comprising M ordered input<br>
values yk(0) ,...,yk(M-1) , wherein M is once again a positive<br>
integer and wherein k is an integer indicating a frame in-<br>
dex. The time/frequency converter 810 provides 2M ordered<br>
output samples xk (0),..., xk(2M-1) based on the input values<br>
and provides these output samples to the module 820 which<br>
in turn comprises the windower and the overlap/adder men-<br>
tioned before.<br>
The windower of the module 820 is capable of generating a<br>
plurality of windowed frames, wherein each of the windowed<br>
frames comprises a plurality of windowed samples<br>
Zk(0) ,..., zk(2M-1) based on the equation or expression<br>
 <br>
wherein n is once again an integer indicating a sample in-<br>
dex and w(n) is a real-valued window function coefficient<br>
corresponding to the sample index n. The overlap/adder also<br>
comprised in the module 820, provides or generates than in<br>
the intermediate frame comprising a plurality of intermedi-<br>
ate samples Mk(0),...Mk(M-l) based on the equation or expres-<br>
sion<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The embodiment of the synthesis filterbank 800 further com-<br>
prises a lifter 850, which produces an added frame compris-<br>
ing a plurality of added samples outk(0),...,outk(m-1) based<br>
on the equation or expression<br>
 <br>
wherein 1(M-1-n),...,1(M-1) are real-valued lifting coeffi-<br>
cients. In Fig. 19, the embodiment of the computationally<br>
efficient implementation of a low-delay filterbank 800 com-<br>
prises in the framework of the lifter 830, a plurality of<br>
combined delayers and multipliers 840 as well as a plural-<br>
ity of adders 850 to carry out the aforementioned calcula-<br>
tions in the framework of the lifter 830.<br>
Depending on the concrete implementation of an embodiment<br>
of a synthesis filterbank 800, the window coefficients or<br>
window function coefficients w(n) obey the relations given<br>
in table 5 of the annex in the case of an embodiment with M<br>
= 512 input values per input frame. Table 9 of the annex<br>
comprise a set of relations, which the windowing coeffi-<br>
cients w(n) obey, in the case of M=480 input values per in-<br>
put frame. Moreover, tables 6 and 10 comprise relations for<br>
the lifting coefficients l(n) for embodiments with M=512<br>
and M=480, respectively.<br>
However, in some embodiments of a synthesis filterbank 800,<br>
the window coefficients w(n) comprise the values given in<br>
table 7 and 11, for embodiments with M = 512 and M = 480<br>
input values per input frame, respectively. Accordingly,<br>
tables 8 and 12 in the annex comprise the values for the<br>
 <br>
lifting coefficient 1(n) for embodiments with M = 512 and M<br>
= 480 input samples per input frame, respectively.<br>
In other words, an embodiment of a low-delay filterbank 800<br>
can be implemented as sufficiently as a regular MDCT con-<br>
verter. The general structure of such an embodiment is il-<br>
lustrated in Fig. 19. The inverse DCT-IV and the inverse<br>
windowing-overlap/add are performed in the same way as the<br>
traditional windows, however, employing the aforementioned<br>
windowing coefficients, depending on the concrete implemen-<br>
tation of the embodiment. As in the case of the windowing<br>
coefficients in the framework of the embodiment of the syn-<br>
thesis filterbank 200, also in this case M/4 window coeffi-<br>
cients are zero-valued windowed coefficients, which thus do<br>
not, in principle, involve any operation. For the extended<br>
overlap into the past, only M additional multiplier-add op-<br>
erations are required, as can be seen in the framework of<br>
the lifter 830. These additional operations are sometimes<br>
also referred to as "zero-delay matrices". Sometimes these<br>
operations are also known as "lifting steps".<br>
The efficient implementation shown in Fig. 19 may under<br>
some circumstances be more efficient as a straightforward<br>
implementation of a synthesis filterbank 200. To be more<br>
precise, depending on the concrete implementation, such a<br>
more efficient implementation might result in saving M op-<br>
erations, as in the case of a straightforward implementa-<br>
tion for M operations, it might be advisable to implement,<br>
as the implementation shown in Fig. 19, requires in princi-<br>
ple, 2M operations in the framework of the module 820 and M<br>
operations in the framework of the lifter 830.<br>
In terms of an assessment concerning the complexity of an<br>
embodiment of a low-delay filterbank, especially in terms<br>
of the computational complexity, Fig. 20 comprises a table<br>
which illustrates the arithmetic complexity of an embodi-<br>
ment of an implementation of an embodiment of a synthesis<br>
filterbank 800 according to Fig. 19 in the case of M-512<br>
 <br>
input values per input frame. To be more precise, the table<br>
in Fig. 20 comprises an estimate of the resulting overall<br>
number of operations in the case of an (modified) IMDCT<br>
converter along with a windowing in the case of a low-delay<br>
window function. The overall number of operations is 9600.<br>
In comparison, Fig. 21 comprises a table of the arithmetic<br>
complexity of IMDCT along with the complexity required for<br>
windowing based on the sine window for a parameter M=512,<br>
which gives the total number of operations for the codec<br>
such as the AAC LD codec. To be more precise, the arithme-<br>
tic complexity of this IMDCT converter along with the win-<br>
dowing for the sine window is 9216 operations, which is of<br>
the same order of magnitude as the resulting overall number<br>
of operations in the case of the embodiment of the synthe-<br>
sis filterbank 800 shown in Fig. 19.<br>
As a further comparison, Fig. 22 comprises a table for an<br>
AAC LC codec, which is also known as the advance audio co-<br>
dec with low complexity. The arithmetic complexity of this<br>
IMDCT converter, including the operations for windowing<br>
overlap for the AAC LC (M-1024) is 19968.<br>
A comparison of these figures show that in summary, the<br>
complexity of the core coder comprising an embodiment of an<br>
enhanced low-delay filterbank is essentially comparable to<br>
that of a core coder, using a regular MDCT-IMDCT filter-<br>
bank. Moreover, the number of operations is roughly speak-<br>
ing half the number of operations of an AAC LC codec.<br>
Fig. 23 comprises two tables, wherein Fig. 23a comprises a<br>
comparison of the memory requirements of different codecs,<br>
whereas Fig. 23b comprises the same estimate with respect<br>
to the ROM requirement. To be more precise, the tables in<br>
both Figs. 23a and 23b each comprise for the aforementioned<br>
codecs AAC LD, AAC ELD and AAC LC information concerning<br>
the frame length, the working buffer and concerning the<br>
state buffer in terms of the RAM-requirement (Fig. 23a) and<br>
 <br>
information concerning the frame length, the number of win-<br>
dow coefficients and the sum, in terms of the ROM-memory<br>
requirements (Fig. 23b). As previously mentioned in the ta-<br>
bles in Figs. 23a and 23b, the abbreviation AAC, ELD refer<br>
to an embodiment of a synthesis filterbank, analysis fil-<br>
terbank, encoder, decoder or a later embodiment. To summa-<br>
rize, compared to the IMDCT with sine window, the described<br>
efficient implementation according to Fig. 19 of an embodi-<br>
ment of the low-delay filterbank requires an additional<br>
state memory of length M and M additional coefficients, the<br>
lifting coefficients 1 (0),..., 1(M-1). Thus as a frame length<br>
of the AAC LD is half the frame length of the AAC LC, the<br>
resulting memory requirement is in the range of that of the<br>
AAC LC.<br>
In terms of the memory requirements, the tables shown in<br>
Fig. 23a and 23b, hence, compare the RAM and ROM require-<br>
ments for the three aforementioned codecs. It can be seen<br>
that the memory increase for the low-delay filterbank is<br>
only moderate. The overall memory requirement is still much<br>
lower compared to an AAC LC codec or implementation.<br>
Fig. 24 comprises a list of used codecs for a MUSHRA test<br>
used in the framework of a performance assessment. In the<br>
table shown in Fig. 24, the abbreviation AOT stands for Au-<br>
dio Object Type, wherein the entry "X" stands for the audio<br>
object tape ER AAC ELD which can also be set to 39. In<br>
other words, the AOT, X or AOT 39 identifies an embodiment<br>
of a synthesis filterbank or an analysis filterbank. The<br>
abbreviation AOT stands in this context for "audio object<br>
type".<br>
In the framework of a MUSHRA test, the influence of using<br>
an embodiment of the low-delay filterbank on top of the<br>
previously described coder was tested by carrying out a<br>
listening test for all the combinations in the list. To be<br>
more precise, the result of these tests enable the follow-<br>
ing conclusions. The AAC ELD decoder at 32 kbit/s per chan-<br>
 <br>
nel, performs significantly better than the original AAC L<br>
decoder at 32 kb/s. Moreover, the AAC ELD decoder at 32<br>
kb/s per channel performs statistically indistinguishable<br>
from the original AAC LD decoder at 48 kb/s per channel. As<br>
a check point coder, binding AAC LD and the low-delay fil-<br>
terbank performs statistically indistinguishable from an<br>
original AAC LD coder both running at 48 kb/s. This con-<br>
firms the appropriateness of a low-delay filterbank.<br>
Thus, the overall coder performance remains comparable,<br>
while a significant saving in codec delay is achieved.<br>
Moreover, it was possible to retain the coder pressure per-<br>
formance .<br>
As previously explained, promising application scenarios or<br>
applications of embodiments of the present invention, such<br>
as an embodiment of an AAC ELD codec are high fidelity<br>
video-teleconferencing and voice over IP applications of<br>
the next generation. This includes the transmission of ar-<br>
bitrary audio signals, such as speech or music, or in the<br>
context of a multimedia presentation, at high quality lev-<br>
els and competitive bitrates. The low algorithmic delay of<br>
an embodiment of the present invention (AAC ELD) makes this<br>
codec an excellent choice for all kinds of communication<br>
and applications.<br>
Moreover, the present document has described the construc-<br>
tion of an enhanced AAC ELD decoder which may optionally be<br>
combined with a spectral band replication (SBR) tool. In<br>
order to constrain the associated increase in delay, minor<br>
modifications in terms of a real, live implementation may<br>
become necessary in the SBR tool and the core coder mod-<br>
ules. The performance of the resulting enhanced low-delay<br>
audio decoding based on the aforementioned technology is<br>
significantly increased, compared to what is currently de-<br>
livered by the MPEG-4 audio standard. Complexity of the<br>
core coding scheme remains, however, essentially identical.<br>
 <br>
Moreover, embodiments of the present invention comprise an<br>
analysis filterbank or synthesis filterbank including a<br>
low-delay analysis window or a low-delay synthesis filter.<br>
Moreover, an embodiment of a method of analyzing a signal<br>
or synthesizing a signal having a low-delay analysis fil-<br>
tering step or a low-delay synthesis filtering step. Em-<br>
bodiments of a low-delay analysis filter or low-delay syn-<br>
thesis filter are also described. Moreover, computer pro-<br>
grams having a program code for implementing one of the<br>
above methods when running on a computer are disclosed. An<br>
embodiment of the present invention comprises also an en-<br>
coder having a low delay analysis filter, or decoder having<br>
a low delay synthesis filter, or one of the corresponding<br>
methods.<br>
Depending on certain implementation requirements of the em-<br>
bodiments of the inventive methods, embodiments of the in-<br>
ventive methods can be implemented in hardware, or in soft-<br>
ware. The implementation can be performed using a digital<br>
storage medium, in particular, a disc a CD, or a DVD having<br>
electronically readable control signals stored thereon,<br>
which cooperate with the programmable computer or a proces-<br>
sor such that an embodiment of the inventive methods is<br>
performed. Generally, an embodiment of the present inven-<br>
tion is, therefore, a computer program product with program<br>
code stored on a machine-readable carrier, the program code<br>
being operative for performing an embodiment of the inven-<br>
tive methods when the computer program product runs on the<br>
computer or processor. In other words, embodiments of the<br>
inventive methods are therefore, a computer program having<br>
a program code for performing at least one of the embodi-<br>
ments of the inventive methods, when the computer program<br>
runs of the computer or processor. In this context, proces-<br>
sors comprise CPUs (Central Processing Unit), ASICs (Appli-<br>
cation Specific Integrated Circuits) or further integrated<br>
circuits (IC).<br>
