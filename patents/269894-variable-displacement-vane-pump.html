				<td>VARIABLE DISPLACEMENT VANE PUMP<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to a variable vane pump and<br>
more particularly to a variable vane pump having speed dependent<br>
displacement.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0003] The majority of passenger car and light and medium duty trucks<br>
utilize automatic transmissions having hydraulic fluid control circuits. A hydraulic<br>
pump within the transmission provides a flow of pressurized hydraulic fluid which<br>
is controlled by valves to actuate various clutches and brakes to select and<br>
achieve the desired gear (speed) ratio.<br>
[0004] The size of a hydraulic pump, often characterized by the<br>
available or generated hydraulic fluid flow rate and pressure, in an automatic<br>
transmission can be problematic. On the one hand, it must be large enough to<br>
deliver sufficient flow and pressure at low speeds to enable proper operation of<br>
the valves, clutches and brakes. A configuration that achieves this will, however,<br>
invariably deliver excess flow and pressure at high speeds, flow which is returned<br>
through a pressure regulator valve to a sump.   Such excess pump capacity at<br><br>
high speeds is obviously inefficient but is an undesirable but essentially inevitable<br>
result of sizing the pump for sufficient fluid delivery at low speeds.<br>
[0005] One solution to this problem has been the use of two pumps: a<br>
first lower volume pump and a second, higher volume pump. This solution is less<br>
efficient than a single pump, still requires a pressure regulator valve and also<br>
requires control devices which switch between the two pumps in accordance with<br>
a predetermined operating schedule.<br>
[0006] Variable displacement vane pumps are known in the art.<br>
However, such pumps suffer from inefficiencies which conventional, fixed<br>
displacement pumps do not exhibit. Thus, a vane pump having a variable<br>
displacement capability which exhibits the efficiency of a conventional, fixed<br>
displacement vane pump would be desirable. The present invention is so<br>
directed.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] The present invention provides a vane pump having variable<br>
displacement and high efficiency. The variable displacement vane pump<br>
includes a plurality of elongate, axially extending inserts disposed in the rotor.<br>
One of the inserts is disposed between every adjacent vane pair. The inserts are<br>
received within axially extending pockets in the rotor and are coupled to the rotor<br>
by tension or compression springs. At lower rotational speeds, the inserts are<br>
retracted and the displacement of the pump chambers is at maximum. At higher<br>
rotational speeds, the inserts are advanced into the pump chambers, effectively<br><br>
reducing their displacement. Thus, the variable displacement pump<br>
compensates for the varying drive speed and achieves improved uniformity of<br>
fluid flow by providing maximum displacement at low speeds and reduced<br>
displacement at higher speeds.<br>
[0008] The variable displacement vane pump according to the present<br>
invention finds broad application and is suitable for use in automatic<br>
transmissions, internal combustion engines, hydraulic control systems and all<br>
other hydraulic pump installations in which the drive speed to the pump is subject<br>
to relatively wide variation and a relatively constant pressure and flow rate output<br>
is desired.<br>
[0009] Thus it is an object of the present invention to provide a variable<br>
displacement vane pump.<br>
[0010] It is a further object of the present invention to provide a high<br>
efficiency variable displacement vane pump.<br>
[0011] It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a<br>
variable displacement vane pump having a plurality of axially extending inserts in<br>
the rotor.<br>
[0012] It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a<br>
variable displacement vane pump having a plurality of axially extending pockets<br>
in the rotor.<br>
[0013] It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a<br>
variable displacement vane pump having a plurality of axially extending inserts<br>
which are attached to the rotor by springs.<br><br>
[0014] It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a<br>
variable displacement vane pump exhibiting higher displacement at lower<br>
rotational speeds and lower displacement at higher rotational speeds.<br>
[0015] Further objects, advantages and areas of applicability will<br>
become apparent from the description provided herein. It should be understood<br>
that the description and specific examples are intended for purposes of<br>
illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0020] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br><br>
[0021] With reference now to Figures 1 and 2, an exemplary automatic<br>
transmission is illustrated and generally designated by the reference number 10.<br>
The automatic transmission 10 includes a housing 12 having various openings,<br>
surfaces, flanges and passageways that receive, locate and support the<br>
numerous components of the automatic transmission 10. Among these<br>
components are an input shaft 14 and an output shaft 16. Supplied with<br>
rotational energy from a component of the automatic transmission 10 is a<br>
variable displacement vane pump 20. As noted above, the automatic<br>
transmission 10 is but one application for a variable displacement vane pump 20<br>
according to the present invention. It has broad application and utility in<br>
installations and devices requiring a relatively constant pressure and flow output<br>
notwithstanding a relatively widely varying input speed.<br>
[0022] The variable displacement vane pump 20 includes a typically<br>
cylindrical pump housing 22 which defines an interior cylindrical cavity 24. The<br>
pump housing 22 defines an inlet port 26 which draws hydraulic fluid through a<br>
line or passageway 28 from a sump 32 in the lower portion of the transmission<br>
housing 12. The pump housing 22 also defines an outlet port 36 which supplies<br>
pressurized hydraulic fluid to a supply or feed line or passageway 38 and,<br>
optionally, a pressure regulator valve 42.<br>
[0023] Disposed on an axis offset from the axis of the interior<br>
cylindrical cavity 24, in accordance with conventional practice, is a pump rotor<br>
50. The pump rotor 50 is preferably cylindrical and includes a plurality of axially<br>
extending and radially oriented narrow slots 52 which freely slidably receive and<br><br>
retain a like plurality of vanes 54. The vanes 54 are maintained in close contact<br>
with the surface of the interior cylindrical cavity 24 by centrifugal force as the<br>
pump rotor 50 rotates.<br>
[0024] Disposed between each adjacent pair of vanes 54, is a wider,<br>
axially extending and radially oriented slot or pocket 56. Each of the wider slots<br>
or pockets 56 slidably receives a displacement reducing member or insert 60<br>
The members or inserts 60 are retained in the wider slots or pockets 56 by<br>
tension springs 62. Each of the members or inserts 60 is retained by at least two<br>
of the tension springs 62 although more, e.g., three or four, may be utilized if<br>
desired, to achieve improved radial stability. Additionally, although the radially<br>
inward limit of travel of the inserts or members 60 will typically be established by<br>
full compression of the tension springs 62, the radially inward and outward travel<br>
of the members or inserts 60 may be limited by stops 64 which may take the form<br>
of shoulders, pins, projections or other travel limiting features.<br>
[0025] In operation, a variable displacement vane pump 20 according<br>
to the present invention exhibits maximum displacement and thus maximum flow<br>
per rotation of the rotor 50 at low speeds. In the condition of maximum<br>
displacement, the members or inserts 60 are fully retracted within the slots or<br>
pockets 56 of the rotor 50. As the speed of the rotor 50 increases due to an<br>
increase in the operating speed of components of the automatic transmission 10,<br>
the members or inserts 60 translate radially outwardly relative to the rotor 50 and<br>
occupy increasing volume in the space between each pair of adjacent vanes 54,<br><br>
thereby reducing the displacement of the vane pump 20 and the pumped volume<br>
per rotation of the vane pump 20.<br>
[0026] Referring now to Figure 3, a portion of another embodiment of a<br>
variable displacement vane pump according to the present invention is illustrated<br>
and designated by the reference number 70. The variable displacement vane<br>
pump 70 includes the cylindrical pump housing 22 which defines an interior<br>
cylindrical cavity 24, the inlet port 26 and the outlet port 36 all of which are<br>
illustrated in Figure 2. The variable displacement vane pump 70 also includes a<br>
rotor 72 defining a plurality of axially extending and radially oriented slots 52<br>
which each receive a vane 54. Alternating with the plurality of slots 52 are a like<br>
plurality of channels or grooves 74 having axially extending mouths 76 that are<br>
defined by a opposed, symmetrical pair of overhanging lips or shoulders 78.<br>
Disposed in each of the channels or grooves 74 are T-shaped members or<br>
inserts 80. The T-shaped inserts 80 have a wider portion 82 defining first and<br>
second shoulders or flanges 84 just slightly smaller than the width of the<br>
channels or grooves 74 disposed more proximate the center of the rotor 72 and a<br>
narrower portion 86 just slightly smaller than the width of the axially extending<br>
mouths 76. On both sides of the T-shaped inserts 80 are compression springs<br>
88. The compression springs 88 may be coil springs in which case at least two<br>
will be used on each side of the T-shaped member 80 or more preferably be leaf<br>
springs or wave springs which extend axially along the shoulders or flanges 84.<br>
[0027] Thus it will be appreciated that as the rotational speed of the<br>
rotor 72 increases, centrifugal force will act on the T-shaped members or inserts<br><br>
80 and they will translate radially outwardly from their retracted positions in the<br>
rotor 72, reducing the displacement of the variable displacement vane pump 70.<br>
As the rotational speed of the rotor 72 decreases, the compression springs 88<br>
will overcome centrifugal force and the T-shaped members or inserts 80 will<br>
retract.<br>
[0028] It will also be appreciated that as the T-shaped members or<br>
inserts 80 extend and operate in the extended position for a period of time,<br>
hydraulic fluid will fill the channels or grooves 74 behind, i.e., radially inwardly<br>
from, the T-shaped members or inserts 80. As the rotor 72 slows, this<br>
accumulation of hydraulic fluid may slow retraction of the T-shaped members or<br>
inserts 80. To facilitate out flow of hydraulic fluid from the regions of the<br>
channels or grooves 74 behind the T-shaped members or inserts 80, one or<br>
more semi-circular, or other readily machined shape, channels or slots 90 are<br>
disposed across each of the channels or grooves 74 having a depth preferably<br>
equal to the depth of the channels or grooves 74. These channels or slots 90<br>
facilitate flow of hydraulic fluid both into and out from the region behind the T-<br>
shaped members or inserts 80.<br>
[0029] It will be appreciated that with both variable displacement vane<br>
pump embodiments 20 and 70, the precise speed to pumped flow relationship<br>
may be adjusted to suit particular flow requirements and flow to speed<br>
relationships. For example, it should be understood that higher spring rate<br>
tension springs 62 and compression springs 88 will shift the self-compensating<br>
nature of the present invention by requiring higher rotational speeds before<br><br>
displacement and flow reduction per rotation occur whereas lower spring rate<br>
tension springs 62 and compression springs 88 will cause the displacement and<br>
flow reduction per rotation to occur at lower rotational speeds.<br>
[0030] It should also be understood that any preload of the tension<br>
springs 62 and the compression springs 88 will raise the threshold rotational<br>
speed of the rotors 50 and 72, respectively, at which the members or inserts 60<br>
and 80 will commence movement and begin to reduce the displacement of the<br>
vane pumps 20 and 70. Accordingly, careful selection of the spring rate and the<br>
preload of the tension springs 62 and the compression springs 88 as well as the<br>
radial positions and the masses of the members or inserts 60 and 80 can result<br>
in vane pumps 20 and 70 that provide a flow and pressure output having good<br>
uniformity over a wide rotational speed range.<br>
[0031] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be,<br>
and are, within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be<br>
regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
