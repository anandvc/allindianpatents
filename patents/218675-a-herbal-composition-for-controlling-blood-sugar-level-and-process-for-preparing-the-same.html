				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a herbal composition for controlling blood sugar level,<br>
and process for its preparation. More particularly this invention pertains to an anti-diabetic<br>
composition based entirely on indigenously growing herbs and using specified amounts of such<br>
herbs and naturally occurring carbonaceous material which affords an effective control of the<br>
blood sugar level without any adverse side effects or contraindications, nor do they necessitate<br>
administration of medication in ever increasing dosages. The subject invention also provides a<br>
process for preparing such herbal composition for controlling blood sugar level in human<br>
systems.<br>
Normally benzenesulphonylurea group of compounds were being used for treating blood<br>
sugar. Well known brands like "Diabenese", "Rastinon", "Glyphos", etc. enjoyed approval of the<br>
physicians who had been prescribing such medications for people suffering from hyperglycemia.<br>
In point of fact, 'diabetes mellitus' was thought to be affecting only aged persons. This idea has<br>
now been changed, with the rise in the incidence of juvenile diabetes. Even infants are not<br>
spared; whenever there is lack of insulin secretion resulting in rise in blood sugar level, tell-tale<br>
signs appear. Regular monitoring of the blood sugar level and close adjustment of dosage of<br>
medicine are two important steps to keep diabetes under control. Any excess or negligence is<br>
counter-productive, often resulting in serious complications including, inter alia, malfunctioning<br>
of pancreas and liver. Administration of insulin through I.V. route no doubt is an effective means<br>
of combating this silent killer, but treating children with regular injections may prove difficult<br>
and, moreover, prolonged administration of insulin may necessitate use of increasing dosage and<br>
ultimately the system may grow resistance to insulin, - a condition often requiring dialysis and<br>
simultaneous use of blood-sugar lowering drugs.<br>
Considerable work is in progress and certain cyclic peptides have shown promise to act<br>
as a triggering agent for ensuring secretion of insulin which in turn will be able to remove sugar<br>
from blood stream. Another line of attack is to introduce stem-cell therapy gene therapy, both of<br>
which are nearly out of reach of suffering multitudes in a poor country like that of ours. A vast<br>
number of patients suffering from diabetes reside in villages and semi-urban areas, who do not<br>
have means to monitor the blood sugar level on a regular basis, nor such facilities are available in<br>
[2]<br><br>
far-flung areas. The poor victims eventually become crippled, or incapable of manual labour, -<br>
thus facing starvation and slow death.<br>
The present invention primarily aims at providing a herbal composition which is capable<br>
of effectively controlling blood sugar level, affording dual benefits, namely, (i) preventing<br>
fluctuations in blood sugar level, and (ii) guarding against the incidence of 'hypoglycemia' with<br>
consequent hypoglycemic shock which may prove fatal at times, particularly for patients with<br>
weaker constitution.<br>
The principal object of this invention is to provide a herbal composition for controlling<br>
blood sugar level in patients suffering from diabetes mellitus.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a composition prepared from indigenously<br>
growing herbs and a naturally occurring carbonaceous material (Shilajeet or Asphaltum) used in<br>
specified amounts.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a herbal composition which is capable<br>
of controlling blood sugar level and offers protection against general debility attended with<br>
hyperglycemia.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to provide a herbal composition which maintains<br>
the blood sugar level within safe limits and also guards against hypoglycemia.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide a process for preparing a herbal<br>
composition offering effective control over blood sugar level among patients suffering from<br>
diabetes.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to provide a process for preparing a herbal<br>
composition for controlling blood sugar level using simple, inexpensive technology.<br>
[3]<br><br>
The foregoing objects are achieved by the present invention which provides a herbal<br>
composition for controlling blood sugar level, comprising -<br>
Ingredients	Amount in % wt.<br>
(a)	Melia azadirachta (Neem bark)	17<br>
(b)	Syzygium cumini (Jamun or black berry)	17<br>
(c)	Terminalia arjuna (Arjuna)	17<br>
(d)	Cyperus rotundus (Nagar motha)	10<br>
(e)	Barberis aristala (Daruhaldi)	8.5<br>
(f)	Trigonella foneumgraeceum (Methi)	8.5<br>
(g)	(i) Terminalia chebula<br>
(ii) Terminalia belerica Triphala	17<br>
(iii) Emblica officinalis<br>
(h) Asphaltum (Shilajeet)	5<br>
In preparing the composition, plant parts selected from bark, root, rhizome, fruits and<br>
seed are used. As to asphaltum (Shilajeet), this is used in powdered form.<br>
From a scrutiny of the standard texts of Botany and Ayurvedic literature, the properties<br>
and physiological effects of individual ingredients have been gathered, which are given below in<br>
a tabular form:<br><br>
Sr.<br>
No.	Ingredients	Botanical Name<br>
reference	Part<br>
used	Use and action<br>
1.	Neem Bark	Melia azadirachta	Bark	Lowers increased blood sugar level in<br>
the body and rectifies blood also.<br>
2.	Jamun	Syzygium cumini	Bark	Effective ingredients for diabetes,<br>
useful for digestion as well.<br>
3.	Arjuna Bark	Terminalia arjuna	Bark	Reduces and checks blood sugar and<br>
maintains proper blood circulation to<br>
make heart and lungs tangible.<br>
[4]<br><br>
4.<br>
Nagar motha	Cyperus rotundus	Root	Provides units keeping organ clean,<br>
				fair removes gastric obstruction and<br>
				indigestion.<br>
5.	Daruhaldi	Barberis aristala	Rhizome	Provides good antibiotic activity and<br>
				purifies blood and control over<br>
				frequency of urine in diabetes, with<br>
				normal kidney function and stimulates<br>
				secretion of insulin.<br>
6.	Methi	Trigonella	Seed	Potential to control diabetes,<br>
		foneumgraeceum		demulcent tonic and carminative, also<br>
				useful for rheumatism, pancreas.<br>
7.	Triphala	Terminalia chebula	Full	Its prominent role for the liver,<br>
		Terminalia beleria		pancreas, intestine, digestion,<br>
		Emblica officinalis		purification of blood.<br>
8.	Shilajeet	Asphaltum	Full	Vital role in diabetes, gives strength to<br>
				all organs of the body as well as cells.<br>
On going through the foregoing properties of the individual ingredients, it will be<br>
apparent that some of them are capable of lowering blood sugar level, but not maintaining them<br>
within safe limits and preventing general debility, which is an aftermath of hyperglycemia. The<br>
subject composition has been able to achieve the surprising result of simultaneously controlling<br>
blood sugar level and restoring health and vigour to the people afflicted with diabetes mellitus.<br>
Moreover, presence of Arjuna and Daruhaldi serves as source of anti-oxidants which play a<br>
beneficial role in accentuating blood circulation and proper heart-functioning.<br>
The present invention also pertains to a process for making the aforementioned herbal<br>
composition which comprises -<br>
(i) breaking the ,barks, roots, seeds, rhizomes and fruits including asphaltum<br>
(Shilajeet) into the small pieces and then powdering them separately in a grinder;<br>
[5]<br><br>
(ii) reducing particle size of the ground objects in a hammer mill to a level of around<br>
20 mesh size;<br>
(iii) mixing the individual ingredients in predetermined amounts in a stainless steel<br>
mixing machine to obtain a homogeneous mixture, and<br>
(iv) filing the powdery mass obtained from step (iii) in suitable glass or polymeric<br>
containers.<br>
The composition thus produced if taken 5-10 gm twice a day, or as directed by the<br>
attending physicians, will show the controlling effect in no time, and it shows no adverse side<br>
effects or contraindications even on prolonged administration.<br>
The advantages of the present invention may be summarized as under :-<br>
(i) The composition is formulated from herbs and ingredients which are available<br>
indigenously.<br>
(ii) The composition is storage stable and does not show any contraindication even<br>
after prolonged administration.<br>
(iii) The mode of preparation uses simple machinery which may be easily fabricated<br>
from raw materials available in open market involving no complicated procedure.<br>
(iv) Simple steps of pulverizing, grinding, mixing and filling into receptacles make the<br>
process and invention extremely cost effective.<br>
While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to the specific<br>
embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and<br>
modifications can be made therein without deviating or departing from the spirit and scope of the<br>
invention. Thus the disclosure contained herein includes within its ambit the obvious equivalents<br>
and substitutes as well.<br>
Having described the invention in detail with particular reference to the illustrative<br>
examples given above, it will now be more specifically by the claims appended hereafter.<br>
