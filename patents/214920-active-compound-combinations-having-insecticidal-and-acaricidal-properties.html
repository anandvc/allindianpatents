COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"ACTIVE     COMPOUND     COMBINATIONS     HAVING     INSECTICIDAL     AND ACARICIDAL PROPERTIES"<br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a body corporate organised, under the laws of Germany, of D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
7-8-2007<br><br>
The present invention relates to novel active compound combinations comprising known cyclic ketoenols on the one hand and other known insecticidally active compounds on the other hand and which are highly suitable for controlling animal pests such as insects and undesired acarids.<br>
It is already known that certain cyclic ketoenols have insecticidal and acaricidal properties (EP-A-528 156). WO 95/01971, EP-A-647 637, WO 96/16061, WO 96/20196, WO 96/25395, WO 96/35664, WO 97/02243, WO 97/01535, WO 97/36868, WO 97/43275, WO 98/05638, WO 98/06721, WO 99/16748, WO 99/43649, WO 99/48869 and WO 99/55673 describe further ketoenols having insecticidal and acaricidal properties. The activity of these substances is good; however, at low application rates it is sometimes unsatisfactory.<br>
Furthermore, it is already known that numerous phosphoric esters, carbamates, heterocycles, organotin compounds, benzoylureas and pyrethroids have insecticidal and acaricidal properties (cf. US 2,758,115, US 3,309,266, EP-A-004 334, GB-A-1 181 657, WO-93-22 297, WO 93-10 083, DE-A 2 641 343, EP-A-347 488, EP-A-210 487, US-A 3 264 177 and EP-A-234 045). However, the activity of these substances is not always satisfactory.<br>

Surprisingly, the insecticidal and acaricidal action of the active compound combinations according to the invention considerably exceeds the total of the actions of the individual active compounds. A true synergistic effect which could not have been predicted exists, not just a complementation of action.<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention comprise, in addition to at least one active compound of the formula (I), at least one active compound of compounds 1 to 43.<br>
Preference is given to active compound combinations comprising compounds of the formula (I)<br>

In addition, the active compound combinations may also comprise other fungicidally, acaricidally or insecticidally active components which may be admixed.<br>
If the active compounds are present in the active compound combinations according<br>
to the invention in certain weight ratios, the synergistic effect is particularly<br>
pronounced. However, the "weight ratios of the active compounds in the active<br>

combinations according  to the invention comprise active compounds of the formula (I) and the co-components in the preferred and particularly preferred mixing ratios indicated in the table below:<br><br>

15	All plants and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. Plants are<br>
to be understood as meaning in the present context all plants and plant populations such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (inclusive of naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional plant breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and recombinant methods or by combinations of these methods, inclusive of the transgenic plants and inclusive of the plant varieties protectable or not protectable by plant breeders' rights, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits, seeds, roots, tubers and rhizomes. The plant parts also include harvested material, and<br>
25	vegetative  and  generative  propagation   material,  for  example  cuttings,  tubers,<br>
rhizomes, offsets and seeds.<br>
Treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the active<br>
compounds is carried out directly or by allowing the compounds to act on the<br>
30	surroundings, environment or storage space by the customary treatment methods, for<br>
example by immersion, spraying, evaporation, fogging, scattering, painting on and, in<br><br><br>
Le A 34 358-Foreign Countries<br>
the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seed, also by applying one or more coats.<br>
The good insecticidal and acaricidal action of the active compound combinations according to the invention can be seen from the examples which follow. While the individual active compounds show weaknesses in their action, the combinations show an action which exceeds a simple sum of actions.<br>
A synergistic effect in insecticides and acaricides is always present when the action<br>
l0	of the active compound combinations exceeds the total of the actions of the active<br>
compounds when applied individually.<br>
The expected action for a given combination of two active compounds can be calculated as follows, using the formula of S.R. Colby, Weeds JL5 (1967), 20-22:<br>
15<br>
If<br>
X        is the efficacy, expressed as % of the untreated control, when employing<br>
active compound A at an application rate of m g/ha or in a concentration of m<br>
20	ppm,<br>
Y is the efficacy, expressed as % of the untreated control, when employing active compound B at an application rate of n g/ha or in a concentration of n ppm and<br>
E is the efficacy, expressed as % of the untreated control, when employing active compounds A and B at application rates of m and ng/ha or in a concentration of m and n ppm,<br>
30	then<br>
39<br><br>
E=X + Y-<br><br>
XY 100<br><br>
If the actual insecticidal kill rate exceeds the calculated value, the action of the combination is superadditive, i.e. a synergistic effect is present. In this case, the actually observed insecticidal kill rate must exceed the value calculated using the above formula for the expected insecticidal kill rate (E).<br>

Use Example<br>
Tetranychus test (OP-resistant/spray treatment)<br>
»5	Solvent:	3 parts by weight of dimethylformamide<br>
I	Emulsifier:	1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether<br>
/	To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active<br>
compound is mixed with the stated amounts of solvent and emulsifier, and the<br>
10	concentrate is diluted with emulsifier-containing water to the desired concentration.<br>
Bean plants (Phaseolus vulgaris) which are heavily infested with all stages of the common spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) are sprayed with a preparation of active compound of the desired concentration. 15<br>
After the desired period of time, the effect in % is determined. 100% means that all spider mites have been killed; 0% means that none of the spider mites have been killed. The kill rates determined are calculated using Colby's formula.<br>
20	In this test, for example, the following active compound combinations in accordance<br>
with the present application exhibit a synergistically enhanced activity compared to the active compounds applied individually.<br><br>
