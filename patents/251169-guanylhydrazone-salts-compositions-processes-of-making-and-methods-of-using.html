Background of the Technology<br>
15	Solubility in solution, either for a drug compound with a recognized<br>
activity or for a drug candidate compound, is almost always required before the<br>
compound can be analyzed or significant bioavailability achieved. Solubility in<br>
water or some aqueous or neutral solution is desirable as high solubility eases<br>
molecular pharmacology screening as well as biodistribution.<br>
20	In vitro studies involving such aspects as receptor binding, enzyme<br>
inhibition, and cell cultures and studies with isolated organs are all facilitated when the compound is made soluble in H20 or other neutral media.  When testing highly water insoluble material for in vitro assays, the common procedure to attain water solubility is to prepare a solution using an organic solvent (DMSO, polyethylene<br>
-3-<br><br>
WO 2006/004613	PCT/US2005/022626<br>
glycol, EtOH, etc.) and then proceed to various aqueous dilutions. In following<br>
this regimen, there is always the possibility that the compound will precipitate out<br>
during a dilution. Furthermore, any precipitation may not be properly considered if<br>
it is not noticeable or the precipitate easily adheres to the wall of the testing vessel.<br>
5	Most organic acids or bases are only poorly soluble in water, whereas many<br>
corresponding salts render the drug substance ionized in H20 and hence made water soluble. Salts that are soluble in water are also ideally suited for the preparation of injectable sterile aqueous solutions. Also, fast dissolution of the active principle contained in solid dosage forms, such as for quick release tablets<br>
10        or hard-gelatine capsules will rely on the aqueous solubility of the drug.<br>
When considering in vivo testing, solubility in H20 facilitates all studies in which parenteral administration is required. In pharmacokinetics, a reliable determination of absolute bioavailability via oral administration is needed before a comparison is possible with an amount administered intravenously because a dose<br>
15        entering the system by the parenteral route is a precisely known reference. Aqueous solubility is particularly important in toxicity studies wherein the digestibility of a compound in an animal will leave uncertainty as to whether an insoluble compound is either toxic or just incompletely absorbed.<br>
On a therapeutic level, the major concern for finding a water-soluble drug<br>
20        resides in the possibility this solubility provides for intravenous administration. The water solubility of a drug is particularly important in drugs for emergency treatments that will permit therapeutic plasma levels to be reached in a very short period of time. Intravenous administration is often the only access available when a patient is otherwise incapacitated in an operation or some emergency situation.<br><br>
WO 2006/004613	PCTYUS2005/022626<br>
Also, water solubility is needed for several types of pharmaceutical dosage formats.<br>
Apart from parenteral injection or infusion, water solubility is important for<br>
producing aqueous drops for ocular or nasal administration, or aqueous syrup for<br>
oral administration.<br>
5	For oral consumption of a drug compound, the significance of water<br>
solubility to pharmacokinetics cannot be underestimated. This is particularly so when the absorption step for the compound is preceded by a dissolution step of the orally ingested dosage format The in-vivo dissolution step is often the rate determining step for drug absorption.  Also, highly water-soluble drugs are, by the<br>
10	fact itself, less toxic than lower water-soluble drugs due to their facilitated renal<br>
clearance. They will have a lesser tendency to accumulate in an organism thus avoiding overload to the liver.<br>
Complex guanylhydrazones have been reported in the patent literature above. For instance, U.S. Patent No. 5,599,984 to Bianchi et al. listed above<br>
15        discloses hydrochloride salts of complex guanylhydrazone compounds with some degree of water solubility. However, the high acidity associated with some hydrochloride salts, upon dissociation, can cause cellular damage and is a recognized source of phlebitis. Stranz et al.. Int. J. Pharm. Compounding (2002), v.6, n.3, pp.216-220. Thus, mere is a need in the art to develop salts of<br>
20        guanylhydrazone compounds, and in particular salts of complex guanylhydrazone compounds, having both high water solubility and lower probability of cellular insult due to the acidity of the salt upon dissociation in solution.<br>

15	DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has been found that certain select acids form salts with guanylhydrazone compounds producing guanylhydrazone salts haying a number of advantages over known salts of guanylhydrazone compounds. These guanylhydrazone salts have been found to have an unexpectedly superior combination of formulation and 20        solubility advantages which make them particularly suitable for the preparation of pharmaceutical formulations containing guanylhydrazone-containing drugs.<br>
Thus, according to the present invention, there are provided improved salts of guanylhydrazone containing compounds. In a preferred embodiment, the inventive salts relate to salts of complex guanylhydrazone compounds (i.e.,<br>
-2-8-<br><br>
WO 2006/004613	PCT/US2005/022626<br>
compounds that contain multiple guanylhydrazone moieties). In a most preferred embodiment, the complex guanylhydrazone compound is Semapimod:<br><br>
The Semapimod compound (sometimes referred to herein as CNI-1493 is 5        identified as Compound No. 14 in U.S. Patent No. 5,599,984 to Bianchi et al.. the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The invention also relates to alternative pharmaceutical dosage formats involving the guanylhydrazone salts of the invention. The alternative formats include, for example, hard gelatin capsules or quick release tablets for oral 10        consumption, compositions for topical application, or various solutions for<br>
parenteral injection (including, but not limited to subcutaneous and intramuscular)<br>
or infusion. In addition, the guanylhydrazone salts of the invention provide<br>
improved storage capabilities for the active agent compound in an improved stable<br>
format.<br>
15	Other aspects of the invention relate to methods of making the<br>
guanylhydrazone salts according to the invention.<br>
Other aspects of the invention relate to methods of using the inventive guanylhydrazone salts in various applications such as screening assays, efficacy and safety tests, and in therapies or treatments. These methods of use involve,<br>
-^<br><br>
WO 2006/004613	PCT/US2005/022626<br>
among other things, in vitro testing and in vivo testing. The inventive guanylhydrazone salts can also be used in therapeutic methods for which a guanylhydrazone compound has previously been identified as effective as the active agent, but which heretofore have not been identified in an improved salt 5        form for enhanced delivery and bioavailability.<br>

5	In addition the invention provides a capsule formulation comprising the<br>
carboxylic acid salt of the guanylhydrazone compound in an admixture with excipients. A preferred formulation includes the salt, an inert diluent, a dried disintegrant and a lubricant as described above.<br>
The invention further provides the carboxylic acid salt of the<br>
10	guanylhydrazone compound in sterile aqueous solution for parenteral<br>
administration. Preferably such solution contains from 10 to 40% by volume of propylene glycol and preferably also sufficient sodium chloride to avoid haemolysis, e.g. about 1% w/v. The invention also provides the carboxylic acid salt of the guanylhydrazone compound for use in treating diseases and conditions<br>
15	as described in the patents and patent application publications listed above.<br>
The guanylhydrazone compounds and certain carboxylic acids in combination thereof in the present invention can exist in several tautomeric forms, and geometric isomers and mixtures thereof. All such tautomeric forms are included within the scope of the present invention. Tautomers exist as mixtures of<br>
20        tautomers in solution. In solid form, usually one tautomer predominates. Even<br>
though one tautomer may be described, the present invention includes all tautomers of the present compounds.<br>
The salt structures formed can be in either mono, di, tri, tetra or other salt structures and combinations thereof. The present invention also includes<br><br>
WO 2006/004613	PCT/TJS2005/022626<br>
atropisomers of the present invention. Atropisomers refer to compounds of the invention that can be separated into rotationally restricted isomers. The compounds of this invention may contain olefin-like double bonds. When such bonds are present, the compounds of the invention exist as cis and trans 5        configurations and as mixtures thereof.<br>
The present invention also includes isotopically-labeled acid compounds, which are identical to those recited above, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that<br>
10        can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine and chlorine, such as 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 180,170,31P, 32P, 35S, 18F, and 36C1, respectively. Compounds of the present invention, prodrugs thereof, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds or of said prodrugs which contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or<br>
15	other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain<br>
isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H and 14C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated, i.e., 3H, and carbon-14, i.e., 14C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and<br>
20        detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, would be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by<br><br>

The free base forms may be regenerated by treating the salt with a suitable dilute aqueous base solution such as dilute aqueous sodium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, ammonia and sodium bicarbonate. The free base forms differ from their<br>
10        corresponding salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but the salts are otherwise equivalent to their corresponding free base forms for purposes of this invention.<br>
The salts cam be administered in combination with one or more substantially nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, adjuvants<br>
15        or diluents. The compositions of the present invention may be prepared in any conventional solid or liquid carrier or diluent and optionally any conventional pharmaceutically-made adjuvant at suitable dosage level in a known way. The preferred preparations are in administrable form which is suitable for oral application. These administrable forms, for example, include pills, tablets, film<br>
20	tablets, coated tablets, capsules, powders and deposits.<br>
Forms other than orally administrable forms are also possible. The compounds of the present invention and/or pharmaceutical preparations containing said compounds may be administered by any appropriate means, including but not limited to injection (intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, subcutaneous) by<br>

10	The term "treating" as used herein refers to reversing, alleviating, inhibiting<br>
the progress of, or preventing the disorder or condition to which the term applies, or one or more symptoms of the disorder or condition. The term "treatment" as used herein refers to the act of treating as the term is defined above.<br>
The compound of the present invention may exist in any convenient<br>
15        crystalline, semicrystalline, or amorphous form. These may be achieved via typical crystallization routes including vacuum crystallization or spray drying. Depending on the solublity desired, the amorphous form obtained by, e.g., spray-drying may be preferred. The spray drying may be carried out from aqueous, ethanolic, organic, or mixed aqueous ethanolic solutions of the salt or a mixture of the salt<br>
20	and the free base compound. The compound and/or salt may exist in a form<br>
comprising one or more waters of hydration.<br>
The guanylhydrazone compound is suitably administered in the form of a salt of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid. The pharmaceutically acceptable salt desirably satisfies one or more of the following physiochemical criteria: (1) good<br>
-73-<br><br>
WO 2006/004613	PCT/US2005/022626<br>
solubility; (2) good stability; (3) non-hydroseopicity; (4) processability for oral, parenteral, or topical formulations, etc. A range of pharmaceutically acceptable guanylhydrazone salts have been made and evaluated using these criteria. The present salts desirably have good aqueous solubility and good 5        bioavailability. Usually a solubility of greater than 1 mg/mL at pH 1-7.5 is sought although higher solubilities are required to formulate injections. In addition, salts which provide solutions having a pH close to that of blood (7.4) are preferred because they are readily biocompatible and can easily be buffered to the required pH range without altering their solubility. The L-lactate salt of Semapimod<br>
10        exhibits very good solubility.<br>
Good stability in the solid state is desirable for tablets and capsules, while good stability in solution is required for an aqueous injection. In the case of tablets the vehicle can be comprised of, for instance, microcrystalline cellulose in 50:50 combination with anhydrous dibasic calcium phosphate. In the case of capsules the<br>
15	vehicles can be comprised of, for instance, mannitol in 4:1 combination with dried<br>
maize starch. In order to provide stable formulations it is desirable to have a non-hygroscopic salt. In the solid state where drug content is high, absorbed films of moisture can act as a vector for hydrolysis and chemical breakdown. It is the hygroscopic nature of a drug or its salt which contributes to the free moisture<br>
20        which is normally responsible for instability.<br>
The present salts are desirably easily processed, i.e. they have good compression properties and also the ability not to stick or adhere to the tablet making machinery. For high dose formulations, good compressibility is desirable in terms of making elegant tablets. With lower dose tablets the need for good<br>
-vt-<br><br>
WO 2006/004613	PCT/US2005/022626<br>
compressibility can be eliminated to a certain extent by the use of suitable diluting excipients called compression aids.  Microcrystalline cellulose is a commonly used compression aid.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
5	In order that the present invention be more readily understood, reference is<br>
now made to the following Examples, which are not intended to be limiting unless otherwise indicated. EXAMPLE 1 Procedure for Semapimod free base preparation:<br>
10	An AG1-X8 resin from Bio-Rad (20-50 mesh, hydroxide form, 20 g) was<br>
swished in 100 mL of 1N NaOH solution at room temp, for about 5 minutes, and was filtered. The resin was then rinsed with 100 mL of H20, followed by 200 mL of MeOH. The resin was then added to 50 mL of a MeOH solution containing 2 g of the Semapimod-4 HC1 salt. The mixture was then stirred at room temp, for 60<br>
15        min, and then filtered.<br>
The resin was rinsed with about 50 mL of MeOH. The combined filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to afford 1.72 g of a light yellow solid. HPLC analysis of the product showed 98.9% purity. The product prepared from the same procedure was subjected to elemental analysis, and the results showed a<br>
20        closer match to Semapimod-4 H20. 'H NMR of the product showed the same<br>
pattern of spectrum as the starting material, but with the signals from the methyl group and the aromatic hydrogen slightly shifted up-field. Recovery from this process was usually more than 95%. EXAMPLE 2<br>

The product isolated as Semapimod-2 HC1/4 H20 was added to ca. 2 mL of<br>
solvents (H20,5% Dextrose solution, PBS, and 0.9% NaCl solution), and was<br>
sonicated at room temperature until the solid suspended in the solution. The 5        mixture was passed through a Nylon syringe filter, and then 0.5 mL of the filtrate<br>
was diluted with MeOH before injection into the HPLC. The concentration of<br>
Semapimod-2 HCl/ 4 H20 in the filtrate was calculated by comparing the results<br>
with a standard solution prepared from Semapimod-4 HCl/ 4 H20. For reference<br>
purpose, the solubility of Semapimod-4 HCl/ 4 H20 was determined according to 10        the previous procedure.<br>
The solubility of Semapimod-2 HC1/4 H20 was examined and is listed<br>
