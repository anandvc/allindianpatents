DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS<br>
For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention,<br>
reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings and specific<br>
language will be used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no<br>
limitation of the scope of the invention is hereby intended, such alterations and further<br>
modifications in the illustrated devices, and such further applications of the principles of<br>
the invention as illustrated herein being contemplated as would normally occur to one<br>
skilled in the art to which the invention relates.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, shown therein is a bone anchor 10 according to one form of<br>
the present invention. The bone anchor 10 is generally comprised of a bone engaging<br>
portion 12 and an elongate guiding portion 14. As will be discussed in further detail<br>
below, the bone engaging portion 12 is adapted for anchoring to bone. In one<br>
embodiment, the bone engaging portion 12 is adapted for anchoring to vertebral bone.<br>
However, it should be understood that the bone anchor 10 may be used in association with<br>
other skeletal members and in anatomical areas outside of the spinal column. The<br>
elongate guiding portion 14 extends from the bone engaging portion 12 and is adapted to<br>
guide or deliver various devices, materials, instruments, implants and/or other elements to<br>
the bone engaging portion 12. In one embodiment of the invention, the elongate guiding<br>
portion 14 is configured to releasably engage the bone engaging portion 12 so as to allow<br>
selective removal therefrom, the details of which will be discussed below.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the bono engaging portion 12 comprises a<br>
bone screw extending generally along a longitudinal axis L between a distal end portion<br>
12a and a proximal end portion 12b. The bone screw 12 generally includes a threaded<br><br>
shank portion 20 and a proximal head portion 22. However, it should be understood that<br>
the bone engaging portion 12 may take on other configurations, including non-threaded<br>
configurations, such as, for example, a hook configuration or any other configuration<br>
suitable for anchoring to bone as would occur to one of skill in the art. The threaded<br>
shank portion 20 defines external threads 24 configured to engage internal threads formed<br>
along a passage in the bone. In one embodiment, the threads 24 are cancellous threads<br>
configured to engage vertebral bone. However, it should be understood that other types<br>
and configurations of threads are also contemplated as falling within the scope of the<br>
present invention. The distal end of the threaded shank 20 may define one or more cutting<br>
flutes 26 extending across at least one of the threads 24 to provide the bone anchor 10 with<br>
self-tapping and/or self-cutting capabilities. The proximal head 22 preferably has a<br>
generally smooth outer surface that is devoid of sharp corners or edges to avoid trauma or<br>
irritation of adjacent tissue. In one embodiment, the proximal head 22 has a spherical-<br>
shaped configuration. However, other configurations are also contemplated, such as, for<br>
example, a conical or cylindrical configuration. The outer surface of the proximal head 22<br>
may include a number of flattened areas (FIG. 1) for engagement with a driving tool.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, in one embodiment of the invention, the bone engaging<br>
portion 12 of the bone anchor 10 defines a cannula passage 30 extending generally along<br>
the longitudinal axis L. Although the cannula passage 30 is illustrated as extending<br>
partially through the bone engaging portion 12 so as to define a partially-cannulated bone<br>
screw, it should be understood that in other embodiments of the invention, the cannula<br>
passage 30 may extend entirely through the bone engaging portion 12 so as to define a<br>
fully-cannulated bone screw.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the bone engaging portion 12 of the bone<br>
anchor 10 defines a number of fenestration openings 32 extending through the side wall of<br>
the bone engaging portion in a transverse direction and in communication with the axial<br>
cannula passage 30. In one embodiment of the invention, the transverse fenestration<br>
openings 32 are confined to the distal end portion 12a of the bone engaging portion 12,<br>
and in a more specific embodiment are disposed along the distal-most one-third of the<br>
bone engaging portion 12. However, it should be understood that in other embodiments<br>
of the invention, the fenestration openings 32 may be disposed along other portions of the<br><br>
bone engaging portion 12, including along the proximal portion 12b or along the entire<br>
length of the bone engaging portion 12.<br>
As will be discussed in further detail below, the cannula passage 30 and the<br>
transverse fenestration openings 32 cooperate to deliver a material to select regions of the<br>
bone in which the bone engaging portion 12 is engaged. Such materials may include, for<br>
example, bone cement, a bone growth promoting material such as a bone morphogenic<br>
protein (BMP), or other bio-compatible materials. In embodiments of the invention<br>
utilizing a partially-cannulated bone screw, the entire amount of the material is delivered<br>
into the cannula passage 30 and out the transverse fenestration openings 32 in a lateral<br>
direction, with no material being discharged from the distal end of the bone engaging<br>
portion 12 in an axial direction. As a result, delivery of the material to select portions of<br>
the bone can be accomplished in a controlled and efficient manner, the details of which<br>
will be discussed below.<br>
The proximal head 22 of the bone engaging portion 12 includes a shaped passage<br>
or recess 40 communicating with the cannula passage 30. The shaped recess 40 is<br>
configured to receive a shaped end portion of the elongate guiding portion 14 therein to<br>
couple the elongate guiding portion 14 with the bone engaging portion 12, the details of<br>
which will be discussed below. However, it should be understood that in an alternative<br>
embodiment of the invention, the proximal head 22 may comprise a shaped end portion<br>
that is receivable within a shaped passage or recess defined in the elongate guiding portion<br>
14 to couple the elongate guiding portion 14 with the bone engaging portion 12.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the shaped recess 40 defined in the proximal<br>
head 22 includes a connecting portion 42, a receiving portion 44, and a retaining portion<br>
46 disposed between the connecting portion 42 and the receiving portion 44. In a specific<br>
embodiment, the connecting portion 42 comprises a spherical-shaped socket sized to<br>
engagingly receive a correspondingly shaped end portion of the guiding portion 14 therein<br>
to connect the guiding portion 14 to the bone engaging portion 12. In another specific<br>
embodiment, the receiving portion 44 comprises an axially-extending receptacle or<br>
opening sized to engagingly receive a corresponding end portion of an instrument,<br>
implant, mechanism, and/or other types of elements therein. The receiving portion 44 may<br>
take on a number of different shapes and configurations, including a hexagonal shape, a<br>
circular or elliptical shape, a square or rectangular shape, a Torx™-type configuration, or<br><br>
any other shape or configuration that would occur to one of skill in the art. In a further<br>
specific embodiment, the retention portion 46 comprises an annular shoulder extending<br>
between the socket 42 and the receptacle 44. The retention portion 46 defines an inner<br>
diameter sized somewhat smaller than the spherical-shaped socket 42 to retain a<br>
corresponding end portion of the guiding portion 14 therein. It should be understood,<br>
however, that other shapes, sizes and/or configurations of the connecting portion 42,<br>
receiving portion 44, and retaining portion 46 are also contemplated as falling within the<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the elongate guiding portion 14 comprises a<br>
shaped end portion 50 and an elongate shaft portion 52 extending therefrom. In a specific<br>
embodiment, the shaped end portion 50 has a ball or spherical-shaped configuration<br>
corresponding to the size and shape of the spherical-shaped socket 42 defined by the<br>
shaped recess 40 in the proximal head 22 of the bone engaging portion 12. In a specific<br>
embodiment, the spherical shaped ball 50 has an outer diameter sized in close tolerance<br>
with the inner diameter of the spherical-shaped socket 42 so as to provide a relatively<br>
close fit therebetween while still allowing the ball 50 to freely rotate within the socket 42.<br>
Although the shaped recess 42 and the shaped end portion 50 are illustrated and described<br>
as having spherical configurations, it should be understood that other shapes and<br>
configurations are also contemplated as falling within the scope of the present invention,<br>
examples of which will be illustrated and described below.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the shaped end portion 50 is engagingly<br>
received within the shaped recess 42 in a manner allowing selective removal of the<br>
elongate guiding portion 14 from the bone engaging portion 12. In one embodiment, the<br>
annular shoulder 46 positioned adjacent the spherical-shaped socket 42 has an inner<br>
diameter sized somewhat smaller than the outer diameter of the spherical-shaped ball<br>
portion 50. As a result, the annular shoulder 46 serves to selectively retain the ball portion<br>
50 within the socket 42, which in turn selectively engages the elongate guiding portion 14<br>
with the bone engaging portion 12. Since the annular shoulder 46 is sized somewhat<br>
smaller than the ball portion 50, in one embodiment of the invention, the ball portion 50 is<br>
press fit into the socket 42. As a result, the annular shoulder 46 and/or the ball portion 50<br>
are slightly deformed during insertion and removal of the ball portion 50 into/from the<br>
socket 42.<br><br>
Referring specifically to FIG. 3, in the illustrated embodiment of the invention, the<br>
ball portion 50 is engaged within the socket 42 so as to allow angular displacement of the<br>
elongate guiding portion 14 relative to the bone engaging portion 12 up to a displacement<br>
angle θ (as measured relative to the longitudinal axis L). In one embodiment, the ball<br>
portion 50 and the socket 42 cooperate to provide the bone anchor 10 with multi-axial<br>
capabilities, allowing angular displacement of the elongate guiding portion 14 in multiple<br>
directions relative to the bone engaging portion 12 up to the displacement angle 9. In a<br>
specific embodiment of the invention, the displacement angle 9 falls within a range of<br>
about 5 degrees to about 30 degrees. However, it should be understood that other<br>
displacement angles 9 are also contemplated as falling within the scope of the present<br>
invention. It should also be understood that the ball portion 50 and the socket 42 may<br>
cooperate to limit or prohibit angular displacement of the elongate guiding portion 14<br>
lelative to the bone engaging portion 12 in one or more directions.<br>
The elongate shaft portion 52 extends from the ball portion 50 and is adapted to<br>
guide or direct various devices, instruments, implants and/or other elements toward the<br>
proximal bead 22 of the bone engaging portion 12, the details of which will be discussed<br>
below. In one embodiment of the invention, the elongate shaft portion 52 is flexible so as<br>
to allow the elongate shaft portion 52 to be reshaped or bent either before or during<br>
displacement of the devices, instruments, implants and/or other elements toward the<br>
proximal head 22 of the bone engaging portion 12. However, it should be understood that<br>
the elongate shaft portion 52 may alternatively have a substantially rigid configuration so<br>
as to prevent or resist deflection of the elongate shaft portion 52 during displacement of<br>
the devices, instruments, implants and/or other elements toward the proximal head 22 of<br>
the bone engaging portion 12.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the elongate shaft portion 52 is at least<br>
partially formed of a flexible, malleable or pliable material to allow for reshaping or<br>
bending. Such material may include, for example, an aluminum material, a shape-memory<br>
material, a plastic material, or certain types of stainless steel or titanium. If a relatively<br>
soft material is used, such as an aluminum material, the elongate shaft portion 52 may be<br>
covered with a protective coating such as an anodized oxide film or one or more layers of<br>
an elastomeric polymer such as Teflon. In another embodiment of the invention, the<br>
elongate shaft portion 52 is formed of a substantially rigid or non-malleable material, such<br><br>
as, for example, stainless steel or titanium. The use of a rigid material allows the elongate<br>
shaft portion 52 to maintain a predetermined shape or configuration.<br>
If the elongate shaft portion 52 is at least partially formed of a shape-memory alloy<br>
(SMA), the elongate shaft portion 52 may be bent or reshaped from an initial configuration<br>
to a different configuration and automatically reformed back toward the initial<br>
configuration without having to manually bend the elongate shaft portion 52 back toward<br>
its initial configuration. This shape-memory characteristic occurs when the SMA is<br>
transformed from a martensitic crystal phase to an austcnitic crystal phase. This phase<br>
transformation can occur with or without a corresponding change in temperature. Further<br>
details regarding the features and characteristics of SMA materials are more fully<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 5,551,871 to Besselink and in U.S. Patent No. 5,597,378 to<br>
Jervis, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 3, in a further embodiment of the invention, an axial<br>
passageway 54 extends along the elongate shaft portion 52 and through the shaped end<br>
portion 50, thereby defining a fully-cannulated elongate guiding portion 14. However, it<br>
should be understood that the shaped end portion 50 and the elongate shaft portion 52 need<br>
not necessarily define an axial passageway 54, but may instead define a solid, non-<br>
cannulated elongate guiding portion 14. When the ball portion 50 of the elongate guiding<br>
portion 14 is disposed within the shaped recess 40 of the bone engaging portion 12, the<br>
axial passageway 54 is disposed in fluid communication with the cannula passage 30. In<br>
this manner, various materials may be delivered through the axial passageway 54 from a<br>
location remote from the bone engaging portion 12 and into the cannula passage 30 for<br>
distribution to the transverse fenestration openings 32. As discussed above, such materials<br>
may include bone cement or a bone growth promoting material such as BMP.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 4 and 5, shown therein are two specific applications of the bone<br>
anchor 10. However, it should be understood that the applications illustrated in FIGS. 4<br>
and 5 are exemplary and that other applications and uses of the bone anchor 10 are also<br>
contemplated as falling within the scope of the present invention. In the illustrated<br>
embodiments of the invention, the bone engaging portion 12 of the bone anchor 10 is<br>
anchored to the vertebra V with the elongate guiding portion 14 extending from the<br>
proximal head 22. As mentioned above, the distal end portion of the threaded shank 20<br>
may define one or more cutting flutes 26 to provide the bone engaging portion 12 with<br><br>
self-tapping and/or self-cutting capabilities to facilitate insertion of the bone engaging<br>
portion 12 into the vertebra V.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the elongate shaft 52 has a length such that at<br>
least the proximal end portion of the elongate shaft 52 extends outside of the patient's<br>
body when the bone engaging portion 12 is anchored to bone, such as, for example, to the<br>
vertebra V. As a result, various types of devices, instruments, implants and/or other<br>
elements may be advanced along the elongate shaft 52 from a location outside of the<br>
patient's body to a location adjacent the proximal head 22 of the bone engaging portion<br>
12. In some embodiments of the invention, such devices, instruments, implants and/or<br>
other elements are slidingly advanced along the length of the elongate shaft 52 toward the<br>
bone engaging portion 12. However, other methods of advancement along the length of<br>
the elongate shaft 52 are also contemplated as falling within the scope of the present<br>
invention. Following the positioning, delivery and/or use of the device, instrument,<br>
implant and/or other elements adjacent the proximal head 22 of the bone anchor 10, the<br>
elongate guiding portion 14 may be selectively removed from the bone engaging portion<br>
12 to provide a low profile anchoring structure.<br>
Referring specifically to FIG. 4, in one embodiment of the invention, the elongate<br>
shaft 52 of the guiding portion 14 is sized and configured to slidably engage a surgical<br>
instrument 90 to guide the distal end portion of the instrument 90 into engagement with<br>
the proximal head 22 of the bone engaging portion 12. In the illustrated embodiment, the<br>
surgical instrument 90 is configured as a driver instrument generally comprised of a shaft<br>
92 and a handle 94. However, it should be understood that other types and configurations<br>
of instruments may be used in association with the present invention. The shaft 92 defines<br>
an axial passage 95 extending at least partially therethrough and sized to receive the<br>
elongate shaft 52 of me guiding portion 14 therein.<br>
The distal end portion 96 of the shaft 92 is preferably sized and configured for<br>
engagement within the receiving portion 44 defined by the proximal head 22 of the bone<br>
anchor 10 to facilitate driving of the bone engaging portion 12 into and/or out of bone. As<br>
mentioned above, the receiving portion 44, and likewise the distal end portion 96 of the<br>
instrument shaft 92, may take on a number of different shapes and configurations,<br>
including a hexagonal shape, a circular or elliptical shape, a square or rectangular shape, a<br>
Torx™-type configuration, or any other shape or configuration that would occur to one of<br><br>
skill in the art The distal-most end of the shaft 92 may define a tapered surface 98 to aid<br>
in insertion of the distal end portion 96 into the receiving portion 44 of the proximal head<br>
22. In other embodiments of the invention, the distal end portion of the instrument 90 may<br>
be configured with a receptacle or socket-type fitting for engagement over the proximal<br>
head 22 of the bone engaging portion 12 to facilitate driving of the bone engaging portion<br>
12 into and/or out of bone.<br>
As should be appreciated, the driver instrument 90 may be engaged with the<br>
proximal end portion of the elongate shaft 52 at a location outside of the patient's body via<br>
insertion of the proximal end portion of the shaft 52 into the axial passage 95 defined<br>
within the driver shaft 92. The elongate shaft 52 may then be used to guide the driver<br>
instrument 90 through a visually-obstructed opening, such as, for example a relatively<br>
small access portal (not shown) in the patient's skin or other bodily tissue and/or through a<br>
relatively narrow tissue protection device, such as, for example, a cannula tube, to<br>
facilitate engagement of the distal end portion 96 of the instrument 90 with the proximal<br>
head 22 of the bone anchor 10. As discussed above, the elongate guiding portion 14 is<br>
engaged with the bone engaging portion 12 in such a manner as to allow angular<br>
displacement of the elongate guiding portion 14 relative to the bone engaging portion 12<br>
(FIG. 3). As a result, guidance of the driver instrument 90 toward the proximal head 22 of<br>
the bone anchor 10 in directions transverse to the longitudinal axis L is possible. In other<br>
words, displacement of the driver instrument 90 does not necessarily have to occur along<br>
the longitudinal axis L. Instead, the instrument 90 may be guided toward the proximal<br>
head 22 of the bone engaging portion 12 in angular directions relative to the longitudinal<br>
axis L, up to and including the displacement angle 9 illustrated in FIG. 3.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, in a further embodiment of the invention, the guiding portion<br>
14 of the bone anchor 10 is used to guide an injector or delivery mechanism 70 into<br>
engagement with the proximal head 22 of the bone engaging portion 12. The injector<br>
mechanism 70 is in turn configured to deliver a material into the cannula passage 30 of the<br>
bone engaging portion 12, out the transverse fenestration openings 32, and into the<br>
surrounding bone tissue, the details of which will be discussed below. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, the injector mechanism 70 is configured as a syringe. However, other types<br>
and configurations of mechanisms, devices and systems for injecting or delivering a<br>
material into the cannula passage 30 and out the transverse openings 32 are also<br><br>
contemplated as would occur to one of skill in the art.<br>
The injector mechanism 70 generally includes a receptacle portion 72 and a<br>
plunger portion 74. The receptacle portion 72 defines a hollow intc lor 75 for receiving an<br>
amount of material 88 therein. The receptacle portion 74 also incl jdes a distal tip portion<br>
76 that is sized and configured for engagement witliin the receiving portion 44 defined<br>
within the proximal head 22 of the bone anchor 10 to facilitate delivery of the material 88<br>
into the cannula passage 30. As mentioned above, the receiving portion 44, and likewise<br>
the distal tip portion 76 of the injector mechanism 70, may take on a number of different<br>
shapes and configurations, including a hexagonal shape, a circular or elliptical shape, a<br>
square or rectangular shape, or any other shape or configuration that would occur to one of<br>
skill in the art. The distal-most end of the tip portior. 76 may define a tapered surface 78<br>
to aid in the insertion of the tip portion 76 into the receiving portion 44 of the proximal<br>
head 22. In other embodiments of the invention the distal end portion of the injector<br>
mechanism 70 may be configured with a receptacle or socket-type fitting for engagement<br>
over the proximal head 22 of the bone engaging portion 12 to facilitate delivery of the<br>
material 88 into the cannula passage 30.<br>
The plunger portion 74 of the injector mechanism 70 includes a main body portion<br>
that is sized and shaped for displacement along the hollow interior 75 of the receptacle<br>
portion 72 to inject the material 88 into the cannula passage 30 of the bone anchor 10. The<br>
plunger portion 74 includes an end poition 80 that functions in a piston-like manner to<br>
force the material 88 through the hollow interior 75 of the receptacle 72, out the tip portion<br>
76, and into the cannula passage 30. The end portion 80 of the plunger 74 defines an axial<br>
passage 82 extending therethrough that is sized and shaped to receive the elongate shaft 52<br>
of the guiding portion 14 therein. The distally-facing surface of the end portion 80 may be<br>
inwardly tapered toward the axial passage 82 to aid in the insertion of the elongate shaft<br>
52 into the axial passage 82.<br>
As should be appreciated, the injector mechanism 70 may be engaged with the<br>
proximal end portion of the elongate shaft 52 at a location outside of the patient's body via<br>
insertion of the proximal end portion of the shaft 52 through the tip portion 76 and into the<br>
hollow interior 75 of the receptacle 72. If required, the proximal end portion of the shaft<br>
52 may also be inserted into the axial passage 82 defined by the end portion 80 of the<br>
plunger 74. The elongate shaft 52 may then be used to guide the injector mechanism 70<br><br>
through a visually-obstructed opening and/or through a relatively narrow tissue protection<br>
device to facilitate engagement of the distal end portion 76 of the injector mechanism 70<br>
with the proximal head 22 of the bone anchor 10. As discussed above, the elongate<br>
guiding portion 14 is engaged with the bone engaging portion 12 in such a manner as to<br>
allow angular displacement of the elongate guiding portion 14 relative to the bone<br>
engaging portion 12. As a result, guidance of the injector mechanism 70 toward the<br>
proximal head 22 of the bone anchor 10 in directions transverse to the longitudinal axis L<br>
is possible.<br>
Following insertion of the tip portion 76 into the receiving portion 44 of the<br>
proximal head 22, the plunger 74 is displaced along the hollow interior 75 of the<br>
receptacle 72 to force the material 88 out of the tip portion 76. The spherical-shaped end<br>
portion 50 of the elongate guiding portion 14 may include one or more passages 58<br>
extending therethrough to provide communication between the receiving portion 44 of the<br>
passage 40 and the cannula passage 30 to facilitate delivery of the material 88 into the<br>
cannula passage 30. The material 88 is in turn conveyed through the cannula passage 30<br>
and is dispensed out of the transverse fenestration openings 32 to a location laterally<br>
adjacent the bone engaging portion 12 of the bone anchor 10. In an alternative<br>
embodiment of the invention, the material 88 may be delivered to the cannula passage 30<br>
via an axial-passageway 54 extending through the elongate guiding portion 14 (FIGS. 2<br>
and 3) of the bone anchor 10. In this manner, the material 88 may be conveyed through<br>
the axial passageway 54 and delivered to the cannula passage 30 via a delivery system or<br>
injector mechanism located remote from the proximal head 22 of the bone engaging<br>
portion 12, and possibly from a location entirely outside of the patient's body.<br>
As discussed above, various materials may delivered via the bone engaging portion<br>
12 of the bone anchor 10, such as, for example, bone cement, a bone growth promoting<br>
material, or other bio-compatible materials. In the embodiment of the invention illustrated<br>
in FIG. 5, the material 88 delivered into the bone engaging portion 12 via the injector<br>
mechanism 70 is bone cement. Following dispersion of the material 88 out the transverse<br>
fenestration openings 32, the cement material 88 cures or hardens, thereby forming a<br>
mantle M of material about the threaded shank 20. The mantle M of material serves to<br>
enhance engagement of the bone engaging portion 12 to the vertebra V, thereby<br>
preventing or at least substantially resisting bone anchor pull-out In embodiments of the<br><br>
invention where the material 88 comprises a bone growth promoting material such as<br>
BMP, the bone growth promoting material may similarly be delivered into the cannula<br>
passage 30 and out the fenestration openings 32 to promote bone growth in areas laterally<br>
adjacent the threaded shank 20 of the bone anchor 10.<br>
As indicated above, in the illustrated embodiment of the bone anchor 10, each of<br>
the fenestration openings 32 are disposed along the distal end portion of the threaded<br>
shank 20, and more particularly along the distal-most one-third of the threaded shank 20,<br>
thereby limiting formation of the mantle M of material about the distal end portion of the<br>
threaded shank 20. Additionally, since the cannula passage 30 does not extend entirely<br>
through the bone engaging portion 12, the entire amount of the material S8 is dispersed out<br>
the transverse fenestration openings 32 in a lateral direction, with no material 88 being<br>
discharged from the distal end of the bone engaging portion 12 in an axial direction.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, shown therein is a bone anchor 100 according to another form<br>
of the present invention. In many ways, the bone anchor 100 is configured similar to the<br>
bone anchor 10 illustrated and described above, generally comprising a bone engaging<br>
portion 112 and an elongate guiding portion 114 adapted to guide or deliver various<br>
devices, materials, instruments, implants and/or odier elements to the bone engaging<br>
portion 112. Similar to the bone engaging portion 12, the bone engaging portion 112<br>
comprises a bone screw having a distal end portion 112a and a proximal end portion 112b,<br>
and includes a threaded shank portion 120 and a proximal head portion 122. The threaded<br>
shank portion 120 defines external threads 124 configured to engage internal threads<br>
formed along a passage in bone. Additionally, the bone engaging portion 112 defines a<br>
cannula passage 130 extending axially from the proximal end portion 112b toward the<br>
distal end portion 112a, and a number of transverse fenestration openings 132 in<br>
communication with the cannula passage 130 and positioned along the distal end portion<br>
112a.<br>
The proximal head 122 of the bone engaging portion 112 includes a shaped<br>
passage or recess 140 communicating with the cannula passage 130. The shaped recess<br>
140 is configured to receive a correspondingly shaped end portion of the elongate guiding<br>
portion 114 therein to selectively couple the elongate guiding portion 114 with the bone<br>
engaging portion 112, the details of which will be discussed below. In one embodiment of<br>
the invention, the shaped recess 140 defined in the proximal head 122 includes a<br><br>
connecting portion 142 and a receiving portion 144. In a specific embodiment, the<br>
connecting portion 142 comprises a cylindrical-shaped passage sized to engagingly<br>
receive an end portion of the guiding portion 114 therein. In a further embodiment, the<br>
cylindrical-shaped passage 142 defines internal threads 143 adapted to threadingly engage<br>
an end portion of the guiding portion 114. In another specific embodiment, the receiving<br>
portion 144 comprises an axially-extending receptacle or opening sized to engagingly<br>
receive a corresponding end portion of an instrument, implant, mechanism, and/or other<br>
types of elements therein, examples of which have been illustrated and described above<br>
with regard to the bone anchor 10.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the elongate guiding portion 114 comprises a<br>
shaped end portion 150 and an elongate shaft portion 152 extending therefrom. In the<br>
illustrated embodiment, the shaped end portion 150 has a cylindrical-shaped configuration<br>
defining external threads 151 adapted for engagement within the internally threaded<br>
passage 142 defined in the proximal head 122 of the bone engaging portion 112. As<br>
should be appreciated, the threading engagement between the externally threaded end<br>
portion 150 and the internally threaded passage 142 releasably engages the elongate<br>
guiding portion 114 to the bone engaging portion 112 and also allows for selective<br>
removal of the elongate guiding portion 114 therefrom. The distally-facing surface of the<br>
threaded end portion 150 may be tapered to facilitate insertion into and threading<br>
engagement with the internally threaded passage 142.<br>
Similar to the elongate shaft portion 52 illustrated and described above with regard<br>
to the bone anchor 10, the elongate shaft portion 152 extends from the threaded end<br>
portion 150 and is adapted to guide or direct various devices, instruments, implants and/or<br>
other elements toward the proximal head 122 of the bone engaging portion 112. In the<br>
illustrated embodiment of the bone anchor 100, an axial passageway 154 extends along the<br>
elongate shaft portion 152 and through the threaded end portion 150 to allow delivery of a<br>
material to the cannula passage 130 from a location remote from the bone engaging<br>
portion 112 for distribution out of the transverse fenestration openings 132.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, shown therein is a bone anchor 200 according to another form<br>
of the present invention. In many ways, the bone anchor 200 is configured similar to the<br>
bone anchor 100 illustrated and described above, generally comprising a bone engaging<br>
portion 212 and an elongate guiding portion 214 adapted to guide or deliver various<br><br>
devices, materials, instruments, implants and/or other elements to the bone engaging<br>
portion 212. The bone engaging portion 212 comprises a bone screw having a distal end<br>
portion 212a and a proximal end portion 212b, and includes a threaded shank portion 220<br>
and a proximal head portion 222. The threaded shank portion 220 defines external threads<br>
224 configured to engage internal threads formed along a passage in bone. Additionally,<br>
the bone engaging portion 212 defines a cannula passage 230 extending axially from the<br>
proximal end portion 212b toward the distal end portion 212a, and a number of transverse<br>
fenestration openings 232 in communication with the cannula passage 230 and positioned<br>
along the distal end portion 212a.<br>
The proximal head 222 of the bone engaging portion 212 includes a shaped<br>
passage or recess 240 communicating with the cannula passage 230. The shaped recess<br>
240 is configured to receive a correspondingly shaped end portion of the elongate guiding<br>
portion 214 therein to selectively couple the elongate guiding portion 214 with the bone<br>
engaging portion 212. In one embodiment of the invention, the shaped recess 240 defined<br>
in the proximal head 222 includes a connecting portion 242 and a receiving portion 244.<br>
In a specific embodiment, the connecting portion 242 comprises a cylindrical-shaped<br>
passage sized to engagingly receive a correspondingly shaped end portion of the guiding<br>
portion 214 therein. In another specific embodiment, the receiving portion 244 comprises<br>
an axially-extending receptacle or opening sized to engagingly receive a corresponding<br>
end portion of an instrument, implant, mechanism, and/or other types of elements therein,<br>
examples of which have been illustrated and described above with regard to the bone<br>
anchor 10.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the elongate guiding portion 214 comprises a<br>
shaped end portion 250 and an elongate shaft portion 252 extending therefrom. In the<br>
illustrated embodiment, the shaped end portion 250 has a cylindrical-shaped configuration<br>
sized and shaped for releasable engagement within the cylindrical-shaped passage 242<br>
defined in the proximal head 222 of the bone engaging portion 212 and allowing for<br>
selective removal of the elongate guiding portion 214 therefrom.<br>
Similar to the elongate shaft portion 52 illustrated and described above with regard<br>
to the bone anchor 10, the elongate shaft portion 252 extends from the shaped end portion<br>
250 and is adapted to guide or direct various devices, instruments, implants and/or other<br>
elements toward the proximal head 222 of the bone engaging portion 212. In the<br><br>
illustrated embodiment of the bone anchor 200, an axial passageway 254 extends along the<br>
elongate shaft portion 252 and through the shaped end portion 250 to allow delivery of a<br>
material to the cannula passage 230 from a location remote from the bone engaging<br>
portion 212 for distribution out of the transverse fenestration openings 232. A seal 256<br>
may be engaged between the shaped end portion 250 of the elongate guiding portion 214<br>
and the proximal head 222 of the bone engaging portion 212 to provide a fluid-tight seal<br>
therebetween. In a specific embodiment, the seal 256 comprises an O-ring disposed<br>
between a distally-facing surface of the shaped end portion 250 and an annular shoulder<br>
258 located at the bottom of the cylindrical-shaped passage 242 of the recess 240. In a<br>
further embodiment, the distally-facing surface of the shaped end portion 250 and/or the<br>
annular shoulder 258 may define an annular retention groove (not shown) sized and<br>
shaped to receive the O-ring 256 therein to maintain the O-ring 256 in the proper position.<br>
In other embodiments of the invention, a seal may be positioned about the periphery of the<br>
shaped end portion 250 to provide a fluid-tight seal between the guiding portion 214 and<br>
the bone engaging portion 212.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 8-11, shown therein is a bone anchor 300 according to another<br>
form of the present invention. In many ways, the bone anchor 300 is configured similar to<br>
the bone anchor 100 illustrated and described above, generally comprising a bone<br>
engaging portion 312 and an elongate guiding portion 314 adapted to guide or deliver<br>
various devices, materials, instruments, implants and/or other elements to the bone<br>
engaging portion 312. Similar to the bone engaging portion 112, the bone engaging<br>
portion 312 comprises a bone screw having a distal end portion 312a and a proximal end<br>
portion 312b, and includes a threaded shank portion 320 and a proximal head portion 322.<br>
The threaded shank portion 320 defines external threads 324 configured to engage internal<br>
threads formed along a passage in bone. Additionally, the bone engaging portion 312<br>
defines a cannula passage 330 extending axially from the proximal end portion 312b<br>
toward the distal end portion 312a, and a number of transverse fenestration openings 332<br>
in communication with the cannula passage 330 and positioned along the distal end<br>
portion 312a.<br>
The proximal head 322 of the bone engaging portion 312 includes a shaped<br>
passage or recess 340 communicating with the cannula passage 330. The shaped recess<br>
340 is configured to receive a correspondingly shaped end portion of the elongate guiding<br><br>
portion 314 therein to selectively couple the elongate guiding portion 314 with the bone<br>
engaging portion 312, the details of which will be discussed below. In one embodiment of<br>
the invention, the shaped recess 340 defined in the proximal head 322 includes connecting<br>
portions 342a, 342b and a receiving portion 344. In the illustrated embodiment of the<br>
invention, the connecting portion 342a comprises a cylindrical-shaped passage defining<br>
internal threads 343a adapted to threadingly receive a threaded end portion of the guiding<br>
portion 314. Similarly, the connecting portion 342b comprises a cylindrical-shaped<br>
passage generally aligned with the passage 342a and defining internal threads 343b<br>
adapted to threadingly receive a threaded end portion of an instrument therein, the details<br>
of which will be discussed below.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the receiving portion 344 defined by the<br>
proximal head 322 comprises an axially-extending receptacle or opening sized to<br>
engagingly receive a correspondingly shaped end portion of an instrument, implant,<br>
mechanism, and/or other types of elements therein. In the illustrated embodiment of the<br>
invention, the receiving portion 344 has a Torx™-type configuration, including a number<br>
of recessed areas or axial grooves 345 spaced uniformly about the interior of the receiving<br>
portion 344. The axial grooves 345 are configured to receive axially-extending<br>
projections or splined portions 505 spaced uniformly about the exterior of the distal end<br>
portion 504 of a driver instrument 500 (FIG. 11). However, it should be understood that<br>
the receiving portion 344 may take on other shapes and configurations, including a<br>
hexagonal shape, a circular or elliptical shape, a square or rectangular shape, or any other<br>
shape or configuration that would occur to one of skill in the art.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the elongate guiding portion 314 comprises a<br>
shaped end portion 350 and an elongate shaft portion 352 extending therefrom. In the<br>
illustrated embodiment, the shaped end portion 350 has a cylindrical-shaped configuration<br>
defining external threads 351 adapted for engagement within the internally threaded<br>
passage 342a defined in the proximal head 322 of the bone engaging portion 312. As<br>
should be appreciated, the threading engagement between the externally threaded end<br>
portion 350 and the internally threaded passage 342a releasably engages the elongate<br>
guiding portion 314 to the bone engaging portion 312 and also allows for selective<br>
removal of the elongate guiding portion 314 therefrom. The distally-facing surface of the<br><br>
threaded end portion 350 may be tapered to facilitate insertion into and threading<br>
engagement with the threaded passage 342a.<br>
Similar to the elongate shaft portion 152 illustrated and described above with<br>
regard to the bone anchor 100, the elongate shaft portion 352 extends from the threaded<br>
end portion 350 and is adapted to guide or direct various devices, instruments, implants<br>
and/or other elements toward the proximal head 322 of the bone engaging portion 312.<br>
For example, as shown in FIG. 9, the elongate shaft 352 of me guiding portion 314 may be<br>
used to guide a tubular member 400 into engagement with the proximal head 322 of the<br>
bone engaging portion 312. More specifically, the tubular member 400 may be engaged to<br>
the guiding portion 314 of the bone anchor 300 at a location outside of the patient's body<br>
via insertion of the proximal end portion of the shaft 352 into the axial passage 402 of the<br>
tubular member 400. The elongate shaft 352 may then be used to guide the tubular<br>
member 400 through a visually-obstructed opening and/or a relatively narrow tissue<br>
protection device to facilitate engagement of the distal end portion 404 of the tubular<br>
member 400 with the proximal head 322 of the bone anchor 300.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the distal end portion 404 of the tubular<br>
member 400 defines external threads 405 adapted for engagement within the internally<br>
threaded passage 342b defined in the proximal head 322 of the bone engaging portion 312.<br>
As should be appreciated, the threading engagement between the threaded distal end<br>
portion 404 and the internally threaded passage 342b releasably engages the tubular<br>
member 400 to the bone engaging portion 312 and also allows for selective removal of the<br>
tubular member 400 from the bone engaging portion 312. The distally-facing surface of<br>
the threaded distal end portion 404 may be tapered to facilitate insertion into and threading<br>
engagement with the threaded passage 342b.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, when the threaded distal end portion 404 is engaged within<br>
the threaded passage 342b, the axial passage 402 of the tubular member 400 is positioned<br>
in communication with the cannula passage 330 in the bone engaging portion 312.<br>
Material may then be conveyed through the axial passageway 402 in the tubular member<br>
400 for delivery to the cannula passage 330 and out the fenestration openings 332 to a<br>
location laterally adjacent the bone engaging portion 312. Notably, delivery of the<br>
material to the cannula passage 330 may be made via a delivery system or injector<br>
mechanism located remote from the proximal head 322 of the bone engaging portion 312,<br><br>
and possibly from a location entirely outside of the patient's body. As discussed above,<br>
such material may include bone cement, a bone growth promoting substance such as BMP,<br>
or other types of bio-compatible materials.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11, in a further embodiment of the invention, the elongate shaft<br>
352 of the guiding portion 314 may be used to guide a driver instrument 500 into<br>
engagement with the proximal head 322 of the bone engaging portion 312. As discussed<br>
above, the driver instrument 500 includes a distal end portion 504 having a Torx™-type<br>
configuration defining a number of axially-extending projections or splined portions 505<br>
for receipt within the recessed areas or axial grooves 345 defined within the receiving<br>
portion 344 of the proximal head 322 to facilitate driving of the bone engaging portion 312<br>
into and/or out of bone. The driver instrument 500 also defines an axial passage 502<br>
extending at least partially therethrough and sized to receive the elongate shaft 352 of the<br>
guiding portion 314 therein. As should be appreciated, the driver instrument 500 may be<br>
engaged with the proximal end portion of the elongate shaft 352 at a location outside of<br>
the patient's body via insertion of the proximal end portion of the shaft 352 into the axial<br>
passage 502. The elongate shaft 352 may men be used to guide the distal end portion 504<br>
of the driver instrument 500 into engagement with the proximal head 322 of the bone<br>
anchor 300. Such guiding may be particularly useful when attempting to engage the driver<br>
instrument 500 with the bone engaging portion 312 of the bone anchor 300 through a<br>
visually-obstructed opening and/or a relatively narrow tissue protection device.<br>
Referring to FIG. 12, shown therein is a pair of the bone screws 12 engaged to a<br>
portion of the spinal column. More specifically, the threaded shank portions 20 of the<br>
bone screws 12 are engaged across the facet joints F of the upper and lower vertebrae Vu,<br>
VL, with the longitudinal axis L1, L2 of the bone screws 12 arranged in a transverse or X-<br>
shaped configuration (when viewed from an anterior-posterior direction). The bone<br>
screws 12 thereby serve to interconnect or join the upper and lower vertebrae Vu, VL-<br>
However, it should be understood that the bone screws 12 may be engaged across the facet<br>
joints F via other techniques to secure the facet joints F together and to interconnect the<br>
upper and lower vertebrae Vu, VL- AS would occur to those of skill in the art, such<br>
fixation techniques are used to treat diseased or injured spinal motion segments. As would<br>
also occur to those of skill in the art, this type of treatment may also be done in<br>
combination with various types of interbody fusion techniques<br><br>
In order to enhance fixation and/or fusion of the facet joints F, a material may be<br>
delivered to the areas adjacent the facet joints F, and more specifically to the areas<br>
adjacent the facet capsules defined by the facet joints F. Such material may include, for<br>
example, bone cement, a bone growth promoting substance such as BMP, or other bio-<br>
compatible materials know to those of skill in the art. Notably, when the bone screws 12<br>
are properly anchored to the upper and lower vertebrae Vu, VL, the fenestration openings<br>
32 will be positioned adjacent the facet joints F, and more particularly adjacent the facet<br>
capsules. In this manner, material may be delivered through the cannula passage 30<br>
extending through the threaded shank 20 of the screws 12 (FIGS. 2 and 3) and dispensed<br>
out the fenestration openings 32 to a targeted location adjacent the facet joints F. Since<br>
the fenestration openings 32 are strategically positioned along the distal end portions 12a<br>
of the bone screws 12, and more particularly along the distal-most one-third of the bone<br>
screws 12, delivery of the material to the facet joints F, and more particularly to the facet<br>
capsules, can be accomplished in a controlled and efficient manner.<br>
While the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and<br>
foregoing description, the same is to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive in<br>
character, it being understood that only the preferred embodiments have been shown and<br>
described, and that all changes and modifications that come within the spirit of the<br>
invention are desired to be protected.<br><br>
