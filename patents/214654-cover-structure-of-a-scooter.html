[Detailed Description of the Invention] <br>
 [0001]<br>
[(Technical -Field of the Invention]	<br>
This invention relates to a cover of a scooter structure,such as a<br><br>
floor cover in a step floor and a body cover for enclosing a lower circumference of a seat in a scooter type vehicle having a low floor at a central part of forward or rearward direction of the vehicle body.<br>
In addition, the present invention relates to a rear fender fixing structure in a scooter type vehicle in which a rear fender is fixed to the lower part of the rear portion of the vehicle frame raised from the rear part of the floor toward a rear upper part.<br>
[0002]<br>
[Prior Art and Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
It is generally found in a floor cover of a scooter type vehicle that the floor cover is not usually removed for its maintenance work or the like, so that the floor cover is fixed at an initial stage in assembling work, and a body cover is fixed in compliance with the fixed floor cover.<br>
[0003]<br>
Even in the case that an exhaust pipe fixing part for an internal combustion engine at a front part of a power unit is fixed or removed in order to perform a maintenance work for a muffler or the like, a large-sized body cover is removed and its work is not easily carried out.<br>
In view of this fact, the body cover was provided with a maintenance lid, the body cover was divided and the right and left side covers were coupled to each other (Gazette of Patent Laid-Open No. Sho 62-94485 and the like). <br>
[0004 ]<br>
However, there are some disadvantages that a die or the like for a maintenance lid or a side cover is required, its cost becomes high, it requires a large number of assembling steps and its working efficiency is not superior.<br>
The present invention described in Claims 1 to 3 has been made in view of such disadvantages as above and its object is to provide a less-expensive floor structure of a scooter-type vehicle in which its structure is simple in less number of<br>
component parts, a floor cover can be removed also during a maintenance work for a muffler or the like and the maintenance work can be performed easily.<br>
Since a scooter type vehicle has a low floor at its forward or rearward central part of the vehicle, various kinds of devices are arranged in a space between a seat and a power unit, and in particular, a large-sized member such as a fuel tank is arranged at a lower part of the seat front part having a more relative surplus space than a narrow rear part of an arranging space where a rear wheel oscillates in an upward or a downward direction.<br>
In view of this fact, it has already been proposed to provide a scooter type vehicle in which the fuel tank is arranged below the front part of the seat and the seat can be opened or closed, wherein an electrical element storing box is integrally formed at the body cover covering a rear part of the vehicle body (a gazette of Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. Sho 57-28081). [0007]<br>
However, an oil tank must be installed in addition to the electrical elements, and additional fastening members for the oil tank are required, resulting in that normally one-point or two-points bolt fastening assembly is applied. Accordingly, the prior art had some disadvantages that a high investment<br>
amount was required for the fixing members or the like, it required a large number of component parts and its assembling work was troublesome. [0001]<br>
The invention described in Claims 4 to 9 of the present patent application has been accomplished in view of the aforesaid points and its object consists in providing a less -expensive body cover structure in which the part for use in fixing the oil tank or the electrical elements in the scooter type vehicle is integrally formed in the body cover, the die investment is reduced, the less number of component parts is required and its assembling work may also be easily carried out.<br>

[0094-]<br>
As shown in Fig.30, a rear central part of the rear-fender 65 is curved upwardly to form an abutting part 65b, a hole 65g is formed in the abutting part 65b. As shown in Fig.31, the abutting part 65b of the rear-fender 65 is abutted against the lower surface of a rear concave part 29r of the sub-frame 29, a bolt 47 is inserted into a hole 291 of the rear concave part 29r of the sub-frame 29 and a hole 65g of the abutting part 65b of the rear-fender 65, a nut 48 is threadably fitted to and<br><br>
fastened to the extremity end of the bolt, thereby a rear part of the rear fender 65 can be integrally coupled to the sub-frame 29.<br>
A fixing structure of the body cover 55 made of synthetic resin in respect to the rear sub-frame 29 has already been described, and its detailed structure is shown in Figs.31 to 34.<br>
[0096]<br>
Then, a lock mechanism for the seat 40 will be described. The seat 40 is pivotally arranged at the extremity end of the fuel tank 37 in such a way that the seat can be oscillated in an upward or a downward direction. As shown in Fig.33, a U-shaped engaging member 110 is integrally arranged at the rear end of the seat 61 in a downward direction, and as shown in Figs.31 and 33, a seat lock 111 to which an engaging claw Ilia which can be engaged with the U-shaped engaging member 110 is installed in the sub-frame 29. That is, holes lllc are formed across a base part 1l1b of the seat lock 111. Holes 29s are formed inwardly across a left raised supporting part 29g at the sub-frame 29. Bolts 112 are passed in the holes 29s, lllc from the lower part to the upper part and nuts 113 are threadably fitted to and fastened to their extremity ends. As shown in Fig.33, the left side raised part 29g and the left side wall of the body cover 55 are formed with round holes 29q, 57v in such a way that a key insertion part 111d of the seat lock 111<br><br>

A bolt 117 is inserted into these recess 29n and hole 116b, and a nut 118 is threadably fitted to and fastened to the extremity end of the bolt 117. ••{ 0098 ]*<br>
In addition, an anti-theft U-shaped lock engaging hook 119 is integrally fixed to one side surface of the lower rear extending part 7d of the rear-frame 7 by welding and the like. [0099] .<br>
In the preferred embodiment 3, as described above, the rear-frame 7 of the main frame is constructed by a hollow member having a large sectional size, resulting in that a large reaction force applied from the rear wheel 4 to the shock absorbing unit supporting shaft 19 through the shock absorbing unit 26 can be positively borne by the rear-frame 7.<br><br>
[0100]<br>
The rear sub-frame 29 made of aluminum is inserted into the hollow rear- frame and fixed by the bolts 60, 61 and the nut 62 at two forward or rearward locations (accurately three locations), thereby the rear sub-frame 29 can be forcedly coupled to the rear- frame 7.<br>
Further, since the rear sub-frame 29 is made of cast aluminum, its weight is light and it is easy to form its shape into one which is suitable for fixing the component parts such as rear-fender 65, body cover 55, carrier 102, seat lock 111, regulator 115 and register 116 or the like and further its small-size and cost-down can be realized by reducing the fixing parts .<br>
In addition, since the carrier 102 is installed at the sub-frame 29 together with the body cover 55, it is possible to reduce the number of fixing component elements such as body cover 55 and carrier 102 and also the number of assembling steps and to make a cost-down of them. [0103]<br>
Further, since the fixing of the rear part of the fuel tank 37 against the upper rear end 7e of the rear-frame 7 is carried out in concurrent with the front end 29a of the sub-frame 29, it is also possible to reduce the number of component parts and the number of assembling steps.<br>
i<br><br>
Further, since the sub-frame 29 is made of aluminum, its surface treatment is not needed and in addition/ a thermal radiation characteristic of the electrical component parts such as the regulator 115 and the register 116 or the like is improved.<br>
