				<td>THE INVENTION<br>
The use of electrodes obtained by coating a valve metal substrate (for<br>
example titanium, zirconium, niobium, tantalum) with an electrocatalytic<br>
paint is known for use in different application fields. These electrodes<br>
may be useful in several electrolytic processes, for example for the<br>
evolution of chlorine from sodium chloride brine, as anodes for oxygen<br>
evolution in electrometallurgical processes or anodes for cathodic<br>
protection.<br>
U.S. patent no. 3,632,498 describes a general method for the production<br>
of this type of electrodes, which consists in applying to the valve metal a<br>
precursor, that is a paint containing the electrocatalytic components in<br>
ionic form, which is converted into the catalyst by means of a thermal<br>
treatment in air (activation). The temperatures required for the conversion<br>
may be extremely high (300-800°C). The most common method for the<br>
industrial production of these electrodes foresees, after the application of<br>
each paint layer, heating in oven at high temperature. As these electrodes<br>
usually have a very large size, the ovens have a great thermal mass which<br>
involves high production costs and severe problems due to the need of<br>
maintaining a homogeneous temperature profile throughout the whole<br>
volume. The electrodes usually comprise a frame for anchoring to the<br>
electrochemical cells wherein they are to be used. During heating in<br>
oven it is the whole electrode structure that undergoes the thermal<br>
treatment with the consequent waste of the energy used to heat<br>
unnecessarily the frame of the electrode. However, the most severe<br>
disadvantage is represented by the distortions caused by said treatment to<br>
some particularly critical areas, such as welding and connection points<br>
among different parts. Electrodes with a thin layer of a catalyst which<br>
coats the valve metal offer the main advantage that at the end of the<br>
active lifetime there is no need for substituting the electrode but just<br>
providing for reactivation with a new catalytic paint, as described in<br>
British Patent No. 1.324.924.<br>
The application of the coating is a simple procedure carried out by<br>
spraying, which could be made even at the plant site if it were not<br>
necessary to resort to large dimensions ovens capable of reaching the<br>
necessary high temperatures, a burden which most users cannot bear, also<br>
due to the fact that a large number of elements should be treated in order<br>
to justify the oven installation and operation costs. Therefore the<br>
exhausted electrodes are usually returned to the producers to be<br>
reactivated, with remarkable additional costs for shipping and packing of<br>
the same.<br>
In many cases re-inserting the electrode into the production cycle requires<br>
further steps. This is the case, for example, with the anodes for oxygen<br>
evolution used in some electrometallurgical processes where it is<br>
extremely important that the whole surface operate at the same potential<br>
and where the ohmic drops of the electrode structure should be kept at<br>
very low values. For this reason a current conducting structure is welded<br>
onto the active surface of the electrode, which conductive structure<br>
consists of a metal having good conductive properties, for example,<br>
copper coated with a valve metal. In order to reactivate this type of<br>
electrodes, usually the current conductive structure must be detached, as it<br>
cannot undergo the thermal decomposition treatment at high temperature,<br>
due to the different expansion characteristics of the two metals. A high<br>
number of elements are severely damaged during the detachment and<br>
must be substituted. Further, welding of the current conductive structure<br>
to the electrode involves a strong risk of locally damaging the catalyst and<br>
must be carried out with particular care by highly qualified technicians.<br>
The application of paint onto a metal surface is not limited to the case of<br>
electrodes. A particular case is the application of catalytic paints to valve<br>
metals, as described in U.S. patents Nos. 4,082,900 and 4,154,897. These<br>
patents describe the application of a paints containing a first oxide of an<br>
element of the platinum group and a second oxide having special<br>
characteristics to inhibit corrosion. This type of coating is particularly<br>
useful for protecting localized areas, for example interstices and junctions<br>
where crevice corrosion could destroy the integrity of the element. As the<br>
thermal treatment is required only in these localized areas, the need to<br>
subject the whole element to a thermal treatment in oven strongly<br>
penalizes said application both under the economical and practical<br>
standpoints.<br>
It is the main object of the present invention to overcome the prior art<br>
shortcomings by providing a method for the activation of a metal by an<br>
electrocatalytic or protective paint, comprising applying a precursor and<br>
subjecting the surface to a local thermal treatment by a hot air gun or<br>
blower to produce high temperature and keep it under continuous control.<br>
The control of the temperature of the metal substrate is made locally by<br>
means of surface temperature sensors or by means of infrared measuring<br>
systems.<br>
The dimension of the surface heated by the air jet depends on the type of<br>
nozzle applied to the blower and may vary from some square centimeters<br>
to some hundred square centimeters.<br>
It is a particular object of the invention to provide a method for applying<br>
an electrocatalytic coating onto a substrate, which may consist of an<br>
exhausted electrode and which may be carried out at the plant site without<br>
any need for shipping the exhausted electrode structure to the producers.<br>
The method of the invention is particularly useful for reactivating anodes<br>
for oxygen evolution as it permits to avoid the risky operation of<br>
detaching the current conducting structure.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a method not only for<br>
reactivating exhausted electrodes but also for treating new electrodes and<br>
elements which need a protective coating against corrosion, where as<br>
flanges or gaskets are applied during assembling in the plant. It is a<br>
further object to provide a method for repairing a damaged area of a metal<br>
substrate, previously provided with a coating..<br>
The invention will be better illustrated by means of some examples, which<br>
are not to be intended as a limitation of the same.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A solution made of:<br>
620 ml n-butanol<br>
40 ml HC1 36%<br>
300 ml butyl titanate<br>
100gRuCl3<br>
was applied by electrostatic brushing to a titanium electrode structure<br>
having an active surface of 1 m2, upon hot pickling in oxalic acid, cleaning<br>
in a ultrasonic bath and drying.<br>
After each application of the paint, the electrode surface was heated by an<br>
air jet at 500°C from a Leister blower, "Robust" 7.5 kW type, provided<br>
with a rectangular nozzle, 30 cm long and 1 cm wide. The treatment<br>
lasted about one hour and the temperature of the metal substrate was kept<br>
under control by an infrared system for local measurement.<br>
The electrode thus prepared was used as an anode for the electrolysis of<br>
sodium chloride in a mercury cathode cell fed with 28% brine at a pH of<br>
2.5 and a temperature of 80°C. The cell was inserted in an industrial<br>
circuit of cells equipped with commercial electrodes. The current density<br>
was 10kA/m2; the overvoltage of the electrode of the invention showed<br>
no significant difference with respect to the commercial electrodes.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Two zirconium bars having the same size were degreased and pickled for<br>
8 hours in a 10% oxalic acid solution at 90°C. A paint having the<br>
following composition was then applied to the bars :<br>
- 30 ml TiCl3 dissolved in water<br>
- 3 g anhydrous FeCl3<br>
-1g FeCl2<br>
The first bar was subjected to thermal treatment in oven at a temperature<br>
of 600°C for 2 hours. The second bar was subjected to a thermal<br>
treatment according to the method of the invention with a hot air jet at<br>
600°C using the same blower of Example 1, for about one hour, the only<br>
exception being the use of thermocouples to measure the temperature.<br>
Each bar was connected to a cathodic protection system of steel<br>
structures buried in the soil and both bars correctly performed for above<br>
1000 hours at a current density of 1000 A/m2.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
The titanium anodic flange of a bipolar element of a De Nora DD 350<br>
membrane electrolyzer, potentially subject to crevice corrosion<br>
phenomena, was painted in three subsequent applications with a solution<br>
made of :<br>
3 gRuCl3<br>
1.74 g H2IrCl6<br>
390 mg TiCl3 from a 4% by weight hydrochloric acid solution<br>
1 ml 2-propanol<br>
After each application, only the painted portion was subjected to the<br>
thermal treatment according to the method of the invention with a hot air<br>
jet at 540°C using the same blower of Example 1, for 25 minutes, the<br>
temperature of the metal substrate being kept under control by means of<br>
an infrared system for local measurement.<br>
The element comprising the flange thus treated was inserted and operated<br>
in an experimental bipolar De Nora DD 350 electrolyzer comprising a<br>
second element, the anodic flange of which had not been subjected to any<br>
treatment against corrosion. After 3000 hours of operation the element<br>
protected by the catalytic paint did not show any corrosion phenomena.<br>
The anodic flange of the un-treated element appeared to be covered in<br>
localized areas by a pulverulent deposit which, from a chemical analysis,<br>
resulted to be essentially made of TiO2.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
The damaged coating of a flange of a bipolar element of a DD 350<br>
electrolyzer was repaired as described hereinafter. The bipolar element<br>
came from an industrial electrolyzer disassembled after three years of<br>
operation for the substitution of a membrane. During the detachment of<br>
the gaskets, the protective coating of the titanium flange of one bipolar<br>
element came off in a limited corner area. After careful washing with<br>
demi water and drying, the damaged area was ground with corindone<br>
sand removing also a small quantity of the old coating along the<br>
periphery. After another washing and drying, the ground area was treated<br>
as described in Example 3. The new coating successfully overcome the<br>
adherence test carried out by applying a suitable scotch tape and then<br>
tearing it off. No appreciable amounts of coating were removed.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
An anode for oxygen evolution, made of a titanium base activated by a<br>
catalytic coating and a current conducting structure made of copper<br>
coated with titanium and directed to minimizing the ohmic drops and<br>
therefore to keep the electrochemical potential of the anode uniform, was<br>
used in chromium plating processes and withdrawn at the end of the<br>
lifetime, degreased, sandblasted and pickled in a sulphuric acid solution.<br>
The anode was then reactivated according to the following procedure:<br>
- four repeated applications of a mixture made of<br>
100 mg/ml TaCl5<br>
150mg/ml IrCl3.3H2O<br>
in a 20% hydrochloric acid solution up to obtaining a deposit of 1 g/m2<br>
of noble metal<br>
- drying at 150°C and thermal decomposition at 500°C, after each<br>
application of the above paint, by means of a hot air jet using the same<br>
blower of Example 1.<br>
The electrode was re-inserted in the chromium plating bath, made of 300<br>
g/l of CrO3 and 4 g/l of H2SO4, wherein it worked continuously for<br>
1500 hours with the same electrochemical performances as before<br>
deactivation.<br>
The invention has been described making reference to specific<br>
embodiments thereof. However, it must be understood that modifications<br>
of the same are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of<br>
this invention. One with ordinary skill can make various changes and<br>
modifications to this invention to adapt it to the various uses and<br>
conditions. As such, these changes and modifications are properly,<br>
equitably and intended to be within the full range of equivalents of the<br>
