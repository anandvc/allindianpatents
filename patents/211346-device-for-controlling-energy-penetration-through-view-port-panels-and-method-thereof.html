				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This specification is for device for controlling energy penetration through view port panel and method thereof used in movable and immovable application. In the field pertaining to light energy control for view port panel there are broadly two kinds of devices for light control. These two kinds are fixed and selective type. The fixed type has tinted panels and the other tinted film permanently applied by adhesive to panel.<br>
Prior Art<br>
The practiced prior art of the selective type controls provides filter screen, mesh or perforated screen, blinds, louver, visor and the like which are roll-able or foldable made from non metallic material like natural fiber and synthetic material or metallic material and their combination, for light interception and can be selectively used i.e. withdrawn without affecting other functions unlike the fixed type. These allow heat generated from the Intercepted sunlight, since energy cannot be destroyed in this situation, the light converts to heat energy, to be transmitted to the air in contact by the face surface of the screen and through the mesh void and perforation inner surfaces. These inner surfaces increase the heat transmission from screen to air. Further and more important the voids, perforation allow heated air to pass through easily and carry heat to the interiors by setting off additional convective heat current. The prior art has no control of generated heat, a major shortcoming of longstanding.<br>
Description<br>
The present invention besides providing selective controllable relief from direct sunlight, controls and reduces the heat content in the occupation area, interior of the room/compartment thus increasing comfort over the prior art, reducing air condition load, cutting on the energy fuel consumption, thus reducing pollution, resulting in benefiting the environment. Another advantage is on the health of occupants. Ultra-violet radiation as part of the electromagnetic solar energy is reportedly a cause of cancer, the present invention provides a strong cut off of<br>
these radiations In automobiles, other mobile transport-train, plane and on fixed building windows. Because of this facility of withdraw-able pliability of the light filter, even on curved surfaces along with easy storability provided by this invention an occupant can use strong filer during day and gain here-fore stated advantages and withdraw it at will at evening, night time or on overcast sky time, and or in winter time use ultra-violet filter plus the heat option as herein described. The invention also provides a screen, which is fluid impervious thus no such heat transmission herein fore described is possible. Also by having the filtering and or reflecting on the exterior face of the filter screen all the light blocking is being accomplished on the external face thus heat generated is also on the external face and the (synthetic) transparent substrata provides heat insulation. Additionally because no void or perforations are there thus no extra heat transmission by convectlve currents across the screens major faces Is there. The filter means of the Invention gives the added advantage of providing full surface ultra-violet filtration as against perforated/mesh void, which allow ultraviolet passage in the non-opaque i.e. void and perforation areas. Also in cold weather condition too the filter means provides ultra-violet protection by either using a plane ultra-violet filter or using ultra-violet tinted here-fore described and allowing the heat to flow in by controlling the restraining mean as herein described to allow convective air flow into the interior. Another advantage of pliable filter means is of giving security and privacy since looking into interiors is not possible with strong filter tint of filter means.<br>
The invention further comprises restraining mean for confining the heat convectlve current preferentially at the periphery of the pliable, spreadable flexural filter means described herein fore. The heat that is transmitted to the air cause the heating of air which rise being lighter and escape from the periphery of the view port commensurate filter means and into the interiors. Since varied forms of filter means shall be used because of the many and varied applications both on mobile and fixed situations the restraining means shall accordingly be different and subjective to situations. In an embodiment restraining mean is a flap on the filter means periphery which collapses on filter means surface while filter means is being rolled as a roll or withdrawn as folded pleats into its storing housing and the flap opens up when the filter means Is being spread open to form an air confining angular wall at the filter means periphery between the impervious surface of the<br>
filter means and the compartment and view port panel interiors. In another situation the restraining means shall be a fixed type forming an air confining trapping means with the filter means and the view port panel interior. The restraining mean shall have control for its activation and when desired shall be deactivated in certain situation. For example in winter times one may like the heat to come to the interior and then restraining mean is inactivated to let heat travel to the interior while the filter means is in action for security, mild light control, and ultra-violet action. Such permutation combination are possible through such suitable controls for example the restraining mean shall have controllable ports located at the upper end of the restraining means, corresponding to upper end of filter means that are opened and the heated air flow into the interior heating the room compartment.<br>
In another application situation where the window view port panel surface is curved, of dove tailed like profile besides being set inclined to horizontal for example, as is the case automobile front and rear screen the restraining mean shall be a curved panel commensurate to auto screen profile set incline congruent with peripheral ends, outline ends being structured to form an air confining zone with the automobile interior. In this form the restraining mean may also support the flexural pliable filter means screen surface and plying, store means, actions/ functions, herein described feature function means and act as a composite structure. These may be as an add-on or incorporated into the panel housing structure and fitments.<br>
In this form of restraining mean with the full surface commensurate to the port profile it provides beside the physical and other functions support here-fore described, an fluid impervious and heat-insulating surface, in addition to the filter means insulation on the interior face of the filter means herein fore described. The filter means in such a situation be air permeable or impervious. In another form, the filter means Is made of multi-layers flexural pliable screen where the herein fore described filter screen has added flexible pliable of similar/ same profile running parallel to form a multi-layered filter means. The small air gap between layers create high heat insulation since the air heat conductivity is over 10 times less than of synthetic plastic being used to make the filter means screen. The small air gap between surfaces because of the boundary layer effect in fluids gives, besides the physical constraints, reduce movement of air thus confining the<br>
heat flow and act as insulation. On the contrary, a free air body like where large air layer is there, air on gaining heat moves away replaced by cooler air. This give rapid heat transfer as on the free face part of the filter means and view port panel. The multi-layer filter means screen thus gives lower heat transfer and also sound absorption besides giving clear operational view capacity.<br>
This differential heat resistance, more on the interior face than the exterior face of the filter means is it yet another advantage feature.<br>
Another feature is that the pliable filter means is non-adhesively attached to the surface of the view panel to give it heat conduction capability. This can be done by like inflating by air pumped in, or by establishing an air stream flow, which also passes out to exterior after giving the desired inflation, or by static-magnetic cleavage.<br>
In another form of the filter means there are two layers the outer layer towards the windscreen has tinting and the Inner layer is plane. The two are air sealed on the periphery - 4 sides; on opposite side there are air openings for air inlet and outlet. In the extended form of the filter means the spread is between the windscreen and the restraining mean, which supports the special filter means. Air is pumped between the filter means layers. The small pressure and outlet restriction inflates It slightly so that the layers get in contact with the windscreen surface and the restraining mean surface and creating an air corridor with inflation air. In this form air steam flows through the layer and exit to the exterior. Thus firstly because of the physical and thermal surface contact, the heat generated is conducted away to the windscreen and there-from to the external atmosphere very rapidly because of free airflow over the windscreen external surface. Secondly the heat coming inward is getting carried by the air steam and expelled out of the system. In another form they are only ballooning of the film to get thermal contact heat dissipation. The air steam after filtering dust can also be provided for single layer filter means for removing heat as also moisture condensation by an air pump means. In another form the restraining mean support moves in to make the filter means come Into contract with the windscreen's inner surface to attain heat conductivity. Additional tint can also be achieved by using different or additional filter means filter, singularly or in tandem. A filter screen tint can also be non-uniform like light tint in the middle and progressively increasing to the peripheral areas.<br>
The use of restraining mean with filter means and their forms herein described<br>
confines the heat, thus less heat enters the interior compartment. The temperature<br>
In the confined zone increases because of the heat concentration well above the<br>
interior  compartment  area.  When   the  temperature   rises  beyond  the  external<br>
temperature due to increasing heat from light energy inflow there is heat outflow to<br>
exterior while the interior compartment is at lower temperature. This was not<br>
possible with the state of the art equipment.<br>
An added feature Is to provide an air evacuation means that evacuates the hot air<br>
confined   by   the   restraining   mean   to   the   compartment   exterior  herein   fore<br>
described. This can be done by like an air pump or hot air draft system based on<br>
convectlve,   Induclve   current.   The   air   replenishment   is   preferable   at   the<br>
gravitational lower end of the filter means.<br>
The use of evacuation means can further reduce the air-conditioner load because<br>
the confined heat is more energy efficiently removed.<br>

Detailed Description.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1 which depicts a schematic three dimensional example of view port (1) with dove curve periphery (11) and (12), side (10) view port (1) of the curved cylindrical/spherical surface mounted incline to the horizontal plane common to automobile windscreen or rear view screens. Sunlight during day time enter these essential port in large quantum due to their large size and incline mounts bring in lot of light energy which gets totally converted to heat on striking the interior. In case of tinted panel, the tint filtering-permanent In nature is to be little as strong tint shall act as a strong deterrent and driving hazard at time of low external illumination/ daylight.<br>
Fig. 2 depicts schematically one level the horizontal section of invention device mounted a position the view port panel (1). The filter means filter screen (4) is tinted flexible pliable and of similar to port spread out along the curve panel surface from the Incline side (10) of the panel (1) emerging from stored as a roll a storing means housing (8). The surface of filter screen (4) is supported on the restraining means (5), a transparent, heat-insulating screen, support which extends commensurate to the port panel profile-dove with curvature. The top and lower ends of restraining mean (5) is attached with ply means, which has channel form 6 to support plying of filter screen (4). In another form the ply<br>
means channel are of other form, detachable and to lock the filter means. Not shown in diagram, also seal filter means on periphery at least in a part with the view port panel. The ply means communicates the filter means to the storing housing, provides its spreading, storing- manual and automatic, mounting and attaching to the view port structure and other function herein described. The curved restrain means (5) also has along the periphery channels 6 and sides (10) structured like flap, pads, seal form (7) to form, develop a confining area between the view port panel screen (1) and restrain means (5). The sunlight passing the view port panel screen (1) falls on the spread out filter means screen (4) where on the exterior surface of the filter screen (4), light is intercepted by the tint and converted to heat. The heat is transmitted to the air In contact on the exterior surface where there is free air in the confine area. The heated air rises and contacts the interior side of the view port panel screen (1). The heat gets transferred to view port panel screen (1) and conducted out to the exterior face of the view port panel screen wherefrom it is dissipated to the air outside. Some air rises along the interior surface of the port panel (1) to the top where it is confined by the confining structure (7). It may be passed out the exterior from port (3). The air acts as the medium of heat transfer energy from the filter screen (4) to panel (1), circulating in the confined area. Heat is restrained from moving to auto compartment thus controlling at source heat generated by light inflow. The flow of heat is dependent besides other factors like medium heat co-efficient, depth and area, on the temperature gradient difference, higher the temperature In the confining area with respect to the external temperature more heat flow to the exterior.<br>
The filter screen (4) in a preferred form has the tint on the exterior surface-facing the view port panel (1) and the light gets intercepted on this surface generating heat. The backside of the substrate filter screen is of synthetic flexible reliable heat insulating material like polyester, polycarbonate. Thus heat is restrain in its flow inwards while on the exterior side there is rapid heat transfer by the free air here-fore described. The tint has additional features like has scratch resistance. The tint may not be uniform and be varied across the surface of the filter screen. In another form of screen is long and rolls like as a camera film over the port. In another form the filter means is multi layer allowing greater tint and a thicker substrate, giving more heat insulation and allow rollbllity. In yet another form the filter means has a two films of the same curved periphery dove profile which are closed sealed on the periphery to form<br>
a profile tuboid -tubular dove tail form with at least air inlet port and air pumped in. This results in inflating the dove profile filter screen located between the view port panel (1) and restraint screen (5) there by making physical contact of the filter tint surface with the screen (1) interior giving thermal conduction of the intercepted light generated heat to exterior. In another form there is an evacuation means, which maintains a continuous flow of the inflating air out of the filter film tuboid, which carries the rear side heat of the filter screen film (4) to the exterior of the compartment. The filter means here fore described is stored as a roll on a mandrill in the storing means housing (8) - fig. 2. In the example the profile is substantially dove tailed with curved top and lower edges curviform. Roller mandrill for this profile is in form of a truncated cone (9) • fig. 2. Since a cylindrical roller shall not allow projection unequal side lengths of a curved dove tail profile with rolling axis parallel to incline side (10) of the panel screen (1). For a spheroid surface on the dove curved tail profile a truncated cone roll with middle part spherical shall be used to store as a roll as a curviform filter means. In another application where same linear projection are required from turning of roller as in the case of a rectangular projection form the roller can be cylindrical roller and on this rectangular projection a trapezium profile is generated with roller axis parallel to major base parallel side- the rear side windows of automobile. In another application the profile filter screen is stored folded in pleats and stretched to spread out or stored as a panel sheet and have housing for withdrawing and storing. The spreading and plying of the filter means can be manual, spring loaded or automated by electric power or power and have locking and electrical mechanical devices to effects the function of the invention. A means for wipe cleaning the filter means is located at the storing or ply means.<br>
The restraining means (5) is transparent, of low thermal conduction, flexible but of structural formed rigidity, scratched resistant synthetic material like polycarbonate structural to give required function of the Invention. As integral or in conjunction with other means and devices described herein In the present example it acts as deterrent to projectile, impact fire retardant in the unfortunate event of crash like other accepted synthetic plastic engineering material. The device shall have features to allow easy maintenance and mounting to the view port panel room, on the Interior or the exterior.<br>
In an embodiment, of the invention for plane surface port view panel shown schematically in fig. 4 as a horizontal section. The port panel is not having deep curved surface as described herein by fig. 1, fig. 2, fig. 3. Fig. 5 shows schematically the vertical section view of the plane view port panel. Filter screen (23) fig. 4 and fig. 5 is having the tint filtering face on the exterior face and Is of flexible synthetic non-heat conducting material as described as filter means herein-fore. The confining area is done by flap (24) extending from periphery of the filter screen (23) which in the spread out position opens up to create a confining area with the view panel (21) and Its mounting system (22). On withdrawing of filter screen by rolling the flap recede collapse on filter screen and roll with the filter screen on roller (26). Light from outside passes the port panel and intercepted by the filter screen to a desire filter level. The intercepted light gets converted to heat energy which causes heating of air In contact with filter screen surface because of the confining by the restrain means flaps (24), the hot air is not free to spread to the room interior and on concentration of heat to a temperature greater than external temperature the heat starts flowing out through the view port panel. The air can be removed at top (25) and carried to exterior of the room as an added feature described herein by evacuating means. The filter screen can be withdrawn to let the light In when required. This leads to higher comfort and better ergonomics, saving of energy and fuel.<br>
