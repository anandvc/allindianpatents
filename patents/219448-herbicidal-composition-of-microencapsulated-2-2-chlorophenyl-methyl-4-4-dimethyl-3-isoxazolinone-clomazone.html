LOW VOLATILITY FORMULATIONS OF CLOMAZONE<br><br>
The present invention relates to formulations of clomazone having reduced volatility relative to conventional emulsifiable concentrates of clomazone. In particular it relates to microencapsulated formulations of clomazone in which the clomazone is encapsulated in a shell of polyurea.<br>
Clomazone, the common name for 2-(2-chlorophenyl)methyl-4,4-dimethyl-3-isoxazolinone, a highly effective herbicide, is also highly volatile, so much so that clomazone applied to the soil in a target area may move to adjacent areas and there cause discoloration, most typically whitening or some degree of bleaching, of a variety of crops, trees, or decorative plants. While this bleaching, indicative of the mode of action of the herbicide, may be temporary when plants are exposed to sufficiently low concentrations, it is unwelcome, e.ven when it does not result in the destruction of the plant. Accordingly, the label for the use of Command® 4 EC Herbicide, an emulsifiable concentrate formulation in commercial use that contains four pounds of clomazone per gallon of formulation, lists a number of restrictions on how the product is to be used, including weather conditions, spray volume and pressure, and distance from areas where plants are in commercial production. For example, for preemergent applications clomazone is not to be applied within 1,500 feet of commercial fruit, nut, or vegetable production or commercial greenhouses or nurseries. Clearly, his is a severe limitation on the use of an herbicide.<br>
It is the purpose of the present invention to reduce the volatility of clomazone formulations, so that problem of off-site injury is significantly reduced, i.e., by at least fifty percent, while maintaining a satisfactory level of herbicidal activity in the target area.<br>
Attempts to prepare formulations of encapsulated clomazone by the general methods known to the art, including polyamide shells as well as polyurea, frequently resulted in formulations that not only gave little or no reduction in volatility, but had poor physical characteristics, e.g., undesirable agglomeration of the capsules or separation of phases. Perhaps one factor accounting for the difficulty in preparing satisfactory formulations is the<br><br><br>
-2-<br><br>
significant water solubility of clomazone. No reports of formulations of encapsulated clomazone have been found.<br>
It has now been found that encapsulated formulations of clomazone for which the volatility is reduced to fifty percent or less than that of the commercially available Command® 4 EC emulsifiable concentrate of clomazone, and which retain a satisfactory level of herbicidal activity, can be prepared, provided that the isocyanate and amine moieties that are to form the polyurea shell wall are carefully selected.<br>
The process of the invention involves the following steps: (a) providing an aqueous phase containing an emulsifier, preferably a partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohol; an antifoam agent, and optionally a xanthan gum viscosity modifier/stabilizer; (b) providing a water immiscible phase consisting of clomazone and polymethylene polyphenyl isocyanate, with or without a hydrocarbon solvent; (c) emulsifying the water immiscible phase in the aqueous phase to form a dispersion of water-immiscible droplets throughout the aqueous phase; (d) agitating the dispersion while adding to it, either neat or in aqueous solution, ethylenediamine, diethyltriamine, triethylenetetramine, 1 ,6-hexanediamine, or a mixture of the polyfunctional amines, thus forming a polyurea shell wall around the water-immiscible droplets. Once the microcapsules are formed, the suspension is cured by moderate heating, after which one or more stabilizing agents, such as propylene glycol, xanthan gum, smectite clay, or an ionic dispersing agent such as a sulfonate of an alkyl napthalene, may be added, as is well-known in the art. It has also been found that adjusting the pH of the formulation from mildly acidic to mildly alkaline conditions, such as a range of from 6.5 to 9.0, e.g., pH 8.9, results in a formulation having improved storage stability. The addition of these materials after encapsulation and curing to adjust viscosity and suspensibility is not seen to have any effect on the loss of clomazone through volatility or on the herbicidal efficacy of the formulation.<br>
The aqueous phase will ordinarily contain 0.3 to 3.0, preferably 0.8 to 2.0, weight percent of one or more emulsifiers, e.g., polyvinyl alcohol, 0.05 to<br>
0.20, preferably 0.06 to 0.15, weight percent of the xanthan gum viscosity modifier/stabilizer, if it is used, and 0.1 to 1.0, preferably 0.4 to 0.9, weight percent of the antifoam agent.<br><br><br>
-3-<br><br>
The water-immiscible phase will ordinarily consist of 60 to 85, preferably 65 to 77, weight percent of clomazone, an amount of polymethylene polyphenyl isocyanate (PMPPI) such that the ratio of clomazone to PMPPI is in the range of 1:1 to 6:1, preferably 4.5:1 to 4.8:1, and an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent for the two solutes. However, use of solvent is optional in the preparation of formulations containing more than about two pounds of clomazone per gallon of formulation. In such preparations a small amount of solvent may still be used to depress the melting point.<br>
The amine solution will ordinarily contain 10 to 100, preferably 30 to 40, weight percent of ethylenediamine, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, 1 ,6-hexanediamine, or preferably a mixture of the polyfunctional amines, with ethylene diamine being used only in a mixture.<br>
The emulsification step requires high shear mixing to give small droplets of the immiscible phase. Factors that influence droplet size, which determines the eventual size of the microcapsules, as well as the stability of the emulsion, include speed. and length of mixing, the type and amount of surfactant, solvent, temperature, and viscosity, as well as the xanthan gum, when used. Selection of the appropriate microcapsule size to achieve the purposes of the invention requires a balance between competing factors. In general, increasing microcapsule size decreases volatility, but also decreases suspensibility of the particles, while decreasing size yields better suspensibility, but higher volatility. For the purposes of the present invention the average size of the microcapsules is 5 to 50 microns, preferably 5 to 30 microns. The operating conditions to yield microcapsules of a desired size will depend on the emulsifying equipment used, and the adjustment to determine the proper conditions is well within the skill of the art.<br>
In contrast to the conditions of the emulsification step, agitation during the amine addition should be gentle. Stirring is continued while the suspension is cured by heating to a temperature of 35 to 60, preferably 45 to 50 0C, for 3 to 10, preferably 4 to 5, hours.<br>
The amounts of post encapsulation additives to be added typically<br>
would be selected from one or more of 0.75 to 6.5 wt. % propylene glycol,<br>
0.05 to 0.30 wt. % xanthan gum, 0.25 to 0.50 wt. % smectite clay, and 0.5 to<br>
6.0 wt. % one or more surfactants, each weight percent relative to the weight<br>
of the formulation after addition of the stabilizers.<br><br><br>
-4-<br><br>
The formulations of the present invention are prepared by the methods exemplified in the following examples.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of a Clomazone 1.5 Pound/Gallon<br>
Capsule Suspension (1.5 CS) Formulation (Formulation A)<br><br>
A stock solution of aqueous 20% (weight/weight) partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohol having an average molecular weight of 13,000 to 23,000 (Air-vol® 203) was prepared by stirring and heating the appropriate amounts of polyvinyl alcohol and water at about 80-90 0C for one hour. The cooled solution was stored for later use.<br>
In a one-liter stainless steel beaker were placed 20.0 grams of the aqueous 20% polyvinyl alcohol solution prepared above, 1.8 grams of 100 % of a polydimethyl siloxane antifoam agent (Dow Coming® 1500), 15.0 grams of aqueous 2% xanthan gum (Kelzan® M), and 400.0 grams of water. After this mixture was mixed for 20 seconds at high speed in a high-shear mixer, a pre-blended solution of 140.0 grams of clomazone, 30.0 grams of polymethylene polyphenyl isocyanate (PMPPI, Mondur® MR), and 30.0 grams of petroleum solvent (a mixture of C9-C1 ~ aromatic, naphthalene-depleted, hydrocarbons, flash-point 95 0C, Aromatic 200 ND) was added, and the mixture was emulsified in the high shear mixer for five minutes. The mixture was then placed in a one-liter jacketed resin flask with the jacket pre-heated to 50 0C. The mixture was stirred at a moderate speed with an air-powered stirrer, and a solution of 19.0 grams of triethylenotetramine (TETA) in 35.0 grams of water was added in one portion. The mixture was then stirred at 50 0C for four hours. After this time, 2.5 grams of a smectite clay containing magnesium aluminum silicate, titanium dioxide, and cristobalite (Veegum® Ultra), and 15.0 grams of aqueous 2% xanthan gum (Kelzan® M) were added to stabilize the formulation. The formulation was then stirred for about one hour and stored for later use.<br>
The formulations described in Tables 1 and 2 were prepared in this manner.<br><br><br>
-5-<br><br>
Example 2<br>
Large Scale Preparation of a Clomazone 2.0 Pound/Gallon<br>
Caosule Suspension (2.0 CS) Formulation (Formulation E-1)<br><br>
A solution of 5.24 pounds of polyvinyl alcohol (Airvol 203), 2.38 pounds of an aqueous solution of 20% polydimethyl siloxane antifoam agent (Dow Coming® 1520), and 0.21 pound of xanthan gum viscosity modifier/stabilizer (Kelzan® 5) in 284.20 pounds of water was placed in a 500 gallon stainless steel vessel, and stirred at 80 0C for one hour. After this time the solution was cooled to 20 00 and placed in an 80 gallon batch homogenizer. With the homogenizer in operation, a pre-blended solution of 161.34 pounds of technical clomazone, 34.75 pounds of polymethylene polyphenyl isocyanate (PMPPI, Mondur® MR), and 34.75 pounds of petroleum solvent (a mixture of C9-C1 5 aromatic hydrocarbons, flash-point 95 0C, Aromatic 200) was fed by gravity into the homogenizer during a 15 to 90 second period. The mixture was homogenized for two to three minutes. Upon completion of the homogenization, the mixture was placed in a jacketed reactor with the jacket pre-heated to 50 00. To the jacketed reactor was added, over a period of 30 seconds, an amine mixture consisting of 10.97 pounds of triethylenetetramine (TETA) and 10.97 pounds of 1 ,6-hexanediamine (HDA). After the amine addition was completed, the mixture was cured with agitation at 25 0C to 50 ~C during a four hour period. At the end of the curing period, 35.70 pounds of propylene glycol and 1.19 pounds of xanthan gum were added to stabilize the formulation. The formulation was then cooled to below 30 0C and stored for later use. It had a viscosity of 1870 cps and a suspensibility of 82 %. Both formulations described in Tables 3 and 4 were prepared in the manner of Example 2. Formulation A-i is a larger scale version of Formulation A, and Formulation E-1 is a larger scale version of Formulation E.<br>
Formulation P, a three pound per gallon formulation, the components of which are given in Tables 3 and 4, was prepared by the method of Example 2. In this preparation 0.133 pound of the sodium sulfonated naphthalene condensate was added to the aqueous phase during its preparation. The post encapsulation additives, including the remainder of the sodium sulfonated naphthalene condensate, was added after the curing period at about 35 00, while the formulation continued to mix and cool to<br><br><br>
-6-<br><br><br><br>
ambient temperature. The hydrochloric acid was then added to bring the pH from 10.8 to 8.9.<br>
The currently preferred practice, after the curing step, is to continue stirring the formulation until the temperature reaches about 35 0C, and then to add the hydrochloric acid to bring the pH to about 7.8. The post encapsulation additives, including the remainder of the sodium sulfonated naphthalene condensate, is added, and stirring of the formulation is continued for about 30 minutes to give a homogeneous mixture.<br>
In subsequent preparations of Formulation E by the method of Example 1, certain refinements in the procedure have been found advantageous. Adjusting the pH of the aqueous solution to 4 reduced the undesirable reaction between PMPPI and water, as did cooling the solution to 8-10 0C. Preparations have also been carried out with the clomazone solution and the amine solution, as well as the initial aqueous solution, all cooled to 8-10 0C. However, when there is no solvent in the water-immiscible phase, low temperatures are not used to avoid freezing the clomazone.<br>
Other formulations prepared by the method of Example 1, but differing from the formulations of the invention in the components of either the isocyanate- or amine-containing phase, proved to be unsatisfactory in controlling the volatility of clomazone or in the physical stability of the formulation. The compositions of representative unsatisfactory formulations are given in Table 5. Three of these formulations failed to control the volatility of clomazone adequately, as will be shown below. Formulation 0 was too viscous (6360 cps).<br>
Formulation L is the same as Formulation A of the present invention, except that the polymethylene polyphenyl isocyanate (PMPPI) was replaced with toluene diisocyanate (TDI). TDI is more reactive in water than PMPPI, which causes undesirable side-reactions leading to foaming in the emulsification step of the preparation of this formulation.<br>
Formulation M was an attempt to copy the formulation used successfully in an effective, four pound/gallon, capsule suspension formulation of an insecticide, substituting clomazone for the insecticide. The microcapsules produced were too small, and here, too, TDI caused foaming problems.<br><br><br>
-7-<br><br><br><br>
Formulation N is the same as Formulation A of the present invention except that the xanthan gum viscosity modifier/stabilizer is not used in the emulsification step. Batches of Formulation N prepared in this way gave microcapsules that not only are somewhat small, but are not uniform in size and tend to aggregate. Moreover, the formulation has poor physical stability, resulting in phase separation.<br>
That attaining the desired combination of reduced volatility, physical properties, and efficacy is not achieved simply by following the prior art is shown by two additional preparations. Formulations V and W were prepared by the method of US Patent 4,280,833, Example 8. The composition of these formulations is given in Table 5a. Both formulations separated on standing, forming in the bottom of the container a hard-packed layer, which could be redispersed by shaking. Each gave at least as much release of clomazone as the standard Command® 4 EC Herbicide, when subjected to the laboratory volatility test described below.<br>
The average size of the microcapsules of formulations of the invention, as well as the unsatisfactory formulations, is given in Table 6.<br><br>
Volatility Studies<br><br>
Laboratory tests for the volatility of capsule suspension (CS) formulations of clomazone were carried out in the following manner. Sufficient unsterilized topsoil to conduct the test was passed twice through a 14-mesh sieve to remove large particles and debris. The tine particles were then removed through a 30-mesh sieve, leaving behind topsoil of intermediate-sized particles. This intermediate-sized topsoil, 240 grams, was spread uniformly to a thickness of about one to two millimeters over an area of about 27.9 cm. x 41.3 cm in a tray measuring 32.4 cm x 45.7 x 1.9 cm. The topsoil was then sprayed from an overhead track sprayer calibrated to deliver 20 gallons of water per acre. The spray mix consisted of sufficient clomazone test formulation to provide 0.0712 gm of active ingredient in 20 mL of water. In this manner the clomazone test formulation was applied to the soil at a rate of 1.0 kg a.i. (active ingredient)/ha. Immediately after treatment, the soil was enclosed in a glass jar, where it remained briefly until used.<br><br><br>
-8-<br><br>
For each clomazone test formulation, four 22 mm X 300 mm glass chromatography columns, each containing a coarse sintered glass barrier at the bottom, were connected through their bottom ends to a multi-port air manifold, which delivered equal air pressure simultaneously to a number of columns. In each of the four columns was placed 59 gins of the treated topsoil, which filled about 200 mm of the column length. In the top of each column was then placed a polyurethane foam plug designed to fit inside a 21 to 26 mm diameter tube. As soon after the soil treatment as the columns could be set up, a slow stream of air (0.75-1.00 liter per minute per column) from the multi-port air manifold was passed through the soil in each column, causing the volatilized clomazone to collect on the polyurethane foam plug. The time between the soil treatment and the start of the air flow was about one hour. The air flow was continued for about 18 hours.<br>
Following the 18 hour collection period, the polyurethane foam plug from each column was placed in a 20 mL plastic syringe. The polyurethane foam plug was thoroughly extracted by drawing 15 mL of methanol into the syringe and through the plug, forcing the methanol extract into a beaker, and repeating the process several times. A 0.04 mL aliquot of the 15 mL sample was diluted with 0.96 mL of methanol and 1.0 mL of water. A 0.1 mL aliquot of this solution was analyzed for clomazone content using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a method reported by R. V. Darger et al. (J. Agr. and Food Chem., 1991, 39, 813-819). The total clomazone content of the foam plug, expressed in micrograms, of each sample was recorded and compared to the clomazone content of the sample from the standard, Command® 4 EC Herbicide.<br>
The test results, given in Table 7, show that the CS formulations of the present invention are effective in reducing the amount of clomazone lost by volatility. While all of the formulations listed gave a significant reduction in volatility, the results for Formulations E and F, prepared from mixtures of TETA and HDA, are particularly noteworthy, losing only 8% and 10%, respectively, as much clomazone as was lost from the standard 4 EC. The 2.0 lb/gal formulations made from the single polyfunctional amines, Formulation B from TETA and Formulation D from HDA, each lost more than twice as much clomazone as did the formulations prepared from mixtures. Also, Formulations G and H each had less volatility loss than that of either<br><br><br>
-9-<br><br><br>
HDA or DETA alone (Formulations D and K). Accordingly, in the preparation of the formulations of this invention, the use of mixtures of DETA or TETA or both with HDA, particularly in ratios of 3:1 to 1:3, give unexpectedly superior reduction of volatility. Mixtures of TETA and EDA give volatility lower than that of TETA alone. However, it should be noted that Formulation P, a 3 lb/gal formulation, with DETA alone, gave as much reduction in volatility as Formulations G and H.<br>
The unsatisfactory formulations L, M, and N are clearly far less effective in reducing the volatility of clomazone. The high volatility loss for Formulation L (91% of that lost by the standard clomazone 4.0 EC) suggests that the polymeric walls formed from triethylenetetramine (TETA) and TDI are too permeable, allowing the clomazone to volatilize and the walls formed from PMPPI and TETA or PMPPI in combination with TETA and 1 ,6-hexanediamine (HDA) are much less permeable, so that clomazone loss from volatility is much reduced. Formulation M, which gives excellent results when the active ingredient is a less water-soluble insecticide, is totally unacceptable for clomazone, giving volatility equal to that of the standard clomazone 4.0 EC. The difference between Formulations A and N in reducing the loss of clomazone through volatility is particularly surprising, inasmuch as the only difference is the absence of xanthan gum in the aqueous solution prior to encapsulation in Formulation N. The function of xanthan gum seems unpredictable, however, since the only difference between Formulations K and O is the presence of xanthan gum in the aqueous solution prior to encapsulation in K. These two formulations have the same volatility loss, but the viscosity of Formulation K is 3640 cps, while that of 0 is 6360! No discernible difference has been found between Kelzan® M and Kelzan S xanthan gum in the aqueous phase prior to encapsulation in their effect on the formulations.<br>
Formulations V and W, based on the an earlier patent, were no better than the 4 EC formulation in controlling volatility.<br>
Tests to determine the volatility of clomazone CS formulations in the field relative to that of the standard, Command® 4 EC Herbicide were carried out as follows. One trial on Formulation A-i was conducted in a field of two-week old sunflowers, a plant species susceptible to clomazone. Plots were established on a 12 X 14 meter grid. Each plot was prepared by removing the sunflower seedlings and other vegetation from areas about 60 cm in diameter<br><br><br>
-10-<br><br>
located at the intersections of the grid lines. The grid lines were 12 meters apart in one direction and 14 meters apart in the perpendicular direction. The edge of one replicate was at least 12 meters from the edge of the next replicate, a distance sufficient to prevent interference between replicates. Over each plot where the soil was exposed was placed a 60 cm diameter, open-ended barrel that was lined with a plastic sleeve fashioned from a trash can liner. Each plot was sprayed with 10-15 mL of an aqueous dispersion containing 0.12 gram of active ingredient. To minimize the drift of clomazone, the spraying was conducted inside the barrel using a hand-held sprayer. Upon completion of each application, the barrel was left in place, and the top was covered for about two to three minutes to allow the spray to settle to the soil surface. The barrel was then removed, leaving each plot open to ambient conditions. There were three to four replicates for each test formulation. To prevent cross-contamination, the plastic sleeve was replaced before applying each new test formulation. The test was evaluated at seven days after treatment by measuring the distance from the center of each plot to, first, the most distant point where discoloration of the sunflowers could be found, then at 450 intervals around the center of the plot. The area of discoloration of the sunflowers was calculated, and the area of the direct treatment was subtracted to provide the area affected by the volatility of clomazone.<br>
A second test on Formulation A-i was carried out in the same manner in a second field of sunflowers, this time with a 44 cm barrel and on a 14 X 14 meter grid. The total areas affected by clomazone movement from each test site for each test formulation and the standard comazone 4.0 EC formulation were determined. From these data a percent reduction of area discolored by clomazone as compared to the standard Command® 4 EC was calculated for each test formulation.<br>
A third test, this time with Formulation P, was a series of tests, carried out in different geographic locations having different environmental and soil conditions. At each location a three acre plot was planted with sunflowers. The clomazone formulations were applied to a 10' X 10' bare ground plot when the sunflowers had reached the 2-6 leaf stage. Prerequisite conditions for application were that the soil be moist, but not saturated, to facilitate volatilization. Evaluations were made 7-10 days after application and 10-14 days after the first significant rainfall event by means of the same general method<br><br><br>
—11—<br><br>
described for the first test. The areas given are totals for all sites; the percent<br>
reduction is an average of those from all sites. The test results, given in Table 8, show that Formulation A-i reduced by one half the area affected by clomazone compared to Command 4 EC, and Formulation P was significantly more effective in reducing volatility..<br>
Efficacy Studies<br>
Seeds of bamyardgrass (Echinochloa crusgalh), giant foxtail (Setaria faben), yellow foxtail (Setaria lutescens), shattercane (Sorghum bicolo,), and velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasli) were planted in a 25 cm x 15 cm x 7.5 cm fiber flat containing topsoil. Each species was planted as a single row in the flat, which contained five rows. There were four replicate flats of plants for each rate of application of test formulation. Stock dispersions of each of the test formulations were prepared by dispersing a sufficient amount of formulation to provide 0.0356 gram of active ingredient in 40 mL of water. From the stock dispersion 20 mL was removed and serially diluted with 20 mL of water to provide application rates of 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.0313, 0.0156, and 0.0078 kg. a.i./ha. The dispersions of test formulation for each rate of application were then sprayed onto the surface of the soil by a track-sprayer in a sprayhood. Flats were also sprayed as above with the same rates of the standard Command® 4 EC Herbicide. Untreated controls were also included in each test. Upon completion of the spraying the flats were placed in a greenhouse, where they were maintained for fourteen days. After this time the test was visually evaluated for percent weed control. The percent weed control data for each test formulation and the Ccrnmand 4 EC Herbicide formulation was subjected to regression analysis to determine the rate of application that would provide 85% weed control (ED85) of each of the weed species. From these data the relative potencies of the test formulations (the relative potency of the Command 4 EC Herbicide is 1.0) were determined by means of the following ratio:<br><br>
Formulation ED85<br>
Formulation Relative Potency = Command Herbicide ED55<br><br><br>
The test results shown in Table 9 show relatively poor performance for<br>
Formulation E in the greenhouse. As shown below, performance of<br>
Formulation E in the field was excellent. The reason for the difference<br><br><br>
- 12-<br><br>
between greenhouse and field performance is not understood. However, the greenhouse performance of Formulation P was excellent, as was performance in the field, as shown below."<br>
In a field test of the efficacy of Formulation A-i the test formulations were sprayed onto the surface of the soil (preemergence) at an application rate of 1.0 pound a.i./acre in 12.7 X 30 foot plots planted with cotton and weed seeds. There were four replicate plots for each formulation tested. The test formulation was applied by means of a backpack sprayer, equipped with flat fan spray nozzles, at a delivery volume of 15-20 gallons/acre and at a spray pressure of 28-30 psi. The plots were evaluated for percent weed control at 15 and 30 days after emergence of the plant species in the test. The cotton plants were evaluated for bleaching, stunting, and stand reduction. Test results, given in Table 10, show this CS formulation to be slightly less effective against three of the four test species and essentially equivalent to the 4 EC in effects on cotton. (The similarity in effect on cotton is not unexpected, since this test is the result of direct application and does not involve movement to an adjacent site.)<br>
In a field test of Formulation E the test formulations were sprayed onto the surface of the soil (preemergence) at application rates of 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 pound a.i./acre in 6.7 X 12 foot plots planted with eight different plant species. There were four replicate plots for each formulation tested. The test formulations were applied using a backpack sprayer, equipped with four flat fan spray nozzles, at a delivery volume of 20 gallons/acre and at a spray pressure of 25 psi. The plots were evaluated for percent control 20 days after treatment. The data in Table 11 show that this CS formulation at 0.5 pound active ingredient per acre is giving commercial control, defined as at least 80 to 85 percent control of all species, everywhere the standard is giving commercial control, except for shattercane at 0.5 lb/A, which falls slightly below the percentage goal for control.<br>
Table 12 reports results of a field test of Formulation P and the 4 EC formulation in which both formulations were applied at 0.88 lb/A, preemergence. It is apparent that in most cases where the 4 EC formulation is giving commercial control, Formulation P is also. Again, the effect of the encapsulated formulation P on cotton is negligible.<br><br><br>

As noted above, the stabilizers added after encapsulation and curing are thought to have no effect on the volatility or the efficacy of the formulation. They are added to stabilize the formulation and adjust the viscosity. It is prefer-ed that each formulation of this invention have a suspensibility of greater than 70%, a viscosity of 1700 to 3800 cps, and a 100 mesh wet screen analysis of greater than 99.95%.<br><br>
It is understood that there may be variations from the specific embodiments described herein without departing from the spirit or concept of the present invention as defined in the claims. Included in such variations are mixtures in which the encapsulated clomazone of this invention is part of a mixture with one or more other herbicides, e.g., flumeturon or sulfentrazone, whether or not encapsulated.<br><br><br>
