ACTIVE-DRIVING ORGANIC EL LIGHT EMISSION DEVICE AND<br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THE SAME<br>
Background of the Invention Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an active-driving organic EL light emission device (which may be referred to merely as an organic EL device hereinafter) having a thin film transistor (which may be referred to as a TFT) . More specifically, the present invention relates to an organic EL device used suitably for display equipment and color displays for the people's livelihood and industries, and the like.<br>
In the present specification, the description "EL" means "electroluminescence".<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Conventionally, it is known a simple-driving organic EL light emission device which is simply driven by XY matrix electrodes to display an image (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No, 37385/1990, JP-A No. 233891/1991 and the like) as an organic EL light emission device (display),<br>
However, in such a simple-driving organic EL light emission device, the so-called line sequential driving<br><br>
is performed.  Therefore, if the number of scanning lines is several hundreds, required instantaneous brightness is several-hundred times larger than observed brightness so that the following problems arise -<br>
(1)	Since a driving voltage becomes not less than 2-3 times higher than a direct-current constant voltage, luminous efficiency drops or power consumption becomes large•<br>
(2)	Since the electrical current that passes instantaneously becomes several-hundred times larger, the organic luminous layer is apt to deteriorate.<br>
(3)	Since the electrical current is very large in the same manner as in the (2), a voltage-drop in the electrode wiring becomes large.<br>
Thus, in order to solve the problems that simple-driving organic EL light emission devices have, various active-driving organic EL light emission devices, wherein organic EL elements are driven by TFTs (thin film transistors), are suggested (JP-A No. 122360/1995, JP-A No. 122361/1995, JP-A No-/153576/1995, JP-ANo. 54836/1996, JP-ANo. 111341/1995, JP-A No. 312290/1995, JP-A No. 109370/1996, JP-A No. 129359/1996, JP-ANo. 241047/1996, JP-ANo. 227276/1996, JP-A No. 339968/1999, and the like).<br>
Examples of the structure of such an active-driving organic EL light emission device are shown in FIGs. 18<br><br>
and 19 -  According to such active-driving organic EL light emission devices, it is possible to obtain advantages as follows : driving voltage is highly lowered, luminous efficiency is Improved and power consumption can be reduced, as compared with simple-driving organic EL light emission devices.<br>
However, the following problems (1)"(3) are caused even in active-driving organic EL light emission devices having advantageous as described above.<br>
(1) The aperture ratio of their pixels becomes small.<br>
In an active-driving organic EL light emission device, at least one TFT is fitted to each pixel on a transparent substrate and further a great deal of scanning electrode lines and signal electrode lines are disposed on the substrate to select appropriate TFTs and drive them.  Accordingly, there arises a problem that when light Is taken out from the side of the transparent substrate, the aperture ratio of the pixels (the ratio of portions that emits light actually in the pixels) becomes small since the TFTs and the various electrode lines shut off the light.  For example, in an active-driving organic EL light emission device that has been developed recently, TFTs for driving organic EL elements at a constant current are disposed besides the above-mentioned two kinds of TFTs,  Therefore, its aperture ratio becomes smaller and smaller (about 30%<br><br>
or less) .  As a result, dependently on the aperture ratio, the current density that passes through the organic luminous medium becomes large, causing a problem that the life span of the organic EL elements is shortened.<br>
This matter will be described in more detail, referring to FIGs , 10, 11 and 18 .  FIG- 10 shows a diagram of a circuit for switch-driving the active-driving organic EL light emission device 100 illustrated in FIG. 18, and illustrates a state that gate lines (scanning electrode lines) 50 (108 in FIG. 18) and source lines (signal electrode lines) 51 are formed on the substrate and they are in an XY matrix form.  Common electrode lines 52 are disposed in parallel to the source lines (signal electrode lines) 51.  About each pixel, a first TFT 55 and a second TFT 56 are fitted to the gate lines 50 and the source lines 51.  A capacitance 57 is connected between the gate of the second TFT 5 6 and the common electrode line 52 to hold the gate voltage at a constant value.<br>
Therefore, an organic EL element 26 can be effectively driven by applying the voltage held by the capacitance 57 to the gate of the second TFT 56 shown in the circuit diagram of FIG. 10 and then attaining switching.<br>
The plan view shown in FIG. 11 is a view obtained by seeing, along the plane direction, through switch portions and the like according to the circuit diagram<br><br>
shown in FIG- 10.<br>
Thus, the active-driving organic EL light emission device 100 has a problem that when EL light is taken out from the side of lower electrodes (ITO, indium tin oxide) 102 side, that is, the side of a substrate 104 side, a TFT 106, a gate line 108, a source line (not illustrated) and the like shut off EL light so that the aperture ratio of pixels becomes small.<br>
In an active-driving organic EL light emission device 204, as shown in FIG. 19, wherein a TFT 200 and an organic EL element 202 are arranged on the same plane, the TFT 200 and the like never block off EL light. However, its aperture ratio of pixels is further lowered, as compared with the active-driving organic EL light emission device 100 shown in FIG. 18.<br>
(2) The sheet resistivity of upper electrodes Is large.<br>
In the case that light is taken out from the side opposite to the substrate, that is, the side of upper electrodes, the TFTs and the like do not shut off the light to keep the aperture ratio large. As a result, a high-brightness image can be obtained. However, when EL light is taken out from the upper electrode side, in order to take out the EL light effectively to the outside, it is necessary to form the upper electrodes from transparent conductive material. For this reason, the sheet resistivity of the upper electrodes exceeds, for<br><br>
example, 20 Ω/, resulting in a serious problem at the time of using large-area display.<br>
In the case that light is emitted, for example, at a brightness of 300 nit from the entire surface of an EL light emission device having a diagonal size of 20 inches (the ratio of length to breadth, 3:4), it is necessary to send a large current having a current of 3600 mA to the upper electrodes even if an organic luminous material having a high luminous efficiency of 10 cd/A (luminous power per unit amperage) is used in the organic luminous medium.<br>
More specifically, the value of a voltage-drop based on the resistances of the upper electrodes is represented by 2nir and calculated on the following formula,<br>
2nir = 1/2 x N(N + 1)ir<br>
N: (the total number of pixels in the longitudinal direction) x 1/2,<br>
r: the ohmic value (Q) of the upper electrode in each pixel, and<br>
i: a constant current value(A) that flows through each pixel.<br>
Therefore, if luminous efficiency, luminous brightness, the shape of the pixels and the sheet resistivity of the upper electrodes are set to, for example, 10 cd/A, 300 nit, 200 x 600 µm square, and 20 Ω/, respectively, the pixel current value is 3,6 x 10-6<br><br>
A. If the total number of the pixels in the longitudinal direction is set to 2000, drop-voltage in the longitudinal direction is 12V (1/2 x 1000 x 1000 x 3.6 X 10-6 X 20 X 1/3). This exceeds an allowable voltage range (10 V) for driving circuits which are driven at a constant current. Thus, it is difficult to emit light under the above-mentioned conditions.<br>
In short, if the sheet resistivity of the upper electrodes is large, voltage-drop, particularly at the center of the screen, becomes large accordingly. As a result, a problem that brightness is remarkably lowered becomes apparent. Incidentally, the following is also attempted: amendment Is made by using a circuit to make a current value (brightness) constant for each pixel. However, this attempt is insufficient•<br>
(3) From the viewpoint of production, it is difficult to control the ohmic value of the upper electrodes.<br>
It is known that in order to set the resistivity of the upper electrodes of an active-driving organic EL light emission device having a diagonal size of several inches to 10 inches to a low value, for example, 1 x 10-3 Ω• cm or less by using an ordinary material such as ITO or ZnO, it is necessary to set heating temperature to 200°C or higher- However, heat-resistance of ordinary organic luminous media is 200°C or lower. Thus, it is necessary to set the heating temperature to 200°C or<br><br>
lower. Accordingly, the value of the resistivity of the upper electrodes cannot be controlled so that the value may exceed 1 x 10-3 Ω Ccm. As a result, a problem that the sheet resistivity becomes a high value over 20 Ω/  occurs. In the case that plasma is used for sputtering at the time of forming an oxide such as ITO or IZO on the organic luminous medium to form the upper electrodes, a problem that the organic luminous medium is damaged by the plasma also arises.<br>
In light of the above-mentioned problems, the present invention has been made.  Its object is to provide an organic active EL light emission device making it possible to increase the aperture ratio of respective pixels even if TFTs are disposed to drive organic EL elements, reduce the sheet resistivity of upper electrodes even if luminescence is taken out from the side of the upper electrodes, and display an image having a high brightness and a homogeneous brightness; and a method for manufacturing such an organic active EL light emission device effectively.<br>

Specifically, it is preferred to set the water content of the supporting substrate and the gas permeability coefficient thereof to 0.0001% or less by weight, and 1 x 10-13 cc • cm/cm2. sec, cmHg or less, respectively.<br>
In order to take out EL light from the side opposite to the substrate, that is, the side of the upper<br><br>
electrodes in the present invention, the substrate does not necessarily needs to have transparency.<br>
2. Organic EL element<br>
(1) Organic luminous medium<br>
The organic luminous medium can be defined as a medium comprising an organic luminous layer wherein an electron and a hole are recombined with each other so that EL light can be emitted. Such an organic luminous medium can be made, for example, by laminating the following respective layers on an anode.<br>
1 organic luminous layer<br>
hole injection layer/organic luminous layer organic luminous layer/electron injection layer hole injection layer/organic luminous layer/electron injection layer<br>
5 organic semiconductor layer/organic luminous layer<br>
6 organic semiconductor layer/electron barrier layer/organic luminous layer<br>
(7) hole injection layer/organic luminous layer/adhesion improving layer<br>
Among these structures, the structure of the® is preferably used in ordinary cases since the structure makes it possible to give a higher luminous brightness and is superior in endurance. (D Constituent material<br><br>
The luminous material in the organic luminous medium may be one or a combination of two or more selected from p-quarterphenyl derivatives, p-quinquephenyl derivatives, benzothiazole compounds, benzoimidazole compounds, benozoxazole compounds, metal-chelated oxinoid compounds, oxadiazole compounds, styrylbenzene compounds, distyrylpyrazine derivatives, butadiene compounds, naphthalimide compounds, perylene derivatives, aldazine derivatives, pyrazyline derivatives, cyclopentadiene derivatives, pyrrolopyrrole derivatives, styrylamine derivatives, coumalin compounds, aromatic dimethylidene compounds, metal complexes having an 8-quinolinol derivative as a ligand, and polyphenyl compounds.<br>
Among these organic luminous materials, more preferred are 4,4'--bis(2,2-di-t-<br>
butylphenylvinyl)biphenyl (abbreviated to DTBPBBi), 4,4'-bis(2,2-diphenylvlnyl)biphenyl (abbreviated to DPVBi) and derivatives thereof as the aromatic dimethylidene compounds•<br>
It is also preferred to use a material wherein an organic luminous material having a distyrylarylene skeleton and the like, as a host material, is doped with an intensely fluorescent colorant having a color in from blue to red, as a dopant, for example, a coumalin type material or a fluorescent colorant that is equivalent to the host.  More specifically, it is preferred to use<br><br>
the above-mentioned DPVBi and the like, as the host material, and 1,4-bis[{4-N,N'-<br>
diphenylamino}styryl]benzene (abbreviated to DPAVB), as the dopant,<br>
It is preferred to use, for the hole injection layer in the organic luminous medium, a compound having a hole mobility of 1 x 10-6 cm2/v • second or more and an ionization energy of 5.5 eV or less. The hole mobility is measured in the case that a voltage of 1 x 104 to 1 X 106 V/cm is applied thereto. The deposit of such a hole injection layer makes injection of holes into the organic luminous layer satisfactory so that high luminous brightness can be obtained or low-voltage driving can be attained.<br>
Specific examples of the constituent material of such a hole injection layer include organic compounds such as porphyrin compounds, aromatic tertiary amine compounds, styryl amine compounds, aromatic dimethylidene compounds, and condensed aromatic ring compounds, for example, 4,4'-bis[N-(1-naphtyl)-N-phenylamino]biphenyl (abbreviated to NPD) and 4,4' ,4'-tris[N-(3-methylphenyl)-N-phenylamino]triphenylamine (abbreviated to MTDATA).<br>
As the constituent material of the hole injection layer, an inorganic compound such as p-type Si or p-type SiC is preferably used.<br>
An organic semiconductor layer having a<br><br>
conductivity of 1 x 10-10 S/cm or more is preferably arranged between the hole injection layer and an anode layer, or between the hole injection layer and the organic luminous layer.  The arrangement of such an organic semiconductor layer makes injection of the holes into the organic luminous layer more satisfactory.<br>
It is also preferred to use, for the electron injection layer in the organic luminous medium, a compound having an electron mobility of 1 x 10-6 cm2/V <br>
second or more and an ionization energy of more than 5.5 eV.  The electron mobility is measured in the case that a voltage of 1 x 1010-4 to 1 x 1010-6 V/cm is applied thereto. Deposit of such an electron injection layer makes injection of electrons into the organic luminous layer satisfactory so that high luminous brightness can be obtained or low-voltage driving can be attained.<br>
Specific example of the constituent material of such an electron injection layer include a metal complex of 8-hydroxyquinoline (Al chelate: Alq), derivatives thereof or oxazole derivatives and the like.<br>
The adhesion improving layer in the organic luminous medium may be regarded as one form of the electron injection layer, that is, a layer which is one of the electron injection layers and is made of a material that is particularly good in adhesiveness to the cathode. This layer is preferably made of a metal complex of 8-hydroxyquinoline, a derivative thereof and the like.<br><br>
It is also preferred to deposit an organic semiconductor layer having a conductivity of 1 x 1010-10 S/cm or more to contact the electron injection layer. The deposit of such an organic semiconductor layer makes the injection of electrons into the organic luminous layer more satisfactory. Thickness<br>
The thickness of the organic luminous medium is not particularly limited.  It is preferred to set the thickness to a value within the range of, for example, 5 nm to 5 \xm.<br>
The reason for this is as follows . If the thickness of the organic luminous medium is below 5 nm, luminous brightness or endurance may be lowered. On the other hand, if the thickness of the organic luminous medium is over 5 µm,  the value of applied voltage may be raised.<br>
Accordingly, the thickness of the organic luminous medium is preferably set to a value within the range of 10 nm to 3µm,   and more preferably set to a value within the range of 20 nm to 1 fim. (2) Upper electrodes ® Structure 1<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, in the first embodiment, the upper electrode 20 is characterized by being composed of the main electrode 16 comprising transparent conductive material, and the auxiliary electrode 18 comprising low-resistance material.<br><br>
The sheet resistivity of the upper electrode 20 can be remarkably reduced by arranging not only the main electrode 16 but also the auxiliary electrode 18 comprising low-resistance material in the above-mentioned manner.  Therefore, the organic EL element 26 can be driven at a low voltage and power consumption can be reduced.<br>
The main electrode 16 shown in FIG. 1 is made of transparent conductive material, for example, a material having a transmissivity of 10% or more and preferably having a transmissivity of 60% or more. Therefore, EL light can be effectively taken out through the main electrode 16 to the outside.  Thus, even if the TFT 14 and the like are set up, the aperture ratio of the pixels 31 can be made large, (2) Structure 2<br>
As shown in FIGs . 13 to 15, about the structure of the auxiliary electrode 18 in the upper electrode 20, the auxiliary electrode 18 is preferably composed of an upper auxiliary electrode 17 and a lower auxiliary electrode 19.<br>
Such a structure makes it possible to connect the lower auxiliary electrode 19 electrically to the main electrode 16 even if the upper auxiliary electrode 17 is electrically insulated. Contrarily, even if the lower auxiliary electrode 19 is electrically insulated, the upper electrode 17 can be connected electrically to<br><br>
the main electrode 16.<br>
Such a structure also makes it possible to use different constituent materials to make the respective electrodes.  Therefore, the electrical connection between the auxiliary electrode 18 and the main electrode 16 is made more certain.  In the case that the main electrode 16 is electrically connected to the upper auxiliary electrode 17 comprising a metal material through the lower auxiliary electrode 19 comprising a semiconductor material having relatively good capability of connecting any transparent oxide conductive material as well as any metal, for example, an indium zinc oxide (IZO) as an amorphous inorganic oxide, the electrical connection between the auxiliary electrode 18 and the main electrode 16 is made more certain than, for example, in the case that the main electrode 16 comprising a transparent oxide conductive material is electrically connected directly to the auxiliary electrode 18 comprising a metal material.<br>
Furthermore, such a structure makes it possible to use constituent materials having different etching properties to make the respective auxiliary electrodes. Therefore, the sectional shape of the auxiliary electrode 18 can easily be made into an overhang form as described below. Structure 3<br>
As shown in FIGs. 13 to 16, about the structure of<br><br>
the auxiliary electrode 18 in the upper electrode 20, the sectional shape of the auxiliary electrode 18 is preferably made into an overhang form.<br>
The reason for this is that the auxiliary electrode can be electrically connected to the main electrode 16 through the overhanging lower portion even if an insulating film is deposited on the auxiliary electrode 18,<br>
Specifically, if after the formation of the auxiliary electrode 18 an insulating film or an organic luminous medium is formed by vapor deposition and the like and further the main electrode 16 is formed, the insulating film covers the auxiliary electrode 18 so that it may become difficult to connect the auxiliary electrode 18 electrically to the main electrode 16•<br>
On the other hand, in the case that the sectional shape of the auxiliary electrode 18 is in the overhang form, an insulating film, even when being deposited by vapor-deposition and the like, is not easily adhered to the side of the auxiliary electrode 18 . Using this naked side of the auxiliary electrode 18, electrical connection to the main electrode 16 can be made sure.<br>
For example, in FIG. 14, the upper electrode 17 is electrically insulated by the organic luminous medium 24 and the like while the lower electrode 19 is electrically connected to the main electrode 16,  This demonstrates connection-easiness of the auxiliary<br><br>
electrode 18 originating from this structure.<br>
The sectional shape of the auxiliary electrode 18 can easily be made into an overhang form by composing the auxiliary electrode 18 of the lower and upper electrodes 19 and 17 and making the two electrodes 19 and 17 from constituent materials having different etching rates-  Specifically, it is preferred to make the lower auxiliary electrode 19 from a metal material such as Al or Al alloy, and make the upper auxiliary electrode 17 from a non-metal material such as silica, alumina. Si nitride, Cr nitride, Ta nitride or W nitride.<br>
The lower auxiliary electrode 19 and the upper auxiliary electrode 17 are made from, for example, Al and Cr, respectively, and Cr is etched with an ammonium cerium nitrate solution in a photolithographic manner. Thereafter, Al is further etched with a mixed solution of phosphoric acid, nitric acid, and acetic acid, so that only Al of the lower auxiliary electrode 19 is over-etched.  Thus, an overhang can easily be obtained.<br>
Examples of such an overhang are shown in FIGs . 13 to 16 •  The overhang may have various shapes.  It is allowable to use the auxiliary electrode 18 in an overhang form having a bilayer structure composed of the lower auxiliary electrode 19 and the upper auxiliary electrode 17, and as shown in FIG, 16(e), an auxiliary electrode 18 in an overhang form having a three-layer structure.<br><br>
Arrows in FIGs. 13 to 16 represent the projecting direction of the overhangs. Structure 4<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, about the structure of the auxiliary electrodes 18 in the upper electrode 20, it is preferred that the auxiliary electrodes 18, when are viewed from the above, are regularly placed in a plane.<br>
This makes it possible to make the ohmic value of the upper electrodes highly and uniformly low.  The regularly placement of the auxiliary electrodes 18 makes the production thereof easy. Structure 5<br>
As shown in FIGs. 1 and 2, about the structure of the auxiliary electrodes 18 in the upper electrode 20, it is preferred that the auxiliary electrode 18, when viewed from the above, is arranged between the lower auxiliary electrodes 2 2 adjacent to each other. This is demonstrated by, for example, arrangement of the auxiliary electrode 18 between adjacent pixels 31 drawn by dot lines in FIG. 2.<br>
In short, such arrangement of the auxiliary electrode 18 makes it possible to obtain a higher luminous brightness without making the numerical aperture of the pixels 31 narrow.<br>
It is preferred as another arrangement of the auxiliary electrodes 18 that in the case that a color filter or a fluorescent film 60 shown in FIG. 5 is<br><br>
arranged and further a black matrix (light shading portions) is arranged in perpendicular direction positions corresponding to the gaps between lower electrodes 22, the auxiliary electrodes 18 are arranged in the manner that the light shading portion of the black matrix and the auxiliary electrode overlap with each other in the perpendicular direction.<br>
Such a structure does not make the aperture ratio of pixels narrow even if the black matrix is arranged and makes it possible to prevent reflection light on the auxiliary electrodes effectively. Structure 6<br>
As shown in FIGs. 1 and 2, about the structure of the auxiliary electrodes 18 in the upper electrode 20, it is preferred that the auxiliary electrodes 18 are deposited on the electrically insulating film 12 for insulating the TFTs 14 and the interlayer insulating film (flattening film) 13, or either one of the insulating film 12 or 13.<br>
Such a structure makes it possible to reduce electric capacity made between the auxiliary electrode and wiring related to the TFT.  Thus, switching operation of the organic EL elements can become fast.<br>
Further, as shown in FIG, 3, as another arrangement of the auxiliary electrodes 18, it is preferred that an electrically insulating film 25, which is different from the interlayer insulating film 13, is arranged between<br><br>
adjacent lower electrodes 22 and the auxiliary electrodes 18 are formed on the insulating film 25.<br>
Such a structure makes it possible to reduce a short circuit between the lower electrode 2 2 and the upper electrode 20 that is caused in a step of the lower electrode 22, or a leakage.  Thus, image defects can be reduced.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6, as the arrangement of the auxiliary electrodes 18, it is preferred that the auxiliary electrodes 18 are formed on the main electrodes 16 and the area of the auxiliary electrodes 18 is made smaller than that of the main electrodes 16.<br>
Such a structure does not make the aperture ratio of pixels narrow, and makes it easy to form the auxiliary electrodes and adjust the sheet resistivity of the auxiliary electrodes.<br>
Needles to say, the structure 6 about the arrangement relative to the xnterlayer xnsulatxng film and the like satisfies the arrangement of the structure 5 since the auxiliary electrode 18 is arranged between the adjacent lower electrodes 22. ® Constituent material 1<br>
The upper electrode 20 (the main electrode 16 and the auxiliary electrode 18) in FIG- 1 and the like corresponds to an anode layer or a cathode layer dependently on the structure of the organic EL element. In the case of the anode layer, a constituent material<br><br>
having a large work function, for example, a work function of 4.0 eV or more is preferably used since holes are easily injected therein. In the case of the cathode layer, a constituent material having a small work function, for example, a work function of less than 4.0 eV is preferably used since electrons are easily injected therein.<br>
On the other hand, in order to take out luminescence to the outside in the first embodiment, it is essential that the constituent material of the main electrode 16 in the upper electrode 20 has given transparency.<br>
Thus, in the case that the upper electrode 20 corresponds to the anode layer, the constituent material of the main electrode 16 may be specifically one or a combination of two or more selected from indium tin oxide (ITO), indium zinc oxide (IZO), copper iodide (Cul), tinoxide (SnOj), zinc oxide (ZnO), antimony oxide (SbjOa, Sb2O4, and Sb2O5), aluminum oxide (Al2O3) and the like.<br>
In order to make the resistance of the main electrode 16 low without damaging the transparency thereof, it is preferred to add one or a combination of two ore more selected from Pt, Au, Ni, Mo, W, Cr, Ta, Al metal and the like in the form of the thin film.<br>
In the first embodiment, the sheet resistivity of the upper electrode 20 can be reduced by not only the transparent material but also the auxiliary electrode 18,  For the main electrode 16, therefore, at least one<br><br>
constituent material can be selected from light transparent metal films , non-degenerate semiconductors , organic conductors, semiconductive carbon compounds and the like.<br>
For example, for the organic conductor, preferred is a conductive conjugated polymer, an oxidizing agent-added polymer, a reducing agent-added polymer, an oxidizing agent-added low-molecule, or a reducing agent-added low-molecule•<br>
The oxidizing agent added to the organic conductor may be a Lewis acid such as iron chloride, antimony chloride or aluminum chloride. The reducing agent added to the organic conductor may be an alkali metal, an alkali earth metal, a rare earth metal, an alkali compound, an alkali earth compound, a rare earth metal compound, and the like. The conductive conjugated polymer may be polyaniliine or a derivative thereof, polythiophene or a derivative, a Lewis acid added amine compound layer, and the like.<br>
Preferred specific examples of the non-degenerate semiconductor include oxides, nitrides, and chalcogenide compounds.<br>
Preferred specific examples of the carbon compound include amorphous C, graphite, and diamond-like C.<br>
Preferred specific examples of the inorganic semiconductor include ZnS, ZnSe, ZnSSe, MgS, MgSSe, CdS, CdSe, CdTe and CdSSe and the like.<br><br>
Constituent material 2<br>
It is necessary that the auxiliary electrode 18 shown in FIG. 1 and the like is made of low-resistance material.  It is preferred to use low-resistance material having a specific resistance within the range of, for example, 1 x 10'^ to 1 x lO'^ Q'   cm.<br>
The reason for this is as follows,  A material having a specific resistance of less than 1 x lO'^ Q ' cm cannot be easily realized.  On the other hand, if the specific resistance is over 1 x 10-3 Ω cm, it may be difficult to make the resistance of the upper electrode low.<br>
Therefore, the specific resistance of the low^ resistance material constituting the auxiliary electrode is more preferably set to a value within the range of 2 x 10-5  to 5 x 10-5 Ω  • cm, and still more preferably set to a value within the range of 2 x lo"^ to 1 X 10"* Q • cm.<br>
The sheet resistivity of the auxiliary electrode 18 is preferably set to a value within the range of 0.01 to 10  Ω/, The reason for this is as follows. If the sheet resistivity is below 0 .01 Ω/ , it may be necessary to make the upper electrode thick or the material for use may be excessively restricted. On the other hand, the sheet resistivity is over 10 Ω/, the resistance of the upper electrode may not be easily made low or the upper electrode becomes too thin to be formed.<br><br>
Therefore, the sheet resistivity of the auxiliary electrode is more preferably set to a value within the range of 0.01 to 10 Ω/ and still more preferably set to a value within the range of 0.01 to 5 Ω/.<br>
As a preferred low-resistance material constituting the auxiliary electrode 18, various metals used in wiring electrodes are preferably used. Specifically, it is preferred to contain one or a combination of two or more selected from Al, alloys of Al and a transition metal (Sc, Nb, Zr, Hf, Nd, Ta, Cu, Si, Cr, Mo, Mn, Ni, Pd, Pt and W and the like) , Ti, titanium nitride (TIN), and the like.<br>
Such low-resistance material is more preferably Al or an alloy of Al and a transition metal. In the case that an alloy of Al and a transition metal is used, the content by percentage of the transition metal is preferably 10% or less by atom (referred to as at, % or atm%) , more preferably 5% or less by atom, and still more preferably 2% or less by atom. This is because as the transition metal content is smaller, the sheet resistivity of the auxiliary electrode can be made lower.<br>
In the case that the above-mentioned metal is used as the main component, the amounts of used Al, Ti and TIN are preferably 90-100% by atom, 90-100% by atom, and 90-100% by atom, respectively.<br>
When two or more of these metals are used, the blend ratio thereof is arbitrary.  The Ti content is 10% or<br><br>
less by atom is preferred, for example, when a mixture of Al and Ti is used.<br>
Furthermore, plural layers comprising these metals may be laminated to make the auxiliary electrode 18. (9 Thickness<br>
The thickness of the main electrode 16 and the auxiliary electrode 18 shown in FIG. 1 and the like is preferably decided under consideration of the sheet resistivity and the like.  Specifically, the thickness of each of the main electrode 16 and the auxiliary electrode 18 is preferably a value of 50 nm or more, more preferably a value of 100 nm or more, and still more preferably a value within the range of 100 to 5,000 nm.<br>
The reason for this is as follows.  Setting the thickness of the main electrode 16 and the auxiliary electrode 18 to a value within such a range makes it possible to obtain a uniform thickness distribution and a transmissivity of 60% or more about light emission (EL light).  Moreover, the sheet resistivity of the upper electrode 20 comprising the main electrode 16 and the auxiliary electrode 18 can be made to 15 Ω/ or less, and more preferably 10 Ω/  or less. (3) Lower electrode ® Constituent material<br>
The lower electrode 22 shown in FIG- 1 and the like also corresponds to an anode layer or a cathode layer dependently on the structure of the organic EL display<br><br>
device. When the lower electrode 22 corresponds to, for example, a cathode, it is preferred to use a metal, alloy or electrically conductive compound which has a small work function (for example, less than 4.0 eV) , a mixture thereof, or a substance containing it.<br>
Specifically, a single or a combination of two or more selected from the following electrode materials is preferably used: sodium, sodium-potasslum alloys, cesium, magnesium, lithium, magnesium-silver alloys, aluminum, aluminum oxides, aluminum-lithium alloys, indium, rare earth metals, mixture of any one of these metals and an organic luminous medium material, mixtures of any one of these metals and an electron injection layer material, and the like.<br>
Moreover, since luminescence is taken out from the side of the upper electrodes 20 in the present invention, the constituent material of the lower electrodes 22 does not necessarily need to have transparency.  In a preferred embodiment, the lower electrode is made of a light-absorbing conductive material.  Such a structure makes it possible to improve contrast of the organic EL display device still more.  Preferred examples of the light-absorbing conductive material in this case include semiconductive carbon materials, organic compounds having a color, combinations of the above-mentioned reducing agent and oxidizing agent, and conductive oxides having a color (transition metal<br><br>
oxides such as VOx,, MoOx, and WO,,). Thickness<br>
In the same way as for the upper electrode 20, the thickness of the lower electrode 22 is not particularly limited, either. Specifically, the thickness is preferably a value within the range of 10 to 1,000 nm, and more preferably a value within the range of 10 to 200 nm. (4) Interlayer insulating film<br>
The interlayer insulating film (electrically insulating film) 13 in the organic EL display device 61 shown in FIG. 1 is present near or around the organic EL element 26 , and is used to make the whole of the organic EL display device 61 minute and prevent a short circuit between the lower electrode 22 and the upper electrode 2 0 in the organic EL element 26.  When the organic EL element 26 is driven by the TFT 14, the interlayer insulating film 13 is also used as an undercoat for protecting the TFT 14 and for depositing the lower electrode 22 of the organic EL element 26 flatly.<br>
For this reason, the interlayer insulating film 13 may be referred to as a different name such as a barrier, a spacer, or a flattening film, if necessary.  In the present invention, the interlayer insulating film embraces them. (D Constituent material<br>
Examples of the constituent material used in the<br><br>
interlayer insulating film 13 shown in FIG. 1 usually include acrylic resin, polycarbonate resin, polyimide resin, fluorinated polyimide resin, benzoguanamine resin, melamine resin , cyclic polyolef in, Novolak resin, polyvinyl cinnamate, cyclic rubber, polyvinyl chloride resin, polystyrene, phenol resin, alkyd resin, epoxy resin, polyurethane resin, polyester resin, maleic acid resin, and polyamide resin and the like.<br>
In the case that the interlayer insulating film is made of an inorganic oxide, preferred examples of the inorganic oxide include silicon oxide (SiOj or SiOx , aluminum oxide (AI2O3 or AlOx), titanium oxide (TiO or TiO2) , yttrium oxide (Y2O3 or YO,,) , germanium oxide (GeO2 or GeOx, zinc oxide (ZnO), magnesium oxide (MgO), calcium oxide (CaO), boric acid (B2O3), strontium oxide (SrO), barium oxide (BaO), lead oxide (PbO), zirconia (ZrO2, sodium oxide (NazO) , lithium oxide (LiaO), and potassium oxide (K2).  The value x in the inorganic compound is a value within the range of 1 £ x s 3.<br>
In the case that heat-resistance is particularly required, it is preferred to use acrylic resin, polyimide resin, fluorinated polyimide, cyclic polyolefin, epoxy resin, or inorganic oxide.<br>
These interlayer insulating films, when being organic, can be worked into a desired pattern by introducing a photosensitive group thereto and using photolithography method, or can be formed into a desired<br><br>
pattern by printing.<br>
(2)	Thickness of the interlayer insulating film, and the<br>
like<br>
The thickness of the interlayer insulating film depends on the minuteness of display, a fluorescent medium combined with the organic EL element, or unevenness of a color filter, and is preferably a value within the range of 10 nm to 1 mm.<br>
This is because such a structure makes it possible to make the unevenness of the TFT and the like sufficiently flat•<br>
Accordingly, the thickness of the interlayer insulating film is more preferably a value within the range of 100 nm to 100 µm   and still more preferably a value within the range of 100 nm to 10 µm<br>
(3)	Forming method<br>
The method for forming the interlayer insulating film is not particularly limited.  The layer is preferably deposited by, for example, spin coating method, casting method, screen-printing method and the like, or is preferably deposited by sputtering method, vapor-deposition method, chemical vapor deposition method (CVD method), ion plating method, and the like.<br>
3, Thin film transistor (TFT) (1) Structure<br>
As shown in FIG. 9, one example of the organic<br><br>
active EL light emission device 68 has, on a substrate 10, a TFT 14 and an organic EL element 26 driven by this TFT 14.<br>
An interlayer insulating film 13 whose surface (upper surface) is made flat is arranged between the TFT 14 and a lower electrode 2 2 of the organic EL element 26. A drain 47 of the TFT 14 and the lower electrode 22 of the organic EL element 26 are electrically connected to each other through a contact hole 54 made in this interlayer insulating film 13.<br>
As shown in FIG- 10, scanning electrode lines (Yj-Yj+n) 50 and signal electrode lines (Xi-Xi+n) 51 arranged in an XY matrix are electrically connected to the TFT 14.  Furthermore, common electrode lines (Ci-Ci+n) 52 are electrically connected in parallel to the TFTs 14.<br>
It is preferred that these electrode lines 50, 51 and 52 are electrically connected to the TFT 14 and they, together with a capacitance 57, constitute an electric switch for driving the organic EL element 26. Specifically, it is preferred that this electric switch is electrically connected to the scanning electrode line, the signal electrode line and the like, and comprises, for example, at least one first transistor (which may be referred to as Trl hereinafter) 55, a second transistor (which may be referred to as Tr2 hereinafter) , and the capacitance 57.<br><br>
It is preferred that the first transistor 55 has a function for selecting a luminous pixel and the second transistor 56 has a function for driving the organic EL element.<br>
As shown in FIG. 9, an active layer 44 in the first transistor (Trl) 55 and the second transistor (Tr2) 56 is a portion shown as n+/i/n+. It is preferred that the two sides n+ are composed of semiconductor regions 45 and 4 7 doped into the n type and i therebetween is composed of a non-doped semiconductor region 46,<br>
The semiconductor regions doped with the n type are a source 45 and the drain 47, respectively.  They, together with a gate 46 deposited through a gate oxide film on the non-doped semiconductor region, constitute the first and second transistors 55 and 56 -<br>
In the active layer 44, the semiconductor regions 45 and 47 doped into the n type may be doped into the p type, instead of the n type, so as to make a structure of p-f/i/p+.<br>
The active layer 44 in the first transistor (Trl) 55 and the second transistor (Tr2) 56 is preferably made of an inorganic semiconductor such as polysilicon or an organic semiconductor such as thiophene oligomer or poly(P-phenylenevinylene)• Polysilicon is a particularly preferred material since it is far more stable against electricity than amorphous Si (α-Si).<br>
Besides, the organic EL element 2 6 is deposited<br><br>
through the interlayer insulating film (flattening film) 13 on the TFT 14 formed on the surface of the substrate 10 in the examples shown in FIGs - 1 and 9,  As shown in FIG. 17, it is also preferred to form the TFT on the back surface of the substrate, form the organic EL element on the surface of the substrate and connect the TFT 14 and the lower electrode of the organic EL element 26 electrically to each other through a via hole 28 made in the substrate 10 and the interlayer insulating film (flattening film) 13.<br>
Such a structure makes it possible to keep better electrical insulation between the TFT 14 and the organic EL element 26 • In this example, the interlayer Insulating film(flattening film) 13 is deposited on the substrate 10. However, the interlayer insulating film 13 may be omitted since both surfaces of the substrate 10 have superior flatness. (2) Driving method<br>
The following will describe the method for driving the organic EL element by the TFT 14. As shown in FIG. 10, the TFT 14 comprises the first transistor (Trl) 55 and the second transistor (Tr2) 56, and further the TFT combined with the capacitance 57 constitutes a part of the electric switch.<br>
Therefore, a scanning pulse and a signal pulse are inputted through the XY matrix to this electric switch to perform switch operation, so that the organic EL<br><br>
element 26 connected to this electric switch can be driven.  Thus, light emission from the organic EL element 26 is caused or stopped by the electric switch comprising the TFT 14 and the capacitance 57, so that an image can be displayed.<br>
Specifically, a desired first transistor 55 is selected by a scanning pulse transmitted through the scanning electrode line (which may be referred to as a gate line) (Yj-Yj+n) 50 and a signal pulse transmitted through the signal electrode line (Xi-Xi+n) 51, so as to supply given electrical charges to the capacitance 5 7 formed between the common electrode line (Ci-Ci+n) 52 and the source 45 of the first transistor (Trl) 55,<br>
In this way, the gate voltage of the second transistor (Tr2) 56 turns into a constant value and the second transistor (Tr2) 56 turns into an ON state. Since in this ON state the gate voltage is held at a given value until a next gate pulse is transmitted, electric current continues to be supplied to the lower electrode 22 connected to the drain 47 of the second transistor {Tr2) 56.<br>
The organic EL element 26 is effectively driven by direct-current supplied through the lower electrode 22. Thus, by the effect of the direct-current driving, the driving voltage for the organic EL element 2 6 can be highly reduced and the luminous efficiency thereof is improved.  Moreover, power consumption can be reduced.<br><br>
[Second embodiment]<br>
As shown in FIG, 5, the active-driving organic EL light emission device of the second embodiment is an active-driving organic EL light emission device 64 comprising, on the substrate 10, the TFT 14 embedded in the electrically insulating film 12, the organic EL element 26 comprising the organic luminous medium 24 between the upper electrode 20 and the lower electrode 22, and the electrically connecting portion (via hole) 28 for connecting the TFT 14 and the organic EL element 2 6 to each other.<br>
The second embodiment is characterized in that, the upper electrode 20 is composed of the main electrode 16 and the auxiliary electrode 18, and further above the upper electrode 20 is set up a color filter or fluorescent film 60 for color-converting EL light taken out from the side of the upper electrode 20. (An arrow in FIG, 5 represents a direction along which the light is taken out • )<br>
The following will describe the characteristic parts and the like of the second embodiment, referring appropriately to FIG. 5. (1) Color filter (D Structure<br>
The color filter is set up to decompose or cut light to improve color adjustment or contrast, and comprises<br><br>
a colorant layer consisting only of a colorant, or a lamination wherein a colorant is dissolved or dispersed in a binder resin-  The colorant referred to herein embraces a pigment•<br>
The structure of the color filter preferably comprises a blue, green or red colorant.  Combination of such a color filter with the organic EL element emitting white light makes it possible to obtain three primary colors of light, that is, blue, green and red, and to attain full-color display.<br>
The color filter is preferably patterned by printing method or photolithography method in the same manner as for the fluorescence medium. Thickness<br>
The thickness of the color filter is not particularly limited so far as the thickness causes sufficient receipt (absorption) of luminescence from the organic EL element and does not damage color-converting function.  The thickness is preferably, for example, a value within the range of 10 nm to 1 mm, more preferably a value within the range of 0.5 ^im to 1 mm, and still more preferably a range within the range of 1 ^im to 100 ^im. ( 2) Fluorescent medium ® Structure<br>

the organic EL element and emitting fluorescence having a longer wavelength, and comprises layer-form matters separated and arranged in a plane,  The respective fluorescent medium are preferably arranged correspondingly to luminescence areas of the organic EL elements, for example, positions where the lower electrode and the upper electrode cross each other. When the organic luminous layer at the portion where the lower electrode and the upper electrode cross each other emits light, such a structure makes it possible that the respective fluorescent media receive the light to take out light rays having different colors (wavelengths) to the outside.  Particularly when the organic EL element emits blue light and the light can be converted to green or red luminescence by the fluorescent medium, the three primary colors of light, that is, blue, green and red can be obtained even from the single organic EL element. Thus, full-color display can be attained, and is preferable.<br>
In order to shut off luminescence from the organic EL element and light from the respective fluorescent medium to improve contrast or reduce dependency on the angle of field, it is also preferred to arrange a light shading layer (black matrix).<br>
The fluorescent medium may be combined with the above-mentioned color filter to prevent a drop in contrast based on outdoor daylight.<br><br>
Forming method<br>
In the case that the fluorescent medium comprises mainly a fluorescent colorant, the medium is preferably made to a film by vacuum deposition or sputtering through a mask for obtaining a desired fluorescent medium pattern.<br>
On the other hand, in the case that the fluorescent medium comprises a fluorescent colorant and a resin, the fluorescent colorant, the resin and an appropriate solvent are mixed, dispersed or solubilized into a liquid and then the liquid is made to a film by spin coating, roll coating, casting and the like method.  Thereafter, the fluorescent medium is preferably formed by forming a desired fluorescent medium pattern using photolithography method, or by forming a desired pattern by screen printing and the like method. (D Thickness<br>
The thickness of the fluorescent medium is not particularly limited if the thickness causes sufficient receipt (absorbance) of luminescence from the organic EL element and does not damage the function for generating fluorescence. The thickness is preferably a value within the range of 10 nm to 1 mm, more preferably a value within the range of 0.5 µmto 1 mm, and still more preferably a value within the range of 1 µm to 100 µm.<br><br>
