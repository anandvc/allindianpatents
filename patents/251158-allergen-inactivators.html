				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
ALLERGEN INACTIVATOR<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to an allergen inactivating agent which<br>
acts on an allergen in house dust, and further to a house dust treatment agent which facilitates aggregation and removal of the house dust in which the allergen is inactivated.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]	In a room, there are various kinds of house dust such as dead mites,<br>
feces, pollens, dust, and flocks. In general, the room is cleaned with a vacuum cleaner or the like. However, fine house dust such as those entwined to carpets, sofas, or beddings cannot be sufficiently removed by simply vacuuming with the vacuum cleaner or the like. The onset of various allergic diseases such as asthma, dermatitis, and poUinosis have been known to be caused by an allergen contained in house dust, mainly a mite allergen or a pollen. Therefore, it is important to inactivate the allergen and to remove house dust.<br>
[0003]	As techniques for effectively removing an allergen, there have been<br>
known, for example, a technique of treatment with a water-swellable clay, polyvinyl alcohol, or the like (see, for example. Patent Publications 1 and 2); a technique of treatment with an inorganic powder such as kaolin or talc (see Patent Publication 3); and the like. Any of these techniques<br><br>
comprises removing an allergen by adsorption with each of the components used. In addition, a technique of treatment with tannic acid, an alcohol, or a benzalkonium chloride, and other techniques (see Patent Publications 4 to 7) have been known. These techniques comprise removing an allergen by denaturation and inactivation. Patent Publication 1:   Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2000-16941 Patent Publication 2:   Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2002-128680 Patent Publication 3:   Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2002-167332 Patent Publication 4:   Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. Hei 2-16731<br>
Patent Publication 5:   Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2000-63207 Patent Publication 6:   Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2000-264837 Patent Publication 7:   Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2001-335474<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0004]	However, some of the techniques for removing an allergen by<br>
adsorption as mentioned above have the tendency of lowering the adsorbability at high pHs. In addition, some components used in the technique for removing an allergen by denaturation and inactivation as mentioned above have a disadvantage in usability such as generation of stains on an object to be treated. Furthermore, none of the techniques described above do not yet have a satisfactory effect of removing house dust.<br>
[0005]	Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide an<br><br>
allergen inactivating agent having less lowering in performance due to fluctuation in pH, and being capable of not only adsorbing and removing an allergen, but also inactivating and removing the allergen itself. Another object of the present invention is to provide a house dust treatment agent, spray, and sheet, capable of effectively removing house dust, without any disadvantages in use such as generation of stains.<br>
MEANS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS<br>
I]	Specifically, the present invention relates to:<br>
[1]     an allergen inactivating agent containing a titanium oxide having a photocatalytic activity;<br>
[2]     a house dust treatment agent containing the allergen inactivating agent of the above [1] and sodium polyacrylate;<br>
[3]     a spray for treating house dust comprising a spray container filled with the house dust treatment agent of the above [2]; [4]     a sheet for treating house dust comprising a sheet material impregnated with the house dust treatment agent of the above [2]; [5]     use of a titanium oxide having a photocatalytic activity, for inactivating an allergen; and<br>
[6]     a method for producing a house dust treatment agent, including the step of dispersing a titanium oxide having a photocatalytic activity and sodium polyacrylate in water, a lower alcohol or a mixture thereof.<br>
EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
J]	According to the present invention, there can be provided an<br><br>
allergen inactivating agent having less lowering in performance due to fluctuation in pH, and being capable of not only adsorbing and removing an allergen, but also inactivating and removing the allergen itself In addition, according to the present invention, there can be provided a house dust treatment agent, spray, and sheet, capable of effectively removing house dust, without any disadvantages in use such as generation of stains.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
!]	[Figure 1] A stereo micrograph (magnification: 50 folds) of<br>
standard dust.<br>
[Figure 2] A stereo micrograph (magnification: 50 folds) showing the state in which there is no adsorption or aggregation.<br>
[Figure 3] A stereo micrograph (magnification: 50 folds) showing the state in which there are adsorption and aggregation.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
â–º]	One feature of the allergen inactivating agent of the present<br>
invention resides in that the allergen activating agent contains a titanium oxide having a photocatalytic activity. Since the allergen inactivating agent has the feature, there are exhibited some effects that not only the allergen can be adsorbed and removed by utilization of the allergen adsorbability of the titanium oxide, but also the allergen can be inactivated and removed by the photocatalytic activity of the titanium oxide. In addition, since the titanium oxide contained in the allergen inactivating agent of the present invention is a metallic oxide, the titanium oxide does<br><br>
not discolor with the passage of time, so that the stain or the like which has conventionally been a disadvantage is less likely to be generated.<br>
LO]	The allergen to be inactivated by the allergen inactivating agent of<br>
the present invention includes dead mites, feces, pollens, and the like.<br>
LI]	The term "photocatalytic activity" used herein refers to an ability of<br>
degrading an organic substance or the like by utilizing oxidation power exhibited by light energy. Whether or not a titanium oxide has the photocatalytic activity can be confirmed by, for example, whether or not fading of methylene blue is caused by the titanium oxide. Specifically, the photocatalytic activity can be confirmed by adding a titanium oxide to an aqueous solution of methylene blue, and visually observing the extent of fading of the methylene blue while subjecting to photoirradiation.<br>
L2]	The crystal form of the titanium oxide used in the present invention<br>
includes an anatase type and a rutile type, and the anatase type is preferable, from the viewpoint of the allergen inactivating property.<br>
13]	The average particle size of the primary particle of the titanium<br>
oxide used in the present invention is not particularly limited. The average particle size is preferably from 1 to 200 nm, more preferably from 1 to 30 nm, and even more preferably from 5 to 20 nm, from the viewpoint of the allergen inactivating property. When the average particle size of the titanium oxide is within this range, the allergen inactivating agent is desirably likely to have enhanced effects of inactivating and removing an allergen, and also to have enhanced dispersion stability of the titanium oxide. When the primary particle of the titanium oxide has an average particle size of, for example, about several hundred nanometers, the<br><br>
average particle size can be determined with an electron microscope. When the primary particle of the titanium oxide has the above average particle size or less, the average particle size can be determined as a crystallite size by using the Scherrer's formula known in the art from the determination results of the X-ray analysis. The average particle size of the primary particle of the titanium oxide can be easily adjusted, for example, by calcinating the titanium oxide. The titanium oxide can also be used by mixing one or more kinds having different average particle sizes.<br>

solvent, the weight ratio of the water to the lower alcohol is preferably from 50:50 to 80:20, and more preferably from 60:40 to 70:30, from the viewpoint of enhancing dryness and usability of the house dust treatment agent, and from the viewpoint of reducing flammability and of alleviating irritability.<br><br>
7]	The allergen inactivating agent of the present invention may contain<br>
a proper amount of a dispersant, from the viewpoint of enhancing dispersibility of the titanium oxide. The amount of the dispersant cannot be unconditionally determined because the amount differs depending upon its kinds or the like. Therefore, it is preferable that the amount of the dispersant is adjusted according to its kinds or the like within the range<br>
. that would not hinder the object of the present invention.<br>
8]	The allergen inactivating agent of the present invention may further<br>
contain a proper amount of an additive such as a deodorant, an insecticide, a miticide, a repellent, a bactericide, a mildewproof preservative, an antistatic agent, a brightener, a stabilizer, a perfume, a pH adjusting agent, or a texture improver. The amount of the additive cannot be unconditionally determined because the amount differs depending upon its kinds or the like. Therefore, it is preferable that the amount of the additive is adjusted according to the kind or the like within the range that would not hinder the object of the present invention.<br>
9]	The allergen inactivating agent of the present invention can be used<br>
in the form of a dispersion prepared, for example, by dispersing a titanium oxide in the above-mentioned solvent, or the titanium oxide per se can be used as an allergen inactivating agent.<br>

dust treatment agent according to a known method.<br>
1]	(3)        Sheet<br>
The sheet of the present invention comprises a known sheet material impregnated with the above-mentioned house dust treatment agent, and a sheet material impregnated with a house dust treatment agent of a preferred embodiment is more preferable.<br>
2]	The content of ethanol in an especially preferred embodiment of the<br>
above-mentioned house dust treatment agent is from 20 to 50% by weight. However, when the above-mentioned house dust treatment agent is used for the preparation of a sheet, the content of ethanol in the especially preferred embodiment is from 1 to 50% by weight in consideration of an<br><br>
nfluence on a flooring wax, or the like.<br>
The shape of the sheet is not particularly limited. Usually, the sheet laving a length of about 150 to about 200 mm, a width of about 200 to ibout 300 mm, and a thickness of about 0.05 to about 1 mm is preferable. The sheet may be made of a single layer or laminated with layers formed 3f the same material or different materials.<br>
The above-mentioned sheet material is not particularly limited, and includes, for example, nonwoven fabric, woven fabric, paper and the like. The nonwoven fabric is preferable from the viewpoint of its high strength, [ow cost and easy adjustment of the basis weight. These sheet materials :an be produced in accordance with known methods. In addition, :ommercially available products may be used if available.<br>
For example, the above-mentioned nonwoven fabric suitably used as<br>
I sheet material can be produced by a known method such as chemical<br>
bond method, thermal bond method, span lace method, span bond method,<br>
or needle punch method. In addition, the material therefor is not<br>
particularly limited, and includes, for example, polypropylene,<br>
polyethylene, polyester, acrylic, rayon, cotton, pulp, and the like. As the<br>
material for the nonwoven fabric, the rayon or pulp is preferable from the<br>
WcAvpoint of facilitation of impregnation of the house dust treatment agent,<br>
and the polyethylene or polyester is preferable from the viewpoint of<br>
keeping the strength. Further, from the both viewpoints, a blended fabric<br>
in which ones exemplified as the preferred materials are blended in a<br>
proper ratio is more preferable,<br>
I	The nonwoven fabric having a basis weight, i.e., a fabric weight per<br><br>
unit area, of usually from about 30 to about 80 g/m is preferable.<br>
7]	The sheet material can be impregnated with the above-mentioned<br>
house dust treatment agent in accordance with a known method. For example, in a case where a sheet material comprising a nonwoven fabric having a basis weight within the above-mentioned preferred range is impregnated with the above-mentioned house dust treatment agent, it is preferable that the sheet material is immersed in the above-mentioned house dust treatment agent having a volume two or three times or so larger than the basis weight of the sheet material to impregnate the sheet material with the above-mentioned house dust treatment agent. Specifically, when the basis weight is 50 g/m , it is preferable the sheet material comprising a nonwoven fabric is impregnated with 100 to 150 g of the above-mentioned house dust treatment agent, per 1 m of the sheet material.<br>
8]	The house dust treatment agent and spray of the present invention<br>
may be used by applying the agent by means of, for example, sprinkling or the like to interior carpet, sofa, bedding or the like which is an object to be cleaned with a vacuum cleaner. In this case, immediately after the application, or preferably after allowing the object to stand for a period of from several minutes to several hours, the above-mentioned object is cleaned in a usual manner with a vacuum cleaner, so that an allergen can be effectively inactivated, and that house dust can be effectively removed. In addition, for example, the house dust treatment agent and spray can be applied on bedding or the like before airing out the bedding or the like. In that case, after a given period of airing, house dust can be effectively removed by beating the bedding or the like with a duster or hand before<br><br>
taking in the bedding or the like indoors. Usually, adhered house dust is finely pulverized upon beating of aired bedding or the like, whereby the dust may become even more difficult to be removed in some cases. However, if the house dust treatment agent or the like of the present invention is applied in advance, the house dust is aggregated, so that the house dust can be effectively removed.<br>
9]	Since the house dust treatment agent is not easily sprinkled or the<br>
like, it is preferable that the house dust treatment agent is used in the form of a spray. In addition, the spray is preferably used in a state that titanium oxide is homogeneously dispersed, from the viewpoint of sufficiently exhibiting the action of inactivating an allergen and the effects of removing house dust. Therefore, it is preferable that the spray usually is well shaken before application to the object. Further, upon the application, since the object is wet in a part where the spray is applied, it is preferable that the object is allowed to stand for a given period of time after the application to adequately dry the object, and the dried object is then cleaned. When the house dust treatment agent or the like of the present invention contains a deodorant component containing an extract from plants such as green tea, persimmon or bamboo, the allergen can be effectively inactivated, so that the house dust can be effectively removed, and at the same time the odors as mentioned above can be effectively removed.<br>
iO]	On the other hand, the sheet of the present invention is preferably<br>
used for wiping a part on which house dust is accumulated, for example, surface of bedding, a shade of an interior lamp, a window frame, floor or<br><br>
the like. Usually, when the part is cleaned with a damp cloth, the house dust merely gets wet, but it is still difficult to wipe off the house dust. According to the sheet of the present invention, not only the allergen can be effectively inactivated but also house dust can be aggregated and effectively removed. In addition, if the deodorant component as mentioned above is contained, the odor as mentioned above can also be removed effectively.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
I]	Examples 1 to 5 and Comparative Examples 1 to 3   Preparation of<br>
Allergen Inactivating Agent<br>
Each component of titanium oxides A to F listed in Table 1, silica or talc were mixed in accordance with the amount listed in Table 2, to give test solutions 1 to 5 (Examples 1 to 5) and comparative test solutions 1 to 3 (Comparative Examples 1 to 3).<br>
I]	Titanium oxide and optionally silica or talc were dispersed in water<br>
by adding each of the components in a small amount at a time to water having a normal temperature under stirring. In order to confirm the photocatalytic activity of titanium oxide used, 0.1 g of a titanium oxide was added to 100 mL of an aqueous methylene blue solution (0.1% by weight) while stirring, and the resulting dispersion was taken with a medicine dropper. One drop of the dispersion was put on a slide glass, and the extent of fading of the methylene blue was observed with naked eyes while subjecting to photoirradiation (black light, ultraviolet ray intensity: 1000 |iW/cm^). After one hour from the beginning of the photoirradiation.<br><br>
the color of the dispersion in which each of the titanium oxides A to E was dispersed was changed from blue to colorless transparent, while the color of the dispersion in which the titanium oxide F was dispersed showed no change in color from blue. Therefore, the titanium oxides A to E had a photocatalytic activity, while the titanium oxide F did not have a photocatalytic activity.<br><br><br><br>
[0055]	Test Example 1 Evaluation of Allergen Inactivating Action<br>
The allergen inactivating action of each of the test solutions 1 to 5 and the comparative test solutions 1 to 3 mentioned above was evaluated using a mite allergen as an allergen in accordance with the following method.<br>
[0056]	The amount 0.15 mL each of the test solutions 1 to 5 and the<br>
comparative test solutions 1 to 3 was added to 1 mL of an antigen solution prepared by dissolving a Dfb antigen [crude antigen of mite body; obtained by the method proposed by Sasa, M. et al. {Jpn, J. Exp, Med, 40: 367-382,1970)] in PBS so as to have a concentration of 20 iig/mL. As a negative control, the same volume of water was added in place of the test solution. The mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for<br><br>
LOurs under a fluorescent lamp (36 W X 8), and thereafter the extent of 5rgen inactivating action by each test solution was determined with a TEY CHECKER (mite allergen detection kit: manufactured by Shinto le Co., Ltd.).<br>
According to the MITEY CHECKER, the amount of a mite allergen r2 (one of the major allergens), capable of acting as an allergen, in the ution to be tested, can be determined by a horizontal development )cess using a monoclonal antibody. Therefore, it is thought that the :ent of allergen inactivating action by each test solution means an action inactivating allergens in each test solution.<br>
Table 3 below shows the criteria of judgment on the amount of mite srgen by the MITEY CHECKER, and Table 4 shows the judgment ults of the extent of allergen inactivating action by each test solution sed on the criteria of judgment.<br><br><br><br>
[0061]	It can be seen from Table 4 that the extent of allergen inactivating<br>
action by each of the test solutions 1 to 5 is higher than that by each of the comparative test solutions 1 to 3 and the negative control. The components used in the comparative test solutions are those used in the conventional technique for removing allergens. The results of Table 4 show that the extent of mite allergen inactivating action by the titanium oxide used in the present invention is especially excellent, as compared to these components.<br>
[0062]	Test Example 2  Influence of Light on Allergen Inactivating Action<br>
The extent of allergen inactivating action was evaluated in the same manner as in Test Example 1, except that the light conditions were changed, in order to confirm how the allergen inactivating action of the test solution 1 mentioned above was influenced by light. As a control, the comparative test solution 1 was used. The results are shown in Table 5.<br>
[0063]<br><br><br>
[0064]	According to Table 5, the extent of allergen inactivating action by<br>
the test solution 1 was further improved by exposing the test solution I to more intensive light, while, by contrast, the extent of allergen inactivating action by the comparative test solution 1 remained low regardless of the light conditions.<br>
[0065]	Test Example 3   Influence of pH on Allergen Inactivating Action<br>
The extent of allergen inactivating action was evaluated in the same manner as in Test Example 1, except that the pH of the test solution was adjusted with lactic acid or sodium carbonate before the test, in order to confirm how the allergen inactivating action of the test solution 1 mentioned above was influenced by pH. The results are shown in Table 6. Here, the test solution 1 before the test had a pH of 6.<br><br><br>
[0067]	It can be seen from Table 6 that the extent of allergen inactivating<br>
action by the test solution 1 is maintained regardless of the pH.<br>
[0068]	Example 6 and Comparative Examples 4 to 11   Preparation of<br>
House Dust Treatment Agent<br>
Each component was mixed in accordance with the amount listed in Table 7, to give a test solution 6 (Example 6) and comparative test solutions 4 to 11 (Comparative Examples 4 to 11). Here, the unit used in Table 7 is gram.<br>
[0069]<br><br><br>
)]	Test Example 4  Evaluation of Allergen Inactivating Action<br>
The allergen inactivating action was evaluated for the test solution 6<br>
and the comparative test solutions 4 to 11 in the same manner as in Test<br>
Example 1. The results are shown in Table 8.<br>
[]	Test Example 5   Evaluation of Hose Dust Aggregating Effect<br>
As dust, 10 mg of standard dust [Cotton linter, manufactured by<br>
Japan Air Cleaning Association] was put into a plastic petri dish having a<br>
diameter of 9 cm, and 0.7 mL of each of the test solution 6 and the<br>
comparative test solutions 4 to 11 charged in a commercially available<br>
hand spray container was sprayed to the standard dust. After drying the<br>
sprayed mixture at room temperature, the respective sprayed dust was<br>
observed with a stereo microscope (manufactured by Nikon Corporation;<br>
magnification: 50 times) for the extents of adsorption and aggregation of<br>
the standard dust in accordance with the following evaluation criteria. As<br>
controls, one in which only the standard dust is placed m a plastic plate,<br>
and one in which water is sprayed in place of the test solution to the<br>
standard dust was placed in a plastic petri dish were prepared and observed<br>
in the same manner. The results are shown in Table 8.<br>
]	<adsorption and aggregation of standard dust><br>
O:     There are adsorption and aggregation, X:     There is no adsorption or aggregation.<br>
]	Here, the adsorption and aggregation of the standard dust were<br>
evaluated by observing the adsorbed and aggregated states of the respective standard dust while the controls were considered to have no adsorption or aggregation. Fig. 1 shows a stereo micrograph of the<br><br>
[0075]	According to the results of Table 8, in the comparative test solution<br>
using sodium alginate, potato starch, polyvinyl alcohol, or methylcellulose as an aggregating agent, when the mixing ratio of the component was about 0.001% by weight (Comparative Examples 4, 6, 8, and 10), the adsorption or aggregation to the standard dust was not found (Fig. 2), and when the mixing ratio was increased in order to exhibit adsorption and aggregation to the standard dust (Comparative Examples 5, 7, 9, and 11), the allergen inactivating action of the titanium oxide was inhibited. On the contrary, in the test solution using sodium polyacrylate (Example 6), even when the component had a low concentration of about 0.001% by weight, the adsorption or aggregation to the standard dust was found (Fig. 3), and<br><br>
the allergen inactivating action was not inhibited.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
