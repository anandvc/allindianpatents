				<td>SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR REGISTRATION AND PACKET DATA RECONNECT Field of the Application<br>
The application relates to registration and packet data connect in wireless systems.<br>
Background<br>
To comply with the 3GPP2 CDMA packet data services standard "3GPP2 C.S0017-012-A vl.O: Data Service Options for Spread Spectrum Systems: Service Options 33 and 66" (also known as TIA-707.12-B) , a mobile station with a dormant packet data session is required to "reconnect" its packet data service whenever it detects a change in System ID (SID) , Network ID (NID) or Packet Zone ID (PZID) parameter associated with the wireless network.  The reconnect process is required to maintain PPP (point-to-point protocol) connectivity in case the wireless network needs to move the so-called "R-P" interface (also known as A10 and All) between the Radio Access Network (RAN) and the Packet Data Servicing Node (PDSN) associated with the packet data service or in some cases needs to assign a new IP address to the mobile station.  The reconnect process requires the mobile station to send an Origination message with Packet Data Service option and Data Ready to Send (DRS) bit set to 0. The wireless network may assign a traffic channel to the mobile station when the reconnect process takes place. A feature called "packet zone hysteresis" is included in 3GPP2 C.S0017-012-A vl.O in order to minimize the number of reconnect attempts when the mobile station moves back and forth between two systems (such a SID/NID/PZID boundary).  To implement the hysteresis feature, a mobile station keeps track of visited systems in a list which is called "Packet Zone List" in 3GPP2 C.S0017-012-A - each entry except the most recently added entry has an expiry timer.  If a mobile station revisits a system whose timer has not expired yet and it does not have any data<br>
to send, then it refrains from reconnecting its data service until the hysteresis timer has expired.<br>
To comply with the CDMA air-interface standard "3GPP2 C.S0005-Upper Layer (Layer 3) Signaling Standard for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems" (also known as TIA2000.5) a mobile station may be required to perform different types of access network registration.  There are multiple revisions of 3GPP2 C.S0005 - the first one being 3GPP2 C.S0005-0 and the most recent one being 3GPP2 C.S0005-D. An example of a registration method which is common to all revisions of 3GPP2 C.S0005 is called "zone-based registration" in which the mobile station performs registration whenever it enters a zone that is not in the mobile station's zone list. Zones are uniquely identified by a zone number (REG_ZONE) in addition to the SID and NID of the zone.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
The CDMA, packet data service reconnect and the CDMA, air-interface standard registration are not implemented co-<br>
operatively to produce an increased likelihood that a mobile station will be reachable in a given instant.  For example, a CDMA air-interface standard registration zone boundary may also coincide with a SID/NID/PZID boundary.  In such a case, it is possible that the mobile station will perform a zone-based registration after moving from a first registration zone to a second registration zone, but that the mobile station will not initiate packet data reconnect due to the fact that the new SID/NID/PZID was visited earlier and the associated hysteresis timer has not yet expired.  Some networks may even terminate the existing R-P interface after the reception of the registration message in the new registration zone in order to handle potential dangling R-P resource issues.  The removal of the R-P interface prior to establishment of the new R-P interface due to the lack of co-ordination between the registration process and the packet data service reconnect process may result in making the mobile station unreachable from the packet data perspective until the mobile station reestablishes the packet data connectivity. However, the mobile station may not be aware of the fact that the network has torn down an existing R-P interface.  More particularly, if the mobile moves from the first zone to the second zone, a packet data reconnect will not occur until at least the hysteresis timer of the second zone expires.  If the mobile station returns to the first zone before expiry of the hysteresis timer of the second zone, and the hysteresis timer for the first zone has not expired, a new R-P interface will not be established until the first zone hysteresis timer is expired.  If there had not been a registration that resulted in the R-P interface in the first zone being torn down, the mobile station would have again been reachable after it returned to the first zone. Extended periods of time during which the mobile station is not reachable result in packet data for the mobile station being<br>
accumulated and then sent in a clumped manner to the always-on mobile station after it does become available.<br>
The network shows a first PDSN (packet data service node) connected to two BSCs (base station controllers) 10,12. For some embodiments, it is assumed that a Packet Control Function (PCF) is collocated with BSC or resident with BSC functionality. Each BSC supports a respective wireless network. The details of this are not shown with the exception of a single BTS (base station transceiver) 30 shown under the control of BSC 10.  The coverage area of BSC 10 has network identifier NID1; the coverage area served by BSC 12 has network identifier NID2.  In the illustrated example, the coverage area of BSC 10 also has registration zone ID REGZONE1 and the coverage area of BSC 12 has REGZONE2.  The overall area 29 through which packet service is provided by PDSN 14 has packet zone ID PZID1.  In the illustrated example, this area also has system ID SID1 26.<br>
In the illustrated example, the network ID happens to be mapped one-to-one to the BSCs, but this may not necessarily be the case.  There may be multiple BSCs having a single NID. Furthermore, in the illustrated example, the PZID1 is one-to-one with the SID1.  More generally, this is not necessarily the case.  A system ID will usually relate to multiple network IDs and the packet zone IDs will be independently mapped.<br>
Also shown is a second PDSN 20 connected to a BSC 18 that operates within coverage areas having network ID NID3, system ID SID2 and packet zone ID PZID2 27.<br>
A single mobile station MOBILE STATION 32 is shown within the coverage area of BTS 30.  This mobile station has mobility and can move within different coverage areas and zones.<br>
For mobile station 32, the relevant R-P interface is shown at 28 between PDSN 14 and BSC/PCP 10.  The R-P interface transports user packet data from/to the mobile station and carries signalling messages. For example, it enables the mobile station 32 to be paged while it has a dormant packet data service.<br>
To reiterate the problems with the behaviour<br>
resulting from the current standards, with C.S0005 zone-based registration, a mobile station will automatically register when it changes registration zones, for example when mobile station 32 moves from REGZONEj. to REGZONE2.  If the change in registration zone coincides with a change in a SID/NID/PZID, then the change in registration zone will trigger the access network registration (i.e. the mobile station sends the C.S0005 Registration Message) , and the change in the SID/NID/PZID will trigger a packet data service reconnect (i.e. the mobile station initiates the packet data reconnect by sending the C.S0005 Origination Message with the DRS field set to 'O')/ assuming that there is not an outstanding hysteresis timer for the new SID/NID/PZID.  With this sequence of events, the mobile station is always reachable.  This is the case for the movement of mobile station 32 from REGZONEi to REGZONE2 because the network identifier also changes from NIDi to NID2.<br>
If, on the other hand the mobile station moves to a second registration zone that is not on the registration zone list, but there is no change in the SID/NID/PZID, then an access network registration will occur which may tear down the existing R-P interface, but no reconnect process will occur because there has been no change in the SID/NID/PZID.  With such a scenario, the mobile station will not be reachable until it instigates a data transmission.  This would be the case in Figure 1 where the area defined by REGZONE2 to have the same network identifier as REGZONE1.<br>
A second problem is created due to the 3GPP2 C.S0017-012-A packet zone hysteresis.  When a mobile station moves from the first registration zone REGZONEj. to a second registration zone REGZONE2 that is not on the registration zone list and simultaneously from a first SID/NID/PZID to a second SID/NID/PZID, an access network registration may be triggered that will tear down the R-P interface 28 within the first SID/NID/PZID.  Assuming the mobile station has the new SID/NID/PZID in its packet zone list and it does not have any data to send, the mobile station will wait until the expiry of the hysteresis timer associated with the new- SID/NID/PZID before issuing a packet data service reconnect by sending the C.S0005 Origination Message with the DRS field set to '0'.  If, before the expiry of that hysteresis timer, the mobile station returns to the original SID/NID/PZID, then until the expiry of the hysteresis timer for that SID/NID/PZID, there will not be a packet data service reconnect. Note that in the absence of an access network registration when the mobile station moved from the first SID/NID/PZID to the second SID/NID/PZID, the R-P interface for the first SID/NID/PZID would not have been torn down, and when the mobile station returned to the first SID/NID/PZID it would have again immediately been reachable.<br>
An embodiment of the application will now be described with reference to an example network depicted in Figure 1.  With the embodiment of Figure 2, the network is the same as that shown in Figure 1.  However, shown is a mobile station 33 equipped with a co-ordinated registration and reconnect function 35.  The behaviour of the co-ordinated registration and reconnect function 35 will be described in detail below with various examples.  This function can be implemented as part of the software residing on the mobile station 33; it can be implemented in hardware or firmware; alternatively it can be implemented as an appropriate<br>
combination of software,hardware and firmware. Also, while shown is a discrete functional element 35, it is to be understood that it can also be implemented by making a series of modifications to software that is compliant with existing standards.  For example, existing mobile stations have the capability to comply with 3GPP2 C.S0005 for the air-interface and 3GPP2 C.S0017-012-A for packet data services.  The coordinated registration and reconnect function 35 can be embodied through of series of one or more changes to the otherwise standard compliant functionality.<br>
It is to be very clearly understood that the network depicted in Figure 2 is for the purpose of example and explanation only. An arbitrary arrangement of components is contemplated.  Furthermore, the BSC/PCF/ BTS hierarchy within a given network is but one example of a method of providing the air-interface through to a mobile station.  Other hierarchies may alternatively be implemented.  For different implementations, there still will be a registration interface, through the BTS and BSC in the illustrated example for the CDMA air-interface, and there is an R-P interface 28 for the CDMA packet data service or equivalent shown between the PDSN 14 and BSC/PCF 10 in the example.<br>
In a first embodiment, whenever any event triggers an access network registration (see for example 2.6.5.1 of 3GPP2 C.S0005-D) of the following types (timer-based, zone-based, parameter-change, distance-based, or user zone-based) the mobile station will check to see if there is a system entry in its packet zone list with an unexpired hysteresis timer that matches the SID/NID/PZID of the current zone.<br>
If there is one, the mobile station performs a reconnect procedure instead of registration and resets the associated hysteresis timer.  The reconnect process constitutes<br>
sending an Origination Message which is considered as an "implicit" registration as per the 3GPP2 C.S0005 standard.  In the event the mobile station is required to register and reconnect (e.g. entry to a new zone that is not on mobile station's zone list or packet zone list), the mobile station only performs the reconnect procedure.<br>
It is noted that it is preferred for the mobile station to perform the reconnect procedure instead of the registration.  However, in 3GPP2 C.S0005-D for two types of access network registrations using the Registration Message, the associated necessary fields are currently missing from the Origination Message, thus creating a problem for these two types of registrations.  For the encryption re-sync required Registration, there is a registration type (REG_TYPE) field in<br>
•<br>
the 3GPP2 C.S0005-D Registration Message which tells the base station that the mobile is registering due to encryption re-sync being required; no equivalent field exists in the Origination Message.  Similarly, for Broadcast Multicast (BCMC) Registration, when the mobile needs to change the BCMC frequency, it includes the following fields in. the Registration Message to indicate the new BCMC frequency: BCMC frequency information included indicator (BCMC_FREQ_INFO_INCL), BCMC Band Class (BCMC_BAND_CLASS), and BCMC Frequency  (BCMC_CDMA_FREQ); no equivalent fields exist in the Origination Message.  Since fields are missing from the Origination Message, for an encryption re-sync required Registration and for a BCMC Registration including a frequency change, it..will be necessary to send both the Registration message and the Origination Message used for packet data reconnect.  Alternatively, if the Origination Message were modified to include a field to indicate to the base station that the mobile station requires an encryption re-sync (this could be by adding the REG_TYPE field to the Origination Message or could be by adding another<br>
field such as a one-bit indicator field), the mobile could send only the Origination Message used for packet data reconnect when the registration is an encryption re-sync required registration.  Similarly, if the Origination Message were modified to include fields for the new BCMC frequency (BCMC frequency information included indicator, BCMC Band Class, and BCMC Frequency, or their equivalents) the mobile could send only the Origination Message used for packet data reconnect when the registration is a BCMC frequency change registration. It should also be noted that three types of registrations present special cases for which packet data reconnect is not required at all.  If the registration is either a power-up registration, power-down registration, or an ordered registration, packet data reconnect will not be needed and the mobile station can just send the Registration Message.<br>
There are many ways to achieve this result.  In a first example, shown in the flowchart of Figure 3, the new behaviour is shown from the perspective of registration with the assumption that a conventional packet zone hysteresis-based reconnect is running in the background.  At step 3-1, an event triggering registration occurs. At step 3-2,a check is made to see if the registration is a power-up registration, a power-down registration, or an ordered registration.  If the registration was any of these types, yes path step 3-2, then at step 3-5, an access network registration is performed by sending a Registration Message. Alternatively, if the registration is not one of these types, no path step 3-2, processing continues at step 3-4.  At step 3-4\ a check is made to see if there is an active hysteresis timer for the current SID/NID/PZID.  If there is not an active hysteresis timer for the current SID/NID/PZID, no path step 3-4, then at step 3-5 an access network registration is performed by sending a Registration Message.  Alternatively, if there is an active<br><br>
hysteresis timer for the current SID/NID/PZID, yes path step 3-4, then at step 3-3, the mobile station causes the equivalent of an access network registration and a packet data service registration to be performed.  This can take the form of an explicit registration (i.e. the mobile station sends a Registration Message) followed by a packet data reconnect; a packet data reconnect only with an implicit registration, or a registration modified to include an indication that a reconnect is also to be performed.  At step 3-3, the choice of whether to send only the Origination Message used for packet data reconnect or to send both the Registration Message and the Origination Message used for packet data reconnect can be based upon the Registration type.  For example if the registration type is either encryption re-sync registration or BCMC registration then both the Registration Message and the Origination Message used for packet data reconnect are sent; otherwise only the Origination Message used for packet data reconnect is sent. At step 3-3, packet zone list maintenance functions are also performed consisting of cancelling the hysteresis timer for the current SID/NID/PZID, removing the current SID/NID/PZID from the packet zone list, and adding the current SID/NID/PZID as the newest entry in the packet zone list without a timer.<br>
In another embodiment, the new behaviour can be shown from the perspective of the entries in the Packet Zone list when hysteresis is active.  This is shown in Figure 4.  At step 4-1, an event triggering registration occurs.  At step 4-2, a check is made to see if the registration is a power-up registration, a power-down registration, or an ordered registration.  If the registration was any of these types, yes path step 4-2, then at step 4-6, an access network registration is performed by sending a Registration Message.  Alternatively, if the registration is not one of these types, no path step 4-<br><br>
2, processing continues at step 4-3.  At step 4-3, a check is made to see if the current SID/NID/PZID corresponds to the most recent entry on the packet zone list.  If the current SID/NID/PZID corresponds to the most recent entry on the packet zone list, yes path step 4-3, this means that the mobile station already has a packet data connection for the current SID/NID/PZID and thus packet reconnect is not required, so processing continues at step 4-6 where an access network registration is performed by sending a Registration Message. If the current SID/NID/PZID does not correspond to the most recent entry on the packet zone list, no path step 4-3, processing continues at step 4-4.  At step 4-4, a check is made to see if the current SID/NID/PZID is on the packet zone list. If the current SID/NID/PZID is not on the packet zone list, no path step 4-4, then at step 4-6 an access network registration is performed by sending a Registration Message.  Alternatively, if the current SID/NID/PZID is on the packet zone list, yes path step 4-4, then at step 4-5, the mobile station causes the equivalent of an access network registration and a packet data service registration to be performed.  This can take the form of an explicit registration (i.e. the mobile station sends a Registration Message) followed by a packet data reconnect; a packet data reconnect only with an implicit registration, or a registration modified to include an indication that a reconnect is also to be performed.  At step 4-5, the choice of whether to send only the Origination Message used for packet data reconnect or to send both the Registration Message and the Origination Message used for packet data reconnect can be based upon the Registration type.  For example if the registration type is either encryption re-sync registration or BCMC registration then both the Registration Message and the Origination Message used for packet data reconnect are sent; otherwise only the Origination Message used for packet data reconnect is sent.  At step 4-5, packet zone list maintenance<br>
functions are also performed consisting of cancelling the hysteresis timer for the current SID/NID/PZID, removing the current SID/NID/PZID from the packet zone list, and adding the current SID/NID/PZID as the newest entry in the packet zone list without a timer.<br>
Figure 5 is a flowchart of a new integrated<br>
reconnect/registration method.  The method starts with one of three events, namely an event triggering one registration in step 5-2, a change in SID/NID/PZID not requiring registration in step 5-9, or the expiry of a hysteresis timer in step 5-13.<br>
If it is an event triggering registration step 5-2, processing continues at step 5-3 where a check is made to see if the registration is a power-up registration, a power-down registration, or an ordered registration.  If the registration was any of these types, yes path step 5-3, then at step 5-7, a registration is performed by sending a Registration Message. Alternatively, if the registration is not one of these types, no path step 5-3, processing continues at step 5-4. At step 5-4, a check is made to see if the current SID/NID/PZID corresponds to the most recent entry on the packet zone list. If the current SID/NID/PZID corresponds to the most recent entry on the packet zone list, yes path step 5-4, this means that the mobile station already has a packet data connection for the current SID/NID/PZID and thus packet reconnect is not required, so processing continues at step 5-7 where a registration is performed by sending a Registration Message. If the current SID/NID/PZID does not correspond to the most recent entry on the packet zone list, no path step 5-4, processing continues at step 5-5.  At step 5-5, a check is made to see if the current SID/NID/PZID is on the packet zone list. If the current SID/NID/PZID is not on the packet zone list, no path step 5-5, then at step 5-7 a reconnect is performed (consistent with normal packet zone reconnection behaviour<br>
since there has been a change in SID/NID/PZID)  and a registration is performed at step 5-8 by sending a Registration Message.  Alternatively, if the current SID/NID/PZID is on the packet zone list, yes path step 5-5, then processing continues at step 5-6.  At step 5-6 the hysteresis timer for the current SID/NID/PZID is cancelled, the current SID/NID/PZID is removed from the packet zone list, and the current SID/NID/PZID is added as a new entry to the packet zone list.  It should be noted that before adding a new entry to the packet zone list the mobile station sets the packet zone hysteresis timer for the most recently added entry in the list as described in C.S0017-012-A vl.O section 2.2.5.  Continuing, step 5-6, the mobile station causes the equivalent of an access network registration and a packet data service registration to be performed.   This can take the form of an explicit registration (i.e. the mobile station sends a Registration Message) followed by a packet data reconnect; a packet data reconnect only with an implicit registration, or a registration modified to include an indication that a reconnect is also to be performed. At step 5-6, the choice of whether to send only the Origination Message used for packet data reconnect or to send both the Registration Message and the Origination Message used for packet data reconnect can be based upon the Registration type. For example if the registration type is either encryption re-sync registration or BCMC registration then both the Registration Message and the Origination Message used for packet data reconnect are sent; otherwise only the Origination Message used for packet data reconnect is sent.<br>
In another embodiment, steps 5-7 and 5-8 can be<br>
combined in any manner that results in the equivalent of both a registration and a reconnect being performed.  As outlined previously, this might consist of a reconnect with implicit registration.<br>
On the other hand, if the initial event was a change in SID/NID/PZID not requiring registration, step 5-9, then packet zone list processing continues at step 5-11.  At step 5-11, if the new SID/NID/PZID is on the packet zone list, yes path step 5-11, then nothing is done as either the mobile station is already connected to the current SID/NID/PZID (i.e. the current SID/NID/PZID is the most recent entry on the list) or the hysteresis timer is being counted down for that SID/NID/PZID and a reconnect will not occur until that timer expires.  On the other hand, if the new SID/NID/PZID is not on the packet zone list, no path step 5-11, then at step 5-12, the packet zonelhysteresis timer for the most recently added entry in the packet zone list is activated as described in C.S0017-012-A vl.O section 2.2.5, the new SID/NID/PZID is added to the packet zone list, and reconnect is performed at step 5-12.<br>
Finally, if the initial event was the expiry of a hysteresis timer, then the SID/NID/PZID is removed from the packet zone list at step 5-13 . A reconnect is performed at step 5-14 if the timer of the current SID/NID/PZID expired. An example of a packet zone list used when hysteresis is active is shown in Figure 6 where various SID/NID/PZID entries are shown with respective hysteresis timers T1,... TN.  The entries in the list are ordered from the newest on the top to the oldest on the bottom.  The newest entry in the packet zone list (the topmost entry) does not have an active hysteresis timer. Before a new entry is added to the packet zone list, a hysteresis timer is activated for the newest entry currently in the list and then the new entry is added without an active hysteresis timer.  It is to be clearly understood that the list shown is a very specific example.  The point of hysteresis is to not immediately reconnect after changing packet zones to a zone that was previously visited within some time interval. There are many logically equivalent ways of achieving thisfunction without necessarily implementing a list, or implementing timers.<br>
For all of the above methods, as discussed<br>
previously, wherever the equivalent of both a registration and a reconnect are to be performed, any of the four previously introduced behaviours can be executed.  These include performing a registration and then a reconnect; performing a reconnect and also an implicit registration; performing a registration using a new version of the registration message that includes one or more parameters that indicate reconnect is to also be performed; performing a reconnect that includes one or more parameters for use in registration.  For some of these options, a change will also need to be implemented on the network side.  In particular, in the event a-new registration message is employed that indicates one or more parameters which indicates reconnect is also to be performed, the base station controller will need to be modified to understand this message and act accordingly.  Similarly, for an embodiment featuring the use of a reconnect message that includes one or more parameters for use in registration, the base station controller will also need to be modified to understand the new parameters and to act accordingly.<br>
Referring now to Figure 7, shown is another embodiment that achieves a similar effect, but does not necessarily require changes to be made to the mobile station. In this embodiment, a change is made in the behaviour of the network side in processing registration messages.  At step 7-1, the network (for example, a BSC or BTS) receives a registration message.  The network then checks to see if the message was received from an always-on mobile station at step 7-2.  For example, an attribute may be retrieved from the AAA and maintained in the radio access network, for example in the BSC/PCF, for each mobile station to indicate whether or not it<br>
is an always-on mobile station.  If it is not an always-on mobile station, no path step 7-2, then step 7-3 is performed which consists of performing a normal registration and this may involve tearing down the existing R-P interface.  On the other hand, if the mobile station is an always-on mobile station, yes path step 7-2, then step 7-4 is executed.  This consists of performing registration, but in so doing not tearing down the existing R-P interface.  In a variant of this, step 7-5 can be performed.  This consists of performing registration and moving the R-P interface to the new zone if the IP connectivity is the same.  The functionality of Figure 7 is preferably implemented in software in the base station controller. However, other implementations such as hardware, software, firmware are also contemplated. Also, this functionality could be implemented in a component other than a. base station controller.<br>
The detailed examples presented above assume that packet data service reconnect occurs across changes in SID/NID/PZID.  More generally, reconnect is considered to occur across changes in packet data service reconnect zone.  The reconnect zone does not have to be an actual parameter.  In the particular examples given, any time any one of SID/NID/PZID changes, the reconnect zone changes.  Other reconnect triggers are contemplated.<br>
Referring now to Figure 8, in another embodiment, a method implemented in the mobile station involves first the occurrence of an event triggering registration at step 8-1. The event is categorized at step 8-2.  Three different categorizations are shown, these including a first category for which only registration is performed at step 8-3; a second category for which registration and reconnect are performed at step 8-4, and a third category for which reconnect with implicit registration is performed.  For the third category, in<br>
some embodiments the reconnect is performed with additional parameters to support particular registration types.<br>
In a specific implementation, if the mobile station determines that a registration is required to a base station for which a packet zone hysteresis timer is active, the mobile station cancels the packet zone hysteresis timer, removes the entry from the packet zone list, adds the entry as a new entry in the packet zone list, and initiates a packet zone based reconnection by sending an Origination Message (preferably with DRS=0) if the required registration is of any of a set of defined types.  In one embodiment the types are: timer-based, zone-based, parameter-change, distance-based, or user zone-based.   Furthermore, in some embodiments, if the mobile station determines that a registration is required to a base station for which a packet zone hysteresis timer is active, the mobile station performs the registration, cancels the packet zone hysteresis timer, removes the entry from the packet zone list, adds the entry as a new entry in the packet zone list, and initiates a packet zone based reconnection by sending an Origination Message (preferably with DRS=0) if the required registration is of any of a set of defined types.  In one embodiment, the types are: encryption re-sync required, or BCMC Registration.<br>
In the above, it may not be necessary to explicitly cancel the hysteresis timer given that the entry has been removed from the packet zone list.  This is an implementation decision.<br>
Numerous modifications and variations of the present application are possible in light of the above teachings.  It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the application may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
