BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel heterocyclic compounds useful for<br>
normalizing elevated blood glucose levels in diabetics and in treating disorders related<br>
to glucose intolerance.<br>
These compounds inhibit the enzyme DPP-IV, that degrade the peptide GLP-1,<br>
providing for enhanced levels of active GLP-1, a peptide which normalizes elevated<br>
blood glucose levels.<br>
These compounds are useful to control blood glucose level in diabetic patients<br>
and thereby delay the onset of vascular complications in diabetic patients and also<br>
transition to type II diabetes in impaired glucose tolerant patients.<br>
These compounds are also useful in treating disorders related to glucose<br>
intolerance like Cushing"s syndrome, hyperthyroidism, obesity, hyperglucagonemia,<br>
diseases like ulcers, HIV infection, disorders related to increased gastric emptying,<br>
acid secretion and hunger, autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid<br>
arthritis and Grave"s disease (Sedo and Kraml, 1994).<br>
These compounds also exhibit free radical scavenging activity which is useful<br>
in treatment of various disease condition caused by accumulation of free radicals in<br>
the body cells.<br>
2. DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Diabetes mellitus is a clinically and genetically heterogenous group of<br>
disorders characterized by abnormally high levels of glucose in the blood. The<br>
hyperglycemia is due to deficiency of insulin secretion or to resistance of body cells<br>
to the action of insulin, or to a combination of these. Chronic hyperglycemia is a<br>
cause of heavy burden of morbidity and premature mortality from diabetic<br>
complications. These long-term complications can be delayed by improving glycemic<br>
control. None of the currently used medications is capable of reversing an ongoing<br>
failure of B-cell function and reduction in post prandial glucose peak represents an<br>
important target for therapeutic strategies.<br>
Although pancreatic insulin secretion is predominantly controlled by blood<br>
glucose levels, incretins like the peptide GLP-1 derived from enteroinsular axis have<br>
an effect on insulin secretion and therefore on the blood glucose level. It is released<br>
from the gut in response to ingested nutrients, which acts on the pancreas to potentiate<br>
glucose- induced insulin secretion. GLP-1 has beneficial effects in diabetic patients<br>
in normalizing elevated blood glucose levels (Hoist J and Deacon C, 1998). GLP-1<br>
has multifaceted actions, which include stimulation of insulin gene expression, trophic<br>
effects on 6-cells, inhibition of glucagon secretion, promotion of satiety, and slowing<br>
of gastric emptying. Because of glucose dependency of the peptide and<br>
glucagonostatic actions, the glucose lowering effect is self-limiting, and the hormone,<br>
therefore does not cause hypoglycemia regardless of the dose.<br>
The pathogenesis of type-2 diabetes ordinarily involves the development of<br>
insulin resistance associated with compensatory hyperinsulinaemia followed by<br>
progressive beta-cell impairment that results in decreasing insulin secretion and<br>
hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia itself causes additional inhibition of insulin secretion<br>
and more insulin resistance (glucose toxicity), which further accentuates_the<br>
hyperglycemia.(Augustyns K. et al. The unique properties of Dipeptidyl-peptidase IV<br>
(DPP-IV/ CD 26) and the therapeutic potential of DPP - IV inhibitors. Current<br>
Medical Chemistry 1999; 6:311-327)<br>
Most therapies used at present ultimately fail to control blood sugar level after<br>
3-5 years. This is due to the progressive ß-cell failure in the course of the disease<br>
and insulin is finally required in most type-2 diabetic patients.<br>
Impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glucose is present in a large<br>
population. These abnormalities progress to a large extent to overt diabetes. No<br>
therapy has been approved for the prevention or delay of type-2 diabetes in these<br>
patients.<br>
Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors addresses to a large extent the<br>
inadequacies of the presently available therapies. It targets not only the ß-cell<br>
dysfunction but also insulin resistance and increased hepatic glucose output by liver.<br>
Thus, it has a more holistic approach towards the treatment of type-2 diabetes.<br>
Furthermore, by stabilizing / reversing the progressive ß-cell dysfunction, it would<br>
prevent the progression of the disease and for the same reason, it has the potential to<br>
prevent or delay the occurrence of overt diabetes in subjects with impaired fasting<br>
glucose and impaired glucose tolerance. (Pathogenesis of type-2 Diabetes; Harold E<br>
Lebovitz, Drug Benefit Trends 12 (supp A):8-16, 2000).<br>
The presently used antihyperglycemic drugs target either insulin resistance or<br>
ß-cell dysfunction. Hence, there is a need to address both these pathologies together.<br>
The homeodomain transcription factor, PDX-1 is essential for the early<br>
development of the pancreas and the maintenance of the ß-cell phenotype. PDX-1 is<br>
known to regulate insulin, GLUT2 and islet amyloid precursor. Under conditions of<br>
sustained hyperglycemia, such as in the diabetic state, there is a downregulation of<br>
PDX-1 expression and a decrease in insulin secretion (Doyle and Egan, 2001). GLP-1<br>
induces the differentiation of PDX-1 positive pancreatic epithelial cells into insulin-<br>
secreting cells. GLP-1 stimulates the expression of transcription factor PDX-1 while<br>
stimulating B-cell neogenesis and may thereby be an effective treatment for diabetes.<br>
GLP-1 and a long acting GLP-1 analogue exendin-4, stimulates both B-cell replication<br>
and neogenesis, resulting in increased ß-cell mass and improved glucose tolerance in<br>
partial pancreatectomy rat model of type 2 diabetes (Gang et al, 1999).<br>
GLP-17.36 is one of the substrate for the circulating exopeptidase dipeptidyl<br>
peptidase IV (EC 3.4.14.5), a post proline cleaving enzyme with a specificity for<br>
removing Xaa-Pro or Xaa-Ala dipeptides from the N-terminus of polypeptides and<br>
proteins. DPP-IV is widely distributed in tissues like kidney, intestine and placenta,<br>
hepatocytes, epithelial cells of pancreatic duct, central nervous system, peripheral<br>
nervous system, endothelial cells of blood vessels (Rolf, 1999), and found as soluble<br>
enzyme in blood plasma. About 50% of the GLP-17.36 amide released from the L cells<br>
is inactivated in the capillary bed surrounding these cells by DPP-IV. Furthermore,<br>
single pass through the liver inactivates a large fraction of the remaining active GLP -<br>
1 (&gt;40%) (Bork and Xue, 2000). Thus these two processes together with inactivation<br>
in the circulatory system and in other organs can be expected to inactivate or remove<br>
most of the GLP-1 released from the duodenum and intestine before the peptide can<br>
reach the pancreas in the active form. Hydrolysis of GLP-17.36 by DPP-IV yields the<br>
truncated oligopeptide GLP-19-36 and the dipeptide His-Ala. This N- terminally<br>
truncated form is not insulinotropic and acts as an antagonist at GLP-1 receptor. GLP-<br>
1 is rapidly degraded in the circulation, which results in clearance that exceeds cardiac<br>
output and an apparent half-life of 1-1.5 min. The truncated metabolite is eliminated<br>
more slowly, with half-lives of 4-5 min for GLP-19-36. It has been speculated that<br>
DPP-IV-mediated hydrolysis is the primary mechanism of inactivation of this<br>
hormone in vivo (Tina et al, 2001).<br>
Because of rapid degradation, the effects of single injections of GLP-1 are<br>
short lasting and for a full demonstration of its anti-diabetogenic effects, continuous<br>
intravenous infusion is required. Therefore, it is proposed that the inhibition of DPP-<br>
IV, that elevate the levels of active GLP-1 and reduce the level of antagonistic<br>
metabolite, may be useful to treat impaired glucose tolerance and perhaps transition to<br>
type 2 diabetes.<br>
(Siegel et al (1999) reported that analogues of GLP-1 resistant to degradation<br>
by DPP-IV might help to realize the potential of GLP-1 in diabetes therapy.<br>
DPP-IV inhibitor, Isoleucine thiazolidide (P-32/98), completely inhibited the<br>
formation of GLP-19-36, an antagonist at GLP-1 receptor, when it was incubated with<br>
30 mM/L GLP-17-36 and serum for 21 hours. Inhibition of circulating DPP-IV<br>
enhanced insulin secretion and improved glucose tolerance in response to oral glucose<br>
challenge in lean and obese fatty (fa/fa) rats. (Raymond et al, 1998). Also it has<br>
improved glucose tolerance in zucker fatty rats (Robert et al, 1999)<br>
It is reported that a DPP-IV inhibitor NVP-DPP-728 i.e. l-[-2-{(5-<br>
cyanopyridin-2-yl) amino}ethylamino]acetyl-2-cyano-(S)-pyrrolidine inhibits DPP-<br>
IV activity and improves insulin secretion and glucose tolerance, through<br>
augmentation of the effects of endogenous GLP-1. The improvement in prandial<br>
glucose homeostasis during DPP-IV inhibition by this molecule suggests that<br>
inhibition of this enzyme is a promising target for treating type 2 diabetes (Balkan et<br>
al, 2000) Also this molecule showed potentiation of insulinotropic effects of GLP-1 in<br>
anaesthetized pig (Carolyn et al, 1998).<br>
These data support a therapeutic approach of drug manipulation of plasma<br>
incretin activity by lowering glucose levels in NIDDM and other disorders involving<br>
glucose intolerance.<br>
Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV (DPP - IV) is a proline specific protease and is<br>
involved in breaking peptide bonds before or after a proline residue. It plays an<br>
important role in the regulation of the life-time of biological active peptides like<br>
growth hormone releasing factor (GRF), Glucagon-like peptide - I (GLP-I), Gastric<br>
Inhibitory Polypeptide (GIP), Glucagon-like peptide - II (GLP-II), |3-Casomorphin,<br>
morphiceptin, Human Neuropeptide Y, Human Peptide YY (Augustyns K. et al.<br>
1999) DPP - IV is present on the surface of a subset of T-cells (lymphocytes) and has<br>
been recognized as CD 26 antigen.<br>
Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) is a serine protease, which cleaves N-<br>
terminal dipeptides from a peptide chain containing, preferably, a proline residue in<br>
the penultimate position. DPP-IV is responsible for inactivating glucagon-like<br>
peptide-1 (GLP-1). More particularly, DPP-IV cleaves the amino-terminal His-Ala<br>
dipeptide of GLP-1, generating a GLP-1 receptor antagonist, and thereby shortens the<br>
physiological response to GLP-1. Since the half-life for DPP-IV cleavage is much<br>
shorter than the half-life for removal of GLP-1 from circulation, a significant increase<br>
in GLP-1 bioactivity (5- to 10-fold) is anticipated from DPP-IV inhibition. Since<br>
GLP-1 is a major stimulator of pancreatic insulin secretion and has direct beneficial<br>
effects on glucose disposal, DPP-IV inhibition appears to represent an attractive<br>
approach for treating non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). GLP-1 has<br>
multifaceted actions, which include stimulation of insulin gene expression, trophic<br>
effects on P-cells, inhibition of glucagon secretion, promotion of satiety, and slowing<br>
of gastric emptying, all of which contribute to normalizing elevated blood glucose<br>
levels (Hoist and Deacon, 1998). Because of glucose dependency of the peptide and<br>
glucagonostatic actions, the glucose lowering effect is self-limiting, and the hormone,<br>
therefore does not cause hypoglycemia regardless of the dose.<br>
The exact biological functions of DPP - IV / CD 26 are still under<br>
investigation, but considerable evidence exists for the therapeutic potential of DPP-IV<br>
inhibitors.<br>
Although a number of DPP-IV inhibitors have been described, all have<br>
limitations relating to potency, stability or toxicity. Accordingly, a great need exists<br>
for novel DPP-IV inhibitors, which do not suffer from the above-mentioned<br>
limitations.<br>
Type - II Diabetes Mellitus: -<br>
DPP - IV is involved in the degradation of G1P and GLP-I. GIP and GLP-I are<br>
considered to be most important insulin-releasing hormones (incretins) comprising the<br>
enteroinsular axis. The term enteroinsular axis refers to the signaling pathways<br>
between the gut and pancreatic islets that amplify the insulin response to absorbed<br>
nutrients. Inhibition of circulating DPP - IV with orally administered lie-thiazolidine<br>
[DPP-IV inhibitor] enhanced insulin secretion and improved glucose tolerance in<br>
response to an oral glucose challenge in lean and obese Zucker rats. The enhanced<br>
incretin response was greater in obese than in lean animals, with a more profound<br>
improvement in glucose tolerance (Pederson R. A, 1998). This was attributed to<br>
disruption of DPP - IV inactivation of GIP and GLP-I, resulting in amplification of<br>
enteroinsular axis.<br>
DPP-IV inhibitors would have very little effect on subjects with normal blood<br>
glucose levels regardless of dose because its actions are glucose dependent<br>
(Qualmann C et al. 1995).<br>
Hyperthyroidism and glucose intolerance<br>
In patients with preexisting type I or type II diabetes mellitus, the presence of<br>
hyperthyroidism renders blood glucose management more difficult. Influences of<br>
thyroid hormone on insulin secretion and cellular metabolism have been implicated<br>
on the basis of in vitro and animal studies. In rats, thyroxine and triiodothyronine<br>
treatment inhibits the delayed phase of glucose-mediated insulin secretion-<br>
triiodothyronine being fivefold more potent than thyroxine.<br>
In hyperthyroid states, gluconeogenic precursor (lactate and glycerol) are<br>
present in increased concentration in plasma. In rats, increased activity of<br>
mitochondrial glycerol, phosphate oxidase increases the capacity for gluconeogenesis<br>
from glycerol. It has also been shown in rats and pigs that hyperthyroidism leads to an<br>
increase in futile cycling of glucose, which could contribute to hyperglycemia.<br>
Increased activity of several enzymes that could be implicated in the increase in<br>
gluconeogenesis have been seen in response to thyroid hormone, including<br>
glucokinase, pyruvate carboxylase, phospho-enolpyruvate carboxykinase, and<br>
glucose-6-phosphatase. Studies in hyperthyroid patients report impairment in insulin<br>
suppression of hepatic glucose production. A recent study has also shown the<br>
inability to increase the insulin response appropriately to hyperglycemia and increased<br>
proinsulin levels, both fasting and in response to a meal (Michael Berelowitz and<br>
Lone A Kourides, 2000). Glucose intolerance as a result of hyperthyroidism can be<br>
beiter managed by enhancing the levels of GLP-1 a glucose dependent insulinotrophic<br>
agent.<br>
Obesity and glucose intolerance<br>
Obesity has been related to insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Visceral<br>
obesity is associated with specific changes in skeletal muscle morphology that<br>
correlate with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, namely a reduction in capillary<br>
density and an increase in the proportion of "white" or "glycolytic" fibers which are<br>
less insulin sensitive than red (glycolytic) fibers. TNF-alpha is secreted by adipose<br>
tissue and its circulating levels parallel total body fat mass. Circulating non-esterified<br>
fatty acid (NEFA) levels are raised in obese subjects, especially those with visceral<br>
obesity. In the liver, NEFA are oxidised to acetyl CoA, which stimulates pyruvate<br>
carboxylase and therefore gluconeogenic production of glucose from pyruvate;<br>
hepatic glucose production therefore increases. High NEFA level may also inhibit<br>
glucose utilization by skeletal muscle. Increased acetyl CoA levels inhibit pyruvate<br>
dehydrogenase, thus decreasing glucose oxidation. The combination of increased<br>
hepatic glucose output and reduced peripheral uptake effectively antagonises and<br>
would ultimately lead to hyperglycemia (Ronald T Jung, 1997). Glucose intolerance<br>
as a result of the above conditions can be managed better by the elevation of GLP-1<br>
levels (as a result of DPP-IV inhibition).<br>
Cushing"s syndrome and glucose level<br>
Cushing"s syndrome represents a distinctive constellation of clinical features<br>
associated with prolonged overproduction of impaired glucose tolerance, overt<br>
diabetes (in approximately 20%), loss of libido and impotence. Some of these<br>
abnormalities such as obesity, deranged glucose metabolism are directly attributable<br>
to increased glucocorticoids. These glucocorticoids stimulate gluconeogenesis in<br>
diabetes. Also, they increase amino acid uptake by the liver and kidney and increase<br>
the activity of enzymes required for gluconeogenesis and may lead to hyperglycemia<br>
(Ronald A DeLellius, 1989)<br>
Glucose metabolism under the above conditions can be managed better by<br>
treatment with DPP-IV inhibitors.<br>

The role of CD26 in HIV infection is also not completely clear yet, but seems<br>
to be important. Some DPP-IV inhibitors are reported to inhibit HIV infection such<br>
as pyrrolidine-2-nitriles and an irreversible cyclopeptide inhibitor (Nguyen C et al.<br>
1998).<br>
DPP-IV has been originally described to be a marker of activated T<br>
lymphocytes and lately DPP-IV/CD26 molecular identity has been proven<br>
CD26/DPP-IV serves as an essential cofactor for HIV entry into CD4+ cells and that<br>
its enzyme activity is an important condition for this function (Sedo A and Kraml J,<br>
1994). Hence inhibition of DPP-IV could prove useful in the management of HIV<br>
infection.<br>
Immunosuppressant<br>
It has been shown that DPP-IV / CD26 plays an important role in the immune system<br>
by a number of possible mechanisms. The exact mechanism remains to be elucidated,<br>
but a few examples are reported where DPP-IV inhibitors are useful<br>
immunosuppressahts in vivo. A dipeptide diphenyl phosphonate ester was able to<br>
abrogate acute rejection and prolong allograft cardiac survival (Korom S. et al. 1997).<br>
Role of DPP-IV inhibitors in ulcers, hyperglucagonemia, gastric emptying and<br>
hunger<br>
DPP-IV inhibitors increase the level of GLP-1. GLP-1 has multifaceted<br>
actions, which include stimulation of insulin gene expression, inhibition of glucagon<br>
secretion, promotion of satiety, inhibition of food intake and slowing of gastric<br>
emptying (Hoist JJ and Deacon CF, 1998).<br>
GLP-1 also reduces gastric acid secretion (Michael A Nauck, 1999). Increase<br>
in gastric acid secretion is one the main reason for duodenal ulcers. By inhibiting<br>
gastric acid secretion, GLP-1 and therefore DPP-IV inhibitors may prove useful for<br>
the treatment of ulcers or can be used in combination with other antiulcer agents.<br>
Diarrhea<br>
DPP-IV is involved in metabolic processing of morphiceptin. Co-<br>
administration of a DPP- IV and the opiate peptide morphiceptin could be used in<br>
case of diarrhoea, as the experiment with DPP-IV deficient rats showed (Tiruppathi,<br>
C, et al., Am. J. Physiol. 1993).<br>
Mucosal Regeneration in patient with Intestinal Disease<br>
DPP-IV hydrolysis of GLP-2 is responsible for its inactivation. GLP-2 has<br>
recently been shown to display intestinal growth factor activity in rodents, raising the<br>
possibility that GLP-2 may be therapeutically useful for enhancement of mucosal<br>
regeneration in patients with intestinal disease (Drucker, D.J. et al. Diabetes 1998;<br>
47:159). The use of [Gly2] GLP-2, resistant to DPP-IV hydrolysis, increases small<br>
bowel weight in mice, predominantly due to a significant increase in villous height<br>
(Brubaker P.L. et al. Am. J. Physiol. 1997).<br>
Growth Hormone Deficiency<br>
Since GRF is also degraded by DPP-IV, the use of a DPP-IV inhibitor<br>
together with GRF could be useful to treat children with growth hormone deficiency<br>
(Augustyns K. et al. 1999)<br>
Neurological and Neuropsychological Disorders<br>
Administration of a suitable DPP-IV inhibitor leads as a causal consequence to<br>
a reduced degradation of the neuropeptide Y(NPY) in the brain of mammals. Such<br>
treatment will result in a reduction or delay in the decrease of the concentration of<br>
functionally active neuronal NPY (1-36). As a consequence of the resulting enhanced<br>
stability of the endogenous NPY (1-36), NPY activity is prolonged thereby resulting<br>
among other things in functionally active NPY YI receptor activity thereby<br>
facilitating antidepressive, anxiolytic, analgesic, antihypertension and other<br>
neurological effects (WO 02/34243 dated 02 May 2002 by PROBIODRUG AG).<br>
Cancers and Tumours<br>
DPP-IV is able to bind proteins of the extracellular matrix as a cell adhesion<br>
molecule. This has been interpreted from the observation that the DPP-IV inhibitors<br>
interfere in vitro with the initial spreading of rat hepatocytes on a matrix consisting of<br>
fibronectin and collagen. Thus the DPP-IV inhibitors could also be used for the<br>
prevention/treatment of cancer metastasis and rumour colonization (WO 03/002595<br>
dated 09 Jan 2003 by PROBIODRUG AG).<br>
Free Radical Scavenging Activity<br>
It has been reported that compounds exhibiting free radical scavenging activity<br>
are useful in treatment of Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer"s Disease,<br>
Parkinson"s Disease, Huntingdon"s Disease, Motor Neuron Disease, Prion Disease etc,<br>
(b) Diabetes and Diabetic Vascular Complications, (c) Intestinal Diseases such as<br>
Intestinal Ischemia, Radiation Enteritis, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Gastric and<br>
Colorectal Cancers etc., (d) Liver Diseases such as Alcoholic Liver Disease, Chronic<br>
Hepatitis C etc., (e) Cancers such as Lung Cancer, Colorectal Cancer, Cervical<br>
Cancer, Breast Cancer, Malignant Melanoma etc, (f) Cardiac Diseases such as<br>
Atherosclerosis, Myocardial Infarction, Ischemic Stroke, Endothelial Dysfunction<br>
etc., (g) Opthalmic Disorders such as Cataract formation, Macular degeneration etc.,<br>
(h) HIV Diseases, (i) Respiratory Diseases such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary<br>
Diseases, Asthma etc., (j) Renal Diseases such as Glomerulonephritis, Acute Renal<br>
Failure etc.<br>
Neuro-degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer"s disease (A.D.),<br>
Parkinson"s disease (P. D.), Huntington"s disease (H.D.), Motor neuron disease<br>
(M.N.D), Prion disease<br>
As people age, their antioxidant levels diminish and these low levels are<br>
directly linked to the many diseases associated with aging such as Alzheimer"s and<br>
Parkinson"s disease. One of the leading hypotheses is that oxidative stress induced by<br>
ROS damages essential components of the neurons, resulting ultimately in the<br>
neuronal death. Oxidative stress is involved in various divergent events leading to<br>
neuronal damage, including an increase in membrane rigidity, DNA strand break, and<br>
impairment in glucose uptake. Several potential sources of oxidative stress in different<br>
neurodegenerative disorders have been well identified (Munch G, et al. 1998).<br>
In A.D. mitochondrial dysfunction, amyloid beta mediated processes;<br>
transition metal accumulation and genetic factors are responsible for the redox<br>
imbalance (Smith MA, et al. 2000).<br>
Point mutations in Superoxide Dismutase enzymes are known in the familial<br>
form of MND.<br>
Disturbances of neuronal energy metabolism have been implicated as a<br>
pathogenetic mechanism for H.D. (Browne SE, et al. 1999)<br>
Diabetes and Diabetic Vascular Complications (DVCs)<br>
The cause of oxidative stress in diabetes is not yet fully understood but is<br>
thought to be due to mitochondrial dysfunction, direct enzyme inhibition by<br>
hyperglycemia, auto-oxidation of glucose, and activation of nicotinamide-adenine<br>
dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-oxidase. Oxidative stress in diabetes is also<br>
increased due to weakened defenses due to reduced endogenous antioxidants. The<br>
oxidative stress manifests itself as elevated concentrations of lipid peroxidation<br>
products, erythrocyte fragility, and decreases in the antioxidant enzyme systems<br>
(CAT, GSH Px, SOD). Recent studies also have shown a positive correlation between<br>
blood glucose concentration and oxidant-induced lymphocyte DNA damage (E.J.<br>
Harper The 24th Annual WALTHAM®/OSU SYMPOSIUM).<br>
ROS are generated during glucose oxidation and formation of advanced<br>
glycation end products (AGE). Evidence has accumulated indicating that the<br>
generation of ROS plays an important role in the development of DVCs. Many<br>
biochemical pathways associated with hyperglycemia such as advanced glycosylation,<br>
glucose auto oxidation, and polyol pathway can increase the production of free<br>
radicals. Hyperglycemia in diabetic patients leads to excess auto-oxidation of glucose<br>
thereby reducing molecular oxygen and yielding oxidizing intermediates such as<br>
superoxide ions (O2-), hydroxyl radicals (OH), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Free<br>
radicals accelerate the formation of advanced glycosylation end products (AGE),<br>
because fragmentation and conformational changes occurring during glycosylation<br>
and glucose oxidation have been shown to be dependent upon free radicals. AGEs in<br>
turn supply more free radicals; this process is termed as oxidative glycosylation or<br>
glycoxidation. These free radicals impair vascular relaxation by inactivating or<br>
quenching nitric oxide (NO) and also adversely affect the endothelial function.<br>
Evidence also suggests that Maillard reaction acts as an amplifier of oxidative damage<br>
in aging and diabetes.<br>
Intestinal diseases<br>
Oxidative stress is an important cause of tissue injury that occurs in<br>
inflammation and ischemia. Intestinal ischemia, radiation enteritis, inflammatory<br>
bowel disease, and promotion of gastric and colorectal cancers are some of the<br>
gastro-intestinal conditions where oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis.<br>
Liver diseases<br>
Alcoholic liver disease- Ethanol induces an increase in lipid peroxidation<br>
either by enhancing ROS or decreasing the level of endogenous antioxidants. Ethanol<br>
also induces variety of cytochrome P450 enzymes in microsomes and xanthine<br>
oxidases in cytosol. The role of these enzymes in the generation of oxidative stress<br>
has been well established in various studies (Ishii H, et al. 1997).<br>
Chronic hepatitis C- Enhanced oxidative stress initiates a fibrogenesis cascade<br>
in the liver of patients with chronic hepatitis C. Evidences are coming up supporting<br>
an oxidative stress pathway leading to active fibrogenesis in chronic hepatitis C. This<br>
fibrogenesis cascade characteristic of severe chronic hepatitis C (e.g., oxidative stress,<br>
induction of c-myb, activation of stellate cells, and collagen gene expression) is<br>
stimulated by ROS.<br>
Cancers<br>
Oxidative damage to DNA is a result of interaction of DNA with ROS, in<br>
particular the hydroxyl radical. The hydroxyl radicals produce multiple modifications<br>
in DNA. Oxidative attack by OH radical on the deoxyribose moiety leads to the<br>
release of free bases from DNA, generating strand breaks with various sugar<br>
modifications and simple abasic (AP) sites<br>
ROS also interact with and modify cellular protein, lipid, and DNA, which<br>
results in altered target cell function. The accumulation of oxidative damage has been<br>
implicated in both acute and chronic cell injury including possible participation in the<br>
formation of cancer. Acute oxidative injury may produce selective cell death and a<br>
compensatory increase in cell proliferation. This stimulus may result in the formation<br>
of newly initiated preneoplastic cells and/or enhance the selective clonal expansion of<br>
latent initiated preneoplastic cells. Similarly, sublethal acute oxidative injury may<br>
produce unrepaired DNA damage and result in the formation of new mutations and,<br>
potentially, new initiated cells. ROS, therefore, can have multiple effects in the<br>
initiation stage of carcinogenesis by mediating carcinogen activation, causing DNA<br>
damage, and interfering with the repair of the DNA damage.<br>
Benefits of various antioxidants in preventing or treating following cancers<br>
have been extensively studied.<br>
1) Lung cancer<br>
2) Colorectal cancer<br>
3) Cervical cancer<br>
4) Breast cancer<br>
5) Malignant melanoma<br>
Oxidative stress in cardiac diseases<br>
Lifelong high levels of antioxidant nutrients are supposed to protect against<br>
the development of heart disease. High doses of antioxidants in the month following<br>
an acute heart attack have been shown to significantly reduce the number of deaths, as<br>
well as the extent of cardiac damage in non-fatal cases.<br>
It is currently thought that increase in oxidative stress is involved in the<br>
pathophysiology of endothelial dysfunction that accompanies a number of<br>
cardiovascular risk factors including hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and cigarette<br>
smoking. It also plays a pivotal role in the evolution of clinical conditions such as<br>
atherosclerosis and heart failure. Oxidative stress can activate redox-sensitive kinase<br>
cascades and transcription factors such as NFKB and AP-1, with resulting increases in<br>
the expression of factors associated with an inflammatory response and cellular<br>
proliferation. There are three enzyme systems producing reactive oxygen species in<br>
the vascular wall: NADH/NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidoreductase, and endothelial<br>
nitric oxide synthase (Zalba G.et al, 2000, Rosenfeld ME, 1998).<br>
Atherogenesis is regarded as the outcome of interactions among multiple<br>
stimuli. Endothelial dysfunction plays a key role in the development of<br>
atherosclerosis. Elevated homocysteine concentrations are associated with rapid<br>
onset endothelial dysfunction, which is another mechanism by which increased<br>
oxidative stress contributes to atherosclerosis. Oxidation of low-density lipoprotein<br>
plays an important role at several steps in atherogenesis. Oxidative stress also<br>
activates NFkB, which induces expression of genes controlling cytokine expression<br>
and leukocyte adhesion to vascular wall. (Maxwell, et al. 1997).<br>
Animal studies have provided evidence by suggesting that free radicals may<br>
promote thrombosis, directly damage vascular cells and other tissues, and interfere<br>
with vasomotor regulation with the clinical sequelae of myocardial infarction and<br>
ischemic stroke.<br>
In tissues where oxygen supply becomes used up following ischemia, as in<br>
myocardial ischemia, the enzyme xanthine oxidase is changed to a form that has<br>
potential to reduce oxygen to superoxides. On readmission of oxygen e.g. by<br>
reperfusion there is a burst of free radical generation. ROS are formed at an<br>
accelerated rate in post-ischemic myocardium. Thus biochemical damage due to free<br>
radicals contributes to the ischemic injury.<br>
Oxidative stress also seems to be one of the mechanisms that may produce<br>
membrane defects and result in intracellular calcium overload, and cardiac contractile<br>
dysfunction in the stunned myocardium.<br>
Macular degeneration and cataract<br>
Oxidative damage to lens of the eye with increase in age has a major<br>
contribution in cataract formation. Macular degeneration is also being recognized as a<br>
consequence of oxidative damage.<br>
HIVdisease<br>
Perturbation of anti-oxidant defense system has been observed in various<br>
tissues in HIV patients. Oxidative stress may contribute to several aspects of HIV<br>
disease pathogenesis such as viral replication, inflammatory response, and decreased<br>
immune cell proliferation, loss of immune function, apoptosis, chronic weight loss.<br>
Antioxidants may offer a promising treatment to HIV patients.<br>
Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD)<br>
Alteration in the alveolar and lung metabolism of glutathione is widely<br>
recognized as a central feature of many inflammatory lung diseases including COPD.<br>
These changes are a result of the alteration in the gene expression of the gamma-<br>
glutamyl cystine synthase (Gamma-GCS), the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione<br>
synthesis. Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of COPD, since it results<br>
in inactivation of anti proteinases, airspace epithelial injury, mucus hypersecretion,<br>
increased influx of neutrophils into the lungs, transcription factor activation and gene<br>
expression of pro-inflammatory mediators (MacNee W, et al. 2001).<br>
Renal Disease<br>
ROS have been implicated not only in the genesis of different forms of renal<br>
disease, predominantly experimentally induced glomerulonephritis, but also in<br>
different forms of acute renal failure.<br>
Asthma<br>
Although the pathogenesis of asthma is not fully defined, a typical feature is<br>
an increase in the number of inflammatory cells in the lung. Such cells generate ROS,<br>
which are involved in the pathophysiology of asthma, including airway smooth<br>
muscle contraction, increased airway reactivity, and increased vascular permeability.<br>
Effect of antioxidant status on immunologic function<br>
The immune system is particularly sensitive to oxidative stress, primarily<br>
because immune cells rely heavily on cell-to-cell communication to work effectively.<br>
Peroxidation of cell membranes compromises membrane integrity and disrupts<br>
intracellular signaling.<br>
Cataract:<br>
Oxidative damage to lens of eye with increase in age has been a major<br>
contribution in cataract formation.<br>
Thus, by scavenging the free radicals, the following diseases can be treated or<br>
controlled:<br>
1) Neurodegenerati ve di sorders<br>
(a) Alzheimer"s Disease<br>

OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The first object of the present invention is to provide a new class of<br>
compounds which normalize elevated blood glucose levels in diabetic patients thereby<br>
delaying diabetic complications and preventing transition to type II diabetes in<br>
impaired glucose tolerant patients.<br>
These compounds exhibit in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity. DPP-FV<br>
inhibitors enhance the level of active GLP-1, which would be advantageous in<br>
treating hyperglycemia. Added advantage is that there is no risk of hypoglycemia,<br>
since GLP-1 increases glucose mediated insulin secretion. Due to non-peptide nature<br>
of the compounds, they can be conveniently administered orally. The increase in<br>
GLP-1 level in the active form provides for multifaceted action in respect of increase<br>
in insulin level, decrease in glucagon level, neogenesis of pancreatic B-cell,<br>
stimulation of insulin gene expression, and promotion of satiety, all of which<br>
contribute to beneficial effects in a diabetic patient.<br>

hyperthyroidism, HIV infection, obesity, ulcers, disorders related to<br>
hyperglucagonemia, gastric emptying and hunger in required dosage in admixture<br>
with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, solvents, excepients, carriers or other<br>
media as may be appropriate for the purpose.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a class of compounds having<br>
free radical scavenging activity which are useful for treatment of (a)<br>
Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer"s Disease, Parkinson"s Disease,<br>
Huntington"s Disease, Motor Neuron Disease, Prion Disease etc, (b) Diabetes and<br>
Diabetic Vascular Complications, (c) Intestinal Diseases such as Intestinal Ischemia,<br>

such as Cataract formation, Macular degeneration etc., (h) HIV Diseases, (i)<br>
Respiratory Diseases such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases, Asthma etc.,<br>
(j) Renal Diseases such as Glomerulonephritis, Acute Renal Failure etc.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a method of<br>
preparation of these compounds.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to provide a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising said compound in association with a pharmaceutical<br>
acceptable carrier, diluent or excepients.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a method of treatment and/or<br>
prophylaxis of mammals including human beings for diseases relating to glucose<br>
intolerance and/or disease conditions caused by accumulation of free radicals in the<br>
body cells.<br>

Assay of DPP-IV enzyme inhibitory activity.<br>
The assay method is a modified method (as described by Welch et al, 1998)<br>
based on spectrophotometric determination of the product formed by penultimate<br>
proline cleaving activity of the enzyme.<br>
The following equation explains the principle of the assay method:<br>
( <br>
Gly-Pro-pNA: Glycine-Proline-p-nitroanilide<br>
Assay protocol involves incubation of the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV<br>
with the test substance at 30° C for 30 min followed by addition of this reaction<br>
mixture to the substrate Gly-Pro-pNA that was equilibrated at 30° C for 2 min. The<br>
enzyme cleaves the substrate at penultimate proline and releases p-nitroanilide, the<br>
optical density of which is measured at 385 nm. The formation of p-nitroanilide will<br>
be reduced in the presence of inhibitor. Optical density is measured for 2 hours for<br>
every 10min using a spectrophotometer and Vmax is calculated to find the activity of<br>
new chemical entities. The activity of molecule is expressed in terms of % inhibition.<br>
Atleast three different concentrations were tried out for each of the test substances.<br>
The percentage inhibitions for each of the concentrations were plotted and an IC50 of<br>
the test compound was worked out. The enzyme inhibitory activity of different test<br>
compounds were compared based on the IC50 values.<br>
The percentage inhibition %I, is calculated using the formula:<br>
% I = [(t-Vj/vo)]*100 where v, and v0 are the Vmax values with and without the test<br>
substance, respectively.<br>
Reagents and their preparation:<br>
Substrate solution: 0.5 mM in 45 mM phosphate buffer<br>
Substrate used: Gly-Pro-p-nitroanilide (Source: Sigma-Aldrich Co. Germany)<br>
M. Wt of Gly-Pro-p-nitroanilide =328.8<br>
3.288 mg substrate in 1 ml 45 mM phosphate buffer was prepared as stock solution.<br>
0.25 ml of this stock solution was diluted to 5 ml to get 0.5 mM substrate solution (90<br>
µl to be added in each well). The stock solution of the substrate was used within three<br>
days of preparation.<br>
Enzyme solution: Porcine DPP-IV (Sigma-Aldrich Germany) was used throughout the<br>
study. 0.4 mU in 80 µl of Tris. HC1 buffer was prepared. Fresh solutions were<br>
prepared everyday for the assays.<br>
Inhibitor solution:<br>
The compounds of the present invention were dissolved in their respective vehicles.<br>
E.g. 1. Compound No.95 (in MilliQ water)<br>
Mol. Wt. of Compound No.95 : 779<br>
Various concentrations of inhibitor were used: 0.391µM, 0.781µM, and 3.125 µM.<br>
Solutions of inhibitor were prepared and used on the same day.<br>
Experimental Procedure:<br>
Different concentrations of inhibitor (compound 95), vehicle, substrate and<br>
enzyme were prepared as per standard procedures. 280 µl of enzyme solution (0.4-<br>
mU/80 µl in Tris HC1 buffer) was added to the eppendorf containing 70 µl solution of<br>
inhibitor or vehicle and mixed. This reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 30<br>
°C. The 96 well plate containing substrate solution was thermally equilibrated in the<br>
spectrophotometer for 2 min at 30°C. Later 100 µl of the enzyme-inhibitor pre-<br>
incubation solution was added to respective wells in a 96 well plate. Each<br>
concentration of the inhibitor was tested in triplicates.<br>
The rate of change in UV absorbance (in presence of various concentrations of<br>
the inhibitor) was measured at 385 nm, with respect to wells containing only 0.5 mM<br>
substrate in 45 mM phosphate buffer as blank at every 10 min for 2 hours after adding<br>
enzyme-inhibitor mixture to wells containing substrate solution.<br>

The inhibitory activity of the compounds on DPP-IV enzyme activity<br>
Note : The IC50 values for compounds 1-32 as reported in the provisional specification<br>
No.60/370,224, which is incorporated in the instant patent application by reference, were<br>
subjected to same experimental procedure as reported here to determine 1C50 values.<br>
However, in view of an erronious dilution factor taken for calculation of IC50 values in<br>
the provisional specification, the reported figures, though showing the same trend of<br>
activity are 9.5 times of the figures reported above for the compounds 1,3,4,9,10,12-23<br>
and 25-30 recalculated by using the correct dilution factor.<br>
Invivo oral glucose tolerance studies<br>
The anti-hyperglycemic effect of compound no. 95 (8mg/ml/kg, i.v) after an oral<br>
glucose load of lgm/kg was studied in STZ induced diabetic rats (modified method of<br>
Balkan et al 1999).<br>
Animals: Male STZ induced diabetic rats aged 10-12 weeks and weighing between<br>
200-250gm were used for the study. These rats were treated with streptozotocin<br>
administered intraperitoneally on the day of birth at a dose of 90 mg/kg. They were<br>
maintained under standard conditions till the age of 10-12 weeks when they were used for<br>
the study.<br>
Materials: Glucose solution (lgm/4ml of saline), Diethyl ether<br>
compound no. 95 (8mg/ml/kg), vehicle (1 ml/kg),<br>
Heparinized saline (lOOIU/ml), glucometer and strips<br>
Method: Animals were divided into two groups<br>
Group I: 8 hours fasted rats were treated with compound no. 95 vehicle (1 ml/kg, i.v.)<br>
5 min before administration of glucose load.<br>
Group II: 8 hours fasted rats were treated with compound no. 95 (8mg/ ml/kg, i.v) 5<br>
min before administration of glucose load.<br>
In both groups, blood samples were taken before administration of vehicle/<br>
compound no. 95 and glucose load for blood glucose estimation. Blood glucose level<br>
before administration of compound no. 95 or its vehicle was considered as -5 min<br>
reading. Blood glucose level before administration of glucose was considered as 0<br>
min reading.<br>
After 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120, 150 and 180 min of glucose<br>
administration, blood glucose level was estimated by the glucose oxidase method<br>
using a LifeScan glucometer (Ca, USA). Blood glucose level at various time points<br>
was subtracted from the basal (0 min) reading. This was done to avoid changes in<br>
AUC because of variation in basal glucose level. The glucose excursion at various<br>
time points was plotted against time and the AUC was calculated.<br>
The activity of compound no. 95 was expressed as % reduction in AUC as<br>
compared with that of its vehicle.<br>
RESULTS:<br>

free Radical Scavenging activity;<br>
1 .Aim:<br>
To determine the in-vitro free radical scavenging activity of compounds of<br>
general formula-1 on 2,2,-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)radical (Ref: W.<br>
Brand- Williams, M.E.Cuvelier, C. Berset "Use of a free radical method to<br>
evaluate antioxidant activity ", Lebensm.- Wiss.u.Technol.,1995,28,Nr. 1:25-30).<br>
2.Principle involved:<br>
To evaluate the free radical scavenging activity of compounds they are allowed to<br>
react with stable radical DPPH . In its radical form, DPPH absorbed at the<br>
characteristic wave length of 5l5nm, but upon reduction by an antioxidant or<br>
radical scavenger (AH), the absorption disappears.<br><br>
3. Reagents and Chemicals:<br>
DPPH" ( Sigma Aldrich)<br>
Methanol (Merck)<br>
4. Instrument used:<br>
UV-visible spectrophotometer (Jasco)<br>
Quartz Microcuvette (1ml capacity)<br>
5. Procedure:<br>
Preparation of DPPH solution:<br>
10-4M solution of DPPH was prepared in methanol.<br>
Preparation of drug solution:<br>
Various concentrations (10mM,1mM, 0.5mM,0.25mM and 0.125mM) of drug<br>
solutions were prepared in methanol.<br>
Preparation of Control solution:<br>
900µl of DPPH radical solution was added to an eppendorf tube. To it was<br>
added 100µl of methanol.<br>
Preparation of Test solution:<br>
900µl of DPPH radical solution was added to an eppendorf tube. To it was<br>
added 100µl of various concentrations of drug solutions in methanol.<br>
Measurement of absorbance (O.D):<br>
The absorbance of control and test samples was recorded after incubation at<br>
30°C for 30 minutes, at 515nm taking methanol as blank.<br>
6. Calculation:<br>
The percent antioxidant activity was calculated according to the formula:<br>
% Antioxidant activity = 100-[O.D of test sample/O.D of control* 100]<br>
The test compounds listed in the Table 3 above exhibit invitro (antioxidant)<br>
free radical scavenging activity. Excessive production of free radicals; reactive<br>
oxygen species (ROS) results in oxidative stress . Therefore, these molecules would<br>
be very effective in reducing oxidative stress by their ability to trap ROS.<br>
Antioxidants (free radicals scavengers) are reported to be effective in the<br>
management of various diseases linked with oxidative stress.<br>
Also, the novel compounds show Free Radical Scavenging Activity which is<br>
useful for (a) Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer"s Disease, Parkinson"s<br>
Disease, Huntington"s Disease, Motor Neuron Disease, Prion Disease etc, (b)<br>
Diabetes and Diabetic Vascular Complications, (c) Intestinal Diseases such as<br>
Intestinal Ischemia, Radiation Enteritis, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Gastric and<br>
Colorectal Cancers etc., (d) Liver Diseases such as Alcoholic Liver Disease, Chronic<br>
Hepatitis C etc., (e) Cancers such as Lung Cancer, Colorectal Cancer, Cervical<br>
Cancer, Breast Cancer, Malignant Melanoma etc., (f) Cardiac Diseases such as<br>
Atherosclerosis, Myocardial Infarction, Ischemic Stroke, Endothelial Dysfunction<br>
etc., (g) Opthalmic Disorders such as Cataract formation, Macular degeneration etc.,<br>
(h) HIV Diseases, (i) Respiratory Diseases such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary<br>
Diseases, Asthma etc., (j) Renal Diseases such as Glomerulonephritis, Acute Renal<br>
Failure etc.<br>
Discussion of Test Results :<br>
Oral glucose tolerance test is one of the methods to test pre-diabetic or<br>
diabetic condition and to evaluate insulin secretagogues and/or releasers. Glucose<br>
level in the body is mainly controlled by insulin although many other factors<br>
contribute to insulin release. Administration of glucose by oral route will increase the<br>
glucose level in the blood, which induces the release of insulin. This glucose<br>
stimulated insulin release is impaired in diabetes. By pretreatment with drugs that<br>
releases or stimulates insulin release before taking food/glucose, the rise in glucose<br>
level can be controlled.<br>
Figure-2 and Table-2 show a distinct decrease in the compound no. 95 treated<br>
animal"s blood glucose values as compared to the corresponding vehicle treated<br>
group. This is also reflected in the decrease in AUC of glucose in compound no. 95<br>
treated group as compared to vehicle group. From the graphs shown in figures 1 and 2<br>
it is evident that compound no. 95 controls hyperglycemia and brings the glucose<br>
levels to normoglycemic range. Please note that the negative values do not represent<br>
hypoglycemia; it is only a fall below the basal hyperglycemic level. This could be<br>
explained by an increase in glucose mediated insulin secretion by compound no. 95.<br>
Hence, it is concluded that compound no. 95 would be a useful in the management of<br>
hyperglycemia in type II diabetes.<br>
Free radicals along with AGE formation contributes to macroangiopathic<br>
(atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease) and microangiopathic (neuropathy,<br>
retinopathy, nephropathy) complication of diabetes.<br>
The test compounds listed in Table-3 exhibit in vitro (antioxidant) free radical<br>
scavenging activity. The novel compounds show free radical scavenging activity,<br>
which would be useful for treatment of diabetes and diabetic vascular complications<br>
(DVCs).<br>
The DPP-IV inhibitors under study are preferably expected to not only control<br>
diabetes, but also to prevent diabetic complications by their antioxidant actions.<br>
Compound numbers 78, 95, 99, 104, 108 and 115 showed prominent<br>
dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitory actions with their IC50"s in the range of 88 to 250<br>
nM. These compounds could be used to prevent the degradation of the<br>
insulinotrophic hormone GLP-1; and thereby elevate their circulating levels. These<br>
compounds are expected to exert their anti-hyperglycemic action in a glucose<br>
dependent way and hence the usual side effect of hypoglycemia observed with the<br>
classical sulphonylureas would not be observed.<br>
Preparation of represcntaive compounds of the invention :<br>
The compounds of the invention may be prepared by alternative synthetic<br>
routes as per Scheme I, II or III as described below:<br>
Reagents and conditions for Scheme -1:<br>
[a] (I) Et3N, THF, K2CO3, CICH2COCl, 0-20°C, 2.5-3.0 hrs. (II) (CF3CO)2O / THF ;<br>

[c] CF3COOOH, Room Temp., 10-20 min.<br>
[d] Hexane / Reflux, 2-4 hrs.<br>
[e] NaBH4, MeOH, Reflux, 4-20 hrs.<br>
[f] Neat, Reflux.<br>
[g] (i) Aldehyde/ketone, MeOH, Reflux, (ii) NaCNBH3, TiCl4, MeOH<br>
[h] (i) R8NHCOC1 or R8SO2C1 or R8COCl, TEA, THF, 0-20°C (ii) [c]<br>
Description:<br>
The compounds of present invention may be prepared by the general methods<br>
as depicted in Scheme (I). The starting amide compound of formula (1) i.e L —<br>
prolinamide is prepared in four steps from L-proline following the same methods as<br>
described in literature for the synthesis of (R)-(-)-thiazolidine-4-amide of formula (2)<br>
from the corresponding acid.<br>
Ref. US pat-6110949 dated 29.8.00, Doreen M et al, Bio.Org. Med. Chem.<br>
Lett. 6(22), 1996, 2745-48]. L-prolinamide (1) is then converted to 1-chloroacetyl-2-<br>
cyanopyrrolidine of formula (3) in two steps which involves chloroacylation of the<br>
amide followed by dehydration [Ref. US pat -6124305 dated 26.09.00, WO-<br>
0034241 dated 15.06.00 and US pat 6011155 dated 01.04.00].<br>
In a similar manner, the another starting material 3-chloroacetyl-4-cyano<br>
thiazolidine of formula (4) is prepared by following two step reactions sequence.<br>
Step-1 involves the reaction of thiazolidine amide of formula (2) with<br>
chloroacetylchloride in presence of a base such as potassium carbonate and an inert<br>
organic solvent like tetrahydrofuran at a temperature of from 0 °C to 20 °C for 2.5 to 3<br>
hrs. Step 2 involves the dehydration of 3-chloroacetyl-thiazolidine-4-amide prepared<br>
in step-1, with 2-equivalents of trifluroacetic anhydride conducted in presence of an<br>
inert organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at a temperature preferably at 20 C.<br>
The second major component of the present invention i.e. N-2-substituted -<br>
tertbutyl carbazates of formulae (18) and (19), is prepared by the conventional<br>
manner. The tert-butyl alkylidine carbazates of formula (17) is prepared by refluxing<br>
hexane or tetrahydrofuran solution of tert-butyl carbazate (15) with appropriate<br>
aldehyde or ketone of formula (16) in 1:1 molar ratio for 2-4 hrs. [Ref. Dutta Anand<br>
S et.al., J.Chem. Soc.Perkin I, 1975, 1712-1720. Ghali N.I et al, J.Org.Chem. 46,<br>
1981,5413-5414].<br>
The alkylidine carbazates thus formed in the previous step is reduced to N-2<br>
substituted —tert-butyl carbazates of formula (18) using metal hydrides like sodium<br>
borohydride or lithium aluminium hydride, preferably sodium borohydride and<br>
Sodium cyanoborohydride. The solvent used in the reaction is organic solvent like<br>
methanol or tetrahydrofuran at a temperature ranging from 25°C to 70°C for 4 to 20<br>
hrs.<br>
On the other hand, direct alkylation of tert-butyl carbazate with alkyl or aryl<br>
halides preferably with the corresponding chlorides or bromides either in neat<br>
reaction condition or in presence of an inorganic base such as potassium carbonate<br>
and a catalyst such as potassium iodide in presence of THF provides carbazate<br>
derivatives of formula (19). Coupling of chloroacyl derivatives of formula (3) or (4)<br>
with the tert-butyl carbazate derivatives (18) or (19) in presence of K2CO3 /KI in THF<br>
gives rise to hydrazinoacyl derivatives (11),(7),(12) or (8) which on deprotection<br>
using trifluoroaceticacid provides the final compounds (13), (9a),(14) or (10a)<br>
respectively as trifluoroacetate salts and further reaction of 9(a) or 10(a) with<br>
appropriate aldehyde followed by reduction using metal hydride like sodium<br>
borohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride in presence of catalytic compound of TiCl4<br>
(Titanium tetrachloride) gives rise to compounds 9(b) or 10(b).<br>
Similar reaction of 9(a) or 10(a) with appropriate acid chloride or sulfonyl<br>
chloride gives rise to respective compounds 9(c) or 10(c).<br>
Alternatively, the hydrazino derivatives (5) or (6) can be prepared from the<br>
corresponding chloroacyl derivatives (3) or (4) by reaction with tert-butyl carbazate<br>
itself. Alkylation of (5) or (6) with alkyl halides gives rise to penultimate<br>
intermediates (7) or (8) respectively.<br>
Also, the reaction of compound (5) or (6) with appropriate carbamoyl<br>
chloride, sulphonyl chloride or acid chloride followed by deprotection with<br>
trifluroacetic acid gives rise to compound 5(a) or 6(a) respectively.<br>

In an another embodiment of the present invention in which compounds,<br>
wherein the value of "k" mentioned in the general formula (I) is "null", then R4 and<br>
R6 together form optionally six or seven membered ring optionally containing two or<br>
three heteroatoms independently selected from O, S and NR7, with R1 is hydrogen,<br>
and N1 is attached to hydrogen. As described represented by the formula (II),<br>
compounds may be prepared by the general methods as depicted in Scheme-II.<br><br>
Piperazine-2-carboxylic acid dihydrochloride (20) is first protected by using<br>
usual protecting groups like Boc (tert-butyloxycarbonyl) or CBZ<br>
(benzyloxycarbonyl). The protected acid (21.) is subjected to coupling with L-<br>
prolinamide (1) or (R)-(-)-thiazolidine-4-amide (2) to give the coupled products (23)<br>
or (24). This can either be done by first dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) mediated<br>
coupling of the acid (21) with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NOSU) to form the active ester<br>
(22) followed by its reaction with the amides ( 1 or 2 ), or by direct coupling of the<br>
protected acid (21) with the amides ( 1 or 2.) in presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole<br>
(HOBT), DCC and the tertiaryamine like, diisopropylethyl amine (DIEA).<br>
Dehydration of the coupled products (23 or 24) using trifluroacetic anhydride as<br>
dehydrating agent provides the corresponding cyano derivatives (25. or 26).<br>
Deprotection of the compounds (25 or 26) in presence of trifluroacetic acid followed<br>
by regioselective functionalization of the deprotected compounds (22 or 28) at N-4 of<br>
piperazine ring using alkyl or aryl halides, or with acyl or sulphonyl halides yield the<br>
target compounds as represented by formula (29,30).They (29,30) can optionally be<br>
purified by reprotecting them at N-1 of the piperazine ring with a non-polar<br>
protecting group like Boc group, thereby, making these compounds more non polar,<br>
followed by deprotection of Boc group of this column purified intermediate using<br>
trifluroacetic acid results in the formation of final compounds as trifiuroacetate salts<br>
(3L32).<br>

trichlorophenyl chloroformate (34). prepared from 2,4,5-trichlorophenol and trimethyl<br>
chloroformate (33) by the method as described in the literature, in presence of<br>
triethylamine as base results in the formation of carbazate derivatives (35) [Ref.<br>

thiazolidine amide (2) in presence of a tertiary amine as a base preferably<br>
triethylamine in an organic solvent like THF under reflux for 4-10 hrs. give the<br>
coupled products (36,37). These amide derivatives (36,37) can also be obtained by<br>
chlorocarbonylation of tert-butyl-carbazates (18) with trichloromethyl chloroformate<br>
(33) in presence of Et3N at a low temperature(-5° to 0°C), followed by coupling of the<br>
amides (1,2) with the chlorocarbonyl derivative of carbazates (38) in presence of Et3N<br>
/ THF at a temperature ranging from 25° to 60°C for 8-12 hrs.<br>
Subsequently usual dehydration of the amide derivatives (36,37) with<br>
trifluoroacetic anhydride in THF at a temperature from 5° to 30°C for 2-4 hrs.<br>
followed by deprotection of the corresponding cyano derivatives (39,40) with a<br>
deprotecting agent like trifluoroacetic acid at a temperature in the range of 5°C to<br>
30°C for 0.5 to 2 hrs, results in the formation of the final compounds (41,42) as<br>
trifluoroacetate salts. They can optionally be purified by neutralizing with an aqueous<br>
alkali like sodium bicarbonate (aqueous), purifying the free base thus obtained by<br>
column chromatography followed by converting to hydrochloride salts (43,44) by<br>
treating with methanolic hydrochloric acid at 10°C to 20°C for 1 to 2 hrs.<br>

room temperature for 2 hrs. Excess TFA and CH3CN removed in vacuo followed by<br>
stripping off with toluene and methanol respectively results in the formation of<br>
deprotected product as trifluoroacetate salt. (Yield 0.52g, 97.32%).<br>
Step-5<br>
To a solution of the deprotected compound (0.64g, 1.46 mmol) as obtained in<br>
step-4, in acetone (30ml), was added triethylamine (0.45g, 4.45 mmol), K2CO3 (0.3g,<br>
2.17 mmol) and isopropyl bromide (0.23g, 1.88mmol) and refluxed for 15 hrs. The<br>
reaction mixture is filtered and the filtrate is evaporated in vacuo to give the product<br>
as an oily residue. (Yield 0.2g, 54.51%).<br>
The crude material thus obtained is purified as follows:<br>
The compound is protected using di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (0.18g, 0.82 mmol)<br>
and NaOH (0.05g, 1.25 mmol) in the same way as described in step-1 and purified by<br>
column chromatography (50% ethyl acetate/hexane). (Yield 0.15g, 53.57%). This is<br>
finally deprotected using trifluoroacetic acid (2ml) resulting in the formation of the<br>
final product as trifluoroacetate salt. (Yield 0.1 lg, 53.92%).<br>
Representative example of Scheme III:<br>
Example - 6<br>
[4-Cyano-3-(1-cyclohexylhydrazino) carbonyl thiazolidine hydrochloride]<br>
(Compound No. 33).<br>
Step-1<br>
A solution of trichloromethyl chloroformate (3.43g, 17.50 mmol) in THF<br>
(15ml) is added slowly at 0°C to a stirred solution of tert-butyl-cyclohexyl carbazate<br>
(2.5g, 11.68 mmol) in THF (15ml) under N2 atmosphere. Triethylamine (1.77g, 17.52<br>
mmol) in THF (15ml) is next added at 0°C slowly over a period of 20 minutes. Stirred<br>
at 0°C for 1.5 hrs, THF distilled off, diluted with DCM (30ml), washed sequentially<br>
with water and 5% aqueous citric acid solution. Organic layer dried (Na2SO4) and<br>
removed in vacuo to give the product. (Yield 3.1 Og, 96.27%).<br>
Step-2<br>
To a solution of thiazolidine amide (0.66g, 5.0 mmol) and the product<br>
obtained in step-1 (1.96g, 7.10 mmol) in THF (30ml) is added a solution of<br>
triethylamine (1.6g, 15.84 mmol) in THF (10ml) dropwise at 5°C over a period of half<br>
an hr. Stirred at room temp, for 15 hrs, followed by refluxing for 1 hr. THF distilled<br>
off, diluted with ethyl acetate, washed successively with water and 5% aqueous citric<br>
acid, organic layer dried (Na2SO4), evaporated in vacuo and crude material purified<br>
by column chromatography (50% ethyl acetate/hexane). (Yield 0.85g, 45.70%).<br>
Step-3<br>
Trifluoroacetic anhydride (0.54g, 2.57 mmol) is added to a solution of the<br>
amide compound (0.80g, 2.15 mmol) as obtained in step-2, in THF (15ml) at 5°C and<br>
stirred at 30°C for 3 hrs. Excess solvents removed in vacuo, diluted with ethyl acetate,<br>
washed with aqueous 5% NaHCO3 solution, dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated. Crude<br>
material purified by column chromatography (20% ethyl acetate/ hexane). (Yield<br>
0.43g, 56.48%).<br>
Step-4<br>
The deprotection is done by stirring a solution of the cyano compound (0.43g,<br>
1.21 mmol) with TFA (5ml) in THF (5ml) at 5°C for 1 hr. Excess solvents distilled<br>
off in vacuo, diluted with ethyl acetate, washed with saturated aqueous solution of<br>
NaHCO3. Organic layer dried (Na2SO4), evaporated and the required pure compound<br>
is isolated as a free base after column chromatography (35% ethyl acetate/ hexane).<br>
(Yield 0.1 Og, 32.46%).<br>
This is converted to its hydrochloride salt by treating with methanolic HCl at<br>
10°C for 1 hr. and removing excess solvents in vacuo followed by crystallization from<br>
ether.<br>

Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions may be prepared with a pharmaceuticaHy<br>
effective quantity of compounds of general formula I, individually or in combination.<br>
It is common practice to administer the compounds in the form of pharmaceutical<br>
dosage forms comprising pharmaceuticaHy acceptable excipient(s) and at least one<br>
active ingredient. These dosage forms may be administered by a variety of routes<br>
including oral, topical, transdermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous,<br>
intranasal, pulmonary etc.<br>
The following pharmaceutical formulations suggested are by way of example<br>
alone and in no way restrict the forms in which they can be used.<br>
Oral formulations<br>
Oral formulations may be administered as solid dosage forms for example<br>
pellets, powders, sachets or discreet units such as tablets or capsules and like. Other<br>
orally administered pharmaceutical preparations include monophasic and biphasic<br>
liquid dosage forms either in ready to use form or forms suitable for reconstitution such<br>
as mixtures, syrups, suspensions or emulsions. The preparations in addition may<br>
contain diluents, dispersing agents, buffers, stabilizers, solubilizers, surfactants,<br>
preservatives, chelating agents and/ or other pharmaceutical additives as are used.<br>
Aqueous or non-aqueous vehicle or their combination may be used and if desired may<br>
contain suitable sweetener, flavoring agent or similar substances. In case of suspension<br>
or emulsion a suitable thickening agent or suspending agent or emulsifying agent may<br>
be present in addition. Alternatively, the compounds may be administered as such in<br>
their pure form unassociated with other additives for example as capsules or sachets. It<br>
may also be administered with a vehicle. Pharmaceutical preparations can have a slow,<br>
delayed or controlled release of active ingredients as is provided by a matrix or<br>
diffusion controlled system.<br>
When the present invention or its salts or suitable complexes is presented as a<br>
discrete unit dosage form like tablet, it may contain in addition medically inert excipients<br>
