Work-up is carried out by customary methods (cf. the Preparation Examples).<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can be used as defoliants, desiccants, haulm killers and, especially, as weed killers. Weeds in the broadest sense are understood to mean all plants which grow in locations where they are undesired. Whether the substances according to the invention act as total or selective herbicides depends essentially on the amount used.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can be used, for example, in connection with the following plants:<br>
Dicotyledonous weeds of the genera: Abutilon, Amaranthus, Ambrosia, Anoda, Anthemis, Aphanes, Atriplex, Bellis, Bidens, Capsella, Carduus, Cassia, Centaurea, Chenopodium, Cirsium, Convolvulus, Datura, Desmodium, Emex, Erysimum, Euphorbia, Galeopsis, Galinsoga, Galium, Hibiscus, Ipomoea, Kochia, Lamium, Lepidium, Lindernia, Matricaria, Mentha, Mercurialis, Mullugo, Myosotis, Papaver, Pharbitis, Plantago, Polygonum, Portulaca, Ranunculus, Raphanus, Rorippa, Rotala, Rumex, Salsola, Senecio, Sesbania, Sida, Sinapis, Solanum, Sonchus, Sphenoclea, Stellaria, Taraxacum, Thlaspi, Trifolium, Urtica, Veronica, Viola, Xanthium.<br>

However, the use of the active compounds according to the invention is in no way restricted to these genera, but also extends in the same manner to other plants.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention are suitable, depending on the concentration, for the total control of weeds, for example on industrial terrain and rail tracks, and on paths and areas with and without tree plantings. Similarly, the active compounds according to the invention can be employed for controlling weeds in perennial crops, for example forests, decorative tree plantings, orchards, vineyards, citrus groves, nut orchards, banana plantations, coffee plantations, tea plantations, rubber plantations, oil palm plantations, cocoa plantations, soft fruit plantings and hop fields, on lawns, turf and pastureland, and for the selective control of weeds in annual crops.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention have strong herbicidal activity and a broad active spectrum when used on the soil and on above-ground parts of plants. To a certain extent they are also suitable for the selective control of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weeds in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous crops, both by the pre-emergence and by the post-emergence method.<br>
At certain concentrations or application rates, the active compounds according to the invention can also be employed for controlling animal pests and fungal or bacterial<br><br>
plant diseases. If appropriate, they can also be used as intermediates or precursors for the synthesis of other active compounds.<br>
All plants and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. Plants are to be understood as meaning in the present context all plants and plant populations such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional plant breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and recombinant methods or by combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and inclusive of the plant cultivars protectable or not protectable by plant breeders' rights. Plant parts are to be understood as meaning all parts and organs of plants above and below the ground, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits, seeds, roots, tubers and rhizomes. The plant parts also include harvested material, and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example cuttings, tubers, rhizomes, offsets and seeds.<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plants (weeds, harmful plants) and/or plant species and plant cultivars (crop plants) obtained by conventional biological breeding methods, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been explained above.<br>
Plant cultivars are to be understood as meaning crop plants having certain properties ("traits") which have been obtained by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. They can be cultivars, bio- or genotypes.<br>
The transgenic plants or plant cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering) which are treated according to the invention include all plants which, in the genetic<br><br>
modification, received genetic material which imparted particularly advantageous useful properties ("traits") to these plants. Examples of such properties are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such properties are a better defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (including rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, beets, cultivated grasses such as golfing greens and ornamental lawns, oilseed rape, fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), and plantation crops, such as oil and rubber trees, where particular emphasis is given to cereals including rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, beets and oilseed rape. Traits that are emphasized are in particular increased defence of the plants against insects by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed in the plants by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a), CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryllA, CrylllA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF and also combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits that are also particularly emphasized are the increased defence of the plants to fungi, bacteria and viruses by systemic acquired resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexins, elicitors and resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins. Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds and classes of active compounds, such as glyphosate or glufosinate/phosphinotricin (for example the "PAT" gene), ALS inhibitors, such as imidazolinones, sulphonylureas and others, PPO inhibitors (for example plants having Acuron genes), 4-HPD inhibitors, such as isozazoles (for example isoxaflutole), ACCase inhibitors, such as sethoxydim, and also bromoxynil.<br><br>
The genes which impart the desired traits in question can also be present in combinations with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize cultivars, cotton cultivars, soya bean cultivars and potato cultivars which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for example maize, cotton, soya beans), KnockOut® (for example maize), StarLink® (for example maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize cultivars, cotton cultivars, soya bean cultivars, cereal cultivars including rice cultivars, beet cultivars and oilseed rape cultivars which are sold under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soya bean, beets, oilseed rape), Liberty Link® (tolerance to glufosinate, for example oilseed rape, maize, beets), IMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulphonylureas, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned include the cultivars sold under the name Clearfield® (for example maize, rice).<br>
Of course, these statements also apply to plant cultivars having these genetic traits or genetic traits still to be developed, which plants will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the substances and compositions to be used according to the invention - also in combination with other agrochemical active compounds -, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br><br>
The plants listed can be treated according to the invention in a particularly advantageous manner with the compounds of the general formula (I) or the active compound mixtures according to the invention where in addition to the good control of weed plants, the abovementioned synergistic effects with the transgenic plants or plant cultivars occur. The preferred ranges stated above for the active compounds or mixtures also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the compounds or mixtures specifically mentioned in the present text.<br>
The treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the active compounds is carried out directly or by allowing the compounds to act on their surroundings, environment or storage space by the customary treatment methods, for example by immersion, spraying, evaporation, fogging, scattering, painting on and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, also by applying one or more coats.<br>
The active compounds can be converted into the customary formulations such as solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble powders, granules, suspension-emulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials impregnated with active compound, and microencapsulations in polymeric materials.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is, liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is, emulsifiers and/or dispersants, and/or foam formers.<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible, for example, to use organic solvents as cosolvents. The following are essentially suitable as liquid solvents: aromatics such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example<br><br>
mineral oil fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, or else water.<br>
Suitable solid carriers are: for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals such as highly-disperse silica, alumina and silicates; suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, or else synthetic granules of inorganic and organic minerals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifiers and/or foam formers are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates, or else protein hydrolysates; suitable dispersants are: for example lignin-sulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, or else natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins and synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations. Other additives can be mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic colorants such alizarin colorants, azo colorants and metal phthalocyanine colorants, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations generally comprise between 0.1 and 95 per cent by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br><br>

The preparation and the use of the active compounds according to the invention is illustrated by the examples below.<br><br>
Preparation Examples: Example 1<br><br>
(Process(a))<br>
0.28 g (3.6 mmol) of acetyl chloride is added to a suspension of 1.0 g (2.9 mmol) of [3-(2-aminoethoxy)-2,4-dichloro-phenyl]-(l-ethyl-5-hydroxy-lH-pyrazol-4-yl)-methanone and 0.8 g (5.8 mmol) of potassium carbonate in 6 ml of acetonitrile, and the reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature (about 20°C) for 24 hours. The solvent is then removed under reduced pressure and the residue is dissolved in a little water. The aqueous solution is washed with dichloromethane and then acidified with cone, hydrochloric acid and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase is washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried over sodium sulphate and filtered. From the filtrate, the solvent is carefully distilled off under reduced pressure.<br>
This gives 0.8 g (71.5 % of theory) of N-(2-{2,6-dichloro-3-[(l-ethyl-5-hydroxy-lH-pyrazol-4-yl)-carbonyl]-phenoxy}-ethyl)-acetamide (Example 1-2-1) as an orange-yellow glass-like solid.<br>
log P= 1.41.<br><br>
Example 2<br><br>
(Process (a))<br>
0.24 g (3.3 mmol) of methyl isothiocyanate is added to a suspension of 0.5 g (1.45 mmol) of [3-(2-amino-ethoxy)-2,4-dichloro-phenyl]-(l-ethyl-5-hydroxy-lH-pyrazol-4-yl)-methanone in 10 ml of methanol, and the reaction mixture is heated at the boil under reflux for 24 hours. Water and ethyl acetate are added and the organic phase is then separated off, washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried over sodium sulphate and filtered. From the filtrate, the solvent is carefully distilled off under reduced pressure.<br>
This gives 0.55 g (91 % of theory) of N-(2-{2,6-dichloro-3-[(l-ethyl-5-hydroxy-lH-pyrazol-4-yl)-carbonyl]-phenoxy}-ethyl)-N'-methyl-thiourea (Example 1-2-2) as an orange-yellow viscous oil.<br>
log P= 1.60.<br><br>
xample 3<br><br>
(Process (b))<br>
0.7 g (6.25 mmol) of 1,3-cyclohexanedione and 2.0 g (6.25 mmol) of N-(3-carboxyl-2,6-dichloro-benzyl)-N'-isopropyl-thiourea are initially charged to 50 ml of acetonitrile. 1.5 g (7.25 mmol) of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide are added and the mixture is stirred at room temperature (about 20°C) for 15 hours. 0.7 g (7 mmol) of triethylamine and 0.7 g (8 mmol) of 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-propionitrile is then added, and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for another 15 hours. The mixture is then stirred with 50 ml of aqueous 1M potassium carbonate solution and filtered off with suction, and the filtrate is acidified to pH 4 using hydrochloric acid. The mixture is extracted three times with in each case 30 ml of dichloromethane and the combined organic phases are dried with magnesium sulphate and filtered. The solvent is then removed under reduced pressure.<br>
This gives 1.1 g (30% of theory) of N-(3-(cyclohex-l-en-2-ol-6-on-l-ylcarbonyl)-2,4-dichlorobenzyl)-N'-isopropyl-thiourea (Example 1-2-3) as an oily residue.<br>

0.25 g (1.0 mmol) of l-bromo-4-(bromomethyl)-benzene and 0.15 g of 1,8-diazabicyclo-(5.4.0)-undec-7-en (DBU) are added to a solution of 0.193 g (0.5 mmol) of N-(2-{2,6-dichloro-3-[(l-ethyl-5-hydroxy-1 H-pyrazol-4-yl)-carbonyl]-phenoxy}-ethyl)-acetamide in 6 ml of toluene, and the reaction mixture is heated at the boil under reflux for 9 hours. The supernatant toluene phase is decanted off and the oily residue that remains is separated by column chromatography using the mobile phase dichloromethane/methanol (9:1).<br>
This gives 0.12 g (43 % of theory) of N-{2-[3-({5-[(4-bromo-benzyI)-oxy]-l-ethyl-1 H-pyrazol-4-yl}-carbonyl)-2,6-dichloro-phenoxy]-ethyl}-acetamide (Example 1-2-4) as a yellow viscous oil.<br>

Analogously to Examples 1 to 4 and in accordance with the general description of the preparation processes according to the invention, it is also possible to prepare, for example, the compounds of the general formula (I) - or of the formulae (1-1) to (1-3) or the formulae (I-2a) to (I-2d) - listed in Table 1 below.<br><br><br>
Table 1; Examples of compounds of the formula (1-2)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Example (II-1)<br><br>
Stepl<br><br>
11.7 g (85.1 mmol) of potassium carbonate and, after 15 min, 11.0 g (46.9 mmol) of 2-chloro-ethanol tosylate are added to a solution of 10.0 g (42.5 mmol) of ethyl 2,4-dichloro-3-hydroxy-benzoate in 100 ml of acetonitrile. The reaction mixture is stirred at 70°C for 19 hours and, after cooling, concentrated under reduced pressure, and 50 ml of water and 50 ml of dichloromethane are added to the residue. The organic phase is separated off, washed with water and saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried over sodium sulphate and filtered. From the filtrate, the solvent is carefully distilled off under reduced pressure.<br>
This gives 12.1 g (95% of theory) of ethyl 2,4-dichloro-3-(2-chloro-ethoxy)-benzoate as an oil.<br>
log P = 3.76<br><br>
Step 2<br><br>
A solution of 2.2 g (55.0 mmol) of sodium hydroxide in 40 ml of water is added to a solution of 10.0 g (33.6 mmol) of ethyl 2,4-dichloro-3-(2-chloro-ethoxy)-benzoate in 70 ml of ethanol. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature (about 20°C) for 90 minutes, and most of the ethanol is removed by evaporation under reduced pressure. The residue is adjusted to pH 1 using cone, hydrochloric acid and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase is separated off, washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried over sodium sulphate and filtered. From the filtrate, the solvent is carefully distilled off under reduced pressure.<br>
This gives 9.0 g (99 % of theory) of 2,4-dichloro-3-(2-chloro-ethoxy)-benzoic acid as a white solid.<br>
log P = 2.31<br>
Step 3 <br>
A solution of 8.5 g (31.5 mmol) of 2,4-dichloro-3-(2-chloro-ethoxy)-benzoic acid in 12 ml of thionyl chloride is heated at 60°C for 1 hour. After the evolution of gas has ceased, the excess thionyl chloride is removed under reduced pressure.<br><br>
This gives 9.0 g (99% of theory) of 2,4-dichloro-3-(2-chloro-ethoxy)-benzoyl chloride as an oily residue.<br>
Step 4<br><br>
9.5 g of (94 mmol) of triethylamine, 9 g (31.3 mmol) of 2,4-dichloro-3-(2-chloro-ethoxy)-benzoyl chloride and 5 drops of N,N-dimethylformamide are added successively to a solution of 3.5 g (31.3 mmol) of l-ethyl-5-hydroxy-lH-pyrazole in 200 ml of dichloromethane. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature (about 20°C), for 21 hours and then washed with 2N hydrochloric acid and saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried over sodium sulphate and filtered. From the filtrate, the solvent is removed under reduced pressure.<br>
The oily residue is dissolved in 200 ml of acetonitrile, 17 g (168 mmol) of triethylamine and 3.26 g (38 mmol) of 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-propionitrile are added and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for another 20 hours. Most of the solvent is then removed under reduced pressure and the oily residue is taken up in 100 ml of dichloromethane. The organic phase is washed with 2N hydrochloric acid and with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried over sodium sulphate and filtered. The filtrate is freed from the solvent under reduced pressure.<br>
This gives 11.1 g (98% of theory) of [2,4-dichloro-3-(2-chloro-ethoxy)-phenyl]-(l-ethyl-5-hydroxy-lH-pyrazol-4~yl)-rnethanone as an orange-yellow crystalline solid.<br>
log P = 2.73.<br><br>
Step 5<br><br>
A solution of 8.0 g (22 mmoJ) of [2,4-dichloro-3-(2-chloro-ethoxy)-pheny]J-(l-ethy]-5-hydroxy-lH-pyrazol-4-yl)-methanone in 150 ml of tetrahydrofuran and 200 ml of ammonia is heated in an autoclave at 90°C for 6.5 hours. Most of the excess ammonia is evaporated off and the product that settles out is removed by filtration and dried under reduced pressure.<br>
This gives 4.3 g (57% of theory) of [3-(2-amino-ethoxy)-2,4-dichloro-phenyl]-(l-ethyl-5-hydroxy-lH-pyrazol-4-yl)-methanone as a light-yellow crystalline solid.<br>
log P = 0.72.<br>
Analogously to Example (II-1), it was also possible to prepare, for example, the compounds of the general formula (II) listed in Table 3 below.<br><br><br>
Table 3: Examples of compounds of the formula (II)<br><br><br>
Starting materials of the formula (IV): Example (IV-1)<br><br>
Stepl<br><br>
At room temperature (about 20°C) 15 g (59 mmol) of methyl 2,4-dichloro«3-bromomethyl-benzoate and then 7.5 g (77 mmol) of potassium thiocyanate are introduced into 60 ml of acetonitrile. The reaction mixture is slowly heated to reflux and then stirred at this temperature under reflux for 20 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the solvent is stripped off under reduced pressure and the residue is stirred with 70 ml of diethyl ether. Undissolved components are filtered off with suction, the solvent is removed under reduced pressure and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure.<br>
This gives 2.7 g (17 % of theory) of methyl 2,4-dichloro-3-isocyanatomethyl-benzoate as an oil which is reacted further without further purification.<br>
Step 2 <br><br>
5.6 g of crude methyl 2,4-dichloro-3-isocyanatomethyl-benzoate are dissolved in 20 ml of ethanol, and 1.2 g (20 mmol) of 2-propanamine are added. The mixture is heated at the boil for 1 hour, the amount of solvent is reduced to one third of the original volume and the product is filtered off with suction.<br>
This gives 1.7 g (9%, based on methyl 2,4-dichloro-3-methyl-benzoate) of methyl 2,4-dichloro-3-[[[(isopropylamino)-thioxomethyl]-amino]-methyl]-benzoate as a solid (MS: M+ = 355,2 CI according to the isotope pattern).<br>
Step 3<br><br>
5 g (15 mmol) of N-(3-methoxycarbonyl-2,6-dichloro-benzyl)-N'-isopropyl-thiourea are dissolved in 30 ml of methanol, and 10 ml (50 mmol) of a 30% strength solution of sodium methoxide in methanol are added. Over a period of 30 minutes, 50 ml of water are added dropwise, and the mixture is then kept at 60°C for 2 hours. Following neutralization with 2N hydrochloric acid, the product is filtered off with suction and dried.<br>
This gives 4.4 g (91 % of theory) of 2,4-dichloro-3-[[[(isopropylamino)-thioxo-methyl]-amino]-methyl]-benzoic acid as a solid of melting point &gt;220°C.<br>
