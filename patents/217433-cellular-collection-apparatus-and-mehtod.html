CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the priority benefit of United States Utility<br>
Application No. 10/122,963, filed on April 11,2002, entitled Cellular Collection<br>
Apparatus and Method, which is related to United States Patent No. 6,402,700,<br>
issued on June 11, 2002, entitled Pap Smear Apparatus and Method.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.       FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to gynecological medical devices, and more<br>
particularly to a medical tool and method for enabling a woman to collect a<br>
cervical cell or other biological material sample for use during a screening test for<br>
cancer and infections of the cervix.<br>
2.       DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART INCLUDING INFORMATION<br>
DISCLOSED UNDER 37 CFR 1.97 AND 37 CFR 1.98<br>
The Papanicalou (PAP) test, commonly known as a PAP smear, is an<br>
important routine gynecological test usually done annually in sexually active<br>
females to screen for cervical cancer. The tests known in the art typically require<br>
an in office visit with a gynecologist where the doctor takes a cellular sample of<br>
the cervix for lab analysis. Current medical practice requires a gynecologist to<br>
insert a speculum into the patient"s vagina to access the cervix for tissue sample<br>
collection. Many women find this method an uncomfortable, intrusive exam, and<br>
opt to not have the routine screening performed.<br>
While certain groups of women are recognized to be at a higher risk for<br>
cervical cancer and exposure to a variety of Human Papilloma Virus subtypes,<br>
many monogamous women do not fall into the high risk categories. For these<br>
women, the screening guidelines recommend testing every three years after three<br>
normal annual PAP smears. Cervical Cancer: Backgrounder, National Cancer<br>
Institute, February 22,1999,<br>
(http://rexx.nci...nih.gov/massmedia/backgrounders/). For many women, the<br>
routine screening test would be regularly performed if it could be done in a non-<br>
intrusive, private manner. Screening for Cervical Cancer, in Common Screening<br>
Tests, David M. Eddy, MD, PhD, Editor, Chapter 10, pages 255-283 (1991).<br>
Of particular relevance to the instant invention is U.S. Patent No. 5,121,752<br>
to Canna. Canna "752 discloses a self-obtaining PAP smear apparatus which must<br>
be used by a woman standing in an upright position. The apparatus includes a<br>
rigid, cylindrical speculum, angled endocervical sampler and an elongated angled<br>
spatula. The cylindrical speculum includes an angled front orifice designed to fit<br>
about the cervix. After insertion, a mirror is used for visual observation to affirm<br>
correct placement of the orifice around the cervix. In actual practice, however,<br>
obtaining a clear view by speculum of the cervix is difficult even under direct<br>
vision. In addition, the length and rigidity of the speculum prevent the use of<br>
digital assistance to confirm proper placement.<br>
Although the aforementioned reference discloses one method and apparatus<br>
for self-obtaining PAP smears, it fails to teach or disclose an. efficient, easy to use<br>
method and apparatus that enables digital location of the cervix for accurate<br>
placement of the speculum and reliable sampling of the cervical tissue. The<br>
present invention meets these needs. The invention provides an efficient tool for<br>
privately performing a non-intrusive PAP smear or tissue sample collection<br>
without the need for assistance by a gynecologist or other medical practitioner.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is a cellular collection apparatus and method of use<br>
for enabling a user to obtain a personal PAP smear or similar tissue sample.   The<br>
apparatus of the invention includes a cervical guide ring, an insertion handle, a<br>
means for movably attaching the guide ring to the insertion handle, and a means<br>
for guiding a tissue sampling tool to the woman"s cervix.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the means for movably attaching the guide ring<br>
to the insertion handle is a hinge mechanism. In one aspect, the hinge mechanism<br>
includes a tab on the guide ring that engages with a catch tab proximal to the first<br>
end of the insertion handle when the tool is in use.<br>
In another embodiment, the means for movable attaching the guide ring to<br>
the insertion handle is a ratchet mechanism. In one aspect, the ratchet mechanism<br>
includes a pawl and spur. In yet another aspect, the pawl is on the guide ring and<br>
the spur is on the insertion handle. In still another aspect, the rachet mechanism<br>
includes at least one tooth on the guide ring and a catch proximal to the first end<br>
of the insertion handle.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the apparatus includes a<br>
means for guiding a tissue sampling tool to the woman"s cervix. In one aspect of<br>
the invention, the sampling tool guidance means includes a longitudinal groove in<br>
the length of the insertion handle which mates with a slidable extension such as a<br>
dove-tail or T-slide. In one aspect, the slide is on the sampling tool. In another<br>
aspect, the slide is on the housing for the sampling tool. In yet another aspect, the<br>
slidable extension of the sampling tool is placed within the longitudinal groove of<br>
the handle to secure the path of the sampling tool directly to the cervix.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the insertion handle includes a<br>
longitudinal bore open at the first and second ends. The first end is proximal to<br>
the ring and cervix, while the second end is distal. During use, one or more<br>
sampling tools are directed to the cervix through the bore of the insertion handle.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a method for enabling a user<br>
to obtain a biological material cell sample or PAP smear without the aid of a<br>
gynecologist or other medical professional. The method includes the steps of<br>
inserting a cervical guide tool into the user"s vagina, positioning a guide ring<br>
around the user"s cervix, guiding a sampling tool through the introitus of the<br>
user"s vagina to the cervix." and wiping the endocervical canal and surrounding<br>
. surface areas with one or more sampling tools. Once the sampling is completed,<br>
the tools are removed from the user"s vagina, and the samples are sealed in a<br>
fixative for later analysis.<br>
The step of positioning the guide ring around the user"s cervix includes digital<br>
palpation of the cervix to properly place the ring, thereby capturing the cervix in<br>
the ring"s center. In another aspect of the invention, the step of guiding the<br>
sampling tool to the cervix includes the step of slidably mating an extension on<br>
the sampling tool to a groove in the handle of the cervical guide tool. In another<br>
aspect, the guidance step includes the step of directing one or more sampling<br>
tools to the cervix through a longitudinal bore in the insertion handle of the<br>
cervical guide tool.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is a personal cellular collection apparatus and method<br>
for collecting a non-intrusive cell or tissue sample for medical testing such as a<br>
PAP smear or cervical cancer screening. Referring to FIGS. 1-4 of the drawings,<br>
the apparatus of the invention 10 includes a cervical guide ring 12, an insertion<br>
handle 20, a means for movably attaching ring 12 to handle 20, and a means for<br>
guiding a tissue sampling tool to the woman"s cervix.<br>
Cervical guide ring 12 includes an upper section 14, a lower section 16, a<br>
central aperture 15, and an optional recess 18.   Insertion handle 20 includes a<br>
proximal first end 22, a distal second end 28, and an optional longitudinal groove<br>
26 having open end 28 and closed end 29.<br>
In a preferred embodiment as shown in FIGS. 1-4, the means for movably<br>
attaching ring 12 to handle 20 is hinge or ratchet mechanism 30 including tab 32<br>
proximal to lower ring section 16 and catch tab 34 at end 22 of insertion handle<br>
20. When the collection apparatus is in the folded, insertion position, parts 32, 34<br>
of hinge mechanism 30 are not engaged as shown in FIG. 2. In the design<br>
depicted in FIGS. 1-4 of the drawings, recess 18 permits ring 12 to lay flush<br>
against end 22 of handle 20 when the apparatus is folded for insertion.<br>
It will be understood and appreciated by one skilled in the art that there are<br>
other ratchet and hinge means known in the art which may be suitable for use with<br>
the present invention. Specifically, other mechanisms known in the art may be<br>
modified or adapted to permit moveable mounting of the guide ring 12 to the<br>
insertion handle 20 to allow the user to change the guide ring 12 between folded,<br>
vertical and horizontal positions. It will also be apparent to those skilled in the art<br>
that these various designs of hinge or ratchet means known in the ail and readily<br>
adaptable for use in the present invention would not always require the inclusion<br>
of a recess 18 to fold ring 12 against end 22 of handle 20.<br>
When ring 12 is raised during use to the vertical sampling position, the one-<br>
way ratchet 30 shown in FIGS. 1-7 clicks into position and prevents ring 12 from<br>
returning to the folded position against handle 20 during use. Specifically, as<br>
shown in FIG. 3, catch tab 34 engages tab 32 to secure ring 12 in the vertical<br>
position during use. During sampling, the user may continue to hold end 24 of<br>
handle 20 to secure ring 12 in position at the cervix if needed. After the tissue<br>
sampling is completed, the user may pull out handle 20 of apparatus 10 to<br>
disengage tabs 32,34 of mechanism 30, causing guide ring 12 to move to a<br>
substantially horizontal position as shown in FIG. 4.<br>
It will be understood and appreciated by those skilled in the art that all or<br>
part of collection apparatus 10 may be constructed of a reusable, pliable material.<br>
When handle 20 is constructed of a pliable material, ring 12 may be returned to<br>
the folded, insertion position after use by flexing tab 34 down away from tab 32.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 1, and 6-8, one means for guiding a tissue sampling<br>
tool to the user"s cervix is shown and includes sampling tool assembly 40 and<br>
longitudinal groove 26 on handle 20. Sampling tool assembly 40 includes tool<br>
housing 44 having a collection tool casing 41, extension 42, and a longitudinal<br>
bore 46.   It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that any number of<br>
conventional tab extensions 42 may be used, such as dove-tailed or T-slide<br>
designs, as long as extension 42 movably mates within longitudinal groove 26 of<br>
handle 20.<br>
A collection brush 50 is shown retracted in FIGS. 5 and 6 with handle 52<br>
protruding through bore 46 of housing 44. When retracted within housing 41,<br>
housing 41 serves the additional function of protecting the sampling tool 50 from<br>
contamination with non-cervical cells during use.<br>
In this preferred embodiment, longitudinal groove 26 has an open access<br>
end 28 at distal end 24 and a closed stop 29 proximal to handle end 22. During<br>
use of the present invention, extension 42 of housing 41 is slidably mated with<br>
longitudinal groove 26 of handle 20. Specifically, after insertion of the collection<br>
apparatus in the user"s vaginal, extension 42 of sampling tool assembly 40 is<br>
inserted into groove 26 at open end 28 and slidably moved forward along groove<br>
26 until part 42 meets stop 29. In this position, housing 41 rests proximal to the<br>
user"s cervix 62. As shown in FIG. 7, when brush handle 52 is moved forward,<br>
collection bristles 54 advance out of protective housing 41, into direct contact<br>
with cervix 62.<br>
The use and operation of the present invention will be best understood in<br>
conjunction with the method of the invention. In the method, the user may chose<br>
any comfortable position for personally digitally locating their cervix and<br>
handling the apparatus of the invention and sampling tools.   Successful positions<br>
include standing with both feet on the floor, standing with one foot resting on a<br>
raised surface, reclining, or laying on a bed.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 9-12, the user inserts the cervical guide tool 10 with<br>
guide ring 12 in the folded position, through the introitus 60 of the user"s vagina<br>
until hinge mechanism 30 rests below the user"s cervix 62. Proper positioning is<br>
confirmed by digital 64 location of the cervix 62 by the user. Next, the user raises<br>
ring 12 to a substantially vertical position until it encircles and captures the user"s<br>
cervix 62. The user may check that ring 12 is properly engaged into position by<br>
pressing on ring 12 near upper section 14 as shown in FIG. 10.<br>
Referring back to FIGS. 5-7 in conjunction with FIG. 11, a sampling tool<br>
such as brush 50 is guided through the introitus 60 to cervix 62.   Specifically,<br>
brush 50 is initially retracted in housing 41 of tool assembly 40. Slide mechanism<br>
42 is engaged with longitudinal groove 26 at opening 28 and moved forwarded to<br>
stop 29. The user next advances collection bristles 54 out of brush housing 41 to<br>
the cervix 62 where rotating the bristles 54 gently against the cervix 62 assures<br>
collection of an adequate sample.<br>
The user next retracts the brush 50 into protective housing 41, removes the<br>
sampling tool assembly 40 from the vagina and repeats the process with<br>
additional sampling tools (not shown) as needed. Additional or alternative<br>
sampling tools known in the art for collection of tissue samples in the<br>
endocervical canal and surrounding surface area may be used as part of<br>
sampling tool assembly 40. Upon completion of the sampling process, the cervical<br>
guide apparatus 10 is next withdrawn. As shown in FIG. 12, the user pulls on<br>
handle 20 of apparatus 10 causing guide ring 12 to move to a substantially<br>
horizontal position for easy removal of the apparatus 10 from the user"s vagina.<br>
The tissue samples may be handled in any number of conventional ways known<br>
in the art. For example, the brush 50 of the sampling tool assembly 40 may be<br>
sealed in a fixative and sent to a lab, gynecologist or pathologist for<br>
interpretation of the samples.<br>
In FIGS. 13-14, another embodiment of the collection apparatus 100 is shown<br>
having an alternative means for guiding a tissue sampling tool to the user"s<br>
cervix. Cervical guide apparatus 100 is shown folded within vaginal canal 160,<br>
proximal to cervix 162. In this embodiment, guide ring 112 includes upper<br>
section 114, lower section 116, hinge mechanism 130, and hollow handle 120.<br>
Handle 120 further includes protective tool housing 125, and slanted extension<br>
121 proximal to handle end 122. In FIG. 14, ring 112 is shown in the vertical<br>
sampling position, and sampling tool brush 150 having handle 152, is shown<br>
extended from the housing 125 through handle aperture 126, with bristles 154<br>
adjacent to cervix 162 for tissue collection. Extension 121, when sufficiently<br>
angled between housing 125 and hinge mechanism 130, properly align and guide<br>
the collection bristles 154 to the endocervical canal and walls of cervix 162. In<br>
this embodiment, housing 125 serves the additional function of protecting the<br>
bristles 154 of sampling tool 150 from contamination during vaginal insertion<br>
and removal of collection apparatus 100.<br>
With reference to FIG. 15, another feature of the present invention is shown on<br>
collection apparatus 200. Cervical guide tool 200 includes handle 220, guide<br>
ring 212, hinge means 230, and longitudinal groove 226 between ends 222, and<br>
224 having open end 228 and stop 229.   Proximal to end 228 are dove-tailed<br>
handles 240,242 which facilitate the ability of left and right handed users to<br>
securely hold ring 212 in position against the cervix during sampling.<br>
It will be understood and appreciated by those skilled in the art that the .<br>

A personal cellular collection apparatus and method for collecting a non-intrusive cell or<br>
tissue sample for medical testing such as cervical cancer screening if provided. In the<br>
technical field of medical devices, the apparatus (10) includes a cervical guide ring (12),<br>
an insertion handle (20), a means for movably attaching the guide ring, and a means for<br>
directing a tissue sampling tool to a woman"s cervix (62). The means for movably<br>
attaching the guide ring (12) to the insertion handle (20) is a hinge or rachet mechanism<br>
(30) having a tab or latch (32) on the lower ring section (16) and a catch (34) on the<br>
proximal end (22) of the insertion handle (20). The method of the invention includes<br>
insertion of the collection tool assembly (40) through the introitus of the user"s vagina,<br>
digital positioning of the guide ring (12) to encircle the user"s cervix (62), guiding a<br>
sampling tool (44) to the cervix, wiping the cervix with the collection surface (54) of the<br>
sampling tool (44) to collect a tissue sample and removing the sampling tool (44) and<br>
cervical guide (10) from the user"s vagina.</td>
