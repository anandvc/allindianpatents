				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of clarified shelf stable sapota juice.<br>
Sapota {Achras Sapota L) is a tropical fruit widely grown in India and is available almost throughout the year. Sapota fruit is highly delicious and is widely used for table purpose. Sapota juice prepared from this process is highly acceptable with the natural sapota flavour. Sapota juice from this process can be used for the preparation of various processed products such as sapota ready to serve carbonated and non carbonated beverages, sapota juice concentrates, sapota cordial, sapota jam, sapota jelly etc. The bottled sapota juice prepared by this process is shelf stable at ambient temperature.<br>
Reference may be made to Mahadevireddy. 1959. Physico-chemical investigation on sapota and its products. A thesis submitted for the award of associateship, CFTRI, Mysore, where in sapota squash was prepared by blending sapota pulp (5Kg), sugar (5 Kg), water (5 Kg) and citric acid (200g). The ingredients are mixed thoroughly to a uniform syrupy mass and 600 PPM potassium metabisulfite or 750 PPM sodium benzoate was used for the preservation of squash. Sapota jam was prepared from the pulp obtained by mixing sapota pulp (2Kg), water (250grams), sugar (1.5 Kg) and citric acid (60 grams) and kept for half an hour. The mixture is then cooked to the desired consistency. The main draw backs of this process are the sapota squash had gritty sensation due to the presence of stone cells, and also jam and squash developed acidity during storage due to the release of tannins from bound form.<br>
Reference may be made to Rivas.N.R. and Martos, C-de 1982. Preservation of the pulp of sapota fruit (Achras Sapota L) by canning and freezing. Proceedings-Tropical region, American society for Horticulture Science, 22, 62-81, wherein sapota fruit pulp was preserved by canning and freezing. The sapota pulp has pH 5.35, acidity 0.26%, TSS 20.2%, reducing sugars 11.08 %, total sugars 13.8 % and tannins 29.61 mg / 100g. Sapota puree was canned after acidifying to pH 4.0 - 4.2 and heating to 98°C. The main drawbacks of this process are the quality of the pulp reduced significantly by the canning process, ihe canned pulp became darker and color was adversely affected, and the process does not involve preparation of sapota juice.<br>
Reference may be made to Thapa, M.J. 1980. Some studies on the osmotic dehydration of sapota, An Investigation submitted for M.Sc. Food Technology submitted to the University of Mysore, wherein sapota fruit pieces were immersed in sugar syrup till 50 % reduction in weight by osmosis. The osmotically treated fruit pieces were further dried in a hot air drier for 8 hours to a final moisture content of less than 15 %. The dried sapota segments had 60.5 % sugar, 0.2 % acidity and charactenstic sapota flavour. The drawback of this process is this product can not be used for the preparation of sapota juice.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of shelf stable sapota juice which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of highly acceptable ready to serve beverages.<br>
still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of shelf stable sapota juice.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the extraction of sapota pulp and sapota juice.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of clarified shelf stable sapota juice which comprises :<br>
a)	extracting sapota pulp from mature and ripe sapota fruits,<br>
b)	adding pectolytic enzyme such as herein described to the above said sapota pulp in the range of 300-500 PPM in sapota pulp,<br>
c)	incubating the above said mixture at a temperature in the range of 40-45°C for a period ranging from 1-4 hours,<br>
d)	pressing the enzyme treated puip by conventional method to get sapota juice,<br>
e)	coagulating the tannins in the above said sapota juice by adding optionally 1% gelatin solution at the rate of 0.4-0.8 ml per 100 grams juice or honey at the rate of 0.25 grams to 1 gram per 100 grams juice, followed by incubation at a temperature in the range of 25-45°C for a period ranging from 30 minutes to 2 hours and,<br>
f)	pasteurizing the above said juice mixture at a temperature of 80 C, followed by filtration by conventional method to obtain the desired clarified sapota juice.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the pectolytic enzyme used may be selected from pectinase and cellulase.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the sapota juice obtained may have a shelf stable for a period of atleast 6 months at a temperature in the range of 20-25°C<br>
The novelty and innovative steps of the process developed in this invention involves the preparation of highly acceptable shelf stable clarified sapota juice by treating the sapota pulp with pectinase enzyme followed by the treatment with honey or gelatin for the removal of excess tannins , pasteurization of the so obtained juice and filtration to obtain clarified shelf stable sapota juice.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example -1<br>
Mature, ripe sapotas (10 Kg) were washed, peeled and passed through pulper fitted with 1/32 inch sieve. The sapota pulp thus obtained (6.4 Kg) was added with 3.2 ml of pectinase enzyme Rohapect D5 L dissolved in 100 ml water. The sapota pulp was mixed thoroughly and incubated at 40 °C in a water bath for 2 hours. The enzyme treated sapota pulp was pressed to get sapota juice (4.416 Kg). The sapota juice was added with 44.16 ml of 50 % honey solution and incubated at 40 °C for 2 hours. The incubated sapota juice was pasteurized at 80 0C and filtered through a filter press to obtain clarified sapota juice (4.3 Kg).<br>
Example - 2<br>
Mature, ripe sapotas (10 Kg) were washed, peeled and passed through pulper fitted with 1/32 inch sieve. The sapota pulp thus obtained (6.35 Kg) was added with 3.1 ml of pectinase enzyme Rohapect D5 L dissolved in 100 ml water. The sapota pulp was mixed thoroughly and incubated at 40 °C in a water bath for 2 hours. The enzyme treated sapota pulp was pressed to get sapota juice (4.39 Kg). The sapota juice was added with 26.4 ml of 1 % gelatin solution and incubated at 40 °C for 2 hours. The incubated sapota juice was pasteurized at 80 °C and filtered through a filter press to obtain clarified sapota juice (4.38 Kg).<br>
Example - 3<br>
Mature, ripe sapotas (10 Kg) were washed, peeled and passed through pulper fitted with 1/32 inch sieve. The sapota pulp thus obtained (6.3 Kg) was added with 3.15 ml of pectinase enzyme Rohapect D5 L dissolved in 100 ml water. The sapota pulp was mixed thoroughly and incubated at 40 °C in a water bath for 2 hours. The enzyme treated sapota pulp was pressed to get sapota juice (4.221 Kg). The sapota juice was added with 22 ml of 1 % gelatin solution and incubated at 40 °C for 2 hours. The incubated sapota juice was pasteurized at 80 °C and filtered through a filter press to obtain clarified sapota juice (4.15 Kg).<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are :<br>
1.  Sapota juice prepared from this process is free from astringency, and has natural colour and flavor.<br>
2.	Saptoa juice obtained by this process is stable at ambient temperature for a period of not less than 6 months.<br>
3.	Sapota juice can be used for the preparation of sapota juice concentrate, sapota jelly, sapota syrup, sapota cordial and other value added products.<br>
4.	Sapota juice can also be formulated in to a highly acceptable carbonated beverage.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We claim :<br>
1.      A process for the preparation of clarified shelf stable sapota juice which comprises<br>
a)	extracting sapota pulp from mature and ripe sapota fruits,<br>
b)	adding pectolytic enzyme such as herein described to the above said sapota pulp in the range of 300-500 PPM in sapota pulp,<br>
c)	incubating the above said mixture at a temperature in the range of 40-450C for a period ranging from 1-4 hours,<br>
d)	pressing the enzyme treated pulp by conventional method to ge! sapota juice,<br>
e)	coagulating the tannins in the above said sapota juice by adding optionally 1% gelatin solution at the rate of 0.4-0.8 ml per 100 grams juice or honey at the rate of 0.25 grams to 1 gram per 100 grams juice, followed by incubation at a temperature in the range of 25-45°C for a period ranging from 30 minutes to 2 hours and,<br>
f)	pasteurizing the above said juice mixture at a temperature of 800C, followed by filtration by conventional method to obtain the desired clarified sapota juice.<br>
