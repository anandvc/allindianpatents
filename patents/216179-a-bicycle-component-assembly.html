				<td>This invention relates to a bicycle component assembly and generally relates to a cable fixing boit retaining tool or clip for holding a cable fixing bolt of a bicycle part. More specifically, the present invention relates a cable fixing bolt retaining tool or clip for aiding in the assembly of a bicycle component by maintaining the cable fixing bolt in a loose condition during shipping and/or storage.<br>
Bicycling is becoming an increasingly more popular form of recreation, as well as a means of transportation. Moreover, bicycling has become a very popular competitive sport for both amateurs and professionals. Whether the bicycle is used for recreation, transportation or competition, the bicycle industry is constantly improving the various components of the bicycle. Accordingly, bicycle owners are constantly upgrading the various bicycle components with the latest improvements and bicycle shops must carry the latest improvements in bicycle components.<br>
Bicycle components, such as derailleurs and brakes, are typically operated by levers or operating devices coupled thereto via control cables. These control cables are typically coupled to the bicycle components by cable fixing bolts. In the past, when the bicycle component manufacturer would ship a deraiiieur or brake to the manufacturer or a bicycle store, the cable fixing bolt would have to be firmly tightened to prevent the cable fixing bolt from falling out. If the cable fixing boit is too loose, the vibration during shipping can result in the cable fixing bolt falling out of the brake or deraiiieur and then becoming lost.<br>
Upon receiving a brake or deraiiieur, the bicycle manufacturer or the individual bicycle dealer will have to loosen the cable fixing bolts in order to couple the control cable thereto. Depending upon the torque applied to the cable fixing bolt, the installer may have some difficulty in loosening the cable fixing bolt. If the cable fixing bolt is hard to loosen, then this will result in a more time consuming installation of the bicycle components, as well as possible frustration on the part of the installer.<br><br>
In a low normal type rear derailleur, the tension pulley of the derailleur is normally biased to hold the chain on the low or large gear of the rear set of gears of the bicycle. In other words, the spring of the derailleur normally holds the rear derailleur in an extended position. Thus, low normal type rear derailleurs typically require large boxes for shipping. In order to reduce the size of a low normal type derailleur for shipping, a tool has been developed to hold the low normal type of derailleur in its retracted position. In other words, the tool is designed to hold the rear derailleur in a more compact position or shipping and storage. Specifically, this tool is Jocated in the linkage assembly of the rear derailleur so as to hold the spring of the linkage assembly in a compressed or retracted position. More specifically, the tool holds the rear derailleur in a top gear position so as to be more compact. By using such a tool, a low normal type derailleur can be shipped in a smaller package. However, this tool does not prevent the cable fixing bolt from falling out of the derailleur.<br>
In view of the above, there exists a need for a cable fixing bolt retaining tool or clip for holding a cable fixmg bolt, which overcomes the above mentioned problems in the prior art. This invention addresses this need in the prior art as well as other needs, which will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTrON OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring initially to Figure 1, a conventional bicycle 10 is illustrated with various bicycle components. Many of these bicycle components are operated by levers or operating devices coupled thereto via cables. The cables are typically coupled to the bicycle components by cable fixing bolts. The present invention is directed to using a cable fixing bolt retaining tool or chp 12 to hold the cable fixing bolt of a bicycle component in a loosened condition for easy assembly. The bicycle 10 has cable operated components such as a rear derailleur 13, a front derailleur 14 and a pair of brakes 15. The rear and front derailleurs 13 and 14 are operated by shifting units 18 via shift cables 20 in a conventional manner. Likewise, brakes 15 are operated by brake operating devices or levers 22 via brake cables 24 in a conventional manner.<br><br>
Bicycles and their various components are well knov-Ti in the art, and thus, bicycle 10 and its various components will not be discussed or illustrated in detail herein except for the components that relate to the present invention. In other words, only derailleurs 13 and 14 and brakes 15 will be briefly discussed and/or illustrated herein as they relate to the present invention.<br>
As best seen in Figures 2 and 3, rear derailleur 13 is a low normal type<br>
derailleur that is normally biased to the low or large gearof the rear set of gears of<br>
bicycle 10. In this embodiment, the cable fixing bolt retaining tool 12 is designed to<br>
for hold rear derailleur 13 in a more compact position f. shipping and storage. More<br>
specifically, the cable fixing bolt retaining tool 12 holds the rear derailleur 13 in a top<br>
gear position so as to be more compact. Derailleur 13 can be a relatively conventional<br>
low normal type derailleur. Thus, rear derailleur 13 will not be discussed or<br>
illustrated in detail herein. Rather, rear derailleur 13 will only be briefly discussed in<br>
order to understand the use of cable fixing bolt retaining too! 12 therewith.<br>
Basically, rear derailleur 13 has a base or fixed member 30, a movable member 31, a linkage assembly 32 and a biasing member or spring 33. The fixed member 30 is coupled to the frame of the bicycle 10 via a conventional bracket axle assembly 34. The linkage assembly 32 has inner and outer links 35 and 36 pivotally coupled at one end to the base member 30 and at the other end to the movable member 31. The biasing member or spring located between the fixed member 30 and the movable member 31 for urging the movable member 31 to a low gear position-Preferably, each of the parts of rear derailleur 13 is constructed of relatively lightweight, rigid materials which are well known in the art. The movable member 31 has a cage 37 pivotally coupled thereto and biased to place the chain of bicycle 10 under tension. The cage 37 has a guide pulley 3S and a tension pulley 39 rotatably coupled thereto.<br>
In this embodiment, the cable fixing bolt 40 is coupled to the actuating arm of the inner link 35 of the linkage assembly 32 with a cable fixing plate 41 located therebetween. More specifically, the inner link 35 has an integral nut portion 42 wiih a threaded hole for threadedly receiving cable fixing boll 40 therein. The cable fixing bolt 40 is a relatively conventional cable fixing bolt having a head portion 44 and a shaft portion 45 with threads thereon that extends from the head portion 44 to a free<br><br>
end. The cable fixing plate 41 is movably located on the threaded shaft portion HJ ui the cable fixing bolt 40 so as to be located between the head portion 44 of the cable fixing bolt 40 and the nut portion 42 of the inner link 35. While ttie nut portion 42 is an integral part of the inner link 35 in this embodiment, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure that the inner link 3 5 can be provided with an unthreaded hole and a sarate nut could be utilized. Of course, this is less preferably than the disclosed embodiment, since it will increase the difficulty of installation.<br>
"When the shift cable 20 is attached to the inner link 35, the inner wire of the shift cable 20 is located between the nut portion 42 of the inner link 35 and the cable fixing plate 41. Thus, head portion 44 of the cable fixing bolt 40 does not directly engage the inner wire of the shift cable 20.<br>
Cable fixing bolt retaining tool 12 is utilized to hold cable fixmg bolt 40 in a loosened condition relative to the inner link 35. This will allow the rear derailleur 13 to be shipped and/or stored with the cable fixing bolt 40 in its loosened condition without the cable fixing bolt 40 becoming separated from the derailleur 13, and thus, bemg lost. By holding the cable fixing bolt 40 in the loosened condition, installation and coupling of the shift cable 20 to the inner link 35 is expedited. Preferably, cable fixing bolt retaining tool 12 is constructed as a one-piece, unitary member. Preferably, cable fixing bolt retaining tool 12 is constructed of a hard, rigid plastic material that is relatively lightweight and inexpensive. Of course, other suitable materials that do not include these advantages could also be utifized. For example, cable fixing bolt retaming tool 12 can be formed of a reinforced polypropylene, or a poiyacetai such as POM, or any other suitable thermoplastic material.<br>
Basically, as seen in Figures 5, 6 and 9, cable fixing bolt retaining too] 12 includes a body portion 49, a gripping portion 50 and three bolt retaining portions 51, 52 and 53 extending from the body portion 49. The threebolt retaining portions 51, 52 and 53 hold the cable fixing bolt 40 in a loosened condition. In this embodiment, the first bolt retaining portion 51 engages the head portion 44 of the cable fixing bolt 40. The second bolt retaining portion 52 is located adjacent the threaded shaft portion 45 of the cable fixing bolt 40. The third bolt retaining portion 53 is located between the nut portion 42 of the inner link 3 5 and the movable member 31 of the derailleur 13. In this embodiment, the third bolt retaining portion 53 does not only hold the<br><br>
cable fixing bolt 40 in a loosened conditionj but it also holds the rear derailleur 13 in a top gear position or a more compact position against the force of the biasing member or spring 33.<br>
As best seen in Figiire 9, the first and second bolt retaining portions 51 and 52 of the cable fixing bolt retaining tool 12 extend substantially perpendicular to the body portion 49 and are substantially parallel to each other. The first and second retaining portions 51 and 52 are preferably spaced apart from each other by a distance corresponding to the axial length of the head portion 44 of the cable fixing bolt 40 and the thickness of the cable fixing plate 41 as seen in Figures S and 6. Accordingly, when the cable fixing bolt retaining tool 12 is installed on the derailleur 13, the head portion 44 of the cable fixing bolt 40 and the cable fixing plate 41 are located between the first and second bolt retaining portions 51 and 52. Alternatively, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art fim this disclosure that the cable fixing plate 41 could be located on the opposite side of the second bolt retaining portion 52, if needed and/or desired. In this alternate possibility, the spacing between the first and second bolt retaining portions 51 and 52 would be reduced to the axial length or thickness of the head portion 44 of the cable fixing bolt 40.<br>
In this embodiment of the cable fixing bolt retaining tool 12, the third bolt retaining portion 53 has a pair of notches 54 and 55 that receive the nut portion 42 of the inner link 35 and the movable member 31, respectively. Accordingly, when the inner link35 and movable member 31 are positioned within the notches 54 and 55 of the third bolt retaining portion 53, the cable fixing bolt retaining tool 12 is securely &amp;stened to the rear derailleur 13. More specifically, the biasing member or spring 33 applies a pair of opposing forces on the third bolt retaining portion 53 to secure cable fixing bolt retaining tool 12 to derailleur 13. The cable fixing bolt retaining tool 12 is installed by moving the linkage assembly 32 against the force of the biasing spring 33 such that it moves from a low gear position to a top gear position. This movement will cause the space between the movable member 31 and the inner link 35 at the nut portion 42 to be increased.<br>
Now, the cable fixing bolt retaining tool 12 can be inserted between the nut portion 42 of the inner link 35 and the movle member 31 such that the first notch 54 of the third bolt retaining portion 53 engages the nut portion 42 of the inner link 35<br><br>
and the second notch 55 of the third bolt retaining portion 53 engages the movable member 31. Upon releasing the linkage assembly 32, the spring 33 will urge the movable member 31 towards the nutportion 42 of the inner Iink35. However, movements of the movable member 31 and linkage assembly 32 are limited by the third bolt retaining portion 53. The notches 54 and 55 of the third bolt retaining portion 53 have a pair of opposed abutment surfaces 56 and 57, respectively, that limit any movement in a direction that is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the threaded shaft portion 45 of the cable fixing bolt 40. This arrangement ensures that the cable fixing bolt retaining tool 12 does not accidentally disengage from the deraiUeur 13, and thus, this arrangement prevents the cable fixing bolt 40 to fall out.<br>
As seen in Figure 2, when the cable fixing bolt retaining tool 12 is not instaUed in the rear deraiUeur 13, the rear deraiUeur 13 is in an extended position and takes up a lot of space. This is because the rear deraiUeur 13 is a low normal type rear deraiUeur, in which the guide pulley 38 is nonnaUy biased to hold the chain on the low or large gear of the rear set of gears of the bicycle 10. In other words, flie spring 33 of the rear deraiUeur 13 normally holds the rear deraiUeur 13 in an extended position. Thus, the low normal type rear deraiUeur 13 requires a larger box for shipping in an extended position, lii order to reduce the size of a low normal type deraiUeur for shipping, the cable fixing bolt retaining tool 12 holds the low normal type deraiUeur 13 in its retracted position as seen in Figures 3 and 4. In other words, the cable fixing bolt retaining tool 12 is designed to hold the rear deraiUeur 13 in a more compact position or shipping and storage. Specifically, the third bolt retaining portion 53 of the cable fixing bolt retaining tool 12 is located between the movable member 31 and the inner link 35 to hold the spring 33 of the Unkage assembly 32 in a compressed or retracted position. Thus, the cable fixing bolt retaining too] 12 holds the rear deraiUeur in a top gear position so as to be more compact. By using the cable fixing bolt retaining tool 12, the low normal type deraiUeur 13 can be shipped in a smaller package.<br>
As seen in Figure 9, the second bolt retaining portion 52 is preferably provided with a recess or notch 58 that allows the second retaining portion 52 to partially surround the threaded shaft portion 45 of the cable fixing bolt 40. This notch or recess 58 of the second bolt retaining portion 52 also allows the first bolt retaining<br><br>
portion 51 to more firmly and completely engage the head portion 44 of the cable fixing bolt 40. Of course, as seen in Figure 10, a slightly modified cable fixing bolt retaining tool 12" is illustrated in which the notch or recess of the second bolt retaining portion has been eliminated. This modified cable fixing bolt retaining tool 12" is otherwise identical to the cable fixing bolt retaining tool 12 discussed above. Therefore, the same reference numerals will be utilized to indicate the identical or substantially identical portions, but with a prime. In other words, cable fixing bolt retaining tool 12" includes a body portion 49", a gripping portion 50" and three bolt retaiinng portions 51", 52"and 53".<br>
SECOND EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring now to Figures 11 -1S, a cable fixing bolt retaining tool U 2 in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention is illustrated for use with a modified rear derailleur 113 to be mounted on bicycle 10. This embodiment is similar to the first embodiment, discussed above, except that the cable fixing bolt retaining tool 112 of this embodiment does not mclude the shipping and storage feature of the first embodiment and the cIe fixing bolt 140 has been modified.<br>
As best seen in Figures U and 12, rear derailleur 113 is a top normal type derailleur that is normally biased to the top or small gear of the rear set of gears of bicycle 10. Derailleur 113 can be a relatively conventional top normal type derailleur. Thus, rear derailleur 113 will not be discussed or illustrated in detail herein. Rather, rear derailleur 113 will only be briefly discussed in order to understand the use of cable fixing bolt retainrng tool 112 therewith.<br>
Basically, rear derailleur 113 has a base or fixed member 130, a movable member 131, a linkage assembly 132 and a biasing member or spring (not shown). The fixed member 130 is coupled to the firame of the bicycle 10 via a conventional bracket axle assembly 134. The linkage assembly 132 has an inner link (not shown) and an outer link 136 pivotally coupled at one end to the base member 130 and at the other end to the movable member 131. The biasing member or spring located between the fixed member 13 0 and the movable member 131 for urging the movable member 131 to atop gear position. Preferably, each of the parts of rear derailleur 113 is constructed of relatively lightweight, rigid materials which are well known in the art. The movable member 131 has a cage 137 pivotally coupled thereto and biased to<br><br>
place the chain of bicycle 10 under tension. The cage 137 has a guide pulley 138 and a tension pulley 139 rotatably coupled thereto.<br>
In this embodiment, the cable fixing bolt 140 is located in an unthreaded hole ofthe outer link 136 ofthe linkage assembly 132 with a cable fixing plate 141 located between the outer link 136 and nut 142. More specifically, the outer link 136 has a non-circular hole for engaging a corresponding part ofthe cable fixing bolt 140 to prevent relative rotation therebetween. The cable fixing bolt 140 is a relatively conventional cable fixing bolt having a head portion 144 and a threaded shaft portion 145 extending from the head portion 144 to a fie end. The nut 142 has a threaded hole for threadedly receiving cable fixing bolt 140 therein. The cable fixing plate 141 is movably located on the threaded shaft portion 145 ofthe cable fixing bolt 140 so as to be located between the nut and the outer link 136.<br>
When the shift cable 20 is attached to the outer link 136, the inner wire ofthe shift cable 20 is located between the outer surface ofthe outer link 136 and the cable fixing plate 141. Thus, the nut 142 on the shaft portion 145 ofthe cable fixing bolt 140 does not directly engage the inner wire ofthe shift cable 20.<br>
Cable fixing bolt retaining tool 112 is utilized to hold cable fixing bolt 140 in a loosened condition relative to the outer link 136. This will allow the rear derailleur 113 to be shipped and/or stored with the cable fixing bolt 140 in its loosened condition without the cable fixing bolt 140 becoming separated from the derailleur 113, and thus, being lost. By holding the cable fixing bolt 140 in the loosened condition, installation and coupling ofthe shift cable 20 to the outer link 136 is expedited. Preferably, cable fixing bolt retaining tool 112 is constructed as a one-piece, unitary member. Preferably, cable fixing bolt retaining tool 112 is constracted of a hard, rigid plastic material that is relatively lightweight and inexpensive. Of course, other suitable materials that do not include these advantages could also be utilized.<br>
Basically, as seen in Figure 17, cable fixing bolt retaining tool 112 includes a body portion 149, a gripping portion 150 and three bolt retaining portions 151, 152 and 153 extending firom the body portion 149.

151,	152 and 153 of the cable fixing bolt retaining tool 112 extend substantially<br>
oerpendicular to the body portion 149 and are substantially parallel to each other. The<br>
irst and second retaining portions 151 and 152 are preferably spaced apart fim each ither by a distance corresponding to the axial length of the head portion 144 of the :able fixing bolt 140 and the thickness of the outer link 136 as seen in Figures 13 and 14. Accordingly, when the cable fixing bolt retaining tool 112 is installed on the ierailleur 113, the head portion 144 ofthe cable fixing bolt 140 and a portion of the outer link 136 are located between the first and second bolt retaming portions 151 and<br>
152.	Alternatively, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure<br>
that the cable fixing plate 141 could be located between the first and second bolt<br>
retaining portions 151 and 152, if needed and/or desired. In this alternate possibility,<br>
the spacing between the first and second bolt retaining portions 151 and 152 would be<br>
increased to the axial length or thickness of cable fixing plate 141.<br>
As seen in Figure 17, the second bolt retaining portion 152 is preferably provided with a recess or notch 158 that allows the second retaining portion 152 to partially surround the threaded shaft portion 145 ofthe cable fixing bolt 140. This notch or recess 158 ofthe second bolt retaining portion 152 also allows the first boit retaining portion 151 to more firmly and completely engage the head portion 144 of the cable fixing bolt 140. Of course, as seen in Figure 18, a slightly modified cable fixing bolt retaining tool 112" is illustrated in which the notch or recess ofthe second bolt retaining portion has been eliminated. This modified cable fixing bolt retaining too! 112" is otherwise identical to the cable fixing bolt retaining tool 112 discussed above. Therefore, the same reference numerals will be utilized to indicate the identical or substantially identical portions, but with a prime. In other words, cable fixing boit retaining tool 112" includes a body portion 149", a gripping portion 150" and three bolt retaining portions 151", 152" and 153".<br><br>
Referring again to Figure 17, the third bolt retaining portion 153 is preferably provided with a concavity or bore 160. The free end of threaded shaft portion 145 of the cable fixing bolt 140 is preferably received within the concavity or bore 160. In this preferred embodiment, the concavity or bore 160 is a blind bore. Of course, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure that bore 160 can be a through bore, if needed and/or desired.<br>

The cable fixing bolt retaining tool or clip 612 of this embodiment is similar to the sixth embodiment, discussed above, except that cable fixing bolt retaining tool 612 has been slightly modified.<br>
Basically, as seen in Figure 43, cable fixing bolt retaining tool 612 includes a body portion 649, a gripping portion 650 and three bolt retaining portions 651, 552 and 653 extending from the body portion 649. The three bolt retaining portions 651, 652 and 653 hold the cable fixing bolt 540 in a loosened condition. In this embodiment, the first bolt retaining portion 651 engages the head portion 544 of the cable fixing bolt 540. The second bolt retaining portion 652 is located adjacent the threaded shaft portion 545 of the cable fixiag holt 540. The third bolt retaining portion 653 engages the nut portion 542 of the brake arm. In this embodiment, the<br><br>
third bolt retaining portion 653 has a protrusion 654 that is received in the threaded hole 543 of the nut portion 542. The end of the threaded shaft portion 545 of cable fixing bolt 540 is spaced from protrusion 654.<br>
As best seen in Figure 43, the first and second bolt retaining portions 651 and 652 of the cable fixing bolt retaining tool 612 extend substantially perpendicular to the body portion 649 and are substantially parallel to each other. The first and second retaining portions 651 and 652 are preferably spaced apart from each other by a distance corresponding to the axial length of the head portion 544 of the cable fixing bolt 540 and the thickness of the cable fixing plate 541 as seen in Figure 42. Accordingly, when the cable fixing bolt retaining tool 612 is installed on the brake 15, the head portion 544 of the cable fixing bolt 540 and the cable fixing plate 541 are located between the first and second bolt retaining portions 651 and 652.<br>
As seen in Figure 43, the second bolt retaining portion 652 is preferably provided with a recess or notch 658 that allows the second retaining portion 652 to partially surround the threaded shaft portion 545 of the cable fixing bolt 540. This notch or recess 658 of the second bolt retaining portion 652 also allows the first bolt retaining portion 651 to more firmly and completely engage the head portion 544 of the cable fixing bolt 540. Of course, as seen in Figure 44, a slightly modified cable fixing bolt retaining tool 612" is illustrated in which the notch or recess of the second bolt retaining portion has been eliminated. This modified cable fixing bolt retaining tool 612" is otherwise identical to the cable fixing bolt retaining tool 612 discussed above. Therefore, the same reference numerals will be utilized to indicate the identical or substantially identical portions, but with a prime. In other words, cable fixing bolt retaining tool 612" includes a body portion 649", a gripping portion 650" and three bolt retaining portions 651", 652" and 653". The third bolt retaining portion 653" has a protrusion 654" for engaging threaded hole 543 of the nut portion 542.<br>
While several embodiments have been chosen to illustrate the present invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure that various changes and modifications can be made herein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. Furthermore, the foregoing description of the embodiments according to the present invention are provided for<br><br>
