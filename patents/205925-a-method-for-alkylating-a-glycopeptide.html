REDUCTIVE ALKYLATION PROCESS<br>
PRIORITY OF INVENTION<br>
This application claims priority to United States Provisional Application Number 60/201,178, filed 02 May 2000; and to United States Provisional Application Number 60/213,148, filed 22 June 2000, which applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention is directed to an improved method for reductively alkylating a saccharide-amine of a glycopepti ide antibiotic. Specifically, the method of the invention allows for selective alkylation at a saccharide-amine over other amine sites in the glycopeptide (e.g. a leucINyl nitrogen).<br>
Background<br>
Glycopeptides are a wel -known class of antibiotics produced by various microorganisms (see Glycopeptide Antibiotics, edited by R. Nagarajan, Marcel Dekker, Inc. New York (1994))  These complex multi-ring peptide compounds are effective antibacterial agents against a majority of Gram-positive bacteria. Although potent antibacterial agents, the glycopeptides antibiotics are not used in the treatment of bacterial diseases as often as other classes of antibiotics, such as the semisynthetic penicillins, cephalosporins and lincomycins, due to concerns regarding toxicity.<br>
In recent years, however, bacterial resistance to many of the commonly-used antibiotics has developed (see J. E. Geraci et al.. Mayo Clin. Proc, 1983,55, 88-91; and M. Foldes, J. Antimicrob. Chemother, 1983, 11, 21-26). Since glycopeptide antibiotics are often effective against these resistant strains of bacteria, glycopeptides<br><br>
such as vancomycin have become the drugs of last resort for treating infections caused by these organisms. Recently, however, resistance to vancomycin has appeared in various microorganisms, such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), leading to mcreasing concerns about the ability to effectively treat bacterial infections in the future (see Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee, Infection Control Hospital Epidemiology, 1995,17,364-369; A. P. Johnson et al.. Clinical Microbiology Rev., 1990,5,280-291; G. M. Eliopoulos, European J. Clinical Microbiol.^ Infection Disease, 1993,12,409-412; and P. Courvalin, Antimicrob, Agents Chemother, 1990,34,2291-2296).<br>
In an attempt to identify agents with improved antibacterial properties, or to identify agents that are effective against resistant bacterial strains, numerous derivatives of vancomycin and other glycopeptides have been prepared. For example, see U.S. Patent Nos. 4,639,433; 4,643,987; 4,497,802; 5,840,684; and 5,843,889. Other derivatives are disclosed in EP 0 802 199; EP 0 801 075; WO 97/28812; WO 97/38702; WO 98/52589; WO 98/52592; and in J Amer. Chem. Soc, 1996,118,13107-13108; J. Amer. Chem. Soc, 1997,119,12041-12047; and J. Amer. Chem. Soc, 1994,116,4573-4590.<br>
One group of glycopeptide derivatives that has been reported to have useful antibiotic properties includes glycopeptide compounds that are alkylated at a nitrogen on a saccharide of the glycopeptide. See for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,919,756; 5,843,889; 5,916,873; 4,698,327; and 5,591,714; and European Patent AppUcation PubUcation Nos. EP 435 503A1; and EP 667 353A1. One difficulty that is encountered in preparing such alkylated derivatives is the non-selective alkylation at multiple amme sights within the glycopeptide compound. For example, vancomycin has a vancosamine amino group, and a leucinyl amino group. Thus, alkylation under standard conditions typically provides a mixture of mono- and di-alkylated compounds.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,952,466 and 5,998,581 disclose a method for the reductive alkylation of a copper complex of a glycopeptide antibiotic such as<br><br>
vancomycin or A82846B, which favors alkylation at the saccharide amino group. In spite of this disclosure, there is currently a need for additional methods that are useful for the selective alkylation of glycopeptide antibiotics at a saccharide-amino group. In particular, there is a need for highly selective methods that are simple and efficient to carry out.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Previously, the reductive alkylation of glycopeptide antibiotics was carried out by combining an aldehyde, a glycopeptide antibiotic, and a suitable base to form an imine and/or hemiaminal; subsequently adding a suitable reducing agent (e.g. sodium cyanoborohydride); and then adding a suitable acid (e.g. trifluoroacetic acid).<br>
Applicant has unexpectedly discovered that by contacting the glycopeptide and the aldehyde to form the imine and/or hemiaminal in the presence of a suitable base, and then acidifying the mixture before contact with the reducing agent, the selectivity for the reductive alkylation at a saccharide-amine is significantly improved, i.e. reductive alkylation at a saccharide-amino group (e.g. a vancosamine amino group) in vancomycin is favored over reductive alkylation at other amino groups (e.g. a leucinyl amino group) in vancomycin.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for alkylating a glycopeptide that comprises a saccharide-amine comprising:<br>
combining an aldehyde or ketone, a suitable base, and the glycopeptide or a salt thereof, to provide a reaction mixture;<br>
acidifying the reaction mixture; and<br>
combining the reaction mixture with a suitable reducing agent, to provide a glycopeptide that is alkylated at the saccharide-amine.<br>
Preferably, the glycopeptide comprises at least one amino group other than the saccharide-amine. More preferably, the glycopeptide is vancomycin or A82846B.<br><br>
Preferably, the reductive alkylation at the saccharide-amine is favored over -eductive alkylation at another amino group of the glycopeptide by at least about 10:1; and more preferably, by at least about 15:1 or about 20:1.<br>
The reductive alkylation is typically carried out in the presence of a suitable solvent or combination of solvents, such as, for example, a halogenated hydrocarbon (e.g. methylene chloride), a linear or branched ether (e.g. diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran), an aromatic hydrocarbon (e.g. benzene or toluene), an alcohol (methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), N,N-dimethylfonnamide, acetonitrile, water, l,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(lH)-pyrimidone, tetramethyl urea, N,N-dimethyIacetamide, diethylfonnamide (DMF), 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, tetramethylenesulfoxide, glycerol, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, N,N-dimethylpropylene urea (DMPU) or dioxane. Preferably the alkylation is carried out in acetonitrile/water, or DMF/methanol.<br>
Preferably the reduction (i.e. treatment with the reducing agent) is carried out in the presence of a protic solvent, such as, for example, an alcohol (e.g. methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, or butanol), water, or the like.<br>
The reductive alkylation can be carried out at any suitable temperature from the freezing point to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. Preferably the reaction is carried out at a temperature in the range of about 0 °C to about 100 °C. More preferably at a temperature in a range of about 0 °C to about 50 °C, or in a range of about 20°C to about 30°C.<br>
Any suitable base can be employed in the reductive alkylation. Preferred bases include tertiary amines (e.g. diisopropylethylamine, N-methyhnorpholine or triethylamine) and the like.<br>
Any suitable acid can be used to acidify the reaction mixture. Suitable acids include carboxylic acids (e.g. acetic acid, trichloroacetic acid, citric acid, formic acid, or trifluoroacetic acid), mineral acids (e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or phosphoric acid), and the like. A preferred acid is trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
Suitable reducing agents for carrying out reductive alkylations are known in the art. Any suitable reducing agent can be employed in the methods of the<br><br>
invention, provided it is compatible with the functionality present in the glycopeptide. For example, suitable reducing agents include sodium cyanoborohydride, sodium triacetoxyborohydride, pyridine/borane, sodium borohydride, and zinc borohydride. The reduction can also be carried out in the presence of a transition metal catalyst (e.g. palladium or platinum) in the presence of a hydrogen source (e.g. hydrogen gas or cycloheadiene). See for example,, Advanced Organic Chemistry, Fourth Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1992), 899-900.<br>
Upon completion of the reductive alkylation, the alkylated glycopeptide can be isolated from the reaction mixture using standard techniques. For example, the alkylated glycopeptide can be precipitated from the reaction mixture with acetonitrile, or the reaction mixture can be poured into water, and sodium bicarbonate can be added to a pH of about 5 to provide the alkylated glycopeptide as a precipitate.<br>
Any glycopeptide comprising an amino saccharide can be employed  in the methods of the invention. Such glycopeptides are well-known in the art and are either commercially available or may be isolated using conventional procedures. For example, suitable glycopeptides are disclosed in, and can be prepared from, glycopeptides disclosed in, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,067,099; 3,338,786; 3,803,306: 3,928,571; 3,952,095; 4,029,769; 4,051,237; 4,064,233; 4,122,168; 4,239,751 4,303,646; 4,322,343; 4,378,348; 4,497,802; 4,504,467; 4,542,018; 4,547,488: 4,548,925; 4,548,974; 4,552,701; 4,558,008; 4,639,433; 4,643,987; 4,661,470: 4,694,069; 4,698,327; 4,782,042; 4,914,187; 4,935,238; 4,946,941; 4,994,555: 4,996,148; 5,187,082; 5,192,742; 5,312,738; 5,451,570; 5,591,714; 5,721,208: 5,750,509; 5,840,684; and 5,843,889.

In the following reaction schemes, the glycopeptide compounds are depicted in a simplified fonm as a box "G" that shows the carboxy terminus labeled [C], the vancosamine amino terminus labeled [V], the "non-saccharide" amino terminus (i.e. the leucine amine moiety) labeled [N], and optionally, the resorcinol moiety labeled [R] as follows:<br><br>
By way of illustration, a glycopeptide compound, such as vancomycin, can be reductive alkylated according to a method of the invention as illustrated in the following reaction:<br><br><br>
This reaction is typically conducted by first contacting one equivalent of the glycopeptide (e.g., vancomycin) with an excess, preferably, with about 1.1 to 3 equivalents, of an aldehyde (or ketone) in the presence of an excess, preferably about 1.1 about 3.5 equivalents, of a tertiary amine, such as diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) or the like, to form an imine and/or hemiaminal intermediate or mixture of such intermediates. This reaction is typically conducted in an inert diluent, such as DMF or acetonitrile/water, at a temperature ranging from about 0°C to about 50°C, preferably at ambient temperature, for about 0.25 to about 2 hours or until formation of the imine and/or hemiaminal intermediate(s) is substantially complete. The imine and/or hemiaminal intermediate(s) is typically not isolated, but is contacted in situ with an acid, such as trifluoroacetic acid, for a period of time sufficient to partially or completely hydrolyze any imine and/or hemiaminal formed at the N-terminus of the glycopeptide (e.g., at the leucinyl amino group of vancomycin). Typically, the reaction mixture containing the imine and/or hemiaminal intermediate(s) is contacted with an excess of the acid, preferably with about 1.2 to 8 equivalents, at a temperature ranging from about 0°C to about 50°C, preferably at ambient temperature, for about 0.25 to about 6 hours; preferably, for about 0.5 to about 3 hours; more preferably, for about 1 to about 2 hours. A reducing agent, such as sodium cyanoborohydride, is then added to the reaction mixture to form the alkylated reaction product. Optionally, a protic solvent, such as methanol, is also added with the reducing agent. Typically, this reduction reaction is conducted by contacting the reaction mixture with at least one equivalent, preferably about 1.0 to<br><br>
about 3 equivalents, of the reducing agent at a temperature ranging from about 0°C to about 50°C, preferably at ambient temperature, until the reduction reaction is substantially complete, preferably, for 0.1 to 6 hours; more preferably, for about 2 to 4 hours. The resulting alkylated product is readily purified by conventional procedures, such as precipitation and/or reverse-phase HPLC. Surprisingly, by forming the imine and/or hemiaminal in the presence of a trialkyl amine, and then acidifying with trifluoroacetic acid before contact with the reducing agent, the selectivity for the reductive alkylation reaction is greatly improved.<br>
Additionally, ketones may substituted for the aldehydes in the reductive alkylation reactions to afford a-substituted amines.<br>
Suitable starting materials for the methods of the invention, which are substituted at the resorcinol moiety [R], can be prepared as illustrated in the following scheme (in this scheme, the resorcinol moiety has been shown for clarity). For example, an aminoalkyl sidechain at the resorcinol moiety of a glycopeptide, such as vancomycin, can be introduced via a Mannich reaction. In this reaction, an amine (NHRaRb') and an aldehyde (CH2O), such as formalin (a source of formaldehyde), are reacted with the glycopeptide under basic conditions to give the glycopeptide derivative:<br><br>
Accordingly, the methods of the invention can optionally comprise the step of first preparing a starting material that is substituted at the resorcinol moiety (e.g. using a procedure similar to that described above).<br><br>
A substituent can also be introduced at the resorcinol moiety of a glycopeptide after carrying out the reductive alkylation of the invention. Accordingly, the method of the invention can also optionally further comprise alkylating the glycopeptide antibiotic that is alkylated at a saccharide-amine at the resorcinol moiety [R] (e.g. using a procedure similar to that described above), to provide a glycopeptide antibiotic that is alkylated at a saccharide-amine and that is substituted on the resorcinol ring.<br>
The glycopeptide compounds can also be modified at the carboxy terminus either prior to or subsequent to the reductive alkylation to provide a glycopeptide antibiotic.<br>
Compounds of the invention comprising a sulfoxide or sulfone can be prepared from the corresponding thio compounds using conventional reagents and procedures. Suitable reagents for oxidizing a thio compound to a sulfoxide include, by way of example, hydrogen peroxide, peracides such as 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (MCPBA), sodium periodate, sodium chlorite, sodium hypochlorite, calcium hypochlorite, tert-butyl hypochlorite and the like. Chiral oxidizing reagents, (optically active reagents) may also be employed to provide chiral sulfoxides. Such optically active reagents are well-known in the art and include, for example, the reagents described m Kagen et al,, Synlett., 1990,643-650.<br>
The aldehydes and ketones employed in the above reactive alkylation reactions are also well-known in the art and are either commercially available or can be prepared by conventional procedures using commercially available starting materials and conventional reagents (for example see Mexohy Ach'anced Organic Chemistry, Fourth Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1992), and references cited therein).<br>

A typical suppositoly formulation will generally consist of active ingredient with a binding and/or lubricating agent such as a gelatin or cocoa butter or other low melting vegetable or synthetic wax or fat.<br><br>
