				<td>Title: PLASTIC CONTAINER HAVING A<br>
CARBON-TREATED INTERNAL SURFACE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
 The present invention relates to plastic containers based<br>
on recycled plastic. More particularly, the present invention<br>
relates to blow molded plastic containers based on recycled<br>
plastic, having barrier properties and having a carbon-coated<br>
internal surface.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
 It is highly desirable to provide plastic containers having<br>
barrier properties, and it is also highly desirable to provide<br>
plastic containers using recycled plastic. However, recycled<br>
plastic generally does not have barrier properties and cannot be<br>
used in containers in direct contact with container contents.<br>
Therefore, despite the economic desirability of using recycled<br>
plastic, the use of such material has been difficult.<br>
 Conventionally, the use of recycled plastic in containers<br>
especially those holding contents for human consumption has been<br>
limited to multi-layer plastic containers where the recycled<br>
plastic is an outer layer which does not come into direct<br>
contact with the container contents.<br>
 Multi-layer plastic containers are commonly used for<br>
packaging items in a wide range of fields, including food and<br>
beverage, medicine, health and beauty, and home products.<br>
Plastic containers are known for being easily molded, cost<br>
competitive, lightweight, and generally suitable for many<br>
applications. Multi-layered containers provide the benefit of<br>
being able to use different materials in each of the layers,<br>
wherein each material has a specific property adapted to perform<br>
a desired function.<br>
 Because plastic containers may permit low molecular gases,<br>
such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, to slowly permeate through<br>
their physical configurations, the use of plastic containers<br><br>
sometimes proves to be less desirable when compared to<br>
containers formed from other less permeable materials, such as<br>
metal or glass. In most applications, the shelf life of the<br>
product cpntents is directly related to the package's ability to<br>
effectively address such molecular permeation. In the case of<br>
carbonated beverages, such as beer, oxygen in the atmosphere<br>
surrounding the container can gradually permeate inwardly<br>
through the plastic walls of the container to reach the inside<br>
of the container and deteriorate the contents. Likewise, carbon<br>
dioxide gas associated with the contents may permeate outwardly<br>
through the plastic walls of the container until eventually<br>
being released on the outside, causing the carbonated beverage<br>
to lose some of its flavor and possibly become "flat".<br>
 To address some to the foregoing concerns, plastic<br>
container manufacturers have utilized various techniques to<br>
reduce or eliminate the absorption and/or permeability of such<br>
gases. Some of the more common techniques include: increasing<br>
the thickness of all or portions of the walls of the container;<br>
incorporating one or more barrier layers into the wall<br>
structure; including oxygen-scavenging or reacting materials<br>
within the walls of the container; and applying various coatings<br>
to the internal and/or external surface of the container.<br>
However, a number of conventional barrier and/or scavenger<br>
materials will not effectively curtail the permeation of both<br>
oxygen and carbon dioxide over extended periods of time.<br>
Moreover, there are usually other practical concerns associated<br>
with most conventional techniques, most commonly, increased<br>
material costs and/or production inefficiencies.<br>
 In recent times, the use of plastics has become a<br>
significant social issue. Recycling has become an increasingly<br>
important environmental concern and a number of governments and<br>
regulatory authorities continue to address the matter. In a<br>
number of jurisdictions, legislation pertaining to minimum<br>
recycled plastic content and the collection, return, and reuse<br>
of plastic containers has either been considered or has already<br><br>
been enacted. For example, in the case of plastic containers<br>
used to hold consumable items, such as food items or beverages,<br>
regulations often require a certain content and minimum<br>
thickness of the innermost layer that comes in contact with the<br>
contents. Conventional processes, such as co- or multiple-<br>
injection molding, are often limited as to the amount of<br>
recycled plastic that can be effectively incorporated into the<br>
structure of the container. Commonly, the amount of recycled<br>
content that can be effectively incorporated into conventional<br>
co-injection molded containers that are suitable for food<br>
contents is less than 40% of the total weight of the container.<br>
 Therefore, a need exists in the industry and it is an<br>
object of the present invention to provide a plastic container<br>
having a high recycled content that is suitable for holding<br>
"Carbonated products, such as carbonated beverages, and provide<br>
an acceptable level of performance when compared to commercial<br>
containers formed from alternative materials. A further need<br>
exists for a method to produce such containers in high volume<br>
commercial rates using conventional equipment.<br>
 It is a still further object of the present invention and<br>
need to provide a container based on recycled plastic which has<br>
barrier properties and which minimizes or avoids the high cost<br>
of inconvenience of conventional multi-layer plastic containers.<br>
It is a still further objective to do this at a reasonable cost,<br>
in a commercially feasible process, and with an effective<br>
product.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
 It has been found that the foregoing objects and advantages<br>
are readily obtained in accordance with the present invention.<br>
 Recognizing the problems and concerns associated with<br>
conventional multi-layered plastic containers, especially those<br>
used to hold carbonated beverages, a plastic container having<br>
enhanced gas barrier properties and a high content of recycled<br>
plastic is advantageously provided. A container constructed in<br><br>
accordance with the principles of the present invention provides<br>
several advantages over those previously available. Such<br>
advantages are generally realized through the use of the<br>
desirable recycled plastic and a carbon coating on the internal<br>
surface of the container. It is a significant advantage that<br>
the container of the present invention desirably may have a<br>
significant amount of recycled content. Furthermore, the<br>
improved container can be produced using conventional processing<br>
techniques and manufacturing equipment.<br>
 An important aspect of the present invention is the<br>
effective barrier properties of the present container with the<br>
functional and commercial benefits associated with having a<br>
container comprised a significant amount of recycled plastic<br>
content. Further, the ease in subsequently recycling a<br>
container produced in accordance with the principles of the<br>
present invention make the practice of the invention extremely<br>
advantageous. Moreover, the present invention provides the<br>
additional advantage of permitting the manufacturer to<br>
controllably vary the material positioning and wall thickness at<br>
any given location along the vertical length of the inner and/or<br>
outer layers of the container.<br>
 In accordance with the principles of the present invention,<br>
a blow molded multi-layer container is provided having an upper<br>
wall portion, an intermediate sidewall portion positioned<br>
beneath the upper wall portion, and a base portion positioned<br>
beneath the intermediate sidewall portion, the base portion<br>
being adapted to dependently or independently support the<br>
container. The container includes a molded outer layer formed<br>
from recycled plastic and a carbon coating adjacent and<br>
desirably on the inner surface of the molded outer layer that is<br>
substantially coextensive with the inner layer. The recycled<br>
outer layer comprises at least 40% by weight of recycled<br>
plastic, but can comprise more than 75% by weight and desirably<br>
more than 90% by weight, depending upon the needs of the<br>
application. In a preferred embodiment, the thickness of the<br><br>
outer layer is controllably adjusted along its vertical length.<br>
If desirable, the outer layer may also include additional<br>
barrier materials and/or oxygen scavenging/reacting materials<br>
incorporated therein.<br>
 In accordance with the principles of the present invention,<br>
a blow molded multilayer container is also provided having an<br>
upper wall portion, an intermediate sidewall portion positioned<br>
beneath the upper wall portion, and a base portion positioned<br>
beneath the intermediate sidewall portion, the base portion<br>
being adapted to dependently or independently support the<br>
container. The container includes (i) a molded inner layer<br>
formed from a plastic material, the inner layer having a<br>
vertical length and a carbon-treated inner surface; and (ii) a<br>
molded outer layer formed from recycled plastic that is<br>
substantially coextensive with the inner layer. The recycled<br>
outer layer comprises at least 40% by weight of the overall<br>
weight of the container, but can comprise more than 90% by<br>
weight, depending upon the needs of the application. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the thickness of the inner and/or outer<br>
layers is controllably adjusted along their respective vertical<br>
lengths. If functionally desirable, the inner layer and/or<br>
outer layer may also include additional barrier materials and/or<br>
oxygen scavenging/reacting materials.<br>
 Other and further advantages and novel features of the<br>
invention are readily apparent from the following detailed<br>
description of the best mode for carrying out the invention when<br>
taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein, by<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
 Referring now to the drawings in detail, wherein like<br>
reference numerals and letters designate like elements, there is<br>
shown in FIG. 1 an elevational view of a container 10<br>
constructed in accordance with the principles of the present<br>
invention. Container 10 typically includes an upper wall<br>
portion 12, including an opening 13; an intermediate sidewall<br>
portion 14 positioned beneath the upper wall portion 12; and a<br>
base portion 16 positioned beneath the intermediate sidewall<br>
portion 14. The base portion 16 is adapted to support the<br>
container 10 either dependently, i.e., where another object such<br>
as a base cup (not shown) is used, or independently, i.e., where<br>
no other objects are needed to stand the container upright on a<br>
generally flat surface. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
container 10 is supported by a freestanding base formed by a<br>
plurality of integrally formed feet 18, such as those<br>
illustrated in FIG. 1.<br><br>
 Referring to FIGS. 1A-1C, which represent enlarged detailed<br>
views of areas 1A, 1B and 1C, respectively, of FIG. 1, the<br>
container 10 includes (a) a molded inner layer 20, having a<br>
vertical length and an inner surface 22; (b) a molded outer<br>
layer 24; and (c) a central vertical axis A. The inner surface<br>
22 of the molded inner layer 20 is at least partially coated<br>
with a thin layer or film of carbon 26. While complete<br>
encapsulation of the inner layer 20 by the outer layer 24 is not<br>
required, it is preferred that the molded outer layer 24 is<br>
substantially coextensive with the inner layer 20 and provides<br>
structural support to the walls of the container 10.<br>
 The molded inner layer 20 is comprised of a thermoplastic<br>
material. The following resins may be used as plastic materials<br>
for the inner layer 20: polyethylene resin, polypropylene<br>
resin, polystyrene resin, cycloolefine copolymer resin,<br>
polyethylene terephthalate resin, polyethylene naphthalate<br>
resin, ethylene-(vinyl alcohol) copolymer resin, poly-4-<br>
methylpentene-1 resin, poly (methyl methacrylate) resin,<br>
acrylonitrile resin, polyvinyl chloride resin, polyvinylidene<br>
chloride resin, styrene-acrylo nitrile resin, acrylonitrile-<br>
butadiene-styrene resin, polyamide resin, polyamideimide resin,<br>
polyacetal resin, polycarbonate resin, polybutylene<br>
terephthalate resin, ionomer resin, polysulfone resin, polytetra<br>
fluoroethylene resin and the like. When food product contents<br>
are involved, the inner layer 20 is preferably formed from<br>
virgin polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene<br>
naphthalate (PEN), and/or blends of polyethylene terephthalate<br>
and polyethylene naphthalate. However, other thermoplastic<br>
resins, particularly those approved for contact with food<br>
products, may also be used.<br>
 The molded outer layer 24 is comprised of a recycled<br>
plastic material, including the plastics set forth in the<br>
preceding paragraph, but is commonly formed from recycled<br>
polyethylene terephthalate (PET). However, the invention is not<br><br>
limited to a particular type of recycled plastic and other<br>
recycled plastic materials may be used.<br>
 In a preferred embodiment, the inner layer 20 has a wall<br>
thickness, taken along its vertical length, that is in the range<br>
of 0.5 mil to 5 mil (0.0127 mm to 0.127 mm) and more preferably<br>
between 1 to 2 mils (0.0254 mm to 0.0508 mm). In some<br>
instances, such as where food product contents are involved, a<br>
minimum thickness requirement for the inner layer 20 may be<br>
specified and must be met. As illustrated in FIG. 1 and FIGS.<br>
1A, 1B and 1C, the thickness of the inner layer may be varied<br>
along the vertical length. In this manner, different portions<br>
of the container 10 can have variably controlled thickness along<br>
the vertical length, providing improved material usage and<br>
increased design flexibility. For instance, the thickness of<br>
the inner layer 20 positioned at the upper portion 12 (such as<br>
shown in FIG. 1A) can be thinner than the intermediate sidewall<br>
portion 14 (such as shown in FIG. 1B). Likewise, the thickness<br>
of the inner layer 20 at the base wall portion 16 (such as shown<br>
in FIG. 1C) can be thicker than the thickness of the same layer<br>
in the intermediate sidewall portion 14 (such as shown in FIG.<br>
1B).<br>
 In keeping with an aspect of the present invention, the<br>
inner layer comprises less than 0.60 by weight of the total<br>
weight of the container 10, preferably less than 0.30 of the<br>
total weight of the container 10, and more preferably, less than<br>
about 0.15 of the total weight of the container 10. The ability<br>
of the present invention to utilize an exceptionally thin inner<br>
layer 20 — particularly when compared to other conventional<br>
multi-layer containers — can provide significant economic<br>
advantages and incentives, especially in instances in which<br>
virgin material is more costly and/or scarce than recycled<br>
material.<br>
 As mentioned earlier, the inner surface 22 of the inner<br>
layer 20 is coated with a thin layer of carbon 26 which provides<br>
enhanced barrier properties to the container 10. In a preferred<br><br>
embodiment, the carbon coating 26 is comprised of a highly<br>
hydrogenated amorphous carbon that is doped with nitrogen. The<br>
thickness of the carbon coating 26 is less than about 10 µm and<br>
the weight of the coating 26 is less than about 1/10,000th of the<br>
total weight of the container. An important feature of the<br>
present invention is than only about 3 mg of the carbon coating<br>
26 is needed to treat a 500 cc plastic container. Further,<br>
despite the notable thinness of the carbon coating 26, the<br>
amount of barrier protection afforded is quite significant and<br>
the protection from permeation of oxygen and carbon dioxide is<br>
favorable when compared with the protection found in metal cans<br>
and glass bottles. Initial tests have shown that the barrier<br>
provided in connection with the present invention against oxygen<br>
permeation can be more than thirty times better than that of a<br>
container formed from untreated PET; the barrier provided<br>
against carbon dioxide permeation can be more than seven times<br>
better than that of a container formed from untreated PET; and<br>
the barrier provided against the migration of total aldehydes<br>
can be more than six times better than untreated PET.<br>
 The molded outer layer 24 comprises at least about 0.40 by<br>
weight of the total weight of the container 10, but can comprise<br>
more than 0.90 by weight of the total weight of the container 10<br>
for certain applications. In a preferred embodiment, the outer<br>
layer 24 has a wall thickness, taken along its vertical length,<br>
that is in the range of 6 to 23 mils (0.1524 mm to 0.5842 mm).<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 1 and FIGS. 1A, 1B and 1C, the thickness<br>
of the outer layer can also be separately and independently<br>
varied along its vertical length. In this manner, different<br>
portions of the container 10 (taken perpendicular to the central<br>
vertical axis A) can have different inner layer thicknesses,<br>
different outer layer thicknesses, and/or different overall<br>
thickness measurements, all by design. For instance, the<br>
thickness of the molded outer layer 24 positioned at the upper<br>
portion 12 (such as shown in FIG 1A) can be much thicker than<br>
the intermediate sidewall portion 14 (such as shown in FIG. 1B).<br><br>
Likewise, the thickness of the outer layer 24 at the base wall<br>
portion 16 (such as shown in FIG. 1C) can be thicker than the<br>
thickness of the same layer in the intermediate sidewall portion<br>
14 (such as shown in FIG. 1B). Because the molded outer layer<br>
24 is generally comprised of a less expensive plastic material<br>
that does not directly contact the contents of the container 10,<br>
a less expensive material can be used to form a number of the<br>
structural integral components for the container, such as the<br>
neck flange 30 and outer threads 30 shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 1A.<br>
 While it is often unnecessary — and can complicate the<br>
recycling process — in special applications, the inner layer 20<br>
and/or outer layer 24 may further include additional barrier<br>
materials and/or oxygen scavenging/reacting materials (not<br>
shown) that are commonly known in the art. Examples of some of<br>
the more commonly used barrier materials include saran, ethylene<br>
vinyl alcohol copolymers (EVOH), and acrylonitrile copolymers,<br>
such as Barex. The term saran is used in its normal commercial<br>
sense to contemplate polymers made for example by polymerizing<br>
vinylidene chloride and vinyl chloride or methyl acrylate.<br>
Additional monomers may be included as is well known.<br>
Vinylidene chloride polymers are often the most commonly used,<br>
but other oxygen barrier materials are well known. Oxygen-<br>
scavenging materials can include materials marketed for such a<br>
purpose by several large oil companies and resin manufacturers.<br>
A specific example of such a material is marketed under the<br>
trade name AMOSORB and is commercially available from the Amoco<br>
Corporation.<br>
 Another significant advantage of the present invention is<br>
its ability to provide significant barrier properties,<br>
incorporate a high content of recycled plastic material, and be<br>
advantageous to present day recycling. The inner layer 20 and<br>
outer layer 24 are both comprised of plastic material and can be<br>
readily recycled. Unlike a number of other barrier materials<br>
often used in connection with multi-layer containers, which can<br>
be difficult to separate, the carbon coating 26 of the present<br><br>
invention has no impact on the recycling of the plastic<br>
materials of which the container 10 is comprised.<br>
 The present invention includes the additional advantage of<br>
being able to provide a container 10 with enhanced barrier<br>
properties that can be used for holding food products. Plastic<br>
containers having an inner surface treated with an amorphous<br>
carbon film have been approved for contact with food products<br>
from the Technische National Onderzoek, the standards<br>
organization accredited by the European Economic Community. The<br>
approval of the United States Food and Drug Administration<br>
(USFDA) is currently in process.<br>
 The container 10 of the present invention may be formed by<br>
any of several known processing techniques which permit the<br>
manufacture of a multi-layer blow molded container 10 having a<br>
plastic molded inner layer 20 and a relatively thick molded<br>
outer layer 24 of recycled plastic. In a preferred embodiment,<br>
the multi-layer container 10 is formed via a blow molding<br>
operation involving a multi-layer preform 34, such as the one<br>
generally depicted in FIG. 2. Although not a required feature,<br>
the preform 34 may include a neck flange 30 (for handling<br>
purposes) and outer threads 32 (to secure a closure) that<br>
correspond to the same features shown in FIG. 1. After the blow<br>
molding of the container 10, as shown in FIG. 1, but some time<br>
before the filling operation, the inner surface 22 of the inner<br>
layer 20 of the container 10 is carbon-treated as further<br>
discussed below.<br>
 In a first preferred embodiment, as shown in FIG. 2, the<br>
preform 34 is produced by extrusion molding an inner layer 20'<br>
having an inner surface 22' thereof and injection molding an<br>
outer layer 24'. The inner layer 20' and outer layer 24' of the<br>
preform 34 correspond to the inner layer 20 and outer layer 24<br>
of the container 10. Extrusion of the inner layer 20' of the<br>
preform allows the manufacturer to produce a thinner layer than<br>
is generally possible using conventional injection molding or<br>
co-injection processes. For example, the inner layer of an<br><br>
extrusion molded multi-layer preform 34 may be made as thin as<br>
15-20 mils (.381 mm to 0.508 mm) or less. Conversely, it is<br>
difficult, if not impossible, to reliably injection mold an<br>
inner layer having a comparable thickness profile. Further, an<br>
extrusion or co-extrusion process permits the manufacturer to<br>
readily vary the thickness of material being extruded along the<br>
length of the extrudate. Variations in the thickness of the<br>
inner layer is desirable for several reasons which include<br>
aesthetics, efficient material use and reduced costs, and<br>
variable strength requirements.<br>
 The outer layer 24' of the preform 34 is formed from a<br>
recycled plastic material and, in accordance with the present<br>
invention, is substantially thicker than the inner layer 20'.<br>
The outer layer 24' can be injection molded or compression<br>
molded over the inner layer 20', although injection molding is<br>
generally preferred. Such over-molding processes further permit<br>
the formation of a neck flange 30 and outer threads 32.<br>
 In a second preferred embodiment, the multi-layer preform<br>
34 is produced by thermoforming a thin sheet of plastic material<br>
and forming that sheet into what will become the inner layer 20'<br>
having an inner surface 22' thereof of the preform 34. The<br>
process of thermoforming permits the formation of a preform 34<br>
with a very thin inner layer 20'. In fact, minimum wall<br>
thicknesses of 3 mil (0.0762 mm) or less are possible. As in<br>
the case of an extruded inner layer 20', once the inner layer<br>
20' of the preform 34 is formed, the outer layer 24' of recycled<br>
plastic can be injection or compression molded over the inner<br>
layer 20' to provide a multi-layer preform 34. FIG. 3 is a<br>
representative example of a preform 34 formed with a<br>
thermoformed inner layer 20' and injection molded outer layer<br>
24'. Preforms 34 formed in accordance with the principles of<br>
such second preferred embodiment are generally better suited for<br>
applications that require a wider opening 13 or dispensing<br>
mouth.<br><br>
 The multi-layer container can then be blown using<br>
conventional blow molding operations. Because the preform 34<br>
will be stretched and "thinned-out" during the subsequent blow<br>
molding process, the thickness of the preform 34 — at portions<br>
corresponding to like portions of the blown container — will<br>
inherently be somewhat thicker. In fact, the thickness of the<br>
various portions of the preform 34 are typically designed to<br>
take into account the amount of stretch and hoop expansion<br>
necessary to form the thickness profile desired in the final<br>
container 10. For clarity, hereinafter, the multi-layer<br>
containers having inner and outer layers 20, 24 that have not<br>
been carbon-treated should be distinguished from containers 10<br>
in which the inner surface 22 has been carbon coated.<br>
 After a container having an inner layer 20 and outer layer<br>
24 are produced, a carbon coating is formed on at least a<br>
portion of the inner surface 22 of the inner layer 20. The<br>
carbon coating 26 does not have to be immediately applied to the<br>
container, however, it is generally more efficient to apply the<br>
coating 26 promptly after the container has been blown and is<br>
within an appropriate temperature profile.<br>
 In a preferred embodiment, the blown multi-layer containers<br>
are removed from a conventional high-speed rotary blow-molding<br>
machine and subsequently transferred, directly or indirectly<br>
(i.e., via an intermediate handling step), to an apparatus for<br>
applying a carbon coating 26 to the containers. In high-speed<br>
production applications, the carbon-coating apparatus will<br>
typically also be of the rotary type. An example of such an<br>
apparatus that can be used to apply the carbon coating to the<br>
inner surface 22 of the container 10 is available from Sidel of<br>
Le Havre, France and is commercially marketed under the "ACTIS"<br>
trade name.<br>
 A method for carbon-coating multi-layer containers 10 is<br>
next described in further detail. In accordance with a<br>
preferred method for carbon coating the inner surface 22 of the<br>
container 10, a conventional carbon-coating or carbon-treating<br><br>
apparatus having rotary kinematics and a central vertical axis<br>
is provided. The carbon-coating apparatus generally rotates<br>
about its central vertical axis in a first rotational direction,<br>
e.g., counterclockwise, at a fairly high rotational speed. A<br>
blow-molding machine, or other rotary container transfer<br>
mechanism, located generally in close proximity to the carbon-<br>
coating apparatus functions as the source of containers for<br>
subsequent carbon-coating treatment. To facilitate the<br>
transfer, the rotary container transfer mechanism rotates in a<br>
direction opposed to the rotational direction of the carbon-<br>
coating apparatus — e.g., clockwise — and the multi-layer<br>
containers 10 are mechanically shifted from the container<br>
transfer mechanism to the carbon-coating apparatus. Although<br>
not required for the practice of the present invention, the<br>
container 10 preferably includes a neck flange 30 or other<br>
physical means for at least partially supporting the container<br>
10 during the mechanical transfer process.<br>
 As the containers 10 are transferred from the transfer<br>
mechanism to the carbon-coating apparatus, the containers 10 are<br>
preferably held by the upper portion 12 in an upright<br>
orientation with the opening 13 generally facing upwardly. If<br>
desired, a vacuum can also be generated and used to support or<br>
partially support the container 10. During the transfer<br>
process, the individual containers 10 are received by a<br>
receiving mechanism which is part of the carbon-coating<br>
apparatus. The receiving mechanism revolves around the central<br>
axis of the carbon-coating apparatus, grasps or secures the<br>
container, and seals the opening 13 of the upper portion 12 of<br>
the container, much like a lid. When properly positioned over<br>
and abutting the opening 13, the receiving mechanism produces a<br>
tight to "airtight" seal over the container.<br>
 The receiving mechanism includes at least two apertures<br>
positioned above the opening 13 of the container that are used<br>
for the introduction and removal of gases from the inside of the<br>
container. A first aperture in the receiving mechanism is in<br><br>
communication with a vacuum source, such as a vacuum pump.<br>
After the receiving mechanism has securely sealed the opening<br>
13, the air within the container is discharged through the first<br>
aperture by means of a vacuum. It is desirable that degree of<br>
vacuum falls within a range of about 10-2 to 10-5 torr, so as to<br>
shorten the discharge time for a vacuum and saves necessary<br>
energy therefor. With a lower degree of vacuum of over 10-2<br>
torr, impurities in the container are much increased, on the<br>
other hand, with a higher degree of vacuum under 10"5 torr,<br>
increased time and a large energy are needed to discharge the<br>
air in the container.<br>
 Once the air inside the container has been evacuated, the<br>
container is subsequently filled or "charged" with a raw gas<br>
that will be used in the formation of the carbon coating 26.<br>
The flow rate of the raw gas is preferably within a range from<br>
about 1 to 100 ml/min. Preferably, the diffusion of the raw gas<br>
within the container is enhanced by providing an extension, such<br>
as a tube having a plurality of blow openings. In accordance<br>
with one embodiment, an extension enters inside of the container<br>
10' through the second aperture some time after the opening 13<br>
is sealed and the extension extends to within about 25.4 mm to<br>
50.8 mm (1.0 in. - 2.0 in.) of the lowermost portion of the<br>
container.<br>
 The raw gas may be comprised of aliphatic hydrocarbons,<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons, oxygen containing hydrocarbons, nitrogen<br>
containing hydrocarbons, etc., in gaseous or liquid state at a<br>
room temperature. Benzene, toluene, o-xylene, m-xylene, p-<br>
xylene and cyclohexane each having six or more than six carbons<br>
are preferable. The raw gases may be used singularly, but a<br>
mixture of two or more than two kinds of raw gases can also be<br>
used. Moreover, the raw gases may be used in the state of<br>
dilution with inert gas such as argon and helium.<br>
 At some point after the container has been received by the<br>
receiving mechanism of the carbon-coating apparatus, the<br>
container is inserted into a cylinder or other hollow space<br><br>
provided to accommodate the container. In the preferred<br>
embodiment, the carbon-coating apparatus includes a plurality of<br>
hollow cylinders that rotate in the same direction as, and in<br>
synchronization with, the receiving mechanism. It is further<br>
preferred that the receiving mechanism that retains and seals<br>
the opening 13 of the container also functions to cover the<br>
cylinder.<br>
 After the supply of the raw gas into the container, energy<br>
is impressed upon the container from a high frequency electric<br>
energy source, such as a microwave-producing device. The<br>
impression of the electric power generates plasma, and causes<br>
extreme molecular excitation ionization and a carbon coating 26<br>
to be formed on the inner surface 22 of the container.<br>
 While the foregoing method illustrates one process for<br>
forming a carbon coating 26 on the inner surface 22 of a<br>
container, other conventional methods can also be used<br>
successfully. For instance, the plastic container could instead<br>
be inserted and accommodated within an external electrode and<br>
have an internal electrode positioned within the container.<br>
After the container is evacuated and is charged with raw gas<br>
supplied through the internal electrode, electric power is<br>
supplied from the high frequency electric source to the external<br>
electrode. The supply of electric power generates plasma<br>
between the external electrode and the internal electrode.<br>
Because the internal electrode is earthed, and the external<br>
electrode is insulated by the insulating member, a negative<br>
self-bias is generated on the external electrode, so that carbon<br>
film is formed uniformly on the inner surface of the container<br>
along the external electrode.<br>
 When the plasma is generated between the external electrode<br>
and the internal electrode, electrons are accumulated on the<br>
inner surface of the insulated external electrode to electrify<br>
negatively the external electrode, to generate negative self-<br>
bias on the external electrode. At the external electrode, a<br>
voltage drop occurs because of the accumulated electrons. At<br><br>
this time, carbon dioxide as the carbon resource exists in the<br>
plasma, and positively ionized carbon resource gas is<br>
selectively collided with the inner surface 22 of the container<br>
which is disposed along the external electrode, and, then,<br>
carbons close to each other are bonded together thereby to form<br>
hard carbon film comprising remarkably dense coating on the<br>
inner surface 22 of the container.<br>
 The thickness and uniformity of the carbon coating 26 can<br>
be varied by adjusting the output of high frequency; the<br>
pressure of the raw gas in the container; the flow rate for<br>
charging the container with gas; the period of time during which<br>
plasma is generated; the self-bias and kind of raw materials<br>
used; and other like variables. However, the thickness of the<br>
carbon coating 26 is preferably within a range from 0.05 to 10<br>
µm to obtain the effective suppression of the permeation and/or<br>
absorption of the low molecular organic compound and the<br>
improved gas barrier property, in addition to an excellent<br>
adhesion to plastic, a good durability and a good transparency.<br>
 FIG. 4 shows an elevational view of a further embodiment of<br>
a container 100 constructed in accordance with the principles of<br>
the present invention. Container 100 typically includes an<br>
upper wall portion 112, including an opening 113; an<br>
intermediate sidewall portion 114 positioning beneath the upper<br>
wall portion 112; and a base portion 116 positioned beneath the<br>
intermediate sidewall portion 114. The base portion 116 is<br>
adapted to support the container 100 either dependently, i.e.,<br>
where another object such as a base cup (not shown) is used, or<br>
independently, i.e., where no other objects are needed to stand<br>
the container upright on a generally flat surface. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the container 100 is supported by a<br>
freestanding base formed by a plurality of integrally formed<br>
feet 118, such as those illustrated in FIG. 4.<br>
 Referring to FIGS. 5-7, which represent enlarged detailed<br>
views of areas 100A, 100B and 100C, respectively, of FIG. 4, the<br>
container 100 includes a molded outer layer 120, having a<br><br>
vertical length, an inner surface 122, an outer surface 123 and<br>
a central vertical axis B. The inner surface 122 of the molded<br>
outer layer 120 is at least partially coated with a thin layer<br>
or film of carbon 124 as in the embodiments of FIGS. 1-3. While<br>
complete encapsulation of the inner layer 120 by the carbon<br>
layer 124 is preferred, it may not be required for particular<br>
applications. It is preferred that the molded outer layer 120<br>
is substantially coextensive with the carbon layer 124 and<br>
provide structural support for the container 100.<br>
 The molded outer layer 120 includes at least 50% of<br>
recycled plastic material, desirably at least 75% of recycled<br>
plastic, and may include as much as 90% recycled plastic<br>
material. If desired, the molded outer layer may be 100%<br>
recycled plastic material. Preferably, the molded outer layer<br>
is formed from recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET), but<br>
the present invention is not limited thereto and virtually any<br>
recycled plastic may be conveniently employed.<br>
 The molded outer layer 120 is desirably comprised of a<br>
thermoplastic material and may utilize the materials listed for<br>
the molded inner layer 20 of FIG. 1.<br>
 It is particularly desirable to blend small amounts of<br>
barrier materials and/or oxygen scavenging or reacting materials<br>
with the recycled plastic as discussed with respect to FIG. 1.<br>
For example, less than 5% by weight of saran, ethylene vinyl<br>
alcohol copolymers (EVOH) and acrylonitrile copolymers, such as<br>
Barex. In addition, the present invention can readily use ultra<br>
low intrinsic viscosity (IV) material, e.g., material having an<br>
IV of less than around 0.60 or 0.55. These materials are<br>
frequently white or whitish in color. A significant advantage<br>
of the present invention is ability to process in-process scrap<br>
simply and efficiently, even with materials as aforesaid.<br>
 The inner surface 122 of the outer layer 120 is coated with<br>
a thin layer of carbon 124 which provides enhanced barrier<br>
properties to the container 100. Features of, characteristics<br>
of and preparation of the carbon coating 124 has been described<br><br>
above with respect to FIG. 1 and this applies also to the<br>
embodiments of FIGS. 4-7.<br>
 The molded outer layer 120 has a wall thickness, taken<br>
along its vertical length, that is in the range of 6 to 23 mils<br>
(0.1524 mm to 0.5842 mm). As illustrated in FIGS. 5-7, the<br>
thickness of the outer layer can also be separately and<br>
independently varied along its vertical length, as with outer<br>
layer 24 of FIG. 1. In the same manner as outer layer 24 of<br>
FIG. 1, because the molded outer layer 120 is generally<br>
comprised of a less expensive plastic material that does not<br>
directly contact the contents of the container 100, a less<br>
expensive material can be used to form the bulk of the container<br>
including a number of the structural integral components for the<br>
container, such as the neck flange 126 and outer threads 128<br>
shown in FIG. 4.<br>
 Similarly, the inner carbon coating can be readily varied<br>
so that the thickness thereof varies along the vertical length<br>
of the container. Desirably, however, for convenience a<br>
substantially uniform carbon coating is provided.<br>
 The embodiments of FIGS. 4-7 offer the significant<br>
advantages of the present invention described with respect to<br>
FIGS. 1-3.<br>
 The container of FIGS. 4-7 may be formed by any of several<br>
known processing techniques which permit the manufacture of a<br>
single layer or multi-layer blow molded container as described<br>
for FIG. 1. In a preferred embodiment, the container 100 is<br>
formed via a blow molding operation involving a preform 130,<br>
such as the one generally depicted in FIG. 8. Although not a<br>
required feature, the preform 130 may include a neck flange 132<br>
(for handling purposes) and outer threads 134 (to secure a<br>
closure) that corresponds to the same features shown in FIG. 4.<br>
After the blow molding of the container to form the final<br>
container 100 an embodiment of which is shown in FIG. 4, but<br>
some time before the filling operation, the inner surface 122 of<br>
the container is carbon-treated as further discussed above.<br><br>
 In one embodiment shown in FIG. 9, a preform 140 which will<br>
become the container is produced by extrusion molding a preform<br>
140 with a preform body 146 and a preform base 148, neck flange<br>
142 and outer threads 144. An extrusion process permits the<br>
manufacturer to readily vary the thickness of material being<br>
extruded along the length of the extrudate. Variations in the<br>
thickness of the preform is desirable for several reasons which<br>
include aesthetics, efficient material use and reduced costs,<br>
and variable strength requirements.<br>
 The preform 140 includes recycled plastic material which,<br>
as indicated hereinabove is a particular advantage of the<br>
present invention.<br>
 In the embodiment of FIG. 8, a preform 130 is produced by<br>
thermoforming a thin sheet of plastic material and forming that<br>
sheet into what will become the preform 130, or injection or<br>
compression molding the preform 130. Thus, preform 130 of FIG.<br>
8 may include a neck flange 132 and outer threads 134, body<br>
portion 136 which will become the container body portion and<br>
base portion 138 which will become the container base portion.<br>
 The container can then be blown using conventional blow<br>
molding operations as described above.<br>
 After the preform has been formed into an intermediate<br>
container by blow molding, a carbon coating is formed on at<br>
least a portion of the inner surface 122 of the container 120<br>
and preferably on the entire inner surface, as described above<br>
for FIG. 1. The carbon coating 124 does not have to be<br>
immediately applied to the container, however, it is generally<br>
more efficient to apply the carbon coating promptly after the<br>
intermediate container has been blown and is within an<br>
appropriate temperature profile.<br>
 The container of FIG. 4 offers significant advantages in<br>
addition to those of FIG. 1. The base container is a mono-layer<br>
material that can be readily processed by conventional means.<br>
Moreover, the recycled base material can be readily admixed with<br>
other materials and due to the inner carbon coating does not<br><br>
contact the container contents. Moreover, barrier properties<br>
are readily and easily obtained and the container contents are<br>
not impacted by adverse aromas or taste. Further, the container<br>
of the present invention eliminates the need for a separate<br>
barrier liner or a virgin liner. The small amount of inner<br>
carbon coating dos not adversely affect recycling, and colored<br>
materials can be readily used to provide a desirably colored<br>
container, for example, the outer layer can be easily colored in<br>
a desirable commercial color.<br>
 The container of FIG. 4 offers the significant advantages<br>
of a mono-layer container with desirable engineered properties,<br>
as barrier resistance and low cost. Thus, processing is<br>
significantly easier than with multi-layer containers since one<br>
is working with a mono-layer material without the necessity for<br>
the use of liners and complicated coinjection processing.<br>
Further, one can blend the recycled plastic with other materials<br>
to readily obtain special properties while still retaining the<br>
use of desirably low cost recycled plastic. For example, one<br>
could customize the product in order to obtain desirable<br>
characteristics while still using recycled material and a mono-<br>
layer material.<br>
 The internal carbon coating is simply and conveniently<br>
applied and is quite thin and yet precludes the migration of<br>
adverse flavors and taste into the contents of the container.<br>
It is particularly desirable to use a variety of colors for the<br>
recycled plastic as for example an amber color for beer. It<br>
would be highly desirable to use such a container as in the<br>
present invention with a tailored color and for a beer or soft<br>
drink or juice product. As a still further alternative, one<br>
could blend heat resistant plastic with the recycled plastic to<br>
obtain highly desirable characteristics.<br>
 Although certain preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention have been described, the invention is not limited to<br>
the illustrations described and shown herein, which are deemed<br>
to be merely illustrative of the best modes of carrying out the<br><br>
invention. A person or ordinary skill in the art will realize<br>
that certain alternatives, modifications, and variations will<br>
come within the teachings of this invention and that such<br>
