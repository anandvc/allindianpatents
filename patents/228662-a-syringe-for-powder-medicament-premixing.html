ZHONGSHAN	BOTAI	PHARMACEUTIC<br>
INSTRUMENTS CO., LTD., A CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF CHINA, WHOSE ADDRESS IS ROOM 107, NO. 8, KANGLE AVENUE, TORCH DEVELOPMENT ZONE, ZHONGSHAN CITY, GUANGDONG PROVINCE, PR. CHINA, 528437.<br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to syringes in the field of medicine, especially to an assembled syringe for administering powder medicament. According to the present invention, by using a connecting tube, a solvent bottle contained with diluent is communicated with a solute bottle contained with powder by the external force, and the diluent is injected into the solute bottle through the connecting tube under the effect of the pressure. After the powder is dissolved and mixed uniformly, the mixed solution is injected directly into a patient or added to a transfusion bottle or a transfusion tube. Both the solvent bottle and the solute bottle are packaged into a sleeve to avoid contamination or cross-infection. Buckles provided on the plunger sleeve are fitted into restricting slots on the sleeve. The fitting of the restricting slots and buckles allows the syringe to have the function of restricting the position, self-locking, controlling the magnitude of the force by which the solute bottle is communicated with the solvent bottle, and being convenient for controlling the depth of the needle into the body, and to prevent misoperation or damage during transports, fetching and using. The present invention is a novel design with industrial applicability and inventive step and is adapted to be applied and generalized widely in the industries.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Conventionally, in medical applications, syringes, vials and diluents are separately provided. When a nurse is preparing for injecting powder medicament, such as penicillin, into the body of a patient, she has to draw out the diluent with a syringe and  pierce the needle of the syringe into the vial containing the powder<br>
2<br><br>
medicament at first, then she has to inject the diluent contained in the syringe into the vial to dissolve the powder, and then draw the diluent dissolved with powder into the syringe again before administering to the patient or adding to a transfusion bottle or transfusion tube for bolus intravenous injection. The whole operation involves various medical components and the process is complicated. Contamination to the syringe and mishandling of the medicament tend to happen. Such syringes must be handled with great care and skill, which may put a nurse operating with the syringe under great stress.<br>
A Chinese patent application entitled "Vial Type Pressurized Syringe for Powder Medicament" filed by some of the present inventors discloses a syringe structure by puncturing a inner bladder of a vial containing the powder medicament by a needle provided on the front end of a plunger to uniformly mix the powder medicament under pressure with a diluent contained in a solute bottle before injection. This syringe structure is advantageous by its simplified structure but the following defects have been found during its use:<br>
1.	The inner bladder and the solute bottle are not provided with protective jackets and the inner ends of the inner bladder and the solute bottle are not provided with seal stoppers. The needle is not provided with a sheath. Cotamination or cross-infection tends to happen due to poor sealing.<br>
2.	When a nurse is operating with the syringe, it is found to be unpractical because it is very difficult for him/her to control the force applied to the plunger and the depth of injection of the needle.<br><br>
3. The distance between the inner bladder and the solute bottle are so short thus making them poorly engaged with each other, and may sway or even be damaged due to disengagement with each other or unintended communication during transportation, handling or operation.<br>
From the above it can be known that conventional syringes are not practical because they are subject to contamination or cross-infection and are inconvenient during use.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a syringe for premixing and administering powder medicament with novel design to overcome the problem of existing syringes which are prone to contamination and cross-infection. The syringe according to the present invention is more practical and cost effective with considerable industrial applicability.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a syringe for premixing and administering powder medicament with novel design to overcome the problem of existing syringes which are difficult to operate and control. The syringe according to the present invention is easy to operate with traveling distance limitations to the needle, making the force applied to the plunger and injection depth of the needle easy to control.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a syringe for premixing and administering powder medicament to overcome the problem of loose fitting<br>
4<br><br>
between the inner bladder and the solute bottle prone to cause damage during transportation and handling by providing a locking configuration.<br>
It is still yet another object of the present invention to provide a syringe for premixing and administering powder medicament to overcome the problem of return flow of the mixed medicament and the returning to the original position of the bracket after moving due to the pressure generated after the bracket being pulled out.<br>
The above and other objects of the present invention and the settlement of the technical problems are achieved by the following technical solutions. A syringe for power medicament premixing according the present invention comprises a plunger, a sleeve, a solvent bottle, a connecting tube, a solute bottle and a syringe needle with two piercing ends, in which the plunger is provided on the upper portion of the sleeve and the solvent bottle.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Advantages and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
Embodiment 1<br>
FIG. 10 and 11 show a syringe for premixing and administering powder medicament according to the present invention. The syringe basically comprises a plunger 1, a cylindrical sleeve 5, a solvent bottle 8, a connecting tube 14, a solute bottle 10 and a syringe needle 16 having two piercing ends. The solvent bottle 8 containing a diluent 18 is not pressurized and is under normal pressure. The plunger 1 is provided above the sleeve 5 and the solvent bottle 8. Both the solvent bottle 8 and the solute bottle 10 are packaged inside the sleeve 5. The solvent bottle 8 is positioned on the solute bottle 10 and is partially inserted and slidably fitted into the solute bottle 10. The lower end of the solute bottle is connected with the syringe needle 16.<br>
Two restricting slots 4 are formed on the sleeve 5 symmetrical to the central axis of the sleeve 5. The restricting slots 4 comprise two "L"-shaped right angle portions<br>
12<br><br>
communicating with each other. The longer section of a first "L"-shaped portion of the restricting slots is long enough to allow the needle-like connecting tube 14 to pierce through a sealing plug 12 and a piston 9. The longer section of the second "L"-shape portion of the restricting slots facilitates a nurse to control the piercing depth of the needle. The shorter sections of the first and the second "L"-shaped portion of the restricting slots are designed for self-locking, that is, a plunger sleeve 2 integrated with the plunger 1 is provided with two symmetrically arranged buckles 3, which are inserted into the shorter sections of the "L"-shaped portions of the restricting slots 4 and are fitted with the restricting slots 4 in a slidable fashion to achieve self-locking. The buckles 3 are located inside the shorter section of the upper end of the restricting slot 4 to keep it in a self-locking status before use. A viewing port 6 is longitudinally provided on the sleeve 5 to observe the mixing of the powder with the diluent. The viewing port 6 can be configured longer as shown by the dashed lines in FIG 10 to observe the connecting tube 14 piercing through the sealing plug 12 and the piston 9.<br>
A piston 17 is provided inside the solvent bottle 8 at the upper end and is located under the plunger 1. The hollow connecting tube 14 with two piercing ends is provided between the solvent bottle 8 and the solute bottle 10. One end of the connection tube 14 is fixated on a bracket 13 located on the lower end of the solvent bottle 8. Two protrusions 25 are formed on two inner sides of the bracket 13. Protrusions 25 are in contact with the bottom opening of the solvent bottle 8. The bottom opening of the solvent bottle 8 and the solute bottle 10 are provided respectively with sealing plugs 12 and 15 made of surgical rubber or innoxious<br>
13<br><br>
rubber. Guiding recesses 26 and 29 are formed on the central portions of the sealing plugs 12 and 15 respectively. The piston 9 is provided inside the solute bottle 10 and is located under the solvent bottle 8. One end of the syringe needle 16 is fixated to the bracket 11 plugged into the lower end of the solute bottle 10. Two protrusions 28 are formed on the two inner sides of the bracket 11. The protrusions 28 are in contact with the bottom opening of the solute bottle 10. The protrusions 25 and 28 are in the form of protruding nipples. The protecting jacket 7 covers the sealing plug 15, the bracket 11 and the syringe needle 16.<br>
When in use, the plunger 1 is rotated to make the buckle 3 locate on the upper end of the restricting slot 4, then the plunger 1 is pressed by hand until the buckle 3 moves alone the restricting slot 4 to the lower end of the first portion, then the solvent bottle 8 is applied with pressure through the plunger sleeve 2, so that the needle-like connecting tube 14 fixated on the bracket 13 will pierce through the sealing plug 12 and the piston 9 when the connecting tube 14 is moving with the bracket 13. Now the solvent bottle 8 and the solute bottle 10 are communicated with each other via the connecting tube 14. The diluent will enter the solute bottle to dissolve and mix the powder medicament uniformly under the pressure inside the solvent bottle 8 generated by pressing the plunger 1 The protecting jacket 7 is then removed and the syringe needle 16 is injected into the muscle of a patient, or a transfusion bottle or a transfusion tube. The plunger 1 is rotated again so that the buckles 3 enter the second portion of the restricting slot 4. Then the plunger 1 is pushed again to make the piston 9 move downwardly so that the mixed medicament is forced into the muscle of a patient or a transfusion bottle or a<br>
14<br><br>
transfusion tube through the syringe needle 16 to finish a complete operation. Because the syringe needle 16 is fixated to the bracket 11, the bracket 11 will move upwardly to make the syringe needle 16 pierce through the sealing plug 15 of the solute bottle 10 when the syringe needle 16 is injected into the muscle or the transfusion bottom, thus the mixed medicament may enter a human body or the transfusion bottle or tube.<br>
The solvent bottle 8 and the solute bottle 10 are integrated inside the sleeve 5 to form an assembly. The assembly can be used only for one time and should be discarded after use. In fact it is a self-destructive syringe. It is very safe and the problem of cross-contamination can be avoided.<br>

Two slots corresponding to the positions of the tongues 24 are arranged on the two sides of the upper edge of the plunger sleeve 2 and symmetrical to the axis thereof. The tongues 24 are inserted into the slots 22 respectively. The cross-section of the sleeve is of round shape.<br>
During the preparation of the present embodiment, the solute bottle 10 contained with powder medicament 20 and the solvent bottle 8 contained with diluent 18 are packaged into the sleeve 5 in advance. In the initial state, the buckle 3 is located on the upper end of the first restricting slot 21, i.e. position A, as shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3.<br>
When performing an injection, push the plunger 1 slightly to make the buckle 3 rotated into the first restricting slot 21. Then push the plunger 1 to make the solvent bottle 8 move along the inner sleeve 19 by pushing the plunger sleeve 2 until the buckle 3 reach to the end of the first restricting slot, i.e. position B. At this time, the tongue 24 is inserted into the slot 22 of the inner sleeve 19, as shown in FIG. 4. During this process, due to the effect of pressure, the connecting tube 14 having two piercing ends will pierce through the piston 9 and the sealing plug 12 so that solvent bottle 8 is communicated with the solute bottle 10. The diluent 18 inside the solvent bottle 8 will be automatically injected into the solute bottle 10<br>
18<br><br>
through the connecting tube 14 by the effect of inner pressure to dissolve powder medicament 20. At the same time, the bracket 13 moves along the bottom opening of the solvent bottle 8 until its end face is in contact with the sealing plug 12, as shown in FIG. 8. During this process, the inner sleeve 19 and the piston 9 moves relatively to each other and the syringe needle 16 having two piercing ends does not piercing through the sealing plug 15 yet.<br>
After the above process, the plunger 1 is pulled up and rotated to make the buckle 3 reach to the upper end of the second restricting slot 23 through the connecting portion between the first and the second restricting slot 21 and 23, i.e. position C. During this operation, the tongue 24 is detached from the slot 22 and the tongue 24 is moved to the upper edge of the slot 22. At the same time, because the plunger 1 is pulled up and the solvent bottle 8 and the bracket 13 are moved upwardly, the lower end of the connecting 14 is drawn out from the piston 9 to disconnect the communication between the solvent bottle 8 and the solute bottle<br>
10	to avoid backflow of liquid medicament due to overpressure inside the solute<br>
bottle 10.<br>
The next step is to inject to a human body or administer to a transfusion bottle or tube. When the syringe needle 16 is injected into the human body or the transfusion bottle or tube, the counterforce is strong enough to make the bracket<br>
11	slipping along the bottom opening of the solute bottle until the end face of the<br>
bracket 11 is in contact with the sealing plug 15, as shown in FIG. 9. At this time,<br>
the syringe needle 16 has pierced through the sealing plug 15 and the buckle 3<br>
I9<br><br>
moves along the second restricting 23 and down to the bottom end thereof, i.e. position D. By the force applied on the upper edge of the inner sleeve 19 by tongue 24 of the plunger sleeve 2, the end face of the inner sleeve 19 is pressed against the piston 9 to make the liquid medicament injected into the human body or the transfusion bottle or tube via the syringe needle 16, thus to complete the process of injection.<br>
Because protrusions 25 and 28 are arranged inside the bracket 13 and 11, when the end faces of the bracket 13 and the bracket 11 are in contact with the sealing plug 12 and 15 respectively, the protrusions 25 and 28 are positioned to the step at the bottom opening of the solvent bottle 8 and the solute bottle 10 and are locked thereto, therefore the bracket 13 and 11 will not move back to their original positions when the plunge 1 is pulled up or when the syringe needle is drawn out from the human body, ensuring the proper operation and self-destruction for one-time use of the syringe according to the present invention.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
The present invention has apparent advantages and benefits. It can be know from the above description that the present invention does not have the defects of the existing syringe. The structure of the present invention is more robust and variable for use. The present invention has the following advantages:<br>
1. The syringe for medicament powder premixing according to the present invention has the following advantages by integrating the solute bottle contained with medicament powder to the syringe needle with two piercing ends: simple<br>
20<br><br>
structure, easy operation, time saving, improved work efficiency, reduced intensity of work, and significantly lowered cost. At the same time, a nurse operating with the syringe according to the present invention can be released from the stress, because mis-operation and mistakes can be avoided by using the syringe.<br>
2.	The syringe for medicament powder premixing according to the present invention has a relatively simple structure and low additional production cost, because it can be achieved by slightly changing the structure of existing syringe. It is worthwhile comparing the added production cost with its great benefit. Therefore it has great industrial applicability.<br>
3.	The syringe for medicament powder premixing according to the present invention is simple in structure. By the fitting of the restricting slots provided on the sleeve with the buckles provided on the plunger sleeve, it is has both position-limiting function and locking function. Thus, it is easy to control the force applied to the plunge when the bottles are communicated and to manage the depth of injection . The solute bottle and the solvent bottle are fixated to avoid loosening by engaging the buckles on the sleeve with the restricting slots on the plunger sleeve. Therefore, misoperation or damage during transportation and handling can be avoided. The syringe according to the present invention is more practical and meets the requirements of the normal syringe products. It provides more preferred choice to users and can improve the overall benefits dramatically.<br>
Both the solute bottle and the solvent bottle of the syringe for medicament powder according to the present invention are packaged inside the sleeve with sealing<br>
21<br><br>
plug and protecting jacket. The medicament powder and the diluent of predetermined dosage are contained in advance during production of the syringe. Therefore contamination and cross-infection can be avoided due to high degree of asepsis. The whole syringe is in an aseptic package and will not be in contact with air during operation. The syringe according to the present invention can be used for only one time and cannot be used again.<br>
The syringe for medicament powder premixing according to the present invention is provided with slots on both the plunger sleeve and the inner sleeve, and with the sliding construction of the bracket along the opening of the bottle. When the connecting tube is pulled out after the solvent bottle and the solute bottle is connected, such construction can ensure that the medicament inside the solute bottle will not flow back and the bracket will not return to the original position after moving, so that such construction has a self-destruction function and can be used only for one time.<br>
Having thus described several embodiments of this invention, it is to be appreciated various alterations, modifications, and improvements will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Such alterations, modifications, and improvements are intended to be part of this disclosure, and are intended to be within the spirit and scope of the invention.
