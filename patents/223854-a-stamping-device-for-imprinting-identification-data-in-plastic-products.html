				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a stamping device for stamping identification<br>
data, especially in the form of code numerals, in plastic products such as<br>
containers which have been produced preferably by a blow-fill-seal process.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Processes and molding devices for production of containers have been disclosed<br>
in the prior art (DE 199 26 329 Al). A tube of plasticized plastic material is<br>
extruded into a molding device. One end of the tube is closed by welding. A<br>
pneumatic pressure gradient acting on the hose is generated to expand the hose<br>
and is applied for the purpose of forming the container on a shaping wall of the<br>
molding device consisting of two form tools positioned opposite each other. A<br>
suitable filling mandrel is then used to fill the plastic container under sterile<br>
conditions. After the filling mandrel has been removed, the container is<br>
hermetically sealed with a definable head geometry being formed. Two container<br>
shaping jaws are moved toward each other by hydraulic or electromotive drive<br>
means to obtain a closed position and away from each other and Into an open<br>
position to obtain the plastic container itself in which fluid is subsequently stored.<br>
The head geometries generated by the two separately controlled jaws also<br>
generally include the neck element of the plastic container, including one in the<br>
form of an ampule. The ampule is closed by a head piece and may be opened at<br>
a separation point for removal of fluid after the head piece has been separated<br>
by a toggle element molded on it over the separation point, and thus, removed<br>
from the plastic container proper.<br>
Processes and devices for execution of these processes have been disclosed in a<br>
plurality of embodiments and are widely used in packaging systems for liquid or<br>
paste products, as for example in the well-known Bottelpack.RTM. system.<br>
EP 0 359 971 Bl discloses a comparable blow-fill-seal process for production of<br>
hollow containers of plastic. Two halves are molded and welded together in a<br>
tool. A frame-shaped hollow element is molded and welded in the same way as<br>
the containers themselves from a waste edge zone of the containers (ampules).<br>
The containers are configured in sequence in a strip.<br>
In the above disclosed processes, the possibility exists of applying identification<br>
data, especially in the form of code numerals. Among other things, that data<br>
may indicate the place and date of production, the contents, the amount<br>
contained in the respective container and any expiration dates of the contents of<br>
a container. Placement of the data can be on the toggle element itself by which<br>
the sealing head piece is separated from the container for the process of removal<br>
of the contents or in the area of the edge waste zone surrounding the respective<br>
container and sold with the respective container as a sale unit. The respective<br>
identification data may also be present uncoded as information for end users,<br>
but are predominantly present in coded form for presentation of information<br>
content to producer and intermediate purchaser circles, and are applied in the<br>
disclosed processes in the production machine itself. The code numerals are<br>
fitted into the molding halves before the blow-fill-seal process is carried out so<br>
that the code numerals may be impressed into the respective container directly<br>
in the molding process. Since the production machines involved may easily have<br>
ten or more single-use molds, it may take several hours or even an entire day to<br>
replace the code numerals in the form of die plates or individual type which are<br>
to be fitted into the mold. Such expenditure of time is necessary in particular if<br>
one production machine is to apply different code numerals to the various molds<br>
as required by the production process. Since application of the code numerals<br>
inside the molds by hand is a very complicated process, it is also possible that a<br>
single error, such as application of an incorrect code numeral in the mold, may<br>
make it necessary to halt the production process and dispose all the containers<br>
produced up to that point by the production machine in the process. In such<br>
exchange processes the machine for producing the containers is not available,<br>
resulting in high operating costs.<br>
EP0443292 discloses a device and method for the manufacture of a multiple<br>
plastic mould for the reproduction of intaglio printing plates.<br>
The device comprises an electrode holder carrying a plate electrode (7), a plate<br>
holder carrying an original plate (19), comprising an etched drawing, and frame-<br>
slides carrying a thermoformable plastic plate (4) which are disposed and can<br>
move relatively between the original plate (17) and the said electrode (7). The<br>
original plate (19) forms a second electrode, both electrodes being connected to<br>
a high-frequency apparatus. The first plate electrode (7) has an outline (7a)<br>
which corresponds to an envelope of the drawing of the original plate (19) and<br>
therefore of the block to be produced. The edge of the first electrode is<br>
surrounded by an insulating border of thickness equal to that of the said first<br>
electrode. By these measures, during the compression moulding with high-<br>
frequency heating, it is practically only the block zone which is heated.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Objects of the present invention are to provide improved molding processes and<br>
devices where an exchange process of the identification data for plastic<br>
containers may be carried out in a simple and cost-effective manner, and<br>
especially so that the production process itself for plastic containers is not<br>
impaired as a result.<br>
These objects are basically attained by a stamping device for stamping<br>
identification data, especially in the form of code numerals, in plastic products<br>
such as containers produced by a blow-fill-seal process. A frame of the device<br>
comprises at least one stamp having a stamping unit with replaceable<br>
identification data mounted so that it may be displaced horizontally. When in a<br>
raised position, products can be moved toward and away from the stamping unit,<br>
which products are to be stamped or have been stamped. When in a lowered<br>
position, the stamping unit effects stamping of the products.<br>
The stamping device is mounted outside the production machine proper fcr<br>
execution of the blow-fill-seal process. The containers are first fully produced,<br>
filled, and sealed before they are moved further to the stamping device for<br>
stamping of identification data. The stamping device of the present invention,<br>
with its frame structure and the stamp, permits very high rates of output of<br>
goods to be stamped. As a rule, the stamping process may basically be<br>
disconnected from the production process proper in time and space by the<br>
stamping device. In addition, because of its frame structure the stamping device<br>
is very easily accessible from the exterior, and a process of exchange of<br>
identification data for the containers (ampules) in rapid succession and with little<br>
adjustment effort may be achieved. The latter is a factor in particular if, as a<br>
result of incorrect selection of code numerals, the stamping processes must be<br>
interrupted and the incorrect code numerals, replaced with the correct ones.<br>
From the viewpoint of safety engineering the stamping device is easy to control.<br>
When supplemented by safety engineering system elements, it may help prevent<br>
hazardous conditions for operating personnel.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the stamping device of the present invention,<br>
the plastic material and/or the stamping unit is/are heated for stamping of the<br>
identification data. Thus, the residual heat of the plastic product following<br>
application of heat and pressure in the process of its production may be used for<br>
stamping by the stamping unit. It is also possible, however, to heat the stamping<br>
unit additionally to stamp the identification data required in the cooled plastic<br>
product with the heated stamping unit.<br>
It has been found to be especially advantageous to deliver and remove the<br>
plastic product in the direction transverse to that of stamping with the stamp and<br>
to employ a stamp support supporting the plastic product. The stamp support is<br>
moved simultaneously with the stamp or desynchronized from it in the opposite<br>
direction of movement. This configuration makes it possible to operate the<br>
productio+n machine at high speeds of output of plastic products safely and at the<br>
same speed of production as that of the machine.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the stamping device of the present<br>
invention, the frame has columnar guides for longitudinal movement of the<br>
plate-like stamping unit and a support plate for the stamp. The frame structure<br>
of the stamping device is reinforced by the columnar guides, so that high<br>
accuracy may be achieved in stamping processes, along with clearly recognizable<br>
identification data. In addition, the stamping forces generated by the stamping<br>
process are reliably transmitted to the frame of the stamping device by the<br>
columnar guides. Preferably, the plate-like stamping unit and the support plate<br>
are adjacent to and face each other and the piston rods of the stamping plate<br>
and the support plate engage the associated plate. Their housing element is<br>
rigidly connected to the frame. In this way, the base structure of the frame with<br>
the columnar guides may be additionally rigidified by the housing element stamp<br>
configured as an operating cylinder. Hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders, as well as<br>
electric motor operators with spindle drives, may be employed as operating<br>
cylinders for the stamp and stamp support.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of stamping device of the present invention, a<br>
guide plate is connected to the frame by a columnar suspension and mounted<br>
between the plate-like stamping unit and support plate. This guide plate guides<br>
the plastic products for a stamping process within the frame. The guide piate<br>
makes certain that the plastic products to be stamped reach a precisely definable<br>
stamping position inside the stamping device and that components not provided<br>
for stamping do not inadvertently undergo the stamping process and possibly are<br>
damaged. In addition, the guide plate together with the support plate serves as<br>
a support for the plastic product during the stamping process.<br>
To allow the greatest possible number of stamping processes to be carried out<br>
with the plastic products, in one preferred embodiment of the stamping device of<br>
the present invention, the plastic products in the form of ampules are configured<br>
as containers connected to each other in a strip by a (waste) edge zone, and are<br>
stamped in succession with several adjacent ampules being provided<br>
simultaneously with the stamp.<br>
Other objects, advantages and salient features of the present invention will<br>
become apparent from the following detailed description, which, taken in<br>
conjunction with the accompanied drawings, disclose a preferred embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Referring to the drawings which form a part of this disclosure:<br>
FIG. 1 is a side elevational view of the basic components of a stamping device<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention, as seen in the direction of<br>
the arrow X in FIG. 2;<br>
FIG. 2 is a front elevational view of the stamping device of FIG. 1, as seen in the<br>
direction of the arrow Y in FIG. 1;<br>
FIG. 3 is a top plan view of a strip of (three) containers in succession with toggle<br>
elements as sealing pieces on the head side provided with identification data<br>
with the spaces identified by X provided with any desired code numerals or<br>
letters or also ones in decoded form, according to the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The plastic product shown in FIG. 3 has three containers 10 interconnected in<br>
sequence in a strip by an edge zone 12, also of plastic. The interior 14 of the<br>
container 10 is filled with a fluid such as one in the form of a pharmaceutical<br>
preparation or the like. A neck element 16 is sealed by a toggle seal or a toggle<br>
seal element 20. A separation point 18 facilitates the opening of the container.<br>
The edge waste zone of flat plastic material possibly still present between edge<br>
zone 12 with neck element and the toggle seals 20 as shown in FIG. 3 is<br>
removed, preferably by punching. The toggle seal 20 is configured to be flat and<br>
permits easy opening of the container 10 by manual separation (rotation) of the<br>
toggle seal by the separation point 18 from the associated neck element 16.<br>
Such containers 10 are produced by the above disclosed processes and molding<br>
devices (not shown), ones in which a tube of plasticized material is extruded into<br>
a molding device. One end of the tube is sealed by heat sealing. As a result of<br>
generation of a pneumatic pressure gradient acting on the tube, the tube is<br>
expanded and applied to a shaping wall of the molding device having two<br>
opposite molding tools (not shown) for the purpose of forming the container.<br>
The plastic container 10 is then filled under sterile conditions in the molding<br>
device by a suitable filling mandrel (not shown). After the filling mandrel has<br>
been removed, the tube is then hermetically sealed to form the definable head<br>
geometry illustrated in FIG. 3. Such processes and molding devices are of the<br>
prior art and are described, for example, in DE 199 26 329 Al and in EP 0 359<br>
971 Bl, and accordingly, will not be discussed further here.<br>
Code numerals 22 are applied to the surfaces of the toggle seal elements 20.<br>
Crosses or the letter X are used as placeholders to indicate the spaces reserved<br>
for the identification data in the form of code numerals. In place of the<br>
placeholders indicated by X, any identification and manufacturing data can be<br>
used and may provide information as numbers or numerals in coded form to<br>
experts at large. Such information may relate to the place and mode of<br>
production, expiration dates, fluid contents, etc. The code numerals 22 may also<br>
provide information to end users in uncoded form concerning expiration dates,<br>
names of manufacturers, or the like. The possibility also exists of dying the code<br>
numerals 22 to attract the attention of the user to the display field containing the<br>
identification data. In addition, illustrations such as pictographs, for example,<br>
may be used to indicate clearly that the contents or the like are to be<br>
administered only orally. Directions for use or parts of them may also be<br>
reproduced by stamping in the identification data field.<br>
The stamping device by means for applying identification data, such as code<br>
numerals 22, to container elements will now be described with reference to<br>
FIGS. 1 and 2. Application of the code numerals 22 to the toggle seals 20 as<br>
shown in FIG. 3 is presented exclusively by example. Thus, for example, the<br>
identification data may also be applied to edge zones and waste edge zones in<br>
conjunction with the containers 10, or the identification data may be applied<br>
directly to the container 10 in areas which include the interior of the container ID<br>
with its fluid or other medium. In the latter case, the stamping processes are to<br>
be conducted with suitable care to prevent stamping through the container 10,<br>
something which might cause the contents of the container to be unusable. A<br>
plurality of potential container configurations can be used with the present<br>
invention, including ampules or syringes, so that the exemplary embodiment<br>
shown in FIG. 3 represents only one option among a decidedly large number of<br>
alternatives for containers produced by the blow-fill-seal process.<br>
The stamping device shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 for stamping identification data,<br>
especially those in the form of code numerals 22, in plastic products such as<br>
containers 10 or ampules produced preferably by a blow-fill-seal process, has a<br>
frame 24 made up of longitudinal supports 26 and transverse supports 28. Only<br>
part of the frame elements is shown in the illustration in order that the essential<br>
components of the device may be more clearly illustrated. The frame 24 may<br>
have longitudinal supports 26 and transverse supports 28, but may also have<br>
individual spars which are welded together, joined by a threaded connection, or<br>
riveted to each other and optionally further reinforced by crossarm braces 30 to<br>
form a kind of box-type frame in which the movable machine elements of the<br>
stamping device are received and fastened.<br>
A stamp 32 with a plate-like stamping unit or stamping plate 34 is mounted in<br>
the frame 24 of the device. This stamp 32 is configured as a working cylinder<br>
and is provided with a retractable and extensible piston rod 36. The free end of<br>
rod 36 engages the plate-like stamping unit 34. The housing element 38 of the<br>
working cylinder (stamp 32) is mounted on a frame plate 40, which, as viewed in<br>
FIG. 2, extends in parallel with the upper transverse support 28 and is held by<br>
the two longitudinal supports 26 a specific distance vertically from the transverse<br>
support 28. The stamping unit 34 has, on its lower side, identification data units<br>
42 designed to be replaceable. That is, individual code numerals 22 or letters or<br>
even pictoral symbols may be replaced as individual type or die plates as parts of<br>
the strip of identification data. The identification data may be configured as<br>
groups of information content positioned side by side or one above the other so<br>
that the stamped image is in the form of an identification data field, as is shown<br>
in FIG. 3 for the plastic product, X identifying the empty space holders or data.<br>
When the stamp 32 with stamping unit 34 and identification data units 42 has<br>
been raised, the products such as the containers 10 to be stamped are placed in<br>
position in the stamping device and/or stamped products are removed from the<br>
stamping device. The stamping process itself is carried out with the stamp 32<br>
lowered as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. The identification data units 42 are then in<br>
contact with the identification data field, in this instance with the flat parts of the<br>
toggle seal 20 as illustrated in FIG. 3.<br>
For the purpose of stamping the identification data, the plastic product is heated<br>
as a function of production or the stamping unit 34 is heated by a heating unit<br>
(not shown). In addition, the direction of delivery and removal of the plastic<br>
product is indicated in FIG. 1 by an arrow Z. Accordingly, unstamped products as<br>
viewed in FIG. 1 move from the left through the stamping unit 34 in the center<br>
of the device to be stamped. After being stamped, the products move to the<br>
right from the stamping device for further handling, for example, to a packing<br>
machine (not shown). Consequently, the direction Z of delivery and removal of<br>
the plastic product is oriented transversely to the direction of stamping with the<br>
stamp 32, which moves the stamping unit 34 vertically along the longitudinal axis<br>
44 of the device as viewed in FIGS. 1 and 2 (see FIG. 2).<br>
As shown in the illustrations, a support stamp 46 is provided, and may be moved<br>
in the opposite direction simultaneously or desynchronized from the stamp 32.<br>
The support stamp 46 also has a working cylinder operated by hydraulic,<br>
pneumatic, or electric means and having a piston rod 48. The free end of piston<br>
rod 48 is mounted to the support plate 50 with a support element 52 positioned<br>
on it. In addition, the support stamp 46 has a housing element 54 rigidly<br>
connected to a lower frame plate 56. The linear movement of the support stamp<br>
46 is also oriented in directions along the longitudinal axis 44 of the stamping<br>
device as a whole. Inside the frame 24, four columnar guides or guide columns<br>
58 extend in parallel with the longitudinal axis 44 of the stamping device. The<br>
free ends of columnar guides 58 are mounted in pairs in the upper frame plate<br>
40 and the lower frame plate 56. Both the plate-like stamping unit 34 and the<br>
support plate 50, with their rectangular cross-sections, are mounted by guide<br>
sleeves 60 on the columnar guides 58. When the stamp 32 and support stamp<br>
46 are moved into and out of position, the plates move along with them, while<br>
the housing elements 38 and 54 are kept stationary in the frame 24.<br>
In FIG. 1, in the respective side view, the columnar guides 58 are mounted<br>
immediately adjacent to the stamp 32 and support stamp 46 so that rigidification<br>
of the stamping device as a total system is largely achieved. The plate-like<br>
stamping unit 34 and the support plate 50 are adjacent and face each other. The<br>
piston rods 36 and 48 of the stamp 32 and support stamp 46 engage the<br>
stamping unit 34 and support plate 50. Their housing elements 38 and 54 are<br>
mounted on the frame 24 so as to be stationary. A guide plate 64 is rigidly<br>
connected to the frame 24 by a column suspension 62 having four columns. This<br>
guide plate 64 is mounted between plate-like stamping unit 34 and support plate<br>
50 and guides the plastic products, as shown by example in FIG. 3, for a process<br>
of stamping with the identification data inside the frame 24. Additional<br>
rigidification of the overall stamping device system is achieved by guide plate 64.<br>
The containers 10 may be guided with precision through the suspended guide<br>
plate 64 so that blurred stampings or erroneous stampings may be reliably<br>
prevented.<br>
The configuration of stamping unit 34 and support stamp 46 may also be<br>
reversed Inside the device. Optionally, the support stamp 46 may be designed as<br>
another stamping unit if stamping of plastic products on both sides inside the<br>
stamping device is desired. The stamping temperature selected for the respective<br>
plastic product is to be one which permits a reliable stamping process without<br>
damage to the plastic material, such as by running or burning. The stamping<br>
temperatures may accordingly be varied as a function of the plastic material<br>
employed and the strength of the material used for the plastic product.<br>
The stamping device illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2 may be connected in series to a<br>
production machine, in particular for a blow-fill-seal process with plastic<br>
products. The amounts of product obtained from the production machine may be<br>
conducted more or less continuously through the stamping station and provided<br>
with stamps. The stamping device may optionally be combined with a punching<br>
unit (not shown) which removes a possible edge waste zone from the respective<br>
plastic product. The option also exists, however, of mounting the stamping<br>
device between a production machine and a punching unit. The timing selected<br>
may be such that the plastic products produced are punched when the conveyor<br>
chain for these products is halted. Stamping of the respective plastic product is<br>
effected at the preceding or upstream station. The possibility also exists of<br>
subjecting the stamping to optoelectronic monitoring to determine if the stamp is<br>
complete and easy to read. Should this quality criterion not be met, the plastic<br>
products found not to meet it may be removed as defective elements from<br>
subsequent or downstream movement in the direction of the packaging station.<br>
While one embodiment has been chosen to illustrate the invention, it will be<br>
understood by those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can<br>
be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
