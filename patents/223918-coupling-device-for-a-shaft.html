				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a coupling device for a shaft that is used for a movable object which rotates about a shaft, more particularly, to a shaft coupling device used for a mechanically shaft coupling device, a mechanically coupling clutch device or a mechanically coupling brake device for a shaft.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
US Patent No. 2783861 (Robert N. Jungles et al) published on March 5,1957 disclosed a driven-released brake. In the technical scheme disclosed in the above publication, a movable member and a static member is constantly kept in friction engagement state in which the movable member engages with the static member during force transmission process. Therefore, the driven-released brake of the above invention is problematic in that the brake is likely to be heated during transmission. As a result, power consumption of the brake is increased.<br>
US Patent No. 2838150 (Clearance M. Eason et al) published on June 10, 1958 disclosed a compressed air operated clutch and mechanically connected brake. In the technical scheme disclosed in the above publication, a movable member and a static member are kept in an engagement state in which the movable member engages with the static member during transmission process when the clutch is driven to be in an engagement state by compressed air. When the clutch is kept in a released state, force generated by a driving member is necessitated so as to achieve a braking function.<br>
US Patent No. 3994376 (David A. Fuighum et al) published on November 30,1976 disclosed a self actuating mechanism for braking a driven member upon discontinuating of drive thereto. In the technical scheme disclosed in the above publication, force is required to be applied to a driven member from a driving<br><br>
member when rotational movement is needed to be stopped.<br>
PCT Publication WO96/01380 (Application No: PCT/CN95/00055) published on January 18, 1996 discloses a constant closed brake. The brake is provided with a brake spring which is provided on a brake disk and a coupling disk. A connection member associated with an external force association member is provided on a member, which is associated with an engageable concave-convex surface associated with a convex/concave surface of the brake disk. The concave-convex surface is separated from the brake disk, and the brake disk is associated with the external force association member through engagement between the brake disk and the concave-convex surface. Therefore, the brake disclosed in this application is complicatedly constructed. The position of the compensation block of the friction gap adjustment and compensation device is not confined along the circumference direction. When the force applied by the external connection member is greater than the braking spring force, the brake disk disconnects from the friction block. On the other hand, the brake disk engages with the friction block as long as the force applied by the external connection member is less than the braking spring force. No device is provided to ensure the coupling device to be in a disconnected state when the brake disk disconnect from the friction block. Further, the coupling device is not provided with an overload protection device during transmission. Moreover, the gap adjustment and compensation device is not sufficiently limited to its position. In other types of constant closed brake, such as an electromagnetic brake, an electromagnet used as a force generating source are kept in a turn-on state during which the brake disk disconnects from the friction block.<br>

The present invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the embodiment set forth herein; rather, this embodiment is provided so that the present disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the concept of the invention to those skilled in the art.<br>
Referring to Fig 1, the mechanical coupling device for a shaft of the present invention includes a coupling disk 1, a disk 2, a force generating source member 3, and first and second concave-convex assemblies 4, 5. The characterizing technical feature of the coupling device for a shaft lies in that the first and second concave-convex assemblies 4,5 are configured to be a press engagement arrangement in which rotational angular displacement and axial displacement relative to each other are operable, wherein the first and second concave-convex assemblies 4,5 and the disk 2 are configured to be a radial press engagement in which rotational sliding angular displacement relative to each other is operable.

An external force association member 6 is provided between the first concave-convex assembly 4 and the external force member 7. The external force association member 6 and the first concave-convex assembly 4 are configured to be press engagement arrangement in which axial sliding displacement relative to each other is operable through the external force association member 6.<br>
The second concave-convex assembly 5 is mounted on the coupling disk 1.<br><br>
The pull rod 14 passes through the circular hole of the disk 2 so as to be mounted to the coupling disk 1. A spring 3 is fitted over the pull rod 14 with one end being press mounted on the disk 2 and the other end thereof being mounted on the other end of the pull rod 14. Upon operation of the spring 3, the disk 2 is associated with a retaining member 21 through engagement between the friction surface of the disk 2 and the friction block 20. The coupling disk 1 is mounted on the out-extending shaft 8 or is coupled to the out-extending shaft 8 through a shaft coupling member 9. When the retaining member 21 is mounted on a relative rotational object, a coupling clutch device is constituted; and When the retaining member 21 is mounted on a relative static object, a coupling brake device is constituted.<br>

Thereafter, the  inventive concept and the technical scheme of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings.<br>
The present invention provides a mechanical coupling device for a shaft. As shown in Fig 1, the coupling device for a shaft comprises a coupling disk 1, a disk 2, a force generating source member 3, a first and second concave-convex assemblies 4, 5, characterized in that the first and second concave-convex assemblies 4,5 are configured to be a press engagement arrangement in which rotational angular displacement and axial displacement relative to each other are operable.

The disk 1 is mounted to the out-extending shaft 8 through the coupling disk 1 or connected to the out-extending shaft 8 through a shaft coupling member 9. Thus, a coupling device for a shaft is constituted.<br><br>
As shown in Fig 2, the force generating source member is configured to be a pull spring 3'. The two ends of pull spring 3' are mounted to the coupling disk 1 and the disk 2.<br>

15 and the outer spline 16 are configured to engage with each other in press engagement in which axial sliding displacement is operable.

Preferably, an engagement construction with a conical friction surface is employed so as to increase transmission capacity.<br>
As shown in Fig 8, if the coupling device of the present invention is applied to the clutch and brake device, a friction ring surface projecting from the disk 2 can be coupled with the friction block. The friction block 20 is mounted on the retaining member 21. When the retaining member 21 is connected to a relative static object, a brake device is formed; and when the retaining member 21 is connected to a relative movable object, an clutch device constituted.<br>
As shown in Fig 9, a friction surface projecting from the coupling disk 1 is coupled with the friction block 20. In order to obtain a uniform gap between the friction surface, a support pin 22 is provided so as to pass through a hole provided on the friction block 20 and be mounted on the retaining member 21. Also, a thin wall sleeve 25 is provided on the first concave-convex assembly 45 so as to achieve dust proof effect.<br>
As shown in Figs 11-13, in order that the friction member is compensated after it is worn out, the friction surface of the coupling device 1 can be divided into an inner disk body 23 and an outer friction ring 24. Also, a compensation device is provided in the inner disk body 23 and the outer friction ring 24. The compensation device comprises an outer threaded block 27 and a compensation spring 28. Sawtooth type inner threaded ring 26 is provided on the outer friction ring 24. Also, Sawtooth threads are provided on the outer threaded block 27 so as<br><br>
to engage with those of the inner threaded ring 26. When the outer threaded block 27 is formed in rectangle shape, a circumferential limit means and an axial limiting means are provided on the inner disk body 23. Further, when the outer threaded block 27 is formed in circular shape, the outer threaded block 27 are fixed in hole with cylindrical surfaces so as to function as an axial limiting means and a circumferential means.<br>

Fig 15 shows the assembled state in which the Fig 7 and Fig 10 are combined together.<br>
As shown in Fig 16, an adjustment spring 29 and a screw 30 are provided on the retaining member 21. One end of the adjustment spring 29 is associated with the retaining member 21, and the other end of the adjustment spring 29 is associated with the friction block 20. The screw 30 is connected to the retaining member 21, and the other end of the screw is associated with the friction block 20 so as to limit the friction block 20.<br>
As shown in Fig 17, a left friction ring 32 is provided in the disk 2 and the friction block 20. A hole is provided on the left friction ring 32, and a long arcuate hole is provided on the disk 2. The disk 2 and the second concave-convex assembly 5 are fixedly connected or integrally formed. The pull rod 14 passes through the hole of the disk 2 and then passes through the hole of the friction ring. A left press plate 31 is provided on the left side of the disk 2, and a hole is provided on left press plate 31. The press plate 31 is mounted to the pull rod 14. One end of the spring 3' is pressed against and connected to the press plate 3, and the other end of the spring 3' is connected to the other end of the pull rod 14.<br>
As shown in Fig 18, the first concave-convex assembly 4 and the disk 2 are integrally formed. An inner support rod "c" is fixed to the disk 2. A right friction ring 35 is provided between the outer friction ring 24 and the friction block 20. The right<br><br>
friction ring 35 is mounted onto an inner support pin 33 through a hole. At this time, the external force member 7 can be used as a driven shaft, and the out-extending shaft 8 can be used as a driving shaft. Thus, a reversed mounting arrangement is achieved.<br>
As shown in Fig 19, a key pin 36 is provided between the outer friction ring 24 and the right friction ring 35. The key pin 36 engages with a hole of the right friction ring 35 so as to restrict the relative rotation between the outer friction ring 24 and the coupling disk 1.<br>
As shown in Fig 20, a release member 37 is provided on the left friction ring 32 or integrally formed on the left friction ring 32. The left side of the disk 2 engages with the release member 37, and the left side of the release member 37 is connected to the left friction ring 32. In this case, when the disk 2 moves in the axial direction, the left friction ring 32 is actuated to move in conjunction with movement of the disk 2.<br>
In order to keep the first and second concave-convex assemblies 4, 5 in a release state, restriction is applied to the components connected to the first and second concave-convex assemblies 4, 5 so as to retraining the first and second concave-convex assemblies 4, 5 from rotating relative to each other. That is, a flexible coupling device can be converted to be a rigid coupling device or a rigid coupling device can be converted to be flexible coupling device. Thus, the brake and clutch device can be shifted from a normally closed state into normally released state or from a normally released state into a normally closed state.<br>
As shown in Fig 21, a release-ensuring frame 41 and a confronting member 42 are provided and directly or indirectly connected to the concave or convex assembly 4, 5 respectively. A groove hole is provided on the release-ensuring frame 41, and threaded hole is provided on the confronting member. When the first concave-convex assembly 4 rotates a predetermined angle relative to the second concave-convex assembly 5, a locking member "a" provided outside of the mechanism can be tightened into the threaded hole through the groove hole. Thus, the relative rotation between the first<br><br>
concave-convex assembly 4 and the second concave-convex assembly 5 is retrained. At this case, the brake and clutch device is rigidly connected, and be kept in a normally released state.<br>
As shown in Fig 22, a support arm is provided on the release-ensuring frame 41, and an insert rod 38 is hinged to the support arm of the release-ensuring frame 41. A plug of the insert rod 38 can be inserted into a groove of the confronting member 42 through a hole of the release-ensuring frame 41. A centrifugal member 39 is provided on the lever 43 connected to the other end of the insert rod 38. One end of a spring 40 is mounted onto the centrifugal member 39, and the other end of spring 40 is mounted onto the release-ensuring frame 41. In this case, when the device rotates at a low speed or remains static, the centrifugal force applied to the centrifugal member 39 is smaller than spring force exerted by the spring 40 and the insert rod 38 can not be inserted into the groove. When rotation speed of the centrifugal member 39 increases to be more than a predetermined value, the centrifugal force applied to the centrifugal member 39 is greater than the spring force exerted by the spring 40. As a result, the centrifugal member 39 can be inserted into the groove. Thus, a rigid coupling is achieved so that the brake and clutch device is kept in a normally released state.<br>
As shown in Fig 23, the centrifugal member 39 is replaced by a centrifugal cap 44. An outer threaded cylinder is provided on the release-ensuring frame 41, and a cap 45 is mounted on the outer threaded cylinder of the release-ensuring frame 41 through inner threads provided thereon. A spring 40 is mounted on the front insert rod 46 and located in the outer threaded cylinder of the release-ensuring frame 41. One end of the spring is associated with the cap 45, and the other end of the spring is associated with a plug of the front insert rod 46. At this time, when the device rotates at low speed or remains static, the front insert rod 46 can be inserted into a groove of the confronting member 42. Contrary to the situation as illustrated in Fig 22, when rotation speed increases, the front insert rod 46 can not be inserted into the groove which is contrary to the<br><br>
state shown in the Fig 22.<br>
As shown in Fig 24, the front insert rod 46 or the rear insert rod 48 are used in combination with each other, an association pin 47 is provided on the centrifugal cap 44 so as to be associated with an association elongated hole of the lever 43. When rotation speed is smaller than a critical value, the front insert rod 46 is inserted into a groove. When rotation speed is greater than a critical value, the rear insert rod 48 is inserted into the groove so that relative angular displacement between the first concave-convex assembly 4 and the second concave-convex assembly 5 is restricted. When the rotation speed comes around the critical value, the relative angular displacement between the first concave-convex assembly 4 and the second concave-convex assembly 5 is not restricted.<br>
Fig 25 shows a brake and clutch device in which the components shown in Figs 21 -24 are incorporated thereto.<br>
As shown in Fig 26, in the above brake and clutch device, in order that the rotation inertia is reduced, it is preferable that a spring is mounted on the retaining member 21. As a result, a first and second concave-convex assemblies 4, 5 are directly or indirectly supported on the retaining member 21.<br>
Referring to Fig 26, the first concave-convex assembly 4 is provided with a ring, and a bearing 52' is provided between the disk 1 and the disk 2. The disk 2 is provided with an outer spline so as to engage with the inner spline of the retaining member 21.

The bearing 52' is provided with a left shaft end cover 64. An external force association member 6 is<br><br>
provided between the left shaft transition member 50 and the external force member 7. The release screw 67 passes through a circular hole of the left end plate 54 so as to be mounted on the disk 2, and the disk 2 is provided with a friction block 20. The convex member 5 is mounted onto the right end plate 56 through the bearing 52', and the bearing 52' is provided with an right end cover 57.

The second concave-convex assembly 5 is associated with the out-extending shaft 8 through the right shaft transition member 51. When the retaining member 21 is mounted on a relatively movable object, a coupling clutch device for a shaft is formed. When the retaining member 21 is mounted on a relative static object, a coupling brake device for a shaft is formed. When the inner brake ring 53 is not provided, a coupling for a shaft is formed.<br>

The first and second concave-convex assemblies 4,5 of the present invention are configured to be a press engagement arrangement in which axial angular displacement relative to each other is operable. The first concave-convex assembly 4 and the disk 2 constitute a coupling assembly with a axial press engagement in which rotational angular displacement relative to each other is operable. An external force association member 6 is provided between the first concave-convex assembly 4 and the external force member 7. The first concave-convex assembly 4 and the external connection member 6 is configured to be radial press engagement arrangement in which axial displacement relative<br><br>
to each other is operable. The external force member 7 engages with the first concave-convex assembly 4 through the external force association member 6 and is further associated with the coupling disk 1 through the engagement between the first concave-convex assembly 4 and the second concave-convex assembly 5. Thus, the external force member 7 is mounted onto the out-extending shaft 8. Therefore, the construction of the coupling device is simplified, and transmission efficiency is improved. Further, the engagement and release operation of the coupling device can be more reliably and effectively performed.<br>
2.	In the coupling brake and clutch device for a shaft of the present invention, a coupling device for a shaft of the present invention is used. As a result, the transmission efficiency of the coupling is enhanced, and more reliable and effective engagement and release operation of the coupling brake and clutch device can be achieved.<br>
3.	The gap adjustment and compensation device of the present invention includes a circumferential and an axial limiting means in which an inner disk body 23 is provided with an outer threaded block 27. Thus, the reliability of the compensation device of the coupling brake device is improved.<br>
4.	The release-ensuring device of the present invention includes an insert rod 38, a centrifugal member 39, a release-ensuring spring 40 and a release-ensuring frame 41. The release-ensuring source device in the prior art such as an electromagnet is replaced by a linkage mechanism, a front insert rod 46 and a rear insert rod 48. Therefore, the power consumption is reduced. Further, when the external force member is disconnected from the external force generating source under high speed, the brake disk and the friction block do not engage with each other immediately due to operation of the release-ensuring device. Only when rotation speed drops down to a predetermined value, the brake disk and the friction block engages with each other so as to achieve delay braking technical effect. As a result, the control devices of the prior art, such as electrical controllers are omitted.<br>
5.	In the overload protection device of the present invention, a friction<br><br>
engagement member 18 and the friction transmission member 19 are provide between the friction member 7 and the first concave-convex assembly 4. When transmission torsional moment excesses the torsional moment generated by the friction engagement body 18, slip occurs in the friction transmission process so as to achieve an overload protection function.<br>
Figs 27-48 show a coupling device for a shaft according to a first embodiment of the present invention. The coupling device of the present invention includes a first concave-convex assembly 4 and a second concave-convex assembly 5, an assembly of splines 15,16, a disk 2, a coupling disk 1, a retaining member 21, a support pin 22, a friction block 20, an inner brake ring 53, a thin wall sleeve 25, a pull rod 14, a spring 3, an outer friction ring 24, an inner disk body 23, an outer threaded block 27, an inner threaded block 26, a compensation spring 28, a locking member "a", a nut 61, and a key pin 36.<br>
The first concave-convex assembly 4 is provided with a projecting platform surface 67. The projecting platform surface 67 engages with a projecting platform surface 68 of the disk 2 so that an axial press engagement arrangement is constituted in which relative rotational angular displacement between the projecting platform surface 67 and the projecting platform surface 68 is operable. The first concave-convex assembly 4 is provided with an inner spline 15, and the second concave-convex assembly 5 is provided with an outer spline 16.

The pull rod 14 passes through a circular hole 72 of the disk 2, a circular hole 75 of the inner<br><br>
brake ring 53 and a circular hole 73 of the right friction ring 35. One end of the pull rod 14 is fixed on the coupling disk 1, and a spring 3 is fitted over the pull rod 14. One end of the spring 3 is pressed against the disk 2, and the other end of the spring 3 is associated with the other end of the pull rod 14 through the nut 61.

The inner brake ring 53 is fitted over the pull rod 14 through the circular hole 75 provided thereon. The coupling disk 1 can also be mounted on the out-extending shaft 8 through shaft coupling member 9. When the external force member 7 rotates, moment is transferred to the out-extending shaft 8. Upon operation of the spring 3 and the pull rod 14, the first concave-convex assembly 4 can both rotate relative to the second concave-convex assembly 5 and displace in an axial direction relative to the second concave-convex assembly 5 so that the disk 2 and the outer friction ring 24 disconnect from the friction block 20.<br>
Consequently, the inner spline 15 slides on the outer spline 16 in axial direction so as to achieve a cushion effect. As a result, a flexible coupling device is achieved. When the external force member 7 loses power source, the disk 2 and the outer friction ring 24 engage with the friction block 20 so as to achieve a braking effect due to operation of the spring 3. As a result, brake effect can be achieved by the coupling device.<br>

Positive pressure is applied on oil in the E chamber of the oil cylinder 66, and negative pressure is applied on oil in the D<br><br>
chamber of the oil cylinder 66. As a result, time delay due to large damp is generated. Oil lines are preferably provided inside the piston of the cylinder, and oil can be introduced into the oil chambers through the piston rod and a bottom plate of the cylinder.<br>
