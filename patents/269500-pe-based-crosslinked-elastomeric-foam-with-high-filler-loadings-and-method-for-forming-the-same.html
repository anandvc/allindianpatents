				<td>PE-BASED CROSSLINKED ELASTOMERIC FOAM WITH HIGH<br>
FILLER LOADINGS FOR MAKING SHOCKPADS AND ARTICLES<br>
USED IN FOOTWEAR AND FLOORING APPLICATIONS<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF DISCLOSURE<br><br>
Field of the Disclosure<br><br>
[0001]	Embodiments disclosed herein relate generally to crosslinked foams suitable<br>
for use as a shock absorbing layer. In another aspect, embodiments disclosed herein relate to crosslinked foams useful in footwear, such as part of a shoe or boot, including soles, midsoles, or a complete shoes or boot. In another aspect, embodiments described herein relate to a synthetic turf and other flooring applications including a crosslinked foam shock absorbing layer, where the foam may include up to 50% of a filler.<br><br>
Background<br><br>
[0002]	Conventional articles of footwear include two primary elements, an upper and<br>
a sole structure. The upper provides a covering for the foot that securely receives and positions the foot with respect to the sole structure. In addition, the upper may have a configuration that protects the foot and provides ventilation, thereby cooling the foot and removing perspiration. The sole structure is secured to a lower surface of the upper and is generally positioned between the foot and the ground. In addition to attenuating ground reaction forces, the sole structure may provide traction and control potentially harmful foot motion, such as over-pronation. Accordingly, the upper and the sole structure operate cooperatively to provide a comfortable structure that is suited for a wide variety of ambulatory activities, such as walking running. The general features and configuration of the upper and the sole structure are discussed in greater detail below.<br><br>
[0003]	The upper forms a void on the interior of the footwear for receiving the foot.<br>
The void has the general shape of the foot, and access to the void is provided by an ankle opening. Accordingly, the upper extends over the instep and toe areas of the foot, along the medial and lateral sides of the foot, and around the heel area of the foot. A lacing system is often incorporated into the upper to selectively increase the size of the ankle opening and permit the wearer to modify certain dimensions of the upper, particularly girth, to accommodate feet with varying proportions. In addition, the upper may include a tongue that extends under the lacing system to enhance the comfort of the footwear, and the upper may include a heel counter to limit movement of the heel.<br><br>
[0004]	Various materials may be utilized in manufacturing the upper. The upper of<br>
an article of footwear, for example, may be formed from multiple material layers that include an exterior layer, a middle layer, and an interior layer. The materials forming the exterior layer of the upper may be selected based upon the properties of wear-resistance, flexibility and air-permeability for example. With regard to the exterior layer, the toe area and the heel area may be formed of leather, synthetic leather, or a rubber material to impart a relatively high degree of wear-resistance. Leather, synthetic leather, and rubber materials may not exhibit the desired degree of flexibility and air-permeability. Accordingly, various other areas of the exterior layer of the upper may be formed from a synthetic textile. The exterior layer of the upper may be formed, therefore, from numerous material elements that each imparts different properties to specific areas of the upper.<br><br>
[0005]	A middle layer of the upper may be formed fm a lightweight polymer foam<br>
material that attenuates ground reaction forces and protects the foot from objects that may contact the upper. Similarly, an interior layer of the upper may be formed of a moisture-wicking textile that removes perspiration from the area immediately surrounding the foot. In some articles of athletic footwear, the various layers may be joined with an adhesive, and stitching may be utilized to join elements within a single layer or to reinforce specific areas of the upper.<br><br>
[0006]	The   sole   structure   generally   incorporates   multiple   layers   that   are<br>
conventionally referred to as an insole, a insole, and an outsole. The insole is a thin, comfort-enhancing member located within the upper and adjacent the plantar (lower) surface of the foot to enhance footwear comfort. The midsole, which is traditionally attached to the upper along the entire length of the upper, forms the middle layer of the sole structure and serves a variety of purposes that include controlling foot motions and attenuating ground reaction forces. The outsole forms the ground-contacting element of footwear and is usually fashioned from a durable, wear-resistant material that includes texturing to improve traction.<br><br><br>
[0007]	The primary element of a conventional midsole is a resilient, polymer foam<br>
material, such as polyurethane or ethylvinylacetate, which extends throughout the length of the footwear. The properties of the polymer foam material in the midsole are primarily dependent upon factors that include the dimensional configuration of the midsole and the specific characteristics of the material selected for the polymer foam, including the density of the polymer foam material. By varying these factors throughout the midsole, the relative stiffnesals, degree of ground reaction force attenuation, and energy absorption properties may be altered to meet the specific demands of the activity for which the footwear is intended to be used.<br><br>
[0008]	Various foams also find use as a shock-absorbing layer in artificial turf.<br>
Artificial turf consists of a multitude of artificial grass tufts extending upward from a sheet substrate. The turf is usually laid upon a prepared, flat ground surface to form a game playing field intended to simulate a natural grass playing field surface. <br>
[0009]	For some types of games, a resilient underpad is placed beneath the turf and<br>
upon the firm ground support surface to provide a shock absorbing effect. Also, in some instances, a layer of sand or other particulate material is placed upon the upper surface of the carpet base sheet and around the strands. An example of this type of construction is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,389,435 issued Jun. 21, 1983 to Frederick T. Haas, Jr. Another example is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,637,942 issued Jan. 20, 1987 to Seymour A. Tomarin.<br><br>
[0010]	Further, examples of artificial turfs which are formed with the grass-like<br>
carpet placed upon a resilient underpad are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,551,263 issued Dec. 29,1970 to Carter et al., which discloses a polyurethane foam underpad; U.S. Pat. No. 3,332,828 issued Jul. 25, 1967 to Faria et al., which discloses a PVC foam plastic or polyurethane foam plastic underpad; U.S. Pat. No. 4,637,942 issued Jan. 20, 1987 to Seymour A. Tomarin which discloses a rubber-like underpad; U.S. Pat. No. 4,882,208 issued Nov. 21, 1989 to Hans-Urich Brietschidel, which illustrates a closed cell crosslinked polyethylene foam underpad; U.S. Pat. No. 3,597,297 issued Aug. 3, 1971 to Theodore Buchholz et al., which discloses a polyurethane underpad having voids; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,505,960 issued Mar. 19, 1985 to James W. Leffingwell, which discloses shock absorbing pads made from elastomer foams of polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, polyurethane, polypropylene, etc.<br><br><br>
[0011]	Shock absorbing layers may, of course, be more broadly used in other<br>
applications, such as in energy dampening in floors and shockpads for shoes, for example. What is still needed, therefore, are improved materials and methods for forming shock absorbing layers. There also exists a need for improved materials that may be used to fonn portions of a shoe or boot, including the sole, midsole, or other various portions of a shoe.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0024]	General Defimtions and Measurement Methods:<br>
[0025]	The following tenns shall have the given meaning for the purposes of this<br>
invention:<br>
[0026]	"Polymer" means a substance composed of molecules with large molecular<br>
mass consisting of repeating structural units, or monomers, connected by covalent Chemical bonds. The tenn 'polymer' generally includes, but is not limited to, homopolymers, copolymers such as block, graft, random and altemating copolymers, terpolymers, etc, and blends and modifications thereof. Further, unless otherwise specifically limited, the term 'polymer' shall include all possible geometrical configurations of the molecular structure. These configurations include isotactic, syndiotact, random configurations, and the like.<br>
[0027]	"Interpolymer" means a polymer prepared by the polyerization of at least<br>
two different types of monomers. The generic term "interpolymer" includes the term "copolymer" (which is usually employed to refer to a polymer prepared from two different monomers) as wells the term "terpolymer" (which is usually employed to refer to a polymer prepared from three different types of monomers). The class of materials known as "interpolymers" alo encompasses polymers made by polymerizing four or more types of monomers.<br>
[0028]	Density of resins and compositions is measured according to ASTM D792.<br>
[0029]	Density of foams is measured according to ASTM D3575AV/B.<br>
[0030]	"Melt Index (12)" is determined according to ASTM D1238 using a weight of<br>
2.16 kg at 190Â°C for polymers comprising ethylene as the major component in the polymer. "Melt Flw Rate" (MFR) is determined according to ASTM D1238 using a weight of 2.16 kg at 230Â°C for polymers comprising propylene as the major component in the polymer.<br><br><br>
[0031]	Molecular weight distribution (MWD) of the polymers is detennined using gel<br>
permeation chromatography (GPC), such as on a Polymer Laboratories PL-GPC-220 high temperature chromatographic unit equipped with four linear mixed bed columns (Polymer Laboratories (20-micron partice size)). The oven temperature is at 160Â°C with the autosampler hot zone at 160and the warm zone at 145'C. The solvent is 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene containing 200 ppm 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol. The flow rate is LO mÃ¼liliter/minute and the injection size is 100 microliters. About 0.2% by weight solutions of the samples are prepared for injection by dissolving the sample in nitrogen purged 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene containing 200 ppm 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol for 2.5 hrs at 160Â°C with gentle mixing.<br>
[0032]	The molecular weight determination is deduced by using ten narrow molecular<br>
weight distribution polystyrene standards (from Polymer Laboratories, EasiCal PSl<br>
ranging from 580 - 7,500,000 g/mole) in conjunction with their elution volumes.<br>
The equivalent polypropylene molecular weights are detennined by using<br>
appropriate Mark-Houwink coefficients for polypropylene (as described by Th.G.<br>
Scholte, N.LJ. Meijerink, H.M. Schoffeleers, and A.M.G. Brands, J. Appl. Polym.<br>
Sci., 29, 3763 - 3782 (1984)) and polystyrene (as described by E. P. Otocka, R. J.<br>
Roe, N. Y. Hellman, P. M. Muglia, Macromolecules, 4, 507 (1971)) in the Mark-<br>
Houwink	equation:<br>
{N} = KM' where Kpp = 1.90E-04 , app = 0.725 and Kp4= 1.26E-04, aps = 0.702.<br>
"Molecular weight distribution" or MWD is measured by conventional GPC per the<br>
procedure described by Williams, T.; Ward, I. M. Journal of Polymer Science,<br>
Polymer Letters Edition (1968), 6(9), 621-624. CoÃ«fficiÃ«nt B is 1. CoÃ«fficiÃ«nt A is<br>
0.4316.<br>
[0033]	The term "high pressure low density type resin" is defined to mean that the<br>
polymer is partly or entirely homopolymerized or copolymerized in autoclave or tubular reactors at pressures above 14,500 psi (100 MPa) with the use of free-radical initiators, such as peroxides (see for example US 4,599,392, herein incorporated by reference) and includes "LDPE" which may also be referred to as "high pressure ethylene polymer" or "highly branched polyethylene." The cumulative detector fraction (CDF) of these materials is greater than about 0.02 for molecular weight greater than 1000000 g/mol as measured using light scattering.    CDF may be<br><br><br>
determined as described in WO2005/023912 A2, which is herein incorporated by reference for its teachings regarding CDF. The preferred high pressure low density polyethylene material (LDPE) has a melt index MI (12) of less than about 20, more preferably less than about 15, most preferably less than 10, and greater than about 0.1, more preferably greater than about 0.2, most preferably more than 0.3 g/lOmin. The preferred LDPE will have a density between about 0.915 g/cmS and 0.930 g/cm3, with less than 0.925g/cm3 being more preferred.<br>
[0034]	"Crystallinity" means atomic dimension or structural order of a polymer<br>
composition. Crystallinity is often represented by a fraction or percentage of the volume of the material that is crystallinor as a measure of how likely atoms or molecules are to be arranged in a regular pattem, namely into a crystal. Crystallinity of polymers can be adjusted fairly precisely and over a very wide range by heat treatment. A "crystalle" "semi-crystalle" polymer possesses a first order transition or crystaUine meling point (Tm) as determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) or equivalent technique. The term may be used interchangeably with the term "semicrystalline." The term "amorphous" refers to a polym lacking a crystaUine melting point as determined by differential scaiming calorimetry (DSC) or equivalent technique.<br>
[0035]	Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) is a common technique that can be<br>
used to examine the melting and crystallization of semi-crystalÃ¼ne polymers. General principles of DSC measurements and appUcations of DSC to studying semiÂ¬crystalline polymers are described in Standard texts (e.g., E. A. Turi, ed., Thermal Characterization of Polymeric Materials, Academie Press, 1981). DSC is a method suitable for determining the melting characteristics of a polymer.<br>
[0036]	DSC analysis is performed using a model Q1000 DSC fromInstruments,<br>
Inc. DSC is caliated by the foUowing method. First, a baseli is obtained by running the DSC from -90Â°C to 290Â°C without any sample in the aluninum DSC pan. Then 7 miUigrams of a fresh indium sample is analyzed by heating the sample to 180Â°C, cooling the sample to 140Â°C at a cooÃ¼ng rate of 10/min folled by keeping the sample isothermaUy at 140Â°C for 1 minute, folled by heating the sample from 140Â° to 180Â°Ct a heating rate of 10Â°C/mmThe heat of fusion and the onset of melting of the indium sample are determined and checked to be within<br><br><br>
0.5Â°C to 156.Ã³'C for the onset of melting and within 0.5 J/g to 28.71 J/g for the heat of fusion. Then deionized water is analyzed by cooling a small drop of fresh sample in the DSC pan from 25Â°C to -30'C at a cooling rate of lO'C/min. The sample is kept isothermally at -30Â°C for 2 minutes and heated to 30'C at a heating rate of 10Â°C/min. The onset of melting is determined and checked to be within 0.5Â°C to 0Â°C.<br>
[0037]	Polymer samples are pressed into a thin film at an initial temperature of 190Â°C<br>
(designated as the 'initial temperature'). About 5 to 8 mg of sample is weighed out and placed in the DSC pan. The lid is crimped on the pan to ensure a closed atmosphere. The DSC pan is placed in the DSC cell and then heated at a rate of about 100Â°C/min to a temperature (To) of about 60Â°C above the melt temperature of the sample. The sample is kept at this temperature for about 3 minutes. Then the sample is cooled at a rate of 10Â°C/min to -40Â°C, and kept isothermally at that temperature for 3 minutes. Consequently the sample is heated at a rate of 10Â°C/min until complete melting. Enthalpy curves resulting from this experiment are analyzed for peak melt temperature, onset and peak crystallization temperatures, heat of fusion and heat of crystallization, and any other DSC analyses of interest.<br>
[0038]	When crystallinity of a polymer containing propylene crystallinity is analyzed,<br>
To is 230'C. To is 190'C when polyethylene crystallinity is present and no polypropylene crystallinity is present in the sample.<br>
[0039]	Percent crystallinity by weight is calculated according to the following<br>
formula:   such that the heat of fusion (AH) is<br>
divided by the heat of fusion for the perfect polymer crystal (AHo) and then multiplied by 100%. For ethylene crystallinity, AHo is taken to be 290 J/g. For example, an ethylene-octene copolymer which upon melting of its polyethylene crystallinity is measured to have a heat of fusion of 29 J/g; the corresponding crystallinity is 10 % by weight. For propylene crystallinity, AHo is taken to be 165 J/g. For example, a propylene-ethylene copolymer which upon melting of its propylene crystallinity is measured to have a heat of fusion of 20 J/g; the corresponding crystallinity is 12.1 % by weight.<br><br><br>
[0040]	Foam<br>
[0041]	In  one  aspect,  embodiments  described  herein relate  to  a  crosslinked<br>
thermoplastic foam. In another aspect, embodiments disclosed herein relate to a crosslinked thermoplastic foam having a relatively high filler loading. Such foams, due to a high filler loading, are dimensionally stable and low in cost.<br>
[0042]	The crosslinked foams disclosed herein may be based on a polyolefin -<br>
polyolefin elastomer system, such as a blend of plastomer and elastomer components, such as alpha-olefin copolymers, olefin block copolymers, and ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymers. In selected embodiments, the polymer blends used may provide various mechanical properties, such as hardness, foam density, split tear, compression set, and shrinkage and abrasion resistance. The polymer components blended may have similar or dissimilar melt indices, crystallinity, and molecular weight distributions. In some embodiments, one polymer component may have a low crystallinity, such as less than about 21%, and a second polymer component may have a higher crystallinity, such as greater than about 21%.<br>
[0043]	Crosslinked foams disclosed herein may also include a low molecular weight<br>
polyolefin as a lubricant. The lubrication provided by such a component may allow for the processing of compositions having a high filler loading, such as up to about 50 weight percent of the crosslinked foam composition.<br>
[0044]	Such compositions as described above may be injection or compression<br>
molded to form crosslinked foams in some embodiments. In other embodiments, crosslinked foams disclosed herein may be formed via flat-die sheet extrusion. Such foams may also be reground and/or recycled to form similar end-use articles, such as footwear or shock pads.<br>
[0045]	Compositions used to form the foams described herein may contain semi-<br>
crystalline polymers and high filler loadings, and may still allow for industrial processing, such as compounding, injection molding, compression molding, etc. Both fillers and crystalline materials may generate excessive heat during processing due to shear or high melting temperatures. For controlled crosslinking and foaming, premature decomposition of any curing agents and blowing agents should be<br><br><br>
avoided, such as by proper selection of curing agents, blowing agents, and processing temperatures.<br>
[0046]	Additionally, it was found that higher temperature processing needed for<br>
higher density components and high filler content compositions may require the use of a scorch retarder, such as when using a peroxide curing system. The hotter processing allowed via the scorch retarder may also provide an advantage of decreased cycle times for such compositions and peroxide systems. In some embodiments, cycle times may be reduced by up to 40%.<br>

[0062]	Embodiments disclosed herein may also include a polymeric component that<br>
may include at least one multi-block olefin interpolymer. Suitable multi-block olefin interpolymers may include those described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/818,911, for example. The term "multi-block copolymer" or refers to a polymer comprising two or more chemically distinct regions or segments (referred to as "blocks") preferably joined in a linear marmer, that is, a polymer comprising chemically differentiated units which are joined end-to-end with respect to polymerized ethylenic functionality, rather than in pendent or grafted fashion. In<br><br><br>
certain embodiments, the blocks differ in the amount or type of comonomer<br>
incorporated therein, the density, the amount of crystallinity, the crystallite size<br>
attributable to a polymer of such composition, the type or degree of tacticity<br>
(isotactic or syndiotactic), regio-regularity or regio-irregularity, the amount of<br>
branching, including long chain branching or hyper-branching, the homogeneity, or<br>
any other chemical or physical property. The multi-block copolymers are<br>
characterized by unique distributions of polydispersity index (PDI or Mw/Mn), block<br>
length distribution, and/or block number distribution due to the unique process<br>
making of the copolymers. More specifically, when produced in a continuous<br>
process, embodiments of the polymers may possess a PDI ranging from about 1.7 to<br>
about 8; from about 1.7 to about 3.5 in other embodiments; from about 1.7 to about<br>
2.5 in other embodiments; and from about 1.8 to about 2.5 or from about 1.8 to<br>
about 2.1 in yet other embodiments. When produced in a batch or semi-batch<br>
process, embodiments of the polymers may possess a PDI ranging from about 1.0 to<br>
about 2.9; from about 1.3 to about 2.5 in other embodiments; from about 1.4 to<br>
about 2.0 in other embodiments; and from about 1.4 to about 1.8 in yet other<br>
embodiments.<br>
063]	One example of the multi-block olefin interpolymer is an ethylene/a-olefin<br>
block interpolymer. Another example of the multi-block olefin interpolymer is a<br>
propylene/a-olefin interpolymer. The following description focuses on the<br>
interpolymer as having ethylene as the majority monomer, but applies in a similar<br>
fashion to propylene-based multi-block interpolymers with regard to general<br>
polymer characteristics.<br>
064]	The ethylene/a-olefin multi-block interpolymers may comprise ethylene and<br>
one or more co-polymerizable a-olefin comonomers in polymerized form, characterized by multiple (Le., two or more) blocks or segments of two or more polymerized monomer units differing in chemical or physical properties (block interpolymer), preferably a multi-block interpolymer. In some embodiments, the multi-block interpolymer may be represented by the following formula:<br>
(AB)â where n is at least 1, preferably an integer greater than 1, such as 2, 3, 4, 5,10,15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90,100, or higher; "A" represents a hard block or segment; and "B" represents a soft block or segment. Preferably, A's and B's are linked in a linear<br><br><br>
fashion, not in a branched or a star fashion. "Hard" segments refer to blocks of<br>
polymerized units in which ethylene is present in an amount greater than 95 weight<br>
percent in some embodiments, and in other embodiments greater than 98 weight<br>
percent. In other words, the comonomer content in the hard segments is less than 5<br>
weight percent in some embodiments, and in other embodiments, less than 2 weight<br>
percent of the total weight of the hard segments. In some embodiments, the hard<br>
segments comprise all or substantially all ethylene. "Soft" segments, on the other<br>
hand, refer to blocks of polymerized units in which the comonomer content is greater<br>
than 5 weight percent of the total weight of the soft segments in some embodiments,<br>
greater than 8 weight percent, greater than 10 weight percent, or greater than 15<br>
weight percent in various other embodiments. In some embodiments, the comonomer<br>
content in the soft segments may be greater than 20 weight percent, greater than 25<br>
^	eight percent, greater than 30 weight percent, greater than 35 weight percent, greater<br>
than 40 weight percent, greater than 45 weight percent, greater than 50 weight<br>
percent, or greater than 60 weight percent in various other embodiments.<br>
[0065]	In some embodiments, A blocks and B blocks are randomly distributed along<br>
the polymer chain.   In other words, the block copolymers do not have a structure<br>
Uke: <br>
[0066]	In other embodiments, the block copolymers do not have a third block. In still<br>
other embodiments, neither block A nor block B comprises two or more segments (or sub-blocks), such as a tip segment.<br>
[0067]	The multi-block interpolymers may be characterized by an average block<br>
index, ABI, ranging from greater than zero to about 1.0 and a molecular weight distribution, Mw/Mn, greater than about 1.3. The average block index, ABI, is the weight average of the block index ("BI") for each of the polymer fractions obtained in preparative TREF from 20Â°C and 110Â°C, with an increment of 5Â°C:<br>
where BI2 is the block index for the ith fraction of the multi-block interpolymer obtained in preparative TREF, and wi is the weight percentage of the i* fraction.<br><br><br>
[0068]	Similarly, the square root of the second moment about the mean, hereinafter<br>
referred to as the second moment weight average block index, may be defined as follows:<br><br>
[0069]	For each polymer fraction, BI is defined by one of the two following equations<br>
(both of which give the same BI value):<br><br>
where Tx is the analytical temperature rising elution fractionation (ATREF) elution<br>
temperature for the ith fraction (preferably expressed in Keivin), Px is the ethylene<br>
mole fraction for the ith fraction, which may be measured by NMR or IR as described<br>
below. PAB is the ethylene mole fraction of the whole ethylene/Î±-olefin interpolymer<br>
(before fractionation), which also may be measured by NMR or IR. TA and PA are the<br>
ATREF elution temperature and the ethylene mole fraction for pure "hard segments"<br>
(which refer to the crystalline segments of the interpolymer). As an approximation or<br>
for polymers where the "hard segment" composition is unknown, the TA and PA<br>
values are set to those for high density polyethylene homopolymer.<br>
[0070]	TAB is the ATREF elution temperature for a random copolymer of the same<br>
composition (having an ethylene mole fraction of PAB) and molecular weight as the<br>
multi-block interpolymer. TAB may be calculated from the mole fraction of ethylene<br>
(measured by NMR) using the following equation:<br><br>
where a and Î² are two constants which may be determined by a calibration using a number of well characterized preparative TREF fractions of a broad composition random copolymer and/or well characterized random ethylene copolymers with narrow composition. It should be noted that Î± and Î² may vary from instrument to instrument. Moreover, one would need to create an appropriate calibration curve with the polymer composition of interest, using appropriate molecular weight ranges and comonomer type for the preparative TREF fractions and/or random copolymers used to create the calibration. There is a slight molecular weight effect. If the calibration curve is obtained from similar molecular weight ranges, such effect would be<br><br><br>
essentially negligible.   In some embodiments, random ethylene copolymers and/or preparative TREF fractions of random copolymers satisfy the following relationship:<br>
Ln P = -237.83/rATOEF + 0.639<br>
[0071]	The above calibration equation relates the mole fraction of ethylene, P, to the<br>
analytical TREF elution temperature, TATREFÂ» for narrow composition random copolymers and/or preparative TREF fractions of broad composition random copolymers. Txo is the ATREF temperature for a random copolymer of the same composition and having an ethylene mole fraction of Px. Txo may be calculated from LnPx = a/Txo + P- Conversely, Pxo is the ethylene mole fraction for a random copolymer of the same composition and having an ATREF temperature of Tx, which may be calculated from Ln Pxo = Î±/Tx + Î².<br>
[0072]	Once the block index (BI) for each preparative TREF fraction is obtained, the<br>
weight average block index, ABI, for the whole polymer may be calculated. In some embodiments, ABI is greater than zero but less than about 0.4 or from about 0.1 to about 0.3. In other embodiments, ABI is greater than about 0.4 and up to about 1.0. Preferably, ABI should be in the range of from about 0.4 to about 0.7, from about 0.5 to about 0.7, or from about 0.6 to about 0.9. In some embodiments, ABI is in the range of from about 0.3 to about 0.9, from about 0.3 to about 0.8, or from about 0.3 to about 0.7, from about 0.3 to about 0.6, from about 0.3 to about 0.5, or from about 0.3 to about 0.4. In other embodiments, ABI is in the range of from about 0.4 to about 1.0, from about 0.5 to about 1.0, or from about 0.6 to about 1.0, from about 0.7 to about 1.0, from about 0.8 to about 1.0, or from about 0.9 to about 1.0.<br>
[0073]	Another characteristic of the muiti-block interpolymer is that the interpolymer<br>
may comprise at least one polymer fraction which may be obtained by preparative TREF, wherein the fraction has a block index greater than about 0.1 and up to about 1.0 and the polymer having a molecular weight distribution, Mw/Mn, greater than about 1.3. In some embodiments, the polymer fraction has a block index greater than about 0.6 and up to about 1.0, greater than about 0.7 and up to about 1.0, greater than about 0.8 and up to about 1.0, or greater than about 0.9 and up to about 1.0. In other embodiments, the polymer fraction has a block index greater than about 0.1 and up to about 1.0, greater than about 0.2 and up to about 1.0, greater than about 0.3 and up to about 1.0, greater than about 0.4 and up to about 1.0, or<br><br><br>
greater than about 0.4 and up to about 1.0. In still other embodiments, the polymer fraction has a block index greater than about 0.1 and up to about 0.5, greater than about 0.2 and up to about 0.5, greater than about 0.3 and up to about 0.5, or greater than about 0.4 and up to about 0.5. In yet other embodiments, the polymer fraction has a block index greater than about 0.2 and up to about 0.9, greater than about 0.3 and up to about 0.8, greater than about 0.4 and up to about 0.7, or greater than about 0.5 and up to about 0.6.<br>
[0074]	Ethylene a-olefin multi-block interpolymers used in embodiments of the<br>
invention may be interpolymers of ethylene with at least one C3-C20 a-olefin. The interpolymers may further comprise C4-C18 diolefin and/or alkenylbenzene. Suitable unsaturated comonomers useful for polymerizing with ethylene include, for example, ethylenically unsaturated monomers, conjugated or non-conjugated dienes, polyenes, alkenylbenzenes, etc. Examples of such comonomers include C.-Cjp a-olefins such as propylene, isobutylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-pentene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, 1-nonene, 1-decene, and the like. 1-Butene and 1-octene are especially preferred. Other suitable monomers include styrene, halo- or alkyl-substituted styrenes, vinylbenzocyclobutane, 1,4-hexadiene, 1,7-octadiene, and naphthenics (such as cyclopentene, cyclohexene, and cyclooctene, for example).<br>
[0075]	The multi-block interpolymers disclosed herein may be differentiated from<br>
conventional, random copolymers, physical blends of polymers, and block copolymers prepared via sequential monomer addition, fluxional catalysts, and anionic or cationic living polymerization techniques. In particular, compared to a random copolymer of the same monomers and monomer content at equivalent crystallinity or modulus, the interpolymers have better (higher) heat resistance as measured by melting point, higher TMA penetration temperature, higher high-temperature tensile strength, and/or higher high-temperature torsion storage modulus as determined by dynamic mechanical analysis. Properties of infill may benefit from the use of embodiments of the multi-block interpolymers, as compared to a random copolymer containing the same monomers and monomer content, the multi-block interpolymers have lower compression set, particularly at elevated temperatures, lower stress relaxation, higher creep resistance, higher tear strength, higher blocking resistance, faster setup due to higher crystallization (solidification)<br><br><br>
temperature, higher recovery (particularly at elevated temperatures), better abrasion resistance, higher retractive force, and better oil and filler acceptance.<br>
[0076]	Other olefin interpolymers include polymers comprising monovinylidene<br>
aromatic monomers including styrene, o-methyl styrene, p-methyl styrene, t-butylstyrene, and the like. In particular, interpolymers comprising ethylene and styrene may be used. In other embodiments, copolymers comprising ethylene, styrene and a C3-C20 Î± olefin, optionally comprising a C4-C20 diene, may be used.<br>
[0077]	Suitable   non-conjugated   diene   monomers   may   include   straight   chain,<br>
branched chain or cyclic hydrocarbon diene having from 6 to 15 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable non-conjugated dienes include, but are not limited to, straight chain acyclic dienes, such as 1,4-hexadiene, 1,6-octadiene, 1,7-octadiene, 1,9-decadiene, branched chain acyclic dienes, such as 5-methyl-l,4-hexadiene; 3,7-dimethyl-l,6-octadiene; 3,7-dimethyl-l,7-octadiene and mixed isomers of dihydromyricene and dihydroocinene, single ring alicyclic dienes, such as 1,3-cyclopentadiene; 1,4-cyc1ohexadiene; 1,5-cyclooctadiene and 1,5-cyclododecadiene, and multi-ring aÃ¼cyclic fused and bridged ring dienes, such as tetrahydroindene, methyl tetrahydroindene, dicyclopentadiene, bicyclo-(2,2,l)-hepta-2,5-diene; alkenyl, alkylidene, cycloalkenyl and cycloalkylidene norbomenes, such as 5-methylene-2-norbomene (MNB); 5-propenyl-2-norbomene, 5-isopropylidene-2-norbomene, 5-(4-cyclopentenyl)-2-norbomene, 5-cyclohexylidene-2-norbomene, 5-vinyl-2-norbomene, and norbomadiene. Of the dienes typically used to prepare EPDMs, the particularly preferred dienes are 1,4-hexadiene (HD), 5-ethylidene-2-norbomene (ENB), 5-vinylidene-2-norbomene (VNB), 5-methylene-2-norbomene (MNB), and dicyclopentadiene (DCPD).<br>

Preferred Î±-olefins for use in this embodiment are designated by the formula CH2=CHR*, where R* is a linear or branched alkyl group of from 1 to 12 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable a-olefins include, but are not limited to, propylene, isobutylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, and 1-octene.

generally referred to in the art as EP or EPDM polymers.

The foam of the invention may contain filler materials in amounts, depending on the application for which they are designed, ranging from about 20-100 percent (dry basis) of the weight of the polymer component. These optional ingredients may include, but are not limited to, calcium carbonate, titanium dioxide powder, polymer particles, hollow glass spheres, polymeric fibers such as polyolefin based staple monofilaments and the like.<br>
[0093]	For  example,   additives   may  include   a  wetting  agent,  fire   retardants,<br>
surfactants, anti-static agents, anti block agents, wax-based dispersions, pigments, neutralizing agents, thickeners, compatibilizers, brighteners, rheology modtfiers, biocides, fungicides, reinforcing fibers, and other additives known to those skilled in the art. While optional for purposes of the present invention, other components may be highly advantageous for product stabÃ¼ity during and after the manufacturing process.<br>
[0094]	Additives may be included in any formulation comprising the above described<br>
polymers, copolymers, interpolymers, and multi-block interpolymers.

Silane-based or other coupling agents may also be employed for better filler bonding.<br>
[0095]	The foams, polymers, and polymer blend compositions described above may<br>
contain processing oils, plasticizers, and processing aids. Rubber processing oils having a certain ASTM designation and paraffinic, napthenic or aromatic process oils are all suitable for use. Generally from O to 150 parts, more preferably O to 100 parts, and most preferably from 0 to 50 parts of processing oils, plasticizers, and/or processing aids per 100 parts of total polymer are employed. Higher amounts of oil may tend to improve the processing of the resulting product at the expense of some physical properties. Additional processing aids include conventional waxes, fatty acid salts, such as calcium stearate or zinc stearate, (poly)alcohols including glycols, (poly)alcohol ethers, including glycol ethers, (poly)esters, including (poly)glycol esters, and metal salt-, especially Group 1 or 2 metal or zinc-, salt derivatives thereof.<br>
[0096]	For conventional TPO, TPV, and TPE applications, carbon black is one<br>
additive useful for UV absorption and stabilizing properties. Representative examples of carbon blacks include ASTM NllO, N121, N220, N231, N234, N242, N293, N299, S315, N326, N330, M332, N339, N343, N347, N351, N358, N375, N539, N550, N582, N630, N642, N650, N683, N754, N762, N765, N774, N787, N907, N908, N990 and N991. These carbon blacks have iodine absorptions ranging from 9 to 145 g/kg and average pore volumes ranging from 10 to 150 cm'^/lOO g. Generally, smaller particle sized carbon blacks are employed, to the extent cost considerations permit. For many such applications the present polymers and blends thereof require little or no carbon black, thereby allowing considerable design freedom to include altemative pigments or no pigments at all.<br><br><br>
[0097]	Compositions, including thermoplastic blends according to embodiments<br>
disclosed herein may also contain anti-ozonants or anti-oxidants that are known to a rubber chemist of ordinary skill. The anti-ozonants may be physical protectants such as waxy materials that come to the surface and protect the part from oxygen or ozone or they may be chemical protectors that react with oxygen or ozone. Suitable Chemical protectors include styrenated phenols, butylated octylated phenol, butylated di(dimethylbenzyl) phenol, p-phenylenediamines, butylated reaction products of p-cresol and dicyclopentadiene (DCPD), polyphenoÃ¼c anitioxidants, hydroquinone derivatives, quinoline, diphenylene antioxidants, thioester antioxidants, and blends thereof.

In some applications, the anti-oxidants and anti-ozonants used wiU preferably be non-staining and non-migratory.<br>
[0098]	For providing additional stability against UV radiation, hindered amine light<br>
stabilizers (HALS) and UV absorbers may be also used. Suitable examples include TINUVINâ¢ 123, TINUVINâ¢ 144, TINUVINâ¢ 622, TINUVINâ¢ 765, TINUVINâ¢ 770, and TINUVINâ¢ 780, available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals, and CHEMISORBâ¢ T944, available from Cytex Plastics, Houston TX, USA. A Lewis acid may be additionally included with a HALS compound in order to achieve superior surface quality, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,051,681. Other embodiments may include a heat stabilizer, such as IRGANOXTM PS 802 FL, for example.<br>
[0099]	For some compositions, additional mixing processes may be employed to pre-<br>
disperse the heat stabilizers, anti-oxidants, anti-ozonants, carbon black, UV absorbers, and/or light stabilizers to form a masterbatch, and subsequently to form polymer blends therefrom.<br>
[00100]	In some embodiments, additives may also include processing aids such as<br>
stearates and stearic acids, perfumes, algae inhibitors, anti-microbiological and anti-fungus agents, flame retardants and halogen-free flame retardants, as well as slip and anti-block additives.    Other embodiments may include PDMS to decrease the<br><br><br>
abrasion resistance of the polymer. Adhesion of the polymer may also be improved through the use of adhesion promoters or functionalization or coupling of the polymer with organosilane, polychloroprene (neoprene), or other grafting agents.<br>
[00101]	Curing Agents<br>
[00102]	Suitable crosslinking agents (also referred to as curing or vulcanizing agents)<br>
for use herein include silane based compounds, sulfur based, peroxide based, or phenolic based compounds. Examples of the foregoing materials are found in the art, including in U.S. Patents No.: 3,758,643, 3,806,558, 5,051,478, 4,104,210, 4,130,535, 4,202,801, 4,271,049, 4,340,684, 4,250,273, 4,927,882, 4,311,628 and 5,248,729. One example of a peroxide curing agent is PERKADOX 14-40bd, available from Akzo Nobel.<br>
[00103]	When sulfur based curing agents are employed, accelerators and cure<br>
activators may be used as well. Accelerators are used to control the time and/or temperature required for dynamic vulcanization and to improve the properties of the resulting cross-linked article. In one embodiment, a single accelerator or primary accelerator is used. The primary accelerator(s) may be used in total amounts ranging from about 0.5 to about 4, preferably about 0.8 to about 1.5 phr, based on total composition weight. In another embodiment, combinations of a primary and a secondary accelerator might be used with the secondary accelerator being used in smaller amounts, such as from about 0.05 to about 3 phr, in order to activate and to improve the properties of the cured article. Combinations of accelerators generaUy produce articles having properties that are somewhat better than those produced by use of a single accelerator. In addition, delayed action accelerators may be used which are not affected by normal processing temperatures yet produce a satisfactory cure at ordinary vulcanization temperatures. Vulcanization retarders might also be used. Suitable types of accelerators that may be used in the present invention are amines, disulfides, guanidines, thioureas, thiazoles, thiurams, sulfenamides, dithiocarbamates and xanthates. Preferably, the primary accelerator is a sulfenamide. If a second accelerator is used, the secondary accelerator is preferably a guanidine, dithiocarbamate or thiuram compound. Certain processing aids and cure activators such as stearic add and ZnO may also be used. When peroxide based curing agents are used, co-activators or coagents may be used in combination therewith. Suitable<br><br><br>
coagents include trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA), trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate (TMPTMA), triallyl cyanurate (TAC), triallyl isocyanurate (TAIC), among others. Use of peroxide crosslinkers and optional coagents used for partial or complete dynamic vulcanization are known in the art and disclosed for example in the publication, "Peroxide Vulcanization of Elastomer", Vol. 74, No 3, July-August 2001.<br>
[00104]	When the polymer composition is at least partially crosslinked, the degree of<br>
crosslinking may be measured by dissolving the composition in a solvent for specified duration, and calculating the percent gel or unextractable component. The percent gel normally increases with increasing crosslinking levels. For cured articles according to embodiments of the invention, the percent gel content is desirably in the range from 5 to 100 weight percent, as measured using xylene extractables; at least 30 weight percent gel in other embodiments; and up to 90 weight percent gel in yet other embodiments.<br>
[00105]	Blowing Agent and Related Additives<br>
[00106]	Blowing agents suitable for use in forming the foams described herein may be<br>
physical blowing agents, which are typically the same material as the fugitive gas, e.g., CO2, or a chemical blowing agent, which produces the fugitive gas. More than one physical or chemical blowing agent may be used and physical and chemical blowing agents may be used together.<br>
[00107]	Physical blowing agents useful in the present invention include any naturally<br>
occurring atmospheric material which is a vapor at the temperature and pressure at which the foam exits the die. The physical blowing agent may be introduced, i.e., injected into the polymeric material as a gas, a supercritical fluid, or liquid, preferably as a supercritical fluid or liquid, most preferably as a liquid. The physical blowing agents used will depend on the properties sought in the resulting foam articles. Other factors considered in choosing a blowing agent are its toxicity, vapor pressure profile, ease of handling, and solubÃ¼ity with regard to the polymeric materials used. Non-flammable, non-toxic, non-ozone depleting blowing are preferred because they are easier to use, e.g., fewer environmental and safety concerns, and are generally less soluble in thermoplastic polymers. Suitable physical blowing agents include, e.g., carbon dioxide, nitrogen, SF.sub.6, nitrous<br><br><br>
oxide, perfluorinated fluids, such as C2F6, argon, helium, noble gases, such as xenon, air (nitrogen and oxygen blend), and blends of these materials.<br>
[00108]	Chemical blowing agents that may be used in the present invention include,<br>
e.g., a sodium bicarbonate and citric acid blend, dinitrosopentamethylenetetramine,<br>
p-toluenesulfonyl	hydrazide,	4-4'-oxybis(benzenesulfonyl	hydrazide,<br>
azodicarbonamide (l,r-azobisformamide), p-toluenesulfonyl semicarbazide, 5-phenyltetrazole, 5-phenyltetrazole analogues, diisopropylhydrazodicarboxylate, 5-phenyl-3,6-dihydro-l,3,4-oxadiazin-2-one, and sodium borohydride. Preferably, the blowing agents are, or produce, one or more fugitive gases having a vapor pressure of greater than 0.689 MPa at 0Â°C. CELOGEN AZ130 is an azodicarbonamide Chemical blowing agent commercially available from Uniroyal Chemical Co., Middleburry, CN.<br>
[00109]	The total amount of the blowing agent used depends on conditions such as<br>
extrusion-process conditions at mixing, the blowing agent being used, the composition of the extrudate, and the desired density of the foamed article. The extrudate is defined herein as including the blowing agent blend, a polyolefin resin(s), and any additives. For a foam having a density of from about 1 to about 15 Ib/ft, the extrudate typically comprises from about 18 to about 1 wt % of blowing agent. In other embodiments, 1% to 10% of blowing agent may be used.<br>
[00110]	The blowing agent blend used in the present invention comprises less than<br>
about 99 mol % isobutane. The blowing agent blend generally comprises from about 10 mol % to about 60 or 75 mol % isopentane. The blowing agent blend more typically comprises from about 15 mol % to about 40 mol % isopentane. More specifically, the blowing agent blend comprises from about 25 or 30 mol % to about 40 mol % isobutane. The blowing agent blend generally comprises at least about 15 or 30 mol % of co-blowing agent(s). More specifically, the blowing agent blend comprises from about 40 to about 85 or 90 mol % of co-blowing agent(s). The blowing agent blend more typically comprises from about 60 mol % to about 70 or 75 mol % of co-blowing agent(s).<br>
[00111]	A nucleating agent or combination of such agents may be employed in the<br>
present invention for advantages, such as its capability for regulating cell formation and morphology.    A nucleating agent, or cell size control agent, may be any<br><br><br>
conventional or useful nucleating agent(s). The amount of nucleating agent used depends upon the desired cell size, the selected blowing agent blend, and the desired foam density. The nucleating agent is generally added in amounts from about 0.02 to about 20 wt % of the polyolefin resin composition.<br>
[00112]	Some contemplated nucleating agents include inorganic materials (in small<br>
particulate form), such as clay, talc, silica, and diatomaceous earth. Other contemplated nucleating agents include organic nucleating agents that decompose or react at the heating temperature within an extruder to evolve gases, such as carbon dioxide, water, and/or nitrogen. One example of an organic nucleating agent is a combination of an alkali metal salt of a polycarboxylic acid with a carbonate or bicarbonate. Some examples of alkali metal salts of a polycarboxylic acid include, but are not limited to, the monosodium salt of 2,3-dihydroxy-butanedioic acid (commonly referred to as sodium hydrogen tartrate), the monopotassium salt of butanedioic acid (commonly referred to as potassium hydrogen succinate), the trisodium and tripotassium salts of 2-hydroxy-l,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid (commonly referred to as sodium and potassium citrate, respectively), and the disodium salt of ethanedioic acid (commonly referred to as sodium oxalate), or polycarboxylic acid such as 2-hydroxy-l,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid. Some examples of a carbonate or a bicarbonate include, but are not limited to, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, and calcium carbonate.<br>
[00113]	It is contemplated that mixtures of different nucleating agents may be added in<br>
the present invention. Some more desirable nucleating agents include talc, crystalline silica, and a stoichiometric mixture of citric acid and sodium bicarbonate (the stoichiometric mixture having a 1 to 100 percent concentration where the carrier is a suitable polymer such as polyethylene). Talc may be added in a carrier or in a powder form.<br>
[00114]	Gas permeation agents or stability control agents may be employed in the<br>
present invention to assist in preventing or inhibiting collapsing of the foam. The stability control agents suitable for use in the present invention may include the partial esters of long-chain fatty acids with polyols described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,644,230, saturated higher alkyl amines,  saturated higher fatty acid amides,<br><br><br>
complete esters of higher fatty acids such as these described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,214,054, and combinations thereof described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,750,584.<br>
[00115]	The partial esters of fatty acids that may be desired as a stability control agent<br>
include the members of the generic class known as surface active agents or surfactants. A preferred class of surfactants includes a partial ester of a fatty acid having 12 to 18 carbon atoms and a polyol having three to six hydroxyl groups. More preferably, the partial esters of a long chain fatty acid with a polyol component of the stability control agent are glycerol monostearate, glycerol distearate or mixtures thereof. It is contemplated that other gas permeation agents or stability control agents may be employed in the present invention to assist in preventing or inhibiting collapsing of the foam.<br>
[00116]	Scorch Retarder<br>
[00117]	Examples of scorch retarders that may be used in embodiments disclosed<br>
herein include maleic anhydride, salicylic acid, bis triethoxy silyl ethane, N-cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazole sulfenamide, hydroquinone monomethyl ether, and others as may be known in the art. Commercially available scorch retarders may include H-TEMPO, available from AH Marks, and HP136, available from Ciba.<br>
[00118]	Elastomeric Foams<br>
[00119]	Foam sheets according to embodiments disclosed herein may include a single<br>
layer or multiple layers as desired. The foam articles may be produced in any marmer so as to result in at least one foam layer. The foam layers described herein may be made by a pressurized melt processing method such as an extrusion method. The extruder may be a tandem system, a single screw extruder, a twin screw extruder, etc. The extruder may be equipped with multilayer annular dies, flat film dies and feedblocks, multi-layer feedblocks such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,908,278 (Bland et al.), multi-vaned or multi-manifold dies such as a 3-layer vane die available from Cloeren, Orange, Tex. A foamable composition may also be made by combining a chemical blowing agent and polymer at a temperature below the decomposition temperature of the chemical blowing agent, and then later foamed. In some embodiments, the foam may be coextruded with one or more barrier layers.<br><br><br>
[00120]	One method of producing the foams described herein is by using an extruder,<br>
as mentioned above. In this case, the foamable mixture (polymer, filler, blowing agent, etc, as desired,) is extruded. As the mixture exits an extruder die and upon exposure to reduced pressure, the fugitive gas nucleates and forms cells within the polymer to create a foam article. The resulting foam article may then be deposited onto a temperature-controlled casting drum. The casting drum speed (i.e., as produced by the drum RPM) can affect the overall thickness of the foam article. As the casting roll speed increases, the overall thickness of the foam article can decrease. However, the barrier layer thickness at the die exit, which is where foaming occurs, is the diffusion length for the system. As the foam article is stretched and quenched on the casting drum, the barrier layer thickness may decrease until the foam article solidifies. In other words, it is the barrier layer diffusion length (i.e., thickness) at the die exit that is the important factor in controlling the diffusion of the fugitive gas.<br>
[00121]	A second  method  of producing  foams  described  herein  may  include<br>
compounding or melt kneading of the components (polymers, fillers, blowing agent, etc, as desired), such as in an extruder or melt kneader, to form an expandable composition. The expandable composition may then be injection molded into a hot mold, such as by using a MAIN Group S.P.A. injection molding machine for crossHnked foams, model E166S. FoUowing injection of the mixture into the mold, the mold temperature may be raised to and/or maintained at a temperature sufficiÃ«nt to decompose the blowing agent. The mold may then be opened to allow for sudden bubble nucleation and foam expansion. Expansion of the foam plaques thus formed may be in the range of about 60 percent after 24 hours.<br>
[00122]	Foams formed by the above described methods may be crosslinked using a<br>
peroxide curing agent in some embodiments. In other embodiments, the foams may be crosslinked using a heat activated curing system. Heat activated curing systems may include at least one based on sulfur or an epoxy. Heat activated curing systems and peroxide curing agents may be combined with the other components during processing to provide for the crosslinking of the foams. In some embodiments, the foams may be crosslinked using a radiation induced curing system. Radiation activated curing may include at least one of e-beaming and gamma radiation.<br><br><br>
Radiation activated curing may be performed, in some embodiments, after the fonnation of a foam by the above-described methods.<br>
[00123]	One skilied in the art will appreciate that other methods of producing the<br>
foams disclosed herein may also be used.<br>

[00137]	Shock absorption<br>
[00138]	Principle: A mass (20Kgs) falls, as discussed in the FIFA Quality Concept<br>
Manual (March 2006 Edition), which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. The maximum force applied is recorded. The % reduction in this force relative to the maximum force measured on a concrete surface is reported as "Force Reduction." The FIFA requirements for force reduction are as follows:<br><br><br><br>
[00139]	Vertical deformation<br>
[00140]	Principle A mass is allowed to fall onto a spring that rests and the maximum<br>
deformation of the surface is determined. The FIFA requirements for vertical deformation are as follows:<br>
FIFA 2 Star:	4mm - 8mm<br>
FIFA 1 Star :	4mm - 9mm<br>
[00141]	EXAMPLES<br>
[00142]	In the following examples, compositions may include a green masterbatch,<br>
used to add color to the resuhing composition or product. All references to "green masterbatch" are to a composition having the following formulation:<br><br><br>
[00145]	Screening data suggest that foam at 200 kg/m3 and 10 mm thickness meet the<br>
desired FIFA standards. Mechanical properties for foams made from the fonnulations presented in Table 1 are given in Table 2. The performance of the crosslinked polyethylene foams for use as shockpads, the results of which are presented in Table 3. Sample testing is performed as follows.<br>
[00146]	Density is measured according to the Archimedes method for the density of<br>
foamed sheets. Hardness is measured according to ISO 868 (Shore A / 3 sec). Shrinkage is measured according to SATRA PM70 (70Â°C / 1 h). Compression set is measured according to SATRA TM64 (50% / 23Â°C / 24 h - 50% / 50Â°C / 6 h).<br>
[00147]	Samples 2.5 to 5 cm wide by 5 cm deep are cut from sheets of the foam. To<br>
measure compressive stress-strain behavior, the samples are inserted between the centers of the compressive plates. The thickness direction of the foam is aligned parallel to crosshead movement. A pre-load of 2.5 N was applied at 5 mm/min, and the crosshead position is re-zeroed.  The sample is then compressed at 10 mm/min<br><br>
until the load approached the capacity of the load cell. Stress is calculated by dividing the measured compressive force by the product of the width and depth of the foam. Stress is quantified in units of megapascals (MPa). Strain in terms of percent is calculated by dividing the crosshead displacement by the starting thickness of the foam and multiplying by one hundred.<br>
[00148]	To measure the compressive hysteresis behavior, a foam sample is loaded into<br>
the Instron in the same manner as above. A pre-load of 2.5N is applied at 5 mm/min, and the crosshead position is re-zeroed. Then the sample is compressed at 10 mm/min until the stress reaches 0.38 MPA, designated as the compression step. Immediately, the crosshead is then reversed until a load of 0.0038MPa is reached, designated as decompression. Without interruption, the sample is compressed and decompressed for 10 cycles.<br>
[00149]	To measure the compressive creep behavior, a foam sample is loaded into the<br>
Instron in the same marmer as above, except that the environmental chamber is in place and preheated to a temperature of 65Â°C. The sample is placed in between the compression plates, at 65 Â°C. After allowing the foam sample to equilibrate inside the chamber for one hour, a pre-load of 2.5 N is applied at 5 mm/min, and the crosshead position is re-zeroed. Load is then applied at 0.16 MPa. Crosshead position is then adjusted automatically by the Instron computer, to maintain a stress of 0.16 MPa for 12 hours. Compressive strain versus time is measured, the results of which are presented in Figures 3 and 3c. After 12 hours, the crosshead returns to its starting position. After another two hours, the foam is removed and allowed to cool to ambient conditions (20Â°C, 50% relative humidity). The foam thickness is then re-measured. The corresponding strain is designated "strain at release, 2 hr." The compressive creep behavior test results are presented in Figure 4.<br>
[00150]	To measure the energy absorption behavior of the foams FIFA quality concept<br>
methodology as described in the "March 2006 FIFA Quality Concept Requirements for Artificial Turf Surfaces," the FIFA handbook of test methods and requirements for artificial football turf, which is fully incorporated herein by reference.<br><br><br><br>
[00151]	Synthetic turf, using embodiments of the present invention, is shown in Figure<br>
1. Specifically, a crosslinked polythene foam having a high filler loading is provided as a shock absorption layer, which may be bonded to a backing. Artificial grass is attached to the backing, and the spaces between the grass may be filled with an infill. In addition, embodiments of the present invention may be useful for any field that may use artificial turf, such as rugby and field hockey.<br>
[00152]	The performance of the crosslinked polyethylene foams for use in an artificial<br>
turf system is also investigated, the results of which are presented in Table 4. Sample testing is performed as described above.<br><br>
[00153]	Tables 2 and 3 above summarize the effect of ENGAGE / LDPE / filler levels<br>
on the properties of the resulting shockpads. K ENGAGE is 80 phr or greater (Sample 5), then vertical deformation is too high (a bouncy foam). If no ENGAGE is present (Samples 8 and 9), the foam is too hard and permanently deforms after the first impact. Samples 1-4 and 6-7 perform well in the application according to the FIFA tests.<br><br><br>
[00154]	Cyclic loading tests are perfonned in stress-controlled mode to simulate<br>
repeated loads of 0.9 MPa which is similar to the load applied by the FQC tests. A high strain rate of about 120 min-1 is used. Cyclic loading tests are perfonned on an MTS 810 (available from MTS Systems Corporation, Eden Prairie, MN), 100 kN load frame, equipped with a controller and a data acquisition card. A linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) (-150 to +150 mm) calibrated in the 0.5 mm range is used to measure sample displacement. A load cell (MTS 25 kN), calibrated in the 10 kN range is used to measure load applied to the sample. The contactor (the load piston applying the load to the sample) is a rounded cylinder 70 mm in diameter having a hemispherical radius of curvature of 500 mm. Once the sample is in place, the load piston is moved as close to the sample as possible to determine the zero position, from which deformation is measured. The zero position is determined where a load of 200 N is placed on the sample (20 kg mass resting on the sample, comparable to the FIFA zeroing method). The sample is then displaced to a desired load, such as 3500 N, total displacement is measured, the load is withdrawn from the sample, and the energy stored and released from the sample is calculated. The loading and unloading is repeated at a selected frequency, such as l/s, for a desired number of cycles. Because of permanent displacement and changes in displacement over numerous cycles, the loading during each cycle is perfonned in a regulated manner so as not to overload the sample. The cyclic loading tests may be performed at any temperature in the range from about 15Â°C to about 70Â°C, and are performed at room temperature and at 55Â°C in these experiments.<br>
[00155]	Cyclic loading tests, as described above, provide insights into the permanent<br>
indentation and release energy of the foam sample after repeated shocks at high strain rates. The performance of the foam of Sample 6 is compared to non-crosslinked foams (both at room temperature) in Figure 2.<br>
[00156]	As shown in Figure 2, foam density is a key parameter driving the permanent<br>
indentation, with an non-crosslinked PE foam with 64 kg/m^ density "PE(p) 64-10" coUapsing and not able to reach 0.9 MPa after 200 cycles while "PE(p) 144-10" (uncrosslinked PE foam with 144 kg/m3 density) lasting longer. The foam formed from Sample 6 shows less permanent indentation, reaching a plateau after 1200 cycles. Foam sample PE(x,p,r) 144-15 is a foam sample commercially available and cunently being installed in pitches. Thus Sample 6 performs similar or better than<br><br><br>
each of the comparative foam samples (the lower the permanent indentation, the better the foam is for the application), especially after a high number of cycles.<br>
[00157]	Samples 10-12 and Comparative Sample 13<br>

LLDPE plastics and LLDPE elastomers. Polyethylenes and other materials used to form the foams of Samples 10-12 are as stated below. In addition, Comparative Sample 13 is formed from an EVA compound. Table 5 shows different formulations for crosslinked foams including their measured material properties on injection molded test plaques. These Samples show a variation in filler level.<br>
[00159]	Materials used to form the foams of Samples 10-12 and Comparative Sample<br>

[00160]	Compounding of materials for Samples 10-12 and Comparative Sample 13 is performed with a BUSS Kneader, Model MDK, equipped with a 46 mm diameter screw of 15 L/D ratio by mixing the ingredients as given in Table 5.   The screw temperature is set at 50Â°C, while the three heating zones were set at 70, 75 and 75 Â°C. The polymer is fed from the first feeding port, while all other ingredients are added through the second feeding port further downstream. The throughput rate is set to lOkg/h. The highest polymer temperature recorded during compounding is 140Â°C. The melt stream emerging from the compounded is palletized using a hot-blade cutter.<br><br>
[00161]	Consecutively, foams are prepared by injection molding into a hot mold usinga MAIN group S.P.A. injection molding machine for crosslinked foams, model E166S, equipped with a rectangular mold of 22xl5x0.8cm in size. For injection, the injector screw barrel is set at a temperature of 110,115, 120, and 130 C for zones 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The mold temperature is kept at 185Â°C with the mold providing a clamping force of 100kN.<br><br>
[00162]	After injection the melt is kept in the mold for a specific period of time to allow for curing of the crosslinkable composition and decomposition of the blowing agent. Samples remain in the mold from 4 to 12 minutes curing time as given in Table 5. By opening the mold, which allows for sudden bubble nucleation and foam expansion, the foam plaques are ejected. The foams are then cooled at room conditions. Desired expansion of the foam plaques lies at 60 Â± 2 % after 24h. Properties of the foams are measured no earlier than 48 hours day after molding. The properties of foams are measured with methods described in Table 6, and the results of the measurements are given in Table 7.<br><br><br><br><br>
[00163]	As compared to Comparative Sample 13: Sample 10 has a similar density and<br>
comparable properties, but at much higher filler level; Sample 11 shows variability in properties (foam hardness, etc.) by using the same system in different combination than in Sample 10; and for Sample 12, at the same filler level and lower density, Sample 12 has improved properties, in particular in shrinkage, tear and elevated temperature compression set.<br><br>
