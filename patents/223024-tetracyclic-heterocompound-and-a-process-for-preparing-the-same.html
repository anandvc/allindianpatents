This application claims the benefit of U. S. Provisional Application<br>
60/341,957, filed on December 19,2001, which is incorporated by reference<br>
herein in its entirety.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to novel heteroatom containing<br>
tetracyclic derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, their use<br>
in the treatment of disorders mediated by one or more estrogen receptors and<br>
processes for their preparation. The compounds of the invention are thus<br>
useful for the treatment and/or prevention of disorders associated with estrogen<br>
depletion (including, but not limited to hot flashes, vaginal dryness, osteopenia,<br>
osteoporosis, hyperlipidemia, loss of cognitive function, degenerative brain<br>
diseases, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases); for the treatment of<br>
hormone sensitive cancers and hyperplasia (in tissues including breast,<br>
endometrium, and cervix in women and prostate in men); for the treatment and<br>
prevention of endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and osteoarthritis; and as<br>
contraceptive agents either alone or in combination with a progestogen or<br>
progestogen antagonist<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Estrogens are a group of female hormones essential for the reproductive<br>
process and for the development of the uterus, breasts, and other physical<br>
changes associated with puberty. Estrogens have an effect on various tissues<br>
throughout a woman's body, not only those involved in the reproductive<br>
process, such as the uterus, breasts, and external genitalia, but also tissues in<br>
the central nervous system, bones, the liver, skin, and the urinary tract. The<br>
ovaries produce most of the estrogens in a woman's body.<br>
Menopause is defined as the permanent cessation of menses due to<br>
loss of ovarian follicular function and the near complete termination of estrogen<br>
production. The midlife transition of menopause is characterized by a decrease<br>
in estrogen that provokes both short-term and long-term symptoms with the<br>
vasomotor, urogenital, cardiovascular, skeletal and centra nervous systems,<br>
such as hot flushes, urogenital atrophy, increased risk of cardiovascular<br>
disease, osteoporosis, cognitive and psychological impairment, including an<br>
increased risk of cognitive disorders and Alzheimer's disease (AD).<br>
Seventy-five percent of all women experience some occurrence of<br>
vasomotor symptoms associated with the onset of menopause such as body<br>
sweating and hot flushes. These complaints may begin several years before<br>
menopause and in some women may continue for more than 10 years either<br>
relatively constant, or as instant attacks without a definable, provoking cause.<br>
Urogenital symptoms associated with the onset of menopause involving<br>
the vagina include a sensation of dryness, burning, itching, pain during<br>
intercourse, superficial bleeding and discharge, along with atrophy, and<br>
stenosis. Symptoms involving the urinary tract include a burning sensation<br>
during urination, frequent urgency, recurrent urinary tract infections, and urinary<br>
incontinence. These symptoms have been reported to occur in up to 50% of all<br>
women near the time of menopause and are more frequent a few years after<br>
menopause. If left untreated, the problems can become permanent.<br>
Heart attack and stroke are major causes of morbility and mortality<br>
among senior women. Female morbility from these diseases increases rapidly<br>
after menopause. Women who undergo premature menopause are at greater<br>
coronary risk than menstruating women of similar age. The presence of serum<br>
estrogen has a positive effect on serum lipids. The hormone promotes<br>
vasodilation of blood vessels, and enhances the formation of new blood<br>
vessels. Thus the decrease in serum estrogen levels in postmenopausal<br>
women results in adverse cardiovascular effect Additionally, it is theorized that<br>
differences in the ability of blood to coagulate may account for the observed<br>
difference in the occurrence of heart disease before and after menopause.<br>
The skeleton is under a continuous process of bone degeneration and<br>
regeneration in a carefully regulated interaction among the bone cells. These<br>
cells are directly affected by estrogen. Estrogen deficiency results in a loss of<br>
bone structure, and decrease of bone strength. Rapid loss of bone mass<br>
during the year immediately following menopause leads to postmenopausal<br>
osteoporosis and increased risk of fracture.<br>
Estrogen deficiency is also one of the causes for the degenerative<br>
changes in the central nervous system and may lead to Alzheimer's disease<br>
(AD) and decline of cognition. Recent evidence suggests an association<br>
between estrogen, menopause and cognition. More particularly, it has been<br>
reported that estrogen replacement therapy and the use of estrogen in women<br>
may prevent the development of AD and improve cognitive function.<br>
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) - more specifically estrogen<br>
replacement therapy (ERT) - is commonly prescribed to address the medical<br>
problems associated with menopause, and also to help hinder osteoporosis<br>
and primary cardiovascular complications (such as coronary artery disease) in<br>
both a preventive and therapeutical manner. As such, HRT is considered a<br>
medical therapy for prolonging the average life span of postmenopausal<br>
women and providing a better quality of life.<br>
ERT effectively relieves the climacteric symptoms and urogenital<br>
symptoms and has shown some benefits in the prevention and treatment of<br>
heart disease in postmenopausal women. Clinical reports have shown that<br>
ERT lowered heart attack rates and mortality rates in populations that received<br>
ERT versus similar populations not on ERT. ERT initiated soon after<br>
menopause may also help maintain bone mass for several years. Controlled<br>
investigations have shown that treatment with ERT has a positive effect even in<br>
older women up to age of 75 years.<br>
However, there are numerous undesirable effects associated with ERT<br>
that reduce patient compliance. Venous thromboembolism, gallbladder<br>
disease, resumption of menses, mastodynia, and a possible increased risk of<br>
developing uterine and/or breast cancer are the risks associated with ERT. Up<br>
to 30% of women who are prescribed ERT do not fill the prescription, and the<br>
discontinuation rate for ERT is between 38% and 70%, with safety concerns,<br>
and adverse effects (bloating and break-through bleeding) the most important<br>
reasons for discontinuation.<br>
A new class of pharmacological agents known as Selective Estrogen<br>
Receptor Modulators or SERMs have been designed and developed as<br>
alternatives for HRT. Raloxifene, a nonsteroidal benzothiophere SERM is<br>
marketed in the US and Europe for the prevention and treatment of<br>
osteoporosis under the trademark of Evista®. Raloxifene has been shown to<br>
reduce bone loss and prevent fracture without adversely stimulating<br>
endometrial and mammary tissue, though raloxifene is somewhat less<br>
efficacious than ERT for protecting against bone loss. Raloxifene is unique and<br>
differs significantly from ERT in that it does not stimulate the endometrium and<br>
has the potential for preventing breast cancer. Raloxifene has also<br>
demonstrated beneficial estrogen agonist effects on cardiovascular risk factors,<br>
more specifically through a rapid and sustained decrease in total and low-<br>
density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in patients treated with raloxifene. In<br>
addition, raloxifene has been shown to reduce plasma concentration of<br>
homocysteine, an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis and<br>
thromboembolic disease.<br>
However, raloxifene has been reported to exacerbate symptoms<br>
associated with menopause such as hot flushes and vaginal dryness, and does<br>
not improve cognitive function in senior patients. Patients taking raloxifene<br><br>
have reported higher rates of hot flashes compared with either placebo or ERT<br>
users and more leg cramps than placebo users, although women who took<br>
ERT had a higher incidence of vaginal bleeding and breast discomfort than<br>
raloxifene or placebo users.<br>
As yet, neither raloxifene nor any of the other currently available SERM<br>
compounds has been shown to have the ability to provide all the benefits of<br>
currently available ERT such as controlling postmenopausal syndrome and<br>
preventing AD, without causing adverse side effects such as increasing risk of<br>
endometrial and breast cancer and bleeding. Thus there exists a need for<br>
compounds which are selective estrogen receptor modulators and which<br>
provide all of the benefits of ERT while also addressing the vasomotor,<br>
urogenital and cognitive disorders or conditions associated with the decrease in<br>
systemic estrogen associated with menopause.<br>

Where the processes for the preparation of the compounds according to<br>
the invention give rise to mixture of stereoisomers, these isomers may be<br>
separated by conventional techniques such as preparative chromatography.<br>
The compounds may be prepared in racemic form, or individual enantiomers<br>
may be prepared either by enantiospecific synthesis or by resolution. The<br><br>
compounds may, for example, be resolved into their component enantiomers<br>
by standard techniques, such as the formation of diastereomeric palrs by salt<br>
formation with an optically active acid, such as (-)-di-p-toiuoyl-d-tartaric acid<br>
and/or (+)-di-p-toiuoyl-l-tartaric acid followed by fractional crystallization and<br>
regeneration of the free base. The compounds may also be resolved by<br>
formation of diastereomeric esters or amides, followed by chromatographic<br>
separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary. Alternatively, the compounds<br>
may be resolved using a chiral HPLC column.<br>
During any of the processes for preparation of the compounds of the<br>
present invention, it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or<br>
reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. This may be achieved by<br>
means of conventional protecting groups, such as those described in Protective<br>
Groups in Organic Chemistry, ed. J.F.W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973; and<br>
T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis. John<br>
Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991. The protecting groups may be removed at a convenient<br>
subsequent stage using methods known from the art.<br>
The utility of the compounds of the instant invention to treat disorders<br>
mediated by an estrogen receptor may be determined according to the<br>
procedures described in Examples -172,173,174 and 175 herein.<br>
The present invention therefore provides a method of treating disorders<br>
mediated by an estrogen receptor in a subject in need thereof which comprises<br>
administering any of the compounds as defined herein in a quantity effective to<br>
treat sald disorder. The compound may be administered to a patient by any<br>
conventional route of administration, including, but not limited to, intravenous,<br>
oral, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal and parenteral. The quantity of<br>
the compound which is effective for treating a disorder mediated by an<br>
estrogen receptor is between 0.01 mg per kg and 20 mg per kg of subject body<br>
weight.<br>
The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising one or more compounds of this invention in association with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Preferably these compositions are in unit<br>
dosage forms such as tablets, pills, capsules, powders, granules, sterile<br>
parenteral solutions or suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays, drops,<br>
ampoules, autoinjector devices or suppositories; for oral parenteral, intranasal,<br>
sublingual or rectal administration, or for administration by inhalation or<br>
insufflation. Alternatively, the composition may be presented in a form suitable<br>
for once-weekly or once-monthly administration; for example, an insoluble salt<br>
of the active compound, such as the decanoate salt, may be adapted to provide<br>
a depot preparation for intramuscular injection. For preparing solid<br>
compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a<br>
pharmaceutical carrier, e.g. conventional tableting ingredients such as corn<br>
starch, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate,<br>
dicalcium phosphate or gums, and other pharmaceutical diluents, e.g. water, to<br>
form a solid preformulation composition contalning a homogeneous mixture of<br>
a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt<br>
thereof. When referring to these preformulation compositions as<br>
homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly<br>
throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided<br>
into equally effective dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This<br>
solid preformulation composition is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of<br>
the type described above contalning from 5 to about 1000 mg of the active<br>
ingredient of the present invention. The tablets or pills of the novel composition<br>
can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording<br>
the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can<br>
comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in<br>
the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be<br>
separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the<br>
stomach and permits the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or<br>
to be delayed in release. A variety of material can be used for such enteric<br>
layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids with<br>
such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol and cellulose acetate.<br>
The liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention<br>
may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include, aqueous<br>
solutions, suitably flavoured syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavoured<br>
emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil or<br>
peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. Suitable<br>
dispersing or suspending agents for aqueous suspensions, include synthetic<br>
and natural gums such as tragacanth, acacia, alginate, dextran, sodium<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone or gelatin.<br>
The method of treating a disorder mediated by an estrogen receptor<br>
described in the present invention may also be carried out using a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising any of the compounds as defined herein and a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical composition may<br>
contaln between about 5 mg and 1000 mg, preferably about 10 to 500 mg, of the<br>
compound, and may be constituted into any fonm suitable for the mode of<br>
administration selected. Carriers include necessary and inert pharmaceutical<br>
excipients, including, but not limited to, binders, suspending agents, lubricants,<br>
flavorants, sweeteners, preservatives, dyes, and coatings. Compositions suitable<br>
for oral administration include solid forms, such as pills, tablets, caplets, capsules<br>
(each including immediate release, timed release and sustalned release<br>
formulations), granules, and powders, and liquid forms, such as solutions, syrups,<br>
elixers, emulsions, and suspensions. Forms useful for parenteral administration<br>
include sterile solutions, emulsions and suspensions.<br>
Advantageously, compounds of the present invention may be administered<br>
in a single dally dose, or the total dally dosage may be administered in divided<br>
doses of two, three or four times dally. Furthermore, compounds for the present<br>
invention can be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable<br>
intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal skin patches well known to those of<br>
94<br>
ordinary skill in that art To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery<br>
system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than<br>
intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.<br>
For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the<br>
active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Moreover,<br>
when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents and<br>
coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders<br>
include, without limitation, starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-<br>
lactose, com sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth<br>
or sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate,<br>
sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like. Disintegrators include, without<br>
limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum and the like.<br>
The liquid forms may include suitably flavored suspending or dispersing<br>
agents such as the synthetic and natural gums, for example, tragacanth, acacia,<br>
methyl-cellulose and the like. For parenteral administration, sterile suspensions<br>
and solutions are desired. Isotonic preparations which generally contaln suitable<br>
preservatives are employed when intravenous administration is desired.<br>
The compound of the present invention can also be administered in the<br>
form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large<br>
unilamellar vesicles, and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a<br>
variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine or<br>
phophatidylcholines.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may also be delivered by the use of<br>
monoclonal antibodies as individual earners to which the compound molecules<br>
are coupled. The compounds of the present invention may also be coupled with<br>
soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamidephenol,<br><br>
polyhydroxyethylaspartamidephenol, or polyethyl-eneoxidepolylysine substituted<br>
with palmitoyl residue. Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention may<br>
be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled<br>
release of a drug, for example, polylactic acid, polyepsilon caprolactone,<br>
polyhydroxy butyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans,<br>
polycyanoacrylates and cross-linked or amphipathic block copolymers of<br>
hydrogels.<br>
Compounds of this invention may be administered in any of the foregoing<br>
compositions and according to dosage regimens established in the art whenever<br>
treatment of a disorder mediated by an estrogen receptor is required.<br>
The dally dosage of the products may be varied over a wide range from<br>
about 1 to about 1,000 mg per aduft human per day. For oral administration, the<br>
compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets contalning, 1.0,5.0,<br>
10.0,15.0,25.0,50.0,100,250 and 500 milligrams of the active ingredient for the<br>
symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. An effective<br>
amount of the drug is ordinarily supplied at a dosage level of from about 0.01<br>
mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg of body weight per day. Preferably, the range is from<br>
about 0.1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg of body weight per day, and especially from<br>
about 0.5 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg of body weight per day. The compounds may<br>
be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day.<br>
Optimal dosages to be administered may be readily determined by those<br>
skilled in the art, and will vary with the particular compound used, the mode of<br>
administration, the strength of the preparation, the mode of administration, and<br>
the advancement of the disease condition. In addition, factors associated with the<br>
particular patient being treated, including patient age, weight, diet and time of<br>
administration, will result in the need to adjust dosages.<br>
The following Examples are set forth to ald in the understanding of the<br>
invention, and are not intended and should not be construed to limit in any way<br>

Estrogen Receptor a Flash Plato Assay<br>
This assay monitors binding of radiolabeled estrogen to the estrogen<br>
receptor. It is performed on a BioMek 2000 (Beckman). Plates are read in a<br>
scintillation counter (Packard TopCount), with decreased counts an indication of<br>
binding of a compound to the receptor. The assay was run according to the<br>
procedure described by Allan, et al., Anal. Biochem. (1999), 275(2), 243-247.<br>
On day one, 100 µL of Estrogen Screening Buffer (ESB, Panvera)<br>
containing 5mM dithiothreitol (DTT, Panvera), 0.5 µg mouse anti-estrogen<br>
receptor monoclonal antibody (SRA-1010, Stressgen) and 50 ng purified human<br>
estrogen receptor a (Panvera) were added to each well of a 96 well FlashPlate<br>
 Plus plate crosslinked with goat anti-mouse antibodies (NEN Life Sciences). The<br>
plate was sealed and incubated at 4°C overnight.<br>
On day two, each well was washed three times with 200 µL PBS, pH 7.2,<br>
at room temperature. To each well was then added 98 µL radiolabeled estrogen<br>
(0.5 nM, which equals 6 nCi for a 120 Ci/mmol batch, Amersham), diluted in ESB<br>
 and 5mM dithiothreitol (DTT). To individual wells were then added 2.5 µL test<br>
compound diluted in 30% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide/50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. The<br>
wells were mixed three times by aspiration, the plate sealed and incubated at<br>
room temperature for one hour. The wells were then counted for 1 min in a<br>
TopCount scintillation counter (Packard).<br>
Example 173<br>
Estrogen Receptor B Fluorescence Polarization Assay<br>
This assay monitors binding of a fluorescent analog of estrogen<br>
(Fluormone ES2, Panvera) to the estrogen receptor. Plates are read in a<br>
20 fluorometer that can be set to polarization mode. A decrease in fluorescence<br>
relative to vehicle control is an indication of binding of a compound to the<br>
receptor.<br>
It is crucial to avoid introduction of air bubbles into the reaction in each well<br>
25 of the 96 well plate throughout this procedure. (Bubbles on the surface of the<br>
reaction disrupt light flow, affecting the polarization reading.) However, it is also<br>
crucial to effectively mix the reaction components upon addition to the well.<br>
On ice, a 2X standard mixture of Assay Buffer (Panvera), 10 nM DTT and<br>
30 40 nM ES2 was prepared. On ice, a 2X reaction mixture of Assay Buffer<br>
(Panvera), and 20 nM hER-b (Panvera) and 40 nM ES2 was also prepared.<br>
Dilutions of test compound were prepared in 30% (v/v) dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide/50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. At this point, the dilutions were 40X the final<br>
required concentration.<br>
The standard mixture at 50 µL was then added to each well. The reaction<br>
mixture at 48 µL was added to ail wells. The compound dilution at 2.5 µL was<br>
added to the appropriate wells. The reaction mixtures were mixed using a manual<br>
pipette, a roll of aluminum foil adhesive cover was placed on the plate and the<br>
plate incubated at room temperature for 1 hour.<br>
Each well on the plate was then read in an LjL Analyst with an excitation<br>
wavelength of 265 nm and an emissbn wavelength of 538.<br>
Representative compound of the present invention were tested according<br>
to the procedure described above for binding to the Estrogen Receptor a and<br>
Estrogen Receptor b, with results as listed in Table 6.<br>

MCF-7 Cell Proliferation Assay<br>
This assay was run according to the procedure described by Welshons, et<br>
al., (Breast Cancer Res. Treat, 1987,10(2), 169-75), with minor modification.<br>
Briefly, MCF-7 cells (from Dr. C. Jordan, Northwestern University) were<br>
maintained in RPM1 1640 phenol red free medium (Gibco) in 10% FBS<br>
(Hyclone), supplemented with bovine insulin and non-essential amino acid<br>
(Sigma). The cells were initially treated with 4-hydoxyltamoxifen (10-8 M) and<br>
let stand at 37°C for 24 hours. Following this incubation with tamoxifen, the<br>
ceils were treated with compounds at various concentrations.<br>
Compounds to be tested in the agonist mode were added to the culture<br>
media at varying concentrations. Compounds to be treated in the antagonist<br>
mode were prepared similarly, and 10 nM 17b-estradiol was also added to the<br>
culture media. The cells were incubated for 24 hours at 37°C. Following this<br>
incubation, 0.1 µCi of 14C-thymidine (56mCi/mmol, Amersham) was added to the<br>
culture media and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 hours at 37°C.<br>
The cells were then washed twice with Hank's buffered salt solution (HBSS)<br>
(Gibco) and counted with a scintillation counter. The increase in the 14C-<br>
thymidine in the compound treated cells relative to the vehicle control cells were<br>
reported as percent increase in celt proliferation.<br>
Representative compound of the present invention were tested according<br>
to the procedure described above, with results as listed in Table. 7.<br>

Alkaline Phosphatase Assay In Human Endometrial Ishikawa Cells<br>
This assay was run according to the procedure described by Albert et a.,<br>
Cancer Res, (9910), 50(11), 330-6-10, with minor modification.<br>
Ishikawa cells (from ATCC) were maintained in DMEM/F12 (1:1) phenol<br>
red free medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% calf serum (Hyclone). 24 hours<br>
prior to testing, the medium was changed to DMEM/F12 (1:1) phenol red free<br>
containing 2% calf serum.<br>
Compounds to be tested in the agonist mode were added to the culture<br>
media at varying concentrations. Compounds to be treated in the antagonist<br>
mode were prepared similarly, and 10 nM 17b-estradiol was also added to the<br>
culture media. The cells were then incubated at 37°C for 3 days. On the fourth<br>
day, the media was remove, 1 volume of 1X Dilution Buffer (Clontech) was<br>
added to the well followed by addition of 1 volume of Assay Buffer (Clontech).<br>
The cells were then incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. 1 volume of<br>
freshly prepared Chemiluminescence Buffer (1 volume of chemiluminescent<br>
substrate (CSPD) in 19 volume Chemiluminescent Enhancer with final<br>
concentration of CSPD at 1.25 mM; Sigma Chemical Co.) was added. The<br>
cells were incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes and then quantified on a<br>
luminometer. The increase of chemiluminescence over vehicle control was used<br>
to calculate the increase in alkaline phosphatase activity.<br>
Representative compound of the present invention were tested according<br>
to the procedure described above, with results as listed in Table 8.<br>
