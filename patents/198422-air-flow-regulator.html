This invention relates to system(s) and the machine(s) of air flow regulator set on a needed basic civil structure, comprising wind wing fan rotating horizontally   with wide vertical wings ,  set at roof top of multistoreyed building with its centre above the centre of exhaust ventilator pipe line hole, having bearings , small gears and full round gears, speed grip attachments set on its bottom rounds and the bottom round resting rail to its full round set on steel frames with straight building full heigh vertical heavy steel rod or pipe, connected to roof top wind wing fan centre and positioned at pipe line hole centre having horizontal wheels at each storey level with rope gripped or geared vertical wheels, bearings, gears, chains and /or ropes for passing on the rotation force brought from roof top fan to exhaust fans and ceiling fans in the storeys with speed control, on and off provisions, as they run on their own when the roof top wind wing fan is rotating.   When the exhaust fans are pulling outside fresh air through open windows of the building and ceiling fans make the air flow circulates comfortably and later pass up through exhaust fans and ventilator pipe line hole, with out electricity and manual labour. { Ref. Fig 1 )<br>
For convenience of maintenance, iron grill service platforms could be provided above the horizontal wheel of each storey ( Ref. Fig 1 )<br>
Same way as above, like passing of the rotation force through exhaust ventilator pipe line hole located in the centre or at one side of the building , rotation force can be passed on from roof top to down to all<br><br>
the storeys of the building fay providing gears below the roof top fan gears with rods connecting to the outer end of the building and passing down the rotation force with vertical wheels, gears, chains, ropes and linking frames to the exhaust fans set on outside walls and the ceiling fans set inside in all storeys of the building. Exhaust ians and ceiling fans could run through the connections set at outer surface of the building also when the roof top wind wing fan is rotating. (Ref. Fig 2 )<br>
As an embodiment, the horizontal wind wing fen's horizontal rotation force linked by centre verical rod to another horizontal wheel down to it, can be converted to vertical wheel force further by bevel gears and subsequently by futher chain / rope links and vertical wheels.   ( Ref. Fig 3 )<br>
As an emodiment, machine having roof top wind wing fan made on vertically rotating wheel in single or more in numbers with number of wings set on it covering the wheel's top and side portion, also will rotate on wind force vertically and the ratation force can be passed down through exhaust ventilator pipe line hole with chain / rope linked vertical wheels connected ta exhaust fans and ceiling fans in all the storeys,   (ref. Fig 4 )<br>
In the same way as above the vertical wheel rotation of roof top vertical wheel could be linked by gears and rods to the outer end of the building and the rotation force can be passed down to the exhaust and ceiling fans of all storeys by gears, bearings, frames, chains and ropes.<br><br>
To give better effect to the wind force, a portion of the vertical wind wing fan wheel height could be covered by tangential plate (sloppy front screen) made out of steel or other suitable material,   so that the wind dashing on the plate will go upwards and side wise and push the side wings of wheel for fast rotation of the vertical wind wing fan wheel, (ref Fig5)<br>
The vertically rotating roof top fan and the screen above said could be set in such a way as the side facing of the vertical wheel and the attached bottom screen could be changed according to the direction of wind's blow by provision of two horizontally revolving round wheel bases with chain links. The top revolving round wheel is only a base for changing the direction of vertical wind wing fan. The centre shaft of the vertical wind wing fan and a centre shaft set below the bottom revolving round wheel are connected by fixed cormecting frames having bearing inside at both the shafts making its connection firm at the time both the centre shafts are rotating.  Chain links connecting geared outer of vertical wind wing wheels and the fixed gear on the bottom shaft will make the bottom shaft rotate on rotation of vertical wind wing wheel while the fixed frame connection makes the bottom shaft firm on its direction according to the direction of vertical wind wing fan wheel.<br>
The fixed bigger gear set at one end of the rotating bottom shaft touching the horizontal bottom revolving round wheel at its bottom will make the horizotal revolving round wheel to rotate on one direction and the fixed small gear on the other side of shaft having one in between small gear on its top will make the same horizontal bottom revolving round wheel to rotate on the same direction.<br><br>
From the rotating bottom horizontal revolving round wheel, the rotation force is passed on to the vertical geared wheels  set in the exhaust ventilator pipe holes and with out affecting the positions of the vertical gears and chain links in the exhaust ventilator pipe hole and on roof top, the gear wheel and rod connected at roof top to outer surface of the building and subsequent connections will function normally as described earlier. ( Ref Fig 6 )<br>
Machine as described above can be made with suitable connecting / disconnecting, on and off provisions for its activities at various levels, particular operation , particular wheel, chain link, exhaust fan, ceiling fan from the functioning.    Also provisions are made for rotating the horizontal wind wing wheel and vertical wind wing wheel,   manually in case of speed of wind blow is not sufficient for rotating the wheels on its own by wind force<br>
On the roof top and other places, where ever it is possible, mini generators, dynamos could be fit for generating electricity for getting light and possible applications. When ever the rotation force is not required for air Sow regulation, rotation force can be diverted for other purposes or the rotation force could be used for all purposes at a time. { ref Fig 7,8,9)<br>
US Patents 5,512,7788   , 4220870 are different. No connection to the system referred in this invention.<br>
For better understanding of the descriptions, the drawings can be referred.<br><br><br>
