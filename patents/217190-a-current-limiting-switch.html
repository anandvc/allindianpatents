				<td>DESCRIPTION High-speed current-limiting switch<br>
The invention is based on a current-limiting switch as claimed in the precharacterizing clause of patent claim 1.<br>
Such current-limiting switches may be used in the high-voltage or medium-voltage areas as generator switches, as coupling switches between busbar sections in switchgear assemblies, as DC switches, or in mesh-connected networks to reduce the operational losses.<br>
The invention refers to a prior art of current-limiting switches as is described, for example, in European Application EP Application No. 98811251.2, which has not yet been published. This switch has a high-speed mechanical switching point with galvanic contacts, and two commutation paths connected in parallel with them. A first switching apparatus and an isolating switching point are arranged in series in the first commutation path, and a current limiter and a second switching apparatus are connected in series in the second commutation path. The current limiter is designed in such a way that current which is carried by it and is commutated from the first to the second commutation path when the first switching apparatus opens is limited with a time delay. During this time delay, no overvoltage can build up across the two commutation paths, and an overvoltage-resistant isolation path can at the same time be formed in the first commutation path.<br>
The invention, as it is specified in the patent claims, is based on the object of providing a current-limiting switch of the type mentioned initially which, thanks to its special, space-saving design and the small moving mass, allows high-speed on and off switching in the high-voltage and medium-voltage areas.<br><br>
The current-limiting switching according to the invention has three paths arranged in parallel with one another, two of which contain a mechanical switching point. One of these mechanical switching points is designed to carry and switch rated current, while the other carries a commuted current, briefly and in the form of a pulse, just while switching is taking place. The contact arrangements of the mechanical switching points are designed to be axially symmetrical and are arranged coaxially. Short, coaxial copper connections result in very low stray inductances, thus allowing a current to be commutated very quickly.<br>
If the third path of the switch according to the invention also contains a mechanical switching point with a coaxially arranged contact arrangement, there is no need for any series disconnector to be connected in series with conventional current—limiting switches.<br>
If the contact arrangements have different diameters and they are located one inside the other, the length of the switch in the axial direction is reduced. This makes it possible to reduce the dimensions of a housing in which the contact arrangements are arranged, in order to be protected, for example, against dust and other disturbing influences. In this case, it is particularly advantageous for a contact arrangement to be arranged in a pressure—resistant housing which, for example, is filled with an insulating gas at atmospheric pressure,or at a higher pressure, and this has an advantageous effect on the dielectric properties of the contact arrangement. If the housing contains two electrically conductive parts which are insulated from one another, the rated current can be carried directly via these housing parts to the connections of the rated-current switching point. There is thus no need for any complex rated-current bushings through the housing.<br>
If the switching points contain a high-speed drive for opening and closing the contact arrangement<br><br>
XL IS possible to implement different algorithms corresponding to the operational requirements, for opening and/or closing the switch.<br>
An embodiment of the invention and the further )  advantages which can be achieved by means of it are explained in more detail in the following text with reference to drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a single-phase basic circuit of a test apparatus,  which simulates a medium-voltage network,  having  a  first  embodiment  of  a current-limiting  switch  according  to  the invention. Figure 2 shows a plan view of a section, passing along one axis, through a housing having switching points of the switch shown in Figure 1, Figure 3 shows a single-phase basic circuit of a test apparatus, which simulates a medium-voltage network,  having a  second embodiment  of  a current-limiting  switch  according  to  the invention, and Figure 4  shows a plan view of a section, passing along one axis, through a housing having switching points of the switch shown in Figure 3, and Figure 5 shows a plan view of a detail, illustrated enlarged, of a switching point of the switch shown in Figure 4. In all the figures, the same reference symbols relate to parts having the same effect.<br>
The circuit illustrated in Figure 1 is a single-phase basic circuit of a test apparatus which simulates a medium-voltage network, having a first embodiment of a current-limiting switch S according to the invention. The test apparatus contains a generator Q, which simulates a mains voltage UH of several 10 kV, the switch S and a load L which simulates a non-reactive resistor RL and an inductance LL. A short-circuit current identification unit E is connected between the generator Q and the switch S and contains a measurement  and  evaluation  section  for  very  fast<br><br>
identification of short-circuit currents of up to several 10 JcA. The switch S has a rated-current switching point Si connected in the current path from the generator Q to the load L. Two commutation paths P1 and P2 are connected in parallel with the rated-current switching point S1.<br>
The first commutation path P1 contains an isolating switching point ST and an electronic power switching apparatus T with a diode bridge D1, D2, power semiconductors H which can be turned off, for example GTOs, and a surge arrester M. The diode bridge allows alternating currents to be switched both during positive polarity and during negative polarity, without any back-to-back-connected power semiconductors.<br>
The second commutation path P2 contains, connected in series, a disconnection switching point SA and a current limiter RB, which responds to a current with a time delay and is designed, for example, in the form of a PTC thermistor. The disconnection switching point may be in the form of a semiconductor switch HA having back-to-back-connected power semiconductors which can be turned off, for example GTOs, or may comprise a galvanically isolating, mechanical contact arrangement KR, preferably a vacuum switch.<br>
The switching points Si and ST of the switch shown in Figure 1 each have a contact arrangement Ki and KT, which open very quickly, within a few 100 ps. The contact arrangement Ki of the rated-current switching point S1 is designed to be arc-resistant.<br>
In one advantageous embodiment of the switch according to the invention, the two contact arrangements K1 and KT of the switching points S1 and ST are arranged in a housing G. On the generator side, the two contact arrangements Ki and KT of the switching points S1 and ST are connected via a connection 1, a first housing part 10 and primary feeders 11 and 12. On the load side, the rated-current switching point S1 is connected to the connection 2 via a secondary feeder 21 and a second housing part 20. The isolating switching<br><br>
point ST of the first commutation path P, is connected to the electronic power switching apparatus T via a secondary feeder 31, which is routed through the housing G by means of a bushing 5.<br>
During operation, the contact arrangements K| and Kj of the two switching points Sj and<br>
ST together with the disconnection switching point SA are respectively closed and switched on.<br>
When a short— circuit current occurs, the identification unit E on the current—limiting switch<br>
S initiates a disconnection process within about I00M-S. In the process, the semiconductor<br>
elements H located in the first commutation path P1 are switched on immediately. At the same<br>
time, the contact arrangement K1 of the rated—current switching point S1 is opened. Owing to<br>
two series-connected arcs which are formed during this process, the short—circuit current,<br>
which is still rising, commutates within about 150 µis into the first commutation path Pi- The<br>
semiconductor elements H remain switched on until a withstand voltage is reached across the<br>
contact arrangement K1 of the rated-current switching point S1 which is greater than the<br>
withstand voltage across the semiconductor elements H. The short— circuit current in the first<br>
commutation path P1is then switched off by means of the semiconductor elements H, and<br>
commutates into the second commutation path P2. The contact arrangement KT of the isolating<br>
switchmg point Sj is opened at the same time. During the second commutation process, a<br>
transient overvoage occurs due to stray inductances, and a resistive voltage drop occurs across<br>
the current limiter Rg The current limiter RB limits with a delay of several 100 µs. This time<br>
delay is sufficient in order to complete the opening process of the contact arrangement K| of the<br>
rated-current switchmg point S| and of the contact arrangement Kj of the isolating switching<br>
point ST. Once the contact arrangement Kj of the isolating switching point ST has opened,<br>
virtually the entire voltage which is present across the switch S is dropped	<br><br>
across the isolating switcning point ST in the first commutation path PI. Since the current limiter RB responds with a delay, the rise in the voltage across the switch S, and thus across the rated-current switching point Si and the isolating switching point ST does not start until after the contact arrangement K1 of the rated-current switching point S1 and the contact arrangement KT of the isolating switching point ST have opened. The limited short-circuit current can be switched off at the next current zero crossing, for example after 5 to 6 ms, by means of the disconnection switching point SA, with a very low transient recovery voltage.<br>
Figure 2 shows one possible arrangement of the first  embodiment  of  the  switch  according  to  the invention. The majority of the two switching points Si " and  ST  is  arranged,  coaxially  symmetrically,  in  a " cylindrical housing G. The housing G is composed of two electrically conductive housing parts 10 and 20   in the form of panels, an electrically insulating housing part 7 designed in the form of a tube, and two electrically insulating, gas-tight bushings 5 and [6J The housing G " . is designed to be pressure-resistant and is filled with  " n  ."/" a gaseous medium, for example air or SFs at atmospheric pressure or a higher pressure.<br>
The two switching points S1 and ST are respectively composed of a contact arrangement K1 and KT, each having two stationary switching contacts and each having one moving bridge switching contact, and each having a drive, which can be initiated independently, for opening and/or closing the contact arrangement.<br>
The two contact arrangements K1 and KT are ; arranged located one inside the other, with the contact \ arrangement Ki of the rated-current switching point Sj j having the largest diameter and being arranged on the I<br>
I<br>
outside, since it has an appropriate cross section for " carrying the rated current. The contact arrangement KT [ of    the    Isolating    switching point ST,    through which a ^<br><br>
current which is being commutated flows briefly and in the form of a pulse only while switching is taking place, has a correspondingly smaller diameter and is arranged coaxially inside the contact arrangement K1 of the rated-current switching point S1. The feeders to the contact points are designed to toe as short and axially symmetrical as possible, as shown in Figure 2. The rated-current connections 1 and 2 are connected in the cylindrical housing G to the outer edge of the electrically conductive housing parts 1 and 2, which are in the form of panels, and may, for example, be designed in the form of a tube. The other feeders to the contact arrangements, as well as all the cables for the   controls   for   the   switching   points,   are advantageously routed out of the housing through the center of the housing parts 1 and 2, which are in the form of panels. Thanks to the inclusion of the housing parts 1 and 2 in the rated-current path, there is no need for any further bushings,  in particular high-current  and  high-voltage  bushings  for  the  rated current.<br>
Figure 3 shows the circuit illustrated in Figure 1, having an advantageous, second embodiment of the switch S according to the invention. In this case, the disconnection switching point SA comprises a mechanical contact arrangement KA, which likewise opens very quickly. Together with the two contact arrangements K1 and KT of the switching points S1 and ST, the contact arrangement KA of the disconnection switching point SA is arranged in the housing G. On the generator side, the disconnection switching point SA is likewise connected via the connection 1 and the first housing part 10, as well as a primary feeder 13. On the load side, the disconnection switching point SA is connected to the current limiter Re via a secondary feeder 41, which is routed through the housing G by means of a bushing 6, and via a connection 4.<br>
The  arrangement of the second embodiment of the switch according to the invention as shown in Figure 4<br><br>
corresponds largely to the arrangement shown in Figure 2. In addition to the two switching points S1 and ST, the disconnection switching point SA is arranged coaxially symmetrically in the housing G.<br>
With this embodiment, with galvanical isolation in each of the three parallel current paths, it is possible to dispense with the use of an additional series disconnector.<br>
In addition to a moving bridge switching contact, which is part of the contact arrangement of the switching poiNT one advantageous embodiment of the drive for a switching point essentially provides two coils and an electronic power control unit. The contact arrangement and coils are designed to be axially symmetrical and are arranged coaxially with respect to one another. The detailed design of the three switching points will be explained in more detail with reference to a detail. Illustrated in Figure 5, of the arrangement shown in Figure 2. In this case, the two coils 81 and 82 which are part of the drive of a switching point are each arranged offset in the axial direction on both sides of the associated bridge switching contact, which is designed as a contact ring 85. The contact ring has electrodynaraic force applied to it by energy being fed from the electronic power control unit into the appropriate coil. The contact ring can be moved backward and forward in the axial direction between the two coils 81 and 82, with the contact arrangement opening and closing again in the process. When the contact arrangement is closed, the contact ring 85 fits in between the two stationary switching contacts 84, and short-circuits them. When the contact arrangement is open, the contact ring 85 is held firmly by a holding part 83.<br><br>
