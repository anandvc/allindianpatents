				<td>PROCESS   FOR   THE   PRODUCTION   OF   RIGID   POLYURETHAJ^<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a new process for the production of substantially closed-cell polyurethane foams.<br>
Processes for producing substantially closed-cell rigid foams containing urethane, urea and biuret groups are generally known.<br>
A review of the production of corresponding rigid foams is given for example in Kunststoff-Handbuch, (Handbook of Plastics), Vol. 7, 1st Edition 1966, edited by R. Vieweg and A. Hochtlen and 2nd Edition 1983, edited by G. Oertel, (Carl Hanser Verlag, Munich).<br>
Rigid foams such as these are normally produced by reacting aromatic poly-isocyanates with polyols, preferably polyether polyols or polyester polyols, in the presence of blowing agents, catalysts, and, optionally, auxiliaries and additives.<br>
The fluorochlorohydrocarbons such as Rl 1 that were previously preferably used as blowing agents have been replaced. In particular, these conventional fluorochlorohydrocarbons were replaced due to their ozone-destructive properties, by blowing agents such as, for example, partially halogenated fluorochlorohydrocarbons such as, for example, R141b (1,1,1-dichlorofluoroethane), fluorohydro-carbons, as well as low boiling point alkanes such as, for example, n-pentane, isopentane and cyclopentane.<br>
Rigid polyurethane foams are used, for example, in the production of composite elements or sandwich elements, or in filling cavities in household appliances such as domestic refrigerating equipment, for example, refrigerators or freezers, or insulating storage water heaters.<br>
In the past, the renewable raw material castor oil, a triglyceride widely used in the chemical industry, was used in the production of polyurethanes. Castor oil is suitable for this purpose since it has about three hydroxyl groups per molecule. Castor oil, however, could not previously be used in large amounts (i.e., more than<br><br>
20 parts by weight of the polyol formulation) in the production of rigid polyurethane foams since its OH number is too low and the resultant rigid foams have an insufficient mechanical stability, particularly in the case of rigid foams having bulk densities below 50 kg/m . The use of large amounts of the renewable raw material castor oil in the production of rigid polyurethane foams is, however, of interest for both economic and ecological reasons.<br>
Thus, the object of the invention was to provide a process for the production of rigid polyurethane foams wherein more than 20 parts by weight of castor oil may be present in the polyol formulation, and that yields products which can be used industrially without any problem.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that these objects can be achieved by using the polyol formulations according to the invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides a process for the production of rigid polyurethane comprising reacting A) a polyol component with B) a polyisocyanate component in the presence of C) water, D) at least one catalyst, and, optionally, E) at least one blowing agent. In the process of the present invention,<br>
A)        said polyol component comprises:<br>

and<br>
B)        said polyisocyanate component contains an NCO group content of from 20 to 48% by weight.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, suitable polyol component A) comprises 1) from 80 to 100% by weight, based on the total weight of component A), of a polyol containing at least two isocyanate-reactive hydrogen atoms and which comprises a) a mixture of i) an addition product having an OH number of at least 500, and ii) castor oil, and/or b) one or more reaction products obtained by<br><br>
reacting i) an addition product having an OH number of at least 500, with ii) castor oil.<br>
Polyol component A)l) may comprise 100% by weight (based on the total weight of A)l), of mixtures a); 100% by weight (based on the total weight of A)l), of one or more reaction products b); or some of both a) and b).<br>
Suitable polyol components A)l)a)i) and A)l)b)i) comprise the reaction products of diamines or polyamines containing primary and/or secondary amino groups with alkylene oxides. These reaction products have OH numbers of at least 500. Suitable alkylene oxides for forming these reaction products include, for example, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide, dodecyl oxide or styrene oxide. Propylene oxide, ethylene oxide and mixtures thereof are preferred. Suitable as starter compounds in the formation of these reaction products are those diamines or polyamines that contain at least one primary or secondary amino group. Diamines and polyamines containing at least one primary or secondary amino group include, for example, aliphatic amines such as ethylenediamine, various oligomers of ethylenediamine such as, for example, diethylenetriamine, triethylene-tetramine and pentaethylene-hexamine, 1,3-propylenediamine, 1,3- and 1,4-butylenediamine, 1,2-, 1,3-, 1,4-, 1,5-, 1,6-hexamethylenediamine, and aromatic amines such as, for example, phenylenediamines, toluylenediamines such as, for example, 2,3-toluylenediamine, 3,4-toluylenediamine, 2,4-toluylenediamine, 2,5-toluylenediamine, 2,6-toluylenediamine and mixtures of the afore-mentioned isomers, 2,2'-diaminodiphenylmethane, 2,4'-diaminodiphenyl-methane, 4,4'diamino-diphenylmethane and mixtures of these isomers, etc.<br>
As used in the present invention, diamines and/or polyamines containing primary and/or secondary amino groups do not include alkanolamines such as, for example, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, etc.<br>
A particularly preferred reaction product to be used as component A)l)a)i) and/or A)l)b)i) is the polyaddition product of 2 to 4 moles of at least one alkylene oxide, most preferably 3 to 3.8 moles, with an isomeric mixture of 2,3-toluylenediamine and 3,4-toluylenediamine.<br>
Polyol component A) of the present invention may also comprise 2) from 0 to 20% by weight, based on the total weight of A), of at least one compound<br><br>
containing at least two hydrogen atoms which are isocyanate-reactive. Suitable compounds include those conventional isocyanate-reactive compounds which are known to be useful in the production of rigid polyurethane foams. Typically, these compounds have a molecular weight of, for example, from about 200 to about 12,500 g/mole. Such compounds are understood to include, for example, besides compounds containing amino groups, those compounds containing thiol groups or carboxyl groups, and preferably compounds containing hydroxyl groups such as, for example, polyether polyols or polyester polyols containing at least two hydroxyl groups. In particular, suitable polyol compounds A)2) more preferably contain from 2 to 8 hydroxyl groups, and most preferably those compounds having a molecular weight of from 300 to 2,000, such as, for example, polyether polyols or polyester polyols containing from 2 to 8 hydroxyl groups, as well as, for example, polycarbonates or polyester amides, such as are known per se for the production of homogeneous and cellular polyurethanes. Examples of these compounds are described in, for example, DE-A 2,832,253, pp. 11-18. Suitable polyol compounds A)2) for the present invention are clearly different than compounds A)l)a)i) and A)l)b) as described above. It is preferred that compounds A)l)a)i) and A)l)b) are excluded from polyol compounds A)2).<br>
The reaction between the polyol component A) and the polyisocyanate component B) occurs in the presence of C) water, D) at least one catalyst, and, optionally E) at least one blowing agent.<br>
Water, component C), is preferably present in an amount such that there is from 1 to 7% by weight of water (based on the total weight of component A)). When water is used as a blowing agent in the process of the present invention, the quantity of water present should be such that there is about 5 to about 20% by weight of water, based on the total weight of component A).<br>
Blowing agents, component E), may also be used in the process of the present invention for producing rigid polyurethane foams. Examples of suitable blowing agents E) include compounds such as alkanes such as, for example, n-pentane, isopentane, mixtures of isopentane and n-pentane, cyclopentane, cyclohexane, mixtures of butane isomers and the aforementioned alkanes, partially halogenated fluorochlorohydrocarbons such as, for example, 1,1,1-dichlorofluoro-ethane (R141b), partially fluorinated hydrocarbons such as, for example, 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluorobutane (R356) or 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane (R245 fa). Cyclopentane<br><br>
is the preferred blowing agent. When a blowing agent is present in the process of the present invention, the amount of blowing agent typically used is such that there is from about 5 to about 20% by weight of blowing agent present, based on the total weight of component A).<br>
According to the present invention, suitable catalysts D) include those conventional catalysts known per se in polyurethane chemistry are used. Suitable catalysts are present in the process of the invention in an amount of about 0.1 to 4% by weight, based on the total weight of component A).<br>
Polyisocyanates to be used as component B) in the present invention include, for example, aromatic polyisocyanates such as those which are described by W. Siefken in Justus Liebigs Annalen der Chemie, 562, pp. 75 to 136. These typically correspond to the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein<br>
n	represents 2 to 4, preferably 2, and<br>
Q represents an aliphatic hydrocarbon radical having 2 to 18, preferably 6 to 10 C atoms, a cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon radical having 4 to 15, preferably 5 to 10 C atoms, an aromatic hydrocarbon radical having 8 to 15, preferably 8 to 13 C atoms.<br>
Suitable such polyisocyanates are described in, for example, DE-OS 2,832,253, at pp. 10 to 11.<br>
Particularly preferred compounds include those industrially, readily accessible polyisocyanates such as, for example, 2,4- and 2,6-toluylene diisocyanate as well as various mixtures of these isomers ("TDI"), polyphenylpolymethylene polyisocyanates, such as are produced by aniline-formaldehyde condensation followed by phosgenation ("crude MDI"), and polyisocyanates containing carbodiimide groups, urethane groups, allophanate groups, isocyanurate groups, urea groups or biuret groups ("modified polyisocyanates"), and in particular<br><br>
modified polyisocyanates which are derived from 2,4- and 2,6-toluylene diisocyanate or from 4,4'- and/or 2,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate.<br>
It is also possible that the polyisocyanate component may be a prepolymer of one of the aforementioned isocyanates and an organic compound containing at least one hydroxyl group. Suitable organic compounds for the formation of prepolymers include, for example, polyether polyols or polyester polyols which contain 1 to 4 hydroxyl groups and have molecular weights of from 60 to 1,400.<br>
In addition, additives such as, for example, paraffins, fatty alcohols or dimethyl polysiloxanes, and also pigments or dyes, as well as stabilizers against aging and weathering, plasticizers and substances having a fungistatic and bactedostatic action, and fillers such as, for example, barium sulphate, Kieselguhr, carbon black or prepared chalk, may be present along with the catalyst(s) and water.<br>
Further examples of surfactant additives and foam stabilizers as well as cell regulators, reaction retarders, stabilizers, flame retardants, dyes and fillers and also substances having a fungistatic and bacteriostatic action, all of which may optionally be used concomitantly according to the invention, as well as details of the use and mode of action of these additives, are described in, for example, Kunststoff-Handbuch, Vol. VII, edited by Vieweg and Hochtlen, Carl Hanser Verlag, Munich 1966, pp 121 to 205, and 2nd Edition 1983, edited by G. Oertel (Carl Hanser Verlag, Munich).<br>
According to the invention, the foaming process to produce the rigid foams may also be carried out in closed molds. The reaction mixture is added to a mold, suitable mold materials being metals, for example aluminium, or plastics such as, for example, an epoxy resin. The expandable reaction mixture foams in the mold and forms the molding. The foam molding process can be carried out so that the surface of the molding has a cellular structure. It may, however, also be carried out so that the molding has a compact solid skin and a cellular core. According to the invention, in the first case, the procedure is to add such an amount of foamable reaction mixture to the mold that the resultant foam just fills the mold. In the latter case, the procedure is to add more foamable reaction mixture to the mold than is required to fill the interior of the mold with foam. In the latter case, the foaming is thus carried out under conditions of "overcharging", a procedure<br><br>
that is known in the art and described in, for example, U.S. Patents 3,178,490 and 3,182,104, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
The present invention also provides for the use of the rigid foams produced according to the invention as intermediate layers in composite or sandwich elements, and for filling cavities in refrigeration equipment.<br>
The process of the present invention is preferably used to fill cavities in refrigerators and freezers.<br>
Foams can obviously also be produced by slabstock foaming or by twin conveyor belt processes known per se.<br>
The rigid foams obtainable according to the invention can be used, for example, in building and construction as well as to insulate central heating pipes and containers.<br>
As used herein, the term molecular weight refers to the number average molecular weight as determined by end group analysis.<br>
The following examples further illustrate details for the process of this invention. The invention, which is set forth in the foregoing disclosure, is not to be limited either in spirit or scope by these examples. Those skilled in the art will readily understand that known variations of the conditions of the following procedures can be used. Unless otherwise noted, all temperatures are degrees Celsius and all percentages are percentages by weight.<br><br>
