				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
POLYURETHANE FOAM COMPOSITION AND POLYURETHANE FOAM OBTAINED<br>
FROM THE COMPOSITION AND USE THEREOF [TECHNICAL FIELD] [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a polyurethane foam composition containing a plant-derived polyol, a polyurethane foam obtained from the composition and the use thereof. More particularly, the present invention relates to a plant-derived composition capable of providing a polyurethane foam that has excellent low rebound property, is suitable for a shock absorber, a sound absorbing material and a vibration absorbing material, and reduces a feeling of fatigue and a bedsore by making pressure distribution on body more uniform when used as a cushioning material for s. chair and a mattress; a polyol suitable for the composition; and a plant-derived polyurethane foam obtained from the composition and the use thereof. [BACKGROUND ART] [0002]<br>
From the viewpoint of reducing environmental burdens in recent years, plant-derived resins obtained from plant resources have been demanded instead of petroleum-derived resins produced using petroleum resources as raw materials. That is, since plant-derived resins are made from raw materials<br>
obtained from plants, which absorb carbon dioxide in the air to grow by photosynthesis, no net increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide results even if carbon dioxide is emitted into the atmosphere on incineration of the used resin, namely such resins correspond to so-called carbon-neutral materials. Therefore, plant-derived resins draw attention as materials contributing to reducing environmental burdens. [0003]<br>
Meanwhile, a polyurethane foam having low rebound property, which is one of resin articles, is widely used as a shock absorber, a sound absorbing material, a vibration absorbing material, a cushioning material for a chair, a mattress and the like because of its excellent properties . Such a polyurethane foam having low rebound property is produced by appropriately selecting the composition of the polyurethane foam, that is, the type of polyisocyanate, the number of functional groups and the hydroxyl value of a polyol and the like, so as to exhibit low rebound property at a temperature in use. However, in case of a polyurethane foam formulated to exhibit low rebound property at. room temperature, there is a problem that the hardness of the polyurethane foam is significantly increased at low temperatures, for example 0°C or lower, compared to that at room temperature. Various studies have been conducted to solve this problem (for example, see<br>
Patent Document 1). [0004]<br>
As polyol components used as raw materials of polyurethane foams having low rebound property, there have been known so far a polyether polyol and a polyester polyol derived from petroleum as representative examples, and further it has also been known to use castor oil, which is derived from a plant, and a castor oil-based polyol, which is a castor oil derivative. For example, Patent Document 2 discloses that castor oil is reacted with an aromatic diisocyanate to form a prepolymer and then the prepolymer is reacted with water to form a polyurethane foam. Patent Document 3 discloses a method for producing polyurethane foams by using a castor oil derivative such as hydrogenated castor oil as an additive. Meanwhile, Patent Document 4 discloses the use of an ester group-containing condensate having an average molecular weight of 900 to 4500 produced from ricinoleic acid, which is a main component of a castor oil fatty acid, and a monohydric or polyhydric alcohol, as an internal release agent in producing a flexible polyurethane molded article which may be fine porous.  Patent Document 5 discloses the use of a polyester polyol comprising a carboxylic acid unit (A) and a polyhydric alcohol unit (B) , wherein the carboxylic acid unit (A) at least partially contains a unit (a) of an oxycarboxylic acid oligomer in which a<br>
hydroxy-containing carboxylic acid such as a castor oil fatty acid is condensed to form a dimer or a higher oligomer, as a component of a urethane-based paint composition. [0005]<br>
However, the polyurethane foam described in Patent Document 2 is a hard polyurethane foam, and this method cannot provide a polyurethane foam having low rebound property, particularly suitable properties for a cushioning material for a chair., a mattress and the like.  Further, in the process described in Patent Document 3, the castor oil-based polyol is used as an additive and the amount added is 0.1 to 15% by weight with respect to a polyhydroxy compound. Particularly, in Examples, the content of the castor oil-based polyol is only 5% of the whole polyol component, and the document describes effects only for curability and a low compression set, while there is no description for the effect that the polyurethane foam in which a resin structure is formed from the castor oil-based polyol exhibits low rebound property. Moreover, in Patent Documents 4 and 5, a castor oil-based polyol having a higher molecular weight is used compared to that used in Patent Documents 2 and 3. However, in Patent Document 4, the castor oil-based polyol is used only as an internal release agent, and, Patent Document 5 discloses only a paint composition. None of the above patent documents describes the effect that a<br>
polyurethane foam in which a resin structure is formed from a castor oil-based polyol exhibits low rebound property, particularly suitable properties as a cushioning material for a chair, a mattress and the like. [0006]<br>
Any processes described in these patent documents cannot provide a plant-derived polyurethane-foam having low rebound property, which has the property demanded in market as described above, particularly a characteristic that the increase in hardness at low temperatures is suppressed.  Thus, there has not been known a plant-derived polyurethane foam that is produced by using a plant-derived polyol as a polyol component, has excellent low rebound property, is suitable for a shock absorber, a sound absorbing material and a vibration absorbing material, and reduces a feeling of fatigue and a bedsore by making pressure distribution on body more uniform when used as a cushioning material for a chair and a mattress.<br>

In the present invention, it is desirable to use each component so that the NCO index is preferably 0.70 to 1.20, more preferably 0.75 to 1.15.

That is, if the number of isocyanate groups in a polyisocyanate is stoichiometricallyequal to the number of active hydrogens reacting with the isocyanate groups, the NCO index is 1.0. [0093] <br>
For the polyurethane foam composition of the present invention, in addition to the above components, there may be used a chain extender, a cross-linking agent, a cell opener and, as other auxiliaries, additives commonly used in production of polyurethane foams such as a flame retardant, a pigment, a plasticizer, an ultraviolet absorber, and an antioxidant, within a range where the objective of the present invention is not impaired.

[0095]<br>
[Polyurethane foam]<br>
As the production method of polyurethane foams in the present invention, there may be adopted a conventional publicly-known method as appropriate without any particular limitation. Specifically, the polyurethane foam may be produced by a publicly-known foaming process such as a slab foaming process, a mold foaming process or a spraying process. [0096]<br>
For example, the polyurethane foam may be obtained as follows: a resin premix is prepared by premixing the plant-derivedpolyol, the catalyst, the surfactant, the foaming agent, and optionally the other polyols and the other auxiliaries, and subsequently the resin premix and the polyisocyanate are mixed so as to attain a given NCO index typically using a high-pressure foaming machine or a low-pressure foaming machine, followedby reaction, foaming and curing. [0097]<br>
In this way, there can be obtained a polyurethane foam that contributes to reducing environmental burdens, has excellent low rebound property, particularly a characteristic that the increase in hardness at low temperatures is suppressed, is suitable for a shock absorber, a sound absorbing material and a vibration absorbing material, and reduces a feeling of fatigue and a bedsore by making pressure distribution on bodymore uniform when used as a cushioning material for a chair anda mattress.<br>
[0098]<br>
More specifically, the polyurethane foam having low rebound property of the present invention has a value, obtained by dividing the foam hardness at -20°C by the foam hardness at 23°C, of 10 or less, preferably 8 or less, more preferably 5 or less . For the polyurethane foam having low rebound property which has a value, obtained by dividing the foam hardness at -20°C by the foam hardness at 23°C, within the above range, the foam hardness is only by a small degree increased at -20°C compared to the foam hardness at 23°C.  Such a polyurethane foam exhibits excellent low rebound property even at a temperature as low .as -20°C, and hence can excellently function also in applications where the foam having low rebound property is used outside in cold climates (for example, a sleeping bag for mount-climbing, a chair for the audience in an outdoor arena, medical/sport protective pad, and the like) . On the contrary, a conventional polyurethane foam, which was formulated so as to exhibit low rebound property around room temperature, had a drawback that the hardness of the polyurethane foam significantly increased at low temperatures, for example 0°C or lower, compared to that at room temperature, causing a problem of being inferior in low rebound property under theconditions of low temperatures as mentioned above. [0099]<br>
The polyurethane foam that exhibits excellent low rebound property even under low temperature conditions as described above can be produced by using the polyol (A). [EXAMPLES]<br>

A flexible polyurethane foam was produced using the above raw materials by a slab foaming process. (Formulations and results of foaming evaluation)<br>
The components listed in Tables 2 and 3, except Catalyst 2 and Polyisocyanate I, were stirred by a hand mixer. Subsequently, Catalyst 2 was added to the mixture, the resultant mixture stirred for 10 sec, and immediately Polyisocyanate 1 was added in such an amount to obtain the NCO index shown in Tables 2 and 3, followed by mixing. The resultant mixture was put into a foaming box of 20 cm x 20 cm x 20 cm, foamed and cured to obtain a flexible polyurethane foam by a slab f earning process . The resulting flexible polyurethane foam was kept at room temperature for one day and then used for property measurement. The results are shown in Tables 2 and 3.[0115]<br>
Fig. 1 shows the results of the viscoelasticity measurement for the flexible polyurethane foam obtained in Example 1 and Fig. 2 shows the results of the viscoelasticity measurement for the flexible polyurethane foam obtained in Comparative Example 1.

It is found from Tables 2 and 3 that the flexible polyurethane foams obtained in Examples 1 to 11 in which the content of the plant-derived polyol in the compositions is approximately 70% by mass, even though the plant-derived components account for most of the foams, show low rebound property that is in no way inferior to the foams of Comparative Examples 1 to 7, which contain no plant-derived components, and exhibit suitable properties for a plant-derived polyurethane foam having low rebound property, which can contribute to reducing environmental burdens. Further, as shown in Fig. 3, the polyurethane foam having low rebound property of Example 1 shows a smaller degree of increase in hardness at a temperature of 23 °C or lower compared to the foam of Comparative Example 1. That is, it is proved that the plant-derived polyurethane foam has also an excellent property that the increase in hardness under low temperature conditions can be suppressed, which is a property required for low-resilient polyurethane foams having low rebound property, compared to a conventional polyurethane foam derived from petroleum. <br>
