COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"PHTHALAMIDES, A PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF PESTICIDES USING SUCH PHTHALAMIDES"<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
2 JAN 2007<br>
902/mum/2002<br><br>
The   present   invention   relates   to   phthalamides,   a   process   for preparation of pesticides using such phthalamides.<br>
The present invention relates to novel phhthamides. to a process for the preparation and to their use as pesticides.'<br>
It is already known that numerous phthalamides have insecticidal properties (cf. EP 0 919 542 A and EP 1 006 107 A). However, with respect to their compatibility with plants and efficacy, the known compounds are not always satisfactory. It has now been found that phthalamides which contain a silicon atom in the side chain have very good insecticidal and acaricidal properties and are tolerated well by plants.<br>
This invention, accordingly, provides phthalamides of the formula (I)	  (I)<br>
in which<br>
X and Y independently of one another represent hydrogen, halogen, cyano, nitro, alky], halogenoalky], alkoxy, halogenoalkoxy, cycloalkyl, halogenocycloalkyl, cycloalkyloxy, halogenocycloalkyloxy, -S(O)d-alky], -S(O)d-halogenoalky] or represent in each case optionally substituted phenyl, phenoxy, heteroaryl or heteroaryloxy,<br>
n	represents 1, 2, 3 or 4.<br>
m        represents 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5,<br>
R1, R2, R^ and R4 independently of one another represent hydrogen, alkyl, halogeno-alkyl or cycloalkyl,<br><br>

a	represents 1, 2, 3 or 4, with the proviso that the repeat unit -CR1R2- may have<br>
identical or different meanings if a represents 2, 3 or 4,<br>
b	represents 0 or 1,<br>
c	represents 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, with the proviso that the repeat unit -CR3R4- may<br>
have identical or different meanings if c represents 2, 3 or 4,<br>
d	represents 0, 1 or 2.<br>
Depending on the nature and number of substituents, the compounds of the formula (I) may, if appropriate, be present as geometrical and/or optical isomers, regioisomers and/or configurational isomers or isomer mixtures thereof of varying compositions. What is claimed by the invention are both the pure isomers and the isomer mixtures.<br>
Furthermore, it has been found that the novel compounds of the formula (I) obtained by<br><br>

In particular, the compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention have excellent activity against caterpillars, beetle larvae, spider mites, aphids and leaf-mining flies.<br>
If appropriate, the compounds according to the invention can, at certain concentrations or application rates, also be used as herbicides or microbicides, for example as fungicides, antimycotics and bactericides. If appropriate, they can also be employed as intermediates or precursors for the synthesis of other active compounds.<br>
All plants and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. Plants are to be understood as meaning in the present context all plants and plant populations such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional plant breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and recombinant methods or by combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including the plant cultivars protectable or not protectable by plant breeders' rights. Plant parts are to be understood as meaning all parts and organs of plants above and below the ground, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits, seeds, roots, tubers and rhizomes. The plant parts also include harvested materia], and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example cuttings, tubers, rhizomes, offsets and seeds.<br>
Treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the active compounds is carried out directly or by allowing the compounds to act on their surroundings, environment or storage space by the customary treatment methods, for example by immersion, spraying, evaporation, fogging, scattering, painting on and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, also by applying one or more coats.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can be converted into the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders,<br><br>
Le A 35 213 Foreign Countries Nk/Kr/NT<br>
dusts, pastes, soluble powders, granules, suspension-emulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials impregnated with active compound and microencapsulations in polymeric substances.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds according to the invention with extenders, that is liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is emulsifiers and/or dispersants and/or foam-formers.<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible to employ, for example, organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Essentially, suitable liquid solvents are: aromatics such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and also their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, and also water.<br>
Suitable solid carriers are:<br>
for example, ammonium salts and ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals, such as highly disperse silica, alumina and silicates; suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example, crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, and also synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks;<br>
suitable emulsifiers and/or foam-formers are: for example, nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates and also protein hydrolysates;<br>
suitable dispersants are: for example, lignosulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br><br>
Le A 35 213 Foreign Countries Nk/Kr/NT<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, as well as natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids, can be used in the formulations. Other additives can be mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations generally comprise between 0.1 and 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
The active compound according to the invention can be used in commercially available formulations and in the use forms prepared from these formulations as a mixture with other active compounds which are also known, such as insecticides, attractants, sterilizing agents, bactericides, acaricides, nematicides, fungicides, growth-regulating substances or herbicides. The insecticides include, for example, phosphoric acid esters, carbamates, carboxylates, chlorinated hydrocarbons, phenylureas and substances produced by microorganisms, inter alia.<br>

When used as insecticides, the active compounds according to the invention can furthermore be present in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms, prepared from these formulations, as a mixture with synergistic agents. Synergistic agents are compounds which increase the action of the active compounds according to the invention, without it being necessary for the synergistic agent added to be active itself.<br>
The active compound content of the use forms prepared from the commercially available formulations can vary within wide limits. The active compound concentration of the use forms can be from 0.0000001 to 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.0001 and 1% by weight.<br>
The compounds are employed in a customary manner appropriate for the use forms.<br>
When used against hygiene pests and pests of stored products, the active compound is distinguished by an excellent residual action on wood and clay as well as a good stability to alkali on limed substrates.<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or those obtained by conventional biological breeding, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been explained above.<br>
Particularly preferably, plants of the plant cultivars which are in each case commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention. Plant cultivars are to be understood as meaning plants having specific properties ("traits") which can be obtained by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. This can be varieties, bio- and genotypes.<br><br>
Le A 35 213 Foreign Countries Nk/Kr/NT<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the substances and compositions to be used according to the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The preferred transgenic plants or plant cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering) which are to be treated according to the invention include all plants which, in  the  genetic  modification,  received genetic material  which  imparted particularly advantageous useful properties ("traits") to these plants. Examples of such  properties  are  better plant  growth,  increased  tolerance  to  high  or  low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such properties are a better defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally  active  compounds.  Examples  of transgenic  plants  which  may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapevines), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton and oilseed rape. Traits that are emphasized are in particular increased defence of the plants against insects by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example, by the genes CrylA(a), CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CrylllA, CrylllA, CrylllB2, Cry9c, Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF and also combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits that are also particularly emphasized are the<br><br>
Le A 35 213 Foreign Countries Nk/Kr/NT<br>
increased defence of plants against fungi, bacteria and viruses by systemic acquired<br>
resistance   (SAR),   systemin,   phytoalexihs,   elicitovs   and  resistance   genes   and<br>
correspondingly   expressed   proteins   and   toxins.   Traits   that   are   furthermore<br>
particularly  emphasized  are  the  increased   tolerance  of the  plants  to  certain<br>
herbicidally   active   compounds,   for   example   imidazolinones,   sulphonylureas,<br>
glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example, the "PAT" gene). The genes which<br>
impart the desired traits in question can also be present in combination with one<br>
another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned<br>
are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which<br>
are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for example, maize, cotton, soya<br>
beans),   KnockOut®   (for  example,   maize),   StarLink®   (for  example,   maize),<br>
Bollgard®   (cotton),   Nucotn®   (cotton)   and  NewLeaf®  (potato).   Examples   of<br>
herbicide-tolerant plants  which  may be mentioned  are maize  varieties, cotton<br>
varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup<br>
Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example, maize, cotton, soya bean), Liberty<br>
Link® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape), IMI® (tolerance to<br>
imidazolinones) and  STS® (tolerance to sulphonylureas,  for example,  maize).<br>
Herbicide-resistant plants  (plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide<br>
tolerance) which may be mentioned include the varieties sold under the name<br>
Clearfield® (for example, maize). Of course, these statements also apply to plant<br>
cultivars having these or still to be developed genetic traits, which plants will be<br>
developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated according to the invention in a particularly advantageous manner with the compounds of the general formula (I) or the active compound mixtures according to the invention. The preferred ranges stated above for the active compounds or mixtures also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the compounds or the mixtures specifically mentioned in the present textThe active compounds according to the invention act not only against plant, hygiene and stored product pests, but also in the veterinary medicine sector against animal parasites (ectoparasites), such as hard ticks, soft ticks, mange mites, leaf mites, flies<br><br>

Wood and processed wood products are especially preferably materials to be protected from insect infestation.<br><br>
Le A 35 213 Foreign Countries Nk/Kr/NT<br>
Wood and processed wood products which can be protected by the agents according to the invention or mixtures comprising these are to be understood as meaning, for example:<br>
building timber, wooden beams, railway sleepers, bridge components, boat jetties, wooden vehicles, boxes, pallets, containers, telegraph poles, wood panelling, wooden window frames and doors, plywood, chipboard, joinery or wooden products which are used quite generally in house-building or in building joinery.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can be used as such, in the form of concentrates or in generally customary formulations, such as powders, granules, solutions, suspensions, emulsions or pastes. The formulations mentioned can be prepared in a manner known per se, for example by mixing the active compounds according to the invention with at least one solvent or diluent, emulsifier, dispersing agent and/or binder or fixing agent, a water repellent, if appropriate siccatives and UV stabilizers and, if appropriate, dyestuffs and pigments, and also other processing auxiliaries.<br>

The synthetic resin used as the binder can be employed in the form of an emulsion, dispersion or solution. Bitumen or bituminous substances can also be used as binders in an amount of up to 10% by weight. Dyestuffs, pigments, water-repelling agents, odour correctants and inhibitors or anticorrosive agents and the like which are known per se can additionally be employed.<br>
It is preferred according to the invention for the composition or concentrate to comprise, as the organic chemical binder, at least one alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin and/or a drying vegetable oil. Alkyd resins having an oil content of more than 45% by weight, preferably 50 to 68% by weight, are preferably used according to the invention.<br>
All or some of the binder mentioned can be replaced by a fixing agent (mixture) or a plasticizer (mixture). These additives are intended to prevent evaporation of the active compounds and crystallization or precipitation. They preferably replace 0.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100% of the binder employed).<br>
The plasticizers originate from the chemical classes of phthalic acid esters, such as dibutyl, dioctyl or benzyl butyl phthalate, phosphoric acid esters, such as tributyl phosphate, adipic acid esters, such as di-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, stearates, such as butyl stearate or amyl stearate, oleates, such as butyl oleate, glycerol ethers or higher molecular weight glycol ethers, glycerol esters and p-toluenesulphonic acid esters.<br><br>
