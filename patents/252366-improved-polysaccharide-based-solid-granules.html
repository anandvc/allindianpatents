Polysaccharide-based products with improved easiness of use, process to make the same, and applications of the same<br>
Field of the invention<br>
This invention relates to water-soluble polysaccharide-based products that require less time and effort to incorporate into aqueous formulations, compared to existing polysaccharide products. This invention can be applied more particularly to cationic guar products to be used in cosmetic compositions-Background of the invention<br>
Polysaccharides and polysaccharide derivatives find many uses in compositions of the industry. These are for example used in oil-field fluids, paper industry, agricultural compositions, and cosmetic compositions. Polysaccharide and polysaccharide derivative are generally provided as solid powders.<br>
In the art of preparing cosmetic compositions, the polysaccharide or polysaccharide powder is generally pre-mixed with water to provide hydration thereof, and the pre-mix obtained usually undergoing a pH adjustment step to acidic pH, before mixing with the other ingredients. There is a need for improved polysaccharide-based ingredients and/or to improved processes of use of polysaccharide based ingredients.<br>
WO 99/47249 discloses extruded granules of a powdered hydrocolloid coated, especially native or nonionic guars, with a water-soluble non-ionic surfactant solid at room temperature, and a process to make the same. The granules are taught to be useful in agricultural formulations. These products have improved dispersibility and wettability in aqueous dispersions. However, it is believed that the intrinsic hydration rate of the hydrocolloid is low. Besides, cosmetic applications for these products are not disclosed.<br>
US 5003060 discloses porous particles of biopolymer such as Xanthane gum. readily dispersible in water, and a method to obtain these particles by spraying an aqueous solution of wetting and/or dispersing agent in a fluidized bed drier. However, it is believed that the intrinsic hydration rate of the hydrocolloid is low. Besides, an additional pH adjustment step would be required after having added this product into certain aqueous formulations.<br><br>
wo 97/48372 discloses an ingredient having a water-soluble or water-swellable polysaccharide partially agglomerated with a polyol, wherein the amount of polyol is at least about 10% of the total weight of the composition. This ingredient is used in toothpastes. The ingredient is said being substantially faster to disperse in solvent than the untreated material. However, it is believed that the intrinsic hydration rate of the hydrocolloid is low. Besides, an additional pH adjustment would be required after having added this product into certain aqueous formulations. A process to make toothpaste using this ingredient is claimed in WO 01/32132.<br>
EP 0313463 describes granulated ingredients comprising thickening non-anionic polysaccharides such as Xanthane gum, in which the polysaccharides particles are coated with 0.5 to 5% by weight of hydrolyzed gelatin. These granulated compositions disperse readily in water. A process to prepare these granules and their use to thicken aqueous formulations are also disclosed. The ingredients are taught to be useful in pharmaceutical formulation, and in foods. Yet, gelatin-coated polysaccharide products are not suitable for cosmetic and personal care formulations, which most customers expect to be free of animal proteins.<br>
US 4746690 (equivalent to DE 3518673) depicts powdered mixture of finely divided water-soluble cationic polymer (min. 69% by weight of particles 
EP 0517423 discloses a method to prepare readily dispersible polysaccharide-containing agglomerates, by spraying 0.1 to 3% by weight of a wetting agent on a finely divided hydrocolloid powder (max 0.5% &gt; 106 pm and min 15% 
WO 01/45647 describes shaped bodies which contain 5 to 40% of a thickening agent, 5 to 80% of disintegration auxiliary agent, and at least one cosmetic ingredient. It further describes a method for coloring hair by dissolving a tablet in water to obtain a hair coloring mixture.<br>
US 2003/0161876 discloses a process to prepare corn starch granules by coating starch powder with a binder dissolved in a solvent, and drying the granules. The corn starch granulates and their use as a tablet ingredient is also disclosed.<br><br>
other polysaccharides powders with improved dispersibility in water, and preparation methods are also disclosed in US 2003/0124195, EP 0597364, especially relevant to cellulosic polysaccharides, and EP 686666. However, these inventions involve using some additives such as glyoxal that may not be compatible with the targeted applications.<br>
US 2003/0017952 discloses a guar gum product with improved hydration rate, and a process to obtain such product by extruding and flaking guar splits. However the product disclosed is in a powder form, it thus generates dust during handling.<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a polysaccharide-based ingredient which provides easier use for preparing cosmetic compositions. Easier use is hereby provided by avoiding handling powders which are dusty and/or generate dust, by improving the flowability of the polysaccharide-based ingredient, by reducing the risk of powder caking in its container and in the processing equipment, by avoiding long hydration steps, and/or by avoiding pH adjustment steps. As the use is easier, the cosmetic composition can be improved, for example being lump-free, as the user will by-pass or shorten the hydration and/or pH adjustment and/or proper powder handling steps. A further object of this invention is to provide processes to prepare such products. Another further object of this invention is to provide applications for such products.<br>
Another or additional advantage of the polysaccharide-based ingredient is a reduction of odor: it is odortess or less odorant, especially for "fishy" amine odor. This is more comfortable for the user, and that can provide using less precautious and/or equipments. This is also an object of the invention to provide an ingredient with fewer odors, and a process to make the same.<br>
Brief summary of the invention<br>
Thus the invention provides polysaccharide-based solid granules comprising:<br>
-	at least 50% by weight, preferably at least 65%, preferably at least 75%. of a polysaccharide polymer or polysaccharide polymer derivative, and<br>
-	a binding and/or dispersing agent and/or wetting agent.<br><br>
The invention also relates to processes for making such granules, and to their use in cosmetic compositions, for example in shampoos or body-showers.<br>
The invention also relates a process for making a cosmetic composition, involving using the granules and/or the processes for making the granules.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
Definitions<br>
In the present application, the size of granules relates to the size that can be determined by a sieving test. A series of sieves are stacked in ascending order of aperture, and the granules sample is placed on the top sieve. The particles are separated and sorted on the screens according to their respective sizes by the combined actions of vibrations and rotations (Examples of equipment are Ro-tap from Tyler or Analysette 3 from Fritsch). or by the action of air flow (Air Jet Sieve A200LS-N from Hosokawa Alpine). The sieving should be carried out over a sufficient amount of time so that the weight of material recovered on each screen does not vary anymore. Granules having a size of higher than X mm are understood as granules where at least 50% by weight, preferably at least 90% by weight do not pass through a sieve having an opening of X mm. Granules having a size of less than Y mm are understood as granules where at least 50% by weight, preferably at least 90% by weight do pass through a sieve having an opening of Y mm. Openings of sieves can be expressed also as "Mesh" (the lower the Mesh the higher the opening and the granules size). Correspondence is provided below:<br><br>
In the present application, the particle size of the initial polysaccharide powder (before granulation) is defined  as the size  determined  by  Laser light<br><br>
diffraction. Some examples of equipment suited for this measure are the LS 130 Particle size analyzer from Beckman Coulter, or the Mastersizer 2000 from Malvern. These equipments determine the distribution of the powder particles according to their volume. The particle size of a powder sample is usually described by its D50. which is the median of the distribution (i.e half of the particles have a smaller equivalent diameter, and half of the particles have a larger equivalent diameter).<br>
In the present application, the Molecular weight of the polvsaccharide product is determined by Gel Permeation Chromatography coupled to a Multi Angle Laser Light Scattering (MALLS) detector. This technique gives absolute weight values based on calculations instead of relative values based on the known molecular weight of an external calibration standard. The molecular weight of the polysaccharide product is in fact the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) obtained by GPC. Hydration rate:<br>
The hydration rate or % of hydration can be determined as follows: Method A<br>
199 g of deionized water is placed in a 400 mL beaker. A magnetic stirrer is used to agitate the water.<br>
at t=0, a sample of product (granules or initial polysaccharide powder) equivalent to 1 g of polysaccharide (in order to obtain a 0.5% polysaccharide solution) is added to the water, and a stopwatch is started to record the time. The viscosity is measured every minute or every 5 minutes, using a Brookfield RV viscometer, fitted with spindle RV 2 at 20 rpm. Once the viscosity reaches a stable value (usually after about 15 to 30 minutes), this value is considered the final viscosity, corresponding to full hydration. The rate of hydration (%) for each time t is obtained by dividing the viscosity read at t by the final viscosity, and multiplying by 100%. Method B<br>
To measure the hydration rate, 2.0 pph potassium chloride, 0.14 pph of sodium bicarbonate, and 0.0080 pph of fumaric acid are dissolved in 250 mL of deionized water and placed in a Waring blender jar. In a separate vial, a mixture of the granules in 8*10 mL of isopropanol is made and then added to the aqueous solution in the Waring blender jar so that the resulting solution yields 0.48 pph (parts per hundred) of polysaccharide. All amounts are listed as parts by weight per 100 g of water (pph) unless otherwise indicated. The resultant mixture is mixed using the<br><br>
blender for thirty seconds. After thirty seconds, the mixing is stopped and the solution is transferred to a beaker. The viscosity is then measured using a Fann 35 viscometer at 300 rpm at one. two, three, four, five, and ten minute intervals. After ten minutes, the sample is covered and placed in a water bath at 75 - 80 °F. After sixty minutes in the water bath, the sample is removed and the viscosity is measured at sixty minutes. Full hydration is assumed to be achieved at sixty minutes. The % hydration is calculated by dividing the viscosity at the one, two, three, four, five, ten, and sixty minute intervals by the viscosity at sixty minutes and multiplying by 100.<br>
The formulation time is defined as the time as follows: 0.5% by weight of granules is added (tO) into distilled water at 25°C under stirring. Formulation time is the time when no lump can be observed visually, or the time when 70% preferably 90% of the viscosity measured after 60 minutes is achieved (viscosity measured regularly thereto).<br>
Granules<br>
The granules of the invention are advantageously dust-free and/or non dusting.<br>
In some embodiments the granules can comprise at least 90% by weight of the polysaccharide polymer or polymer derivative. In a prefen^ed embodiment the granules comprise less than 95% of the polymer or polymer derivative.<br>
The granules have preferably a size of higher than 100 pm, preferably of higher than 250 pm. In some embodiments the granules have a size of higher than 500 mm. The granules have preferably a size of lower than 5 mm, preferably of lower than 2.5 mm. The size can be especially of higher than 0.25 mm and lower than 2.5 mm.<br>
In some interesting embodiments, at least 80%. preferably at least 90% of the granules are within a range of 100 pm to 1000 |jm or preferably within 100 to 800. It is preferred that 70% of the granules is are within a range of 100 pm to 500 pm.<br>
The granules might comprise functional ingredients further to the binding and/or dispersing agent(s) and acidic compound. The functional ingredients are ingredients providing a benefit in  cosmetic  compositions such  as  conditioning<br><br>
agents, UV-filters. dyes, anti-dandruff agents, anti-bacterial agents, rheology modifiers. However, in particular embodiments the granules do not comprise such functional ingredients.<br>
Preferably, the granules do not contain hydrolyzed gelatin or other animal protein based compound.<br>
The granules can have a formulation time of less than 5 minutes, preferably of less than 1 minute, preferably of less than 30 seconds.<br>

The polysaccharide derivative can be a derivative comprising cationic derivation groups, and optionally further derivation groups being anionic or non ionic, said cationic derivation groups and optional further derivation groups being hydrophilic or hydrophobic. Examples that may be mentioned include cationic polysaccharide derivatives (comprising cationic derivation groups), for instance guar or cellulose derivatives. Cationic polymers functionalized with hydrophobic groups, for instance C1-C14 and preferably C2~C8 alkyl chains, optionally containing a hydroxyl group, may be used. These hydrophobic groups are attached to the main polymer chain via ether bonds.<br>
The polysaccharide derivative is preferably a cationic guar, comprising cationic derivation groups, and optionally further non ionic groups.<br>
Moreover, and in the case of hydrophobic or nonhydrophobic modified cationic guars, the cationic group is a quaternary ammonium group bearing three radicals, which may be identical or different, chosen from hydrogen, an alkyl radical containing 1 to 22 carbon atoms, more particularly 1 to 14 and advantageously 1 to 3 carbon atoms. The counterion is a halogen, preferably chlorine.<br>
In the case of hydrophobic or nonhydrophobic modified cationic celluloses, the cationic group is a quaternary ammonium group bearing three radicals, which may be identical or different, chosen from hydrogen and an alkyl radical containing 1<br><br>
to 10 carbon atoms, more particular 1 to 6 and advantageously 1 to 3 carbon atoms. The counterion is.a halogen, preferably chlorine.<br>
Among the cationic guar derivatives that may be mentioned are guar hydroxypropyl trimonium chloride (INCI name), for example Jaguar C13S. C14S, or C17, Jaguar Excel and Jaguar C 2000 sold by the company Rhodia or hydroxypropyl guar hydroxypropyl trimonium chloride (INCI name), for example Jaguar C162 sold by Rhodia.<br>
Among the cationic cellulose derivatives that may be used are trimethylammonium-3-propyl cellulose poly(1,2-oxyethanediyl)-2-hydroxy ether chloride or polyquaternium-10. for instance Polymer JR400 (INPI name: PQ10) sold by the company Amerchol.<br>
Nonionic polysaccharide derivatives, for example hydroxypropyl guar, may also be used.<br>

The higher the molecular weight, the better the conditioning performance is. Surprisingly it is possible to provide a polysaccharide-based ingredient that is easy to use and has good conditioning performances.<br>
In the case of cationic polysaccharide derivatives, the degree of hydroxyalkylation (molar substitution or MS) is preferably between 0 and 1.2. Still in the case of these polymers, the degree of cationicity (degree of substitution or DS) is more particulariy between 0.01 and 0.6.

Most preferred polysaccharide are guar and guar derivatives, such as cationic guar or hydroxypropylated cationic guar powders, especially Jaguar C13S, Jaguar C14S, Jaguar C17, Jaguar C162, Jaguar Excel, and Jaguar C2000 available from Rhodia.<br>
Binding and/or dispersing agents include agents referred to as wetting agents. Various  binding   and/or  dispersing   and/or  wetting   agents   can   be   used   to agglomerate the initial powder particles in order to form larger granules. These<br><br>
agents might participate also in allowing dispersion in water by user. Examples of such agents include:<br>
-	water,<br>
-	inorganic salts,<br>
-	a anionic surfactant,<br>
-	a non-ionic surfactant,<br>
-	a water-dispersible polymer.<br>
-	a mono- or di-saccharide solution<br>
-	a polyol<br>
-	a fatty acid, or<br>
-	a mixture thereof.<br>
In practice, an additive which has both a good wetting capacity and dispersing capacity, or a combination of a wetting agent and a dispersing agent, will advantageously be employed. A total amount of additive(s) of from 0.5 to 10% by weight of the granule is generally adequate to provide an excellent combination of dispersibility and solubility. However, larger amounts could be employed depending on the intended application and the specific properties of the additive(s).<br>
In an embodiment, the binding and/or dispersing and/or wetting agent is water, preferably up to 100% of the weight of the polysaccharide (up to 50% by weight of the granules).<br>
Advantageously the granules comprise less than 50% by weight of the binding and/or dispersing and/or wetting agent, preferably less than 25% by weight.<br>
Examples of inorganic salts that can be used include sodium chloride, potassium chloride, ammonium chloride, sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate and ammonium sulfate. The inorganic salt can help in avoiding formation of lumps by assisting in controlling the hydration kinetics. Without being bound to any theory, it is believed that inorganic salts such as sodium chloride can help in limiting the hydration kinetics upon dispersing in water and help in providing progressive but quick enough hydration. The amount of inorganic salt in the granules can be of up to 50% by weight. It is preferably comprised between 5 and 25%, preferably between 10 and 20%.<br><br>
The granules can comprise an acidic compound, such as citric acid, fumaric acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, or a mixture thereof. The acidic compound can provide viscosity, and/or help in releasing the polysaccharide from complexes. For example it can help in de-complexing cationic polysaccharide, such as cationic guar, in the form of a complexe with low amounts of borax. The acidic compound can help in removing the borax, and. thus in hydrating the polysaccharide or polysaccharide derivative. The amount of acidic compound in the granules can be of up to 10% by weight It is preferably comprised between 1 and 5%.<br>
The granules optionally comprise anti-cakinq and/or flowability enhancing agents. Examples of such agents include inorganic particles such as thickening amorphous silicas. Compounds such as Tixosil 38, 38A. 38AB, T43, all marketed by Rhodia can for example be used. The granules can for example include from 0 (included) to 1% of such an agent.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment the granules can t&gt;e obtained by combining;<br>
-	from 5 to 25 parts by weight, preferably from 10 to 20 parts, of an inorganic salt, preferably sodium chloride,<br>
-	from 1 to 10 parts by weight, preferably from 1 to 5 parts, of an acidic compound, preferably citric add,<br>
-	from 60 to 100 parts by weight, preferably from 75 to 90 parts, of the<br>
polysaccharide, preferably of a cationic guar.<br>
Water can also be combined and removed. Thus the granules can comprise:<br>
-	from 5 to 25 parts by weight, preferably from 10 to 20 parts, of an inorganic salt, preferably sodium chloride,<br>
-	from 1 to 10 parts by weight, preferably from 1 to 5 parts, of an acidic compound, preferably citric acid, and<br>
-	from 60 to 100 parts by weight, preferably from 75 to 90 parts, of the<br>
polysaccharide, preferably of a cationic guar. The polysaccharide or derivative can<br>
comprise from 5 to 15% of water.<br><br>
According to a specific embodiment the granules are prepared by a process comprising the steps of:<br>
(1") fluidizing the polysaccharide or polysaccharide derivative, in a powdered form, in a stream of gas.<br>
(2") agglomerating the powder by spraying an aqueous solution containing at least the binding and/or dispersing and/or wetting agent, and/or an aqueous solution of an acidic compound, for example an aqueous solution comprising an inorganic salt and the acidic compound, to form granules, and (3") drying the granules, for example in the fluidized bed.<br>
An anti-caking and/or flowability enhancing agent is added after the drying step.<br>
According to another specific embodiment the granules are prepared by a process comprising the steps of:<br>
(1'")   Mixing   a  polysaccharide  or  polysaccharide  derivative  powder  with  the binding/and/or dispersing and/or wetting agent, and optionally with the adding compound, to obtain a powder mix. for example a powder mix comprising an inorganic salt and an acidic compound, (2'") fluidizing the mix in a stream of gas,<br>
(3'") agglomerating the powder mixture by spraying water or an aqueous solution containing some binding and/or dispersing and/or wetting agent, and/or some acidic compound, to form granules, and (3"*) drying the granules, for example in the fluidized bed.<br>
An anti-caking and/or flowability enhancing agent is added after the drying step.<br>
In the above processes, fluidizing and agglomerating steps can be perfonmed with equipments comprising an atomizer. The equipments can also include a fluid-bed dryer. A multi stage dryer (MSD) can be used.<br><br>

Preferably the water-soluble surfactant solid at room temperature being a non-ionic surfactant, is solid at 32.22'C (90T), preferably at 48.88*'C (120T).

-	the granules optionally comprise further ingredients, such as antifoaming agents, acidic compounds, inorganic fillers, such as sodium bicarbonate.<br>
In a first fashion, the granules can be prepared by a process comprising:<br>
(1)	providing a water soluble nonionic surfactant that is a solid at room temperature or above;<br>
(2)	melting said solid surfactant to a molten state and mixing the molten surfactant with particles of powdered polysaccharide or polysaccharide derivative in a heated state to coat the hydrocolloid powder;<br>

The molten surfactant is advantageously sprayed onto heated particles of powdered polysaccharide or polysaccharide derivative.<br>
In the process the dry ingredients other than the normally solid surfactant are blended or mixed together in a suitable mixing vessel to form an essentially uniform mixture thereof. In a separate vessel or container the normally solid nonionic surfactant is heated to a temperature above its melting point and the molten surfactant is then introduced into a heated mixture of the dry ingredients by any suitable means, such as by spraying, with suitable intense mixing or blending to coat the hydrocolloid powder and other dry ingredient particles. The heated coated powder fonmulation can be fed into a suitable extruder and the surfactant coated particle mixture extruded through the extruder and extruder die as warm pellets whereupon the extruded hydrocolloid granules are cooled to below the solidification point of the molten surfactant binder.<br>

(3') adding homogeneously the molten water-soluble surfactant on the mixture of<br>
polysaccharide or polysaccharide derivative and optional other ingredients in a<br>
heated state to coat all particles,<br>
(4') generating agglomerates in the powder mixer, and<br>
(5*) cooling the agglomerates in the powder mixer to solidify the molten surfactant.<br>

Stabilizer and/or conditioning agent and/or conditioning aid<br>
The cosmetic composition according to the invention may advantageously comprise at least one stabilizer and/or conditioning agent and/or conditioning aid. These are also occasionally referred to as suspension agents. The term "conditioning aid" means that the presence of the agent improves the conditioning associated with other compounds, for example silicone oils. The agents are understood as being different from the polyorganosiloxane of formula (I). Such agents are known to those skilled in the art. The composition according to the invention may comprise several of these agents (mixtures of combinations), to combine their effects and/or create synergism. Moreover, certain agents may exert several functions. This is the case, for example, for polysaccharides, and cationic derivatives thereof, for example cationic guar derivatives.<br>
The weight proportion of such agents may typically be from 0.1% to 10% by weight and preferably from 0.3% to 8% by weight for polysaccharides or other agents.<br>

Rhodia as a concentrate with other ingredients under the name Mirasheen. This<br>
compound may typically be present in an amount of from 3% to 10% and preferably<br>
from 5% to 8% by weight relative to the composition.<br>
Mention may also be made of viscosifiers, gelling agents or texturing agents, for instance anionic acrylic copolymers of Aculyne type sold by ISP or Rohm &amp; Haas, polysaccharides and the noncationic derivatives thereof, such as cellulose derivatives, for instance hydroxypropylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, nonionic guar derivatives, for instance hydroxypropyl guar (for example the Jaguar HP products sold by Rhodia), locust bean gum. tara gum or cassia gum, xanthan gum (for example the Rhodicare products sold by Rhodia), succinoglycans (for example Rheozan sold by Rhodia), alginates, carrageenans, chitin derivatives or any other polysaccharide with a texturing function.

These polymers may have a stabilizing or structuring action on the compositions, and/or a conditioning action (deposition on the surface of the skin or the hair).<br>
Examples that may be mentioned include cationic polysaccharide derivatives, for instance guar or cellulose derivatives. Cationic polymers functionalized with hydrophobic groups, for instance C1-C14 and preferably C2-C8 aikyi chains, optionally containing a hydroxy! group, may be used. These hydrophobic groups are attached to the main polymer chain via ether bonds.<br>
Moreover, and in the case of hydrophobic or nonhydrophobic modified cationic guars, the cationic group is a quaternary ammonium group bearing three radicals, which may be identical or different, chosen from hydrogen, an alkyl radical containing 1 to 22 carbon atoms, more particularly 1 to 14 and advantageously 1 to 3 carbon atoms. The counterion is a halogen, preferably chlorine.<br>
In the case of hydrophobic or nonhydrophobic modified cationic celluloses, the cationic group is a quaternary ammonium group bearing three radicals, which may be identical or different, chosen from hydrogen and an alkyl radical containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms, more particular 1 to 6 and advantageously 1 to 3 carbon atoms. The counterion is a halogen, preferably chlorine.<br>
Among the cationic guar derivatives that may be mentioned are guar hydroxypropyl trimonium chloride (Jaguar C13S, C14S, or C17, Jaguar Excel and Jaguar C 2000 sold   by the  company Rhodia  Chimie)  or  hydroxypropyl   guar<br><br>
hydroxypropyl trimonium chloride (Jaguar C162 sold by Rhodia).<br>
Among the cationic cellulose derivatives that may be used are trimethylammonium-3-propyl cellulose poly(1.2-oxyethanediyl)-2-hydroxy ether chloride or polyquaternium-10. for instance Polymer JR400 (INPI name: PQ10) sold by the company Amerchol.<br>
Nonionic polysaccharide derivatives, for example hydroxypropyl guar, may also be used.<br>
Synthetic polymers, and more particularly homopolymers such as polymethacrylamidopropyl trimonium chloride (Po!ycare133 sold by the company Rhodia Chimie), may also be suitable.<br>
The cationic polymers more particularly have a weight-average molar mass of at least 2000g/mol and more preferably between 2 x 10^ and 3 x 10^ g/mol. depending on their possible degree of polymerization. The weight-average molar masses of the polymers are usually measured by size exclusion. They may optionally be measured directly by light scattering or from the intrinsic viscosity using a calibration, according to: "Viscosity-Molecular weight relationship, intrinsic chain flexibility and dynamic solution properties of guar galactomannan" by G. Robinson, S.B. Ross Murphy, E.R. Morris, Carbohydrate Research 107, p.17-32, 1982.<br>
In the case of cationic polysaccharide derivatives, the degree of hydroxyalkylation (molar substitution or MS) is preferably between 0 and 1.2. Still in the case of these polymers, the degree of cationicity (degree of substitution or DS) is more particulariy between 0.01 and 0.6. This is the case, for example, for the Jaguar C162 and C2000 products sold by the company Rhodia Chimie.<br>
Polvoroanosiloxanes fsilicone^<br>
The composition may comprise a silicone (silicone oil). The terms "silicone" and "polyorganosiloxane" mean any organosiloxane compound comprising alkyl (for example methyl) groups and/or functionalized with groups other than alkyl groups.<br>
The polyorganosiloxane is advantageously (in shampoos and conditioners in<br>
particular) a nonvolatile and water-insoluble polyorganosiloxane. It advantageously<br>
has a viscosity of between 1000 and 2 000 000 mPa.s and preferably between 5000<br>
and    500 000 mPa.s.	The    polyorganosiloxane    may    especially    be    a<br>
polydimethylorganosiloxanesiloxane   ("PDMS",   INCI   name:   dimethicone)   or   a<br><br>
polyorganosiloxane containing amine (for example amodimethicone according to the INCi name), quaternary ammonium (for example the silicone quaternum 1 to 10 products according to the INCI name) hydroxy! (terminal or non-terminal) or polyoxyalkyiene groups, for example polyethylene oxide and/or polypropylene oxide (as end groups, as a block within a PDMS chain, or as grafts), or several of these groups.<br>
The amount of polyorganosiloxane present in the composition may typically be from 0.1% to 5% by weight, for example from 0.5% to 1.5% or 2%.<br>
The polyorganosiloxane (silicones) is(are) preferably present in the composition in emulsion form (liquid droplets of silicone dispersed in the aqueous phase). The emulsion may especially be an emulsion whose mean droplet size is greater than or equal to 2 ym, and/or whose mean droplet size is greater than or between 0.15 pm and 2 pm, or whose mean droplet size is less than or equal to 0.15 pm.<br>
The droplets of the emulsion may be of relatively large or small size. Reference may thus be made to microemulsions, miniemulsions or macroemulsions. In the present patent application, the term "emulsion" especially covers all these types of emulsion. Without wishing to be bound to any theory, it is pointed out that microemulsions are generally thermodynamically stable systems generally comprising large amounts of emulsifiers. The other emulsions are generally systems in thermodynamically unstable state, conserving for a certain time, in metastable state, the mechanical energy supplied during the emulsification. These systems generally comprise smaller amounts of emulsifiers.<br>
The emulsions may be obtained by mixing the vector, preferably an aqueous vector, the polyorganosiloxane and in general an emulsifier, followed by emulsification. This may be referred to as in situ emulsification.<br>
The compositions in emulsion form may also be obtained by mixing the vector, preferably an aqueous vector, with an emulsion prepared beforehand of droplets comprising the polyorganosiloxane in an external phase, which is preferably miscible with the cosmetically acceptable vector, preferably of the same nature as said vector, preferably an aqueous vector This embodiment may be prefen-ed since it is simple to perform. In addition, this embodiment is particularly suitable for preparing cosmetic compositions in which the organopolysiloxane is in microemulsion form. This may be referred to as prior emulsification.<br><br>
According to one particular embodiment, the emulsion is a microemulsion whose droplet size is less than 0.15 pm. In this embodiment, the composition preferably comprises a proportion of greater than 10% by weight and preferably at least 15% by weight of emulsifier relative to the weight of polyorganosiloxane.<br>
The size of the microemulsion droplets may be measured on an emulsion prepared prior to its introduction into the cosmetic composition, by dynamic light scattering (DQEL). for example as described below. The apparatus used consists, for example, of a Spectra-Physics 2020 laser, a Brookhaven 2030 correlator and the associated computer-based equipment. Since the sample is concentrated, it is diluted in deionized water and filtered through a 0.22 ^m filter to have a final concentration of 2% by weight. The diameter obtained is an apparent diameter. The measurements are taken at angles of 90** and 135". For the size measurements, besides the standard analysis with cumulents, three exploitations of the autocorrelation function are used (exponential sampling or EXPSAM described by Prof. Pike, the "Non Negatively Constrained Least Squares" or NNLS method, and the CONTIN method described by Prof. Provencher). which each give a size distribution weighted by the scattered intensity, rather than by the mass or the number. The refractive index and the viscosity of the water are taken into account.<br>
According to one advantageous mode, the microemulsion is transparent. The microemulsion may have, for example, a transmittance of at least 90% and preferably of at least 95% at a wavelength of 600 nm, for example measured using a Lambda 40 UV-visible spectrometer, at a concentration of 0.5% by weight in water. In this context, the cosmetic composition may advantageously he transparent. It may have, for example, a transmittance of at least 90% and preferably of at least 95% at a wavelength of 600 nm, measured, for example, using a Lambda 40 UV-visible spectrometer.<br>
According to another particular embodiment, the emulsion is an emulsion whose mean droplet size is greater than or equal to 0,15 [jm, for example greater than 0.5 pm, or 1 pm. or 2 pm, or 10 pm, or 20 pm, and preferably less than 100 pm. The droplet size may be measured on an emulsion prepared prior to its introduction into the cosmetic composition, or directly on the cosmetic composition diluted in water, by optical microscopy and/or laser granulometry (Horiba LA-910 laser scattering analyzer). In this embodiment, the composition preferably comprises a proportion of less than 10% by weight of emulsifier relative to the weight of<br><br>
polyorganosiloxane.<br>
Emulsifiers that are useful for preparing the polyorganosiloxane emulsion are especially nonionic surfactants, preferably polyalkoxylated, for example chosen from alkoxylated fatty alcohols, alkoxylated triglycerides, alkoxylated fatty acids, alkoxylated sorbitan esters, alkoxylated fatty amines, alkoxylated bis(1 -phenylethyOphenois, alkoxylated tris(1-phenylethyl)phenols and alkoxylated alkyl-phenols, in which the number of alkoxy and more particularly oxyethylene and/or oxypropylene units is such that the HLB value is greater than or equal to 10.<br>
Among the water-soluble silicone derivatives in the composition that may be mentioned, inter alia, are dimethicone copolyols (Mirasil DMCO sold by the company Rhodia Chimie).<br>
As regards the silicones that are in the form of dispersions insoluble in the water of the composition, water-insoluble and nonvolatile organopolysiloxanes may suitably be used, among which mention may be made of polyalkylsiloxane, polyarylsiloxane and poiyalkylarylsiloxane oils, gums or resins, or water-insbluble functionalized derivatives thereof, or mixtures thereof, which are nonvolatile.<br>
Said organopolysiloxanes are considered as water-insoluble and nonvolatile when their solubility in water is less than 50 g/liter and their intrinsic viscosity is at least 3000 mPa.s at 25^C.<br>
Examples of water-insoluble and nonvolatile organopolysiloxanes or silicones that may be mentioned include silicone gums, for instance the diphenyl dimethicone gum sold by the company Rhodia Chimie, and preferably polydimethylsiloxanes with a viscosity at least equal to 6 x 10^ mPa.s at ZS'^C. even more preferably those with a viscosity of greater than 2x10® mPa.s at 25^0, such as Mirasil DM 500 000® sold by the company Rhodia Chimie.<br>
According to the invention, the water-insoluble and nonvolatile organopolysiloxane or silicone is in a form dispersed in the cosmetic composition containing it.<br>
Said organopolysiloxane or silicone is in the form of particles or droplets whose size may be chosen as a function of the nature of the cosmetic composition or of the desired performance for said composition. In genera!, this size may range from 0.01 to 70 microns.<br>
Preferably, this size is from about 0.1 to 50 microns and most particularly from about 1 to 30 microns.<br><br>
To facilitate their implementation, these organopolysiloxanes may be dispersed or dissolved beforehand in volatile or nonvolatile low-viscosity silicone derivatives, and then emulsified in the cosmetic composition.<br>
Among these low-viscosity silicones that may be mentioned are volatile cyclic silicones and polydimethylsiloxanes of low mass.<br>
Functionalized silicone derivatives, for instance amino derivatives, may also be used, directly in the form of emulsions or starting with a preformed microemulsion. They may be compounds known under the term "amino silicones" or "hydroxylated silicones". Mention is made of Mirasil ADM-E (amodimethicone) sold by the company Rhodia, and dimethiconol.<br>
