				<td>PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF THE CALCIUM SALT OF ROSUVASTATIN (E)-7-'4-(4-<br>
FLUOROPHENYL)-6-ISOPROPYL-2-'METHYL(METHYLSULFONYL)AMINO!PYRMIDIM -5-YL!(3R,5S)<br>
3,5~DIHYDROXYHEPT-6-ENOIC ACID AND CRYSTALLINE INTERMEDIATES THEREOF<br>
This invention concerns improvements to a chemical process, particularly a chemical<br>
process for manufacture of (E)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-<br>
[methyl(memylsulfonyl)arnino]pyrimidin-5-yl](3/?,5,S)-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6--enoic acid<br>
calcium salt (1) (illustrated below), which is useful for the production of a pharmaceutical<br>
useful in the treatment of, inter alia, hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipoproteinemia and<br>
atherosclerosis. This invention also concerns crystalline intermediates useful in the chemical<br>
process.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The sodium salt (3) and calcium salt (1) of the compound (£)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-<br>
6-isopropyl-2-[methyl(memylsulfonyl)amino]pyrimidin-5-yl](3R,55)-3,5-dihydroxyhept<br>
enoic acid (hereinafter referred to as the 'Agent') were disclosed in European Patent 0521471.<br>
This patent also describes a process for the synthesis of the calcium salt (1), via the dihydroxy<br>
ester (2) and the sodium salt (3), as shown in Scheme 1 below. The calcium salt thus formed<br>
is then collected and dried and may be processed further as required.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Our International Patent Application WO 00/49014 describes an alternative route to<br>
the calcium salt (1), also via the sodium salt (3), from the compound tert-butyl (E)-(6-{2-[4-<br>
(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-[methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino]pyrimidin-5-yl]vinyl}(4R,6S)-<br>
2,2-dimethyl[l,3]dioxan-4-yl)acetate (BEM) (4), which is exemplified as shown in (Figure Removed)<br>
As described in WO 00/49014, the transformation from BEM (4) to the calcium salt<br>
(1) may be carried out via the methylamine salt (5) as shown in Scheme 2. Isolation of this<br>
intermediate crystalline methylamine salt allows purification by recrystallisation before final<br>
formation of the (amorphous) calcium salt. However formation of the methylamine salt<br>
introduces an extra step into the process, which is generally undesirable for manufacture (for<br>
example because of additional cost and the potential for introduction of additional impurities).<br>
The transformation from BEM (4) to the sodium salt (3) in Scheme 2 takes place in<br>
two steps as shown below in Scheme 3.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Treatment with hydrochloric acid hydrolyses the acetal to the diol (6) (referred to<br>
herein as BED), then treatment with sodium hydroxide hydrolyses the ester to give the sodium<br>
salt (3) of the parent carboxylic acid. The intermediate compound BED (6) is not isolated in<br>
the process described in WO 00/49014. The analogous methyl ester (2) was described in<br>
European Patent 0521471 as a syrup and therefore, by analogy, isolation of BED (6) would<br>
not be expected to provide any advantages to the process.<br>
However we have surprisingly found that BED and other (l-6C)alkyl ester analogues<br>
are generally crystalline compounds which may advantageously be isolated and recrystallised,<br>
thus removing the need for isolation of an intermediate salt such as the methylamine salt in<br>
order for purification to be carried out.<br>
Therefore the present invention provides a process for the manufacture of the calcium<br>
salt of (E)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-[methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino]pyrimidin-5-<br>
yl](3R,55)-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6-enoic acid, comprising:<br>
a) acid hydrolysis of an acetal protecting group in a compound of the formula (7)<br>
wherein A is an acetal or ketal protecting group and R is (l-6C)alkyl, and isolation of the<br>
resulting crystalline compound of the formula (8);<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
b) optional recrystallisation of the compound of the formula (8);<br>
c) hydrolysis of the ester group in the compound (8) to give a dihydroxy carboxylate<br>
derivative (9) (wherein M is hydrogen or a metal counterion other than calcium) or a<br>
compound of the formula (1); and<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
d) where necessary, conversion of a compound of the formula (9) into a compound of the<br>
formula (1).<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided crystalline compounds of the<br>
formula (8).<br>
Furthermore, we have found that some compounds of the formula (7), which are<br>
analogues of BEM (4) are also crystalline and are themselves useful intermediates which may<br>
be recrystallised if necessary to improve the quality of the material. These crystalline<br>
compounds are novel and each independently provides a further aspect of the invention.<br>

Figure 7.<br>
A crystalline polymorph of BEM (4) is provided as a further aspect of the invention.<br>
The X-ray powder diffraction spectra were determined by mounting a sample of the<br>
crystalline form on Siemans single silicon crystal (SSC) wafer mounts and spreading out the<br>
sample into a thin layer with the aid of a microscope slide. The sample was spun at 30<br>
revolutions per minute (to improve counting statistics) and irradiated with X-rays generated<br>
by a copper long-fine focus tube operated at 40kV and 40mA with a wavelength of 1.5406<br>
angstroms. The collimated x-ray source was passed through an automatic variable divergence<br>
slit set at V20 (20mm path length) and the reflected radiation directed through a 2mm<br>
antiscatter slit and a 0.2mm detector slit. The sample was exposed for 4 seconds per 0.02<br>
degree 2-theta increment (continuous scan mode) over the range 2 degrees to 40 degrees <br>
theta in theta-theta mode. The running time was 2 hours 6 minutes and 40 seconds. The<br>
instrument was equipped with a scintillation counter as detector. Control and data capture<br>
was by means of a DECpc LPv 433sx personal computer running with Diffrac AT (Socabim)<br>
software.<br>
It will be understood that the 2-theta values of an X-ray powder diffraction pattern<br>
may vary slightly from one machine to another or from one sample to another, and so the<br>
values quoted are not to be construed as absolute. It will also be understood that the relative<br>
intensities of peaks may vary according to the orientation of the sample under test so that the<br>
intensities in the XRD traces included herein are illustrative and not intended to be used for<br>
absolute comparison.<br>
The crystalline forms obtained according to the present invention are substantially free<br>
from other crystal and non-crystal forms of each compound of the formula 7 or 8. The term<br>
"substantially free from other crystal and non-crystal forms" shall be understood to mean that<br>
the desired crystal form contains less than 50%, preferably less than 10%, more preferably<br>
less than 5% of any other form of the compound.<br>
Suitable values for the acetal protecting group A are as described in EPOS 19847. A<br>
preferred value for A is iso-propylidene such that the compound of the formula (7) is a<br>
compound of the formula (7a).<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Conveniently, in compounds of the formulae 7,7a and 8, R is (2-6C)alkyl. More<br>
conveniently, R is (2-5C)alkyl.<br>
Suitably R is selected from methyl, ethyl, propyl, iso-propyl, butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl<br>
and n-hexyl.<br>
Preferably R is selected from methyl, ethyl, iso-propyl, tert-butyl and n-hexyl.<br>
More preferably R is selected from ethyl, iso-propyl and tert-butyl.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a process for the manufacture of<br>
the calcium salt of (£)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-<br>

comprising:<br>
a) acid hydrolysis of an acetal protecting group in a compound of the formula (7a)<br>

(Figure Removed)<br>
b) optional recrystallisation of the compound of the formula (8);<br>
c) hydrolysis of the ester group in the compound (8) to give a dihydroxy carboxylate<br>

It will be appreciated that the process described in WO 00/49014 for isolation of the<br>
amorphous calcium salt of the Agent, or the process described in WO2004/014872, for<br>
precipitation of the amorphous form of the calcium salt of the Agent from a (substantially)<br>
aqueous solution of a different salt form, will generally lead to a proportion of residual<br>
calcium salt of the Agent in waste solutions such as the mother liquors remaining after the<br>
precipitated salt has been filtered off. Even a very small proportion of such residue may<br>
represent significant financial loss if the process is carried out repeatedly on a commercial<br>
manufacturing scale. Any reduction in such residue also potentially provides environmental<br>
benefits, reducing the amount of treatment that effluent requires before it can be disposed of.<br>
We have found that this loss may be avoided by treatment of said waste solutions<br>
(such as mother liquors) such that the residue calcium salt of the Agent may be isolated as<br>
crystalline lactone, optionally re-crystallised and then re-treated to form the desired calcium<br>
salt of the Agent. Thus lactone has value as a processing aid for isolation of the amorphous<br>
form of the Agent.<br>

vDacetate<br>
Sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (80.47 mL, l.OM in tetrahydrofuran (THF)) was added<br>
dropwise to a cooled solution of diphenyl [4-(4-fluoropheny)-6-isopropyl-2-<br>
[rnethyl(methylsulfonyl)amino]pyrimidin-5-ylmethyl] phosphine oxide (40.43 g, 75 mmol) in<br>
THF (477.1 mL) at -65°C over 30 minutes, maintaining the temperature at -65°C. Isopropyl-<br>
2-[(4R,6S)-6-formyI-2,2-dimethyl-l,3-dioxan-4-yl}acetate in toluene (21.68 g) was added<br>
dropwise to the solution over 35 minutes, maintaining the temperature at -65°C. The contents<br>
of the vessel were kept at -65°C for 15 minutes, then allowed to warm evenly to 10°C over 80<br>
minutes. Water (40.4 mL) followed by acetic acid (6.87 g, 114 mmol) were added to give a<br>
two phase light yellow solution. The batch was then distilled at atmospheric pressure to<br>
remove - 485 mL of distillates. This solution was washed sequentially with water (84 mL),<br>
7.0% w/w sodium bicarbonate (92.6 g), 1.8% w/w sodium bicarbonate (91.1 g) and water<br>
(63.5 mL). The resulting organic phase was distilled under vacuum at 270 mbar to leave ~ 95<br>
mL of solution in the distillation flask (removing ~ 229mL of distillates). Methanol (202 mL)<br>
at 50°C was charged to the flask and the solution distilled at atmospheric pressure, removing<br>
134 mL of distillates. A further portion of methanol (229 mL) at 50°C was added to the<br>
solution and the batch cooled to 40°C over 30 minutes. The batch was cooled to 25°C over 30<br>
minutes, 0-5°C over 30 minutes, then chilled to -8°C over 20 minutes and kept at this<br>
temperature for 30 minutes. The solid was collected by vacuum filtration, washed with 2<br>
portions of cooled (-8°C) methanol (2 x 80.6 mL) then dried in a vacuum oven at 50°C, 200<br>

Analogues with different ester groups R may be made as above using the appropriate<br>
starting materials, with the following exceptions:<br>
For the ethyl derivative: after the acetic acid quench the mixture was evaporated to<br>
dryness onto silica gel (Merck, 230-400 mesh) and added to a short plug of silica. Elution was<br>
performed with 25-27.5% ethyl acetate in iso-hexane. The isolated product was then<br>
crystallised from methanol (150 mL) as described in the method above.<br>
For the methyl derivative, the crude product was evaporated to dryness onto silica<br>
after the first sodium bicarbonate treatment. Purification was performed on silica gel as for the<br>
ethyl derivative (eluting with 14,16 and 20% ethyl acetate in iso-hexane). The product was<br>
crystallised from methanol.<br>

Water (35mL) was added to bring the total volume to 170mL. The solution was heated to<br>
40°C before addition of a solution of calcium chloride di-hydrate (3.05 g) in water (29.5 mL)<br>
over 20 min, maintaining the reaction mixture at 38-41 °C.<br>
The reaction mixture was stirred for a further 15 min at 40°C, then cooled to 20°C and stirred<br>
at this temperature for a further 15min. The resulting suspension was filtered, washed with<br>
water (3 x 53 mL) and dried to give (E)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-<br>
[methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino]pyrimidin-5-yl] (3R,5S)-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6-enoic acid<br>
calcium salt (17.13g).<br>
Synthesis of starting materials<br>
Isopropvl-2-r(4R.6S)-6-formyl-2.2-dimethyl-1.3-dioxan-4-vllacetate<br>
Chlorine gas (2469.6 mL, 118 mmol) was charged to toluene (373.3 mL) at -60°C. Dimethyl<br>
sulphide (11.67 mL, 121 mmol) was then added dropwise to the cooled solution over 30<br>
minutes, keeping the contents at -60°C. After 30 minutes at this temperature, isopropyl 2-<br>
[(4R,6S)-6-formyl-2,2-dimethyl-l,3-dioxan-4-yl}acetate (24.56 g, 95 mmol) in toluene (46.7<br>
mL) was added dropwise to the vessel over 30 minutes, maintaining the internal temperature<br>
at -60°C. The reaction mixture was agitated at -60°C for 30 minutes followed by the<br>
dropwise addition of triethylamine (26.36 g, 261 mmol) over 30 minutes, allowing the<br>
internal temperature to rise to -50°C. The reaction mixture was then allowed to warm to 25°C<br>
evenly over 75 minutes. The resulting slurry was stirred at 25°C for 30 minutes, then water<br>
(77 mL) was added and the mixture agitated for 30 minutes. The aqueous layer was separated<br>
and the pH checked (pH should be between 7.5 and 8.5). The resulting organic portion was<br>
washed with water (23.3 mL) and the organic portion separated for vacuum distillation at 150<br>
mbar. Distillation was continued until ~350 mL of toluene had been removed. Toluene (350<br>
mL) was added to the flask and the vacuum distillation repeated at 150 mbar to remove -350<br>
mL of toluene. The resulting solution was transferred to a flask containing activated 4<br>
angstrom molecular sieves and left at ambient temperature overnight. This solution was used<br>
directly for the coupling stage.<br>
Analogues with different ester groups R may be made as above with the following exceptions:<br>
for the methyl analogue, the distillations were performed at much higher vacuum (and<br>
therefore at lower temperatures).<br>
