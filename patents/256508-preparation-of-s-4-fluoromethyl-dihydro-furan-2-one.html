				<td>The present invention relates to a process of the preparation of the novel intermediate (S)-4-fluoromethyl-dihydro-furan-2-one of the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>

WO 2005/000848.<br>
A major task in the synthesis of the compounds of formula II is the introduction of the chiral (S)-4-fluoromethyl-pyrrolidino residue which in the current synthesis according to the PCT Int. Appl. WO 2005/000848 involves coupling of a suitably protected tricyclic amine moiety with a racemic side chain building block (i.e with rac-4-chloro-3-fluoromethylbutyryl chloride) and isolation of the desired isomer from the ca. 1:1 isomer mixture by chromatographical separation. Such a chromatographical step is difficult to carry out on large technical scale and furthermore a yield of maximally ca. 50% can be achieved only. The problem to be solved therefore was to find a suitable process alternative which affords a higher yield and which can be conducted on technical scale.<br>

In the rhodium complex catalysts referred to above, rhodium is characterised by the oxidation number I. Such rhodium complexes can optionally comprise further ligands, either neutral or anionic.<br>
Examples of such neutral ligands are e.g. olefins, e.g. ethylene, propylene, cyclooctene, 1 ,3-hexadiene, 1 ,5-hexadiene, norbornadiene (nbd = bicyclo-[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene), (Z,Z)-l,5-cyclooctadiene (cod) or other dienes which form readily soluble complexes with rhodium or ruthenium, benzene, hexamethylbenzene, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, p-cymene, or also solvents such as e.g. tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, benzonitrile, acetone, methanol and pyridine.<br>

wherein X is a halide such as Cl", Br" or I", and L is a neutral ligand as defined above. If L is a ligand comprising two double bonds, e.g. 1 ,5-cyclooctadiene, only one such L is present. If L is a ligand comprising only one double bond, e.g. ethylene, two such L are present.<br>
A rhodium complex catalyst can be prepared, for example, by reaction of rhodium precursors such as e.g. di-n4-chloro-bis[n4-(Z,Z)-l,5-cyclo-octadiene]dirhodium(I) ([Rh(cod)Cl]2), di-u-chloro-bis[n4-norbornadiene]-dirhodium(I) ([Rh(nbd)Cl]2), bis[n4-(Z,Z)-l,5-cyclooctadiene]rhodium tetra-fluoroborate ([Rh(cod)2]BF4) or bis[n4-(Z,Z)-cyclooctadiene]rhodium perchlorate ([Rh(cod)2]ClO4) with a chiral diphosphine ligand in a suitable inert organic or aqueous solvent (e.g. according to the method described in Experimental Chemistry,4th edition, Vol. 18, Organometallic complexes, pp. 339-344, Ed. Chemical Society of Japan, 1991,Maruzen).<br>
In the ruthenium complex catalysts referred to above, ruthenium is characterised by the oxidation number II. Such ruthenium complexes can optionally comprise further ligands, either neutral or anionic. Examples of such neutral ligands are e.g. olefins, e.g. ethylene, propylene, cyclooctene, 1,3-hexadiene, norbornadiene, 1,5-cyclooctadiene, benzene, hexamethylbenzene, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, p-cymene, or also solvents such as e.g. tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, benzonitrile, acetone and methanol. Examples of such anionic ligands are CH3COO", CF3COO" or halides.

Suitable ruthenium complexes in question can be represented e.g. by the following formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein Z represents halogen or the group A-COO, A represents lower alkyl, aryl, halogenated lower alkyl or halogenated aryl and D represents a chiral diphosphine ligand.<br>
These complexes can in principle be manufactured in a manner known per se, e.g. according to B. Heiser et al., Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 1991,2, 51 orN. Feiken et al., Organometallics 1997, 16, 537 or J.-P. Genet, Ace. Chem. Res. 2003, 36, 908 and references cited therein.<br>
Conveniently and preferably, ruthenium complexes are manufactured, for example, by reacting a complex of the formula<br>
wherein Z1 represents halogen or a group A'-COO, A1 represents lower alkyl or halogenated lower alkyl, L1 represents a neutral ligand as defined above, m represents the number 1, 2 or 3, p represents the number 1 or 2 and q represents the number 0 or<br>
1,<br>

can be the same or different.<br>
Typically, ruthenium catalysts exemplified within the present invention can be prepared according to the method described by M.P. Fleming et al., US 6,545,165 Bl, for the preparation of chiral ruthenium dicarboxylate diphosphines.<br>
Rhodium or ruthenium complex catalysts as described above can also be prepared in situ, i.e. just before use and without isolation. The solution in which such a catalyst is prepared can already contain the substrate for the enantioselective hydrogenation or the solution can be mixed with the substrate just before the hydrogenation reaction is initiated.<br>
The asymmetric hydrogenation of a compound of formula HI according to the present invention takes place at a hydrogen pressure in a range from 1 bar to 120 bar. Preferably, the asymmetric hydrogenation is carried out at a pressure of 1 bar to 20 bar. Most preferably, a hydrogen pressure of 3 bar to 7 bar is used. The reaction temperature is conveniently chosen in the range of 0 °C to 120 °C. A process, wherein the asymmetric hydrogenation is carried out at a reaction temperature from 20 °C to 70 °C, is preferred. This reaction can be effected in an inert organic solvent such as dichloromethane, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol, benzotrifluoride (Ph-CF3), tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate or toluene, or mixtures of such solvents. Preferably, the rhodium catalyzed hydrogenation is carried out in dichloromethane or benzotrifluoride and the ruthenium catalyzed hydrogenation is carried out in a solvent taken from the group consisting of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol and dichloromethane, or mixtures of these solvents. More preferably, the ruthenium catalyzed hydrogenation is carried out in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol or methanol.<br>
A further embodiment of the present invention is the product of the asymmetric hydrogenation, i.e. the (S)-4-fluoromethyl-dihydro-furan-2-one of the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
and the (S)-4-fluoromethyl-dihydro-furan-2-one as component of an enantiomeric mixture of (S) and (R)-4-fluoromethyl-dihydro-furan-2-one having an enantiomeric ratio of the (S)- to (R)-isomer of at least 70 : 30, more preferably of at least 90: 10.<br>
The invention further relates to the educt of the asymmetric hydrogenation, which is the 4-fluoromethyl-5H-furan-2-one of the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
The preparation of the 4-fluoromethyl-5H-furan-2-one can be performed according to schemes 1 or 2 below.<br>
Scheme 1<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Dihydroxyacetone (1) is in a first step diacetylated to form the 3-acetoxy-2-oxo-propylester (2) which by a Wittig-reaction with carbethoxymethylene triphenyl phosphorane is converted to the 4-acetoxy-3-acetoxymethyl-but-2-enoic acid ethyl ester (3). Cyclization in the presence of hydrochloric acid provides the 4-hydroxymethyl-5H-furan-2-one (4). Alternatively, 4-hydroxymethyl-5H-furan-2-one (4) can be obtained by direct reaction of dihydroxyacetone (1) with the Wittig reagent carbethoxymethylene triphenylphosphorane. Conversion of 4-hydroxymethyl-5H-furan-2-one (4) into the desired 4-fluoromethyl-5H-furan-2-one of the formula III can be performed by reaction with a suitable deoxyfluorination reagent such as bis-(2-methoxyethyl)aminosulfur trifluoride or perfluorobutanesulfonyl fluoride in the presence of a trialkylamine base such as diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA). The reaction with perfluorobutanesulfonyl fluoride is advantageously performed in the<br><br>
presence  of a  rrialkylamine  tris(hydrofluoride)   such  as  diisopropylethylamine (trishydrofiuoride).<br>
Starting from 2-tert-butoxymethyl-oxirane (5), 4-fluoromethyl-5H-furan-2-one can be prepared according to the method described in scheme 2. In the first step, the oxirane ring is opened with potassium hydrogendifluoride to form l-tert-butoxy-3-fluoro-propan-2-ol (6) which is then oxidized to the corresponding ketone (7). The oxidation can be carried out according to known methods such as e.g. with sodium hypochlorite in the presence of a catalyst such as 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-l-piperidinyloxy radical (TEMPO). In a next step l-tert-butoxy-3-fluoro-propan-2-one (7) is reacted with tert-butyl acetate in the presence of a strong base such as lithium diisopropylamine (LDA) to form 3-tert-butoxymethyl-4-fluoro-3-hydroxybutyric acid tert-butyl ester (8) which can be cyclizised to 4-fluoromethyl-4-hydroxy-dihydro-furan-2-one (9) under strong acidic conditions (e.g. by employing trifluoroacetic acid or sulfuric acid 95%). Preferably, the cyclization is carried out with only a small amount of sulfuric acid 95% (e.g. 0.025 mol equivalent in relation to the educt) in a solvent such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane or dioxane. These two last steps can alternatively be carried out in a one-pot procedure, e.g. without isolating 3-tert-butoxymethyl-4-fluoro-3-hydroxybutyric acid tert-butyl ester (8). In a final step 4-fluoromethyl-5H-furan-2-one (III) is obtained by dehydration of 4-fluoromethyl-4-hydroxy-dihydro-furan-2-one (9). The dehydration can be performed according to known methods, e.g with acetic anhydride in the presence of an amine base such as triethylamine. Alternative dehydration methods include the use of thionyl chloride in the presence of pyridine or mesyl chloride in the presence of triethylamine| In a further alternative dehydration method, 4-fluoromethyl-4-hydroxy-dihydro-furan-2-one (9) is reacted with acetic anhydride to form the intermediate 4-acetoxy-fluoromethyl-dihydro-furan-2-one which is then reacted with sodium acetate in de-ionized water to obtain the compound of formula III. <br><br><br><br>

and of pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
Preferably, the invention relates to the use of the 4-fluoromethyl-5H-furan-2-one of the formula III for the preparation of (S)-l-((2S,3S,llbS)-2-amino-9,10-dimethoxy-1,3,4,6,7,11 b-hexahydro-2H-pyrido[2,l-a]isoquinolin-3-yl)-4-fluoromethyl-pyrrolidin-2-one.<br>

The (S)-4-fluoromethyl-dihydro-furan-2-one can be ring opened in the presence of zinc chloride and thionyl chloride to provide the respective (R)-4-chloro-3-fluoromethyl-butyryl chloride (XII). The acid chloride can then be coupled with the amino-pyrido [2,1-a] isoquinoline derivative (XIII) to form the fluoromethyl-pyrrolidin-2-one derivative of the pyrido [2,1-a] isoquinoline (XIV) which after deprotection yields the desired pyrido [2,1 -a] isoquinoline derivative (II) (Scheme 3).<br>
