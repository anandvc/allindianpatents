ENHANCEMENT OF AIR BLEACHING CATALYSTS<br>
Hindustan Lever Limited, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai - 400 020, Maharashtra, India.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
GRANTED<br>

ORIGINAL<br>
650/MUMNP/2003<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the enhancement of air bleaching<br>
catalysts in laundry.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
The use of bleaching catalysts for stain removal has been developed over recent years.  The recent discovery that some catalysts are capable of bleaching effectively in the absence of an added peroxyl source has recently become the focus of some interest, for example-. WO9965905; WO0012667; WO0012808; WO0029537, and, WO0060045.<br>
Ways of enhancing the activity or improving the stain bleaching profile of these catalysts are desired.<br>
SUMARY OF INVENTION<br>
We have found that the presence of an organic substance having an allylic hydrogen enhances the effectiveness of an air bleaching catalyst in use. The organic substance is provided in a bleaching composition as either an ionic unsaturated surfactant and/or unsaturated non-ionic surfactant.<br>
The present invention provides a bleaching composition comprising an organic substance which forms a complex with a transition metal for bleaching a substrate with atmospheric oxygen, the bleaching composition upon addition to an aqueous medium providing an aqueous bleaching medium substantially devoid of a peroxygen bleach or a peroxy-based<br><br><br>
or peroxyl-generating bleach system, said composition comprising a surfactant having an allylic hydrogen and an HLB of greater than 2.<br>
The surfactant having an allylic hydrogen has an HLB (hydrophilic/lipophilic balance) greater that 2, more preferably greater than 5, and most preferably greater than 10.  For a discussion of HLB the reader is directed to and article by Griffin, W. C. in J. Soc. Cosmetic Chemists Vol. 1 page 311, 1945 and Davies, J. T. and Rideal, E. K. in Interfacial Phenomena, Acad. Press, NY, 1961, pages 371 to 382.  The HLB value requirement reflects the importance of the rate of solubility and dispersibility of the surfactant having an allylic hydrogen from the bleaching composition to the aqueous wash medium in conjunction with surface activity towards the substrate being washed.  The threshold value of HLB as required excludes compounds that have an allylic which do not have the required surfactant properties, for example linoleaic or oleic acid have an HLB of 0.8.<br>
It is preferred that the surfactant having an allylic hydrogen has a CMC of 2 x 10-2 M or less. It is most preferred that the surfactant is anionic has a critical micelle concentration value of 3 x 10-3 M or less. Generally, a surfactant will form a micelle when present in an aqueous solution above a specific concentration that is intrinsic to the surfactant.  A micelle is a neutral or electrically charged colloidal particle, consisting of oriented molecules.  Above what is known as the critica1 micelle concentration  CMC amphiphilic compounds tend to adopt specific aggregates in aqueous solution.  The tendency is to<br><br><br>
avoid contact between their hydrophobic alkyl chains and the aqueous environment and to form an internal hydrophobic phase. Such compounds can form rnonomolecular layers [monolayers] at the air-water boundary and bimolecular layers [bilayers] between two aqueous compartments. Micelles are spherically closed monolayers.<br>
The property required is that the surfactant used in the present invention is and forms a micelle at a concentration of 2 x 10-2 M and below in an aqueous solution at a temperature of 25Â°C.  One skilled in the art will be aware that the standard CMC is measured in deionized water and that the presence of other components in solution, e.g. surfactants or ions in solution will perturb the CMC value. The CMC value and requirement thereof as described herein are measured under standard conditions (N. M. Van Os, J. R. Haak, and L. A. M Rupert, Pysico Chemical Properties of Selected Anionic Cationic and Nonionic Surfactants Elsevier 1993; Kresheck, G. C. Surfactants-In water a comparative treatise- (ed. F. Pranks) Chapter 2 pp 95-197 Plenum Press 1971, New York; and, Mukerjee..P. and.Mysels. K. J. Critical Micelle Concentrations of Aqueous Surfactant Systems, NSRDS-NBS 36, National Bureau of Standards. US Gov. Print office-1971, Washington, DC).<br>
The term "substantially devoid of a peroxygen bleach or a peroxy-based or peroxyl-generating bleach system" should be construed within spirit of the invention.  It is preferred that the composition has as low a content of peroxyl species present as possible.  Nevertheless, autoxidation is something the is very difficult to avoid and as a result<br><br><br>
small levels of peroxyl species may be present.  These small levels may be as high as 2%. The additionally added organic compounds having labile CH's are particularly susceptible to autoxidation and hence may contribute more to this level of peroxyl snecies than other components.  However the presence of an antioxidant in the composition will serve to reduce the presence of adventitious peroxyl species. The composition of the present invention bleaches a substrate with at least 10 %, preferably at least 50 % and optimally at least 90 % of any bleaching of the substrate being effected by oxygen sourced from the air.<br>
The present invention extends to a method of bleaching a substrate comprising applying to the substrate, in an aqueous medium, the bleaching composition according to the present invention.<br>
The present invention extends to a commercial package comprising the bleaching composition according to the present invention together with instructions for its use.<br>
The bleaching composition may be contacted to the textile fabric in any suitable manner.  For example, it may be applied in dry form, such as in powder form, or in a liquor that is then dried, for example as an aqueous spray-on fabric treatment fluid or a wash liquor for laundry cleaning, or a non-aqueous dry cleaning fluid or spray-on aerosol fluid.<br><br><br>
Any suitable textile that is susceptible to bleaching or one that one might wish to subject to bleaching may be used. Preferably the textile is a laundry fabric or garment.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the method according to the present invention is carried out on a laundry fabric using an aqueous treatment liquor.  In particular, the treatment may' be effected in a wash cycle for cleaning laundry.  More preferably, the treatment is carried out in an aqueous detergent bleach wash liquid.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the treated textile is dried, by allowing it to dry under ambient temperature or at elevated temperatures. The elevated temperatures are commonly provided by a heated agitated environment, as for example found in a tumble dryer, which has been found to accelerate and enhance the air bleaching effect.  The effect of ironing the treated textile also serves to accelerate bleaching.<br>
The bleaching method may be carried out by simply leaving the substrate in contact with the bleaching composition for a sufficient period of time.  Preferably, however, the bleaching composition is in an aqueous medium, and the aqueous medium on or containing the substrate is agitated.<br>
The bleaching composition may be contacted with the textile fabric in any conventional manner. For example it may be applied in dry form, such as in powder form, or in a liquor that is then dried, for example in an aqueous spray-on fabric treatment fluid or a wash liquor for laundry<br><br><br>
cleaning, or a non aqueous dry cleaning fluid or spray-on aerosol fluid.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment the method according to the present invention is carried out on a laundry fabric using aqueous treatment liquor. In particular the treatment may be effected in, or as an adjunct to, an essentially conventional wash cycle for cleaning laundry. More preferably, the treatment is carried out in an aqueous detergent wash liquor. The bleaching composition can be delivered into the wash liquor from a powder, granule, pellet, tablet, block, bar or other such solid form. The solid form can comprise a carrier, which can be particulate, sheet-like or comprise a three-dimensional object. The carrier can be dispersible or soluble in the wash liquor or may remain substantially intact. In other embodiments, the bleaching composition can be delivered into the wash liquor from a paste, gel or liquid concentrate.<br>
A unit dose as used herein is a particular amount of the bleaching, composition used. for. a type, of wash.  The unit dose may be in the form of a defined volume of powder, granules or tablet.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>

X is selected from C=0, -[C(R6)2]y- wherein Y is from 0 to 3 each R6 is independently selected from hydrogen, hydroxyl, Cl-C4-alkoxy and Cl-C4-alkyl.<br>
It is preferred that the group containing the hetroatom is: a heterocycloalkyl: selected from the group consisting of: pyrrolinyl; pyrrolidinyl; morpholinyl; piperidinyl; piperazinyl; hexamethylene imine; 1,4-piperazinyl; tetrahydrothiophenyl; tetrahydrofuranyl; tetrahydropyranvl; and oxazolidinyl, wherein the heterocycloalkyl may be connected to the ligand via any atom in the ring of the selected heterocycloalkyl,<br>

It is preferred that the organic molecule (ligand) or transition metal complex is present in the composition such that a unit dose provides at least 0.1  of the organic molecule or transition metal complex thereof.<br>
Surfactant Having an Allylic Hydrogen<br>
To benefit from the enhancement of bleaching activity it is preferred that the surfactant having an allylic hydrogen is present in the composition such that a unit dose provides at least 0.01 g/1, more preferably at least 0.5g /l, and most preferably at least O.lg /l, concentration of the unsaturated organic compound in a wash.  The surfactant having an allylic hydrogen may be present in the composition in the range of 0.01 to 60%, preferably 0.1 to 20% and most preferably. 1.0.% w/w.<br>
There are many classes of surfactants having an allylic hydrogen that will work with the present invention to enhance air bleaching. As one skilled in the art is aware a surfactant having an allylic hydrogen (enhancer) may be found in: neutral species, and charged species, i.e., cationic species, anionic species, and zwitterionic species. It is preferred that the surfactant having an allylic hydrogen contains a hydrophilic group thereby providing the organic compound unassociated or as a micelle in an aqueous<br><br><br>
medium. It also is pre "erred that the surfactant having an allylic hydrogen is provided in the form of an alkali metal salt, preferably sodium, of an unsaturated carboxylic acid.<br>
One skilled in the art will appreciate that benzene and toluene are considered unsaturated but neither possess allylic hydrogens per se. The homolytic bond dissociation energy (BDE) for benzene (C6H5-H) is 110.9 kcal/mol (298 K) makes benzene moieties per se unsuitable to promote enhanced bleaching.  The surfactant used to enhance bleaching according to the present invention has a hydrogen atom covalently bound to an alpha-carbon that is alpha to a Sp2-Sp2 hybridized bond (other than Sp2-Sp2 hybridized bonds found in a cyclic aromatic system) e.g., as shown as underlined in the following formula CH2=CH-CH2-CH3. It is most preferred that the surfactant having an allylic hydrogen has a molecular weight of at least 80 and a bond dissociation energy of less than 95 kcal/mol, most preferably below 90 kcal/mol, and even more preferably below 85 kcal/mol.  Below is a table of bond strengths (298 K) obtained from: The handbook of Chemistry and Physics 73rd edition, CRC Press.<br><br><br><br>
1)  Unsaturated Soap (Unsaturated Anionic Surfactant) The unsaturated fatty acid soap used preferably contains from about 16 to about 22  carbon atoms, preferably in a straight chain configuration. Preferably the number of carbon atoms in the unsaturated fatty acid soap is from about 16 to about 18.<br>
This unsaturated soap, in common with other anionic detergents and other anionic materials in the detergent compositions of this invention, has a cation, which renders the soap water-soluble and/or dispersible. Suitable cations<br><br>
include sodium, potassium, ammonium, monethanolammonium, diethanolammonium, triethanolammonium, tetramethylammonium, etc. cations. Sodium ions are preferred although in liquid formulations potassium, monoethanolammonium,<br><br>
diethanolanraiorLinro, and...triethanolammonium cations are useful.<br>
The unsaturated soaps are made from natural oils that often contain one or more unsaturated groups and consist of mixtures of components. It is clear that hydrolysation of these natural components yield mixtures of soaps, of which at least one of the components contain one or more unsaturated groups. Examples of natural oils are sunflower oil, olive oil, cottonseed oil, linseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, palm oil, corn oil, peanut oil, soybean oil, castor oil, coconut oil, canola oil, cod liver oil and the like, that give mixtures of soaps of which at least one of them has at least one unsaturated group, However, also hydrolysis products of purified oils, as listed above, may be employed. Other examples of soaps include thoses derived from erucic acid,<br>
2) Unsaturated Surfactant (Unsaturated Cationic) As one skilled in the art will appreciate such an unsaturated cationic may be manufactured, for example, by adding an unsaturated alkyl halide to an amine thus forming an unsaturated cationic.<br>
In principle the cationic surfactants exhibit the same requirements as listed above for the unsaturated soap materials, except they need to be quarternised. Without limiting the scope of the invention, suitable cationics may be formed by preparing the quaternary salts frcv alcohols that were obtaired from the corresponding fatty acid (as defined under 1; from oils containing unsaturated bonds) .<br><br><br>
Examples of cationic surfactants based on natural oils include oleylbis(2-hydroxyethyl)methylammonium chloride and ditallow fatty alkyldimethyl ammonium chloride.<br>
3) Unsaturated Neutral Surfactant<br>
An example of a non-ionic (neutral) surfactant is found in alkoxylated non-ionic surfactants.  In common with the ionic surfactants as described above the surfactant has an allylic hydrogen.<br>
The Detergent Composition.<br>
The Bleaching composition of the present invention may comprise other surfactants and optionally other conventional detergent ingredients.<br>
In general, the nonionic and anionic surfactants of the surfactant system may be chosen from the surfactants described "Surface Active Agents" Vol. 1, by Schwartz &amp; Perry, Interscience 1949, Vol. 2 by Schwartz, Perry &amp; Berch, Interscience 1958, in the current edition of "McCutcheon's Emulsifiers and Detergents" published by Manufacturing Confectioners Company or in "Tenside-Taschenbuch", H. Stache, 2nd Edn., Carl Hauser Verlag, 1981.<br>
Suitable nonionic detergent compounds which may be used include, in particular, the reaction products of compounds having a hydrophobic group and a reactive hydrogen atom, fox example, aliphatic alcohols, acids, amides or alkyl phenols with alkylene oxides, especially ethylene oxide either alone or with propylene oxide.

Suitable anionic detergent compounds which may be used are usually water-soluble alkali metal salts of organic sulphates and sulphonates having alkyl radicals containing from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms, the term alkyl being used to include the alkyl portion of higher acyl radicals. Examples of suitable synthetic anionic detergent compounds are sodium and potassium alkyl sulphates, especially those obtained by sulphating higher C8-C18lcohols, produced for example from tallower onut oil, sodium and potassium alkyl C9-C20 benzene sulphonates, particularly sodium linear secondary alkyl C10-C15enzene sulphonates; and sodium alkyl glyceryl ether sulphates, especially those ethers, of the higher alcohols derived from tallow or coconut oil and synthetic alcohols derived from petroleum. The preferred anionic detergent compounds are sodium C11c15alkyl benzene sulphonates, and sodium C12-C18, alkyl.. sulphates. Also, applicable are surfactants such as those described in EP-A-328 177 (Unilever), which show resistance to salting-out, the alkyl POlyglycoside surfactants described in EP-A-070 074, and alkyl monoglycosides.<br>
Preferred surfactant systems are mixtures of anionic with nonionic detergent active materials, in particular the groups and examples of anionic and nonionic surfactants pointed out in EP-A-346 995 (Unilever). Especially preferred is surfactant system that is a mixture of an alkali metal<br><br><br>
salt of a C16-C18 primary alcohol sulphate together with a C12-C15 primary alcohol 3-7 EO ethoxylate.<br>
The nonionic detergent is preferably present in amounts greater than 10%, e.g. 25-90% by weight of the surfactant system. Anionic surfactants can be present for example in amounts in the range from about 5% to about 40% by weight of the surfactant system.<br>

The activity of oxidoeductases, in particular the phenol oxidising enzyrfies in a process for bleaching stains on fabrics and/or dyes in solution and/or antimicrobial treatment can be enhanced by adding certain organic, compounds, called enhancers. Examples of enhancers are 2,2'-azo-bis-(3-ethylbenzo-thiazoline-6-sulphonate (ABTS) and Phenothiazine-10-propionate (PTP). More enhancers are described in WO-A-94/12619, WO-A-94/12620, WO-A-94/12621, WO-A-97/11217, WO-A-99/23887. Enhancers are generally added at a level of 0.01% to 5% by weight of detergent composition.<br>
Builders, polymers and other enzymes as optional ingredients may also be present as found in WO0060045.<br><br><br>
Suitable detergency builders as optional ingredients may also be present as found in WO0034427.<br>
The composition of the present invention may be used for laundry cleaning, nara surface cleaning (including cleaning of lavatories, kitchen work surfaces, floors, mechanical ware washing etc.). As is generally known in the art, bleaching compositions are also employed in waste-water treatment, pulp bleaching during the manufacture of paper, leather manufacture, dye transfer inhibition, food processing, starch bleaching, sterilisation, whitening in oral hygiene preparations and/or contact lens disinfection.<br>
In the context of the present invention, bleaching should be understood as relating generally to the decolourisation of stains or of other materials attached to or associated with a substrate.  However, it is envisaged that the present invention can be applied where a requirement is the removal and/or neutralisation by an oxidative bleaching reaction of malodours or other undesirable components attached to or otherwise associated with a substrate.  Furthermore, in the context of the present invention bleaching is to be understood as being restricted to any bleaching mechanism or process that does not require the presence of light or activation by light.<br>
The invention will now be further illustrated by way of the following non-limiting examples-.<br><br><br>

Example 2.<br>
The results below are non-limiting and just intended- for illustration of the invention. The results below illustrate the bleaching performance on a wide variety of stains in combination with a transition-metal catalyst and a soap derived from an unsaturated oil or an unsaturated oil. The stain does not need to contain unsaturated groups, as found<br><br>
usually in the tomato-oil or curry oil stains (that are bleached by the metal complexes in the air).<br>
Results of bleaching of various stains by air using a<br>
formulation containing an unsaturated soap and<br>
[Fe(MeN4py)Cl]Cl in the absence of a peroxy compound.<br><br>
In an aqueous solution containing 10 mM carbonate buffer (pH 10) with 0.6 g/1 or 6 g/1 sodium-linoleate and the catalyst (10 or 100 Î²M), BC-1 (tea stain) cloths,(blackcurrant fruit stain) cloths, or grass stains or tomato/saturated oil (medium-chain C8-saturated triglyceride) were added and kept in contact with the solution under agitation for 30 minutes at 3 0 Â°C.  In comparitive experiments, either only the soap was added (no catalyst) or the catalyst only was added (no soap). After the wash, the cloths were rinsed with water and subsequently dried at 30 Â°C and the change in colour was measured immediately after drying with a Linotype-Hell scanner (ex Linotype) (t=0 in the table) . The tomato stains were left for 24 h and 48 h in the dark and measured again (t=l and t=2 in the tables). The change in colour (including bleaching) is expressed as the AE value versus white; a lower AE value means a cleaner cloth. The measured colour difference (AE) between the washed cloth and the unwashed cloth is defined as follows:<br><br><br>
wherein AL is a measure for the difference in darkness between the washed and unwashed test cloth; Aa and Ab are measures for the difference in redness and yellowness respectively between both cloths. With regard to this colour measurement technique, reference is made to Commission International de l'Eclairage (CIE); Recommendation on Uniform Colour Spaces, colour difference equations, psychometric colour terms, supplement no 2 to CIE Publication, no 15, Colormetry, Bureau Central de la CIE, Paris 1978. The results are shown below in the tables.<br>
Bleach Results<br>
Table 1 shows BC-1 stain (tea stain) bleaching results.<br><br>
The results in the Table 1 above show a bleach benefit by combining a soap containing an unsaturated bond with the catalyst using air.<br>
Table 2 shows CS-12 stain (blackcurrant fruit stain) bleaching results.<br><br><br><br>
The results in the Table 2 above show a bleach benefit by combining a soap containing an unsaturated bond with the catalyst using air.<br>
Table 3 shows grass stain bleaching results.<br><br>
The results in the Table 3 above show a bleach benefit by combining a soap containing an unsaturated bond with the catalyst using air.<br><br><br>
Table 4 shows tomato saturated oil stain bleaching results.<br><br>
The results in Table 4 above show a bleach benefit by combining a soap containing an unsaturated bond with the catalyst using air.  This bleaching effect continues during storage in the dark.<br>
Another series of catalysts were tested on another saturated oil tomato stain batch (having a different intensity) using Na-linoleate (Na-linoleate has an HLB of 17.8 and a CMC of 1.8 x 10-3 M at 20 Â°C) and Na-oleate (Na-oleate has an HLB of 17.8 and CMC of 7.3 x 10-4 M at 20 Â°C) as  enhancing molecules . All experiments were done in the presence of 0.6 g/L NaLAS. Only values are given in the table when based on statistic analysis (2 times standard deviation of buffer/LAS only).<br><br><br>
Results are given in table 5.<br><br>
Overall these results show that a combination of the catalysts with the sodium linoleate soap yields a wide stain removal profile without any added peroxy bleach species.<br><br><br>
