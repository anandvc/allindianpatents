				<td>Introduction apparatus<br>
field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for introducing a medical<br>
device into a catheter. It further relates to an apparatus for introducing medical<br>
devices that are flexible or have geometries that don't facilitate introduction.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Catheters and other similar medical devices are typically introduced into<br>
vessels by pushing the distal end of the device forward using the catheter shaft as<br>
support. The medical devices that are introduced in this manner may include<br>
intravascular devices, expanded nitinol meshes, balloon catheters, or similar<br>
devices that require exterior support to allow for advance of the device. Further,<br>
the devices include those where loading an element from the distal end is<br>
preferred as not to damage the primary catheter tip or intravascular portion.<br>
Often the introduction and advancement of such a device into a vessel is<br>
difficult because the device is either too flexible or has a geometry that doesn't<br>
facilitate introduction. Further, loading such a device may damage the primary<br>
tip or, in the case of an intravascular device, the intravascular portion.<br>
There is a need in the art for an apparatus that allows for the introduction<br>
and advancement of catheters and other medical devices into vessels. There is a<br>
further need for an apparatus that allows for the protection of the primary tip or<br>
any distal portions of the device.<br>

low-friction material.<br>
FIG. 4 depicts a method of using an introduction apparatus 100 according<br>
to one embodiment of the present invention. In operation, the proximal end of a<br>
device is inserted into the distal end of the tubular member 12 (block 102). Once<br>
the device has been pulled through the tubular member 12 such that the distal end<br>
of the device is enclosed within the tubular member 12 (block 104), the tubular<br>
member 12 is inserted into a catheter (block 106). Upon insertion, the first<br>
connection element 14 removably attaches to the catheter (block 108). At this<br>
point, the device is pushed through the introduction apparatus 10 and into the<br>
catheter to which the apparatus 10 is attached (block 110).<br>
FIG. 5 depicts an introduction apparatus 50 according to an alternative<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The apparatus 50 has an elongated tubular<br>
member 52 and a first connection element 54 and a second connection element<br>
56. The apparatus also has an additional tubular arm 58 associated with the<br>
tubular member. According to one embodiment, the tubular arm 58 is configured<br>
to accept a device for insertion into a catheter while the apparatus 50 is already<br>
attached to the catheter. In a further embodiment, the introduction apparatus 50<br>
has an elongated tubular member 52, a tubular arm 58, and a second connection<br>
element 56 and is permanently attached at the distal end of the tubular member<br>
52 to the catheter.<br>
FIG. 6 depicts a method of using an introduction apparatus (50) 150 with<br>
a tubular arm 58 according to one embodiment of the present invention where the<br>
apparatus 50 is already attached to the catheter. In operation, the proximal end of<br>
a device is inserted into the open end of the tubular arm 58 (block 152). Once the<br>
device has been pulled through the tubular arm 58 and into the tubular member<br>
52 such that the distal end of the device is enclosed within the tubular member 12<br>
(block 154), the device is pushed through the introduction apparatus 10 and into<br>
the catheter to which the apparatus 10 is attached (block 156).<br>
The tubular member 12 according to one embodiment is made by a<br>
known extrusion process. FIG. 7A depicts a portion of a tubular member 12<br>
made by a process that results in a configuration that allows adherence of external<br>
elements, according to an alternative embodiment of the present invention. That<br>
is, a grooving process, which is also known as a "roughing" process, is used to<br>
create grooves 13 in the tubular member 12 which are configured to allow for the<br>
attachment of external elements, such as the first connection element 14 or the<br>
second connection element 16.<br>
FIG. 7B depicts a grooving process 200 used to make grooves in the<br>
tubular member 12, according to one embodiment of the present invention. The<br>
tubular member 12 is placed into a fixture (block 202). Upon placement in the<br>
fixture, an element of the fixture is placed over the tubular member 12 such that<br>
grinding wheels contact the tubular member 12 at desired locations (block 204).<br>
Next, the tubular member is turned (block 206), thus causing grooves to be cut<br>
into the tubular member (block 208).<br>
FIG. 8 depicts a method of adding external elements to the tubular<br>
member (12) 250, according to one embodiment of the invention. For example,<br>
the first connection element 14 and the second connection element 16 can be<br>
added by this process. The tubular member 12, having grooves at appropriate<br>
locations, is placed into a mold (block 252). Then an appropriate material is<br>
molded onto the tubular member 12 at the grooves (block 254).<br>
In a further alternative, if the apparatus 10 was created using a co-<br>
extrusion process, the tubular member 12 may not need grooving if the outer<br>
layer 20 is configured to allow adherence of external elements.<br>
While multiple embodiments are disclosed, still other embodiments of the<br>
present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the<br>
following detailed description, which shows and describes illustrative<br>
