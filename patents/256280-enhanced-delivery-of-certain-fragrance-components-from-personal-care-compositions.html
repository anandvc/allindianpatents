(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
ENCHANCED DELIVERY OF CERTAIN FRAGARNCE COMPONENTS FROM<br>
PERSONAL CARE COMPOSITIONS<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under<br>
the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office<br>
at 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
ENHANCED DELIVERY OF CERTAIN FRAGRANCE COMPONENTS FROM PERSONAL CARE<br>
COMPOSITIONS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention concerns personal care compositions which upon application to a human body surface<br>
quickly release certain fragrance components thereby improving aesthetics of these compositions.<br>
Perhaps the most significant aesthetic of a personal care product for a consumer is fragrance. It is also important to rapidly deliver the scent.<br>
Many techniques have been reported to manipulate timing and impact of fragrance. Delayed generation has been achieved through encapsulation of scent ingredients. For instance, U.S. Patent 5,135,747 (Faryniarz et al.) reports an unscented malodor counteractant deo perfume mixture encapsulated within a semi-permeable wall material and a quicker releasable non-encapsulated fragrance perfume mixture in a cosmetically acceptable vehicle. Slow release has also been achieved through pro-accords. These chemicals slowly break down releasing an odoriferous component as a degradation fragment. Menthol is the rnost frequent commercially delivered degradation constituent of pro-accords contained in personal cars compositions. Illustrative of this technology is U.S. Patent 6,100233 (Sivik et al.) employing a Î²-ketoester pro-accord which transforms to chemically release fragranced alcohols such as linalool, dihydromyrcenol and other alcohols.<br>
Steady release technologies have also been reported. Most prominent are a series of disclosures on enduring perfumes. See U.S. Patent 5,833,999; U.S. Patent 5,849,310 and U.S. Patent 6,086,903 all to Trinh et al. describing personal treatment compositions delivering an enduring perfume that provides a lasting olifactory sensation.<br>
Although technologies are known for delayed release and prolonged perfume generation, none has solved the problem of rapidly releasing a. fragrance onto human skin or hair.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A personal care composition is provided which includes:<br>
(i) from 0.000001 to 2% of a fragrance component selected from the group consisting of limonene, gamma terpinene, ethylene brassylate and mixtures thereof;<br>
(ii) from 0.05% to 30% by weight of a dihydroxypropylquaternary ammonium salt of structure AB, wherein A is a cationic charged component of the salt AB, B is an anionic charged component of the salt AB, and A has a single quaternized nitrogen atom, at least two hydroxy groups and a molecular weight no higher than 250; and<br>
(iii)      a cosmetically acceptable canier.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Now it has been found that fragrance components limonene, gamma terpinene and ethylene brassylate can have their volatility enhanced from a personal care composition through use of a scent boosting agent. This agent has been found to be dihydroxypropyl quaternary ammonium salts.<br>
By the term personal care composition is meant any product applied to a human body for improving appearance, cleansing, odor control or general aesthetics. Non-limiting examples of personal care compositions include leave-on skin lotions and creams, shampoos, conditioners, shower gels, toilet bars, antiperspirants, deodorants, dental products, shave creams, depilatories, lipsticks, foundations, mascara, sunless tanners and sunscreen lotions.<br>
An important material of the present invention is dihydroxypropyl quaternary ammonium salts of structure AB, wherein A is a cationic charged component of the salt AB, and B is an anionic charged component of the salt AB, A has one quatemized nitrogen atom, at least two hydroxyl groups and a molecular weight no higher than 250 but preferably no higher than 200, and optimally no higher than 170.<br>
Anionic charged component B may be organic or inorganic with proviso that the material is cosmetically acceptable. Typical inorganic anions are halides, sulfates, phosphates, nitrates and borates. Most preferred are the halides, especially chloride. Organic anionic counter ions include methosulfate, toluoyl sulfate, acetate, citrate, tartrate, lactate, gluconate, and benzenesulfonate. The number and charge of negatively charged component B will be sufficient to neutralize the positive charge of component A.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the quaternary ammonium salts is the dihydroxypropyl tri(C1-C3 alkyl or hydroxyalkyl) ammonium salts.<br>
These salts may be obtained in a variety of synthetic procedures, most particularly by hydrolysis of chlorohydroxypropyltri(C1-C3 alkyl or hydroxyalkyl) ammonium salts. Ordinarily the C1-C3 alkyl or hydroxyalkyl constituent on the quatemized ammonium group will be methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, hydroxyethyl, hydroxymethyl and mixtures thereof. Particularly preferred is a trimethyl ammonium group known through INCI nomenclature as a "trimonium" group. A most preferred species is 1,2-dihydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, wherein the C1-C3 alkyl is a methyl group.<br><br>
Amounts of the quaternary ammonium salts may range from 0.05 to 30%, preferably from 0.1 to 25%, more preferably from 5 to 20%, optimally from 10 to 15% by weight of the personal care composition.<br>
The fragrance components susceptible of a boost according to the present invention are limonene, gamma terpinene, ethylene brassylate and combinations thereof. Ethylene brassylate is particularly useful as a scent for masking malodor in compositions having essentially no other fragrance component mixtures. Amounts of each of these components may each range from 0.000001 to 2%, preferably from 0.00001 to 1%, more preferably from 0.0001 to 0.5%, and optimally from 0.001 to 0.1% by weight of the personal care composition.<br>
Compositions of this invention will also include a cosmetically acceptable carrier. Amounts of the carrier may range from 1 to 99.9%, preferably from 70 to 95%, optimally from 80 to 90% by weight of the personal care composition. Among the useful carriers are water, emollients, fatty acids, fatty alcohols, humectants, thickeners and combinations thereof. The carrier may be aqueous, anhydrous or an emulsion. Preferably the compositions are aqueous, especially water and oil emulsions of the W/O or O/W or triplex W/O/W variety. Water when present may be in amounts ranging from 5 to 95%, preferably from 20 to 70%, optimally from 35 to 60% by weight of the personal care composition.<br>
Emollient materials may serve as cosmetically acceptable carriers. These may be in the form of silicone oils, synthetic esters and hydrocarbons. Amounts of the emollients may range anywhere from 0.1 to 95%, preferably between 1 and 50% by weight of the personal care composition.<br>
Silicone oils may be divided into the volatile and non-volatile variety. The term "volatile" as used herein refers to those materials which have a measurable vapor pressure at ambient temperature. Volatile silicone oils are preferably chosen from cyclic (cyclomethicone) or linear polydimethylsiloxanes containing from 3 to 9, preferably from 4 to 5, silicon atoms.<br>

EXAMPLE 9<br>
A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate release and prolonged scent generation of typical components of a perfume mixture. Samples were prepared at room temperature (23Â° C) by mixing 10% by weight of the sample of scent boosting agent (dihydroxypropyl quaternary ammonium salt) in water along with 0.05% of weight of the sample Deep Moisture perfume oil. This oil is a mixture of components including but not limited to limonene, dihydromyrcenol, benzyl acetate, gamma terpinene, linalool, pinene, isomethyl ionone, and others.<br>
Samples were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) analysis of headspace gases. In this procedure, the equipment utilized was a solid phase microextraction (SPME) system employing an Agilent gas chromatography (GC) 6890 / mass spectrometry (MS) 5973 / flame ionization detector (FID). This equipment measured relative perfume compound abundance in the headspace over the fragrance/boosting agent/water mixture, as well as over the fragrance/water mixture. One gram of fragrance/boosting agent/water mixture was prepared in 20 ml GC headspace sampling vials sealed with caps having septums (from Gerstel, Inc.) and held at room temperature (23Â°C). The GC column<br><br>
was a HP-5MS column from Agilent (inner diameter 0.25 mm, length 30 m, stationary phase thickness 0.25um). The GC conditions were as follows: Injector in splitless mode with helium gas as carrier gas. Injection port was heated to 250Â°C, purge flow to split vent 50ml/min at zero minutes. Column was in constant flow mode with 1.3 ml/min flow rate. Oven temperature ramp: hold at 75Â°C for 2 minutes, then increase oven temperature at a rate of 6Â°C/min to 100Â°C, 1.5Â°C/min to 150Â°C, 3Â°C/,min to 190Â°C, 30Â°C/min to 300Â°C and hold for 2 minutes. MS conditions were: solvent delay for 0.5 minutes, scan starting from low mass 35 to high mass 300. Autosamplers conditions were: No incubation (all experiments done in room temperature). SPME fibre was inserted into the sample headspace for a 5 minute extraction and then injected to the injector for a 15 minute desorption.<br>
In the situation of ethylene brassylate, this material was charged at 0.01 g into a 20 g solution of boosting agent/water. The added ethylene brassylate was above the solubility level of this material in the boosting agent/water solution. In the GC headspace analysis for ethylene brassylate, MS conditions were: solvent delay for 0.5 min., SIM mode (selective ion) for 99 and 98 ions. All other conditions were identical to that noted in the previous paragraph.<br>
Results of the experiments are reported in table IX below.<br>
TABLE IX<br><br>
Fragrance Component	Water	10% GQ<br>
1-Butanol, 3-methyl acetate	1.00	1.09<br>
2-Buten-1-ol, 3-methyl acetate	1.00	1.04<br>
Beta pinene	1.00	1.72<br>
Hexyl acetate	1.00	1.41<br>
Limonene	1.00	2.72<br>
2,6-Dimethyl hept-5-en-1-al	1.00	0.38<br>
Gamma terpinene	1.00	2.15<br>
Dihydromyrcenol	1.00	1.00<br>
2,4 DimethyK3-cyclohexene-1 -carbaldehyde	1.00	1.06<br>
Linalool	1.00	0.97<br>
Benzyl acetate	1.00	0.86<br>
Allyl heptoate	1.00	1.23<br>
2-Tertiobutylcyclohexyl acetate-2	1.00	1.16<br>
Alpha isomethyl ionone	1.00	0.86<br>
Lily aldehyde	1.00	0.97<br>
Ethylene brassylate	1.00	2.64<br><br>
GQ = dihydroxypropyl trimonium chloride<br>
Evident from the results in table IX is that certain fragrance ingredients are particularly boosted into the headspace by the presence of the quaternary ammonium salt. These ingredients are limonene, gamma terpinene and ethylene brassylate.<br><br>
