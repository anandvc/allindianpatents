				<td>METHODS FOR PREPARING POLYMERIC REAGENTS AND COMPOSITIONS OF POLYMERIC REAGENTS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	This invention relates to methods for preparing water soluble and non-<br>
peptidic polymers ("polymeric reagents") as well as to compositions of water-soluble of the same, conjugates, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods of administering pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Scientists and clinicians face a number of challenges in their attempts to<br>
develop active agents into forms suited for delivery to a patient. Active agents that are proteins, for example, are often delivered via injection rather than orally. In this way, the protein is introduced into the systemic circulation without exposure to the proteolytic environment of the stomach.<br>
[0003]	Injection of proteins, however, has several drawbacks. For example,<br>
many proteins have a relatively short half-life, thereby necessitating repeated injections, which are often inconvenient and painful. Moreover, some proteins may elicit one or more immune responses with the consequence that the patient's immune system attempts to destroy or otherwise neutralize the immunogenic protein. Of course, once the protein has been destroyed or otherwise neutralized, the protein cannot exert its intended pharmacodynamic activity. Thus, delivery of active agents such as proteins is often problematic even when these agents are administered by injection.<br>
[0004]	Some success has been achieved in addressing the problems of<br>
delivering active agents via injection. For example, conjugating an active agent to a water-soluble polymer has resulted in a polymer-active agent conjugate having reduced immunogenicity and antigenicity. In addition, the polymer-active agent conjugate often has an increased half-life compared to its unconjugated counterpart as a result of decreased clearance through the kidney and/or decreased enzymatic<br>
degradation in the systemic circulation. As a result of having a greater half-life, the polymer-active agent conjugate requires less frequent dosing, which in turn reduces the overall number of painful injections and inconvenient visits with a health care professional. Moreover, active agents that were only marginally soluble demonstrate a significant increase in water solubility when conjugated to a water-soluble polymer.<br>
[0005]	Due to its documented safety as well as its approval by the FDA for<br>
both topical and internal use, polyethylene glycol has been conjugated to active agents. When an active agent is conjugated to a polymer of polyethylene glycol or "PEG," the conjugated active agent is conventionally referred to as "PEGylated." The commercial success of PEGylated active agents such as PEGASYS® PEGylated interferon alpha-2a (Hoffmann-La Roche, Nutley, NJ), PEG-INTRON® PEGylated interferon alpha-2b (Schering Corp., Kennilworth, NJ), and NEULASTA™ PEG-filgrastim (Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA) demonstrates that administration of a conjugated form of an active agent can have significant advantages over the unconjugated counterpart. Small molecules such as distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (Zalipsky (1993) Bioconjug. Chem. 4(4):296-299) and fluorouracil (Ouchi et al. (1992) Drug Des. Discov.9(l):93-105) have also 'been PEGylntsd. Hams et.al' have provided a review of the effects of PEGylation on pharrnaceuticals. Harris et al. (2003) Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2(3):214-221.<br>
[0006]	Typically, the formation of a conjugate involves reaction between an<br>
active agent and a polymeric reagent. While small scale amounts of polymeric reagents are available from commercial sources such as Nektar Therapeutics, a concern arises when a commercial or production scale of the polymeric reagent is required. In particular, there is a concern that the particular polymeric reagent used in making the desired conjugate (or an intermediate useful in preparing the polymeric reagent used in making the desired conjugate) cannot be synthesized, largely free of potentially harmful impurities, in a timely, efficient, and economical manner.<br>
[0007]	For example, the conventional synthesis of polymers bearing an active<br>
ester - which can be used a polymeric reagent as well as an intermediate useful in preparing other polymeric reagents --requires an excess of a low molecular weight reagent [such as di(l-benzotriazolyl) carbonate], which must be removed. Although<br>
complicated, removal of the low molecular weight reagent is necessary so that the low molecular weight reagent does not react with other molecules, thereby introducing undesired side reactions and products that result in a relatively impure product and decreased yield.<br>
[0008]	In one approach for preparing polymers bearing an active ester, U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,624,246 describes the synthesis of methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) bearing a benzotriazole carbonate group ("mPEG-BTC"). As described therein, the process effectively involves mPEG-BTC formation followed by mPEG-BTC purification to purify the mPEG-BTC species and remove unreacted di(l-benzotriazolyl) carbonate and any other low molecular weight products (e.g., 1-benzotriazolyl alcohol). As described in U.S. Patent No. 6,624,246, the purification of mPEG-BTC involves multiple precipitation steps. A schematic of the process is provided below.<br>

O<br>
c)	add ethyl ether, cool and form a precipitate of   mPEG-O-6-Ov <br>
[0009]	In the manufacture of mPEG-BTC wherein the polyethylene glycol)<br>
portion has a weight-average molecular weight of about 20,000 Daltons, an eight-fold excess of diBTC was used in order to achieve 100% conversion of all mPEG-OH to mPEG-BTC. Although the large amount of diBTC ensures optimal conversion to MPEG-OH to mPEG-BTC, a relatively large amount of diBTC remains unreacted and must be removed prior to carrying out any further synthetic steps. Otherwise, the<br>
remaining diBTC would react with any reactive group (e.g., alcohol group, amine group, and so forth) encountered and introduce undesired impurities and reduce the overall yield.<br>
[0010]	As described in U.S. Patent No. 5,932,462, mPEG-BTC was reacted<br>
with lysine (bearing two amino groups and a single carboxylic acid group), thereby providing a "lysine branched" structure wherein an mPEG residue is attached at each of the amino groups and the carboxylic acid is available for further functionalizing. While it is conceivable to consume any excess diBTC with adding an excess of lysine, such an approach is flawed for at least two reasons. First, both the diBTC and mPEG-BTC will "compete" for the available lysine amino groups, thereby resulting in a mixture of the desired lysine branched structure and another species having only a single mPEG residue, a single BTC group, and a single carboxylic acid. Second, even if this approach was successful, it would not address situations where a non-lysine residue-containing product is desired.<br>
[0011]	One may avoid having excess diBTC during the lysine reaction only by<br>
destroying the excess diBTC from formation of mPEG-BTC during mPEG-BTC purification. Isopropyl alcohol (IPA, isopropanol) may be substituted for ethyl ether to precipitate the mPEG-BTC from a methylene chloride solution [i.e., e.g., step B(c) in the above schematic]. If this change is made, the IPA reacts with the excess diBTC to form isopropyl-BTC, which is soluble in the mixture of methylene chloride and EPA. Unfortunately, in such an operation at large scale, some isopropyl-BTC is trapped in the mPEG-BTC precipitate. Since the isopropyl-BTC would compete with mPEG-BTC in any reaction with lysine, the isopropyl-BTC must be removed before manufacturing can continue. To remove the trapped isopropyl-BTC, one or two additional "re-precipitation" steps must be carried out in order to get mPEG-BTC free of isopropyl-BTC. As each re-precipitation gives some loss of the mPEG-BTC product because only about 85-95% of the solid can be recovered, this approach is costly and requires additional time.<br>
[0012]	In another approach for preparing polymers bearing an active ester,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,281,698 describes the synthesis of methoxy polyethylene glycol) bearing a succinimide carbonate group ("mPEG-SC"). As described therein, the<br>
process effectively involves mPEG-SC formation followed by mPEG-SC purification to purify the mPEG-SC species and remove unreacted disuccinimidyl carbonate and any other low molecular weight products (e.g., N-hydroxysuccinimide). As described in U.S. Patent No. 5,281,698, the purification of mPEG-SC involves filtration and multiple precipitation steps. A schematic of the process is provided below.<br>
A) mPEG-SC Formation<br>

B) mPEG-SC Purification<br>

f) repeate precipitation (step c and d) two more times<br>
[0013]	In the manufacture of mPEG-SC wherein the poly(ethylene glycol)<br>
portion has a weight-average molecular weight of about 6100 Daltons, an twenty-fold excess of DSC was used in order to achieve 100% conversion of all mPEG-OH to mPEG-SC. Although the large amount of DSC ensures optimal conversion to MPEG-OH to mPEG-SC, a relatively large amount of DSC remains unreacted and must be removed prior to carrying out any further synthetic steps. Otherwise, the remaining DSC would react with any reactive group (e.g., alcohol group, amine group, and so forth) encountered and introduce undesired impurities and reduce the overall yield.<br>
[0014]	Thus, there remains a need for an efficient method to remove excess<br>
low molecular weight reagents, such as diBTC and/or its reactive degradants, from the same reaction mixture in which the low molecular weight reagent was added, thereby<br>
resulting in a "one-pot" reaction. This present invention addresses this and other needs in the art.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0024]	Before describing one or more embodiments of the present invention in<br>
detail, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular polymers, reagents, and the like, as such may vary.<br>
[0025]	It must be noted that, as used in this specification and the claims, the<br>
singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to "a polymer" includes a single polymer as well as two or more of the same or different polymers, reference to "an activated carbonate reagent" refers to a single activated carbonate reagent as well as two or more of the same or different activated carbonate reactive agents, and the like.<br>
[0026]	In describing and claiming the present invention(s), the following<br>
terminology will be used in accordance with the definitions provided below.<br>
[0027]	"PEG," "polyethylene glycol" and "polyethylene glycol)" as used<br>
herein, are interchangeable. Typically, PEGs for use in accordance with the invention comprise the following structure: "-(OCH2CH2)n-"where (n) is 2 to 4000. As used herein, PEG also includes "-CH2CH2-O(CH2CH2O)n-CH2CH2 and "-(OCH2CH2)nO-," depending upon whether or not the terminal oxygens have been displaced. Throughout the specification and claims, it should be remembered that the term "PEG" includes structures having various terminal or "end capping" groups. The term "PEG" also means a polymer that contains a majority, that is to say, greater than 50%, of -OCH2CH2- or -CH2CH2O-repeating subunits. With respect to specific forms, the PEG can take any number of a variety of molecular weights, as well as structures or geometries such as "branched," "linear," "forked," "multifunctional," and the like, to be described in greater detail below.<br>
[0028]	The terms "end-capped" and "terminally capped" are interchangeably<br>
used herein to refer to a terminal or endpoint of a polymer having an end-capping moiety. Typically, although not necessarily, the end-capping moiety comprises a hydroxy or C1-20 alkoxy group, more preferably a C1-20 alkoxy group, and still more preferably a CM alkoxy group. Thus, examples of end-capping moieties include alkoxy (e.g., methoxy, ethoxy and benzyloxy), as well as aryl, heteroaryl, cyclo, heterocyclo, and the like. It must be remembered that the end-capping moiety may include one or more atoms of the terminal monomer in the polymer [e.g., the end-capping moiety "methoxy" in CH3(OCH2CH2)n-]. In addition, saturated, unsaturated, substituted and unsubstituted forms of each of the foregoing are envisioned. Moreover, the end-capping group can also be a silane. The end-capping group can also advantageously comprise a detectable label. When the polymer has an end-capping group comprising a detectable label, the amount or location of the polymer and/or the moiety (e.g., active agent) to which the polymer is coupled can be determined by using a suitable detector. Such labels include, without limitation, fluorescers, chemiluminescers, moieties used in enzyme labeling, colorimetric moieties (e.g., dyes), metal ions, radioactive moieties, and the like. Suitable detectors include photometers, films, spectrometers, and the like. The end-capping group can also advantageously comprise a phospholipid. When the polymer has an end-capping group comprising a phospholipid, unique properties are imparted to the polymer and the resulting conjugate. Exemplary phospholipids include, without limitation, those selected from the class of phospholipids called phosphatidylcholines. Specific phospholipids include, without limitation, those selected from the group consisting of dilauroylphosphatidylcholine, dioleylphosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, disteroylphosphatidylcholine, behenoylphosphatidylcholine, arachidoylphosphatidylcholine, and lecithin.<br>
[0029]	"Non-naturally occurring" with respect to a polymer as described<br>
herein, means a polymer that in its entirety is not found in nature. A non-naturally occurring polymer may, however, contain one or more monomers or segments of monomers that are naturally occurring, so long as the overall polymer structure is not found in nature.<br>
[0030]	The term "water soluble" as in a "water-soluble polymer" is any<br>
polymer that is soluble in water at room temperature. Typically, a water-soluble polymer will transmit at least about 75%, more preferably at least about 95%, of light transmitted by the same solution after filtering. On a weight basis, a water-soluble polymer will preferably be at least about 35% (by weight) soluble in water, more preferably at least about 50% (by weight) soluble in water, still more preferably about 70% (by weight) soluble in water, and still more preferably about 85% (by weight) soluble in water. It is most preferred, however, that the water-soluble polymer is about 95% (by weight) soluble in water or completely soluble in water.<br>
[0031]	Molecular weight in the context of a water-soluble polymer, such as<br>
PEG, can be expressed as either a number-average molecular weight or a weight-average molecular weight. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to molecular weight herein refer to the weight-average molecular weight. Both molecular weight determinations, number-average and weight-average, can be measured using gel permeation chromatography or other liquid chromatography techniques. Other methods for measuring molecular weight values can also be used, such as the use of end-group analysis or the measurement of colligative properties (e.g., freezing-point depression, boiling-point elevation, or osmotic pressure) to determine number-average molecular weight or the use of light scattering techniques, ultracentrifugation or viscometry to determine weight-average molecular weight. The polymers of the invention are typically polydisperse (i.e., number-average molecular weight and weight-average molecular weight of the polymers are not equal), possessing low polydispersity values of preferably less than about 1.2, more preferably less than about 1.15, still more preferably less than about 1.10, yet still more preferably less than about 1.05, and most preferably less than about 1.03. As used herein, references will at times be made to a single water-soluble polymer having either a weight-average molecular weight or number-average molecular weight; such references will be understood to mean that the single-water soluble polymer was obtained from a composition of water-soluble polymers having the stated molecular weight.<br>
[0032]	The terms "active" or "activated" when used in conjunction with a<br>
particular functional group, refer to a reactive functional group that reacts readily with an electrophile or a nucleophile on another molecule. This is in contrast to those<br>
groups that require strong catalysts or highly impractical reaction conditions in order to react (i.e., a "non-reactive" or "inert" group).<br>
[0033]	As used herein, the term "functional group" or any synonym thereof is<br>

The precise amount will depend upon numerous factors, e.g., the particular active agent, the components and physical characteristics of the therapeutic composition, the intended patient population, the mode of delivery, individual patient considerations, and the like, and can readily be determined by one skilled in the art,<br>
[0054]	"Multi-functional" means a polymer having three or more functional<br>

unreacted activated carbonate reagent [such as di(l-benzotriazolyl) carbonate] using a reactive molecule, which may optionally be a moiety bound on a resin or column, to chemically destroy all or most of the unreacted activated carbonate reagent in a chemical process.<br>
[0059]	"One pot", as in a one pot synthetic method, means that products from a<br>
previous reaction need not be isolated prior to conducting a subsequent reaction.<br>

An activated carbonate must, however, result in an activated urethane-, carbonate-, or thiocarbonate-terminated, water-soluble polymer upon reaction with an amine-terminated, hydroxyl-terminated, or thiol-terminated, water-soluble polymer. An activated urethane-, carbonate-, or thiocarbonate-terminated, water-soluble polymer, in turn, is a urethane-, carbonate-, or thiocarbonate-terminated, water-soluble polymer that can react with either a protein or with a reagent to result in a reactive group-terminated, water-soluble polymer.<br>
[0062]	Unless the context clearly dictates otherwise, when the term "about"<br>
precedes a numerical value, the numerical value is understood to mean ± 10% of the stated numerical value.<br>
[0063]	The Steps of the Synthetic Method<br>
[0064]	The synthetic method includes the following steps:<br>
(a) combining a composition comprising an amine-terminated or hydroxy-terminated, water-soluble polymer with a composition comprising an activated carbonate reagent, optionally in the presence of a catalyst or acid-neutralizing base, wherein the composition comprising the activated carbonate reagent is added such that there is an excess of the activated carbonate reagent relative to the amine-terminated or hydroxy-terminated, water-soluble polymer, to thereby result in a composition comprising an active carbonate ester of the water-soluble polymer and unreacted activated carbonate reagent; and<br>
(b) adding a composition comprising a reactive molecule to trie composition comprising the active carbonate ester of the water-soluble polymer and unreacted activated carbonate reagent, wherein the composition comprising a reactive molecule is added such that substantially all of the unreacted activated carbonate reagent is substantially consumed.<br>
[0065]	The combining step results in the formation of, among other things, a<br>
composition comprising an active urethane-, carbonate- or thiol-terminated, water-soluble polymer. A urethane-terminated, water-soluble polymer is formed when a composition comprising an amine-terminated, water-soluble polymer is used. A carbonate-termitiated, water-soluble polymer is formed when a composition comprising a hydroxyl-terminated, water-soluble polymer is used. A thiocarbonate-tenninated, water-soluble polymer is formed when a thiol-terminated, water-soluble polymer is used. Each of these so-formed water-soluble polymers (i.e., the urethane-terminated, water-soluble polymer, the carbonate-terminated, water-soluble polymer, and the thiocarbonate-terminated, water-soluble polymer) the prepared as part of the methods provided herein will be referred to as an active carbonate ester of the water-soluble polymer.<br>
[0066]	The method of the invention is schematically provided below, wherein<br>
a composition comprising the hydroxyl-terminated, water-soluble polymer mPEG-OH is used, the activated carbonate reagent is di( '1-benzotriazolyl) carbonate, the resulting active carbonate ester is mPEG-BTC, and the reactive molecule is water.<br>
Step<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
[0067]	Thus, in an exemplary approach, the method comprises<br>
a) combining a composition comprising a hydroxy-terminated, water-soluble polymer of the following structure: POLY-(X)a-OH, wherein POLY is a water-soluble polymer, X (when present) is an optional spacer moiety, (a) is either zero or one [preferably, POLY-(X)a-OH is CH3O-(CH2CH2O)n-CH2CH2-OH], with a composition comprising di(l-benzotriazolyl) carbonate, wherein the composition comprising the di(l-benzotriazolyl) carbonate is added such that there is an excess of the di(l-benzotriazolyl) relative to the hydroxy-terminated, water-soluble polymer, to thereby result in a composition comprising an active carbonate ester of a water-soluble polymer having the following structure:<br>
(Strucutre Removed)<br>
  wherein POLY, X and (a) are as previously defined, preferably<br>
wherein (n) is an integer from 2 to about 4000, and unreacted di(l-benzotriazolyl) carbonate (and liberated hydroxybenzotriazole);<br>
b) adding water to the composition comprising the active carbonate ester of the water-soluble polymer and unreacted di(l-benzotriazolyl) carbonate, wherein the water is added such that substantially all of the unreacted activated carbonate reagent is substantially consumed.<br>
[0068]	The method can advantageously be carried out as a "one-pot" synthesis.<br>
In addition, the method does not require a precipitation step to remove the activated carbonate reagent as required in the method disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,624,246. However, if this activated carbonate reagent is the reagent desired, it may be isolated by precipitation.<br>
[0069]	Optionally, the method further comprises reacting the active carbonate<br>
ester of a water soluble polymer (such as mPEG-BTC) in one or more reactions to form a different polymeric reagent. Having formed a polymeric reagent, it is possible<br>
to react the polymeric reagent with an active agent under conjugation conditions to thereby result in a water-soluble polymer-active agent conjugate. While the active carbonate ester of the water soluble polymer (such as mPEG-BTC) can be used as an intermediate in the formation of a polymeric reagent, it is also possible to use the active carbonate ester (such as mPEG-BTC) itself as a polymeric reagent in a conjugation reaction.<br>
[0070]	In order to recover active carbonate esters of water-soluble polymers, it<br>
is typical to add an excess of a non-solvent. Examplary non-solvents include isopropyl alcohol, diethyl ether, MTBE, heptane, THF, hexane, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0071]	In one or more embodiments of the invention, the active carbonate ester<br>
of the water-soluble polymer will have a structure of the following formula:<br>
POLY-0-(C=O)-0-R<br>
wherein:<br>
POLY is a water-soluble polymer; and<br>
R is an organic radical,<br>
with the proviso that when POLY is a linear, methyl-capped polyethylene glycol), the linear, methyl-capped polyethylene glycol has a molecular weight of at least 103.<br>
[0072]	Exemplary reactive molecules for use in the method include<br>
nucleophilic molecules such as water, lower alkyl monohydric alcohols (such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, and so forth), lower alkyl monobasic amines, and resins bearing bound reactive carboxylate, hydroxyl, thiol or amine groups (via, for example, an amine gel, such as a Duolite A-7 amine gel). Advantageously, such resin can form part of a column through which a composition bearing unreacted activated carbonate reagent can be passed to effect the step of "adding a composition comprising a reactive molecule to the composition comprising an active carbonate ester of the water-soluble polymer and unreacted activated carbonate reagent"). It is preferred, however, that the reactive molecule, is water. Water can be added directly. In addition, water can be added via a moiety that releases water, such a hydrated salt.<br>
[0073]	In one or more embodiments of the method, the formation of carbon<br>
dioxide results upon the unreacted activated carbonate reagent being substantially consumed.<br>
[0074]	The combining step requires, as a composition comprising an<br>
amine.-terminated, hydroxy-terminated, or thiol-terminated, water-soluble polymer. As used herein, an "amine-terminated, hydroxy-terminated or thiol-terminated, water-soluble polymer" is any water-soluble polymer that bears at least one amine group ("-NH2") or hydroxy group ("-OH"), or thiol group ("-SH"), regardless of whether the amine group, hydroxy group or thiol group is actually located at a terminus of the water-soluble polymer. In fact, the amine group (-NH2) or hydroxy group ("OH") or thiol group ("-SH") may be bound to an aromatic group.<br>
[0075]	The combining step also requires a composition comprising an<br>
activated carbonate reagent. The activated carbonate reagent use in the method is typically, although not necessarily, selected from the group consisting of di(l-benzotriazolyl) carbonate (BTC), disuccinimidyl carbonate ("DSC"), p-nitrophenyl chloroformate, trichlorophenyl chloroformate, p-nitrophenyl succinimidyl carbonate, p-nitrophenyl 1-benzotriazolyl carbonate, pentafluorophenyl chloroformate, 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole, disuccinimidyl oxalate, and triphosgene. In certain instances, the activated carbonate reagent has a structure of one of the following formulae: R-O(C=O)-OR; R-O(C=O)-OR'; and R-O(C=O)X, wherein R is an organic radical, R' is an organic radical different than R, and X is Cl, Br, or I.<br>
[0076]	The excess of the activated carbonate reagent relative to the<br>
amine-terminated or hydroxy-terminated, water-soluble polymer represents one or more of the following: at least about 5 mol % excess, at least about 50 mol % excess, at least about a two molar excess; at least about a four molar excess; and at least about an eight molar excess.<br>
[0077]	The method for preparing active carbonate esters of water-soluble<br>
polymers has utility as, among other things, providing an intermediate that is useful in the formation of polymeric reagents, as discussed in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,624,246, and 5,932,462.<br>
[0078]	The combining step is typically carried out under substantially<br>
nonaqueous conditions. In addition, aprotic solvent-based compositions are used in the synthetic methods. In addition, the entire synthetic approach is often carried out under an inert atmosphere, such as argon.<br>
[0079]	One or more of the steps of the method are carried out in an organic<br>
solvent. Although any organic solvent can be used and the invention is not limited in this regard, exemplary organic solvents include those solvents selected from the group consisting of halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, aromatic hydrocarbons, halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, ethers, cyclic ethers, and combinations thereof. Examples of preferred organic solvents include those selected from the group consisting of methylene chloride (dichloromethane), chloroform, octanol, toluene, methyl t-butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, diethylcarbonate, acetone, acetonitrile, DMF, DMSO, dimethylacetamide, N-cyclohexylpyrrolidinone, cyclohexane and combinations thereof.<br>
[0080]	Method for Preparing a Conjugate-Containing Composition<br>
[0081]	In one or more embodiments of the invention, a method for preparing a<br>
conjugate-containing composition is provided, the method comprising combining an active agent with an active carbonate ester of a water-soluble polymer (or a polymeric reagent that was prepared using such an active carbonate ester of a water-soluble polymer) to thereby result in a conjugate-containing composition. Thus, included within the invention are methods for preparing conjugate-containing compositions.<br>
[0082]	Conjugate-Containing Compositions<br>
[0083]	In one or more embodiments of the invention, a conjugate-containing<br>
composition is provided, the composition resulting from the method comprising combining an active agent with an active carbonate ester of a water-soluble polymer (or a polymeric reagent that was prepared using such an active carbonate ester of a water-soluble polymer) as provided herein.<br>
[0084]	Thus, included within the invention are conjugate-containing<br>
compositions. The compositions (both conjugate compositions and reagent<br>
compositions) are believed to have greater purity than previously known methods and also more efficiently prepared.<br>
[0085]	The Water-Soluble Polymer ("POLY")<br>
[0086]	As used herein, the term "water soluble polymer" includes those water<br>
soluble polymers that are biocompatible and nonimmunogenic and specifically excludes any water soluble polymer segments that are not biocompatible and nonimmunogenic. With respect to biocompatibility, a substance is considered biocompatible if the beneficial effects associated with use of the substance alone or with another substance (e.g., active agent) in connection with living tissues (e.g., administration to a patient) outweighs any deleterious effects as evaluated by a clinician, e.g., a physician. With respect to non-immunogenicity, a substance is considered nonimmunogenic if the intended use of the substance in vivo does not produce an undesired immune response (e.g., the formation of antibodies) or, if an immune response is produced, that such a response is not deemed clinically significant or important as evaluated by a clinician. It is particularly preferred that the water soluble polymer segments described herein as well as conjugates are biocompatible and nonimmunogenic.<br>
[0087]	When referring to the polymer, it is to be understood that the polymer<br>
can be any of a number of water soluble and non-peptidic polymers, such as those described herein as suitable for use in the present invention. Preferably, poly(ethylene glycol) (i.e., PEG) is the polymer. The term PEG includes poly(ethylene glycol) in any of a number of geometries or forms, including linear forms, branched or multi-arm forms (e.g., forked PEG or PEG attached to a polyol core), pendant PEG, or PEG with degradable linkages therein, to be more fully described below.<br>
[0088]	The number of functional groups carried by the polymer and the<br>
position of the functional groups may vary. Typically, the polymer will comprise 1 to about 25 functional groups, preferably 1, 2,3,4, 5, 6,7, 8,9, or 10 functional groups. Linear polymers, such as PEG polymers, will typically comprise one or two functional groups positioned at the terminus of the polymer chain. If the PEG polymer is monofunctional (i.e., mPEG), the polymer will include a single functional group. If the PEG polymer is difunctional, the polymer may contain two independently selected<br>
functional groups, one at each terminus of the polymer chain. As would be understood, multi-arm or branched polymers may comprise a greater number of functional groups.<br>
[0089]	Multi-armed or branched PEG molecules, such as those described in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,932,462, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, can also be used as the PEG polymer. Generally speaking, a multi-armed or branched polymer possesses two or more polymer "arms" extending from a central branch point. For example, an exemplary branched PEG polymer has the structure:<br>
PEG,<br>
wherein PEG] and PEG2 are PEG polymers in any of the forms or geometries described herein, and which can be the same or different, and L' is a hydrolytically stable linkage. An exemplary branched PEG has the structure: <br>
(Strucutre Removed)<br>
wherein polya and polyb are PEG backbones, such as methoxy polyethylene glycol); R" is a nonreactive moiety, such as H, methyl or a PEG backbone; and P and Q are nonreactive linkages. In a preferred embodiment, the branched PEG polymer is methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) disubstituted lysine. For purposes herein, a multi-arm structure will include three or more branches while a branched structure will include only two branches.<br>
[0090]	The branched PEG structure can be attached to a third oligomer or<br>
polymer chain as shown below:<br>
(Strucutre Removed)<br>
wherein PEG3 is a third PEG oligomer or polymer chain, which can be the same or different from PEG1 and PEG2.<br>
[0091]	The PEG polymer can alternatively comprise a forked PEG. Generally<br>
speaking, a polymer having a forked structure is characterized as having a polymer chain attached to two or more functional groups via covalent linkages extending from a hydrolytically stable branch point in the polymer. An example of a forked PEG is represented by PEG-YCHZ2, where Y is a linking group and Z is an activated terminal group for covalent attachment to a biologically active agent. The Z group is linked to CH by a chain of atoms of defined length. U.S. Patent No. 6,362,254 discloses various forked PEG structures capable of use in the present invention. The chain of atoms linking the Z functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl groups) to the branching carbon atom serve as a tethering group and may comprise, for example, an alkyl chain, ether linkage, ester linkage, amide linkage, or combinations thereof.<br>
[0092]	The PEG polymer may comprise a pendant PEG molecule having<br>
reactive groups (e.g., hydroxyl groups) covalently attached along the length of the PEG backbone rather than at the end of the PEG chain. The pendant reactive groups can be attached to the PEG backbone directly or through a linking moiety, such as an alkylene group.<br>
[0093]	In addition to the above-described forms of PEG, the polymer can also<br>
be prepared with one or more hydrolytically stable or degradable linkages in the polymer backbone, including any of the above described polymers. For example, PEG can be prepared with ester linkages in the polymer backbone that are subject to hydrolysis. As shown below, this hydrolysis results in cleavage of the polymer into fragments of lower molecular weight:<br>
-PEG-CO2-PEG- + H2O → -PEG-CO2H + HO-PEG-<br>
[0094]	Other hydrolytically degradable linkages, useful as a degradable linkage<br>
within a polymer backbone, include carbonate linkages; imine linkages resulting, for example, from reaction of an amine and an aldehyde (see, e.g., Ouchi et al., Polymer Preprints, 38(l):582-3 (1997)); phosphate ester linkages formed, for example, by reacting an alcohol with a phosphate group; hydrazone linkages which are typically<br>
formed by reaction of a hydrazide and an aldehyde; acetal linkages that are typically formed by reaction between an aldehyde and an alcohol; ortho ester linkages that are, for example, formed by reaction between acid derivatives and an alcohol; and oligonucleotide linkages formed by, for example, a phosphoramidite group, e.g., at the end of a polymer, and a 5' hydroxyl group of an oligonucleotide. The use of many of the above-described degradable linkages is less preferred due to nucleophilic reactivity of many of the unstable linkages with amine groups.<br>
[0095]	It is understood by those skilled in the art that the term polyethylene<br>
glycol) or PEG represents or includes all the above forms of PEG.<br>
[0096]	Any of a variety of other polymers comprising other non-peptidic and<br>
water soluble polymer chains can also be used in the present invention. The polymer can be linear, or can be in any of the above-described forms (e.g., branched, forked, and the like). Examples of suitable polymers include, but are not limited to, other poly(alkylene glycols), copolymers of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, poly(olefinic alcohol), poly(vinylpyrrolidone), poly(hydroxyalkylmethacrylamide), poly(hydroxyalkylmethacrylate), poly(saccharides), poly(a-hydroxyacetic acid), poly(acrylic acid), poly(vinyl alcohol), polyphosphazene, polyoxazolines, poly(N-acryloylmorpholine), such as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,629,384, and copolymers, terpolymers, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0097]	Although the molecular weight of the water soluble polymer can vary<br>
depending on the desired application, the configuration of the polymer structure, the degree of branching, and the like, the molecular weight will satisfy one or more of the following values: greater than 100 Daltons; greater than 200 Daltons; greater than 400 Daltons; greater than 500 Daltons, greater than 750 Daltons; greater than 900 Daltons; greater than 1,000 Daltons, greater than 1,400 Daltons; greater than 1,500 Daltons, greater than 1,900 Daltons; greater than 2,000 Daltons; greater than 2,200 Daltons; greater than 2,500 Daltons; greater than 3,000 Daltons; greater than 4,000 Daltons; greater than 4,900 Daltons; greater than 5,000 Daltons; greater than 6,000 Daltons; greater than 7,000 Daltons; greater than 7,500 Daltons, greater than 9,000 Daltons; greater than 10,000 Daltons; greater than 11,000 Daltons; greater than 14,000 Daltons, greater than 15,000 Daltons; greater than 16,000 Daltons; greater than 19,000 Daltons;<br>
greater than 20,000 Daltons; greater than 21,000 Daltons; greater than 22,000 Daltons, greater than 25,000 Daltons; and greater than 30,000 Daltons. It is understood that the maximum limit of molecular weight for any given water soluble polymer segment useful herein is less than about 300,000 Daltons.<br>
[0098]	The molecular weight of the polymer will typically fall into at least one<br>
of the following ranges: from about 100 Daltons to about 100,000 Daltons; from about 200 Daltons to about 60,000 Daltons; from about 300 Daltons to about 40,000 Daltons.<br>
[0099]	Exemplary molecular weights for the water soluble polymer segment<br>

Nonlimiting examples of bivalent cycloalkyl (e.g., cycloalkylene) groups include C3-8 cycloalkyl, such as various isomers of cyclopropadiyl (e.g., 1,1-, cis-11,2-, or trans-1,2-cyclopropylene), cyclobutadiyl, cyclopentadiyl, cyclohexadiyl, and cycloheptadiyl. The cycloalkylene group can be substituted with one or more alkyl groups, preferably C1-C6 alkyl groups.<br>
[0104]	Having formed the active carbonate ester of a water-soluble polymer,<br>
the active carbonate ester of a water-soluble polymer can be used "as is" as a polymeric reagent useful for a conjugation reaction with an active agent, or can optionally be further derivatized to form a different polymeric reagent bearing a different reactive group. Preferred reactive groups are selected from the group of electrophiles and nucleophiles. Exemplary reactive groups include hydroxyl (-OH), ester, orthoester, carbonate, acetal, aldehyde, aldehyde hydrate, ketone, vinyl ketone, ketone hydrate, thione, thione hydrate, hemiketal, sulfur-substituted hemiketal, ketal, alkenyl, acrylate, methacrylate, acrylamide, sulfone, amine, hydrazide, thiol, disulfide,<br>

Specific examples of preferred reactive groups include amine, carboxylic acid, ester, aldehyde, acetal, succinimide, and maleimide.<br>

 wherein r is 1-5, r1 is 0-5, and R7 is aryl or alkyl.<br>
[0106]	For example, the active carbonate ester of a water-soluble polymer can<br>
be reacted with amino acids to form amino acid derivatives. Thus, for example, mPEG-BTC esters can be reacted with lysine to form a polymeric lysine derivative. For example, one such lysine [i.e., H2N(CH2)4CH(NH2)CO2H-HC1] derivative is a doubly PEGylated lysine, wherein the two PEGs are linked to the lysine amines by carbamate bonds, as shown below (wherein n is 2 to about 4000). <br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
[0107]	Such PEG derivatives of lysine are useful as reagents for preparation of<br>
PEG derivatives of proteins. These PEG derivatives often offer advantages over non-PEGylated proteins, such as longer circulating life-times in vivo, reduced rates of proteolysis, and lowered immunogenicity. In another aspect, PEG BTC derivatives are used directly in attaching PEG to proteins through carbamate linkages and may offer advantages similar to those described for the lysine PEG derivatives.<br>
[0108]	Thus for example, the above "PEG2 Acid" can be reacted with<br>
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide to form a PEG2 active ester (N-hydroxysuccinimide) of the PEG2 acid. Then, in a subsequent reaction, the PEG2 active ester can be reacted, in the presence of a tertiary amine base, with a trifluoroacetic acid salt of the ethylene diamine monoamide of<br>
3-N-maleirnidopropanoic acid to form a polymeric reagent bearing a maleimide group capable of reacting with thiol groups on proteins, bioengineered biomolecules and other therapeutic molecules of interest.<br>

[0109]	Biologically Active Conjugates<br>
[0110]	For any given polymer, the methods described above advantageously<br>
provide the ability to further transform the polymer (either prior or subsequent to any deprotection step) so that it bears a specific reactive group. Thus, using techniques well known in the art, the polymer can be funcrionalized to include a reactive group (e.g., active ester, thiol, maleimide, aldehyde, ketone, and so forth).<br>
[0111]	For example, when the polymer bears a carboxylic acid as the reactive<br>
group, the corresponding ester can be formed using conventional techniques. For example, the carboxylic acid can undergo acid-catalyzed condensation with an alcohol, thereby providing the corresponding ester. One approach to accomplish this is to use the method commonly referred to as a Fischer esterification reaction. Other techniques for forming a desired ester are known by those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0112]	For example, when the polymer bears a carboxylic acid as the reactive<br>
group, the corresponding ester can be formed using conventional techniques.

One approach to accomplish this is to use the method commonly referred to as a Fischer esterification reaction. Other techniques for forming a desired ester are known by those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0113]	In addition, polymers bearing a carboxylic acid can be modified to form<br>
useful reactive groups other than esters. For example, the carboxylic acid can be further derivatized to form acyl halides, acyl pseudohalides, such as acyl cyanide, acyl isocyanate, and acyl azide, neutral salts, such as alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal salts (e.g. calcium, sodium, and barium salts), esters, anhydrides, amides, imides, hydrazides, and the like. In a preferred embodiment, the carboxylic acid is esterified to form an N-succinimidyl ester, o-, m-, or p-nitrophenyl ester, 1-benzotriazolyl ester, imidazjslyl ester, or N-sulfosuccinimidyl ester. For example, the carboxylic acid can be converted into the corresponding N-succinimidyl ester by reacting the carboxylic acid with dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (DCC) or diisopropyl carbodiimide (DIC) in the presence of a N-hydroxysuccinimide.<br>
[0114]	The steps of the synthesis methods described above take place in an<br>
appropriate solvent. One of ordinary skill in the art can determine whether any specific solvent is appropriate for any given reaction. Typically, however, the solvent is a nonpolar solvent or a polar aprotic solvent. Nonlimiting examples of nonpolar solvents include benzene, xylene, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and toluene. Exemplary polar aprotic solvents include, but are not limited to, acetonitrile, DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), HMPA (hexamethylphosphoramide), DMF (dimethylformamide), DMA (dimethylacetamide), and NMP (N-methylpyrrolidinone).<br>
[0115]	The method of preparing the polymers optionally comprises an<br>
additional step of isolating and recovering the polymer once it is formed. Known methods can be used to isolate the polymer, but it is particularly preferred to use chromatography, e.g., size exclusion chromatography. Alternately or in addition, the method includes the step of purifying the polymer once it is formed. Again, standard art-known purification methods can be used to purify the polymer. Isolation of the active carbonate ester of a water-soluble polymer can also be accomplished by distilling off the solvent using art-known methods.<br>
[0116]	The polymers of the invention can be stored under an inert atmosphere,<br>
such as under argon or under nitrogen. In this way, potentially degradative processes associated with, for example, atmospheric oxygen, are reduced or avoided entirely. In some cases, to avoid oxidative degradation, antioxidants, such as butylated hydroxyl toluene (BHT), can be added to the final product prior to storage. In addition, it is preferred to minimize the amount of moisture associated with the storage conditions to reduce potentially damaging reactions associated with water. Moreover, it is preferred to keep the storage conditions dark in order to prevent certain degradative processes that involve light. Thus, preferred storage conditions include one or more of the following: storage under dry argon or another dry inert gas; storage at temperatures below about -15 °C; storage in the absence of light; and storage with a suitable amount (e.g., about 50 to about 500 parts per million) of an antioxidant such as BHT.<br>
[0117]	The above-described polymers are useful for conjugation to<br>
biologically active agents or surfaces comprising at least one group suitable for reaction with the reactive group on the polymer. For example, amino groups (e.g., primary amines), hydrazines, hydrazides, and alcohols on an active agent or surface will react with a carboxylic acid group on the polymer. In addition, a more "activated" version of the carboxylic acid of the polymer can be prepared in order to enhance reactivity to the biologically active agent or surface. Methods for activating carboxylic acids are known in the art and include, for example, the method for forming an active ester described above. Other approaches for activating a carboxylic acid are known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0118]	Typically, the polymer is added to the active agent or surface at an<br>
equimolar amount (with respect to the desired number of groups suitable for reaction with the reactive group) or at a molar excess. For example, the polymer can be added to the target active agent at a molar ratio of about 1:1 (polymenactive agent), 1.5:1, 2:1, 3:1,4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 8:1, or 10:1. The conjugation reaction is allowed to proceed until substantially no further conjugation occurs, which can generally be determined by monitoring the progress of the reaction over time. Progress of the reaction can be monitored by withdrawing aliquots from the reaction mixture at various time points and analyzing the reaction mixture by SDS-PAGE or MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry or any other suitable analytical method. Once a plateau is reached with respect to the amount of conjugate formed or the amount of unconjugated polymer remaining, the reaction is assumed to be complete. Typically, the conjugation reaction takes anywhere from minutes to several hours (e.g., from 5 minutes to 24 hours or more). The resulting product mixture is preferably, but not necessarily, purified to separate out excess reagents, unconjugated reactants (e.g., active agent), undesired multi-conjugated species, and free or unreacted polymer. The resulting conjugates can then be further characterized using analytical methods such as MALDI, capillary electrophoresis, gel electrophoresis, and/or chromatography.<br>
[0119]	With respect to polymer-active agent conjugates, the conjugates can be<br>
purified to obtain/isolate different conjugated species. Alternatively, and more preferably for lower molecular weight (e.g., less than about 20 kiloDaltons, more preferably less than about 10 kiloDaltons) polymers, the product mixture can be purified to obtain the distribution of water-soluble polymer segments per active agent. For example, the product mixture can be purified to obtain an average of anywhere from one to five PEGs per active agent (e.g., protein), typically an average of about 3 PEGs per active agent (e.g., protein). The strategy for purification of the final conjugate reaction mixture will depend upon a number of factors, including, for example, the molecular weight of the polymer employed, the particular active agent, the desired dosing regimen, and the residual activity and in vivo properties of the individual conjugate(s).<br>
[0120]	If desired, conjugates having different molecular weights can be<br>
isolated using gel filtration chromatography. That is to say, gel filtration<br>
chromatography is used to fractionate differently numbered polymer-to-active agent ratios (e.g., 1-mer, 2-mer, 3-mer, and so forth, wherein "1-mer" indicates 1 polymer to active agent, "2-mer" indicates two polymers to active agent, and so on) on the basis of their differing molecular weights (where the difference corresponds essentially to the average molecular weight of the water-soluble polymer segments). For example, in an exemplary reaction where a 100 kDa protein is randomly conjugated to a PEG alkanoic acid having a molecular weight of about 20 kDa, the resulting reaction mixture will likely contain unmodified protein (MW 100 kDa), mono-pegylated protein (MW 120 kDa), di-pegylated protein (MW 140 kDa), and so forth. While this approach can be used to separate PEG and other polymer conjugates having different molecular weights, this approach is generally ineffective for separating positional isomers having different polymer attachment sites within the protein. For example, gel filtration chromatography can be used to separate mixtures of PEG 1-mers, 2-mers, 3-mers, and so forth, although each of the recovered PEG-mer compositions may contain PEGs attached to different reactive amino groups (e.g., lysine residues) within the active agent.<br>
[0121]	Gel filtration columns suitable for carrying out this type of separation<br>
include Superdex™ and Sephadex™ columns available from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). Selection of a particular column will depend upon the desired fractionation range desired. Elution is generally carried out using a suitable buffer, such as phosphate, acetate, or the like. The collected fractions may be analyzed by a number of different methods, for example, (i) optical density (OD) at 280 nm for protein content, (ii) bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein analysis, (iii) iodine testing for PEG content [Sims et al.(1980) Anal. Biochem, 107:60-63], and (iv) sodium dodecyl sulfphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE), followed by staining with barium iodide.<br>
[0122]	Separation of positional isomers is carried out by reverse phase<br>
chromatography using a reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) C18 column (Amersham Biosciences or Vydac) or by ion exchange chromatography using an ion exchange column, e.g., a Sepharose™ ion exchange column available from Amersham Biosciences. Either approach can be used to<br>
separate polymer-active agent isomers having the same molecular weight (positional isomers).<br>
[0123]	Following conjugation, and optionally additional separation steps, the<br>
conjugate mixture can be concentrated, sterile filtered, and stored at low a temperature, typically from about -20 °C to about -80 °C.  Alternatively, the conjugate may be lyophilized, either with or without residual buffer and stored as a lyophilized powder. In some instances, it is preferable to exchange a buffer used for conjugation, such as sodium acetate, for a volatile buffer such as ammonium carbonate or ammonium acetate, that can be readily removed during lyophilization, so that the lyophilized powder is absent residual buffer. Alternatively, a buffer exchange step may be used using a formulation buffer, so that the lyophilized conjugate is in a form suitable for reconstitution into a formulation buffer and ultimately for administration to a mammal.<br>
[0124]	The polymers of the invention can be attached, either covalently or<br>
noncovalently, to a number of entities including firms, chemical separation and purification surfaces, solid supports, metal surfaces such as gold, titanium, tantalum, niobium, aluminum, steel, and their oxides, silicon oxide, macromolecules (e.g., proteins, polypeptides, and so forth), and small molecules. Additionally, the polymers can also be used in biochemical sensors, bioelectronic switches, and gates. The polymers can also be employed as carriers for peptide synthesis, for the preparation of polymer-coated surfaces and polymer grafts, to prepare polymer-ligand conjugates for affinity partitioning, to prepare cross-linked or non-cross-linked hydrogels, and to prepare polymer-cofactor adducts for bioreactors.<br>

[0135]	The pharmaceutical preparations encompass all types of formulations<br>
and in particular those that are suited for injection, e.g., powders that can be reconstituted as well as suspensions and solutions. The amount of the conjugate (i.e., die conjugate formed between the active agent and the polymer described herein) in the composition will vary depending on a number of factors, but will optimally be a therapeutically effective dose when the composition is stored in a unit dose container (e.g., a vial). In addition, the pharmaceutical preparation can be housed in a syringe. A therapeutically effective dose can be determined experimentally by repeated administration of increasing amounts of the conjugate in order to determine which amount produces a clinically desired endpoint.<br>
[0136]	The amount of any individual excipient in the composition will vary<br>
depending on the activity of the excipient and particular needs of the composition. Typically, the optimal amount of any individual excipient is determined through routine experimentation, i.e., by preparing compositions containing varying amounts of the excipient (ranging from low to high), examining stability and other parameters of the composition, and then determining the range at which optimal performance is attained with no significant adverse effects.<br>
[0137]	Generally, however, the excipient will be present in the composition in<br>
an amount of about 1% to about 99% by weight, preferably from about 5%-98% by weight, more preferably from about 15-95% by weight of the excipient, with concentrations less than 30% by weight most preferred.<br>
[0138]	These foregoing pharmaceutical excipients along with other excipients<br>
are described in "Remington: The Science &amp; Practice of Pharmacy", 19th ed., Williams &amp; Williams, (1995), the "Physician's Desk Reference", 52nd ed., Medical Economics, Montvale, NJ (1998), and Kibbe, A.H., Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 3rd Edition, American Pharmaceutical Association, Washington, D.C., 2000.<br>
[0139]	The pharmaceutical preparations of the present invention are typically,<br>
although not necessarily, administered via injection and are therefore generally liquid<br>
solutions or suspensions immediately pnor to administration. The pharmaceutical preparation can also take other forms such as syrups, creams, ointments, tablets, powders, and the like. Other modes of administration are also included, such as pulmonary, rectal, transdermal, transmucosal, oral, intrathecal, subcutaneous, intra-arterial, and so forth.<br>
[0140]	As previously described, the conjugates can be administered<br>
parenterally by intravenous injection, or less preferably by intramuscular or by subcutaneous injection. Suitable formulation types for parenteral administration include ready-for-injection solutions, dry powders for combination with a solvent prior to use, suspensions ready for injection, dry insoluble compositions for combination with a vehicle prior to use, and emulsions and liquid concentrates for dilution prior to administration, among others.<br>
[0141]	The invention also provides a method for administering a conjugate as<br>
provided herein to a patient suffering from a condition that is responsive to treatment with a conjugate. The method comprises administering, generally via injection, a therapeutically effective amount of the conjugate (preferably provided as part of a pharmaceutical preparation). The method of administering may be used to treat any condition that can be remedied or prevented by administration of the particular conjugate. Those of ordinary skill in the art appreciate which conditions a specific conjugate can effectively treat. The actual dose to be administered will vary depend upon the age, weight, and general condition of the patient as well as the severity of the condition being treated, the judgment of the health care professional, and conjugate being administered. Therapeutically effective amounts are known to those skilled in the art and/or are described in the pertinent reference texts and literature. Generally, a therapeutically effective amount will range from about 0.001 mg to 100 mg, preferably in doses from 0.01 mg/day to 75 mg/day, and more preferably in doses from 0.10 mg/day to 50 mg/day.<br>
[0142]	The unit dosage of any given conjugate (again, preferably provided as<br>
part of a pharmaceutical preparation) can be administered in a variety of dosing schedules depending on the judgment of the clinician, needs of the patient, and so forth. The specific dosing schedule will be known by those of ordinary skill in the art or can be determined experimentally using routine methods. Exemplary dosing<br>
schedules include, witnout limitation, administration nve times a day, tour times a day, three times a day, twice daily, once daily, three times weekly, twice weekly, once weekly, twice monthly, once monthly, and any combination thereof. Once the clinical endpoint has been achieved, dosing of the composition is halted.<br>

Example 7<br>
Preparation of mPEG(20.0QO Da)BTC Large Scale Synthesis<br>
[0152]	mPEG(20,000 Da)-OH (28kg) was dissolved in anhydrous acetonitrile<br>
(93 kg) under argon atmosphere. The mixture was dried by passing through a molecular sieves cartridge, then the cartridge was washed with 50L of acetonitrile. The drying process was repeated until the water content was less than lOOppm. Di(l-benzotriazolyl) carbonate (1285g of 42 % mixture) was then combined with about 2000 mL of acetonitrile in a separate vessel to form a slurry, which was added under argon to the previously prepared mixture. The separate vessel was rinsed twice with acetonitrile (about 200 mL) to enhance quantitative transfer. Pyridine (200 mL) was<br>
tnen added under argon and followed by mixing at 31 oC ±3o for 12 Hours. Water (about 20 mL), diluted with acetonitrile (1 L), was added and the entire reaction mixture was mixed at 31 °C ± 3 °C for 60 minutes. Thereafter, the reaction mixture was distilled under reduced pressure and the product was collected and allowed to cool. Isopropanol (551 kg) with a low water content was then added. After addition of the isopropanol was complete, the resulting precipitate was mixed for a minimum of thirty minutes. Thereafter, the precipitate was isolated and washed with isopropanol (about 90 kg) under argon. Finally, the precipitate was dried under vacuum. The percent yield and total amount of product was 22 kg (79% yield). NMR analysis showed that the product contained 98.6% of desired mPEO(20,000 Da)-BTC and 1.4% of starting mPEG(20,000 Da)-OH. No isopropyl benzotriazole carbonate was detected.<br>
Comparative Example 8<br>
Preparation of mPEG(2Q.OQO Da)-BTC Large Scale Synthesis with no water treatment<br>
[0153]	The large scale synthesis of mPEG(20,000 Da)-BTC described in the<br>
Example 7 was repeated but water was not added to the reaction mixture to hydrolyze residual di(l-benzotriazolyl) carbonate. NMR analysis showed that the final product contained 44 mol % of isopropyl benzotriazolyl carbonate. Thus, this experiment shows that large scale production with the need to isolate and remove activated carbonate reagents is possible. However, loss on precipitation is predicted to be 10-20% based on comparative experiments.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
