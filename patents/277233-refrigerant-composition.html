				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a refrigerant particularly but not exclusively for refrigeration systems. The system relates especially to refrigerant compositions which have no adverse effect on the atmospheric ozone layer and to compositions which are for use in refrigeration systems designed to use Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) including CFC502 (an azeotrope of chloropentafluoromethane and chlorodifluoromethane)) and HCFC22 (chlorodifluoromethane) . These refrigerant compositions are compatible with lubricants commonly found in refrigeration and air conditioning systems and also with oxygen containing lubricants including but not restricted to polyol ester and polyalkylene glycol oils.<br>
The compositions of this invention may also be used in new equipment.<br>
Although considerable care is taken to prevent leakage of refrigerant to the atmosphere, on occasions this does occur. In some territories the emission of hydrocarbons is regulated to minimise the generation of tropospheric ozone caused by the effect of sunlight on hydrocarbons mixed with oxygen. To minimise the contribution of hydrocarbon to the atmosphere by leakage of the blends which are the subject of this invention, the hydrocarbon content should be preferably less than 5 % more preferably less than 3 %.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND PRIOR ARTS<br>
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs e.g. CFC 11, CFC 12, CFC502) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs eg HCFC 22, HCFC 123) are stable, of low toxicity and non-flammability providing low hazard working conditions when used in refrigeration and air conditioning systems. If released, they permeate into the stratosphere and attack the ozone layer which protects the environment from the damaging effects of ultraviolet rays. The Montreal Protocol, an international environmental agreement signed by over 160 countries, mandates the phase-out of CFCs and HCFCs according to an agreed timetable.<br>
CFCs and HCFCs have been superseded in new air conditioning, refrigeration and heat pump equipment by hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs eg HFC 134a, HFC 125, HFC 32, HFC 143a, HFC 152a) either as pure fluids or as blends. However, HFCs do not<br>
 <br>
have adequate solubility in traditional lubricants such as mineral and alkylbenzene oils so that synthetic oxygen containing lubricants have been introduced specifically for new equipment. These new lubricants are expensive and hygroscopic.<br>
Some refrigerants, such as R407C, have wide temperature glides (&gt; 4°C) in the evaporator and condenser. Equipment manufacturers, based on their experience with CFC/HCFC single fluids or azeotropes, prefer refrigerants with low glides. A further object of this invention is to provide HFC/hydrocarbon blends that can substitute for R22 and azeotrope R502 (CFC 115/HCFC 22) in order to allow the continued use of hydrocarbon lubricants in equipment and minimising the temperature glides in the heat exchangers by providing azeotropic and near azeotropic formulations.<br>
Various terms have been used in patent literature to describe refrigerant mixtures. The following definitions are taken from ASHRAE Standard 34;<br>
Azeotrope: an azeotropic blend is one containing two or more refrigerants whose equilibrium vapour and liquid phase compositions are the same at a given pressure. Azeotropic blends exhibit some segregation of components at other conditions. The extent of the segregation depends on the particular azeotrope and the application.<br>
Azeotropic temperature: the temperature at which the liquid and vapour phases of a blend have the same mole fractionation of each component at equilibrium for a specified pressure.<br>
Near azeotrope: a zeotropic blend with a temperature glide sufficiently small that it may be disregarded without consequential error in analysis for a specific application. Zeotrope: blends comprising multiple components of different volatilities that, when used   in   refrigeration   cycles,   change   volumetric   composition   and   saturation temperatures as they evaporate (boil) or condense at constant pressure.<br>
Temperature glide: the absolute value of the difference between the starting and ending temperatures of a phase-change process by a refrigerant within a component of a refrigerating system, exclusive of any subcooling or superheating. This term usually describes condensation or evaporation of a zeotrope.<br>
 <br>
The present invention relates to azeotropic, near azeotropic and zeotropic refrigerant compositions, which are non flammable under all conditions of fractionation as defined under ASHRAE Standard 34, and which can be used to replace ODS in an existing or new unit without the need to change the lubricant or make any significant change to the system hardware.<br>
While it is known in the art that the addition of a small amount of hydrocarbon to a refrigerant composition containing an HFC or HFC mixtures can result in sufficient hydrocarbon being dissolved in the lubricant to be transported around the system so that lubrication of the compressor is maintained at all times, it is not well understood how to achieve non flammable compositions under all conditions including fractionation of the refrigerant compositions which can take place during a leak of the refrigerant from the system or during storage.<br>
Not all HFCs are non flammable as defined under ASHRAE Standard 34. HFC 143a has not received a non flammable rating by ASHRAE. This invention relates to compositions of refrigerants which covers blends of non flammable HFC 125 with flammable HFC 143a and hydrocarbons in selected proportions selected so that all such compositions are non flammable during fractionation while providing similar refrigerating effects and thermodynamic performances as the ODS they replace, namely R502 and R22.<br>
While this invention relates to refrigerant compositions which can be used with traditional lubricants such as mineral and alkylbenzene oils, they are also suitable for use with synthetic oxygen containing lubricants.<br>
To avoid flammability in the blend, or in a fraction generated by a leak, for example as defined by ASHRAE Standard 34, the total amount of hydrocarbon should be minimised. At the same time the quantity of the hydrocarbon mixture dissolved in the oil needs to be maximised for good oil return, especially at those locations in the circuit where the oil is at its most viscous, for example the evaporator. A single higher boiling hydrocarbon, such as butane or isobutane, would certainly show higher solubility in the oil than a lower boiling hydrocarbon such as propane. However, as the result of a leak, for example from a cylinder, a higher boiling hydrocarbon will<br>
 <br>
concentrate in the liquid phase. The amount of hydrocarbon, therefore, needs to be limited in order to avoid generating a flammable mixture towards the end of the leak. This problem can be avoided by using only a low boiling hydrocarbon such as propane. However, this has two disadvantages. Firstly, lower boiling hydrocarbons are less soluble than higher boiling hydrocarbons in hydrocarbon lubricants in the evaporator when present at similar weights percent as formulated in the blend. Consequently they are less effective at ensuring good oil return. Secondly, because of their higher volatility they tend to concentrate in the vapour phase of a blend. Their concentration, therefore needs, to be restricted to avoid generating flammable mixtures at the beginning of a leak. This problem is exacerbated if the lower boiling HFC is also flammable.<br>
The ratio of R143a to R125 and the presence of the lower boiling propane with the higher boiling isobutane results in a non flammable mixture at worst case fractionation as defined by ASHRAE Standard 34. The following test results were carried out by independent external laboratories:<br>
Sample 1:	%<br>
R125	76.81<br>
R143a	18.66<br>
Propane	2.38<br>
Isobutane	2.16<br>
Total hydrocarbon	4.54<br>
Flammability test using a 12 litre flask as per ASHRAE standard was conducted on this mixture at 60°C and was found to be non flammable.<br>
Sample 2:	%<br>
R125	74<br>
R143a	22<br>
Isobutane	4<br>
The same flammability test as per sample 1 was conducted on this mixture which was found to be flammable with a Lower Flammable Limit of 15%   v at 60 C.<br>
 <br>
In patent number EP12380 39B1 Roberts teaches away from the inclusion of methyl propane (isobutane) in blends containing HFCs due to flammability concerns at worst case fractionation. In patent number US6,526,764 Bl Honeywell teaches away from the addition of propane due to an undesirable increase in the pressure in the system.<br>
Surprisingly we have found that the addition of propane to a HFC blend containing a combination of HFC 125 &amp; HFC 143a with a higher boiling hydrocarbon such as isobutane results in a lower level of flammability thereby enabling the blend to be non flammable under all conditions of fractionation under ASHRAE Standard 34. This allows the total amount of hydrocarbon of the blend to be reduced while simultaneously the amount dissolved in the oil in the evaporator is increased.<br>
This invention enables a flammable HFC such as HFC 143a to be used in a non flammable refrigerant blend thereby substantively improving its performance, in particular its capacity<br>
In US5,211,867, azeotropic compositions are claimed of R125 and R143a, but it does not teach that hydrocarbons can be usefully added to the blends of these two HFCs. It is a key feature of this invention that a specially selected hydrocarbon or mixtures of hydrocarbons are present in order to facilitate oil return to the compressor. Surprisingly it has been found that, despite the flammability of HFC 143a, the selection of a hydrocarbon or mixtures of hydrocarbons enables the compositions to be non flammable during fractionation. The combination of a low boiling hydrocarbon such as propane (BP -45.5°C) with a higher boiling hydrocarbon such as butane (BP -0.5°C) and/or isobutane (BP -11.5°C) avoids build up of hydrocarbon content in the liquid phase during a leakage while the more volatile propane is countered in the vapour phase by azeotroping with the fire suppressant HFC 125.<br>
In the search for a refrigerant blend that can be readily used to replace R22 or R502 in existing equipment, it is especially important that the new blend should have an adequate refrigeration capacity. The capacity should be at least 90% of that of the fluid it is replacing, more preferably at least 95% of that of the fluid it is replacing and most preferably equal to or greater than that of the fluid it is replacing under similar operating conditions. Should a retrofit blend with too low a capacity be used, there is a significant risk that under high load conditions the<br>
 <br>
refrigeration system will not maintain the desired low temperature thereby resulting in shortening the storage life of frozen foodstuffs or other materials being stored at low temperature<br>
In selecting an acceptable refrigerant blend, equipment reliability is also important. The inclusion of hydrocarbons in the present blends ensures that oil leaving the sump of the compressor returns to the sump thus preventing inadequate lubrication of the compressor bearings and pistons which could occur if the oil was retained elsewhere in the system.<br>
A further important factor is the discharge temperature of the refrigerant leaving the compressor. If the discharge temperatures are too high, the discharge valves can be damaged by over heating and /or by the deposition of solid decomposition products from the oil and the refrigerant. The blends shown in the examples all have lower discharges temperatures than that of R502 and much lower than that of R22. The present blends also benefit from the absence of chlorine. R502 and especially R22 have the potential at discharge temperatures to produce corrosive hydrochloric acid, especially if traces of water are present.<br>
