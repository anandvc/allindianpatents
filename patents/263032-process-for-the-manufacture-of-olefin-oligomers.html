				<td>Process for the manufacture of olefin oligomers<br>
Technical field<br>
The invention relates to the preduction of high-grade base oils and to selective<br>
dimerization of n-olefins usinj; a solid and acidic catalyst. Particularly, the inven-<br>
tion is directed to a process wherein n-olefins are dimerized in a catalytic distilla-<br>
tion apparatus, followed by hy Irogenation to give polyolefins.<br>
State of the art<br>
Saturated olefinic oligomers are a significant group of high-grade synthetic base<br>
oils. Poly-alpha-olefins known as PAOs are typically produced by oligomerization<br>
of alpha-olefins in the presence of homogsneous Friedel-Crafts catalysts, such as<br>
boron trifluoride (BF3) and a promoter at slightly elevated BF3 pressures, and<br>
temperatures below 100 °C. Water or an alcohol normally serves as the promoter.<br>
In the PAO process, 1 -decent¦ is typically used as the feedstock, mainly giving<br>
trimers and tetramers of the feedstock olefin as the product.<br>
Base oils may also be produced by dimerization of n-olefins heavier than decene.<br>
Base oils of the PIO (poly(intt rnal olefin)) group are produced by dimerization of<br>
internal n-olefins, typically C-15-C16 n-clefins, using BF3 catalysts. Among the<br>
products of the PIO process, fimers are particularly suitable feedstocks for base<br>
oil production.<br>
A catalyst separation step is ..lways necessary in PAO and PIO processes using<br>
homogeneous catalysts.<br>
As is known, n-olefins refer to linear olsiins or linear olefins with no more than<br>
one branch, that is, to slightly oranched olcfins.<br>
Oligomerization refers to a reaction where molecules of at least one type react<br>
with each other resulting in the increase of the molecular weight, said increase<br>
being the added molecular we ight of at least three molecules. Oligomerization<br>
may be illustrated with the following equation:<br><br>
where A may be identical with or different from B, x is 0 or an integer, y is 0 or<br>
an integer, x+y &gt; 2, Sx = n, Sy = m, A and B are olefmic molecules, and n and m<br>
are integers. The term oligomtr refers to a. repetitive combination of monomeric<br>
units of at least the one type, this number of said units ranging from 3 to 100.<br>
The term dimerization refers to a reaction where molecules of at least one type<br>
react with each other resulting in the increase of the molecular weight, said in-<br>
crease being the added molecular weight of at least two molecules. Dimerization<br>
may be illustrated with the following equation:<br><br>
where A may be identical with or different from B, A and B being olefmic mole-<br>
cules. The term dimer refers to a combination of two monomeric units of at least<br>
one type.<br>
The term polyolefin refers to a combination comprising at least two olefmic<br>
monomeric units of at least one type.<br>
Several alternative heterogene jus catalysts for the dimerization of heavy olefins<br>
are known e.g. from patents LS 4,417,088, US 5,053,569, US 5,453,556 and US<br>
6,703,356. In addition to the dssired dimerization reaction, the use of said hetero-<br>
geneous acid catalysts disclose d in said documents resulted in cracking and isom-<br>
erization reactions of the feedstock olefins, as well as formation of heavier oli-<br>
gomers, mainly trimers and tetamers. Particularly detrimental isomerization reac-<br>
tions of the feedstock olefins i lclude reactions yielding products that may not be<br>
dimerized, such as naphthenes. Attainable yields of the base oil are lowered by the<br>
cracking products formed as well as naphthenes resulting from the isomerization<br>
of monomeric olefins. Because relatively valuable olefin are used as the process<br>
feedstock, any undesirable side reactions tiereof also have a considerable impact<br>
on the feasibility of the process.<br>
The document US 5,053,569 discloses the dimerization of a-olefins using an<br>
acidic calcium/montmorillonite catalyst. The document US 6,703,356 discloses an<br>
oligomerization process of alpha-olefins using alpha-olefins with a carbon number<br>
ranging between 10 and 30, or a mixture thereof as the feedstock. The catalyst is<br>
specified as a crystal catalyst "laving a constraint index of less than 3. The con-<br>
straint index is a measure of the product selectivity of the catalyst. In the exam-<br>
ples, 1-hexadecene, l-tetradeene and 1-octadecne are used as feedstocks,<br>
whereas MCM-22, MCM-56, USY, Beta, ZSM-12 and WOx/on ZrO2 are used as<br>
catalysts.<br>
In the examples of the above documents US 5,053,569 and US 6,703,356, highest<br>
conversions attained in the dimsrization of heavy olefins using heterogeneous acid<br>
catalysts are 92 % and 87 %. A conversion of clearly below 100 % may be attrib-<br>
uted to the formation of naphtr enes from feedstock olefins. The product obtained<br>
in the examples of the documeit US 5,053,569 contained trimers and heavier oli-<br>
gomers in a total amount of 47 %, which i,3 not desirable for the properties of the<br>
base oil product. Selectivity fo • dimers is higher (70 %) in the example described<br>
in the document US 6,703,3.66, having a high conversion (87 %), yet high<br>
amounts of cracked products (4 %) were obtained.<br>
The term catalytic distillation refers generally to the combination of a chemical<br>
reaction with the product separation. The rsaction and product separation are car-<br>
ried out together in an inseparable manner. A catalytic distillation apparatus nor-<br>
mally comprises a distillation ;olumn incorporating one or more catalytic zones.<br>
In said catalytic zones, streams from a specified level or plate of the distillation<br>
column are treated to give desired reaction products. Thereafter, the product<br>
stream is fractionated using it distillation means. Said catalytic zone may be<br>
placed within or outside the distillation means. In industrial applications, catalytic<br>
distillation is used in the prodi ction of ethers, said process being also known e.g.<br>
for dehydration of alcohols, and oxydation of paraffins.<br>
Use of the catalytic distillation is also known in the oligomerization process. US<br>
4,935,577 discloses an oligomerization process wherein alpha-olefins having from<br>
3 to 12 carbon atoms are passed to a distillation column containing Lewis acid<br>
catalyst for the reaction. The temperature of the catalytic distillation apparatus is<br>
no more than about 150 °C, ths typical operation temperature range being below<br>
50 °C. A combination catalysi is used in the distillation apparatus, and accord-<br>
ingly, a unit for the separation of the Lev/is acid prior to recycling to the distilla-<br>
tion apparatus is an essential part of the apparatus<br>
US 2,198,937 discloses an apparatus comprising a distillation column and a side<br>
reactor for the polymerization of hydrocarbons. The apparatus may be operated<br>
under conditions similar to those in catalytic distillation.<br>
The document FI 96852 disclc ses a process and an apparatus for oligomerizing<br>
olefins. In this process, C3-C20 )lefins or mixtures thereof are passed to a catalytic<br>
distillation system where the f :edstock olefins are contacted with a catalyst at a<br>
temperature of above 150 °C, hus yielding a product containing oligomers. The<br>
catalyst used in this process manly consists of zeolite, the products formed being<br>
middle distillates and lubricant'. The catalytic distillation system used in the proc-<br>
ess may also be a distillation column for the product separation, connected to at<br>
least one side reactor containing the catalys:.<br>
Based on above teachings it may be seen that there is an obvious need for a novel<br>
improved process for the production of polyolefins from n-olefms, said novel<br>
process eliminating or at least s ubstantially reducing problems and deficits associ-<br>
ated with the solutions of the state of the art.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a process for the production of polyolefins<br>
from n-olefms.<br>
Another object of the inventior is to provide a process for the production of poly-<br>

Further, an object of the inven:ion is to provide a process for the dimerization of<br>
C8-C30 n-olefms using a solid acidic mesoporous catalyst to give polyolefins.<br>

Yet another object of the invention is the use of a catalytic distillation apparatus<br>
for the dimerization of n-olefins, particularly C8-C30 n-olefins,<br>
An object of the invention is a. so to provide di-n-olcfins consisting of two identi-<br>
cal or different n-olefms having carbon chain lengths of C8-C30.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing high-grade products use-<br>
ful as base oils and base oil components from n-olefins using a solid and acidic<br>
catalyst, by dimerizing an n-olrfin or a mixture of n-olefms in a catalytic distilla-<br>
tion apparatus, wherein the catalyst is placed into a distillation column or into a<br>
side reactor outside the distillation column, followed by hydrogenation of the<br>
product. In the process of the invention, the: feedstock comprising an n-olefin or a<br>
mixture of n-olefms, is dimerzed in the presence of a solid acidic catalyst by<br>
passing the feedstock to a catalytic distillation apparatus either comprising a) a<br>
combination of a distillation  column and a reactor having at least one catalyst<br>
layer, or b) a distillation column connected to one or more side reactors having at<br>
least one catalyst layer, recovering the unreacted n-olefin at the upper part of the<br>
distillation column or the combination of the distillation column and the reactor as<br>
a side-stream to be combined with the feedstock, whereas the reaction product<br>
from the dimerization is hydrogenated. Impurities still present in the dimerization<br>
product or final product may optionally be removed using an additional distilla-<br>
tion step.<br>
The invention and some alternative embodiments thereof are illustrated by ap-<br>
pended figures 1, 2 and 3, however, without wishing to limit the invention to these<br>
presented embodiments.<br>
Figures<br>
Figure 1 schematically shows an embodiment of the invention for producing a<br>
base oil component.<br>
Figure 2 schematically shows an embodiment of the invention wherein the<br>
dimerization of n-olefins is car'ied out in a catalytic distillation apparatus with the<br>
catalyst in separate side reactois.<br>
Figure 3 schematically shows an embodiment of the invention wherein the<br>
dimerization of n-olefins is performed in a combination of a distillation column<br>
and a reactor.<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic presentution of the basic solution of the inventive process.<br>
The feedstock of the process, 01 stream 1, containing C8-C30 n-olefins or a mixture<br>
thereof is obtained from a feed tank (not shown in the figure). Stream 4 recovered<br>
at the upper part of a distillatioi column B is combined with stream 1. Streams 1<br>
and 4 together form the stream 2, which is passed to side reactor A containing the<br>
dimerization catalyst layer / bed D. Stream 3 is obtained as the product of the side<br>
reactor A, said stream 3 containing C8-C30 n-olefm monomers and as reaction<br>
products mainly dimeric produsts. Stream 3 is passed to a distillation column B<br>
where C8-C30 n-olefm monomers rise to the upper part of said distillation column<br>
B, followed by recycling the n-olefm monomer fraction thus obtained as stream 4<br>
to the side reactor A in the reaction stage. Stream 5 is removed at the top of the<br>
distillation column B, said stream 5 containing components of non-dimerizable<br>
monomer fraction in the upper part of the distillation column. With stream 5 the<br>
accumulation of the componei.ts of non-dimerizable monomer fraction such as<br>
branched compounds is prevented in the catalytic distillation apparatus. The prod-<br>
uct in the form of a product stream 6 mainly consisting of dimers is obtained from<br>
the bottom of the distillation column B, said stream 6 being passed to a hydro-<br>
genation reactor C. In the hydrogenation reactor C, olefins arc hydrogenated to<br>
give the product, suitable as a base oil component, followed by the removal of<br>
said product from the hydrogen ition reactor C as the product stream 7.<br>
In figure 2, a preferable soluticn of the process of the invention is shown. In this<br>
solution, a catalytic distillatioi apparatus having dimerization catalyst layers D<br>
and E placed in separate side re actors A and B is used. The feedstock of the proc-<br>
ess, or stream 1, containing C8-C30 n-olefins or a mixture thereof is obtained from<br>
a feed tank (not shown in the figure). Stream 4 recovered at the upper part of a<br>
distillation column C is combined with stream 1. Streams 1 and 4 together form<br>
the stream 2 being either passe i to a side rsactor A or side reactor B. Stream 2 is<br>
passed to the side reactor containing fresh catalyst or regenerated catalyst. Simul-<br>
taneously, the other side reactor contains the exhausted catalyst, or the catalyst is<br>
being regenerated. There are two side reactors in the system, and accordingly, it is<br>
not necessary to shut down the process due to lowered catalytic activity. Stream 3<br>
is obtained as the product of the side reactor A or B, said stream 3 containing Cs-<br>
C30 n-olefin monomers and as i eaction products mainly dimeric products. Stream<br>
3 is passed to a distillation column C where C8-C30 n-olefin monomers rise to the<br>
upper part of said distillation column C, followed by recycling the n-olefin<br>
monomer fraction thus obtainec as stream 4 to the side reactor A or B in the reac-<br>
tion stage. Stream 5 is removed at the upper part of the distillation column C, said<br>
stream containing components of non-dimerizable monomer fraction at the upper<br>
part of the distillation column C. Accumulation of the components of non-<br>
dimerizable monomer fraction  such as branched compounds in the catalytic distil-<br>
lation apparatus is prevented by stream 5. From the lower part of the distillation<br>
column C, a product stream 6 mainly consisting of dinners, subsequently passed to<br>
a hydrogenation reactor for hydrogenation (not shown in the figure), and a bottom<br>
product 7 are obtained.<br>
Figure 3 shows another preferable solution of the inventive process, using a cata-<br>
lytic distillation apparatus having the dimerizing catalyst layer B placed inside the<br>
distillation column A. The feed stream 1 comprising C8-C30 n-olefms or a mixture<br>
thereof is combined with the n-olefin monomer fraction 4 from the top of the dis-<br>
tillation column A to give a stieam 2 for passing to the distillation column A, to<br>
the upper part of the catalyst la/er B. In the distillation column A, the feed passes<br>
to the catalyst layer B, in which the dimerization reaction mainly proceeds. In the<br>
catalyst layer B, n-olefin monomer is in the form of a vapour/liquid mixture and<br>
the liquid n-olefin monomer ashes the dimers and oligomers formed from the<br>
catalyst, n-olefin monomer fration 3 is obtained from the top of the distillation<br>
column A, said fraction being  plit to give a monomer fraction 4 to be recycled to<br>
the reactor, and a monomer steam 5. Accumulation of non-dimerizable compo-<br>
nents of the monomer fraction in the catalytic distillation apparatus is prevented<br>
by removal of said monomer siream 5. The product in the form of a dimer stream<br>
6 is obtained from the bottom of the distillation column A, said stream 6 being<br>
passed to a hydrogenation read or (not shown in the figure) for hydrogenation.<br>
The catalytic distillation apparatus comprises either a) a combination of a distilla-<br>
tion column and a reactor having at least one catalyst layer, or b) a distillation<br>
column connected to one or more side reactors having at least one catalyst layer.<br>
Detailed description of the in mention<br>
It was surprisingly found that the use of a catalytic distillation apparatus with a<br>
solid acidic catalyst allows for the selective dimerization of n-olefins to give base<br>
oil useful as a lubricant, or base oil component, with an excellent yield that may<br>
even be above 95 %. In the process of the invention, the dimerization of n-olefins<br>
or n-olefin mixtures to yield d. mers is perlbrmed in a catalytic distillation appara-<br>
tus comprising either a) a combination of a distillation column and a reactor com-<br>
prising at least one catalyst layer, or b) a distillation column connected to one or<br>
more side reactors comprising at least one catalyst layer, said catalyst being in the<br>
side reactor outside the distillation column. In this way, the temperature of the<br>
dimerization reaction may be maintained low, typically below 150 CC, thus pre-<br>
venting the formation of naplithenes and cracking of products. Dimerization is<br>
followed by hydrogenation to produce the base oil component. Optionally after<br>
the dimerization and/or hydroj enation, the product may, if necessary, be passed to<br>
a distillation apparatus where my monomer residues are removed from the dimer-<br>
ized product, or the dimers are separated from heavier trimers and tetramers.<br>
The quality of the base oil and'or base oil component obtained as the product use-<br>
ful as a lubricant, after hydrogenation is excellent due to, among other things, low<br>
number of undesirable reactions.<br>
In the process of the inventio 1, n-olefin or a mixture of n-olefins is passed to a<br>
catalytic distillation apparatus where the single conversion of n-olefins may be<br>
suitably controlled. The term single conversion refers to the conversion of an n-<br>
olefm to give another compound during the reaction stage. Single conversion of n-<br>
olefin monomers is defined as follows:<br>
Single conversion of n-olefin monomers (%) = 100 x (proportion of n-olefins in<br>
the feedstock prior to the reaction stage  proportion of n-olcfins in the product<br>
after the reaction stage) / propo/tion of n-olofins in the feedstock prior to the reac-<br>
tion stage.<br>
In the process of the invention, it is preferable to use recycling of the monomeric<br>
olefins particularly in embodiments where the catalyst is placed in a side reactor.<br>
In this case, total conversion and dimerizE.tion selectivity are improved by effi-<br>
cient recycling of the monomeric olefins. A requirement for the efficient recycling<br>
of the monomeric olefins is the adjustment of the reaction conditions to values<br>
preventing undesired side reactions such as cracking and isomerization of the<br>
monomer resulting in naphthcnes. Moreover, relatively low single conversion<br>
between 5 and 50 % is anotier requirement for high dimerization selectivity<br>
meaning selectivity ranging approximately between 80 and 100 %. In the process<br>
of the invention, high total con/ersion, ranging between 95 and 100 %, is attained<br>
with efficient recycling, in spile of the relatively low single conversion. Efficient<br>
recycling means that the exten of recycling is such that between 50 and 95 % of<br>
the original monomer stream contacts the catalyst layer more than once. Extent of<br>
recycling refers to the level o1 the stream passed from the separation step to the<br>
catalyst layer. Dimensioning of the components of the apparatus, and thus the<br>
investment costs depend on tie level of said stream, and therefore, reasonable<br>
extent of recycling is preferab' e for said investment costs. Also energy consump-<br>
tion of the process is influence! by the extent of recycling.<br>
Single conversion is adjusted :o a suitable value on the basis of the carbon num-<br>
ber. Suitable single conversion means that the extent of side reactions such as<br>
formation of heavier oligomer! and cracking is adjusted to be low, that is less than<br>
10 % of the total conversion of the monomeric olefms is due to side reactions.<br>
Reduced formation of heavy c ligomers has a positive impact on the properties of<br>
the base oil product, and retarc s the deactivation rate of the catalyst.<br>
The process of the invention is now described in more detail. In the process, the<br>
feedstock is passed to a catalyst layer in a catalytic distillation apparatus, either<br>
above the catalyst layer in a distillation column where the feedstock migrates to<br>
the catalyst layer, or to a catalyst layer in a side reactor, followed by passing the<br>
reaction mixture to a distillation column or to a lower part of the distillation col-<br>
umn where the monomer fract on migrates to a higher part of the distillation col-<br>
umn, and any impurities present in the monomer lighter than the monomers in the<br>
distillation range leave the di; filiation column at the top thereof or may be re-<br>
moved in a subsequent separat on unit downstream of the distillation column, and<br>
any impurities present in the n.onomer heavier than the monomers in the distilla-<br>
tion range are removed from the column at the bottom or may be removed from<br>
the bottom product in a separat; separation unit.<br>
The dimerization reaction and some simultaneous oligomerization proceed in the<br>
catalyst bed. A monomeric friction such as n-hexadecene with a boiling point<br>
between 280 and 290 °C / 1 atm, rises in the column as the lighter component<br>
upwards from the feeding plate and is removed from the distillation column, typi-<br>
cally at the top thereof as a s :de stream to be recycled and combined with the<br>
feedstock. The dimer produced as the raw product, e.g. C32 olefin, migrates<br>
downward in the distillation column, followed by separation of the dimer stream<br>
at a lower part thereof. Oligomerization product such as C48+ olefin is obtained as<br>
the bottom product stream, In case unreacted olefins and side reactions such as<br>
formation of naphthenes corresponding to monomers with respect to their carbon<br>
number may not be totally avoided, accumulation thereof in the process streams<br>
may, however, be prevented removing part of the side stream to be recycled at<br>
the upper part of the distillation column.<br>
A sqlvent or solvent mixture may be added to the feedstock, thus retarding deacti-<br>
vation of the dimerization catalyst. The solvent is selected among hydrocarbons<br>
such as n-paraffins, isoparaffns and aromatic solvents. The solvent may be re-<br>
moved from the distillation column as a respective side stream via cooling to a<br>
separation unit where the solvent is separated from the reaction product. The sol-<br>
vent may also be recycled in the catalytic distillation apparatus without a separate<br>
separation unit.<br>
The feedstock may be optional y dried for removal of any water and other impuri-<br>
ties present therein. Drying may be carried out with known drying means such as<br>
with commercially available  Secular sieves e.g. zeolite 3A molecular sieve used<br>
for drying hydrocarbons, or using other suitable known methods.<br>
Process feedstock comprises at least one n-olefin selected from the group consist-<br>
ing of C8-C30n-olefins. Examples of suitable n-olefins include 1-decene, mixture<br>
of decenes, 1-dodecene, mixture of dodecenes, 1-hexadecene, mixture of hexade-<br>
cenes, 1-octadecene, mixture of octadecemss, and C20-C22 1-olefins, preferably 1-<br>
hexadecene, or a mixture of h;xadecenes. n-Olefins may be synthetic olefins or<br>
olefins of biological origin, pioduced from biological starting materials such as<br>
vegetable oil and animal fats.<br>
In case a catalytic distillation a jparatus where the catalyst is placed in a side reac-<br>
tor outside the distillation coluinn is used in the dimerization step of the process of<br>
the invention, the feedstock such as 1-hexadecene is directly introduced into the<br>
catalyst layer in the side reacto:1 where a dimer is produced. The product stream of<br>
said side reactor is passed to 1 distillation column where the monomer fraction<br>
such as n-hexadecene having a boiling point between 280 and 290 °C / 1 atm will<br>
rise upward as the lighter component in the distillation column from the feeding<br>
plate and is removed, typically at the top of the column as a side stream and recy-<br>
cled to the side reactor. The dimer formed as the reaction product such as C32 ole-<br>
fin migrates downward in the distillation column, the dimer stream being sepa-<br>
rated at a lower part thereof. an oligomerization product such as C48+ olefin is<br>
obtained as the bottom product stream.<br>
The diiner product obtained above and the bottom product produced as the by-<br>
product are hydrogenated in a hydrogenation step operated continuously or batch<br>
wise in the presence of hydrogsn. Known, hydrogenation catalysts containing met-<br>
als from the groups VIII and/cr VIA of the Periodic System of the Elements may<br>
be used. Preferable hydrogen ition catalysts include supported Pd, Pt, Ni, Cu,<br>
CuCr, NiMo or CoMo catalys" s, the support being preferably alumina and/or sil-<br>
ica. The hydrogenation step is carried out at a pressure of 5 to 100 bar, preferably<br>
at 10 to 70 bar, and at a temper iture of 100 to 400 °C, preferably at 150 to 250 °C.<br>
In the dimerization step of the process of the invention, the temperature in the<br>
distillation column or in the catalyst layer of the side reactor ranges between 25<br>
and 200 °C, preferably between 50 and 150 °C. Pressure range varies according to<br>
the carbon number of the feedi tock and reaction temperature, and further, the lo-<br>
cation of the catalyst either in the catalytic distillation apparatus or in a side reac-<br>
tor has an impact on the pressure range. The pressure range thus varies from re-<br>
duced pressures to elevated pressures. The pressure may vary between 0.001 mbar<br>
and 50 bar, preferably 0.5 bar und 30 bar, particularly preferably between 1 mbar<br>
and 20 bar. WHSV is properly adjusted on the basis of the single conversion and<br>
deactivation rate of the catalyst. WHSV typically ranges between 0.1 and 50 h"1<br>
with respect to the feedstock, pi eferably between 0.5 and 20 h'1.<br>
Selection of the pressure of the dimerization reaction as a function of the tempera-<br>
ture is illustrated in the table 1 below. Table 1 shows the vapour pressure of 1-<br>
decene as a function of the ten.perature. In case the desired reaction temperature<br>
in the catalyst layer of the cataytic distillation apparatus is 50 °C, the pressure is<br>
selected to be 11 mbar, or in case the desired temperature in the catalyst layer of<br>
the catalytic distillation apparatus is 150 CC, the pressure is selected to be 580<br>
mbar.<br>
If a catalytic distillation apparatus where the catalyst is placed in a side reactor is<br>
used, the pressure of the reactor is selected to give the product mixture in liquid<br>
phase.<br>
High-grade base oil or a base oil component may be produced by the process of<br>
the invention from n-olefins us .ng a solid aid acidic catalyst not requiring parts of<br>
the catalyst to be subsequently separated and recycled to the distillation apparatus.<br>
Moreover, solid acidic catalysis always result in isomerization of double bonds.<br>
Particularly suitable solid acidic catalysts include catalysts having a mesopore<br>
surface area of above 100 m2/g as measured by nitrogen adsorption and calculated<br>
with the following BJH equation:<br><br>
Suitable solid acidic catalyst materials include materials having a mesopore sur-<br>
face area based on the BJH eq lation of more than 100 m2/g, preferably more than<br>
300 m2/g. Such materials comprise amorphous aluminium silicates, preferably<br>
acidic amorphous aluminium silicates, and particularly preferably acidic amor-<br>
phous aluminium silicates with Bronsted acidic sites; zeolites, preferably dealu-<br>
minated Y zeolites; and mesoporous materials with a regular porous structure,<br>
containing silicon and aluminium, among which mesoporous molecular sieves<br>
with inserted zeolite are preferable. The zeolite is preferably ZSM-5, beta-zeolite<br>
or MCM-22, whereas the mes jporous molecular sieve is MCM-41 with a regular<br>
molecular structure. The acidic solid catalyst material is particularly preferably a<br>
mesoporous molecular sieve wiih imbedded MCM-22 zeolitic structures.<br>
The expression mesoporous malecular sieve imbedded with zeolite refers to a<br>
catalyst having mesoporous molecular sieve structure and zeolitic structure in the<br>
same material and where said mesoporous molecular sieve structure and zeolitic<br>
structure are bonded together tt rough a chemical bond. The mesoporous molecu-<br>
lar sieve with imbedded zeolite, and the production thereof is disclosed in the pat-<br>
ent application FI 20041675.<br>
The aluminium content of the catalyst material varies between 0.2 and 30 % by<br>
weight as determined by alum inium content assays, while the level of the acid<br>
sites varies between 50 and 50) umol/g as determined by the analysis according<br>
to the NH3-TPD method. Suitable catalyst materials have BrBnsted acidity, the<br>
level thereof being more than 1) umol/g as measured by the proton NMR method.<br>
The mesoporous surface area c f the catalyst material as calculated with the BJH<br>
equation is more than 100 m2/g preferably more than 300 m2/g.<br>
The catalyst also comprises a support material to provide a readily mouldable<br>
catalyst with mechanical resists nee. Said support material is typically an inorganic<br>
oxide such as alumina or silica.<br>
In the process of the invention the olefins and isomers of the olefins in the feed-<br>
stock are preferably recycled, ind the dimsrized and oligomerized fractions thus<br>
produced are obtained as products from the bottom or as a side stream. In this<br>
manner, the total conversion h the process is high, preferably more than 95 %,<br>
and more than 99 % at best.<br>
An apparatus comprising 1) an optional drying means for the feedstock, 2) a cata-<br>
lytic distillation apparatus comprising either a) a combination of a distillation col-<br>
umn and a reactor having at bast one catalyst layer, or b) a distillation column<br>
connected to one or more side reactors having at least one catalyst layer, 3) hy-<br>
drogenation reactor and optimally a distillation column upstream and/or down-<br>
stream of the hydrogenation reactor, is suitable for the process of the invention,<br>
and particularly for dimerizaticn of Cs-Cao n-olefins.<br>
Regeneration of the deactivat sd dimerization catalyst may be performed in the<br>
same reactor as the dimerizat on reaction. The regeneration is carried out at an<br>
elevated temperature using a gaseous mixture that may contain oxygen. During<br>
the regeneration, the temperature is equal or higher than that of the dimerization<br>
reaction. Thermal resistance of the catalyst and the feasibility of the process are<br>
influenced by the maximum legeneration temperature, lower regeneration tem-<br>
peratures being preferable with respect to energy consumption. However, the re-<br>
generation temperature should be sufficiently high for the removal of coal formed<br>
and any impurities adsorbed in the catalyst.<br>
The process of the invention I; endowed with several advantages. The process is<br>
continuous, and thus continuoos production of the base oil component is possible<br>
without interruptions typical for batch reactors.<br>
In the process of the inventior, the reactor feedstock may be adjusted as desired<br>
since the composition may be controlled very precisely at the side exit of the dis-<br>
tillation column. It is thus poss ible to provide the reactor with a stream containing<br>
only a monomer fraction without any lighter or heavier fractions due to possible<br>
unselective reactions, said lighter or heavier fractions yielding products with un-<br>
desirable carbon numbers durir g the reaction stage.<br>
Desired compositions are obtai led as the reactor products since the outlet sites for<br>
the products may be selected. This is particularly useful in cases where a mixture<br>
of n-olefins having different carbon numbers serves as the feedstock.<br>
It was surprisingly found that selective dimerization of olefins is provided at a<br>
reaction temperature below If 0 °C. Selective dimerization means here a dimeriza-<br>
tion selectivity of more than 80 %. Dimer yields are remarkably high since any<br>
unreacted monomer present in the reaction product may be recycled to the feed-<br>
stock for the reactor by adjusting the recycle ratio.<br>
Reactive components may betimmediately separated in the distillation column,<br>
and thus side reactions detrir ental to the process may be quickly stopped. Other<br>
separation units e.g. two disti lation columns are not necessary in the process for<br>
concentration of the feedstock and the reaction product since the concentration of<br>
the product and fractionation if the feedstock may be carried out in the same col-<br>
umn, which accordingly resultss in a simplers apparatus and lower investment costs.<br>
In addition, the regeneration of the dimerization catalyst may be performed in the<br>
same reactor as the reaction.<br>
The invention is now illustraisd with the following examples without wishing to<br>
limit the scope thereof.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1 (comparative example)<br>
Dimerization of olefins in a bitch reactor<br>
Dimerization process was pjrformed in a batch reactor using 1-hexadecene<br>
(Neodene 16®). The process temperature was 200 °C, the reactor pressure being<br>
20 bar. The amount of the fe sdstock was 50 g, and that of the catalyst 2 g. The<br>
total reaction time was 24 hours. Commercially available Y zeolite (TOSOH Co.),<br>
beta-zeolites (TOSOH Co,) aid a mesoporous material MCM-41 (produced ac-<br>
cording to a method disclosed in Catalysis Letters 36 (1996) 103) were used as<br>
catalysts. Total Cu conversion (= conversion of C16 hydrocarbons to give prod-<br>
Dimerization of 1-decene was also performed in a batch reactor. The process tem-<br>
perature was 120 °C, the realtor pressure being 20 bar. Commercially available<br>
aluminium silicate catalyst Nikki Chemical Co. Ltd) was used as the catalyst, in<br>
an amount of 4 % by weight of the feed. The results are shown in the figure 4. The<br>
results indicate that the dimsrization selectivity was clearly lower in the batch<br>
reactor in comparison to the selectivity of the process of the invention.<br>
Example 2<br>
Dimerization in a system corrssponding to a catalytic distillation apparatus, com-<br>
prising dimerization in a flow reactor and distillation<br>
a) Dimerization in a flow reac or<br>
1-Hexadecene (Neodene 16®] was introduced at a rate of 10 g/h into a flow reac-<br>
tor (1 bar (a)). The flow reactcr was packed with 5 g of aluminium silicate catalyst<br>
(Nildci Chemical Co. Ltd) wth an aluminium content of 13 % by weight, the<br>
number of acid sites of 120 xmol/g, and mesoporous surface area &gt; 300 m2/g,<br>
diluted with silicon carbide (\ (catalyst) : V (SiC) = 1:3), followed by the dimeri-<br>
zation reaction at a temperaturs of 120 °C in the reactor. The dimerization product<br>
was collected into a product container. Results of the dimerization, that is, total<br>
The conversion of the C16 hydrocarbons declined the longer the catalyst remained<br>
in the hydrocarbon stream. Accumulation of heavy hydrocarbon oligomers in the<br>
catalyst (coke formation) was  reason to the reduced conversion.<br>
b) Distillation of the products<br>
The experiment of a) was refeated, and the products obtained from the experi-<br>
ments (1766 g) were pooled. The unreactsd monomer fraction (1103 g), middle<br>
fraction containing C20-C30 hy irocarbons (9 g), dimer fraction (452 g) and heavy<br>
bottom product (199 g) were separated from said pooled products by distillation.<br>
c) Recycling of the monomers ' dimerization<br>
The monomer fraction obtained above was used as the feedstock in dimerization.<br>
The distilled monomer fractior mainly consisted of internal C16 olefins. The com-<br>
position of the distilled mono ner fractior. is shown in the table 4 below in the<br>
form of surface area percentages as measured by GC-MS-analysis.<br>
The dimerized product of example 2, separated by distillation, and the bottom<br>
product of the distillation wers hydrogenated as separate batches in a batch reactor<br>
using a heterogeneous nickel catalyst. In the hydrogenation, the reaction time was<br>
2 hours, the temperature was 200 °C, and the pressure was 50 bar. The properties<br>
of the hydrogenated dimer and the bottom product are presented in table 6 below.<br><br>
Example 4<br>
Regeneration of the catalyst<br>
In the dimerization according to example 2 a), the hydrocarbon stream was<br>
stopped after 96 hours. There ifter, the catalyst was purged with nitrogen stream<br>
(30 1/h) for 1.5 hours at 200 °C At the beginning of the regeneration, the nitrogen<br>
stream was replaced with a stieam of synthetic air (8 1/h). The reactor was heated<br>
from 200 °C to 500 °C with the temperature elevation rate of 1.5 °C/min. The<br>
regeneration was continued fcr 2 hours at 500 °C. Then, the temperature was re-<br>
duced again to 200 °C, and the air stream was replaced with nitrogen stream (30<br>
1/h) for 1 hour. Dimerization was carried out using the regenerated catalyst in a<br>
flow reactor (120 °C) as descr.bed in example 2 a). The results are shown in table<br>
7 below.<br><br>
Example 5<br>
Dimerization in a flow reactor using a mesoporous catalyst<br>
A flow reactor was packed wi ;h a fresh mesoporous H-MM-4MW22-2A1 catalyst<br>
(mesoporous molecular sieve embedded with zeolite, the production of which is<br>
described in the patent application FI 20041675) (5 g) having an aluminium con-<br>
tent of 2.2 % by weight, number of acid sites of 180 urnol/g, and mesoporous sur-<br>
face area of &gt; 700 m2, diluted with silicon carbide (support) (V (catalyst) : V<br>
(SiC) = 1:3). Dimerization of 1-hexadecene was performed using the mesoporous<br>
H-MM-4MW22-2A1 catalyst n the flow reactor (120 °C) as described in the ex-<br>
ample 2 a). The results are shewn in the table 8 below.<br><br>
Example 6<br>
Regeneration of the H-MM-4.V1W22-2A1 catalyst<br>
The H-MM-4MW22-2A1 catalyst used in example 5 was regenerated using the<br>
regenerating treatment described in example 4. Dimerization of 1-hexadecene was<br>
performed using this mesopor jus H-MM-4MW22-2A1 catalyst in the flow reactor<br>
(120 °C) as described in the e? ample 2 a). The results are shown in table 9.<br><br>
Example 7<br>
Hydrogenation of the dimerizs tion produces, and properties of the base oil product<br>
Products from examples 6 and 7 were pooled (1448 g). From the pooled product,<br>
unreacted Ci6 fraction (980 g£ was separated by distillation, and from the bottom<br>
product containing dimers (4d2 g) middle fraction (6 g) was separated. The bot-<br>
tom product containing dimeis was hydrogenated according to example 3. Table<br>
10 shows the composition and properties of the hydrogenated bottom product.<br>
Example 8<br>
Dimerization of 1-decene in a catalytic distillation reactor<br>
Dimerization of 1-decene was carried out in a catalytic distillation reactor where<br>
the catalyst was placed inside a distillation column, the amount of the catalyst<br>
being 4 % by weight based on the amount of 1-decene. An aluminium silicate<br>
catalyst (Nikki Chemical Co. Ltd.) was used as the catalyst. Figure 4 graphically<br>
shows the comparison of the reactions either carried out in a batch reactor at a<br>
temperature of 120 °C, or in a catalytic distillation reactor at the same tempera-<br>
ture, respectively using the same catalyst / feedstock level. As can be seen from<br>
figure 4, with the same conversion, a dimer selectivity of more than 90 % may be<br>
attained using a catalytic distillation apparatus, while selectivities in the batch<br>
experiment were below 80 % at identical temperatures..<br>
Example 9<br>
Effect of pressure on the dimer yield in a catalytic distillation apparatus<br>
Dimerization of 1-dccene was carried out in a catalytic distillation apparatus<br>
where the catalyst was placed inside a distillation column, the catalyst being<br>
amorphous aluminium silicate (Nikki Chemical Co. Ltd.), the amount thereof be-<br>
ing 4 % by weight based on the amount of 1-decene. The conversion of 1-decene<br>
was raised to the desired level by adjusting the pressure of the catalytic distillation<br>
apparatus. During the experiment, the pressure was adjusted to values ranging<br>
between 0.17 and 1 bar, the temperature at the bottom of the distillation column<br>
elevating from 80 to 300 °C. Dimer selectivity for all conversion levels was &gt;80<br>
%. Base oil yield was 92 % for the decene conversion of 94 %.<br>
Example 10<br>
Dimerization of 1-hexadecene in a catalytic distillation reactor<br>
Dimerization of 1-hexadecene was performed in a catalytic distillation apparatus<br>
where the catalyst was placed in a distillation column, the amount of the catalyst<br>
being 6.5 % by weight of 1-hcxadecene. The catalyst was amorphous aluminium<br>
silicate (Nilcki Chemical Co. Ltd.). The pressure during the experiment was 0.002<br>
bar, the temperature at the bo torn being elevated from 130 °C to 235 °C as the<br>
dimerization reaction proceeded. Dimer selectivity for all conversion levels was<br>
&gt;80 %. Base oil and dimer yie ds were 99 % and 82 %, respectively, for the hexa-<br>
decene conversion of 99.3 %.<br>
