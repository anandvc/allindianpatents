METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SIMULTANEOUSLY<br>
COMMUNICATING ON A VOICE CHANNEL AND BROADCAST<br>
CHANNEL<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to portable communication devices,<br>
and more particularly relates to a method and apparatus for a portable<br>
communication device to maintain registration with base stations when a voice<br>
channel and a broadcast channel are both in use.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Today's portable communication devices have a multitude of functions in<br>
addition to the traditional point-to-point audio communications. Modern portable<br>
communication devices can receive and transmit multimedia signals, such as<br>
photos or videos, with or without accompanying audio. In addition, multimedia<br>
signals could be communicated in conventional point-to-point communication or<br>
could be broadcast simultaneously to a number of portable communication devices<br>
in a communication system. For example, a concert or a sporting event could be<br>
broadcast as multimedia signals on a broadcast channel to multiple portable<br>
communication devices which have subscribed to such services. The portable<br>
communication devices periodically register with base stations in the<br>
communication system to continue receiving the broadcasted multimedia signals<br>
by transmitting registration messages. Portable communication devices, when<br>
1<br>
WO 2007/027309 PCT/US2006/027846<br>
receiving such signals on a broadcast channel on a first frequency, may wish to<br>
initiate point-to-point communication on a voice channel on a second frequency<br>
without terminating reception of the broadcasted signals on the broadcasting<br>
channel. However, the transmitter necessary for the point-to-point communication<br>
is being utilized to transmit the registration messages necessary to continue<br>
receiving the broadcast channel.<br>
Thus, what is needed is a method and apparatus for simultaneously<br>
accessing a voice channel and a broadcast channel which allows for maintaining<br>
registration on the broadcast channel. Furthermore, other desirable features and<br>
characteristics of the present invention will become apparent from the subsequent<br>
detailed description of the invention and the appended claims, taken in conjunction<br>
with the accompanying drawings and this background of the invention.<br>
2<br>
WO 2007/027309 PCT/US2006/027846<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The present invention will hereinafter be described in conjunction with the<br>
following drawing figures, wherein like numerals denote like elements, and<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a communication system in accordance with<br>
an embodiment of the present invention;<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a portable communication device of the<br>
communication system of FIG. 1 in accordance with the embodiment of the present<br>
invention; and<br>
FIG. 3 is a flowchart of the broadcast registration maintenance operation of<br>
the portable communication device of FIG. 2 in accordance with the embodiment<br>
of the present invention.<br>
3<br>
WO 2007/027309 PCT/US2006/027846<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A method for simultaneously accessing broadcast communication on a first<br>
channel and other communication on a second channel is provided which allows<br>
for maintaining registration on the first channel. The first channel includes a<br>
reverse link access channel for a portable communication device to send<br>
registration messages to a base station and the method initially includes the step of<br>
determining whether a predetermined event requiring registration of the portable<br>
communication device on the first channel has been detected. The predetermined<br>
event may be reception of a message from the base station requiring the portable<br>
communication device to register on the first channel, or determination that a<br>
predetermined time has passed since a previous registration, or determination that<br>
the portable communication device is moving out of a coverage area of the base<br>
station. Next, the method in accordance with the present invention, after detecting<br>
the predetermined event, determines whether the portable communication device is<br>
communicating on a second channel. If not cornmunicating on a second channel,<br>
the portable communication device is registered on the first channel by<br>
transmitting a registration message on the reverse link access channel. If<br>
communicating on the second channel, the portable communication device is<br>
registered on the first channel by transmitting a registration message on the second<br>
channel, such as transmitting a databurst broadcast registration on the second<br>
channel.<br>
4<br>
WO 2007/027309 PCT/US2006/027846<br>
When transmitting a databurst broadcast registration on the second channel,<br>
a broadcast registration message is first generated. Then the broadcast message is<br>
loaded into a databurst container and, thereafter, transmitted as a packet of<br>
information multiplexed with other information on the second channel. If the base<br>
station rejects databurst registration on the second channel or does not accept<br>
databurst communication, the portable communication device is asynchronously<br>
registered with the base station by, for example, freezing power control of the<br>
transmitter, slewing the transmitter to the first channel frequency, transmitting an<br>
asynchronous registration message on the first channel, slewing back to the second<br>
channel frequency, and restarting the transmitter power control.<br>
A portable communication device for simultaneously accessing a broadcast<br>
channel and another channel is also provided which allows for maintaining<br>
registration on the broadcast channel. The portable communication device<br>
includes an antenna, first and second receiver circuitry, transmitter circuitry, a<br>
transmitter channel selector, user interface devices and a controller. The antenna<br>
receives and transmits signals and is coupled to the first receiver circuitry which<br>
receives, demodulates and decodes signals on a broadcast channel to derive<br>
broadcast information therefrom, the second receiver circuitry which receives,<br>
demodulates and decodes signals on a second channel to derive second channel<br>
information therefrom, and the transmitter circuitry which encodes, modulates and<br>
transmits signals on either a reverse link access channel associated with the<br>
broadcast channel or on the second channel. The channel selector is coupled to the<br>
transmitter circuitry for selecting either the broadcast reverse link access channel<br>
5<br>
WO 2007/027309 PCT/US2006/027846<br>
or the second channel for transmitting signals thereon and the user interface<br>
devices present the second channel information and the broadcast information to a<br>
user and also receive inputs from the user.<br>
The controller is coupled to the first receiver circuitry and the second<br>
receiver circuitry for receiving the broadcast and second channel information<br>
therefrom and also coupled to the user interface devices for providing the<br>
broadcast and second channel information thereto and for receiving the user inputs<br>
therefrom. When the controller determines that a predetermined event requiring<br>
registration of the portable communication device on the broadcast channel has<br>
been detected, it provides a signal to the channel selector to transmit a registration<br>
message on the broadcast reverse link access channel if the portable<br>
communication device is not communicating on the second channel and provides a<br>
signal to the channel selector to transmit a registration message on the second<br>
channel if the portable communication device is communicating on the second<br>
channel.<br>
A predetermined event requiring registration of the portable<br>
communication device on the broadcast channel could be reception of a<br>
registration request message, reception of a signal from a timer coupled to the<br>
controller indicating that a predetermined time has passed since a previous<br>
registration, or reception of a signal from an out of coverage area detector coupled<br>
to the first and second receiver circuitry and the controller indicating that the<br>
portable communication device is moving out of a coverage area of the base<br>
station.<br>
6<br>
WO 2007/027309 PCT/US2006/027846<br>
The controller includes a databurst container which generates a packet of<br>
information from the registration message and a channel signal power controller<br>
for controlling the signal power on the second channel. The controller can then<br>
provide the packet of information to the transmitter circuitry for transmission of a<br>
databurst broadcast registration as a packet of information multiplexed with the<br>
second channel information on the second channel when the portable<br>
communication device is communicating on thereon. In addition, when the base<br>
station has rejected the databurst broadcast registration on the second channel or if<br>
the second channel base station advertises that it will not accept databurst<br>
broadcast registrations, the controller transmits the registration message to the base<br>
station asynchronously by, for example, (a) freezing the channel signal power<br>
controller, (b) signaling the channel selector to switch the transmitter circuitry<br>
from the second channel to the reverse link access channel, (c) providing an<br>
asynchronous registration message to the transmitter circuitry for transmission on<br>
the reverse link access channel therefrom, (d) signaling the channel selector to<br>
switch the transmitter circuitry from the reverse link access channel back to the<br>
second channel, and (e) restarting the channel signal power controller.<br>
A communication system is also provided which includes a plurality of<br>
base stations having a coverage area associated therewith for communicating on<br>
broadcast channels and second channels therein with a portable communication<br>
device as described above.<br>
The following detailed description of the invention is merely exemplary in<br>
nature and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the<br>
7<br>
WO 2007/027309 PCT/US2006/027846<br>
invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any theory presented<br>
in the preceding background of the invention or the following detailed description<br>
of the invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a communication system 100 in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the present invention includes a plurality of base stations 110 and a<br>
portable communication device 120. The plurality of base stations 100<br>
communicate with the portable communication device 120 on channels for<br>
conventional point-to-point communications and on broadcast channels for<br>
broadcasting multimedia signals to multiple portable communication devices 120<br>
which have subscribed to such services. Associated with each of the plurality of<br>
base stations 110 is a coverage area 125 wherein the portable communication<br>
device 120 can receive signals from and transmit signals to such one of the<br>
plurality of base stations on either a broadcast channel or another channel. While<br>
FIG. 1 depicts a single communication for supporting both broadcast<br>
communication on one channel and other communication on a second channel, the<br>
present invention is equally applicable to use in two overlapping communication<br>
systems where one system supports broadcast communication and a second<br>
communication system supports communication on a second channel.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a portable communication device 120 in accordance<br>
with the embodiment of the present invention is shown. The portable<br>
communication device 120 includes an antenna 202 for receiving and transmitting<br>
radio frequency (RF) signals. A receive/transmit switch 204 selectively couples<br>
the antenna 202 to first receiver circuitry 206 and transmitter circuitry 208 in a<br>
8<br>
WO 2007/027309 PCT/US2006/027846<br>
manner familiar to those skilled in the art. The receive/transmit switch 204 may<br>
also consist of diplex circuitry to connect the antenna 202 to the receivers 206, 210<br>
and transmitter 208 as is well known to those skilled in the art. In accordance with<br>
the present invention, second receiver circuitry 210 is also coupled to the<br>
receive/transmit switch 204. The second receiver 210 may also be connected to a<br>
second antenna instead of the receive/transmit switch 204 for reception of signals<br>
from a different communication system (e.g., a local or WiFi communication<br>
system). The first receiver circuitry 206 and the second receiver circuitry 210<br>
demodulate and decode the RF signals to derive information and are coupled to a<br>
controller 212 for providing the decoded information thereto for utilization thereby<br>
in accordance with the function(s) of the portable communication device 120. The<br>
controller 212 also provides information to the transmitter circuitry 208 for<br>
encoding and modulating information into RF signals for transmission from the<br>
antenna 202. In accordance with the present invention, the portable<br>
communication device 120 includes diversity receivers whereby the first receiver<br>
circuitry 206 and the transmitter circuitry 208 could support a broadcast channel on<br>
a first frequency, while the second receiver circuitry 210 could be tuned to a<br>
second channel.<br>
The controller 212 is coupled to user interface circuitry 214 including, for<br>
example, a display 218 for presenting video output to a user, user controls 216,<br>
such as a keypad, for receiving user input thereon, a microphone 220 for receiving<br>
voice input which is converted to digital signals by an analog-to-digital (A/D)<br>
9<br>
WO 2007/027309 PCT/US2006/027846<br>
converter 222, and a speaker 224 for providing audio output to the user after<br>
passing signals through a digital-to-analog (D/A) converter 226.<br>
The controller 212 is further coupled to a nonvolatile memory device 228<br>
for storing information therein and for retrieving and utilizing information<br>
therefrom. Additionally, the controller 212 is coupled to a clock 230 for receiving<br>
a clock signal therefrom and to a registration timer 232 for providing a signal to the<br>
controller 212 after a predetermined time has passed after registering with the base<br>
station 110 (FIG. 1).<br>
An out of area detector 234 monitors the strength of the received signals at<br>
the first and/or second receiver circuitry 206, 210 to determine when the portable<br>
communication device 120 is moving out of a coverage area 125 of one of the<br>
plurality of base stations 110 (FIG. 1). Additionally, the controller 212 signals a<br>
channel selector 236 to switch the operational channel of the transmitter circuitry<br>
208. In accordance with the present invention, the channel selector 236 can switch<br>
the transmitter circuitry 208 from transmitting signals on the reverse link access<br>
channel of the broadcast channel to transmitting on the second channel.<br>
In addition to other functionality, the controller 212 includes a databurst<br>
container 238 for generating packet information for providing to the transmitter<br>
circuitry 208 for transmission of a databurst message as a packet of information<br>
multiplexed with voice information. The controller 212 further includes a channel<br>
signal power controller 240 for controlling the power of the signal provided to the<br>
10<br>
WO 2007/027309 PCT/US2006/027846<br>
transmitter circuitry 208 when the transmitter circuitry 208 is tuned to the second<br>
channel.<br>
When receiving broadcast signals, the portable communication device 120<br>
must periodically register with one of the plurality of base stations 110 to continue<br>
to receive the broadcast signals. The operation of the broadcast registration<br>
maintenance routine 300 of the controller 212 is depicted in the flowchart of FIG.<br>
3. Initially, the controller 212 determines whether a predetermined event requiring<br>
registration of the portable communication device 120 on the broadcast channel<br>
has been detected by determining whether a registration request message has been<br>
received from the base station 302 requiring the portable communication device<br>
120 to register on the broadcast channel, or determining whether a signal from the<br>
timer 232 indicates that a predetermined time has passed since a previous<br>
registration 304, or determining whether a signal from the out of area detector 234<br>
indicates that the portable communication device 120 is moving out of a coverage<br>
area 125 of the one of the plurality of base stations 110 with which the portable<br>
communication device 120 is registered 306. When one of the predetermined<br>
events has been detected 302, 304, 306, processing next determines whether the<br>
portable communication device 120 is communicating on a second channel 308,<br>
such as a voice channel.<br>
Not all of the plurality of base stations support databurst communication.<br>
A databurst reject flag can be set to indicate the one of the plurality of base stations<br>
110 with which the portable communication device 120 is communicating doe's not<br>
support databurst communication. When processing determines that a signal from<br>
11<br>
WO 2007/027309 PCT/US2006/027846<br>
the out of area detector 234 indicates that the portable communication device 120<br>
is moving out of a coverage area 125 of the one of the plurality of base stations 110<br>
with which the portable communication device 120 is registered 306, the databurst<br>
reject flag is unset 310 before the second channel communication deterrnining step<br>
308.<br>
If none of the predetermined events has been detected 302, 304, 306,<br>
processing determines whether the portable communication device 120 wishes to<br>
establish communication on a second channel 312 while receiving the broadcast<br>
signals, such as when the user inputs a number to initiate a telephone call. If the<br>
portable communication device 120 wishes to make a call 312, a second channel<br>
(e.g., a voice channel) is established 314 with the transmitter circuitry 208 and the<br>
second receiver circuitry 210, while the broadcast channel is maintained on the<br>
first receiver circuitry 206. Processing then returns to determine if one of the<br>
predetermined events has been detected 302, 304, 306.<br>
If none of the predetermined events has been detected 302, 304, 306, and a<br>
call is not being established 312, processing determines whether the broadcast is<br>
completed 316 by, for example, determining whether the broadcast signals have<br>
ceased. When the broadcast terminates 316, registration on the broadcast channel<br>
does not need to be maintained and the broadcast channel registration maintenance<br>
routine ends 318. If the broadcast is not complete 316, processing returns to<br>
determine if one of the predetermined events has been detected 302, 304, 306.<br>
12<br>
WO 2007/027309 PCT/US2006/027846<br>
After one of the predetermined events has been detected 302, 304, 306, if<br>
the controller 212 determines that the portable communication device 120 is not<br>
communicating on a second channel 308, the transmitter circuitry 208 is free so the<br>
portable communication device 120 can be registered on the broadcast channel by<br>
transmitting a registration message on the reverse link access channel 320. The<br>
timer 232 is then reset 322 to begin measuring the predetermined time to<br>
transmission of the next registration message. Processing then returns to await<br>
detection of one of the predetermined events 302, 304, 306, a request to establish a<br>
second channel 312 or completion of the broadcast signals on the broadcast<br>
channel 316.<br>
If, on the other hand, the controller 212 determines that the portable<br>
communication device 120 is communicating on a second channel 308, the<br>
databurst reject flag is checked to determine if it is set 324 indicating that the base<br>
station does not support databurst communication. If the databurst reject flag is<br>
not set 324, the broadcast registration message is generated 326 and loaded 328<br>
into the databurst container 238. In accordance with the present invention, the<br>
databurst container 238 for broadcast registration generates a packet of information<br>
as a databurst broadcast registration message 328. The databurst broadcast<br>
registration message is then multiplexed with second channel information and<br>
provided to the transmitter circuitry 208 for transmission therefrom on the second<br>
channel 330. Specifically, the burst type 000111 parameter for Third generation<br>
CDMA2000 (currently unassigned) could be assigned to "Broadcast Support" (see<br>
Table 4.1-1 on page 4-1 of Standard C.R1001-D, 3GPP2) and the databurst<br>
13<br>
WO 2007/027309 PCT/US2006/027846<br>
container 238 would packetize the broadcast registration message into a packet of<br>
information and the packet of information would be transmitted over the voice<br>
channel using dim_burst/Blanlc_burst as provided in existing standards 330.<br>
Next the controller 212 determines from information received whether the<br>
base station has rejected the databurst broadcast registration message 332.<br>
Alternatively, the controller 212 may have set the databurst reject flag if the<br>
controller 212 has determined that the base station does not accept databurst<br>
broadcast registrations (e.g., if the base station advertises that it will not accept<br>
databurst broadcast registrations). If the base station does not reject the databurst<br>
broadcast registration message transmitted on the second channel 332, the timer<br>
232 is reset 322 and processing returns to await detection of one of the<br>
predetermined events 302, 304, 306, a request to establish a second channel 312 or<br>
completion of the broadcast signals on the broadcast channel 316. If the base<br>
station rejects the databurst broadcast registration message transmitted on the<br>
second channel 332 or if the base station advertises that it will not accept databurst<br>
broadcast registrations, the databurst reject flag is set 334; and the portable<br>
communication device is asynchronously registered with the base station.<br>
Asynchronous registration is utilized when the databurst reject flag is set<br>
324, 334. First, the controller 212 freezes 336 the channel signal power controller<br>
240. Then, the controller 212 signals the channel selector 236 to switch (i.e., slew)<br>
the transmitter circuitry 208 from the second channel to the broadcast reverse link<br>
access channel 338. Next, the controller 212 provides an asynchronous registration<br>
message to the transmitter circuitry 208 for transmission on the reverse link access<br>
14<br>
WO 2007/027309 PCT/US2006/027846<br>
channel 340 after which the controller 212 signals the channel selector 236 to slew<br>
the transmitter circuitry from the reverse link access channel back to the second<br>
channel 342. The controller 212 then restarts 344 the channel signal power<br>
controller 240. The power control may be restarted at the level it was frozen at, at<br>
an average level over a time period such as 20mS, or one of these levels plus an<br>
offset, such as 5dB. Asynchronous registration from step 336 to step 344 in<br>
accordance with the present invention takes less than two seconds and is barely<br>
noticeable to the user on the second channel.<br>

A method and apparatus is<br>
provided for simultaneously accessing a broadcast<br>
channel which allows for maintaining registration<br>
on the broadcast channel and a second channel.<br>
The broadcast channel includes a reverse link<br>
access channel for a portable communication<br>
device (120) to send registration messages to<br>
a base station and the method initially includes<br>
the step of determining whether a predetermined<br>
event requiring registration of the portable<br>
communication device on the broadcast channel<br>
has been detected (302, 304, 306). After<br>
detecting the predetermined event, it is determined<br>
whether the portable communication device is<br>
communicating on the second channel (308).<br>
If not communicating on the second channel<br>
(308), registration on the broadcast channel<br>
is accomplished by transmitting a registration<br>
message on the reverse link access channel (320).<br>
If communicating on the second channel (308),<br>
the registration message is transmitted on the<br>
broadcast channel asynchronously (340) or, if<br>
supported by the base station (110), as a databurst<br>
of a packet of information on the second channel<br>
(330).</td>
