				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a hermetic motor-driving type compressor,<br>
and in particular to a head cover structure of a hermetic motor-driving type<br>
compressor which is capable of preventing leakage of a refrigerant gas at a high-<br>
pressure side and a low-pressure side and precisely combining a suction muffler to<br>
a head cover with reduced production costs.<br>
2. Description of the Prior Art<br>
Generally, a compressor pressurizes a fluid such as air and a refrigerant<br>
gas, etc. A compressor includes a driving unit placed inside a closed container and<br>
generating a driving force and a compressing unit being transmitted the driving<br>
force from the driving unit, sucking and compressing a refrigerant gas. In the<br>
compressor, when a driving force is generated in the driving unit by being applied<br>
power, the driving force is transmitted to the compressing unit, the compressing<br>
unit sucks a gas, compresses and discharges it.<br>
In addition, a head cover structure used for the conventional hermetic<br>
motor-driving type compressor is divided into a high-pressure side and a low-<br>
pressure side in which a working fluid flows by an enclosure wall, and a suction<br>
muffler is installed at the low-pressure side.<br>
As depicted in Figure 1, a general hermetic motor-driving type compressor<br>
includes a closed container 1 formed by combination of an upper container 1a and<br>
a lower container 1b, and a motor driving unit and a compressing unit are formed<br>
inside the closed container 1.<br>
The driving unit includes a stator 3, a plurality of springs 2s fixedly<br>
combined between the stator 3 and the bottom surface of the closed container 1<br>
and elastically supporting the stator 3, and a rotator 4 placed so as to have a<br>
certain distance from the stator 3.<br>
In the meantime, the compressing unit includes a hollow crank shaft 5<br>
inserted-combined to the center of the rotator 4, a frame 2 combined between the<br>
upper portion of the crank shaft 5 and the upper inner circumference of the rotator<br>
4, a balance weight 5c combined to the end of the crank shaft 5, an eccentric pin<br>
5b installed at the upper surface of the balance weight 5c, a connecting rod 8<br>
combined to a piston 7 slide-inserted into a cylinder 6 formed at the upper surface<br>
of the frame 2 and converting a rotation motion of the crank shaft 5 into a linear<br>
motion of the piston 7, a valve assembly 9 combined so as to cover a certain<br>
surface of the cylinder 6, and a head cover 10 combined to the valve assembly 9.<br>
In the meantime, a piece 5e is inserted into the lower portion of the hollow<br>
crank shaft 5 in order to suck up oil L from the lower surface of the closed<br>
container 1, the sucked oil L is scattered in all internal spaces of the compressor<br>
through an oil channel 5a connected from the upper portion of the piece 5e to the<br>
internal space of the eccentric pin 5b.<br>
And, the working fluid is supplied to a compressing chamber 6" of the<br>
cylinder 6 through a certain side of the head cover 10, a certain side of a suction<br>
muffler 11 reducing noise in suction is combined to the head cover 10, and the<br>
other side of the suction muffler 11 is connected to a suction pipe 12 suctioning the<br>
working fluid and a discharge pipe 13 discharging the compressed working fluid.<br>
Moreover, the suction muffler 11 is made of a plastic material.<br>
Hereinafter, the head cover structure of the conventional hermetic motor-<br>
driving type compressor will be described with reference to accompanying Figure<br>
2.<br>
As depicted in Figure 2, by an enclosure wall 10p, the internal space of the<br>
head cover 10 is divided into a lower pressure part 10b sucking a low-pressure<br>
working fluid by being mounted the suction muffler 11 and a high-pressure part 10t<br>
discharging the working fluid compressed in the compressing chamber 6".<br>
And, a gasket 13 and a valve plate 14 of the valve assembly 9 are orderly<br>
combined between the head cover 10 and the cylinder 6. In addition, the gasket 13<br>
prevents leakage of the working fluid between the head cover 10 and the valve<br>
plate 14, particularly it prevents the leakage of the working fluid between portions<br>
corresponded to the upper surface 10q of the enclosure wall 10p and the valve<br>
plate 14.<br>
Hereinafter, the operations of the conventional hermetic motor-driving type<br>
compressor and the head cover will be described.<br>
In the conventional hermetic motor-driving type compressor, when power<br>
is applied, the rotator 4 rotates by the electromagnetic interaction between the<br>
rotator 4 and the stator 3, and the crank shaft 5 constructed so as to be one-<br>
bodied with the rotator 4 also rotates.<br>
By the operation, the eccentric pin 5b formed to be offset from a center of<br>
rotation of the crank shaft 5 performs the rotation circle motion, the connecting rod<br>
8 connected to the eccentric pin 5b works together, and the piston 7 performs a<br>
linear reciprocating motion.<br>
By the linear reciprocating motion of the piston 7, the working fluid is<br>
compressed at the compressing chamber 6" of the cylinder 6, the compressed<br>
working fluid is discharged from the compressing chamber 6", passes the valve<br>
plate 14 and reaches the high-pressure side 10t of the head cover 10. And, the<br>
working fluid reached the high-pressure side passes an additional discharge path<br>
(not shown) and a discharge noise reducing structure (not shown) and is<br>
discharged outside through the discharge pipe 13.<br>
In the meantime, a low-pressure working fluid passes the suction muffler<br>
11 through the suction pipe 12, reaches the valve plate 14 and flow into the<br>
compressing chamber 6" by the control of the valve plate 14.<br>
However, the head cover structure of the hermetic motor-driving type<br>
compressor in accordance with the prior art has below problems.<br>
The head cover 10 is injection-molded out of aluminum or is cast, when<br>
the head cover 10 is molded out of aluminum, a productivity may be lowered due<br>
to the cost of materials, when the head cover 10 is cast, because a precise<br>
additional process for a flat surface 10a of the head cover 10 is required, the<br>
production cost may be increased.<br>
In addition, in the injection molding of the head cover 10, a bent is<br>
generated at the flat surface 10a due to the head distortion caused by a non-<br>
uniform cooling. Accordingly, there is a gap between the head cover 10 and the<br>
valve plate 14, the leakage of the working fluid occurs by the pressure difference<br>
between the high-pressure side 10t and the low-pressure side 10b of the head<br>
cover 10, it may cause an efficiency reducing problem and abnormal operation of<br>
the compressor.<br>
And, when the leakage of the working fluid occurs at the head cover 10,<br>
because the suction muffler 11 made of the plastic material melts with the<br>
influence of the high temperature-high-pressure working fluid transmitted from the<br>
high-pressure side 10t or the gasket 13 bursts, it may cause the trouble of the<br>
compressor.<br>
In the meantime, in the injection-molding or casting of the head cover 10,<br>
because a burr occurs at the external boundary surface, an interference occurs in<br>
the combination of the suction muffler 11 and the lower pressure side 10b of the<br>
head cover 10.<br>
And, a height of the head cover 10 is different from a mounting height of<br>
the suction muffler 11, when the head cover 10 mounted the suction muffler 11 is<br>
installed to the cylinder 6, a gap occurs between the head cover 10 and the<br>
suction muffler 11, accordingly the leakage of the working fluid may occur.<br>
In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, the mold of the head<br>
cover has to be modified or has to be made newly, accordingly, an enormous<br>
expense loss may occur.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

invention to provide a head cover structure for a hermetic motor-driving type<br>
compressor, which is capable of reducing the cost of materials.<br>

It is still another object of the present invention to provide a head cover<br>
structure of a hermetic motor-driving type compressor which is capable of<br>
preventing interference due to a burr in installation of a suction muffler to a head<br>
cover and modifying easily a mounting height in installation of the head cover to a<br>
cylinder.<br>
In order to achieve the above-mentioned objects, the present invention<br>
provides a cylinder head cover structure of a hermetic motor-driving type<br>
compressor, comprising a front head cover having a low-pressure side through<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Hereinafter, the preferred embodiments of a head cover structure of a<br>
hermetic motor-driving compressor in accordance with the present invention will<br>
be described with reference to accompanying drawings. Herein, construction parts<br>
same with the conventional art will be given the same reference numerals, and<br>
explanation those parts will be abridged.<br>
As depicted in Figure 3, in a head cover structure of a hermetic motor-<br>
driving type compressor in accordance with the present invention, in order to form<br>
a head cover 50, a front head cover 30 is combined to a rear head cover 40 by<br>
brazing welding.<br>
And, in the head cover 50, a through hole 35 for bolt insertion is<br>
respectively formed at the front head cover 30 and the rear head cover 40 in order<br>
to be fastened to a cylinder 6.<br>
In addition, an engaging part 21a is formed at the front end of a suction<br>
muffler 21 inserted into an engaging groove 30r of the head cover 50, and a<br>
protrusion portion 21b for insertion installation is formed at both sides of the<br>
engaging part 21a.<br>
Hereinafter, the structure of the front head cover 30 and the rear head<br>
cover 40 will be described in detail.<br>
As depicted in Figure 4A, the front head cover 30 includes a high-pressure<br>
side 30t in which the compressed refrigerant flows, a low-pressure side 30b in<br>
which the engaging part 21a of the suction muffler 21 is placed, and an enclosure<br>
wall 30p dividing them.<br>
As depicted in Figure 4B, the high-pressure side 30t and the low-pressure<br>
side 30b are punched, and the engaging groove 30r is formed at the low-pressure<br>
side 30b in order to be inserted by the protrusion portion 21b formed at the<br>
engaging part 21a of the suction muffler 21. And, an engaging groove protrusion<br>
portion 30s is formed at the inner circumference of the engaging groove 30r to be<br>
corresponded to the shape of the protrusion portion 21b formed at the suction<br>
muffler 21.<br>
And, the front head cover 30 is made of a steel plate by a press process, a<br>
flatness of the flat surface 30a formed at the front head cover 30 can be improved<br>
in comparison with the conventional art, and the cost of materials can be reduced<br>
by using a steel material cheaper than aluminum.<br>
In the meantime, as depicted in Figure 5A, the rear head cover 40<br>
combined to the front head cover 30 by a brazing welding is made of a steel plate<br>
by a press process, and includes a low-pressure side 40b in which the suction<br>
muffler 21 is installed and the high-pressure side 40t in which the compressed<br>
working fluid flows.<br>
In additon, as depicted in Figure 5B, the rear surface of the high-pressure<br>
side 40t is convexly formed, and the low-pressure side 40b is punched. In the<br>
meantime, the enclosure wall 40p is formed between the low-pressure side 40b<br>
and the high-pressure side 40t in order to prevent mixing of the working fluid.<br>
In addition, an engaging flat portion 40f is formed around the low-pressure<br>
side 40b in order to fix tightly the front surface of the inserted suction muffler 50 to<br>
the cylinder when the suction muffler 21 is installed to the cylinder after being<br>
assembled to the head cover 50.<br>
Hereinafter, the assembly of the head cover structure of the hermetic<br>
motor-driving type compressor in accordance with the present invention will be<br>
described in more detail.<br>
First, as described above, the front head cover 30 is combined to the rear<br>
head cover 40 by the brazing welding. After, the suction muffler 21 is inserted into<br>
the front head cover 30 from the top to the bottom. It is possible to insert the<br>
suction muffler 21 by fabricating it with a plastic material.<br>
And, in the insertion, the protrusion portion 21b formed at the engaging<br>
part 21a of the suction muffler 21 is in gear with the protrusion portion 30s of the<br>
engaging groove 30r formed at the front head cover 30, and the rear surface of the<br>
suction muffler 21 is contacted to the engaging flat part 40f formed at the front<br>
surface of the rear head cover 40.<br>
And, by contacting to the flat surface 30a of the front head cover 30, the<br>
leakage of the working fluid can be prevented, and the gasket 13 and the valve<br>
plate 14 for adjusting flow of the working fluid are placed between the head cover<br>
50a and the cylinder 6.<br>
Next, a fastening means such as a bolt, etc. penetrates the through hole<br>
35 formed at the head cover 50, the gasket 13 and the valve plate 14 and is<br>
combined to a corresponded engaging hole (not shown) of the cylinder 6.<br>
Hereinafter, the operation and effect of the head cover structure of the<br>
hermetic motor-driving type compressor in accordance with the present invention<br>
will be described.<br>
First, when the compressor operates, the rotation motion of the crankshaft<br>
5 is converted into the linearly reciprocating motion of the piston 7 by the<br>
connecting rod 8.<br>
When the working fluid is compressed by the piston 7, the working fluid is<br>
transmitted to the high-pressure side 30t of the head cover 50 through a discharge<br>
valve (not shown).<br>
After, the working fluid transmitted to the high-pressure side 30t of the<br>
head cover 50 passes an additional discharge channel (not shown) and a<br>
discharge noise reducing structure (not shown) and is discharged outside through<br>
the discharge pipe 13.<br>
In the meantime, a low-pressure working fluid passes the suction muffler<br>
11 through the suction pipe 12, reaches the valve plate 14 and flows into the<br>
compressing chamber 6" by the control of the valve plate 14.<br>
Accordingly, in the head cover structure of the hermetic motor-driving type<br>
compressor, the head cover 50 is constructed with two plates, the front head cover<br>
30 and the rear head cover 40 are made of steel plates by the press process, the<br>
cost of materials is reduced in the comparison with the conventional aluminum<br>
injection-molding process.<br>
And, the flatness of the flat surface 30a formed at the front head cover 30<br>
contacting to the gasket 13 is improved, a leakage of the working fluid and the<br>
damage of the suction muffler 21 due to the leakage of the working fluid can be<br>
prevented.<br>
In addition, because the front head cover 30 is made of the steel plate by<br>
the press process, a burr does not be formed at the exterior of a product,<br>
accordingly the assembly of the suction muffler 21 can be performed easily.<br>
And, in installation of the suction muffler 21 to the head cover 50, when the<br>
height is different each other, the head cover 50 has to be modified, herein the<br>
installation height can be easily adjusted by changing a thickness of a steel plate<br>
for fabricating the front head cover 30 or changing the position of the protrusion<br>
portion 30s of the engaging groove formed at the front head cover 30.<br>
In addition, by the installation height adjustment structure, in installation of<br>
the suction muffler 21 to the cylinder 6, a leakage occurrence of the working fluid<br>
can be easily prevented, and the installation of the suction muffler 21 can be easily<br>
performed.<br>
Moreover, in comparison with modification or re-manufacture of a mold in<br>
the conventional injection-molding, the production cost can be drastically reduced.<br>
As described above, in the head cover structure of the hermetic motor-<br>
driving type compressor in accordance with the present invention, the cost of<br>
materials can be reduced. In addition, a reliability of product can be improved by<br>
preventing leakage of a working fluid at a head cover.<br>
In addition, in the head cover structure of the hermetic motor-driving type<br>
compressor in accordance with the present invention, because a suction muffler<br>
can be precisely installed to a cylinder, an installation height can be easily<br>
modified, accordingly a reliability and a productivity of a product can be improved.<br>
