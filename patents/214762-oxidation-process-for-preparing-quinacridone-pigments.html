				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of quinacridone pigments by oxidation of the corresponding 6,13-dihydroquinacridone using hydrogen peroxide as oxidant.<br>
Quinacridone pigments are known for their attractive red and magenta colors and for their outstanding fastness properties. It is well known in the art to prepare quinacridone pigments by oxidizing the correspondingly substituted 6,13-dihydroquinacridone.<br>
For example, numerous publications disclose the oxidation of a 6,13-dihydroquinacridone to the corresponding quinacridone using aromatic nitro compounds as the oxidizing agent in an alcoholic medium containing a base and a small amount of water. However, such processes have the disadvantage of producing considerable organic waste due to the generation of reduced aromatic by-products.<br>
It is also known to oxidize a 6,13-dihydroquinacridone to the corresponding quinacridone by a process wherein the 6,13-dihydroquinacridone is oxidized in a solvent and/or aqueous basic system with an oxygen-containing gas. Such processes are often referred to as "air oxidation" because air is conveniently used as the oxygen-containing gas. Air oxidation processes have the disadvantage that large gas volumes have to be introduced into a heterogeneous reaction mixture, whereby foam is generated. Additionally, it is difficult to determine when the reaction is complete.<br>
Furthermore, it is known to oxidize 6,13-dihydroquinacridones dissolved in polar solvents, for example DMSO, using air as the oxidizing agent. Such processes have the advantage of generating excellent quinacridone pigments in a high yield. However, they have the disadvantage of producing a substantial amount of organic waste, such as dimethylsulfone, as by-product during the oxidation reaction, which requires costly solvent regeneration systems.<br>
The present invention is based on the discovery that the salts of the unsubstituted or substituted dihydroquinacridone(s) are easily oxidized in the presence of a quinone catalyst<br><br>
as a slurry in a basic liquid phase at elevated temperatures using hydrogen peroxide as oxidant.<br>
The inventive process offers the advantage of obtaining the quinacridone product in high yield, substantially free of the starting material. In addition, the crystal modification of the quinacridone product is controlled by the reaction conditions.<br>
The use of hydrogen peroxide as oxidant is additionally advantageous in that it has a high oxidation efficiency at ambient pressure, is readily available and does not generate a reduced organic by-product, as it is the case, for example, with organic nitro compound oxidants. Additionally, if properly selected, the liquid phase can be regenerated by conventional techniques. Thus, the inventive process is valuable in that it provides an economical and environmentally friendly route to produce high performance quinacridone pigments in high yield.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a quinacridone of the formula I<br>
(Formula Removed) <br><br><br>
wherein X and Y are independently 1 or 2 substituents selected from the group consisting of H, F, Cl, C1-C3alkyl and C1-C3alkoxy, by the oxidation of a salt of the corresponding 6,13-dihydroquinacridone of the formula II<br>
(Formula Removed) <br><br><br>
which comprises an oxidation step wherein the 6,13-dihydroquinacridone salt is oxidized with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a catalyst.<br>
C1-C3alkyl stands for methyl, ethyl, n- and i-propyl, preferably is methyl.<br>
C1-C3 s alkoxy stands for methoxy, ethoxy, n- and i-propoxy, preferably methoxy.<br>
Preferably, the positions 2 and 9 of the quinacridones of the formula I and II are substituted.<br>
Generally, the salt of the 6,13-dihydroquinacridone of formula II is a mono and/or di-alkali metal salt. Di-alkali metal salts are preferred. Most preferred are the disodium and/or dipotassium salts.<br>
The 6,13-dihydroquinacridone salt is prepared, for example, by stirring the 6,13-dihydroquinacridone in a basic medium, for example a basic mixture of water and alcohol, at a temperature above 30 2C, preferably 40 to 60 9C, and most preferably between 50 9C and the corresponding reflux temperature, for 5 minutes to 2 1/2 hours, preferably 20 minutes to 11/2 hours.<br>
Generally, the oxidation is carried out in a reaction medium obtained by combining a slurry which consists essentially of the 6,13 dihydroquinacridone salt, the catalyst, a base and a suitable liquid phase, with an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide.<br>
In general, a suitable liquid phase is any liquid media which promotes the oxidation reaction, and which does not react to a significant extent with the hydrogen peroxide oxidizing agent.<br>
Commonly, the liquid phase is a mixture of a lower alcohol and water which contains 20 to 750 parts, preferably 40 to 600 parts of water, and 50 to 750 parts, preferably 100 to 600 parts, of alcohol per 100 parts 6,13-dihydroquinacridone; parts being parts by weight.<br>
The alcohol is generally a lower alcohol, for example, a C1-C3 alkanol, preferably methanol. The reaction medium is preferably substantially free of other organic solvents. However, organic solvents are tolerated in the reaction medium as long as they do not impair the 6,13-dihydroquinacridone salt generation or the oxidation reaction.<br><br>
Any base capable of forming the salt of the 6,13-dihydroquinacridone is useful in the reaction medium. Preferably, the base is an alkali metal hydroxide, most preferably sodium or potassium hydroxide. In certain instances, it is advantageous to use a mixture of sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide.<br>
The molar ratio of the base to 6,13-dihydroquinacridone is typically from 1 to 7 moles of base per mole of the 6,13-dihydroquinacridone. Preferably, the reaction medium contains 2.2 to 5 moles of base per mole of the 6,13-dihydroquinacridone.<br>
The generation of the 6,13-dihydroquinacridone salt is observable under the light microscope by the formation of crystals of the 6,13-dihydroquinacridone salt. Depending on the reaction conditions, the kind of base and/or the substituents on 6,13-dihydroquinacridone, the salt is generally in the form of needles, prisms, cubes or more platelet in form.<br>
For safety reasons and to avoid potential side reactions as well as for a more controllable process, the oxidation reaction is preferably carried out under an inert gas flow, for example nitrogen flow.<br>
In an optimized process, the oxidation is carried out by combining an aqueous solution of the hydrogen peroxide oxidant with a slurry of the 6,13-dihydroquinacridone in a basic mixture of aqueous alcohol and base over a time interval of from 5 minutes to 6 hours, preferably over 30 minutes to 3 Vz hours, and subsequently maintaining the reaction medium at an elevated temperature with stirring for a period of time to complete the oxidation and promote pigment recrystallization. Preferably, the reaction medium is maintained at a temperature above 50 5C, preferably at reflux temperature for from 5 minutes to 5 hours, preferably 30 minutes to 4 hours, after the addition of the hydrogen peroxide. The pigment is then isolated by filtration, washing with alcohol followed by hot water and drying. The base and the alcohol can be easily regenerated from the filtrate.<br>
The aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide generally contains from 1 to 50 weight-percent, preferably 5 to 30 weight-percent, and most preferably 10 to 25 weight-percent, of hydrogen peroxide. Thus, preferably the oxidation step is carried out by combining a 1 to 50 percent<br><br>
by weight aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide with a slurry consisting essentially of the 6,13-dihydroquinacridone, the catalyst, the base and the liquid phase.<br>
The oxidation of the 6,13-dihydroquinacridone salt to the corresponding quinacridone by hydrogen peroxide is visually followed by the color change of the reaction mixture. In general, a small excess of the hydrogen peroxide is used. The molar ratio of hydrogen peroxide to 6,13-dihydroquinacridone is, for example, 1.1 to 5 moles, preferably 1.2 to 3.5 moles, of hydrogen peroxide per mole of the 6,13-dihydroquinacridone.<br>
The presence of an oxidation-promoting amount of the catalyst during the oxidation step leads to a higher yield of quinacridone. Additionally, the presence of the catalyst under the oxidation conditions described above, results in a quinacridone product that is substantially free of quinacridonequinone, for example containing less than 2.5 percent by weight of quinacridonequinone. However, minor amounts of quinacridonequinone are tolerated in the product as long as its presence does not substantially reduce the saturation of the final quinacridone pigment.<br>
Any compound capable of catalyzing the oxidation of 6,13-dihydroquinacridone under the present reaction conditions can be utilized as the catalyst. Particularly suitable catalysts used in the inventive process are, for example, the quinone compounds used for the air oxidation of 6,13-dihydroquinacridone to quinacridone. Such quinone catalysts are well-known in the art. In particular, suitable catalysts include anthraquinone compounds, especially anthraquinone, and anthraquinone sulfonic acid derivatives, such as anthraquinone monosulfonic acid and anthraquinone disulfonic acid like anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonic acid or preferably anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid, or salts thereof, in particular the sodium or potassium salts, especially anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid, sodium or potassium salt. The quinone catalyst is present in the reaction medium in an amount effective to catalyze the oxidation reaction, for example from 0.005 to 0.1 times the weight of 6,13-dihydroquinacridone, and most preferably 0.01 to 0.05 times the weight of 6,13-dihydroquinacridone.<br>
Without limiting this invention to any particular theory, it is believed that the quinone catalyst acts to oxidize the 6,13-dihydroquinacridone and is itself reduced to the corresponding leuco compound, which is then regenerated by the hydrogen peroxide.<br><br>
Depending on the composition of the liquid phase, the recrystallization time and temperature, transparent smaller particle size or opaque larger particle size quinacridone pigments are generated. Lower temperatures and shorter times favor a transparent product, while higher temperatures and longer times favor a more opaque product. Additionally, it is advantageous to add a particle growth inhibitor before or after the 6,13-dihydroquinacridone salt generation to control the pigment particle size of the oxidized quinacridone pigment. Particle growth inhibitors, also known as antifloculating or rheology-improving agents, are well known. Suitable particle growth inhibitors include, for example, phthalimidomethylquinacridone, imidazolylmethylquinacridone,<br>
pyrazolylmethylquinacridone, quinacridone sulfonic acid, esp. quiacridone monosulfonic acid, and its salts, for example the aluminum salt, or 1,4-diketo-3,6-diphenylpyrrolo[3,4-cjpyrrole sulfonic acid and its salts.<br>
For achieving an optimum effect, the particle growth inhibitor is added in an amount of 0.05 to 10 %, preferably 0.05 to 8 %, more preferably from 0.1 to 5 % based on 6,13-dihydroquinacridone, prior to oxidation, preferably before the 6,13-dihydroquinacridone salt generation.<br>
The instant process is especially useful for the preparation of quinacridone, 2,9-dichloroquinacridone, 2,9-difluoroquinacridone, 4,11-dichloroquinacridone, 2,9-dimethyl-quinacridone and 2,9-dimethoxyquinacridone.<br>
Additionally, the process is also suitable for the preparation of solid solutions containing one or more quinacridone components. Thus, an aspect of this invention relates to the process wherein the quinacridone pigment is a quinacridone pigment solid solution, preferably a mixture containing two or more 6,13-dihydroquinacridones of formula II which are co-oxidized by the inventive process to yield a quinacridone solid solution product.<br>
The process of this invention is particularly practical for the preparation of quinacridone/2,9-dichloroquinacridone, quinacridone/2,9-dimethylquinacridone, quinacridone/2,9-dimethoxyquinacridone, 2,9-dichloroquinacridone/2,9-dimethylquinacridone, 2,9-dichloroquinacridone/2,9-dimethoxyquinacridoneor2,9-dimethylquinacridone/2,9-dimethoxyquinacridone solid solution pigments.<br><br>
Since the 6,13-dihydroquinacridone salt generation and the oxidation reaction are advantageously carried out sequentially in the same container, practically no handling losses occur. Thus, the process according to this invention provides a quinacridone product in a high yield.<br>
Additionally, the inventive process selectively oxidizes the 6,13-dihydroquinacridone to the corresponding quinacridone easily. The end product normally contains less than 2.5 % of the unreacted 6,13-dihydroquinacridone and less than 2.0 % of the over oxidized quinacridonequinone. Typically, at least 96 %, usually 97.5 % and above, of the dihydroquinacridone is converted to the corresponding quinacridone.<br>
Despite of being carried out in a heterogeneous reaction medium, the inventive process provides quinacridone pigments with a narrow particle size distribution. Thus, due to their high purity and desirable narrow particle size distribution, the obtained quinacridone pigments manifest outstanding pigment properties, such as, for example, a high chroma.<br>
The process of this invention is particularly suitable for the preparation of specific crystal modifications of the unsubstituted or substituted quinacridones, for example, the alpha, beta or gamma form of the unsubstituted quinacridone, wherein preferably said gamma form is a gamma-l, gamma-ll or gamma-Ill form of unsubstituted quinacridone, the beta form of 2,9-dimethylquinacridone and the alpha and/or gamma form of 2,9-dichloroquinacridone.<br>
Different crystal forms of the quinacridone product are generated depending the reaction conditions used, such as, for example, the kind and concentration of base and the composition of the liquid phase, and the kind and concentration of particle growth inhibitors which may be present during the oxidation step. Additionally, the crystal modification of the quinacridone product is controlled by adding from about 1 to 10 percent of seed crystals of quinacridone pigment having the desirable crystal modification. The seed crystals are added preferably prior to the oxidation, most preferably prior to salt formation.<br>
Depending on the end use, it may be advantageous to add texture improving agents and/or rheology improving agents, for example before the isolation of the pigment, preferably by blending into the aqueous presscake. Suitable texture improving agents are, in particular, fatty acids of not less than 18 carbon atoms, for example stearic or behenic acid or the<br><br>
amides or metal salts thereof, preferably calcium or magnesium salts, as well as plasticizers, waxes, resin acids such as abietic acid or metal salts thereof, colophonium, alkyl phenols or aliphatic alcohols such as stearyl alcohol or vicinal diols such as dodecanediol-1,2, and also modified colophonium/maleate resins or fumaric acid/colophonium resins or polymeric dispersants. The texture improving agents are preferably added in amounts of 0.1 to 30% by weight, most preferably of 2 to 15% by weight, based on the final product.<br>
Suitable rheology improving agents are for example the above mentioned antiflocculating agents, which are added preferably in amounts of 2 to 10 % by weight, most preferably of 3 to 8 % by weight, based on the final product.<br>
The present quinacridone and quinacridone solid solution pigments are suitable as coloring matter for inorganic or organic substrates. They are highly suitable for coloring high molecular weight materials, which can be processed to casted and molded articles or which are used in ink and coating compositions such as solvent or water based coatings, for example in automotive coatings.<br>
Suitable high molecular weight organic materials include thermoplastics, thermoset plastics or elastomers, for example, cellulose ethers; cellulose esters such as ethyl cellulose; linear or crosslinked polyurethanes; linear, crosslinked or unsaturated polyesters; polycarbonates; polyolefins such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutylene or poly-4-methylpent-1-ene; polystyrene; polysulfones; polyamides; polycycloamides; polyimides; polyethers; polyether ketones such as polyphenylene oxides; and also poly-p-xylene; polyvinyl halides such as polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, polyvinylidene fluoride or polytetrafluoroethylene; acrylic polymers such as polyacrylates, polymethacrylates or polyacrylonitrile; rubber; silicone polymers; phenol/formaldehyde resins; melamine/formaldehyde resins; urea/formaldehyde resins; epoxy resins; styrene butadiene rubber; acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber or chloroprene rubber; singly or in mixtures.<br>
Generally, the pigments are used in an effective pigmenting amount, for example, of 0.01 to 30% by weight, preferably 0.1 to 10% by weight, based on the weight of the high molecular weight organic material to be pigmented. Thus, the present invention also relates to a pigmented plastic composition which comprises a plastic material and an effective<br><br>
pigmenting amount of pigment or pigment solid solution prepared according to a process of the present invention, and to a process for preparing said pigmented plastic compositions.<br>
The present pigments are easily dispersible and can be readily incorporated into organic matrixes to provide homogenous colorations possessing high saturation and excellent light and weather fastness properties.<br>
The high molecular weight organic materials are pigmented with the pigments of the present invention by mixing the pigments, if desired in the form of a masterbatch, into substrates using high shear techniques including roll mills or a mixing or grinding apparatus. The pigmented material is then brought into the desired final form by known methods, such as calandering, pressing, extruding, brushing, casting or injection molding.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a process for preparing a quinacridone of the formula I<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein X and Y are independently 1 or 2 substituents selected from the group consisting of H, F, Cl, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl and methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, i-propoxy, by the oxidation of a salt of the corresponding 6, 13-dihydroquinacridone of the formula II<br><br>

Analyzed by spectrophotometric method the pigment shows a 2,9-dichloroquinacridone content of 97.5 % with a 2,9-dichloro-6,13-dihydroquinacridone content of less than 2 %. The product has a specific surface area of 18.7 m2/g.<br>
Incorporated in plastics and paints it shows a strong highly saturated magenta color with excellent light and heat stability.<br>
Example 5: The procedure of Example 4 is repeated; however, using 2.2 grams phthalimidomethylquinacridone instead of the quinacridone mono sulfonic acid aluminum salt as particle growth inhibitor and instead of 45 grams 2,9-dichloro-6,13-dihydroquinacridone a mixture of 40.5 grams 2,9-dichloro-6,13-dihydroquinacridone and 4.5 grams 6,13-dihydroquinacridone, and by isolating the resulting pigment suspension after 1 hour reflux time instead of 4 hours yielding a magenta colored pigment. The product shows the x-ray diffraction pattern of a small particle size gamma 2,9-dichloroquinacridone with no peaks of the unsubstituted quinacridone present. Thus, it is a solid solution pigment. The product has a specific surface area of 67.6 m2/g.<br>

Example 8: A one liter flask equipped with a thermometer, stirrer and condenser is charged with 4 grams MONASTRAL Red Y RT-759-D (from Ciba) as gamma II quinacridone seed crystals, 40 grams 6,13-dihydroquinacridone, 250ml methanol and 40.9 grams 50 % aqueous sodium hydroxide. The mixture is stirred under a slow flow of nitrogen at 50 to 55<br>
°C for one hour generating the corresponding 6,13-dihydroquinacridone-di- sodium salt. 0.6 grams anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid sodium salt are added and the mixture is heated to reflux temperature. 73.5 grams of an aqueous 16.9 % hydrogen peroxide solution are added at a rate of 0.4 ml/ minute maintaining reflux temperature under a slow nitrogen flow over 2 hours 40 minutes. The resulting red suspension is further stirred for 1 hour at reflux temperature and then filtered at 50-60eC. The presscake is washed with methanol, followed by hot water and then dried, yielding a gamma II quinacridone as displayed by the x-ray diffraction pattern. The gamma-ll quinacridone is described in U.S. Patent No. 2,844,581.<br>
Example 9: A one liter flask equipped with a thermometer, stirrer and condenser is charged with 40 grams 6,13-dihydroquinacridone, 0.1 grams phthalimidomethylquinacridone, 250 ml methanol and 52.8 grams 50 % aqueous sodium hydroxide. The mixture is stirred under a slow flow of nitrogen at 50 to 55 "C for one hour generating the corresponding 6,13-dihydroquinacridone-di-sodium salt. 0.6 grams anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid sodium salt are added and the mixture is heated to reflux temperature. 73.5 grams of an aqueous 16.9 % hydrogen peroxide solution are added at a rate of 0.4 ml/ minute at reflux temperature under a slow nitrogen flow over 2 hours 40 minutes. The resulting red suspension is further stirred for 1 hour at reflux temperature then filtered at 50-60SC. The presscake is washed with methanol followed by hot water then dried yielding a gamma I quinacridone as displayed by the x-ray diffraction pattern. The gamma-l quinacridone is described in U.S. Patent No. 3,074,950.<br>
Example 10: The procedure of Example 1 is repeated; however, adding 35.8 grams 50 % aqueous sodium hydroxide instead of 52.8 grams, yielding an alpha quinacridone pigment. The pigment shows a bright red masstone color when rubbed out according to ASTM method D-387-60 in a lithographic varnish.<br>
Example 11: A one liter flask equipped with a thermometer, stirrer and condenser is charged with 45 grams 2,9-dimethyl-6,13-dihydroquinacridone, 280 ml methanol and 90 grams 45 % aqueous potassium hydroxide. The mixture is stirred under a slow flow of nitrogen at 50 to 55 °C for one hour generating the corresponding 2,9-dimethyl-6,13-dihydroquinacridone-di- potassium salt. 0.6 grams anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid, sodium salt, are added and the mixture is heated to reflux temperature. 75.5 grams of an aqueous 16.9 % hydrogen peroxide solution are added at a rate of 0.4 ml/ minute maintaining reflux<br>
temperature under a slow nitrogen flow over 2 hours 45 minutes. The resulting red suspension is further stirred for 1 hour at reflux temperature then filtered at 50-609C. The presscake is washed with methanol, followed by hot water and then dried, yielding a beta phase 2,9-dimethylquinacridone crude in a large particle size.<br>
Example 12: 63.0 grams of polyvinylchloride, 3.0 grams epoxidized soya bean oil, 2.0 grams of barium/cadmium heat stabilizer, 32.0 grams dioctyl phthalate and 1.0 gram of the beta quinacridone prepared according to Example 7 are mixed together in a glass beaker using a stirring rod. The mixture is formed into a soft PVC sheet with a thickness of about 0.4 mm by rolling for 8 minutes on a two roll laboratory mill at a temperature of 160°C, a roller speed of 25 rpm and friction of 1:1.2 by constant folding, removal and feeding. The resulting soft PVC sheet is colored in an attractive violet shade with excellent fastness to heat, light and migration.<br>
Example 13: Five grams of the magenta 2,9-dichloroquinacridone pigment prepared according to Example 4, 2.5 grams hindered amine light stabilizer, 1.0 gram benzotriazole UV absorber, 1.0 gram hindered phenol antioxidant and 1.0 gram phosphite process stabilizer are mixed together with 1000 grams of high density polyethylene at a speed of 175-200 rpm for 30 seconds after flux. The fluxed pigmented resin is chopped up while warm and malleable, and then fed through a granulator. The resulting granules are molded on an injection molder with a 5 minute dwell time and a 30 second cycle time at temperatures of 260°C. Homogeneously colored chips which show a bright magenta color with excellent light stability are obtained.<br>
Example 14: Six grams of a 2,9-dichloroquinacridone pigment prepared according to Example 3, 9 grams hindered amine light stabilizer, 3 grams benzotriazole UV absorber, and 3 grams hindered phenol antioxidant are mixed together with 1200 grams ABS resin at a speed of 175-200 rpm for 30 seconds after flux. The fluxed pigmented resin is chopped up while warm and malleable, and then fed through a granulator. The resulting granules are molded on a injection molder with a 7 minute dwell time and a 42-second cycle time at temperatures of 232°C (450°F) and 288°C (550°F) respectively. Homogeneously colored chips which show similar magenta color shades at each of the temperature steps are obtained.<br>
Example 15: Preparation of Automotive Paint<br>
millbase formulation:<br>
