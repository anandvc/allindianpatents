This invention relates to an implement lOR climbing on tall trees safely and easily in all climates by all people of all age groups. Until now the common methods of climbing on trees made a man tired and weary and also is not safe <br>
It is the object of the invention to invent an instrument which is safe.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a device with is sturdy and cheap.<br>
It is another object of the invention to contrive a device which is easy to operate.<br>
The implement according to this invention consists of two metal loops of 10 m.m MS Rod having sub loops and other components such as rubber belt, wire ropes, connecting clamp, M.S. plate etc. One loop is intended for right leg and other for left leg. These are called right leg loop and left leg loop respectively. Except some difference both loops are indentical.<br>
According to the invention an implement to climbing on tall trees comprises a pair of metallic loops each having a main loop and sub - loop. The top of the main loop being bent forward to form handle and just below this portion two metal plates having holes and on it a king rubber belt is attached. On rubber belt a wire rope having rings on each end is fixed. The bottom most part is a plate and above it s distance clamp is provided. A long holed plate is fixed on main loop for the use as a Parking Brake.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an implement for climbing on tall trees comprising a pair of identical metallic loops, each said loop having a main loop and sub loops, the top of the main loop being bent forward to Ibrm a handle and having attached thereto a belt carrying a wire rope, having rings at each end, the two limbs of the main loop being inter connected by belt fixing mechanism and distance clamp, the sub loop having connecting clamp and pedal and hook and looking mechanism for attaching wire rope, ring on flexible cord which enables the belt to tighten or loose according the weight applied to the sub loop and a pedal being provided in the sub loop having plastic mat and belt to hold the foot firmly.<br>
The invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein :<br>

Fig.     2.        Shows in elevation the left leg loop according to the invention.<br>
Fig.     3.	Shows in elevation sub loop associated with right leg and left leg<br>
4.	according to this invention is amended to right led and left leg<br>
respectively.<br><br>
THE FIGURES REPRESENTS:<br><br>
1.	Main loops<br>
2.	Rubber belt<br>
3.	Oval ring<br>
4.	Metal parts with nuts<br>
5.	Wire rope with ring<br>
6.	Clips on rubber base<br>
7.	Bottom stopper projection<br>
8.	Sub loop<br>
9.	Locking ring<br>
10.	Pedal with belt<br>
11.	Connecting clamp<br>
12.	Locking device with ring<br>
H.	Plate with holes<br>
0.	Divider<br>
P.	Parking Lock<br>
The invention will be described with reference to figures of the accompanying drawings wherein the figure represent the right leg loop of the implement. Right leg loop is having (Fig. Sheet 1) 100 cms. height and fitted with a sub loop of 30 cms. height, whereas the left leg loop (Fig. Sheet 2) is having a height of 115 cms. and its sub loop with 30 cms. in height. The top of the both main loops are bent so as to perform like a Handle which will help the climber to operate the machine easily. Both sub loops (8) are connected to the main loops, one on right leg loop and other on left leg loop, with the help of clippings (11) in the upper and lower parts of sub loops which enables the easy movement of the same through main loops. Though Uie height of the sub loops are the same, say 30 cms., the sub loop of the right teg loop is having addition fittings of (H) plate with holes and locking device with spring. Just below the upper portion of the main loops, rubber belt (2) of 5 cms. width is fixed by threaded clamp and nuts on two<br><br>
metal platen (4) having holes at desired places. Two oval rings (3) are provided on both sided of the main loops adjacent to the rubber belt (2). A wire rope passing through the middie of the rubber belt (2) of about SO cms, m fength at each sides are provided with ring (5). There are one rrietafic clip (6) at each and of the mbbnis- belt. This clips prevent ihe sHpp.ing of the wire rope from desired place/places. The bottom portion of the main ioops has a (7) stopper projection which prevent the sub loop falling down from the main ioop/s. For both sub loops there are locking ring (9) which is used ss a lock of the machine from moving. Apart from it the right leg loop is an addition p3ate with holes (H) and another locking device with ring (12) that makes locking of the machine at the top or middie or any desired position of the tree. At: the bottom of sub loop a pedal (11) is provided so as to keep the legs of the climbers. Further a semi-circle type divider (D) is fitted in the inner side of the right leg loop, which will assist to keep projected the right teg loop from the tree, so that the wire rope can move easily up and down whiie in operation of the machine.<br>
Fot operation, bring die entire unit to the tree on which climbing sl^iould be carried. Connect the left side of the rubber belt and wire rope of the left leg loop to the tree bringing the wire rope through the right side oval rings (3) of the main loop and insert the ring of the wire rope to the left side hook of the sub loop. Further connect the right side rubber belt and wire rope to left side oval ring of main loop and insert the ring of wire rope to the right side hook of sub loop. By the same manner, connect the right leg loop to the tree a little above (about 30 cms.) the left leg loop. Place the operator's foot on respective pedal of the loops and wear the pedal belt. The sub loop gets a downward movement proportionate to the weight of the operator and the rubber belt get close connection with the tree. Then raise the sub loop of the right leg loop to a little, this time the right leg loop have a loose connection only. Then raise the whole right leg Joop for a step using hand and leg. After giving the whole weight of the operator to right leg loop, raise the left leg loop as the same manner of right leg loop. By repeating this operation the operator can reach upto the top of the tree. To stay there, or to continue works there, he can lock the implement at any place he wishes. To lock the machine on tree, pull out the locking device and connect/insert to any one of the hole on the plate with holes. Thus the machine will be locked there and it cannot be moved unless the lock is removed. To get down, please disconnect the lock. Keep the foot on the pedals, allow the whole weight of the operator on one side of the loop and bring other part down. By repeating the same alternatively, as did for climbing, the operator can come down easily.<br><br>
Though the new device weight from 3,8 kgs. Made of fibre, steel or MS Rods, the old one weighs about 12.1 kgs. The climbing with new devices requires only ONE MINUTE, where the old one requires about 12 minutes for climbing as the sub-loop manufacture is entirely different from the present one and th« old one. Further the plastic mat provided for the climber to step his feet in the new device helps very attractive for the user, where the coir mats give him a discomfort. In the new device a tree of having 25 cms, to 2D0 cms. of dia. can be climbed with least comfort, but the by using the old machine the climbing is limited to 50 cms. to 85 cms. At the top of the tree, in the case of new device, the machine can be locked at any desired point, but in the old mechanism it can be done according the holes provided in the locking unit. Only on MS Rods or such like products can be used for the new one, but there shoultl be twip in the old one. The width of frame is 6.5" in the old device, but the same can be made of 4", reduced or enlarged from V4"to 10". The main loops length for the old device is SO", but for the new one k can be reduced from the existing 45" or can be increased according to the condition of the requirement. The handle of the present system is fixed, but In the new device it is tumable, and the length of the belt also can be added oi' reduced whereas In the old one the length of the belt can't be dtanged. In the old device, the belt is made of rubber, but in the new one plastic, steel rope etc. can be used which will not harm the trees. Metal paits in the old machines are fimlly fixed, but in the new one the same can be replaced as and when required. No safe movement of the belt can be guaranteed in ttie old machine, but by using clips, the safe movement is ensured in the new device.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
