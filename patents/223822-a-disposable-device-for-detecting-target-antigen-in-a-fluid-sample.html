				<td>DIRECT IMMUNOSENSOR ASSAY<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a device and method for performing immunoassays.<br>
The device comprises a disposable immunosensor.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Biomedical sensors are used to report the presence and/or concentration of a wide<br>
variety of analytes. When the analyte is a protein, then the sensing element used is usually<br>
an antibody since the interaction of the antibody with the protein (antigen) is very specific.<br>
Such immunoassays usually fall into two categories: a "yes/no answer" obtained, e.g., by<br>
simple visual detection, or a concentration of the antigen determined by a quantitative<br>
method. Most of the quantitative methods involve expensive pieces of equipment such as<br>
scintillation counters (for monitoring radioactivity), spectrophotometers,<br>
spectrofluorimeters {see, e.g., U.S. 5,156,972), surface plasmon resonance instruments (see,<br>
e.g., U.S. 5,965,456), and the like. It would therefore be advantageous to develop a<br>
quantitative immunoassay that is both inexpensive and simple enough to use to be suitable<br>
for home or field use. Such an immunosensor requires no centrifugation, dilution, pipetting,<br>
washing, or timing steps, and generates minimal waste.<br>
Conventional immunoassays are classified into two categories: competition assays<br>
and sandwich assays. In a competition assay, the antigen in the test sample is mixed with<br>
an antigen-probe complex (commonly referred to as a reporter complex) and the mixture<br>
then competes for binding to the antibody. The probe may be a radioisotope, an enzyme, a<br>
fluorophore, or a chromophore. In a sandwich immunoassay, the antigen in the test sample<br>
binds to the antibody and then a second antibody-probe complex binds to the antigen. In<br>
these prior art assay methods, one or more washing steps are usually required. The washing<br>
steps introduce complexity into the assay procedure and can generate biohazardous liquid<br>
waste. It would therefore be advantageous to develop a device for performing an<br>
immunoassay that does not require any washing steps and is suitable for a single use as a<br>
disposable device.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
A quantitative, inexpensive, disposable immunosensor that requires no wash steps<br>
and thus generates no liquid waste is provided. For immunosensors of certain<br>
embodiments, no timing steps are required of the user, and the sensor can be readily<br>
adapted to antigen-antibody interactions over a wide kinetic range. The sensors of the<br>
preferred embodiments have a number of potential advantages. Such sensors may be<br>
simpler to fabricate, as reagents may be deposited in a single step and/or on only one<br>
portion of the reaction chamber or a support contained therein.<br>
The sensors may utilize a pseudo-antigen-probe complex, a modified-antigen-probe<br>
complex, or an antigen-probe complex. The term "pseudo-antigen," as used herein, is a<br>
broad term and is used in its ordinary sense, including, without limitation, antigens other<br>
than the antigen of interest that bind to the immobilized antibody, but not as strongly as the<br>
antigen of interest. The term "modified-antigen," as used herein, is a broad term and is<br>
used in its ordinary sense, including, without limitation, antigens that have been chemically<br>
or otherwise modified such that the modified-antigen binds to the immobilized antibody,<br>
but not as strongly as the antigen of interest. The antigen of the antigen-probe complex,<br>
which may be the same as or different than the antigen of interest, by virtue of being bound<br>
to a probe will bind to the immobilized antibody, but not as strongly as the antigen of<br>
interest, which is in an unbound state. While the preferred embodiments are discussed<br>
primarily in regard to a pseudo-antigen, it is understood that an antigen-probe complex or<br>
modified-antigen may be substituted for a pseudo-antigen.<br>
It may be easier to ensure that the ratio of antibody to antigen-probe, modified-<br>
antigen-probe, or pseudo-antigen-probe in the reaction chamber is correct as this will<br>
essentially occur automatically when the antigen-probe, modified-antigen-probe, or pseudo-<br>
antigen-probe is bound to the antibody during manufacture of the sensor, in contrast to prior<br>
art methods where the correct ratio is typically achieved by controlling reagent lay-down<br>
rates and surface densities. The sensor of preferred embodiments may also be particularly<br>
well suited to slower immuno-reaction kinetics, wherein the binding processes may be<br>
slow. The use of a non-human pseudo-antigen in the manufacture of the sensor may reduce<br>
the likelihood of transmission of communicable diseases when the sensor contacts a drop of<br>
blood on the patient's finger.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
The following description and examples illustrate a preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention in detail. Those of skill in the art will recognize that there are numerous<br>
variations and modifications of this invention that are encompassed by its scope.<br>
Accordingly, the description of a preferred embodiment should not be deemed to limit the<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
A sensor strip is provided that contains two chambers: a reaction chamber and a<br>
detection chamber. A sample is received in the reaction chamber, wherein components of<br>
the sample undergo an immuno-reaction. One or more products of the imrnuno-reaction are<br>
detected in the detection chamber in order to quantitate the antigen present in the sample.<br>
The reaction chamber and detection chamber are arranged such that sample may flow from<br>
the reaction chamber into the detection chamber.<br>
After the immuno-reaction has taken place in the reaction chamber, at least some of<br>
the reacted sample is transferred to the detection chamber, where the presence of a probe is<br>
detected and analyzed to obtain a result. It is preferred that sufficient sample is transferred<br>
such that the detection chamber is sufficiently filled, namely, that sufficient sample is<br>
transferred to the detection chamber such that the presence of a probe may be detected and<br>
analyzed by the detection method employed.<br>
The reaction chamber contains antibodies to the antigen of interest immobilized<br>
within it. The antibodies can be immobilized on a wall of the chamber itself. Alternatively<br>
the antibodies may be immobilized on a support contained within the reaction chamber.<br>
Suitable supports include, but are not limited to, fibrous materials, macroporous materials,<br>
powdered materials, or, in particularly preferred embodiments, beads of a material such as<br>
are commonly known in the art for supporting antibodies.<br>
In the preferred embodiments, the immobilized antibodies are bound to what is<br>
referred to as a "pseudo-antigen" linked to a probe. The pseudo-antigen-probe binds to the<br>
immobilized antibody, but not as strongly as the antigen of interest. If, for example, the<br>
antigen to be detected is a human protein, then a suitable pseudo-antigen-probe may include<br>
an animal version of the same protein, such as a dog protein or a pig protein, linked to the<br>
probe. In this example, antibodies to the human version of the protein are immobilized in<br>
the reaction chamber and the animal version of the protein, linked to a suitable probe, is<br>
bound to the immobilized antibody to form an antibody-pseudo-antigen-probe complex.<br>
When sample fills the reaction chamber, a small fraction of the pseudo-antigen-<br>
probe dissociates into solution, since it is relatively weakly bound to the antibody. A<br>
dynamic equilibrium will exist between bound pseudo-antigen-probe and free pseudo-<br>
antigen-probe, leaving some free antibody binding sites. If there is antigen in the solution,<br>
then it will strongly bind to the free antibody binding sites in preference to the pseudo-<br>
antigen-probe and so leave the pseudo-antigen-probe in solution. This process will<br>
continue until substantially all of the antigen in the sample has bound to the antibodies and<br>
there is an equal amount of pseudo-antigen-probe free in the solution. Thus each antigen<br>
that binds to an immobilized antibody will displace one pseudo-antigen-probe into solution.<br>
When all, or a pre-determined fraction, of the antigen in the sample is bound to the<br>
immobilized antibodies, the concentration of pseudo-antigen-probe in solution reflects the<br>
original concentration of antigen in the sample. In the preferred embodiments, the<br>
equilibrium between free and bound pseudo-antigen-probe is relied upon to ensure that<br>
antigen in solution ends up bound to the antibody in preference to the pseudo-antigen-<br>
probe. Hence, a pseudo-antigen-probe is employed that binds more weakly to the antibody<br>
than the target antigen, but there is no need to physically remove the pseudo-antigen-probe<br>
from the antibody prior to sample introduction, as in certain prior art methods.<br>
After the immuno-reactions have taken place, the liquid sample containing any<br>
pseudo-antigen-probe liberated from the antibodies is transferred to the detection chamber,<br>
hi the detection chamber, the concentration of pseudo-antigen-probe present in the sample<br>
is measured and a result obtained.<br>
A small amount of the pseudo-antigen-probe may dissociate into solution even in<br>
the absence of antigen in the sample, as a result of the bound and free pseudo-antigen-probe<br>
reaching equilibrium in solution. If this occurs, then the signal generated in the detection<br>
 chamber due to this free pseudo-antigen-probe is treated as a background signal, which is<br>
subtracted from the antigen concentration result as part of the analysis procedure.<br>
In copending Application No. 09/616,433 filed July 14, 2000, incorporated herein<br>
by reference in its entirety, an immunoassay strip with a linked immuno-reaction and<br>
detection chamber is described. Unlike the sensor described herein, which employs a<br>
pseudo-antigen-probe initially complexed with an antibody immobilized on a surface<br>
within the reaction chamber, in the sensor of Application No. 09/616,433, prior to the<br>
introduction of sample into the reaction chamber, antibodies are immobilized on one<br>
surface and antigen-probe is immobilized on another surface of the reaction chamber.<br>
When sample is introduced into the reaction chamber, the antigen-probe dissolves into the<br>
solution and competes with antigen in the sample for the antibody sites. The method of<br>
using the sensor of Application No. 09/616,433 relies primarily on kinetic factors to ensure<br>
that the antigen binds to the antibody (by getting there first) in preference to the antigen-<br>
probe. Hence, there is a need to spatially remove the antigen-probe from the antibody in<br>
the reaction chamber, and the sensor can function when the antigen and the antigen-probe<br>
bind with equal strength to the antibody.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the sensor is a single step, no-wash immunosensor. The<br>
sensor is a single use, disposable device that employs a reaction chamber and a detection<br>
chamber. Any suitable detection method can be utilized. Suitable detection methods<br>
include, for example, visual detection wherein the development of a color is observed, or<br>
spectroscopic detection wherein reflected or transmitted light is used to measure changes in<br>
light absorbance. In a preferred embodiment, the detection method is electrochemical,<br>
wherein the electrical current or potential related to the products of immuno-reactions is<br>
measured.<br>
Methods and devices for obtaining electrochemical measurements of fluid samples<br>
are discussed further in copending U.S. patent Application No. 09/616,556, filed on July<br>
14, 2000, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
The timing of the various test stages, i.e., the reaction stage and the detection stage,<br>
may be done manually. Alternatively, timing may be done automatically in response to a<br>
trigger signal generated when the reaction chamber and/or detection chamber is filled.<br>
Embodiments of sensors suitable for use with electrochemical detection are<br>
illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 and in Figures 3 and 4. Figure 1 is a top view of a first<br>
embodiment of a sensor strip and Figure 2 is a cross-sectional view, showing details of the<br>
reaction chamber and the detection chamber. Figure 3 is a top view of a second<br>
embodiment of a sensor strip and Figure 4 is a cross-sectional view, showing details of the<br>
reaction chamber and the detection chamber.<br>
The Sensor<br>
The immunosensors of the present invention may be prepared using well-known<br>
thin layer device fabrication techniques as are used in preparing electrochemical glucose<br>
sensing devices (see, e.g., U.S. 5,942,102, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).<br>
Such techniques, with certain modifications, may also used to prepare immunosensors<br>
utilizing non-electrochemical detection methods.<br>
In the preferred embodiments of the immunosensors illustrated in Figures 1 and 2<br>
and in Figures 3 and 4, the detection chamber comprises an electrochemical cell. The<br>
immunosensors may be prepared by assembling various thin layers of suitably shaped<br>
materials according to thin layer sensor fabrication methods as are well known in the art.<br>
Typically, the fabrication process involves sandwiching one or more spacer layers between<br>
a top layer and a bottom layer.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the sensor 20 is an electrochemical cell 28 utilizing an<br>
enzyme, e.g., glucose oxidase or glucose dehydrogenase, as the probe, as illustrated in<br>
Figure 1, a top view of such a sensor 20, and Figure 2, a cross section of the sensor through<br>
line A-A'. The reaction chamber 22 and detection chamber 28 are prepared by forming an<br>
aperture extending through a sheet of electrically resistive material 36. The aperture is<br>
shaped such that it defines a sidewall of both the reaction chamber 22 and the detection<br>
chamber 28, as well as the sample passageway 38 between the two chambers 22 and 28. By<br>
extending the aperture from the proximal end 24 of the reaction chamber 22 through to the<br>
edge of the sheet 37, the sample ingress 24 is also formed. In one embodiment, the<br>
thickness of the sheet 36 defines the entire height of the reaction chamber 22 and detection<br>
chamber 28, which are the same. In another embodiment, the height of the reaction<br>
chamber 22 is greater than that of the detection chamber 28. A reaction chamber 22 of<br>
greater height than the detection chamber 28 is prepared by layering multiple sheets 32, 34,<br>
and 36 together. The middle sheet 36 of the layer has an aperture defining the sidewalls 74<br>
and 76 of both the reaction chamber 22 and detection chamber 28 as described above. This<br>
middle layer 36 is sandwiched between two or more additional layers 32 and 34, the<br>
additional layers 32 and 34 having an aperture defining the side wall 74 of the reaction<br>
chamber 22 only, the laye'rs 32 and 34 thereby defining end walls 60 and 62 of the<br>
detection chamber 28. In this embodiment, the end walls 60 and 62 of the detection<br>
chamber comprise electrodes 52 and 54, which may be prepared as described below.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 2, antibodies 44 are tethered to the bottom 40 of the reaction<br>
chamber 22. The pseudo-antigen-probe 50 is complexed to the antibodies 44. The<br>
antibody may be tethered to any suitable surface within the reaction chamber, e.g. tethered<br>
to a wall or on a surface of a support within the reaction chamber 22.<br>
A first thin electrode layer 52 is mounted or formed on one side 70 of the sheet of<br>
electrically resistive material 36, extending over the aperture forming the detection chamber<br>
28 and forming an end wall 60. The layer 52 may be adhered to the sheet 36, e.g., by an<br>
adhesive. Suitable adhesives include, for example, heat activated adhesives, pressure<br>
sensitive adhesives, heat cured adhesives, chemically cured adhesives, hot melt adhesives,<br>
hot flow adhesives, and the like.<br>
The electrode layer 52 may be prepared by coating (e.g., by sputter coating as<br>
disclosed in WO97/18464, by screen printing, or by any other suitable method) a sheet of<br>
electrically resistive material 32 with a suitable material, for example, aluminum, copper,<br>
nickel, chromium, steel, stainless steel, platinum, palladium, carbon, carbon mixed with a<br>
binder, indium oxide, tin oxide, mixed indium/tin oxides, gold, silver, iridium, mixtures<br>
thereof, conducting polymers such as polypyrrole or polyacetylene, and the like. If<br>
electrode 52 is to be used as a cathode in the electrochemical cell, then suitable materials<br>
include, for example, aluminum, copper, nickel, chromium, steel, stainless steel, platinum,<br>
palladium, carbon, carbon mixed with a binder, indium oxide, tin oxide, mixed indium/tin<br>
oxides, gold, silver, iridium, mixtures thereof, conducting polymers such as polypyrrole or<br>
polyacetylene, and the like. If electrode 52 is to be used as an anode in the electrochemical<br>
cell or is to come into contact with oxidizing substances during sensor manufacture or<br>
storage, then suitable materials include, for example, platinum, palladium, carbon, carbon<br>
mixed with a binder, indium oxide, tin oxide, mixed indium/tin oxides, gold, silver,<br>
iridium, mixtures thereof, conducting polymers such as polypyrrole or polyacetylene, and<br>
the like. Materials suitable for use as electrodes 52 and 54 are compatible with the reagents<br>
present in the sensor 20, namely, they do not react chemically with reagents at the potential<br>
of choice or during sensor fabrication and storage.<br>
A second thin electrode layer 54 is mounted on the opposite side 72 of the<br>
electrically resistive material 36, also extending over the aperture forming the detection<br>
chamber 28, so as to form a second end wall 62. In this embodiment, the inert, electrically<br>
insulating layer 36 separates the electrode-bearing substrates 32 and 34. Preferably,<br>
insulating layer 36 keeps layers 32 and 34 at a predetermined separation. Provided this<br>
separation is small enough, e.g., less than or equal to about 500 microns, the current<br>
flowing between the electrodes 52 and 54 will be directly proportional to the concentration<br>
of reduced mediator after a suitably short time relative to the detection time employed, hi<br>
this embodiment, the rate of current rise is directly related to the rate of the enzyme reaction<br>
and therefore the amount of enzyme present.<br>
In certain embodiments, an electrode configuration other than an opposing<br>
relationship may be preferred, for example, a side-by-side relationship, or a parallel but<br>
offset relationship. The electrodes may be identical or substantially similar in size, or may<br>
be of different sizes and/or different shapes. The electrodes may comprise the same<br>
conductive material, or different materials. Other variations in electrode configuration,<br>
spacing, and construction or fabrication will be apparent to those of skill in the art.<br>
hi a preferred embodiment, the electrode layers 52 and 54 are mounted in a parallel<br>
opposing relationship at a distance of less than or equal to 500, 450, 400, 350, 300, 250, or<br>
200 microns, and more preferably from about 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50<br>
microns to about 75, 100, 125, 150, or 175 microns. In certain embodiments, however, it<br>
may be preferred that the electrode spacing is greater than 500 microns, for example, 600,<br>
700, 800,900, or 1000 microns, or even greater than 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 millimeters.<br>
The volume of the detection chamber or the reaction chamber is typically about 0.3<br>
microliters or less to about 100 microliters or more, preferably about 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, or<br>
0.9 microliters to about 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, or 90 microliters, and most preferably<br>
about 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, or 5 microliters to about 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, or 18<br>
microliters. However, in certain embodiments, larger or smaller volumes may be preferred<br>
for one or both of the reaction chamber and the detection chamber.<br>
The electrodes 54 and 52 in the detection chamber 28 can be placed in electrical<br>
connection with a meter (not shown) through the connection end 66. The connectors (not<br>
shown) are in electrical connection with the electrodes 54 and 56 in the detection chamber<br>
28 via conducting tracks (not shown). In the preferred embodiment illustrated in Figure 1,<br>
these conducting tracks consist of extensions of the films of conductor 52 and 54 coated<br>
onto the internal surfaces of 32 and 34. The meter in connection with the connection area<br>
66 is capable of applying a potential between the electrodes 52 and 54 in the detection<br>
chamber 28, analyzing the electrical signals generated, displaying a response, optionally<br>
storing the response in memory, and optionally transmitting stored responses to an external<br>
device such as a printer or computer.<br>
In other embodiments utilizing electrochemical detection, stripes of conducting<br>
material on one or both internal faces of the detection chamber are typically used, with at<br>
least two electrodes present, namely, a sensing electrode and a counter/reference electrode.<br>
Optionally, a third electrode, serving as a separate reference electrode, may be present.<br>
When utilizing potentiometric detection methods, the meter is capable of measuring<br>
the potential difference between a sensing electrode and a reference electrode, but need not<br>
be capable of applying a potential between the electrodes.<br>
In embodiments wherein visual detection or reflectance spectroscopy is the<br>
detection method used, the layers 32 and 46 and/or layers 34 and 42 are transparent to the<br>
wavelength of radiation that is to be observed. In the case of visual detection, a simple<br>
color change in the detection chamber 28 is observed. In the case of reflectance<br>
spectroscopy, detection radiation is shone through layers 32 and 46 and/or layers 34 and 42,<br>
and radiation reflected from the solution in the detection chamber 28 is analyzed. In the<br>
case of transmission spectroscopy as the detection method, layers 32, 46, 34, and 42 are<br>
transparent to radiation at the wavelength of choice. Radiation is shone through the sample<br>
in the detection chamber 28 and the attenuation of the beam is measured.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, layer 36 comprises a substrate with a layer of adhesive<br>
(not shown) coated on its upper surface 70 and lower surface 72. Examples of materials<br>
suitable for the substrate of layer 36 include polyester, polystyrene, polycarbonate,<br>
polyolefins, and, preferably, polyethylene terephthalate. These may be native materials or<br>
may be filled with suitable fillers to confer desirable optical or mechanical properties.<br>
Examples of materials suitable as fillers include, but are not limited to, titanium dioxide,<br>
carbon, silica, and glass. Examples of suitable adhesives are pressure sensitive adhesives,<br>
heat and chemically curing adhesives and hot melt and hot flow adhesives. Alternatively,<br>
the spacer layers themselves may consist of a suitable adhesive.<br>
If a sample ingress 24 has not already been formed earlier in the fabrication process,<br>
then one is provided, for example, by forming a notch (not illustrated) in the edge 37 of the<br>
device 20 that intersects the reaction chamber 22.<br>
The dashed circle in Figure 1 denotes an aperture 30 piercing layers 32, 34, and 36<br>
but not layers 42 and 46, the aperture in layer 34 opening into the detection chamber 28.<br>
Since layers 42 and 46 are not pierced initially, the only opening to the atmosphere of the<br>
detection chamber 28 is the sample passageway 38 opening into the reaction chamber 22.<br>
Thus, when the reaction chamber 22 fills with sample, the sample passageway 38 to the<br>
detection chamber 28 is blocked. This traps air in the detection chamber 28 and<br>
substantially prevents it from filling with sample. A small amount of sample will enter the<br>
detection chamber 28 during the time between when the sample first contacts the opening<br>
38 to the detection chamber 28 and when the sample contacts the far side of the opening 38.<br>
However, once the sample has wet totally across the opening 38 to the detection chamber<br>
28, no more filling of the detection chamber 28 will take place. The volume of the reaction<br>
chamber 22 is typically chosen so as to be at least equal to and preferably larger than the<br>
volume of the detection chamber 28. By opening the vent 30 to the atmosphere, sample is<br>
transferred to fill the detection chamber 28. The vent may be opened by means of a needle<br>
connected to a solenoid in the meter.<br>
An immunosensor 100 of another embodiment, as depicted in Figures 3 and 4, may<br>
be prepared as follows. A first shaped layer 112 and a second shaped spacer 114 layer of<br>
similar thickness are each situated atop a bottom layer 116. The first spacer layer 112 is<br>
rectangular in shape, and is situated at the proximal edge 118 of the bottom layer 116. The<br>
second spacer layer 114 is also rectangular in shape, and is situated on the bottom layer 116<br>
at a distance apart from the first spacer layer 112. The distal edge 120 of the first spacer<br>
layer 116 and the proximal edge 122 of the second spacer layer 114 form portions 120, 122<br>
of the side walls of the reaction chamber 124. The bottom layer 116 forms the bottom wall<br>
126 of the reaction chamber 124. Antibodies 164 are tethered to the bottom 126 of the<br>
reaction chamber 124. The antigen-probe or pseudo-antigen-probe 162 is bound to the<br>
tethered antibodies 164.<br>
A third shaped spacer layer 128, similar in shape to the first shaped spacer layer<br>
112, is situated atop the first shaped spacer layer 112. A fourth spacer layer 130 has a slit<br>
132 extending through the proximal end 134 of the spacer layer 130 towards the center of<br>
the spacer layer 130. The fourth spacer layer is 130 situated atop the second shaped spacer<br>
layer 114 with the proximal ends 122, 134 aligned. The slit 132 in the fourth spacer layer<br>
forms the sidewalls (not illustrated) of the detection chamber 132. The portion 138 of the<br>
second spacer layer exposed by the slit 132 in the fourth spacer layer 130 forms the bottom<br>
138 of the detection chamber 132. The proximal end 140 of the slit 132 forms the<br>
passageway 140 between the reaction chamber 124 and the detection chamber 132. The<br>
proximal end 134 of the fourth spacer layer 130 forms a portion 134 of the sidewall of the<br>
reaction chamber 124.<br>
A fifth shaped spacer 142, similar in shape to the first shaped spacer layer 112 and<br>
third shaped spacer layer 128, is situated atop the third spacer layer 128. A sixth shaped<br>
spacer layer 144, similar in shape to the second shaped spacer layer 114, is placed atop the<br>
fourth shaped spacer layer 130, with the proximal ends 146, 122 aligned. The portion 170<br>
of the sixth spacer layer exposed by the slit 132 in the fourth spacer layer 130 forms the top<br>
170 of the detection chamber 132. An aperture 148 extends through the sixth shaped spacer<br>
layer 144. The distal end 150 of the aperture 148 and the distal end 152 of the slit 132 are<br>
aligned. The aperture 148 forms a portion 150 of a sidewall of a vent 154, allowing<br>
displacement of air from the detection chamber 132 as it fills with sample. A top layer 156<br>
is fitted over the fifth spacer layer 142 and sixth spacer layer 144. The top layer 156 also<br>
includes an aperture 158 of similar size and shape and in alignment with the aperture 148 in<br>
the sixth shaped layer 144.<br>
In certain embodiments, it may be preferred to delay the filling of the detection<br>
chamber 132 to some time after sample has filled the reaction chamber 124, to allow time<br>
for the immuno-reactions to proceed in the reaction chamber 124. In these embodiments,<br>
this is achieved by forming a vent hole 158 in layer 116 and/or 156 after completion of the<br>
immuno-reactions. When the reaction chamber 124 fills with sample, air is trapped in the<br>
detection chamber 132, which prevents it from being filled with sample. At a suitable time<br>
after sample has filled the reaction chamber 124, at least one of the top layer 156 and the<br>
bottom layer 116 can be punctured above the vent hole 148 or below the vent hole 154 by a<br>
suitable device, such as a needle or blade. When this occurs, the air in the detection<br>
chamber 132 can vent through the hole 148 or hole 154 formed in layer 116 and/or 156 via<br>
aperture 148 or 154, thus allowing sample to be drawn into the detection chamber 132 from<br>
the reaction chamber 124 by capillary action and the displaced air to be vented.<br>
The height of the detection chamber 132 is typically selected to be less than the<br>
height of the reaction chamber 124 such that, in combination with the surface energies of<br>
the faces of chambers 132 and 124, the capillary force in the detection chamber 132 will be<br>
greater than that in the reaction chamber 124. The stronger capillary force in the detection<br>
chamber 132 serves to draw sample into the detection chamber 132 while emptying the<br>
reaction chamber 124. This method of using differentials in capillary force to fill a<br>
chamber is described in detail in copending Application No. 09/536,234 filed on March 27,<br>
2000.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the height of the reaction chamber is typically greater<br>
than the height of the detection chamber. The height of the detection chamber is typically<br>
about 500 microns or less, preferably about 450, 400, 350, 300, 250 microns or less, and<br>
more preferably about 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 microns to about 75, 100, 125,<br>
150, 175, or 200 microns. These detection chamber heights are particularly well suited to<br>
applications wherein the top and bottom walls of the detection chamber comprise electrode<br>
layers. However, there may be certain embodiments wherein electrochemical detection is<br>
employed wherein cell heights greater than about 500 microns may be preferred. These<br>
detection chamber heights may also be suitable when detection methods other than<br>
electrochemical detection are employed. When another detection method is employed, for<br>
example, an optical detection method, different cell heights may be preferred. In such<br>
embodiments, a cell height of about 600, 700, 800, or 900 microns or more, or even about<br>
1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, or 5 mm or more may be preferred. The height of the reaction<br>
chamber is typically greater than that of the detection chamber. However, in certain<br>
embodiments it may be preferred to employ a reaction chamber having the same or a<br>
similar height as the detection chamber, or even a smaller height than the detection<br>
chamber. The detection chamber height is typically from about 5 microns or less to about<br>
1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, or 5 mm or more, preferably about 900, 800, 700, 600, or 500<br>
microns or less, more preferably about 450, 400, 350, 300, or 250 microns or less, and most<br>
preferably from about 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 microns to about 75, 100, 125,<br>
150, 175, 200, or 250 microns.<br>
When the immunosensor 100 is an electrochemical sensor 100, the top surface of<br>
the second spacer layer 138 and the bottom surface 160 of the sixth spacer layer 144 which<br>
are exposed by the slit 132 in the fourth spacer layer 130 may be partially or completely<br>
coated with a conducting material. Alternatively, layers 114 and 144 may themselves be<br>
made of electrically conductive materials. Electrical connection between the two<br>
conducting layers (not illustrated) and a meter (not illustrated) enable electrochemical<br>
measurements to be conducted within the detection chamber.<br>
Fabrication Methods<br>
For purposes of illustration, details of the fabrication of sensors of preferred<br>
embodiments are discussed with reference to the sensor depicted in Figures 3 and 4. The<br>
sensor strip 100 is typically constructed of layers of material laminated together. One or<br>
more spacer layers 128, 130 are used to space layers 112 and 114 apart from layers 142 and<br>
144. The spacer layers have adhesive faces to allow layers 112, 128, and 142 and layers<br>
114, 130, and 144 to be held together. Alternatively, the spacer layers themselves may<br>
consist of an adhesive, or may comprise a material capable of adhering to adjacent layers by<br>
the application of heat and/or pressure in a lamination method.<br>
The detection chamber 132 is a capillary space where layers 114 and 144 form the<br>
end walls of the space and the thickness of layers 128, 130 define the height. Layers 114<br>
and 144 can also serve as substrates for electrode coatings (not illustrated) that form the<br>
electrodes of an electrochemical cell or may act as the electrodes themselves by virtue of<br>
being constructed of electrically conductive materials. In construction, detection chamber<br>
132 is typically formed by punching out, or otherwise removing a portion of layer 130.<br>
This cutout portion of layer 130 can also serve to define the electrode area of the<br>
electrochemical cell.<br>
The reaction chamber 124 can be formed by punching or otherwise removing a<br>
portion of the spacer layers, with the areas removed such that the reaction chamber overlaps<br>
with the detection chamber 132, thus causing the detection chamber 132 to open into the<br>
reaction chamber 124. Layers 116 and 156 can then be laminated to the external face of<br>
layers 112, 114 and layers 142, 144, respectively, to form the end walls 126, 174 of reaction<br>
chamber 124. The immuno-chemicals 164 and 162 can be coated onto an internal face 126<br>
and/or 174 of layers 116 and/or 156 prior to or following the lamination of 116 and 156<br>
onto layers 112, 114 and layers 142, 144, respectively. Layers 116 and 156 can be adhered<br>
to layers 112, 114 and layers 142, 144, respectively, by an adhesive layer on the external<br>
face of layers 112, 114 and layers 142, 144, respectively, or on the internal face of layers<br>
116 and 156.<br>
The vent 148 and/or 154 can advantageously be formed by punching a hole through<br>
layers 114, 130, and 144. From the point of view of simplifying the strip fabrication<br>
process, it is particularly advantageous to form vent 148 and/or 154 at the same time as the<br>
cut-out portion for the reaction chamber 124 and/or the detection chamber 132 is formed, as<br>
this makes it easier to achieve a reproducible spatial relationship between the chamber(s)<br>
and the vent, and also reduces the number of process steps.<br>
In a different embodiment, the vent 148, 154, 158, can be formed by punching<br>
through layers 114, 116, 130, 144, and 156 and additional tape layers (not illustrated)<br>
laminated over both ends of the hole thus formed. This has the advantage of permitting<br>
optimization of the properties of layers 116 and 156 and the vent hole covering tape layers<br>
(not illustrated) separately. Alternatively, vent hole 148, 154, 158 can be formed by<br>
punching through layers 114, 130, 144 and 116 or 156 prior to the lamination of layers 116<br>
or 156, respectively. This leaves an opening of 158 to only one face of the strip 100 and<br>
thus only one covering tape is used.<br>
In a further embodiment, the layers 116 and 156 can be formed and laminated to<br>
layers 114 and 144 such that layers 116 and 156 do not extend to cover the area where the<br>
vent 158 is formed. Then it is only necessary to punch through layers 114, 130 and 144 to<br>
form the vent 148, 154, 158 and additional tape layers (not illustrated) laminated over both<br>
ends of the hole thus formed.<br>
The layers may be adhered to each other by any suitable method, for example,<br>
pressure sensitive adhesive, curable adhesives, hot melt adhesives, lamination by<br>
application of heat and/or pressure, mechanical fasteners, and the like.<br>
The above-described configurations for the sensor are but two of many possible<br>
configurations for the sensor, as will be appreciated by one of skill in the art. For example,<br>
the vent may be provided through the top of the strip, the bottom of the strip, both the top<br>
and bottom of the strip, or through one or more sides of the strip. The vent may be of any<br>
suitable configuration, and may extend directly into a portion of the detection chamber, or<br>
may follow a circuitous path into the detection chamber. The detection chamber may be of<br>
any suitable shape, for example, rectangular, square, circular, or irregular. The detection<br>
chamber may abut the reaction chamber, or a separate sample passageway between the<br>
reaction chamber and the detection chamber may be provided. Sample may be admitted to<br>
the reaction chamber on either side of the strip, as in the sensor of Figures 4 and 3, or only<br>
through one side of the strip with the opposite side blocked by a spacer, as in Figures 1 and<br>
2. The detection chamber may be of any suitable shape, for example, rectangular, square,<br>
circular, or irregular. The detection chamber may be contained within the body of the strip,<br>
and access to the detection chamber may be provided by one or more sample ingresses<br>
through the top, bottom, or sides of the strip. Typically, a particular configuration is<br>
selected such that the fabrication method may be simplified, e.g., by performing fewer steps<br>
or by using fewer components.<br>
Electrochemical Detection<br>
When the sensor is an electrochemical cell, the electrode layers, for example, layers<br>
52 and 54 of the sensor of Figures 1 and 2, are provided with an electrical connector<br>
allowing the sensor 20 to be placed in a measuring circuit. At least one of the electrodes 52<br>
or 54 in the cell 28 is a sensing electrode, i.e., an electrode sensitive to the amount of<br>
oxidized or reduced form of an analyte in the sample. In the case of a potentiometric sensor<br>
20 wherein the potential of the sensing electrode 52 or 54 is indicative of the level of<br>
analyte present, a second electrode 54 or 52, acting as reference electrode is present which<br>
acts to provide a reference potential. In the case of an amperometric sensor 20 wherein the<br>
sensing electrode current is indicative of the level of analyte in the sample, at least one<br>
other electrode 54 or 52 is present which functions as a counter electrode to complete the<br>
electrical circuit. This second electrode 54 or 52 may also function as a reference electrode.<br>
Alternatively, a separate electrode (not shown) may perform the function of a reference<br>
electrode.<br>
If the immunosensor 20 is operated as an electrochemical cell 28, then the sheet 36<br>
containing the apertures defining the reaction chamber 22 and/or detection chamber 28<br>
comprises an electrically resistive material. In a preferred embodiment, sheets 32 and 34<br>
also comprise an electrically resistive material. Suitable electrically resistive materials<br>
include, for example, polyesters, polystyrenes, polycarbonates, polyolefins, mixtures<br>
thereof, and the like. Preferred polyester is polyethylene terephthalate. In the sensor<br>
depicted in Figures 1 and 2, the layers 32 and 34 are substrates coated with electrically<br>
conductive material 52 and 54. The electrically conductive material 52 or 54 is coated on<br>
the surface 60 or 62 facing the detection chamber 28 and an adhesive layer (not shown) is<br>
coated on the surface 33 or 35 facing layer 42 or 46, respectively.<br>
In the embodiment depicted in Figures 3 and 4, the detection chamber 132 has<br>
electrically conductive coatings (not illustrated) on the internal face of 138 and 170 which<br>
are suitable for use as electrodes in an electrochemical sensor cell. Also contained in the<br>
detection chamber 132 is a dry reagent layer 172 comprising a substrate for the probe<br>
enzyme and, if necessary, a redox species capable of cycling the enzyme between its<br>
oxidized and reduced forms and capable of being oxidized or reduced at the cell electrodes.<br>
A buffer may also be present to control pH in the detection chamber 132. When the<br>
immunosensor is in use, the electrodes are connected to an external electronic meter device<br>
(not illustrated) through external connectors (not illustrated), for example, tongue plugs, as<br>
are known in the art. Suitable connectors are disclosed in copending Application No.<br>
09/399,512 filed on September 20, 1999 and copending Application No. 60/345,743 filed<br>
on January 4, 2002.<br>
If the immunosensor 20, 100 is operated using a detection method other than an<br>
electrochemical detection method, then the materials from which the sensor is constructed<br>
need not be electrically resistive. However, the polymeric materials described above are<br>
preferred for use in constructing the immunosensors of preferred embodiments because of<br>
their ease of processing, low cost, and lack of reactivity to reagents and samples.<br>
Optical Detection<br>
In an alternative embodiment, an optical rather than an electrochemical detection<br>
system are used. According to this alternative embodiment, electrodes are not necessary<br>
and an external light source and photocell are used to analyze light transmitted through, or<br>
reflected from the solution in detection chamber. In one embodiment, it is preferred to<br>
shine the light through the top surface of the sensor then through the sample, where it is<br>
reflected off the lower sensor layer and then back up through the sample and the top layer,<br>
where it is detected. In another embodiment, light is shone in through the side of the<br>
detection chamber and totally internally reflected between the end faces of the detection<br>
chamber until it passes out through the other side of the detection chamber, where it is<br>
detected. In these embodiments, the layers above, to the side, and/or below the detection<br>
chamber are substantially transparent to the analyzing light that is passed through the layer<br>
or layers. The techniques described in copending Application No. 09/404, 119 filed on<br>
September 23, 1999 may be adapted for use with the immunosensors of preferred<br>
embodiments utilizing optical detection systems. Alternatively, in certain embodiments it<br>
may be preferred to use a combination of electrochemical detection and optical detection<br>
methods, which is also described in Application No. 09/404, 119.<br>
Reagents and Other Materials Present in the Immunosensor<br>
Reagents for use in the reaction chamber, e.g., immobilized antibody, pseudo-<br>
antigen-probe, buffer, mediator, and the like, may be supported on the walls of the reaction<br>
chamber or on the walls of the detection chamber, on an independent support contained<br>
within chambers, within a matrix, or may be self supporting. If the reagents are to be<br>
supported on the chamber walls or electrodes, the chemicals may be applied by use of<br>
printing techniques well known in the art, e.g., ink jet printing, screen printing, slot coating,<br>
lithography, and the like. In a preferred embodiment, a solution containing the reagent is<br>
applied to a surface within a chamber and allowed to dry.<br>
Rather than immobilize or dry the reagents or other chemicals onto the surfaces of<br>
the reaction chamber or detection chamber, it may be advantageous to support them on or<br>
contain them within one or more independent supports, which are then placed into a<br>
chamber. Suitable independent supports include, but are not limited to, mesh materials,<br>
nonwoven sheet materials, fibrous filling materials, macroporous membranes, sintered<br>
powders, gels, or beads. The advantages of independent supports include an increased<br>
surface area, thus allowing more antibody and pseudo-antigen-probe to be included in the<br>
reaction chamber, if desired. In such an embodiment, the antibody bound to the pseudo-<br>
antigen-probe is dried onto a piece of porous material, which is then placed in the reaction<br>
chamber. It is also easier during fabrication to wash unbound protein from independent<br>
supports, such as beads, compared to washing unbound protein off of the surface of the<br>
reaction chamber.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the antibody bound to the pseudo-antigen-<br>
probe is supported on beads. Such beads may comprise a polymeric material, e.g., latex or<br>
agarose, optionally encasing a magnetic material (such as gamma Fe2O3 and Fe3O4). The<br>
bead material is selected such that suitable support for the antibody is provided. Suitable<br>
beads may include those marketed as DYNABEADS® by Dynal Biotech of Oslo, Norway.<br>
Optionally, a magnet may be included in the meter to hold the magnetic beads in the<br>
reaction chamber and to stop them from moving to the detection chamber.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the walls of the reaction chamber are porous, with the<br>
antibody bound to the pseudo-antigen-probe incorporated into the pores. In this<br>
embodiment, the liquid sample is able to wick into the porous wall, but not leak out of the<br>
defined area. This is accomplished by using a macroporous membrane to form the reaction<br>
chamber wall and compressing the membrane around the reaction chamber to prevent<br>
leakage of sample out of the desired area, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,980,709 to<br>
Hodges, et al.<br>
Suitable independent supports such as beads, mesh materials, nonwoven sheet<br>
materials, and fibrous fill materials include, polyolefins, polyesters, nylons, cellulose,<br>
polystyrenes, polycarbonates, polysulfones, mixtures thereof, and the like. Suitable<br>
macroporous membranes may be prepared from polymeric materials including<br>
polysulfones, polyvinylidene difluorides, nylons, cellulose acetates, polymethacrylates,<br>
polyacrylates, mixtures thereof, and the like.<br>
The antibody bound to the pseudo-antigen-probe may be contained within a matrix,<br>
e.g., polyvinyl acetate. By varying the solubility characteristics of the matrix in the sample,<br>
controlled release of the protein or antibody into the sample may be achieved.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 2, dried reagents 64 may optionally be disposed in the<br>
detection chamber 28. These reagents may include an enzyme substrate (used as a probe)<br>
and a mediator, capable of reacting with the enzyme part of the pseudo-antigen-enzyme<br>
probe 50 to produce a detectable signal. The enzyme substrate and mediator, if present, are<br>
to be of sufficient amount such that the rate of reaction of any enzyme present with the<br>
enzyme substrate 64 is determined by the amount of enzyme present. For instance, if the<br>
enzyme is glucose oxidase or glucose dehydrogenase, a suitable enzyme mediator 64 and<br>
glucose (if not already present in the sample) is disposed into the detection chamber 28.<br>
In an embodiment wherein an electrochemical detection system is used, ferricyanide<br>
is a suitable mediator. Other suitable mediators include dichlorophenolindophenol and<br>
complexes between transition metals and nitrogen-containing heteroatomic species. Buffer<br>
may also be included to adjust the pH of the sample in the detection chamber 28, if<br>
necessary. The glucose, mediator, and buffer reagents 64 are present in sufficient quantities<br>
such that the rate of reaction of the enzyme with the enzyme substrate 64 is limited by the<br>
concentration of the enzyme present.<br>
The internal surface 40 of the substrate 42, which forms the base of the reaction<br>
chamber 22, is coated with pseudo-antigen-probe 50 bound to antibodies 44 to the antigen<br>
to be detected in the sample. The antibodies 44 are adsorbed or otherwise immobilized on<br>
the surface 40 of the substrate 42 such that they are not removed from the substrate 42<br>
during a test. Optionally, during or after application of the antibodies 44 to the internal<br>
surface 40 of the substrate 42, an agent designed to prevent non-specific binding of proteins<br>
to this surface can be applied (not shown). An example of such an agent well known in the<br>
art is bovine serum albumin (BSA). A nonionic surfactant may also be used as such an<br>
agent, e.g., TRITON® X100 surfactant manufactured by Rohm &amp; Haas of Philadelphia,<br>
Pennsylvania, or TWEEN® surfactants manufactured by ICI Americas of Wilmington,<br>
Delaware. The nonionic surfactant selected does not denature proteins. The coating 44 on<br>
the internal surface 40 of the substrate 42 is in the dry state when ready to be used in a test.<br>
In preferred embodiments wherein electrochemical detection is employed, enzymes<br>
may be used as the probe. Examples of suitable enzymes include, but are not limited to,<br>
horseradish peroxidase, glucose oxidase, and glucose dehydrogenase, for example, PQQ<br>
dependent glucose dehydrogenase or NAD dependent glucose dehydrogenase.<br>
The probe can also be an enzyme co-factor. Examples of suitable co-factors<br>
include, but are not limited to, flavin mononucleotide, flavin adenine dinucleotide,<br>
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and pyrroloquinoline quinone. The co-factor is<br>
preferably linked to the antigen by a flexible spacer to allow the co-factor to bind to the<br>
apoenzyme. When the probe is a co-factor, the apoenzyme may optionally be co-dried with<br>
the enzyme substrate and mediator in the reaction chamber.<br>
The probe can also be a regulator of enzyme activity. Examples of suitable enzyme<br>
regulators include, but are not limited to, kinases or phosphorylases. Enzyme regulators<br>
may alter the activity of the enzyme by changing the state of phosphorylation, methylation,<br>
adenylation, uridylation or adenosine diphosphate ribosylation of the enzyme. Enzyme<br>
regulators may also alter the activity of the enzyme by cleaving a peptide off the enzyme.<br>
When the probe is an enzyme regulator, the enzyme is co-dried with the enzyme substrate<br>
and mediator in the reaction chamber.<br>
The probe can be a protein subunit which is part of a multi-subunit complex. An<br>
example of such a protein subunit is one of the subunits in the multi-subunit enzyme<br>
cytochrome oxidase.<br>
The antibody and pseudo-antigen-probe can be complexed together before being<br>
dried into the reaction chamber. Complexation conditions are chosen to minimize the<br>
amount of free (uncomplexed) pseudo-antigen-probe, as this species will increase the<br>
background signal in the assay. The amount of free antibody is also minimized as this<br>
species will bind antigen and stop it from displacing the pseudo-antigen-probe, thus<br>
reducing the sensitivity of the assay. For example, it is possible to optimize the<br>
complexation of pseudo-antigen-probes with antibodies by "crowding" the solutions with<br>
inert macromolecules, such as polyethylene glycol, which excludes volume to the proteins<br>
and thus raises their thermodynamic activity and enhances the affinity of their binding to<br>
one another. See, e.g., Minton, Biopolymers, Vol. 20, pp 2093-2120 (1981).<br>
It is advantageous to have the antibody immobilized on beads before it is complexed<br>
to the pseudo-antigen-probe. This allows all the antibody sites to be occupied by exposing<br>
them to a high concentration of the pseudo-antigen-probe. Excess pseudo-antigen-probe is<br>
then readily removed by centrifugation and washing of the beads.<br>
The immunosensor is most sensitive to antigen concentrations from about 1 nM to<br>
about 10 |uM (micromolar). For an antigen with a relative molar mass of 100,000, this<br>
corresponds to about 0.1 mg/mL (micrograms/mL) to about 1000 mg/mL (micrograms/mL).<br>
However, the sensor can be modified (e.g., by changing the separation between the<br>
electrodes, or by applying a different pattern of voltage pulses) to assay antigen<br>
concentrations in the range 0.1 nM or less to 0.1 mM or more.<br>
The maximum detectable limit of the assay is determined by the concentration of<br>
pseudo-antigen-probe/antibody in the reaction chamber. This molar concentration is<br>
therefore set to correspond to the expected range of molar antigen concentrations that are<br>
typically encountered in samples of interest. For example, the concentration of C-reactive<br>
protein encountered in a typical pathology laboratory is from about 10 nM to about 10 mM<br>
(micromolar).<br>
Examples of antigens that may be assayed include, but are not limited to, Alpha-<br>
fetoprotein, Carcinoembryonic antigen, C-reactive protein, cardiac Troponin I, cardiac<br>
Troponin T, Digoxin, ferritin, Gamma glutamyl transferase, Glycated hemoglobin, glycated<br>
protein, Hepatitis A, B and C, chorionic gonadotropin, Human immunodeficiency virus,<br>
insulin, serum amyloid A, thromblastin, Prostate specific antigen, Prothrombin, Thyroxine,<br>
Tumor antigen CA125, Tumor antigen CA15-3, Tumor antigen CA27/29, Tumor antigen<br>
CA19-9, and Tumor antigen NMP22.<br>
The sensors of preferred embodiments are not limited to the assay of human<br>
antigens, but are also suitable for use in veterinary and animal husbandry applications.<br>
Also, if an antigen is too small to be immunogenic, then it can be attached to a carrier as a<br>
hapten and antibodies can be raised to it in this way. Therefore the invention is not limited<br>
to the assay of protein antigens or to large molecules, but is also applicable to small<br>
antigens as well.<br>
Antibodies suitable for use in the sensors of preferred embodiments include, but are<br>
not limited to, the natural antibodies, such as IgG, IgM and IgA. Suitable antibodies can<br>
also be made up of fragments of natural antibodies, such as F(ab)2 or Fab. The antibody can<br>
be composed of genetically engineered or synthetic fragments of natural antibodies, such as<br>
scFv (single chain Fragment variable) species.<br>
The antibodies can be complexed to native antigen probes or to "pseudo-antigen"<br>
probes. Examples of pseudo-antigens include antigens from other species. For example, if<br>
human C-reactive protein is to be assayed then the pseudo-antigen may include canine,<br>
feline, equine, bovine, ovine, porcine or avian C-reactive protein. Pseudo-antigens can also<br>
be made by modifying the native antigen. For example, if human C-reactive protein is to be<br>
assayed, then the pseudo-antigen may include a monomeric form of the native pentamer, or<br>
C-reactive protein which has had its amine, carboxyl, hydroxyl, thiol or disulfide groups<br>
chemically modified.<br>
Using the Sensor to Determine the Presence or Absence of an Antigen<br>
The sensor may be used to determine the presence or absence of an antigen in a<br>
sample as follows. Referring to Figures 3 and 4, the strip sensor 100 contains a reaction<br>
chamber 124 and a detection chamber 132. Sample is introduced into reaction chamber<br>
124 via port 166 or 168. The separation between layers 116 and 156 and the surface energy<br>
of their internal surfaces is such that the sample will be drawn into reaction chamber 124 by<br>
capillary action. Reaction chamber 124 contains antibodies 164 immobilized to an internal<br>
face 126 of the reaction chamber 124. Pseudo-antigen-probe complexes 162 are bound to<br>
antibodies 164 such that substantially all the antibody recognition sites for the antigen are<br>
blocked by pseudo-antigen-probe 162. In this embodiment, the probe is an enzyme.<br>
In Figure 4, the antibody is shown as coated only on one face 126 of the reaction<br>
chamber 124, but it may advantageously be coated on more than one face 126 of the<br>
reaction chamber 124 or coated onto a separate support (not illustrated) that is contained in<br>
the reaction chamber 124. However, for ease of fabrication it is typically preferred that the<br>
antibodies 164 are only coated on one portion of the reaction chamber 124, or on a single<br>
support material. When a separate support is used to immobilize the antibodies 164, the<br>
support is such that it does not enter the detection chamber 132 during the test. This can be<br>
achieved by, for example, adhering the support to at least one face 126 of the reaction<br>
chamber 124, or by selecting the size or shape of the support such that it cannot enter<br>
through the sample passageway 134 into detection chamber 132, or by selecting a support<br>
of sufficient density such that it remains on the lower face 126 of the reaction chamber 124<br>
when the sample is transferred to the detection chamber 132.<br>
When sample fills the reaction chamber 124, the pseudo-antigen-enzyme probe 162<br>
bound to antibody 164 contacts the sample and a small fraction of the pseudo-antigen-probe<br>
dissociates from the antibody 164 and into the sample. Sufficient time is then allowed for<br>
the dynamic equilibrium between bound and unbound pseudo-antigen-enzyme probe 162 to<br>
be established. If antigen is present in the sample, the antigen, which binds more strongly<br>
to the antibody 164 than the pseudo-antigen-enzyme probe 162, eventually displaces the<br>
pseudo-antigen-enzyme probe 162. Thus each antigen that binds to an immobilized<br>
antibody 164 will displace one pseudo-antigen-enzyme probe 162 into solution.<br>
The end of the reaction step is a predetermined time after the sample is introduced<br>
into the reaction chamber 124. The predetermined time is set such that there is sufficient<br>
time for substantially all of the antigen in the sample to displace pseudo-antigen-enzyme<br>
probe 162 to bind to the antibody 164. Alternatively, the predetermined time can be set<br>
such that a known fraction of the antigen displaces the pseudo-antigen-probe 162 to bind to<br>
the antibody 164.<br>
The time that the sample is introduced into the reaction chamber 124 can be<br>
indicated by the user, for example, by depressing a button on a meter (not illustrated)<br>
connected to the sensor 100. This action is used to trigger a timing device (not illustrated).<br>
In the case of visual detection, no meter device is necessary, m such an embodiment, the<br>
user manually times the reaction period.<br>
In the case where electrochemical detection is used to detect the result of the<br>
immuno-reactions, the indication that sample has been introduced into the reaction chamber<br>
124 can be automated. As described above, when sample fills the reaction chamber 124, a<br>
small portion of the detection chamber 132 at its opening 140 into the reaction chamber 124<br>
will be wet by sample. If electrochemical detection is employed then at least two electrodes<br>
(not illustrated) are present in the detection chamber 132. If these electrodes (not<br>
illustrated) are placed in the detection chamber 134, such that at least a portion of each<br>
electrode (not illustrated) is contacted by the sample during the filling of the reaction<br>
chamber 124, the presence of the sample will bridge the electrodes (not illustrated) and<br>
create an electrical signal which can be used to trigger the timing device.<br>
A predetermined time after the timing device has been triggered, either by the user<br>
or automatically, the immuno-reaction phase of the test is deemed to be completed. When<br>
the immuno-reaction phase of the test is completed, the vent 158 to the atmosphere is<br>
opened. For example, a solenoid activated needle in the meter may be used to pierce layer<br>
156 and/or layer 116, or additionally layers 114 and 44, thus opening the distal end 152 of<br>
the detection chamber 132 to the atmosphere. The piercing can be automatically performed<br>
by the meter, as in the example above, or manually by the user in the case of visual<br>
detection wherein no meter may be used, e.g., the user inserts a needle through the layers<br>
156, 116, 114, and/or 144 into the detection chamber, thereby forming the vent 158.<br>
The opening of the vent 158 to the atmosphere allows the air trapped in the<br>
detection chamber 132 to escape, thereby allowing the detection chamber 132 to be rilled<br>
with reacted sample from the reaction chamber 124. The reacted sample will be drawn into<br>
the detection chamber 132 due to increased capillary force in the detection chamber 132<br>
compared to that present in the reaction chamber 124. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
increased capillary force is provided by suitably coating the surfaces 138 and 160 of the<br>
detection chamber 132 or, more preferably, by choosing the capillary distance for the<br>
detection chamber 132 to be smaller than that of the reaction chamber 124. In this<br>
embodiment, the capillary distance is defined to be the smallest dimension of the chamber.<br>
When the detection chamber 132 is filled, the reagents 172 dissolve into the sample.<br>
The enzyme component of the reagent layer 172 reacts with the enzyme substrate and the<br>
mediator to produce reduced mediator. This reduced mediator is electrochemically<br>
oxidized at an electrode (not illustrated) acting as an anode in the detection chamber 134 to<br>
produce an electrical current. In one embodiment, the rate of change of this current with<br>
time is used as an indicator of the presence and amount of enzyme that is present in the<br>
reacted sample. If the rate of change of current is less than a predetermined threshold value<br>
(taking into account that some pseudo-antigen-enzyme probe 162 is liberated into solution<br>
as a result of the dynamic equilibrium that is established between the free and bound<br>
pseudo-antigen-enzyme probe 162), then it is indicative of no significant amount of pseudo-<br>
antigen-enzyme probe 162 present in the reacted sample, indicating the lack of antigen<br>
present in the original sample. If the rate of change of current is higher than the threshold<br>
rate, it indicates that pseudo-antigen-enzyme probe 162 is present in the reacted sample in<br>
an amount greater than the threshold value, and thus antigen is also present in the sample<br>
initially. In one embodiment, the rate of change of the current is used to give a measure of<br>
the relative amount of antigen initially present in the sample.<br>
