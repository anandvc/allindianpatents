WO 2005/112306<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000676<br><br>
Description<br>
INTER-SYSTEM HANDOVER<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]		The present invention relates to a method of handover between different types of mobile communication systems, and in particular, to a method of handover in a wireless communication network in which an asynchronous system and a synchronous system co-exist. <br>
Background Art<br>
[2]		The current mobile communication network has a format in which a synchronous mobile communication system (CDMA mobile communication system) called 2G or 2.5G communication networks and an asynchronous mobile communication system (WCDMA mobile communication system) called 3G communication network co-exist.<br>
[3]		As such mobile communication network technology has advanced, a dual band and dual mode terminal (DBDM), which can be used in both the synchronous system and the asynchronous system, is being currently developed, and such mobile terminal allows the use of different modes of services in both the asynchronous system area and the synchronous system area. The DBDM mobile terminal comprises an antenna, a synchronous modem that is a module for a synchronous mobile communication service, an asynchronous modem that is a module for an asynchronous mobile communication service, and a common module.<br>
[4]		Since the asynchronous mobile communication system is at an initial stage of services and needs massive investment costs to implement the system, it cannot provide coverage over a wide area, so it is implemented in the form of overlap with the synchronous mobile communication system area. Since the service coverage area of the asynchronous mobile communication system is limited, if a subscriber of the asynchronous mobile communication system, who is using the service in the asynchronous service area, moves to the synchronous service area where the asynchronous mobile communication service is not provided, a handover is needed to provide a continuous service to the subscriber.<br>
[5]		Currently, a variety of handover methods are being studied for a terminal which moves from the asynchronous mobile communication system to the synchronous mobile communication system. During such a handover of a mobile terminal, the mobile terminal must switch an asynchronous vocoder, which is used for a voice call with the asynchronous communication system, to a synchronous vocoder, which is used for a voice call with the synchronous communication system, and both the asynchronous and synchronous communication systems require a vocoder switching<br><br>
3<br>
WO 2005/112306	PCT/KR2005/000676<br>
process. Accordingly, both the mobile terminal and the mobile communication system can conduct a voice call after the vocoders are switched.<br>
[6]		However, since there exists a gap between the timing of switching the vocoder of the mobile terminal and the timing of switching the vocoder of the mobile communication system, a silent period occurs during handover, and thereby the service quality is degraded. <br>
Disclosure of Invention <br>
Technical Solution<br>
[7]		An object of the present invention is to provide a handover method in a mobile    communication network in which different modes of mobile communication systems co-exist.<br>
[8]		Another object of the present invention is to provide a handover method capable of minimizing a silent period during handover between different modes of mobile communication systems.<br>
[9]		Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a handover method from an asynchronous mobile communication system to a synchronous mobile communication system.<br>
[10]		According to a first aspect of the present invention for achieving the above-described objects, a handover method of a dual mode mobile communication system during call from an asynchronous mobile communication system to a synchronous mobile communication system comprises the steps of: said asynchronous mobile communication system requesting a handover to said synchronous mobile communication system according to a handover request of said mobile terminal; said synchronous mobile communication system assigning a forward traffic channel to said mobile terminal, and transmitting a response message with respect to said handover request to said asynchronous mobile communication system; said asynchronous mobile communication system instructing a handover to said mobile terminal; when said handover instruction is received, said mobile terminal transmitting a frame or a preamble to said synchronous mobile communication system through a reverse traffic channel, reporting to said synchronous mobile communication system that the handover has been c ompleted, and actuating a timer which is set to a predetermined time; said mobile terminal switching a vocoder when the setting time of said timer has expired; and when the handover completion report is received from said mobile terminal, said synchronous mobile communication system reporting to said asynchronous mobile communication system that the handover of said mobile terminal has been completed, and switching vocoders between an asynchronous switching center and a synchronous switching center.<br><br>
WO 2005/112306                                                       4	PCT/KR2005/000676<br>

[12]        Preferably, said method further comprises the step of said asynchronous mobile<br>
  communication system determining whether the handover request of said mobile<br>
  terminal is a handover in the asynchronous communication system or a handover to the<br>

   system in which an asynchronous mobile communication system and a synchronous     <br>
   mobile communication system co-exist and in which said asynchronous mobile com    <br>

In addition, preferably, said step of releasing the connection between said asynchronous switching center and said node B/radio network controller comprises the steps of: said interworking/interoperability function unit requesting said asynchronous switching center, and reporting that said switching center and said mobile terminal have been connected to each other by using the ISUP message; and the connection between said asynchronous switching center and said node B/radio network controller being released.<br>
[29]	    Also preferably, after the step of releasing the connection between said asynchronous  switching center and said node B/radio network controller, said method further comprises the steps of: releasing a call between said asynchronous switching center and said synchronous switching center as the mobile terminal in the asynchronous mobile communication system area releases a call; releasing a trunk between said asynchronous switching center and said synchronous switching center; and as said asynchronous switching center reports to said interworking/interoperability function unit that the connection release has been completed, said interworking/interoperability function unit transmitting a call release request message to said synchronous switching center; and said synchronous switching center responding to said call release request message so that said trunk is released.<br><br>

[37]	The invention will be specifically described with reference to the exemplary em-<br>
 bodiments.<br>
[38]	FIRST EMBODIMENT:<br>
[39]	FIG. 1 shows one embodiment of a mobile communication network to which the<br>
                present invention is applied and in which an asynchronous mobile communication<br>
                system and a synchronous mobile communication system co-exist.<br>
[40]	FIGs. 2 and 3 are flow diagrams showing the inter-system handover process in the<br>
                mobile communication system network shown in FIG. 1 according to one embodiment<br>
                of the present invention.<br>
[41 ]	Referring to FIG. 1, a mobile terminal (10) applied in the present invention has a<br>
dual band or a dual mode mobile terminal, which can be provided to both an asynchronous mobile communication service and a synchronous mobile communication service, and comprises a synchronous modem that is a module for the<br><br>
11<br>
WO 2005/112306	PCT/KR2005/000676<br>
asynchronous mobile communication service, an asynchronous modem that is a<br>
module for the asynchronous mobile communication service, and a common module,<br>
and can establish a wireless connection to the asynchronous mobile communication<br>
system (20) and a synchronous mobile communication system (30) respectively to use<br>
voice and data services. In addition, the mobile terminal (10) includes a timer<br>
according to the present invention. When it receives a handover instruction, the mobile<br>
terminal (10) actuates the timer, which is set to a predetermined time, as will be<br>
explained in more detail, and when the set time of the timer expires, the mobile<br>
terminal (10) switches a vocoder thereof.<br>
[42]        The asynchronous mobile communication system (20) comprises node B as a base<br>
           station for a radio section and a radio network controller for controlling the node B<br>
           (node B/RNC, 210), an asynchronous switching center (MSC, 220) which connects to<br>
           the radio network controller (210) to perform a call switching for providing services to<br>
           the mobile terminal (10), SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node, 230) which is<br>
           connected between a radio network controller (RNC) and a general packet radio<br>
           service (GPRS) to keep track of the location of the mobile terminal (10) and control an<br>
           access and perform a security function, and GGSN (Gateway GPRS Support Node,<br>
           250) which is coupled via the SGSN (230) and GPRS (General Packet Radio Service)<br>
           network (240) and is connected to an IP network (70) to support an interworking/in-<br>
           teroperability function unit with an external packet.<br>
[43]	In addition, the synchronous mobile communication system (30) comprises a base<br>
           station which supports a radio section with the mobile terminal (10) and a base station<br>
           controller (BTS/BSC, 310), a switching center (MSC, 320) for being connected to at<br>
           least one base station terminal to perform a call switching, a packet data service node<br>
           (PDSN, 330) for being connected to the base station controller (BSC) to provide a<br>
            packet data service to a subscriber, and a data core network (DCN, 340) for supporting<br>
            a connection between IP networks (70).<br>
[44]	The asynchronous switching center (220) and the synchronous switching center<br>
             (320) are also interconnected to No. 7 common signaling network (40) to be thereby<br>
             connected to a dual stack home location register (D-HLR, 50), and the dual stack home<br>
             register (50) stores and manages the asynchronous mobile communication system sub-<br>
             scription information of the DBDM mobile terminal (10) and the synchronous mobile<br>
             communication system subscription information corresponding thereto, and allows the<br>
             asynchronous and synchronous switching centers (220, 230) to refer to the information<br>
             at the time of performing services such as a handover.<br>
[45]	In the network as described above, the mobile terminal (10), which is using a voice<br>
            call in the asynchronous mobile communication system (20) area, measures a signal       <br>
            strength with the node B, which is currently connected thereto, and a signal strength,<br><br>
WO 2005/112306                                                  12	PCT/KR2005/000676<br>
which is transmitted to and received from a neighbor base station, and reports the measurement result to the node B, and when the signal strength with the node B is lowered below a predetermined threshold value, the node B reports to the asynchronous switching center (220) through the radio network controller (RNC) that a handover event has occurred. At this time, the node B/RNC (210) transmits the neighbor cell information and the base station ID, which the mobile terminal (10) detected, to the asynchronous switching center (220).<br>
[46]	When a handover request message is received from the radio network controller<br>
(RNC), the asynchronous switching center (220) determines whether the handover request message is a handover between neighbor cells in the asynchronous mobile communication system (20) or a handover to the synchronous mobile communication system (30), with reference to the neighbor cell information and the base station ID which it received from the radio network controller (RNC).<br>
[47]	When the handover request message is a handover between neighbor cells in the<br>
asynchronous mobile communication system (20), the asynchronous switching center (220) performs a handover to a neighbor cell, and when the handover request message is a handover to the synchronous mobile communication system (30), the asynchronous switching center (220) performs a handover to the synchronous switching center (320). To this end, the asynchronous switching center (220) switches an asynchronous message to a synchronous message and transmits the synchronous message to the synchronous switching center (320), and the asynchronous switching center (220) must previously construct the synchronous mobile communication system information to database and manage the database.<br>
[48]	Hereinbelow, the inter-system handover processes in the system shown in FIG. 1<br>
will be specifically described with reference to FIGs. 2 and 3.<br>
[49]	Referring to FIGs. 2 and 3, as the mobile terminal (10), which is using a voice call<br>
in the asynchronous mobile communication system (20) area, moves to the synchronous mobile communication system (30) area, the mobile terminal (10) senses signals from the synchronous mobile communication system (30), and periodically measures the signal strength from the node B of the asynchronous mobile communication system (20) and the signal strength with a neighbor cell (or the node B) and reports the measurement result to the node B. Accordingly, when the node B, which is currently connected to the mobile terminal (10), identifies that the signal strength between the mobile terminal (10) and the node B is less than a predetermined value, the node B requests a handover (IU Reloc Required) to the asynchronous switching center (220) through the radio network controller (RNC) (S101).<br>
[50]	The handover request message (IU Reloc Required) includes a handover-related<br>
message which is used in the synchronous mobile communication system. In addition,<br><br>
13<br>
WO 2005/112306	PCT/KR2005/000676<br>
the RNC transmits the neighbor base station information, the neighbor cell information, etc. which were received from the mobile terminal (10), and the asynchronous switching center (220) determines whether the handover request message is a handover between neighbor cells in the asynchronous mobile communication system or a handover to the synchronous mobile communication system (30) according to the information.<br>
[51]	The asynchronous switching center (220), which received the handover request<br>
message, instructs a handover to the synchronous switching center (Facilities Directives2) (SI02), and the synchronous switching center (320) requests a handover to the base station controller/base station (310) (Handoff Request) (S103).<br>
[52]	Here, the asynchronous switching center (220) generates a billing ID before<br>
transmitting a handover instruction message (Facilities Directive2) to the synchronous switching center (320) to include the billing ID into the handover instruction message (Facilities Directive2), and transmits the handover instruction message including the internal switching center circuit ID for each handover interval. Here, the billing ID includes the ID information of the synchronous switching center (320) to be connected to the asynchronous switching center (220)<br>
[53]	The base station/base station controller (310), which received the handover request<br>
from the synchronous switching center (320), transmits NULL frames to the synchronous modem of the mobile terminal (10) via a forward traffic channel (Null Forward Traffic Channel) frames so that a forward channel is assigned (SI04), and then the base station/base station controller (310) transmits a response message (Handoff Request Ack) with respect to the handover request to the synchronous switching center (320). In addition, the synchronous switching center (320) transmits a response message (Facilities Directive2 Ack) with respect to the handover instruction to the asynchronous switching center (220). Accordingly, a trunk is set between the asynchronous switching center (220) and the synchronous switching center (220).<br>
[54]	More specifically, the asynchronous switching center (220) sets a mapping between<br>
a dedicated channel that is a logical trunk setting identifier and a physical trunk, and sets the information to the internal switching center circuit ID (InterMSCCircuitID) of the handover request message (Facilities Directive2) to be transmitted to the synchronous switching center (320), and when the response message (Facilities Directive2 Ack) is transmitted from the synchronous switching center (320), the trunk is set between the asynchronous switching center (220) and the synchronous switching center (320). The handover request message (Facilities Directive2), which is received and transmitted between the asynchronous switching center (220) and the synchronous switching center (320), includes a parameter including a billing ID, ESN, an internal switching center circuit ID, MTN, etc., and the response message (Facilities Directive2<br><br>
14<br><br>
WO 2005/112306<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000676<br><br>
Ack) includes a parameter such as CDMA channel data, CDMA channel lists, etc.<br>
[55]	As such, as the trunk is set between the asynchronous switching center (220) and<br>
the synchronous switching center (320), the asynchronous switching center (220) reports to the node B/RNC (210) that the resource assignment for the handover has been completed (IU Relocation Command) (SI07), and the node B/RNC (210), which received the report, requests the mobile terminal (10) to perform a handover to the asynchronous modem (Handover from UTRAN Command) (SI08).<br>
[56]	Then, the asynchronous modem of the mobile terminal (10) transmits channel<br>
assignment information to the synchronous modem (Channel Assignment) (SI09), and after the synchronous modem of the mobile terminal (10) transmits a frame or a preamble to the base station/base station controller (310) of the synchronous mobile communication system through a reverse traffic channel (Reverse Traffic Channel Frames of Traffic Channel Preamble) (S110), the synchronous modem reports that the handover has been completed (Handoff Completion Message) (SI 11). The base station/base station controller (310), which received the report, transmits a response signal thereto (BS Ack Order) (SI 12). Then, the synchronous modem reports to the asynchronous modem that the connection with the synchronous mobile communication system has been completed (Call Connection) (SI 13).<br>
[57]	Now, the synchronous modem of the mobile terminal (10) switches a vocoder after<br>
the step (SI 13) in which the connection with the synchronous mobile communication system has been completed. In doing so, since a silent period occurs until the mobile communication system reaches the timing of switching the vocoder, according to the present invention, the mobile terminal (10) actuates the timer, which is set to a predetermined time, so that the vocoder of the mobile terminal (10) can be switched at the timing of switching the vocoder of the mobile communication system.<br>
[58]	Meanwhile, the base station/base station controller (310) reports to the synchronous<br>
switching center (320) that the handover has been completed (Handoff Complete) (S115), and the synchronous switching center (320) reports to the asynchronous switching center (220) that the handover has been completed (Mobile On Channel) (SI 16).<br>
[59]	The timing of switching the vocoder of the mobile communication system is im-<br>
plemented after the step (SI 16) of the synchronous switching center (320) reporting to the synchronous switching center (220) that the handover has been completed. According to the present invention, after the synchronous modem of the mobile terminal (10) reports to the asynchronous modem that the handover has been completed, the asynchronous switching center (220) actuates the timer during the time of reporting that the handover has been completed in the synchronous switching center (320), and when the timer operation is completed, the vocoder of the mobile terminal<br><br>
WO 2005/112306                                            15	PCT/KR2005/000676<br>
              (10) is switched (SI 17) and at the same time the vocoder of the mobile communication<br>
              system is also switched (SI 18).<br>
[60]	By doing so, the mobile terminal (10) and the vocoder of the mobile com-<br>
               munication system are switched simultaneously, so that the occurrence of the silent<br>
               period is minimized.<br>
[61]	Subsequently, the asynchronous switching center (220) requests the node B/RNC to<br>
release the connection, and as the asynchronous switching center (220) receives a response thereto, the connection between the asynchronous switching center (220) and the node B/RNC (IU Release Command, IU Release Complete) (SI 19, S120) is released.<br>
[62]	Then, after the handover from the mobile terminal (10), which is during a voice call<br>
in the asynchronous mobile communication system, to the synchronous mobile communication system (320) has been completed, the call is released upon request of either of the two mobile terminals during a call. The mobile terminal of a subscriber in the asynchronous mobile communication system area may first request the call release, or the mobile terminal of a subscriber who handed over to the synchronous mobile communication system area may first request the call release.<br>
[63]	If the mobile terminal in the asynchronous mobile communication system area<br>
releases the call, the asynchronous switching center (220) transmits a call release request message (Facilities Release) to the synchronous switching center (320), and the synchronous switching center (320), which received the message, responds to the message (Facilities Ack), so that the trunk, which is set between the switching centers, is released.<br>
[64]	SECOND EMBODIMENT:<br>
[65]	FIG. 4 shows another embodiment of a mobile communication system to which the<br>
present invention is applied and in which an asynchronous mobile communication system and a synchronous mobile communication system co-exist.<br>
[66]	FIGs. 5 and 6 are flow charts showing the inter-system handover processes in the<br>
mobile communication system shown in FIG. 4 according to another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[67]	In FIG. 4, since reference numbers indicate the identical elements as FIG. 1, they<br>
need not be described in greater detail herein.<br>
[68]	Referring to FIG. 4, the switching centers (260, 360) of the asynchronous mobile<br>
communication system (20) and the synchronous mobile communication system (30), unlike FIG. 1, are interconnected to each other by the interworking/interoperability function unit, and the interworking/interoperability function unit (60) transforms an asynchronous message transmitted from the asynchronous switching center (260) into a synchronous message, transmits the synchronous message to the synchronous<br><br>
16<br>
WO 2005/112306	PCT/KR2005/000676<br>
           switching center (360), and constructs and manages the synchronous mobile com<br>
           munication information to database. (Interworking Interoperability Function; IIF, 60)<br>
[69]	In such network configuration, the mobile terminal (10), which is using a voice call<br>
            in the asynchronous mobile communication system (20) area, periodically measures a<br>
            signal strength with the node B and a signal strength with a neighbor base station, and<br>
            reports the measurement result to the node B. When the signal strength is lowered to<br>
            less than a predetermined threshold, the node B reports to the asynchronous switching<br>
            center (260) through the RNC that the handover event has occurred. At this time, the<br>
            node B/RNC (210) transmits the neighbor cell information, the base station ID, etc.,<br>
            which the mobile terminal (10) detected, to the asynchronous switching center (260).<br>
[70]	When the handover request message is received, from the RNC, the asynchronous<br>
             switch center (260) determines whether the handover request message is a handover<br>
             between neighbor cells in the asynchronous mobile communication system or a<br>
             handover to the synchronous mobile communication system (30), with reference to the<br>
             neighbor cell information, the base station ID, etc., which were received from the<br>
             RNC.<br>
[71]	When the handover request message is a handover between neighbor cells in the<br>
              asynchronous mobile communication system (20), the asynchronous switching center<br>
             (260) performs a handover to a neighbor cell, and when the handover request message<br>
              is a handover to the synchronous mobile communication system (30), the<br>
              asynchronous switching center (260) performs a handover to the synchronous<br>
              switching center (360) through IIF (60). To this end, the IIF (60) switches an<br>
              asynchronous message to a synchronous message and transmits the synchronous<br>
              message to the synchronous switching center (360), and the asynchronous switching<br>
              center (220) must previously construct the synchronous mobile communication system<br>
              information to database and manage the database. The database includes switching<br>
              center information, signal points, trunk information relating to dedicated channels, and<br>
              so on. The IIF (60) selects a handover objective switching center (320) according to<br>
              the handover request from the asynchronous switching center (260) and the<br>
              synchronous mobile communication system information, and generates a billing ID<br>
              including a handover objective switching center ID and so on to use it at the<br>
              subsequent handover procedures.<br>
[72]	The handover processes shown in FIG. 4 will be explain in more detail with<br>
reference to FIGs. 5 and 6 below.<br>
[73]	Referring to FIGs. 5 and 6, as the mobile terminal (10), which is using a voice call<br>
in the asynchronous mobile communication system (20) area, moves to the synchronous mobile communication system (30) area, the mobile terminal (10) senses signals from the synchronous mobile communication system (30), and periodically<br><br>
17<br>
WO 2005/112306	PCT7KR2005/000676<br>
measures the signal strength from the node B of the asynchronous mobile com<br>
munication system (20) and the signal strength with a neighbor cell (or the node B) and<br>
reports the measurement result to the node B. Accordingly, when the node B, which is<br>
currently connected to the mobile terminal (10), identifies that the signal strength<br>
between the mobile terminal (10) and the node B is less than a predetermined value,<br>
the node B requests a handover (IU Reloc Required) to the asynchronous switching<br>
center (260) via the radio network controller (IU Rloc Required) (S501).<br>
[74]	The handover request message (IU Reloc Required) includes a handover-related<br>
message which is used in the synchronous mobile communication system. In addition, the RNC transmits the neighbor base station information (base station ID), the neighbor cell information, etc. which were received from the mobile terminal (10), and the asynchronous switching center (260) determines whether the handover request message is a handover between neighbor cells in the asynchronous mobile communication system or a handover to the synchronous mobile communication system (30) according to the information. The handover request message (IU Reloc Required), which the RNC transmits to the asynchronous switching center (260), includes a message type, a handover type, a source base station controller ID, a target base station controller ID, RAD (radio Access Bearer) information, and radio section-related information.<br>
[75]	The asynchronous switching center (260), which received the handover request<br>
message, transmits an asynchronous message requesting a handover to the in-terworking/interoperability function unit (60) (MAP Prep Handover Req) (S502). At this time, the asynchronous switching center (260) adds an extension container to the asynchronous message and then transmits an asynchronous identification signal (MSISDN) of the mobile terminal (10), and the message includes the parameter such as an invoke ID, a target cell ID, a target radio network controller ID, MSISDN, etc.<br>
[76]	Then, the interworking/interoperability function unit (60) requests the dual stack<br>
home location register (50) to transmit the subscriber information with reference to the asynchronous subscriber information (MSISDN) which was received from the asynchronous switching center (260) (Call Data Request) (SI03). That is, the interworking/interoperability function unit (60) requests synchronous network identifiers (MIN, ESN) of the mobile terminal (10). At step S503, the interworking/interoperability function unit (60) may request the synchronous identifier information of the subscriber to the dual stack home location register (50) by using the asynchronous message (MAP_SEND_IMSI).<br>
[77]	The dual stack home location register (50), which received the subscriber in-<br>
formation request of the interworking/interoperability function unit (60), extracts the synchronous identifier information (MIN, ESN) of the subscriber by querying the<br><br>
WO 2005/112306                                     18	PCT7KR2005/000676<br>
database to transmit to the interworking/interoperability function unit (60) (Call Data<br>
Req Ack) (SI04). The interworking/interoperability function unit (60), which received<br>
the synchronous identifier information, instructs an handover to the synchronous<br>
switching center (360)(Facilities Directive2) (S505), and the synchronous switching<br>
center (360) requests a handover to the base station controller/base station (310)<br>
(Handoff Request) (S506). Here, the synchronous network message (Call Data<br>
Request) requesting the synchronous identifier information of the subscriber includes a<br>
parameter such as a billing ID, digits (i.e., MSISDN), etc., and the response message<br>
(Call Data Req Ack) includes a parameter such as ESN, MIN, MSCID, etc.<br>
[78]	Meanwhile, when the asynchronous message (MAP_SEND-IMSI) is used to<br>
           request the synchronous network identifier information of the subscriber, the parameter<br>
           included in the asynchronous message include an invoke ID, MSISDN, IMSI, ESN,<br>
           etc.<br>
[79]	Here, the interworking/interoperability function unit (60) generates a billing ID<br>
            before transmitting a handover instruction message (Facilities Directive2) to the<br>
            synchronous switching center (360) to include the billing ID into the handover ins<br>
            truction message (Facilities Directive2), and transmits the handover instruction<br>
            message including the internal switching center circuit ID for each handover interval.<br>
            Here, the billing ID includes the ID information of the synchronous switching center<br>
            (360) to be connected to the asynchronous switching center (260)<br>
[80]	The base station/base station controller (310), which received the handover request<br>
             from the synchronous switching center (320), transmits NULL frames to the<br>
             synchronous modem of the mobile terminal (10) through a forward traffic channel<br>
            (Null Forward Traffic Channel frames) so that a forward channel is assigned (S507),<br>
             and then the base station/base station controller (310) transmits a response message<br>
            (Handoff Request Ack) with respect to the handover request to the synchronous<br>
             switching center (320) (S508). In addition, the synchronous switching center (320)<br>
             transmits a response message (Facilities Directive2 Ack) with respect to the handover<br>
             instruction to the interworking/interoperability function unit (60) (S509), and the in<br>
             terworking/interoperability function unit (60) transmits a response message (MAP Prep<br>
             Handover Resp) with respect to the handover request at step S502 to the asynchronous<br>
             switching center (S510). Accordingly, a trunk is set between the asynchronous<br>
             switching center (260) and the synchronous switching center (360).<br>
[81]	More specifically, the interworking/interoperability function unit (60) sets a<br>
mapping between a dedicated channel that is a logical trunk setting identifier and a physical trunk, and sets the information to the internal switching center circuit ID (InterMSCCircuitID) of the handover request message (Facilities Directive2) to be transmitted to the synchronous switching center (360), and when the response message<br><br>

             (Facilities Directive2 Ack) is transmitted from the synchronous switching center (360),<br>
             the trunk is set between the asynchronous switching center (260) and the synchronous<br>
             switching center (320). The handover request message (Facilities Directive2), which is<br>
             transmitted between the interworking/interoperability function unit (60) and the<br>
             synchronous switching center (360), includes a parameter such as a billing ID, ESN, an<br>
             internal switching center circuit ID, MIN, etc., and the response message (Facilities<br>
             Directive2 Ack) includes a parameter such as CDMA channel data, CDMA channel<br>
             lists, etc.<br>
[82]	As such, as the trunk is set between the asynchronous switching center (260) and<br>
              the synchronous switching center (360), the asynchronous switching center (220)<br>
              reports to the node B/RNC (210) that the resource assignment for the handover has<br>
              been completed (IU Relocation Command) (S511), and the node B/RNC (210), which<br>
              received the report, requests the mobile terminal (10) to perform a handover to the<br>
              asynchronous modem (Handover from UTRAN Command) (S512). Here, the message<br>
              (IU Relocation Command) reporting that the resource assignment has been completed<br>
               includes a parameter such as a message type, an RRC container, an RAB list to be<br>
               released, etc.<br>
[83]	Thereafter, the asynchronous modem of the mobile terminal (10) transmits channel<br>
                assignment information to the synchronous modem (Channel Assignment) (S513), and<br>
                the interworking/interoperability function unit (60) requests an access signal (MAP<br>
                Process Access Signaling Req) to the asynchronous switching center (260) (S514), the<br>
                access signal including an invoke ID, an application protocol data unit (APDU),<br>
                selected wireless resource information, etc.<br>
[84]	Then, the asynchronous modem of the mobile terminal (10) transmits channel<br>
                 assignment information to the synchronous modem (Channel Assignment) (S515), and<br>
                after the synchronous modem of the mobile terminal (10) transmits a frame or a<br>
                preamble to the base station/base station controller (310) of the synchronous mobile<br>
                communication system through a reverse traffic channel (Reverse Traffic Channel<br>
                Frames of Traffic Channel Preamble) (S110), the synchronous modem reports that the<br>
                handover has been completed (Handoff Completion Message) (Sill). The base<br>
                station/base station controller (310), which received the report, transmits a response<br>
                signal thereto (BS Ack Order) (SI 12). Accordingly, the connection between the<br>
                synchronous modem of the mobile terminal and the synchronous mobile com<br>
                munication system has been completed, and the synchronous modem of the mobile<br>
                terminal reports to the asynchronous modem that the connection with the synchronous<br>
                mobile communication system has been completed (Call Connection) (S518).<br>
[85]	Now, the synchronous modem of the mobile terminal (10) switches a vocoder after<br>
 step S518 in which the connection with the synchronous mobile communication<br><br>

                 system has been completed. In doing so, since a silent period occurs until the mobile<br>
                 communication system reaches the timing of switching the vocoder, according to the<br>
                 present invention, the mobile terminal (10) actuates the timer, which is set to a pre<br>
                determined time, so that the vocoder of the mobile terminal (10) can be switched at the<br>
                 time of switching the vocoder of the mobile communication system (S519).<br>
[86]	 Meanwhile, the base station/base station controller (310) reports to the synchronous<br>
                 switching center (320) that the handover has been completed (Handoff Complete)<br>
                 (SI 15), and the synchronous switching center (320) reports to the asynchronous<br>
                  switching center (220) that the handover has been completed (Mobile On Channel)<br>
                 (SI 16).<br>
[87]	 The timing of switching the vocoder of the mobile communication system is im-<br>
                  plemented after step S521 in which the synchronous switching center (320) reports to<br>
                  the synchronous switching center (260) that the handover has been completed.<br>
                  According to the present invention, after the synchronous modem of the mobile<br>
                  terminal (10) reports to the asynchronous modem that the handover has been<br>
                  completed, the asynchronous switching center (220) actuates the timer during the time<br>
                 of reporting that the handover has been completed in the synchronous switching center<br>
                 (320), and when the timer operation is completed, the vocoder of the mobile terminal<br>
                 (10) is switched (S522) and at the same time the vocoder of the mobile communication<br>
                  system is also switched (S523).<br>
[88]	  By doing so, the mobile terminal (10) and the vocoder of the mobile com-<br>
                 munication system are switched simultaneously, so that the occurrence of the silent<br>
                 period is minimized.<br>
[89]	Thereafter, the interworking/interoperability function unit (60) requests the<br>
                 asynchronous switching center (260) to release the connection (MAP Send End Signal<br>
                 Req) (S524), so that the connection between the asynchronous switching center (260)<br>
                 and the node B/RNC is released (IU Release Command, IU Release Complete) (525,<br>
                 S526).<br>
[90]	Then, after the handover from the mobile terminal (10), which is during a voice call<br>
                 in the asynchronous mobile communication system, to the synchronous mobile com<br>
                 munication system has been completed according to the above-described steps, the call<br>
                 is released upon request of either of the two mobile terminals which are during a call.<br>
                The call release may be requested firstly from the mobile terminal of a subscriber in<br>
                 the asynchronous mobile communication system area, or it may be requested first from<br>
                 the mobile terminal of a subscriber who handed over to the synchronous mobile com<br>
                 munication system area.<br>
[91]	 If the mobile terminal in the asynchronous mobile communication system area<br>
  releases the call, the asynchronous switching center (260) transmits a call release<br><br>

Here, the call release request message (Facilities Release) includes a parameter such as an internal MSC circuit ED, a release cause, a billing ID, MEN, etc., and the response message (Facilities Ack) includes a parameter such as a billing ID, etc.<br>

[93]	THIRD EMBODIMENT:<br>
[94]	FTGs. 7 and 8 are flow charts showing the inter-system handover procedures in the<br>
               mobile communication network shown in FIG. 3 according to another embodiment of<br>
               the present invention, wherein the asynchronous switching center and the synchronous<br>
               switching center are interconnected by the interworking/interoperability function unit,<br>
               and the ISUP, which is a message transfer protocol between the switching centers, is<br>
               used.<br>
[95]	As the mobile terminal (20), which is using a voice call in the asynchronous mobile<br>
                communication system (30) area, moves to the synchronous mobile communication<br>
                system (30) area, the mobile terminal (10) senses signals from the synchronous mobile<br>
                communication system (30), and periodically measures a signal strength from the node<br>
                B of the asynchronous mobile communication system (20) and the signal strength with<br>
                a neighbor cell (or the node B) and reports the measurement result to the node B.<br>
                Thereafter, when the node B, which is currently connected to the mobile terminal (10),<br>
                identifies that a signal strength between the mobile terminal (10) and the node B is less<br>
                than a predetermined value, the node B requests a handover (IU Reloc Required) to the<br>
                asynchronous switching center (260) through the radio network controller (RNC)<br>
                (S601).<br>
[96]	The handover request message (IU Reloc Required) includes a handover-related<br>
  message which is used in the synchronous mobile communication system. In addition,         <br>
  the RNC transmits the neighbor base station information, the neighbor cell information   <br>
  (base station ID), etc., which were received from the mobile terminal (1-0), and the <br>
  asynchronous switching center (260) determines whether the handover request message <br>
  is a handover between neighbor cells in the asynchronous mobile communication  <br>
  system or a handover to the synchronous mobile communication system (30) according <br>
  to the information. The handover message (IU Reloc Required), which the RNC <br>
  transmits to the asynchronous switching center (260), includes a parameter such as a <br>
  message type, a handover type, a handover cause, a source base station controller ID, a <br>
  target base station controller ID, RAB (Radio Access Bearer) information, and radio <br>
  section-related information. In addition, the RNC further includes<br><br>
WO 2005/112306                                                   22	PCT/KR2005/000676<br>
                    Old BSS To New BSS Information parameter included in the handover request<br>
                    message including the handover-related information used in the synchronous mobile<br>
                    communication system.<br>
[97]	  The asynchronous switching center (260), which received the handover request<br>
       message, transmits an asynchronous message requesting for a handover to the in-              <br>
terworking/interoperability function unit (60) (MAP Prep Handover Req) (S602). At this time, the asynchronous switching center (260) adds an extension container to the asynchronous message and transmits the asynchronous identification number (MSISDN) of the mobile terminal (10), and the asynchronous message includes a parameter such as an invoke ID, a target cell ID, a target radio controller ID, MSISDN, etc.<br>
[98]	Thereafter, the interworking/interoperability function unit (60) requests the dual<br>
stack home location register (50) to transmit the subscriber information with reference to the asynchronous subscriber information (MSISDN), which was received from the asynchronous switching center (260) (Call Data Request) (S603). That is, the interworking/interoperability function unit (60) requests for the asynchronous identifiers (MTN, ESN) of the mobile terminal (10). At step SI 03, the interworking/interoperability function unit (60) may request the synchronous network identifier information of the subscriber to the dual stack home location register (50) by using the asynchronous message (MAP_SEND-IMSI).<br>
[99]	The dual stack home location register, which received the subscriber information<br>
request from the interworking/interoperability function unit (60), queries the database and extracts the synchronous network identifier information (MIN, ESN) of the corresponding subscriber and then transmit it to the interworking/interoperability function unit (60) (Call Data Req Ack) (S604). Here, the synchronous network message (Call Data Request) requesting for the synchronous network information of the subscriber includes a parameter such as a billing ID, digits (i.e., MSISDN), etc., and the response message (Call Data Req Act) includes a parameter such as ESN, MIN, MSCID, etc. Meanwhile, when the asynchronous message (MSP_SEND_IMSI) is used to request the synchronous network identifier information of the subscriber, the parameter included in the message includes an invoke ID, MSISDN, IMSI, ESN, etc.<br>
[100]	The interworking/interoperability function unit (60), which received the subscriber<br>
information from the dual stack home location register (50), instructs the synchronous switching center (360) to perform a handover (Facilities Directives2) (S105), and the synchronous switching center (360) requests a handover to the base station controller/ base station (310) (Handoff Request) (S606).<br>
[101]	As such, the interworking/interoperability function unit (60) generates a billing ID<br>
before transmitting a handover instruction message (Facilities Directive.2) to the<br><br>
WO 2005/112306                                                23	PCT/KR2005/000676<br>
           synchronous switching center (360) to include the billing ID into the handover in<br>
           struction message (Facilities Directive2), and transmits the handover instruction<br>
           message including the internal switching center circuit ID for each handover interval.<br>
            Here, the billing ID includes the ID information of the synchronous switching center<br>
            (360) to be connected to the asynchronous switching center (260)<br>
[102]	The base station/base station controller (310), which received the handover request<br>
             from the synchronous switching center (320), transmits NULL frames to the<br>
             synchronous modem of the mobile terminal (10) via a forward traffic channel (Null<br>
             Forward Traffic Channel frames) so that a forward channel is assigned (S607), and<br>
             then the base station/base station controller (310) transmits a response message<br>
            (Handoff Request Ack) with respect to the handover request to the synchronous<br>
             switching center (320) (S608). In addition, the switching center (320) transmits a<br>
             response message (Facilities Directive2 Ack) with respect to the handover instruction<br>
             to the interworking/interoperability function unit (60), and the interworking/interop-<br>
             erability function unit (60) transmits a response message (MAP Prep Handover Resp)<br>
             with respect to the handover request at step S602 to the asynchronous switching center<br>
             (260) (S610). Accordingly, a trunk is set between the asynchronous switching center<br>
             (260) and the synchronous switching center (360).<br>
[103]	More specifically, the interworking/interoperability function unit (60) sets a<br>
               mapping between a dedicated channel that is a logical trunk setting identifier and a<br>
               physical trunk, and sets the information to the internal switching center circuit ID<br>
              (InterMSCCircuitED) of the handover request message (Facilities Directive2) to be<br>
              transmitted to the synchronous switching center (360), and when the response message<br>
              (Facilities Directive2 Ack) is transmitted from the synchronous switching center (360),<br>
               the trunk is set between the asynchronous switching center (260) and the synchronous<br>
               switching center (360). The handover request message (Facilities Directive2), which is<br>
               transmitted between the asynchronous switching center (220) and the synchronous<br>
               switching center (320), includes a parameter including a billing ID, ESN, an internal<br>
               switching center circuit ID, MIN, etc., and the response message (Facilities Directive2<br>
               Ack) includes a parameter such as CDMA channel data, CDMA channel lists, etc.<br>
[104]	Then, the asynchronous switching center (260) transmits IAM (Initial Address<br>
               Message) to the interworking/interoperability function unit (60), and interworking/<br>
               interoperability function unit (60) transmits an ACM (Address complete message) with<br>
               respect to the IAM, so that a trunk is set between the asynchronous switching center<br>
               (260) and the synchronous switching center (360), whereby a call is routed (S611). The<br>
               message for setting the trunk between the switching centers is transmitted by ISUP.<br>
[105]	As such, as the trunk is set between the asynchronous switching center (220) and<br>
 the synchronous switching center (320), the asynchronous switching center (220)<br><br>
WO 2005/112306                                             24	PCT/KR2005/000676<br>
              reports to the node B/RNC (210) that the resource assignment for the handover has<br>
              been completed (IU Relocation Command) (SI07), and the node B/RNC (210), which<br>
              received the report, requests the mobile terminal (10) to perform a handover to the<br>
              asynchronous modem (Handover from UTRAN Command) (SI08). Here, the message<br>
              (IU Relocation Command) reporting that the resource assignment has been completed<br>
               includes a parameter such as a message type, an RRC container, an RAB list to be<br>
               released, etc.<br>
[106]	Thereafter, the asynchronous modem of the mobile terminal transmits the channel7<br>
              assignment information to the synchronous modem (Channel Assignment) (SI 15), and<br>
              the interworking/interoperability function unit (60) requests an access signal to the<br>
              asynchronous switching center (260) (MAP Process Access Signaling Req) (SI 16).<br>
              The access signal includes an invoke ID, an application protocol data unit (APDU),<br>
               selected wireless resource information, etc.<br>
[107]	  In addition, the synchronous modem of the mobile terminal (10) transmits a frame<br>
                or a preamble to the base station/base station controller (310) of the synchronous<br>
                mobile communication system via a reverse traffic channel (Reverse Traffic Channel<br>
                Frames of Traffic Channel Preamble) (S617), and reports that the handover has been<br>
                completed (Handoff complete message) (S618). The base station/base station<br>
                controller (310), which received the report, transmits a response signal thereto (BS Ack<br>
                Order) (S619). Then, the synchronous modem reports to the asynchronous modem that<br>
                the connection with the synchronous mobile communication system has been<br>
                completed (Call Connection) (S620).<br>
[108]	 Now, the synchronous modem of the mobile terminal (10) switches a vocoder after<br>
                 the step (S620) in which the connection with the synchronous mobile communication<br>
                system has been completed. In doing so, since a silent period occurs until the mobile<br>
                communication system reaches the time of switching the vocoder, according to the<br>
                present invention, the mobile terminal (10) actuates the timer which is set to a pre<br>
                determined time, so that the vocoder of the mobile terminal (10) can be switched at the<br>
                 timing of switching the vocoder of the mobile communication system (S621).<br>
[ 109]	 Meanwhile, the base station/base station controller (310) reports to the synchronous<br>
                 switching center (320) that the handover has been completed (Handoff Complete)<br>
                 (SI 15), and the synchronous switching center (320) reports to the asynchronous<br>
                  switching center (220) that the handover has been completed (Mobile On Channel)<br>
                  (SI 16).<br>
[110]	The timing of switching the vocoder of the mobile communication system is im-<br>
plemented after step SI 16 in which the synchronous switching center (220) is reported by the synchronous switching center (320) that the handover has been completed. According to the present invention, after the synchronous modem of the mobile<br><br>
WO 2005/112306                                                  25	PCT/KR2005/000676<br>
                terminal (10) reports to the asynchronous modem that the handover has been<br>
                completed, the asynchronous switching center (220) actuates the timer during the time<br>
                of reporting that the handover has been completed in the synchronous switching center<br>
                (320), and when the timer operation is completed, the vocoder of the mobile terminal<br>
                (10) is switched (SI 17) and at the same time the vocoder of the mobile communication<br>
                system is also switched (SI 18).<br>
[111]	 By doing so, the mobile terminal (10) and the vocoder of the mobile com-<br>
                 munication system are switched simultaneously, so that the occurrence of the silent<br>
                 period is minimized.<br>
[112]	Then, the interworking/interoperability function unit (60) requests the asynchronous<br>
                  switching center (260) to release the connection (MAP Send End Signal Req) (S626),<br>
                  transmits to the asynchronous switching center (260) a message reporting that the<br>
                 synchronous switching center (360) has been connected with the mobile terminal<br>
                 (ANSWER) (S627), and the connection between the asynchronous switching center<br>
                 (260) and Node B/RNC is released (IU Release Command, IU Release Complete)<br>
                 (S628, S629).<br>
[113]	 Then, after the handover from the mobile terminal (10), which is during a voice call<br>
                  in the asynchronous mobile communication system, to the synchronous mobile com<br>
                  munication system (320) has been completed, the call is released upon request of either<br>
                  of the two mobile terminals during a call. The call release may be requested firstly<br>
                  from the mobile terminal of a subscriber in the asynchronous mobile communication<br>
                  system area, or it may be requested first from the mobile terminal of a subscriber<br>
                  which handed over to the synchronous mobile communication system area. The<br>
                   present embodiment will explain the case where the mobile terminal of a subscriber in<br>
                   the asynchronous mobile communication system area requests a call release,<br>
[114]	 As the call of the mobile terminal is released, the call between the asynchronous<br>
    switching center (260) and the synchronous switching center (360) is released (Call      <br>
    Release) (S630), and the connection between the switching centers is released  <br>
    (Release) (S631). Thereafter, the asynchronous switching center (260) reports to the  <br>
     interworking/interoperability function unit (60) that the connection release has been  <br>
     completed (MAP Send End Signal Resp) (S632), the interworking/interoperability  <br>
     function unit (60) transmits a call release request message (Facilities Release) to the <br>
     synchronous switching center (360), and the synchronous switching center (360) <br>
     responds to the call release request message (Facilities Ack), so that the trunk, which  <br>
     is set between the switching centers, is released (S634). Here, the call release request <br>
     message (Facilities Release) includes a parameter such as an internal MSC circuit ID, <br>
     release causes, a billing ED, MTN, etc., and the response message (Facilities Ack) <br>
     includes a parameter such as a billing ID, etc.<br><br>
WO 2005/112306	PCT/KR2005/000676<br>
[115]	According to the present invention, the asynchronous switching center determines<br>
whether the call release message is a handover in the asynchronous mobile communication system or a handover to the synchronous mobile communication system. In addition, when it is identified as a handover to the synchronous mobile communication system, the asynchronous switching center performs the handover by using the in-terworking/interoperability function unit (TIF) as a converter while transmitting to and receiving from the switching center of the synchronous mobile communication system. To do this, the interworking/interoperability function unit must previously construct the synchronous mobile communication system information to database and store the database.<br>
[116]	     Furthermore, in order to resolve the problem that a silent period occurs until the<br>
mobile communication system switches the vocoder after the mobile terminal switches the vocoder, the present invention switches the vocoders of the mobile communication system and the mobile terminal simultaneously to minimize the silent period at the time of a handover during a voice call.<br>

preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention encompassed by the appended claims.<br><br>
