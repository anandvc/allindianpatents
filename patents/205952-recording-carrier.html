COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See section 10]<br>
RECORDING CARRIER;<br>
TRUB AG, A CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF SWITZERLAND, WHOSE ADDRESS IS HINTERE BAHNHOFSTRASSE 12, 5001 AARAU, SWITZERLAND;<br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY	DESCRIBES	AND<br>
ASCERTAINS THE NATURE OF THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFOMED.<br>
  GRANTED<br>
29-4-2005<br><br>
Recording carrier<br>
The invention relates to a recording carrier, in particular a credit or ID card, with an upper layer, which has on its outer side a plurality of lenticular lenses and on its rear side a representational element, which movably appears when the recording carrier is tilted about at least one axis.<br>
Recording carriers of this type have long been known. Credit and ID cards and, in particular, national identity cards, are subject to the risk of being falsified by fraudsters, with even technically advanced equipment being used. Such cards must therefore be protected against falsification. This takes place in particular by security elements, which are provided on the recording carrier and are extremely difficult to falsify even with great effort. Since, however, the methods of falsification are continually improving, it is necessary for new security features which additionally impede falsification constantly to be made available. These security features must be designed in such a way that they are suitable for mass production and do not adversely affect the requirements for functional properties. In the prior art, numerous such security elements are already known. They are, for example, holograms, embossings or representations machined by a laser. To increase security, guilloches are additionally used, or the cards are produced with materials which are not readily obtainable.<br><br><br>
The invention is based on the object of providing a recording carrier of the stated type which has greater security against falsification and can be checked quickly and without aids by the appropriate officials (customs, border control, police). The object is achieved by a recording carrier according to claim 1.<br>
Cards with optical systems having lenticular lenses are known per se. However, so far these systems have only been used for advertising, entertainment and for teaching means. Consequently, only the visual effect which can be achieved with such optical systems has been used. These cards have been produced with a lenticular film. The lenticular lenses in this case extend over the entire upper side of the cards. For example, US-6,073,854 shows what is known as a telephone card, which has a built-in chip and the upper side of which is formed by a lenticular film. Printed on the rear side of the lenticular film is an image and located on the front side of this film are the lenticular lenses, which extend over the entire surface of the card. The effect which can be achieved with such lenticular lenses also serves here merely for advertising and entertainment purposes. US-6,016,225 discloses a recording carrier which contains information on a magnetic strip and the upper side of which is provided with lenticular lenses. These lenses likewise extend here over the entire outer side and serve for the esthetic design.<br>
EP-A-0 219 012 and EP-B-0 216 947 disclose data carriers with laser engravings which are produced by means of arrays of lenticular lenses. Such laser engravings cannot be multi-colored but only produced in black-and-white.<br>
In the case of the recording carrier according to the invention, it is significant that only a partial region of the outer side is provided with lenticular lenses,<br><br><br>
and that the information is printed on in an inner layer of the card and consequently has not been subsequently introduced by laser engraving. Outside this region, the outer side is designed in the way customary per se and further security elements, such as holograms for example, are preferably provided here. It is also significant that the representational element is a security element which could be falsified only with great effort. The high security value also results in particular from the fact that not just a readily obtainable lenticular film is used for producing the recording carrier according to the invention. The uppermost layer of the recording carrier, which is provided with lenticular lenses only in certain regions, must be produced specifically and in a way technically requiring comparatively considerable effort.<br><br><br><br>
Further advantageous features emerge from the dependent patent claims, the description which follows and the drawing.<br><br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention is explained in more detail below on the basis of the drawing, in which:<br>
figure 1 shows a section through a recording carrier according to the invention,<br><br><br><br>
figure 2 shows a section through the recording carrier according to the invention along the line II-II of figure 1 and<br><br>
figure 3 shows  a view of the  front  side of the recording carrier according to the invention.<br>
The recording carrier 1 is preferably a credit or ID card, in particular a national identity card or a data page in a passport and, according to figures 1 and 2,<br><br>
such that it could only be forged with great effort, as is the case for example with security guilloches. The operating principle of the optical system 11 is known per se. For viewing the security element 8, the recording carrier 1 is tilted about the axis D indicated in figure 3 by dashed lines. As a result, the viewing angle in relation to the lenticular lenses 6 changes and the security element 8 is perceived as a moving representation. According to figure 3, the axis D runs in the longitudinal direction of the recording carrier 1, although a different alignment, for example in the diagonal direction, is also possible.<br>
The effect of the optical system 11 may be designed in a way known per se such that the movement of the security element 8 represents a rainbow. This effect is also known as the "rainbow effect". A so-called "flip effect" is also conceivable. The movement of the security element 8 is in this case manifested as an alternately visible/invisible element. A configuration in which a text, for example, according to figure 3, letters BCA BCA, alternately appears as negative or positive text is also conceivable.<br>
Apart from the aforementioned layers 2 and 3, further layers 4 and 5, which are likewise preferably films of plastic, may also be provided. The layers 3 and 4 may in this case be opaque layers. The layer 5 is preferably again transparent and forms a smooth rear side 14, onto which a coating may be applied. The layers are preferably 2-5 and some of these layers are preferably produced from polycarbonate. Polycarbonate is suitable in particular for high-value ID cards and exhibits the effect aimed for with the optical system 11 in an outstanding way.<br><br><br>
We Claim<br>
1.	A recording carrier, in particular a credit or ID card, with an upper layer (2) and also further layers (3,4,5), said upper layer having on its outer side (7) a plurality of lenticular lenses (6) and on its rear side a representational element (8), which movably appears when the recording carrier is tilted about atleast one axis (D), and the lenticular lenses (6) extending only over a partial region of said outer side (7) and the representational element (8) being a security element which is printed on an inner card layer, characterized in that the upper layer (2) with the lenticular lenses (6) arranged on it and also the other layers (3,4,5) of the recording carrier are produced from polycarbonate.<br>
2.	The recording carrier as claimed in claim 1, wherein the security element (8) is a security guilloche.<br>
3.	The recording carrier as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the movable axis (D) runs transversely or diagonally.<br>
4.	The recording carrier as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the lenticular lenses (6) and the security element (8) form an optical system (11), which produces the so called "rainbow effect" or "flip effect".<br><br>
5.	The recording carrier as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the security element (8) is alternately manifested as a visible or invisible element when tilting occurs about the axis (D).<br>
6.	The recording carrier as claimed in one of claims 1 to 5, wherein said recording carrier is a multi-layered card with atleast one layer of polycarbonate.<br>
