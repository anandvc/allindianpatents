BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention (Technical Field):<br>
The present invention relates to cyclic natriuretic peptide constructs which include a plurality of amino acid residues, one or more ring-constrained amino acid surrogates and optionally one or more prosthetic groups, which constructs bind a natriuretic peptide receptor and may be employed for therapeutic purposes.<br>
Background Art:<br>
The natriuretic peptide system has been extensively explored since the identification of the human atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) sequence and gene structure in 1984. ANP is sometimes also called "ANF", or atrial natriuretic factor. ANP is part of the natriuretic peptide system, which in humans involves an ANP gene, which through differences in posMranslational processing results in both ANP and urodilatin, a gene which produces BNP, or brain natriuretic peptide, and a gene which produces CNP, or c-type natriuretic peptide. ANP, urodilatin, BNP and CNP are each ring structures, with a 17 amino acid loop formed by a cysteine-cysteine disulfide linkage. The amino acid sequence and structure of human ANP (hANP) is shown in FIG. 1. ANP, urodilatin, BNP and CNP are closely related, differing by some five or six amino acids within the ring, though the N- and C-terminal tails are substantially different.<br>
ANP, BNP and CNP are each specific for distinct receptors, natriuretic peptide receptors A, B and C (NPRA, NPRB and NPRC). NPRA and NPRB are linked to guanylyl cyclases, while NPRC is a G-protein linked clearance receptor. ANP, BNP and CNP are the primary endogenous mammalian natriuretic peptides identified to date. However, there are a number of non-mammalian natriuretic peptides that have been identified and may have therapeutic application in mammals. These include salmon natriuretic or cardiac peptide (sCP), ventricular natriuretic peptide (VNP), a cardiac natriuretic peptide identified in eels and a variety of fish, dendroaspis natriuretic peptide (DNP), a natriuretic peptide identified in mamba snake venom, and three natriuretic-iike peptides (TNP-a, TNP-b, and TNP-c) isolated from taipan snake venom. See generally Tervonen V, Ruskoaho H, Lecklin T, lives M, Vuolteenaho O. Salmon cardiac natriuretic peptide is a volume-regulating hormone. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol.

ANP is endogenously secreted predominately in response to increased atrial pressure, but other factors,   including cytokine receptor stimulation, may contribute to endogenous secretion. Once released, ANP is a hormonal regulator of blood pressure, sodium and fluid homeostasis, providing vasorelaxant effects, affecting cardiovascular remodeling, and the like. Thus ANP, including endogenous ANP, is effective in congestive heart failure and other cardiovascular disease, in part by providing a defense against a chronically activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Circulating ANP is rapidly removed from the circulation by two mechanisms, binding to a natriuretic peptide receptor and enzymatic degradation.<br>
Human ANP is also referred to as wild-type human ANP, hANP, ANP(1-28) and ANP(99-126) (the later referring to the relevant sequence within proANP(1-126), which is normally cleaved at Arg98 - Ser" in the C-terminal region during secretion). Hereafter human ANP is sometimes referred to as "hANP."<br>
In general, natriuretic peptides and variants thereof are believed to have utility in the treatment of congestive heart failure, renal hypertension, acute kidney failure and related conditions, as well as any condition, disease or syndrome for which a diuretic, natriuretic and/or vasodilatory response would have a therapeutic or preventative effect. One review article describing natriuretic peptides, including ANP, and use of the natriuretic peptide system in heart failure is Schmitt M., Cockcroft J.R., and Frenneaux M.P. Modulation of the natriuretic peptide system in heart failure: from bench to bedside? Clinical Science 105:141-160 (2003).<br>
A large number of ANP mimetics and variations have been made, some of which are substantially reduced in size from ANP. On ANP version that is reduced in size yet is biologica/ly active is the 15-mer disulfide cyclic peptide H-Met-cyc/o(Cys-His-Phe-Gly-Gly-Arg-Met-Asp-Arg-lle-Ser-Cys)-Tyr-Arg-NH2 (SEQ ID NO:1) as described in Li B, Tom JY, Oare D, Yen R, Fairbrother WJ, Wells JA, Cunningham BC. Minimization of a polypeptide hormone. Science 270:1657-60 (1995). This 15-mer peptide is commonly referred to as "mini-ANP".<br>

Chimeric natriuretic peptides, such as a peptide call "vasonatrin peptide" and described as a chimera of ANP and CNP, are described, as in U.S. Patent 5,583,108, or in U.S. Patents 6,407,211 and 6,818,619, disclosing chimeric peptides of dendroaspis. The teachings of each of the foregoing patents and patent applications are incorporated by reference as if set forth in full.<br>
There is one natriuretic peptide product approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States, sold under the generic name nestiritide and the tradename Natrecor® (Scios Inc.).  This is a human B-<br><br><br>
type natriuretic peptide manufactured from E. coli using recombinant DNA technology. This product is approved only for intravenous infusion for treatment of patients with actutely decompensated congestive heart failure who have dyspnea at rest or with minimal activity. While effective, the pharmacokinetics and half-life of nestiritide   are such that the product can only be employed by intravenous infusion, which limits use of the drug to a hospital or skilled medical center setting.<br>
Notwithstanding the large number of compounds that have been developed, virtually none are commercialized or in active clinical development. There is a substantial need for products with improved characteristics, including improved potency, half-life, modes of administration, bioavailability or prolonged duration of effect, which products are effective for one or more therapeutic indications, and which preferably may be administered on an out-patient basis.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides natriuretic receptor-specific constructs made of a plurality of amino acid residues, at least one ring-constrained amino acid surrogate and optionally at least one prosthetic group. The ring-constrained amino acid surrogates employed in the invention are preferably such that they may be made with a conventional amino protected N-terminus, using a protecting group such as Fmoc, and a reactive carboxyl C-terminus, and may thus be employed in conventional peptide synthesis methodologies, it being understood that if the amino acid surrogate is at the C-terminus position of the construct, that other than a carboxyl terminus may be employed on such surrogate. Thus, in a preferred embodiment the invention provides synthetically made constructs, synthesized using peptide synthesis methodologies modified as appropriate, and comprising a plurality of amino acid residues and at least one ring-constrained amino acid surrogate, In a related preferred embodiment, the construct further includes at least one prosthetic group.<br>
Preferred prosthetic groups include polymeric groups comprising repeat units including one or more carbon and hydrogen atoms, and optionally other atoms, including oxygen. Such polymeric groups are preferably water-soJuble polymers, and are preferably poly(alkylene oxide), polyvinyl pyrrolidone), polyvinyl alcohol), polyoxazoline or poly(acryloylmorpholine). A preferred poly(alkylene oxide) is poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), optionally derivatized with a linking group.<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides a construct with an amino acid sequence that is a homolog of a known natriuretic peptide, such as ANP or BNP, or is a homolog of any known peptide variant of a natriuretic peptide, wherein the construct includes at least one amino acid surrogate of formula I or II. The corresponding amino acid sequence not comprising an amino acid surrogate may be identical to a known natriuretic peptide or a known peptide variant, or may be homologous thereto, such as a corresponding amino acid sequence that is<br><br><br>
at least 60% homologous, or more preferably is at least about 80% homologous. As used herein, the phrase "corresponding amino acid sequence not comprising an amino acid surrogate" means an amino acid sequence, including a known amino acid sequence, that binds to a receptor for a natriuretic peptide and that does not include a surrogate. Such known amino acid sequence is identical to the construct if the amino acid sequence is the same but for the substitution by or addition of one or more amino acid surrogates. Similarly, homology is determined by reference to identity of the known amino acid sequence to the construct but for the substitution by or addition of one or more amino acid surrogates.<br>
in another aspect, the invention provides a construct that is modeled on a known peptide which binds to a receptor for a natriuretic peptide, but which includes one or more amino acid surrogates, such surrogates being either substituted for one or more amino acid residues contained in the known peptide, or in addition to the sequence comprising the known peptide.

on the proviso that at least one of Aaa1, Aaa3 through Aaa12, Aaa14 or Aaa15 is an amino acid surrogate. A related embodiment of formula III provides a construct where one or more of Aaa1, Aaa3 to Aaa12, Aaa14 or Aaa15 is an amino acid surrogate as defined above, and where a prosthetic group, as hereafter defined, is attached to a reactive group of a side chain of an amino acid residue at one or more of Aaa1, Aaa3 to Aaa12, Aaa14 or Aaa15, to a reactive R or R' group of an amino acid surrogate at Aaa3 to Aaa12 or Aaa14, directly or through a Q group to the terminal amine of an amino acid surrogate at Aaa1, to a reactive terminal carboxyl of an amino acid surrogate at Aaa15, or to a reactive group forming a part of J of an amino acid surrogate at Aaa15. The reactive group to which the one or more prosthetic groups are covalently bonded may be a primary amine, a secondary amine, a carboxyl group, a thiol group or a hydroxyl group.In one aspect, the prosthetic group may be covalently bound to a reactive amine in position Aaa1, Aaa3, Aaa7, Aaa10, Aaa12, or Aaa15, or a combination of the foregoing. In another aspect, the prosthetic group may be covalently bound to a reactive carboxyl in position<br><br><br>
Aaa9 or Aaa15, or both.   In another aspect, the prosthetic group may be covalently bound to a reactive thiol in position Aaa3, Aaa7, Aaa9, Aaa10, Aaa11, or Aaa12, or a combination of the foregoing.<br>
In a preferred aspect of the construct of formula III, one, two or three of Aaa1 to Aaa15 (excluding Aaa2 and Aaa13) are an amino acid surrogate of one of the foregoing formulas. In a first particularly preferred aspect, one of Aaa1, Aaa5 and Aaa15 is an amino acid surrogate. In a second particularly preferred aspect, two of Aaa1, Aaa5 and Aaa15 are amino acid surrogates. In a third particularly preferred aspect, each of Aaa1, Aaa5 and Aaa15 are amino acid surrogates. In another particularly preferred aspect, one, two or three of Aaa1, Aaa5 and Aaa15 are amino acid surrogates, and the construct is a cyclic construct formed by disulfide bond formation through the side chains of Aaa2 and Aaa13. In another particularly preferred aspect, where two or more of Aaa1 to Aaa15 are amino acid surrogates the amino acid surrogates are not contiguous, which is to say that each amino acid surrogate is separate from each other amino acid surrogate by at least one amino acid residue being interposed therebetween in the primary sequence.<br>
In yet another preferred embodiment, in the construct of formula III at least one of Aaa3, Aaa5, Aaa6, Aaa7, Aaa9, Aaa10, or Aaa12 is an L- or D-isomer of Ala, preferably an L-isomer of Ala.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the invention provides a construct of formula III further comprising one or more non-peptide bonds. Non-peptide bonds may be employed to decrease the susceptibility of a construct of the invention to degradation, such as improving the in vivo stability of constructs towards tryptic-like proteases by replacing the native peptide bond before each Lys or Arg residue with a non-peptide bond, such as an isostere of an amide, a substituted amide or a peptidomimetic linkage. In one specific embodiment, native peptide bonds are replaced with peptide bonds having a reversed polarity. In general, any non-peptide bond may be employed, and may be utilized between any two residues. A non-peptide bond Includes bonds in which the carbon atom participating in the bond between two residues is reduced from a carbonyl carbon to a methylene carbon, such as a non-peptide bond its isostereor  the use of other bonds<br>
such as or an isostere of any of the foregoing, or   In<br>
general, non-peptide bonds include an imino, ester, hydrazine, semicarbazide, oxime, or azo bond.<br>
The constructs defined above may include one or more prosthetic groups. Prosthetic groups may be employed to modulate the residence time in circulation, to modulate bioavailability, modulate immunogenicity of constructs, or the like. !n general, prosthetic groups "modulate" by increasing the residence time, bioavailability or the like, as the case may be, but prosthetic groups may optionally decrease residence time, bioavailability or the like. A "prosthetic group" thus includes any compound conjugated, such as by a covalent bond, to a construct of any formula, for purposes of improving pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties of the construct. Preferred prosthetic groups include polymeric groups, comprising repeat units which in turn comprise one or more carbon and hydrogen atoms, and optionally other atoms, including oxygen atoms. Such polymeric groups are preferably water-soluble polymers, and are preferably poly(alkylene oxide), polyvinyl pyrrolidone), polyvinyl alcohol), polyoxazoline or poly(acryloylmorpholine). A preferred poly{alkylene oxide) is poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). In addition to PEG, other poly(alkylene glycol) polymers may be employed, such as polypropylene glycol) and poly(butylene glycol).<br>
In one embodiment, the prosthetic group is one or more PEG polymers covalently bound to a reactive group of the construct. The PEG polymer, or other prosthetic group, may be covalently bound to a reactive group on the side chain of one or more amino acid residues, or may be covalently bound to a reactive group on an amino acid surrogate.   Such reactive groups of an amino acid surrogate may include a group covalently<br><br><br>
bound, directly or through one or more intermediates, to Q or J, or may include a reactive group forming a part of R or R'.<br>
If PEG is employed as the prosthetic group, the PEG polymer may have a molecular weight of from about 200 MW to about 50000 MW. The PEG polymer may be linear, and if linear, may be monofunctional, with a reactive group at one end and a non-reactive group at the other end, homobifunctional, with the same reactive group at each end, or heterobifunctional, with a different reactive group at each end. Alternatively, the PEG polymer may be branched, having generally a "Y"-shaped configuration, multi-armed, such as with two, three, four or eight arms, or other configurations known in the art. The PEG polymer preferably has at least one denvatized reactive group for linking to one or more defined groups on the construct of any of formula IN through XIII, preferably by means of a covalent bond. The derivativized reactive group may link to, for example, an amine, hydroxyl, thiol, or carboxyl group on a construct, including on a terminal group of an amino acid residue, on a side chain of an amino acid residue, on a Q group of a surrogate, on a J group of a surrogate, or on an R or R' group of a surrogate.<br>
The PEG polymer preferably has, at one end, an end-cap group, such as a hydroxyl, alkoxy, substituted alkoxy, aleknoxy, substituted alkenoxy, alkynoxy, substituted alkynoxy, aryloxy or substituted aryloxy. The PEG polymer further preferably has, at at least one other end, a derivatized reactive group. In one embodiment, the PEG polymer is a linear or branched polyether with a terminal hydroxyl group, such as a monomethoxy PEG, which is derivatized with a linking group, such as an amine, maieimide or carboxylic acid. The available reactive groups of the construct dictate the derivatized linking group employed on the PEG polymer. Thus, in one embodiment, the N-terminal amine of the construct is employed, using a carboxylic acid derivatized PEG. In another embodiment, the C-terminal amine of the construct is employed, again using a carboxylic acid derivatized PEG. In yet another embodiment, if a Lys residue or homolog thereof is present in the construct, either the a or E amino group thereof may be employed, again using a carboxylic acid derivatized PEG. Maieimide derivatized PEG may be employed with either a reactive thiol or hydroxyl group on the construct. Similarly, amine derivatized PEG may be employed with a reactive carboxyl group on any terminal group or side chain of an amino acid residue, on a Q group of a surrogate, on a J group of a surrogate, or on an R or R' group of a surrogate.<br>
Thus, in one aspect, PEG is activiated with one or more electrophilic groups and may be employed for coupling to amino groups of the construct, including coupling to an z amino group of a side chain or an N-terminal or C-terminal amine. Representative electrophilic reactive groups include succinimidyl a-methylbutanoate and other a-methylbutyric acid esters, as disclosed in U.S. Patents 5,672,662 and 6,737,505, and may be be used with proteins, as disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2004/0235734. Alternatively, succinimidyl propionate may be employed as a reactive group, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,567,662, or N-hydroxysuccinimide may be employed with a branched PEG, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,932,462. The teachings of each of the foregoing patents and patent applications are incorporated by reference as if set forth in full.<br>
In another aspect, PEG polymers are provided with one or more reactive aldehyde groups, and employed for coupling to a terminal primary amine, such as an N-terminal or C-terminal amine. In another aspect, PEG polymers are provided with one or more thiol-reactive groups, such as a maieimide, ortho-pyridyldisulfide, or thiol group, and are employed for coupling to a reactive thiol in the construct of any of formula III through XIII, such as a reactive thiol in a cysteine side chain or a reactive thiol in a Q group of a construct.<br><br><br>
In one aspect, any of the methods, conjugates or schemes as disclosed in International Patent Publication No. WO 2004/047871, or any reference cited therein, may be employed with the constructs of this invention. The teaching of the foregoing patent applications is incorporated by reference as if set forth in full.<br>
In general, some form of chemical modification may be employed to make an active PEG derivative with a reactive group. The reactive group may be an active carbonate, an active ester, an aldehyde, or tresylate. In part, the reactive group of the PEG determines the amino acid terminal group or side chain moiety to which the PEG derivative is bound. In general, site specific PEGylation is preferred, in part because the resulting construct is homogeneous, minimizing loss of biological activity and reducing immunogenicity.<br>
In one embodiment, the PEG has a molecular weight of from about 200 MW to about 50,000 MW, more preferably from about 2,000 MW to about 20,000 MW. In another embodiment, monomethoxy PEG, such as of the formula where n is any integer from 2 to about<br>
1200, is employed, preferably derlvatized with an amine, maleimide or carboxylic acid linking group.<br>
In another embodiment, the prosthetic group, such as PEG, is conjugated to a construct by means of an enzymatically labile linker as described in Veronese FM and Pasut G. Pegylation, successful approach to drug delivery. Drug Discovery Today 10:1451-1458 (2005), and the methods disclosed therein are incorporated here by reference.<br>
In another embodiment, the prosthetic group employed is a polymer with both a lipophilic moiety and a hydrophilic polymer moiety, as disclosed in U.S. Patents 5,359,030 and 5,681,811. In a related embodiment, the prosthetic group employed is an oligomer conjugate with a hydrophilic component, such as a PEG polymer, and a lipophilic component, such as a branched fatty acid or alkyl chain, linked by a hydrolyzable bond, such as an ester bond, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 6,309,633. In another related embodiment, the prosthetic group employed is an oligomer that includes polypropylene glycol), and preferably at feast two poly(propylene glycol) subunits, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 6,858,580. The teachings of each of the foregoing patents and patent applications are incorporated by reference as if set forth in full.<br>

The "derivative of an amino acid side chain moiety" is a modification to or variation in any amino acid side chain moiety, including a modification to or variation in either a naturally occurring or unnatural amino acid side chain moiety, wherein the modification or variation includes: (a) adding one or more saturated or unsaturated carbon atoms to an existing alkyl, aryl, or aralkyl chain; (b) substituting a carbon in the side chain with another atom, preferably oxygen or nitrogen; (c) adding a terminal group to a carbon atom of the side chain, including methyl (-CH3), methoxy (-OCH3), nitro 
The "amino acids" used in embodiments of the present invention, and the term as used In the specification and claims, include the known naturally occurring protein amino acids, which are referred to by both their common three letter abbreviation and single letter abbreviation. See generally Synthetic Peptides: A User's Guide. G. A. Grant, editor, W.H.

Thus, "NIe" is norleucine; "Asp" is aspartic acid; "His" is histidine; "Arg" is arginine; "Trp" is tryptophan; "Lys" is lysine; "Gly" is glycine; "Pro" is proline; "Tyr" is tyrosine, "Ser" is serine and so on. All residues are in the L-isomer configuration unless the D-isomer is specificed, as in "D-Ala" for D-alanine.<br>
A single amino acid, including stereoisomers and modifications of naturally occurring protein amino acids, non-protein amino acids, post-translationally modified amino acids, enzymatically synthesized amino acids, derivatized amino acids, an a, a-disubstituted amino acid derived from any of the foregoing (i.e., an a, a-<br><br><br>
disubstituted amino acid wherein at least one side chain is the same as that of the residue from which it is derived), a β-amino acid derived from any of the foregoing (i.e., a β-amino acid which other than for the presence of a β-carbon is otherwise the same as the residue from which it is derived) and the like, including all of the foregoing, is sometimes referred to herein as a "residue."<br>
An "α, α-disubstituted amino acid" includes any α-amino acid having a further substituent in the a-position, which substituent may be the same as or different from the side chain moiety of the a-amino acid. Suitable substituents, in addition to the side chain moiety of the a-amino acid, include C1 to C6 linear or branched alky}. Aib is an example of an α, α-disubstituted amino acid. While α, α-disubstituted amino acids can be referred to using conventional L- and D-isomeric references, it is to be understood that such references are for convenience, and that where the substituents at the a-position are different, such amino acid can interchangeably be referred to as an α, α-disubstituted amino acid derived from the L- or D-isomer, as appropriate, of a residue with the designated amino acid side chain moiety. Thus (S)-2-Amino-2-methyl-hexanoic acid can be referred to as either an a, a-disubstituted amino acid derived from L-Nle or as an a, a-disubstituted amino acid derived from D-Aia. Whenever an a, a-disubstituted amino acid is provided, it is to be understood as including all (R) and (S) configurations thereof.<br>
An "N-substituted amino acid" includes any amino acid wherein an amino acid side chain moiety is covalently bonded to the backbone amino group, optionally where there are no substituents other than H in the a-carbon position. Sarcosine is an example of an N-substituted amino acid. By way of example, sarcosine can be referred to as an N-substituted amino acid derivative of Ala, in that the amino acid side chain moiety of sarcosine and Ala is the same, methyl.<br>
The term "amino acid surrogate" includes a molecule disclosed herein which is a mimic of a residue, incfuding but not limited to piperazine core molecules, keto-piperazine core molecules and diazepine core molecules. Unless otherwise specified, an amino acid surrogate is understood to include both a carboxyl group and amino group, and a group corresponding to an amino acid side chain, or in the case of an amino acid surrogate of glycine, no side chain other than hydrogen. Thus an amino acid surrogate includes a molecule of the general formula of formula I or II given above. An amino acid surrogate further includes molecules of any of the following structures, it being understood that for convenience such structures are given as the isolated surrogate, not including any protecting group and not bound by one or two peptide bonds to one or two amino acid residues forming a part of a construct of the invention:<br><br><br><br>

An amino acid surrogate further includes molecules of any of the following structures, again it being understood that for convenience such structures are given as the isolated surrogate, not including any protecting group and not bound by one or two peptide bonds to one or two amino acid residues forming a part of a construct of the invention:<br><br>
where R, R' x and the asterisks are as defined for the surrogate of formula 1. For purposes of synthesis, either the carboxyl group or the amino group of any amino acid surrogate is preferabjy protected by a protecting group, such that it is not reactive while the protecting group is present, and similarly any reactive group forming a part of R or R* may similarly be protected by a protecting group. It wil, be appreciated that the surrogates of the present invention have more than one asymmetric center, and therefore are capable of existing in more than one stereoisomeric form. Some of the compounds may also exist as geometric isomers and rotamers. Furthermore, some compounds of the invention may also have conformational axial chirality resulting in atropisomers. The invention extends to each of these forms individually and to mixtures thereof, including racemates. In one aspect, surrogate isomers may be separated conventionally by chromatographic methods or by use of a resolving agent. In another aspect, individual surrogate isomers or enantiomerically pure surrogates, are prepared by synthetic schemes, such as those disclosed herein or variants of such schemes, employing asymmetric synthesis using chiral intermediates, reagents or catalysts<br>

The constructs disclosed herein can be used for both medical applications and animal husbandry or veterinary applications. Typically, the construct, or a pharmaceutical composition including the construct, is used in humans, but may also be used in other mammals. The term "patient" is intended to denote a mammalian individual, and is so used throughout the specification and in the claims. The primary applications of this invention involve human patients, but this invention may be appiied to laboratory, farm, zoo, wildlife, pet, sport or other animals.<br>
The constructs disclosed herein may be used for the treatment of any condition, syndrome or disease for which induction of anti-hypertensive, cardiovascular, renal, and/or endocrine effects are desired. This includes specifically any condition, syndrome or disease for which a native natriuretic peptide may be employed. Thus the constructs disclosed herein may be employed to cause desired natriuresis, diuresis and/or vasodilation in a patient.<br>

Salt Form of Constructs. The constructs of this invention may be in the form of any pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids including inorganic or organic bases and inorganic or organic acids. Salts derived from inorganic bases include salts of aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic, manganous, potassium, sodium, zinc, and the like. Particularly preferred are the ammonium, calcium, lithium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines, and basic ion exchange resins, such as arginine, betaine, caffeine, choline, N.N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethyl-morpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, isopropyiamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morphoiine, piperazine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, thethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine, tromethamine, and the like.<br>
When the construct of the present invention is basic, acid addition salts may be prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acids, including inorganic and organic acids. Such acids include acetic, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, camphorsulfonic, carboxylic, citric, ethanesulfonic, formic, fumaric, gluconic, glutamic, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, isethionic, lactic, maleic, malic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, malonic, mucic, nitric, pamoic, pantothenic, phosphoric, propionic, succinic, sulfuric, tartaric, p-toluenesulfonicacid, trifluoroacetic acid, and the like. Acid addition salts of the constructs of this invention are prepared in a suitable solvent from the construct and an excess of an acid, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, trifluoroacetic, citric, tartaric, maleic, succinic or methanesulfonic acid. The acetate salt form is especially useful. Where the constructs of embodiments of this invention include an acidic moiety, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts may include alkali metal salts, such as sodium or potassium salts, or alkaline<br><br><br>
earth metal salts, such as calcium or magnesium salts.<br>
In addition, Applicants have advantageously discovered that certain salt forms of tne peptide constructs of the invention, including pamoate, octanoate, decanoate, oleate, stearate, sodium tannate and palmitate salt forms, have an increased circulation half-life, in some cases doubled versus the corresponding acetate salt form. These salt forms are particularly well-suited for administration by subcutaneous injection or intramuscular injection, especially for chronic treatment, due to the reduced frequency of dosing that may be achieved as a result of the longer half-lives. While not being limited by theory, it is believed the increased half-life is related to a decrease in solubility in comparison to the acetate salt form. The increased half-life salt forms of the peptide constructs of the invention may be manufactured by any method including for example, ion exchange, mixing a solution of an acetate salt form of a construct with disodium pamoate to form a pamoate suspension, or use of the desired salt during the final purification step(s) in the manufacture of the constructs.<br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions. Another embodiment of the Present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition that includes a construct of this invention and a pharrriaceutically acceptable carrier. The carrier may be a liquid formulation, and is preferably a buffered, isotonic, aqueous solution. Pharmaceutical^ acceptable carriers also include excipients, such as diluents, carriers and the like,and additives, such as stabilizing agents, preservatives, solubilizing agents, buffers and the like,as hereafter described.<br>
The constructs of the several embodiments of the present invention may be formulated or compounded into pharmaceutical compositions that include at least one construct of this invention together with one or more pharmaceutical^ acceptable carriers, including excipients, such as diluents, carriers and the like, and additives, such as stabilizing agents, preservatives, solubilizing agents, buffers and the like, as may be desired. Formulation excipients may include polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin, hydroxy cellulose, acacia, polyethylene glycol, manniton, sodium chloride and sodium citrate. For injection or other liquid administration formulations, water containing at least one or more buffering constituents is preferred, and stabilizing agents, preservatives and solubilizing agents may also be employed. For solid administration formulations, any of a variety of thickening, filler, bulking and carrier additives may be employed, such as starches  sugars, fatty acids and the like. For topical administration formulations, any of a variety of creams, oinments,gets,lotion and the like may be employed. For most pharmaceutical formulations, non-active ingredients will constitute the greater part, by weight or volume, of the preparation. For pharmaceutical formulates, it is also contemplated that any of a variety of measured-release, slow-release or time-release formulatiors and additives may be employed, so that the dosage may be formulated so as to effect delivery of a construct of this invention over a period of time. For example, gelatin, sodium carboxymethylcellulose and/or other cellulc,sic excipients may be included to provide time-release or slower-release formulations, especially for administration by subcutaneous and intramuscular injection.<br>
In general, the actual quantity of constructs administered to a patient will vary between fairly wide ranges depending on the mode of administration, the formulation used and the response desired.<br>
In practical use, the constructs can be combined as the active ingredient in an admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, for example, oral, parenteral (including intravenous), urethral, vaginal, nasal, dermal transdermal, pulmonary, deep lung, inhalation, buccal, sublingual, or the like. In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations, such as, for example,<br><br><br>
suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, hard and soft capsules and tablets.<br>
Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent an advantageous oral dosage unit form. If desired, a composition including a construct of this invention may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. The amount of active construct in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage will be obtained. In another advantageous dosage unit form, sublingual pharmaceutical compositions may be employed, such as sheets, wafers, tablets or the like. The active construct can also be administered intranasally as, for example, by liquid drops or spray.<br>
The tablets, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch or alginic acid; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin. When a dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil.<br>
Various other materials may be utilized as coatings or to modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain, in addition to the active ingredient, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor.<br>
Constructs may also be administered parenterally. Solutions or suspensions of these active peptides may be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxy-propylcellulose. Dispersions may also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. These preparations may optionally contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. Lyophilized single unit formulations may also be utilized, which are reconstituted, such as with saline, immediately prior to administration, and thus do not require a preservative.<br>
The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include, for example, sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders, such as lyophilized formulations, for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that it may be administered by syringe. The form must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol, for example glycerol, propylene glycol or liquid polyethylene glycol, suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils.<br>
Constructs as disclosed herein may be therapeutically applied by means of nasal administration. By "nasal administration" is meant any form of intranasal administration of any of the constructs of this invention. The constructs may be in an aqueous solution, such as a solution including saline, citrate or other common excipients or preservatives. The constructs may also be in a dry or powder formulation.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, constructs may be administered directly into the lung. Intrapulmonary administration may be performed by means of a metered dose inhaler, a device allowing self-administration of a metered bolus of a construct of this invention when actuated by a patient during inspiration. Both dry powder inhalation and nebulized aerosols may be employed.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention, constructs of this invention may be formulated with any of a variety of agents that increase effective nasal absorption of drugs, including peptide drugs.     These agents should increase nasal  absorption without unacceptable damage to the mucosal<br><br><br>
membrane. U.S. Patents 5,693,608, 5,977,070 and 5,908,825, among others, teach a number of pharmaceutical compositions that may be employed, including absorption enhancers, and the teachings of each of the foregoing, and all references and patents cited therein, are incorporated by reference.<br>
If in an aqueous solution, certain constructs of the present invention may be appropriately buffered by means of saline, acetate, phosphate, citrate, acetate or other buffering agents, which may be at any physiologically acceptable pH, generally from about pH 4 to about pH 7. A combination of buffering agents may also be employed, such as phosphate buffered saline, a saline and acetate buffer, and the like. In the case of saline, a 0.9% saline solution may be employed. In the case of acetate, phosphate, citrate, acetate and the like, a 50 mM solution may be employed. In addition to buffering agents, a suitable preservative may be employed, to prevent or limit bacteria and other microbial growth. One such preservative that may be employed is 0.05% benzalkonium chloride.<br>
It is also possible and contemplated that the construct may be in a dried and particulate form. In a preferred embodiment, the particles are between about 0.5 and 6.0 urn, such that the particles have sufficient mass to settle on the lung surface, and not be exhaled, but are small enough that they are not deposited on surfaces of the air passages prior to reaching the lung. Any of a variety of different techniques may be used to make dry powder microparticles, including but not limited to micro-milling, spray drying and a quick freeze aerosol followed by lyophilization. With micro-particles, the constructs may be deposited to the deep lung, thereby providing quick and efficient absorption into the bloodstream. Further, with such approach penetration enhancers are not required, as is sometimes the case in transdermal, nasal or oral mucosal delivery routes. Any of a variety of inhalers can be employed, including propellant-based aerosols, nebulizers, single dose dry powder inhalers and multidose dry powder inhalers. Common devices in current use include metered dose inhalers, which are used to deliver medications for the treatment of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the like. Preferred devices include dry powder inhalers, designed to form a cloud or aerosol of fine powder with a particle size that is always less than about 6.0 urn.<br>
Microparticle size, including mean size distribution, may be controlled by means of the method of making. For micro-milling, the size of the milling head, speed of the rotor, time of processing and the like control the microparticle size. For spray drying, the nozzle size, flow rate, dryer heat and the like control the microparticle size. For making by means of quick freeze aerosol followed by lyophilization, the nozzle size, flow rate, concentration of aerosoled solution and the like control the microparticle size. These parameters and others may be employed to control the microparticle size.<br>
The constructs of this invention may be therapeutically administered by means of an injection, typically a deep intramuscular injection, such as in the gluteal or deltoid muscle, of a time release injectable formulation. In one embodiment, a construct of this invention is formulated with a PEG, such as poly(ethy!ene glycol) 3350, and optionally one or more additional excipients and preservatives, including but not limited to excipients such as salts, polysorbate 80, sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid to adjust pH, and the like. In another embodiment, a construct of this invention is formulated with a poly(ortho ester), which may be an auto-catalyzed poly(ortho ester) with any of a variable percentage of lactic acid in the polymeric backbone, and optionally one or more additional excipients. In one embodiment poly (D,L-lactide-co-giycolide) polymer (PLGA polymer) is employed, preferably a PLGA polymer with a hydrophilic end group, such as PLGA RG502H from Boehringer Ingelheim, Inc. (Ingelheim, Germany). Such formulations may be made, for example, by combining a construct of this invention in a suitable solvent, such as methanol, with a solution of PLGA in methylene chloride, and adding thereto a continuous phase solution of polyvinyl alcohol under suitable mixing conditions in a reactor.    In<br><br><br>
general, any of a number of injectable and biodegradable polymers, which are preferably also adhesive polymers, may be employed in a time release injectable formulation. The teachings of U.S. Patents 4,938,763, 6,432,438, and 6,673,767, and the biodegradable polymers and methods of formulation disclosed therein, are incorporated here by reference.

The constructs were prepared by a variety of methods as described in Methods A and B.<br>
Method A: The dipeptides (3) were formed by the mixed anhydride method, using Boc-serine (OBn)-OH (1), and an a-amino ester (2). The dipeptides were obtained in high yields, and usually no purification was required. Reduction of both the methyl ester and the amide group was done using diborane-tetrahydrofuran, with the secondary amines protected to give the di-Boc protected amino alcohol intermediates (4). Oxidation of the alcohols with pyridinium dichromate (PDC) with concomitant cyclization gave the piperazine-2-ones (5) in one step. Benzyl ether removal by hydrogenation, followed by protecting group exchange gave the Fmoc protected piperazine-2-ones (6). Finally, the primary alcohol was oxidized to the acid by any of a number of different methods (PDC, Jones oxidation, ruthenium chloride-sodium periodate, 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy, free radical (TEMPO) oxidation) to give the final products (7).

General Common Synthetic Scheme for the Preparation of Ketopiperazine Scaffolds Applicable to Compounds With or Without Functionalized R sidechains (Methods C, E, F)<br>
Method C: (2-Fmoc-amino-3- R'-0-propylamino)-2-substituted acetic acid methyl esters (10) were prepared by reductive amination of Fmoc O-protected serinal (9) with α-amino esters (2), using either sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride as the reducing agent The Fmoc O-protected serinal (9) required for the reductive amination was prepared according to method D, either by reduction of the ester (12) by di-isobutylaluminun hydride, by oxidation of Fmoc O-protected serinol (13) with Dess-Martin periodinane, or by reduction of the Fmoc O-protected serine Weinreb amide (14) with lithium aluminum hydride. The preferred method for the preparation of Fmoc O-protected serinals (9) was the reduction of the Weinreb amide analog. (2-Fmoc-amino-3- R'-0-propylamino)-2-substituted acetic acid methyl esters (10) were then N and O deprotected, cyclized, and Fmoc protected to give 3-substituted 6-hydroxymehyl-piperazin-2-ones (6), which were then oxidized to the final product as described in method A.<br>
The protecting group (R') on the hydroxy! group of Fmoc-O-protected serinal (9) used in the synthesis depends on the nature of the side chain R of the amino ester. When R contained no functional groups, the side chain of Fmoc serine was protected as the fBu ether.  When R contained functional groups, the side chain of Fmoc serine was protected as the trityi ether. Method C<br><br><br><br>
Method D: Synthesis of various Fmoc-O-protected serinafs (9). Synthesis of Fmoc-O-R' serine methyl ester (12): A slight suspension of 80 mmol of Fmoc O-R' serine (11), 10.0 g (120 mmol) of solid sodium bicarbonate, and 10.0 mL (160 mmol) of iodomethane in 80 mL  of dry dimethylformamide, kept under nitrogen, was stirred at room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture was then poured over 500 mL of water, and the solid filtered. The solid was redissolved in 800 mL of ethyl acetate, and washed with 1 x 200 mL of water, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated.  No purification was required.<br><br>
Synthesis of Fmoc-O-R' serinol (13): To a solution of 10.0 mmol of Fmoc O-R' serine (11) in 50 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran, kept at -20 °C under nitrogen, was added 1.77 mL (12.7 mmol) of triethyl amine, followed by the slow addition of 1.57 mL (12.0 mmol) of isobutylchloroformate.

The constructs as disclosed in the several embodiments of this invention may be readily synthesized by any known conventional procedure for the formation of a peptide linkage between amino acids. Such conventional procedures include, for example, any solution phase procedure permitting a condensation between the free alpha amino group of an amino acid residue having its carboxyl group or other reactive groups protected and the free primary carboxyl group of another amino acid residue having its amino group or other reactive groups protected. In a preferred conventional procedure, the constructs of this invention may be synthesized by solid-phase synthesis and purified according to methods known in the art. The amino acid surrogates of the present invention may be incorporated into constructs of this invention by methods substantially similar to or identical to those employed with residues. Any of a number of well-known procedures utilizing a variety of resins and reagents may be used to prepare the constructs of this invention.<br>
The process for synthesizing the constructs may be carried out by a procedure whereby each amino acid or amino acid surrogate in the desired sequence is added one at a time in succession to another amino acid residue or amino acid surrogate or by a procedure whereby peptide fragments with the desired amino acid sequence, which may include one or more amino acid surrogates, are first synthesized conventionally and then condensed to provide the desired construct. The resulting construct is cyclized to yield a cyclic construct of the invention.<br>
Solid phase peptide synthesis methods are well known and practiced in the art. in such methods the synthesis of constructs of the invention can be carried out by sequentially incorporating the desired amino acid residues or amino acid surrogates one at a time into the growing peptide chain according to the general principles of solid phase methods. These methods are disclosed in numerous references, including Merrifield R.B., Solid phase synthesis (Nobel lecture). Angew. Chem. 24:799-810 (1985) and Barany et al., The Peptides, Analysis. Synthesis and Biology, Vol. 2, Gross E. and Meienhofer J., Eds. Academic Press, 1-284 (1980).<br>
In chemical syntheses of constructs, reactive side chain groups of the various amino acid residues or<br>
amino acid surrogates are protected with suitable protecting groups, which prevent a chemical reaction from<br>
occurring at that site until the protecting group is removed. Also common is the protection of the alpha amino<br>
group of an amino acid residue or amino acid surrogate while that entity reacts at the carboxyl group, followed<br>
by the selective removal of the alpha amino protecting group to allow a subsequent reaction to take place at that<br>
site. Specific protecting groups have been disclosed and are known in solid phase synthesis methods and<br>
solution	phase	synthesis	methods.<br><br><br>
Alpha amino groups may be protected by a suitable protecting group, including a urethane-type protecting group, such as benzyloxycarbonyl (2) and substituted benzyloxycarbonyl, such as p-chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-bromobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-biphenyl-isopropoxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl <fmoc and p-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl aliphatic urethane-type protecting groups such as t-butyloxycarbonyl diisopropylmethoxycarbonyl isopropoxycarbonyl allyloxycarbonyl. fmoc is preferred for alpha amino protection.></fmoc>
Guanidino groups may be protected by a suitable protecting group, such as nitro, p-toluenesulfonyl (Tos), Z, pentamethylchromanesulfonyl (Pmc), adamantyloxycarbonyl, pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl (Pbf), Fmoc and Boc. Pbf is one preferred protecting group for Arg. Other preferred protecting groups include Z, Fmoc, and Boc. It is to be understood that particularly guanidino protecting groups may be cleaved and removed during the synthetic process, or may alternatively not be cleaved or removed, in which event the side chain with the protecting group forms a derivative of an amino acid side chain moiety as defined herein. Particularly where the protecting group is labile, and may be removed by some mechanism in vivo upon administration to a patient, the construct becomes a "prodrug", which is to say a construct that is a drug precursor which, following administration to a patient, is converted to the desired drug form in vivo via some chemical or physiological process (e.g., a prodrug on being brought to physiological pH or through enzyme action is converted to the desired drug form).<br>
The constructs of the invention described herein can be prepared using solid phase synthesis, either manually or by means of an automated peptide synthesizer, using programming modules as provided by the manufacturer and following the protocols set forth by the manufacturer, or by modifications of the manufacturers's protocols to improve the yield of difficult couplings.<br>
Solid phase synthesis is commenced from the C-terminal end of the construct by coupling a protected a-amino acid, a-amino acid surrogate or a-amino alcohol mimetic to a suitable resin. Such starting material is prepared by attaching an a-amino-protected amino acid or a-amino-protected amino acid surrogate by an ester linkage to a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin or a 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin, by an amide bond between an Fmoc-Linker, such as p-[(R, S)-a-[1-{9H-fluor-en-9-yl)-methoxyformamido]-2,4-dimethyloxybenzyl]-phenoxyacetic acid (Rink linker) to a benzhydrylamine (BHA) resin, or by other means well known in the art, such as by attaching an a-amino-protected alcohol mimetic to 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2yl-methanol linker attached to chloromethyl polystyrene resin. Fmoc-Linker-BHA resin supports are commercially available and generally used when feasible. The resins are carried through repetitive cycles as necessary to add amino acids sequentially. The alpha amino Fmoc protecting groups are removed under basic conditions. Piperidine, piperazine, diethylamine, or morpholine (20-40% v/v) in N.N-dimethylformamide (DMF) may be used for this purpose.<br>
Following removal of the alpha amino protecting group, the subsequent protected amino acids or amino acid surrogates are coupled stepwise in the desired order to obtain an intermediate, protected pepti'de-resin. The activating reagents used for coupling of the amino acids in the solid phase synthesis of the peptides are well known in the art. After the construct is synthesized, if desired, the orthogonally protected side chain protecting groups may be removed using methods well known in the art for further derivatization of the construct.<br>
Reactive groups in a construct can be selectively modified, either during solid phase synthesis or after removal from the resin. For example, constructs can be modified to obtain N-terminus modifications, such as acetylation, while on resin, or may be removed from the resin by use of a cleaving reagent and then modified.<br><br><br>
Methods for N-terminus modification, such as acetylation, or C-terminus modification, such as amidation or introduction of an N-acetyl group, are known in the art. Similarly, methods for modifying side chains of amino Lacids are well known to those skilled in the art of peptide synthesis. The choice of modifications made to reactive groups present on the construct will be determined, in part, by the characteristics that are desired in the construct.<br>
The construct are, in one embodiment, cyclized prior to cleavage from the resin. For cyclization through<br>
reactive side chain moieties, the desired side chains are deprotected, and the construct suspended in a suitable<br>
solvent and a cyclic coupling agent added. Suitable solvents include, for example DMF, dichloromethane<br>
(DCM) or 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Suitable cyclic coupling reagents include, for example, 2-{1H-<br>
benzotriazol-1 -yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU), 2-(1 H-benzotriazol-1 -yl)-1,1,3,3-<br>
tetramethyluronium	hexafluorophosphate	(HBTU),	benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-<br>
tris(dimethylamino)phosphoniumhexafluorophosphate	(BOP),	benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-<br>
tris(pyrrolidino)phosphoniumhexafluorophosphate	(PyBOP),	2-(7-aza-1 H-benzotriazol-1 -yl)-1,1,3,3-<br>
tetramethyluronium	tetrafluoroborate	(TATU),	2-(2-oxo-1(2H)-pyridyl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium<br>
tetrafluoroborate (TPTU) or N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxybenzotriazoIe (DCCI/HOBt). Coupling is conventionally initiated by use of a suitable base, such as N,N-diispropylethylamine (DIPEA), sym-collidine or N-methylmorpholine (NMM).<br>
Following cleavage of constructs from the solid phase following synthesis, the construct can be purified by any number of methods, such as reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), using a suitable column, such as a C18 column. Other methods of separation or purification, such as methods based on the size or charge of the construct, can also be employed. Once purified, the construct can be characterized by any number of methods, such as high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC), amino acid analysis, mass spectrometry, and the like.<br>
Constructs of the present invention with a substituted amide derivative C-terminus, typically an N-alkyl group, are prepared by solid phase synthesis commenced from the C-terminal end of the construct by coupling a protected alpha amino acid or amino acid surrogate to a suitable resin. Such methods for preparing substituted amide derivatives on solid phase have been described in the art. See, for example, Barn D.R., Morphy J.R., Rees D.C. Synthesis of an array of amides by aluminum chloride assisted cleavage of resin-bound esters. Tetrahedron Lett. 37, 3213-3216 (1996); DeGrado W. F. Kaiser E. T. Solid-phase synthesis of protected peptides on a polymer bound oxime: Preparation of segments comprising the sequences of a cytotoxic 26-peptide analogue. J. Org. Chem. 47:3258-3261 (1982). Such starting material can be prepared by attaching an alpha amino-protected amino acid or amino acid surrogate by an ester linkage to a p-benzyioxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin by well known means. The peptide chain is grown with the desired sequence of amino acids or amino acid surrogates, the product cyclized and resin-treated with a solution of appropriate amine and aluminum choride (such as methyl amine, dimethyl amine, ethylamine, and so on) in dichloromethane. The resulting amide derivative construct is released in solution from the resin. The resin is filtered and the amide derivative construct recovered by concentration of solvent followed by precipitation with ether. The crude construct is dried and remaining amino acid side chain protective groups cleaved using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in the presence of water and triisopropylsilane (TIS). The final product is precipitated by adding cold ether and collected by filtration. Final purification is by RP-HPLC using a C18 column.<br>
In one preferred method, the constructs of Example 1 were synthesized by the following methods. Each of the constructs had one or two amino acid surrogates based on a keto-piperazine structure.  The amino acid<br><br><br><br>
surrogates were synthesized as described above. The constructs were synthesized using Fmoc chemistry. A manual synthetic approach was used for couplings immediately before and after incorporation of the keto-piperazine amino acid surrogate.<br>
The following protocol was employed to attach an amino acid surrogate to resin, such as where the amino acid surrogate was in a terminal position. Rink amide resin (loading at 0.3 mmol/g, Advanced ChemTech) was allowed to swell in DMF for 30 minutes. Fmoc deprotection of the resin was accomplished using 20% piperidine/DMF for 20 minutes. Coupling of the resin with the selected Fmoc-protected keto-piperazine amino acid surrogate (2 eq) was accomplished by overnight incubation in DMF with PyBop (2 $q) and DIEA (4 eq). If following Kaiser testing a positive result was obtained, the coupling reaction was conducting a second time. Acetylation was carried out using Ac20 (10 eq) and pyridine (20 eq) in DMF.<br>
The following protocol was employed to attach a keto-piperazine amino acid surrogate to peptide-resin. Coupling was carried out by mixing Fmoc-protected keto piperzine amino acid surrogate (2 eq), TBTU (2 eq) and DIEA (4 eq) in DMF and allowing to incubate overnight, again with a repeat of the coupling reaction if a positive Kaiser test obtained. Acetylation was carried out using Ac20 (10 eq) and pyridine (20 eq) in DMF.<br>
The following protocol was employed to couple an Fmoc-protected amino acid to a keto-piperazine amino acid surrogate on solid phase. In most instances at least two coupling cycles were needed, and frequently three cycles were employed. In a typical cycle Fmoc-protected amino acid (4 eq) was mixed with HOAt (4 eq) and DIC (4 eq) in DMF. The resulting mixture was then mixed overnight in a SPE tube with a keto-piperazine amino acid surrogate attached directly or through intermediates to resin.<br>
Couplings between amino acids that were not directly adjacent to a keto-piperazine amino acid surrogate in the sequence were conducted using standard protocols for solid phase peptide synthesis. The following protecting groups were employed: Boc for Lys and Orn, t-Butyl for Tyr and Ser, Trityl for Cys and His, O-f-Butyl for Asp and Pbf for Arg.<br>
Constructs were cleaved from resin employing a mixture of TFA/thioanisole/phenol/H20/DTT/TlS (87.5/2.5/2.5/5/2.5/11) (5 mL) for 3 hours. The resulting material was filtered and precipitated from cold ether under freezing conditions for one hour. Precipitated cysteinyl peptide was washed with cold ether at least three times before being use in an oxidation step.<br>
For cyclization to form disulfide bonds via air oxidation, crude cysteinyl construct was dissolved in a mixture of acetonitrite and water. The pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 7-8 using 5% NH4OH. The resulted solution was stirred slowly with 150 mg granular activated carbon for 2 days. Completion of cyclization was confirmed by LC-MS analysis before proceding to the next process step. After cyclization, solid carbon was filtered from solution. The filtrate was lyophilized or dried in a speed-vac to obtain crude cyclic construct.<br>
Certain constructs of the invention, where the surrogate is bound to resin or other peptide solid support and is at the C-terminal position, may be synthesized by means of the following scheme. The following scheme is exemplified by synthesis of construct 1-132, but it is to be understood that substantially similar methods may be employed for any construct wherein the surrogate is bound to resin or other peptide solid support.<br>

Surrogate (7) is prepared by the scheme of method A above, or any alternative method. Fmoc protected Sieber amide resin was treated by swelling 23.8 g (0.63 mmol/g substitution, 15 mmol) of the resin in 200 mL of a 1:1 mixture of dimethylformamide and dichloromethane for 45 minutes, followed by filtering and washing with 2 x 125 mL of dimethylformamide. The washed resin was then deprotected with 2 x 125 mL of 20% piperidine in dimethylformamide for 15 minutes, filtered, and washed with 4 x 125 mL of dimethylformamide.<br>
A solution of 21.5 g (MW = 717, 30 mmol) of Fmoc-protected surrogate (7) in 160 mL of dimethylformamide was added to the deprotected Sieber amide resin as prepared above, followed by 15.6 g (MW = 520.3, 30 mmol) of solid PyBop, and 10.4 mL (MW = 129.25, d = 0.742, 60 mmol) of diisopropylethylamine, followed by another 40 mL of dimethylformamide. The mixture was agitated overnight with nitrogen bubbling. The resin was filtered, and washed with 4 x 130 mL of dimethylformamide, capped with 150 mL of capping solution consisting of a 3:2:1 solution of dimethylformamide:acetic anhydride:pyridine for 30 minutes, filtered, and washed with 4 x 130 mL of dimethylformamide to provide surrogate (7) complexed to resin.<br>
The resulting Fmoc-protected surrogate (7) complexed to resin was deprotected with 2 x 130 mL of 20% piperidine in dimethylformamide for 15 minutes, filtered, and washed with 4 x 130 mL of dimethylformamide to yield surrogate (7) complexed to resin. A solution of 27.6 g of Fmoc-Tyr-(tBu)-OH (60 mmol, 4 eq.) in dimethylformamide (200 mL) was added to surrogate (7) complexed to resin, followed by a solution of 24.8 g of HCTU (60 mmol, 4 eq.), and 20.8 mL (120 mmol, 8 eq.) of diisopropylethylamine in DMF to a final volume of 200 mL and coupled overnight with nitrogen bubbling. The resulting Fmoc-Tyr-(tBu)-surrogate (7)-resin was isolated by filtration and washed with 2 x 130 mL of dimethylformamide. In order to ensure complete coupling, the product was again treated with a solution of 27.6 g of Fmoc-Tyr-(tBu)-OH (MW = 459.6, 60 mmol, 4 eq.) in dimethylformamide to a final volume of 200 mL followed by a solution of 24.8 g of HCTU (60 mmol, 4 eq.), and diisopropylethylamine (20.8 mL, 120 mmol, 8 eq.) in DMF to a final volume of 200 mL and coupled overnight with nitrogen bubbling. The resin was filtered, and washed with 2 x 130 mL of dimethylformamide. HPLC and LC/MS showed that coupling between surrogate (7)-resin and Fmoc-Tyr-(tBu)-OH was complete.<br>
The resulting Fmoc-Tyr-(tBu)-surrogate (7)-resin was then capped with 150 mL of capping solution as above for 30 minutes. The resin was then filtered, washed with 4 x 130 mL of dimethylformamide, 4 x 130 mL of dichloromethane, 2 x 130 mL of MeOH, 2 x 130 mL of diethyl ether, and dried under vacuum to give 36.7 g.<br>
Thereafter each succeeding amino acid may be coupled.   Before the coupling of the first amino acid,<br><br><br>
resulting Fmoc-Tyr-(tBu)-surrogate (7)-resin was swollen for 45 minutes with 200 mL of a 1:1 solution of dimethylformamide:dichloromethane. Each amino acid (Fmoc-AA-OH) was coupled by repeating the following  cycle. The terminal amino acid residue was deprotected with 2 x 125 mL of 20% piperidine in dimethylformamide for 15 minutes, filtered and washed with 4 x 125 mL of dimethylformamide. The beads were checked by ninhydrin test. A solution of Fmoc-AA-OH (60 mmol, 4 eq.) in dimethylformamide to a final volume of 200 mL was added to resin, followed by a solution of HBTU (60 mmol, 4 eq.), and (120 mmol, 8 eq.) of N-methylmorpholine in DMF to a final volume of 200 mL [concentration of Fmoc-AA-OH = 150 mM solution] and coupled for 30 minutes with nitrogen bubbling (coupling reaction checked by ninhydrin test). When the ninhydrin test was negative, the resin was filtered, and washed with 4 x 130 mL of dimethylformamide.<br>
After all amino acids had been coupled, the resin was washed with 4 x 130 mL of dichloromethane, 4 x 130 mL of methanol, 4 x 130 mL of diethyl ether, and dried under vacuum to give product. The weight increase was quantitative.<br>
100 mL of cleavage reagent consisting of a 81.5:5:5:5:2.5:1 solution of trifluoroacetic acid:phenol:thioanisole:water:DDT:triisopropyl silane was added to 32 g (~ 6.4 mmol) of the following linear construct:<br><br>
The suspension was allowed to stand at room temperature for 5 minutes and then filtered. Another 100 mL of cleavage reagent was added to the resin, allowed to stand for 5 minutes, and filtered. This process was repeated.<br>
The resulting resin was then washed with 2 x 40 mL of trifluoroacetic acid. The filtrates were combined and stirred for 2.5 hours at room temperature, and then concentrated under reduced pressure to - 100 mL volume. Cold diethyl ether (1.5 L, pre-cooled to -20 °C) was added to the filtrate, and then placed in the freezer (-20 °C) for 1 hour, filtered through a sintered glass funnel, and the solids washed with 3 x 200 mL of cold diethyl ether, and then dried under vacuum for 1 hour with the solids triturated every 15 minutes to make sure solvent was removed efficiently. The following construct was obtained (15.4 g) (103% overall crude yield):<br><br>
The above construct (15.4 g, 6.4 mmol) was dissolved in 16 L of 30% acetonitrile in water. The pH was adjusted to 8.4 using a solution of 5% ammonium hydroxide. Pulverized activated carbon (15.4 g) was added, and the suspension stirred overnight. The carbon was removed by filtration through celite. The celite was washed 3 x 100 mL 50% acetonitrile in water. The filtrates were combined, diluted with water to a final concentration of 10% acetonitrile, and loaded in the column for purification. Purification of the trifluoroacetate salt of the resulting construct was performed under the following conditions:<br>
Column:	Luna C18, 10 u, 50 x 33 mm<br>
Flow:	70 mL/minute<br>
Solvent A:     water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid<br>
Solvent B:     acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid<br><br>
Gradient:       5% solvent B for 5 minutes<br>
26% B to 52% B in 30 minutes<br>
The pure fractions were combined and lyophilized to give the purified trifluoroacetate salt of the construct. Dowex SBR, LCNG-OH resin (450g) was suspended in 2 L of water, and gently stirred for 15 minutes, allowed to stand for 15 minutes, and then decanted. The procedure was repeated, and then 0.5 L of water added, and the slurry transferred into a 6 x 60 cm column. The water was drained, washed with 4 L of water, and ions exchanged with 6.5 L of 20% acetic acid solution. The resin was allowed to stand at room temperature overnight, and then washed with water until the pH of the filtrate was ~ 4 (8 L of water used). The trifluoroacetate salt of the above construct {11.1 g), as prepared above, was dissolved in 80 mL of water, and loaded to the ion exchange resin, and eluted with water. Fractions containing 79-1 were combined, and 20% acetic acid solution was added to adjust the final concentration to 5% acetic acid, and then lyophilized. The following construct 1-132 (10.4 g) was obtained:<br><br>
Similar methods may be employed with any construct where the surrogate is bound to resin or other peptide solid support and is at the C-terminal position.<br>
Optional PEGylation of the peptide constructs of the invention may be performed in any manner, such as those described below.<br>
PEGylation of reactive amine groups, such as lysine or ornithine side chains, an omega amino aliphatic in position Aaa1, or an amine group in J of an amino acid surrogate at Aaa15, was accomplished by dissolving 0.005 mmol purified construct in 2 mL of dimethylsulfoxide, followed by the addition of 55.5 mg (0.011 mmol, 2 eq) of PEG-5K-OSu (5,000 Da MW methoxy-PEG with a succinimidyl propionate reactive group), with 17.7 uL (0.13 mmol, 20 eq.) of triethyl amine then added, and the slightly cloudy solution stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. Excess PEG-5K-OSu was quenched by the addition of 7 uL (0.111 mmol, 10 eq.) of ethanol amine, and the reaction stirred overnight.<br>
PEGylation of reactive carboxyl groups, such as Asp or Glu side chains or a terminal carboxyl at Aaa15 on either a residue or surrogate, is accomplished by coupling PEG-NH2 (PEG-amine), to the construct containing a carboxylate group in the side chain of Asp or Glu or at the C-terminus. The peptide construct (0.005 mmol) is dissolved in DMSO (2 mL), followed by the addition of 55.5 mg (0.011 mmol, 2 eq) of PEG-NH2 and HOBt (0.01 mmol). The coupling is started by the addition of 0.0055 mmole of coupling reagent N-ethyJ-JM'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDAC). The slightly cloudy solution stirred at room temperature overnight. The PEGylated peptide construct is then purified by HPLC.<br>
PEGylation of reactive thiol groups, such as Cys or Hcys side chains or a thiol group in Q of an amino acid surrogate at Aaa1, is accomplished by treating the peptide construct in DMSO with PEG-methyl-maleimide reagent (SunBio, Orinda, California) overnight. The PEGylated peptide construct is then purified by HPLC.<br>
Following  PEGylation, the  resulting crude mixture was then  purified  by  HPLC,  yielding a PEG derivatized construct including one or more amino acid surrogates. In Vitro and In Vivo Test Systems<br>
Selected constructs were tested in assays to determine binding and functional status. The following assays were employed.<br><br><br>
Cell culture. A cDNA clone that encodes for human natriuratic peptide receptor A (NPRA) was purchased from Bio S&amp;T Inc. (Montreal, Quebec). The cDNA clone was inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) and transfected into HEK-293 cells. Stable clones were selected by  culture of cells in the presence of G418 sulfate. Expression of NPRA was examined by binding of [125l]-atrial natriuretic peptide ([125I]-ANP) to membrane homogenates prepared from clonal cell lines. HEK-hNPRA cells were maintained in culture at 37 oC in 5% C02 in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, G418 sulfate (300 ug/mL) sodium glutamate (0.29 mg/mL), penicillin (100 units/mL) and streprromycfrr (100 ug/mi).<br>
Competitive binding assay. A competitive inhibition binding assay was performed using crude membrane homogenates prepared from HEK-hNPRA cells. To prepare membrane homogenates, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 15 minutes at 4 °C in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4 + 5 mM EDTA). Cells were transferred from plates to polypropylene tubes and homogenized. Homogenates were centrifuged at 25,000 x g for 20 minutes. Pellets were resuspended in buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4) and 1 mM EDTA, homogenized and centrifuged at 25,000 x g for 20 minutes. Pellets were resuspended in buffer consisting of 100 mM Tris (pH 7.4) and 10 mM MgC!2 and stored at -80 °C until needed. On the day of an assay, homogenates were thawed and homogenized. Binding of [125I]-ANP was carried out in buffer containing 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCI, 2 mM CaCI2, 5 mM MgCI2l 0.1% BSA and 1 mM 1,10-phenanthroline. Homogenates (1-10 ug protein/well) were incubated with [125!]-ANP (25-30 pM) and increasing concentrations of competing ligands in Millipore filter plates for 120 minutes at 4 oC. Assays were stopped by addition of cold wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline) followed by filtration using a vacuum manifold. Bound radioactivity was determined using a gamma counter. Non-specific binding was defined by binding of [(125]-hANP to non-transfected HEK293 membranes. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism® curve-fitting software.<br>
General method for determination of ECM. Functional evaluation of constructs was performed by measuring the accumulation of intracellular cGMP in HEK-293 cells that express recombinant hNPR-A. HEK-NPRA cells were harvested by washing and centrifugation in Cell Dissociation Buffer (Gibco, Life Technologies). Pelleted cells were resuspended in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) containing 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCI2, 200 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM 1,10-phenanthroline and BSA (0.5 mg/mL). Following centrifugation, cells were resuspended in the above buffer supplemented with 0.5 mM 3-isobuty!-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). Cells (~2 x105/well) were added to each well of a 96-well plate and incubated for 15 minutes at 37 °C. Following the pre-incubation period, cells were incubated for an additional 15 minutes in the presence of increasing concentrations of constructs, The reaction was terminated by lysis of the cells with temperature shock. The reaction plate was incubated in a dry ice/ethanol bath for 15 minutes followed by incubation at 90 °C for 10 minutes. Accumulation of cGMP was measured using the cGMP Flashplate RIA (Perkin-Elmer). Data analysis and EC50 values were determined by using nonlinear regression analysis with GraphPad Prism® software.<br>
Determination of mass and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. The mass values of PEG-conjugated constructs were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (positive ion mode) using alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) as matrix. Methanol was used for sample preparation in construct to matrix ratios of 1:10, 1:20 and 1:30. Alternatively other matrices such as, sinapinic acid (SA) and 2, 5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB), and solvents such acetonitrile - 0.1% aqueous TFA can be used for sample preparation. Other determinations of mass values were made using a Waters MicroMass ZQ device utilizing a positive mode. For consructs that were not PEGylated, mass determinations were compared with calculated<br><br><br>
values and expressed in the form of mass weight plus two divided by two ((M+2)/2), unless otherwise specified.<br>
Proton NMR data was obtained using a Bruker 300 MHz spectrometer. The spectra were obtained after .dissolving constructs in a deuteriated solvent such as chloroform, DMSO, or methanol as appropriate.<br>
HPLC measurements were made using a Waters Alliance HT with a YMC Pack Pro C18 column (4.6 x 50 mm, 3 u) eluted at 1 mL/minute in a step-wise procedure. Solvent A (water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid v/v) and solvent B {acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid v/v) were used as mobile phases. For analysis of keto piperazine intermediates, the column was equilibrated with 10% B and then B was increased to 90% over a period of 8 minutes. For analysis of peptides, the column was equilibrated with 2% B and then B was increased to 90% over a period of 8 minutes.<br>
Animal Models - Blood Pressure Transducer Implantation. Rats are induced to a surgical plane of anesthesia with isoflurane and maintained on a heating pad. The abdomen is shaved and scrubbed with 70% alcohol and betadine solution. Using aseptic technique, a midline abdominal incision is made in order to expose the descending aorta and vena cava. The contents of the abdomen are retracted gently using wet sterile gauze and retractors. Based on the manufacturer's instructions (described in Data Sciences International's Multiplus TL Series Device Surgical Manual 2000: pp. 3.1-3.10), the abdominal aorta is carefully dissected from the surrounding fat and connective tissue and the catheter of the blood pressure transducer is inserted. The catheter of the transducer is secured into place using surgical glue and the body of the transducer stabilized by suturing to the abdominal wall (4-0 silk suture). Care is taken to ensure that hemostasis is maintained during the procedure and that blood flow is not compromised (e.g. aorta will not be occluded for more than 3 minutes at a time). Transducer placement is verified using the telemetry radio signal. After transducer placement, the gauze sponges are removed and the abdominal cavity is flushed with sterile saline. The abdominal incision is then sutured closed with nonabsorbable sutures (4-0 silk suture) in a simple interrupted pattern. The skin is closed using absorbable suture (4-0 vicryl). Finally the animal is removed from the isoflurane and placed in a warm environment while being monitored until it is fully awake.<br>
Surgical Induction of Congestive Heart Failure (Volume Overload). In this procedure, the descending aorta and vena cava are exposed in the same manner as it is in the implantation procedure for the telemetry device. Once access to the vessels between the renal and iliac bifurcation is obtained, a puncture is made with a 1.8 mm needle (outside diameter) to the descending aorta. The needle is advanced into the inferior vena cava and withdrawn. The ventral puncture site in the descending aorta is sealed with tissue adhesive. The persistence of a shunt between the aorta and vena cava is confirmed visually by the swelling of the vena cava and the mixing of the venous and arterial blood. In the event that a pressure transducer is also implanted, the two procedures are done concurrently. The general methods described in Flaim, S.F., W.J. Minteer, S.H. Nellis, and D.P. Clark: Chronic arteriovenous shunt: evaluation of a model for heart failure in rat. Am, J. Physiol. 236:H698-H704 (1979) and Garcia, R. and S. Diebold: Simple, rapid and effective method of producing aortocaval shunts in the rat. Cardiovasc. Res. 24:430-432 (1990), are incorporated here by reference.<br>
Blood Pressure Monitoring. Telemetry signals from the blood pressure transducers (model TA11PA-C40, Data Sciences International, St Paul, MN) are collected and analyzed using Dataquest A.R.T. Gold software version 3.0 (Data Sciences International). Rats were observed at approximately the same time each day. Each rat, in its home cage, is placed on a receiver in the observation room and allowed to adjust to the change in location for 30 minutes. Baseline recordings are taken for 30 minutes just prior to dosing and treatment recordings are taken for 135 minutes immediately following JV dosing and 210 minutes following SC dosing.   The data are compared to the results after saline dosing in a way similar to methods previously<br><br><br>

Diuresis and Natriuresis. Rats are induced to a surgical plane of anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital and maintained on a heating pad. The abdomen is shaved and scrubbed with 70% alcohol and betadine solution. Using aseptic technique, a midline abdominal incision is made in order to expose the urinary bladder. A purse-string suture is introduced to ventral surface of the bladder and a small incision is made within the suture area. The flared end of a catheter in inserted into the open in and the purse-string suture tightened around it to secure it in place. Urine is collected into preweighed microcentrifuge tubes at various time intervals before and after dosing in a way similar to methods published in Abassi, Z.A., JR. Powell, E. Golomb, and H.R. Keiser: Renal and systemic effects of urodilatin in rats with high-output heart failure. Am. J. Physiol. 262:F615-F621 (1992), incorporated here by reference. Urine volume is measured by weight.<br>

Construct 1-18 was stable in both rat and human plasma, with T1/2 of -2 hours at 37 °C. When administered IV, the in vivo T1/2 in rats was -20 minutes. Approximately 25 to 50% of the injected dose was bioavailable in rats when administered by a subcutaneous route. FIG. 2 depicts the concentration of construct 1-18 in ng/mL over time in rats, with the curve for "SC" indicating subcutaneous administration at a dose of 5 mg/kg, and the curve for "IV" indicating intravenous administration at a dose of 2 mg/kg.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
Blood pressure transducers were implanted in rats as described under the heading "Animal Models -Blood Pressure Transducer Implantation." Studies were conducted as described under the heading "Blood Pressure Monitoring." Studies included determination of changes in systolic biood pressure compared to saline following administration of constructs of the invention. In one study, rats were administered construct 1-63 by an IV route at 0.03 mg/kg body weight (n = 4), 0.1 mg/kg (n = 7) or 0.3 mg/kg (n = 8). The blood pressure was monitored at 5 minutes prior to IV administration and at 5, 10 and 15 minutes after administration, and thereafter at 15 minute intervals until 135 minutes post administration. At all time points for all doses the measured systolic blood pressure was lower than saline control, with the decrease in blood pressure ranging from a minimum of about 5% to a maximum of about 19%, generally in a dose dependent manner, and with the greatest response seen at 10 to 45 minutes after administration.<br>
In a second study, rats were administered construct 1-63 by a subcutaneous route at 0.3 mg/kg body weight (n = 8), 1.0 mg/kg (n = 7) or 3.0 mg/kg (n = 7). The blood pressure was monitored at 15 and 5 minutes prior to SC administration and at 5, 10 and 15 minutes after administration, and thereafter at 15 minute intervals until 210 minutes post administration. At all time points for all doses the measured systolic blood pressure was lower than saline control. At 0.3 mg/kg SC, the decrease in systolic pressure was in the range of 2% at time points after 2 hours post administration, which was within the error range. However, at all other time points for 0.3 mg/kg SC, and at all time points for 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg, the decrease was statistically different and lower than the saline control. At 3.0 mg/kg a maximum decrease of approximately 20% to 23% in systolic pressure was seen at 45 to 120 minutes post administration, with a maximum decrease in the same time period at 1.0 mg/kg of 17% to 19%.<br>
In a third study study, rats were administered construct 1-18 by an IV route at 0.3 mg/kg of body weight (n = 8). The blood pressure was monitored at 5 minutes prior to IV administration and at 5, 10 and 15 minutes after administration, and thereafter at 15 minute intervals until 135 minutes post administration. At all time points for all doses the measured systolic blood pressure was lower than saline control, with the decrease in blood pressure ranging from a minimum of about 5% to a maximum of about 13%, with the greatest response seen at 15 minutes after administration.<br>
In a fourth study, rats were administered construct 1-18 by a subcutaneous route at 0.1 mg/kg body weight (n = 4), 0.3 mg/kg (n = 7) or 1.0 mg/kg (n = 8). The blood pressure was monitored at 15 and 5 minutes prior to SC administration and at 5, 10 and 15 minutes after administration, and thereafter at 15 minute intervals until 225 minutes post administration. At all time points for all doses the measured systolic blood pressure was lower than saline control. At 0.1 mg/kg SC, the decrease in systolic pressure was not statistically relevant after about two and one-half hours.   However, at all other time points for 0.1 mg/kg SC, and at all time points less<br><br><br>
than about two and one-half hours for 0.3 and at all time points for 1.0 mg/kg, the decrease was statistically different and lower than the saline control.  At 1.0 mg/kg a maximum decrease of approximately 9% to 13% in  systolic pressure was seen at 45 to 120 minutes post administration.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
Total urine output in rats was measured as described under the heading "Diuresis and Natriuresis." Groups of four animals were administered constructs 1-18 and 1-63 by IV routes, with animals receiving 0.03 mg/kg of body weight, 0.1 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg of construct 1-18, and 0.1 mg/kg of body weight, 0.3 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg of construct 1-63. Total urine output over 30 minutes postdose was measured, with results as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
In a separate study, total urine about was similarly measured in a group of four animals receiving doses of 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg of body weight of construct 1-63 by a SC route, with saline used as a control. Total urine output over 45 minutes postdose was measured. Results are as shown in FIG. 4.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
The pharmacokinetics of selected constructs of the invention were studied in male Sprague-Dawley rats following intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) administration. Pharmacokinetic parameters of selected constructs in rats were determined and summarized in Tables 3 and 4.<br>
Constructs of the invention as indicated in Tables 4 and 5 were prepared as the TFA salt and dissolved in saline at 1 ml_/kg for both IV and SC dosing routes. The IV dose was administered via a femoral artery cannula at target doses of 0.3 and 2 mg/kg. The SC dose was administered at target doses of 1 and 5 mg/kg. Animals were not fasted overnight before dosing. Blood was collected into containers containing dipotassium EDTA at predetermined intervals from a previously implanted cannula in the jugular vein. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation of the blood and stored at -70 °C until analysis.<br>
Data analysis utilized a LC-MS/MS system including a Leap Technologies HTS-PAL autosampler equipped with a 100 uL injection loop, two Shimadzu Pumps and a Sciex API 4000 mass spectrometer. Chromatographic separation of the analytes was achieved on a Luna C18 column (4.6 x 100 mm; 3 p) eluted at 1 mL/min with a step-wise procedure. Solvent A (water containing 0.1% formic acid v/v) and solvent B (acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid v/v) were used as the mobile phases. Initially, the column was equilibrated with 5% B and, 2 minutes after sample injection, B was increased to 60% over a period of 0.5 minutes and held at this concentration for 1.1 minutes. The composition of B was increased to 80% in 1.4 minutes and maintained for 0.3 minutes. The composition of B was returned to 5% in 0.2 minutes. The total run time was 6 minutes. Mass spectrometric detection of the analytes was accomplished using the Turbo lonspray interface operated in the positive ion mode. Analyte response was measured by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) of the transitions of the protonated precursor ions to the selected product ions.<br>
Aliquots of plasma (100 uL) were mixed with the internal standard (IS) and subjected to solid phase extraction using C8 cartridges in a 96 well format. After preconditioning of the C8 cartridges with 1 mL of methanol and 1 mL of 2% ammonium hydroxide In water, plasma samples were loaded onto the cartridges. Following washing the cartridges with 2% ammonium hydroxide in 40% methanol, constructs were eluted from the cartridges with 1 mL of 2% acetic acid in 60% methanol. The eluents were transferred to a clean plate, evaporated under a stream of N2 and the residues were resuspended in 100 uL of 20 mM ammonium acetate and acetonitrile (6:4, v:v) prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. Calibration standards (2 - 1000 ng/mL) were prepared in<br><br><br>
the same manner by adding construct at various concentrations and its respective IS to 100 uL of untreated rat  plasma. Similarly, quality control samples were prepared by adding construct and IS to 100 ul of control plasma at 3 different concentrations (3.5, 75 and 750 ng/mL) of construct.<br>
Data were acquired and processed by Sciex Analyst 1.4.1 software. Peak area ratios of construct to IS were plotted as a function of the nominal concentrations of construct. Linear regression using a weighting factor of 1/x was used to calculate the concentration of construct in plasma samples. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for this assay typically was 2 or 5 ng/mL.<br>
Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by established non-compartmentaf method (Win-Nonfin version 2.1; Consulting Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) was determined using linear trapezoidal interpolation in the ascending slope and logarithmic trapezoidal interpolation in the descending slope. The portion of the AUC from the last measurable concentration to infinity was estimated from the equation Ct/kel, where Ct represents the last measurable concentration and kel is the elimination rate constant. The latter was determined from the concentration versus time curve by linear regression at the terminal phase of the semi-logarithmic plot. Table 3<br>

EXAMPLE 18<br>
Applicants have also discovered an inverse correlation between the extent of resistance to digestion by neutral endopeptidase of a construct according to the invention and its pharmacokinetic clearance (CL), as shown in Table 7 betow. Neutral endopeptidase ("NEP") is an endogenous enzyme that inactivates and clears all three human natriuretic peptides. NEP is present within renal tubular cells and vascular cells. NEP is highly homologous between mammalian species. The percent identity of NEP between Rat and Mouse is 98.5%, between Human and Mouse is 93.6%, and between Human and Rat is 93.7%.<br>
NEP resistance of various constructs of the invention was evaluated using the following experimental procedure. All constructs were diluted in 0.1 M Tris-HCL buffer (pH 7.4) to 100 uM. 40 uL of diluted constructs were added to each tube and all tubes were kept on ice. 40 uL of diluted NEP, either human recombinant NEP (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, catalogue #1182-ZN) at 8 ng/uL or mouse NEP (R&amp;D Systems, catalog #1126-ZN) at 2.5 ng/uL, was added to each tube. The tubes were mixed gently and spun. All tubes were then incubated at 37 °C for 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 hours. At the end of the incubation time, the reaction was stopped by adding 5 uL of 10% TFA. Constructs were linearized using TCEP (Tris[2-carboxyethyl] phosphine. The extent to which NEP was active against the constructs was then analyzed by HPLC and/or LC/MS. Data analysis included determining the percent of remaining starting material, i.e., undigested peptide construct, and the percent and sequence of each proteolytic fragment.<br><br><br>
