				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to electrical switches and, more<br>
particularly, to automatic transfer switches and control thereof.<br>
Many businesses use transfer switches for switching power sources, for<br>
example, from a public utility source to a private secondary supply, automatically.<br>
within a matter of seconds. Critical load businesses, such as, for example, hospitals,<br>
airport radar towers, and high volume data centers are dependent upon automatic<br>
transfer switches to provide continuous power. Transfer switches typically utilize a<br>
plurality of contacts that can be open or closed.<br>
Typically, automatic transfer switches are controlled using relay logic,<br>
programmable logic controllers (PLCs) or embedded controllers. In known systems,<br>
the embedded controller monitors the public utility power source for a fault condition.<br>
Upon recognizing any one of a number of faults with the utility power, the embedded<br>
controller is configured to switch in the secondary source of power, typically a<br>
generator, via the transfer switches.<br>
Known automatic transfer switch controllers incorporate external<br>
components to accomplish the control task and require hardware and software<br>
redesigns when making input/output (I/O) changes. Further, known automatic transfer<br>
switch controllers are unable to communicate with external devices for software<br>
selection of options.<br>
Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide systems for automatic<br>
transfer switch control which eliminate external components and provide flexibility<br>
for I/O circuit redesign. It would be further desirable to have an automatic transfer<br>
switch controller with a communications interface to enable and select software<br>
options from an external device.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An automatic transfer switch controller includes a power supply circuit<br>
to regulate and filter input power. Also included is a transformer to convert utility and<br>
generator power sources into power supply voltages and voltage sensing sources for<br>
the controller. A voltage sense signal conditioning circuit is included as is a solenoid<br>
driver circuit used to drive automatic transfer switch solenoids. The controller uses an<br>
embedded microcontroller to monitor utility and generator voltages which is<br>
interfaced to a user interface for operator entry of instructions. An LED indicator<br>
interfaced to said microcontroller is used to indicate operator entry of instructions at<br>
the operator interface.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is a simplified schematic showing electrical routing within an<br>
automatic transfer switch system; and<br>
Figure 2 is a block diagram of an automatic transfer switch controller.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 is a simplified schematic diagram 10 showing electrical<br>
routing within an automatic transfer switch (ATS) system. Included in diagram 10 are<br>
a utility source 12 and a generator source 14. Each of utility source l2 and generator<br>
source 14 are routed through circuit breakers 16 to a transfer switch 18. Transfer<br>
switch 18 is configured to route electrical power from utility source 12 through<br>
transfer switch 18 to a main breaker panel 20, through which electricity is distributed<br>
throughout a facility. Transfer switch 18 is further configured with a controller (not<br>
shown) to monitor the power from utility source 12 for power quality, for example <br>
voltage, power factor, electrical noise and the like. When the transfer switch<br>
controller senses a problem with power quality, based upon preset limits, the transfer<br>
switch controller commands transfer switch 18 to switch to electrical power from<br>
generator source 14, on a temporary basis, until the transfer switch controller senses<br>
that the power quality from utility source 12 has returned to an acceptable level.<br>
Figure 2 is a block diagram of an automatic transfer switch controller<br>
40. Controller 40 includes a microcontroller 42, a memory 44, a user interface 46, a<br>
power input section 48, an output section 50 which is configured to command one or<br>
more transfer switches 18 (shown in Figure 1) to go to power from a generator source<br>
or to return to a utility source of power. Controller 40 also includes a configuration<br>
section 52, a communications port 54 and a multi-function input/output (I/O) port 56<br>
described below in more detail.<br>
The term microcontroller, as used herein, also refers to<br>
microprocessors, reduced instruction set circuits (RISC), application specific<br>
integrated circuits (ASICs), logic circuits, and any other circuit or processor capable<br>
of executing the programs described above.<br>
Controller 40 is a low cost, high performance ATS controller with<br>
software selectable options. In one exemplary embodiment, software options are to be<br>
enabled or disabled through the use of a factory configuration program via port 54,<br>
which is for example, an RS232 port.<br>
Controller 40 is configured with external connections (not shown in<br>
Figure 2) to allow for adaptation of multiple function input/output (I/O) boards. I/O<br>
boards give controller 40 a modular configuration where different options can be<br>
made available to the end user if needed.<br>
In one exemplary embodiment, functions of controller 40 are<br>
implemented on a main control circuit board which includes control and conditioning<br>
circuits as described below.<br>
Power input section 48 includes transformers to convert power from<br>
utility source and generator source 14 (both shown in Figure 1) into power supply<br>
1 voltages for powering controller 40 and into voltages to be sensed by controller 40.<br>
I Power input section 48 regulates and filters raw supply voltages from the transformers<br>
 before it is applied to the main control board of controller 40 and any optional I/O<br>
boards such that correct operating voltages and currents are applied to such boards.<br>
Power input section 48 further includes a voltage sense signal<br>
conditioning circuit which uses low pass filtering techniques to remove all unwanted<br>
noise from the raw voltage supply before it is applied to analog-to-digital converter<br>
(ADC) pins on microcontroller 42. Filtering allows controller 40 to correctly sense<br>
voltage and frequency when utility source 12 or generator source 14 contain large<br>
amounts of harmonic distortion.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment of controller 40, output section 50 is<br>
configured as a solenoid driver circuit which includes two options of solenoid drivers,<br>
both of which are implemented on the main control board. A first solenoid driver<br>
option is configured with on-board relays when the utility and generator power<br>
sources are 240Vac and below. A second solenoid driver option is configured with<br>
solid state devices when the utility and generator power sources are greater than<br>
240Vac, but less than 600 Vac. The solenoid driver circuit is used to control the<br>
power supplied to an ATS drive solenoid which causes swithcing from one electrical<br>
power source to another in transfer switch 18 (shown in Figure 1). <br>
 Using user interface 46 a user can momentarily energize a normal<br>
output causing the ATS to transfer to normal position, the position where utility power<br>
is used. Momentarily energizing an emergency output causes the ATS to transfer to<br>
the position where generator power is used. In order to protect the ATS drive<br>
solenoid from damage, a solenoid saver scheme is implemented in controller 40 which<br>
controls the maximum on time and the number of tries a drive solenoid can be<br>
energized for before shutting down the drive circuit and initiating a diagnostic mode.<br>
All functions on the main control board are controlled by<br>
microcontroller 42 which uses custom written firmware to monitor the utility and<br>
generator voltages and frequency, monitor user interface updating indicator LEDs on<br>
user interface 46, perform real time clock functions, monitor ATS position and control<br>
the ATS. Microcontroller 42 also monitors and controls all external I/O connections<br>
used to control any auxiliary I/O boards. In a further embodiment, controller 40 is<br>
configured with a generator cool down timer, a geneator warmup timer, a loss of<br>
power delay timer, a generator fail-to-start timer, a generator crank timer, a generator<br>
pause timer, a generator overload timer and an utility stabilization before switchback<br>
timer.<br>
Controller 40 includes a configuration section 52. In one embodiment,<br>
configuration section 52 includes a jumper panel. Jumpers are installed by a user to<br>
select one of a seven, 14, 21, or 28 day cycle for a built in ATS exerciser. The<br>
exerciser period can be adjusted for seven, 14, 21, or 28 days by selecting the<br>
appropriate jumpers setting located on the main control board.<br>
Configuration section 52 further includes jumper selectable voltage and<br>
frequency selections. The voltage controller 40 can sense is selectable from 120, 208,<br>
220, and 240 Vac through the use of the correct jumper settings. Voltage ranges in the<br>
380, 415, 440, and 480Vac are also selectable, but require that a different transformer<br>
be used in controller 40. Jumpers are also available for frequency selections of 50 Hz<br>
and 60 Hz.<br>
Controller 40 is further configured with a passive load shed option<br>
which, when coupled with a load shed I/O option board will disconnect certain high<br>
kilowatt loads before the controller transfers loads from utility power to generator<br>
power, thereby preventing unwanted loads from over loading generator 14.<br>
In another embodiment, controller 40 is configurable with a generator<br>
control board (not shown) option which is an optional I/O board that connects to the<br>
main control board and contains I/O functions which are accessible at I/O port 56.<br>
Examples of I/O functions include, but are not limited to oil pressure sensing,<br>
temperature sensing, and a set of dry contacts for starter motor control including a<br>
fuel/run contact output and a start contact output. When a generator control board is<br>
included in controller 40, a software control bit is enabled to allow access to the board<br>
I/O functions.<br>
In still another embodiment, controller 40 is configurable with a three<br>
phase sense board (not shown). The three-phase sense board is an optional I/O board<br>
that expands controller 40 from single-phase voltage sensing to three-phase voltage<br>
sensing on both utility and generator power sources. The three-phase sense board<br>
contains all of the necessary conditioning circuitry necessary for proper voltage and<br>
frequency detection.<br>
Controller 40 solves problems present in known controllers. Such<br>
problems include external relay transformer boxes separate form the controller, a need<br>
for an external exerciser clock and the ability to make I/O changes without complete<br>
redesign of the ATS controller. In addition, controller 40 locates all ATS control<br>
components and voltage conditioning components on a main control board, thereby<br>
allowing for other I/O functionality to be implemented on option boards as described<br>
above.<br>
While the invention has been described in terms of various specific<br>

with modification within the spirit and scope of the claims.<br>
