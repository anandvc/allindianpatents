				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a rotary piston engine.<br>
The rotary piston engine, also called the cat and mouse engine or the central axis rotating piston machine has four pistons rotating with variable angular velocity about a common axis, whereby the volume of the four chambers formed between the rotating pistons continuously varies in such a way that the four chambers complete the four independent thermodynamic cycles in one revolution. During this time the rotating pistons are subjected to two accelerations and two decelerations.<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a rotary piston engine with the pistons running at variable angular velocities, as in the case of the known rotary piston engine, by means of a specially designed Hooke's joint. The advantage of this mechanism in the proposed engine is that it can withstand inertia forces safely; at the same time, the manufacturing process of the elements of the said mechanism is rendered simple.<br><br>
This invention has an efficient sealing system for<br>
the  combustion chambers, keeping in mind  various<br>
factors  such as differential  thermal  expansion,<br>
continuously     varying    centrifugal     force,<br>
continuously  varying inertia force,  continuously<br>
varying distance travelled by the sealing elements<br>
and continuously varying frictional force.<br>
This   invention   also   has efficient cooling   system.<br>
Heat and frictional losses are also reduced in this invention.<br>
The rotary piston engine, according to this invention, provided with a cooling system, comprises four rotary pistons defining an equal number of combustion chambers therebetween; an output shaft coupled to the said pistons; second and third shafts respectively connected to the output shaft by Hooke's joints, said second and third shafts being respectively attached to two pairs of the said pistons.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings which also<br><br>
illustrate, by way of example, one of various possible embodiments of the rotary piston engine propose herein and wherein<br>
Fig.l  illustrates the known rotary piston engine driven by  a<br>
planetary gear system G<br>
Figs. 2<a to> illustrate, schematically, the four strokes<br>
of  the  known  rotary piston engine  completed  in  90  deg.<br>
rotation of the output shaft<br>
Figs. 3 and 4 illustrate a pair of rotary pistons in  coplanar<br>
to a female body and a male body respectively<br>
Fig.  5 illustrates the assembled view of the female body  and<br>
male  body  1,2 with the stationary cylinder in  between  them<br>
(cf. the views shown in Figs.3 and 4).  The inlet and  exhaust<br>
ports  are  indicated  by  I and  E.   C   is  the  stationary<br>
cylinder,  the inner surface of which has a  partial  toroidal<br>
shape.<br>
Fig. 6   illustrates the common output shaft S coupled  to  the<br>
first shaft S1 through a Hooke's joint H1.  S1 is connected to<br>
body 2.<br>
Fig.7  illustrates  the common output shaft S coupled  to  the<br>
second  shaft S2 through a Hooke's joint H2.  S2 is  connected<br>
to body 1.<br><br>
Fig.  S  illustrates the assembled view of the  Hooke's  joint arrangement and<br>
Fig. 9 illustrates the cooling system.<br>
The rotary engine proposed herein will be seen to comprise four rotary pistons P defining a equal number of combustion chambers C therebetween. As in the case of the known rotary engine the pistons consist of two pairs, the pistons of a pair being coupled together. The operation of the engine to provide the four strokes of suction, compression, expansion and exhaust are the same as those associated with the known rotary engine and is therefore not discussed here in detail. However, in the rotary engine proposed herein, the pistons P are provided with a torodial shape and are made an integral part of bodies 1 and 2. <figs. and for better performance by reduction of heat frictional losses. the cylinder surface in bodies between pistons has a partial torodial shape. output shaft s is coupled to said however one end each second third shafts s1 s2 are respectively connected hooke joints h2></figs.><br>
and female, the other end each of said second and third shafts being respectively attached to two pairs of the said pistons, so that the two pairs of pistons convey power through the respective shafts S1 and S2 through the Hooke's joints to the common output shaft S.<br>
Rotating piston seals K are arranged in grooves on the periphery of the rotating pistons P. Stationary cylinder seals SK and SRK and shaft seals CK and CRK are provided efficent  sealing.<br>
A cooling system comprises a cooling jacket J with two halves joined together, with gaskets in between, to form a water tight seal, said jacket having fins F for dissipation of heat.<br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation, there being no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding any equivalents of the features illustrated and described, but it is understood that various other embodiments of the rotary engine proposed herein are possible without departing, from  the  scope  and  ambit  of   this<br><br>
I Claims<br>
1.	A rotary piston engine, provided with a cooling system and comprising four rotary pistons defining an equal number of combustion chambers therebetween; an output shaft coupled to the said pistons; second and third shafts respectively connected to the output shaft by Hooke's joints, said second and third shafts being respectively attached to two pairs of the said pistons.<br>
2.	An engine as claimed in Claim 1 wherein each of the said pistons has a toroidal shape.<br>
