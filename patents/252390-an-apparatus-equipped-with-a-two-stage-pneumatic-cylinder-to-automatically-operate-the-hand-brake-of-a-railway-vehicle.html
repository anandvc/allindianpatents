TWO-STAGE CYLINDER FOR AUTOMATIC APPLICATION AND RELEASE OF A HAND BRAKE OF A<br>
RAILWAY VEHICLE<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates, in general, to hand brake assemblies for use on<br>
railway type vehicles and, more particularly, this invention relates to an apparatus to<br>
automatically activate and apply the brakes on a railway vehicle without requiring an<br>
operator to manually wind the chain on such hand brake.<br>
[0002] Prior to the conception and development of the present invention, railway car hand<br>
brake mechanisms were well known in the art. They usually include a large, rotatable hand<br>
wheel disposed in a vertical plane and mounted on a shaft which, through a gear train, can<br>
rotate a chain drum to wind up a chain that is secured at its end remote from the chain drum<br>
to the brake rigging of the railway car. As the hand wheel is rotated in one direction, the<br>
brakes are applied and rotation of the hand wheel shaft in the opposite direction is prevented<br>
by a pawl, which engages a detent wheel on the hand wheel shaft.<br>
[0003] The brakes may be released by disengaging the pawl from the detent wheel but this<br>
causes rapid rotation of the hand wheel and the gears of the gear train. To avoid rapid<br>
rotation of the hand wheel, hand brake mechanisms have been devised which are known as<br>
"quick release" mechanisms. Generally these quick release mechanisms include a releasable<br>
connecting means between the hand wheel shaft and the gear train. When the connecting<br>
means is released, the gears of the gear train rotate rapidly, without constraint by the pawl<br>
and detent wheel, but the hand wheel remains stationary.<br>
[0004] The Association of American Railroads (AAR) promulgates specifications for the<br>
design and operation of railway car hand brake mechanisms. Vertical wheel, gear train, hand<br>
brake mechanisms are classified in three categories, namely:<br>
[0005] (1) Standard power - provides an average force on the chain of 3350 lbs. with a<br>
125 lb. turning force applied to the rim of a wheel twenty-two inches in diameter.<br>
[0006] (2) Intermediate power - provides an average force on the chain of 4475 lbs. with<br>
a 125 lb. turning force applied to the rim of a wheel twenty-two inches in diameter.<br>
[0007] (3) High power - provides an average force on the chain of 6800 lbs. with a 125<br>
lb. turning force applied to the rim of a wheel twenty-two inches in diameter.<br>
[0008] After setting of the brakes, when the hand brake mechanism is released the gears of<br>
the gear train rotate rapidly. This results in the gears and other components being subjected<br>
1<br><br><br>
	WO 2006/049838	PCT/US2005/036858<br>
to high forces and to shock, particularly, when the chain becomes fully let-out from the chain<br>
drum.<br>
[0009] In recent times, the AAR has added a life cycle test to its specifications, and hand<br>
brake mechanisms which do not meet the life cycle test cannot be sold for use on railway cars<br>
operated in interchange service on United States railroads. The AAR life cycle test for quick<br>
release brakes requires that such latter brakes withstand 3000 quick release operations.<br>
[0010] To meet such life cycle test requirements, even standard power hand brake<br>
mechanisms had to be modified when the life cycle test was adopted. When intermediate<br>
power hand brake mechanisms of the type sold prior to the adoption of the life cycle test were<br>
subjected to the life cycle test, it was found mat the components thereof wore prematurely or<br>
were damaged, and it was found to be necessary to add a shock retarder, or absorber, external<br>
to the hand brake mechanism, to overcome such wear and damage. Of course, such an<br>
external shock retarder is undesirable not only because it is external to the hand brake<br>
mechanism but also because of the additional cost and because it requires field modification<br>
of the equipment on a railway car if the intermediate power hand brake mechanism is used to<br>
replace a standard power hand brake mechanism. High power hand brake mechanisms sold<br>
prior to the adoption of the life cycle test were similarly unable to pass the life cycle test. It<br>
should be borne in mind that such high power brake mechanisms normally have additional<br>
gears to provide the desired force on the chain, and this results in a higher speed of rotation of<br>
at least some of the gears during release of the hand brake mechanism.<br>
[0011] Although the use of an external shock retarder might have solved the problems with<br>
the higher power hand brake mechanism, a change in the AAR specifications would have<br>
been required to permit the use of such an external shock retarded Attempts were made to<br>
redesign the high power hand brake mechanism, such as by making it stronger, so that it<br>
would meet the life cycle test without the use of an external shock retarder, but the attempts<br>
were not successful.<br>
[0012] One of the characteristics of railway car brakes with which the invention is<br>
concerned is that the force applied to the chain, and hence, the parts of the hand brake, is non-<br>
linear and depends on the extent to which the brakes are applied or released. Thus, as the<br>
brakes are applied, relatively little force is required to take up the slack in the chain and the<br>
brake rigging, but to meet AAR requirements, the final force on the chain must be as set forth<br>
above, namely, 3350 lbs. for a standard power brake, 4475 lbs. for an intermediate power<br>
brake and 6800 lbs. for a high power brake. After slack in the rigging is taken up, which may<br>
require, for example, 5-15 inches of chain travel, the force on the chain increases<br>
2<br><br><br>
WO 2006/049838	PCT/US2005/036858<br>
exponentially, e.g. from 200 lbs. to the final value, as the brake hand wheel is further turned<br>
to set the brakes. In reaching the final value after the slack is taken up, the chain may travel<br>
only two or three inches.<br>
[0013] Similarly, when the hand brake is released, the chain force decreases exponentially<br>
and reaches a relatively small value shortly after the hand brake is released. The<br>
aforementioned co-pending application teaches a single stage, double acting cylinder which<br>
displaces the same volume of fluid pressure with each stroke regardless of the resulting force<br>
in the hand break mechanism. As a result, a partial amount of fluid pressure is being wasted<br>
at the beginning of the brake application cycle, where relatively little force is required to take<br>
up the slack in the chain. Since the source of said fluid pressure is typically an emergency<br>
reservoir having a predetermined volume, less fluid pressure will be available at the end of<br>
the brake application to meet chain force requirement.<br>
[0014] As it can be seen from the above discussion, it would be advantageous to optimize<br>
the consumption of fluid pressure so that less fluid is consumed during the first stage of brake<br>
application leaving more fluid available during the critical end stages of brake application<br>
when higher pressure is necessary to meet the minimum chain force requirements.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0015] The present invention comprises a two-stage application cylinder, having a primary<br>
drive rod and a secondary drive rod. A drive arm is attached to the primary drive rod at one<br>
end and engages a lever at the distal end. An operating pawl is attached to the lever and a<br>
spring means is provided for urging the operating pawl into contact with a ratchet. This<br>
ratchet is engageable with at least one gear of a hand brake gear assembly disposed in a<br>
housing member of the hand brake assembly. At the beginning of the braking cycle,<br>
application of a force within the application cylinder causes the primary drive rod and drive<br>
arm to move outwardly from the cylinder and apply a downward force to the lever, which<br>
causes the operating pawl to engage a tooth within the ratchet. A primary return spring is<br>
provided within the application cylinder to urge the drive arm back to its original position.<br>
Rotation of the ratchet causes the gear of the hand brake gear assembly to rotate in a<br>
direction, which will cause an application of the brake means. Repeated applications of<br>
pressure within the application cylinder enables the gear of the hand brake gear assembly to<br>
rotate a sufficient amount to result in an application of the brakes. A holding pawl is also<br>
provided which cooperates with the ratchet. At the end of the braking cycle, continuing<br>
application of the fluid pressure within the cylinder causes the secondary drive rod to move<br>
outwardly from the cylinder and apply a required force to complete a braking application. At<br>
3<br><br><br>
WO 2006/049838	PCT/US2005/036858<br>
least one control valve means is engageable with the trigger attached to lever to control the<br>
operation of the application cylinder. At least one control valve means is also provided to<br>
redirect the path of the fluid pressure to the other side of the cylinder and aid a return spring<br>
in completely returning the primary piston to its original position.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0016] It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an automatic application<br>
hand brake, which reduces the consumption of fluid pressure during the first stages of brake<br>
application when minimal force is realized within the winding apparatus hence conserving<br>
fluid pressure for the critical end of the application during which time higher pressure is<br>
required to achieve Ihe minimum chain force required for braking.<br>
[0017] It is a further object of the present invention to provide an automatic application<br>
hand brake, which can be converted for use with the presently used automatic activation hand<br>
brake winding mechanisms.<br>
[0018] In addition to the various objects and advantages of the present invention which<br>
have been generally described above, there will be various other objects and advantages of<br>
the invention that will become more readily apparent to those persons skilled in the relevant<br>
art from the following more detailed description of the invention, particularly, when the<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0026] The following background information is provided to assist the reader to understand<br>
the environment in which the invention will typically be used. The terms used herein are not<br>
intended to be limited to any particular narrow interpretation unless specifically stated<br>
otherwise in this document.<br>
[0027] Prior to proceeding to the more detailed description of the various embodiments of<br>
the present invention, for the sake of clarity and understanding of such invention, it should be<br>
noted that identical components having identical functions have been identified with identical<br>
reference numerals throughout each of the figures illustrated herein.<br>
[0028] hi reference to Figures 2 through 7, the automatic application hand brake of the<br>
invention comprises an operating means, generally designated 300, engageable with such<br>
hand brake. In the presently preferred embodiment operating means 300 includes a spring<br>
return, two-stage cylinder. The presently preferred pressure fluid is pneumatic.<br>
Alternatively, hydraulic fluid pressure can be utilized when required. Pneumatic cylinder 300<br>
comprising an outer cylindrical casing member 324, a primary piston member 308 having a<br>
first surface and an opposed second surface and being mounted for reciprocal movement<br>
within a cylindrical casing formed by the inner surface of the secondary rod 304.<br>
[0029] Upon the application of pneumatic pressure thereto, a convention seal member 326<br>
adjacent a first end of the piston 308 and contacting the inner surface of the secondary piston<br>
member 304 so as to provide an airtight chamber at one end of the cylindrical member such<br>
that application of pneumatic pressure therein and against the first end of the piston 308<br>
enables forward movement of piston 308. A primary return spring 312 is provided to return<br>
the piston 308 to its initial position. The opposed second end of the piston 308 is attached to<br>
a first portion of primary drive rod 302. A second portion of the primary drive rod 302 is<br>
connected to a first portion of the drive arm 306, having a second portion engageable with a<br>
lever 152.<br>
[0030] Furthermore, pneumatic cylinder 300 includes a secondary piston member 310<br>
having a first surface and an opposed second surface and being mounted for reciprocal<br>
5<br><br><br>
WO 2006/049838	PCT/US2005/036858<br>
movement along the inner surface of cylindrical casing 324. Upon the application of<br>
pneumatic pressure (hereto, a conventional seal member 328 adjacent a first end of the piston<br>
310 and contacting the inner surface of the cylindrical casing member 324 so as to provide an<br>
airtight chamber at one end of the cylindrical member such that application of pneumatic<br>
pressure therein and against the first end of the piston 310 enables forward movement of such<br>
piston 310.<br>
[0031] A secondary return spring 314 is provided to return piston 308 to its initial position.<br>
The opposed second end of piston 310 is connected to the second portion of the secondary<br>
drive rod 304. A first pneumatic fluid pressure communications means 320 disposed within<br>
cylindrical casing 324 enables the application into and the evacuation of the pneumatic fluid<br>
pressure from the piston cavity. The first fluid pressure communication means 320 may be<br>
any well known type capable of supplying pneumatic fluid pressure into the piston cavity. A<br>
second pneumatic fluid pressure communication means 316 disposed within cylindrical<br>
casing 324 enables application into and evacuation of the pneumatic fluid pressure from the<br>
rod side of the secondary piston 310 cavity. Furthermore, such fluid pressure communication<br>
means 316 enables application into and evacuation of fluid pressure from the rod side of the<br>
primary piston 308 cavity when the secondary rod is in the steady state position shown in<br>
Figures 2 and 3.<br>
[0032] Additionally a third fluid pressure communication means 318 of predetermined<br>
geometry disposed within cylinder 300 enables the application and evacuation of fluid<br>
pressure between the rod side of the primary piston 308 cavity and the rod side of the<br>
secondary piston 310 cavity as well as to allow for a predetermined rate of flow of pneumatic<br>
fluid, acting in cooperation with fluid pressure communication means 316, to maintain a<br>
predetermined range of fluid pressure acting against the rod side of the secondary piston 310<br>
in cooperation with spring 314 to maintain the secondary piston in a steady state during<br>
forward travel of primary piston 308 as shown in Figure 2.<br>
[0033] Furthermore, fluid pressure communication means 318 enables application and<br>
evacuation of fluid from the rod side of the primary piston 308 cavity when the secondary rod<br>
304 is in an extended position as shown in Figure 4. At least one operating pawl (not shown)<br>
is attached to the lever 152 and a spring.means 156 is provided for urging the operating pawl<br>
(not shown) into contact with a ratchet (not shown). This ratchet (not shown) is engageable<br>
with at least one gear 14 of a hand brake gear assembly 40 disposed in a housing member of<br>
the hand brake assembly 20. Initial application of fluid pressure through first fluid<br>
communication means 320 produces a force against the primary drive rod piston 308 of the<br>
6<br><br><br>
WO 2006/049838	PCT/US2005/036858<br>
operating cylinder 300 which causes the drive arm 306 to move outwardly from the cylinder<br>
and apply a downward force to the lever 152 which causes the operating pawl (not shown) to<br>
engage a tooth within the ratchet (not shown). Upon retraction, primary rod return spring 312<br>
is provided within the operating cylinder 300 to urge the drive arm 306 back to its original<br>
position with the aid of fluid pressure entering through secondary rod orifice 318. Rotation<br>
of the ratchet (not shown) causes the gear 14 of the hand brake gear assembly 40 to rotate in a<br>
direction which will cause an application of the brake means. A holding pawl (not shown), is<br>
also provided which cooperates with a ratchet (not shown). At least one control valve is<br>
engageable with the trigger 172 attached to lever 152 to control the operation of the operating<br>
cylinder 300. This control valve system includes a first reciprocating valve means 220 and a<br>
second reciprocating valve means 230. At least one control valve means 240 is also provided<br>
to redirect the path of the fluid pressure through end fluid communication means 316 and<br>
through secondary rod orifice 318 of the cylinder 300 to aid a primary rod return spring 312<br>
in completely returning the piston 308 to its fully returned position. Refer now, more<br>
particularly to Figure 1, where under steady state conditions, the primary cylinder piston 308<br>
is completely returned by it's spring 312. Consequently, there is no air pressure behind the<br>
piston 308, and to start an application all that is required is to activate pushbutton 202<br>
attached to application valve member 200 which begins the process of winding up the brake.<br>
It allows a source of fluid pressure 50 from an emergency reservoir (not shown) to flow<br>
through the valve 200 and into pilot 212 attached to activation valve 210. The build-up of<br>
pressure in the pilot 212 to a predetermined value causes valve 210 to open and allow fluid<br>
pressure 50 to flow through the valve 210 to a first reciprocating valve 220 and a second -<br>
reciprocating valve 230.<br>
[0034] In further reference to FIG. 5, first trigger 170 engages pushbutton 232 attached to<br>
valve 230 and allows fluid pressure 50 to flow through valve 230 into pilot 224 attached to<br>
first reciprocating valve 220. The predetermined pressure in the pilot 224 will cause the<br>
valve 220 to shift and allow fluid pressure 50 to flow through valve 220 in four directions.<br>
The primary directions of the fluid pressure will be to the backside of the piston 308, causing<br>
the piston 308 to now drive the primary rod 302 down pushing the air back out of the cylinder<br>
to atmosphere through quick exhaust valve 290 and, more importantly, rotating lever 152 in a<br>
clock-wise direction, causing the hand brake 20 to wind up. Additionally, when the load is<br>
fully applied, the fluid pressure will flow to the pilot 214 attached to the activation valve 210<br>
causing the valve 210 to shift into the vented position and cut-off fluid pressure supply 50<br>
from the emergency reservoir. Furthermore, the fluid pressure will flow through the quick<br>
7<br><br><br>
WO 2006/049838	PCT/US2005/036858<br>
exhaust valve 280 to the pilot 242 attached to the change-over valve 242, causing valve 240<br>
to shift and allow fluid pressure supply 50 to flow to the front side of the piston 308 further<br>
aiding its return to the original position.<br>
[0035] Yet additionally, the fluid pressure will be exhausted to atmosphere through choke<br>
282. Once the piston 308 reaches the bottom of its stroke, the trigger 172 will activate<br>
pushbutton 222 attached to the first reciprocating valve 220, closing valve 220. Furthermore,<br>
the return spring 312 is going to drive the piston 308 to its original position pushing the air<br>
back out of the cylinder to atmosphere 284 through quick exhaust valve 290. The trigger 172<br>
engages pushbutton 232, opening valve 230, which is going to cause air to go back in the<br>
cylinder again through first reciprocating valve 220. In the first stages of brake application<br>
when tninimirm force is required, winding of the brake mechanism is accomplished solely<br>
through the reciprocation of the primary rod 302 by repeated applications of pressure within<br>
the operating cylinder 300 through the control valve means and return spring 312 described<br>
above, which enables the gear of the hand brake gear assembly to rotate a sufficient amount<br>
to eliminate the slack within the brake application mechanism.<br>
[0036] As the slack within the brake mechanism is diminished, the force required to urge<br>
rotation of the hand brake gear increases. Ultimately, the force transmitted through the<br>
primary rod 302 is not of sufficient magnitude to overcome the resulting force in the<br>
mechanism. Fluid pressure 50 entering through first fluid communication means 320<br>
accumulates in the cylinder and produces an increasing force on the secondary rod piston<br>
310. As this force increases, the secondary rod 304 becomes active and begins to move<br>
outwardly. At a predetermined point in this extension, secondary rod orifice 318 is restricted<br>
thus preventing fluid pressure from entering the primary cylinder. Exhaust means disposed<br>
within such secondary rod are provided to exhaust fluid pressure outward upon movement of<br>
the secondary drive rod. In the presently preferred embodiment the means include a<br>
longitudinal cavity 322 disposed in the outer surface of the secondary rod 304, such cavity<br>
322 is oriented parallel to the secondary rod axis, producing an exhaust path to vent fluid<br>
residing in the drive rod cavity of the cylinder at a second predetermined point in its travel,<br>
hence allowing further extension of the secondary drive rod 304.<br>
[0037] Alternatively, the exhaust means can also be created using other well-known<br>
means, including a plurality of valves, which do not rely on similar cross sectional variations<br>
of the secondary rod. During its outward movement, the secondary rod 304 leading end<br>
encounters the drive arm 306 attached to the primary rod, and, in cooperation with the<br>
primary rod, urges additional rotation of the brake gear to achieve the desired braking force.<br>

WO 2006/049838	PCT/US2005/036858<br>
Upon achieving such load, the pressure in the line between valve 220 and valve 290 will<br>
increase causing valve 210 to shift and vent to atmosphere, but more importantly, closing the<br>
supply of the fluid pressure 50. At the same time, the predetermined pressure in the pilot 242<br>
will cause valve 240 to shift allowing fluid pressure to flow to the bottom side of the cylinder<br>
300 and cooperate with return springs 312 and 314 to disengage the holding pawl (not<br>
shown) within brake apparatus 20.<br>
[0038] While the presently preferred embodiment and various additional alternative<br>
embodiments for carrying out the instant invention have been set forth in detail in accordance<br>
with the Patent Act, those persons skilled in the hand brake art to which this invention<br>
pertains will recognize various alternative ways of practicing the invention without departing<br>
from the spirit of the invention and scope of the appended claims.<br>
