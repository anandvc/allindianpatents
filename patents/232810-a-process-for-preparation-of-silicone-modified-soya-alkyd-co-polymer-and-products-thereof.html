				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the process for preparation of silicone modified soya alkyd co-polymer and to the products thereof.<br>
In particular this invention relates to a process for preparation of a coating material, and the products thereof, more particularly it relates to process for preparation of silicone soya alkyd copolymer and to the products thereof, which inturn may kind application in exterior paints requiring long life, especially for the superstructure of ships etc.<br>
PRIOR ART OF THE INVENTION<br>
The superstructures of ships are generally exposed to the highly corroding environment, which in-turn may initiate the corrosion preferably oxidation process on the exposed surfaces of the superstructures ships. This process of oxidation once initiated results in the deterioration of the such superstructure.<br>
This deterioration process requires for the application of a coating on the surface of superstructures, which can withstand the corrosive attack of the deteriorating environment, that is, should be capable of giving better corrosion protection performance.<br>
The known such coatings are generally based on soya alkyd composition. In addition to being the corrosion resistant, such coatings are also required to be impermeable<br><br>
to water vapors, if not completely impermeable, at least th&amp; permeability should be minimum. The impermeability to water vapours, enhances the corrosion resistance of the suit-face of the material wherever such coating is applied.<br>
Yet another requirement of such coating materials is that, it should be capable of quick drying. As, otherwise the coating may absorb moisture and effect the surface of the structure wheresoever such coat ing has been applied.<br>
Still another requirement of such coating ma t er i a 1 s , is that, these should have superior mechanical properties. which in-turn can facilitate the coating to with mitand greater mechanical abuses. For such requirements, generally a binder is required to be mixed in the coating composition.<br>
Still further a requirement of such coating	materials<br>
for such applications, as stated herein above, is	that  such<br>
materials  should  have  superior resistance  to	weathering<br>
besides having above stated requirements.<br>
The known such coating materials of known compositions generally, have good adhesion properties but poor exterior durabi1ity.<br>
Further the exterior paints are also exposed to a variety of environmental conditions which may include exposure to ultraviolet radiations in the sunlight. This exposure of paints to the ultraviolet radiations are also responsible for degradation of the polymeric composit ion and eventually the paint coating.<br>
Presently known exterior paints used for application as coating materials on the ships or superstructures are based on linseed oil alkyd and provides the service life merely of about twelve months, particularly in Indian tropical conditions, and hence having the disadvantage of requirement of frequent painting.<br><br>
Alkyds, which are particularly oil modified polyesters, as known in the prior art, have been widely used in the past world over for making paints for exterior app1ication is . The linseed oil based alkyds, as stated herein above as well. were the only choice for formulation of these paint1? in the early years.<br>
The  disadvantages  of known such  linseed	oil  based<br>
alkyds  are that they have inadequate durability	rind  rapid<br>
yellowing   effect   due  to  the  presence   of	excessi ve<br>
unsaturation in the oil.<br>
T o o v e r c o m e these part i c u 1 a r d i s a d v a n t a g e s , s o y a oil based alkyds were developed for formulating the exter ior paints.<br>
The soya oil based alkyds known in the prior art have advantage of producing the non-yellowing coatings and having the improved durability due to reduction of unsaturation.<br>
Continuous research had been	conducted tofurther<br>
improve the weathering property and	other properties as<br>
described herein above, of the soya	oil based alkyds;, by-<br>
modifying them with other resins	having good weather-<br>
resistance .<br>
/<br>
However, the information on their synthesis and characterisation and physico-chemical characteristics' of such soya oil based alkyds is scarce.'<br>
The known methods of preparation of such known soya oil based alkyds are generally based on the soya fatty acid and require arrangements for good agitation and nitrogen purg ing.<br>
The known such processes of synthesis of soya, oil based alkyds are continued generally, till the acid number drops to 7-9 mg of potassium hydroxide per gram of the resin.<br><br>
The main disadvantage of such known processes of synthesis<br>
of soya oil based alkyds is that the main reactant is soya fatty acid and not the soya oil, which in turn makes the process lengthier by one step, which further results in increase in the cost of the process making it uneconomical and time consuming.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to propose an improved process for preparation of silicone modified soya alkyd copolymer and to the products thereof, which in turn have improved weathering characteristics, which further make the producs of the present invention suitable for use as the exterior paints.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to propose an improved process for preparation of silicoie modified soya alkyd copolymer, which comprises reaction of soya oil instead of soya fatty acid, which inturn eliminates one step, hence making the process of the present invention time saving and more economical.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to propose an improved process for preparation of silicone modified soya alkyd copolymer and products thereof having higher tensile strength and percent elongation.<br><br>
Still another object of the present invention is to propose a process for the preparation of silicone modified soya alkyd copolymer and products thereof having improved drying characteristics.<br>
Further an object of the invention is to is to propose a process for the preparation of silicone modified soya alkyd copolymer and products thereof, which in turn possess superior colour and glass retention properties.<br>
Still further an object of this invention is to propose an improved process for obtaining silicone modified soya alkyd copolymer and products thereof having improved resistance to erosion/corrosion.<br>
Yet another an object of this invention is to propose an improved process for the preparation of silicone modified soya alkyd copolymer with low water permeation characteristics.<br>
