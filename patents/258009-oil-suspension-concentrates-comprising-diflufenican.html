Diflufenican-containing oil suspension concentrates<br>
The present invention relates to the field of plant protection formulations. The invention relates in particular to formulations in the form of oil suspension concentrates comprising the herbicidal active substance diflufenican.<br>
Herbicidal active substances are not generally used in their pure form. Depending on the field of use and the type of use, and on physical, chemical and biological parameters, the active substances are used in a mixture with standard auxiliaries and additives as active substance formulation. The combinations with additional active substances for broadening the spectrum of activity and/or for protecting crop plants (e.g., by safeners, antidotes) are also known.<br>
Formulations of herbicidal active substances should generally exhibit high chemical and physical stability, should exhibit good applicability and user friendliness and should exhibit a broad biological action with high selectivity. The herbicidal active substance diflufenican is provided in several types of formulations exhibiting various advantages and disadvantages according to intended purpose and conditions of use. Oil suspension concentrates comprising diflufenican and solvents from the group consisting of the hydrocarbons are known from WO 2005/011378. In practical application, however, it has been shown that these oil suspension concentrates, also known as CD formulations (oil dispersions), exhibit the disadvantage that, on diluting with water, depending on the quality of the water, poorly redispersible precipitates frequently occur, which precipitates lead to blockages of the spray nozzles.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to make available oil suspension concentrates for the active substance diflufenican which do not exhibit the abovementioned disadvantages.<br>
This object is achieved by diflufenican-comprising oil suspension concentrates to which certain salts are added.<br><br>
The present invention accordingly relates to oil suspension concentrates which comprise<br>
a)	diflufenican,<br>
b)	one or more solvents from the group consisting of hydrocarbons and vegetable oils,<br>
c)	one or more nonsurfactant salts of polyvalent cations, the solubility product of these salts in water being higher than that of calcium sulfate,<br>
d)	one or more surfactants,<br>
e)	one or more thickeners.<br>
The dispersions according to the invention show outstanding storage stability and also, on diluting with soft water, do not tend to form poorly redispersible precipitates.<br>
The term "oil suspension concentrate" is understood to mean, within the meaning of the present invention, a suspension concentrate based on the solvents of component b) (hydrocarbons and/or vegetable oils). In this connection, one or more active substances are suspended in the solvents. Additional active substances may be dissolved therein.<br>
The herbicidal active substance diflufenican a) is present in the oil suspension concentrate according to the invention in suspended form. This means that the main part (in % by weight) of diflufenican is present undisclosed in finely divided form and a smaller part of diflufenican may be present dissolved. Preferably, diflufenican is suspended to more than 80% by weight, particularly preferably to more than 90% by weight, in the solvents b), in each case based on the total amount of diflufenican in the oil suspension concentrate according to the invention.<br>
The herbicidal active substance diflufenican present as component a) Is known and commercially available (see, e.g., 'The Pesticide Manual", 12th edition (2000), The British Crop Protection Council, pages 296-297). Diflufenican is generally present in the oil suspension concentrate according to the invention in a proportion of 0.5 to 50% by weight, preferably 2.5 to 50% by weight, the indication "% by weight", here and in the whole of the description, unless other/vise defined, being in this connection based on the relative weight of the respective component based on the<br><br>
total weight of the formulation.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, these oil suspension concentrates comprise<br>
a)	0.5 to 50% of diflufenican,<br>
b)	5 to 80% of one or more solvents,<br>
c)	0.1 to 15% of one or more nonsurfactant salts of polyvalent cations,<br>
d)	1 to 50% of one or more surfactants,<br>
e)	0.1 to 5% of one or more thickeners,<br>
f)	0 to 25% of additional auxiliaries and additives.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, these oil suspension concentrates comprise<br>
a)	2.5 to 50% of diflufenican,<br>
b)	5 to 80% of one or more solvents,<br>
c)	0.1 to 15% of one or more nonsurfactant salts of polyvalent cations,<br>
d)	1 to 50% of one or more surfactants,<br>
e)	0.1 to 5% of one or more thickeners,<br>
f)	0 to 25% of additional auxiliaries and additives,<br>
g)	0 to 50% of one or more additional agrochemical active substances other than a).<br>
In a very particularly preferred embodiment, these oil suspension concentrates comprise<br>
a)	5 to 35% of diflufenican,<br>
b)	5 to 80% of one or more solvents,<br>
c)	0.5 to 15% of one or more nonsurfactant salts of polyvalent cations,<br>
d)	5 to 50% of one or more surfactants,<br>
e)	0.1 to 5% of one or more thickeners,<br>
f)	0 to 25% of additional auxiliaries and additives,<br>
g)	0 to 50% of one or more additional agrochemical active substances other than a).<br>
All % indications are percentages by weight.<br>
The term "polyvalent cations" is to be understood as meaning cations carrying more<br><br>
than one charge. Suitable cations are those of the metals of the second main group and subgroup and those of the third main group of the Periodic Table of the Elements. Particularly suitable are those of the alkaline earth metals, such as magnesium and calcium, in particular calcium.<br>
One or more hydrocarbons or one or more vegetable oils are present as component b) (see, e.g., Rompp Lexikon Chemie [Chemical Dictionary], 10th edition, volume 3, page 2202 (1997), Georg Thieme Vehag, Stuttgart/New York), preferably those which are liquid under standard conditions. The hydrocarbons can be acyclic (aliphatic) hydrocarbons or cyclic hydrocarbons, e.g. aromatic or alicyclic (cycloaliphatic) hydrocarbons.<br>
Examples of hydrocarbons b) are:<br>
1)	aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g.,<br>
■	monoalkyi- or polyalkyl-substituted (e.g., substituted one, two or three times by (Ci-Cio)alkyl groups) aromatic compounds, e.g. benzenes, such as toluene, xylenes, mesitylene, ethylbenzene, or<br>
■	hydrocarbons with condensed aromatic ring systems, such as naphthalenes, e.g. l-methylnaphthalene, 2-methylnaphthalene or dimethylnaphthalene, or other condensed aromatic hydrocarbons, such as indane ortetralin,<br>
2)	cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons, e.g.,<br>

Mixtures of one or more aromatic hydrocarbons and/or of one or more cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons and/or of one or more aliphatic hydrocarbons can also be present as component b). Examples are mixtures of several aliphatic hydrocarbons, e.g. commercially available solvents of the EXXSOL®D series, ISOPAR® series or BAYOL®<br><br>
series, e.g. Bayol'‘82 (EXXONMOBIL CHEMICALS), or of the ISANE’IP series or HYDROSEAL®G series (TOTALFINAELF), or mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, e.g. commercially available solvents of the SOLVESSO® sehes, e.g, Solvesso®100, Solvesso®150 or Solvesso®200 (EXXONMOBIL CHEMICALS), of the SOLVAREX’/SOLVARO® series (TOTALFINAELF) or of the Caromax® series, e.g. Caromax®28 (Petrochem Cahess).<br>
Of the hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons are preferred, in particular saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as  -alkanes, e.g. from the Bayol® series.<br>
Suitable vegetable oils are generally known and commercially available. The term "vegetable oils" is to be understood as meaning, within the meaning of the present invention, e.g., oils from oleaginous plant species, such as soybean oil, rapeseed oil, corn oil, sunflower oil, cottonseed oil, linseed oil, coconut oil, palm oil, thistle oil, walnut oil, peanut oil, olive oil or castor oil, in particular rapeseed oil, the term "vegetable oils" also being understood as meaning the transesterification products thereof, e.g. alkyl esters, such as rapeseed oil methyl ester or rapeseed oil ethyl ester.<br>
Examples of vegetable oils are Cio-C22-fatty acid esters of glycerol or glycol with Cio~C22-fatty acids, or CrC2o-alkyl Cio-C22-fatty acid esters, such as those which can be obtained, e.g., by transesterification of the abovementioned glycerol or glycol Cio-C22-fatty acid esters with CrC2o-alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, propanoi or butanol). The transesterification can be carried out according to known methods, such as those which are described, e.g., in Rompp Chemie Lexikon [Chemical Dictionary], 9th edition, volume 2, page 1343, Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart.<br>
The vegetable oils can be present in the oil suspension concentrates according to the invention, e.g., in the form of commercially available vegetable oils, in particular rapeseed oils, such as rapeseed oil methyl ester, e.g. Phytorob®B (Novance, France), Edenor® MESU and Agnique®ME series (Cognis, Germany), Radia® series (ICI), Prilube® series (Petrofina), or biodiesel or in the form of commercially available formulation additives comprising vegetable oils, in particular those based on rapeseed oils, such as rapeseed oil methyl ester, e.g. Hasten® (Victorian Chemical<br><br>

The oil suspension concentrates according to the invention can be prepared by known processes, e.g. by mixing the components. Thus, e.g., the component b) can be introduced and the additional components a), d), c), e), f) and/or g) can be added Before addition of the other components, the component b) can optionally also be mixed with a thickener. The oil suspension obtained can subsequently, optionally after premilling, be subjected to fine milling.<br>
Standard mixing devices, which are optionally temperature-controlled, can be used for the preparation of the mixtures. High pressure homogenizers or mills operating according to the rotor-stator principle, e.g., can be used for the premilling, such as Ultra-Turrax homogenizers, e.g. from IKA, or toothed colloid mills, e.g. from Puck. Bead mills operating batchwise, e.g. from Drais, or bead mills operating continuously, e.g. from Bachofen, e.g., can be used for the fine milling. The preparation process can be adjusted according to the properties of the components used and also processing and safety requirements and for reasons of costs, and may optionally dispense with premilling or even with fine milling.<br>
The components a) to g) used for the preparation may comprise water as a minor constituent, which water is reencountered in the oil suspension concentrates according to the invention. The oil suspension concentrates according to the invention may accordingly comprise small amounts of water, generally from 0 to 5% by weight.<br><br>
For use, the oil suspension concentrates according to the invention can optionally be diluted in the usual way, e.g. using water, e.g. to give emulsions, suspensions, suspoemulsions or dispersions. It can be advantageous to add, to spray mixtures obtained, additional agrochemical active substances (e.g., tank mix partners in the form of appropriate formulations) and/or auxiliaries and additives standard for application, e.g. self-emulsifying oils, such as vegetable oils or paraffin oils, and/or fertilizers. Accordingly, another subject matter of the present invention is such liquid herbicidal compositions which can be obtained by diluting the oil suspension concentrates according to the invention.<br>
The herbicidal compositions according to the invention (subsequently always also comprising the oil suspension concentrates according to the invention) exhibit an outstanding herbicidal activity against a broad spectrum of economically important harmful monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants. Even perennial weeds which sprout from rhizomes, root stocks or other perennial organs and which are difficult to combat are successfully included. In this connection, the compositions can be applied, e.g., in the presowing, preemergence or postemergence method. Specifically, mention may be made, by way of example, of some representatives of the mono- and dicotyledonous weed flora which can be controlled by the herbicidal compositions according to the invention, without the designation resulting in a limitation to certain species.<br>
In the case of the monocotyledonous weed species, Apera spica venti, Avena spp., Alopecurus spp., Brachiaria spp., Digitaria spp., Lolium spp., Echinochloa spp., Panicum spp., Phalahs spp., Poa spp., Setaria spp. and also Bromus spp., such as Bromus catharticus, Bromus secalinus, Bromus erectus, Bromus tectorum and Bromus japonicus, and Cyperus species from the group of the annuals and, in the case of the perennial species, Agropyron, Cynodon, Imperata and also Sorghum and even perennial Cyperus species, e.g., are successfully included.<br>
With dicotyledonous weed species, the spectrum of activity applies to species such as, e.g., Abutilon spp., Amaranthus spp., Chenopodium spp.. Chrysanthemum spp., Galium spp., such as Galium aparine, Ipomoea spp., Kochia spp., Lamium spp., Matricaria spp., Pharbitis spp.. Polygonum spp., Sida spp., Sinapis spp., Solanum<br><br>
spp,, Stellaria spp., Veronica spp. and Viola spp., Xanthium spp., in the case of the annuals, and Convolvulus, Cirsium, Rumex and Artemisia with the perennial weeds.<br>
Harmful plants occurring under the specific cultivation conditions in rice, such as, e.g,, Echinochloa, Sagittaria, Alisma, Eleocharis, Scirpus and Cyperus, are likewise combated in an outstanding fashion by the compositions according to the invention.<br>
If the herbicidal compositions according to the invention are applied to the soil surface before germination, then either the emergence of the weed seedlings is completely prevented or the weeds grow until they have reached the cotyledon stage but then their growth ceases and finally, after 3 to 4 weeks have elapsed, they completely die.<br>
On application of the herbicidal compositions according to the invention to the green parts of the plants in the postemergence method, a drastic halt in growth likewise occurs very quickly after the treatment and the weed plants stay in the growth stage present at the time of application or completely die after a certain time, so that in this way competition by weeds, which is harmful for the crop plants, is eliminated very early and with lasting effect.<br>
The herbicidal compositions according to the invention are distinguished by a rapidly commencing and longlasting herbicidal action. The resistance to rain of the active substances in the herbicidal compositions according to the invention is generally good. A particular advantage is crucially that the dosages of herbicidal compounds which are used in the herbicidal compositions and which are effective can be adjusted to such a low value that their soil action is optimally low. Accordingly, not only is their use finally possible in sensitive crops but groundwater contamination is virtually avoided. A substantial reduction in the amount of the active substances which has to be expended is made possible by the active substance combination according to the invention.<br>
The properties and advantages mentioned are of use in the practical combating of weeds in order to keep agricultural crops free from undesirable competing plants and accordingly to safeguard and/or to increase the yields in terms of quality and<br><br>
quantity. The technical standard is, with regard to the properties described, clearly exceeded by these new compositions.<br>
Although the herbicidai compositions according to the invention exhibit an outstanding herbicidai activity with regard to mono- and dicotyledonous weeds, crop plants of economically important crops, e.g. dicotyledonous crops, such as soya, cotton, rape, sugar beet, or gramineous crops, such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, millet, rice or corn, are only insignificantly damaged or completely undamaged. The present compounds, for these reasons, are very well suited to the selective combating of undesirable plant growth in agriculturally useful plants or in ornamental plants.<br>
In addition, the herbicidai compositions according to the invention exhibit outstanding growth-regulatory properties in crop plants. They intervene in a regulatory manner in the plants' metabolism and can accordingly be used for the selective influencing of plant contents and for making it easier to harvest, such as, e.g., by controlling desiccation and stunted growth. Furthermore, they are also suitable for the general control and inhibition of undesirable vegetative growth, without in this connection killing the plants. Inhibition of vegetative growth plays a major role in many mono-and dicotyledonous crops since lodging can be reduced or completely prevented through this.<br>
Because of their herbicidai and plant-growth-regulatory properties, the herbicidai compositions according to the invention can also be used for combating harmful plants in crops of known genetically modified plants or genetically modified plants still to be developed. The transgenic plants are generally distinguished by particular advantageous properties, for example by resistance to certain pesticides, mainly certain herbicides, resistance to plant diseases or causative agents of plant diseases, such as certain insects or microorganisms, such as fungi, bacteria or viruses. Other particular properties relate, e.g., to the harvested crops with regard to amount, quality, storability, composition and special ingredients. Thus, transgenic plants with increased starch content or modified quality of the starch or those with a different fatty acid composition of the harvested crops are known.<br><br>
Preference is given to the use of the compositions according to the invention in economically important transgenic crops of useful and ornamental plants, e.g. of gramineous crops, such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, millet, rice and corn, or also crops of sugar beet, cotton, soya, rape, potato, tomato, peas and other kinds of vegetable. Preferably, the compositions according to the invention can be used as herbicides in crops of useful plants which are resistant to the phytotoxic effects of the herbicides or which have been made resistant by genetic engineering.<br>
When the herbicidal compositions according to the invention are used in transgenic crops, effects often occur, in addition to the effects with regard to harmful plants to be observed in other crops, which are specific for the application in the respective transgenic crop, for example a modified or specially broadened weed spectrum which can be combated, modified amounts to be expended which can be used for the application, preferably good ability to be combined with the herbicides to which the transgenic crop is resistant, and influencing of growth and yield of the transgenic crop plants.<br>
Another subject matter of the present invention is furthermore a process for the combating of undesirable plant growth (e.g., harmful plants, such as monocotyledonous or dicotyledonous weeds or undesirable crop plants), preferably in plant crops such as cereals (e.g., wheat, barley, rye, oats, rice, corn, millet), sugar beet, sugar cane, rape, cotton and soya, particularly preferably in monocotyledonous crops, such as cereals, e.g. wheat, barley, rye, oats, hybrids thereof, such as triticale, hce, corn and millet, one or more herbicidal compositions according to the invention being applied to the plants (e.g., harmful plants), plant parts, the seed (e.g., plant seeds) or the area on which the plants are growing (e.g., the area under cultivation).<br>
The plant crops can also be modified by genetic engineering or obtained by mutation selection and are preferably tolerant to acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors.<br>
The oil suspension concentrates of the present invention exhibit an outstanding chemical stability during preparation and storage and are in particular also suitable for combinations of active substances with different physicochemical properties. In<br><br>
addition, the oil suspension concentrates exhibit outstanding physical stability, good applicability and user friendliness, and high biological effectiveness and selectivity.<br>
