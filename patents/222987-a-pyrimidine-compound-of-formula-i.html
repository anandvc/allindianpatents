The latter can conveniently be obtained by treating the base form with such appropriate acids as inorganic acids, for example, hydrohalic acids, e.g. hydrochloric, hydrobromic and the like; sulfuric acid; nitric acid; phosphoric acid and the like; or organic acids, for example, acetic, propanoic, hydroxy-acetic, 2-hydroxypropanoic, 2-oxopropanoic, oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumanc, malic, tartanc, 2-hydroxy-l,2,3-propanetricarboxylic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, 4-methylbenzenesulfonic, cyclohexanesulfamic, 2-hydroxybenzoic, 4-ammo-2-hydroxybenzoic and the like acids. Conversely the salt form can be converted by treatment with alkali into the free base form.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) containing acidic protons may be converted into their therapeutically active non-toxic metal or amine addition salt forms by treatment with appropriate organic and inorganic bases. Appropriate base salt forms comprise, for example, the ammonium salts, the alkali and earth alkaline metal salts, e.g. the lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium salts and the like, salts with organic bases, e.g. primary, secondary and tertiary aliphatic and aromatic amines such as methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, isopropylamine, the four butylamine isomers, dimethylamine, diethylamme, diethanolamine, dipropylamine, diisopropylamine, di-n-butylamine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, morpholine, trimethylamine, tnethylamine, tripropylamine.<br>
qumuclidine, pyridine, quinoline and isoquinoline, the benzathine, jV-methyl-D-glucamine, 2-arrjino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-l,3-propanediol, hydrabamine salts, and salts with amino acids such as, for example, arginine, lysine and the like. Conversely the salt form can be converted by treatment with acid into the free acid form.<br>
The term addition salt also comprises the hydrates and solvent addition forms which the compounds of formula (I) are able to form. Examples of such forms are e.g. hydrates, alcoholates and the like.<br>
The term "quaternary amine" as used hereinbefore defines the quaternary ammonium salts which the compounds of formula (I) are able to form by reaction between a basic nitrogen of a compound of formula (I) and an appropriate quaternizing agent, such as, for example, an optionally substituted alkylhalide, arylhalide or arylalkylhalide, e.g. methyliodide or benzyliodide. Other reactants with good leaving groups may also be used, such as alkyl tnfluoromethanesulfonates, alkyl methanesulfonates, and alkyl p-toluenesulfonates. A quaternary amine has a positively charged nitrogen. Pharmaceutical!} acceptable counterions include chloro, bromo, iodo, trifluoroacetate and acetate. The eountenon of choice can be introduced using ion exchange resins.<br>
The TV-oxide forms of the present compounds are meant to comprise the compounds of formula (I) wherein one or several tertiary nitrogen atoms are oxidized to the so-called<br>
vV-oxide.<br>
It will be appreciated that some of the compounds of formula (I) and their jV-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines and stereochemically isomeric forms may contain one or more centers of chirality and exist as stereochemically isomeric forms.<br>
The term "stereochemically isomeric forms" as used.hereinbefore defines all the possible stereoisomeric forms which the compounds of formula (T), and their N-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines or physiologically functional derivatives may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of compounds denotes the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms, said mixtures containing all dlastereomers and enantiomers of the basic molecular structure as well as each of the individual isomeric forms of formula (I) and their ./V-oxides, salts, solvates or quaternary amines substantially free, i.e. associated with less than 10%, preferably less than 5%. in particular less than 2% and most preferably less than 1% of the other<br>
isomers. Thus, when a compound of formula (I) is for instance specified as (E), this<br>
means that the compound is substantially free of the (Z) isomer.<br>
In particular, stereogenic centers may have the R- or S-configuration; substituents on<br>
bivalent cyclic (partially) saturated radicals may have either the cis- or trans-<br>
configuration. Compounds encompassing double bonds can have an E (entgegen) or Z<br>
(zusammen) -stereochemistry at said double bond. The terms cis, trans, R, S, E and Z<br>
are well known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
Stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) are obviously<br>
intended to be embraced within the scope of this invention.<br>
For some of the compounds of formula (I), their prodrugs, ./V-oxides, salts, solvates,<br>
quaternary amines or metal complexes and the intermediates used in the preparation<br>
thereof, the absolute stereochemical configuration was not experimentally determined.<br>
In these cases the stereoisomeric form which was first isolated is designated as "A" and<br>
*<br>
the second as "B", without further reference to the actual stereochemical configuration. However, said "A" and "B" stereoisomeric forms can be unambiguously characterized by for instance their optical rotation in case "A" and "B" have an enantiomeric relationship. A person skilled in the art is able to determine the absolute configuration of such compounds using art-known methods such as, for example, X-ray diffraction. In case "A" and "B" are stereoisomeric mixtures, they can be further separated whereby the respective first fractions isolated are designated "Al" and "Bl" and the second as "A2" and "B2", without further reference to the actual stereochemical configuration.<br>
Some of the compounds of formula (I) may also exist in their tautomenc form. Such forms although not explicitly indicated in the above formula are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Whenever used hereinafter, the term "compounds of formula (I)" is meant to also include their TV-oxide forms, their salts, their quaternary amines and their Stereochemically isomeric forms. Of special interest are those compounds of formula (I) which are Stereochemically pure.<br>
Whenever used hereinbefore or hereinafter that substituents can be selected each independently out of a list of numerous definitions, such as for example for R9 and R10, all possible combinations are intended which are chemically possible and which lead to chemically stable molecules.<br>

Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the processes described above the functional groups of intermediate compounds may need to be blocked by protecting groups.<br>
Functional groups which it is desirable to protect include hydroxy, amino and carboxylic acid. Suitable protecting groups for hydroxy include trialkylsilyl groups (e.g. re7t-butyldimethylsilyl, te/t-butyldiphenylsilyl or trimethylsilyl), benzyl and tetrahydro-pyranyl. Suitable protecting groups for amino include tert-butyloxycarbonyl or benzyloxycarbonyl. Suitable protecting groups for carboxylic acid include Chalky! or benzyl esters.<br>
The protection and deprotection of functional groups may take place before or after a reaction step.<br>
The use of protecting groups is fully described in 'Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry1, edited by J W F McOmie, Plenum Press (1973), and 'Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis' 2nd edition, T W Greene &amp; P G M Wutz, Wiley Interscience (1991).<br>

Preferred compounds of formula (ffi-b) are those compounds wherein Xj represents NH. More preferred compounds of formula (ITJ-b) are those compounds wherein Xi<br>
represents NH and Ca-ealkenyl represents CH=CH. Most preferred compounds of formula (TET-b) are the compounds of formula (HI-b-1) as described hereinabove.<br>
The compounds of formula (T), (T), a"), (I'"), (VH), (XXVH), (XXDC) and (XXXVIQ show antiretroviral properties (reverse.transcriptase inhibiting properties), in particular against Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which is the aetiological agent of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in humans. The HTV virus preferentially infects human T-4 cells and destroys them or changes their normal function, particularly the coordination of the immune system. As a result, an infected patient has an ever decreasing number of T-4 cells, which moreover behave abnormally. Hence, the immunological defense system is unable to combat infections and neoplasms and the HTV infected subject usually dies by opportunistic infections such as pneumonia, or by cancers. Other conditions associated with HTV infection include thrombocytopaenia, Kaposi's sarcoma and infection of the central nervous system characterized by progressive demyelination, resulting in dementia and symptoms such as, progressive dysarthria, ataxia and disorientation. HIV infection further has also been associated with peripheral neuropathy, progressive generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) and AIDS-related complex (ARC).<br>
The present compounds also show activity against (multi) drug resistant HTV strains, in particular (multi) drug resistant HTV-1 strains, more in particular the present compounds show activity against HIV strains, especially HTV-1 strains, that have acquired resistance to one or more art-known non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Art-known non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors are those non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors other than the present compounds and in particular commercial non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. The present compounds also have little or no binding affinity to human a-1 acid glycoprotein; human a-1 acid glycoprotein does not or only weakly affect the anti HTV activity of the present compounds.<br>
Due to their antiretroviral properties, particularly their anti-HTV properties, especially their anti-HIV-1-activity, the compounds of formula (I), their N-oxides, pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts, quaternary amines and stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, are useful in the treatment of individuals infected by HTV and for the prophylaxis of these infections. In general, the compounds of the present invention may be useful in the treatment of warm-blooded animals infected with viruses whose existence is mediated by, or depends upon, the enzyme reverse<br>
transcnptase. Conditions which may be prevented or treated with the compounds of the present invention, especially conditions associated with HTV and other pathogenic retro viruses, include AIDS, AIDS-related complex (ARC), progressive generalized iymphadenopathy (PGL), as well as chronic Central Nervous System diseases caused by retroviruses, such as, for example HTV mediated dementia and multiple sclerosis.<br>
The compounds of the present invention or any subgroup thereof may therefore be used as medicines against above-mentioned conditions. Said use as a medicine or method of treatment comprises the administration to HTV-infected subjects of an amount effective to combat the conditions associated with HIV and other pathogenic retroviruses, especially HTV-1. In particular, the compounds of formula (T) may be used in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or the prevention of HIV infections.<br>
In view of the utility of the compounds of formula (I), there is provided a method of treating warm-blooded animals, including humans, suffering from or a method of preventing warm-blooded animals, including humans, to suffer from viral infections, especially HIV infections. Said method comprises the administration, preferably oral administration, of an effective amount of a compound of formula (I), a N-oxide form, a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt, a quaternary amine or a possible stereoisomenc form thereof, to warm-blooded animals, including humans.<br>
The present invention also provides compositions for treating viral infections comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.<br>
The compounds of the present invention or any subgroup thereof may be formulated •into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. As appropriate compositions there may be cited all compositions usually employed for systemically administering drugs. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, optionally in addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirable in unitary dosage form suitable, particularly, for administration orally, rectally, percutaneously, or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of<br>
oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, diluents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the Like in the case of powders, pills, capsules, and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Ihjectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not introduce a significant deleterious effect on the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on, as an ointment. The compounds of the present invention may also be administered via inhalation or insufflation by means of methods and formulations employed in the art for administration via this way. Thus, in general the compounds of the present invention ' may be administered to the lungs in the form of a solution, a suspension or a dry powder. Any system developed for the delivery of solutions, suspensions or dry powders via oral or nasal inhalation or insufflation are suitable for the administration of the present compounds.<br>
To aid solubility of the compounds of formula (I), suitable ingredients, e.g. cyclodextrins, may be included in the compositions. Appropriate cyclodextrins are a-, P-, y-cyclodextrins or ethers and mixed ethers thereof wherein one or more of the<br>
hydroxy groups of the anhydroglucose units of the cyclodextrin are substituted with C\ .galkyl, particularly methyl, ethyl or isopropyl, e.g. randomly methylated (3-CD; hydroxyCi_6alky1, particularly hydroxyethyl, hydroxy-propyl or hydroxybutyl; carboxyC]_galkyl, particularly carboxymethyl or carboxy-ethyl; Ci-6alkylcarbonyl, particularly acetyl   Especially noteworthy as complexants and/or solubilizers are (3-CD, randomly methylated p-CD, 2,6-dimethyl-p-CD, 2-hydroxyethyl-(3-CD!<br><br>
2-hydroxyethyl-pVCD, 2-hydroxypropyl-p-CD and (2-carboxymethoxy)propyl-(3-CD, and in particular 2-hydroxypropyl-(3-CD (2-HP-J3-CD).<br>
The term mixed ether denotes cyclodextrin derivatives wherein at least two cyclodextrin hydroxy groups are etherified with different groups such as, for example, hydroxy-propyl and hydroxyethyl.<br>
The average molar substitution (M.S.) is used as a measure of the average number of moles of alkoxy units per mole of anhydroglucose. The average substitution degree (D.S.) refers to the average number of substituted hydroxyls per anhydroglucose unit. The M.S. and D.S. value can be determined by various analytical techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry (MS) and infrared spectroscopy (IR). Depending on the technique used, slightly different values may be obtained for one given cyclodextrin derivative. Preferably, as measured by mass spectrometry, the M.S. ranges from 0.125 to 10 and the D.S. ranges from 0.125 to 3.<br>
Other suitable compositions for oral or rectal administration comprise particles consisting of a solid dispersion comprising a compound of formula (I) and one or more appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable water-soluble polymers.<br>
The term "a solid dispersion" used hereinafter defines a system in a solid state (as opposed to a liquid or gaseous state) comprising at least two components, in casu the compound of formula (I) and the water-soluble polymer, wherein one component is dispersed more or less evenly throughout the other component or components (in case additional pharmaceutically acceptable formulating agents, generally known in the art, are included, such as plasticizers, preservatives and the like). When said dispersion of the components is such that the system is chemically and physically uniform or homogenous throughout or consists of one phase as defined in thermo-dynamics, such a solid dispersion will be called "a solid solution". Solid solutions are preferred physical systems because the components therein are usually readily bioavailable to the organisms to which they are administered. This advantage can probably be explained by the ease with which said solid solutions can form liquid solutions when contacted with a liquid medium such as the gastro-intestinal juices. The ease of dissolution may be attributed at least in part to the fact that the energy required for dissolution of the components from a solid solution is less than that required for the dissolution of components from a crystalline or microcrystalline solid phase.<br>
The term "a solid dispersion" also comprises dispersions which are less homogenous throughout than solid solutions. Such dispersions are not chemically and physically uniform throughout or comprise more than one phase. For example, the term "a solid dispersion" also relates to a system having domains or small regions wherein amorphous, microcrystalline or crystalline compound of formula (I), or amorphous, microcrystalline or crystalline water-soluble polymer, or both, are dispersed more or less evenly in another phase comprising water-soluble polymer, or compound of formula (I), or a solid solution comprising compound of formula (I) and water-soluble polymer. Said domains are regions within the solid dispersion distinctively marked by some physical feature, small in size, and evenly and randomly distributed throughout the solid dispersion.<br>
Various techniques exist for preparing solid dispersions including melt-extrusion, spray-drying and solution-evaporation.<br>
The solution-evaporation process comprises the following steps :<br>
a)	dissolving the compound of formula (I) and thfe water-soluble polymer in an<br>
appropriate solvent, optionally at elevated temperatures;<br>
b)	heating the solution resulting under point a), optionally under vacuum, until the<br>
solvent is evaporated. The solution may also be poured onto a large surface so as to<br>
form a thin film, and evaporating the solvent therefrom.<br>
In the spray-drying technique, the two components are also dissolved in an appropriate solvent and the resulting solution is then sprayed through the nozzle of a spray dryer followed by evaporating the solvent from the resulting droplets at elevated temperatures.<br>
The preferred technique for preparing solid dispersions is the melt-extrusion process comprising the following steps :<br>
a)	mixing a compound of formula (I) and an appropriate water-soluble polymer,<br>
b)	optionally blending additives with the thus obtained mixture,<br>
c)	heating and compounding the thus obtained blend until one obtains a<br>
homogenous melt,<br>
d)	forcing the thus obtained melt through one or more nozzles; and<br>
e t cooling the melt till it solidifies.<br>
The terms "melt" and "melting" should be interpreted broadly. These terms not only mean the alteration from a solid state to a liquid state, but can also refer to a transition to a glassy state or a rubbery state, and in which it is possible for one component of the mixture to get embedded more or less homogeneously into the other. In particular cases, one component will melt and the .other component(s) will dissolve in the melt thus forming a solution, which upon cooling may form a solid solution having advantageous dissolution properties.<br>
After preparing the solid dispersions as described hereinabove, the obtained products can be optionally milled and sieved.<br>
The solid dispersion product may be milled or ground to particles having a particle size of less than 600 UJDQ, preferably less than 400 jxm and most preferably less than 125<br>
The particles prepared as described hereinabove can then be formulated by conventional techniques into pharmaceutical dosage forms such as tablets and capsules.<br>
It will be appreciated that a person of skill in the art will be able to optimize the parameters of the solid dispersion preparation techniques described above, such as the most appropriate solvent, the working temperature, the kind of apparatus being used, the rate of spray-drying, the throughput rate in the melt-extruder<br>
The water-soluble polymers in the particles are polymers that have an apparent viscosity, when dissolved at 20°C in an aqueous solution at 2 % (w/v), of 1 to 5000 mPa.s more preferably of 1 to 700 mPa.s, and most preferred of 1 to 100 mPa.s. For example, suitable water-soluble polymers include aUcylcelluloses, hydroxyalkyl-celluloses, hydroxyalkyl alkylcelluloses, carboxyalkylcelluloses, alkali metal salts of carboxyalkylcelluloses, carboxyalkylalkylcelluloses, carboxyalkylcellulose esters, starches, pectines, chitrn derivates, di-, oligo- and polysaccharides such as trehalose, alginic acid or alkali metal and ammonium salts thereof, carrageenans, galactomannans, tragacanth, agar-agar, gummi arabicum, guar gummi and xanthan gumrni, polyacrylic acids and the salts thereof, polymethacrylic acids and the salts thereof, methacrylate copolymers, polyvinylalcohol, polyvinylpyrroh'done, copolymers of polyvinylpyrrolidone with vinyl acetate, combinations of polyvinylalcohol and polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyalkylene oxides and copolymers of ethylene oxide and propyiene oxide. Preferred water-soluble polymers are hydroxypropyl methvlcelluloses.<br>
Also one or more cyclodextrins can be used as water soluble polymer in the preparation of the above-mentioned particles as is disclosed in WO 97/18839. Said cyclodextrins include the phannaceutically acceptable unsubstituted and substituted cyclodextrins known in the art, more particularly a, (3 or y cyclodextrins or the pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof.<br>
Substituted cyclodextrins which can be used to prepare the above described particles include polyethers described in U.S. Patent 3,459,731. Further substituted cyclodextrins are ethers wherein the hydrogen of one or more cyclodextrin hydroxy groups is replaced by Ci-6alkyl, hydroxyCi_6alkyl, carboxy-Ci-galkyl or Ci_6alkyloxycarbonylCi-6alkyl or mixed ethers thereof. In particular such substituted<br>
cyclodextrins are ethers wherein the hydrogen of one or more cyclodextrin hydroxy groups is replaced by Ci-3alkyl, hydroxyC2-4aIkyl or carboxyCi_2alkyl or more in<br>
particular by methyl, ethyl, hydroxyethyl, hydroxypropyl, hydroxybutyl, carboxy-methyl or carboxyethyl.<br>
Of particular utility are the p-cyclodextrin ethers, e.g. dimethyl-p-cyclodextrin as described in Drugs of the Future, Vol. 9, No. 8, p. 577-578 by M. Nogradi (1984) and polyethers, e.g. hydroxypropyl (3-cyclodextrin and hydroxyethyl (3-cyclodextrin, being examples. Such an alkyl ether may be a methyl ether with a degree of substitution of about 0.125 to 3, e.g. about 0.3 to 2. Such a hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin may for example be formed from the reaction between p-cyclodextrin an propylene oxide and may have a MS value of about 0.125 to 10, e'.gT aboutO.JtcT3.<br>
Another type of substituted cyclodextrins is sulfobutylcyclodextrines.<br>
The ratio of the compound of formula (I) over the water soluble polymer may vary widely. For example ratios of 1/100 to 100/1 may be applied. Interesting ratios of the compound of formula (I) over cyclodextrin range from about 1/10 to 10/1. More interesting ratios range from about 1/5 to 5/1.<br>
It may further be convenient to formulate the compounds of formula (I) in the form of nanoparticles which have a surface modifier adsorbed on the surface thereof in an amount sufficient to maintain an effective average particle size of less than 1000 run. Useful surface modifiers are believed to include those which physically adhere to the surface of the compound of formula (I) but do not chemically bond to. said compound.<br>
Suitable surface modifiers can preferably be selected from known organic and inorganic pharmaceutical excipients. Such excipients include various polymers, low molecular weight oligorners, natural products and surfactants. Preferred surface modifiers include nonionic and anionic surfactants.<br>
Yet another interesting way of formulating the compounds of formula (I) involves a pharmaceutical composition whereby the compounds of formula (I) are incorporated in hydrophilic polymers and applying this mixture as a coat film over many small beads, thus yielding a composition which can conveniently be manufactured and which is suitable for preparing pharmaceutical dosage forms for oral administration.<br>
Said beads comprise a central, rounded or spherical core, a coating film of a hydrophilic polymer and a compound of formula (I) and optionally a seal-coating layer.<br>
Materials suitable for use as cores in the beads are manifold, provided that said materials are pharmaceutically acceptable and have appropriate dimensions and firmness. Examples of such materials are polymers, inorganic substances, organic substances, and saccharides and derivatives thereof.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Unit dosage form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such unit dosage forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, suppositories, injectable solutions or suspensions and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.<br>
Those of skill in the treatment of HTV-infection could determine the effective daily amount from the test results presented here. In general it is contemplated that an effective daily amount would be from 0.01 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg body weight, more weferably from 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg body weight. It may be appropriate to idmimster the required dose as two, three, four or more sub-doses at appropriate ntervals throughout the day. Said sub-doses may be formulated as unit dosage forms, or example, containing 1 to 1000 mg, and in particular 5 to 200 mg of active ingredient er unit dosage form.<br>
The exact dosage and frequency of administration depends on the particular compound of formula (I) used, the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated, the age, weight and general physical condition of the particular patient as well as other medication the individual may be taking, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, it is evident that said effective daily amount may be lowered or increased depending on the response of the treated subject and/or depending on the evaluation of the physician prescribing the compounds of the instant invention. The effective daily amount ranges mentioned hereinabove are therefore only guidelines and are not intended to limit the scope or use of the invention to any extent.<br>
The present compounds of formula (I) can be used alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents, such as anti-virals, antibiotics, immunomodulators or vaccines for the treatment of viral infections. They may also be used alone or in combination with other prophylactic agents for the prevention of viral infections. The present compounds may be used in vaccines and methods for protecting individuals against viral infections over an extended period of time. The compounds may be employed in such vaccines either alone or together with other compounds of this invention or together with other anti-viral agents in a manner consistent with the conventional utilization of reverse transcriptase inhibitors in vaccines. Thus, the present compounds may be combined with pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants conventionally employed in vaccines and administered in prophylactically effective amounts to protect individuals over an extended period of time against HTV infection.<br>
Also, the combination of an antiretroviral compound and a compound of fonnula (I) can be used as a medicine. Thus, the present invention also relates to a product containing (a) a compound of formula (I), and (b) another antiretroviral compound, as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in anti-HIV treatment. The different drugs may be combined in a single preparation together with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Said other antiretroviral compounds may be known antiretroviral compounds such as suramine, pentamidine, thymopentin, castanospermine, dextran (dextran sulfate), foscarnet-sodium (trisodium phosphono formate); nucleoside reverse transcnptase inhibitors, e.g. zidovudine (3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine, AZT), didanosine (2',3'-dideoxyinosine; ddl), zalcitabine (dideoxycytidine, ddC) or lamivudine (2'-3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidme, 3TC), stavudine (2',3'-didehydro-3'-deoxythymidine, d4T), abacavir and the like; non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as nevirapine (ll-cyclopropyl-5,ll-dihydro-4-methyl-6fi'-dipyrido-<br>
 [3,2-b : 2',3'-e][L4]diazepin-6-one), efavirenz, delavirdine, TMC-120, TMC-125 and the like; phosphonate reverse transcriptase inhibitors, e.g. tenofovir and the like; compounds of the TH3O (tetrahydro-imidazo[4,5,l-jk][l,4]-ben2;odiazepine-2(lfi)-one and thione)-type e.g. (S)-8-ch]oro-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-5-methyl-6-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)-tmidazo-[4,5,l-jk]ri,4]benzodiazepme-2(lfl)-thione; compounds of the a-APA (a-anilino phenyl acetamide) type e.g. a-[(2-nitrophenyl)amino]-2,6-di-chlorobenzene-acetamide and the like; inhibitors of trans-activating proteins, such as TAT-inhibitors, e.g. RO-5-3335, or REV inhibitors, and the like; protease inhibitors e.g. indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, lopinavir (ABT-378), nelfinavir, amprenavir, TMC-126, BMS -232632, VX-175 and the Kke; fusion inhibitors, e.g. T-20, T-1249 and the like; CXCR4 receptor antagonists, e.g. AMD-3100 and the like; inhibitors of the viral integrase; nucleoti de-like reverse transcriptase inhibitors, e.g. tenofovir and the like; ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors, e.g. hydroxyurea and the like.<br>
By administering the compounds of the present invention with other anti-viral agents which target different events in the viral life cycle, the therapeutic effect of these compounds can be potentiated. Combination therapies as described above exert a synergistic effect in inhibiting HIV replication because each component of the combination acts on a different site of HTV replication. The use of such combinations may reduce the dosage of a given conventional anti-retroviral agent which would be required for a desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect as compared to when that agent is administered as a monotherapy. These combinations may reduce or eliminate the side effects of conventional single anti-retroviral therapy while not interfering with the anti-viral activity of the agents. These combinations reduce potential of resistance to single agent therapies, while minimizing any associated toxicity. These combinations may also increase the efficacy of the conventional agent without increasing the associated toxicity.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also be administered in combination with immunomodulating agents, e.g. levamisole, bropirimine, anti-human alpha interferon antibody, interferon alpha, interleukin 2, methionine enkephalin, diethyldithiocarbamate, tumor necrosis factor, naltrexone and the like; antibiotics, e.g. pentamidine isethiorate and the like; cholinergic agents, e.g. tacrine, rivastigmine, ionepezil, galantamine and the Eke; NMDA channel blockers, e.g. memantine to arevent or combat infection and diseases or symptoms of diseases associated with HTV nfections, such as AIDS and ARC, e.g. dementia. A compound of formula (I) can also )e combined with another compound of formula (I).<br><br>
Although the present invention focuses on the use of the present compounds for preventing or treating HDTV infections, the present compounds may also be used as inhibitory agents for other viruses which depend on similar reverse transcriptases for obligatory events in their life cycle.<br>

C. Pharmacological examglg<br>
The pharmacological activity of the present compounds was examined using the<br>
following test.<br>
A rapid, sensitive and automated assay procedure was used for the in vitro evaluation of anti-HTV agents. An HTV-1 transformed T4-cell line, MT-4, which was previously shown (Koyanagi et al., Int. J. Cancer, 36, 445-451, 1985) to be highly susceptible to and permissive for HTV infection, served as the target cell line. Inhibition of the HTV-induced cytopathic effect was used as the end point. The viability of both HTV- and mock-infected cells was assessed spectrophotometrically via the in situ reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliurn bromide (MTT). The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC5Q in M)'was defined as the concentration of compound<br>
that reduced the absorbance of the mock-infected control sample by 50%. The percent protection achieved by the compound in HTV-infected cells was calculated by the following formula :<br>
whereby (OD^grv is the optical density measured with a given concentration of the test compound in HTV-infected cells; (ODc)Hiv is the optical density measured for the control untreated HTV-infected cells; (ODc)MOCKis tne optical density measured for the control untreated mock-infected cells; all optical density values were determined at 540 nm. The dose achieving 50% protection according to the above formula was defined as the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC5Q in M). The ratio of CC5Q to IC50<br>
was defined as the selectivity index (SI).<br>
Table 6 lists the pICso (-loglCso), PCC50 (-logCC5o) and pSI (pCC50-pIC50) values for the compounds of formula (I). For example, a compound with a 1050 value of 10"9M, i.e. pIC5o=9, and a CC5Q value of 10"5 M, i.e. pCC5o= 5 , has a SI of<br>
10~5 M/10'9M = 10.000, i.e. a pSI of 5-9 = -4. Table 6<br>
