Polyethylene moulding compound with an improved ESCR/stiffness relation and an improved swelling rate, a method for the production thereof and the use thereof<br>
The present invention relates to a polyethylene moulding compound having a multi¬modal molecular weight distribution and to a method for the production of this ^moulding compound in the presence of a catalytic system comprising a Ziegler catalyst and co-catalyst via a multistep reaction sequence consisting of successive liquid-phase polymerizations, and to hollow articles produced from the moulding compound by extrusion blow moulding.<br>
Polyethylene is widely used for the production of mouldings and containers since it is a material having a low inherent weight which nevertheless has particularly high mechanical strength, high corrosion resistance to moisture and water in combination with atmospheric oxygen and absolutely reliable long-term resistance and since polyethylene has good chemical resistance and in particular can easily be processed for bottles, canisters and fuel tanks in motor vehicles.<br>
EP-A-603,935 has already described a moulding compound based on polyethylene which has a bimodal molecular weight distribution and which is also suitable, inter alia, for the production of pipes.<br>
A raw matehal having an even broader molecular weight disthbution is described in US Patent 5,338,589 and is prepared using a highly active catalyst disclosed in WO 91/18934 in which magnesium alkoxide is employed in the form of a gelatinous suspension. Surprisingly, it has been found that the use of this material in mouldings, in particular in pipes, facilitates a simultaneous improvement in the properties of stiffness and creep tendency, which are usually contradictory in partially crystalline thermoplastics, on the one hand, and stress cracking resistance and toughness on the other hand.<br><br>
The known bimodal products are distinguished, in particular, by good processing properties at the same time as an outstanding stress cracking/stiffness ratio. This combination of properties is of particular importance in the production of hollow articles from plastics, such as bottles, canisters and fuel tanl<s in motor vehicles. addition to this property combination however the production of plastic hollow articles requires highest possible swelling rate melt since is directly responsible for enabling optimum setting wall thickness control formation weld line and weldability industrial extrusion blow moulding.></s>
It is known that plastics having high swelling rates can be produced well using so-called Phillips catalysts, i.e. polymerization catalysts based on chromium com¬pounds. However, the plastics produced in this way have an unfavourable stress cracking/stiffness ratio compared with the known plastics having a bimodal mole¬cular weight distribution.<br>
EP-A-0 797 599 discloses a process which even gives a polyethylene having a trimodal molecular weight distribution in successive gas-phase and liquid-phase polymerizations. Although this polyethylene is already very highly suitable for the production of hollow articles in extrusion blow moulding plants, it is, however, still in need of further improvement in its processing behaviour owing to the plastic melt swelling rate, which is still too low-<br>
The object of the present invention was the development of a polyethylene moulding compound by means of which an even better ratio of stiffness to stress cracking resistance compared with all known matehais can be achieved and which, in addi¬tion, has a high swelling rate of its melt, which, in the production of hollow articles by the extrusion blow moulding process, not only enables optimum wall thickness con¬trol, but at the same time also facilitates excellent weld line formation and wall thickness distribution.<br><br>
This object Is achieved by a moulding compound of the generic type mentioned at the outset, whose characterizing features are to be regarded as being that it com¬prises from 30 to 60% by weight of a low-molecular-weight ethylene homopolymer A, from 65 to 30% by weight of a high-molecular-weight copolymer B comprising ethylene and another olefin having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms, and from 1 to 30% by weight of an ultrahigh-molecular-weight ethylene homopolymer or copolymer C, where all percentages are based on the total weight of the moulding compound.<br>
The invention furthermore also relates to a method for the production of this moulding compound in cascaded suspension polymerization, and to hollow articles made from this moulding compound with very excellent mechanical strength properties.<br>
The polyethylene moulding compound according to the invention has a density in the range &gt; 0.940 g/cm^ at a temperature of 23X and has a broad trimodal molecular weight distnbution. The high-molecuiar-weight copolymer B comprises small propor¬tions of up to 5% by weight of further olefin monomer units having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms. Examples of comonomers of this type are 1 -butene, 1 -pentene, 1-hexene, 1-odene or 4-methyl-1-pentene. The ultrahigh-molecular-weight ethylene homopolymer or copolymer C may optionally also comprise an amount of from 0 to 10% by weight of one or more of the above-mentioned comonomers.<br>
The moulding compound according to the invention furthermore has a melt flow index, in accordance with ISO 1133, expressed as MFI190/5, in the range from 0,01 to 10 dg/min and a viscosity number VNtot, measured in accordance with ISO/R 1191 in decalin at a temperature of 135°C, in the range from 190 to 7QQ cm^/g, preferably from 250 to 500 cm^/g.<br>
The trlmodality can be described as a measure of the position of the centres of the<br><br>
three individual molecular weight distributions with the aid of the viscosity numbers VN in accordance with ISO/R 1191 of the polymers formed In the successive poly¬merization steps. The following band widths of the polymers formed in the individual reaction steps should be taken into account heris:<br>
The viscosity number VNi measured on the polymer after the first polymerization step is identical with the viscosity number VNA of the low-molecular-weight poly¬ethylene A and is in accordance with the invention in the range from 40 to 180 cm^/g.<br>
VNB of the relatively high-molecular-weight polyethylene B formed in the second polymerization step can be calculated from the following mathematical formula:<br><br>
where wi represents the proportion by weight of the low-molecular-weight poly¬ethylene formed in the first step, measured in % by weight, based on the total weight of the polyethylene having a bimodal molecular weight distribution formed in the first two steps, and VN2 represents the viscosity number measured on the polymer after the second polymerization step. The value calculated for VNs is normally in the range from 150 to 800 cm^/g.<br>
VNc for the ultrahigh-molecular-weight homopolymer or copolymer C formed in the third polymerization step is calculated from the following mathematical formula:<br><br>
where W2 represents the proportion by weight of the polyethylene having a bimodal molecular weight distribution formed in the first two steps, measured in % by weight,<br><br>
based on the total weight of the polyethylene having a thmodai molecular weight distribution formed in all three steps, and VN3 represents the viscosity number which is measured on the polymer after the third polymerization step and is identical with the VNiot already mentioned above. The value calculated for VNc is in accordance with the invention in the range from 900 to 3000 cm^/g.<br>
The polyethylene is obtained by polymerization of the monomers in suspension or at temperatures in the range from 20 to 120'C, a pressure in the range from 2 to 60 bar and in the presence of a highly active Ziegler catalyst composed of a transition-metal compound and an organoaluminium compound. The polymerization is carried out in three steps, i.e. in three successive steps, with the molecular weight in each case being regulated with the aid of metered-in hydrogen.<br>
The polymerization catalyst's long-term activity, which is necessary for the cascaded procedure described above, is ensured by a specially developed Ziegler catalyst. A measure of the suitability of this catalyst is its extremely high hydrogen responsive¬ness and its high activity, which remains constant over a long period of from 1 to 8 hours. Specific examples of a catalyst which is suitable in this manner are the pro¬ducts cited in EP-A-0 532 551, EP-A-0 068 257 and EP-A-0 401 776 of the reaction of magnesium aikoxides with transition-metal compounds of titanium, zirconium or vanadium and an organometallic compound of a metal from groups I, II or lU of the Periodic Table of the Elements.<br>
Besides the polyethylene, the polyethylene moulding compound according to the invention may also comprise further additives. Additives of this type are, for example, heat stabilizers, antioxidants, UV absorbers, light stabilizers, metal deactivators, peroxide-destroying compounds, basic costabilizers in amounts of from 0 to 10% by weight, preferably from 0 to 5% by weight, but also fillers, reinforcing agents, plasti-cizers, lubricants, emulsifiers, pigments, optical brighteners, flame retardants, anti¬statics, blowing agents or combinations thereof in total amounts of from 0 to 50% by<br><br>
weight, based on the total weight of the mixture.<br>
The moulding compound according to the invention is particularly suitable for the production of hollow articles, such as fuel canisters, chemical-resistant containers, canisters, drums and bottles, by firstly plasticating the polyethylene moulding com¬pound in an extruder at temperatures in the range from 200 to 250'C, and then extruding the compound through a die into a blow mould, and cooling it therein.<br>
For conversion into hollow articles, use can be made of both conventional single-screw extruders having a smooth feed zone and high-performance extruders having a finely grooved barrel and forced conveying feed section. The screws are typically designed as decompression screws with a length of from 25 to 30 D {D = diameter). The decompression screws have a discharge zone in which temperature differences in the melt are compensated and in which the relaxation stresses formed due to shearing are intended to be dissipated.<br>
Example 1 (according to the invention):<br>
The polymerization of ethylene was carried out in a continuous method in three reactors connected in series.

The reduction in the amount of hydrogen was again carried out via interim H2 decompression.<br>
The polymerization in the second reactor was carried out at a temperature of SS^C and a pressure of 0.21 MPa for a period of 80 minutes.<br>
This gave a polyethylene having a bimodal molecular weight distribution, as corre¬sponds to the prior art in accordance with EP-A 603 935,<br><br><br><br>
The abbreviations for the physical properties in Table 1 have the following meanings:<br>
FCM = flexural creep modulus, measured in accordance with ISO 54852-Z4 in N/mm2 as the one-minute value,<br>
SCR = stress cracking resistance of the moulding compound according to the invention. It is determined by an internal measurement method. This labora¬tory method has been described by M. FleiSner in Kunststoffe 77 (1987), pp. 45 ff. This publication shows that there is a correlation between the determi¬nation of slow crack growth in the creep test on test bars with all-round notches and the brittle branch in the long-term failure test under internal hydrostatic pressure in accordance with ISO 1167, A shortening of the time to failure is achieved by shortening the crack initiation time by the notches (1.6 mm/razor blade) in ethylene glycol as stress crack-promoting medium at a temperature of 80'C and a tensile stress of 3.5 MPa. The samples are pro¬duced by sawing three test specimens measuring 10 x 10 x 90 mm out of a pressed sheet with a thickness of 10 mm. The test specimens are provided with all-round notches in the centre using a razor blade in a notching device produced especially for the purpose (shown in Figure 5 in the publication by FleiUner), The notch depth is 1.6 mm.<br>
FT = fracture toughness of the moulding compound according to the inven¬tion. It is likewise determined by an internal measurement method on test bars measuring 10 x 10 x 80 mm which had been sawn out of a pressed sheet with a thickness of 10 mm. Six of these test bars are notched in the centre using a razor blade in the notching device mentioned above. The notch depth is 1,6 mm. The measurement Is carried out substantially in accordance with the Charpy measurement method in accordance with ISO 179 with modi¬fied test specimens and modified impact geometry (distance between sup¬ports). All test specimens are conditioned to the measurement temperature of<br><br>
Q°C over a period of from 2 to 3 hours. A test specimen is then placed without delay onto the support of a pendulum impact tester in accordance with ISO 179. The distance between the supports is 60 mm. The drop of the 2 J hammer is triggered, with the drop angle being set to 160°, the pendulum length to 225 mm and the impact velocity to 2.93 m/sec. In order to evaluate the measurement, the quotient of the impact energy consumed and the initial cross-sectional area at the notch apw in mJ/mm^ is calculated. Only values for complete fracture and hinge fracture can be used here as the basis for a common mean (see ISO 179).<br>
SR = swelling rate, measured in a high-pressure capillary rheometer at a shear rate of 1440 1/s in a 2/2 round-hole die with a conical entry (angle = 15°) at a temperature oU90°C.<br>
The measurement values clearly show that the moulding compound according to the invention in all cases resulted in better strength properties and aiso had better pro¬cessing properties during production.<br><br><br>
It can be seen that the moulding compound according to the comparative example forms an excessively thin weld line, which in addition has a V notch, which represents a weak point which may burst under pressure load.   •<br><br><br>
