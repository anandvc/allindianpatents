FIELD OF INVENTION:-<br>
The present invention relates to a novel device that indicates the distance moved by the Earth's equator in front of the Sun. The invention further provides the principles of operating the device and the mechanism of working of the said device. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION -<br>
Presently, time is being indicated by Time Pieces also called Watches. As already explained and proved ( not given here as it makes the application too long but if desired the inventor is prepared to explain and prove the point) that the old concept of time is a myth and a figment of our imagination and as such has no tangible meaning. If we say it is a certain time of the day or the night it is a meaningless statement. What we are really trying to say is how many kilometres or miles the Earth's equator has rotated relative to the Sun at this point in distance starting from a new revolution, i.e a point in distance in the Earth's equatorial revolution in front of the Sun. Although there is no time even then a Time Piece could be used as a Distance Piece to indicate distances moved by the Earth's Equator in front of the Sun. The Scale of the Time Piece is 60x60x12x2 (24 hours') which is 86.400 seconds as there is no time there are no seconds but we could take 86,400 divisions of the Earth's Equator. Therefore dividing 40075 kms by 86,400, we get 0.463831 kms = 1 Portion(P). Therefore the movement of 1/86,400* of the Equator is 0.463831 kms (IP) and this multiplied by 60 = 27.82986 kms = 1 Range (R) which further multiplied by 60 gives us 1669.7916 kms = 1 Basic (B) [which is 1/24th of the Earth's Equatorial revolution = 1 Length (L)] and again by multiplying it by 12 = 20037.499 kms = 1 Extent (E) [half the Earth's Equatorial revolution=(E)] and again multiplied by 2, we get 40075 kms = 1 Length (L) the full length of the Earth's Equatorial revolution in front of the sun. We, however, see that there are too many decimal points in such a scale and our object is to obtain a more convenient scale. As such we took the Atichina Lambu Kilometer Scale where we got 1 Basic = 2000 Lkms, 1 Range = 40 Lkms &amp; I Portion = 0.8 Lkms. Which was also not satisfactory as one Portion was equal to a decimal point Lambu Kilometer =0.8 Lkms. We have therefore now taken the Atichina Madhvam Kilometer Scale where 1 Portion =1 Unit = 1 Mkms, 1 Range = 50 Mkms 1 Basic=2500 Mkms. This is therefore, the background for the invention of a Distance Piece.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENT1ON:-<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide a novel device which indicates live distance traveled by the earth's equator relative to the sun.<br>
Another object is to provide the principles that operate the said device and still another object is to provide the mechanism of working of the said device<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS ACCMPANYING THE SPECIFICATION : "The drawings are not to scale"<br>
Figure 1 represents the top view of the dial and needles of the distance piece of the present invention which consists of D the dial, 0, 1, 2...10 are 10 Basic divisions of the dial. The Basic division 0 to 1 is further subdivided into 5 sub divisions. All the other Basic divisions i.e. 1 to 10 are similarly divided Into 5 sub divisions not shown here. Needle B is for Basics, R for Ranges &amp; P for Portions.<br>
Figure 2 represents the movement of the needles on the Dial of the Distance Piece is shown such that when B moves from 0 to 1=1/10 rev, (rev = revolution) R moves a complete revolution i.e from 0 to 10 (1 rev ) and P moves 50 revolutions (50 rev) such that IB indicates 2500 madhyam kilometer, one Range indicates 2500 divided 50 = 50 Ranges and 50 Ranges divided 50 = 1 Portion.<br>
Figure 3: The distance Piece that consists of a dial (D) having 10 Basic divisions and each basic division is further divided into 5 sub-divisions. It also shows the exploded view of the gear train mechanism of the Distance Piece which consists of gear 1 with 10 teeth mounted on a inner tube, gear 1 is in mesh with gear 2, Gear 2 has 100 teeth and it is coupled to gear 3 by a common shaft, Gear 3 has equal number of teeth and is in mesh with gear 4 which is mounted on the outer tube, Gear 5 with 100 teeth is fixed below gear 1 on the inner spindle (about 92 teeth) and gear 6 with 20 teeth (about 18 teeth) (These reduced sizes of gear 5 &amp; 6 are to ensure proper matching between gear 7&amp; 8 ) gear 6 is coupled by a common shaft to gear 7 with 100 teem, gear 7 is in mesh with gear 8 having 10 teeth. Gear 8 is mounted at the lower end of the central spindle inside the inner tube. The upper end of the central spindle has the portion indicator needle P fixed to it. The Inner Tube (IT) also has the Range indicator needle fixed at its top end. And the top end of this outer tube has the basic indicator needle fixed to it. And all these indicator needles (B),(R), ( P) move in the same direction on dial (D).<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION;<br>
The invention provides a novel Distance Piece, as shown in figure I of the accompanying drawings. The Earth's Equator measures 40075 kms which does not allow itself to be divided decimal freely. So in order to overcome this problem we introduce the Madhyam Kilometer which is equal in Length to 0.8015 Normal kilometers. (the Madhyam kilometers has been obtained by dividing 40075 kilometer by 50,000). In other words one Madhyam kilometer ( which is 0.8015 Normal kilometers) divides exactly 50,000 times into the Equator having 40075 Normal kilometers. . A preferred scale for dividing the Length of the Equator would be according to the Atichina Scale of Which is dividing the Equator first into 20 parts then again the 20 parts into a 100 parts and finally one of these hundred parts again into hundred parts i.e. the Atichinna Scale is) 20 x 100 x 100. To represent the whole distance of the Equator i.e. 50,000 Madhyam kms on the Dial of the Distance Piece may make the Dial of the Distance Piece too big and clumsy. So we divide it into two equal parts each having 25.000 Madhyam kms. Each 25,000 Madhyam kms is further divided into 10 Basics, each Basic being 2500 Madhyam Kms. Each Basic is furtther divided into 50 Ranges, so that each Range would be 50 Madhyam kms and each Range is further divided into 50 Portions. So that each Portion is 1 Madhyam kilometer or 1000 Madhyam meters.<br>
Continued on Page - 3<br>
Accordingly the applicant has developed a Distance Piece incorporating this principle. The said Distance Piece is shown in figure 1 of the accompanying drawings. The said piece consists of a Dial (D) having three needles, (B) for Basics (R) for Ranges and (P) for Portions. The Dial face of the Distance Piece divided into 10 Basics with a Basic needle B. Further these Basics are divided into five sub divisions. The Distance Piece has also 2 other needles called the Range needle R and the Portion needle P.<br>
Note: The position of the needles shown in Figure - I is 9 Basics, 16 Ranges and 4 Portions. 9 Basics, 16 Ranges &amp; 4 Portions = 9 	X 2500 + 16 X 50 + 4 X 1 = 22500 + 800 + 4 = 23304 Madhyam kilometers (23304 X 0.8015 = 18678.15 Normal Kilometers)<br>
Equatorial Movement and the movement of the needles in relationship to it<br>
Equatorial Movement	Needle Movement<br>
One full revolution of the Earth's Equator A Two Complete revolution of the Basic<br>
Needle on the Dial face.<br>
50,000 Mkms	∆ 1 Length<br>
50,000 Mkms ÷ 2 = 25,000 Mkms	∆ 1 Extent<br>
25,000 ÷ 10 = 2500 Mkms	∆ 1 Basic<br>
2500 ÷ 50 (=5X10)= 50 Mkms	∆ I Range<br>
50 ÷ 50 (=5X10)= 1 Mkms	∆ 1 Portion<br>
A Means Corresponds To<br>
MECHANISM OF WORKING:<br>
1)	When the Earth's Equator makes ½ a revolution i.e. 1 Extent A 25,000 Madhyam Kms (ie.<br>
20037.5 Normal kms with respect to the Sun). The Basic needle B makes 1 complete Dial<br>
revolution ( i.e. 10 Basic division)<br>
2)	When the Earth's Equator revolves 2,500 Madhyam kms the Basic needle makes 1/10th of<br>
the Complete Dial revolution. l/l0th being further divided in 5 sub divisions. 1 sub division<br>
moved by the Basic needle would represent 500 Madhyam kms rotated by the Earth's Equator.<br>
3)	When the Basic needle moves 1710th of the complete Dial the Range needle R moves the<br>
complete Dial, which represents the Earth's Equator having revolved 2,500 Madhyam km. The<br>
Dial is divided into 10x5=50 divisions. So 1 division moved by the Range needle will be 2.500<br>
 50 = 50 Madhyam kms.<br>
4)	When the Range needle moves 1 division i.e.  1/50th of the Dial the Portion needle P moves<br>
1 full revolution of the Dial. As such the movement of 1 division by the Portion needle would<br>
represent 50 Madhyam Kms ÷ 50 = I Madhyam kilometers or 1000 Meters. Better still if he<br>
reduce the size of gear 5 from a 100 mm. To 91.7 mm. and gear 6 from 20 mm. to 18.34 mm.<br>
we achieve a perfect matching maintaing the same gear ratios of the complete gear train .<br>
Besides, there is a 0.02 mm. interference between to prevent slipping and insure perfect<br>
operation.<br><br>
The working and the mechanism of the Distance Piece is illustrated in figures II and III of the accompanying drawings. In figure II, the structure of the Distance Piece Dial is shown wherein the needles B, R and P indicate the Basic, Range and the Portion needles. When needle R moves a full Dial revolution (lr) needle B moves from 0 to 1 on the Dial. When needle R moves 1/5th of the Distance between 0 to 1 the Portion<br>
needle moves a complete revolution (lr) of the Dial. This is indicated in figure II. In order to see it more clearly we go to the enlarged view figure III where the Gear train is more clearly visible. Gear 1 having 10 teeth is responsible for moving needle R one full revolution (lr) on the Dial face. Gear 2 which is in mesh with Gear 1 having 100 teeth is responsible in moving needle B over a distance of 1/10th revolution (l/10th r) of the Dial face by means of Gear 3 and 4. Gear 4 is fixed to the lower end of Outer Tube (OT). The Upper end of OT is fixed to the needle B. These two Gears 3 and 4 which are in mesh and which have a plurality of teeth that are equal in number, Looking downward the Inner Tube (IT) having Gear 1 has at Us lower end a Gear 5 having 100 teeth, This is in mesh with another Gear 6 having 20 teeth. So when Gear 5 moves through 100 teeth Gear 6 having 20 teeth makes 5 full revolutions. Also the Spindle of Gear 6 has at its lower end a Gear 7 having 100 teeth. So when this moves 5 revolutions i.e. 500 teeth which moves Gear 8 having 10 teeth through 500/10 = 50 revolutions, Gear 8 is fixed firmly to the Central Spindle which therefore also moves 50 revolutions and is responsible for the movement of needle P through 50 revolutions (5()r) on the Dial Face. Gear 7 &amp; 8 are appropriately meshed.<br>
As such we see when needle B moves 1/10 revolution (l/10thr) of the Dial face it indicates that the Earth's Equator has revolved by 2500 Madhyam kms the needle R makes one full revolution (Ir) of the Dial face and one small division moved by needle R on the dial face is 2500 / 50 = 50 Madhyam kms moved by the Earth's Equator and when needle R moves one small division [ i.e. 1/50th revolution<br>
(1750th r) of the Dial face], needle P moves, one full revolution (Ir) which means one small division moved by needle P of the Dial face which indicates 50 Madhyam Kms 150 = 1 Madhyam kilometer or 1000 Madhyam meters moved by the Earth's Equator.<br><br><br><br><br>
