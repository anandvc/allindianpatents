Diazinopyrimidines<br>
[01]	The present invention relates to diazinopyimidines, a process for their manufacture,<br>
compositions comprising the same, and methods for using the same. In particular, the present invention relates to pyrimido[4,5-e]oxadiazines.<br>
[02]	Protein kinases are a class of proteins (enzymes) that regulate a variety of cellular<br>
functions. This is accomplished by the phosphorylation of specific amino acids on protein substrates resulting in conformational alteration of the substrate protein. The conformational change modulates the activity of the substrate or its ability to interact with other binding partners. The enzyme activity of the protein kinase refers to the rate at which the kinase adds phosphate groups to a substrate. It can be measured, for example, by determining the amount of a substrate that is converted to a product as a function of time. Phosphorylation of a substrate occurs at the active-site of a protein kinase.<br>
[03]	Tyrosine kinases are a subset of protein kinases that catalyze the transfer of the<br>
terminal phosphate of adenosine triphosphate to tyrosine residues on protein substrates. These kinases play an important part in the propagation of growth factor signal transduction that leads to cellular proliferation, differentiation and migration.<br>
[04]	For example, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor<br>
(VEGF) have been recognized as important mediators of tumor promoted angiogenesis. VEGF activates endothelial cells by signaling through two high affinity receptors, one of which is the kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR). See Hennequin L. F. et. al., J. Med. Chem., 2002, 45, 1300. FGF activates endothelial cells by signaling through the FGF receptor (FGFR).   Solid tumors depend upon the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) to grow. Accordingly, inhibitors of the receptors FGFR and KDR that interfere with the growth signal transduction, and thus slow down or prevent angiogenisis, are useful agents in the prevention and treatment of solid tumors. See Klohs W.E. et. al., Current Opinion in Biotechnology, 1999,10, 544.<br><br>
[05]	Other protein kinases include mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP) which is a<br>
family of proline-directed serine/threonine kinases that activate their substrates by dual<br>
phosphorylation. One group of MAP kinases is the p38 kinase group which includes various<br>
isoforms (e.g., p38a, p39p,p38Y and p385). The p38 kinases are responsible for phosphorylating<br>
and activating transcription factors as well as other kinases, and are themselves activated by<br>
physical and chemical stress, pro-inflammatory cytokines and bacterial lipopolysaccharide.<br>
[06]	More importantly, the products of the p3 8 phosphorylation have been shown to<br>
mediate the production of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF and IL-1, and cyclooxygenase-2. Each of these cytokines has been implicated in numerous disease states and conditions. For example, TNF-a is a cytokine produced primarily by activated monocytes and macrophages. Its excessive or unregulated production has been implicated as playing a causative role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. More recently, inhibition of TNF production has been shown to have broad application in the treatment of inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and asthma.<br>
[07]	TNF has also been implicated in viral infections, such as HIV, influenza virus, and<br>
herpes virus including herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2), cytomegalovirus (CMV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus, human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6), human herpesvirus-7 (HHV-7), human herpesvirus-S (HHV-8), pseudorabies and rhinotracheitis, among others.<br>
108]	Similarly, IL-1 is produced by activated monocytes and macrophages, and plays a<br>
role in many pathophysiological responses including rheumatoid arthritis, fever and reduction of bone resorption.<br>
[09]	Additionally, the involvement of p38 has been implicated in stroke, Alzheimer's<br>
disease, osteoarthritis, lung injury, septic shock, angiogenesis, dermatitis, psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. J. Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents, (2000) 10(1).<br>
[10]	The inhibition of these cytokines by inhibition of the p38 kinase is of benefit in<br>
controlling, reducing and alleviating many of these disease states.<br><br>
[11]	There are several examples of synthetic inhibitors for various protein kinases.<br>
Typically, kinase inhibitors block the phosphorylation of substrates by tightly interacting with the<br>
protein kinase ATP binding site (or "active site"). See WO 98/24432 and Heraiequin L. F. et. al., J.<br>
Med. Che7jt.,20Q2, 45, 1300. Several of these compounds inhibit multiple targets. See also, PCT<br>
Publication Nos. WO 99/61444, WO 02/18380, and WO 01/64679; and U.S. PatentNo. 6,150,373;<br>
[12]	However, there continues to be a need for compounds that are effective in inhibiting<br>
the catalytic activity of protein kinases, in particular FGF and KDR kinases for treating one or more types of solid tumors. It is particularly desirable to provide inhibitors that are selective for FGF and KDR. Selectivity is particularly desired due to a potential concomitant toxicity and other undesirable complications that may follow from inhibiting multiple targets. It is preferable that such inhibitors also possess advantageous bioavailability profiles.<br>
[13]	In one aspect of the present invention provides compounds represented by the<br>
formula: <br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein<br>
R1 is hydrogen or alkyl;<br>
R2 is alkyl, haloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, heteroaryl, heteroaralkyl, cycloalkl,<br>

X is O, NR2, or S, where R2 is hydrogen or alkyl; and<br>
X is a bond, O, NR2 S or CHa, where R' is hydrogen or alkyl.<br>
[14]	The compounds of formula I and their aforementioned salts are inhibitors of protein<br>
kinases, and exhibit effective activity against p38 MAP kinase and FGFR kinase. Therefore, the<br>
compounds can be used for the treatment of diseases mediated by the pro-inflammatory cytokines<br>
sucli as TNF and IL-1 as well as proliferative disorders such as cancer and restenosis.<br>
[15]	Thus, in another aspect, the present invention relates to methods for the treatment of<br>
p38 MAP kinase and FGFR kinase mediated diseases or conditions in which a therapeutically<br>
effective amount of a compound of formula I is administered to a patient in need of such treatment.<br>

Bull, 1986, 34, 2719) with alkyl hydrazines provides a compound of formula 2, which is then acylated to give a compound of formula 3. The cyclization of 3 in the presence of sodium hydroxide and triethylamine gives 4 (see Elliott, AJ.; Gibson, M.S., J. Org. Chem. 1980, 45, 3677). The reaction is typically carried out with DMF or NMP at 120 "C.<br>
[82]	Oxidation of compound 4 with an oxidizing agent, such as 3-chloroperbenzoic acid<br>
(i.e., MCPBA) and Oxone®, provides a sulfone 5 which can be converted into a variety of target compounds. Typically the oxidation of 5 is carried out in a solvent which is inert under the conditions of the oxidation. For example, when MCPBA is used as the oxidizing agent, the solvent is preferably a halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon, especially dichloromethane. Aen Oxone® is used as the oxidizing agent, the typical solvent is water and/or tetrahydrofuran. The reaction temperature depends on the solvent used. For an organic solvent, the reaction temperature is generally at about -20 °C to about 50 °C, preferably about 0 "C to about room temperature. When water is used as the solvent, the reaction temperature is generally from about 0 °C to about 50 °C, preferably about 0 °C to about room temperature.<br><br>
[83]	Reaction of compound 5 with an amine of formula R2R2NH, wherein R1 and R2 are as<br>
defined herein above, affords a compound of Formula I.   The reaction can be carried out in the<br>
presence or absence of a solvent. Conveniently, the reaction is carried out at temperatures of from<br>
about 0 "C to about 200 "C, more preferably about room temperature to about 150 "C.<br>
[84]	Alternatively compounds with a formula I when R3 is aryl can be prepared according<br><br>
[85]	Reaction of 1 with 6 yields a compound of a formula 3. The rest of the steps are<br>
similar to those outline in Scheme 1.<br>
[86]	One of skill in the art will understand that certain modifications to the above<br>
schemes are contemplated and within the scope of the present invention. For example, certain steps<br>
will involve the use of protecting groups for functional groups that are not compatible with<br>
particular reaction conditions.<br>
[87]	The compounds of formula I and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of basic<br>
compounds of formula I with acids can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical<br>
preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered enterally, e.g. orally in the form<br>
of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or<br>
suspensions, nasally, e.g. in the form of nasal sprays, or rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories.<br>
However, they may also be administered parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
[88]	The compounds of formula I and their aforementioned pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, organic or inorganic carriers for the production<br>
of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose, com starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its<br><br>
salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like; depending on the nature of the active ingredient no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose and the like. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.<br>
[89]	The pharmaceutical preparations can also contain preservatives, solubilizers,<br>
stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain therapeutically valuable substances other than the compounds of formula I and their aforementioned pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
[90]	Medicaments which contain a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt of a basic compound of formula I with an acid in association with a compatible pharmaceutical carrier material are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for the production of such medicaments which comprises bringing one or more of these compounds or salts and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical administration form together with a compatible pharmaceutical carrier.<br>
[91]	As mentioned earlier, the compounds of fomiula I and their aforementioned<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be used in accordance with the invention as therapeutically active substances, especially as anti-inflammatory agents or for the prevention of graft rejection following transplant surgery. The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, in the case of administration to adults a convenient daily dosage should be about 0.1 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg, preferably about 0.5 mg/kg to about 5 mg/kg. The daily dosage may be administered as a single dose or in divided doses and, in addition, the upper dosage limit refeiTed to earlier may be exceeded when this is found to be indicated.<br>
[92]	Finally, the use of compounds of formula I and their aforementioned<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts for the production of medicaments, especially in the treatment or prophylaxis of inflammatory, immunological, oncological, bronchopulmonary, demiatological and<br><br>
cardiovascular disorders, in the treatment of asthma, central nervous system disorders or diabetic complications or for the prevention of graft rejection following transplant surgery, is also an object of the invention.<br>
[93]	Compounds of Formula I would be useful for, but not limited to, the treatment of any<br>
disorder or disease state in a human, or other mammal, which is exacerbated or caused by excessive or unregulated TNF or p38 kinase production by such mammal. Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of treating a cytokine-mediated disease which comprises administering an effective cytokine-interfering amount of a compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or tautomer thereof<br>
[94]	Compounds of Formula I would be useful for, but not limited to, the treatment of<br>
inflammation in a subject, and for use as antipyretics for the treatment of fever. Compounds of the invention would be useful to treat arthritis, including but not limited to, rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthropathies, gouty arthritis, osteoarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and juvenile arthritis, osteoarthritis, gouty arthritis and other arthritic conditions. Such compounds would be useful for the treatment of pulmonary disorders or lung inflammation, including adult respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary sarcoidosis, asthma, silicosis, and chronic pulmonary inflammatory disease. The compounds are also useful for the treatment of viral and bacterial infections, including sepsis, septic shock, gram negative sepsis, malaria, meningitis, cachexia secondary to infection or malignancy, cachexia secondary to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), AIDS, ARC (AIDS related complex), pneumonia, and herpes virus. The compounds are also useful for the treatment of bone resorption diseases, such as osteoporosis, endotoxic shock, toxic shock syndrome, reperfusion injury, autoimmune disease including graft vs. host reaction and allograft rejections, cardiovascular diseases including atlierosclerosis, thrombosis, congestive heart failure, and cardiac reperfusion injury, renal reperfusion injury, liver disease and nephritis, and myalgias due to infection.<br>
[95]	The compounds are also useful for the treatment of influenza, multiple sclerosis,<br>
cancer, diabetes, systemic lupus erthrematosis (SLE), skin-related conditions such as psoriasis, eczema, bums, dermatitis, keloid formation, and scar tissue formation. Compounds of the invention also would be useful to treat gastrointestinal conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, gastritis, irritable bowel disease and ulcerative colitis. The compounds would also<br><br>
be useful in the treatment of ophthalmic diseases, such as retinitis, retinopathies, uveitis, ocular<br>
photophobia, and of acute injury to the eye tissue. Compounds of the invention also would be<br>
useful for treatment of angiogenesis, including neoplasia; metastasis; ophthalmological conditions<br>
such as corneal graft rejection, ocular neovascularization, retinal neovascularization including<br>
neovascularization following injury or infection, diabetic retinopathy, retrolental fibroplasia and<br>
neovascular glaucoma; ulcerative diseases such as gastric ulcer; pathological, but non-malignant,<br>
conditions such as hemangiomas, including infantile hemangiomas, angiofibroma of the<br>
nasopharynx and avascular necrosis of bone; diabetic nephropathy and cardiomyopathy; and<br>
disorders of the female reproductive system such as endometriosis. The compounds of the<br>
invention may also be useful for preventing the production of cyclooxygenase-2.<br>
[96]	Besides being useful for human treatment, these compounds are also useful for<br>
veterinary treatment of companion animals, exotic animals and farm animals, including mammals,<br>
rodents, and the like. More preferred animals include horses, dogs, and cats.<br>
[97]	The present compounds may also be used in co-therapies, partially or completely, in<br>
place of other conventional antiinflammatories, such as together with steroids, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, NSAIDs, DMARDS, immunosuppressive agents, 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors, LTB4 antagonists and LTA4 hydrolase inhibitors.<br>
[98]	As used herein, the term "TNF mediated disordeR11 refers to any and all disorders and<br>
disease states in which TNF plays a role, either by control of TNF itself, or by TNF causing anotlier<br>
monokine to be released, such as but not limited to IL-1, IL-6 or IL-8. A disease state in which, for<br>
instance, IL-1 is a major component, and whose production or action, is exacerbated or secreted in<br>
response to TNF, would therefore be considered a disorder mediated by TNF.<br>
[99]	As used herein, the term "p38 mediated disordeR11 refers to any and all disorders and<br>
disease states in which p38 plays a role, either by control of p38 itself, or by p38 causing another factor to be released, such as but not limited to IL-1, IL-6 or IL-8. A disease state in which, for instance, IL-1 is a major component, and whose production or action, is exacerbated or secreted in response to p38, would therefore be considered a disorder mediated by p38.<br>
[100]	As TNF-P has close structural homology with TNF-a (also known as cachectin), and<br>
since each induces similar biologic responses and binds to the same cellular receptor, the synthesis<br><br>
of both TNF-a and TNF-[3 are inhibited by the compounds of the present invention and thus are<br>
herein referred to collectively as "TNF" unless specifically delineated otherwise.<br>
[101]	The compounds of Formula I are also cellular antiproliferative agents and useful in<br>
treating proliferative disorders such as cancer. Specific tumors include small cell lung carcinoma,<br>
human breast cancer, low grade human bladder carcinomas and human colorectal cancer.<br>
[102]	The ability of the compounds of the present invention to inhibit p3 8 MAP kinase was<br>
demonsti-ated by the in vitro assay described in Example 57. The ability of the compounds of the<br>
present invention to inhibit the release of TNF-a was demonstrated by the in vitro and the in vivo<br>
assays described in detail in Examples 58 and 59, respectively. The anti-inflammatory activity of<br>
the compounds of this invention can be determined utilizing adjuvant induced arthritis in rats assay<br>
described in Example 60.<br>
[103]	The ability of the compounds of the present invention to inhibit FGRR kinase may<br>
be determined by procedures such as those described in W099/61444 and W098/34867.<br><br><br>
