The following specification describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
Field of invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparation of clopidogrel bisulphate whose (S)-isomer is known for its advantage in therapeutics, especially for its platelet anti-aggregating and anti-thrombotic activities. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for converting the low chiral purity of (S)-isomer of clopidogrel bisulphate to high chiral purity compound.<br>
Background and prior art:<br>
Clopidogrel is the international non-proprietary name of (+)-Methyl (2-chlorophenyl)-(6,7-dihydro-4H-thieno[3,2-c]pyrid-5-yl)acetate which is having the following structure.<br><br>
Clopidogrel"s platelet inhibiting activity makes it an effective drug for reducing the incidence ischemic strokes, heart attacks or claudication due to vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis. By inhibiting platelet aggregation, clopidogrel reduces the chance of arterial blockage, thus preventing strokes and heart attacks.<br>
2<br><br>
Recent studies have shown that clopidogrel is more effective in blocking platelet aggregation than asprin and is much gentler on the gastrointestinal tract. Clopidogrel is more effective than asprin event at much lower dosage. Clopidogrel is administered as its bisulphate salt. The enantiomer (S)-clopidogrel is particularly preferred since it is the pharmaceutically active compound.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
According to the present invention there is a process provided to prepare the (S)-isomer of clopidogrel bisulphate with high degree of chiral purity starting from the (S)-isomer of clopidogrel base having low chiral purity of 90% by precipitating the undesired (R)-isomer of clopidogrel bisulphate first by controlling the concentration of the sulphuric acid and the reaction temperature, followed by filtration of the (R)-isomer, then the isolation of the desired (S)-isomer of clopidogrel bisulphate with high chiral purity.<br>
The present invention provides a process to prepare the (S)-isomer of clopidogrel bisulphate with high chiral purity, in which the starting material is clopidogrel bisulphate of low chiral purity (90-98%), which is converted into free base first by treating with sodium hydrogencarbonate and converted into (S)-isomer of Clopidogrel bisulphate of high chiral purity.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, (+)-Methyl (2-chlorophenyl)-(6,7-dihydro-4H-thieno [3,2-c]pyrid-5-yl) acetate is dissolved in acetone and cooled gradually to 0°C.<br>
6<br><br>
Concentrated sulphuric acid is added to this by maintaining the temperature at 0°C and stirred for 5 hrs. The salt formed is undesired (R)-isomer of clopidogrel bisulphate which is sucked off immediately. To the above mother liquor, concentrated Sulphuric acid is added dropwise by maintaining the temperature under 0°C followed by aging for 30 minutes. The reaction mixture is warmed to 20-3 0°C and maintained at same temperature for further 6 hrs. The white solid precipitate formed is filtered and washed with acetone to get high purity product of (S)-isomer of clopidogrel bisulphate.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, (+)-Methyl (2-chlorophenyl)-(6,7-dihydro-4H-thieno [3,2-c]pyrid-5-yl)acetate bisulphate salt is taken into a mixture of demineral water and methylene chloride, and treated the resultant solution with 10% sodium hydrogen carbonate for 30 minutes at room temperature. The organic phase is separated and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue obtained is dissolved in acetone, cooled gradually to 0°C, and Concentrated Sulphuric acid added by maintaining the temperature at 0°C. This is stirred for 5 hrs at the same temperature to precipitate the undesired isomer which is the (R)-isomer of clopidogrel bisulphate, which is removed and dried under reduced pressure. After the removal of the (R)-isomer, concentrated sulphuric acid is added drop wise to the mother liquor, by maintaining the temperature under 0°C followed by aging for 30 minutes. The reaction mixture is warmed to 20-30°C and maintained at the same temperature for further 6 hrs. The white solid precipitated is filtered and washed with acetone to get the (S)-isomer of clopidogrel bisulphate with high degree of chiral purity.<br>
