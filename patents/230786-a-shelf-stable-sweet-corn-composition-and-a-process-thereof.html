				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present disclosure describes a sweet corn composition having extended shelf life and a process of its preparation. The sweet corn composition can be plain, sweet or salty. The disclosure further provides a process for the preparation of sweet corn composition.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Sweet corn is a genetically modified corn of recent origin with characteristic sweetness, juiciness and texture. Sweet corn paste is a highly perishable product susceptible to quick microbial spoilage resulting in a very short shelf life under ambient temperatures conditions. This invention relates to a process for producing a sweet corn paste which has an overall improved flavor, sweetness, taste and color.<br>
Sweet corn is popular because of its unique flavor, sweetness, taste and color. It is widely used for producing confectionary goods and processed foods and is also eaten fresh. In its use as a raw material for confectionary goods and processed foods, it is often used in the form of a paste.<br>
The prior art describes certain core technologies for the processing of sweet corn as such i.e. dehydration (Patent No. JP 2003299455), freezing (Patent No.JP 2373429) or thermally sterilized sweet corn kernels (Patent No. JP6217686). However, the preservation of sweet corn in paste form has relatively fewer reports. A US Patent (No. 4564531) describes flavour enhancement of sweet corn powder and paste by adding a maillard reaction product with a reducing sugar and specific amino acid as the flavour promoting substances by means of a heat induced synthetic product. US patent (No. 5196225) describes a blended food product of sweet corn paste and field corn to develop a nutritious product and the invention does not describe the storage stability of the product.<br>
Reports exists with regards to the development of corn starch and fruit pulp based structured foods through cold process for use in baked products withstanding the higher temperatures encountered during the baking process.<br>
Sorbates, benzoates and acidulants are well known antimicrobial agents and their use has been in vogue for several fruit based products. US patent (No. 6521276) describes the application of sorbate in combination with an acidulant for stabilization of food products made up of chiefly polysaccharides.<br>
Leistner (1994) described the role of combination preservation in extending the shelf stability of a number of products. However, these preservative hurdles are specific to the products concerned and their combinations and intensities differ depending on the nature of the product. Sweet corn is a unique raw material with a delicate flavour, texture and juiciness and the resultant paste also has specific sensory attributes which need to be preserved during the stabilization process. The existing literature concerns mostly the preservation of sweet corn kernels by core technologies i.e. dehydration, freezing and thermal process and the work on sweet corn paste deal with development of composite foods and necessary formulations thereof.<br>
Except as otherwise indicated, the disclosure of all patents, patent applications (and any patents which issue thereon, as well as any corresponding published foreign patent applications), and publications mentioned throughout this description are hereby incorporated by reference herein. It is expressly not admitted, however, that any of the documents incorporated by reference herein teach or disclose the present invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present disclosure particularly relates to a sweet corn composition having extended shelf life, the composition comprises sweet com paste, one or more preservative, and a biopreservative. The extended shelf life of the sweet corn composition is six months. The sweet corn composition is used in the form of a paste or a spread.<br>
In one aspect of the disclosure, the sweet corn composition having extended shelf life comprises sweet corn paste, one or more preservative, and a biopreservative, the preservatives are selected from a group consisting of citric acid, KMS, sodium benzoate, mallic acid, glucono-8-lactone and acetic acid.<br>
In another aspect of the disclosure, the sweet corn composition having extended shelf life comprises sweet corn paste, one or more preservative, and a biopreservative, the bio preservative is nisin.<br>
In yet another aspect of the disclosure, the sweet corn composition having extended shelf life comprises sweet corn paste, one or more preservative, and a biopreservative, the bio preservative is nisin having pH 4.2 - 4.5.<br>
In another aspect of the disclosure, the composition is a sweetened composition, a salty composition or a plain composition.<br>
Still yet another aspect of the present disclosure provides a process for the preparation of sweet corn composition, said process comprising:<br>
a.	milling of sweet corn kernel;<br>
b.	blanching the sweet corn kernel in boiled water;<br>
c.	pulverizing the sweet corn kernel to obtain a homogenous sweet corn<br>
paste;<br>
d.	concentrating the paste;<br>
e.	mixing the concentrate with preservatives and biopreservative;<br>
f.	homogenizing the concentrate;<br>
g.	packing and pasteurizing the sweet corn composition; and<br>
h. secondary packaging of polypropylene prepackaged sweet corn paste in PFP pouches.<br>
In one aspect of the present disclosure provides a sweetened sweet corn composition.<br>
In another aspect of the present disclosure provides a salty sweet corn composition.<br>
In yet another aspect of the present disclosure provides a plain sweet corn composition.<br>
Still yet another aspect of the present disclosure provides a process for the preparation of sweet corn composition, wherein the preservatives are selected from a group consisting of citric acid, KMS, sodium benzoate, mallic acid, glucono-5-lactone and acetic acid.<br>
In yet another aspect of the present disclosure provides a process for the preparation of sweet corn composition, wherein the biopreservative is nisin. Nisin (5-100 ppm) was used as a biopreservative in all the three forms of sweet corn composition i.e. sweet, salty and plain.<br>
Still yet another aspect of the present disclosure relates to a process of preparation of stabilized plain, sweet or salty sweet corn composition with necessary consistency and homogenous paniculate matter. The present disclosure provides a primary and secondary packaging for sweet corn composition. The secondary packaging includes other types of high barrier films i.e. PP-nylon-PP, HDPE, metallized polyester and BOPP films.<br>
In one embodiment of the disclosure describes methodology for the stabilization of sweet or salty sweet corn composition. The process includes preparation of sweet corn paste homogenate, pre-concentration to appropriate soluble solid level and consistency prior to the addition of anti microbial and anti browning agents under acidified condition followed by restricted thermal process. The unit packaging in lOOg flexible pouches with a secondary packing in high barrier<br>
laminated  pouches  gives  a minimum  shelf life  of 6  months under ambient temperature (24-38°C) conditions.<br>
In another embodiment of the disclosure differs from the existing know-how on sweet corn processing with respect to rendering of storage stability by means of combination preservation technique. Preparation of paste concentrate from sweet corn homogenate, application of preservative hurdles in necessary quantum, inclusion of a thermal process reducing agent and minute reduction in water activity as one of the preservative hurdles without adversely impeding the texture of the product are the novel features which ultimately render shelf stability to the product with acceptable sensory attributes. The present invention also provides a combination of preservative hurdles suitable for the preservation of sweet corn composition with minimal thermal process.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the present disclosure provides sweet corn composition with sweet, salty or plain taste which can be preserved for 6 months under ambient temperature (24-38°C) conditions. The process includes preparation of homogenized paste, concentration of the paste, addition of preservatives such as class I and class II preservatives followed by restricted thermal process. The concentration in particularly was carried out by thermal vacuum concentration method (400-600mm Hg) at 60 - 80°C. The concentration of the paste can also be carried out by methods well known in the art. The invention conforms to the stability of the product rendered by combination preservation. The Colloidal homogenization of the paste homogenate gives appropriate particulate size without serum separation. Moreover, the pre-concentration of the sweet corn homogenate renders spreadability besides causing a little reduction in water activity for the preservation purpose. Inclusion of a bio-preservative as one of the additives decreases the process time which is essential to protect the gelatinization of starch as the same even to a minute extent could adversely affect the spreadability of the product.<br>
The synergistic effects of the different class I and class II preservatives at minimal levels result in stabilization of the product. The salty and sweet taste could be obtained as per the requirement for the sweet corn composition catering to the requirement of different end uses. The product packaged in flexible pouches with<br>
necessary high barrier secondary packaging is suitable for ambient storage and retail marketing as 100 g or multiple of the same up to 1 kg per unit pack.<br>
One embodiment describes the process of preparation of sweetened sweet corn composition. For details refer Example 1.<br>
Another embodiment describes the process of preparation of salty sweet com composition. For details refer Example 2.<br>
Yet another embodiment describes the process of preparation of plain sweet corn composition. For details refer Example 3.<br>
Still another embodiment describes the packaging of the sweet corn composition. For details refer Example 4.<br>
While various embodiments and/or individual features of the present invention have been illustrated and described, it would be obvious to those skilled in the art that various other changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. As will be also be apparent to the skilled practitioner, all combinations of the embodiments and features taught in the foregoing disclosure are possible and can result in preferred executions of the invention. It is therefore intended to cover in the appended claims all such changes and modifications that are within the scope of this invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and the description of how to make and use the present invention, and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their invention nor are they intended to represent that the experiments below are all and only experiments performed.<br>
Example 1: Sweetened Sweet corn composition<br>
10 kg of sweet corn cobs without physical blemishes were washed with chlorinated water (100 ppm, 50 ml of sodium hypochlorite solution containing 4% available chlorine in 20 litres of water) for 5 min. The cobs were subjected to draining by putting in stainless steel wire mesh trays followed by manual separation of kernels. The 7 kg of kernels obtained were washed again in boiled and cooled water (14 litres) for 10 min. The sanitized kernels were blanched in boiling water (14 litres)<br>
for 5 min followed by pulverization in a colloidal mill to obtain a homogenous fine paste. Pulverization was carried out by methods well known in the art. The paste was concentrated in a vacuum kettle to obtain 18°B total soluble solids. The concentration can be done by other methods well known in the art such as non vacuum concentration. The concentrated paste (5.5 kg) was mixed with additives to obtain a sweetened Sweet corn Paste (1.1 kg sugar, 16.5 g citric acid, 5.5 g KMS, 1.1 g sodium benzoate and 0.275 g nisin) and homogenized in a high speed blender to obtain a homogenous mix. Refer table 1 for product specifications.<br>
Example 2: Salty Sweet corn composition<br>
This working example illustrates the preparation of stabilized salted sweet corn composition. The example follows the same process and additives as in example 1 and the only difference pertain to the use of salt (137.5 g) for 5.5 kg of paste concentrate instead of sugar. Refer table 1 for product specifications.<br>
Table 1: Specifications of sweetened and salty sweet corn composition<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example 3: Plain Sweet corn composition<br>
This working example describes the preparation of plain sweet corn composition without addition of sugar or salt with the same process and additives as described in example 1.<br>
Example 4: Packaging of sweet corn composition<br>
The sweet corn composition thus obtained was packaged in polypropylene pouches (75 µ thickness) as 100 g unit packs and pasteurized in boiling water for 20 min followed by putting the packets in chilled water at 5°C. The surface moisture was removed by wiping with muslin cloth and packaged in secondary paper-aluminium foil-polyethylene (PFP) packaging material (foil thickness 0.02mm). Packaging materials well known in the art can also be used.<br><br>
