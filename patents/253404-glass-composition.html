GLASS COMPOSITION<br>
The present invention relates to a glass composition comprising bismuth oxide,<br>
and silica in combination with other ingredients and application of the same.<br>
This application has been divided out of Indian Patent Application<br>
NO.193/KOLNP/2005.<br>
Background<br>
Two well-known glass fiber manufacturing methods are known as the rotary method and the<br>
flame blown method- Another well-known and widely used method is the Controlled Attenuation<br>
Technology method, which is a modification of the rotary method. Manufacturing glass by these<br>
methods requires heating glass compositions past their melting temperatures into a working<br>
temperature range. Typical glass compositions used in making glass fibers have melting<br>
temperatures of about 2700°F (about 1482°C) and working temperatures (temperature ranges<br>
between glass viscosity 100 and 10000 poise) of about 2600T (about 1427°C). Existing<br>
compositions have relatively narrow working ranges, making the forming of glass fibers of desirable<br>
diameters and lengths difficult because it is difficult to maintain the glass compositions in the<br>
workable range. Additionally, the relatively high melting temperatures require large amounts of<br>
energy to melt the compositions, which can be very costly.<br>
In addition, typical glass compositions used for making glass fibers have liquidus<br>
temperatures of about 1800°F (about 982°C). The liquidus temperature of typical compositions used<br>
for making glass fibers limits the useful life of fiberization equipment due to the high temperatures at<br>
which the equipment must operate. This is especially true when a spinner disc is employed in the<br>
fiberization equipment. A glass composition having a relatively low liquidus temperature also is<br>
useful for reducing or preventing crystallization of the glass during the fiberization process.<br><br>
-3-<br>
about 0.5-30% bismuth oxide of the composition by weight and silica oxide at about<br>
54-70% of the composition by weight Embodiments of the glass compositions may<br>
also include other components. For example zinc oxide can make up about 0.01-5%<br>
of the composition by weight.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
Disclosed.are glass compositions including, among other components,<br>
bismuthand/or bismuth compounds. The disclosed glass compositions are the<br>
compositions of the glass at the molten stage, which composition is the same as that<br>
of resultingglass fibers formed from such glass compositions. The disclosed glass<br>
compositions may vary from example "ingredient lists" for forming such glass<br>
compositions as certain ingredients may change form once melted, becoming a part<br>
of the glass composition. Example glass composition ingredient lists are set forth<br>
below with the discussion of example methods for making particular embodiments<br>
of the disclosed glass compositions.<br>
Embodiments of the disclosed glass compositions may comprise one or more<br>
of the following components within, e.g., ranges set forth in Table 1.<br>
Table 1<br>
Glass Composition Component	Weight Percent<br>
SiO2	54-70wt%<br>
A12O3	l-5wt%<br>
Bi2O3	0.5-30wt%<br>
CaO	3 - 7 wt %<br>
MgO	1 - 5 wt %<br>
B2O3	4 - 9 wt %<br>
K2O	0 - 3 wt %<br>
Na2O	9-20wt%<br>
NiO	0-2 wt%<br>
ZnO	0 - 5 wt %<br>
BaO	0 - 5 wt %<br>
Ag2O	0 - 1 wt %<br>
Li7O	0 - 1 wt %<br>
F2	0 - 1 wt %<br><br>
-4-<br>
Further embodiments of the disclosed glass compositions may comprise one<br>
or more of the following components within, e.g., ranges set forth in Table 2.<br>
Table 2<br><br>
Particular embodiments of the glass compositions may comprise, for<br>
example, the components as set forth in Table 3.<br><br>
-8-<br>
compositions, however, include a certain amount of bismuth, typically in the form of<br>
an oxide, present in an amount of from about 0.5 wt % to about 30 wt % Bi2o3.<br>
Good results have been obtained with a bismuth component present in the<br>
composition at from about 1 wt % to about 15 wt % Bi2O3. It is possible that there<br>
would be negligible amount of reduction of Bi2O3 into metallic form. However,<br>
whatever form of bismuth is used for the glass composition, the raw bismuth<br>
material will turn into bismuth oxide upon melting of the composition.<br>
Alone, Bi2O3 will not form glass. Bismuth oxide may be used as part of a<br>
binary glass composition. For example, bismuth oxide can be added to SiO2 in a<br>
concentration up to about 40 mol %. B12O3 forms glass with several other oxides as<br>
well, for example K2O. Bi2O3 acts in a glass composition in a manner similar to<br>
B2O3, AI2O3, La2O3 or PbO, in that it decreases glass melting temperature, glass<br>
viscosity, and allows fiberization-of the glass at lower temperatures. Bismuth oxide<br>
structural elements are incorporated into the glass matrix and act to strengthen the<br>
resulting glass structure, e.g., glass fibers.<br>
In addition, bismuth oxide acts to decrease the glass softening point and<br>
melting temperatures (as discussed below and shown in Table 8). Addition of about<br>
1% Bi2O3 decreases the softening point by about 2° F. Addition of about 1% Bi2o3<br>
decreases.the melting temperature by about 4° F. The fiberization temperature, i.e.,<br>
. the temperature at which the glass composition viscosity is about 1000 poise is also<br>
decreased in certain embodiments of the glass compositions. Particular glass<br>
composition embodiments exhibit a fiberization temperature of about equal to or<br>
lower than 2000° F (about 1093°C) and certain embodiments exhibit a fiberization<br>
temperature of about equal to or lower than from about 1800 to about 2050° F (from<br>
about 982° C to about 1120° C). Glass composition embodiments having from about<br>
2 to 10 wt% Bi2O3 decrease the-fiberization temperatures of the glass compositions<br>
by about 50 °F to about 100°F (about 10°C to about 38°C).<br>
Glass compositions including the levels of Bi2O3 indicated also improve the<br>
performance of glass fibers formed into hand sheets. Testing of such hand sheets<br>
indicates that certain embodiments of the glass fibers disclosed will produce superior<br>
battery separators or filter media. That is, such applications of the disclosed glass<br><br>
-9-<br>
fibers are relatively easy to manufacture and have the tensile, elongation, basis<br>
weight, water wicking characteristics and other basic characteristics similar to or<br>
better than what is presently available with commercial fibers (such as EF M-glass<br>
illustrated in Tables 6 and 7 or JM 253 glass (available from, e.g., Johns Manville<br>
Corporation and. illustrated in Table 6)). Accordingly, certain embodiments of the<br>
disclosed glass compositions do not compromise major media physical<br>
characteristics needed of glass fibers formed thereof but instead additionally provide<br>
enhanced performance due to particular enhanced or new glass properties, e.g., Bi<br>
ion leaching that decreases off gassing in battery applications.<br>
Further, particular embodiments-of the disclosed bismuth-containing glass<br>
compositions have increased devitrification resistance so-that they do not become<br>
crystalline during the fiberization process. Glass compositions having Bi2O3 in the<br>
disclosed ranges showed higher resistance to devitrification (see Table 7). Modified<br>
borosilicate glass, i.e., labeled as M-glass in the Table 7 is a man-made vitreous<br>
fiber as published by the Nomenclature Committee of TMA Inc. 91,93,<br>
incorporated herein by reference. This glass composition was used as a reference to<br>
determine effects of additions of B12O3 and ZnO to a glass composition. The M-<br>
glass batch-(inixture of all raw materials) was formed and then divided into three<br>
parts. A first glass composition labeled "M glass" as shown in Table 7 was formed.<br>
A second glass composition was formed by adding further components including<br>
about 2 wt% ZnO and about 2 wt% B12O3 and a third glass composition was formed<br>
by adding about 10 wt% B12O3, thereby forming two particular embodiments of the<br>
disclosed glass compositions.<br>
Bismuth ions in glass fibers formed from the disclosed glass compositions<br>
- will also act to improve battery performance and increase battery life (as discussed<br>
below). The amount of bismuth desirable in the glass compositions is calculated so<br>
that leaching does not compromise the structural integrity of the resulting glass<br>
fibers over time. In particular applications it is desirable to have some bismuth ions<br>
(or other ions as discussed) leach into solution but the leaching should not lead to<br>
full fiber dissolution during, for example, battery operation. Glass fibers formed<br>
.from glass compositions having from about 0.5 to about 30% bismuth oxide provide<br><br>
-10-<br>
sufficient bismuth ion leaching such that the leaching does not compromise the<br>
structural integrity of the resulting glass fibers over time but sufficient ions are<br>
leached to limit or prevent hydrogen gassing in batteries. Glass fibers formed from<br>
alternative embodiments of the glass compositions including from about 1 to about<br>
15% bismuth oxide also provide sufficient bismuth ion leaching such that the<br>
leaching does not compromise the structural integrity of the resulting glass fibers<br>
over time but sufficient ions are leached to limit or prevent hydrogen gassing. This is<br>
especially true in valve regulated (sealed) lead acid batteries. Hydrogen gassing<br>
causes water loss, which shortens battery life and reduces performance.<br>
The addition of Bi2O3 as indicated as well as from about 1 to about 4 wt%<br>
ZnO also minimizes hydrogen gassing of VRLA batteries under float duty. Float<br>
duty is the low-rate charge used to maintain a battery in a fully charged condition in<br>
a standby application, as is known to those persons skilled in the art. ZnO in the<br>
glass compositions and resulting glass fibers formed therefrom also significantly<br>
improves water and acid durability of the glass fibers, significant for various glass<br>
fiber applications such as battery and filter uses.<br>
Some embodiments of the glass compositions and glass fibers may include<br>
NiO or other suitable Ni ion sources. For battery applications, Ni ions increase the<br>
charge acceptance of a negative plate of lead acid batteries. On the other hand Ni<br>
may increase gassing. This negative effect may be. suppressed by addition of Bi, Zn<br>
and Ag ions to the glass compositions.<br>
Typically silica is the main glass component. Silica forms a stable, durable<br>
glass lattice and provides, particular structural properties to the glass composition. In<br>
particular embodiments of the disclosed glass compositions SiOa is present at a<br>
weight % of from about 54% to about 70%.  Tn other embodiments of the disclosed<br>
glass compositions SiO2 is present at a weight % of from about 56% to about 69%<br>
and yet in other embodiments of the disclosed glass compositions SiO2 is present at<br>
a weight % of from about 62% to about 70%.<br>
None of the other glass formers (P2O5, B2O3) can provide with sufficiently<br>
durable (and cheap) glass. That is, theoretically these oxides can substitute silica,<br><br>
-11-<br>
but they are expensive and glass compositions formed thereof will likely be less<br>
durable - not sufficiently withstanding humid or acidic environments.<br>
Alumina in a glass composition affects the glass water and acid durability.<br>
Thus, alumina may improve an embodiment of the disclosed glass fiber's<br>
performance in a humid atmosphere when used, for example, in filter applications.<br>
On the other hand, axelatively high alumina content can significantly decrease the<br>
Kdis (biological dissolution coefficient) of the glass fiber; making the glass less bio-<br>
degradable. A useful alumina concentration may be from about 2% to about 4%.<br>
Calcium oxide (CaO) and magnesium oxide (MgO) may be present in<br>
particular glass composition embodiments to further stabilize the glass network and<br>
provide the glass with particular advantageous structural properties. CaO acts to<br>
decrease the viscosity of the glass composition and MgO acts to further slow the<br>
crystallization rate. CaO and MgO increase glass fiber biological solubility.<br>
Particular embodiments of the disclosed glass compositions include these oxides in<br>
the advantageous ratio, CaO to MgO, of about 3:2 (i.e., a molar ratio of about 1:1).<br>
Other particular embodiments include the oxides in the following amounts: CaO at<br>
from about 3 wt % to about 6 wt % and MgO at from about 2 wt % to about 4 wt %.<br>
Certain embodiments of the glass compositions include sodium oxide (Na20)<br>
and/or potassium oxide (K2O). These particular oxides may be present to aid in the<br>
decrease glass melting temperature, glass viscosity, and, respectively, to allow<br>
fiberization of the glass at lower temperatures. Addition of Na20 and K2O to some<br>
extent may aid in increases the glass durability hi acids. On the other hand, both<br>
oxides may act to increase glass water and biological solubility. Embodiments of<br>
the glass compositions including both oxides may provide further advantages due to '<br>
the polyalkali effect (synergistic effect). Addition of K2O may also aid in the<br>
decrease of a glass composition's propensity to the crystallization.<br>
Certain embodiments of the glass compositions-include boron oxide (B9O3)<br>
to aid in the lowering of glass melting temperature, aid in the reduction of glass<br>
viscosity, and to enhance resulting glass fiber elasticity. In addition, boron oxide<br>
may be included in the glass composition to significantly increase glass fiber<br>
biosolubility without deterioration of glass durability in water and hi acid. Particular<br><br>
-12-<br>
embodiments of the glass compositions include from about 4 wt % to about 7 wt %<br>
boron oxide.   Certain embodiments of the glass compositions include barium oxide<br>
(BaO) to aid in the moisture resistance of resulting glass fibers and may have a<br>
positive affect on biological degradability of the resulting glass fibers.<br>
Certain embodiments of the glass compositions include fluorine (F2) and<br>
lithium oxide (LizO) in relatively small amounts (for example, less that about 1 wt<br>
%) to aid in the decrease of the glass melting temperature, to improve melt fining,<br>
and to aid in the lowering of the glass viscosity. Typically Li2O is present only as an<br>
impurity. Certain embodiments of the glass compositions include iron oxide in trace<br>
quantities since it is also normally introduced as an impurity in the SiO2, A12O3,<br>
CaO, and/or MgO batch materials. A typical content of iron in a glass composition<br>
is from about 0.05 wt % to about 0.1 wt %. Other typical impurities include SrO,<br>
and/or MnO. Glass composition embodiments may include such oxides in amounts<br>
less than about 0.1 wt %. In general, the disclosed glass compositions include less<br>
than about 0.05 wt% TiO2 (from the total amount of glass) and CoO less than<br>
0.01wt%. Both CoO and TiO2 have negative influence on battery operations. If<br>
glass fibers (or a glass composition) have a blue tint, it is typically due to Co<br>
leaching from the rotary disc and in such cases the resulting glass fibers /products<br>
are typically rejected. In general, the disclosed.glass compositions include less than<br>
about 0.05% Z1O2. Although glass compositions may include as much as 0.3-0.4<br>
wt%. ZrO2, that particular component does not appear to have a negative impact on<br>
battery operations, but it does drastically change glass-properties and thus most of<br>
the disclosed glass compositions include less than about 0.1 wt% ZrO2-<br>
One or more of the above-listed glass composition ingredients may have<br>
suitable substitutions as known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Alternative<br>
compounds and oxides may include for example, rubidium oxide as a substitute for<br>
K2O. Another example may be the partial substitution of CaO with SrO or partial<br>
substitution of A12O3 with La2O3.<br>
The glass compositions as disclosed herein may be made by methods known<br>
to those persons of ordinary skill in the art. For example, an embodiment of the<br>
glass compositions disclosed herein may be prepared using chemical reagent-grade<br><br>
-13-<br>
materials such as those listed in the tables above. The ingredients to form the<br>
desired glass compositions may be, e.g., added to a clay crucible and melted at about<br>
1350°C or lower depending upon the exact glass composition being formed, with<br>
about a one hour dwell time at maximal temperatures. The melted glass<br>
composition may then be poured into steel molds in the shape of disks. Glass discs<br>
may then be annealed at about 600°C and then cooled to room temperature.<br>
As discussed above, embodiments of the glass compositions disclosed have<br>
surprisingly relatively low softening points. Particular embodiments of the glass<br>
compositions have softening points of from about 1230°F to about 1256°F (from<br>
about 665.6°C to about680°C). The softening point is the temperature at which the<br>
viscosity of a glass composition is 10 in power 7.6 poises (r; =log 7.6). Particular<br>
embodiments of the glass compositions have glass softening points as shown in<br>
Table 7. As shown, an embodiment of the disclosed glass compositions having<br>
about 10 wt% Bi2O3 decreases the softening point of the glass to about 1267° F (see,<br>
e.g., Table 7, Composition 7). Softening points of the disclosed glass compositions<br>
are lowerthanthe commercially available glass compositions as illustrated in Table<br>
7 wherein examples of existing glass compositions labeled "M-glass" and "JM 253"<br>
have typical conventional glass composition softening points, with M-glass having a<br>
softening point at about 1300°F (704°C) and JM 253 at about 1235°F (668°C).<br>
Because particular embodiments of the presently disclosed glass<br>
compositions have lower softening points, the disclosed glass compositions melt<br>
faster and require less energy to be melted and-fiberized. Lower melting and<br>
 fiberization temperatures promise savings in equipment due to lower wear of parts<br>
  contacting melted glass and lower energy costs. Glass softening points were<br>
determined by the Littleton method (per ASTM C-388, incorporated herein by<br>
reference).<br>
Glass powder having a particle size in the range of from about 297 to about<br>
590 Ltm (i.e., a particle fraction between mesh screen 30 and 50) was utilized to test<br>
certain of the glass compositions' properties. Because the process of making and<br>
testing glass microfibers is a long and expensive, before glass is fiberized. For<br>
screenings, the powder technique was used. Small amounts(e.g., about 1 pound) of<br><br>
-14-<br>
particular glass compositions were melted and then cooled and crushed into a<br>
powder. Thus, there was a significant increase in the glass surface area. The testing<br>
included glass composition powders having particle sizes within a predetermined<br>
range. This method allows prediction of the fiber durability in different<br>
environments and solutions, namely acidic, neutral water, basic and in simulated<br>
lung fluid, eliminating time consuming and costly experimental glass fiberization<br>
processes.<br>

Certain embodiments of the glass compositions disclosed herein provide for<br>
lower fiberization temperatures. In general, the fiberization temperatures of the<br>
disclosed glass compositions are from about 1800 °F to about 2050°F (about 982°C<br>
to about 1120°C) or about 100°F (37.8°C) lower than commercially available glass<br>
compositions.<br>
Certain embodiments of the glass compositions disclosed herein provide<br>
relatively very low crystallization rates, an important technological property for<br>
glass fiberization. The crystallization rate is the speed of glass devitrification at<br>
specific temperatures or temperature ranges. Crystallization rates of particular<br>
embodiments of the glass compositions disclosed were evaluated by holding glass<br>
powder in a furnace at the following temperatures (in °C) for about two hour dwell<br>
periods: 1000,950,900,875,850,825, 800, and 700. Results are shown in Table 7.<br><br>
-15-<br>
As shown nrTabLe particulare embadiments-of the disclosed glass<br>
compositions have surprisingly superior water durability as compared with<br>
commercially available glass compositions. For example, see Table 6 wherein<br>
representative commercially available glass compositions "M-glass" and "JM 253"<br>
glass have much lower durability in water as compared to disclosed compositions<br>
- nos.2-5.: In additions disclosed glass composition no. 2 has surprisingly superior<br>
tensile strength for 0.8 fan and 1.4 fan fibers, respectively, 4.3 and. 3.3 pounds/inch<br>
when, formed in hand sheets. <br>
Also disclosed herein are glass fibers formed of the disclosed glass<br>
compositions. The glass compositions disclosed maybe formed into, e.g., glass<br>
fibers using conventional methods and equipment For example, the glass<br>
compositions may be fiberized by rotary, Controlled Attenuation Technology, and/or flame blown processes-<br>
Glass fibers as disclosed herein may be formed from any of the multitude of<br>
embodiments of the disclosed glassxompositions- Embodiments of the disclosed<br>
glass fibers have many potential applications. They may be used, for example, in<br>
various-manners- andiocationsTir batteries; to form filters-designed for air and/or<br>
liquid filtration, and as insulation material, (e.g., electrical and/or thermal<br>
insulation). The desired glass fiber composition and size is determined based on the<br>
intended-use for the glass fibers, as woufclbe known, to a person of ordinary skill in<br>
the art- For example, to obtain: glass fibers useful in both filter and battery<br>
applications disclosed:glass compositiorr-2 (see.Table 3)-may be formed into about<br>
O.Sptmand.1.4 /xrn glass fibers<br>
Embodiments of the disclosed glass fibers typically exhibit a variety of<br>
advantageous properties: Such disclosed-glass-fibers have superior wafer and acid<br>
durability as indicated in Table 6 and superior tensile strength (hand sheets formed<br>
   of such fibers showed tensile strength, of about 4.3 and 3.3 pounds/inch,<br>
 respoctiveIy):_._.Such. characteristics-make these disclosed glass fibers suitable both<br>
 ibrbaitery separators andrfiltratiorrmedia...Certain embodiments also have relatively<br>
low biopersistaace^meaning that inhaled fibers wiU dissolve and be eliminated more<br>
readily in the lungs: The biopersistance factor/ as knowrr to those skilled in the art,<br>
is measured  by the Kdis ofthe glass fibers in simulated lung fluid. Certain<br><br>
PCT/US2003/023695<br>
-16-<br>
embodiments of the glass fibers achieve a Kdis of less than about 150 ng/cm2h and<br>
other embodiments may exhibit Kdis values in the range of from about 50 to about<br>
150 ng/cm2 h.<br>
Glass biosolubility has been tested on glass particles of size 75-106 urn made<br>
from disclosed glass composition embodiments 6 and 7 in Table 3. The particles<br>
passed through sieve 140 and remained on the sieve 200 were stored in vials with<br>
simulated lung fluid (SLF) for about 96 hours at about 37°C in a shaker. The<br>
dissolution rate was again determined based on the leachate analysis performed with<br>
an ICP. Leaching rates were compared based on the levels of the leached ions in<br>
solution. Results are shown in Table 9. An embodiment of the glass composition<br>
having 10 wt% Bi2O3 doubled the glass biodissolution rate in simulated lung fluid.<br>
This indicates that a glass composition having Bi2O3 provides an increase in<br>
biosolubility without compromising other desirable properties of the glass<br>
composition.<br>
Further, certain embodiments of the disclosed glass fibers including the<br>
levels of B12O3 indicated may also improve the performance of glass fibers formed<br>
therefrom because longer fibers can be produced. Certain embodiments of the glass<br>
fibers also show a significantly increased density as compared to equivalent glass<br>
fibers currently available. Accordingly, certain glass fiber products, such as glass<br>
fibers used in battery separators provide higher porosity rates in the separator<br>
because for the separator to have the same weight of glass fibers, less glass fibers are<br>
needed. The same would hold true for other glass fiber products such as filtration<br>
and insulation products where the weight of the fibers versus the amount of fibers<br>
needed is of concern. For example, certain embodiments of the disclosed glass<br>
fibers have density values from about 2.5 to about 2.8 g/cm3 as shown in Table 7.<br><br>
-17-<br>

5	2.8039	1249-	Slight surface crystallization-<br>

Glass fiber embodiments having such density values means that hand sheets<br>
made from the same size glass fibers formed from the disclosed glass compositions<br>
having varying bismuth oxide concentrations will exhibit different specific surface<br>
areas and different air resistant values. For example, density values of from about<br>
2.50 to about 2.85 are obtainable with certain embodiments of the presently<br>
disclosed glass fibers when bismuth oxide concentrations of the glass fibers are from<br>
about 1 to about 15 wt%. Density values were obtained by use of a Micromeritics<br>
   AccuPyc 133 0 picnometer according to the method set forth in the Micromeritics<br>
manual.<br>
Embodiments of the glass fibers disclosed herein have specific surface areas<br>
(SSAs).   Relatively low SSAs of certain glass fiber embodiments are important for<br>
glass, fiber -dnrabilityconsiderations. The larger SSA fibers' value, the smaller the<br>
fiber diameter. Different applications require glass fibers of different diameters and<br>
respectively different SSA values. SSA and fiber diameter values are inversely<br>
dependent The larger the SSA the smaller the diameter of the fiber and the stronger<br>
the fibers when subjected to ambient atmosphere attack (e.g., humidity, acid, etc.).<br>
SSA values are especially important for glass fiber products having glass fibers of<br>
relatively large specific surface areas as larger surface areas can detrimentally affect<br>
the product. For example, ion leaching-is a glass fiber surface phenomenon. The<br>
amount of ions lost from a glass fiber is proportional to the exposed surface area.<br>
Surface area considerations are typically greatest for glass fibers having diameters of<br>
less than about 5-7 um but the SSA values of larger or smaller diameter glass fibers<br>
is also of importance. Certain embodiments of the disclosed glass fibers have SSA<br><br>
-18-<br>
values of from about 1.1 to about 1.2 g/m3 for aboutl.4 um diameter fibers and 1.95<br>
to about 2.0 g/m3 for about 0.8 um diameter fibers.<br>
SSA values of certain embodiments of the disclosed glass fibers were<br>
determined as set forth in EFCTM 157: Specific Surface Area Analysis using Argon,<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference. The apparatus used was a Micromeritics<br>
2375 BET SSA analyzer.<br>
As mentioned above, leaching of ions from glass fibers in various glass fiber<br>
products can be advantageous or detrimental to the product. For example, with glass<br>
fiber filter products leaching would be detrimental for a variety of reasons, such as<br>
disintegration of the fibers.   Leaching of the glass fibers has a direct affect on the<br>
durability of the fibers. In addition to the affect of leaching on the durability<br>
requirements of glass fibers, other considerations depend on the applications for<br>
which glass fibers are used. For example, glass fibers used in battery separators<br>
preferably have low levels of leaching of certain metal oxide impurities (e.g.,<br>
platinum oxide, iron oxide) that can have a detrimental effect on the life of the<br>
battery. On the other hand, certain ions (e.g., Bi, Ag, Ni, Cd, Ge, Sn, Zn) have<br>
positive effects on battery performance (as discussed above), so leaching of these<br>
ions may be beneficial. As discussed, these ions can reduce gassing, water loss and<br>
improve charge acceptance by a battery's negative plate.<br>
The durability of glass fibers is typically determined by the leaching rate of<br>
the glass fibers in acid, neutral and alkaline conditions. Particular embodiments of<br>
the disclosed glass compositions in powder form were tested for leach rates in acidic<br>
environments. Leaching rates in acid were determined by analyzing leachates<br>
obtained by boiling 2.5 grams of glass fibers in 100 gmsIH2SO4 having a specific<br>
gravity of 1.26 g/cm3 for three hours. DI water (up to 250 ml) was added to the<br>
leachate. (See 8.2 ASTM 165, which is incorporated herein by reference.) Samples<br>
of the resulting solution were subjected to inductively coupled plasma atomic<br>
emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) model Perkin Elmer Optima 4300 DV to<br>
determine the amount of each element present in the leachate. Final leach rate<br>
results are shown in Tables 6,8, and 10. The leach rates shown are averages of<br>
three sample tests per composition tested.<br><br>

The acid leaching test showed that the glass composition embodiments tested<br>
have leaching rate within the range of current commercial glass fibers "408" made<br>
from "M-glass" glass (available from Evanite Fiber Corporation of Corvallis,<br>
Oregon) and glass, fibers "206" made from "253" glass (available from Johns<br>
Manville Company of Denver, Colorado). Leach rates of the embodiments of the<br>
disclosed glass compositions tested are closer to the Johns Manville glass fibers<br>
made out of "253 glass." All of the tested glass composition embodiments have<br>
approximately the same acid resistance with a slightly higher value shown for<br>
composition numbers 2,4 and 5 - the glass composition embodiments with ZnO and<br>
the glass compositions with the highest Bi2O3 concentration.<br>

fibers' moisture and water resistance values (See 8.2.TM. 166 incorporated herein<br>

As mentioned above, the disclosed glass compositions and fibers can be used<br>
in many applications. In particular cases, the glass fibers are used in battery<br>
separators. Battery separators may be used in various batteries, such as lead-acid<br>
batteries. Lead acid batteries include a plurality of electrode plates. The plates are<br><br>
-24-<br>
arranged to establish alternating positive and negative electrodes. A battery<br>
separator may be disposed between each pair of electrodes. The separators may be<br>
formed of insulating material and are used, in part, to prevent metallic deposits in<br>
the battery from forming short circuits between the electrode plates. The separator<br>
is porous, however, to the battery electrolyte so that current can pass from one plate<br>
to another. Particular examples of battery separators and methods of making and<br>
using them are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,180,647; 5,091,275; 4,237,083;<br>
4,113,927; 3,989,579; 3,845,737; and 3,450,571, which are all incorporated by<br>
reference herein.<br>
In examples of battery separators comprising the disclosed glass<br>
compositions, glass fibers made from the disclosed glass compositions are used to<br>
form the battery separator. The glass fibers may be used to form what is commonly<br>
known as an absorptive glass mat separator, which typically is comprised of glass<br>
fibers of varying length and diameter. In other cases the battery separator comprises<br>
a mat formed of the disclosed glass fibers that is impregnated with a binder that is an<br>
aqueous mixture of colloidal silica particles and a sulfate salt as described in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,091,275 (the '275 patent). As explained in the '275 patent, the<br>
separator can be made by forming the glass mat on a conventional paper making<br>
machine (such as a Fourdrinier machine) and then exposing the mat to the binder in<br>
an impregnating bath of an aqueous mixture of the binder, followed by drying of the<br>
mat and compression to the desired separator thickness.<br>
Whereas the disclosed glass compositions, glass fibers and applications for<br>
the same have been described with reference to multiple embodiments and<br>
examples, it will be understood that the invention is not limited to those<br>
embodiments and examples. On the contrary, the invention is intended to<br>
encompass all modifications, alternatives, and equivalents as may be included within<br>
the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims and as<br>
disclosed in the specification.<br><br>
