Prior to discussing the present invention In further details, the following terms and conventions will first be defined:<br>
Substantially pure polypeptide: In the present context, the term "substantially pure polypeptide" means a polypeptide preparation which contains at the most 10% by weight of other polypeptide material with which it is natively associated (lower percentages of other polypeptide material are preferred, e.g. at the most 8% by weight, at the most 6% by weight, at the most 5% by weight, at the most 4% at the most 3% by weight, at the most 2% by weight, at the most 1 % by weight, and at the most 14% by weight).

Herein, the term "substantially pure polypeptide" is synonymous with the terms "isolated polypeptide" and "polypeptide in isolated form".<br>
Antimicrobial activity The tern 'antimicrobial activity" is defined herein as an activity<br><br>
which is capable of killing or inhibiting growth of microbial cells. In the context of the present invention the term "antimicrobial" is intended to mean that there is a bactericidal and/or a bacteriostatic and/or fungicidal and/or fungistatic effect and/or a virucidal effect, wherein the term "bactericidal" is to be understood as capable of killing bacterial cells. The term "bacteriostatic" is to be understood as capable of inhibiting bacterial growth, i.e. inhibiting growing bacterial cells. The term "fungicidal" is to be understood as capable of killing fungal cells. The term "fungistatic" is to be understood as capable of inhibiting fungal growth, i.e. inhibiting growing fungal cells. The term "virucidal" is to be understood as capable of inactivating virus. The term "microbial ceils" denotes bacterial or fungal cells (including yeasts).<br>
In the context of the present invention the term "inhibiting gravity of microbial cells" is intended to mean that the cells are in the non-growing state, i.e., that they are not able to propagate.<br>
For purposes of the present invention, antimicrobial activity may be determined according to the procedure described by Lehrer et al., Journal of Immunological Methods, Vol. 137(2) pp. 167-174 (1991).<br>

Identity: In the present context, the homology between two amino acid sequences or :)between two nucleotide sequences is described by the parameter "identity".<br>
For purposes of the present invention, the degree of identity between two amino acid sequences is determined by using the program FASTA included in version 2-Ox of the PASTA )program package (see W. R, Pearson and D, J. Lipman (1988), "Improved Tools for Biological Sequence Analysis", PNAS 85:2444-2448; and W R. Pearson (1990) "Rapid and Sensitive Sequence Comparison with FASTP and FASTA", Methods in Enzymology 183.63-98). The coring matrix used was BLOSUIV150, gap penalty was -12, and gap extension penalty was -2, The degree of identity between two nucleotide sequences is determined using the ame algonthm and software package as described above. The sconng matrix used was the Jentity matrix, gap penalty was -16, and gap extension penalty was -4.<br>
Frogmen- When used herein, a "fragment" of SEQ ID N0:2 is a polypeptide having or more amino acids deleted for; the amino and/or carboxyl terminus of this amino acid equence.<br>
Allelic variant: In the present context, the term "allelic variant' denotes any of two or lore alternative forms of a gene occupying the same chromosomal locus. Allelic variation rises naturally through mutation, and may result in polymorphism within populations. Gene legations can be silent (no change in the encoded polypeptide) or may encode polypeptides aging altered amino add sequences. An allelic variant of a polypeptide is a polypeptide needed by an allelic variant of a gene.<br>
Substantially pure polynucleotide' the term "substantially pure polynucleotide" as used 3rein refers to a polynucleotide preparation, wherein the polynucleotide has been removed Dm its natural genetic milieu, and is thus free of other extraneous or unwanted coding ;quenches and is in a form suitable foci- use within genetically engineered protein production 'Stems   Thus, a substantially pure piguclectide contains at the mos: '0°/: by v/eight of<br><br>
other polynucleotide material) with which it is natively associated (lower percentages of other polynucleotide material are preferred, e.g. at the most B% by weight, at the most 6% by weight, at the most 5% by weight, at the most 4% at the most 3% by weight, at the most 2% by weight, at the most 1% by weight, and at the most 1/2% by weight). A substantially pure polynucleotide may, however, include naturally occurring 5' and 3' untranslated regions, such as promoters and terminators. It is preferred that the substantially pure polynucleotide is at least 92% pure, i.e. that the polynucleotide constitutes at least 92% by weight of the total polynucleotide material present in the preparation, and higher percentages are preferred such as at least S4% pure, at least 95% pure, at least 96% pure, at least 96% pure, at least 97% pure, at least 98% pure, at least 99%, and at the most 99.5% pure. The polynucleotides disclosed herein are preferably in a substantially pure form. In particular, it is preferred that the polynucleotides disclosed herein are in "essentially pure form", i.e. that the polynucleotide preparation is essentially free of other polynucleotide material with which it is natively associated. Herein, the term "substantially pure polynucleotide" is synonymous with the terms "isolated polynucleotide" and "polynucleotide in isolated form",<br>
Modification(s): In the context of the present invention the term "modification(£)' is intended to mean any chemical modification of the polypeptide consisting of the amino acid sequence shown as amino acids 1 to 40 of S£Q iD N0.2 as well as genetic manipulation of the DMA encoding that polypeptide. The mortification(5) can be replacement(s) of the amino acid side chain(s), substitution(s), deletion(s) and/or insertions(s) in or at the amino acid(s) of interest.<br>
Artificial variant: When used herein, the term "artificial variant" means a polypeptide having antimicrobial activity, which has been produced by an organism which is expressing a modified gene as compared to SEO ID N0:1. The modified gene, from which said variant is produced when expressed in a suitable host, is obtained through human intervention by modification of the nucleotide sequence disclosed in SEQ ID N0:1,<br>
cDNA: The term "cDNA" when used in the present context, is intended to cover a DNA molecule which can be prepared by reverse transcription from a mature, spliced, mRNA molecule derived from a eukaryotic cell. cDNA lacks the intron sequences that are usually present in the corresponding genomic DNA. The initial, primary RNA transcript is a precursor to mRNA and it goes through a series of processing events before appearing as mature spliced mRNA These events include the removal of intron sequences by a process called splicing. When cDNA is derived from mRNA it therefore lacks intron sequences.<br>
Nucleic acid construct: When used herein, the term "nucleic acid construct" means a nucleic acid molecule, either single- or double-stranded, which is isolated from a naturally occurring gene or which has been modified to contain segments of n'jcteic acids in a manner<br><br>
that would not otherwise exist in nature. The term nucleic acid construct is synonymous with the term "expression cassette" when the nucleic acid construct contains the control sequences required for expression of a coding sequence of the present invention.<br>
Control Sequence' The term "control sequences" is defined herein to include all components, which are necessary or advantageous for the expression of a polypeptide of the present invention. Each control sequence may be native or foreign to the nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide. Such control sequences include, but are not limited to, a leader, polyadenyiation sequence, propeptide sequence, promoter, signal peptide sequence, and transnational terminator. At a minimum, the control sequences include a promoter, and transcriptional and translational stop signals. The control sequences may be provided with linkers for the purpose of introducing specific restriction sites facilitating legation of the control sequences with the coding region of the nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide.<br>
Operably linked' The term "operably linked" is defined herein as a configuration in which a control sequence is appropriately placed at a position relative to the coding sequence of the DNA sequence such that the control sequence directs the expression of a polypeptide.<br>
Coding sequence: When used herein the term "coding sequence" is intended to cover a nucleotide sequence, which directly specifies the amino acid sequence of its protein product. The boundaries of the coding sequence are generally determined by an open reading frame, which usually begins with the ATG start codon. The coding sequence typically include DNA, cDNA, and recombinant nucleotide sequences.<br>
Expression: In the present context, the term "expression" includes any step involved in the production of the polypeptide including, but not limited to, transnational, post-transcriptional modification, translation, post-translational modification, and secretion.<br>
Expression vector: In the present context, the term "expression vector" covers a DNA molecule, linear or circular, that comprises a segment encoding a polypeptide of the invention, and which is operably linked to additional segments that provide for its transcription.<br>
l-lost cell: The term "host ceil", as used herein, includes any cell type which is susceptible to transformation with a nucleic acid construct.<br>
The terms "polynucleotide probe", "hybridization" as well as the various stringency conditions are defined in the section entitled "Polypeptides Having Antimicrobial Activity".<br>

The nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 or a subsequence thereof, as well as the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID N0:2 or a fragment thereof, may be used to design a polynucleotide probe to identify and clone DNA encoding polypeptides having antimicrobial activity from strains of different genera or species according to methods well known in the art, n particular, such probes can be used for hybridization with the genomic or cDNA of the lenus or species of interest, following standard Southern blotting procedures, in order to Justify and isolate the corresponding gene therein. Such probes can be considerably shorter lank the entire sequence, but should be at least 15, preferably at least 25, more preferably a: ;2St 35 nucleotides  in  length   such  £S  at least 70 nucleotides in  length   It  is,  however-<br><br>

For example, the polynucleotide probe may be at least 200 nucleotides in length, at least 300 nucleotides in length, at least 400 nucleotides in length or at least 500 nucleotides in length. Even longer probes may be used, e.g., polynucleotide probes which are at least 600 nucleotides in length, at least 700 nucleotides in length, at least 800 nucleotides in length, or at least 900 nucleotides in length. Both DNA and RNA probes can be used. The probes are typically labeled for deflecting the corresponding gene (for example, with ^^P, ^H, ^'S, biotin, or avidin).<br>
Thus, a genomic DNA or cDNA library prepared from such other organisms may be screened for DNA which hybridizes with the probes described above and which encodes a polypeptide having antimicrobial activity. Genomic or other DNA from such other organisms may be separated by agar’s or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, or other separation techniques. DNA from the libraries or the separated DNA may be transferred to, and immobilized, on nitrocellulose or other suitable carrier materials. In order to identify a clone or DNA which is homologous with SEQ ID N0:1 the carrier material with the immobilized DNA is used in a Southern blot.<br>

In still another trusting embodiment, the polynucleotide probe is the complimenting/ strand of the mature it microbial polypeptide encoding region present in Pseudoptectan/a Nigerian CBS 444.97.<br>
For long probes of at least 100 nucleotides in length, very low to very high stringency editions are defined as prehybridization and hybridization at 42°C in 5X SSP£, 1.0% SDS, ; Denhardl's  solution   100  ug/ml  sheared and  denatured salmon sperri  DNA, following<br><br>
standard Southern blotting procedures. Preferably, the long probes of at least 100 nucleotides do not contain more than 1000 nucleotides. For long probes of al least 100 nucleotides in length, the carrier material is finally washed three times each for 15 minutes using 2 x SSC, 0,1% SDS at 42X (very low stringency), preferably washed three times each for 15 minutes using 0.5 x.

Although not particularly preferred, it is contemplated that shorter probes, e.g probes which are from about 15 to 99 nucleotides in length, such as from about 15 to about 70 nucleotides in length, may be also be used. For such short probes, stringency conditions are defined as prehybridization, hybridization, and washing post-hybridizations at 5°C to 10°C below the calculated T^ using the calculation according to Bolton and McCarthy (1962, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 48-.1390} in 0.9 M NaCI, 0.09 M Tris-HCI pH 7,6, 6 rnM EDTA, 0,5% NP-40, IX Denhardt's solution. 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium monobasic phosphate, 0,1 mM ATP, and 0.2 mg of yeast RNA per ml following<br>

The cloning of the nucleotide sequences of the present invention from such genomic DNA can be effected, eg., by using the well known polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antibody screening of expression libraries to detect cloned DNA fragments with shared structural features. See, e.g.. innis et a!., 1990, PCR: A Guide to Methods and Application, Academic Press, New York. Other amplification procedures such as ligase chain reaction (LCR), mitigated activated transcription (LAT) and nucleotide sequence-based amplification (NASBA) may be used. The nucleotide sequence may be cloned from a strain of antimicrobial polypeptide encoding nucleotide sequence present in Pseudoplsctania. or another or related organism and thus, for example, may be an allelic or species variant of the polypeptide encoding region of the nucleotide sequence.<br>
The nucleotide sequence may be obtained by standard cloning procedures used in genetic engineering to relocate the nucleotide sequence from its natural location to a different site where it will be reproduced. The cloning procedures may involve excision and isolation of a desired fragment comprising the nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide, insertion of<br><br>
the fragment into a vector molecule, and incorporation of the recombinant vector into a host cell where multiple copies or clones of the nucleotide sequence will be replicated. The nucleotide sequence may be of genomic, cDNA, RNA, semi synthetic, synthetic origin, or any combinations thereof.<br>

Modification of a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of the present invention may be necessary for the synthesis of a polypeptide, which comprises an amino acic sequence that has at least one substitution, deletion and/or insertion as compared to amine acids 1 to 40 of SEQ iD N0;2. These artificial vahants may differ in some engineered way from the polypeptide isolated from its native source, e.g., variants that differ in specific activity, thermostability, pH optimum, or the like.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the ark. that such modifications.  <br>
outside the regions critical to the function of the molecule and still result in an active polypeptide. Amino acid residues essential to the activity of the polypeptide encoded by tl^e nucleotide sequence of the invention, and therefore preferably not subject to modification, such as substitution, may be identified according to procedures known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis or calamine-scanning mutagenesis (see, e.g., Cunningham and Wells, 1989, Science 244: 1081-1085). in the latter technique, mutations are introduced at every positively charged residue in the molecule, and the resultant mutant molecules are tested for antimicrobial activity to identify amino acid residues that are critical to the activity of the molecule. Sites of substrate-enzyme interaction can also be determined by analysis of the three-dimensional structure as determined by such techniques as nuclear magnetic resonance analysis, crystallography or photo affinity labeling (see, e.g., de Vos et al.. 1992, Science 255: 306-312; Smith etal.. 1992, Journal of Molecular Biology 224: 899-904; Woodier e( a/., 1992, FE8S Letters 309: 59-64).<br>
Moreover, a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of the present invention may be modified by introduction of nucleotide substitutions which do not give rise to another amino acid sequence of the polypeptide encoded by the nucleotide sequence, but which correspond to the codon usage of the host organism intended for production of the enzyme.<br>
The introduction of a mutation into the nucleotide sequence to exchange one nucleotide for another nucleotide may be accomplished by site-directed mutagenesis using any of the methods known in the art. Particularly useful is the procedure, which utilizes a super coiled, double stranded DNA vector with an insert of interest and two synthetic primers containing the desired mutation. The oligonucleotide primers, each complementary to opposite strands of the vector, extend during temperature cycling by means of Pfu DNA polymerase. On incorporation of the primers, a mutated plasmid containing staggered nicks is generated. Following temperature cycling, the product is treated with Opnl which is specific for ethylated and hemimethylated DNA to digest the parental DNA template and to select for mutation-containing synthesized DNA. Other procedures known in the art may also be used. For a general description of nucleotide substitution, see. e.g.. Ford ef al., 1991, Protein Expression and Purification 2: 95-107.<br>

Useful polyadenylation sequences for yeast host cells are described by Guo and Sherman, 1695, Molecular Cellular Biology ^5. 5983-5990.<br>
The control sequence may also be a signal peptide coding region that codes for an amino acid sequence linked to the amino terminus of a polypeptide and directs the encoded polypeptide into the cell's secretory pathway. The 5' end of the coding sequence of the nucleotide sequence may inherently contain a signal peptide coding region naturally linked in translation reading frame with the segment of the coding region which encodes the secreted polypeptide. Alternatively, the 5' end of the coding sequence may contain a signal peptide coding region which is foreign to the coding sequence. The foreign signal peptide coding region may be required where the coding sequence does not naturally contain a signal peptide coding region. Aitematively, the foreign signal peptide coding region may simply replace the latura! signal peptide coding region in order to enhance secretion of the polypeptide. However, any signal peptide coding region which directs the expressed polypeptide into the decretory pathway of a host cell of choice may be used in the present invention,<br>
The signal peptide coding region is nucleotides 1 to 59 of SEQ ID N0:1 which encode amino acids -55 to -33 of SEQ ID N0:2 (or amino acids 1 to 23 of SEQ ID N0:3).<br>

Effective signal peptide coding regions for filamentous fungal host cells are the signal eptide coding regions obtained from the genes for Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase, spergillus n/g^r neutral amylase, Asperg///t/sn/ger glucoamylase, Rhizomucor miehei aspariic 'oteinase, Hurnicola insolens celiuiase  and Humicola lanuginosa lipase.<br><br>
Useful signal peptides for yeast host cells are obtained from the genes for Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Invertase. Other useful signal peptide coding regions are described by Romanes et ai, 1992, supra.<br>
The control sequence may also be a propeptide coding region that codes for an amino acid sequence positioned at the amino terminus of a polypeptide. The resultant polypeptide is known as a proenzyme or propolypeptide (or a zymogen in some cases). A propolypeptide is generally inactive and can be converted lo a mature active polypeptide by catalytic or autocatalytic cleavage of the propeptide from the propolypeptide. The propeptide coding region may be obtained from the genes for Bacillus subtilis alkaline protease (apr£), 63c///us subtilis neutral protease {nprT}, Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor. Rhizomucor miehei aspartic proteinase, and Myceliophthora thermophila laccase (WO 95/33836).<br>
The propeptide coding region is nucleotides 70 to 165 of SEQ ID N0:1 which encode amino acids -32 to -1 of SEQ ID N0:2 (or amino acids 24 to 55 of SEQ ID N0:3).<br>
Where both signal peptide and propeptide regions are present at the amino terminus of a polypeptide, the propeptide region is positioned next to the amino terminus of a polypeptide and the signal peptide region is positioned next to the amino terminus of ttie propeptide region.<br>
It may also be decorative to add regulatory sequences which allow the regulation of the expression of the polypeptide relative to the gravity of the host cell. Earplugs of regulatory systems are those which cause the expression of the gene to be turned on or off in response lo a chemical or physical stimulus, including the presence of a regulatory compound. Regulatory systems in prokaryotic systems include the lac, tac, and trp operator systems. In yeast, the ADH2 system or GAL1 system may be used. In filamentous fungi, the TAKA aipha-amylase promoter, Aspergillus niger glucoamylase promoter, and Aspergillus oryzae glucoamylase promoter may be used as regulatory sequences. Other examples of regulatory sequences are those which allow for gene amplification. In eukaryotic systems, these include the dihydrofolate reductase gene which is amplified in the presence of methotrexate, and the metallothionein genes which are amplified with heavy metals. In these cases, the nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide would be operably linked with the regulatory sequence.<br>
Expression Vectors<br>
The present invention also relates to recombinant expression vectors comprising the lucleic acid construct of the invention. The various nucleotide and control sequences described above may be joined together to produce a recombinant expression vector which nay include one or more convenient restriction sites to allow for insertion or substitution of the lucleotide sequence encoding the  polypeptide at such sites   . the nucleotide<br><br>
sequence of the present invention may be expressed by inserting the nucleotide sequence or a nucleic acid construct comprising the sequence into an appropriate vector for expression. In creating the expression vector, the coding sequence is located in the vector so that the coding sequence is operably linked with the appropriate control sequences for expression.<br>
The recombinant expression vector may be any vector (e.g., a plasmid or virus) which can be conveniently subjected to recombinant DNA procedures and can bring about the expression of the nucleotide sequence. The choice of the vector will typically depend on the compatibility of the vector with the host cell into which the vector is to be introduced. The vectors may be linear or closed circular plasmids.<br>
The vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e., a vector which exists as an extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication, e.g., a plasmid, an extrachromosomal element, a minichromosome, or an artificial chromosome.<br>
The vector may contain any means for issuing self-replication. Alternatively, the vector may be one which, when introduced into the host cell, is integrated into the genome and replicated together with the chromosomes(s) into which it has been integrated. Furthermore, a single vector or plasmid or two or more vectors or plasmids which together contain the total DMA to be introduced into the genome of the host cell, or a transposed may be used.<br>
The vectors of the present invention preferably contain one or more selectable markers which permit easy selection of transformed cells. A selectable marker is a gene the product of which provides for biocide or viral resistance, resistance to heavy metals, prototroph to luxotrophs, and the like.<br>
Examples of bacterial selectable markers are the dal genes from Bacillus subtilis or bacillus iicheniformis. or markers which confer antibiotic resistance such as ampicillin, anamycin, chloramphenicol or tetracycline resistance. Suitable markers for yeast host cells re ADE2, HISS, LEU2, LYS2, MET3, TRP1. and URA3. Selectable markers for use in a lamentous fungal host cell include, but are not limited to, amdS (acetamidase), argB jrnithine carbamoyltransferase), bar (phosphinothricin acetyltransferase), hygB (hygromycin -iQsphotransferase), niaD (nitrate reductase), pyrG (orotidine-S'-phcsphate decarboxylase), " (sulfate adenyltransferase), trpC (anthranilate syntheses), as well as equivalents thereof.<br>
Preferred for use in an Aspergillus cell are the amdS and pyrG genes of Aspergillus duals or Aspergillus oryzae and the tar gene of Streptomyces hygroscopicus.<br>
Tine vectors of the present invention preferably contain an element(s) that permits stable integration of the vector into the host cell's genome or autonomous replication of the vector in the cell independent of the genome.<br>
For interaction into the host  cell genome   the vector .may rely on the  nucleotide<br><br>
sequence encoding the polypeptide or any other element of the vector for stable integration of (he vector into the genome by homologous or nonhomologous recombination. Alternatively, the vector may contain additional nucleotide sequences for directing integration by homologous recombination into the genome of the host cell. The additional nucleotide sequences enable the vector to be integrated into the host cell genome at a precise location(s) in the chromosome(s). To increase the likelihood of integration at a precise location, the integrational elements should preferably contain a sufficient number of nucleotides, such as 100 to 1,500 base pairs, preferably 400 to 1,500 base pairs, and most preferably 800 to 1,500 base pairs, v^hich are highly homologous with the corresponding target sequence to enhance the probability of homologous recombination. The integrational elements may be any sequence that is homologous with the target sequence in the genome of the host cell. Furthermore, the integrational elements may be non-encoding or encoding nucleotide sequences. On the other hand, the vector may be integrated into the genome of the host cell by non-homologous recombination.<br>
For autonomous replication, the vector may further cornprise an origin of replication enabling the vector to replicate autonomously in the host cell in question. Examples of bacterial origins of replication are the origins of replication of piasmids pBR322, pUC19, pACYC177, and pACYC184 permitting replication in E. coll. and pUBIIO, pE194, pTA1060, and pAMGI permitting replication in Bacillus. Examples of origins of replication for use in a yeast host cell are the 2 micron origin of replication, ARS1, ARS4, the combination of ARSl and CEN3, and the combination of ARS4 and CEN6, The origin of replication may be one having a mutation which makes its functioning temperature-sensitive in the host cell (see, e.g., Ehrlich, 1978, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 75: 1433).<br>
More than one copy of a nucleotide sequence of the present invention may be inserted into the host cell to increase production of the gene product. An increase in the copy number of the nucleotide sequence can be obtained by integrating at least one additional copy of the sequence into the host cell genome or by including an amplifiable selectable marker gene with the nucleotide sequence \fjhere cells containing amplified copies of the selectable marker gene, and thereby additional copies of the nucleotide sequence, can be selected for by cultivating the cells in the presence of the appropriate selectable agent.<br>

Methods of Production<br>
The present invention also relates to methods for producing a polypeptide of the present invention comprising (a) cultivating a strain, which in its wild-type form is capable of producing the polypeptide; and (b) recovering the polypeptide. Preferably, the strain is of the genus Pseudop/ecfan/a, and more preferably Pseudopteciania nigreHs.<br>
The present insertion also relates to methods for producing a polypeptide of the present invention comprising (a) cultivating a host cell under conditions conducive for production of the polypeptide: and (b) recovering the polypeptide.<br>
In the production methods of the present invention, the ceils are cultivated in a nutrient medium suitable for production of the polypeptide using methods known in the art. For example, the cell may be cultivated by shake flask cultivation, small-scale or large-scale fermentation (including continuous, batch, fed-batch, or solid state fermentations) in laboratory or industrial terminators performed in a suitable medium and under conditions allowing the polypeptide to be expressed and/or isolated. The cultivation lakes place in a suitable nutrient medium compassing carbon and nitrogen sources and inorganic salts, using procedures known in the art. Suitable media are available from commercial suppliers or may be prepared according to published compositions (e.g., in catalogues of the American Type Culture Collection), if the polypeptide is secreted into the nutrient medium, the polypeptide can be recovered directly from the medium. If the polypeptide is not secreted, it can be recovered from cell instates,<br>
The polypeptides may be detected using methods known in the art that are specific for the polypeptides. These detection methods may include use of specific antibodies, formation of an enzyme product, or disappearance of an enzyme substrate. For example, an enzyme assay may be used to determine the activity of the polypeptide as described herein.<br>
The resulting polypeptide may be recovered by methods known in the art. For example, the polypeptide may be recovered from the nothing medium by conventional procedures including, but not limited to, centrifugation, filtration, extraction, spray-drying, evaporation, or precipitation.<br>
The polypeptides of the present invention may be purified by a variety of procedures known in the art including, but not limited to, chromatography {e.g.. ion exchange, affinity, hydrophobic,   chroTatofocusing,   and   size   exclusion),   electrophorev.c   proc&amp;iures   (eg<br><br>
preparative bioelectric focusing), differential solubility {e.g.. ammonium sulfate precipitation), SDS-PAGE, or extraction (see, e.g., Protein Purification, J,-C. Janson and Lars Ryden, editors, VCH Publishers, New York, 1989).<br>
Plants<br>
The present invention also relates to a transgenic plant, plant part, or plant cell which has been transformed with a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide having antimicrobial activity of the present invention so as to express and produce the polypeptide in recoverable quantities. The polypeptide may be recovered from the plant or plant part. Alternatively, the plant or plant part containing the recombinant polypeptide may be used as such for improving the quality of a food or feed, e.g., improving nutritional value, palatability, and theological properties, or to destroy an ant nutritive factor. The recovered polypeptide, plant or plant part may also be used to improve or alter digestive flora in animals and livestock.<br>
The transgenic plant can be dicotyledonous (a dicot) or monocotyledonous (a monocot). Examples of monocol plants are grasses, such as meadow grass (blue grass, Poa), forage grass such as Festuca, Lolium, temperate grass, such as Agroslis, and cereals, e.g., overheat, oats, rye, barley, rice, sorghum, and maize (corn).<br>
Examples of dicot plants are tobacco, potato, sugar beet, legumes, such as lupines, pea, bean and soybean, and cruciferous plants (family Brassicaceae), such as cauiiflover, rape seed, and the closely related model organism Arabidopsis thaliana-<br>
Examples of plant parts are stem, callus, leaves, root, fruits, seeds, and tubers. Also specific plant tissues, such as chloroplast, applets, mitochondria, vacuole, paroxysm’s, and cytoplasm are considered to be a plant part. Furthermore, any plant cell, whatever the tissue origin, is considered to be a plant part.<br>
Also included within the scope of the present invention are the progeny of such plants, plant parts and plant cells.<br>
The transgenic plant or plant cell expressing a polypeptide of the present invention may be constructed in accordance with methods known in the art. Briefly, the plant or plant cell is constructed by incorporating one or more expression constructs encoding a polypeptide of the present invention into the plant host genome and propagating the resulting modified plant or plant cell into a transgenic plant or plant cell.<br>
Conveniently, the expression construct is a nucleic acid construct which comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of the present invention operably United with appropriate regulatory sequences required for expression of the nucleotide sequence in the plant or plant part of choice. Furthermore, the expression construct may comprise a selectable marker useful 'or identifying host cells it which the expression cornstalk' has been integrated<br><br>
and DNA sequences necessary for introduction of the construct into the plant in question (the latter depends on the DNA introduction method to be used).<br>
The choice of regulatory sequences, such as promoter and terminator sequences and optionally signal or transit sequences is determined, tor example, on the basis of when, where, and how the polypeptide is desired to be expressed For instance, the expression of the gene encoding a polypeptide of the present invention may be constitutive or inducible, or may be developmental, stage or tissue specific, and the gene product may be targeted to a specific tissue or plant part such as seeds or leaves. Regulatory sequences are, for example, described by Tague e; a/., 1988, Plant Physiology 86, 506,<br>
For constitutive expression, the 35S-CaMV promoter may be used (Fredrick e( al.. 1980, Cell 21: 285-294), Organ-specific promoters may be, for example, a promoter from storage sink tissues such as seeds, potato tubers, and fruits (Edwards S Coruzzi, 1990, Ann. Rev. Genet 24; 275-303), or from metabolic sink tissues such as moistens {Ito e) al.. 1994, Plant Mol. Biol. 24: 863-878), a seed specific promoter such as the glutamine, proiamin, globulin, or albumin promoter from rice (Wu et al., 1998, Plant and Cell Physiology 39: 885-889), a Vicia faba promoter from the legumin B4 and the unknown seed protein gene from Vicia faba (Conrad of al., 1998. Journal of Plant Physiology 152: 708-711), a promoter from a seed oil body protein (Chen of al., 1998, Plant and Cell Physiology 39: 935-941), the storage protein napA promoter from Brasslike napus, or any other seed specific promoter known in the art, e.g.. as described in WO 91/14772, Furthermore, the promoter may be a leaf specific promoter such as the rbcs promoter from rice or tomato (Kyozuka et al., 1993, Plant Physiology 102: 991-1000, the chlorella virus adenine methyltransferase gene promoter (Mitra and Hlggins, 1994, Plant Molecular Biology 26: 85-93), or the aldP gene promoter from rice ;Kagaya ef a/., 1995, Molecular and General Genetics 248: 668-674), or a wound inducible Dromoter such as the potato pin2 promoter (Xu ef a/,, 1993, Plant Molecular Biology 22: 573-588).<br>
A promoter enhancer element may also be used to achieve higher expression of the enzyme in the plant. For instance, the promoter enhancer element may be an intron which is placed between the promoter and the nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of the ^resent invention. For instance, Xu ef al,, 1993, supra disclose the use of the first intron of the ice actins 1 gene to enhance expression.<br>
The selectable marker gene and any other parts of the expression construct may be ;hosen from those available in the a,-:.<br>
The nucleic acid construct is incorporated into the plant genome according to ■conventional techniques known in the art, including Agro6acfer/um-mediated transformation, irus-media^ec; transformation, micrcmjectiori, particle bombardment   biolist'C transformations"<br><br>
and electro oration (Gasser e; a/.. 1990, Science 244: 1293; Potrykus, 1990, e/o/Technology 3: 535; Shimamoto et al.. 1989, Nature 338: 274).<br>
Presently, Agrobacterium fumefaciens-mediated gene transfer is the method of choice or generating transgenic dicots (for a review, see Hooykas and Schifperoort, 1992, Plant Molecular Biology 19: 15-38), However it can also be used for transforming monocots, although other transformation methods are generally preferred for these plants. Presently, the method of choice for generating transgenic monocots is particle bombardment {microscopic old or tungsten particles coated with the transforming DNA) of embryonic calli or developing embryos (Christou, 1992, Plant Journal 2: 275-281; Shimamoto, 1994, Current Opinion 'biotechnology 5: 15B-162; Vasil ef al., 1992, BiO/Tecfino/ogy 10: 667-674), An alternative method for transformation of monocots is based on protoplast transformation as described by misrule et at, 1993, P/anf/Wo/ecij/arS/o/ogy 21: 415-428,<br>
Following transformation, the transformants having incorporated therein the expression District are selected and regenerated into whole plants according to methods well-known in le art.<br>

n vitro synthesis<br>
The antimicrobial peptides of the invention may be prepared by in vitro synthesis, using ionvenliona! methods as known in the art. Various commercial synthetic apparatuses B!e ivailable, for example automated synthesizers by Applied Biosystems inc., Beckman, etc. By ising synthesizers, naturally occurring amino acids may be substituted with unnatural am.no cids, particularly D-isomers (or D-forms) e.g. D-alanine and D-isoieucine. diastereoisomers, ide chains having different lengths or functionalities, and the like. The particular sequence nd the manner of preparation will be determined by convenience, economics, purity required, nd the like<br><br>
Chemical linking may be provided to various peptides or proteins comprising convenient functionalities for bonding, such as amino groups for amide or substituted amine formation, e.g. reductive amination, thiol groups for thioether or disulfide formation, carboxyl groups for amide formation, and the like.<br>
If desired, various groups may be introduced into the peptide during synthesis or during expression, vi/hich allow for linking to other molecules or to a surface. Thus cysteines can be used to make thioethers, histidines for linking to a metal ion complex, carboxyl groups for forming amides or esters, amino groups for forming amides, and the like.<br>
The polypeptides may also be isolated and purified in accordance with conventional methods of recombinant synthesis.

Usually, the percentages will be based upon total protein<br>
Animal Feed<br>
The present invention is also directed to methods for using the polypeptides having antimicrobial activity in animal feed, as well as to feed compositions and feed additives comprising the antimicrobial polypeptides of the invention.<br>
The term animal includes all animals, including human beings. Examples of animals are non-ruminants, and ruminants, such as cows, sheep and horses, in a particular embodiment, the animal is a non-ruminant animal. Non-ruminant animals include mono-gastric animals, e.g. pigs or swine (including, but not limited to, piglets, growing pigs, and sows); poultry such as turkeys and chicken (including but not limited to broiler chicks, layers); young calves; and fish (including but not limited to salmon).<br>
The term feed or feed composition means any compound, preparation, mixture, or composition suitable for, or intended for intake by an animal.<br>
In the use according to the invention the antimicrobial polypeptide can be fed to tie animal before, after, or simultaneously with the diet. The latter is preferred.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the antimicrobial polypeptide, in the form in which it is added to the feed, or when being included in a feed additive, is well defined. Well-defined means that the antimicrobial polypeptide preparation is at least 50% pure as determined by Size-exclusion   ch.'-omatography  (see  Example   12  of WO  01/58275)   In   ether  panicu ar<br><br>
eiriDoaimenis tne antimicrobial polypeptide preparation is at least 60, 70, SO, 85, 88, 90. 92, 94, or at least 95% pure as determined by this method.<br>
A well-defined antimicrobial polypeptide preparation is advantageous. For instance, it is much easier to dose correctly to the feed an antimicrobial polypeptide that is essentially free from interfering or contaminating other antimicrobial polypeptides. The term dose correctly refers in particular to the objective of obtaining consistent and constant results, and the capability of optimising dosage based upon the desired effect.<br>
For the use in animal feed, however, the antimicrobial polypeptide need not be that pure: it may e.g. include other enzymes, in which case it could be termed an antimicrobial polypeptide preparation.<br>
The antimicrobial polypeptide preparation can be (a) added directly to the feed {or used directly in a treatment process of vegetable proteins), or (b) it can be used in the production of one or more intermediate compositions such as feed additives or premixes that is subsequently added to the feed (or used in a treatment process). The degree of purity described above refers to the purity of the original antimicrobiai polypeptide preparation, whether used according to (a) or (b) above.<br>
Antimicrobial polypeptide preparations with purities of this order of magnitude are in particular obtainable using recombinant methods of production, whereas they are not so easily obtained and also subject to a much higher batch-to-batch variation when the antimicrobial polypeptide is produced by traditional fermentation methods.<br>
Such antimicrobial polypeptide preparation may of course be mixed with other enzymes.<br>
The term vegetable proteins as used herein refers to any compound, composition, preparation or mixture that includes at least one protein derived from or originating from a vegetable, including modified proteins and protein-derivatives. In particular embodiments, the protein content of the vegetable proteins is at least 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, or 60% (w/w).<br>
Vegetable proteins may be derived from vegetable protein sources, such as legumes and cereals, for example materials from plants of the families Fabaceae (Legumlnosae), Cruciferaceae, Chenopodiaceae, and Poaceae. such as soy bean meal, lupin meal and rapeseed meal.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the vegetable protein source is material from one or more plants of the family Fabaceae, e.g. soybean, lupine, pea, or bean.<br>
In another particular embodiment, the vegetable protein source is material from one or more plants of the family Cfienopodiaceae, e.g. beet, sugar beet, spinach or quinoa.<br>
Other examples of vegetable protein sources are rapeseed, and cabbage-Soybean is 3 preferred vegetable protein source.<br><br>
other examples of vegetable protein sources are cereals such as barley, wheat, rye, oat, maize {corn), rice, and sorghum.<br>
The antimicrobial polypeptide can be added to the feed in any form, be it as a relatively pure antimicrobial polypeptide, or in admixture v^ith other components intended for addition to animal feed, i.e. in the form of animal feed additives, such as the so-called pre-mixes for animal feed.<br>
tn a further aspect the present invention relates to compositions for use in animal feed, such as animal feed, and animal feed additives, e.g. premixes.<br>
Apart from the antimicrobial polypeptide of the invention, the animal feed additives of the invention contain at least one fat soluble vitamin, and/or at least one water soluble vitamin, and/or at least one trace mineral, and/or at least one macro mineral.<br>
Further, optional, feed-additive ingredients are colouhng agents, aroma compounds, stabilisers, and/or at least one other enzyme selected from amongst phytases EC 3.1-3.8 or 3.1.3,26; xylanases EC 3.2.1.8; galactanases EC 3.2,1-89; and/or beta-glucanases EC 3,2.1.4.<br>
In a particular embodiment these other enzymes are well defined (as defined above for antimicrobial polypeptide preparations).<br>
Examples of other antimicrobial peptides (AMP's) are CAP18, Leucocin A, Tritrpticin, Protegrin-1, Thanatin, Defensin, Ovispinn such as Novispihn (Robert Lehrer, 2000), and variants, or fragments thereof which retain antimicrobial activity.<br>
Examples of other antifungal polypeptides (AFP's) are the Aspergillus giganteus, and Aspergillus niger peptides, as well as variants and fragments thereof which retain antifungal activity, as disclosed in WO 94/01459 and PCT/DK02/00289 [replace with WO number once published].<br>
Usually fat and water soluble vitamins, as well as trace minerals form part of a so-called premix intended for addition to the feed, whereas macro minerals are usually separately added to the feed. Either of these composition types, when enriched with an antimicrobial polypeptide of the invention, is an animal feed additive of the invention.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the animal feed additive of the invention is intended for being included (or prescribed as having to be included) in animal diets or feed at levels of 0,01 to 10.0%; more particularly 0.05 to 5.0%; or 0.2 to 1.0% (% meaning g additive per 100 c feed). This is so in particular for premixes.<br>
The following are non-exclusive lists of examples of these components:<br>
Examples of fat soluble vitamins are vitamin A. vitamin D3, vitamin E, and vitamin K, e.g. vitamin K3.<br>
Examples of water soluble viramins are vitamin B12. biotin and ::holine   vitamin B1<br><br>
vitamin B2, vitamin B6, niacin, folic acid and panthothenate, e.g. Ca-D-panthothenate.<br>
Examples of trace minerals are manganese, zinc, iron, copper, iodine, selenium, and cobalt.<br>
Examples of macro minerals are calcium, phosphorus and sodium. The nutritional requirements of these components (exemplified with poultry and piglets/pigs) are listed in Table A of WO 01/58275. Nutritional requirement means that these components should be provided in the diet in the concentrations indicated.<br>
In the alternative, the animal feed additive of the invention comprises at least one of the individual components specified in Table A of WO 01/58275, At least one means either of, one or more of, one, or two, or three, or four and so forth up to all thirteen, or up to all fifteen individual components. More specifically, this at least one individual component is included in the additive of the invention in such an amount as to provide an in-feed-concentration within the range indicated in column four, or column five, or column six of Table A.<br>
The present invention also relates to animal feed compositions. Animal feed compositions or diets have a relatively high content of protein. Poultry and pig diets can be characterised as indicated in Table B of WO 01/58275, columns 2-3. Fish diets can be characterised as indicated in column 4 of this Table B. Furthermore such fish diets usually have a crude fat content of 200-310 g/kg.<br>
An animal feed composition according to the invention has a crude protein content of 50-800 g/kg, and furthermore comprises at least one antimicrobial polypeptide as claimed herein.<br>
Furthermore, or in the alternative {to the crude protein content indicated above), the animal feed composition of the invention has a content of metabolisable energy of 10-30 MJ/kg; and/or a content of calcium of 0.1-200 g/kg; and/or a content of available phosphorus of 0.1-200 g/kg; and/or a content of methionine of 0.1-100 g/kg; and/or a content of methionine plus cysteine of 0.1-150 g/kg; and/or a content of lysine of 0,5-50 g/kg.<br>
In particular embodiments, the content of metabolisable energy, crude protein, calcium, phosphorus, methionine, methionine plus cysteine, and/or lysine is vi'ithin any one of ranges 2, 3, 4 or 5 in Table B of WO 01/58275 (R. 2-5).<br>
Crude protein is calculated as nitrogen (N) multiplied by a factor 6,25, i.e. Crude protein {g/kg)= N (g/kg) x 6,25. The nitrogen content is determined by the Kjeldahl method {A.O.A.C, 1984, Official Methods of Analysis 14th ed,, Association of Official Analytical Chemists, Washington DC).<br>
Metabolisable energy can be calculated on the basis of the NRC publication Nutriert requirements in swine, ninth revised edition 1988, subcommittee on swine nutrition, committee on animal nutrition, board of agriculture, national research council. National Academy Press<br><br>
Washington, D.C, pp. 2-6, and the European Table of Energy Values for Poultry Feed-stuffs, Spelderholt centre for poultry research and extension, 7361 DA Beekbergen, The Netherlands. Grafisch bedrijf Ponsen &amp; looijen bv, Wageningen. ISBN 90-71463-12-5.<br>
The dietary content of calcium, available phosphorus and amino acids in complete animal diets is calculated on the basis of feed tables such as Veevoedertabel 1997, gegevens over chemische samenstelling, verteerbaarheid en voederwaarde van voedermiddelen, Central Veevoederbureau, Runderweg 6, 8219 pk Leiystad. ISBN 90-72839-13-7.<br>
in a particular embodiment, the animal feed composition of the invention contains at least one vegetable protein or protein source as defined above.<br>
In still further particular embodiments, the animal feed composition of the invention contains 0-30% maize; and/or 0-80% sorghum; and/or 0-70% wheat; and/or 0-70% Barley; and/or 0-30% oats; and/or 0-40% soybean meal; and/or 0-10% fish meal; and/or 0-20% whey. Animal diets can e.g. be manufactured as mash feed {non pelleted) or pelleted feed. Typically, the milled feed-stuffs are mixed and sufficient amounts of essential vitamins and minerals are added according to the specifications for the species in question. Enzymes can be added as solid or liquid enzyme formulations. For example, a solid enzyme formulation is typically added before or during the mixing step; and a liquid enzyme preparation is typically added after the pelleting step. The enzyme may also be incorporated in a feed additive or premix.<br>
The final enzyme concentration in the diet is wiliiin the range of 0,01-200 mg enzyme protein per kg diet, for example in the range of 5-30 mg enzyme protein per kg animal diet.<br>
The antimicrobial polypeptide may be administered in one or more of the following amounts {dosage ranges): 0.01-200; or Q.01-100; or 0.05-100; or 0,05-50; or 0.10-10 - all these ranges being in mg antimicrobial polypeptide protein per kg feed (ppm).<br>
For determinit^g mg antimicrobial polypeptide protein per kg feed, the antimicrobial polypeptide is purified from the feed composition, and the specific activity of the purified antimicrobial polypeptide is determined using a relevant assay (see under antimicrobial activity, substrates, and assays). The antimicrobial activity of the feed composition as such is also determined using the same assay, and on the basis of these two determinations, the dosage in mg antimicrobial polypeptide protein per kg feed is calculated.<br>
The same principles apply for determining mg antimicrobial polypeptide protein in feed additives. Of course, if a sample is available of the antimicrobial polypeptide used for preparing the feed additive or the feed, the specific activity is determined from this sample (no need to purify the antimicrobial polypeptide from the feed composition or the additive).<br>

Notable features of this plasmid are the EcoRi-NotI restriction sites proximal io the Shine Dalgamo region of the Lac promoter. This allows EcoRI-NotI adapted cDNAs to be cloned into the vector and the resulting constructs to be actively transcribed and translated in the £ coy/host.<br>
Construction of the Pseudoplectania nipreHa library and signal trapping of the cDNA resulting plasmid pool<br>
A cDNA plasmid pool was prepared from 20,000 total transformants of the original cDNA-pf^Has5 vector ligation. Plasmid DNA was prepared directly from a pool of colonies recovered from solid LB selective media according to the Qiagen protocol for plasmid DNA isolation  (Qiagen  Inc.).  The  plasmid  pool was  treated with transposon SigA2  and  MuA transposase according to the transposase manufacturer's instructions (Finnizyme, Finland), General information about transposon assisted signal trapping can be found in international patent application WO 01/77315. The resulting mixture was ethanol precipitated to remove excess salt and 1.5 microliter electroporated into 20 microliter DH10B ultra-competent cells according to the standard protocol provided with the cells (Gibco-BRL). Electroporated cells were incubated in SOC media with shaking (28 degrees celcius, 2 hours, 250 rpm) before being plated on selective media. Three agar medias were used; LB + 50 microgram pr. ml kanamycin, LB + kanamycin + 15 microgram pr. ml chloramphencol, or LB + kanamycin + chloramphenicol + 12.5 microgram pr. ml ampicillin-<br>
From dilution plating of the electroporation onto LB+kanamycin+chloramphenicol media, it was determined that approximately 119,000 colonies were present containing a cDNA library plasmid with a SigA2 transposition. In all 363 colonies were recovered from the experiment under triple selection. All 363 colonies were replica plated onto triple selection with 50 microgram pr ml ampicillin to select for true signal trappants, A total of 336 colonies were able to grow under the increased ampicillin concentration and these were miniprepped according to the Qiagen Qiaturbo96 protocol [Qiagen inc.). Plasmids were sequenced with the transposon forward and reverse primers (primers A and B) according to the procedu-'e disclosed in the examples of international patent application WO 01/77315.<br>

DNA sequence was obtained for the reactions on an AB3700 capillary sequencer. Sequences were trimmed to remove vector and transposon sequence and the A and B primer reads for each plasmid assembled. This resulted in 225 assembled sequences which were grouped by sequence homology into 145 contigs. All 145 contigs were independently blasted and the results analyzed. One plasmid (Plectasin_6_B12) shared some amino acid homology with known antimicrobial polypeptides (defensin-like polypeptides).<br>
In the following examples the antimicrobial polypeptide of the invention is referred to as "Plectasin".<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Construction of an AsDergillus expression vector for Plectasin<br>
The Plectasin encoding sequence was amplified from the above cDNA library (see Example 1 above) in the foliowing manner: 1 microliter of cDNA (approximately 10 nanogram of DNA) was used as template in a PCR reaction with the two primers 178 and 179,<br>
Primer 178:     tctgg atcca ccatg caatt tacca ccatc ctctc	(SEQ ID N0:7)<br>
Primer 179:     tctct cgagc tagta acact tgcaa acaaa gc	(SEQ ID N0:8)<br>
10 pmole of each primer was used in a 100 microliter reaction volume. Annealing temperature was 55 degrees celcius, and extension at 72 degrees celcius for 1 minute. A total of 35 cycles were run. The Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche) was used,<br>
Aliquots of the PCR reaction were separated on a 4% agarose gel. Two distinct bands were seen: The most prominent band at a size of approximately 300 bp and a somewhat weaker band at approximately 350 bp.<br>
Both fragments were digested with BamHI and Xhol which cut in the overhangs introduced by the PCR phmers. The digested fragments were isolated and cloned into p^/IT2168, an Aspergillus expression plasmid based on the plasmid pCaHj527 (see the examples of international patent application WQ 00/70064) constructed as described in example 7 of Danish Patent application PA 2001 00088, The shorter fragment was found to contain the Plectasin encoding sequence as determined from the signal trapping experiment (see Example 1 above). The sequence of this shorther PCR fragment is shown as SEQ ID N0.5.<br><br>
Similarly, the sequence of the longer PCR fragment was determined to contain the Plectasin encoding sequence and an additional 58 bp insert. It was noted that the 58 bp insert contains the consensus features of a fungal intron, and the amplification of this product is taken as evidence for incomplete intron removal in the mRNA pool and derived cDNA library. The sequence of this longer PCR fragment is shown as SEQ ID N0:6, The Aspergillus expression plasmid for the shorter PCR product (SEQ ID N0:5) was named pMT2548.<br>
EXAIVIPLE3<br>
Expression of Plectasin in Aspergillus:<br>
PMT2548 was transformed into Aspergillus oryzae strain BECh2 (disclosed in international patent application WO 00/39322) and into Aspergillus niger MBin118. 30 transformants of each strain were re-isolated twice under selective and noninducing conditions on Cove minimal plates with sucrose and acetamide. To test expression of Plectasin, transformants were grown for 6 days at 30 degrees celcius in tubes with 10 ml YPM (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% maltose). Supernatants were run on NuPage 10% Bis-Ths SDS gels (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer with MES running buffer to allow separation in the low Mw range. Both Aspergillus strains grew well even when induced for the expression of Plectasin, A distinct band of the size expected for Plectasin was seen in most transformants whereas this band was not seen in the untransformed host strains A. oryzae BECh2 and A. riiger MBin118, It appeared that the Plectasin band was stronger in the BECh2 transformants than in the MBinllS transformants. It was estimated, very roughly and on the basis of staining intensity only, that the yield under these growth conditions was in the order of 10-50 mg per liter of culture medium.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>

Growth inhibition of E. coli upon expression of Plectasin<br>
In order tc evaluate whether E. coli was growth inhibited in liquid media upon induction of endogenous Plectasin expression, the following experiment was conducted as disclosed in the examples of international patent application WO 00/73433. Briefly, fresh overnight cultures of cells containing either pDRS-IS-plectasin, pDR-18-plectasin, pHH or pHHA plasmid were diluted 300-fold into 150 micro liter of LB or LB containing 0-1% arabinose in a micro titer plate and incubated at 37 degrees celcius with vigorous shaking. The growth curve was monitored by measuring ODDS at regular intervals using an ELISA reader. Results showed that Plectasin inhibited 41% cell growth when directed to the peril’s however, it did not affect cell growth when expressed in the cytoplasm (see table below).<br><br>

Enzymatic digestion of flanking restriction endonuciease sites (AlwNl / Aval) enabled us to clone this gene as a fusion construct in pET31b+ (standard procedures as described by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs Inc., MA), All standard protocols has been described elsewhere (Sambrook, Fhtsch, and Maniatis, 1989).<br>
Transformation and Expression of P. nigrella Plectasin in £". coli<br>
Recombinant pET31b+ was transformed into £ coli Novablue is described by the manufacturer (Novagen), Plasmid was prepared by QlAprep Mini Colunnns (QIAGEN Inc., CA) and sequenced by automated sequencing using plasmid specific pnmers (PrimerB and Primer4),<br>

Plasmid was transformed in E. coli BLR-DE3 according to the manufacturer (Novagen). Bacteria were cultivated in LB media to OD6oo~'0.8 and recombinant protein synthesis was initiated by 1 mM IPTG (Isopropyl beta-D-Thiogalactopyranoside). Upon 3 hours of induction, bacteria were harvested, resuspended in 1/10 volume buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCi, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCI, pH 8) and lysed by pressure disruption (1500 mBar). Resulting pellet was washed twice in buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCI, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% TritonX-100, 100 mM NaCl, pH 8). All standard protocols has been described elsewhere (Sambrook, Frilsch, and Maniatis, 1989),<br>
Purification of P. nigrella Plectasin from E. coli inclusionbodies<br>
The pellet resulting from the above purification contained purified inclusion bodies. To liberate the peptide from the KSI fusion partner, acid hydrolysis was performed on an engineered   Asp-Pro   site,    introduced   N-terminally   to   the   Plectasin   encoding   gene,<br>
inclusionbodies were resuspended in 100 mM sodium phosphate (pH 2.3) and incubated overnight at 85 degrees celcius. Resulting supernatant contained Pralines-Plectasin and sample was neutralized by 100 mM sodium phosphate (pH 12.3). The identity of Proline-PSectasin was confirmed by mass-spectrometry   Al! standard protocols has been described<br><br>
elsewhere {Sambrook, Fritsch, and Maneates, 1989).<br>
Antimicrobial activity by Radial Diffusion Assay<br>
A modified version of a previously published protocol has been applied in the detection of antimicrobial activity (Lehrer et al., (1991) Ultra sensitive assays for endogenous antimicrobial polypeptides J Immune Methods 137: 167-173). Target bacteria (10^ colony forming units (CPU)) were added to 10 ml of underlay agarose (1% low electro-endosmosis agarose, 0.03% Trypticase soy broth, 10 mM sodium phosphates, pH 7.4, 37 degrees celcius). Suspension was solidified on an INTEGRID Petri Dish (Becton Dickinson Labware, NJ). A 3 mm Gel Puncher was used to make holes in the underlay agarose (Amerce Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden). Samples were added to the holes and incubated at 37 degrees celcius, 3 hours. An overlay was poured on top and the plate was incubated overnight (LB media, 7.5% Agar). Antimicrobial activity was seen as bacterial clearing zones around the wells. Living cells was counterstained by adding 10 ml, 0.2 mM MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide Thiazolyl blue). All standard protocols has been described elsewhere (Sambrook, Fritsch, and Mandates, 1989).<br>
Antimicrobial activity of Plectasin against Bacillus subtilis<br>
To evaluate the anti-microbial activity of Plectasin, fermentation broths of recombinant Aspergillus oryzae were applied in 2-fold serial dilutions in a radial diffusion assay (described above). Large clearing zones were seen when testing the sample against Bacillus subtilis following the above protocol. The largest clearing zone was obtained with undiluted fermentation broth (15 mm), whereas samples taken from non-recombinant Aspergillus oryzae shoved no antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtilis.<br>
Plectasin expressed through inclusionbodies in an alternative F.co/i host<br>
To increase the amount of recovered Plectasin with antimicrobial activity, Plectasin was expressed in E.coti Ongami-DE3 (Novagen Inc.). This strain carries a mutation in the genes encoding thioredoxin reductase (trxB) and glutathione reductase {gar) The recombinant pET31b+ plasmid encoding Plectasin was transformed in E.coli Origami-DE3 according to the manufacturer (Novagen). Cultivation, expression and isolation of Plectasin containing inclusionbodies was done as described above (Transformation and Expression of P. nigrella Plectasin in E. colij. Recovery of Plectasin was as described above (Purification of P. nigrella Plectasin from E. coll inclusionbodies). Subsequently, radial diffusion assay was used :o access the antimicrobial activity (see above: Antimicrobial activity by Radial Diffusion Assay).<br>
Results show that producing Plectasin peptides in E co//Origarr,i-DE3 results in a 5-' J<br><br>
fold increase in antimicrobial activity of the peptide. The increased biological activity of Plectasin was further supported by the fact that similar results were obtained expressing another defensin, the human beta-defenses 3. We conclude that E coli strains that allow the formation of disulphide bonds in the cytoplasm is generally applicable in the biosynthesis of biologically active defensins and other disulphide bridged antimicrobial peptides.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Construction of Saccharomyces cerevisiae express.on vector for Plectasin<br>
In order to evaluate expression of Plectasin in S. cerevisiae, two different plasmid constructs, pHH3875 and pHH3875, were made. pHH3875 encodes the alpha-leader from S. cerevisiae fused to the mature Plectasin, Plectasin can be liberated from the alpha-leader and hence matured through a KEX2 cleavage sequence, pHH3876 encodes the alpha-leader fused to the pro-region of Plectasin followed by the mature Plectasin. in this construct, one KEX2 site is present between the alpha-leader and the pro-region of Plectasin, while another KEX2 site separates the pro-region of Plectasin with Plectasin itself.<br>
Construction of DHH3875 - alpha-leader/KEXZ/Plectasin<br>
The Plectasin gene was amplified in a standard PCR reaction using the primers pHH3875-Forw and pHH3875-Rev dashed below. The Aspergillus parsing pMT2548 from example 2 was used as DNA template in the PCR reaction. The resulting DNA fragment was puffier using Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qigong) and restricted with Xbal and Clal which cut in the overhangs introduced by the primers. The fragment was further purified from a 2% a arose gel and lighted into a S, cerevisiae expression vector also restricted with Xbal and Clal, This 2^ based E. co/i/yeast shuttle vector employs the constitutive tips promoter to drive the expression of the alpha-leader/plectasin fusion, uses beta-lactamase for phenotypic selection in £ coii, and carries the POT gene for plasmid selection in the Atpi yeast (MT663; a/o, Atpi/Atpi. pep4-3/pep4-3).<br>
Construction of DHH3876 - aipha-leader/KEX2/pro-reqion/KEX2/Plectasin<br>
The protocol for construction of pHH3876 is identical to that of pHH3875 except for the DNA primers employed. For pHH3875, the primers described below were used;<br>

Expression of Plectasin in S cerevisiae<br>
The plasmids pHH3902 (control), pHH3875 and pHH3876 were transformed into the S, cerevisiae strain MT633 using a lithium acetate protocol. Several transformants of pHH3902, pHH3875 and pHH3876 were selected, streaked on SC ground/agar (containing SC ground agar, 2% D-glucose, 0.02% threonin) plates and incubated at 30 degrees Celsius until colonies developed.<br>
To test expression, individual colonies were inoculated in 10 m! of liquid SC ground (containing SC ground, 2% D-glucose, 0,02% threonin), incubated under vigorous shaking at 30 degrees Celsius for 3 days. Supernatants were run on 16% Tricine gels (Novex) to give optimal separation in the low molecular weight area. In parallel, supernatants were concentrated from 500 microliter to 20 microliter using a microcon spin column with a MW cut¬off of 3kDa. All samples from pHH3875 and pHH3876 showed peptide bands of the expected size. The concentrated samples showed the most prominent bands.<br>
In order to obtain more detailed information, the supernatants were analyzed using a MALDI-type mass spectrometer {Voyager DE-Pro from Perseptive Biosystems).<br>
For pHH3875. a major peak was observed at masses 4410-4411, This is very close to the expected mass of 4402 for correctly produced and processed Plectasin,<br>
For pHH3876, several peaks were observed. The two most prominent peaks were found at masses 4411-4413 and 7870-7871. The 4411 peak again is in agreement with correctly processed plectasin. The peak at 7870 corresponds best to semi-processed Plectasin where the Pro-region is not cleaved from the Plectasin. Several breakdown products of presumably the 7870 peak were observed.<br>
Activity of Plectasin from pHH3875 and pHH3876<br>
The  supernatants  described   above were analyzed  in  a  radial  diffusion  assay  as<br>
described in Example 5.<br><br><br>
Surprisingly, pHH3876 yielded the largest inhibition zone indicating more product or product of higher activity as compared to pHH3875.<br>
HTP screening of Plectasin variants<br>
In order to further optimize the antimicrobial activity of Piectasin, a high throughput (HTP) assay for activity is desired. To set up such a system, yeast ceils containing the control plasmid, pHH3902, or the two Plectasin expression plasmids, pHH3875 and pHH3876, were grown up in 96 well microtiter plates. At a reasonable ceil density, either 5 or 20 microliter of the yeast culture were removed from the microtiter plate and used in a radial diffusion assay as described in Example 5. Again, clearing zones on the radial diffusion test plate were evident from the supernatants originating from the two Piectasin-producing strains, pHH3875 and pHH3876, As observed above, the clearing zones were larger for the supernatants originating from pHH3876, No clearing zones were observed from the control plasmid. This indicates that this simple HTP assay can discriminate between yeast cells expressing different levels of antimicrobial activities, and is feasible for screening Plectasin variants with desired activities.<br>

in order to evaluate inducible expression systems and the potential for setting up s HTP screening system for identifying Plectasin variants with improved bioactivity, inducible Expression vectors encoding Plectasin and pro-poetizing were constructed using pYES2.<br>
pYES2 (Nitrogen) is a 5.9 kb vector designed for inducible expression of recombining: Proteins and peptides in Saccharomyces cerevlsiae.

Three plasmids were constructed; a control plasmid, pYES-3902, and two plasmids encoding Plectasin, pHH3886 and pHH3887.<br>
As pYES2 is a non-fusion vector, the entire alpha-leader regions from pHH3902, pHH3875 and pHH3876 were PCR amplified in a standard PCR reaction.

The three plasmids, pYES-3902, pHH3886 and pHH3887 were transformed into yeast strain JG169, and plated on glucose (0.5%) / galactic (1.5%) containing plates. The glucose ensures formation of colonies of a suitable size and after depletion of the glucose, galactic ensures further growth, induction of transcription and corresponding production of Plectasin, After colonies had formed, a lawn (approx. 10^ cut) of an indicator strain. B. subtitles, was overlaid the colonies and the plates further incubated overnight. As seen with the other yeast plasmids described above, the yeast strain harboring the control plasmid did not result in a clearing zone, whereas pHH3886 and pHH3887 both gave rise to clearing zones. The largest clearing zones were observed with pHH3887 encoding Pro-plantain.<br>
