Unique Grading System For The Polished Diamonds<br><br><br>
2.  APPLICANT (S)<br>
(a) NAME<br>
: VENUS JEWEL, Registered Partnership Firm under Indian Partnership Act 1932.<br>

3.  PREMABLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br><br>
PROVISIONAL<br>
The       following  specification describes the invention.<br><br>
0      COMPLETE<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
1<br><br>
The said invention relates to a unique grading system for the polished diamonds. More specifically, the said invention includes thorough scrutiny of polished diamonds considering a total of 16 parameters. These parameters form the basis on which the diamonds are graded to achieve precise grading along with a rational price derivation of the polished diamonds.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Diamond is a natural product. No two diamonds are alike; each is a separate creation of nature. To evaluate the exact worth of a diamond, it needs to be graded or ranked.<br>
Polished diamonds are generally graded on the basis of its 4 Parameters namely Carat, Clarity, Color and Cut (known as 4C's) including other parameters like Polish, Symmetry etc. This system of grading polished diamonds is broad and extensive, and results in imprecise and inaccurate pricing of diamonds.<br>
Diamond being a natural product has a number of inherent distinct characteristics. As a result, grading polished diamonds only on the basis of 4 basic parameters is apparently insufficient. Realizing these insufficiencies, there was a need for a comprehensive grading system that would be an accurate indicator of quality and value estimation of diamond.<br>
Unique and path breaking, the present Grading system is a comprehensive and highly detailed grading system developed in-house by the applicant.<br>
For each and every diamond, the present invention specifies a total of 16 parameters including the 4C's, to offer consistent and detailed grading. Further critical sub-divisions of these 16 attributes not only accurately indicate<br>
2<br><br>
quality and value, but also enable rational and logical derivation of the precise price of each diamond - giving a new meaning to the words 'transparency' and 'consumer confidence'.<br>
With a view to offer more precise and detailed information of each diamond, the said system has been invented as a unique system for grading the polished diamonds. In the said invention, diamonds are graded using a total of 16 inherent parameters including the basic 4 C's.<br>
Evaluating diamond quality using the said invention not only enables precise and detailed grading, but also allows logical derivation of its rational price thereby ultimately leading to enhanced customer satisfaction.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION:<br>
In the said invention, a unique system for grading polished diamonds is provided by extending the grading parameters beyond the defined categories of regular grading, with each diamond being graded on the basis of 16 different grading attributes.<br>
The main objective of the said invention is to provide refined and superior quality diamond grading, allowing complete transparency in evaluating each diamond and selling. This grading system includes total 16 attributes, each being further divided into sub-grades, thereby offering precise and detailed grading of polished diamonds. This uniquely invented grading system is conceived and evolved considering all probable inherent characteristics of a diamond. As stated earlier, diamond being a natural product, contains numerous natural blemishes, impurities, inclusions, color shades etc. because of its natural and chemical composition. Identification of all these natural compositions and ranking them on a grading scale facilitates<br>
3<br><br>
precise and correct grade evaluation, ultimately deriving logical and rational pricing of every diamond. Therefore, this invention has led to diamond being precisely and justly adjudged, considering all its possible parameters. All 16 parameters that are evaluated and graded in the said unique system for<br>
grading polished diamonds are as below:<br><br>
	Grades	Other Labs	Present Invention<br>
1	Carat	Mostly 2nd decimal	Upto 3rd decimal<br>
2	Clarity	12	31<br>
3	Color	28	74<br>
4	Color shade (Hue)	6	17<br>
5	Cut	6	6<br>
6	Polish	4	4<br>
7	Symmetry	5	5<br>
8	Luster	0	10<br>
9	Fluorescence	5	5<br>
10	Fluorescence Color	4	5<br>
11	Table inclusion	0	4<br>
12	Black inclusion	0	4<br>
13	Inclusion Pattern	0	5<br>
14	Internal Graining	0	4<br>
15	Open inclusion	0	7<br>
16	Culet	7	5<br>
All the above-mentioned 16 parameters are graded in minute detail for each diamond. This enables accurate description of each diamond and its parameters leading to precise valuation and pricing of individual diamond. The resulting transparency from such highly detailed and precise grading leads to confidence generating and well-informed purchase decisions. In comparison to a conventional grading system, which usually has master stones for grading<br>
4<br><br>
color and / or clarity, m the said invention more than 350 criteria specific master stones are used for grading each of the 16 parameters.<br>
In the said invention, experienced graders are deployed for grading diamond parameters. In this unique grading system, a single diamond is checked by at least two independent graders. Difference of opinion (if any), is settled by a senior grader.<br>
Using this grading system, has implemented multiple levels of quality checks at every stage of manufacturing and grading of diamonds, thereby eliminating the possibility of errors and ensuring accuracy, reliability, consistency and increased efficiency.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS:<br>
The foregoing summery, as well as the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the said invention, will be better understood when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The said unique system of grading polished diamonds comprises of different steps, and every diamond passes through all these stages for multiple checking and final grading. Step-lCut Grading &amp; Internal Graining<br>
1.0     Grading Carat (weight) of diamonds:<br>
1.0.1   Brief description of Carat (weight) in diamonds:<br>
The weight of a diamond is measured in 'Carats' and 'cents' with 100 cents equaling 1 Carat. In the metric system, 1 Carat roughly equals 0.200 grams and is entirely different from 'Karat' used to indicate the purity of Gold. 1.0.2   Brief Description of measuring Carat (weight) of diamonds:<br>
Diamond weight is stated on the individual diamond packets when they reach the cut checkers. However, the cut checkers have to weigh the stone on highly sensitive electronic 'carat' balances and re-affirm the weight / carat of each and every diamond they assess. 1.0.3   Present invention as compared to other recognized Laboratories:<br>
Conventional organizations specify weight / carats only up to the second decimal digit. Also, the third decimal digit is rounded off to the nearest higher digit as per the standard norms. In the said unique system<br>
6<br><br>
of grading polished diamonds, carat / weight of each and every diamond is specified up to the third decimal digit, even if it is 0.<br><br>
Grade	Present invention	GIA	AGS	HRD    !	IGI1.12	EGL1.123<br>
CARAT j	1.123	1.12   {	1.123	1.12		<br>
1.0.4   Significance of assessing Carat (weight) of diamonds:<br>
Across global markets, diamond prices are always stated in terms of per carat rate. Also, since diamond is quite an expensive commodity, a fluctuation of 1 or 2 cents in the weight will cause fluctuations in price also. Although this may not be a significant figure for smaller diamonds, in the bigger sizes (i.e. above 1 carat) this represents a substantial amount. Specifying weight up to the third decimal digit as in the said unique system for grading polished diamonds, offers crystal clear transparency regarding the pricing of individual stone as well as the factors giving rise to price differences between two similar looking diamonds. Step 1.1 - Grading Cut of diamonds<br>
1.1.1   Brief Description of Cut of diamonds:<br>
Cut refers to the angles and proportions a skilled craftsman creates in transforming a rough diamond into polished. Based on scientific formulas, a well-cut diamond will internally reflect light from one mirror-like facet to another and disperse and reflect it through the top of<br>
7<br><br>
the stone. This results in a display of brilliance and fire. Diamonds that are cut too deep or too shallow lose or leak light through the side or bottom, resulting in less brilliance (fire) and ultimately value.<br>
1.1.2	Brief Description of Cut Grading process:<br>
Polished diamonds are firstly passed to the Cut checkers consisting of 3 categories CT1, CT2 and CT3 as shown in Fig 2 for thorough checking wherein the Cut, Symmetry and Polish are checked and graded.<br>
1.1.3	Present Invention as compared to other recognized laboratories: -<br>
The below mentioned table describes invented extensive cut grading of diamond in comparison with other Gemological laboratories GIA (Gemological Institute of America), AGS (American Gem Society), HRD (HOGE RAAD VOOR DIAMANT), IGI (International Gemological Institute) and EGL (European Gemology Laboratories).

1.1.4 Significance of Cut in grading diamonds:<br>
The higher or better the cut of a diamond, the higher price it can fetch. A<br>
higher / better cut indicates the overall quality of a diamond by signifying the<br>
workmanship as well as precision and accuracy with which a diamond has<br>
been manufactured. Cut is one of the major factors influencing the price of<br>
polished diamonds.<br>
Step 1.2 - Grading Internal Graining of Diamond;<br>
1.2.1   Brief Description of Internal Graining of Diamonds:<br>
Internal Graining is a term describing naturally occurring clusters ofjines (if any), indicating irregular crystal growth formed within a diamond as a result of the extreme pressure and temperature conditions prevailing during formation. These line like structures usually transparent and invisible to the naked eye affect the purity and hence the price of high purity diamonds.<br>
1.2.2   Brief Description of grading Internal Graining:<br>
14<br><br>
Polished diamonds are visually examined by cut checkers for internal graining and if required the diamonds are compared with the relevant master stones, from a set of more than 350 master stones as shown in Fig. 3-6. In the said system of grading polished diamonds, the grades for internal graining are as follows:<br>
•	GO for No internal graining<br>
•	Gl for Light internal graining<br>
•	G2 for Medium internal graining and<br>
•	G3 for Heavy internal graining<br>
1.2.3   Present Invention as compared to other recognized Laboratories:<br><br>
Grade|	Present Invention	GIA	AGS I	HRD	IGI	EGL<br>
GO	YES	N.G.	N.G.	N.G.	N.G.	<br>

G3	YES	N.G.	N.G.	N.G.	N.G.	N.G.<br>
Note: YES = Grading is done, N.G. = Not graded<br>
NOTE: Other labs do not grade "internal graining" separately. It is mentioned as a part of the comments only if the stone has internal graining. We also grade the level of internal graining as (GO, Gl, G2 &amp; G3) which is not so with the other labs.<br>
1.2.4   Significance of grading Internal Graining:<br>
15<br><br>
Although Internal Graining may not be visible to the naked-eye unless very heavy, it affects the overall beauty of the diamonds and thereby influences the price. Grading internal graining informs customers of details which usually are not visible to the naked eye but do affect the beauty of the diamond &amp; hence the price. This offers transparency and complete information to customers, allowing them to take informed and confident purchase decisions. 1.3 - Grading Polish of Diamonds;<br>
1.3.1	Brief Description of Polish of diamonds:<br>
Polish is the surface shine of each individual crown, pavilion and table facet on a diamond. The better the polish, the better will be the reflection of light from the facets which results in the diamond sparkling when incident light bounces off the surface of the diamond.<br>
1.3.2	Brief Description of grading Polish in diamonds:<br>
The cut checkers visually examine polished diamonds for detecting polishing lines which may have formed on facets while polishing / shining the diamond. These usually appear like clusters of fine lines and on account of generally being transparent, are not visible to the naked eye. If required, diamonds are compared with the relevant master stones from a set of more than 350 master stones, as shown in Fig. 3-6. In the said system of grading polished diamonds, the designated grades for Polish are as follows:<br>
?	EX - indicates Excellent Polish<br>
?	VG - indicates Very Good Polish<br>
?	GD - indicates Good Polish<br>
16<br><br>
♦  FR - indicates Fair Polish<br>
 1.3.3   Present Invention as compared to other recognized Laboratories:<br><br>

FR	YES	YES	YES	YES	YES	YES<br>
Note: YES = Grading is done, N.G. = Not graded<br>
1.3.4   Significance of grading Polish in diamonds:<br>
The better the polish of a diamond, the better will be its sparkle or scintillation. In other words, polish is responsible for giving the stone an overall beautiful and attractive look. Since better polish results in a better stone, it affects the pricing of diamonds.<br>
1.4 - Grading Symmetry of Diamonds;<br>
1.4.1	Brief Description of Symmetry in diamonds:	<br>
Symmetry indicates the preciseness and the level of craftsmanship with which a diamond has been produced. The better the symmetry, the more perfect and well aligned all facets are, with each other, ultimately leading to a superb looking and more sparkling diamond.<br>
1.4.2	Brief Description of grading Symmetry in diamonds:<br>
Cut checkers visually assess the diamond as well as check measurements of the table and individual crown and pavilion facets.<br>
17<br><br>
The combined result of the measured symmetry and the visual symmetry is then graded as the overall symmetry of diamonds. In the said unique system of grading polished diamonds, the designated grades for Symmetry are as follows;<br>
?	EX - indicates Excellent symmetry<br>
?	VG - indicates Very Good symmetry<br>
?	GD - indicates Good symmetry<br>
?	FR - indicates Fair symmetry<br>
?	PR - indicates Poor symmetry<br>
1.4.3   Present Invention as compared to other recognized Laboratories:<br>

Note: YES = Grading is done, N.G. = Not Graded<br>
1.4.4   Significance of grading Symmetry in diamonds:<br>
Better symmetry clearly indicates that a diamond has been manufactured not only with the utmost care, but also with a high level of precision and accuracy. Better the symmetry; better is the light behavior of a diamond. Obviously, better the light behavior, more attractive the diamond and higher will be its price. Additionally, grading symmetry in detail enables customers to assess a diamond's overall beauty in the true sense, before buying.<br>
18<br><br>
1.5 - Grading Culet of Diamonds;<br>
1.5.1	Brief Description of Culet in diamonds:<br>
The vertex or the bottom most point of the diamond where all the facets meet is known as the culet. At times, artisans may decide to polish the culet as a facet thereby making it octagon shaped (like the table) instead of converging at a point.<br>
1.5.2	Brief Description of grading Culet in diamonds:<br>
The cut checkers visually assess polished diamonds to judge the culet and depending on the size of the culet (if it has been polished as a facet), grade the culet. If required, the diamonds are compared with the relevant master stones from a set of more than 350 master stones, as shown in Fig 3-6.<br>
In the said unique system of grading polished diamonds, the designated grades for Culet are as follows:<br>
?	NN - Indicates Culet is pointed<br>
?	VS - Indicates a Very Small open culet<br>
?	SM - Indicates a Small open culet<br>
?	MD - Indicates a Medium open culet<br>
?	LG - Indicates a Large open culet<br>
?	VL - Indicates a Very Large Culet<br>
?	EL - Indicates an Extra Large Culet<br>

Note: Yes = grading is done, N.G. = Not Graded<br>
NOTE: We supply polished goods with certain quality only. We do not manufacture low quality goods and hence we do not have grades like VL= Very Large &amp; EL= Extra Large for culet.<br>
1.5.4   Significance of grading Culet in diamonds:<br>
Open culets are not preferred by many customers and affect the beauty of the stone. Also, these are not easily detectable and can be covered up by capable artisans. Grading culet in detail as in the said unique system for grading polished diamonds allows customers' information, which they can utilize in taking appropriate purchase decisions. <br>
Step-2Grading Color and Color Hue of Diamonds<br>
2.1      Grading Color of Diamond:<br>
2.1.1   Brief Description of Color of diamonds:<br>
Natural Diamonds consist of Carbon atoms, which are colorless in nature. However, during formation of diamond crystals in the earth's surface, atoms of elements like Nitrogen, Boron etc. may form chemical bonds with the Carbon atoms thereby giving a natural yellowish or<br>
20<br>
bluish color. The higher the presence of these atoms the deeper is the color.<br>
2.1.2	Brief Description of Color grading process:<br>
Following  step-1, polished diamonds pass to the  Color checkers<br>
consisting of 2 categories COl and C02 for thorough checking as<br>
shown in Fig. 2 and subsequently through MCI, MC2 &amp; M09 as shown<br>
in Fig.7. According to the said invention, diamonds are given the color<br>
grade after comparing them with the relevant master stones from a set<br>
of more than 350 master stones as shown in Fig 3 to 6.<br>
This  multiple and thorough color checking ensures accurate and<br>
consistent color grading.<br>
The color grades designated in the said invention of unique grading<br>
system for polished diamonds are as follows:<br>
?	D color grades - Exceptional White diamonds<br>
?	E, F color grades - Rare White diamonds<br>
?	G, H color grades - White colored diamonds<br>
?	I, J color grades - Off white colored diamonds<br>
?	K, L color grades- Light tinted colored diamonds<br>
?	M, N - Tinted colored diamonds<br>
?	O - Fancy faint colored diamonds<br>
?	P color grades - Fancy light colored diamonds<br>
?	Q color grades - Fancy colored diamonds<br>

2.1.4 Significance of grading Color in diamonds:<br>
The color of a diamond is a major factor influencing the price of polished diamonds. The higher (whiter) the color, the more will be the price. In other words, a higher color indicates a diamond, which is more or less colorless, whereas a lower color implies a diamond may have a yellowish color. The lower the color, the more yellow a diamond will be.<br>
 Step 2.2        Grading Color Hue of Diamond:<br>
2.2.1	Brief Description of Color Hue in Diamonds:<br>
At times, the additional atoms apart from Carbon in the diamond lattice cluster together to form 'color centers'. These radiate a deeper shade all across the diamond, giving it a Hue or Tint. Additionally, impurities within the diamond may also impart a tint or shade to a diamond, despite it being of a higher color.<br>
2.2.2	Brief Description of Color Hue Grading Process:<br>
24<br><br>
In the said invention, diamonds are graded beyond the normally recognized colors by segregating on the basis of Color Hue or shade also. 2.2.3   Present Invention as compared to other recognized laboratories:<br><br>

2.2.4   Significance of grading Color Hue of diamonds:<br>
Grading Color Hue / Shade enables more accurately differentiating diamonds, not only simply on the basis of their color, but also on the shade they have. As a result, a rational and logical price can be arrived at.<br>
25<br><br>
Step-3   Grading of Fluorescence and Fluorescence Color; 3.1      Grading Fluorescence of Diamonds;<br>
3.1.1	Brief Description of Fluorescence in diamonds:<br>
When exposed to ultraviolet light, natural diamonds exhibit a deep blue glow, which vanishes as soon as the ultraviolet light is turned off. This blue glow is a natural occurrence as a result of the chemical reaction between the ultraviolet light and the carbon and other atoms in the diamond, and is known as Fluorescence. A very high fluorescence reduces the brilliance of a diamond.<br>
3.1.2	Brief Description of Fluorescence grading process:<br>
The fluorescence checker visually examines each diamond by placing it in a box fitted with an ultraviolet light source and grades fluorescence according to the brightness of the diamond's glow. If required, the diamond is compared with the relevant master stones from a set of more than 350 master stones as shown in Fig 3 to 6. In the said invention of unique system for grading polished diamonds, the Fluorescence grades allotted are as follows:<br>
•	FLO - indicates No Fluorescence<br>
•	FL1 - indicates Faint Fluorescence<br>
•	FL2 - indicates Medium Fluorescence<br>
•	FL3 - indicates Strong Fluorescence<br>
•	FL4 - indicates Very Strong Fluorescence<br>

3.1.4 Significance of Fluorescence grading:<br>
The higher the fluorescence in a diamond the lower will be its brilliance or 'fire'. Therefore, a diamond with low or no fluorescence will fetch a higher price as compared to one with a higher fluorescence. 3.2     Grading Fluorescence Color of Diamonds:<br>
3.2.1	Brief Description of Fluorescence Color in diamonds:<br>
Depending upon the presence of other atoms like Boron, Nitrogen and other physical impurities which may be present along with the carbon atoms in a diamond, and their respective reactions to ultraviolet light, fluorescence can be of different colors like blue, white, yellow, orange, green etc.<br>
3.2.2	Brief Description of Fluorescence Color grading process:<br>
The Fluorescence checker visually judges and grades the color of the fluorescence emitted by a diamond when placed under an ultraviolet light source in the designated viewing box. If required, polished diamonds are compared with the relevant master stones from a set of<br>
27<br><br>
more than 350 master stones as shown in Fig 3 to 6. In the said invention of unique system for grading polished diamonds, the designated Fluorescence Color grades are as follows:<br>
•	BL - Blue Fluorescence<br>
•	YL - Yellow Fluorescence<br>
•	WH - White Fluorescence<br>
•	OR - Orange Fluorescence<br>

3.2.4   Significance of Fluorescence Color Grading:<br>
Similar to fluorescence, fluorescence color also has an effect on the brilliance or 'fire' of the diamond, with a lighter fluorescence color like white or blue, not affecting the brilliance as much as the other colors like, orange, yellow, green etc. Step-4Grading Purity / Clarity of diamonds:<br>
4.1      Grading Purity of Diamonds:<br>
4.1.1   Brief Description of Purity of Diamonds:<br>
28<br><br>
Since diamonds are formed by solidification of molten lava within the earth's surface, other particles or elements may get entrapped within the crystal. The size, color and concentration of these impurities or entrapped elements decide the clarity or purity of a diamond. The lesser / lower the number of inclusions; the better is the clarity or purity. 4.1.2  Brief Description of Purity Grading Process:<br>
After step-3 the diamond is passed to Purity checkers consisting of 3 categories P01, P02 and P03 as shown in Fig. 2 and final checking at MOl, M02 &amp; M09 as shown in Fig.7 At this stage, the clarity / purity is graded by summing up the effect of inherent characteristics of diamonds such as Black Inclusions, Table Inclusions, Inclusion Pattern, Luster and Open Inclusions. Each of these are individually assessed and graded as part of clarity / purity grading by comparing it with the relevant master stones from a set of more than 350 master stones shown in Fig. 3-6.<br>
In the said invention of unique grading system for grading polished diamonds, the clarity / purity grades designated are as follows;<br>
•	FL - Flawless<br>
•	IF - Internally Flawless<br>
•	WS1 = Very Very Slightly Included 1<br>

4.1.4   Significance of grading Clarity in Diamonds:<br>
32<br><br>
Further sub-division of the standard clarity grades, using the '+' and the '-' symbols to indicate 'better than standard' and 'lower than standard' enables precise and in-depth classification of the exact clarity / purity grade of polished diamonds. Clarity / purity is another of the major factors influencing the price of polished diamonds. The above described clarity / purity grading through the said invention enables accurately pinpointing the true quality of a diamond and thereby allows logical and rational derivation of prices of individual diamonds. 4.2     Luster Grading of Diamond:<br>
4.2.1	Brief Description of Luster in Diamonds:<br>
When light enters into a diamond from its crown (top) side, some of it is reflected back directly from the surface of the stone, whereas some is reflected back from within the diamond as a result of the angles of its pavilion (bottom) facets. The effect of this reflected light as seen by a viewer is known as Luster. In common parlance this is also referred to as brilliance, sparkle or fire.<br>
4.2.2	Brief Description of the Luster grading process:<br>
The purity checkers are also responsible for grading the luster of the polished diamonds they examine. The luster of a diamond is decided by analyzing the brightness of the reflected light and if required, also comparing it with the relevant master stones from a set of more than 350 master stones shown in Fig. 3-6. In the said invention of unique grading system for grading polished diamonds, the luster grades designated are as follows;<br>
•   EX - indicates Luster is 'Excellent'<br>
33<br><br>
•	VG - indicates Luster is 'Very Good'<br>
•	GD - indicates Luster is 'Good'<br>
•	FR - indicates Luster is 'Fair'<br>

4   Significance of grading Luster in diamonds:<br>
A higher luster indicates a diamond, which will look more bright and attractive. A diamond may have been cut well, but the luster may not be too good. This will lead to it appearing slight dull and lifeless as compared to one with a high luster. Grading luster in detail as in the said unique system for grading polished diamonds, allows logical and rational pricing. At the same time it enables customers to take well-informed buying decisions.<br>
34<br><br>
4.3   Grading Level of Milkiness of Diamond;<br>
4.3.1	Brief Description of Milkiness in diamonds:<br>
At times, due to some semi transparent / translucent impurities present inside diamonds and / or due to very heavy fluorescence the diamond appears to have a 'milky' look, which also reduces the luster.<br>
4.3.2	Process of Grading Milkiness of diamond:<br>
Since 'Milkiness' dulls the luster of a diamond, therefore, it also is judged visually and graded by the purity / clarity checkers. If required, comparison with the relevant master stones from a set of over 350 master stones shown in Fig. 3-6 is also done. In the said invention of unique grading system for grading polished diamonds, the grades designating for 'level of Milkiness' are as follows,<br>
?	ML 1-Very Slightly Milky<br>
?	ML 1.5- Slightly Milky<br>
?	ML2- Medium Milky<br>
?	ML2.5 - Medium to Heavy Milky<br>
?	ML3 - Heavy Milky<br>
?	ML3.5 - Very Heavy Milky<br>
?	ML4 - Strong Milky<br>
4.3.3	Present Invention as compared to other recognized laboratories:<br>
This parameter is not graded by most of the laboratories across the world.<br>
4.3.4	Significance of grading Level of Milkiness in diamonds:<br>
35<br><br>
'Milkiness' in a diamond negatively affects the brilliance or luster of a diamond. Since, the brilliance is a preference of most customers while buying diamonds, therefore grading 'level of milkiness' allows logically deriving the rational price of each individual diamond. 4.4      Grading Table Inclusion of Diamond:<br>
4.4.1	Brief Description of Table Inclusion in diamonds:<br>
Natural inclusions or impurities referred to in the explanation for clarity above, if trapped in the table, i.e. the octagonal flat surface on the top of the diamond, are referred to as Table Inclusions. These may be within the diamond or near the surface but can be seen clearly from the table.<br>
4.4.2	Brief Description of grading Table Inclusion in diamonds:<br>
The purity checkers are responsible for visually examining polished diamonds for table inclusions. These are then graded as a percentage of the total inclusions in the crown. If required, these are compared with the relevant master stones, from a set of more than 350 master stones shown in Fig. 3-6. In the said invention of a unique system for grading polished diamonds, the grades designated for table inclusion are as follows;<br>
•	TO - Almost Table Clean<br>
•	Tl - Minor Inclusions in Table<br>
•	T2 - Medium Inclusions in Table<br>
•	T3 - Major Inclusions in Table<br>

4.4.4   Significance of grading Table Inclusion in diamonds:<br>
A diamond may have numerous inclusions within it and these may at times be extremely fine to be visible by the naked eye. Many a times, customers have preferences for stones, which should be table clean as per their requirements or requirements of their downstream customers. Grading table inclusions therefore allows easy selection of stones.<br>
 4.5     Grading of Black Inclusion in Diamond:<br>
4.5.1	Brief Description of Black Inclusions in diamonds:<br>
Black Inclusions are inclusions entrapped within a diamond and appear black in color. In common parlance these are also referred to as "Natts".<br>
4.5.2	Brief Description of grading Black Inclusionss in diamonds:<br>
The purity / clarity checkers visually examine polished diamonds for Black Inclusion and determine their grade by assessing their content as a percentage of the total inclusions in the diamond. If required, they are compared with the relevant master stones from a set of master stones<br>
37<br><br>
shown in Fig. 3-6. In the said unique system for grading polished diamonds; the designated grades for Black Inclusion are as follows;<br>
•	NO - Almost No Inclusions Black<br>

Grading Black Inclusions in detail as in the said unique system for grading polished diamonds allows logical and rational pricing of each individual diamond as well as offers customers easy and hassle free selection of goods.<br>
38<br><br>
4.6     Grading of Inclusion Pattern;<br>
4.6.1	Brief Description of Inclusion Pattern in diamonds:<br>
Inclusion Pattern describes the density of inclusions in diamond. Inclusion Pattern indicates how densely are the inclusions located within the diamond i.e. whether they are concentrated or clustered together, scattered a little bit or highly scattered within the diamond.<br>
4.6.2	Brief Description of grading Inclusion Pattern in diamonds:<br>
Purity / Clarity checkers visually examine polished diamonds and assess the density of the inclusions in the diamonds. If required, diamonds are compared with the relevant master stones from a set of more than 350 master stones shown in Fig. 3-6.<br>
In the said unique system for grading polished diamonds, the designated grades for inclusion pattern are as follows;<br>
•	SI - Scattered Inclusions<br>

It also allows customers to select stones according to their preferences or as specified by their downstream customers.<br>
4.7     Grading Open Inclusion in Diamonds;<br>
4.7.1	Brief Description of Open Inclusion in diamonds:<br>
'Opens' are inclusions formed in diamonds due to the high pressure and temperatures generated while polishing diamonds. In other words, these can be called 'stress fractures' and they resemble 'pits' on the diamond's surface. These can be present in the table, crown or pavilion of the polished diamonds.<br>
4.7.2	Brief Description of grading Open Inclusion in diamonds:<br>
Clarity / purity checkers visually examine polished diamonds to detect 'opens' and grade them according to their size and location within the stone.<br>
40<br><br>

4.7.4   Significance of grading Open Inclusion in diamonds:<br>
Detailed grading of open inclusions as in the said unique system for grading polished diamonds allows just and rational pricing of each diamond. Additionally, it allows customers as well as their further customers downstream to take well informed and logical purchase decisions.<br>
42<br><br>
*<br>
Step-5: Checking Authenticity of diamonds<br>
5.1	Checking on the DiamondSure:<br>
After thorough checking of all the 16 parameters graded in the said unique system of grading polished diamonds, to assess the authenticity of the supplied diamonds being natural, all diamonds are passed through the Diamond Sure. This is a machine devised by the Diamond Trading Company (DTC) and it uses ultraviolet spectroscopy to analyze diamonds.<br>
The above said instrument basically detects diamond types. Detecting diamond type is important to detect against threats from Synthetic or Cultured diamonds. Only specific types of diamonds can be treated artificially to alter their properties and the said instrument indicates whether a diamond could probably be a synthetic or treated diamond. The said machine also suggests broadly the kind of further in-depth analysis required to ascertain the authenticity of relevant diamonds.<br>
5.2	Checking on the DiamondView:<br>
Depending on the result indicated by the DiamondSure described in 5.1 above, the relevant stones are further examined in detail on the Diamond View. This instrument is also, manufactured by the Diamond Trading Company (DTC) and uses highly advanced ultraviolet spectroscopy methods to scrutinize polished diamonds in greater detail. The operator along with a team of technical personnel, consult and decide on the basis of the results obtained. If required, the results are<br>
43<br><br>
discussed with the Diamond Trading Company's research centre in<br>
England.<br>
Step-6:	Final Measurement:<br>
In the last stage, before polished diamonds are finally dispatched to the sales office, each diamond passes through the Final Measurement (FME) stage wherein their weight is measured and dimensions are re-checked and re-verified. Diamond weight is measured in 'Carats' and 'cents' with 100 cents equaling 1 Carat. In the metric method, 1 Carat equals roughly 0.200 grams and is entirely different from 'Karat' used to indicate the purity of Gold. In other words, a 5 Carat diamond would weigh only 1 gram.<br>
In the said invention, carat weight of each and every diamond is specified up to the 3rd decimal digit, thereby maintaining a very high level of precision and accuracy. Most of the gemological laboratories do not specify diamond weight up to the 3rd decimal digit.<br>
Hence the said invention of grading system provides the accurate weight of a diamond.<br>
 Overall benefits of the said unique system for grading polished diamonds:<br>
Diamond prepared after frequent and thorough checking at various stages and further graded under the said unique grading system is highly accurate in terms of its parameters, which provides excellent quality product. Comprehensive details of cut, color and clarity make the process of buying diamonds much simpler and well informed. This becomes very useful for direct suppliers, diamond setters and end users in getting specific goods. Each diamond is packed in individual packing with description of all the parameters on it. Detailed and clear information of each diamond is given on the company website along with its stock status. Hence, the customers can place their order<br>
44<br><br>
right from their office or residence thereby saving considerable traveling time, energy and money. Benefits that emanate are: -<br>
