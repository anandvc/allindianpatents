Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates in generaJ to a method and system for the continuous preparation of gasoline, kerosene and diesel oil from waste plastics. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method and system for the continuous preparation of gasoline, kerosene and diesel oil, which comprises dehydrogenating and decomposing waste plastics, and then subjecting the resulting waste plastics to a fluid catalytic cracking, and which is particularly suitable for application in a small scale facility. The present invention allows a gasoline-based fraction to be obtained in high fraction, and also has advantages, particularly in the view of environmental protection and resource reclamation.<br>
Background Art<br>
Recently, the reclamation of waste plastics is of great interest throughout the world in the view of environmental protection and energy reclamation, and is studied in a variety of manners. As one field of such a waste plastic reclamation, the recovery of fuels from waste plastics is recognized.<br>
The conventional methods for the recovery of fuels from waste plastics mostly enable the production of kerosene, diesel oil and/or a mixture thereof. However, due to technical problems associated with a process and equipment, such as a pre-treatment of the waste plastic raw material, a cracking, a fractionation, and a refining, etc., there is no report for the production of gasoline, in particular for automobiles, using the waste plastics.<br>
Gasoline generally designates volatile, combustible liquid hydrocarbons obtained by the reforming distillation, polymerization, catalytic cracking, and alkylation, etc. of crude oil. In most countries, octane number, distillation property, and<br><br>
2<br>
allowable contents of harmful substances, such as lead or sulfur components, for gasoline, are provided under the law. in particular, the octane number and the distillation property are the most important quality standards of a fuel for an automobile internal combustion engine. Gasoline produced in an' oil refinary conforms to the quality standards provided under the law, by combining a low- or high-boiling fraction of a low or high octane number to a mixed product of a product from a Fluid Catalyst Cracking Unit (FCCU) and a product resulted from the reforming of a high-boiling fraction from the hydrocracking of naphtha produced in the atmospheric distillation of crude oil. For this reason, the use of waste plastic for production of gasoline is difficult to meet with the quality standardsâ€¢<br>
Waste plastics, that are polymers of a high molecular weight, have a problem in that, upon a simple thermal decomposition, they produce mainly a wax fraction, with little or no production of gasoline, kerosene, and light oil, due to a decomposition property thereof.<br>
Therefore, as solutions for the above problem, there are proposed thermal decomposition methods using a solid acid as a catalyst. A drawback with these methods is, however, that C1 to C3 waste gases, and a mixed oil fraction of C8 to C2- kerosene and diesel oil are mainly produced, while an oil fraction of 4 to 25 carbon atoms which is main component is not produced in a good yield. As a result, the reclamation of waste plastic is limited only to the mixed oil.<br>
In addition to this drawback, the above thermal decomposition method has another problem in that coke and polymeric materials, that are formed during the catalytic cracking of waste plastic melt, directly form a barrier to a catalyst surface, such that a serious catalytic poison phenomenon occurs, thereby reducing rapidly the catalyst activity. For this reason, a method is used in which simply thermally decomposed gaseous oil is partially cracked and isomerized by<br><br>
3<br>
passing the gaseous oil through a fixed bed reactor filled with a catalyst.  However, this method has a problem in that, since the temperature in the fixed bed is lower than that in the thermal decomposition, a reaction conversion is seriously limited.  Moreover, in this method, the regeneration and the replacement of the catalyst due to the catalytic poison phenomenon require significant cost, and are also very complicated. Owing to these disadvantages, this method is limited in  its  application  to  the  commercial  facility. Additionally,  this  method  is  relatively  low  in production of gasoline oil fraction, and thus was not believed to be suitable for the production of gasoline.<br>

Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawings  <br>
Other objects and aspects of the invention will be apparent from the following description of embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 is a flow chart schematically showing a continuous method according to the present invention; and<br>
Fig. 2 schematically shows a system according to the present invention.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The system according to the present invention adopts a continuous preparation manner, and has the constructional elements as follows:<br><br>
6<br>
First, a pre-treat ing and melting device of waste plastic raw material, and optionally, an impurity-removing device.<br>
Second, a first reactor serving to dehydrogenate while decomposing the waste plastic melt.<br>
Third, a second reactor serving to subject the dehydrogenated and decomposed waste plastic melt to a fluid catalytic cracking, thereby to produce a gasoline-based fraction at a relatively high fraction, a kerosene fraction, and a diesel oil fraction.<br>
Fourth, an Aspen fractionation column which can optionally included and has a process fluctuation--attentuating function for the efficient and exact separation.<br>

Sixth, a precipitation-separation tank which is optionally included and servesto remove a variety of additives contained in the gasoline-based fraction, the kerosene oil fraction and the diesel oil fraction, re3pectively, such that the additive contents are below a normal value provided under the law.<br>
Seventh, a blender that is optionally included and serves to provide a gasoline meeting wit-h the provisions under the law, by batchwise or continuously conducting the instrumental analysis of the gasoline-based fraction, and then by blending the oil fraction with a blend stock according to the obtained analysis result, to meet the octane number and distillation property of the oil fraction with the normal value provided under the law.<br>
The continuous method for the preparation of gasoline, kerosene, and diesel oil from waste plastics, according to the present invention, is advantageous in that the kerosene and diesel oil fractions, that were resulted from the fractionation of the catalytically cracked gaseous oil in the fractionating column, are rich in isomerized fraction, as they were already reformed to a significant level in the fluid catalytic<br><br>
7<br>
cracking step . For thi s reason, the keros ene and diesel fractions are decreased in freezing point and thus are not problematic in the transfer and storage in the winter season or a cold region having a relatively high frequency of use. In addition, they meet with the' quality standard of fuels.<br>
The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. For convenience of description, the reference to Fig. 1 will be made together with the reference to Fig.  2.<br>
Fig. 1 is a flow chart schematically showing a method for the continuous preparation of gasoline, kerosene and diesel oil according to an embodiment of the present invention, and Fig; 2 is a drawing schematically showing a system of the present invention. The description referring to the drawings will now be made in processing step order.<br>
First, a pret reatment is carried out which consist s of a crushing and sorting step, a melting step and an impurity-precipitating step. In the crushing and sorting step, collected waste plastics are crushed into a chip size for easiness of the transfer and melting, and impurities are sorted out and removed. The size of the crushed waste plastics is not critical to the present invention. The crushing rate of the waste plastics may be, for example, about 1000 kg waste plastics/hr, but it is, of course, varied depending on the scale of the crushing facility.<br>
Meanwhile , the term "waste plastics "as used he rein collectively mean natural and synthetic resins. The waste plastics preferably designate thermoplastics, but do not exclude thermosetting resins. More preferably, the waste plastics include, but are not limited   to,   polyethylene,   polypropylene,   and<br>
polystyrene, etc.<br>
Subsequently, in a melting step, the crushed waste plastics are transferred by a screw feeder 41 into raw material-melting devices 1 and 2 wherein the crushed and sorted waste plastics are melted. In an embodiment shown in Fig.2, the waste plastic melt is stirred with<br><br>
8<br>
a rotor 83 rotating with a motor 81 in a first melting device, while firstly melting the waste plastic chips. Then, the melt is dewatered to have a water content of about 10% or less, followed by elevating to 150 Â°C. After this, the melt is introduced into a second melting device 2 with a screw feeder 42, and further elevated to a temperature of about 340 to 360 Â°C to be secondly melted therein. The secondly melted waste plastics are introduced into a raw material melting tank 3. Earth and fine impurities, etc., that are precipitated on the bottom of the raw material melting tank, are eliminated from the system using a discharge screw 44.<br>
The waste plastic melt is melted, in the melting tank 3 such that it is completely homogeneous. In the impurity-precipitating step, the homogeneous waste plastic mixture is entered into a precipitating tank 5 by a rotary pump 51, which tank 5 is maintained at a temperature of about 340 Â°C to 360 Â°C and is slanted at its bottom. In the precipitating tank 5, earth and fine impurities, etc. are precipitated and removed. Meanwhile , the waste plastic melt being transferred with the rotary pump 51 is maintained at about 350 Â°C by compensating for lost heat with a heat from a first external circulating heater 4. If crushing rate of the waste plastics is, for example, as described above, the transfer rate of the melt is, .for example, about 5,000 liter/minute (LPM), but it can be also varied. Earth and fine impurities precipitated on the bottom of the precipitating tank 4 are eliminated with a discharge screw 43 from the system. The precipitating tank 5 may also be equipped with a heater (not shown)<br>
Next, a dehydrogenating and decomposing step (a first catalytic reaction step) is carriedout - In this step, the waste plastic melt, from which the impurities were removed by the above pretreatment step, is introduced into a first reactor at a constant flow rate (about 15 to 18 LPM for the above described crushing rate) through a meter ing pump 52 . The introduced waste plastic melt is brought into contact with a catalyst impeller 86 rotating with a motor 82 (preferably an<br><br>
9<br>
impeller made of nickel or nickel alloy) at a temperature of 350 Â°c to 370 Â°C, thereby being dehydrogenated and decomposed. Also, it i s preferred in view of reactivity and output to control impeller rpra/impeller/flow rate (for example, 180 rpm/8-blades-4 stage disk turbine/5 cm/mm upward flow, for the above crushing rate), such that the reaction segment for flow rate is below 10 to 20 Âµm. The residence time of the raw material in the first reactor is in the range of about 20 to 35 minutes.<br>
In particular, the impeller has preferably a multiple stage turbine blade type such that the waste plastic raw material flow is maintained at a plug flow. A baffle and a disc hole advantageously act as assistants for the maintenance of the plug flow.<br>
The nickel alloy catalyst conducts the dehydrogenation of the polymer at a high temperature, such as about 350 Â°C to 370 Â°C, and the cracking of the polymer at its weak points, simultaneously. In this step, as thermal cracking or catalytic cracking does not still in earnest occur, there occurs no catalytic poison problem by the formation of a barrier on the catalyst surface.<br>
By this dehydrogenation and decomposition step, the raw material is reduced in molecular weight to a level of 1/8 to 1/12,<br>
Supply of heat to the first reactor is carried out by an operation of a pump 53 with a second external-circulating heater 7. A heater 85 may also be installed outside of the first reactor 6.<br>
Subsequently, the waste plastic melt raw material, which was passed through the first catalytic reaction, i.e., the dehydrogenation and decomposition step, is subjected to a fluid catalytic cracking. The raw material being transferred by a high pressure pump 54 is intensively reacted with a catalyst introduced from a catalyst regenerator 8, in a narrow space inside of a fluid catalytic cracking pipe 10a, whose temperature is maintained at 500 Â°C to 550 Â°C. While reacting as such, the raw material is introduced into the fluid bed catalytic cracker 10 (a second reactor) at a pressure<br><br>
10<br>
of 10 kg/cm and a flow rate of about 15 to 18 LPH (for the above crushing rate) . The reaction of the raw material is completed in the fluid catalytic cracker 10, while the catalyst is dropped downwardly to the bottom of the fluid catalytic cracker. In this reaction, the raw material is instantly cracked upon contact with the catalyst, and then expanded by about 18 times in volume.  Simultaneously with this expansion, it is<br>
rapidly diffused into pores of the catalyst to be further cracked and isomerized.<br>
As the catalyst used in the above reaction, the conventional alumina silica (SiO2-AljO3) solid acid catalyst is preferred, but is not limited thereto. The low molecular weight gas, which was cracked at a temperature of about 500 Â°C to 550 Â°C, is in contact with the wide pore face inside of the catalyst, while being reformed and aromatized by the second reaction.<br>
The time, during which the raw material is passed through the fluid catalytic reactor, is determined depending on the diffusion velocity. Moreover, it is preferred that the catalyst is introduced downwardly from the upper portion, because it results in a significant reduction in equipment cost, and at the same time, is advantageous in making equipment smaller in size.<br>
The catalyst and the gaseous oil, that were passed through the fluid bed, are separated from each other in the second reactor 10. In so doing, it is preferred to control the heat balance and the material balance, such that 90s; or more of the raw material is finally cracked. Such a control will be obvious to a person skilled in the art.<br>
The portion of gaseous oil, which is not removed from the surface of the catalyst, is vaporized with the vaporization of steam produced from a steam generator 11 and supplied to the lower port ion of the second reactor 10 at a molar ratio of 148 . As a result, less than 10% of the gaseous oil remains non-vaporized.<br>
At a location spaced upwardly apart from the upper portion of the fluid catalytic cracker 10, as the second<br><br>
11<br>
reactor, there is disposed an exhaust gas<br>
pressure-controlling     means     93.	This<br>
pressure-controlling means serves to maintain always the pressure of the cracker 10 at a level higher than that of a lower portion (a portion communicated with the cracker) of a fractionating column 10, thereby preventing acountercurrent flow from the fractionating column 10.<br>
At a location spaced apart from the lower portion of the fluid catalytic cracker 10 as the second reactor, there is positioned an ejector (not shown) ejecting air at a pressure of about 5 kg/cm2. This ejector serves to send the catalyst particle being dropped downwardly in the cracker 10, to an external cyclone 90 communicated with a catalyst regenerator 8. From this external cyclone 90, the catalyst powders formed into a bridge are withdrawn into a storage vessel 91 and removed, whereas the remaining catalyst particles are introduced into the catalyst regenerator 8 at a temperature in the range of about 460 Â°C to 490 Â°C.<br>
Into the catalyst regenerator 8, air is introduced at a flow rate of 19.7 kg/mm (which is a rate according to a heat balance) for the case of the above crushing amount) and maintained at about 650 Â°C, while oxidizing all cokes remained in the catalyst. The circulating amount of the catalyst is determined depending on the heat balance . That is to say, there is no heating other than the initial heating. In the case of the above crushing rate, the circulating amount of the catalyst amount is about 100 to 105 liter/mm. Meanwhile, the control of temperature with no dependence on the heat and material balances either can result in a reduction in reactive efficiency in the fluid bed due to an incompletely regenerated catalyst or can result in a collapse phenomenon of the catalyst regenerator 8 due to a high temperature. The catalyst regenerator 8 can be made of Ni-Mo alloy, for example, such as Incolloy 800 HT which is commercially available.<br>
On the lower portion of the catalyst regenerator 8, there is disposed a grid having an obstruction<br><br>
12<br>
function, and connected to an air distributor . The grid and the air distributor are designed in such a manner that they can supply a pressure sufficient to cope with head of the catalyst regenerator 8. The grid has air holes that can be 1.5 mm in diameter and about 1,800 in number. At a location spaced apart from the upper portion of the catalyst regenerator 8, an external cyclone 90 and an exhaust gas pressure-control ling means 92 are arranged. The exhaust gas pressure-controlling means 92 serves to maintain the pressure in the catalyst regenerator 8 at a pressure level higher than that in the fluid catalytic cracker 10 and in the lower portion (the portion communicated with the cracker 10) of the fractionating column 12, thereby preventing a countercurrent flow from the fractionating column 12 and the catalytic cracker 10.<br>
Thereafter, a fractionating step is carried out. In this fractionating step, a gaseous oil vented from the upper portion of the first reactor 6 and a gaseous oil cracked and isomerized in the fluid catalytic cracker 10, as the second reactor, are subjected to a gas-liquid contact in the fractionating column 12. By this gas-liquid contact, the gaseous oils are separated into a kerosene fraction, a diesel oil fraction, and a gasoline-based fraction. With respect to this fractionating column a sta,ge number and a tray type are determined for the exact separation efficiency. In the case of the above crushing rate, a column having a diameter of 600 mm, a stage number of 21 and a bubble cap type can be used. The respective discharge lines have a pump and the respective fractions are controlled at an exactly calculated temperature. The kerosene fraction is controlled at temperature of 160 to 200 Â°C, the diesel oil fraction at 240 to 320 Â°C, and liquefied oil from the bottom of the fractionating column at 350 to 380 Â°C. The liquefied oil effluent from the bottom of the fractionating column 12 is returned to the first reactor 6 with a pump 61 while being maintained at a constant level in the fractionating column 12.<br>
The diesel oil fraction and the kerosene fraction<br><br>
13<br>
effluent from the lower portion and the middle portion of the fractionating column 12, respectively, are transferred as such with pumps 58 and 59 for a refining step.<br>
Meanwhile, the gasoline-based fraction effluent from the upper portion of the fractionating column 12 will be passed through a reforming step. The gasoline-based oil fraction is recycled in the fractionating column 12 by a reflux ratio, while being stored for the moment in a gasoline-based fraction-recycling tank 13 by a gas-liquid contact manner. Then, the bottom product from the tank 13 is recycled to the fractionating column 12 with a pump 51, and a collected gasoline-based fraction is condensed at 25Â°C and stored in a surge tank 14. A low-pressure gas vented from the upper portion of the surge tank 14 is transferred to a low-pressure gas collector (a liquid contactor) 23 to be separated therein.<br>
Meanwhile, the gasoline-based fraction from the surge tank 14 is transferred by a pump 61 to a preheater 15 wherein it is preheated to a temperature of 90 to 120 Â°C. Then, the preheated fraction is dispersed and stirred by a first super mixer 16 along with a reforming catalyst transferred from a reforming catalyst storage tank 95 through a pump 62, and thus is homogenized. Such homogenized mixture is isomerized, and introduced into a reforming reactor 17, as a third reactor, for example, at a flow rate of 8 to 12 LPM for the case of the above crushing rate.<br>
The reforming catalyst is a super acid catalyst, and preferably HCl, AlCl3 or SbCl3 and the gasoline-based fraction is blended with the super acid catalyst in a blending ratio of 1/50 to 1/100 by molar ratio. The super acid catalyst induces a double bond of the gasoline fraction at a temperature of about 90 to 120Â°C by a strong acid action, to convert the gasoline fraction to a secondary carbonium and then a tertiary carbonium, thereby leading the gasoline fraction to the isomerization. In this procedure, the conversion significantly depends on the dispersed degree of the<br><br>
14<br>
catalyst. However, too small particle size of the catalyst is problematic in that it increases a loss factor of the catalyst, and also results in the contamination of a product. As a result, the particle size and the separation time are in a close relation to each other.<br>
As the reforming step is proceeded under a strong acid condition, the third reactor 17 needs to be made of a corrosion resistance material. In the third reactor 17, the catalyst arid the reformed gasoline fraction are separated by specific gravity, and the separation time is determined from the calculated sedimentation velocity. The separation time is about 40 minutes for the case of the above crushing rate. The separated and precipitated catalyst is continued to circulate at a rate of 200 to 300 cc/mm and periodically replenished in loss fraction.<br>
An acid steam effluent from the third reactor 17, as the reforming reactor, is dissolved in water to be scrubbed, in an acid scrubber 21, and then transferred by a pump 66 to a neutralizing tank 22 wherein it is neutrali zed.<br>
Meanwhile, the gasoline-based fraction (the reformed fraction) as described above is passed through a cooler 18, and homogeneously mixed with water transferred via a pump 64 at a ratio of about 1:1, in. a super mixer 19.<br>
The homogenized mixture is left to stand and subjected to a phase separation in a first refining tank 20. Then, the lower aqueous layer, in which the acid is dissolved, is drained with a pump 68 and transferred into a neutralizing tank 22 and neutralized therein.<br>
Afterwards, a low-pressure gas separation step is carried out. In a low-pressure gas separation column 23, gases vented from the gasoline-based fraction-recycling tank 14 and from the upper portion of the first refining tank 20, and the reformed gasoline fraction transferred by a pump 67 from the oily layer in the first refining tank 20, are subjected to a gas-liquid contact, to be separated into a reformed oil<br><br>
15<br>
fraction and a gas. The separated gas is transferred to a knock-out tank 24, while the separated reformed oil fraction is transferred to an acid mixer 25 by a pump 69.<br>
Thereafter, the completely reformed oil fraction, as the gasoline-based fraction, and the kerosene and diesel oil fractions separated in the fluid catalytic cracking step are transferred to a first refining step.<br>
The  reformed  gasoline-based  fraction or  the fractionated  kerosene  and  diesel  oil  fractions, respectively, are condensed and mixed with an acid solution (e.g., a 1 to 2 molS sulfuric acid solution) transferred by a pump 70,  in the acid mixer 25. Following this, the mixture is transferred to a second refining tank 26, as a precipitation and separation tank, and then condensed and mixed with an alkaline solution {e.g.,  a  3  to  5 mo IS  sodium hydroxide solution) transferred by a pump 71, in an alkali mixer.  Next, the mixture is transferred to a third refining tank 28, as a precipitation and separation tank.  The used acid solution is disposed of after neutralizing, and the used condensed alkaline solution is reused after being purified.  The second and third refining tanks 26 and 28 are designed in such a manner that they can separate a three-phase  system to remove acid or alkaline condensate in middle and lower layers present beneath the oil fraction layer, as the upper layer, and having a variety of dissolved additives .  For example, a drain valve can be equipped with for the middle layer and the lower layer, respectively.<br>
The kerosene and diesel oil fractions, which were passed through the above refining step, are transferred to the respective storage tank (not shown) and stored as a final product therein. Alternatively, these fractions are stored via an additive-blending step and a second refining step as described below. The stored oil fractions are ready to useas fuel oil, respectively.<br>
Meanwhile, the first refined oil fraction, as the gasoline-based fraction, which was passed through the above refining step,  is stored in gasoline-based<br><br>
16<br>
fraction surge tanks 29 and 30. In the present invention, although the above surge tanks are not specifically limited in their number, the use of the plurality of surge tanks, such as two or more surge tanks, is preferred in view of a process efficiency when considering characteristics of the cont inuous process.<br>
The first refined oil fraction stored in the gasoline-based fraction surge tanks 29 and 30 is monitored. In this monitoring, the oil fraction is analyzed for its components with a suitable instrumental analysis means, such as gas chromatography. Depending on results of the monitoring, additives for the control of the octane number and the distillation property are blended with the oil fraction in a suitable ratio, thereby obtaining gasoline meeting with provisions under the law.<br>
Tanks, which can be established for the storage of the additives, include an antioxidant storage tank 31, storage tanks 32 and 33 for high-octane number additives,  such as a C4 light, high-octane number additive, and a C4 heavy, high-octane number additive, etc., a storage tank 34 for low-boiling point and low-octane number additives, such as light, low-octane number linear straight run C5- C7 saturated hydrocarbons, and light, low-octane number linear straight run C5-C n-paraffins,  etc.,  and a storage tank 35  for low-boiling point and high-octane number additives, such as methyl t-butylether, etc.<br>
Depending on the component analysis results of the<br>
first refined oil fraction, a desired amount of the first<br>
refined oil fraction is transferred to a blender 36 by<br>
a pump 77, while desired amount and kind of additives<br>
are transferred from the additive tanks 31, 32, 33, 34,<br>
and/or 35 to the blender 36 by the respective pumps 72,<br>
73, 74, 75 and/or 76. The transferred additives are<br>
blended with the first refined oil fraction in the<br>
blender 36, thereby making the oil fraction meet ing with<br>
provisions under the law.	<br>
Then, the blended gasoline from the blender 36 is sent to a second refining step.  For the second refinmg,<br><br>
17<br>
the blended gasoline is transferred to a fourth refining tank 37 and separated by specific gravity therein. The separated gasoline is filtered through a filter 38, after which the filtered gasoline is passed to an absorber filled with activated carbon in which it is decolorized. Next, the resulting gasoline is stored in a gasoline storage tank 40.<br>
In the method and system for the preparation of gasoline, kerosene, and diesel oil from waste plastics, polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene, etc. in the waste plastics are in principle introduced at a possible constant ratio, because a blending ratio of the polymers has an affect on a quality of products. In this regard, a blending receipt of the polymers is determined depending on analysis results. For reference, such a blend preparation step is also applied in the existing oil refineries, and is an essential process for the preparation of gasoline.<br>
Furthermore, blend stocks mount up to ten in their kind, and are suitably chosen case by case depending on a variety of parameters, such as seasons, and a blending ratio of the fed raw materials, etc. It is particularly important to add the blend stock in such a manner that the distillation property of products meets with the law. Where polystyrene resin is added at a great amount and thus, C7-C8 aromatic components are significantly contained, for example, it is preferred to decrease an adding amount of C9 aromatic component while blending a relatively large amount of C5 fraction, thereby controlling the octane number.<br>
The gasoline-based fraction, which was passed through the reforming step of the present invention, is about 85 to 90 in average octane number, but this average octane number can be increased to a level of 93 to 96 when the blend stocks are added.<br>
In addition, in the preparing method and system of the present invention, the treatment of 100 parts by weight of waste plastics, as the raw material, produces 39 to 42 part by weight of gasoline-based fraction, 9 to 12 parts of kerosene, fraction, 9 to 11<br><br>
18<br>
parts by weight of diesel fraction, 7 to 11 parts by weight of waste gas, and 8 to 11 parts by weight of waste components.<br>

As apparent from the above description, the present invention provides the method and system for the continuous preparation of gasoline, kerosene and diesel oil from waste plastics. Such method and system adopts the fluid catalytic cracking manner, in which the first catalytically reacted raw material and the catalyst particles are in contact with each other while moving downwardly, and includes the reforming with the circulating catalyst. Thus, the present invention exhibits a high conversion, while efficiently eliminating problems due to the catalyst poison phenomenon. Moreover, the present invention can commercially apply to a small scale facility, not to apply to a large scale facility. In addition, the present invention allows the gasoline fraction to be produced at a relatively high fr act ion, and also greatly contributes to waste resource reclamation and environmental protection.<br>
