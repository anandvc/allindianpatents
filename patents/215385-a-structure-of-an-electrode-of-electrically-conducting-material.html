				<td>The  present  invention  relates  to  a  structure  of  an electrode  for  use  as  an  anode/cathode  in  an  electrolytic cell  as  stated  in  the  preamble  of  the  following  patent claim  1.<br>
Further  the  invention  rel"ates  to  a  method  for  preparing said  electrode  structure.<br>
The  invention  also  relates  to  a  use  of  the  electrolytic cell   including  anode  and  cathode  as  mentioned  above.<br>
The  invention   relates  to  the   technology  concerning  the production  of  oxidants  and  radicals  which  are  used  to oxidising  and  eliminating  organic  material  in  liquids,   and organic  materials  on  particles  in  liquids,   and  for destruction  of  bacteria,   spores,   micro  organisms,   algae  and virus.<br>
Known  methods  in  use  today<br>
Today  anodes   (electrodes)   are  produced  by  the  use  of  elec¬trolytic  coating  a  substrate  with  thin  layers  of  precious (noble)   metals.   However  these  electrodes  have  a  particu-<br><br>
larly  short  lifetime  and  they  do  not  tolerate  being  exposed to  high  voltages  over  time.   If  they  are  exposed  to  high voltages   they  will  burn.   During  the  process  a  dissolving/-precipitation  occurs  from  the  anode  so  that  it  is  corroded.<br>
There  is  also  a  production  of  anodes  of  pure  metals  or alloys  of  such  metals,   and  which  do  not  belong  to  the precious  metal  group,   but"  these  are  quickly  corroded  in use,   they  do  not  produce  the  desired  oxidant,   nor  can  they be  exposed  to  the  desired  voltage.<br>
Another  lesser-known  method  in  use  today  involves  that tantalum,   iridium,   or  a  mixture  of  these  are  rolled  down  to between  0,015  and  0,035  mm  and  is  welded  to  a  core  for  an anode  which  is  made  of  titanium,   aluminium  or  copper.   By this  method  a  frictional  welding  is  used.  The  lifetime   for these  electrodes  is  longer  than  of  the  electrodes  that   are made  by  use  of  electrolysis.   They  tolerate  substantially higher  voltage  and  current.   With  these  advantages  in variables   for  electrolyses  process,   i.e.   voltages   from  0-380V  and  currents  from  0-1000  Amperes,   a  mixture  of oxidants   is  produced  including  a  very  high  reactivity, power  and  possibility  for*  functional  balancing  of  the single  oxidants   {CI2,   CIO3",   O3,   O2,  H2O2,   OH,   ClOH,   O) , exceeding  the  effect  of,   and  reduces  the  undesirable  effect of  oxidants   from  anodes  produced  by  other  methods.<br>
The  limitations  for  the  preparation  by  these  methods  are the  variation  span  in  the  mixture  of  alloys.   For  example  it is  known   that  platinum/iridium-alloys   (Pt/Ir)   including more  than  20%   iridium  is  difficult  to  roll  down  to  the desired  thickness.   Today  it  is  known  that  the  alloy  can  be rolled  down  to  33  micron   (0,033mm).   Higher  concentrations of  Ir  leads  to  even  greater  problems,   and  the  prepared   foil often  becomes  brittle.   It  is  also  desireable  that  the  foil<br><br>
have  a  high  degree  of  hardness  in  order  to  increase  the mechanical   resistance  to  wear  and  tear.   Further   the thickness  of  the  foil  is  decisive  in  determining  how  much of  certain  oxidants   is  produced  in  a  certain  liquid  with  a given  voltage  and  current.   It  is  further  known  that  for example  pure  platinum  technically  may  only  be  rolled  down to  15  micron   {0.015mm).   Below  this  thickness  it  is  not possible  to  obtain  a  dense  foil   (without  pores).<br>
Recently  methods   for  vacuum/plasma   spraying  of   tantalum  and precious  metals  according  to  the  abovementioned  method  have extended  the  potential  of. use  in  that  methods  for  spraying of  thinner  layers  have  been  developed,   and  at  the  same  time increased  the  variation  span  of  the  mixture  of  an  alloy with  100%  pore  density,   and  thus  the  specific  area  of  use has  been  extended.<br>
The  known  electrolytic  processes  in  its  simplest  form provide  CI2  as  an  oxidation  agent.   Further  oxidants   (CIO3", O3,   O2,   H2O2,   OH,   ClOH,   0)   are  however  far  more  chemically reactive,   and  are  provided  by  coating  a  substrate  with precious  metals  where  a  voltage  is  exposed  in  a  range  where the  law-of  Farraday  is  exceeded.<br>
Of  these  components  the  radicals  are  in  particular  the  most powerful  oxidation  agents,   both  with  regard  to  power  and non-desirable  side-effect,s   (haiogenated  compounds  of organic  material) .   The  problem  of  the  known  electrolytic processes  is  that  the  radicals  cannot  be  utilised  since they  have  a  lifetime  of  a  thousandth  of  a  second  and  are therefore  only  present  very  close  to  the  surface  of  the anode.   As  only  a  very  small  part  of  the  liquid  amount  that is  conducted  through  an  electrolytic  cell  makes  contact with  this  anodic  surface,   large  amounts  of  liquids  cannot effectively  be  exposed  to  radical  exposure  for  reaction<br><br>
with  organic  compounds,   bacteria,   virus  etc,   which  is desired  to  be  eliminated  from  the  liquid.<br>
Known  electrolytic  processes  form  hydrogen  at  the  cathode. Hydrogen  lowers  considerably  the  formation  of  oxidants  by the  anode  since  the  hydrogen  forms  water  when  it  comes  in contact  with  the  oxidant.   This  applies   in  particular  to  OH-radicals  in  contact  with  hydrogen.   The  hydrogen  gas  also reduces  the  conductivity  of  the  liquid  when  it   is  present in  the  voltage  field  between  the  anode  and  cathode,   and  in contact  with  the  anode.<br>
It  is  known  from  US  patent  6,328,875  that  electrolytic  cell designs  have  been  developed  with  anodes  /cathodes  made  of conductive  porous  elements  consisting  of  metal,   including noble  metals,   or  carbon  from  welded  or  woven  wire  cloth, expanded  metal  or  carbon  felt,   carbon  woven  cloth  or reticulated  vitreous  carbon  and  metallic  foam.   The  struc¬ture  includes  an  open  solution  where  the  effluent   is  passed in-between  a  spacer/anode  and  cathode  to  open  area   (open solution) ."  The  stack  is  clamped  together  and  anode/cathode are  separated,   mono  polar  or  bipolar,   by  spacer  to  prevent shortcut.   The  effluent  is  then  passed  in  parallel  with  the anode/cathode/spacer  in  the  process.<br>
Furthermore  it  is  known  that  US  patent  6,342,151  comprises anodes/cathodes  made  of  permeable  conductive  material selected  from  the  group  consisting  of  perforated  plates, screens,   wool,   felt  and  weave  made  of  stainless   steel, aluminium,   copper,   platinized  titanium,   mixed  metal  oxides, gold  and  gold  plated  steel.  Also  this  electrode  use  spacers to  prevent  shortcut  between  anode  and  cathode  when  distance between  said  components  are  small.<br><br>
It  is  well   known  that  spacers  increases  current  consumption in  an  electrolytic  process  and  reduces   flow  capacity through  the  electrode.<br>
It   is  also  well   known  that   fouling  due  to  scaling  caused  by Mg  and  Ca  content  in  the  affluent  treated  is  a  substantial problem  with  respect  to  electrolysis.   The  scaling  problem occurs  when  velocity  of  Mg  and  Ca  contained  effluent   (such as   sea  water)   is  passed  through  an  anode/cathode  reaction. If  the  velocity  of  the  effluent  is  too  slow,   a  bridge  of crystals  will  accelerating  be  built  between  anode  and cathode  causing  fouling  of  the  process.   Increasing  the velocity  in  such  extent  might  prevent  this  in  such  extent that  all  Mg  and  Ca  build  up  are  transported  away  before  it attaches  to  the  cathode.   Another  way,   provided  that  anode and  cathode  are  of  same  or  equal  reactive  material,   is   to alternate  the  polarity  of  the  anode  and  the  cathode regularly.   Then  scaling  burst  off  the  cathode  as   it  is reverted  to  anode.<br>
It  is  an  object  of  invention  to  provide  a  new  and  improved construction  of  the  electrode  that  eliminates  energy  losses due  to  need  of   spacer  and  still  allows  close  distance between  anode  and  cathode  without  risk  of  shortcut.<br>
It  is  an  object  of  the  invention  to  allow  large   flow vertical  through  the  electrode  while  maintaining  full effectiveness  of  the  electrolysis  in  order  to  prevent fouling  due  to  scaling.<br>
It  is  an  object  of  the  invention  to  provide  a  new  and improved  construction  of  an  electrode  to  be  used  to  prepare oxidants  as  mentioned  above,   for  example  Cl2,   CIO3,   O3,   O2 H2O2,    (OH),    (ClOH),    (0),   and  which  optimally  can  utilise the  radical  production  at  the  surface  of  the  anode.<br><br>
Further  it  is  an  object  of  invention  to  provide  a  new  an improved  construction  of  an  electrode  where  a  reduced oxidation  effect  due  to  hydrogen  interference  between  anode and  cathode,   and  on  the  cathode,   may  be  eliminated.<br>
It  is  further  an  object  of  invention  to  bring  substantially all   liquid  in  contact  with  an  area  close  to  the  anode  where the  radicals  are  produced,   and  where  radicals  have  a lifetime  of  some  thousands  of  second   (milliseconds).   As  the radicals  are  the  predominant  oxidation  agent,   also  with regard  to  non-desirable  side  effects  of  further  oxidation agents,   it  is  essential  for  inventiveness,   compared  with the  state  of  art  technology,   that  the  radical  effects  on the  materials  to  be  disinfected/oxidised,   are  considerably increased.<br>
It  is  also  an  object  of  the  invention  to  prepare  an  anode wherein  the  consumption  of  energy  is  considerably  reduced when  it  is  connected  to  a  circuit  according  to  the invention  in  relation  to  the  volume  of  liquid  to  be handled.<br>
It  is  also  an  object  of  invention  to  provide  a  new  and improved  method  in  which  it  is  possible  to  simply  prepare an  electrode  with  a  higher  performance  in  use  than  the previously  known  electrodes.<br>
Further  it  is  an  object  of  the  invention  to  provide  a  use of  the  electrode.<br>
The  device,   the  method  and  the  use  according  to  the invention  are  characterised  by  the  features  appearing  in the  characteristic  clauses  of  the  independent  claims.<br><br>
The  further  features  of  the  invention  are  given  in  the dependent  claims,   respectively.<br>
According  to  the  present  invention  a  method  is  provided which  is   suitable  in  using  wire,   knitted,   woven  or  plaited wire  mesh  net  of  metals  for  use  for,   and  production  of  an anode  and/or  a  cathode  which  may  be  used  to  produce  a mixture  of  oxidants,   and  in  particular  radicals  by  use  of electrolysis.<br>
The  invention  is  characterised  in  that  an  anode  is assembled  with  wires  or  wire  mesh,   knitted  or  plaited  of tantalum,   niobium,   hafnium,   zirconium,   platinum,   rhodium, iridium,   ruthenium,   palladium,   or  an  alloy  thereof,   or  a mixture  of  different  wire"s  of  the  abovementioned  metal.<br>
The  invention  is  characterised  in  that  the  cathode  is assembled  with  wires  or  a  wire  mesh,   knitted  or  plaited  of 316L  steelwires,   or  higher  alloyed  conductive  and  resistant material.<br>
Further  the  invention  is  characterised  in  that  the  wires  or anode  meshs  and  cathode  meshs  may  be  joined  close  together without  short  circuit  contact  in  that  a  separation  mesh, membrane  or  coarse  crossed  squared  mesh  in  a  non-conductive oxidant  resistant  material,   which  is  arranged  between  the anode  and  cathode  in  order  to  separate  these  to  prevent  a short  circuit  contact.<br>
According  to  a  preferred  "embodiment  of  the  invention,   a superior  conductive  material  may  be  arranged  on  the  anode and  cathode,   individually  or  in  a  coarse  square  pattern, and  may  be  thereafter  insulated  by  means  of  oxidant  durable insulating  material   from  electrolyte  in  order  to  provide  an<br><br>
even  current  through  flow  over  the  exposed  wire  mesh  or wire  net  area.<br>
The  invention  is  charactexised  in  that  anode/cathode  is arranged  in  a  flow  of  liquid  which  has   to  pass   through  the anode/cathode,   or  that  the  anode/cathode  is  arranged  in  a vessel  for  production  of  oxidant.<br>
Further,   the   invention  is  characterised  in  that  by electrolysing  of  freshwater  one  is  able  to  use  both  cathode mesh  and  anode  mesh  in  SS316L  quality  or  higher  alloyed metal.<br>
Further,   the  invention  is  characterised  in  that  by<br>
electrolysis  of  freshwater  a  woven,   knitted  or  plaited  mesh	<br>
may  be  replaced  with  a  plate  in  SS316L  which  is  perforated by  means  of  photochemistry  in  order  to  substitute  a  wire mesh.<br>
Advantages  of  the  present  new  method<br>
By  exposing  electrical  current  with  high  current  density exceeding  the  law  of  Farraday  to  a  wire  assembly  or  a woven,   knitted  or  plaited  mesh  of  the  metal  or  a  precious metal  as  disclosed  above,   one  achieves  a  high  production  of radicals  and  reactive  oxidants.   This  production   implies  a particularly  high  effect  by  oxidising  of  organic  material and  disinfection.<br>
The  present  invention  differs  from  existing  electrolytic cells/processes  where  the  effect  of  radicals,   ozone, hydrogen  peroxide,   chlordioxide,   and  hypochlorite  is prepared  from  anodes  with  a  layer  of  precious  metals  which produces  the   reactive  oxidants,   and  by  providing  an electrode  structure  whereby  the  production  of  radicals  may be  utilised  more  optimally  than  previously.<br><br>
This  may  be  provided  by  the  anode  having  a  shape  including a  mesh  of  metal  as  disclosed,   having  a  wire  distance  of from  100  micron  to  25000  micron  or  a  square  opening  of   from 18  micron  to  25000  micron  where  the  metal   is  exposed   to voltages   exceeding  the  law  of  Farraday  resulting  in  a  high production  of  oxidant  close  to  the  anode.<br>
By  using  the  electrode  structure  according  to  the  invention the  liquid  to  be  handled  is  brought  to  pass  a  wire  net  mesh where  the  opening  in  the  wire  mesh  has  an  opening   size  of minimum  15  micron   (15 µm) .  On  passing  the  radical   reaction with  a  lifetime  of  some  thousandth  of  a  second,   will  act substantially  on  all  the   liquid  flowing  through  the  wire mesh.  Other  electrolytic  oxidation  processes  obtain  1-3% radical  effect  on  the  surface  of  the  anode.   With  the present  invention  one  obtains  an  efficiency  of   95-98% utilisation  of  the  radical  effect.   This   is  due  to   the   fact that   up,to  95-98%  of  the  liquid  is  passing  close  to  the anode  where  the  radicals  spend  their  lifetime  in  that   the liquid  in  fact  flows  through  the  fine-meshed  anode.<br>
The  present  invention  differs  from  the  existing electrolytic  cells/processes  in  that  the  anode  and  the cathode  may  be  conducted  very  close  together  by  means  of  a separation  element   (spacer)   or  a  separation  wire  mesh, prepared  by  a  coarse  squared  non-conducting  material.<br>
According  to  a  prefered  embodiment  of  the  invention,   it  is prefered  that  each  frame   is  covered  by  two  layers  of  wire mesh,   on  layer  of  each  plane  side  of  the  frame.   It  is however  sufficient  that  the  frame  includes  only  one  wire mesh  layer,   as  shown  in   figure  lA,   IB  and  IC.<br><br>
According  to  the  most  prefered  embodiraent,   a  wire  mesh  or parallel  threads,   12  and  14,   respectively  is  bounded  to each   side  of   the  conductor   frame  10  by  exposing   it   to  a substantial  tension  force/pressure  and  possibly  by  applying heat  and  using  a  bonding  agent,   or  by  induction  welding  or laser  welding  simoultaneously  with  that  wire  or  perforated foil   is  kept   under  sufficient  tension.   Thus  the  wires  or mesh  covering  the  exposed  area  on  each  plane  side  of  the conductor  are  stabilized.     Possibly  the  wire  mesh  includes parallel   threads  where  each  tenth  or  twentieth  thread  is  of tantalum  while  the  others  are  platinum  threads.<br>
Onto  one  of  wire  layers  1-4  of  the  frame  10  or  said separation  wire  mesh,   a  spacer  foil  16   (of  a  PVS  or polypropylene  material)   of  a  non-conducting  material,   and having  the  exact   shape   (plane  view)   of  the  frame  10,   is positioned  and  anchored.   Thus  the  openings   18  of  the separation  wire  mesh  16  are  aligned  with  the  through  flow openings   18   of  the  frame  10.   Thus  the  through  flow  openings 18  of  the   frame  10  which  are  "covered"  by  the  wire  mesh 12,14   is  not  covered  by  said  spacer   foil  16.   The  thickness of  the  frame   10  may  be  5  mm,   while  the  spacer  foil   16  may have  a  thickness  as  low  as  0,3  mm   (representing  the separation  between  the  anode  and  cathode  surfaces),   Thus the  water/liquid  through  flow  properties  of  the   frame  in use,   is  not  obstructed.<br>
Thus  an  electrode  unit,   for  an  anode  or  cathode,   includes said  conductive  frame  having  a  number  of  through  flow openings   18,   both  plane  sides  of  which  being  covered  with the  perforated  plate,   the  wires   (parallel  threads  or  a  wire mesh) ,   and  the  spacer  foil  18  on  one  side  only.   Further   the conductive  frame   (for  a  cathode  or  anode)   10  includes  means 20  for  connecting  to  adequate  current  supply   (voltage  and current).<br><br>
In  order  to  construct  a  single   (the   simplest)   electrolytic cell,   two  electrode  units  as  shown  in  figure  4   are  mounted mutually  close  to  each  other  in  alignment,   so  that  said spacer  layer  18,   provides  for  the  necessary  distance   (for example  of  0,3  mm)   between  the  anode  surface   14   of  one electrode  unit  and  the  cathode  surface  12  of  the  adjacent electrode  unit.<br>
It  is  prefered  to  cover  the  conductor  frame   (as  being  of stainless  steel)   10  and  the  sections  of  the  conductive  wire (wire  mesh)   12,14  covering  said  frame,   with  a  non oxidizable  material   in  order  to  protect  against  contact with  the  electrolyte,   in  a  similar  manner  as   shown  in figure  IC.<br>
An  electrolytic  cell  consisting  of  a  number  of  the abovementioned  pairs  of  electrode  units   (up  to  50  pairs), may  have  a  circular,   or  rectanuglar  shape.   A  circular electrode  unit  may  for  example  have  a  diameter  of  up  to  1 meter,   representing  the  water  through  flow  of  the  unit.   The electrolytic  cell  may  be  placed  into  a  pipe  conducting  the water  to  be  treated  according  to  the  invention,   for  example as  shown  i   figure  5.   When  applying  a   sufficient   voltage   to the  anode/cathode  sets,   the  process  water  flowing  through the  unit   (the  openings   18)   of  the  wire  mesh  of  the  unit, obtains  a  close  reactive  contact  with  the  oxidants  and radicals   formed  on  the  anode  threads  of  the  wire  mesh.<br>
The  drawing  figures  4A  and  4B  are  expanded  views (rectangular  and  circular  versions)   of  the  four  layers  20, 12,   14,   16  of  which  each  -unit  is  structured.<br>
Fig.   4B  shows   the  anode  or  cathode  wire  mesh  where  the conductor   frame  of  a  superior  rigid  conductive  material   is<br><br>
supporting the exposed anode or cathode surface in order to obtain an even current distribution over a large area or in case of high current. The mesh is attached to the conductor frame at both sides. The non-conductive spacing material in the same shape as the rigid conductor frame and attached to one  of  the  meshes  at  one  side.<br>
The assembly of a single anode or cathode can be stacked in numbers  from  one  anode  and  one  cathode  up  to  50  altogether.<br>
Anode  and  cathode  might  be  of  identical  material  or different.   In  case  of  similar  material   DC  power  applied might  be  alternated  to  avoid  scaling  and  uneven  tear  and wear.   Anode  size  might  each  be  more  than  1  m  diameter.   Flow capacity  might  be  from  a  few  litres  /hr  in  the  smallest cells  to  more  than  1000  m3/hr  in  each  of  the  largest  cell. Typical - current  density  at  316L  anodes  is  38  mA/cm2 provided  Cl  content  at  5  ppm.   For  noble  metals  the  above have  been  tested  to  270  Amp  at  a  anode  area  of   0,5  cm2.<br>
The  wire-mesh  may  be   formed  of  individual  wires  mounted parallel  to  one  another  to  the  frame,   or  of  individual wires  that  are  woven,   knitted  or  plaited  or  induction-welded  to  form  the  aforementioned  mesh.  The  distance between  each  paralell<br>
Preferably  each   individual  wire  or  the  perforated  foil   is attached  to  the  conducting  frame  by  use  of  such  that electrical  contact   is  achieved  for  even  current distribution  over  exposed  electrode  area  and  exposed electrode  area  becomes  tension  stabilised  to  eliminate  use of  conventional  spacer,   whereupon  frame  or  conductor  is isolated  from  the  liquid  electrolyte  by  an  oxidant-resistant  isolator/coating.<br><br>
  in  order  to  remove  all particles  and  organisms  larger  than  the  light   aperture  in the  electrode.<br>
Further,   after  the  liquid  has  processed  according  to  the invention  it  is  directed  through  an  hydrophobic  adsorption filter  or  hydrophobic  adsorption  media   in  order  to  remove potential  excess  organic  compounds.<br>
After  the  treatment,   the  liquid  is  preferably  directed through  a  flotation  device  in  order  to  remove  electro flotated  organic  material.<br>
The  exposed  gap  between  anode  and  cathode  have  no  need   for conventional  or  further  spacers,   as  spacing  is  provided  by applying  a  foil,   membrane  or  coarse  of  non  conductive material   of  the  same  shape  as  the  frame  itself.   The clearance  might  be  as  low  as  0,3  mm.  This  implies  that  by the  invention,   it  is  possible  to  obtain  a  high  current density  with  a  very  low  voltage,   something  which  involve that   the  Law  of  Farraday  easily  is  exceeded  without  flow  or current  loss  due  to  spacer  and  a  desired  production  of reactive  oxidants  is  provided.<br>
Another  advantage  by  applying  wire/mesh  or  perforated  foil at  both  sides  of  the  conductor  frame  is   that  it  allows  mm2 uppscaling  for  extreme  currents  passing  to  the  exposed  area for  electrolysis.   A  5mm  thick  frame  covered  at  both  sides allows  placement  of  a  thin  spacing  frame  at  both  sides where  the  cathode  mesh/perforated  foil  can  be  placed  close to  the  anode  in  a  distance  down  to  0,3  mm.   With  varying distances  more  than  3000  Amps  can  be  passed  through  an electrode,<br><br>
The  present  invention  differs  from  existing  electrolytic cells/processes   in  that  one  by  means  of  a  very  low  voltage, may  obtain  the  necessary  high  current  density  of  large  area without  this   reducing  the  volume  through  flow  of  the   liquid to  be  handled.   This  also  implies  that  large  volumes  of liquid  to  be  handled  may  be  treated  very  cheaply.   The volume  capacity  of  the  electrolytic  cell  is  not  changed  in contrast  to  other  electrolytic  cells  even  though  the distance  between  the  anode  and  cathode  is  reduced  from  i.e. 5  cm  to  0,3  nun  in  that  the  same  volume-liquid  flow  goes through  the  anode  and  cathode  independent  of  the  mutual distance  between  them.<br>
The  present  invention  differs  from  the  existing  anodes  in that  the  use  of  wires  to  a  considerable  degree  increases the  area  of  the  anode  compared  to  the  weight  of  the  metal and  the  real   surface.  Thus,   the  costs  of  the  precious metals  are  also  reduced  considerably  at  the  same  time  as the  efficiency  per  cm2,   is  increased.<br>
The  present   invention  differs  from  existing  electrolytic cells/processes  in  that   it  is  possible  to  obtain  high current  density,   a  low  consumption  of  energy  and  a  high through   flow  by  volume  of  liquid,   as  the  distance  between the  anode  and  cathode  can  be  reduced  to  0,3  mm  without  this reducing   the   capacity  of  the  electrolytic  cell,   so  that  it may  be  used  with  the  iron  conductivity  in  fresh  water (surface  water  and  ground  water).<br>
With  the  present  invention  it  is  possible  to  combine  the effect  of  different  metals.   For  example,   an  anode  mesh  of tantalum  including  some  wires  of  another  precious  metal from  the  platinum  group,   produces  mainly  ozone,   radicals and  hydrogen  peroxide,   and  very  little  hypo  chlorite  and chloride  dioxide.   This  is  due  to  the   fact  that  all   flow  of<br><br>
current  will  take  place  from  the  precious  metal  wires  such as  tantalum  immediately  will  immediately  obtain  an isolating  layer  of  oxide.<br>
The  present   invention  differs  from  existing  electrolytic cells/processes   in  that  it  can  be  used  with  a  low  cost  for treating  large  volumes  of  liquid,   such  as  surface  water, fresh  water  and  ground  water  with  the  composition  existing in  great  parts  of  the  world  today.   Even  with  both  anode  and cathode  of  316  L  steel  or  higher  alloyed  metal  without   the anode  oxidising  or  corroding.   This   is  due  to  a  high electrode  surface  with  very  low  consumption  of  energy  is producing  the  necessary  oxidant   (ozone  and  radicals)   even with  the  average  conductivity  in  ground  water  and  surface fresh  water.<br>
The  present  invention  is  characterised  in  that   liquid  may be  conducted  through  anode  and  cathode  in  that  a  frame  of conductive  material  is  fixed  to  the  anode  and  cathode  mesh with   sufficient  contact,   the  mesh  is  preferably  conducted at  both  sides  of  the  frame,   and  the  conductor  frame  is coated  with  a  non  oxidizable  material  in  order  to  protect against  contact  with  electrolyte.   The  spacing  material   in  a non-conductive  oxidant  resistant  material  may  be  provided whereafter  the  anode  or  cathode  mesh  is  assembled.   The spacing  material  is  of  identical  shape  as  the  conductor frame  and  of  varying  thickness.<br>
The  device  according  to  the  invention  will  be  explained more  in  detail  with  reference  to  the  following specification  and  the  following  drawings,   wherein:<br>

Fig.   4A  shows  an  expanded  view  of  a  rectangular  electrode structure,   and  which  is  disclosed  previously  in  this specification.<br>
Fig.   4B  shows  an  expanded  view  of  a  circular  electrode structure  according  to  the  invention.<br>
Fig.   5  shows  a   section  of  an  electrolytic  cell   (with  only one  set  of  an  anode  and  cathode  shown  for  simplicity)   made of  a  wire,   plaited,   woven  or  knitted  mesh  with  a  separation mesh  between  the  anode  and  cathode  in  order   to  prevent  a short   circuit   contact.   The  liquid  is  processed  in  that   it is  conducted  through  the  anode  and  cathode  so  that  hydrogen is  conducted  out  from  the  cathode  and  away  from  the  anode.<br>
The  structure  shown  in  fig.   5  was  used  in  control  and verified  experiments   for  treating  the  ballast  water   from ships   and  including   sea  water  containing  bacteria,   micro<br><br>
organism,   algae  and  spores.   The  water  including  a  high degree  of  pollution,   was  conducted  through  the   cell  once, as   shown  by  arrows,   with  an  amperage  of   100  A.   The  result show  that  100%  of  the  abovementioned  pollutants,   including spores,   where  destroyed.   An  extrapolation  of  the  results based  on  the  experiments  show  that  the  required  consumption of  energy  will  be  5kWh  in  order  to  handle  2500  m3/h  process water  with  an  anode  surface  of  2,5  m2.<br>
Similarly  the  structure  as  shown  in  fig.   5  was  used  to prove  oxidant  production  in  fresh  water.  With  an anode/cathode-distance  of.  1mm  and  an  anode  of  a  precious metal  mesh  produced  0,5  ppm  ozone  during  one  through  flow. Up  scaling  models  show  that  2500  m2/h  require  87   kWh  with an  anode  surface  of  2,5  m2.<br>
The  experiment  was  repeated  with  an  anode  mesh  and  cathode mesh  of  316  L  steel.   During  one  through   flow  0,91  ppm  ozone was  produced  in  the  drinking  water  with  80  V  and  3  A.<br>
Fig.   6  shows  a  section  of  an  electrolytic  cell  there  foil or  wire  mesh  to  which  a  liquid  was  added  to  both  the  plain surfaces  whereupon  the  liquid  is  conducted  through  the cathode  on  each  side  of  the  anode  so  that  hydrogen  does  not come  in  contact  with  the  anode  or  in  the  field  between  the anode  and  cathode,<br>
This  electrolytic  cell  was  used  for  destruction  of  poly aromatic  hydrocarbons   (PAH)   and  PCB  on  particles   in  a  sea water  slurry.   With  a  careful  addition  of  electrolyte  and circulation  of  the  mixture  during  20  minutes,   the  PAH-content  was  reduced  by  99,6%  and  the  PCB-content  was reduced  by  76%  based  on  relatively  high  concentrations.<br><br>
