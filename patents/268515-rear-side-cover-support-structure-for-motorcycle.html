[Title of the Invention] REAR SIDE COVER SUPPORT STRUCTURE FOR MOTORCYCLE [Technical Field] [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a rear side cover support structure for a motorcycle. [Background Art] [0002]<br>
As a rear side cover for a motorcycle according to the related art, there is known one which is arranged below the rear portion of a seat (see, for example, Patent Document 1). [Patent Document 1] JP Patent No. 3745842<br>
[3]	<br>
Figs. 5 and 9 of Patent Document 1 will be described below. A body cover 23 as a rear side cover is arranged below the rear portion of a seat 12, a tail light 50 is arranged above the Center of the rear end portion of the body cover 23, and flasher lamps 51, 51 are arranged on the left and right of the rear end of the body cover 23. [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
[4]	<br>
While the rear end portion of the body cover 23 is formed with a large vertical width in order to improve rigidity, or to provide resistance to resonance with Vibration of the body, this leads to, for example, a lack of attractiveness in terms of outward appearance in comparison to a sharp shape with a narrowed<br>
rear end, and also an increase in weight.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a rear side Cover support structure for a motorcycle which is resistant to resonance while achieving an improvement in outward appearance and a reduction in weight.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
[5]	<br>
An aspect of the invention according to Claim 1 relates to a rear side cover support structure for a motorcycle, including, in its rear portion, a pair of left and right rear side covers that Cover a side portion of a rear portion of a body, and a grab rail, in which a tail lamp is arranged in a rear portion between the left and right rear side covers, a rear end portion of each of the rear side covers, which forms an upper portion of a rear portion of each of the rear side covers, extends along a lower surface of the grab rail, a claw portion that extends upward is foDnned in an upper surface of the rear end portion, a groove into v/hich the clav; portion is inserted is provided in the lower surface of the grab rail, and a lower surface of the rear end portion is abutted on the tail lamp via a cushion member.<br>
[6]	<br>
As an effect, since the rear end portion of the rear side Cover, which forms the upper portion of the rear portion of the rear side cover, has an elongated, acutely angled shape, so the outward appearance becomes attractive, and the rear side cover becomes lightweight.<br>
Further, when the claw portion formed in the upper surface <br>
of the rear end portion of the rear side cover is inserted into the groove portion of the grab rail, and the lower surface of the rear end portion of the rear side cover is abutted on the tail lamp via the cushion menÂ±)er, both the upper and lower surfaces of the rear end portion of the rear side cover are supported in place, thereby suppressing resonance of the rear side cover. [0008]<br>
In an aspect of the invention according to Claim 2, the rear portion of each of the rear side covers is formed in a horizontal V shape in side view.<br>
As an effect, the rear end portion of the rear side cover forms an upper portion shaped like a horizontal V, creating an elongated, acutely angled shape that slopes upward toward the rear.<br>
[9]	<br>
In an aspect of the invention according to Claim 3, a surface of the grab rail is formed of rubber or soft resin.<br>
As an effect, the claw portion of the rear side cover can be easily inserted into the groove of the soft grab rail. Also, a soft feel can be provided upon gripping the grab rail.<br>
[10]	<br>
In an aspect of the invention according to Claim 4, in a rear portion of the grab rail, a flat surface is provided so as to cover the top of the tail lamp in plan view. [0011]<br>
As an effect, since the top of the tail lamp is covered by the flat surface of the grab rail, it is unnecessary to extend the left and right rear side covers to the top of the tail lamp.<br>
so the rear side cover becomes more lightweight. Also, the tail lamp is protected by the grab rail. [Effect of the Invention] [0012]<br>
In the aspect of the invention according to Claim 1, a tail lamp is arranged in a rear portion between the left and right rear side covers, a rear end portion of each of the rear side Covers, which forms an upper portion of a rear portion of each of the rear side Covers, extends along a lower surface of the grab rail, a claw portion that extends upward is formed in an upper surface of the rear end portion, a groove into which the claw portion is inserted is provided in the lower surface of the grab rail, and a lower surface of the rear end portion is abutted on the tail lamp via a cushion member. Thus, since the rear portion of the rear side cover is formed in a horizontal V shape, the rear end portion can be formed in an elongated, acutely angled shape to achieve an improvement in outward appearance and a reduction in weight. In addition, by inserting the claw portion of the rear side cover into the groove portion of the grab rail, and pressing the lower surface of the rear side cover by the tail lamp via the cushion member, resonance of the rear end portion of the rear side cover can be suppressed. [0013]<br>
In the aspect of the invention according to Claim 2, since the rear portion of each of the rear side covers is formed in a horizontal V shape in side view, the rear end portion of the rear side cover has an elongated, acutely angled shape that slopes upward towards the rear, thereby making it possible to improve<br>
the outward appearance in side view.<br>
[14]	<br>
In the aspect of the invention according to Claim 3, since the surface of the grab rail is formed of loibber or soft resin, it is possible to improve the ease of Installation of the claw portion of the rear side cover and, in addition, a soft feel can be provided upon gripping the grab rail.<br>
[15]	<br>
In the aspect of the invention according to Claim 4, since a flat surface is provided in the rear portion of the grab rail so as to Cover the top of the tail lamp in plan view, the top of the tail lamp is covered by the flat surface of the grab rail. Thus, there is no particular need to cover the top of the tail lamp by a rear center cover or the like, which makes it possible to reduce the surface area of the rear side cover, and make the rear side cover lightweight.<br>
Also, a load exerted from above the tail lamp can be borne by the flat surface of the grab rail, so the tail lamp can be protected.<br>

Thus, since the rear portions (more specifically, the rear edges 74k, 76k) of the rear side covers 74,<br>
76	are formed in a horizontal V shape (V shape in side view), the rear end portions 74E, 76E can be formed in an elongated, acutely angled shape to achieve an improvement in outward appearance and a reduction in weight. In addition, by inserting the claw portions 74b, 7Sb of the rear side covers 74, 76 into the groove portions 113b, 113b of the grab rail 68, and pressing the lower surfaces 74c, 76c of the rear side covers 74, 76 by the tail lamp<br>
77	via the cushion member 115, resonance of the rear end portions 74E, 76E of the rear side covers 74, 76 can be suppressed. [0040]<br>
Also, since the rear portions of the rear side covers 74, 7 6 are formed in a horizontal V shape in side view, the rear end portions 74E, 76E of the rear side covers 74, 76 have an elongated, acutely angled shape that slopes upward towards the rear, thereby making it possible to improve the outward<br>
appearance in side view.<br>
[41]	<br>
Further, as shown in Fig. 3, since the surface of the grab rail 68 is formed of rubber or soft resin, the claw portions 74b, 76b of the rear side Covers 74, 76 can be easily inserted into the grooves 113b, 113b of the grab rail 68, which makes it possible to improve the ease of installation of the claw portions 74b, 76b and, in addition, a soft feel can be provided upon gripping the grab rail 68.<br>
[42]	<br>
Furtherraore, as shown in Fig. 2, since the trough portion 68c as a flat surface is provided in the rear portion of the grab rail 68 so as to cover the top of the tail lamp 77 in plan view, the top of the tail lamp 77 is covered by the trough portion 68c of the grab rail 68, or is covered by the crest portions 68a, 68b and the trough portion 68c. Thus, there is no particular need to Cover the top of the tail lamp 77 by a rear center cover or the like, which makes it possible to reduce the surface area of the rear side covers 74, 76 (see Fig. 4), and make the rear side Covers 74, 76 lightweight.<br>
Also, a load exerted from above the tail lamp 77 can be borne by the trough portion 68c, and by extension, the entire grab rail 68, so the tail lamp 77 can be protected.<br>
[43]	<br>
It should be noted that in this embodiment, as shown in Fig. 3, the groove 113b is provided in the grab rail 68, and the tail lamp 77 is abutted on the rear side cover 74 via the cushion member 115. However, this should not be construed restrictively.<br>
It is also possible to provide a groove in the upper portion of the tail lamp 77, provide a downwardly projecting claw portion, which is inserted into the groove, in the rear side cover 74, and make the grab rail 68 abut on the rear side cover 74 via the cushion meniber 115.
