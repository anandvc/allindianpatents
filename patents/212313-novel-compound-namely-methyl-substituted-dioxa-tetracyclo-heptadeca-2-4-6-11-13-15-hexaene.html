SAURASHTRA UNIVERSITY,    an Indian University, of University Road, Rajkot 360 005, Gujarat, India,<br>
The following specification (particularly) describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
 lovel compound namely methyl substituted dioxa-tetracyclo heptadeca-2,4,6,11,13,15-hexaene<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds namely methyl substituted dioxa-tetracyclo heptadeca-2,4,6,ll,13,15-hexaenes, having antibacterial, antifungal, antihelicobacter pylori and antitubercular activity.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART REFERENCES.<br>
Pechmann condensation between phenols and p-ketonic esters like methyl acetoacetate under catalytic effect of various condensing agents lead to the formation of coumarins. Thus, it provides one of the excellent methods by which coumarin formation takes place. The otheT well known methods for coumarin synthesis is Perkin reaction [W. H. Perkin (1868), J. Chem. Soc, 21, 53&amp;181; W. H. Perkin (1877), J. Chem. Soc, 3_L 388; J. R. Johnson (1942), Org. React., I, 210; H. O. House (1972),Modern Synthetic Reactions(W. A. Benjamin, Menlo Park, California, 2nd Edition pp 660-663;N. Poonia etal (1980), Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan, 53, 3338; T. Rosen (1991), Comp. Org. Syn., 2, 395-408].<br>
For Pechmann condensation numbers of condensing agents are employed. In most of the cases, a considerable amount of the condensing agents has been employed. The iodine, bromine, concentrated sulphuric acid, phosphorous oxychloride, phosphorous trichloride, phosphorous pentoxide , aluminium chloride, zinc chloride and other Lewis acids may be employed at room temperature (28-32 C) for 24, 48 or more hours with or without a solvent [H. von Pechmann and C. Duisberg (1883), Ber., 16, 2119; D. W. Hill (1936), Chem. Rev., 19, 27; S. M. Sethna and N. M. Shah (1945), Chem. Rev., 36(1); S. S. Israelstam and E. Barris(1958), Chem. Ind., 1430 ; V. M. Thakor and A. B. Acharya (1971) Jour. Indian Chem. Soc.,48(5|.<br>
The reaction of dihydric phenols and trihydric phenols with 1,3-diketones like benzoylacetone was investigated earlier in presence of Pechmann condensing agents and the outcome of products are much studied and a comprehensive review has indicated some ambiguity in structures of reaction product also [H. von Pechmann and<br><br><br>
Duisberg (1883), Ber., 16, 2119; D. W. Hill (1936), Chem. Rev., 19, 27; B. N. Ghosh( 1915), J. Chem. Soc, 107, 739].<br>
The reactivity of aromatic phenolic compounds with P-ketonic ester are much studied and many reviews has been given fairly good account of products formed, reagents employed, phenol used[R. C. Gupta et al (1982), Ind. J. Chem., 2KB), 344-7; C. Bulow and H. Wanger(1901), Ber., 34, 1189]<br>
None of the literature or prior art suggests the type and structure product formation from conditions similar to Pechmann condensation to a mono substituted phenol like m-cresol, p-cresol or disubstituted phenols like 2,3-xylenol or 2,4-xylenol.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides novel compounds namely methyl substituted dioxa-tetracyclo heptadeca-2, 4,6,11,13,15-hexaenes having anti-microbial properties. The invention also provides for the first time novel reaction ie condensation of<br>
phenols with 1,3-diketones occurring in presence of Zinc Chloride as condensing agent.<br>

Pharmacologically Experimental example will now be described to illustrate the usefulness of the compounds of the present invention. Experimental method<br>
It was according to method of Dastidar, S. G., Chaudhury, A., Annadurai, S. et al., In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial action of fluphenazine. J. Chemother. 7, 201 (1995).<br>
1.	Bacteria<br>
Gram-positive bacteria {Escherichia coli, Shigella sonnei, Shigella aysenteriae, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimurium, Vibrio cholerae) and Gram-positive bacetira (Staphylococuss aureus, Bacillus licheniformis) were received as freeze-dried ampoules. H.pyiori (ATCC 43504) was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA).<br>
2.	Measurement of MIC on antibacterial activity.<br>
Gram-positive bacteria were grown 'in nutrient broth and Gram-negative bacteria in peptone water (PW, 1.0% bacteriological peptone (Difco) plus 0.5% NaCl) for 18 h; this gave an optimum growth of the test bacteria. Each compound was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, 5mg/ml) sterilizedd by filtration by usin g<br>
7<br><br>
sintered glass filter (G-5) and stored at 4 °C. Each agent was then added to molten   nurtrient agar in the following concentration (pg/ml): 0 (control), 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1000 and poured into sterile petri dishes. The pH of the media was maintained at 7.2 to 7.4. the inoculum consisted of an overnight grown broth culture of a bacterium diluted in such a manner that a 2mm (internal diameterO loopful of the culture 105 colony hyphen forming units (CFU): These were then spot inoculated on NA plates containing increasing amount of a compound, incubated at 37 °C up to 72 h for determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). 3.       Measurement of anti-H. pylori activity<br>

The micro-dilution broth method was used to determine the MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration). Mueller-Hilton broth containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was as the medium, and was cultured in a jar conditioned with Campylo Pack (Dia latron) for 48 hrs. Briefly, H. pylori strains were inoculated on a Brucella agar plate containing 10% jorse serum, and cultured at 37°C for 48 hrs. the bacterial colonies collected were diluted to 107 colony forming unit (UFC)/mL with 0.9% saline. The fractions were dissolved in DMSO, and then diluted with Mueller-Hilton broth. To the solution of the fractions, a suspension solution of the bacteria was added to make 106 CFU/100 mL/well. The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 48 hrs. MIC values of fractions tested were determined by observation. Table:<br><br><br><br>

5.       Measurement of antitubercular activity<br>
It was according to method of Collins, L.; Anitirnicrob. Agent Chemother., 41, 1004-1009 (1997).<br>
Antitubercular activity was determined using the BACTEC 460 system as modified below. Stock solutions as test compounds were prepared in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at l mg/ml and sterilized by passage through 0.22 pm PFTE filters (Millex-FG, Millipore, Bedford MA). Fifty microliters was added to 4 ml radiometric 7H,2 broth (BACTEC 12B; Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Instrument System, Sparks, MD) to achieve a final concentration of 6.25  ng/ml. Controls<br>
9<br><br>
received 50 ul DMSO. Rifampin (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) was included as a positive drug control. Rifampin was solubilized and diluted in DMSO and added to BACTEC-12 broth to achieve a range of concentration for determination of minimum inhibitory (MIC, lowest concentration inhibiting 99% of the inoculum).<br>
M. Tuberculosis H37RV (ATCC 27294; American type culture collection, Rockville, MD) was cultured at 37°C on a rotary shaker in middle brook 7H9 broth (Difco Laboratories, Detroiet, M1) supplemented with 0.2 v/v glycerol and 0.05% v/v Tween 80 until the culture turbidity achieved an optical density of 0.45-0.55 at 550 run. Bacteria were then pelleted by centrifugation, washed twice and resuspended In one fifth the original volume in dulbecoo's phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Irvine Scientific Santa, Nalgene, Rochester, NY) and aliquots were frozen at 80°C. Cultures were showed and an appropriate dilution performed such that a BACTEC-12B vial inoculated with a 0.1 ml would reach a growth index (GI) of 999 in 5 days. One tenth of the diluted inoculum was used to inoculate 4 ml fresh BACTEC 12B broth containing the test compounds. An additional control vial was included which received a further 1:100 diluted inoculum (as well as 50 ul DMSO) for use in calculating the MIC of Rifampin, respectively by establishing procedures.<br>
Cultures were incubated in 37°C and the GI determined daily until control cultures achieved a GI of 999. Assays were usually completed in 5-8 days. Percent inhibition was defined as-1- (GI of test sample/GI of control) xlOO. Minimum inhibitory concentration of compound effecting a reduction in daily change in GI, which was less than that, observed with a 1:100 diluted control culture on day the latter reached a GI of at least 30.<br><br>
