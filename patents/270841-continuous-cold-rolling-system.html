3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :<br><br>
the<br><br><br><br><br><br>
BRUSH &amp; HOLDER WITH INTEGRATED COOLANT SPRAY SYSTEM. FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a brush with an integrated coolant spray system for surface treatment, with a brush holder, which can be driven in rotation for an annular brush with and bristles protruding outwardly Carrying coolant flow through them. Such coolant spray system integrated within a brush is used in the embodiment as in Machines &amp; hand-held tools, in particular for DeBurring machining, grinding, cutting, polishing purposes and also for roughening metallic surfaces.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The cost of maintaining a large cutting and cooling fluid system can be enormous. Depending on the volume of machining being performed, a shop might pay anywhere from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars for replacement coolant, coolant additives, and downtime for coolant system cleaning and recharging. Fluid systems often need close monitoring and maintenance.<br>
There are indirect costs associated with the use of cutting fluids as well. Because the fluids do not remain within the work envelope of the machine tool, shops must pay for additional plant housekeeping when fluids are used. Also, maintaining worker health in the presence of potentially harmful fluid mists can be expensive. Cutting fluids can adhere to chips, making their disposal more costly. The use of fluids can adversely affect tool life and jeopardize the machine tools reliability and useful life. And the presence of petroleum-base fluids increases the risk of fire in the shop.<br>
To avoid these costs and problems, shops are beginning to explore dry machining. But there are costs and problems associated with this alternative as well. To make an informed decision about the use of cutting fluids, shops must understand the effects that machining without fluid will have on their operations. Researchers at Michigan<br>
2<br><br>
Technological University (MTU), Houghton, MI, have conducted experiments to quantify these effects. Shops should be aware of cutting fluid alternatives, because safety and environmental concerns could eliminate machining with cutting fluid as an option in the near future. As health and safety regulations governing the use of cutting fluids become stricter, the cost of compliance may outweigh the benefits of cutting fluid use.<br>
The synthetic, straight, and soluble oils in use today may pose less of a direct toxic hazard, their short- and long-term effects are of major concern. For instance, direct skin contact can cause an allergic reaction or dermatitis. Inhalation of fluid aerosols can lead to immediate problems for asthma sufferers and long-term breathing disorders for those who work in the shop environment. The petroleum products that are the basis for the majority of cutting fluids are suspected carcinogens.<br>
Despite these drawbacks, shops continue to use cooling / cutting fluids because of the perceived benefits. Researchers say that the cutting fluid in a machining operation acts primarily as lubrication to reduce process friction and as a coolant to remove process-generated heat. From a practical standpoint, the cutting fluid serves other purposes as well. For instance, a stream of fluid can transport chips from the cutting zone. Recirculating fluid provides thermal stability to the frame of the machine tool. Jets of fluid wash chips and tramp oils from pockets of the bed where they may otherwise collect. And the residual cutting fluid film also provides some corrosion resistance to the machine tool and the workpiece.<br>
The technical problem of the invention is to provide a brush with an integrated coolant spray system of the aforementioned embodiment, which is characterized by increased durability in a simple and functional manner, even at peak load.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
To achieve this object, with an integrated cooling spray system along with a brush for surface treatment, the invention discloses that coolant is supplied through the<br>
3<br><br>
brush holder and/or annular brush for the cooling oi the surface thereof and the removal of the burrs simultaneously. This proves to be particularly advantageous in view of the fact that the base housing is, in particular, made from Various Engineering Plastics like polyamide Filled or Plain, Composite with or without fabric and the bristles are preferably Synthetics, Metallic, Natural or wire bristles.<br>
According to an exemplary embodiment, the coolant spray is supplied by means of a passage integrated within the brush. The coolant spray may be a coolant, cutting oil, water etc. A gaseous medium, for example forced air, or a liquid medium, for example water, may be supplied as coolant.<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide a pressurized fluid cooling system for cooling a tool, component or moving parts of machine.<br>
It is another object of this invention to provide a pressurized fluid cooling system with passages in the brush and the holder to transmit the fluid to the bristles, which forms an orifice for uniformly spraying the underside of the bristles for cooling purposes to get better finish and carry-away / wash-away the DeBurred particles and Oxide generated during DeBurring to get much better product surface providing a broom spray to uniformly cool the area immediately beneath the bristles.<br>
It is another object of this invention to provide a cooling effect minimizing the waste of the coolant and also minimizing the health hazard of the machinist. And also this increase a Like oi the brush.<br>
The objects of this invention are accomplished in a fluid cooling system in which the lubricating oil is pumped through a passage in the brush and the holder to at least one or More, straight or at an Angle orifice in the middle at the center of the Brush or bristles. The orifice is relatively short compared to its cross-sectional dimension. The orifice may be rectangular, circular, or other configuration and in the event that it is<br>
4<br><br>
a circular orifice, the length of the orifice over the diameter is approximately unity or less to .provide an angular spray for the spray across the underside of the bristles when the brush is in operation. This provides a uniform cooling of the surface immediately under the application. It assures uniform cooling of the operating area for improved operating conditions.<br>
Another exemplary embodiment of the present invention provides the brush to be rotating with respect to the holder provided above the brush under condition that the operating / application area is stationary.<br>
Another exemplary embodiment of the present invention provides the bristles of the said brush are hollow and the coolant is acted upon to the surface area through the bristles and not from the middle of the Brush / bristles holder.<br>
Another exemplary embodiment of the present invention provides a locking knob in the middle of the Brush / bristles for regulating and also for stopping the flow of the coolant supply from center.<br>
It will be appreciated that different types of surface are better treated with different kinds of brushes, and therefore the holder is designed to accommodate with interchangeable brushes having different material bristles for various surfaces. Also, the brush itself has been described as being possibly a Synthetic rubber bristle brush, but brushes with bristles of other material could be used, for example bristles of vegetable or animal origin, or of synthetic materials such as nylon, or of metal wire.<br>
The base housing, bristles and optionally the brush holder are always cooled to such an extent, that even at peak load the aforementioned elements are no longer subjected to such heating which can subsequently result in the damage thereof. This applies in particular to the heated bristles and housing, which is made, for example, from polyamide and which, with loop formation, is under high mechanical stress, as a  result  of  the  rotation.  Cooling  the  rotating  base  housing  and  the  bristles<br>
5<br><br>
simultaneously by the coolant reduces the deformation thereof and prevents the housing from tearing. As a result, the durabihty of the brush according to the invention and in particular of its elements is quite considerably increased and namely in a simpler and more functional manner.<br>
Further according to the invention, a portable surface cooling apparatus i.e. a brush with integrated coolant spray system comprises a base housing adapted for circular movement along a surface of application, an upright handle pivotally mounted to the base housing, a liquid dispensing system that includes a passage associated with the base module for applying coolant to a surface.

The upright handle mounted on the base housing has a central hole (3) for the passage of the coolant through it. A locking knob (4) provided on the bottom of the base housing to lock the upright handle and also regulates the coolant supply by controlling the passage of the coolant supply. The base housing also houses the bristles (5) from bottom protruding outwardly from the base housing. The bristles are, in particular and in a non-limiting manner, preferably wire bristles. Furthermore a continuous coolant supply is made from an external dispenser through the upright handle provided for the holding and coolant supply.<br>
As per the exemplary embodiment of the present invention the coolant spray is supplied by means of a passage (6) integrated within the brush. The sectional view as shown in Fig 3 and Fig 6 clearly illustrates the path for the coolant in the brush assembly. The coolant spray may be a coolant, cutting oil, water etc. A gaseous medium, for example forced air, or a liquid medium, for example water, may be supplied as coolant. A further object ensures a pressurized flow of the coolant<br>
8<br><br>
through the brush bristles. A plurality of orifices is present in the bottom of the base housing pointing towards the bristles from which the lubricating oil / coolant is pumped. The gateway is through a passage in the brush and the holder to an orifice in the middle at the center of the bristles. The orifice is relatively short compared to its cross-sectional dimension. The orifice may be rectangular, circular, or other configuration and in the event that it is a circular orifice., the length of the orifice over the diameter is approximately unity or less to provide an angular spray for the spray across the underside of the bristles when the brush is in operation. This provides a uniform cooling of the surface immediately under the application. It assures uniform cooling of the operating area for improved operating conditions.<br>
Moreover since the brush integrated with the coolant supply is made so compact and efficient, the device provides a cooling effect minimizing the waste of the coolant and also miriimizing the health hazard of the machinist as discussed above. The assembly provides a providing a broom spray to uniformly cool the area immediately beneath the bristles.<br>
In certain applications when the surface wherein the coolant is being applied is moving then the application of the coolant is made with a stationary brush head. The total surface area is covered by the brush along with the coolant is maximum in that case. The deburring and the polishing action of the brush is also possible when the brush is kept stationary. In other case when the surface wherein the coolant is being applied ex grinding, the brush is being rotated using the upright handle using external motor (not shown). A person skilled in the art can provide many solutions for the rotation of the brush. The coolant supply remains the same underneath the base housing in between the bristles as shown in the above-referred figures.<br>
As shown in Fig 4 and 5, the different types of surface are better treated with different kinds of brushes, and therefore the holder is designed to accommodate with interchangeable brushes having different material bristles for various surfaces. Also, the brush itself has been described as being possibly a rubber bristle brush, but<br>
9<br><br>
brushes with bristles of other material could be used, for example bristles of vegetable or animal origin, or of synthetic materials such as nylon, or of metal wire.<br>
As shown in Fig 7 to 9, the brush housing is designed to hold the upright handle / holder over it. The holder is provided with a plurality of uprights so that there is no axial movement between the base housing and the upright handle. The holder is locked over the base housing by a locking knob from the bottom. The locking knob holds the upright handle / holder and the base housing in the middle. The locking knobs are made screw tight or push tight as desired. The locking knob is illustrated in Fig 11 and 12.<br>
Since one of the objectives of the present invention is for the economical and efficient use of the coolant, therefore the locking knob present in the middle of the bristles is designed for the regulating of and also for stopping the flow of the coolant supply. The fig 10 shows the pathway of the coolant in the base housing where the insertion of the locking knob regulates the width of the central passage and thereby regulating the flow of the coolant.<br>
Further to the meeting of the aforesaid objective there may be provided a brush wherein the bristles of the said integrated brush are made as hollow and the coolant is supplied in a pressurized way on to the surface area through the bristles and not from the middle of the bristles holder and which satisfactorily and efficiently cools and deburrs the surfaces by spraying the coolant in a plurality of narrow streams onto the surfaces in circular patterns.
