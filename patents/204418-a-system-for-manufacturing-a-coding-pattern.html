				<th>Full Text</th>

The present invention relates to a method for forming a fine pattern or desigff, an image on a film, a substrate, where particles of various matter and a solvent is used in forming a fine image, selectively etching the underlying substrate with the dissolved particles, and surround the non dissolved particles embedded in place with their facets, texture, color, shape, size un altered.<br>
This invention is different from the hologram in that, a 3Dhologram is made up of Multiple two dimensional layers with hologram images visually placed one behind another with visual depth to produce an effect of three-dimensional hologram structure.<br>
2D hologram is made up of two images; the hologram images are assigned different colors and position in one layer. It just has one layer of hologram image, without visual depth.<br>
While it be 2D hologram or a 3D hologram the created design is mass-produced, like the ones on credit card, driving licenses and passports. If two units or even hundreds units are compared, the units will be exact and similar with each other.<br>
The designs, images produced by this invention will be totally different from each other, let it be two, three or hundred separate units, no two tags nor unit will ever match or be similar. The individual non-dissolved particles of various matters are distinct from each other in size, texture, shape, color, and chemical composition and thus will reflect, refract and transmit light differently. The particles dissolved in the solvent will migrate into the substrate and create very distinct image or design in the area. If a light sensitive dye is added it will leave different shades of marking.<br>
A watermark is created on paper. In paper, a watermark is a recognizable image or pattern that appears lighter when viewed by transmitted light (darker when viewed by reflected light, atop a dark background). Impressing a water coated metal stamp or dandy roll onto the paper during manufacturing makes a watermark. Watermarks have been used by papermakers to identify their product, also on postage stamps and other government document to discourage counterfeiting..<br>
When the embossing-on the roll, press into the wet paper pulp, it compresses and reduces the thickness in that area. Because the pattern portion of the image is thinner, it transmits more light through and therefore has a lighter appearance than the surrounding paper. On stamps and government documents the Crown or Royal seal was used as the watermark to prevent forging.<br><br>
In the case of water mark, the roll on which a design is etched creates the sam~ die design repeatedly; unless the die or roll is changed the same design gets created thousands of time without any change in design.<br>
In the case of watermark created by software, a pre-digitalized image or design is incorporated into software. This image or design is embedded into the digitalized photos, images, computer art, and multimedia. This being pre selected and digitalized it will be the same. This will be inserted again and again like a signature to identify the producer of that image or multimedia work..<br>
According to figure 8 we can understand that a single or multiple energy source can be placed at any point A,B,C,D, and "E" light from bottom of the unit or at any point in-between and at varied angle and distance from the surface of the object .The recording equipment, like a camera, a magnetic head or others can also be places at any point at F,G,H,I,J or in between. The distance "L" can also be varied as required.<br>
The individual color, texture, size, shape, multifaceted, hairline cracks, fissures, and specific identities of each granule, piece will be recorded in the reflected, refracted, transmitted image. The precise precision positioning in the matrix of each particle is recorded, in addition to the solvent created complex design and pattern in the surrounding surface. If a light sensitive dye is added it will add its own color shades to the whole area. All this will be distinctively captured and recorded in the image.<br>
The patterns, designs, images produced by this invention will be totally different from each other. Let it be two, three or hundred separate images, designs, no two designs or images will match each other, or be similar. This invention can be used where watermark, hologram or Barcode is used in the coding and security fields.<br>
Multidimensional particles of various different matter, elements or its compounds, different in color, texture, size, shape, facets and chemical compositions are mixed and scattered haphazardly and distributed in either two or three dimensional matrix, as shown in the drawing, a 2D film, as in figure 4 of the drawing or 3D component, as in figure 5 of the drawing, where each of these particles with hundreds of facets and angles, positions itself in the matrix at a specific distance from each other and at specific angle. Due to the different chemical composition of each of them, their texture, size, shape, facets, color, reflect, refract and transmit light in a very unique pattern. This mixture is embedded with a selected solvent for selectively dissolving some particles, some of them and not all of them. If a light sensitive dye is added to the section of the mixture it will also be sensitive to different light to create a different shaded or colored image.<br><br>
A Product, if this multiple particles of various matters are mixed and spread, with a solvent on a substrate like a film and laminated between layers, we get a tag. If it is applied on to a film or paper coated with a strong adhesive and stuck on to a release paper, we get a peal and stick sticker, as shown in the, Figure 4 of the drawing.<br>
This mixture can be embedded into a transparent or translucent round rod, a hexagon, a square or any shape as shown in the drawing, as in figures 2 &amp; 3 and create a machine readable tag or key, as in figure 5 in the drawing. The film strip, the different shaped moldings can all be used as a identification tag, a tag attached to garments, books, leather products, baggage, as security tag, or as a security ID for consumer or industrial products of all descriptions. An identification key for a locking system, which can be scanned recorded and read with scanner, hand held or general scanner and the necessary software with light. A magnetic reader recorder can be used, if some of the particles in the mixture are ferrous oxides and can be magnetized. This tag can be scanned with a laser scanner and software and recorded for future reading and identification or the optical scanner reader recorder.<br>
Indian software specialist has developed scanning software that can scan, record and read, compare and validate 2D and 3D images and units.<br>
A product, film tag, a molded identification unit, can further be embedded with micro text, micro images or laser coding, below in the substrata or over on the top layer, to enhance their security value and range. In addition to the solvent created image and the light sensitive dye created color, very small laser-coded metalized film pieces can also be included. Small pieces of hologram, film or films with holograms can be cut into very very small pieces and mixed along with the particles. The substrate film or any substrate used, can be coded, micro printed, laser etched, design die stamped, monogrammed, engraved into the under layer or repeat the same on to the overcoat layer.<br>
This Product, tag or key, can be further chemically etched, treated, color coded in addition to the above mentioned process, if need be, for further enhancement of its security value and range in the consumer or industrial fields.<br>
This product the identification tags, after embedding the multidimensional particles and solvent can be further processed. The rods, squares, hexagons can be further machined shaped into various shapes or molded into several shapes, as shown in the drawing. This unit can be die stamped with the users identification name, number, monogram, logo, date stamp and other manufacturing details.<br><br>
The process can also be used to embed the particles of various matter, with solvent in the manufacturing process. In plastic blow molding, injection moldings, the strip produced in the process can be pasted on the product and if the particles are carefully selected to withstand heat and pressure in the process, the film base will melt away, leaving only the selected particles and mark embedded in the area of the product. If the particles are pasted onto silicon coated release paper, and made into a sticker the image can be transferred onto a ceramic product, when the clay is wet. The same release process can be employed in various other manufacturing areas. The Selection of the particles, the solvent and the adhesive must be able to withstand the manufacturing process, heat and pressure.<br>
The energy reflected refracted or transmitted of the image depends on the chemical composition of the particles and the wavelength of light used, the types of energy projected at the area where the mixture is embedded, nature of light, angle the light used, the distance the light source is placed from the unit, like in the enclosed drawing. The dissolved solvents create watermark around the scattered non-dissolved matter in the substrate.<br>
This solid matter or semi solid resin can be shaped into any shape like, strips, slabs, sheets, rods, and hexagons or shaped into various shapes of different sizes, in plastics. Metal components are embedded with selected particles that are distinct from the surrounding metal. When ultrasound, laser or energy in any form is projected or bounced of these particles with the watermark, the reflected, refracted and transmitted image are captured and recorded. This becomes an identification mark of that unit. Each and every out-put recorded will be different from each other.<br>
A light or energy source is projected on to this above created film, strips, sheet, rods or moldings, components or article of varying size, shape, texture and its multi-colored reflection and refraction are captured and recorded. The signature of each element or compound and their multi-faceted particles, set at a given angle in the matrix, and at specific distance from each other records different images to different kinds of light. These images are captured on to a photographic media, a recording medium like film, magnetic medium or any permanent or temporary recording medium and processed. A camera, a scanner, any known photographic recording methods, magnetic recording, optical recording, X-ray can all be used as the case may be, depending on the requirements.<br><br>
Each and every energy output when projected on to the above prepared film or three dimensional composite or component or product, create an output that is different under normal day light, incandescence light, uv, different colored lights, belonging to the different segment of the entire energy wave band. The source of the light energy, the intensity of the energy output, the distance, the angle, the mixture of different color, the selection of multiple energy output, all of them when projected on the above-prepared surface create different reflected, refracted and transmitted images.<br>
If the particles are embedded in a transparent, translucent or opaque substance, then light penetrating through from above or from side, or bottom as in a transparent glass or plastic will all create different reflected and refracted patterns and output, as shown in the drawing. This can be varied either with the density of the matrix, change in intensity of light or energy, variations in color, angle or distance of light from the object. This output created can be recorded and read via a scanner and the software their in. It will be noted that each and every pattern thus produced and recorded is different from each other and cannot be recreated by creating another embedding, molding or composite mixture.<br>
This very reflective and refractive light or energy output can be captured using any known recording medium like photographic film, magnetic tape, DVD, CD, floppy, coated paper, film, chemical coated cloth and X-Rays. When light or energy falls on a multi-faceted object it gets reflected like a mirror from some facets direct to the angle of light. It also gets refracted from the angled facets of the object, like facets of a diamond. If the particles are transparent then the energy beam passing through gets modified.<br>
Also recorded in the image, is the distinct water marks created in the surrounding surface or area by the dissolved particles in the solvent. They create a specific distinct marking depending on their chemical composition and color.<br>
Thus created composite distributed mixture, design, spacing of the particle from each other, colors, textures, angle of facets, watermark in the embedded matrix, all together reflect refract and transmit energy, to form a very distinct out put, each time energy is bounced of it. This can be captured, recorded and embedded into a product or process using software.<br>
The particle with the solvent, with or without the light sensitive dye can also be mixed into a resin or similar material and shaped into a capsule, a flat strip, or shaped as required and embedded into a product, as shown on the jar in figure 1 of the drawing, under the outer layer or pasted onto the metal part of a car, as shown in figure 6 of the drawing, and then painted over or inserted under the outer layer of a product or in capsule in glass and insert under the skin of an animal for identification, as in figure 7 of the drawing.<br><br>
This will avoid it being seen. The embedded capsule can be read, recorded and checked via a scanner reader. The scanners can be varied depending on their requirement, laser scanner, ultra sound scanner. Infrared scanner, X-ray, or any of the various scanners in use.<br>
The strips, tags and their chemical compositions can be checked and verified using a photo spectrometer. This opens a range of uses where the minutest traces of the chemicals used in its manufacturing, embedding and coding can be recalled and identified. This will help to identify the tag, with its original master records. This will help in very precise identification of the unit and its manufacturing identity.<br>
If need be, divide the image and embed its parts at different areas. These parts can be used for identification or as a key for putting the whole together as in a jigsaw puzzle, using the software developed to compare these with the original recorded image in the master file. The master original design saved in the data Bank is absolutely necessary to identify the composite reflected refracted and transmitted energy output image embedded into any product or software.<br>
This verification and authentication can be done only if the person or the automation software has access to the original full, complete recorded design and image for assembling and comparing the same with the master record file.<br>
Thus created physical composite embedding can also be used directly for marking and identifying or as a security tag as a whole or in parts, after having recorded the complete unit into the master file. This can be digitalized, divided into parts if need be and embedded into articles, digital photos, multimedia images, software, art work, movie images and cartoons. The divided parts can be put together like a jigsaw puzzle to complete the whole and identify the composite unit as in the original.<br>
The same mixture can be embedded into a transparent or translucent or opaque matter, or affixed on to a product where in the complex pattern thus embedded in the component can be read by a scanner using light source or scanned by a magnetic or x-ray scanner and read by the necessary software.<br>
The greatest security feature of this product is that, there are hundreds or thousands of variables in creating and capturing the image. Multiple particles . and pieces of various matter (thousand of variety to choose from) and in multiple dimensions are selected and used. The original or master creator is the only person who will have a sample or master record of his selection and creation. Any amount of duplication or trying to recreate the product or image by selecting, experimenting with the mixture, composition, solvent, dye selection, light source mixing and matching, positions, distances or angles being changed will never give the same recording as in the original master recorded image.<br><br>
When the original creator of the images starts his work, he first selects the particles with much care. The tiny particles and pieces selected can be from an element, compound or substance. He can choose sulfur, carbon, sand, wood, and glass particles of various colors. Potassium particles, ceramic, salt, sugar, and soil particles, various kinds of seeds, particles of thousand of chemical compounds, metalized film, very small cut up holograms, paper particles, particles of various plastics, metal particles, metal oxide particles, the selection list is extremely large and long. After he has selected particles and small pieces, each and its quantity, the size and color, then he can select the mixture proportion of each of them in the over all volume. The composition, the colors he wants in the mixture, the texture of the particles that will give his end image a unique look, the size of the particles, a mixture that cannot be easily duplicated with known easily available particles, will all have to be taken into consideration by the producer.<br>
After the right mix is created with the selected particles and very small pieces, a solvent has to be selected, that will react and dissolve specific particles in the mixture, while not reacting with the others particles in the mixture. It is the specifically selected solvent that will dissolve a selected set of particles, that he wants and migrate into the strata or surrounding area and create the distinct design outline and image, spreading in between and around the non-dissolved particles in the mixture. Solvent mark "SM" in figure 2 &amp; 3 of the drawing.<br>
After carefully selecting the particle mix and selecting the solvent, he mixes and applies them on film, paper, or suitable strata, or on to a product he wants to code, like a ceramic pot, artwork, into a consumer or industrial product with a very strong adhesive. If it is pasted on a film or paper it can be laminated over, with clear film. If the particles are on a release paper it can be transfer embedded on to the product. The particle and solvent can be directly embedded on to a product area and heat-sealed permanently. The particles can be transferred on to a product from the release sticker with a strong adhesive. The particles can also be applied directly on to the product during manufacturing process with a strong adhesive or when the surface is wet, or soft due to heat. In some manufacturing process it can be applied by pressure.<br>
In the next stage he selects the light source, white light, colored light, uv, infrared, ultra violet, or any of the known source of light and energy out put units, in single stand alone unit or in combination of several units, positioned at various distances and at various angles in relation with the unit, component to be photographed or recorded, as shown in figure 8 of the drawing.<br>
The next stage is to select the various recording medium, like camera, scanner, magnetic recording medium, optical recording  medium, Hard disk, CD, DVD. Digital cameras, x-Ray, ultrasound scanner recorder, infrared scanner recorder, and a range of special equipments like photo spectrometer.<br><br>
After the images are taken with the light or lights at a given distance and angle from the photographed unit, with the recording units like the camera, they are recorded to create a master image. The original creator of the master image specially must records all parameters of the recording.<br>
After recording the master image, it is carefully stored .It can be further processed if necessary. The master image will become the benchmark for all future cross checking, references and authentication.<br>
Any software can be used for digitalizing the recorded image and to incorporate the same into all Internet related products and services on the net, like software, digital art, photos, multimedia pictures, cartoon creations and moving pictures. A physical insertion can be made into any manufactured product. The digitalized image in full, in part, in jigsaw pattern can be segmented and can be incorporated for greater security and safety into any product or service in the real world or on the Internet. Various softwares, for various end uses like high security systems, can further process this captured image or images.<br>
Only the original creator producer of the design and pattern will have all the exact specifications and details of the image created. The components used, including the physical verifiable strip, tag or physical sticker and the methods adopted, the distances, angles and light used will only be known to him. Most important of all, the entire master image in full is only available with him. Only he can select compare and authenticate the embedded security images in the marketed products or services, authenticate and confirm the image in question as an original or a duplicate.<br><br><br><br>
