				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a N-6 Substituted 7-Deazapurine Compound.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Adenosine is an ubiquitous modulator of numerous physiological activities, particularly within the cardiovascular and nervous systems. The effects of adenosine appear to be mediated by specific cell surface receptor proteins. Adenosine modulates diverse physiological functions including induction of sedation, vasodilation, suppression of cardiac rate and contractility, inhibition of platelet aggregability, stimulation of gluconeogenesis and inhibition of lipolysis. In addition to its effects on adenylate cyclase, adenosine has been shown to open potassium channels, reduce flux through calcium channels, and inhibit or stimulate phosphoinositide turnover through receptor-mediated mechanisms (See for example, C. E. Muller and B. Stein "Adenosine Receptor Antagonists: Structures and Potential Therapeutic Applications" Current Pharmaceutical Design, 2: 501 (1996) and C. E. Muller "A1-Adenosine Receptor Antagonists," Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents 7 (5): 419 (1997)).<br><br>
Adenosine receptors belong to the superfamily of purine receptors which are currently subdivided into Pl (adenosine) and P2 (ATP, ADP, and other nucleotides) receptors. Four receptor subtypes for the nucleoside adenosine have been cloned so far from various species including humans. Two receptor subtypes (A, and A2a) exhibit affinity for adenosine in the nanomolar range while two other known subtypes A2b and A3 are low-affinity receptors, with affinity for adenosine in the low-micromolar range. Ax and A3 adenosine receptor activation can lead to an inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity, while A2a and A2b activation causes a stimulation of adenylate cyclase.<br>
A few A, antagonists have been developed for the treatment of cognitive disease, renal failure, and cardiac arrhythmias. It has been suggested that A2a antagonists may be beneficial for patients suffering from Morbus Parkinson (Parkinson's disease). Particularly in view of the potential for local delivery, adenosine receptor antagonists may be valuable for treatment of allergic inflammation and asthma. Available information (for example, Nyce &amp; Metzger "DNA antisense Therapy for Asthma in an Animal Model" Nature (1997) 385:<br>
721-5)indicates that in this pathophysiologic context, Aj antagonists may block contraction of smooth muscle underlying respiratory epithelia, while A2b or A3 receptor antagonists may block mast cell degranulation, mitigating the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators. A-,b receptors have been discovered throughout the gastrointestinal tract, especially in the colon and the intestinal epithelia. It has been suggested that A:b receptors mediate cAMP response (Strchmeier ec al. , J. Bio. Chem. (1995) 270:2387-94).<br>
Adenosine receptors have also been shown to exist on the retinas of various mammalian species including bovine, porcine, monkey, rat, guinea pig, mouse, rabbit and human (See, Blazynski et al., Discrete Distributions of Adenosine<br>
Receptors in Mammalian .Retina, Journal of Neurochemistry, volume   54,   pages   648-655   (1990);   Woods   et  al., Characterization of Adenosine A,-.Receptor Binding Sites in Bovine Retinal Membranes, Experimental Eye Research, volume 53,  pages 325-331  (1991); and Braas et al . ,  Endogenous adenosine and adenosine receptors localized to ganglion cells of  the retina,  Proceedings of the National Academy of Science,  volume 84,  pages 3906-3910  (1987)).   Recently,<br>
Williams reported the observation of adenosine transport sites in a cultured human retinal cell line (Williams et al., Nuclecside Transport Sites in a Cultured Human Retinal Cell Line Established By SV-40 T Antigen Gene,  Current Eye Research, volume 13, pages 109-118 (1994)).<br>
Compounds which regulate the uptake of adenosine uptake have previously been suggested as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of retinal and optic nerve head damage. In U.S. Patent No. 5,780,450 to Shade, Shade discusses the use of adenosine uptake inhibitors for treating eye disorders. Shade doe's not disclose the use of specific A3 receptor inhibitors. The entire contents of U.S. Patent No. 5,780,450 are hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Additional adenosine receptor antagonists are needed as pharmacological tools and are of considerable interest as drugs for the above-referenced disease states and/or conditions.<br>

bridged with alicyclic or heterocyclic rings which are not<br>
aromatic so as to form a polycycle (e.g., tetralin).<br>
The terms "alkenyl" and "alkynyl" refer to unsaturated aliphatic groups analogous in length and possible substitution to the alkyls described above, but that contain at least one double or triple bond respectively. For example, the invention contemplates cyano and propargyl groups.<br>
Unless the number of carbons is otherwise specified, "lower aikyl" as used herein means an alkyl group, as defined above, but having from one to ten carbons, more preferably from one to six carbon atoms in its backbone structure, even more preferably one to three carbon atoms in its backbone structure.

Ail such isomeric forms of these compounds are expressly included in this invention. Each stereogenic carbon may be of the R or S configuration. It is to be understood accordingly that the isomers arising from such asymmetry (e.g., all<br>
enantiomers and diastereomers) are included within the scope of this invention, unless indicated otherwise. Such isomers can be obtained in substantially pure form by classical separation techniques and by stereochemically controlled synthesis.<br>
The invention further pertains to pharmaceutical compositions for treating a N-6 substituted 7-deazapurine responsive state in a mammal, e.g., respiratory disorders (e.g.. asthma,<br>
bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, and allergic rhinitis), renal disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and eye disorders. The pharmaceutical composition includes a therapeutically effective amount of a N-6 substituted 7-deazapurine, described supra, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. It is to be understood, that all of the deazapurines described above are included for therapeutic treatment.

The term "anticancer agent" is art recognized and is intended to include those agents which diminish, eradicate, or prevent growth of cancer cells without, preferably, adversely affecting ether physiological functions. Representative examples include cisplatin and cyclophosphamide.<br>
When the compounds of the present invention are administered as Pharmaceuticals, to humans and mammals, they can be given per se or as a pharmaceutical composition containing, for example, 0.1 to 99.5% (more preferably, 0.5 to 90%) of active ingredient in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" as used herein  means  a  pharmaceutically  acceptable  material, composition or vehicle, such as a liquid or solid filler, diluent,  excipient,  solvent  or  encapsulating  material, involved in carrying or transporting a compound (s) of the<br>
present invention within cr to the subject such tr.at it can performs its intended function. Typically, such compounds are carried or transported from one organ, cr portion cf the body, to another crgan, or portion cf the body. Each carrier must be "acceptable" in the sense cf being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not injurious to the patient. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include: sugars, sue.-, as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose, and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin,- talc; excipients, such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes,- oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; glycols, such as prcpylene glycol; pclycls, such as glycerin, scrbitol, manr.itol and polyethylene giycoi; esters, such as ethyl cleats and ethyl laurate; agar,- buffering agents, such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isoconic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol; phosphate buffer solutions; and other non-toxic compatible substances employed in pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
As set out above, certain embodiments of the present compounds can contain a basic functional group, such as amino cr alkylamino, and are, thus, capable of forming pharmaceuticaliy acceptable salts with pharmaceutically acceptable acids. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" in this respect, refers to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic acid addition salts of compounds of the present invention. These salts can be prepared in situ<br>
during the final isolation and purification of the compounds cf the invention, cr by separately reacting a purified compound of the invention in its free base form with a suitable organic or inorganic acid, and isolating the salt thus formed. Representative salts include the hydrofaromide, hydrochloride, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, nitrate.<br>
acetate, valerate, cleate, palmitate, stesrate, laurate. ber.zoate, lactate, phosphate, tosylate, citrate, rr.aleare. fumarate, succinate, tartrate, napthylate, rr.esylste, clucoheptonate , lactobicnate , and lauryisulphc~ate salts and the like. (See, e.g., Berge ec aJ . -(1577) "Pharmaceutical<br>
Salts", J. Phann. Sci . 66:1-19).<br>
In other 'cases, the compounds of the present invention may contain one or more acidic functional groups and, thus, are capable of forming pharmaceutically acceptable salts with pharmaceuticaily acceptable bases. The terir. "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" in these instances refers to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic base addition salts of compounds of the present invention. These salts can likewise be prepared in sizu during the final<br>
isolation and purification of the compounds, or by separately reacting the purified compound in its free acid form with a suitable base, such as the hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate of a pharmaceutically acceptable metal cation, with ammonia, or with a pharmaceutically acceptable organic primary, secondary or tertiary amine . Representative alkali or alkaline earth salts include the lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and aluminum salts and the like. Representative organic amines useful for the formation of base addition salts include ethylamine, diethylamine , ethylenediamine , ethanolamine , diethanolamine , piperazine and the like.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable esters" refers to the relatively non-toxic, esterified products of the compounds of the present invention. These esters can be prepared in situ<br>
during the final isolation and purification of the compounds, or by separately reacting the purified compound in its free acid form or hydroxyl with a suitable esterifying agent. Carboxylic acids can be converted into esters via treatment<br>
with an alcohol in the presence of a catalyst. Hydroxyl containing derivatives can be converted into esters via<br>
treatment with ar. estenfying agent such as alkanoyl halides. The term is further intended to include lower hydrocarbon groups capable of being solvated under physiological conditions, e.g., alkyl esters, methyl, ethyl and propyl esters. (See, for example, Berge et a.1 . , supra.}<br>
The invention further contemplates the use of prcdrugs which are converted in vivo to the therapeutic compounds of the<br>
invention (see, e.g., R.B. Silverman,  1992,  "The Organic<br>
Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action", Academic Press, Chapter 8) . Such prodrugs can be used to alter the biodistribution (e.g., to allow compounds which would not<br>
typically enter the reactive site of the protease) or the pharmacokinetics of the therapeutic compound. For example, a carboxylic acid group, can be esterified, e.g., with a<br>
methyl group or an ethyl group to yield an ester. When the ester is administered to a subject, the ester is cleaved, enzymatically or non-enzymatically, reductively or hydrolytically, to reveal the anionic group. An anionic group can be esterified with moieties (e.g., acyloxymethyl<br>
esters) which are cleaved to reveal an intermediate compound which subsequently decomposes to yield the active compound. In another embodiment, the prodrug is a reduced form of a sulfate or sulfonate, e.g., a thiol, which is oxidized in<br>
vivo to the therapeutic compound.  Furthermore, an anionic<br>
moiety can be esterified to a group which is actively transported in vivo, or which is selectively taken up by<br>
target organs. The ester can be selected to allow specific targeting of the therapeutic moieties to particular reactive sites, as described below for carrier moieties.<br>
Wetting agents, emulsifiers and lubricants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, release agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the compositions.<br>
Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable anticxidar.ts include: water soluble anticxidants, such as asccrbic acid, cysteine hydrochlcride, sodium bisulfate, scdiurr, metabisulfite, sodium sulfite and the like; oil-soluble antioxidants. such as asccrbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyaniscle (3HA: , butylated hydrcxytoluene (BHT) , lecithin, prcpyl gallate,' alpha-tocopherol, and the like; and metal chelating ager.ts, such as citric acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (E27A) , scrbitcl, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like.<br>
Formulations of the present invention include those suitable for oral, nasal, topical, transdermal, buccal, sublingual, rectal, vaginal and/or parenteral administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the compound which produces a therapeutic effect. Generally, out of one hundred per cent, this amount will range from about 1 per cent to about ninety-nine percent of active ingredient, preferably from about 5 per cent to about 70 per cent, most preferably from about 10 per cent to about 30 per cent.<br>
Methods of preparing these formulations or compositions include the step of bringing into association a compound of the present invention with the carrier and, optionally, one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association a compound of the present invention with liquid carriers, or finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.<br>
Formulations   cf   the   invention   suitable   for   oral administration may be in the form of capsules, cachets, pills, tablets, lozenges (using a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth), powders, granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous<br>
liquid, or as an cil-in-water cr water-ir.-cil liquid emulsion, cr as ar. elixir cr syrup, cr as pastilles lusi.ng an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, cr sucrose and acacia) and/or as mouth washes and the like, each containing a predetermined amount of a compound of the present invention as an active ingredient. A compound of the present invention may also be administered as a bolus, electuary or paste.<br>
In solid dosage forms of the invention for oral administration (capsules, tablets, pills, dragees, powders, granules and the like) , the active ingredient is mixed with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate, and/or any of the following: fillers cr extenders, such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and/or silicic acid; binders, such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sucrose and/or acacia; humectants, such as glycerol; disintegrating agents, such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate; solution retarding agents, such as paraffin; absorption accelerators, such as quaternary ammonium compounds,- wetting agents, such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol mcnostearate; absorbents, such as kaolin and bentonite clay; lubricants, such a talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof; and coloring agents. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise buffering agents. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose cr milk sugars, as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glyccls and the like.<br>
A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared using binder (for example, gelatin or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose), lubricant, inert diluent,<br>
preservative, disintegrant (for example, sodium search glycclate or cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose', surface-active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture cf the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.<br>
The tablets, and other solid dosage forms of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, such as dragees, capsules, pills and granules, may optionally be scored or prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical -formulating art. They may also be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile, other polymer matrices, liposomes and/or microspheres. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in' sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use. These compositions may also optionally contain opacifying agents and may be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain portion of the gastrointestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active ingredient can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-described excipients.<br>
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration of the compounds of  the  invention  include  pharmaceutically  acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active ingredient, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert dilutents commonly used in the art,  such  as,  for  example,  water  or  other  solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol, iscpropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl<br>
alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycoi, 1, 3-butyler.e glycol, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene clycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Besides inert dilutents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, coloring, perfuming and preservative agents.<br>
Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols,  polyoxyethylene  sorbitol  and sorbitan esters, miorocrystalline   cellulose,   aluminum   metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Formulations of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention for rectal or vaginal administration may be presented as a suppository, which may be prepared by mixing one or more compounds of the invention with one or more suitable n~nirritating excipients or carriers comprising, for example, c oa butter, polyethylene glyccl, a suppository wax or a salicylate, and which is solid at room temperature, but liquid at body temperature and, therefore, will melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.<br>
Formulations of the present invention which are suitable for vaginal administration also include pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.<br>
Dosage forms for the topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include powders, sprays, ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, solutions, patches and inhalants. The active compound may be mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmac-eutically acceptable carrier, and with any preservatives, buffers, or propellants which may be<br>
required.<br>
The ointments, pastes, creams and gels may contain, in addition 'to an active compound of this invention, excipients, such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc and tine oxide, or mixtures thereof.<br>
Powders and sprays can contain, in addition to a compound of this invention, excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates and polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary propellar.es, such as chlcrcfluorchydrocarbons and volatile unsubstituted hydrocarbons, such as butane and propane.<br>
Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound of the present invention to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispersing the compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate of such flux can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or dispersing the active compound in a polymer matrix or gel.<br>
Ophthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders, solutions and the like, are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Preferably, the pharmaceutical preparation is an ophthalmic formulation (e.g., an periocular, retrobulbar or intraocular injection formulation, a systemic formulation, or a surgical irrigating solution).<br>
The ophthalmic formulations of the present invention may include one or more deazapurines and a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. Various types of vehicles may be used. The vehicles will generally be aqueous in nature. Aqueous solutions are generally preferred, based on case of<br>
formulation, as wel. as a patient's anility to easi.y administer such compositions by means of instilling one tr two drops of the solutions in the affected eyes. However, the deazapunnes of the present invention nay also be readily incorporated into other types of compositions, such as suspensions, viscous or semi-viscous gels or other types of solid or semi-solid compositions. The ophthalmic compositions of the present invention may also include various other ingredients, such as buffers, preservatives, co-solvents and viscosity building agents.<br>
An appropriate buffer system (e.g., sodium phosphate, sodium acetate or sodium borate) may be added to prevent pH drift under storage conditions.<br>
Ophthalmic products are typically packaged in multidose form. Preservatives are thus required . to prevent microbial contamination during use. Suitable preservatives include: benzalkonium chloride, thimerosal, chlorobutanol, methyl paraben, propyl paraben, phenylethyl alcohol, edetate disodium, sorbic acid, polyquaternium-1, or other agents known to those skilled in the art. Such preservatives are typically employed at a level of from 0.001 to 1.0% weight/volume ("% w/v") .<br>
When the deazapurines of the present invention are administered during intraocular surgical procedures, such as through retrobulbar or periocular injection and intraocular perfusion or injection, the use of balanced salt irrigating solutions as vehicles are most preferred. ESS® Sterile Irrigating Solution and BSS Plus® Sterile Intraocular Irrigating Solution (Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, Texas, USA) are examples of physiologically balanced intraocular irrigating solutions. The latter type of solution is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,550,022 (Garabedian, ec al.} , the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated<br>
in the present specification by reference.  Retrcbulbar and periocular inactions are known to those skilled in the art<br>
and are described in numerous publications including, fcr example, Ophthalmic Surgery: Principles of Practice, Ed., C-. L. Spaeth. W. B. Sanders Co., Philadelphia, Pa., U.S.A., pages 85-87 (1990).<br>
As indicated above, use of deazapunnes to prevent cr reduce damage to retinal and optic nerve head tissues at the cellular level is a particularly important aspect of one embodiment of the invention. Ophthalmic conditions which may be treated include, but are not limited to, retinopathies, macular degeneraticn, ocular ischemia, glaucoma, and damage associated with injuries to ophthalmic tissues, such as ischemia reperfusion injuries, photochemical injuries, and injuries associated with ocular surgery, particularly injuries to the retina or optic nerve head by exposure to light cr surgical instruments. The compounds may also be used as an adjunct to ophthalmic surgery, such as by vitreal or subconjunctival injection following ophthalmic surgery. The compounds may be used for acute treatment of temporary conditions, or may be administered chronically, especially in the case of degenerative disease. The compounds may also be used prophyiactically, especially prior to ocular surgery or noninvasive ophthalmic procedures, or other types of surgery.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention suitable for parenteral administration comprise one or more compounds of the invention in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or ncr.aqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use, which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient cr suspending or thickening agents.<br>
Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers which may be emplcyed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol,<br>
propylene glycol, polyethylene glyccl, and the like! , ar.d suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as clive:cil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl cleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.<br>
These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol scrbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.<br>
In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parer.terally-administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.<br>
Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the subject compounds in biodegradable polymers such as pclylactide-polyglycolide. Depending on the ratio of drug to polymer, and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include polyicrthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable<br>
formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug ir. liposomes or microemuisions which are compatible with body tissue.<br>
The preparations of the present invention may be given orally, parenterally, topically, or rectally. They are of course given by forms suitable for each administration route. For example, they are administered in tablets or capsule form, by injection, inhalation, eye lotion, ointment, suppository, etc. administration by injection, infusion or inhalation; topical by lotion or ointment; and rectal by suppositories. Oral administration is preferred.<br>
The phrases "parenteral administration" and "administered parenterally" as used herein means modes of administration other than enteral and topical administration, usually by injection, and includes, without limitation,  intravenous, intramuscular,  intraarterial,  intrathecal,  intracapsular, intraorbital,  intracardiac,  intradermal,  intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous,, subcuticular,  intraarticular, subcapsular,  subarachnoid,  intraspinal  and  intrasternal injection and infusion.<br>
The phrases "systemic administration," "administered systematically," "peripheral administration" and "administered peripherally" as used herein mean the administration of a compound, drug or other material other than directly into the central nervous system, such that it enters the patient's system and, thus, is subject to metabolism and other like processes, for example, subcutaneous administration.<br>
These compounds may be administered to humans and other animals for therapy by any suitable route of administration, including orally, nasally, as by, for example, a spray, rectally, intravaginally, parenterally, intracisternally and topically, as by powders, ointments or drops, including buccaily and sublingually.<br>

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS<br>
The deazapurines of the invention can be prepared using standard methods for organic synthesis. Deazapurines can be purified by reverse phase KPLC, chromatography, recrystallization, etc. and their structures confirmed by mass spectral analysis, elemental analysis, IR and/or NMR spectroscopy.<br>
Typically, synthesis of the intermediates as well as the deazapurines of the invention is performed in solution. The addition and removal of one or more protecting group is also typical practice and is known to those skilled in the art. Typical synthetic schemes for the preparation of deazapurine intermediates of the invention are outlined below in Scheme (Figure Remove)<br>
wherein R3, R5 and R6 are as defined above.<br>
In general, a protected 2-amino-3-cyano-pyrrole can be treated with an acyl halide to form a carboxyamido-3-cyanc-pyrrole which can be treated with acidic methanol to effect ring closure to a pyrrolo [2, 3d] pyrimidine-4 (3H)-one (Muller,<br>
C.E. et aJ. J. Med. Chem. 40:4396 (1997)).  Removal of the<br>
pyrrolo protecting group followed by treatment with a chlorinating reagent, e.g., phosphorous oxychloride, produced<br>
substituted or unsubstituted 4-chloro-7H-pyrrolo [2, 3d] pyrimidines . Treatment of the chloropyrimidine with amines afforded 7-deazapurines.<br>
For example, as shown in Scheme I/ a N-(l-dl-phenylethyl)-2-<br>
amino-3-cyano-pyrrole was treated with an acyl halide in pyridine and dichloromethane. The resultant N-(l-dJ-<br>
phenylethyl)-2-phenylcarboxyamido-3-cyano-pyrrole was treated with a 10:1 mixture of methanol/sulfuric acid to effect ring closure, resulting in a dI-7H-7-(l-<br>
phenylethyl)pyrrolo[2,3d]pyrimidine-4(3H)-one.   Removal of the phertylethyl group by treatment of the pyrimidine with polyphosphoric acid (PPA) followed by POC13 afforded a key intermediate, the 4-chloro-7H-pyrrolo[2,3d]pyrimidine. Further treatment of the 4-chloro-7H-pyrrolo[2,3d]pyrimidine with various amines listed in Table 1 gives compounds of formula (I) and (II). (Figure Remove)<br><br>
A general approach to prepare 6-substituted pyrroles is depicted in the following scheme (Scheme II).<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Transesterification and alkylation of. ethyl cyanoacetate with an a-haloketone affords a ketomethylester. Protection of the ketone followed by treatment with an amidine (e.g., alkyl,<br>
aryl or alkylaryl) hydrochloride produced the resultant ketal protected pyrimidine. Removal of the protecting group, followed by cyclization and treatment with phosphorous cxychloride afforded the -hloride intermediate which could be further treated with ;i amine to afford an amine 6-<br>
substituted pyrrole.  Additionally, alkylation of the pyrrcle nitrogen can be achieved under art recognized conditions.<br>
A general approach to prepare 5-substituted pyrroles is depicted in the following scheme (Scheme III). <br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br>
wherein R]_ through Rg are defined as above and R is a removable protecting group.<br>
Condensation of malononitrile and an excess of a ketone followed by bromination of the product afforded a mixture of starting material, monobrominated and dibrominated products which were treated with an alkylamine, arylamine or alkylarylamine. The resultant amine product was acylated with an acid chloride and the monacylated pyrrole was<br>
cyclized in the presence of acid to afford the corresponding pyrimidine. The pyrrole protecting group was removed with polyphosphoric acid and treated with phosphorous cxychlcride to produce a chlorinated product. The chlorinated pyrrole could subsequently be treated with an amine to produce an ammo 5-substituted pyrrole. Alkylation of the pyrrole nitrogen can be achieved under art recognized conditions.<br>

wherein R$ and R§ are as described above, e.g., CH3.<br>
Specifie Preparation of 6-methvl pyrrolopyrimidinea:<br>
The key reaction toward 6-methylpyrrolopyrimidines (I) CH3] was cyclization of a cyanoacetate with benzamidine to a pyrimidine. It was believed methyl cyanoacetate would cyclize more efficiently with benzamidine to a pyrimidine than the corresponding ethyl ester. Therefore, transesterification and alkylation of ethyl cyanoacetate in the presence of NaOMe and an excess of an a-haloacetyl moiety, e.g., chloroacetone, gave the desired methyl ester<br>
(3) in 79V yield (Scheme IV) . The ketoester (3) was protected as the acetal (4) in 81V yield. A new' cyclization method to the pyrimidine (5) was achieved with an amidine hydrochlcride, e.g., benzamidine hydrochloride, with 2<br>
equivalents of DBU to afford the 5 in 54V isolated yield. This method improves the yield from 20% using the published conditions, which utilizes NaOMe during the cyclization with guanidine. Cyclization to the pyrrole-pyrimidine (6) was achieved via deprotection of the acetal in aqueous HCl in 78% yield. Reaction of (6) with phosphorous oxychloride at reflux gave the corresponding 4-chloro derivative (7) . Coupling with trans-4-aminocyclohexanol in dimethyl sulfoxide at 13 5 "C gave (1) in 57% from (7) . One skilled in the art will appreciate that choice of reagents allows for great flexibility in choosing the desired substituent R5.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Seific Prea.ra- a<br>
Knoevengel condensation of maloncnitrile and an excess kecone, e.g., acetone in refluxing benzene gave 8 in 50%<br>
yield  after distillation.    Bromination  of  8  with  N-<br>
bromosuccinimde in the presence of benzoyl peroxide in chloroform yielded a mixture of starting material, mono- (9), and ci-brominated products (5/90/5) after distillation (70%) . The mixture was reacted with an a-methylalkylamine or o-methylarylamine, e.g., a-methylbenzylamine, to deliver the<br>
aminopyrrole (10) . After passing through a short silica gel column, the partially purified amine (31% yield) was acylated with an acid chloride, e.g., benzoyl chloride to deliver<br>
mono- (11), and diacylated (12) pyrroles, which were separated by fla;'- chromatography. Acid hydrolysis of the disubstituted pyrrole (12) generated a combined yield of 29V for the acylpyrrole (11) . Cyclization in the presence of concentrated sulphuric acid and DMF yielded (13) (23V), which was deprotected with polyphosphoric acid to (14). Reaction of (14) with phosphorous oxychloride at reflux gave the corresponding 4-chloro derivative (15). Coupling with trans-<br>
4 -aminocyclohexanol in dimethyl sulf oxide at 135°C gave (2) [R6 = CH3] in 30V from (14)  (See Scheme V) .  One skilled in the art will appreciate that choice of reagents allows for great flexibility in choosing the desired substituent Rt.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Alternative Synthetic Route to rc- Substituted Pyrroles, e.g.. 5 -methvl<br>
This alternative route to Rg-substituted pyrroles, e.g., 5-<br>
methylpyrrolopyrimidines, involves transesterif ication and alkylation of ethyl cyanoacetate to (16) (Scheme VI) . The condensation of (16) with benzamidine hydrochlonde with 2 equivalents of DBU affords the pyrimidine (17) . Cyclization to the pyrrole-pyrimidine (14) will be achieved via deprotection of the acetal in aqueous HCl . Reaction of (14) with phosphorous oxychloride at reflux gave the corresponding 4-chloro derivative (15). Coupling with crans-4-<br>
aminocyclohexanol in dimethyl sulfoxide at 135°C gives 2. This procedure reduces the number of synthetic reactions to the target compound (2) from 9 to 4 steps. Moreover, the yield is dramatically improved. Again, one skilled in the art will appreciate that choice of reagents allows for great flexibility in choosing the desired substituent R6 .<br>

in the following scheme (Scheme VII)<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
wherein Rj through R3 are defined as above.<br>
Alkylation of an alkyl cyanoacetate with a diethyl acetal in the presence of a base afforded a cyano diethyl acetal which was treaced wich an amidine sale to produce a methyl pyrrclopyrimidine precursor. The precursor was chlorinated and treated with an amine to form the des-methyl<br>
pyrrolopyrimidine target as shown above.<br>
For example, Scheme VIII depicts the synthesis of compound (18) .<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Commercially available methyl cyanoacetate was alkylated with bromoacetaldehyde diethyl acetal in the presence of potassium carbonate and Nal to yield (19). Cyclization to the pyrimidine (20) was achieved in two steps. Initially, the pynrr.idine-acetal was formed via reaction of (19) with benzamidine hydrochloride with 2 equivalents of DBU. The resultant pyrimidine-acetal was deprotected without<br>
purification with aqueous 1 N HCl and the resultant aldehyde cyclized to the pyrrolo-pyrimidine (20), which was isolated by filtration. Reaction of (20) with phosphorous oxychloride at reflux afforded the corresponding 4-chloro derivative (21). Coupling of the chloro derivative with crans-4-<br>
aminocyclohexanol in DMSO at 135°C gave compound- (18) from compound (21).<br>
Schemes II-VIII demonstrate that it is possible to functionalize the 5- and 6-position of the pyrrolopyrimidine ring. Through the use of different starting reagents and slight modifications of the above reaction schemes, various functional groups can be introduced at the 5- and 6-positions in formula (I) and (II) .

Yeast  fc-Galactosidase  reporter  gene  assays  for  human adenosine A: and A2. receptor: Yeast strains (S. cerevisiae.'<br>
were transformed with human adenosine A: (A:R; CADUS strain CY126SO) or human A2a (A2a; CADUS strain CYS362! and the addition of a lacZ(3-Galactosidase) reporter gene tc utilize as a functional readout. A complete description of the transformations is listed below (see Yeast Strains). NECA (5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine), a potent adenosine receptor agonist with similar affinity for A: and a:i receptors, was used as a ligand for all assays. Test compounds were examined at 8 concentrations (0.1 - 10,000 nM) for ability to inhibit NECA-induced B-Galactosidase activity by CY12660 or CY8362.<br>
Preparation of Yeast Stock Cultures: Each of the respective yeast strains, CY12660 and CY8362, were streaked onto an LT agar plate and incubated at 30°C until colonies were observed. Yeast from these colonies were added to LT liquid (pH 6.8) and grown overnight at 30°C. Each yeast strain was then diluted to an OD60c = 1.0-2.0 (approximately 1-2 X l(f cells/ml), as determined spectrophotometrically (Molecular Devices VMAX). For each 6 ml of yeast liquid culture, 4 ml of 40V glycerol (1:1.5 volrvol) was added ("yeast/glycerol stock") . From this yeast/glycerol stock, ten 1 ml aliquots were prepared and stored at -80°C until required for assay.<br>
Yeast A, R and A2aR Assay: One vial each of CY8362 and CY12660 yeast/glycerol stock was thawed and used to inoculate Supplemented LT liquid media, pH 6.8 (92 ml LT liquid, to which is added: 5 ml of 40% glucose, 0.45 ml of 1M KOH and 2.5 ml of Pipes, pH 6.8). Liquid cultures were grown 16-18 hr (overnight) at 30°C. Aliquots from overnight cultures were then diluted in LT media, containing 4U/ml adenosine deaminase (Type VI or VII from calf intestinal mucosa, Sigma), to obtain OD,OC = 0.15 (1.5 X 10£ cells/ml) for CYB362 (A2aR) and OD(0&amp; =0.50 (5X10* cells/ml) for CY12660 (A,R) .<br>
Assays were conducted with a final volume of 100 ul in 96-'<br>
well rr.icrctiter places, such that a final concentration cf 2'-, DMSO was achieved in all wells.  For primary screening, 1-2 concentrations of test compounds were utilized (10 uM, iuM ) . For compound profiling, B concentrations were tested (1000C, 1000, 500, 100, 50, 10, 1 and 0.1 nM) . To each rr.icrotiter plate, 10 ul of 20% DMSO was added to "Control" and "Total" wells while 10 ul cf Test Compound (in 20% DMSO) was added to "Unknown" wells.  Subsequently, 10 ul of NECA (5 uM for A;R, 1 uM for A;aR) were added to "Total" and 'Unknown" wells; 10 ul of PBS was added to the "Control" wells.   In the final addition, 80 ul of yeast strain, CY8362 or CY12660, were added to all wells.  All plates were then agitated briefly (LabLine orbital shaker 2-3 min) and allowed to incubate for 4 hrs. at 30CC in a dry oven.<br>
3-Galactosidase activity can be guantitated using either cclcrimetnc (e.g., ONPG, CPRG) , luminescent (e.g., Galacton-Star) or fluorometric substrates (e.g., FDG, Resorufin) substrates. Currently, fluorescence detection is preferred on the basis of superior signal:noise ratio, relative freedom from interference and low cost. Fluorescein digalactopyranoside (FDG, Molecular Probes or Marker Gene Technologies), a fluorescent 3-Galactosidase substrate, was added to all wells at 20 ul/well (final concentration = 80 uM). Plates were shaken for 5-6 sec (LabLine orbital shaker) and then incubated at 37°C for 90 min (95% 0:/5% C0: incubator). At the end of the 90 min incubation period, 0-Galactosidase activity was stopped using 20 ul/well of 1M Na:CO, and all plates shaken for 5-6 sec. Plates were then agitated for 6 sec and relative fluorescence intensity determined using a fluorometer (Tecan Spectrafluor; excitation = 485 nm, emission = 535 nm).<br>
Calculations: Relative fluorescence values for "Control" wells were interpreted as background and subtracted from "Total" and "Unknown" values.   Compound profiles  were analyzed via logarithmic transformation (x-axis: compound concentration) followed by one site competition curve fitting to calculate<br>

Construction of Yeast Strains Expressing Human Ax Adenosine Receptor<br>
In this example, the construction of yeast strains expressing a human A, adenosine receptor functionally integrated into the yeast pheromone system pathway is described.<br>
I.  Expression Vector Construction<br>
To construct a yeast expression vector for the human AA adencsine receptor, the A: adenosine receptor cDNA was obtained by reverse transcriptase PCR of human hippocampus mRNA using primers designed based on the published sequence of the human A: adenosine receptor and standard techniques. The PCR product was subcloned into the Ncol and Xbal sites of the yeast expression plasmid pMPiS.<br>
The pMPIS plasmid was created from pLPXt as follows: The Xbal site of YEP51 (Broach, J.R. et al. (1983) "Vectors for high-level, inducible expression of cloned genes in yeast" p. 83-117 in M. Inouye (ed.), Experimental Manipulation of Gene Expression. Academic Press, New York) was eliminated by<br>
diaestion, end-fill and religacicn to create YepriNccCXba. Another Xbal site was created at the BamHI site by digesticr. with BamHI, end-fill, linker (New England Biolabs, £ 1081) ligation, Xbal digestion and re-ligation to generate YEPBlNccXt. This plasmid was digested with EspSl and NccI and ligated to Leu2 and PGKp fragments generated by PCR. The 2 kb Leu2 PCR product was generated by amplification from YEPSlNco using primers containing Esp31 and Bglll sites. The 660 base pair PGKp PCR product was generated by amplification from pPGKas (Kang, Y.-S. et al. (1990) Mol. Cell. Biol. i£:25S2-2590) with PCR primers containing Bglll and Ncol sites. The resulting plasmid is called pLPXt. pLPXt was modified by inserting the coding region of the a-factor pre-pro leader into the Ncol site. The prepro leader was inserted so that the Ncol cloning site was maintained at the 3' end of the leader, but not regenerated at the 5' end. In this way receptors can be cloned by digestion of the plasmid with Ncol and Xbal. The resulting plasmid is called pMP15.<br>
The pMPIS plasmid into which was inserted the human A: adenosine receptor cDNA was designated p5095. In this vector, the receptor cDNA is fused to the 3' end of the yeast a-factor prepro leader. During protein maturation the prepro peptide sequences are cleaved to generate mature full-length receptor. This occurs during processing of the receptor through the yeast secretory pathway. This plasmid is maintained by Leu selection (i.e., growth on medium lacking leucine) . The sequence of the cloned coding region was determined and found to be equivalent to that in the published literature (GenBank accession numbers S4S235 and S56143).<br>
II.  Yeast Strain Construction<br>
To create a yeast strain expressing the human A: adenosine receptor, yeast strain CY7967 was used as the starting parental strain. The genotype of CY7967 is as follows:<br>

Two piasmids were transformed into strain CYT?£~ ry electroporation: plasmid p50S5 (encoding human A: aaenosine receptor; described above) and plasmid pl584, which is a FUSl-3-galactosidase reporter gene plasmid. Plasmid pi584 was derived from plasmid pRS426 (Christiansen, 7.W. et ai.<br>
(19S2) Gene ii£:119-1122). Plasmid pRS426 contains a polylinker site at nucleotides 2004-2016. A fusion between the FUS1 promoter and the 0-galactosidase gene was inserted at the restriction sites EagI and Xhol to create plasmid p!584. The p!584 plasmid is maintained by Trp selection<br>
(i.e., growth on medium lacking leucine).<br>
The resultant strain carrying pS095 and p!5B4, referred to as CY12660, expresses the human A: adenosine receptor. To grow this strain in liquid or on agar plates, minimal media lacking leucine and tryptophan was used. To perform a growth assay on plates (assaying FUS1-HIS3), the plates were at pH 6.8 and contained 0.5-2.5 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and lacked leucine, tryptophan and histidine. As a, control for specificity, a comparison with one or more other yeast-based seven transmemfarane receptor screens was included in all experiments.<br>
Construction of Yeast Strains Expressing Human A2a Adenosine<br>
Receptor<br>
In this example, the construction of yeast strains expressing a human A2a adenosine receptor functionally integrated into the yeast pheromone system pathway is described.<br>
I.	Expression Vector Construction<br>
To construct a yeast expression vector for the human A2a adenosine receptor, the human A2a receptor cDNA was obtained from Dr. Phil Murphy (NIH) . Upon receipt of this clone, the A2a receptor insert was sequenced and found to be identical to the published sequence (GenBank accession # S46950) . The receptor cDNA was excised from the plasmid by PCR with VENT polymerase and cloned into the plasmid pLPBX, which drives receptor expression by a constitutive Phosphoglycerate Kinase (PGK) promoter in yeast. The sequence of the entire insert was once again sequenced and found to be identical with the published sequence. However, by virtue of the cloning strategy employed there were three amino acids appended to the carboxy-terminus of the receptor, GlySerVal.<br>
II.	Yeast Strain Construction<br>
To create a yeast strain expressing the human A2a adenosine receptor, yeast strain CY8342 was used as the starting parental strain. The genotype of CY8342 is as follows: MATa fariD1442 tbtl-1 Iys2 ura3 Ieu2 trpl his3 fusl-HIS3 canl ste3D1156 gpaD1163 ste!4::trpl::LYS2 gpalp-rGas£10K (or gpalp-rGasD229S or gpalp-rGasE10K+D229S)<br>
The genetic markers are as described in Example 1, except for the G-protein variation. For human A2a receptor-expression, yeast strains were utilized in which the endogenous yeast G protein GPA1 had been deleted and replaced by a mammalian Gas. Three rat GQS mutants were utilized. These variants contain one or two point mutations which convert them into proteins which couple efficiently to yeast by- They are identified as G,.E10K (in which the glutamic acid at position ten is<br>
replaced with lysine) , Ga.D229S (in which the aspartic arid a-<br>
position 229 is replaced with serine) and G,.E10KO225S (whicr. contains both point mutations).<br>
Strain CY8342 (carrying one of the three mutar.t rat Gas proteins) was transformed with either the parental vector pL?3X (Receptor") or with pLPBX-A2a (Receptor"). A plasmid with the FUS1 promoter fused to (3-galactosidase coding sequences (described in above) was added to assess the magnitude of activation of the pheromone response pathway.<br>
Functional Assay using Yeast Strains Expressing Human A-Adenosine Receptor<br>
In this example, the development of a functional screening assay in yeast for modulators of the human A: adenosine receptor is described.<br>
I.	Ligands Used in Assay<br>
Adenosine, a natural agonist for this receptor, as well as two other synthetic agonists were utilized for development of this assay. Adenosine, reported to have an ECiC of approximately 75 nM, and (-)-N6- (2-phenylisopropyl)-adenosine (PIA) with a reported affinity of approximately 50 nM were used in a subset of experiments. 5'-N-etnylcarboxamido-adenosine (NECA) was used in all growth assays. To prevent signaling due to the presence of adenosine in the growth media, adenosine deaminase (4U/ml) was added to all assays.<br>
II.	Biological Response in Yeast<br>
The ability of the A: adenosine receptor to functionally couple in a heterologous yeast system was assessed by introducing the A: receptor expression vector (p5095, described above) into a series of yeast strains that expressed different G protein subunits. The majority of these transformants expressed G0 subunits of the Gai or Gao subtype. Additional Ga proteins were also tested for the possible identification of promiscuous receptor-Ga protein coupling. In various strains, a STE18 or a chimeric STE18-<br>
Gy2 construct was integrated into the genome cf the yeast. The yeast strains harbored a defective KIS3 gene and ar. integrated copy of FUS1-HIS3, thereby allowing for selection in selective media containing 3-amino-l, 2 , 4-tnazole (tested at 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0 mM) and lacking histidine. Transfcrmar.ts were isolated and monolayers were prepared or. media containing 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, 4 U/ml adenosine deaminase and lacking histidine. Five microliters of various concentrations of ligand (e.g., NECA at 0, 0.1, 1.0 and 10 mM) was applied. Growth was monitored for 2 days. Ligand-dependent growth responses were tested in this manner in the various yeast strains. The results are summarized in Table 1 below. The symbol (-) indicates that ligand-dependent receptor activation was not detected while (») denotes ligand-dependent response. The term "LIRMA" indicates ligand indeoendent receotor mediated activation. (Table Remove)<br><br>
As indicated in Table 3, the most robust signaling was found to occur in a yeast strain expressing the GPA: (41) -Gai3 chimera.<br>
III.  fusl-LacZ Assay<br>
To characterize activation of the pheromone response pathway mere fully, synthesis of 0-galactosidase through fuslLacZ in response to agonist stimulation was measured. To perform the S-calactosidase assay, increasing concentrations of ligand were added to mid-log culture of human A: adenosine receptor<br>
expressed in a yeast strain co-expressing a Stel6-Gv2 chimera and GPA4}-GQ13. Trans f ormants were isolated and growr. overnight in the presence of histidine and 4 U/tr.l adencsir.e deaminase. After five hours of incubation with 4 U/ml adenosine deaminase and ligand, induction of 5-gaiactosidase was measured using CPRG as the substrate for 3-galactcside . 5 x 10 cells were used per assay.<br>
The results obtained with NECA stimulation indicated that at<br>
_ p a  NECA  concentration  of  10   M  approximately  2-fold<br>
stimulation of 3-galactosidase activity was achieved. Moreover, a stimulation index of approximately 10-fold was observed at a NECA concentration of 10~ M.<br>
The utility of this assay was extended by validation of the activity of antagonists on this strain. Two known adenosine antagonist, XAC and DPCPX, were tested for their ability to compete against NECA (at 5 mM) for activity in the (J-galactosidase assay. In these assays, (3-galactosidase induction was measured using FDG as the substrate and 1.6 x 10" cells per assay. The results indicated that both XAC and DPCPX served as potent antagonists of yeast-expressed A-. adenosine receptor, with IC50 values of 44 nM and 49 nM, respectively.<br>
In order to determine if this inhibitory effect was specific to the A: subtype, a series of complementary experiments were performed with the yeast-based A2a receptor assay (described in Example 4). Results obtained with the A2a yeast-based assay indicated that XAC was a relatively effective A2a receptor antagonist, consistent with published reports. In contrast, DPCPX was relatively inert at this receptor, as expected from published reports.<br>
IV.  Radioligand Binding<br>
The A: adenosine receptor assay was further characterized by measurement of the receptor's radioligand binding parameters. Displacement binding of [ H]CPX by several adenosine receptor<br>
reference compounds, XAC, DPCPX, and CGS, was analyzed usir.c membranes prepared from yeast expressing the human A: adenosine receptor. The results with yeast membrar.es expressing the human Aj adenosine receptor were compared to those from yeast membranes expressing the human A2a adenosine receptor or the human A3 receptor to examine the specificity of binding. To perform the assay, fifty mg of membranes were incubated with 0.4 nM [~H]C?X and increasing concentrations of adenosine receptor ligands. Incubation was in 50 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.25 V BSA and 2 U/ml adenosine deaminase in the presence of protease inhibitors for 60 minutes at room temperature. Binding was terminated by addition of ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 plus 10 mM MgCl2, followed by rapid filtration over GF/B filters previously soaked with 0.5 V polyethyenimine, using a Packard 96-well harvester. Data were analyzed by nonlinear least square curve fitting procedure using Prism 2.01 software. The IC5o values obtained in this experiment are summarized in Table 4, below: (Table Remove)<br>
 These data indicate that the reference compounds have affinities consistent with those reported in the literature. The data further indicate that the yeast-based assays are of sufficient sensitivity to discriminate receptor subtype specificity.<br>
Functional Assay using Yeast Strains Expressing Human Ala<br>
Adenosine Receptor<br>
In this example, the development of a functional screening assay in yeast for modulators of the human A: adenosine receptor is described.<br>
I.	Ligande Used in Assay<br>
The natural ligand adenosine, as well as other thoroughly characterized and commercially available ligands were used for study of the human A2a receptor functionally expressed in yeast. Three ligands have been used in the establishment of this assay. They include.-<br>
T.lgand	Reported £1	Function<br>
Adenosine	500 nM	agonist<br>
5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine	10-15 nM	agonist<br>
(NECA) (-)-N6-(2-<br>
phenylisopropyl)-adenosine	100-125 nM	agonist<br>
(PIA)<br>
To prevent signaling due to the presence of adenosine in the growth media, adenosine deaminase (4U/ml) was added to all assays.'<br>
II.	Biological Response in Yeast<br>
A2a receptor agonists were tested for the capacity to stimulate the pheromone response pathway in yeast transformed with the A2a receptor expression plasmid and expressing either GQSE10K, GQSD229S or GQSE10K*D229S. The ability of ligand to stimulate the pheromone response pathway in a receptor dependent manner was indicated by an alteration in the yeast phenotype. Receptor activation modified the phenotype from histidine auxotrophy to histidine prototrophy (activation of fusl-HIS3). Three independent transformants were isolated and grown overnight in the presence of histidine. Cells were washed to remove histidine and diluted to 2 x 10° cells/ml. 5 m! of each transformant was spotted onto nonselective media (including histidine) or selective<br>
media (1 mM AT) in the absence or presence cf 4 adenosine deaminase. Plates were grown at 30 :C hours. In the presence of histidine both Receptor" (R~) and Receptor" (R~) strains were capable of growth. However, in the absence of histidine only R* cells grew. Since no ligand had been added to these plates two explanations were possible for this result. One possible interpretation was that the receptor bearing yeast were at a growth advantage due to Ligand Independent Receptor Mediated Activation (LIRMA). Alternatively the yeast could have been synthesizing the ligand adenosine. To distinguish between these two possibilities, an enzyme which degrades the ligand, adenosine deaminase (ADA), was added to the growing yeast and plates. In the presence of adenosine deaminase R* cells no longer grew in the absence of histicine, indicating that the yeast were indeed synthesizing ligand.<br>
This interpretation was confirmed by an A2a growth assay in liquid. In this experiment R* yeast (a GQSE10K strain expressing the A2a receptor) were inoculated at three densities (1 x 10° cell/ml; 3 x 105 cells/ml; or 1 x 105 cells/ml) in the presence or absence of adenosine deaminase (4 U/mll. The stringency of the assay was enhanced with increasing concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.2 or 0.4 mM)of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (AT), a competitive antagonist of imidazoleglycerol-P dehydratase, the protein product of the KIS3 gene. In the presence of adenosine deaminase and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole yeast grew less vigorously. However in the absence of 3-amino-1,2,4 -triazole, adenosine deaminase had little effect. Thus adenosine deaminase itself had no direct effect upon the pheromone response pathway.<br>
An alternative approach to measuring growth and one that can be miniaturized for high throughput screening is an A2a receptor ligand spot assay. A GasE10K strain expressing the A2a receptor (A2aRt-) or lacking the receptor (R-) was grown overnight in the presence of histidine and 4 U/ml adenosine deaminase. Cells were washed to remove histidine and diluted<br>
to 5 x 10 cells/ml. 1 x 10 cells were spread or.tr selective plates containing 4 U/ml adenosine deaminase and 0.5 or 1.0 mM 3-amino-l,2,4-triazole (AT) and allowed to dry for 1 hour. 5 m! of the following reagents were applied to the monolayer: 10 mM adenosine, 38.7 mM histidine, dimethylsulfcxide (DMSO) , 10 mM PIA or 10 mM NECA. Cells were grown 24 hours at 30°C. The results showed that cells without receptor could only grow when histidine was added to the media. In contrast, R* cells only grew in areas where the A2a receptor ligands PIA and NECA had been spotted. Since the plates contained adenosine deaminase, the lack of growth where adenosine had been spotted confirmed that adenosine deaminase was active.<br>
III.  fusl LacZ Assay<br>
To guantitate activation of the yeast mating pathway, synthesis of 0-galactosidase through fuslLacZ was measured.<br>
Yeast strains expressing G3JE10K, G,,SD229S or G.,SE10K*D229S were transformed with a plasmid encoding the human A2a receptor (Rt-) or with a plasmid lacking the receptor (R-). Transformants were isolated and grown overnight in the presence of histidine and 4 U/ml adenosine deaminase. 1 x 10 cells were diluted to 1 x 10 cells/ml and exposed to increasing concentrations of NECA for 4 hours, followed by determination of the S-galactosidase activity in the cells. The results demonstrated that essentially no 3-galactosidase activity was detected in R- strains, whereas increasing amounts of 0-galactosidase activity were detected in Re­strains expressing either G3,E10K, G.,5D229S or GaJE10K+D229S as the concentration of NECA increased, indicating a dose dependent increase in units of B-galactosidase detected in response to exposure to increased ligand concentration. This dose dependency was only observed in cells expressing the A2a receptor. Furthermore the most potent G01 construct for the A2a receptor was GOSE10K. The G0,D229S construct was the second-most potent GOJ construct for the A2a receptor, while the G.,,E10KTD229S construct was the least potent of the three<br>
G3S constructs tested. although even the G,.E10K-z;Zr = construct stimulated readily detectable amounts cf (3-galactosidase activity.<br>

Results<br>
A primary function of certain cell' surface receptors is to recognize appropriate ligands. Accordingly, we determined ligand binding affinities to establish the functional integrity of the Adenosine 1 receptor subtype expressed in yeast. Crude membranes prepared from Saccharomyces<br>
cerevisiae transformed with human Adenosine l receptor<br>
subtype construct exhibited specific saturable binding of [ H] DPCFX with a KD of 4.0 ± 0.19 nM. The KD and Bmax value were calculated from the saturation isotherm and Scatchard transformation of the data indicated a single class of binding sites. The densities of adenosine binding sites in the yeast membrane preparations were estimated to 716.8 * 43.4 fmol/mg membrane protein.<br>
The pharmacological subtype characteristics of the recombinant yeast cells transformed with human Aa receptor subtype - were investigated with subtype selective adenosine ligands (XAC, DPCPX; CGS-15943; Compound 600; Compound 1002; NECA, (R)-PIA,- IB-MECA and Alloxazine) that competed with [ H] DPCPX in the expected rank order. Displacement curves recorded with these compounds show the typical steepness with all the ligands, and the data for each of the ligands could be modeled by a one-site fit. The apparent dissociation constants estimated for the individual compound from the curves (Table 5) are consistent with value published for the receotor obtained from other sources.<br>
