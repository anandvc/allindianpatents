				<td>This invention relates to improvements in Fnedel-Crafts process and in particular to Friedel-Crafts acylation process and to a process for vapour phase alkylation of aniline using solid acid catalyst<br>
This application has been divided out of Patent Application No 3594/DEL/97 dated December 12 1997<br>
The most common method of introducing an alkyl or acyl group in to an organic compound is via the Fnedel-Crafts reaction by using either aluminium chloride in nitrobenzene or boron tnflunde in liquid HF Recently M Masahiro et al have reported the Fnedel-Crafts acylation reaction using the forgoing catalysts on these and various other Lewis acids such as FeCI3 ZnCI2 SnCI2 TiCI4 lnCI4 and SbCI5 and Bronstead acids such as H2SO4 and HCI These Fnedel-Crafts acylation methods suffer from numerous drawbacks including unpredictable regioselectivity the extremely hazardous solvent system and requirements of large amounts of the acid The homogeneous catalysed Fnedel-Crafts acylations require at least 2 moles of a Lewis acid to generate 1 mole of the product posing an enormous catalyst disposal problem<br>
Investigation &amp; study on industrially importance Fnedel-Crafts reaction involving acylation of benzene with 4-chlorobenzoyl chloride to give 4-chlorobenzophenone an important intermediate in the formation of cytrazin - a well known pharmaceutical drug related that in use of various known acidic heterogeneous catalysts so that the problem of disposal of waste catalyst after completion of the Fnedel-Crafts reactions could be avoided Since the solid catalysts could be separated and reused thereby making the process clean and more economic However in use of such known heterogeneous catalysts for acylation of benzene with 4-chlorobenzoyl chloride it was found that most of these catalysts were not at all active for this reaction<br>
Use of sulphated zirconia has been reported in such reactions but it could not give yields better than those obtained with classical aluminium chloride<br>
Aniline is known to be used as a building block for the manufacture of several products useful to the chemical industry Aniline and its alkylated products are highly useful in fine chemical industry especially for the preparation of pharmaceuticals drugs pesticides plastics additives and dyes Conventionally Fnedel-Crafts alkylation reactions are carried out with homogeneous acid catalysts used in the stoichiometric quantities or in excess The economics associated in the separation processes and the   present day s<br>
stringent environmental concerns on the disposal of spent homogeneous catalysts make it difficult to proceed with them anymore Heterogeneous acid catalysts have been employed in the synthesis of fert-butyl aromatic amines They are usually prepared by reacting aniline over the acid catalysts with pure isobutylene or C4 fraction from naphtha crackers which contains isobutylene under pressures ranging from 300-950 psig (BurgoyneWF and Dixon D D Applied Catalysis 63 (1990) 117 BurgoyneWF and Dixon DD Eur Pat 336 134 (Oct 1989) CA 113(1990) 171653w Frederick Harold H EUR Pat 69 065, (Jan 1983) C 4, 99 (1983) 38176u Lobanova N S and Popov MA Zh Prinkl Khim (Lenmgrade), 43(4) (1970) 938 (Russ) CA 73(1970) 25032g ) Reactions were performed by either co-feeding the arylamme and alkene over the solid catalyst in a fixed - bed reactor or by reacting the reagents and catalyst in a stirred autoclave<br>
There are not many reported studies on the use of alcohols other than methanol and ethanol for the alkylation of aniline using heterogeneous acid catalysts The studies on higher alkylation of aniline over heterogeneous solid acid catalysts have been restricted to the use of alkenes rather than alcohols as the alkylating agent Table A gives the different catalyst used in the alkylation of aniline with isobutylene In the presence of acid catalyst tert-butanol cracks into isobutylene and water Isobutylene thus produced reacts in situ with aniline giving different mono-alkylated products like n-fert-butylanihne 2-tert-butylanihne 4-terf-butylaniline and dialkylated products<br>

TBA = tert- butyl aniline , DTBA = Di-ferf-butyl aniline<br>
Bernard Herstein (US Pat 2, 092, 973, (Sep 14, 1937), CA, 31 (1937) 789345) prepared 4-terf-butylaniline by reacting acetanilide with tert-butyl chloride in the presence of anhydrous AICI3 and the resulting 4-tert-butyl acetanilide is separated from the reaction mixture and is deacetylated Alternatively it was also prepared by hydrogenation of the 4-nitro-tert-butyl benzene at atmospheric pressure at 20 °C over<br>

(Table Removed) <br>
It will be seen that none of these catalysts of examples 2-8 were active for this reaction The catalyst of example 9 did not give yields better than that of AICI3 while example 10, using UDCaT-1 gave yield higher than the of AICI3 even though conversion was poor That shows less wastage<br>
It will be seen that the acylation reaction is very efficently carried out with UDCaT-1 catalyst Product were identified by IR spectra 1H NMR Melting point and purity also checked by HPLC method<br>
The repeated runs were carried out by decanting the original contents of the reactor and later adding fresh reactants into the reactor Care was taken that there was no loss of catalysts while the repeat experiments were carried out using the same used catalysts<br>

through it for 3h The ammoniated sample was washed with distilled water to remove the chloride ions and dried in oven at 120°C for 2h The sulfation was done by passing 1N sufuric acid (15 ml/g) through the filter paper containing the dried ammoniated solid material It was dried in oven forlh at 120°C and calcined at 550°C for 3h to give the active catalyst UDCaT-1<br>
Reaction Procedure<br>
The tert-butylation of aniline was carried out in a vapour phase fixed bed catalytic reactor at atmospheric pressure 1 0 g of catalyst sample was placed in a tubular down flow glass reactor (40 cm x 1 5 cm) and the catalyst section was packed between two sections of glass wool The reactants mixed in a proper ratio were fed from the top by using a calibrated motonsed syringe pump Glass beads loaded at the top of the catalyst bed were used as pre-heating zone Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas and the flow rate was controlled by a rotameter at a range of 15 ml/mm and 30 ml/mm It was calibrated carefully with a soap film meter in every run Examples 35-39 were carried out using different catalyst at feed rates and temperature region as given below in the Table 2 The liquid products were obtained by circulating cold water through the condenser Aniline was separated by distillation and the product 4-ferf-butylanihne was obtained<br>
In example 39 a run of 3 hrs gave 10 g of aniline and 4-tert-butylaniline mixture On distillation it   gave 2 5 g of 4-fe/t-butylanihne<br>
Analysis of Reaction Mixture<br>
The products were analysed by gas chromatography (Model Chemito 8510) using 4 m x 3 mm i d stainless steel column packed either with 5 % SE -30 or OV - 17 on chromosorb WHP, coupled with a flame lonisation detector Synthetic mixtures of reactants and products were used to calibrate the G C results for quantification A typical mass spectral fragmentation pattern of alkylated product proves that the product obtained is mono alkylated product The 1H NMR (500 MHz) spectra shows that the product formed is 4-terf-butyl aniline<br>
The mass spectral fragmentation pattern of aniline alkylation reaction mixture confirming the mono alkylation The separated product was then further analysed by 1H NMR for its mono alkylation 1H NMR (500 MHz) using CDCI3 δ 7 25 (d J= 8 514 Hz, 2H), δ 6 7 (d, J=8 483, 2H), δ 3 78 (s, 2H), δ 1 35 (s, 9H) spectra shows that the product formed is 4-terf-butyl aniline Thus N- alkylation was totally absent using UDCaT-1 whereas it was a major product in the case of DTP/ K-10 as a catalyst as reported elsewhere (Doshi NS, PhD Thesis, University of Mumbai 1998) The reaction results are summarised in Table 2<br>
Results<br>
Table 10 gives the % conversion of aniline and selectivity to 4-terf-butyl aniline with different types of catalysts As from Table 5 UDCaT-1 is giving better conversion of aniline and selectivity forming 4 - tert - butyl aniline<br>
Table 5 Alkylation of aniline with tert-butanol<br><br>
(Table Removed) <br>
Reaction Conditions =Anilline and  tert-butanol were taken in 1    4 mole ratio, Catalyst loading = 1 g , Reaction temperature = 250 °C Reactant feed rate = 65 ml/ h a   Nitrogen flow rate = 30 ml/ mm b   Nitrogen flow rate = 15 ml/ mm c 4-tert- butylaniline Examples 4 and 5 show high conversion and high selectivity<br>
In continuous processes the isobutylene vapours can be recirculated and yields should be high.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
