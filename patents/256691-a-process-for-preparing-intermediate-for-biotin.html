Into the solution were added 1.27 g of the compound obtained in Reference Example 5-(l), 2 ml of N,N-dimethylacetamide and 1.1 g of potassium carbonate, and the mixture was reacted at 23°C to 30°C for 93 hours. Then, ethyl acetate and 10% aqueous citric acid were added to the mixture, and the aqueous layer was separated. The organic layer was washed with water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and then concentrated to give 2.29 g of the residue. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (solvent: n-hexane:ethyl acetate=5:l) to give 1.67 g of ethyl (4R)-2-oxo-3-benzylthiazolidin-4-carboxylate as colorless oily product. MS -APCI (m/z): 266 [ (M+H) f] [α]D24: -96.6° (C=1.0, chloroform) Optical purity (HPLC): 98.1% ee (HPLC conditions)<br>
Column: Chiral cell OD (4.6x250 mm)[manufactured by Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd.], mobile layer: ethanol/ hexane=5/95, flow rate: 0.8 ml/min, UV detection: 225 nm, column temperature: 40°C. Reference Example 6<br>
In 227 ml of ethanol was dissolved 28.4 g of ethyl (4R)-2-oxo~3~benzylthiazolidin-4-carboxylate, 2.26 g of sodium borohydride was added to the solution, and the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 15 hours. Moreover, 0.76 g of sodium borohydride was additionally added to the mixture, and the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours.  To the mixture was added cone, hydrochloric acid to neutralize the mixture to be a pH of 6 to 7, and the solution was concentrated. The concentrated residue was dissolved<br><br>
in ethyl acetate, washed three times with water, and the aqueous layer was reverse extracted once with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate layers were combined, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and then, concentrated to give 22.6 g of an oily residue.  Isopropyl ether was added to the residue to crystallize the compound, and further the crystal was collected by filtration, washed with isopropyl ether, and dried under reduced pressure to give 18.4 g of (4R)-3-benzyl-4-hydroxymethylthiazolidin-2-one as colorless crystal. Physical properties of this product accorded to those of Reference Example l-(3). Reference Example 7<br>
(1)	In 200 ml of acetonitrile was dissolved 10 g of<br>
(4R)-2-oxo-3-benzylthiazolidin-4-carboxylic acid, and 9.2<br>
g of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide was added to the solution under room temperature. Subsequently, to the solution were added 3,3 ml of ethanethiol, and 670 mg of 4-di-methylaminopyridine in this order under ice-cooling, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. Insoluble material was filtered off, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (solvent: n-hexanerethyl acetate=10:1) to give 10.8 g of (4S)-4-ethyl-thiocarbonyl--3-benzylthiazolidin-2-one as oily product. MS -APCI (m/z) : 282 [ (M+H) f] [a]D25: -110.8° (C=1.04, chloroform).<br>
(2)	In 5.0 ml of dichloromethane was dissolved 0.5 g<br>
of the compound obtained in Reference Example 7-(l), and<br>
284 mg of palladium hydroxide was added to the solution<br>
under nitrogen atmosphere. At room temperature, 0.85 ml<br>
of trimethylsilane was added to the mixture, and the<br>
resulting mixture was stirred at the same temperature for<br>
3 hours.  Insoluble material was filtered off, and the<br>
fitrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to give<br>
0.5 g of (4R)-2-oxo-3-benzylthiazolidin-4-carbaldehyde as<br>
oily product.  Physical properties of this product<br><br>
accorded to those of Reference Example l-(4). Reference Example 8<br>
35.34 g of the compound obtained in Example 5, 121 ml of mesitylene and 116.1 g of methanesulfonic acid were heated at an inner temperature of 130°C. By setting a reaction starting time when the mixture reached to 125°C, the mixture was stirred at 128°C to 133°C for 4 hours, disappearance of monobenzylbiotin was confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography. The reaction mixture was cooled to 80°C, 30 ml of acetic acid was added thereto, and methanesulfonic acid layer was added dropwise to 710 ml of purified water. The mesitylene layer was separated, ice-cooled for 1 hour, and then, crude crystal was collected by filtration, and washed with 200 ml of water, and then, with methanol until black color of the washed solution disappeared. The crystal was dried at 50°C by blowing air overnight to give 15.89 g of crude (+)-biotin.<br>
The obtained crude (+)-biotin was dissolved in an aqueous solution comprising 160 ml of purified water containing 2.73 g of sodium hydroxide, and a pH of the solution was adjusted to 7 by using dil. hydrochloric acid at 90°C to 95°C. At 90°C to 95°C, 4 g of carbon powder was added into the system, and after stirring the mixture for 10 minutes, carbon powder precoate filtration was carried out.  The filtrate was heated to 90°C to 95°C again, and 4 g of powder was again added to the system, and after the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes, the carbon coate precoat was filtered off. The filtrate was heated to 80°C to 85°C again, and a pH of the mixture was adjusted to 1.8 to 2.2 with conc, hydrochloric acid, and neutralization crystallization were carried out. The mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 1 hour to grow crystal. The mixture was gradually cooled, ice-cooled and then the crystal was collected by filtration. The crystal was dried by blowing air at 50°C overnight to give 13.86 g of (+)-biotin as colorless crystal.<br><br>
