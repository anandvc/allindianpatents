				<td>2-BUTYL-3-(4-[3-(DIBUTYLAMINO)PROPOXY]BENZOYL)-5-NITROBENZOFURAN HYDROCHLORIDE AND PREPARATION THEREOF<br>
The present invention relates, generally, to an aminoalkoxybenzoyl derivative in the salt form, to its process of preparation and to its use as synthetic intermediate.<br>
More specifically, a subject matter of the invention is the 2-butyl-3-(4-[3-(dibutylamino)-propoxy]benzoyl)-5-nitrobenzofuran hydrochloride of formula:<br>
(FormulaRemoved) <br><br>
hereinafter referred to as "Compound A hydrochloride".<br>
This compound has proved to be particularly useful as intermediate for the preparation of 2-butyl-3-(4-[3-(dibutylamino)propoxy]benzoyl)-5-nitrobenzofuran, hereinafter referred to as "Compound A" .<br>
The latter can itself be widely used as<br>
intermediate in the preparation of various products, in particular for the final synthesis of (aminoalkoxybenzoyl)benzofuran derivatives, in particular of 2-butyl-3-(4-[3-<br>
(dibutylamino)propoxy]benzoyl)-5-(methanesulfonamido)benzofuran, commonly called dronedarone, and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
This (methanesulfonamido)benzofuran<br>
derivative and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts have been disclosed in patent EP 0471609, as well as its therapeutic applications. This compound has been shown to be particularly advantageous in the cardiovascular field, in particular as antiarrhythmic agent.<br>
The abovementidned patent EP 0471609 has also reported a process for the preparation of 3-[4-(aminoalkoxy)benzoyl]benzofuran or -benzo[b]thiophene derivatives by attachment of an aminoalkoxybenzoyl chain to a benzofuran or benzo[b]thiophene derivative, according to which process a benzoyl group comprising, in the para position, an oxygen protected by a methyl group is first added to the benzofuran or benzo[b]thiophene derivative in question, deprotection is carried out to regenerate the hydroxyl functional group and, finally, the desired aminoalkyl chain is introduced.<br>
More specifically, this process, applied to the preparation of Compound A, comprises the sequence of stages below:<br>
a) reaction of 2-butyl-5-nitrobenzofuran with anisoyl chloride in the presence of tin tetrachloride<br>
according to the conditions of the Friedel-Crafts reaction and hydrolysis to form 2-butyl-3-(4-methoxybenzoyl)-5-nitrobenzofuran,<br>
b)	demethylation of the compound thus<br>
5  obtained in the presence of 2.25 molar equivalents of aluminum chloride and hydrolysis to form 2-butyl-3-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)-5-nitrobenzofuran,<br>
c)	condensation of the compound thus<br>
obtained with l-chloro-3-(dibutylamino)propane in the<br>
10  presence of potassium carbonate to give the desired Compound A.<br>
However, this process is not without<br>
exhibiting certain disadvantages due in particular to the use of aluminum chloride. This is because the use 15  of this process on the industrial scale results in<br>
large discharges of aluminum hydroxide, the treatment of which, for the purpose of preventing problems of pollution, proves to be expensive. In addition, the use of 2-butyl-3-(4-methoxybenzoyl)-5-nitrobenzofuran 20  should be avoided because of its mutagenic properties.<br>
Finally, the desired compound is produced, according to this three-stage process, with a maximum yield of only 60% from 2-butyl-5-nitrobenzofuran.<br>
The search for an industrial process for the 25  preparation of Compound A employing a minimum number of synthetic stages from 2-butyl-5-nitrobenzofuran while<br>
avoiding the use of aluminum chloride consequently remains of unquestionable interest.<br>
J. Med. Chem., 1984, 27, 1057-1066, has reported a more convergent method for attaching an aminoalkoxybenzoyl chain to a benzo[b]thiophene derivative without passing through a stage of protection of the hydroxyl functional group. However, this process still provides, on page 1064, for the use of aluminum chloride in particularly high amounts since they are of the order of 9 molar equivalents.<br>
According to this method, the<br>
benzo[b]thiophene derivative in question is condensed, in an organic phase composed of dichloroethane, with the hydrochloride of the chloride of the aminoalkoxybenzoyl derivative, this taking place in the presence of aluminum chloride. After hydrolysis, the hydrochloride of the desired 3-[4-<br>
(aminoalkoxy)benzoyl]benzo[b]thiophene derivative is recovered, partly from the organic phase and partly from the aqueous phase by three extractions with chloroform, and then treated with sodium hydroxide. In the context of the development of the present invention, this process was applied to the preparation of Compound A by employing the following stages:<br>
treatment of 2-butyl-5-nitrobenzofuran by means of 4-[3-(dibutylamino)propoxy]benzoyl chloridehydrochloride in the presence of 9 molar equivalents of aluminum chloride, this taking place in an organic phase,<br>
• hydrolysis, recovery of Compound A hydrochloride and treatment with sodium hydroxide to form the desired Compound A.<br>
However, this process proved to be unsuitable at the industrial level because, first, of the huge amount of aluminum hydroxide thus produced and, secondly, of the high level of impurities collected and, consequently, of the low yield of the desired Compound A provided (20 to 30%).<br>
In point of fact, surprisingly, it has been found that it is possible, starting from 2-butyl-5-nitrobenzofuran and using appropriate amounts of a Lewis acid in a Friedel-Crafts reaction, to obtain Compound A hydrochloride with a high yield, since it is greater than 90%, it being possible for this hydrochloride to be recovered in a notably advantageous way since it is virtually all found not in the aqueous phase, as might have been anticipated, but in the organic phase used, which avoids the necessity to carry out several extractions of the same aqueous phase as in the prior process.<br>
In addition, this hydrochloride can be employed with great ease in the preparation of Compound<br><br>
A, which can be produced, according to the invention, with yields of greater than 95%.<br>
According to the invention, Compound A hydrochloride is prepared by reacting, in an organic phase, 2-butyl-5-nitrobenzofuran with 4-[3-(dibutylamino)propoxy]benzoyl chloride hydrochloride, this taking place in the presence of a Lewis acid as catalyst, and by hydrolyzing to form the desired compound, which is recovered in the organic phase.<br>
The reaction, carried out according to the conditions of the Friedel-Crafts reaction, is usually carried out at ambient temperature and in an organic phase composed of one or more solvents chosen from halogenated or nonhalogenated hydrocarbons, preferably of aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic type. Use is generally made of halogenated hydrocarbons, preferably chlorinated hydrocarbons, of aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic type, such as, for example, dichloromethane, dichloroethane or chlorobenzene.<br>
In addition, the Lewis acid can be aluminum chloride, zinc chloride, boron trifluoride, stannic chloride, titanium tetrachloride or, preferably, ferric chloride. A mixture of these may be used. This Lewis acid is used in amounts not exceeding 3 molar equivalents, in particular in a proportion of 2 to 3 molar equivalents, preferably 2.5 molar equivalents.<br>
- Finally, 4-[3-(dibutylamino)propoxy]benzoyl chloride hydrochloride is employed in a slight quantitative excess, such as, for example, in amounts of the order of 1 to 1.3 molar equivalents.<br>
This chloride hydrochloride is a novel<br>
product, in the same way as other compounds involved in the preparation of Compound A hydrochloride.<br>
However, patent EP 0471609 mentions, in its example 28, the individual case of the compound l-chloro-4- (3-(di(n-butyl)amino)propoxy)benzoyl hydrochloride for its use in the synthesis of 2-(n-butyl)-3-[4-(3-(di(n-butyl)amino)propoxy)benzoyl]-7-carbethoxyindolizine hydrogen oxalate.<br>
Consequently, another subject matter of the invention relates to the benzoyl derivatives of general formula:<br>
(FormulaRemoved)<br>
and to their hydrochloride, in which R represents chlorine or an -OR1 group in which R1represents hydrogen or a C1-C4 alkyl group, with the exception of l-chloro-4-(3-(di(n-butyl)amino)propoxy)benzoyl hydrochloride, as novel industrial products of use in particular as synthetic intermediates, for example for the preparation of Compound A hydrochloride.<br>
Mention may be made, by way of example, of:<br>
•	4-[3-(dibutylamino)propoxy]benzole acid<br>
hydrochloride,<br>
•	4-[3-(dibutylamino)propoxy]benzoyl chloride<br>
hydrochloride,<br>
•	methyl 4-[3-(dibutylamino)propoxy]benzoate.<br>
The invention also relates to the process for the preparation of the compounds of formula (2) above.<br>
4-[3-(Dibutylamino)propoxy]benzoyl chloride hydrochloride and the other compounds of formula (2) can be prepared according to the sequence of stages below:<br>
a) 1-dibutylamino-3-chloropropane is reacted with a C1-C4  alkyl p-hydroxybenzoate, for example methyl p-hydroxybenzoate, this taking place in the presence of a basic agent, such as an alkali metal carbonate, for example potassium carbonate, to produce a C1-C4 alkyl 4-[3-(dibutylamino)propoxy]benzoate of formula (2), for example methyl 4-[3-(dibutylamino)propoxy]benzoate, b) the ester thus obtained is saponified in the presence of an alkali metal hydroxide, for example sodium hydroxide, and then the salt thus formed is treated using hydrochloric acid to give 4-[3-<br>
(dibutylamino)propoxy]benzole acid hydrochloride,<br>
c) the hydrochloride thus formed is then treated using a chlorinating agent, for example thionyl chloride, to produce the desired compound.<br>
As mentioned above, Compound A hydrochloride can give access to Compound A.<br>
Consequently, another subject matter of the invention relates to the preparation of Compound A by treatment of its hydrochloride using a basic agent, such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example sodium hydroxide, an alkali metal carbonate or an alkali metal hydrogencarbonate, to produce the desired compound. Use is preferably made of an alkali metal hydrogencarbonate, such as sodium hydrogencarbonate.<br>
According to a preferred use of the<br>
invention, Compound A is prepared without isolation of its hydrochloride formed as an intermediate, that is to say in the same medium in which this hydrochloride is prepared.<br>
Consequently, according to an alternative form of the invention, Compound A is prepared by a process according to which, in an organic phase composed of one or more solvents chosen from halogenated or nonhalogenated hydrocarbons, 2-butyl-5-nitrobenzofuran is reacted with 4-[3-(dibutylamino)-propoxy]benzoylchloride hydrochloride, this taking place in the presence of a maximum of 3 molar equivalents of a Lewis acid as catalyst, and the mixture is hydrolyzed to produce Compound A hydrochloride as an intermediate and without isolation, which product is recovered in the organic phase and is treated using a basic agent, providing the desired Compound A.<br>
This method is particularly advantageous since it makes it possible to obtain Compound A directly from 2-butyl-5-nitrobenzofuran without any isolation of synthetic intermediate and with high yields, since they are of the order of 97% from the starting nitro derivative.<br>
As indicated above, Compound A hydrochloride can be used in the preparation of dronedarone and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
Consequently, the invention also relates to Compound A hydrochloride as intermediate in the final synthesis of dronedarone and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
For example, this compound and its salts can be prepared starting from Compound A, itself obtained according to the invention from its hydrochloride, by employing a process comprising the sequence of stages below:<br>
a) in an organic phase, composed of one or more solvents chosen from halogenated or nonhalogenated hydrocarbons, 2-butyl-5-nitrobenzofuran is reacted with 4-[3-(dibutylamino)propoxy]benzoyl chloride hydrochloride, this taking place in the presence of a maximum of 3 molar equivalents of a Lewis acid as catalyst, the mixture is hydrolyzed to produce Compound A hydrochloride as an intermediate and without isolation, which product is recovered in the organic phase and is treated using a basic agent to form Compound A,<br>
b)	the Compound A obtained is hydrogenated in<br>
the presence of an appropriate catalyst, such<br>
as platinum oxide, which gives 5-amino-2-<br>
butyl-3-(4-[3-(dibutylamino)propoxy]-<br>
benzoylbenzofuran,<br>
c)	the 5-aminobenzofuran derivative thus<br>
obtained is reacted with methanesulfonyl<br>
chloride or methanesulfonic anhydride, the<br>
reaction taking place in the presence of an<br>
acid acceptor, such as triethylamine, which<br>
gives dronedarone, which is reacted, if<br>
desired, with an organic or inorganic acid to<br>
form a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of<br>
this compound.<br>
The above stages (c) and (d) are known stages which have been disclosed in the abovementioned patent EP 0471609.<br>
