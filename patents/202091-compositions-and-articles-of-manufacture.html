Compositions and Articles of Manufacture Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a composition comprising a filler material, a chemical compound and a polymer. A preferred filler material comprises carbon black and preferred polymers include ethylene-containing polymers such as ethylene-propylene copolymer or ethylene-propylene terpolymers. The present invention also relates to articles of manufacture incorporating the compositions.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Polymer compositions are utilized in a variety of applications, including so-called "industrial rubber applications". Industrial rubber applications include hoses, belts, electrical cable insulation, automotive and industrial weatherstripping, profiles, molded parts and the like. Many articles for industrial rubber applications are produced through extrusion techniques, i.e. the polymer composition is extruded through a die then cooled or chemically hardened.<br>
Fillers are often utilized in polymer compositions to impart desirable characteristics such as reinforcement, pigmentation and/or conductivity to the polymer compositions. Carbon blacks have been widely utilized as fillers and reinforcing pigments in the compounding and preparation of polymer compositions. Carbon blacks are generally characterized on the basis of one or more of their properties including, but not limited to, their surface areas, surface chemistry, aggregate sizes, and particle sizes. The properties of carbon blacks are analytically determined by tests known to the art, including iodine number (I2N0.) and dibutyl phthalate adsorption (DBP).<br>
The dispersion properties (dispersibility) of a filler are relevant to the use of fillers in polymer compositions. It is generally advantageous to have fillers which are easily dispersible in polymer compositions.<br>
Many types of polymer compositions are cured using an UHF microwave curing process. UHF microwave curing is becoming increasingly important due to its high curing efficiency and other desirable attributes. As understood in the art, UHF microwave curing refers to a curing process utilizing ultra high frequency microwaves (from about 300 to 3000 megahertz (megacycles per second or "MHz")). Polymer compositions that are more receptive to UHF microwave curing have a faster heating rate and thus are advantageous for processing the material.<br>
Generally, polymer compositions incorporating high surface area carbon blacks are more receptive to UHF microwave curing. However, high surface area carbon blacks are often difficult to disperse in polymer compositions. It would be advantageous to have a carbon black composition which is easily dispersible in polymer compositions and/or which imparts increased UHF receptivity to the polymer composition.<br><br>

The effectiveness and advantages of various aspects and embodiments of the present invention will be further illustrated by the following examples wherein the following testing procedures were utilized.<br>
The following testing procedures were utilized in the determination and evaluation of the analytical properties of the carbon blacks utilized in the following examples. The DBP (dibutyl phthalate adsorption value) of the carbon blacks utilized in the examples, expressed as cubic centimeters DBP per 100 grams carbon black (cc/lOOg), was determined according to the procedure set forth in ASTM D2414. The Iodine number (I2N0.) of the carbon blacks utilized in the examples, expressed as<br>
milligrams per gram (mg/g), was determined according to ASTM test procedure D1510.<br>
The polymer compositions, described in the following examples were evaluated for heating rate and heating time to reach 180" C, utilizing the following test procedures. A 6 mm (millimeter) in diameter by 40 mm long test piece of the polymer composition was exposed to a 60 Watt microwave source. Temperature change in the test piece under exposure was measured utilizing a temperature probe, and exposure time was measured utilizing a stopwatch.  The exposure time for the test piece to reach 180* C was measured and the heating rate in 'C per second was calculated from the exposure time.<br>
As utilized in the description of the chemical compounds utilized in the Examples, HLB value refers to hydrophile-lipophile balance value which may be determined by the method described in Non-Ionic Surfactants Volume 23. edited by Martin Schick (Marcel Dekker Inc. (New York) 1987; ISBN 0-8247-7530-9), page 440. Non-Ionic Surfactants Volume 23 provides equations which relate the structure of the surfactant molecule to HLB value. HLB value is also discussed in the following journal articles: Griffin W.C, J. Soc. Cosmetic Chemist, Vol. 1, page 311 et seq. (1949) and Vol. 5, page 249 et seq. (1954). From data relating to the weight percentage of ethylene oxide in the molecule, saponification number of the ester linkage and acid value of the "fatty" acid, HLB value may be directly calculated from one of the following equations:<br>
for polyhydric fatty acid esters:<br>
HLB = 20 (1-S/A) where S = saponification number of the ester and A = acid number of the acid; and<br>
for ethoxylated polyhydric alcohols:<br>
HLB = (E + P)/5, where E = weight of percent ethylene oxide and P = weight pigment of polyhydric alcohol.<br>
Example 1<br>
Example 1 illustrates the advantages of the compositions of the present invention with respect to UHF Microwave receptivity.<br>
Fifteen compositions, 1-15, were produced utilizing the basic formulation set<br><br><br>
Kezandol GR is coated calcium oxide (a moisture scavenger) manufactured and sold by Kettlitz, GmbH.<br>
Carbon Black CB-1 is a carbon black having an IjNo. of 43 mg/g d a DBP of 125 cc/lOOg. Composition I is a control composition produced without a chemical compound additive. Composition 2 is also a control composition produced with a chemical compound falling outside the scope of the present invention. Compositions 3-15 are examples of compositions of the present invention.<br>
The chemical compound additive utilized in compositions 2-15 are set forth below in Table 2.<br><br><br>
The composition ingredients set forth in Tables 1 and 2 above were compounded together using a Banbury mixer with the cooling water set at 40* C, the rotor speed 50 rpm and the ram at 1 bar pressure. The mixing cycle was 4 minutes after which the<br><br>
compound was transferee! to a rotating cold two roll mill (cooling water temperature 40* C).<br>
Once a continuous band of compound had been formed on one of the rotating rolls, curing agents MBT (mercaptobenzylthioazole) andTMTD (tetramethylthiuram disulfide), both 75% active, were both added at an amount of 1.07 part by weight based on the above composition. After allowing the curing agents to thoroughly mix for a period of 8 minutes the compound was removed from the mill in the form of a sheet and allowed to cool.<br>
The sheet was cut into small, approximately 50 mm x 50 mm, pieces and fed into a single screw extruder operating with a screw speed of 50 rpm and at heated barrel at 80° C. A die was positioned at the end of the extruder barrel to provide a strand 5mm in diameter. Portions of the extruder strand, 6mm diameter by 40 mm long, were exposed to a 60W microwave source and the rate of temperature change recorded pursuant to the procedures described in detail above. The results are presented in Table 3 below.<br><br>
These results illustrate that the compositions of the present invention 3-15, had faster heating rates in comparison to control compositions 1 and 2. Thus, the compositions of the present invention 3-15 have improved UHF Microwave receptivity in comparison to control compositions 1 and 2.<br>
The compositions described in the above Tables show enhancement in UHF<br><br>
receptivity of the compounds. This allows for faster heating rates which translate to shorter curing cycles. The reduction in cure time can impart significant savings in manufacturing efficiency.<br>

Polymer compositions 18-44 are examples of compositions of the present invention.<br>
The chemical compound additives utilized in compositions 17-44 are set forth i    below in Table 5.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
together using a Banbury mixer with the cooling water set at 40° C, the rotor speed 50rpm and the ram at 1 bar pressure. The mixing cycle was 4 minutes after which the compound was transfered to a rotating cold two roll mill (cooling water temperature 40* C).<br>

The results are presented in Table 6 below.<br><br><br><br>
compositions ol the present invention 18-45 have improved UHF Microwave recepuvity In comparison to control compositions 16 and 17.<br>
The compxjsitions described in the above tables show enhancement in UHF receptivity of the compounds. This allows for faster heating rates which translate to shorter curing cycles. The reduction in cure time can impart significant savings in manufacturing efficiency.<br>
Examples<br>
This example illustrates the production of compositions of the present invention wherein carbon black is pretreated with the chemical compound additive to form a treated filler material which is combined with a polymer to produce a composition of the present invention. This example also further illustrates the advantages of the compositions of the present invention.<br>
Carbon black CB-3, having an IjNo. of 22 mg/g and a DBF of 95 cc/lOOg was combined with two different amounts of chemical compound additive A3 (sorbitan mono-oleate + 20 moles ethylene oxide, HLB 15.0) to produce an A3 treated carbon black composition comprising 0.7%, by weight A3, and to produce an A3 treated carbon black composition comprising 1.5%, by weight A3. The treated carbon black compositions were produced by combining the CB-3 carbon black, the chemical compound additive (A3) and water in a pin pelletizer of the type described in U.S. Patent No. 3,528,785 to produce wet pellets. The wet pellets were dried in a rotating drum dryer until the moisture content of the pellets was below 0.3%, by weight to produce.<br>
A control composition, 46, containing untreated CB-3 carbon black, as a carbon black component, and two compositions of the present invention 47 and 48, containing the treated carbon black were produced utilizing the formulation set forth in Table 7. Composition 47 incorporated the A3 treated carbon black composition comprising 0.7%, by weight A3, as a carbon black component, and Composition 48 incorporated the A3 treated carbon black composition comprising 1.5%, by weight A3, as a carbon black component.<br><br><br>
The composition ingredients set forth in Table 7 above were compounded together using a Banbury mixer with the cooling water set at 40' C, the rotor speed 50 rpm and the ram at 1 bar pressure. The mixing cycle was 4 minutes after which the compound was transfered to a rotating cold two roll mill (cooling Water temperature 40* C).<br>
Once a continuous band of compound had been formed on one of the rotating rolls, curing agents MBT (mercaptobenzylthioazole) and TMTD (tetramethylthiuram disulfide), both 75% active, were both added at an amount of 1.07 part by weight based on the above composition. After allowing the curing agents to thoroughly mix for a period of 8 minutes the compound was removed from the mill in the form of a sheet and allowed to cool.<br>
The sheet was cut into small, approximately 50 mm x 50 mm, pieces and fed into a single screw extruder operating with a screw speed of 50 rpm and at heated barrel at 80* C. A die was positioned at the end of the extruder barrel to provide a strand 5mm in diameter. Portions of the extruder strand, 6mm diameter by 40 mm long, were exposed to a 60W microwave source and the rate of temperature change recorded pursuant to the procedures described in detail above. The results are presented in Table 8 below.<br><br><br>
had faster heating rates in comparison to control composition 46. Thus, the compositions of the present invention 47 and 48 have improved UHF Microwave receptivity in comparison to control compositions 46. Thus, these results illustrate that the advantages of the compositions of the present invention may be achieved when the chemical compound additive is precombined with the carbon black.<br>
