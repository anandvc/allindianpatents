FRITO-LAY NORTH AMERICA, INC., a US<br>
Company of 7701 Legacy Drive, Plano, TX<br>
75024-4099, United States of America<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
METHOD FOR INCREASING ASPARAGINASE ACTIVITY IN A SOLUTION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method, for reducing the amount of asparagine, a precursor of acrylamide, in a food product. More specifically, this invention relates to increasing the stability of the enzyme asparaginase in a solution. Description of Related Art<br>
As discussed in U.S. Patent No. 7.037,540, acrylamide has been found in thermally-processed foods containing asparagine. The level of acrylamide formed in some food products can be reduced by adding the enzyme asparaginase to the food product prior to cooking the food product.<br>
The addition of acrylamide reducing enzymes such as asparaginase to food products on a commercial scale, as opposed to a batch scale, presents several challenges. For example, the enzyme asparaginase must contact free asparagine to facilitate the hydrolysis of asparagine. As the enzyme is typically supplied in a relatively concentrated form, the enzyme is ideally mixed and diluted in a water-based solution prior to contacting the food product with the enzyme solution. For example, contacting the food product with the enzyme solution can comprise forming a dough and admixing an enzyme solution with the dough.<br>
A .known way to quantify the activity of an enzyme is by referring to the enzyme in terms of units. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required as a catalyst to convert one mieromole of substrate in one minute, Thus, knowing the relative concentration of a substrate or compound such as asparagine in a food product, and the amount of food product, one can calculate the units of enzyme, such as asparaginase, required to convert the desired chemical compound, in this case, asparagine, into a different chemical compound.<br><br>
For previously unknown reasons, even when excess doses (meaning more than the mathematically expected amount required to convert all the asparagine in the food product) of the asparaginase enzyme are used in a food product, such as potato mash or corn masa, there oftentimes are still measurable levels of asparagine in the dough. Because it is desired to reduce the level of acrylamide formed when certain foods are thermally processed, it would be desirable to have a system and method of maximizing the effectiveness of an enzyme used to reduce acrylamide pre-cursors in food products made on a commercial scale.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present, invention, in one aspect, is directed, towards a method of making a stable asparaginase solution  from drinking water by removing chlorine from the water. In one aspect, chlorine is removed by ion exchange, reverse osmosis, activated carbon, and/or by air stripping. In one aspect, additives such as .reducing agents and chlorine scavengers are used to treat the drinking water. The treated water, in one aspect, is then admixed with asparaginase to make an asparaginase solution. The above as well as additional features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent in the following written detailed description,<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The novel features believed characteristic of the invention are set forth in the appended claims. The invention itself, however, as well as a preferred mode of use, further objectives and advantages thereof, will, be best understood by reference to the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein;<br>
Figure la is a graphical representation of the residual enzyme activity after various treatments of drinking water; and<br>
Figure lb is a graphical representation of the residual enzyme activity of various salt water mixtures.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention is directed towards providing a water-based solution that enhances asparaginase stability and preserves asparaginase activity. Enhanced asparaginase activity can translate into more, effective acrylamide reduction in food products because asparagine is a pre-cursor of acryiamide. As used herein, the term "enzyme activity" is expressed in units. Each unit of asparaginase can hydrolyze one niicroniole of asparagine in one minute.<br>
In one embodiment, the food product in which it is desired to reduce the level of acryiamide formed upon thermal processing is.formed from a dough. The term "fabricated snack' means a snack food that uses as its starting ingredient something other than the original and unaltered starchy starting material. For example, fabricated snacks include fabricated potato chips that use a dehydrated potato product as a starting material and corn chips that use ntasa flour as its starting material.. It is noted here that the dehydrated potato product can be potato flour, potato flakes, potato granules, or other forms in which dehydrated potatoes exist. When any of these terms are used in this application, it is understood that, all of these variations are included. By way of example only, and without limitation, examples of "fabricated foods" to which an asparaginase solution can be added include tortilla chips, corn chips, potato chips made from potato flakes and/or fresh potato mash, multigrain chips, corn puffs, wheat puffs, rice puffs, crackers, breads (such as rye, wheat, oat, potato, white, whole grain, and mixed flours), soft and hard pretzels, pastries, cookies, toast, corn tortillas. flour tortillas, pita bread, croissants, pie crusts, muffins, brownies, cakes, bagels, doughnuts, cereals, extruded, snacks, granolaproducts, flours, corn meal, ntasa, potato flakes, polenta, batter mixes and dough products, refrigerated and frozen doughs, reconstituted foods, processed and frozen foods, breading on meats and vegetables, hash browns, mashed potatoes, crepes, pancakes, waffles, pizza crust, peanut butter,<br><br>
foods containing chopped and processed nuts, jellies, fillings, mashed fruits, mashed vegetables, alcoholic beverages such as beers and ales, cocoa, cocoa powder, chocolate, hot chocolate, cheese, animal foods such as dog and cat kibble, and any other human or animal food products that are subject to sheeting or extruding or that are made from a dough or mixture of ingredients,<br>
The use of the term "fabricated foods" herein includes fabricated snacks'as previously defined, The use of the term "food products" herein includes, all fabricated snacks and fabricated foods as previously defined,<br>
As referred to herein, the thermally-processed foods include foods that can be treated with an asparaginase solution, by way of example and without limitation, all of the foods previously listed as examples of fabricated snacks and fabricated foods, as well as French fries, sliced potatoes, yarn fries, other tuber or root materials, cooked vegetables including cooked asparagus, onions, and tomatoes, coffee beans, cocoa beans, cooked meats, dehydrated fruits and vegetables, heat-processed animal feed, tobacco, tea, roasted or cooked nuts, soybeans, molasses, sauces such as barbecue sauce, plantain chips, apple chips, fried bananas, and other cooked fruits.<br>
According to some such embodiments, the desired ingredients for making the dough are mixed together with water, and the desired amount of asparaginase is also mixed with treated water to make an asparaginase solution. The asparaginase solution can then be added to the dough, In one embodiment, an asparaginase solution is mixed directly with desired ingredients to make a dough. The dough can then be made into a thermally processed food product,<br>
In a commercial, facility, the water used to form the dough and the asparaginase solution is that water that is readily available to the facility, which is typically the drinking water supplied to an end-user from the local municipal water supply. As used herein, "drinking water" shall mean the water supplied from a potable water supply, and includes, but is not limited to, water<br><br>
from a municipal water supply.    Almost all U.S. municipal water supplies add enough chlorine to drinking water so the drinking water has residual chlorine at the customer's tap. Many municipal water districts add chloramine to drinking water because chloramine is more stable than chlorine. As used herein, chlorine is defined as oxidizing forms of chlorine and includes, but is not. limited to chloramine and hypochlorites. Similarly, non-oxidizing forms of the chloride ion, such as provided by hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium, chloride (NaCI), are excluded from the definition,<br>
The present inventors have discovered that certain characteristics of drinking water, for example, the presence of chlorine, reduces the activity of the asparaginase enzyme to a point where it is not useful in a commercial setting for the production of food. As used herein, "residual enzyme activity" (expressed as a %) refers to the enzyme activity of a control divided by the enzyme activity of a sample, and provides a relative measurement of enzyme activity under various test conditions. The present inventors have also identified methods and systems for mitigating the effect, of drinking water on enzyme activity and preserving the residual enzyme activity of asparaginase such that it may be useful in a commercial setting. The following examples are illustrative of the foregoing. Example I<br>
Four Solutions were formed, from aiiquots, each aliquot, having an initial equal Asparaginase (Novozymes A/S) activity added, and each aliquot, diluted with distilled water or drinking water such that each Solution had a total volume of about 50 ml. The drinking water for Solution Nos, 3 and 4 was drinking water supplied from the North Texas Municipal Water District to Piano, TX USA. The water types used in each solution are described in the following Table la.<br><br>

Each of Solution Nos. 2-4 were heated at about 35°C for about 40 minutes before measuring enzyme activity, and pH using Solution No. 1 as the control for residual enzyme activity comparison.. Solution No, 1 was refrigerated for about 40 minutes at a temperature of about. 10 °C,<br>

Table lb. Residual enzyme activity of distilled water and drinking water,<br>
It should be noted that the test results for the enzyme activity and residual enzyme activity were conducted using the Test Method described at the end of this disclosure. As compared to Solution No. .1. (control). Solution No. 2 did not lose any enzyme activity. Solution No. 3 was slightly alkaline, having pH of about 8.22, and the asparaginase enzyme lost about 62% of its activity after about 40 minutes at about 35°G, The addition of dilute hydrochloric acid to drinking water (Solution No. 4) lowered the pH to about 7.55, and the asparaginase lost about 48% of its activity after about 40 minutes of being heated at about 35oC. Consequently, it appears that the alkalinity of Solution No. 3 is responsible for some loss of enzyme activity. It is<br><br>
generally recognized that pH has an impact, on asparaginase activity and the asparaginase activity is higher when the pH is between about 4 and about 7. Example 2<br>
Four Solutions were formed from aliquots, each aliquot having an initial equal Asparaginase (Novozymes A/S) activity, and each aliquot, diluted with de-ionized water or drinking water such that each Solution had a total volume of about 50 ml. The water types used in each Solution are described in the following Table 3:<br><br>

Table 2b. Residual enzyme activity and water chemistry of three different drinking water solutions.<br><br>
This data dearly demonstrates the negative impact chlorine has on residual enzyme activity. For example, Solution No. 1 (control) had no chlorine and had the highest residual enzyme activity. Solution No. 2 had. the lowest level of residual enzyme activity, and the highest level of free chlorine and total hardness,<br>
Solution No. 3 had a relatively low concentration of free chlorine, and a moderate hardness level, with a residual activity of over 80%, Solution No. 4 had a free-chlorine concentration similar to that of Solution No, 3, and a lower hardness level, resulting in a slightly higher residual activity. Table 2b demonstrates that the residual enzyme activity of asparaginase is inversely proportional to the level of chlorine. Example 3<br>
Four Solutions were formed from aliquots, each aliquot having an initial equal Asparaginase (Novozymes A/S) activity, and each aliquot, diluted with de-ionized water or drinking water such that each. Solution had a total volume of about 50 mi. The water types for each sample are listed in 'fable 3a below.<br><br>

Table 3b, Residua! enzyme activity of solutions having various levels of chlorine.<br>
As Table 3b above indicates, the addition of chlorine to cleionized water as shown by Solution 2 or chlorine's presence in drinking water as shown by Solution 3 clearly lowers the residual activity of the asparaginase enzyme. Further, the. removal, or absence of .chlorine, clearly results in an increased activity of enzyme, as demonstrated by the residual activity level of enzyme in deionized water in Solution 1 and as demonstrated by the residual enzyme activity in BRITA filtered water in Solution 4, The chlorine level for Solution 2 was not measured because Chlorine in the form of sodium hypochlorite was added to the solution. Also, because drinking water was being, the relative level of chlorine in Solution 3 was known to mimic drinking water levels. Example 4<br>
The objective of this test was to analyze the effect of chlorine on enzyme activity by adding an amount of chlorine found in drinking water to deionized water having no chlorine to ascertain the effects of chlorine on asparaginase activity.<br>
Four Solutions were formed from aliqaots, each aliquot having an initial equal Asparaginase (Novozymes A/S) activity, and each aliquot, diluted with de-ionized, water or drinking water such that each Solution had a total volume of about 50 ml. The. water types for each, sample are listed in Table 4a below.<br><br>

Table 4b. Residual enzyme activity of solutions having various levels of chlorine.<br>
The data in Table 4b above demonstrates that when chlorine alone is added to water, the residual asparaginase activity is substantially lowered. However, at relatively low levels, chlorine has less impact on the residual enzyme activity. Example 5<br>
Five solutions were prepared to ascertain the potential effects of drinking water modification on the residual activity of asparaginase. Each solution was formed from aliquots. each aliquot having an initial equal Asparaginase (Novozymes A/S) activity, and each aliquot, diluted with de-ionized water or drinking water such that each Solution had a total volume of<br><br>
about 50 ml. The citric acid was added to make the solutions slightly acidic. The water types used in each. Solution: are described in the following Table 5a:<br><br><br>

fable 5b. Residual enzyme activity of various treated drinking water solutions.<br>
Figure la is a graphical representation of the residual enzyme activity after various treatments of drinking water. The enzyme activity is represented by the bars in the bar chart and the total chlorine concentration is represented by the line (150). As evidenced by the data, thiosulfate (added at a level about 5 times greater than the chlorine concentration in drinking water) decreased the chlorine concentration and increased enzyme activity to 86% (140). Thedrinking water, having a total chlorine of 1.2 ppm had a relatively low residual activity of only 12% (110). Citric acid decreased the level of chlorine in drinking water and increased the enzyme.activity to 32% (120).<br>
Enzyme activity (130) in drinking water with EDTA was equivalent to the enzyme activity of de-ionized water (100), but EDTA only slightly decreased the total chlorine. Without being bound by theory, Applicants believe that the EDTA may either jacket and thereby protect the enzyme from chlorine or believe that EDTA may tie up the chlorine. For example, the chlorine still shows up when tested, but the reaction a reversible reaction between EDTA and chlorine may prevent chlorine front oxidizing or otherwise reacting with asparaginase. "Thus, the. EDTA appears to inactivate the chlorine. Consequently, in one embodiment, additives can be added that inhibit the chlorine from reducing the activity of asparaginase and/or that inactivate the chlorine, Example 6<br>
Five solutions were prepared to ascertain the potential effects of hard water constituents commonly found in drinking water. Each solution was formed from aliquots, each aliquot having an initial equal Asparaginase (Novozymcs A/S) activity, and each aliquot, diluted with de-ionized water or drinking water such that each Solution had a total volume of about 50 ml. Each salt solution add salt added to achieve a salt concentration of 5 mM (5 mlllimolar), which is roughly double the calcium carbonate concentration found in drinking water from Piano, TX. For example, referring to Table 3b above, the Total Hardness for Solution No, 3 (Piano Drinking water) is 228 mg/L which corresponds to about 2.28mM, The various types of salts used in each Solution are described in the following  Table 6a;<br>

Table 6b. Residual enzyme activity of various salt water mixtures.<br>
Figure lb is a graphical representation of the residual enzyme activity of various salt water mixtures and graphically shows the results from Table 6b above. The added salt had no apparent effect on me enzyme stability. Consequently, it is believed that chlorine is responsible for most of loss of asparaginase activity. Example 7<br>
Two aiiquots having an initial equal Asparaginase Activity were diluted equally with deionized water (Cell .1.) and tap water (Cell 2} to make a first.asparaginase solution and a second asparaginase, solution. Each solution was held for 30 minutes at room temperature and then each asparaginase solution was then added to corn raasa. Asparagine in the raasa was measured 5 minutes and 10 .minutes after the enzyme was added to the masa and the values measured are shown in Table 7 below.<br><br>

table 7. Asparagine level in corn masa using enzyme mixed with drinking water and deionized water.<br>
The level of asparagine in the corn masa shown in Table 7 above, demonstrates that the resultant level of asparagine is highly dependent on the underlying diluted asparaginase solution. in. the embodiment.shown above, the level difference was on the order of about one magnitude in the level of asparagine in com masa following treatment by de-ionized water versus drinking water.<br>
The data shown above clearly indicates that the active chlorine level must be lowered to maximize the residual activity of asparaginase. Because the de-ionized water and distilled water 'are expensive, the present invention provides a way to maximize residual enzyme activity by selectively removing and/or inactivating chlorine from drinking water or other water source.<br>
Any method known in the art that can reduce the concentration of enzyme activity reducing components in drinking water can be used, including but not limited to,.treating drinking water to reduce the concentration of the activity reducing component by filtration of drinking water through activated carbon, an air stripper (to volatilize the chlorine), reverse osmosis systems, and/or ion-exchanse resins. Drinking water can also be treated by mixing<br><br>
drinking water with de-ionized water or distilled water in sufficient amounts to lower the concentration of activity reducing components to make a stable enzyme solution,<br>
As used herein, a "scavenger" Is any additive that preserves enzyme activity by reacting with chlorine.   Consequently, scavengers for enzyme reducing components can be added to the drinking water. For example, in one embodiment, thiosuifate, a scavenger for chlorine is added to the drinking water. Further, other additives can be used to inactivate the chlorine. For example, because chlorine is a strong oxidization agent, reducing agents can also be added to the drinking water to react with the chlorine. Reducing agents axe known in. oxidation-reduction chemistry to be compounds that are electron donors and oxidizing, agents are known to be electron acceptors. Consequently, in one embodiment, one or more reducing agents (e.g., electron donors) can be added to a source of drinking water to inactivate or neutralize the chlorine. Examples of reducing agents include, but are not limited to stannous chloride dihydrate, sodium sulfite, sodium meta-bisulfite, ascorbic acid, ascorbic acid derivatives, isoascorbic acid (erythorbic acid), salts of ascorbic acid derivatives, iron, zinc, ferrous ions, and combinations thereof.,<br>
In one embodiment, the present, invention reduces the total chlorine concentration to a level that is between about 0 and less than about 0.5 ppm and preferably between 0 and about 0.1 ppm.<br>
In one embodiment, asparaginase can then be mixed with the treated water to make a stable asparaginase solution and the asparaginase solution can then be mixed with food product, In one embodiment, drinking water is sufficiently treated and a stable enzyme or asparaginase solution occurs when the residual enzyme activity is at least about 80% and more preferably at least about 90% for at. least 30 minutes and more preferably for at. least, about 4 hours after the enzyme has been added to treated drinking water. In one embodiment, the residual enzyme<br><br>
activity is at least about 90% for the time required to get an asparaginase solution admixed into a dough.<br>
Armed this disclosure, one skilled in the art, will be able to ascertain and provide the necessary water compositions to result in the desired residual enzyme activity.<br>
Food products the asparaginase solution can be added to include, but are not limited to, doughs,: slurries, and any other consumable products where it is desired, to lower the level of acrylamide. For example, in one embodiment, the asparaginase solution is added to a potato slurry made from potato flakes, hi one embodiment, the potato slurry is made by adding the asparaginase solution to potato flakes. In one embodiment, the asparaginase solution is used for added water and is added to a flour composition to make a dough. In one embodiment, the asparaginase solution is added to corn masa.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention comprises a. system for providing a stable solution of asparaginase that can. be added to a food ingredient having asparagine, In one embodiment, the system comprises a treatment system to treat water. The treatment system can remove components such as chlorine through an activated carbon or with other removal methods listed above and/or the treatment system can provide additives including, but not limited to, reducing agents, chlorine scavengers, or EDTA that enhances the activity of asparaginase to a level that is higher than if the additive had not been added. The treated water can then be routed to a mix tank where asparaginase can be diluted therein to make a stable asparaginase solution. The asparaginase solution can then be metered in or otherwise added to a dough used to make a fabricated food, or thermally processed as described above. The dough can then be further processed (e.g., formed by extrusion and sheeting and thermally processed) as well known in the art. Those skilled in the art, armed with this disclosure will understand that the present, invention<br><br>
can be used anywhere an asparaginase solution is desired to reduce the level of acrylamide in a. food product.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention comprises a system comprising a source of drinking water and a source of asparaginase, a treatment system operable to enhance the activity of asparaginase in the treated water to a level that is higher than if the treatment had not been occurred, and a delivery system operable to mix. the treated drinking water and asparaginase.
