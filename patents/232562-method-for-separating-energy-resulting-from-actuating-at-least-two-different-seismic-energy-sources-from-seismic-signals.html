				<td>Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]	The invention relates generally to the field of seismic exploration. More<br>
particularly, the invention relates to methods for acquiring marine seismic data using<br>
selected arrangements of sources and receivers.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]	Seismic surveying is known in the art for determining structures of rock<br>
formations below the earth's surface. Seismic surveying generally includes<br>
deploying an array of seismic sensors at the surface of the earth in a selected pattern,<br>
and selectively actuating a seismic energy source positioned near the seismic sensors.<br>
The energy source may be an explosive, a vibrator, or in the case of seismic<br>
surveying performed in the ocean, one or more air guns or water guns.<br>
[0003]	Seismic energy emanates from the source and travels through the earth<br>
formations until it reaches an acoustic impedance boundary within the earth<br>
formations. Acoustic impedance boundaries typically occur where the composition<br>
and/or mechanical properties of the earth formations change. At an acoustic<br>
impedance boundary, some of the seismic energy is reflected back toward the earth's<br>
surface, where it may be detected by one or more of the seismic sensors deployed on<br>
the surface. Other portions of the seismic energy are refracted and continue<br>
propagating in a generally downward direction until another acoustic impedance<br><br>
boundary is reached. Seismic signal processing known in the art has as an objective<br>
the determination of the depths and geographic locations of bed boundaries below<br>
the earth's surface from signals related to the reflected acoustic energy. The depth<br>
and the location of the bed boundaries is inferred from the travel time of the seismic<br>
energy to the acoustic impedance boundaries and back to the sensors at the surface.<br>
[0004]	Seismic surveying is performed in the ocean (and other large navigable<br>
bodies of water) to determine the structure of earth formations below the sea bed (or<br>
water bottom). Marine seismic surveying known in the art includes having a vessel<br>
tow one or more seismic energy sources, and the same or a different vessel tow one<br>
or more "streamers", which are arrays of seismic sensors forming part of or<br>
otherwise affixed to a cable at spaced apart locations along the cable. Typically, a<br>
seismic vessel will tow a plurality of such streamers arranged to be separated by a<br>
selected lateral distance from each other, in a pattern designed to enable relatively<br>
complete determination of subsurface geologic structures in three dimensions.<br>
[0005]	The signals detected by the seismic sensors at the earth's surface (or near the<br>
water surface) include components of seismic energy reflected at the bed boundaries,<br>
as previously explained. In addition, both coherent noise (noise which has a<br>
determinable pattern, such as may be caused by a ship propeller) and incoherent<br>
(random) noise may be present. The presence of such noise in the signals received<br>
by the seismic sensors reduces the signal-to-noise ratio ("SNR") of the seismic<br>
signals of interest. An objective of seismic signal processing is to substantially<br>
eliminate the effects of noise on the signals detected by the sensors without<br>
appreciably reducing the reflected seismic energy component of the detected signals.<br>
[0006]	Prior art methods which have been used to reduce the effects of noise and<br>
acquire a higher quality seismic representation of subsurface structures include using<br>
multiple actuations of the seismic energy source (multiple "firings" or "shots") to<br>
record a plurality of sensor measurements from substantially the same subsurface<br>
structure, and then summing or "stacking" such measurements to enhance signal<br>
strength while substantially reducing the effects of random or incoherent noise.<br>
[0007]	U.S. Patent No. 5,818,795, which is assigned to the assignee of the present<br>
invention, provides a detailed summary of prior art methods and systems addressing<br>
the problem of noise elimination in seismic signals, and discloses as well a method of<br><br>
reducing the effect of "burst" noise in seismic signal recordings without eliminating<br>
signals related to reflected seismic energy.<br>
[0008]	In marine seismic surveying, it is known in the art to increase the effective<br>
subsurface length of coverage of a seismic streamer by using an additional seismic<br>
energy source at a spaced apart position along the survey line (direction of travel of<br>
the seismic vessel). The additional seismic energy source may be towed ahead of or<br>
behind the vessel that tows the other source and/or the seismic streamer(s).<br>
Generally speaking, methods known in the art include firing the first source and<br>
recording signals resulting therefrom, waiting a selected delay time to allow seismic<br>
energy from the first source to attenuate, and then actuating the second source. U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,761,152, which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention,<br>
describes a method and system for marine seismic surveying which increases the fold<br>
(number of recorded reflections from a same reflector), and hence the signal-to-noise<br>
ratio of seismic signals, without incurring the problems of drag, entanglement,<br>
complicated deck handling, and decreased signal-to-noise ratio associated with<br>
increased streamer length, increased number of streamers, and increased distance<br>
between streamers. Source and streamer "offsets", and time of firing of lead and<br>
trailing vessel sources in a time delay sequence are optimized to increase the fold<br>
while avoiding any influence by the seismic signals resulting from the source of one<br>
vessel on the seismic signals resulting from the source of the other vessel.<br>
[0009J	A limitation to methods known in the art for using more than one' seismic<br>
source, such as disclosed in the ' 152 patent, for example, is that it is necessary to<br>
wait a substantial amount of time, typically several seconds or more, between firing<br>
the first source and firing the second source, to enable identification of the energy in<br>
the recorded seismic signals as having been caused by the first or the second source.<br>
Such identification is necessary in order to properly interpret subsurface structures<br>
from the detected seismic signals. The waiting time between firing the first source<br>
and the second source reduces the speed at which seismic surveys can be recorded,<br>
and thus reduces the efficiency of making such surveys. Accordingly, it is desirable<br>
to be able to reduce the waiting time in multiple source seismic surveys to a<br>
minimum.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0010]	One aspect of the invention is a method for separating energy resulting<br>
from actuating at least two different seismic energy sources from seismic signals, said<br>
method comprising : sorting the seismic signals such that events therein resulting from<br>
actuations of the first source are substantially coherent in all spatial directions, the<br>
seismic signals resulting from a first one and a second one of the at least two sources<br>
actuated such that there is a variable time delay between successive actuations thererof;<br>
coherency filtering the first source coherency sorted signals ; sorting the seismic signals<br>
such that events therein resulting from actuations of the second source are substantially<br>
coherent in all spatial directions ; and coherency filtering the second source coherency<br>
sorted signals. In one embodiment, the coherency filtering comprises weighted slant stack<br>
processing.<br>
[0011] Another aspect of the invention is a method for seismic surveying, comprising<br>
towing a first seismic energy source and at least one seismic sensor system; towing a<br>
second seismic energy source at a selected distance from the first seismic energy source;<br>

plurality of firing sequences, each of the firing sequences including firing of the first<br>
source and the second source and recording signals generated by the at least one seismic<br>
sensor system, a time interval between firing the first source and the second source varied<br>
between successive ones of the firing sequences; sorting the seismic signals such that<br>
events therein resulting from actuations of the first source are substantially coherent in all<br>
spatial directions; coherency filtering the first source coherency sorted signals; sorting the<br>
seismic signals such that events therein resulting from actuations of the second source are<br>
substantially coherent in all spatial directions and coherency filtering the second source<br>
coherency sorted signals. In one embodiment, the coherency filtering comprises weighted<br>
slant stack processing.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
[0019]	The invention relates generally to methods for acquiring marine seismic data<br>
which use more than one seismic energy source, or source array. The sources, or<br>
source arrays are disposed at spaced apart locations along or parallel to a survey line.<br>
Using spaced apart sources, or source arrays, enables increasing the effective<br>
subsurface coverage of a "line", "string" or array of seismic receivers (sensors) with<br>
respect to what may be possible using only a single source, or source array. The<br>
invention is also related to methods for identifying which one of the seismic sources<br>
caused particular events in the signals detected by the seismic sensors. Identifying<br>
which seismic source caused the particular events is important for determining<br>
subsurface structures from the seismic signals, and may be used to reduce the effects<br>
of coherent and random noise in the recorded seismic signals.<br><br>
[0020]	In the description below, the term "seismic source" is used to describe a<br>
single seismic source, or an array of seismic energy sources. The sources can be, for<br>
example, air guns and water guns. Where an array of air guns or water guns is used,<br>
the guns are fired substantially simultaneously to produce a single "shot" of seismic<br>
energy. Therefore the number of individual air guns or water guns in any<br>
implementation of a "seismic source" is not a limitation on the scope of the<br>
invention. A seismic vessel will typically tow one, two or more such seismic<br>
sources, each of which is actuated ("fired") at separate times. In the following<br>
description of methods according to the invention, two such seismic sources are<br>
used. It should be clearly understood that a method and system according to the<br>
invention can have two sources towed as a single source towed from a single seismic<br>
vessel followed by a second source towed by a second "source vessel", or more than<br>
two sources can be towed by one or more such vessels. Also, where more than one<br>
seismic and/or source vessel is used in a particular survey it is not necessary for each<br>
of the vessels operating together in the survey to tow the same number of sources.<br>
[0021]	Figure 1 shows one example of a marine seismic data acquisition<br>
arrangement, the arrangement in Figure 1 may be used to record seismic signals that<br>
can be processed using methods according to the invention. A seismic recording<br>
vessel (SEV) 1 tows first seismic sources SA1, SA2, and one or more "streamers" or<br>
seismic sensor arrays as shown at 2a-2d.<br>
[0022]	Each streamer 2a-2d includes a plurality of seismic sensors (typically<br>
hydrophones - not shown individually) disposed thereon at spaced apart locations<br>
along each streamer 2a-2d. The streamers 2a-2d are disposed along lines<br>
substantially parallel to the survey line 5. The sensors (not shown) in the streamers<br>
2a-2d are operatively coupled to a recording system 6 disposed on the SEV 1.<br>
[0023]	A source vessel (SOV) 4 trails the SEV 1 along the survey line 5. The SOV 4<br>
tows second seismic sources SB1-SB2 The second sources SB1, SB2 are towed at a<br>
selected distance from the first sources SA1, SA2.<br>
[0024]	The seismic recording system 6 may also include navigation equipment (not<br>
shown separately) to enable precisely determining the position of the vessels 1,4 and<br>
the individual sensors (not shown separately) as seismic signals are recorded. The<br><br>
seismic recording system 6 may also include a source controller which selectively<br>
controls actuation of the one or more sources towed by the SEV 1 and by the SOV 4.<br>
Timing of source actuation by the source controller (not shown separately) will be<br>
further explained.<br>
[0025]	Each of the seismic sources SA1, SA2, SB1, SB2 in this embodiment, as<br>
previously explained, will typically include an array of air guns. Such arrays are<br>
used, for among other reasons as is known in the art, to provide "whiter" seismic<br>
energy (including a broader range of frequencies and having a more nearly constant<br>
amplitude for such frequencies). Figure 1 also shows the second sources SB1-SB2<br>
towed by the SOV 4 behind the seismic vessel 1. The second seismic sources may<br>
alternatively be towed in front of the SEV 1 at a selected distance. In other<br>
embodiments, the seismic acquisition system may include additional source vessels,<br>
shown generally at 7 and 8 in Figure 1. These additional source vessels 7, 8 may<br>
each tow one or more additional seismic sources, shown generally at SC1 and SC2.<br>
[0026]	The first SA1, SA2 and second SB1, SB2 seismic energy sources are used in<br>
marine seismic surveying to increase the coverage area of the seismic data detected<br>
by the streamers 2a-2d, and recorded by the recording system 6. Typically, each of<br>
the sources SA1, SA2, SB2, SB2 will be actuated in a sequence which reduces<br>
interference in the recorded signals. For purposes of the description which follows<br>
of methods according to the invention, a "first source" can be either one of the<br>
sources towed by the SEV 1, these being sources SA1 and SA2. A "second'source"<br>
refen id to in the description can be either one of the sources towed by the SOV 4,<br>
these sources being SB1 and SB2.<br>
[0027]	As previously explained, it should be understood that for purposes of defining<br>
the scope of the invention, it is not necessary to have a separate source vessel, or<br>
source vessels, to tow the second source (or any additional sources) as shown in<br>
Figure 1, although having such a separate source vessel provides practical benefits<br>
such as increasing the effective subsurface coverage of the streamers 2a-2d, as is<br>
known in the art. For purposes of defining the scope of this invention, it is only<br>
necessary to have two seismic energy sources, where the second seismic energy<br>
source (or source array) is towed along (or parallel to) a survey line, such as 5 in<br>
Figure 1, at a selected distance from the first seismic source (or source array).<br><br>
[0028]	During acquisition of seismic signals, the first sources SA1, SA2 and the<br>
second sources SB1, SB2 are sequentially fired in a plurality of firing sequences, the<br>
timing of which will be further explained, and signals detected by the sensors (not<br>
shown) on the streamers 2a-2d are recorded by the recording system 6.<br>
[0029]	Figure 2 shows an example of paths 21 ("ray paths") of seismic energy as it<br>
travels from the first sources or source arrays (SA1-SA2 in Figure 1), the location<br>
along the survey line (5 in Figure 1) of which is shown at 20, downward through the<br>
water 26, to a subsurface acoustic impedance boundary (bed boundary) 24. Some of<br>
the seismic energy is reflected from the bed boundary 24 and travels upwardly<br>
through the water 26 where it is detected by the sensors on each of the streamers (2a-<br>
2d in Figure 1), the locations of some of which are shown at 22. The ray paths 21<br>
shown in Figure 2 correspond to the path traveled by the seismic energy to each tenth<br>
sensor in one of the streamers (2a-2d in Figure 1), recordings of which will be shown<br>
and explained below with reference to Figures 4-13.<br>
[0030]	Figure 3 shows ray paths 31 for acoustic energy traveling from the second<br>
sources (SB1-SB2 as shown in Figure 1), the position of which is shown at 30 in<br>
Figure 3. The sensor positions 22 are substantially the same as those shown in<br>
Figure 2, because the second source (or array) is actuated at a time delay with respect<br>
to actuation of the first source (or array) such that the seismic and source vessels, and<br>
thus the towed sources and receivers, move only a very small distance along the<br>
water 26 during the delay time. In Figure 3, the position of the second source 30<br>
with respect to the streamers and first source is typically selected such that the ray<br>
paths from 31 from the second source have different reflection locations along the<br>
boundary 24 than do the ray paths from the first source, such as shown in Figure 2.<br>
[0031]	As explained above in the Background section, prior art methods for using<br>
two or more spaced apart sources in an arrangement such as shown in Figure 1<br>
include firing the first source, and waiting before firing the second source a sufficient<br>
amount of time such that signals detected by the sensors resulting from firing the first<br>
source have substantially attenuated. In methods according to the invention, the<br>
second source is fired after a relatively small selected delay time after firing the first<br>
source, such that signals from the first source that have substantial amplitude are still<br>
being detected by the sensors.<br><br>
[0032]	In a method according to one aspect of the invention, the first source is<br>
actuated or "fired" and a recording is made of the signals detected by the sensors that<br>
is indexed to a known time reference with respect to time of firing the first source.<br>
The second source (or array) is then fired at a predetermined delay time after the<br>
firing of the first source, while signal recording continues. Firing the first source,<br>
waiting the predetermined delay time and firing the second source is referred to<br>
herein as a "firing sequence." Firing the first source, waiting a predetermined time<br>
delay firing the second source, while recording seismic signals, are then repeated in a<br>
second firing sequence. The firing sequence is then repeated, using a different delay<br>
time. The predetermined time delay between firing the first source and firing the<br>
second source is different for the second, and for each subsequent firing sequence in<br>
a survey. For purposes of the invention, seismic signals are recorded for a plurality<br>
of such firing sequences, typically three or more firing sequences, each having a<br>
different predetermined time delay between firing the first source and firing the<br>
second source.<br>
[0033]	Although the time delay varies from sequence to sequence, the time delay<br>
between firing the first source and the second source in each firing sequence is<br>
preferably at least as long as the "wavelet" time of the seismic energy generated by<br>
the first source to avoid interference between the first and second sources. Typically,<br>
however, the time delay is less than one second, but in some cases may be several<br>
seconds. In some embodiments, the time delay between successive firing sequences<br>
may vary in a known, but random manner. In other embodiments, the time delay<br>
may vary in a known, but quasi-random manner. In still other embodiments, the time<br>
delay may be varied systematically. Examples of seismic signals as will be<br>
explained below with reference to Figures 4-13 may include a time delay variation<br>
between successive firing sequences of about 100 milliseconds.<br>
[0034]	Firing the first source and the second source in a plurality of firing sequences<br>
as described above, each having a different time delay, enables separating<br>
components of the detected seismic signals which result from the first source and<br>
from the second source, as will be explained below with respect to Figures 4-14.<br>
[0035]	Figure 4 shows a graphic display of amplitude indexed to the time of source<br>
actuation of the signals as would be detected by each of the sensors in one of the<br><br>
streamers (2a-2d in Figure 1) towed by the seismic vessel (1 in Figure 1). The<br>
signals shown in Figure 4 were synthesized for an example earth model such as the<br>
one shown in Figures 2 and 3. The display in Figure 4 shows signals resulting from<br>
a single firing of the first source, followed by a single firing of the second source<br>
after a predetermined time delay. The display in Figure 4 is arranged such that the<br>
signal from the sensor towed closest to the seismic vessel is on the left hand side of<br>
the display. The sensor signal displays or "traces" displayed from left to right in<br>
Figure 4 represent the individual sensor signals from successively more distant (from<br>
the seismic vessel) ones of the sensors. Reflected seismic energy originating from<br>
the first source (or array, the position of which is shown at 20 in Figure 2) appears as<br>
a high amplitude event that may be correlated in each successive trace, as shown at<br>
40. Signals from the second source (or array, the position of which is shown at 30 in<br>
Figure 3) that correspond to reflected energy from the same subsurface boundary<br>
(shown at 24 in Figures 2 and 3) can be identified by another event shown at 42. As<br>
would be expected, the event 40 resulting from the first source shows increased<br>
arrival time with respect to individual sensor distance from the first source in a well<br>
known relationship called "moveout." Correspondingly, the signals from the second<br>
source show moveout for event 42 in the opposite direction because of the placement<br>
of the second source with respect to the streamers (2a-2d in Figure 1).<br>
[0036]	The table in Figure 4 shows, for each source, a time of firing of each source<br>
with respect to a time index for signal recording. For the sake of brevity of<br>
description that follows, the first source (or source array) will be referred to in<br>
corresponding tables in each Figure as "source A" and the second source (or source<br>
array) will be referred to as "source B." The time delay between firing source A and<br>
source B identified in Figure 4 is 0.1 second (100 milliseconds).<br>
[0037]	A display of synthesized signals resulting from a second firing sequence of<br>
sources A and B, for the earth model of Figures 2 and 3, is shown in Figure 5. The<br>
firing sequence for which detected signals are shown in Figure 5 is made at a<br>
selected time after recording the signals from the first firing (corresponding signals<br>
for which are shown in Figure 4). This selected time depends on factors such as an<br>
approximate depth to which seismic analysis is desired to be performed, length of the<br>
streamers (2a-2d in Figure 1), as is well known in the art, and typically is in a range<br><br>
of about 8 to 20 seconds. Arrival of reflective events corresponding to the events<br>
shown at 40 and 42 in Figure 4 is shown for source A at 50 in Figure 5 and for<br>
source B at 52. As shown in the table in Figure 5, the selected time delay between<br>
firing source A and source B is 0.3 seconds (300 milliseconds).<br>
[0038]	Figure 6 shows a display similar to the ones shown in Figures 4 and 5, with<br>
corresponding reflective events for source A shown at 60 and for source B and 62.<br>
The display in Figure 6 represents signals for a third firing sequences of the sources.<br>
And wherein the time delay between firing source A and source B is 0.4 seconds<br>
(400 milliseconds).<br>
[0039]	Figure 7 shows a display of signals for a fourth firing sequence of source A<br>
and source B, wherein the selected time delay between firing source A and source B<br>
is 0.2 seconds (200 milliseconds). Corresponding reflective events 70 and 72 are<br>
shown for source A signals and source B signals, respectively.<br>
[0040]	Figure 8 shows a display of signals for a fifth firing sequence of source A and<br>
source B, wherein the selected time delay is 0.5 seconds (500 milliseconds).<br>
Corresponding reflective events 80 and 82 are shown for source A signals and source<br>
B signals, respectively.<br>
[0041]	Reflection events corresponding to signals from source A, shown at 40, 50,<br>
60, 70 and 80, respectively, in Figures 4 through 8, occur at very similar times with<br>
respect to the time of firing of source A. Differences in arrival time between traces<br>
for each such event corresponding to source A may depend on the actual position of<br>
the seismic vessel (1 in Figure 1) at the time of each source A firing, which position<br>
depends on vessel speed and time between firing sequences. The arrival time of the<br>
source A events may also depend on the subsurface structure of the earth, among<br>
other factors. Nonetheless, there is a very high degree of correspondence between<br>
the source A reflection events 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, respectively, in each of Figures 4<br>
through 8.<br>
[0042]	In some embodiments of a method according to the invention, detected<br>
seismic signal components corresponding to the firing of source A can be identified<br>
in the seismic traces by a two part procedure. The first part includes determining<br>
coherence between the traces within an individual firing sequence. This part can be<br><br>
performed by selecting closely spaced subsets of all the traces (such as a subset of<br>
between five and ten traces) such as shown in Figures 4 through 8, and determining<br>
coherence between the selected traces within selected-length time windows.<br>
Coherence may be determined, for each subset of traces selected, by correlating the<br>
traces to each other over the selected-length time windows. A result of the<br>
correlation is a curve or trace the amplitude of which represents degree of<br>
correspondence from trace to trace with respect to time.<br>
[0043]	The coherence between traces determined in the first part of the procedure<br>
includes components that are also coherent between firing sequences with respect to<br>
the firing time of source A. These components represent the component of the<br>
seismic signals corresponding to actuating source A. The trace correspondence<br>
determined in the first part of the method may also include coherent noise, such as<br>
would result from signals caused by actuation of source B, shown as events 42, 52,<br>
62, 72 and 82, respectively in Figures 4 through 8, or other coherent noise such as<br>
from a ship propeller. Random noise is substantially not present in the<br>
correspondence traces because random noise has substantially no correspondence<br>
from trace to trace. The second part of the method includes separating the<br>
components of the signals which are caused by source A from the coherent noise. In<br>
one embodiment, separation of the source A component can be performed by<br>
generating trace to trace coherence measures (traces), as just described, for each of a<br>
plurality of firing sequences. Corresponding ones of the coherence traces #re then<br>
correlated to each other between firing sequences, to generate shot to shot coherence<br>
traces. The resulting shot to shot coherence traces will substantially represent<br>
seismic signals resulting only from source A. Coherent noise from source B and<br>
other coherent noise sources will be substantially absent from the shot to shot<br>
coherence traces.<br>
[0044]	The reason the source B "noise" is substantially removed by the shot to shot<br>
coherence determination can be explained as follows. As can be observed in Figures<br>
4 through 8, the arrival time of successive source B events 42, 52, 62, 72, 82,<br>
respectively, is very similar between individual traces, and so would show a high<br>
trace to trace coherence. Difference in coherence in the source B events is<br>
substantially between firing sequences (when time is indexed with respect to the<br><br>
firing time of source A). This difference in coherence in the source B events is<br>
primarily because of the different time delay between firing source A and source B in<br>
each firing sequence. Therefore, while the events 42, 52, 62, 72, 82 may show high<br>
coherence from trace to trace, they will have substantially no coherence from shot to<br>
shot when the recording time is indexed to source A. Coherent noise, such as from a<br>
ship propeller, would show similar trace to trace coherence but relatively little shot to<br>
shot coherence.<br>
[0045]	Having thus identified the "true" seismic signals originating from the first<br>
source (source A), one embodiment of a method according to the invention further<br>
includes identifying the "true" seismic signals originating from the second source<br>
(source B). This can be performed by time-aligning the signals from each firing<br>
sequence with respect to the firing time of source B. In some embodiments, this can<br>
be performed by applying a time delay to each trace such that the signals from source<br>
B all represent a same time delay from the start of signal recording or from a selected<br>
time index related to the time of firing of source B. Figure 9 shows trace display of<br>
the same signals shown in Figure 4, but with the addition of a time delay of 0.4<br>
seconds, as shown in the table in Figure 9. Figure 10 shows the same signal traces as<br>
shown in Figure 5, but with the addition of a time delay of 0.2 seconds. Similarly,<br>
Figures 11 trough 13 show traces which correspond to traces shown in Figures 6<br>
through 8, but with time delays of 0.1, 0.3 and 0.0 seconds, respectively.<br>
Corresponding reflective events for the source A and source B signals are shown in<br>
Figures 9 through 13 and 90 and 92, 100 and 102, 110 and 112, 120 and 122 and 130<br>
and 132, respectively.<br>
[0046]	In Figures 9 through 13, the signals resulting from actuating the second<br>
source (source B) in each firing sequence now each have a time delay from start of<br>
recording (in this case the firing of source A as a time reference) of 0.5 seconds, and<br>
as a result are substantially time-aligned. True seismic signal from the second source<br>
(source B) may then be identified by using trace-to-trace and shot-to-shot coherence<br>
determination, just as used to determine first source true seismic signals where the<br>
first source firings are time aligned from the start of recording, as previously<br>
explained with reference to Figures 4 through 8.<br><br>
[0047]	The foregoing embodiments of the invention are described in terms of having<br>
two seismic energy sources at spaced apart positions. However, the invention is not<br>
limited in scope to having only two sources and identifying two trace to trace and<br>
shot to shot components. In other embodiments, three or more sources may be used.<br>
In such embodiments, the third, and any additional sources, are each fired<br>
sequentially in each firing sequence. For example, the system shown in Figure 1<br>
includes six sources SA1, SA2, SB1, SB, SCI, SC2. A third source, which may be<br>
any of the remaining unfired source in the system of Figure 1 is fired after a selected<br>
time delay after the second source is fired. The time delay between firing the second<br>
source and the third source is different than the delay between firing the first source<br>
and the second source. The delay between firing the second source and the third<br>
source is also different in each firing sequence. As in the previous embodiments, it is<br>
preferred that the time delay between source firings in any one sequence be at least<br>
as long as the wavelet time for the immediately prior source firing. The delay times<br>
may be random, quasi-random or systematically determined, as in previous<br>
embodiments, and only need to be known. In embodiments using three or more<br>
sources, determining coherent signal components identified to the third and any<br>
additional sources includes time aligning the recorded signals with respect to the<br>
source for which reflective events are desired to be identified, and determining trace<br>
to trace and shot to shot coherent components of the time-aligned signals.<br>
[0048]	It has been determined that certain types of coherency processing for<br>
determining which of the seismic sources caused particular events in the detected<br>
seismic signals may provide improved separation of the events in the recorded<br>
seismic signals corresponding to each of the sources. One embodiment of such<br>
coherency processing will now be explained with respect to Figure 14. At 134 in<br>
Figure 14, seismic data recorded as explained above with respect to Figures 1-8 are<br>
sorted into a first three-dimensional domain such that signals resulting from<br>
actuations of the first seismic source (or source A) are coherent in all spatial<br>
directions. A preferred domain includes sorting individual traces such that along one<br>
spatial axis, the traces represent signals acquired such that the receivers (seismic<br>
sensors) in each of the streamers (2a-2d in Figure 1) is disposed at substantially the<br>
same geographic position along the water surface at the firing times of the first<br><br>
source. Thus, a plane perpendicular to the selected spatial axis (and parallel to the<br>
time axis in a 3-D record section) would be called a "common channel plane."<br>
Traces sorted in the common-channel plane domain with respect to the first source<br>
actuation times will have signals that are coherent with respect to the actuation of the<br>
first source. The signals in traces sorted in the common channel plane with respect<br>
to the first source will be substantially incoherent with respect to the actuation times<br>
of the second source. As a matter of convenience, trace sorting to provide coherence<br>
with respect to actuation of the first source will be referred to as "first source<br>
coherency sorting." In one implementation of coherency sorting, the seismic traces<br>
are sorted in a tiiree dimensional volume, in which common channels are disposed<br>
along one spatial axis, and common shots are disposed along the other spatial axis.<br>
[0049]	In a different implementation of coherency sorting, the seismic traces are<br>
sorted such that common depth point (CDP) traces are disposed along one spatial<br>
axis, and common offsets are disposed along the other spatial axis.<br>
[0050]	After first source coherency sorting, the coherency sorted traces are<br>
coherency filtered. Coherency filtering will remove a substantial portion of the<br>
incoherent energy present in die sorted data. In the present embodiment, as shown at<br>
136 in Figure 14, the coherency filtering includes weighted slant stack processing.<br>
Weighted slant-stack processing is described in U. S. Patent Application No.<br>
09/767,650 filed on January 23, 2001 and assigned to the assignee of the present<br>
invention and incorporated herein by reference. As described in more detail in the<br>
'650 application, weighted slant stack processing includes transforming the sorted<br>
traces from the space time domain, Sx, y(t), into the slant-stack (r-px py) domain. In<br>
the present embodiment, transforming the traces into the slant stack domain is<br>
performed using a Radon transform. A Radon transform may use an equation such<br>
as the following in which T represents the set of transformed data:<br><br>
[0051]	In the foregoing equation, N represents the number of traces, Sx, y represents a<br>
subset of the whole volume of traces, and Fx,y represents a scaling function. In the<br><br>
foregoing equation, x represents the distance along a first direction, and y represents<br>
the distance along a second direction. The distances correspond to seismic sensor<br>
positions on the water surface at the time the corresponding traces were recorded. px<br>
represents a slope in the first direction, py represents a slope in the second direction, a<br>
and b represent, for the first (x) direction, and c and d represent, for the second (y)<br>
direction, the endpoints along each respective direction of the spatial volume to be<br>
transformed, r (tau) represents intercept time in the x-px py domain.<br>
[0052]	After transforming the coherency sorted traces, the transformed traces may be<br>
processed to exclude all but portions thereof representing coherent energy with<br>
respect to actuation times of the first source. An inverse Radon transform may then<br>
be performed to return the coherency filtered traces to the space-time domain. The<br>
result is a set of traces which include energy primarily resulting from actuation of the<br>
first source, as shown at 138 in Figure 14.<br>
[0053]	Next, the originally recorded seismic traces may be sorted into a domain<br>
which is coherent with respect to actuation times of the second source (or source B),<br>
as shown at 140 in Figure 14. In the present embodiment, the sorting may be<br>
performed into the common channel/common shot domain with respect to the second<br>
source. Alternatively, the seismic traces may be sorted into the CDP/common offset<br>
domain. Similarly as for the first source coherency sorting, sorting the recorded<br>
traces to provide coherency with respect to actuation of the second source may be<br>
referred to for convenience as "second source coherency sorting." The second<br>
source coherency sorted traces may then be slant stack processed, as shown at 142 in<br>
Figure 14 and as previously explained with respect the first source coherency sorted<br>
traces. The result of the combined second source coherency sorting and slant stack<br>
processing is a set of traces which include energy primarily resulting from actuation<br>
of the second source, as shown at 144 in Figure 14.<br>
[0054]	In theory, the two sets of traces generated as explained above provide trace<br>
sets including energy resulting only from actuation of the first source and the second<br>
source, respectively. As a practical matter, however, coherency filtering, including<br>
weighted slant stack processing, is not perfect. As a result, some energy resulting<br>
from actuations of the second source may remain in the trace set corresponding to the<br>
actuation of the first source, and some energy corresponding to the actuation of the<br><br>
first source may remain in the trace set corresponding to actuation of the second<br>
source. In one embodiment and referring to Figure 15, the separation of seismic<br>
energy resulting from the first source and the second source in each of the respective<br>
trace sets can be improved by the following process.<br>
[0055]	First, the trace sets representing energy primarily from the first source and<br>
from the second source produced as explained above are both subtracted, as shown at<br>
146, from the originally recorded set of traces to produce a "residual" trace set. The<br>
residual trace set includes energy from the first source and energy from the second<br>
source that was not separated using the above described coherency sorting and slant<br>
stack processing.<br>
[0056]	The residual trace set is then processed as explained above with respect to the<br>
originally recorded set. First, the residual trace set is sorted to be coherent with<br>
respect to the first source (first source coherency sorted), as shown at 148. Then the<br>
first source coherency sorted residual traces are transformed into the slant stack<br>
domain, and incoherent energy is then removed from the coherency sorted,<br>
transformed residual traces, as shown at 150. The coherent energy remaining in the<br>
processed traces may be inverse transformed into the space time domain. The result<br>
is a trace set having coherent energy with respect to the first source actuations still<br>
remaining in the residual traces and most of any remaining energy not coherent with<br>
respect to actuation of the first source removed.<br>
[0057]	The residual trace set is then sorted, as shown at 156, to be coherent with<br>
respect to the second source, and weighted slant stack processing, as shown at 158, is<br>
then performed to separate energy that is not coherent with respect to the second<br>
source actuations. The result is a trace set having coherent energy with respect to the<br>
second source actuations still remaining in the residual traces, and most of any<br>
remaining energy not coherent with respect to actuation of the second source<br>
removed.<br>
[0058]	A selected parameter corresponding to the amount of coherent energy with<br>
respect to each of the sources in each of the trace sets processed as above (coherency<br>
processed residual traces) from the residual trace set may then be compared to a<br>
selected threshold. Comparing for the respective processed trace sets is shown at<br>
152 and 160 in Figure 15. In one embodiment, the selected threshold may be a total<br><br>
energy in the traces. In another embodiment, the selected threshold may be a peak<br>
trace amplitude. In another embodiment, the selected threshold may be an average<br>
amplitude in the traces. Irrespective of the parameter used to select the threshold, if<br>
the parameter of the coherency processed residual traces exceeds the selected<br>
threshold, the coherency processed residual traces may then be subtracted from the<br>
residual traces, and the process as above repeated until the threshold is not exceeded.<br>
Any energy remaining in the final coherency processed residual traces may then be<br>
added, as shown at 154 and 162, respetively, to the corresponding coherency<br>
processed traces used as input to the residual processing described above with<br>
respect to Figure 14.<br>
[0059]	The foregoing embodiments of a method for determining which components<br>
of a seismic signal are a result of a particular one of a plurality of seismic sources can<br>
take the form of a computer program stored in a computer readable medium. The<br>
program includes logic operable to cause a programmable computer to perform the<br>
steps explained above with respect to Figures 14 and 15.<br>
[0060]	Embodiments of a method according to the invention enable recording<br>
seismic surveys using a plurality of sources disposed at spaced apart positions such<br>
that the subsurface coverage of each sensor "streamer" is increased as compared with<br>
methods using only a single source. As compared with methods known in the art<br>
using multiple, spaced apart sources, methods according to the invention may<br>
provide the additional benefit of reducing a waiting time between firing the sources<br>
in firing sequences because signals from each of the plurality of sources may be<br>
uniquely identified in a shot sequence. Therefore, embodiments of a method<br>
according to the invention may increase the efficiency with which seismic surveying<br>
is performed.<br>
[0061]	While the invention has been described with respect to a limited number of<br>
embodiments, those skilled in the art, having benefit of this disclosure, will<br>
appreciate that other embodiments can be devised which do not depart from the<br>
scope of the invention as disclosed herein. Accordingly, the scope of the invention<br>
