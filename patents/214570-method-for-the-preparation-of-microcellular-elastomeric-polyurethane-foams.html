				<td>The present invention relates to the preparation of microcellular elastomenc polyurethane foams from a reaction.<br>
Conventional polyurethane elastomers are made from formulations which have a hardblock-content of about 30 to 40% by weight (hardblock-content being defined herein as the sum of the amounts of polyisocyanates, chain extenders and, optionally, cross-linking agents, relative to the total amount of polymer in weight percent).<br>
Formulations having a higher hardblock-content are difficult to process and result in products with a very high hardness.<br>
Formulations comprising high amounts of 4,4'-MDI and polyether polyols having high EO-contents have already been used to prepare flexible polyurethane foams, see for example EP-A 547764, EP-A 547765 and EP-A 549120.<br>
The preparation of elastomeric polyurethanes from polyether polyol having low ethylene oxide (EO)-content is also known, see for example US-A 5122548 and EP-A 13487.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found possible to produce microcellular polyurethane elastomeric foams which have a very high hardblock-content, without having an excessively high hardness and which are easily processable over a wide density range.<br>
Accordingly, (here is provided a method for the preparation of microcellular clastomeric polyurethane foams from a reaction characterized in that it comprises a polyisocyanate component, a polyol composition, a chain extender, water and optionally a cross-linking agent wherein the polyisocyanate component contains 85 -100% by weight of 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate or a variant thereof, the polyol composition comprises a polyoxyalkylene polyol containing oxyethylene residues, said polyol composition having an average nominal hydroxyl functionality of from 2 to 6, an average hydroxyl equivalent weight of 1300-2000 or more and an average oxvethylene content of between 50 and at least l)0% and at least 95% by weight, and the chain extender has an average hydroxyl equivalent weight of from 15 to 250, the hardblock-content being more than 45% by weight.<br>
Thus, according to the invention, there is provided a method for the<br>
preparation of microcellular elastomeric polyurethane foams a reaction mixture<br>
comprising a polyisocyanate component, a polyol composition, a chain extender,<br>
water and optionally a cross-linking agent, wherein the polyisocyanate<br>
component	contains	at	least	85%	by	weight	of<br>
4,4' diphenylmethane diisocyanate or a variant thereof, the polyol composition comprises at least one polyoxyalkylene polyol containing oxvethylene residues, said polyoJ composition having an average nominal hydroxyl functionality of from 2 to 6, an average hydroxyl equivalent weight of at least 1300 and an average oxvethylene content of between 50 and 85% by weight, and the chain extender has an average hydroxyl<br>
equivalent weight of from 15 to 250, the hardblock-content being more than 45% by weight.<br>
The polyisocyanate component used in the method of the invention may consist essentially of pure 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate or mixtures of that diisocyanate with one or more other organic polyisocyanates, especially other diphenylmethane diisocyanate isomers, for example the 2,4'-isomer optionally in conjunction with the 2,2'-isomer. The polyisocyanate component may also be an MDI variant derived from a polyisocyanate composition containing at least 85% by weight of 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate. MDI variants are well known in the art and, for use in accordance with the invention, particularly include liquid products obtained by introducing uretonimine and/or carbodiimide groups into said polyisocyanate composition and/or by reacting with one or more polyols.<br>
Preferred as the polyisocyanate component are polyisocyanate compositions containing at least 90% by weight of 4,4'-diphenyImethane diisocyanate. Polyisocyanate compositions containing at least 95% by weight of 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate are most preferred.<br>
The term "average nominal hydroxyl functionality" is used herein to indicate the average functionality (number of hydroxyl groups per molecule) of the polyol composition on the assumption that the average functionality of the polyoxyalkylene polyols present therein is identical with the average functionality (number of active hydrogen atoms per molecule) of the initiators) used in their preparation although in practice it will often be somewhat less because of some terminal unsaturation. It is preferred that the average nominal hydroxyl functionality of the polyol composition is from 2 to 4, most preferred polyoxyalkylene polyols being diols or triols.<br>
The composition may comprise a single polyoxyalkylene polyol which preferably is a poly(oxyethylene-oxypropylene) polyol having the required average nominal hydroxyl functionality, hydroxyl equivalent weight and oxyethylene content Such polyols are known in the art and may be obtained in conventional manner by reacting ethylene and propylene oxides simultaneously and/or sequentially in any order with an initiator having from 2 to 6 active hydrogen atoms such as water, a polyol, a hydroxylamine or<br>
a polyamine and the like. Examples of polyol initiators are ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, 1,3-propane diol, neopentyl glycol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, glycerin, trimethylol propane, erythritol, xylitol, glucose, fructose, mannitol or sorbitol.<br>
Alternatively, the polyol composition may comprise a mixture of two or more polyols such that the total composition has the required average nominal hydroxyl functionality, average hydroxyl equivalent weight and oxyethylene content. The other polyols may be selected from poiyethers, polyesters, polythioethers, polycarbonates, polyacetals, polyolefins or polysiloxanes.<br>
Polyether polyols may be, for example, polyoxypropylene polyols, polyoxyethylene polyols or poly(oxyethylene-oxypropylene) polyols containing less than 50% or more than 85% by weight of oxyethylene residues.<br>
Polyester polyols which may be used include hydroxyl-terminated reaction products of dihydric alcohols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, neopentyl glycol, 1,6-hexanediol or cyclohexane dimethanol or mixtures of such dihydric alcohols, and dicarboxylic acids or their ester-forming derivatives, for example succinic, glutaric and adipic acids or their dimethyl esters, sebacic acid, phthalic anhydride, tetrachlorophthalic anhydride or dimethyl terephthalate or mixtures thereof.<br>
Polyesteramides may be obtained by the inclusion of aminoalcohols such as ethanolamine in polyesteriflcation mixtures.<br>
Polythioether polyols which may be used include products obtained by condensing thiodiglycol either alone or with other glycols, alkylene oxides, dicarboxylic acids, formaldehyde, ammo-alcohols or aminocarboxylic acids.<br>
Polycarbonate polyols which may be used include products obtained by reacting diols such as 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,6-hexanediol diethylene glycol or tetraethylene glycol with diaryl carbonates, for example diphenyl carbonate, or with phosgene.<br>
Polyacetal polyob which may be used include those prepared by reacting glycols such as diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol or hexanediol with formaldehyde. Suitable polyacetals may also be prepared by polymerising cyclic acetals.<br>
Suitable polyolefm polyob include hydroxy-terminated butadiene homo- and copolymers and suitable polysiloxane polyols include polydimethylsiloxane diols.<br>
Other polyols which may be used comprise dispersions or solutions of addition or condensation polymers in polyols of the types described above. Such modified polyols, often referred to as "polymer" polyols have been fully described in the prior art and include products obtained by the in situ polymerisation of one or more vinyl monomers, for example styrene and acrylonitrile, in polymeric polyols, for example polyether polyols, or by the in situ reaction between a polyisocyanate and an amino- and/or hydroxyfunctional compound, such as triethanolamine, in a polymeric polyol.<br>
Preferably, the polyol composition has an average hydroxyl equivalent weight of at least 1500. The average oxyethylene content of the polyol composition is preferably between 60 and 85% by weight<br>
Suitable low molecular weight chain extenders include aliphatic diols, such as ethylene glycol, 1,3-propanedioI, 2-methyl-l,3-propanedioI, 1,4-butanediol. 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,2-propanediol, 1,3-butanediol, 2,3-butanediol, 1,3-pentanediol, 1,2-hexanediol, 3-methylpentane-l,5-diol, 2,2-dimethyl-l,3-propanediol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol and tripropylene glycol, and aminoalcohols such as ethanolamine, N-methyldiethanoiamine, N-ethyl-diethanolamine and the like. Ethylene glycol is preferred.<br>
The amount of water is suitably less than 2% by weight, and preferably less than 1% by weight, based on the total weight of the isocyanate-reactive compounds.<br>
In another aspect, the invention relates to microcellular elastomeric polyurethane foams having a density of less than 1000 kg/m3 and a Shore A hardness of at least 75. Preferably the density is less than 800 kg/m3 and the Shore A hardness at least 80. Most<br>
preferably, the microcellular elastomenc polyurethane foams have a density of less than 600 kg/m3 and a Shore A hardness of at least 85.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention provides a reaction system comprising:<br>
(i) a polyisocyanate containing at least 85% by weight of 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate or a variant thereof;<br>

(iii) a chain extender having an average hydroxyl equivalent weight of from 15 to 250;<br>
(iv)     water, and optionally,<br>
(v)       one or more additives conventional to elastomer formulations.<br>
This reaction system is used for making microcellular elastomeric polyurethane foams.<br>
The term "reaction system" is defined as a system wherein the polyisocyanate is kept in a container separate from the isocyanate-reactive ingredients.<br>
The isocyanate index of the reaction system, taking account of the polyol composition, water and any other isocyanate-reactive species, for example chain extenders or cross-linking agents, may be as low as 85 or as high as 120. Preferably, the isocyanate index is between 90 and 110.<br>
The hardblock-content is preferably at least 50% by weight of the total composition.<br>
Low molecular weight isocyanate-reactive compounds having an average functionality of 3 or more, such as glycerol, pentaerythritol or triethanolamine, may be added as crosslinking agents.<br>
The foam-forming reaction mixture may contain one or more of the additives conventional to such reaction mixtures. Such additives include catalysts, for example tertiary amines and tin compounds, surface-active agents and foam stabilisers, for<br>
example siloxane-oxyalkylene copolymers, flame retardants, organic and inorganic fillers, pigments, and internal mould release agents.<br>
The process can be carried out according to the 'one-shot', 'semi-prepolymer' or 'prepolymer* method.<br>
A wide range of elastomeric products can be made by the method of this invention.<br>
The elastomers produced by the method of this invention can be used in a large variety of applications such as shoe soles and steering wheels.<br>
