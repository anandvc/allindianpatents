PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION:<br>
The following Specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in<br>
which it is to be performed.<br><br>
A CATALYST AND A HYDROCARBON OIL CRACKING METHOD<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a catalyst and a method for<br>
    cracking  hydrocarbons.   More  particularly,  the  present   invention<br>
   relates to a catalyst and a method for cracking hydrocarbons used to<br>
                increase the concentration of propylene in FCC liquefied petroleum<br>
               gas (LPG).<br>
 	TECHNICAL BACKGROUND<br>
Propylene is an important organic chemical raw material. With the rapid increase of the demand for the derivatives such as polypropylene, the requirement for propylene in the whole world is increased rapidly year by year. Fluid catalytic cracking is one of the<br>
      most important technologies to produce light olefins and propylene. As for most of the FCC apparatus, using the catalyst or the addition agent containing zeolite with MFI structure is an effective technology in order to increase light olefins and propylene.<br>
USP3,758,403 disclosed earlier that the method by adding ZSM-5<br>
       zeolite in the FCC catalyst might increase the octane number of gasoline and the yield of C3~C4 olefins. For instance, when adding 1.5, 2.5, 5 and 10% ZSM-5 zeolite to the conventional catalyst with 10% REY molecular sieve, the octane number of gasoline is increased and the yield of low-carbon olefin is increased. The same result could be<br>
     obtained by using the addition agent with ZSM-5 zeolite.<br>
USP5,318,696 disclosed a hydrocarbon conversion technology based on a catalyst which is consisted of a marcoporous zeolite and a zeolite with MFI structure and a Si/Al ratio of lower than 30. This technology is used to produce gasoline with high octane number by<br>
     employing improved FCC process and increase low-carbon olefins, especially propylene.<br>
USP5,997,728  disclosed   a  method   in  which   a   shape-selective<br>
2<br><br>
cracking addition agent is used in large amount in the FCC process of heavy feedstock. The addition agent comprises the amorphous matrix by adding 12~40% ZSM-5 zeolite, and its inventory in the system is at least 10%, which makes the content of ZSM-5 zeolite in the catalyst   higher than 3%. This method increases low-carbon olefins in a large scale, at the same time it doesn't increase the yield of aromatic extraly and lose the yield of gasoline.<br>
The cracking activity and hydrothermal stability of ZSM-5 zeolite is increased and the use level of zeolite can be reduced after the<br>
    modification of ZSM-5 zeolite by phosphorous compounds.<br>
CN1049406C disclosed a zeolite with MFI structure which containing P and rare earth. The anhydrous chemical expression is aRE2O3- bNa2O- A1203- cP2Os- dSiO2, in which a=0.01~0.25, b=0.005~0.02, c=0.2~1.0 and d=35~120. This zeolite displays excellent<br>
      hydrothermal stability and good selectivity of low-carbon olefins when used in the conversion of hydrocarbons at high temperature.<br>
CN1034223C disclosed a cracking catalyst used to produce low-carbon olefins, which is consisted of 0~70% clay (based on weight of catalyst), 5~99% inorganic oxide and 1-50% zeolite. The zeolite is the<br>
      mixture of 0~25wt% REY or high silica Y zeolite and 75~100wt% five membered ring high silica zeolite containing P and rare earth. The catalyst has higher hydrothermal activity and stability, conversion and yield of C2=~C4= than the catalyst using conventional ZSM-5 zeolite as active component.<br>
 	USP5,110,776 disclosed the preparation of ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst<br>
modified with P, in which the modification procedure with P is proceeded by dispersing the zeolite into a solution of P compounds at a pH valve of 2~6, mixing with matrix and spray-drying. The obtained catalyst increases the octane number of gasoline, and at the same time<br>
     it doesn't increase the yield of dry gas and coke.<br>
USP6,566,293 disclosed a cracking catalyst comprising P modified ZSM-5 zeolite.  The  preparation  of P  modified  ZSM-5  zeolite  is<br>
3<br><br>
proceeded by dispersing the zeolite into a solution of P compounds at a pH value of higher than 4.5, in which the loading content of P (calculated by P2Os) is at lease 10wt%, then mixing with matrix and other zeolite components and spray-drying. The obtained catalyst has 5   high yield of low-carbon olefins.<br>
            USP5,171,921 disclosed a ZSM-5 zeolite modified by P. The Si/Al<br>
ratio of the zeolite is 20-60. After the immersion with P compounds<br>
and steam-aging treatment at 500-700*0, the zeolite displays higher<br>
activity than the zeolite without P modification when used ii the<br>
10   conversion of C3~C20 hydrocarbons to C2~C5 olefins.<br>
USP6,080,303 disclosed a method used to increase the catalytic activity of microporous and mesoporous zeolites, in which microporous and mesoporous zeolites are treated with P compounds firstly and then combined with A1PO4 gel. This method may improve 15 the activity and hydrothermal stability of microporous and mesoporous zeolites.<br>
USP5,472,594 disclosed a hydrocarbon conversion technology based on a catalyst which comprises a marcoporous zeolite and a P modified mesoporous zeolite with MFI structure. This technology is 20 used to produce gasoline with high octane number by employing improved FCC process and increase low-carbon olefins, especially C4/C5.<br>
Besides the P modification of ZSM-5 zeolite, the selectivity of the catalyst and addition agent for low-carbon olefins also could be 25   improved by the introduction of P compounds to matrix.<br>
USP2002/0003103A1 disclosed a FCC technology employed to increase the yield of propylene, in which at least part of the gasoline products are piped into the second riser reactor and cracked again. Besides marcoporous zeolite such as USY, the catalyst composition 30 used comprises mesoporous zeolite such as ZSM-5 and inorganic binder possessing cracking activity. The inorganic binder component contains F and the P/Al ratio is 0.1-10. This technology may increase<br>
4<br><br>
low-carbon olefins in a large scale, especially the yield of propylene.<br>
USP2002/0049133A1 disclosed a catalyst with high zeolite content and high attrition strength. The catalyst comprises 30~85wt% ZSM-5 zeolite, 6~24wt% P (calculated by P2Os), 
     structures, in which the zeolite is modified by the metal of Group VIII, preferred by Ni. After the introduction of Ni, the zeolite is treated at a controlled temperature under thermal or hydrothermal conditions, which leads to the enrichment of the metal of Group VIII and Al on the surface. When used in the conversion of hydrocarbons, the catalyst<br>
    may increase the octane number of gasoline and the yield of C3~C4 olefins.<br>
CN1057408A disclosed a cracking catalyst containing high Si zeolite and high cracking activity, in which the high Si zeolite is ZSM-5   zeolite,   p   zeolite   or   MOR  zeolite   containing   0.01~3.0wt%   P,<br>
     0.01~1.0wt% Fe or 0.01~10wt% Al. The high Si zeolite is obtained by heating H- or K-ZSM-5 zeolite, p zeolite or MOR zeolite with a Si/Al ratio of higher than IS to 350-820"C and passing it into an aqueous solution of Al halide, Fe halide or ammonium phosphate at a volume hourly space velocity of 0.1-l0h-1.<br>
 	CN1465527A disclosed a MFI zeolite with P and transition metal.<br>
The anhydrous chemical expression of the zeolite, calculated by mass of oxide, is (0-0.3) Na2O (0.5-5) A1203- (1.3-10) P2Os- (0.7-15) M203' (70-97) Si02, in which M is selected from one of the transition metals Fe, Co and Ni. When used in the FCC procedure of petroleum<br>
   hydrocarbon, the zeolite may increase the yield and selectivity for C2~C4 olefins and result in higher yield of LPG.<br>
At   present  for  most  of the  FCC   apparatus,   increasing  the<br>
5<br><br>
concentration of propylene in LPG is an important way to increase the economic benefits for FCC apparatus at the same yield of LPG. Although the zeolite materials and catalysts disclosed in the prior art could effectively increase the yield of low-carbon olefins and the octane   number of FCC gasoline products when used in FCC process, during the FCC reaction they give out relative low selectivity for propylene, so the scope for increasing propylene concentration in LPG is limited.<br>

zeolite, clay and inorganic oxide binder through any methods disclosed<br>
   in the existing preparation technologies of cracking catalyst such as<br>
spray-drying  process,  and  there  is  no  special  limitation   in  this<br>

The transition metal additives of Group VIIIB exist in the form of their oxide, phosphate, phosphite, basic phosphate, acid phosphate.<br>
 	One or more of the inorganic compounds and organic compounds<br>
of the transition metal could be easy to dissolve in water, or hard to dissolve or insoluble in water. The examples of the transition metal compounds include their oxide, hydroxide, chloride, nitrate, sulphate, phosphate and their organic compounds, etc. The preferred transition<br>
           metal compounds are selected from one or more of their chloride, nitrate, sulphate and phosphate.<br>
The transition metal additive of Group VIIIB is preferably introduced by adding transition metal compounds to the slurry in any step before spray-drying in the preparation process of the catalyst. It<br>
     also can be introduced after spray-drying through immersion or chemical adsorption of transition metal compounds and calcination process, including to immerse the catalyst with a aqueous solution of transition metal compounds or to treat it by chemical adsorption method, then to separate the solid and the liquid (if needed), and to<br>

1. Adding phosphorous compounds to the slurry before spray-drying process;<br>
	2.  Introduced into the catalyst by the inorganic oxide binder. For<br>
instance, when the inorganic oxide binder containing phosphorus-alumina sol, after the catalyst is calcined, P is introduced into the catalyst. The phosphorus-alumina sol could also be used as matrix and binder, so this part of P also belongs to the P additive supplied by this<br>
       invention.<br>
3. Introduced into the catalyst after spray-drying process through immersion or chemical adsorption of phosphorous compounds, solid-liquid separation (if needed), drying and calcination process. The drying temperature is from room temperature to 400 "C, preferred<br>

So the P additive may exist in any possible positions of the catalyst, such as the internal channel of the zeolite, the surface of the zeolite, in the matrix, or exist in the internal channel of the zeolite, the surface of<br>
      the zeolite and the matrix simultaneously.<br>
In the preparation method of the catalyst supplied by this invention, the phosphorous compounds are selected from one or more of the inorganic compounds and organic compounds of phosphorus. The phosphorous compounds could be easy to dissolve in water, or<br>
       hard to dissolve or insoluble in water. The examples of the phosphorous compounds include the oxide of phosphorus, phosphoric acid, phosphate, phosphite,_hypophosphite and organic compounds of<br>
9<br><br>
phosphorus. The preferred phosphorous compounds are selected from one or more of H3PO4, (NH4)3P04, (NH4)H2PO4, (NH4)2HPO4, AlPO4 and phosphorus-alumina sol.<br>
A method for cracking hydrocarbons using above catalysts is also  supplied in this invention, in which hydrocarbons are contacted with a mixture of catalysts mentioned above under cracking condition, and then the cracked products are collected.<br>
In the cracking method supplied by this invention, the contact of<br>
the hydrocarbons and the mixture of catalysts could be proceeded in<br>
    all kinds of reactors. The reactor could be a riser reactor, a fixed-bed<br>
reactor, a fluidized-bed reactor or a moving-bed reactor, preferably<br>
the reactor is the riser reactor.<br>
The contact conditions include a contact temperature of 400-650 TC, preferred 420-600 TC, and a catalyst-to-oil ratio (the weight ratio of  catalyst to hydrocarbon) of 1~25, preferred 3~20.<br>
As for a fixed-bed reactor, a fluidized-bed reactor or a moving-bed reactor, the contact condition also includes the weight hourly space velocity of 10~120h"!, preferred 15~80h"1. But for a riser reactor the contact condition further includes the reaction time of 0.5-15s,   preferably 0.5-10s.<br>
In the cracking method supplied by this invention, the mixture of catalysts containing the catalysts mentioned above are consisted mainly of a main cracking catalyst and the catalyst mentioned above and the content of them is well known for the technicians in the art. In  general, in the mixture of catalysts the content of the main cracking catalyst is 70-99wt%, preferred 80~95wt%, and the content of the catalyst supplied by this invention is l~30wt%, preferably 3~20wt%.<br>
In the catalyst mixture, the type and the composition of the main cracking catalyst is well known for the technicians in this area, which 30 may be all kinds of cracking catalysts, such as all kinds of cracking catalyst containing zeolite.<br>
In   the   cracking   method   supplied   by   this   invention,   the<br>
10<br><br>
hydrocarbons are selected from one or more of all kinds of petroleum cuts, such as crude oil, atmospheric residuum, vacuumed residuum, atmospheric gas oil, vacuumed gas oil, straight run gas oil, propane deasphalted oil, coking gas oil and liquefied products of coal. The  hydrocarbons may have heavy metal impurities such as Ni and V, and impurities of S and N, in which the content of S can reach 3.0wt%, the content of N can be up to 2.0wt%, the content of metal impurities such as V and Ni can be as high as 3000ppm.<br>
In the cracking method supplied by this invention, the mixture of<br>
    catalysts could be used onetime, but in a preferred situation the mixture of catalysts are regenerated and used cyclically. The regeneration of the catalyst mixture is a process that the coke in the catalyst mixture is calcined under oxygen atmosphere which in general is air, as is well known for the technicians in the art. For instance,<br>
      generally the regeneration temperature is 600~770 "C , preferred 650~7301C. When the contact procedure of the hydrocarbons and the catalyst mixture is proceeded on a fixed-bed reactor, a fluidized-bed reactor or a moving-bed reactor, the regeneration could be finished by piping   oxygen-containing   atmosphere   in   situ.   When   the   contact<br>
      procedure of the hydrocarbons and the catalyst mixture is proceeded on a riser reactor, the regeneration could be finished by using the existing reaction-regeneration system. The existing reaction-regeneration system and the regenerator of FCC are summarized at pages   282-338   in   «The   processing   technique   of  residuum»   (Li<br>
      Chunnian, Sinopec. Publishing company, 2002).<br>
The catalyst supplied by this invention by adding a proper content of the transition metal additive of Group VIIIB and the P additive, especially the samples using modified ZSM-5 zeolite as active component simultaneously, may increase the selectivity for propylene<br>
      in FCC process, and consequently increase the concentration of propylene in LPG of FCC dramatically. For instance, the content of propylene in the products is increased by 0.76~4.05% (Tables 3, 4, 5),<br>
11<br><br>
the concentration of propylene in LPG is increased to higher than<br>
35.70wt%.<br>
