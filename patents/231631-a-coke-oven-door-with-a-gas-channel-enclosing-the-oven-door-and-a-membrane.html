				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a coke door with a gas channel enclosing the oven door and a membrane.<br>
A door of this type is known from WO 01/30939 A2. The arrangement of the gas channel at the coke oven door creates a sealing system for the prevention of emissions and of air entering into the coke oven chamber which reliably prevents the emission of raw gas ftom the coke oven chamber as well as air entering ike coke oven chamber.<br>
It is important with regard to this gas channel that the door sealing strips or door sealing edges of the gas channel fit tightly all around the entire region.<br>
It is well known that the chamber frame suffers a deformation in the vertical direction, in the form of a sagging, due to temperature influences. Numerous suggestions have been made to adapt the sealing strips of coke oven doors to these deformations. All the solutions offered have the disadvantage that the spring deflection is inadequate to adjust to these deformations.<br>
For instance DB 41 03 504 C2 discloses a coke oven door where a membrane is forced against the chamber frame by means of springs. The- problem in this arrangement is that the membrane must have sufficient material strength to be able to take the contact force, i.e. the membrane must have high mechanical strength. It is essential for the membrane not to be damaged or destroyed during cleaning processes. On the other hand, the membrane must have a sufficient elasticity of bending. Until today, these two opposite<br>
requirements have not been fulfilled; where the membrane had sufficient mechanical strength, this was not matched by adequate spring deflection thus resulting in unsatisfactory sealing capabilities.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a coke oven door with a gas channel that sufestaafially encloses the oven door wherein the sealing strips have a spring deflection of such magnitude that they can adapt to any deformation occurring so that at any time a complete sealing is guaranteed. In addition, the sealing system shall also be suitable for retrofitting to existing coke oven doors even in situations where there is an obvious lack of space,<br>
Solutions to the tasks set are provMedrby the features of Claims 1 or 2.<br>
Further developments of the invention are detailed by the features of the subclaims.<br>
The invention is based on two essential ideas. On the one hand, the spring deflection<br>
providing the contact force for the gas channel is intended to be as great as possible and<br>
the contact force in the longitudinal direction as uniform as possible. On the other hand<br>
the springs are intended to act upon the gas channel in such a manner that the contact force<br>
at the outer door sealing strip is greater or at least equal to the contact pressure at the inner<br>
door sealing strip. The gas channel is sealed against the coke oven door by means of a<br>
membrane which, whilst having sufficient mechanical strength, has bending elasticity<br>
properties of an extent that allow it to adjust to any deformation, The gas channel must be<br>
designed to be of sufficient flexibility to allow that at each contact point about the same<br>
contact pressure of the outer door sealing strip is achieved.<br>
&gt;<br>
By virtueof the flexibility of the membrane, it is possible to achieve a great deflection in a restricted space. Due to this feature, existing coke oven doors which have extremely restricted space in the sealing region can be retrofitted whilst the available fastening options are employed.<br>
The design of the membrane in combination with the spring element and the resulting large spring deflection is in itself an invention, i.e. this embodiment can be applied to prior art sealing systems even without inclusion of the gas channel.<br>
Where for instance the geometric circumstances do not allow the inclusion of the gas channel, the sealing in accordance with the present invention can be employed in all known sealing systems of the prior art. The membrane with its great elasticity of bending also guarantees a better sealing result even in conventional sealing systems.<br>
The sealing in accordance with the invention allows evening up any deformations of the chamber frame and also of the coke oven door so that at any time a complete sealing effect is guaranteed. Where the gas channel is employed, the sealing system furthermore .has the advantages detailed in WO 01/30939 A2, i.e. a gas pressure equalisation between the gas*' channel and the coke oven chamber and as a consequence a reduction of the raw gas pressure prevalent at the outer sealing strip.<br>
In accordance with the invention the membrane consists of at least two layers. This embodiment offers the advantage that the elasticity of bending of the membrane is improved compared with a membrane which has a uniform total material thickness. Due to its elasticity, the membrane returns to its original position when the contact pressure applied by the spring element is reduced.<br>
The membrane in accordance with one embodiment of the invention ie layered in the manner of a sandwich comprising several materials. In this arrangement the membrane sheet arranged towards the gas channel can be of corrosion-resistant quality whilst the middle membrane sheet provides the spring action (for instance spring steel) and the upper sheet serves to increase the spring pressure.<br>
In accordance with a further embodiment, the membrane consists of two metal sheets. The two individual sheets have a higher elasticity than a single sheet having a thickness which corresponds to the combined thickness of the two sheets and upon deformation can be displaced relative to each other by the spring pressure.<br>
The membrane can also be designed as a composite system.   In the simplest version, the two sheets are interconnected with each other by means of webs or also by using different materials, such as plastic and/or adhesives. A further option is to utilise the tar obtained in the coking process for producing these composite designs.<br>
The individual sheets of the membrane can be of different material thickness. This allows the bending behaviour of the membrane to be varied across a wide range and to be adapted to individual requirements in an optimum manner.<br>
The individual sheets of the membrane can even be produced in a material thickness in the range of tenths of millimetres, in this embodiment, the membrane consists of many individual layers which can be displaced relative to each other. In this way, slide surfaces are created at the contact surfaces of the individual layers. The membrane thus becomes more flexible on the whole and has a greater elastic region. A greater spring deflection is therefore possible. This embodiment offers the advantage that any damage which may occur to the individual membrane sheets is automatically sealed off by virtue of the bonding effect of the condensates (tar),<br>
A further option is to produce the membrane sheet, which is intended to seal the doorway, from a heat-resistant and corrosion-resistant material and to design the other membrane sheets in such a manner that the adequate elasticity of bending of the membrane is guaranteed.<br>
In accordance with a further embodiment of the invention at least one sheet of the membrane is defined by a spring. This measure allows the membrane to contribute towards the contact pressure of the spring elements.<br>
The sheets forming the membrane can also be embodied as formed parts. In such arrangements, any known state of the art designs of springs or membrane sheets are feasible.<br>
It is obviously also possible to combine the individual membrane sheets comprising the aforementioned features.<br>
The membrane in accordance with the invention can be combined with any known state of the art spring elements. By virtue of its great elasticity of bending it adapts to any spring deflections specified.<br>
It is also possible to design the membrane as a spring element. This merely requires one or more sheets of the membrane to be designed as a spring.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment, the spring element consists of several superimposed leaf springs which are jointly fastened at the door panel above the membrane and press onto the gas channel. To allow the sealing edges to better adapt to the deformations, the leaf springs are configured in segments as individual springs.<br>
A further option is to arrange at the door panel a holding element to receive a ram which presses onto the gas channel. The ram can be forced against the gas channel for instance by means of disc springs, helical springs or by hydraulic/pneumatic means.<br>
A further option to exert a contact pressure onto the gas channel is to fasten a spring sheet in a spring-loaded manner at the door panel. In such an embodiment the spring sheet itself can also be in the form of a rigid element with minor elastic properties and the actual spring deflection can be caused mainly by the spring-loaded mount.<br>
The spring-loaded mount can be achieved for instance by means of disc springs which are firmly secured by a screw. A further option is to fasten a spring element at a spring rod.<br>
It is also possible to design one spring element in a manner such that it performs the spring function of the disc springs or the spring rod. This embodiment offers the advantage that only one single spring component must be manufactured which is capable of performing both spring functions.<br>
Such a configuration ensures that the gas channel is arranged in a spring system with a relatively large spring deflection. The spring deflection achieved is thus the result of the spring deflection of the spring element plus the spring deflection caused by the spring-loaded mount of the spring element.<br>
The membrane must be designed such that it can. follow this spring deflection. On the other hand, the membrane must also have a spring action of such magnitude that it rebounds to its original position. This obviously applies to all the spring components of the spring system.<br>
In accordance with the invention it is now possible for the first time to attach at the door frame a rigid "double seal"(gas channel) having a large spring deflection in which arrangement the contact pressure is the same over the entire length.<br>
By means of the spring systems described above it is possible to produce any desired contact pressure with any spatial distribution and any spring-load deflection curve, i.e. any desired varying or equal pressures can be proposed for the outer and the inner sealing strip of the gas channel, For instance, different leaf springs can be combined such that the spring action increases as the spring deflection increases. This can be preset by selecting leaf springs of different shapes or lengths or by allowing varying distances to the respective points of application of the spring.<br>
The same options are also available when using the otiier spring systems. When using systems comprising rams, attention must be paid to the requirement that the contact pressure is equalised by an associated pressure distribution strip. In such an arrangement,<br>
the pressure distribution strip must be designed to be flexible so that an adaptation of the gas channel to the irregularities of the chamber frame can still be achieved.<br>
By virtue of varying clamping arrangements, the springs can have any desired adjustable biasing.<br>
The springs can be arranged in a composite design. All known techniques may be utilised. Since the requirements relating to the composite design with regard to flexibility are the same for the membranes and the springs, the composite designs can be employed for the membranes as well as for the spring elements.<br>
The composite design may envisage the creation of channels between the individual elements of the springs or the membrane. The channels can be designed as cooling or heating channels into which a respective medium is introduced. It is also possible to equip the channels with an insulating material to produce an insulating layer.<br>
The gas channel must be designed such that it can adapt to the irregularities and deformations of the chamber frame. On the other hand, the gas channel must have a cross section of such magnitude that the raw gas can be drained off without a pressure build-up occurring. In any event, the gas channel is designed with an inner and an outer sealing strip. In the region of the door sealing edges, the gas channel must be as flexible as possible. This is for example achieved in that, in the region of the door sealing edge, the wall of the gas channel is of a lesser material thickness or by providing indentations or angular deflections and that the elasticity of bending in this region is thereby increased.<br>
It is also possible to mount a door sealing edge at the inner and outer sealing strip of the gas channel.<br>
The gas channel can also consist of correspondingly formed elements of the membrane or the springs (leaf springs),<br>
A particular problem with regard to the leak proofless of coke oven doors is presented by the corners of the door. In accordance with the invention it is proposed to produce the comer regions of the membrane as a one-piece construction, i.e. the individual layers of the membrane are integrally formed as one piece for the upper and the lower region, so that it results in a U shape. This U-shape is complemented by the membrane which seals the longitudinal sides of the coke oven door. This arrangement ensures the lasting leak proofhess of the membrane, because the seams are arranged outside the heavily loaded corner region.<br>
The individual membrane parts can be joined by welding. Due to the structure of the membrane consisting of individual layers, the membrane can be joined such that the individual layers and their seams are arranged in an offset manner. By virtue of the overlapping of the individual membrane layers in this region, a gas-proof result is obtained. To achieve that the membrane in this region of joints has the same material thickness, the individual membrane sheets must be arranged so as to abut. This can be accomplished in a variety of ways. The simplest example is to cut the membrane layers at right angles and arrange them so as to abut one another. Another option is to position the individual membrane sheets so as to be abutting diagonally. The edges of the individual membrane sheets can additionally be designed to be bevelled so that a sharpened abutting e4ge is created. By virtue of the diagonal design of the abutting edges the sealing edge length is increased, whilst by virtue of the bevel (sharp edge) of the membrane layers the sealing surface is increased.<br>
The layered configuration of the membrane in accordance with the invention even allows for the membrane to be joined in the corner region. In this embodiment, the individual membrane layers, in their overlapping regions, must alternately have their material thickness reduced such that the two overlapping layers together have the layer thickness of the individual layer. This can for instance be achieved by bevelling (sharpening) or also by respective milling (formation of steps).<br>
These joints are in addition sealed by the tar which is contained in the raw gas and settles in the cracks or small gaps in the event gas penetrates. In accordance with a further development, tar can be used in the production of the membrane as an adhesive or sealing agent to join the individual membrane layers.<br>
Where the membrane s designed with sheets in the range of tenths of a millimetre, the individual membrane layers can be arranged to overlap in the joint region without any further measures being undertaken. It is adequate to arrange the individual membrane sheets in the joint region in an offset manner.<br>
Since the profile of the gas channel bears upon the chamber frame and during any deformations occurring does not participate in the spring deflection, no stress or only minor stress will result in this region. The gas channel in the region of the door corners can be provided with a bevel. Since in this region the welds are subjected to only minor stress, any other type of connection can be selected. It is also possible to design the gas channel within the comer region as a plug-in connection. Such an option is illustrated in the drawing. The arrangement of plug-in connections can be provided at any location of the gas channel.<br>
The sealing system in accordance with the invention comprising membrane, gas channel and spring element is very well suited for retrofitting leaky coke oven doors. Any coke oven doors employed in the market can be retrofitted. Even in retrofitting situations the inventive membrane comprising the spring element can be used in conjunction with any known state of the art sealing systems.<br>
The aforementioned components as well as those claimed and described in the embodiment example and to be used in accordance with the invention do not have to fulfil any particular exceptional requirements as regards their shape and design, material selection and technical concept so that any selection criteria known in this field can find unrestricted use.<br>
Further details, features and advantages of the subject matter of the invention are detailed in the following description of the related drawing where - by way of example - preferred embodiments of the inventive coke oven doors are presented.<br>

Fig. 1 shows a partial view of a coke oven door 1 within the region of the gas channel 5 enclosing the oven door. A membrane 3 is fastened by means of a holding element 4 to the door panel 2 of the coke oven door 1. The holding element 4 has a bevel 4a. The membrane 3 consists of three superimposed sheets 3', 3 " and 3 "'. At the outer region of membrane 3 the gas channel 5 is arranged with an outer door sealing edge 5a and an inner door sealing edge 5b. The gas channel 5 has at the inner door sealing edge 5b a bevel 5c. Leaf springs 6, which are held by a holding element 7, are arranged at the holding element 4. The holding element 7 also has a bevel 7a,<br>
The leaf springs 6 press upon a strip 8 which is fastened at the membrane 3 within the region of the gas channel 5. The gag channel 5 is pressed against the chamber frame 9 of a coke oven chamber (not shown) by the leaf springs 6. By virtue of this arrangement, the gas channel 5 sealingly bears against the chamber frame 9. Movements caused by deformations of the chamber frame 9 and/or the coke oven door 1 are balanced by the leaf springs 6 in such a manner that the gas channel 5 is at all times forced against the chamber frame 9 in a sealing manner.    In this arrangement only a small resistance vis a vis the leaf springs 6 is produced by the flexible membrane 3. Due to the bevels 4a and 5c of the holding element 4 and the gas channel 5 respectively, the membrane 3 is capable of following the spring deflection predetermined by the leaf springs 6. The possible movements of the coke oven door 1 are designated by arrows A and B. The bevel 7a of the holding element 7 causes a greater leverage and thus a greater spring deflection of the leaf springs 6.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a different embodiment of the inventive sealing system. A mount 11 for a ram 10 is arranged at door panel 2 comprising membrane 3 and holding element 4. Disc spring columns 12 are provided at ram 10 which press ram 10 onto strip 8 serving as pressure distribution strip and thus onto membrane 3 and gas channel 5 and therewith force gas channel 5 against chamber frame 9. Disc springs 12 are biased by self-locking nuts 13.<br>
Fig. 3 shows that gas channel 5 is pressed against chamber frame 9 by means of a leaf spring 15. Leaf spring 15 is spring-loaded by means of disc spring columns 17 at a screw<br>
16 which is arranged at holding element 4. Due to this spring-loaded mount a larger spring deflection is possible for leaf spring 15.<br>
Fig. 4a shows a further embodiment of the inventive sealing system of coke oven door 1 with a spring element which is embodied as a spring component 20. Spring component 20, via strip 8 and membrane 3, presses upon gas channel 5 which thereby in turn is pressed against chamber frame 9. By clamping spring component 20 into a holding element 21 at different height levels - according to double arrow A - the spring deflection and the spring load deflection curve can be varied.<br>
Fig. 4b shows the same embodiment of the spring element. In addition, by means of screw 22 the biasing of spring component 20 is possible.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a membrane 25 in composite design. Membrane 25 consists of membrane sheets 26, 27, 28 and 29. The membrane sheets 27 and 28 are connected by webs 30. By means of webs 30, channels 31 are created in the space between membrane sheets 27 and 28. A medium can be introduced into channels 31 so that channels 31 are employed as cooling or heating channels. It is also possible to provide channels 31 and/or the space between membrane sheets 26 and 27 as well as 28 and 29 with insulating material so that membrane 25 or at least part of membrane 25 serves as an insulating layer.<br>
Fig, 6 shows a membrane 40 with membrane sheets 41 and 42. The membrane sheets 41 and 42 are bent at a right angle at their anterior end and, at their other end, they are securely clamped in such a way that the gas channel 5 is created between the two right-angle bends. In the lower region of the right angle bends, the membrane sheets 41 and 42 have angular bends 43.   By virtue of these angular bends 43, a sealing edge 43 'is created which seals gas channel 5 against chamber frame 9. Leaf springs 44, 45 and 46 press upon membrane 40. Leaf springs 44,45 and 46 are of different lengths. By employing this measure the spring force increases with increasing deflection.<br>
Fig. 7 shows gas channel 5 with an outer door sealing strip 50 and an inner door sealing strip 51, The inner door sealing strip 51 has a groove 52 at its lower end. Below groove 52, the inner door sealing strip 51 is provided with an incline 54 so that a door sealing edge 56 is created. The outer door sealing strip 50 correspondingly has at its lower end a groove 53 and an incline 55. The incline 55 extends beyond the wall thickness of door sealing strip 50. This arrangement causes a spring force F to press directly onto the door sealing edge 57 and thereby achieve a more flexible adjustment to the chamber frame 9.<br>
Fig, 8 shows that membrane 3 and leaf springs 6 are fastened on the door panel 2 by means of holding element 4. The lowermost leaf spring of leaf springs 6 has an angular bend at its non-clamped end and applies a punctiform or linear pressure onto membrane 3 and the outer door sealing strip of gas channel 5. The punctiform or linear contact pressure of leaf spring 6 can be selectively increased in that a wedge 60 is inserted between the individual leaf springs of leaf springs 6.<br>
Fig, 9 shows a corner region of gas channel 5. Gas channel 5 is connected by insertion of one part into the other in the direction of arrow A in the corner region. For this purpose the right-hand part of gas channel 5 is inserted into an opening 64 of the left-hand part of the gas channel 5. Unimpeded gas flow is possible through an opening 65 in the right-hand part of gas channel 5 into the corner region of gas channel 5. Where there is a true-to-size design, an additional joining of the two parte of gas channel 5 is obviated, since any leakiness of gas can be remedied by the tar. It is also possible to use tar or some other adhesive to join the two gas channel parts.<br>
Fig. 10 shows that a leaf spring 70 with a slide surface 71 presses upon strip 8 and therefore onto membrane 3 and gas channel 5. Where deformation of the coke oven door 1 and/or chamber frame 9 occurs in the direction of arrows A and B. the leaf spring 70 with its slide surface 71 is displaced along the edge of strip 8.<br>
The spring deflection is made up of the spring deflection of leaf spring 70 and the spring deflection which results due to compression of the angle formed by the slide surface 71 and leaf spring 70 as well as the slide path of strip 8 at the slide surface 71, The sum of<br>
these three spring deflections represents a large total spring deflection. At the inner door sealing strip 5b of gas channel 5 a gap 72 is provided. When a movement of coke oven door 1 in the direction of arrow B occurs, initially the outer door sealing strip 5a of gas channel 5 comes to bear against chamber frame 9. Upon further movement in this direction, the inner door sealing strip 5b of gas channel 5 comes to bear against the chamber frame and gap 72 is closed. In this way the already large spring deflection of this system is even more increased. When coke oven door 1 moves in the opposite direction in accordance with arrow A, the inner door sealing strip 5b of gas channel 5 lifts off from the chamber frame 9 whilst the outer door sealing strip 5a of gas channel 5 still provides a reliable sealing effect,<br>
