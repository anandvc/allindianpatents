CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims the benefit of U. S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/331,922, filed November 21, 2001.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(1) Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an antimicrobial, sporicidal composition<br>
especially useful in the treatment of bacterial and fungal spores. In particular, when the<br>
present composition is in contact with bacteria, fungi, yeast, and the like, its efficacy as<br>
an antimicrobial agent is excellent. More particularly, the composition of the present<br>
invention is especially surprising in that spores that remain in contact with the<br>
composition for a period of approximately 4 hours (at a 99% efficacy rate) become non-<br>
germinating. This makes the composition of the present invention especially useful for<br>
treating spores from such bacteria as anthrax. Solid materials treated with the<br>
composition are efficacious in killing and inhibiting the germination of such spores, and<br>
this is totally unexpected. Additionally, the present invention also relates to a method of<br>
making the composition, products made incorporating the composition, and methods of<br>
making products incorporating the composition.<br>
(2) Prior Art<br>
Antimicrobial agents are well known to those skilled in the art. Antimicrobial<br>
agents are generally compositions that are antibacterial, anti-fungal, or anti-yeast; that is,<br>
the growth of microorganisms is inhibited or the microorganisms are killed.<br>
Antimicrobial agents are applied to many different surfaces by two different<br>
mechanisms. The first mechanism is merely the topical treatment of a surface. For<br>
example, an operating table may be wiped with an antimicrobial agent to kill or<br>
substantially reduce the bacteria, fungus, mold, or yeast. Such compositions with<br>
antimicrobials are generally referred to as disinfectants.<br>
Another approach is to incorporate one or more types of antimicrobial agents into<br>
the composition of the material employed in making surfaces. For example, if the<br>
surface is made of plastic, the antimicrobial material may be incorporated into the<br>
plastic. This second mechanism is more efficient and longer lasting because the<br>
antimicrobial agent diffuses or migrates to the surface through the plastic such that the<br>
surface is continuously antimicrobial for years. This makes such surfaces as kitchen<br>
countertops, operating tables, hospital equipment, etc. especially attractive since the<br>
antimicrobial agent is continuously working to rid the surfaces of microbial agents.<br>
Antimicrobial agents can also be coated onto or absorbed into such applications as filter<br>
media, paint, leather (shoes), paper (envelopes and writing paper), textile applications,<br>
and bristle fibers (toothbrushes, hairbrushes, etc.).<br>
Typical antimicrobial agents are triclosan (2,4,4,'-trichloro-2'hydroxy diphenyl<br>
ether), zinc pyrithione, 2-phenylphenol, and quaternary ammonium products, all of<br>
which are well known in. the art.<br>
Spores are reproductive cells of fungi and some bacteria. Spores usually possess<br>
a thick cell wall enabling the cell to survive adverse conditions or environments.<br>
Common fungal spores are Aspergillus, Penicillium, Cladosporium, and Alternaria.<br>
Known bacteria spores are Bacillus anthracis (commonly known as Anthrax), and<br>
Clostridium difficile, among others.<br>
Sporicidal agents either kill spores or render them unable to regenerate or<br>
reproduce. Known sporicidals are chlorine dioxide, peracetic acid, gluteraldehydes, and<br>
hydrogen peroxide. Alcohols and bleach are known to kill spores as well. Such agents<br>
must usually be in close contact with the spores at high concentrations to be effective,<br>
and at effective concentrations such agents are toxic to humans. It would therefore be<br>
desirable to have a sporicidal composition that is less toxic at effective concentrations.<br>
Contamination by spores represents a particular problem in that buildings must<br>
be "fumigated" with liquid or gaseous sporicidal agents in order to ensure full<br>
eradication. Experience has been that even fumigation is not always effective. The<br>
problem is that spores may infiltrate throughout the building and its infrastructure. It<br>
would therefore be desirable to be able to treat components of the building and<br>
furnishings to impart a sporicidal property as a prophylactic against contamination. It<br>
would also be desirable to treat paper and especially envelope stock such that it is<br>
sporicidal. It would also be desirable to incorporate into air filters for homes, offices,<br>
cars or trucks, a sporicidal that eradicates spores and other microbials.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is both an antimicrobial composition as well as sporicidal,<br>
and is effective when used to pretreat surfaces. Not only is it effective against inhibiting<br>
the growth of microbes such as mold and bacteria, but also it is a sporicidal in the sense<br>
that spores contacting the composition or treated substrates are killed and germination is<br>
inhibited. As stated previously, spores are reproductive cells and rendering them<br>
incapable of reproducing in effect kills them.<br>
In order for the composition to be sporicidally effective, the spores must remain<br>
in contact with it for at least 2 hours to be 90 % effective and at least 4 hours to be 99 %<br>
effective (99% of the spores are killed or are unable to germinate) at room temperature.<br>
The composition of the present invention contains at least 2 components, namely<br>
an iodine containing compound and pyrithione, ranging from equal parts of each, to 1<br>
part iodine containing compound with up to seven parts pyrithione. Pyrithione may be in<br>
the form of sodium pyrithione, zinc pyrithione, copper pyrithione, or silver pyrithione.<br>
Pyrithione is a derivative of pyridinethione, namely 1-hydroxy-2-pyridinethione. The<br>
iodine-containing compound can be diidomethyl-4-tolylsulfone or iodopropynyl butyl<br>
carbamate.<br>
In the broadest sense, the present invention comprises an antimicrobial,<br>
sporicidal composition comprising an effective amount of a uniform blend of pyrithione<br>
and an iodine-containing compound. More specifically it is a blend of zinc pyrithione<br>
and diiodomethyl-4-tolylsulfone.<br>
In the broadest sense, the present invention also comprises a method of making<br>
an antimicrobial, sporicidal composition, comprising blending one part of an iodine-<br>
containing compound with from one to seven parts by weight pyrithione. More<br>
specifically, the method comprises blending one part of diiodomethyl-4-tolylsulfone<br>
with from one to seven parts by weight zinc pyrithione.<br>
The invention also comprises a treated product or substrate, treated with the<br>
sporicidal composition described above, such that it provides efficacy against bacterial<br>
and fungal spores. The invention also comprises the process of treating such substrates<br>
or products. Examples of such products are air filters, carpet, fabrics, wood furnishing,<br>
and duct work.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The composition of the present invention comprises at least 100 ppm (parts per<br>
million) diiodomethyl-4-tolylsulfone and pyrithione. The pyrithione is also present at a<br>
minimum of 100 ppm. Pyrithione may be in the form of sodium pyrithione, zinc<br>
pyrithione, copper pyrithione, or silver pyrithione, or a mixture thereof and can be<br>
purchased from Arch Chemical Co. Pyrithione is a derivative of pyridinethione, namely<br>
1-hydroxy-2-pyridinethione. Zinc pyrithione is 2-pyridinethiol-1-oxide, zinc complex.<br>
Copper pyrithione and silver pyrithione are a complex like zinc pyrithione, except that<br>
copper or silver replaces the zinc. Preferred is zinc pyrithione.<br>
While the components can be mixed together as solids, it is preferred to create a<br>
uniform dispersion. In particular, diiodomethyl-4-tolylsulfone is employed as a<br>
dispersion where about 20 - 60 % by weight of the dispersion is diiodomethyl-4-<br>
tolylsulfone, with the remainder being from about 1 - 3 % by weight surfactant, 2-8% by<br>
weight of a nonionic emulsifier etc Preferred is a 40 % by weight dispersion of<br>
diiodomethyl-4-tolylsulfone. Such a product is available from Dow and is sold under<br>
the trade name of Amical Flowable.<br>
Likewise, pyrithione is employed as a dispersion where about 20 - 60 % by<br>
weight of the dispersion is pyrithione, with the remainder being from about 1 - 3 % by<br>
weight surfactant, 2-8% by weight of a nonionic emulsifier. Preferred is a 40 % by<br>
weight dispersion of zinc omadine. Such a dispersion is sold by Arch Chemical as Zinc<br>
Omadine® ZOE dispersion.<br>
To manufacture the composition of the present invention, uniformly mix the<br>
diiodomethyl-4-tolylsulfone dispersion with the dispersion of zinc pyrithione, at room<br>
temperature and atmospheric pressure. The dispersions were mixed in a range from<br>
about 1 part diiodomethyl-4-tolylsulfone to 1 part zinc pyrithione to a ratio of 1 part<br>
diiodomethyl-4-tolylsulfone to 7 parts zinc pyrithione. Making a dispersion of<br>
diiodomethyl-4-tolylsulfone or a dispersion of zinc pyrithione is well known to those<br>
skilled in the art and employs conventional materials such as surfactants/thickeners and<br>
conventional equipment such as heaters &amp; mixers to create a homogeneous dispersion.<br>
The composition could be either as is, or more commonly would be diluted in water or<br>
other suitable medium such that the concentration of the pyrithione would be greater<br>
than or equal to 100 ppm, and the concentration of the diiodomethyl-4-tolylsulfone<br>
would be greater than or equal to 100 ppm.<br>
The dispersion of zinc pyrithione is approximately 38% by weight zinc<br>
pyrithione while the dispersion of the diiodomethyl-4-tolylsulfone comprises about 40%<br>
by weight of the diiodomethyl-4-tolylsulfone.<br>
The composition of the present invention is particularly useful when employed in<br>
a filter such that air borne spores and other microbials can be captured and retained<br>
against the filter mat. Filters useful in cars, trucks, airplanes, office HVAC units, etc. can<br>
filter the spores and retain them against the filter mat, where the composition of the<br>
present invention kills the mold and bacteria, and renders the spores incapable of<br>
germinating.<br>
A filter web can be made in the conventional manner of fabric comprising either<br>
woven or nonwoven fibers. The fibers may be natural or synthetic fibers, or a mixture of<br>
these. Natural fibers useful as filter media are cotton, hemp, wool, animal hair, kenaf or<br>
a mixture thereof. Acceptable synthetic fibers are nylon, polyester, rayon, acrylic,<br>
polyolefin fibers, or a mixture thereof. The preferred fibers are formed into a nonwoven<br>
batt by conventional dry laid processes. The nonwoven filter web must be bonded by<br>
mechanical, chemical or thermal processes to create a unitary structure. Mechanical<br>
bonding uses entanglements introduced by needle punching or hydroentangling.<br>
Chemical bonding uses adhesives such as latex resins, or hot melt adhesives. Thermal<br>
bonding utilizes low melt point fibers melted in an oven (hot air, radiant or microwave),<br>
on heated calender roll(s), or by ultrasonic energy.<br>
The preferred binder systems of the present invention are conventional latex<br>
systems, hot melt adhesives, or thermal bonding fibers, or a mixture of these.<br>
Conventional latex systems such as styrene-butadiene copolymer, acrylic/acrylate, vinyl-<br>
acetate-ethylenes, and polyvinyl acetate systems, as well as mixtures of these are well<br>
known. When a conventional latex system is employed with the present invention, the<br>
amount of binder may range from 3-50 % by weight of the web. Latex systems are<br>
usually sprayed on the fibers and heated to drive off the excess liquid carrier. Hot melt<br>
adhesives are generally solid powder materials, non-1atex paste, and/or liquid<br>
compositions well known to those in the art. When heated, the solid powder melts, coats<br>
at least a portion of the fibers, and is cooled to solidify. Thermal bonding comprises<br>
conventional low melt fibers, bicomponent fibers, or a mixture of these, which are<br>
melted as stated previously, and cooled to solidify the melt, thus bonding the blend of<br>
fibers. Conventional low melt fibers can be polyolefins, for example, and in particular<br>
linear low-density polyethylene.<br>
The composition of the present invention may, for example, be incorporated into<br>
the binder system for making the filter media. If mechanical bonding is employed for a<br>
woven or nonwoven fabric, then the dispersion described above is sprayed on the filter<br>
media and dried. For nonwoven filter media that is chemically or thermally bonded the<br>
composition may comprise part of the latex or hot melt adhesive. For the hot melt<br>
adhesive or low melt polymer bonding, the composition may be used in solid form, or<br>
more typically incorporated via a low melting polymer carrier. Lastly, the sporicidal<br>
composition can be incorporated into the plastic fibers that make the web of the filter.<br>
Such plastic fibers may be polyester, polyamide, or polyolefin based, for example.<br>
The composition may also be incorporated into paper during the paper making<br>
process, added to the last paper slurry before the paper is cast, or coated on the paper in<br>
the form of a latex, or with an aqueous or solvent based carrier, for example.<br>
Because the sporicidal composition is particularly compatible with latices, it can<br>
be incorporated into a great many products, like paint, nonwoven textile fabrics, hospital<br>
gloves, gowns and surgical drapes, and pads for absorbing bodily fluids, like incontinent<br>
pads, or surgical pads.<br>
Example 1<br>
A standard treated HEPA filter was created. The treated HEPA filter employed a<br>
latex binder to bind the fibers or filaments employed in the HEPA filter into a unitary<br>
mass. The treated HEPA filter employed latex that contained 1100 parts per million<br>
diiodomethyl-4-tolylsulfone and 1,455 parts per million zinc pyrithione. The latex<br>
binder was added to the fiberglass mat at a level of 110% of the total weight of the<br>
fibers. The resulting concentration of antimicrobials, based on the total weight of the<br>
filter media, was 1200 parts per million diiodomethyl-4-tolysulfone and 1600 parts per<br>
million of zinc pyrithione. The antimicrobials were added in the form of aqueous<br>
dispersions to the latex binder.<br>
The procedure used for testing the antibacterial activity of the treated product<br>
was AATCC (American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists) Test Method<br>
147-1993. The organisms tested were Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC #6538) and<br>
Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC #4352). The procedure employed to test the antifungal<br>
activity was AATCC Test Method 30-Part 3 using Aspergillus niger (ATCC #6275). In<br>
both of these tests the zone of inhibition, measured in millimeters, was measured after a<br>
predetermined period of time. In particular, bacteria or fungus at a predetermined<br>
concentration is placed in contact with the antimicrobial agent for a predetermined<br>
period of time and then the zone of inhibition is measured (the extended area about the<br>
bacteria or fungus).<br>
For the Test Method 147, zones of inhibition were obtained of 8 mm for S.<br>
aureus and 12 mm for K. pneumoniae. In the Test Method 30, part III, the treated<br>
samples was rated 0, meaning that no growth was observed on the sample, and in fact<br>
there was a zone of inhibition of 1 mm.<br>
Example 2<br>
A standard treated HEPA filter and an untreated HEPA filter were created as in<br>
Example 1. Both the treated and untreated HEPA filters employed a latex binder to bind<br>
the fibers or filaments employed in the HEPA filter into a unitary mass. The treated<br>
HEPA filter employed latex that contained 1100 parts per million diiodomethyl-4-<br>
tolylsulfone and 1,455 parts per million zinc pyrithione. The latex binder was added to<br>
the fiberglass mat at a level of 100% of the total weight of the fibers. The resulting<br>
concentration of antimicrobials, based on the total weight of the filter media, was 1200<br>
parts per million diiodomethyl-4-tolysulfone and 1600 parts per million of zinc<br>
pyrithione. The antimicrobials were added in the form of aqueous dispersions. The<br>
untreated HEPA filter controlled used the same latex binder, but without antimicrobials<br>
being added.<br>
The samples were tested using a modified AATCC Test Method 100 test. Test<br>
samples were cut into 1"x1" squares. The squares were inoculated with a 1.0 ml aliquot<br>
of Bacillus subtilis var niger spores (strain ATCC #9372) (varieties of Bacillus subtilis<br>
spores are recognized as surrogates for Bacillus anthracis) at a concentration of approx.<br>
10s spores/ml in soybean casein digest broth (SCDB). The inoculum remained in<br>
contact with the filter for a fixed contact time in a sterile Petri dish, and then the samples<br>
were placed in 100 ml of letheen broth for recovery of the surviving organisms. The<br>
contact times were 0, 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 hours, with three samples being done for each<br>
contact time, for both treated and untreated filter samples. The recovered organisms<br>
were plated onto sterile agar and cultured for approximately 24 hours to determine plate<br>
counts (colony forming units, CFU). The results are shown in Table I. In addition<br>
samples of the recovered inoculum were heat-shocked at 80-85°C for 20 minutes to force<br>
germination of surviving spores. Results are shown in Table 2.<br>
The treated HEPA filter inoculum showed a 90% reduction in the spores (90%<br>
were killed or were unable to germinate) after 2 hours and a 99% reduction after 4 hours.<br>
For the untreated HEPA filter, the spores showed no reduction after 2 hours and a slight<br>
increase in CFUs after 4 hours. Furthermore, after 48 hours, there was a 100-fold<br>
increase in the colony forming units on the untreated HEPA filter, demonstrating that a<br>
normal HEPA filter would actually support germination and growth of the bacterium.<br>
The purpose of heat shocking the recovered inoculum was to test whether or not<br>
the antimicrobials were affecting the spores, i.e. being sporicidal, or simply killing the<br>
bacteria after the spores had germinated. Heat shocking the recovered inoculum would<br>
kill living organisms while forcing germination of the spores. The fact that the pre-heat<br>
shock and post-heat shock results are nearly the same for the treated filter media<br>
demonstrates that the composition and the treated filter are sporicidal, rather than just<br>
antibacterial. The results for the untreated filter demonstrate that without the sporicidal<br>
treatment, the spores are germinating on the filter. The results for the treated sample vs.<br>
the untreated sample also demonstrate that even though the composition may not<br>
completely eradicate the viable spores in the given period of time, they are inhibiting<br>
germination of the spores, in itself a valuable property.<br>
Paper, suitable for use in mailing envelopes, was treated by coating with a thin<br>
layer containing the antimicrobial, sporicidal composition of the invention. The<br>
envelope stock was treated such that the 1600 parts per million of zinc pyrithione and<br>
1200 parts per million of diiodomethyl-4-tolylsulfone were applied, based on the total<br>
weight of the paper. The envelope stock was tested as in Example 2, with the exception<br>
that the organism used was the spore form of Bacillus subtilis var globigii (ATCC<br>
#51189). The results are as shown in Table 3.<br>
Within two hours viable spores had been reduced by 95%, and within 24 hours<br>
the viable spore count had been reduced by 99.8% or nearly 3 lag units. In contrast at 24<br>
hours the spores had begun to germinate and the bacteria propagate on the surface of the<br>
envelope stock.<br>
As in Example 2, recovered inoculum samples were heal-shocked to demonstrate<br>
that the effect was on the spores and not the vegetative form emerging from the spores<br>
The results are shown in Table 4.<br>
Thus it is apparent that there has been provided, in accordance with the<br>
invention, a product and a process for making that product that fully satisfies the objects,<br>
aims, and advantages set forth above. While the invention has been described in<br>
conjunction with the specific embodiments thereof, it is evident that many alternatives,<br>
modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the<br>
foregoing description. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all such alternatives,<br>
modifications, and variations as fall within the spirit and broad scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
