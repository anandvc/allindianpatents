Liver-X-Receptors (LXRs) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor<br>
superfamily. The LXRs are activated by endogenous oxysterols and regulate the<br>
transcription of genes controlling multiple metabolic pathways. Two subtypes,<br>
LXRalpha and LXRbeta, have been described (Willy et al., Genes Dev. 1995,<br>
9:1033-45; Song et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 1994, 91:10809-13). LXRbeta is<br>
ubiquitously expressed, while LXRalpha is predominantly expressed in cholesterol<br>
metabolizing tissues such as the liver, adipose, intestine and macrophage. The LXRs<br>
modulate a variety of physiological responses including regulation of cholesterol<br>
absorption, cholesterol elimination (bile acid synthesis), and transport of cholesterol<br>
from peripheral tissues via plasma lipoproteins to the liver. The LXRs are also<br>
involved in glucose metabolism, cholesterol metabolism in the brain, cell<br>
differentiation, and inflammation.<br>
At present, approximately half of all patients with coronary artery disease have<br>
low concentrations of plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The<br>
atheroprotective function of HDL was first highlighted almost 25 years ago and<br>
stimulated exploration of the genetic and environmental factors that influence HDL-C<br>
levels (Miller NE., Lipids 1978,13:914-9). The protective function of HDL derives<br>
from its role in a process termed reverse cholesterol transport. HDL mediates the<br>
removal of cholesterol from cells in peripheral tissues, including macrophage foam<br>
cells in the atherosclerotic lesions of the arterial wall. HDL delivers its cholesterol to<br>
the liver and sterol-metabolizing organs for conversion to bile and elimination in<br>
feces. Studies have shown that HDL-C levels are predictive of coronary artery<br>
disease risk independently of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels<br>
(Gordon et al., Am J Med. 1977, 62:707-14).<br>
At present, the estimated age-adjusted prevalence among Americans age 20<br>
and older who have HDL-C of less than 35 mg/dl is 16% (males) and 5.7 % (females).<br>
A substantial increase of HDL-C is currently achieved by treatment with niacin in<br>
various formulations. However, the substantial unfavorable side-effects limit the<br>
therapeutic potential of this approach.<br>
It has been observed that as many as 90% of the 14 million diagnosed type 2<br>
diabetic patients in the United States are overweight or obese, and a high proportion<br>
of type 2 diabetic patients have abnormal concentrations of lipoproteins. Studies have<br>
shown that the prevalence of total cholesterol  240 mg/dl is 37% in diabetic men and<br>
44% in women. The rates for LDL-C  160 mg/dl are 31% and 44%, and for HDL-C<br>
 35 mg/dl are 28% and 11%, in diabetic men and women respectively. Diabetes is a<br>
disease in which a patient's ability to control glucose levels in blood is decreased<br>
because of partial impairment in response to the action of insulin. Type II diabetes<br>
(T2D) is also called non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and has been<br>
shown to afflict 80-90 % of all diabetic patients in developed countries. In T2D, the<br>
pancreatic Islets of Langerhans continue to produce insulin. However, the target<br>
organs for insulin action, mainly muscle, liver and adipose tissue, exhibit a profound<br>
resistance to insulin stimulation. The body continues to compensate by producing<br>
unphysiologically high levels of insulin, which ultimately decreases in the later stages<br>
of the disease, due to exhaustion and failure of pancreatic insulin-producing capacity.<br>
Thus, T2D is a cardiovascular-metabolic syndrome associated with multiple comorbidities,<br>
including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, endothelial<br>
dysfunction and inflammatory atherosclerosis.<br>
The first line of treatment for dyslipidemia and diabetes at present generally<br>
involves a low-fat and low-glucose diet, exercise and weight loss. However,<br>
compliance can be moderate, and as the disease progresses, treatment of the various<br>
metabolic deficiencies becomes necessary with lipid-modulating agents such as<br>
statins and fibrates for dyslipidemia, and hypoglycemic drugs, e.g. sulfonylureas,<br>
metformin, or insulin sensitizers of the thiazolidinedione (TZD) .class of PPARyagonists,<br>
for insulin resistance. Recent studies provide evidence that modulators of<br>
LXRs would result in compounds with enhanced therapeutic potential, and as such,<br>
modulators of LXRs should improve the plasma lipid profile, and raise HDL-C levels<br>
(Lund et al., Arterioscler. Thromb. Vase. Biol. 2003, 23:1169-77). LXRs are also<br>
known to control the efflux of cholesterol from the macrophage foam cell of the<br>
atherosclerotic lesion, and agonists of LXRs have been shown to be atheroprotective<br>
(Joseph and Tontonoz, Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2003, 3:192-7). Thus, modulators of<br>
LXRs would be effective treatments for the atherosclerotic disease which underlies<br>
the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of stroke and heart disease. Recent<br>
observations also suggest that there is an independent LXR mediated effect on<br>
insulin-sensitization in addition to its role in atheroprotection (Cao et al., J Biol Chem.<br>
2003, 278:1131-6). Thus LXR modulators can also show superior therapeutic<br>
efficacy on HDL-raising and atheroprotection, with additional effects on diabetes,<br>
compared to current therapies.<br>
The novel compounds of the present invention have been found to bind to and<br>
selectively activate LXR alpha and LXR beta or coactivate LXR alpha and LXR beta.<br>
Consequently, cholesterol absorption is reduced, HDL cholesterol is increased, and<br>
inflammatory atherosclerosis is reduced. Since multiple facets of combined<br>
dyslipidemia and cholesterol homeostasis are addressed by LXR modulators, novel<br>
compounds of the present invention have an enhanced therapeutic potential compared<br>
to the compounds already known in the art. They can therefore ,be used in the<br>
treatment and prophylaxis of diseases which are modulated by LXR alpha and/or<br>
LXR beta agonists. Such diseases include increased lipid and cholesterol levels,<br>
particularly low HDL-cholesterol, high LDL-cholesterol, atherosclerotic diseases,<br>
diabetes, particularly non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome,<br>
dyslipidemia, Alzheimer's disease, sepsis, and inflammatory diseases such as colitis,<br>
pancreatitis, cholestasis/fibrosis of the liver, psoriasis and other inflammatory diseases<br>
of the skin, and diseases that have an inflammatory component such as Alzheimer's<br>
disease or impaired/improvable cognitive function. Moreover, the novel compounds<br>
of the present invention can be used for treatment and prophylaxis of age-related and<br>
inherited (e.g. Stargardt's disease) forms of macular degeneration.<br>
Other compounds that bind to and activate LXR alpha and LXR beta have<br>
previously been suggested (e.g.: WO 03/099769). However, there is still a need for<br>
new compounds with improved properties. The present invention provides the novel<br>
compounds of formula (I) which bind to LXR alpha and/or LXR beta. The<br>
compounds of the present invention unexpectedly exhibit improved pharmacological<br>
properties compared to the compounds known in the art, concerning e.g. metabolic<br>
stability, bioavailability and activity.<br>

other of R2 and R3 is hydrogen, lower-alkyl, or halogen, LG is a leaving group (such<br>
as I, Br, Cl, OTf, OMs, OTs) and A is hydrogen or a protecting group.<br>
The reaction of a compound of formula (II) with a compound HO-CHR -<br>
(CH2)m-(CHR5)n-R6 or with LG-CHR4-(CH2)m-(CHR5)n-R6 and cleavage of the<br>
protecting group A if necessary can be performed under reaction conditions well<br>
known to the person skilled in the art. Such reactions of a phenol (II) can conveniently<br>
be carried out either under Mitsunobu conditions with an alcohol HO-CHR4-(CH2)m-<br>
(CHR5)n-R6 in the presence of DEAD or DIAD and Ph3P in a solvent such as THF at a<br>
suitable temperature or with an alkylating agent LG-CHR4-(CH2)m-(CHR5)n-R6 with<br>
bases such as Cs2CO3, K2CO3 optionally in the presence of KI or Nal in inert solvents<br>
such as acetone, THF, DMF or DMA.<br>
The present invention also relates to compounds of formula (I) as defined<br>
above, when prepared by a process as described above.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can be prepared by methods known in the art or<br>
as described below. Unless otherwise indicated, the substituents R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6,<br>
R7, m, and n are as described above.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The preparation of starting materials for the synthesis of compounds of formula (I) is<br>
illustrated in schemes la/lb. Bromophenol derivatives la or Ib are transformed into the<br>
suitably protected derivatives 2a or 2b by treatment with e.g. silylating agents such as t-<br>
BuMe2SiCl or /-BuPh2SiCl in solvents such as DMF, or THF in the presence of a base<br>
such as imidazole or triethylamine at temperatures between 0°C and room temperature<br>
(step a). 2a or 2b may be converted to the derivatives 3a or 3b by treatment with «-BuLi<br>
or r-BuLi in solvents such as THF or ether, followed by reaction with hexafluoro acetone<br>
at low temperature, e.g. -78°C (step b). The compounds 3a or 3b may be O-protected by a<br>
Mitsunobu reaction with reagents such as benzyl alcohol or 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol<br>
(PMB-OH) in THF in the presence of triphenylphosphine and DEAD or DIAD to give 4a<br>
or 4b, respectively (step c). Cleavage of the protecting group PG1 may be achieved by<br>
treatment of the compound 3a, 3b, 4a or 4b with TBAF in THF or 48% aq. HBr, KF in<br>
DMF to yield the desired building blocks 5a, 5b, 6a or 6b , respectively (step d).<br>
Schemes 2a/2b depict the synthesis of the final products. Treatment of phenol 5a or 5b<br>
with R2'-X or R3'-X (with R2' or R3' = CHR4-(CH2)m-(CHR5)n-R6) under Mitsunobu<br>
conditions for X = OH with e.g. Ph^P, DEAD or DIAD in a solvent such as THF gives 7a<br>
or 7b (step a). Alternatively, 5a or 5b may be treated with alkylating agents R2 -X or R3 -<br>
X in which X is a leaving group such as Cl, Br, I, MsO, TsO, or TfO. These reactions are<br>
performed in the presence of a base such as Cs2CO3 or K2COs in inert solvents such as<br>
acetone, dioxane, DMF or DMA optionally in the presence of KI or Nal to give 7a or 7b<br>
(step b). Cleavage of the protecting group PG2 may be accomplished by hydrogenation in<br>
the presence of a catalyst such as Pd/C in a solvent such as EtOAc or alcohols (EtOH,<br>
MeOH) for PG2 = Bn or PMB. An alternative method for cleavage of the PMB group may<br>
be the treatment of 7a or 7b with DDQ in CH2C12 or dichloroethane in the presence of<br>
H2O at temperatures between -20°C and reflux or the treatment with eerie ammonium<br>
nitrate in acetonitrile/ water to give 8a (step c). In some cases the direct'conversion of 6a<br>
or 6b (A=H) to 8a or 8b respectively, may be achieved under Mitsunobu conditions with<br>
the alcohols R2'-X or R3'-X.<br>
Alternatively, the final product may be assembled in several steps. Treatment of the<br>
phenol 5a or 5b with Y-CHR4-(CH2)m-(CHR5)n-OH (Y = leaving group such as e.g. Cl,<br>
Br, I, MsO, TsO, or TfO) in the presence of bases such as Cs2CO3 or K2CO3 in inert<br>
solvents such as acetone, dioxane, DMF or DMA optionally in the presence of KI or Nal<br>
gives alcohol 9a or 9b (step d). 9a or 9b can be converted to lOa or lOb by reaction with<br>
aryl or heteroaryl derivative R7-OH using Mitsunobu conditions (PhsP, DEAD or DIAD)<br>
in a solvent such as THF (step e). Alternatively, the alcohol 9a or 9b can be subjected to a<br>
nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction with R7-Z wherein Z is a leaving group such as<br>
F, Br or I or to a transition metal catalysed coupling reaction with R7-Z wherein Z is Cl,<br>
Br, I or OTf (step f). Deprotection to the final product lla or lib may be accomplished<br>
as described above by hydrogenation (for PG2 = Bn or PMB) or by oxidative cleavage (for<br>
PG2 = PMB) with DDQ in CH2C12 or dichloromethane, dichloroethane and water at<br>
temperatures between -20°C and reflux or with eerie ammonium nitrate in acetonitrile and<br>
water (step c).<br>
Another procedure consists of the treatment of 5a or 5b with an ester of the formula XCHR4-(<br>
CH2)m-CO2-B under Mitsunobu conditions for X = OH with Ph3P, DEAD or<br>
DIAD in a solvent such as THF to give 12a or 12b (step g). Alternatively, 5a or 5b may<br>
be treated with X-CHR4-(CH2)m-CO2-B under alkylating conditions for X = leaving group<br>
such as e.g. Cl, Br, I, MsO, TsO, or TfO with bases such as Cs2CC&gt;3 or K2CO3 in acetone,<br>
dioxane, DMF or DMA in the presence of KI or Nal to give 12a or 12b (step h).<br>
Reduction of the ester 12a or 12b with sodium borohydride in a solvent such as THF,<br>
methanol or ethanol or mixtures thereof yields 9a or 9b (for R5 = H, step i). Alternatively,<br>
the ester may be converted to derivative 9a or 9b (for R5 * H, step j) in two or three steps.<br>
Reduction of the ester to an aldehyde can be accomplished directly by e.g. DIBAH or by a<br>
reduction to the alcohol by e.g. LiAlH4 and subsequent reoxidation to the aldehyde. The<br>
reaction of the aldehyde with a Grignard reagent R5-MgBr or R5-MgCl or organolithium<br>
reagent R5-Li gives derivative 9a or 9b (for R5 * H, step j). 9a may be converted to lOa<br>
and lla as described above (steps e,c or f,c).<br>
If 5a or 5b is treated with a R4 substituted oxirane in a solvent such as dioxane, DMF or<br>
DMA in the presence of bases such as Cs2CO3 or K2CC&gt;3 under microwave conditions<br>
(step k) alcohol 13a or 13b can be isolated. These alcohols 13a or 13b can be converted to<br>
lOa or lOb and lla or lib (with m=0 and R5=H) respectively, using the reaction<br>
conditions described previously for steps e and c or f and c.<br>
A large number of compounds X-(CHR4)(CH2)m(CHR5)nR6, in which R4 to R6, m, n, and<br>
X are defined as above, are commercially available. If not, they may be prepared from a<br>
related commercially available starting material such as e.g. an alcohol HO-(CHR4)-<br>
(CH2)m(CHR5)nR6, an ester alkylOOC-(CH2)m-(CHR5)nR6, or a carboxylic acid HOOC-<br>
(CH2)m-(CHR5)nR6 according to standard literature procedures commonly known to those<br>
skilled in the art. R4 substituted oxiranes may be prepared by treatment of R4CH=CH2<br>
with a commonly used epoxidizing agent such as w-CPBA. Many of the X-<br>
(CHR4)(CH2)m(CHR5)nR6 wherein R4, R5 = H, and R6 = heteroaryl may be prepared<br>
according to literature procedures (e.g. Binggeli et al. WO2004031162, WO200292084<br>
and WO97019311, Boehringer et al. WO2003037327, Bouillot et al. WO2004006922;<br>
Morita et al., JP9095482; Cynkowski et al., J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun., 1995, 2335-<br>
2336; Kodama et al., US6472386; Paul et al., Heterocycles, 2001, 55 (4), 689 - 704,<br>
Ackermann et al. WO200236584, Adams et al. WO9728137).<br>
After preparation of derivatives 7a,7b or 10a,10b according to the synthetic descriptions<br>
above, functional groups present in R6 or R7 may be converted further prior to cleavage of<br>
the protecting group A. Examples for typical transformations of such functional groups are<br>
summarized below:<br>
Ester moieties may be hydrolysed to the corresponding acids by treatment with LiOH,<br>
NaOH or KOH in solvents such as THF, methanol or ethanol. The resulting acids may be<br>
converted to amides by treatment with an amine NHRaRb in the presence of a coupling<br>
reagent such as N,N-dicylohexylcarbo-diimide (DCC), N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-<br>
ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI) or O-(l,2-dihydro-2-oxo-l-pyridyl)-N,N,N,Ntetra-<br>
methyluronium-tetrafluorborate (TPTU) and 1-hydroxybenzo-triazole (HOBT) and a<br>
base such as Huenigs base, EtsN or NMM (N-methylmorpholine) in a solvent such as<br>
THF, ether or dichloromethane. Reduction of the esters with reducing agents such as<br>
NaBH4, LiAlH4 in solvents such as MeOH or THF may give the corresponding<br>
hydroxyalkyl residues. Alternatively, the conversions may be carried out with the<br>
unprotected derivatives 8a, 8b, lla or lib, respectively.<br>
Prior to the derivatizations of the functional group on R6or R7, sensitive functional groups<br>
may be suitably protected (e.g. silylation of a hydroxy group) and deprotected again when<br>
desired or required (as described e.g. in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" by T.W.<br>
Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, 2nd Ed., 1991, Wiley N.Y.).<br>
The conversion of a compound of formula (I) into a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salt can be carried out by treatment of such a compound with an inorganic acid, for<br>
example a hydrohalic acid, such as, for example, hydrochloric acid or hydrobromic acid,<br>
or other inorganic acids such as sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid etc., or with an<br>
organic acid, such as, for example, acetic acid, citric acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid,<br>
tartaric acid, methanesulfonic acid or p-toluenesulfonic acid. The corresponding<br>
carboxylate salts can also be prepared from the compounds of formula (I) by treatment<br>
with physiologically compatible bases.<br>
The conversion of compounds of formula (I) into pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
esters can be carried out e.g. by treatment of suited amino or hydroxy groups present in the<br>
molecules with an carboxylic acid such as acetic acid, with a condensating reagent such as<br>
benzotriazol-l-yloxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP), N,N-<br>
dicylohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide<br>
hydrochloride (EDCI) or O-(l,2-dihydro-2-oxo-l-pyridyl)-N,N,N,N-tetra-methyluroniumtetrafluorborate<br>
(TPTU) to produce the carboxylic ester or carboxylic amide.<br>
Insofar as their preparation is not described in the examples, the compounds of<br>
formula (I) as well as all intermediate products can be prepared according to analogous<br>
methods or according to the methods set forth above. Starting materials are commercially<br>
available or known in the art.<br>
As described above, the novel compounds of the present invention have been found to<br>
bind to and selectively activate LXR alpha and LXR beta or coactivate LXR alpha and<br>

cognitive function. Moreover, the novel compounds of the present invention can be used<br>
for treatment and prophylaxis of age-related and inherited (e.g. Stargardt's disease) forms<br>
of macular degeneration.<br>
The invention therefore also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a<br>

In another preferred embodiment, the invention relates to a method for the<br>
therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of diseases which are modulated by LXR alpha<br>
and/or LXR beta agonists, particularly for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of<br>
increased lipid levels, increased cholesterol levels, low HDL-cholesterol, high LDLcholesterol,<br>

pancreatitis, cholestasis of the liver, fibrosis of the liver, macular degeneration and/or<br>
Alzheimer's disease, which method comprises administering a compound as defined<br>
above to a human being or animal.<br>
The invention also embraces the use of compounds as defined above for the<br>
therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of diseases which are modulated by LXR alpha<br>
and/or LXR beta agonists, particularly for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of<br>
increased lipid levels, increased cholesterol levels, low HDL-cholesterol, high LDLcholesterol,<br>

metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, sepsis, inflammatory diseases, skin diseases, colitis,<br>
pancreatitis, cholestasis of the liver, fibrosis of the liver, macular degeneration and/or<br>
Alzheimer's disease.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of compounds as described above for the<br>
preparation of medicaments for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of diseases<br>
which are modulated by LXR alpha and/or LXR beta agonists, particularly for the<br>
therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of increased lipid levels, increased cholesterol<br>
levels, low HDL-cholesterol, high LDL-cholesterol, atherosclerotic diseases, diabetes,<br>

inflammatory diseases, skin diseases, colitis, pancreatitis, cholestasis of the liver, fibrosis<br>
of the liver, macular degeneration and/or Alzheimer's disease. Such medicaments<br>
comprise a compound as described above.<br>
Prevention and/or treatment of increased lipid levels, increased cholesterol levels,<br>
atherosclerotic diseases, dyslipidemia, or diabetes is the preferred indication, particularly<br>
prevention and/or treatment of increased lipid levels, increased cholesterol levels,<br>
atherosclerotic diseases, or dyslipidemia, especially prevention and/or treatment of<br>
atherosclerotic diseases or dyslipidemia.<br>
The following tests were carried out in order to determine the activity of the<br>
compounds of the present invention. Background information on the performed assays can<br>
be found in: Nichols JS et al. "Development of a scintillation proximity assay for<br>
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ligand binding domain", Anal<br>
Biochem. 1998,257: 112-119.<br>
Mammalian expression vectors were constructed to express full-length human<br>
LXR alpha and LXR beta. Bacterial expression vectors were constructed to produce<br>
glutathione-s-transferase (GST) fused to the ligand binding domains (LBD) of human<br>
LXR alpha (aa 164 to 447) and human LXR beta (aa 155 to 460). To accomplish this, the<br>
portions of the sequences encoding the LBDs were amplified from full-length clones by<br>
PCR and then subcloned into the plasmid vectors. Final clones were verified by DNA<br>
sequence analysis (Willy et al., Genes Dev. 1995, 9:1033-45; Song et al., Proc Natl Acad<br>
SciUSA.1994, 91:10809-13).<br>
Induction, expression, and purification of GST-LBD fusion proteins were performed<br>
in E. coli strain BL21(pLysS) cells by standard methods (Ref: Current Protocols in<br>
Molecular Biology, Wiley Press, edited by Ausubel et al).<br>
Radioligand Binding Assay<br>
LXR alpha and LXR beta receptor binding were assayed in buffer consisting of 50<br>
mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2. For each 96-well reaction, 500 ng of<br>
GST-LXR alpha-LBD or 700 ng of GST-LXR beta-LBD fusion proteins were bound to 80<br>
Hg or 40 u.g SPA beads (Pharmacia Amersham) respectively, in a final volume of 50 |il by<br>
shaking. The resulting slurry was incubated for 1 h at RT and centrifuged for 2 min at<br>
1300 X g. The supernatant containing unbound protein was removed, and the semi-dry<br>
pellet containing the receptor-coated beads was re-suspended in 50 p.1 of buffer.<br>
Radioligand (eg. 100,000 dpm of (A^-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-A^-[4-(2,2,2-trifluoro-lhydroxy-<br>
l-trifluoromethylethyl)-phenyl]-benzenesulfonamide)) was added, and the<br>
reaction incubated at RT for 1 h in the presence of test compounds, and then scintillation<br>
proximity counting was performed. All binding assays were performed in 96-well plates<br>
and the amount of bound ligand was measured on a Packard TopCount using OptiPlates<br>
(Packard). Dose response curves were measured within a range of concentration from 10"'°<br>
MtolO'4M.<br>
Luciferase Transcriptional Reporter Gene Assays<br>
Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK21 ATCC CCL10) were grown in DMEM medium<br>
containing 10% FBS at 37°C in a 95%O2:5%CO2 atmosphere. Cells were seeded in 6-well<br>
plates at a density of 105 Cells/well and then batch-transfected with either the full-length-<br>
LXR alpha or full-length-LXR beta expression plasmids plus a reporter plasmid<br>
expressing luceriferase under the control of LXR response elements . Transfection was<br>
accomplished with the Fugene 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the<br>
suggested protocol. Six hours following transfection, the cells were harvested by<br>
trypsinization and seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 104 cells/well. After 24 hours to<br>
allow attachment of cells, the medium was removed and replaced with 100 jal of phenol<br>
red-free medium containing the test substances or control ligands. (final DMSO<br>
concentration: 0.1%). Following incubation of the cells for 24 hours with substances, 50 |il<br>
of the supernatant was discarded and then 50 jal of Luciferase Constant-Light Reagent<br>
(Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to lyse the cells and initiate the luciferase<br>
reaction. Luminescence, as a measure of luciferase activity, was detected in a Packard<br>
TopCount. Transcriptional activation in the presence of a test substance was expressed as<br>
fold-change in luminescence compared to that of cells incubated in the absence of the<br>
substance. EC$o values were calculated using the XLfit program (ID Business Solutions<br>
Ltd. UK).<br>
The compounds according to formula (I) have an activity in at least one of the above<br>
assays (EC50 or IC50) of 1 nM to 100 pM, preferably 1 nM to 10 ^M, more preferably 1<br>
nM to 1<br>
For example, the following compounds showed the following IC50 values in the binding<br>
assay:<br>
LXRalpha Binding LXRbeta' Binding<br>
XamP C IC50 [umol/1] IC50 [^imol/1]<br>
11 0.093 0.014<br>
13 0.237 0.236<br>
57 0.033 0.0227<br>
These results have been obtained by using the foregoing test.<br>
The compounds of formula I and/or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be<br>
used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations for enteral,<br>
parenteral or topical administration. They can be administered, for example, perorally, e.g.<br>
in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions,<br>
emulsions or suspensions, rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in<br>
the form of injection solutions or suspensions or infusion solutions, or topically, e.g. in the<br>
form of ointments, creams or oils. Oral administration is preferred.<br>
The production of the pharmaceutical preparations can be effected in a manner<br>
which will be familiar to any person skilled in the art by bringing the described<br>
compounds of formula I and/or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, optionally in<br>
combination with other therapeutically valuable substances, into a galenical administration<br>
form together with suitable, non-toxic, inert, therapeutically compatible solid or liquid<br>
carrier materials and, if desired, usual pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
Suitable carrier materials are not only inorganic carrier materials, but also organic<br>
carrier materials. Thus, for example, lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic<br>
acid or its salts can be used as carrier materials for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard<br>
gelatine capsules. Suitable carrier materials for soft gelatine capsules are, for example,<br>
vegetable oils, waxes, fats and semi-solid and liquid polyols (depending on the nature of<br>
the active ingredient no carriers might, however, be required in the case of soft gelatine<br>
capsules). Suitable carrier materials for the production of solutions and syrups are, for<br>
example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar and the like. Suitable carrier materials for<br>
injection solutions are, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol and vegetable oils.<br>
Suitable carrier materials for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils,<br>
waxes, fats and semi-liquid or liquid polyols. Suitable carrier materials for topical<br>
preparations are glycerides, semi-synthetic and synthetic glycerides, hydrogenated oils,<br>
liquid waxes, liquid paraffins, liquid fatty alcohols, sterols, polyethylene glycols and<br>
cellulose derivatives.<br>
Usual stabilizers, preservatives, wetting and emulsifying agents, consistencyimproving<br>
agents, flavour-improving agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffer<br>
substances, solubilizers, colorants and masking agents and antioxidants come into<br>
consideration as pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
The dosage of the compounds of formula I can vary within wide limits depending<br>
on the disease to be controlled, the age and the individual condition of the patient and the<br>
mode of administration, and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in<br>
each particular case. For adult patients a daily dosage of about 1 to 1000 mg, especially<br>
about 1 to 300 mg, comes into consideration. Depending on severity of the disease and the<br>
precise pharmacokinetic profile the compound could be administered with one or several<br>
daily dosage units, e.g. in 1 to 3 dosage units.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations conveniently contain about 1-500 mg, preferably<br>
1-100 mg, of a compound of formula I.<br>

Example 1<br>
4-[2,2,2-Trifluoro-l-(4-methoxy-benzyloxy)-l-trifluoromethyI-ethyl]-phenol<br>
1.1<br>
At 0°C, to 10 g (57.81 mmol) of 4-bromo-phenol in 100 ml of DMF were added 4.33 g<br>
(63.6 mmol) of imidazole and 9.58 g (63.6 mmol) of TBDMSC1 in 30 ml of DMF. The<br>
mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. A saturated solution of NaHCCh was<br>
added, and the product was extracted with diethyl ether (3x). The organic phase was<br>
washed with water and brine, and dried (Na2SO4). After filtration and evaporation of the<br>
solvent 16.57 g (99%) of (4-bromo-phenoxy)-tert-butyl-dimethyl-silane were isolated as a<br>
colorless liquid, MS: 286 (M, lBr)+.<br>
1.2<br>
At -78 °C, a solution of 16.57 g (57.7 mmol) of (4-bromo-phenoxy)-fert-butyl-dimethylsilane<br>
in 140 ml of THF was treated with 43.6 ml (69.8 mmol) of «-BuLi (ca 1.6 M in<br>
hexane). After 30 min at this temperature hexafluoroacetone was bubbled into the solution<br>
(very exothermic reaction). Stirring was continued for additional 30 min at -78°C, and a<br>
solution of NH4C1 was added to the mixture. The phases were separated and the product<br>
was extracted with EtOAc (3x). The combined organic phases were washed with brine,<br>
dried (NaaSC^), filtered and evaporated. Purification by flash-chromatography on silica<br>
gel («-heptane/EtOAc 97:3 to 9:1) gave 8.5 g (40%) of 2-[4-(teA7-butyl-dimethylsilanyloxy)-<br>
phenyl]-l,l,l,3,3,3-hexafiuoro-propan-2-ol as a yellow liquid, MS: 374 (M)+.<br>
1.3<br>
To a solution of 4.1 g (29.6 mmol) of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol in 100 mL of THF was<br>
added 7.76 g (29.6 mmol) of triphenylphosphine and 8.53 g (22.8 mmol) of 2-[4-(tertbutyl-<br>
dimethyl-silanyloxy)-phenyl]-l, 1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-propan-2-ol at room<br>
