AY-ZEOLITE-CONTAINING COMPOSITE MATERIAL AND A PROCESS FOR PREPARING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a Y-zeolite-containing composite material made from raw materials comprising kaolin by in-situ crystallization and a process for preparing the same.<br>
Background Arts<br>
Study on the synthesis of zeolite with kaolin as a raw material has been going on since USP 3,119,659 disclosed such a process in 1964. Early work mainly focused on the synthesis of pure zeolite, e.g. US 3,574,538 disclosed a process for synthesizing Y-zeolite from kaolin, which comprised calcining kaolin to form amorphous metakaolin, adding a certain amount of sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide to make the mole ratio of silica/alumina approach that of the zeolite to be synthesized, then adding 0.1-10% by weight of guide agent, and conducting crystallization at 60-110°C to yield highly pure Y-zeolite with a silica/alumina ratio of 4.5-5.95 by mole.<br>
EP 0209332A2 discloses a process for crystallizing kaolin raw material to prepare Y-zeolite under stirring, which comprises calcining kaolin at 550-925°C to yield metakaolin, then adding sodium compound and water, adjusting silica to alumina ratio to 2.1-15:1 by mole and water to sodium oxide ratio to 15-70:1 by mole, crystallizing the reactant to form Y-zeolite under stirring, optionally adding a guide agent to the feed. The synthesized Y-zeolite is dispersive powder with an average diameter of 3 μm and a NaY purity of 97%.<br>
Y-zeolite is prepared from kaolin (Gao Dawei et al, Petroleum Refining, 1983 (7): 12-16) by calcining kaolin at a relatively low temperature, e.g. 640-660°C, into metakaolin, then adding sodium hydroxide, a guide agent, and water glass, aging at 50-60°C for 1<br><br>
hour, and crystallizing at 98-100°C for 2-24 hours. After drying, NaY zeolite with a crystallinity of higher than 80% and a silica/alumina ratio of higher than 4.5 by mole is obtained. This zeolite exhibits high hydrothermal stability after exchanging with rare-earths.<br>
CN 1334142A calcines a part of kaolin raw material at 940-1000°C into spinel-containing kaolin and calcines another part at 700-900°C into metakaolin, and then mixes the two parts of calcined kaolin in a certain ratio, followed by adding sodium silicate, guide agent, sodium hydroxide, and water, crystallizes at 90-95°C for 16-36 hours, yielding a molecular sieve containing 40-90% of NaY after drying. The temperature for calcining kaolin in preparing the molecular sieve in this process exceeds 700°C, the energy consumption is high and the obtained molecular sieve is not a nanometer level product.<br>
Since Y-zeolite is an active component of fluidized bed catalytic cracking catalyst, researchers expected to directly make kaolin into microsphere, and then into Y-zeolite by in-situ crystallization. USP 4,493,902 discloses a microsphere zeolite containing at least 40% of NaY by calcining fine kaolin particle, mixing with kaolin to form a slurry, spray drying to form microsphere, calcining again to convert kaolin to metakaolin, adding the raw material for synthesizing zeolite and the guide agent, and crystallizing under stirring and heating. This zeolite may contain spinel obtained by calcining kaolin at high temperatures and the presence of spinel provide a stable "framework" for the growth of zeolite. Therefore, a zeolite with high activity, selectivity, hydrothermal stability, wear resistance, and high anti-metal ability can be obtained.<br>
CN 1334318A discloses a zeolite having a lower content of NaY, only 25-35%, and having a mole ratio of silica/alumina of 4.0-5.5 obtained by mixing kaolin and a binder, spray drying the mixture to form microspheres having a diameter of 20-111 urn, calcining  a  part of microspheres at 940-1000°C and calcining<br><br>
another part at 700-900°C into metakaolin, mixing the kaolin calcined at 940-1000°C and metakaolin, adding sodium silicate, guide agent, sodium hydroxide and water, crystallizing at 98-100°C for 16-36 hours.<br>
In recent years, the variation in the structure of petrochemical industry products and price of crude oil requires the development of the petroleum refining industry towards the direction of deep processing, and the technology for catalytic cracking of heavy oils has become an important path to increase the economic benefit. The crystal size of conventional Y-zeolite is generally in a range of 0.8-1.2 \xm, which cannot allow large molecules of resid with diameters greater than 1.0 nm to enter the pore of zeolite with diameters of only about 0.8 nm, and these molecules can enter the pore merely after adsorbing on the outer surface of the zeolite and cracking into smaller molecules. Therefore, the magnitude of the outer surface area of the zeolite becomes an important factor affecting the cracking of large molecules of resid, but the increase of the surface area of zeolite means preparing zeolite with small crystal. Therefore, preparing Y-zeolite with small crystal to enhance the diffusion rate within crystal has gradually become a hotpot of research.<br>
Rajagopal ( Appl. Catal. 1986, 23:69 ) uses a microsphere catalyst made from synthesized zeolite with a crystal size of 60 nm to crack crude oil, and the result shows that zeolite with small crystal size produces more gasoline and light diesel oil, and less dry gas and coke deposit. However, smaller zeolite crystal size may result in poorer hydrothermal stability, more difficulty in filtering, higher surface energy and thereby a stronger tendency for the crystal to aggregate. Thus, the shortcoming of the gelling method in synthesizing NaY with smaller crystal size has become the greatest obstacle to its industrialized application.<br>
Disclosure of the invention<br><br>
The objective of the present invention is to provide a Y-zeolite-containing composite material and a process for preparing the same. The composite material is made from raw materials comprising kaolin by in-situ crystallization. This composite material possesses the advantages of high hydrothermal stability, strong ability to resist coke deposition, and the composite material obtained in preparing procedure facilitates to filter.<br>
In particular, the present invention provides a Y-zeolite-containing composite material, wherein said composite material comprises nest-like structure.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, said composite material comprises Y-zeolite in the content of 30-85% by weight and matrix formed after in-situ crystallization of the materials comprising kaolin. More preferably the content of Y-zeolite is in the range of 30-70% by weight of composite material.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the nest-like structure is comprised of at least 70% of rodlike crystal, wherein said rodlike crystal has a diameter of 50-200 nm and a length of 100-600 nm. Said nest-like structure can further comprise flaky crystal and blocky crystal, wherein blocky crystal has an equivalent diameter of about 50-500 nm and flaky crystal has a thickness of about 50-200 nm. Said rodlike crystal, flaky crystal and blocky crystal are comprised of matrix formed after in-situ crystallization of the materials comprising kaolin and Y-zeolite on the surface of said matrix.<br>
The present invention further provides a process for preparing a Y-zeolite-containing composite material, which process comprises calcining raw material powder comprising kaolin at lower temperatures into metakaolin and conducting in-situ crystallization under stirring. In preparing the composite material, calcination of kaolin at lower temperatures may effectively save energy. The particle of the obtained composite material is mainly rodlike crystal,<br><br>
and Y-zeolite crystal grows on the surface of the particle with small size and high dispersion, therefore the active component of the catalyst made from this Y-zeolite crystal may be effectively utilized. Besides, the composite material of the present invention comprises nest-like structure and may provide macropores, and facilitates to filter during preparation procedure.<br>

Detailed embodiments of present invention<br>
The composite material according to the present invention is prepared by calcining raw material comprising kaolin at a lower temperature to convert it into metakaolin, and then mixing metakaolin with sodium silicate, guide agent, solution of sodium hydroxide and water, and conducting in-situ crystallization of metakaolin under stirring and a low temperature. The substance remaining after in-situ crystallization of metakaolin forms amorphous silicon/aluminum matrix and the produced Y-zeolite after in-situ crystallization of metakaolin grows on the surface of said matrix. The crystal diameter of said Y-zeolite is in the range of about 10-400 nm, preferably in the range of 10-100 nm. And the said kaolin is selected from hard kaolin or soft kaolin.<br><br>
The above composite material comprises nest-like structure, especially nest-like sphere, i.e. a geometric structure similar to bird's nest in appearance crosswise piled up by rodlike, flaky, and blocky crystals. There are great numbers of gaps and pores, as well as nest passages inside the nest-like structure. Said pores with a diameter being about 200-1000 nm are located on the surface or interior of the nest-like structure. And the nest passages with a diameter being about 50-500 nm are located inside the structure. The equivalent diameter of said nest-like structure is in the range of about 1000-3000 nm.<br>
Due to the special structure of the composite material provided by the present invention, it has a low apparent bulk density of only 0.50-0.75 g/cm3, wherein having more mesopores and macropores. And the pore volume of 17-3000 A mesopore measured by the BET method is 0.03-0.076 ml/g, accounting for 10-35% of the total volume of the pores.<br>
Although the composite material of the present invention contains more mesopores and macropores, it still has a larger surface area, which is determined to be 280-800 m2/g by the BET method, preferably 400-750 m2/g. The silica/alumina ratio of the Y-zeolite contained in the composite material is 4.0-5.5 by mole.<br>
The Y-zeolite in the above composite material is selected from the group consisting of NaY, HY, REY or REHY. When said zeolite is REY or REHY, the content of rare-earth (RE) is 0.1-15% by weight based on oxide, preferably 8.0-12.0% by weight. The content of sodium in the composite material containing REY or REHY zeolite is less than 0.3% by weight, preferably less than 0.2% by weight.<br>
The present invention provides a process for preparing the composite material, comprises the following steps:<br>
(1) Calcining and dehydrating raw material comprising kaolin at 500-690°C to convert it into metakaolin, and then into a powder<br><br>
with diameters less than 230 μrn;<br>
(2)	Adding sodium silicate, guide agent, solution of sodium hydroxide, and water to metakaolin powder to make a reaction feed with a ratio of (1-2.5)Na20: AI2O3: (4-9)Si02: (40-100)H2O, wherein the ratio by weight of guide agent to metakaolin is 0.1-1.0;<br>
(3)	Crystallizing the reaction feed made in step (2) at 88-98°C under stirring, and then filtering and drying.<br>
The present process calcines raw material powder comprising kaolin at lower temperature to prepare metakaolin, said kaolin preferably being selected from hard kaolin or soft kaolin with an average diameter of less than 4 (μm and therefore being a raw earth which has not been subjected to molding treatment. The temperature for calcining said kaolin is preferably 600-690°C, more preferably 640-680°C, and the calcination time is 1-10 hours. The content of crystal in the selected kaolin should be preferably higher than 75% by weight, more preferably higher than 85% by weight.<br>
The calcined metakaolin must be crushed to make the diameter of all particles less than 230 (μm, otherwise there would exist very rigid solid particle with a larger size in the products to be synthesized directly without crushing the calcined metakaolin, which is unfavorable to the application of the product in catalytic process.<br>
The guide agent used in the above step (2) may be synthesized according to conventional processes, such as those disclosed in USP 3,574,538 , USP 3,639,099 , USP 3,671,191 , USP 4,166,099. The composition of said guide agent is (10-17)SiO2: (0.7-1.3)Al203: (11-18)Na20: (200-350)^0, and in synthesis the guide agent is obtained by aging the raw material at 4-35°C, preferably at 4-20°C.<br>
In the above raw materials for synthesis, sodium silicate may be industrial water glass or other raw materials containing silica, and sodium aluminate is sodium meta-aluminate.

The temperature for drying the composite material after crystallization is 100-120°C.<br>
In order to apply said composite material to the catalytic cracking reaction of heavy oils, the NaY zeolite therein should be converted into H-type or rave earth (RE) ion-exchanged zeolite. The process for preparing HY zeolite is to conduct ion-exchanging of NaY with a solution of soluble ammonium salts, and then drying and calcining. The solution of soluble ammonium salts is selected from solution of ammonium chloride or ammonium nitrate, and the concentration is 4-10% by weight. The calcination temperature after drying is 500-600°C.<br>
The process of the present invention for preparing REY is exchanging the HY zeolite made by ammonium-exchanging with a solution of soluble RE compound once, drying, calcining at 500-600°C, and then conducting ammonium exchange once to three times and drying. The soluble RE compound is preferably chloride of mixed RE, or chloride or nitrate of other RE elements. The RE element is preferably selected from lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, europium, or ytterbium. The property of yttrium is close to RE, so it can also be used for ion-exchange.<br>
The composite material according to present invention is suitable for various reactions catalyzed by solid acid, especially, it<br><br>
can oe usea as an active component or tne cataiyst Tor nuiaizea Dea catalytic cracking of heavy oils or res id. The zeolite in the composite material has higher hydrothermal stability and anti-coking ability after exchange with RE.

The present invention will be described in detail below by the examples, but will not be limited by them.<br>
The content of NaY and the unit cell constant ao of the composite material in the examples are measured according to methods in ASTM D-3906 and D-3942 respectively, and the content of RE2O3 is determined by using the method of X-ray fluorescent spectroscopy.<br>
The silica/alumina ratio in zeolite is obtained by first measuring the unit cell constant ao and then calculating based on the following formula:<br>
Si02/Al203 (mole ratio) = 2x(25.858- a0)/(a0-24.191)<br>
The specific surface area and pore volume are measured by using the low temperature nitrogen adsorption method (BET) according to ASTM D-3663 and D-4365 respectively, and the collapse temperature of the zeolite is determined according to differential thermal analysis (DTA).<br>

Obtained Y-8 has a NaY content of 75.0% by weight, a unit cell constant of 24.68, and a silica/alumina ratio of 4.82.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE<br>
Kaolin was calcined at 870°C for 2 hours according to the process of CN 1334142A and then Y-9 was made according to the process of Example 1. The content of NaY in Y-9 was 80% by weight and the silica/alumina ratio was 4.72. The SEM image of Y-9 is shown in Figure 6, which indicates that Y-9 has no nest-like structure.<br>
EXAMPLES 9-13<br>
Preparing REY-containing composite material of the present invention<br>
100 g NH4CI and 1000 g deionized water were added to 100 g composite material containing NaY zeolite prepared according to the present invention, and the mixture was stirred at 90°C for 2 hours, followed by being washed and filtered, and then dried at 120°C for 2 hours, yielding a composite material containing NH4Y zeolite.<br>
Deionized water was added to 100 g composite material containing NH4Y zeolite in a ratio of NH4Y: RE2O3: H20 of 1: 0.1: 10 and the pH value was adjusted to 4.5 with dilute hydrochloric acid. Then solution of mixed RE chloride was added and ion-exchange proceeded at 90°C under stirring for 2 hours. After washing and filtering, the collected solid was calcined at 560°C for 2 hours. A calcined stock with a ratio of REY: NH4CI: H20 = 1: 0.3: 10 was fed<br><br>
and subjected to ammonium-exchange at 90°C under stirring for 1 hour. Followed by being filtered, washed, and dried at 120°C for 2 hours. The ammonium-exchange was repeated once under the same condition yielding REY-zeolite-containing composite material with a content of sodium oxide below 0.3% by weight. The content of REY in the composite material prepared from each example, corresponding number thereof, and the number of the feed used in preparation processes are shown in Table 2.<br>
EXAMPLE 14<br>
REY-containing composite material of the present invention was aged at 810°C for 8 and 17 hours respectively with 100% steam, and then dried and evaluated for its catalytic performance with light oil having a boiling range of 239-351 °C in a micro-reactor. The results are shown in Table 3.<br>
It can be seen from Table 3 that the composite material according to the present invention still has a preferable hydrothermal stability after severe aging treatment. This is reflected by the high activity in the micro-reactor. This is because that the composite material of the present invention has a nest-like structure, various crystals can not completely pile up between each other and there exit many gaps and spaces, which are favorable to the diffusion and transfer of heat, meanwhile, as zeolite crystal grows on the surface of the amorphous silica/alumina matrix formed after crystal transformation of kaolin, which matrix not only can disperse the heat on the zeolite crystal, but also can dilute the concentration of sodium oxide on the crystal, thereby enhancing the thermal stability.<br>
EXAMPLE 15<br>
The present example illustrates the catalytic performance of the composite material of the present invention for cracking heavy oil in a micro-reactor.<br>
REY-1, REY-3, and REY-5 using as catalysts, were aged at<br><br>
810°C for 17 hours with 100% steam, and then evaluated for catalytic performance of aged catalysts in a micro-reactor device of heavy oil. The loading of the catalyst was 2 g. The properties of the feed oil used are shown in Table 4. The results obtained at a reaction temperature of 500°C, catalyst/oil ratio of 1.18, and mass space velocity of 43.71 h1 are shown in Table 5, wherein the end point of gasoline was 220°C and that of diesel oil was 330°C.<br>
The data in Table 5 indicate that compared to the comparative catalyst REY-5, the composite materials according to the present invention exhibited higher conversion, high yield of light oils, low yield of dry gas and coke even after subjecting to extremely sever aging treatment, showing that the composite materials according to the present invention have a high hydrothermal stability, and a strong ability to crack heavy oils.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
