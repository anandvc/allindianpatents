The present invention relates to a novel thermo-isomerization method for rapidly and simply producing macrocyclic ketones.<br>
Macrocyclic ketones are of considerable importance in perfumery because of their musk-like odor properties. In this connection, cyclopentadecanone (Exalton), 3-methylcyclopentadecanone (muscone), cycloheptadec-S-en-l-one (civettone) and (E/Z)-cyclohexadec-5-en-l-one (Ambretone, Musk TM II*) . in particular are to date of commercial importance as musk ketones. As is knovm from the specialist literature, such macrocyclic ketones can be prepared by multistage syntheses which are essentially based on two basic methods:<br>
a) Macrocycl ization reactions (for example, the so-called acyloin condensation of a, (o-diesters with subsequent reduction or the intramolecular olefin . metathesis (ring closure metathesis, RCM) etc.). Since polymerization processes should be avoided, most macrocyclization reactions are only carried out using high dilutions and are therefore too cost-intensive for reactions on an industrial scale.<br>
b&gt; Ring expansion reactions which are based either on a multistage sequence of anellation and fragmentation reactions/ or on sigmatropic [3.3] -rearrangement reactions (e.g. oxy- Cope reaction of 1/2-divinylcycloaikan-l-ols), or also [1.3] -displacement reactions in the case of l-vinylcycloalk-3-en-l-olB {W.   Tbiea,   P. Daruwala,  J. Org.  Chem.  1987, 52, 3798 - 3806).<br>
Ring expansion reactions by 2 carbon atoms according to the principle of a [l.3]-displacement reaction are described in numerous scientific articles (for example in Tetrahedron Lett. 1970, 513 - 516) . In the case of l-vinyl-cyloalk-3-en-l-ols with a nine- to thirteen-membered ring system and endocyclic, homoallylic double bond in position 3, instead of [3.3]-<br><br>
rearrangement products (ring expansion by four carbon atoms), ring expansions in the sense of a [1.3] -displacement (ring expansion by two carbon atoms) was preferentially observed under the thermal conditions for oxy-Cope rearrangements- The yield is at most 25% since the elimination of water occurs as an undesired reaction. Significantly better yields {50-80%) are described when the vinyl alcohol has been converted into the corresponding trimethylsilyl ether prior to heating. The same products were obtained when the rearrangement reaction was . carried out with the corresponding doubly unsaturated potassium alkoxide under strongly anionic conditions (2 mol equivalent of potassium hydride in HMPA at 25 - 100°C) ,<br>
In J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1974, 964, 200 - 203, it is expressly pointed out that both in the case of the trimethylsilyl ether derivative, and particularly also in the case of the non-derivatized vinyl alcohol itself, an analogous [1.3]-displacement reaction could no longer be observed at temperatures up to 320°C as soon as the homoallylic endocyclic double bond (in position 3) was removed. The application of additionally forced reaction conditions (reaction temperatures up to 420°C) led in both cases primarily to the formation of alkenes (elimination of water) . J. Chem, Soc. 1978, 43, 1050-1057, describes that no products of a ring expansion could be observed with the use of anionic rearrangement conditions either, i.e. by treating the vinyl alcohol, which has a saturated ring system, with potassium hydride in HMPA for 4 or 24 h at room temperature.<br>
The 1-vinylcyclopropanols, which are structurally related to the vinylcyclopropanes, rearrange irreversibly to give 2-substituted cyclobutanones when heated to only 100°C within a short time with a [1.2]-migration. However, if, on the other hand, instead of the vinylcyclopropanols, their trimethylsilyl ether derivatives (1-triraethylsilyloxy-l-vinylcyclopropanes) are heated, then these can again be converted into cyclopentanones with a [1.3]-migration (J  Am.   Chem,  Soc.   1973, 95,   5311 - 5321;<br><br>
and J. Org.   Chem,   1981, 46,   506 - 509) .<br>
J, Org. Chem, 1978, 43, 4903-4905 and J. Org. Chem, 1980, 45, 2460 - 2468 describe ring expansion by two carbon atoms also in the case of specially functionalized macrocyclic dithiaspiroketone derivatives (e.g. 1.5-dithiaspiro[5.12]octa-decan-7-one). This described method cannot be used on relatively small ring systems, such as on cyclododecanone as starting material.<br>
An object of the present invention is a simple and cost-effective method for producing macrocyclic ketones.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that, through the thermo-isomerization method according to the invention, macrocyclic ketones of the formula la or lb can be produced in the gas phase at temperatures above 500°C rapidly and in a simple manner directly with a high yield.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides in one of its aspects a thermo-isomerization method for producing macrocyclic ketones of the formula la and lb<br><br><br>
in. formula la, R3 and R2 or R2 and R3 can, independently of one another, form a ring.<br>
The ketones of the formula la or lb ring-extended by two carbon atoms are produced by converting under reduced presure at 100-300°C into the gas phase a macrocyclic tertiary allyl or propargyl alcohol of the formula IIa or IIb<br><br>
wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, and n have the same meanings as above, and R5 is either hydrogen, trialkylsilyl, or an alkali metal cation,<br>
and then heating the macrocyclic tertiary allyl or propargyl alcohol of the formula Ila or lib, converted into the gas phase, at temperatures of 500 to 700°C, and<br>
hydrolysis of the trialkyl silyl ether into the corresponding ketone of the formula la or lb, if R5 is a trialkylsilyl.<br>
The size of the ring system is therefore described by n. If n-7, 10-raembered cyclic ketones are obtained from 8-membered cyclic alcohols. In the case of n=14, 17-membered cyclic ketones can accordingly be obtained from 15-membered cyclic alcohols,<br>
C1-C6 Alkyl is, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, sec- or tert-butyl, pentyl or hexyl, where methyl is particularly preferred.<br>
Depending on'the nature of the substituents on the vinyl group of the tertiary cyclic alcohol of the formula Ila used as starting material, thus the substituents are not hydrogen, the described method allows the simultaneous production of ring-expanded and additionally regioselective substituted macrocyclic<br><br>
ketones. The positions of the substituents in the macrocyclic ketones are located as shown in formula. la on the two successive carbon atoms adjacent to the carbon atom of the carbonyl group (regarded as C(1)) and distribute themselves in the following way: R1 is on the carbon atom directly adjacent to the carbonyl<br>
group (thus in the a-position) on C(2) and both R2 and R3 are each on the same ring half of the macrocyclic ketone at a distance of two carbon atoms from the carbonyl group (thus in<br>
the p-position) on C(3), directly adjacent to C(2), If, in the method described, instead of tertiary cyclic allyl alcohols, corresponding macrocyclic propargyl alcohols of the formula l1b are used, then macrocyclic ketones are obtained, which contain a double bond in direct conjugation to the carbonyl group<br>
(a,p-unsaturated ketones). If there is an additional substitnent R4 on the ring system of the cyclic alcohol (thus R4 is not hydrogen) regioisomeric ring-extended macrocyclic ketones can additionally be obtained, depending on which half of the cyclic system the two carbon atoms of the original vinyl group of the starting material are incorporated according to the method described above. This naturally also applies when R4 represents two or more substituents.<br>
Using the described thermo-isomerization process, it is possible to produce, from tertiary cyclic allyl or propargyl alcohols, macrocyclic ketones which can in turn be converted efficiently and in a simple manner by known methods into cyclic tertiary allyl or propargyl alcohols, which can in turn be used as starting materials in the described thermo-isomerization method. The described process therefore additionally offers, by repetition of the process, the options of producing, by iteration, in each case also the macrocyclic ketones ring-expanded by four, six, eight, etc. carbon atoms, in which case only two synthesis stages are required per repeat cycle.<br>
In the same way, the described method can also be used for the analogous etherified derivatives of the parent macrocyclic tertiary alcohols,  for example,  trialkyl silyl ethers,  in<br><br>
particular for trimethylsilyl ethers (when thus R5 in formula IIa or IIb represents a trimethylsilyl group), where then, in an analogous manner, firstly, however, in each case mixtures of the corresponding ring-expanded cyclic trimethylsilyl enol ethers are obtained. Hydrolysis of these trimethylsilyl enol ether mixtures then likewise leads again to the same ketones which can be obtained from the corresponding parent alcohols in a direct manner, without prior derivatization by a suitable silyl group and thus without the additionally required hydrolysis stage.<br>
By carrying out the thermo-isomerization in the gas phase, the method according to the invention can take place without the use of solvent and thus in a manner which respects environmental protection, if the starting material is vaporized directly into the gas phase and passed to the reactor unit. Expedient design of the apparatus additionally allows the described thermo-isomerization method to be carried out continuously and thus potentially also permits process automation. In the scientific specialist literature there are many descriptions of different apparatus for carrying out very diverse analogous chemical conversion processes in the gas phase using temperatures of up to about 1000°C (gas-phase flow thermolysis or short-term vacuum pyrolysis apparatuses).<br>
The method according to the invention for producing macrocyclic ketones is based on the thermo-isomerization of tertiary macrocyclic allyl alcohols or propargyl alcohols in the gas phase at temperatures of from 500 to 700°C. To carry out the method according to the invention, the alcohol used as starting material is either initially introduced in a vaporization unit, or is added via a metering device, such as a metering or spray pump, from a storage vessel, preferably either in undiluted form or else in dissolved form in a suitable inert solvent (such as, for example, xylene) in a continuous manner and heated, under reduced pressure depending on the boiling point of the starting material used to temperatures in the range from about 100 -300°C, preferably in the range from 120 - 250°C and thereby<br><br>
converted into the gas phase. The alcohol preheated in the vaporization unit is then passed into the gas phase, optionally also using a regulatable inert gas stream, where the inert gas can, for example, be nitrogen, argon or helium, and, at reduced pressure, through a suitably dimensioned and appropriately shaped reactor unit which is heated to temperatures between 500 and 700°C, where the macrocyclic tertiary allyl or propargyl alcohol used according to the present description of the thermo-isomerization process according to the invention is converted into the corresponding macrocyclic ketone.<br>
The reactor unit is generally expediently tubular in shape, and is preferably made of an inert material which is thermostable and does not interfere with the course of the isomerization reaction, for example, certain types of high-melting glass.It can be arranged horizontally or vertically or at any desired incline, and it can be heated independently of the vaporization unit in a generally known manner, for example, using an electric heating mantle. The temperature range required for the described thermo-isomerization method depends simultaneously on a number of factors, for example, the prevailing pressure within the reactor, the configuration and dimensions of the reactor vessel, the size of the inert-gas stream (flow) and the rate of addition and rate of vaporization of the starting material or • of its solutions, and on the solvent. It is preferably in the range of from 500 to 700°C. Below about 450°C the thermo-isomerization process is so slow that primarily unchanged starting material and in some instances dehydration products are found, whereas at temperatures above 700°C decomposition products and undesired secondary reactions are observed to an increasing degree. The preferred temperature range for as complete as possible a conversion of the starting materials used in the described thermo-isomerization method is directly dependent on the stated individual reactor parameters and often is above 550°C, particularly optimally in the range from 570°C - 670°C, particularly when the process is carried out without solvents with a gentle inert gas stream or in a high vacuum without inert<br><br>
gas stream and without a filler packing. Preferably, the described thermo-isomerization process is carried out at reduced pressure, particularly advantageously at a vacuum in the range from .about 1 to 10 mbar (1-10 hPa) , in any case expediently below the saturated vapor pressure of the alcohol used as .starting material, but the desired product formation can be observed in the inert-gas stream also at a less greatly reduced pressure, for example, that obtained by using a water-jet vacuum or a laboratory membrane vacuum pump. The pressure in the apparatus and thus at the same time the contact time in the reactor unit can additionally be influenced by the regulation of the inert-gas stream, or during injection of liquid starting materials, through the rate of addition or in the case of initially solid starting materials, through the rate of   vaporization.<br>
In the downstream condenser unit, the gaseous reaction products obtained by the thermo-isomerization method are cooled to room temperature or below by means of a suitable medium by known methods and in so doing liquefied again (or in individual cases resublimed) and then collected in a receiver. An outlet valve on the receiver and a further valve (tap) on the collecting container which can be detached from the receiver permits, in accordance with the Normag-Thiele attempt, the collection and the removal at least of the liquid reaction products also under continuing reduced pressure within the described thermo-isomerization apparatus, in particular in the vaporization, reactor and condenser unit, meaning that a continuous permanent operation of the apparatus can also be ensured. The reduced pressure in the apparatus is generated by a vacuum-pump unit with suitable suction capacity, particularly advantageously by means of a high-vacuum pump. It is possible to connect between vacuum pump and apparatus further cooling traps a suitable cooling medium to receive readily volatile by-product components.<br>
Using the method according to the invention, the following novel<br><br>
compounds have been produced:<br>
2 -methylcyclotetradecanone, 3 -methylcycloheptadecanone, 5-methylcycloheptadecanone, 3 -methylcycloheptadecanone, 4-ethylcyclotetradecanone, 3,4-dimethylcyclotetradecanone,<br>
The tertiary macrocyclic allyl alcohols of the formula Ila required as starting materials for the thermo-isomerization process can be produced readily by known methods, for example preferably by the addition of suitable organometallic-alkenyl compounds, such as magnesium or lithium-l-alkenyls on to the corresponding macrocyclic ketones. By knovm methods yields of up to 70% of macrocyclic allyl or propargyl alcohols are obtained by the addition of common vinyl Grignard reagents, such as, vinylmagnesium chloride or vinylmagnesium bromide, or e.g. also of corresponding 1- or 2-substituted vinyl-Grignard compounds or metalloalkynide derivatives, as are shown as substituents on C(l) of the tertiary macrocyclic alcohols of the formula Ila, and where R1 to R3 have the meanings given in the description, are, for macrocyclic ketones.<br>
Better yields of macrocyclic allyl alcohols of the formula lla, mostly in the region around or also above about 90% can be obtained by transferring a precomplexation method to macrocyclic ketones. This can be achieved with catalytic or substoichiometric or stoichiometric amounts of an anhydrous Lewis acid, such as, of cerium trichloride (CeCl3) at temperatures in the range from about 0-40°C, where improved yields of tertiary allyl alcohols were obtained during the subsequent addition of the organometallic-alkenyl used. The addition of from 1.01 to about 2 mol equivalents, preferably from 1.5 to 1.8 mol equivalents of the organometallic-alkenyl  solution in absolute THF to the suspension of the macrocyclic ketone precomplexed in the described manner, usually proceeds with noticeable heat of reaction and therefore advantageously is conducted such that the rate of the addition is chosen depending on the existing cooling capacity of the reactor system such that<br><br>
the temperature of the precooled reaction mixture does not exceed 30 to about 40°C. The temperature is then maintained, with stirring, for about a further 10 to 120 minutes at 35 to 40°C, and, af ter monitoring the course of the reaction, for example by gas chromatography of the reaction mixture, where necessary 0.1 to 0.2 mol equivalents of the alkenyl or alkynyl compound is again added for as complete as possible a conversion of the ketone used. The tertiary macrocyclic allyl or propargyl alcohol obtained following hydrolysis of the reaction mixture is either purified by distillation in a high vacuum or by recrystallization or chromatography, or else used in the form of the crude product directly for subsequent thermo-isomerization as starting material.<br>
Using the above-described method it was possible to produce the following novel tertiary macrocyclic allyl alcohols of the formula IIa or propargyl alcohols of the formula l1b required for the thermo-isomerization process as starting material:<br>

Examples<br>
I,   Alkenyl and  1-alkynyl Grignard  reactions:<br>
a)	Drying of cerium trichloride:<br>
100 g of cerium) chloride heptahydrate (Fluka) (0.26B mol) was dried with continuous rotation in a Buchi Kugelrohr oven in a high vacuum by firstly heating for 5 - 6 h at an air bath temperature of 70 - 80o°C, then for 3 - 4 h at 110 - 120°C and finally overnight (about 12 h) at 150 - 160°C. The eliminated water was collected in cool traps (liquid nitrogen cooling), these were changed a number of times until finally no more condensation was obseirved. After thawing, the liquid content of the cool traps was collected and thus finally about 34 ml of water and 65 g of dried pulverulent cerium (III) chloride were obtained. This was transferred to a storage vessel under an inert gas atmosphere and stored under an argon atmosphere. Even after storage for several months at room temperature, no loss in activity for the Grignard  reactions described below was found.<br>
b)	Precomplexation of the ketone  (typical,  generalizable<br>
procedure):<br>
36.4 g of cyclododecanone (0.2 mol) was suspended together with .5 g of anhydrous CeCl3 (0.02 mol, 0.1 mol equiv.) at room temperature in 100 ml of absolute THF and vigorous stirred under an inert-gas atmosphere for 1 to 2 hours until a whitish to intensively yellow homogeneous suspension of partially gel-like consistency was obtained.<br>
1.  Vinyl   Orlgnard        reaction   (typical,   generali zable<br><br>
procedure):<br>
1.1  1 -Vinyl -1 -cyclododecanol from cyclododecanone:<br>
To the suspension of the ketone activated by precomplexation with CeClj was added 320 ml of a 1 -molar solution of vinylmagnesium bromide in abs. THF (corresponding to about 0,32 mol of vinylmagnesium bromide, about 1.6 mol equiv.) within about 5 min with stirring such that, with temporary use of a cooling bath (ice bath), the temperature inside the reaction vessel did not exceed the temperature range from 35 - 40°C. After the exothermic reaction had subsided, the now grayish-green reaction mixture was stirred for about a further 30 min at 35 - 40°C, and the course of the reaction was monitored by gas chromatographic analysis. Depending on the activity of the cerium(III) chloride used, this usually reveals a starting material conversion significantly above 70% already just after 15 minutes, where then, if need be, still incompletely reacted ketone can be reacted by the addition of further about 0.1 to 0.2 mol equivalents of vinylmagnesium bromide (above 80% conversion).<br>
Work-up : The reaction mixture was left to cool to room temperature and was poured it on to 1 1 of iced water, adding a layer of the extractant (toluene or TBME) and slowly admixed, with stirring, with an approximately 5 - 10% strength aqueous hydrochloric acid solution until the slime- or gel-like consistency of the mixture had disappeared (about pH 3 or below) and, with the appearance of a yellow to brownish coloration, a clear phase boundary could finally be recognized. The aqueous phase was removed and the organic phase was washed a number of times, firstly with water, then with sodium hydrogencarbonate solution or with about 5% strength NaOH solution, then again with water, cone, aqueous NaCl solution and finally dried over sodium sulfate or magnesium sulfate. After the extractant had been evaporated under reduced pressure, the crude product obtained was 41.3 g of 1-vinyl-l-cyclododecanol (crude yield 97%<br><br>
of theory, GC purity &gt; 86%, comprises about 12 - 14% cyclododecanone) was obtained as a slightly yellowish solid. This was either used directly for the subsequent thermo-isomerization or purified beforehand either by Kugelrohr distillation at a high vacuum and recrystallization from hexane/TBME (95:5, v:v) or by chromatography over silica gel (hexane:TBME 9:1): colorless, wax-like solid with melting point 53'*C,<br>

IX.  Thermo-lsomarizations<br>
Apparatus and general procedure:<br>
The tertiary cyclic alcohol was in each case initially introduced into a Kugelrohr flask (50 or 100 ml, with two opposite ground-glass necks) together with a small magnetic stirrer. After applying an inert-gas feed (stainless steel capillary fused into standard ground-glass attachments) on the rear ground-glass neck, the flask was attached by the front ground-glass joint to the slightly inclined reactor vessel (quartz glass reactor, internal diameter 25 or 40 mm, length 40 cm, heated with Thermolyne tube furnace, 35 cm) . At the opposite end of the reactor vessel there was a cool trap (cooling medium liquid nitrogen or dry ice/acetone), which was connected to a high-vacuum pump unit. Following equilibrium of the reactor temperature to 650 - 660°C (measured in the middle of the outside wall of the reactor vessel), evacuation of the entire apparatus and establishment of a pressure of about 1 mbar (1 hPa), the flask with the initial charge of alcohol was heated in an airbath (heating mantle of modified Buchi Kugelrohr oven) and thus the starting material, with stirring, vaporized and distilled through the reactor vessel. In this connection, a precision needle valve was used to establish a gentle stream of inert gas (nitrogen, according to Vogtlin model V100 flowmeter 1 - 5 1/h) and passed via a capillary through the apparatus. At the reactor outlet, a colorless oil began in each case to<br><br>
condense shortly afterwards. This was collected in a collection vessel below the cool trap, where it partially solidified. After about 15 - 45 min, the starting material was evaporated, in most cases substantially residue-free. After cooling the apparatus, flushing with inert gas, the condensate was washed out of the cool trap with hexane. All of the yields given are typical average values usually from, in each case, at least three thermo-isoraerizations carried out separately.<br>
