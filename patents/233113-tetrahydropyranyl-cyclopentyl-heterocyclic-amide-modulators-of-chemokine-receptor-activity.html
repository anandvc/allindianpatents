				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
TETRAHYDROPYRANYL CYCLOPENTYL HETEROCYLIC AMIDE MODULATORS OF<br>
CHEMOKINE RECEPTOR ACTIVITY<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The chemokines are a family of small (70-120 ammo acids), proinflarmnatory cytokines, with potent chemotactic activities. Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that are released by a wide variety of cells to attract various cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, T cells, eosinophils, basophils and neutrophils to sites of inflammation (reviewed in Schall, Cytokine. 3, 165-183 (1991) and Murphy, Rev. Immun.. 12, 593-633 (1994)). These molecules were originally defined by four conserved cysteines and divided into two subfamilies based on the arrangement of the first cysteine pair.  In the CXC-chemokine family, which includes IL-8, GROα, NAP-2 and IP-10, these two cysteines are separated by a single amino acid, while in the CC-chemokine family, which includes RANTES, MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, MlP-lα, MlP-lβand eotaxin, these two residues are adjacent.<br>
The a-chemokines, such as interleukin-8 (IL-8), neutrophil-activating protein-2 (NAP-2) and melanoma growth stimulatory activity protein (MGSA) are chemotactic primarily for neutrophils, whereas β-chemokines, such as RANTES, MlP-lα, MIP-lβ, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), MCP-2, MCP-3 and eotaxin are chemotactic for macrophages, monocytes, T-cells, eosinophils and basophils (Deng, et al., Nature. 381, 661-666 (1996)).<br>
The chemokines are secreted by a wide variety of cell types and bind to specific<br>
G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) (reviewed in Horuk, Trends Pharm. Sci. 15, 159-165<br>
(1994)) present on leukocytes and other cells. These chemokine receptors form a sub-family of<br>
GPCRs, which, at present, consists of fifteen characterized members and a number of orphans.<br>
Unlike receptors for promiscuous chemoattractants such as C5a, fMLP, PAF, and LTB4,<br>
chemokine receptors are more selectively expressed on - 1 -<br>
subsets of leukocytes. Thus, generation of specific chemokines provides a mechanism for recruitment of particular leukocyte subsets.<br>
On binding their cognate ligands, chemokine receptors transduce an intracellular signal though the associated trimeric G protein, resulting in a rapid increase in intracellular calcium concentration. There are at least seven human chemokine receptors that bind or respond to β-chemokines with the following characteristic pattern: CCR-1 (or "CKR-1" or "CC-CKR-1")<br>
[MlP-la, MIP-lβ, MCP-3, RANTES] (Ben-Barruch, et al., J. Biol. Chem.. 270, 22123-22128 (1995); Beote, et al, Cell. 72,415-425 (1993)); CCR-2A and CCR-2B (or "CKR-2A"/"CKR-2A" or "CC-CKR-2A"/"CC-CKR-2A") [MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4]; CCR-3 (or "CKR-3" or "CC-CKR-3") [Eotaxin, Eotaxin 2, RANTES, MCP-2, MCP-3] (Rollins, et al., Blood. 90, 908-928 (1997)); CCR-4 (or "CKR-4" or "CC-CKR-4") [MlP-la, RANTES, MCP-1] (Rollins, et al., Blood, 90, 908-928 (1997)); CCR-5 (or "CKR-5" or "CC-CKR-5") [Mff-la, RANTES, MIP-lβ] (Sanson, et al., Biochemistry. 35, 3362-3367 (1996)); and the Duffy blood-group antigen [RANTES, MCP-1] (Chaudhun, et al., J. Biol. Chem.. 269, 7835-7838 (1994)). The P-chemokines include eotaxin, MIP ("macrophage inflammatory protein"), MCP ("monocyte chemoattractant protein") and RANTES ("regulation-upon-activation, normal T expressed and secreted") among other chemokines.<br>
Chemokine receptors, such as CCR-1, CCR-2, CCR-2A, CCR-2B, CCR-3, CCR-4, CCR-5, CXCR-3, CXCR-4, have been implicated as being important mediators of inflammatory and immunoregulatory disorders and diseases, including asthma, rhinitis and allergic diseases, as well as autoimmune pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis. Humans who are homozygous for the 32-basepair deletion in the CCR-5 gene appear to have less susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (Gomez, et al., Arthritis &amp; Rheumatism. 42, 989-992 (1999)). A review of the role of eosinophils in allergic inflammation is provided by Kita, H., et al., J. Exp. Med. 183, 2421-2426 (1996). A general review of the role of chemokines in allergic inflammation is provided by Lustger, A.D., New England J. Med., 338(7), 426-445 (1998).<br>
A subset of chemokines are potent chemoattractants for monocytes and macrophages. The best characterized of these is MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), whose primary receptor is CCR2. MCP-1 is produced in a variety of cell types in response to inflammatory stimuli in various species, including rodents and humans, and stimulates chemotaxis in monocytes and a subset of lymphocytes. In particular, MCP-1 production correlates with monocyte and macrophage infiltration at inflammatory sites.   Deletion of either MCP-1 or CCR2 by homologous recombination in mice results in marked attenuation of monocyte recruitment in response to thioglycollate injection and Listeria monocytogenes infection (Lu et al., J. Exp. Med.. 187,601-608 (1998); Kurihara et ai. J. Exp. Med.. 186, 1757-1762 (1997); Boring et al. J. Clin. Invest.. 100, 2552-2561 (1997); Kuziel et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 94, 12053-12058 (1997)). Furthermore, these animals show reduced monocyte infiltration<br>
into granulomatous lesions induced by the injection of schistosomal or mycobacterial antigens (Boring et al. J. Clin. Invest.. 100, 2552-2561 (1997); Warmington et al. Am J. Path.. 154, 1407-1416(1999)). These data suggest that MCP-1-induced CCR2 activation  plays a major role in monocyte recruitment to inflammatory sites, and that antagonism of this activity will produce a sufficient suppression of the immune response to produce therapeutic benefits in immunoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases.<br>
Accordingly, agents which modulate chemokine receptors such as the CCR-2 receptor would be useful in such disorders and diseases.<br>
In addition, the recruitment of monocytes to inflammatory lesions in the vascular wall is a major component of the pathogenesis of atherogenic plaque formation. MCP-1 is produced and secreted by endothelial cells and intimal smooth muscle cells after injury to the vascular wall in hypercholesterolemic conditions. Monocytes recruited to the site of injury infiltrate the vascular wall and differentiate to foam cells in response to the released MCP-1. Several groups have now demonstrated that aortic lesion size, macrophage content and necrosis are attenuated in MCP-1 -/- or CCR2 -/- mice backcrossed to APO-E -/-, LDL-R -/- or Apo B transgenic mice maintained on high fat diets (Boring et al. Nature. 394, 894-897 (1998); Gosling et al. J. Clin. Invest.. 103, 773-778 (1999)). Thus, CCR2 antagonists may inhibit atherosclerotic lesion formation and pathological progression by impairing monocyte recruitment and differentiation in the arterial wall.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is further directed to compounds which are modulators of chemokine receptor activity and are useful in the prevention or treatment of certain inflammatory and immunoregulatory disorders and diseases, allergic diseases, atopic conditions including allergic rhinitis, dermatitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma, as well as autoimmune pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis. The invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and the use of these compounds and compositions in the prevention or treatment of such diseases in which chemokine receptors are involved.<br>

The compounds of the instant invention have at least two asymmetric centers at the 1- and 3-positions of the cyclopentyl ring. Additional asymmetric centers may be present depending upon the nature of the various substituents on the'molecule. Each such asymmetric center will independently produce two optical isomers and it is intended that all of the possible optical isomers and diastereomers in mixtures and as pure or partially purified compounds are included within the ambit of this invention. The configurations of one aspect of the compounds of this invention are where the substituents on the cyclopentyl ring (amide and amine units) are cis, as depicted:<br><br>

The absolute configurations of a further aspect of the compounds of this invention are those of the orientation as depicted:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein the carbon bearing the amine substituent is designated as being of the (R) absolute configuration and the carbon bearing the amide subunit can be designated as being of either the (S) or (R) absolute configuration depending on the priority for Rl. For example if R is isopropyl<br>
then the absolute stereochemistry at the carbon bearing the amide subunit would be (5) since the amide and amine units are preferred to have the cis arrangement on the cyclopentyl ring.<br>
The independent syntheses of diastereomers and enantiomers or their<br>
chromatographic separations may be achieved as known in the art by appropriate modification of the methodology disclosed herein. Their absolute stereochemistry may be determined by the x-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute configuration.<br>

The subject compounds are useful in a method of modulating chemokine receptor activity in a patient in need of such modulation comprising the administration of an effective amount of the compound.<br>
The present invention is directed to the use of the foregoing compounds as modulators of chemokine receptor activity. In particular, these compounds are useful as modulators of the chemokine receptors, in particular CCR-2.<br>
The utility of the compounds in accordance with the present invention as modulators of chemokine receptor activity may be demonstrated by methodology known in the<br>
art, such as the assay for chemokine binding as disclosed by Van Riper, -et al., J. Exp. Med.. 177, 851-856 (1993) which may be readily adapted for measurement of CCR-2 binding.<br>
Receptor affinity in a CCR-2 binding assay was determined by measuring inhibition of 125I-MCP-1 to the endogenous CCR-2 receptor on various cell types including monocytes, THP-1 cells, or after heterologous expression of the cloned receptor in eukaryotic cells.  The cells were suspended in binding buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, and 0.50% BSA) with and added to test compound or DMSO and 125J-MCP-1 at room temperature for 1 h to allow binding. The cells were then collected on GFB filters, washed with 25 mM HEPES buffer containing 500 mM NaCl and cell bound 125J-MCP-1 was quantified.<br>
In a chemotaxis assay chemotaxis was performed using T cell depleted PBMC isolated from venous whole or leukophoresed blood and purified by Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation followed by rosetting with neuraminidase-treated sheep erythrocytes. Once isolated, the cells were washed with HBSS containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA and suspended at 1x107 cells/ml. Cells were fluorescently labeled in the dark with 2 µM Calcien-AM (Molecular Probes), for 30 min at 37° C. Labeled cells were washed twice and suspended at 5x106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine (without phenol red) containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA. MCP-1 (Peprotech) at 10 ng/ml diluted in same medium or medium alone were added to the bottom wells (27 µl). Monocytes (150,000 cells) were added to the topside of the filter (30 µl) following a 15 min preincubation with DMSO or with various concentrations of test compound. An equal concentration of test compound or DMSO was added to the bottom well to prevent dilution by diffusion. Following a 60 min incubation at 37° C, 5 % C02, the filter was removed and the<br>
topside was washed with HBSS containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA to remove cells that had not migrated into the filter. Spontaneous migration (chemokinesis) was determined in the absence of chemoattractant<br>
In particular, the compounds of the following examples had activity in binding to the CCR-2 receptor in the aforementioned assays, generally with an ICso of less than about 1<br>
uM. Such a result is indicative of the intrinsic activity of the compounds in use as modulators of chemokine receptor activity.<br>
Mammalian chemokine receptors provide a target for interfering with or promoting eosinophil and/or lymphocyte function in a mammal, such as a human. Compounds which inhibit or promote chemokine receptor function, are particularly useful for modulating eosinophil and/or lymphocyte function for therapeutic purposes. Accordingly, compounds which<br>
inhibit or promote chemokine receptor function would be useful in treating, preventing, ameliorating, controlling or reducing the risk of a wide variety of inflammatory and immunoregulatory disorders and diseases, allergic diseases, atopic conditions including allergic rhinitis, dermatitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma, as well as autoimmune pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis.<br>
For example, an instant compound which inhibits one or more functions of a mammalian chemokine receptor (e.g., a human chemokine receptor) may be administered to inhibit (i.e., reduce or prevent) inflammation. As a result, one or more inflammatory processes, such as leukocyte emigration, chemotaxis, exocytosis (e.g., of enzymes, histamine) or inflammatory mediator release, is inhibited.<br>
In addition to primates, such as humans, a variety of other mammals can be treated according to the method of the present invention. For instance, mammals including, but not limited to, cows, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, guinea pigs, rats or other bovine, ovine, equine, canine, feline, rodent or murine species can be treated. However, the method can also be practiced in other species, such as avian species (e.g., chickens).<br>
Diseases and conditions associated with inflammation and infection can be treated using the compounds of the present invention. In a preferred embodiment, the disease or condition is one in which the actions of lymphocytes are to be inhibited or promoted, in order to modulate the inflammatory response.<br>
Diseases or conditions of humans or other species which can be treated with inhibitors of chemokine receptor function, include, but are not limited to: inflammatory or allergic diseases and conditions, including respiratory allergic diseases such as asthma, particularly bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, hypersensitivity lung diseases, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonias (e.g., Loeffler's syndrome, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia), delayed-type hypersentitivity, interstitial lung diseases (ILD) (e.g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or ILD associated with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic sclerosis, Sjogren's syndrome, polymyosiris or dermatomyositis); systemic anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity responses, drug allergies (e.g., to penicillin, cephalosporins), insect sting allergies; autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, myasthenia gravis, juvenile onset diabetes; glomerulonephritis, autoimmune thyroiditis, Behcet's disease; graft rejection (e.g., in transplantation), including allograft rejection or graft-versus-host disease;<br>
inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis; spondyloarthropathies; scleroderma; psoriasis (including T-cell mediated psoriasis) and inflammatory dermatoses such an dermatitis, eczema, atopic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, urticaria; vasculitis (e.g., necrotizing, cutaneous, and hypersensitivity vasculitis); eosinphilic myositis, eosinophilic fasciitis; cancers with leukocyte infiltration of the skin or organs. Other diseases or conditions in which undesirable inflammatory responses are to be inhibited can be treated, including, but not limited to, reperfusion injury, atherosclerosis, certain hematologic malignancies, cytokine-induced toxicity (e.g., septic shock, endotoxic shock), polymyositis, dermatomyositis.<br>
Diseases or conditions of humans or other species which can be treated with modulators of chemokine receptor function, include, but are not limited to: immunosuppression, such as that in individuals with immunodeficiency syndromes such as AIDS or other viral infections, individuals undergoing radiation therapy, chemotherapy, therapy for autoimmune disease or drug therapy (e.g., corticosteroid therapy), which causes immunosuppression; immunosuppression due to congenital deficiency in receptor function or other causes; and infections diseases, such as parasitic diseases, including, but not limited to helminth infections, such as nematodes (round worms), (Trichuriasis, Enterobiasis, Ascariasis, Hookworm, Strongyloidiasis, Trichinosis, filariasis), trematodes (flukes) (Schistosomiasis, Clonorchiasis), cestodes (tape worms) (Echinococcosis, Taeniasis saginata, Cysticercosis), visceral worms, visceral larva migraines (e.g., Toxocara), eosinophilic gastroenteritis (e.g., Anisaki sp., Phocanema sp.), and cutaneous larva migraines (Ancylostona braziliense, Ancylostoma caninum). In addition, treatment of the aforementioned inflammatory, allergic and autoimmune diseases can also be contemplated for promoters of chemokine receptor function if one contemplates the delivery of sufficient compound to cause the loss of receptor expression on cells through the induction of chemokine receptor internalization or delivery of compound in a manner that results in the misdirection of the migration of cells.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are accordingly useful hi treating, preventing, ameliorating, controlling or reducing the risk of a wide variety of inflammatory and immunoregulatory disorders and diseases, allergic conditions, atopic conditions, as well as autoimmune pathologies. In a specific embodiment, the present invention is directed to the use of the subject compounds for treating, preventing, ameliorating, controlling or reducing the risk of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis.<br>
In another aspect, the instant invention may be used to evaluate putative specific agonists or antagonists of chemokine receptors, including CCR-2. Accordingly, the present invention is directed to the use of these compounds in the preparation and execution of screening assays for compounds that modulate the activity of chemokine receptors. For example, the compounds of this invention are useful for isolating receptor mutants, which are excellent screening tools for more potent compounds. Furthermore, the compounds of this invention are useful in establishing or determining the binding site of other compounds to chemokine receptors, e.g., by competitive inhibition. The compounds of the instant invention are also useful for the evaluation of putative specific modulators of the chemokine receptors, including CCR-2. As appreciated in the art, thorough evaluation of specific agonists and antagonists of the above chemokine receptors has been hampered by the lack of availability of non-peptidyl (metabolically resistant) compounds with high binding affinity for these receptors. Thus the compounds of this invention are commercial products to be sold for these purposes.<br>
The present invention is further directed to a method for the manufacture of a medicament for modulating chemokine receptor activity in hurnans and animals comprising combining a compound of the present invention with a pharmaceutical carrier or diluent.<br>
The present invention is further directed to the use of the present compounds in treating, preventing, ameliorating, controlling or reducing the risk of infection by a retrovirus, in particular, herpes virus or the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the treatment of, and delaying of the onset of consequent pathological conditions such as AIDS. Treating AIDS or preventing or treating infection by HIV is defined as including, but not limited to, treating a wide range of states of HIV infection: AIDS, ARC (AIDS related complex), both symptomatic and asymptomatic, and actual or potential exposure to HIV. For example, the compounds of this invention are useful in treating infection by HIV after suspected past exposure to HIV by, e.g., blood transfusion, organ transplant, exchange of body fluids, bites, accidental needle stick, or exposure to patient blood during surgery.<br>
In a further aspect of the present invention, a subject compound may be used in a method of inhibiting the binding of a chemokine to a chemokine receptor, such as CCR-2, of a target cell, which comprises contacting the target cell with an amount of the compound which is effective at inhibiting the binding of the chemokine to the chemokine receptor.<br>
The subject treated in the methods above is a mammal, preferably a human being, male or female, in whom modulation of chemokine receptor activity is desired. "Modulation" as<br>
used herein is intended to encompass antagonism, agonism, partial antagonism, inverse agonism and/or partial agonism. In a preferred aspect of the present invention, modulation refers to antagonism of chemokine receptor activity. The term "therapeutically effective amount" means the amount of the subject compound that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought by the researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician.<br>
The term "composition" as used herein is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts. By "pharmaceutically acceptable" it is meant the carrier, diluent or excipient must be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.<br>
The terms "administration of and or "administering a" compound should be understood to mean providing a compound of the invention to the individual in need of treatment.<br>
As used herein, the term "treatment" refers both to the treatment and to the prevention or prophylactic therapy of the aforementioned conditions.<br>
Combined therapy to modulate chemokine receptor activity for thereby treating, preventing, ameliorating, controlling or reducing the risk of inflammatory and immunoregulatory disorders and diseases, including asthma and allergic diseases, as well as autoimmune pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis, and those pathologies noted above is illustrated by the combination of the compounds of this invention and other compounds which are known for such utilities.<br>
For example, in treating, preventing, ameliorating, controlling or reducing the risk of inflammation, the present compounds may be used in conjunction with an antiinflammatory or analgesic agent such as an opiate agonist, a lipoxygenase inhibitor, such as an inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, such as a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, an interleukin inhibitor, such as an interleukin-1 inhibitor, an NMDA antagonist, an inhibitor of nitric oxide or an inhibitor of the synthesis of nitric oxide, a non-steroidal antiinflammatory agent, or a cytokine-suppressing antiinflammatory agent, for example with a compound such as acetaminophen, aspirin, codeine, embrel, fentanyl, ibvrprofen, indomethacin, ketorolac, morphine, naproxen, phenacetin, piroxicam, a steroidal analgesic, sufentanyl, sunlindac, tenidap, and the like.

Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for<br>
example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated by the techniques described in the U.S. Patents 4,256,108; 4,166,452; and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release.<br>
Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.<br>
Aqueous suspensions contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxy- propylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethylene-oxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl, p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.<br>
Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.<br>
Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting<br>
agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally- occurring gums, for example gum acacia or gum tragacanth, naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavoring agents.<br>
Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.<br>
For topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing the compounds of the present invention are employed. (For purposes of this application, topical application shall include mouthwashes and gargles.)<br>
The pharmaceutical composition and method of the present invention may further comprise other therapeutically active compounds as noted herein which are usually applied in the treatment of the above mentioned pathological conditions.<br>
In treating, preventing, ameliorating, controlling or reducing the risk of conditions which require chemokine receptor modulation an appropriate dosage level will generally be about 0.01 to 500 mg per kg patient body weight per day which can be administered in single or multiple doses. Preferably, the dosage level will be about 0.1 to about 250 mg/kg per day; more preferably about 0.5 to about 100 mg/kg per day. A suitable dosage level may be about 0.01 to 250 mg/kg per day, about 0.05 to 100 mg/kg per day, or about 0.1 to 50 mg/kg per day. Within this range the dosage may be 0.05 to 0.5, 0.5 to 5 or 5 to 50 mg/kg per day. For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing 1.0 to 1000 milligrams of the active ingredient, preferably 2.0 to 500, more preferably 3.0 to 200, particularly 1, 5, 10,15, 20, 25, 30, 50, 75,100, 125,150, 175, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500,600, 750, 800, 900, and 1000 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 tunes per day, preferably once or twice per day.<br>
It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular patient may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the host undergoing therapy.<br>
Several methods for preparing the compounds of this invention are illustrated in the following Schemes and Examples. Starting materials are either commercially available or made by known procedures in the literature or as illustrated. The present invention further provides processes for the preparation of compounds of the formula I as defined above, which comprises many different sequences of assembling compounds of formula (II), formula (III), and formula (IV), or compounds of formula (VI) and formula (IV), or compounds of formula (VI) and formula (V).<br>

wherein Rl, R3, R4, R5, R6, Rl6; R17, Rl8; A, B, C, D, and Y are defined as in formula I, and R20 represents either a hydrogen or an alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, t-butyl, or benzyl which serves as a protecting group, R21 represent either hydrogen or an amine protecting group (Greene, T; Wuts, P. G. M. Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, NY 1991) such as Boc or trifluoroacetate, R22 represents either hydrogen or a protecting group such as t-butyl, or a group such as -SO2R9, -CO2R9, or CONR9R9, and R23<br>
represents a protecting group such as a trifluoroacetate. The bond between the two carbon atoms where a dashed line is shown in formula III and in formula VI represent either a single or double<br>
bond as defined in formula I.<br>
One general way of constructing target compounds I utilizing Intermediates of<br>
the formulas n, III, and IV is illustrated in Scheme 1. Coupling of the acid IIIa and the amine IV under standard amide bond formation reaction conditions such as PyBrop in the presence of a base such as N,N-diisopropylethylamine and a catalyst such as DMAP gives the intermediate 1-1. Removal of the Boc protecting group yields the amine 1-2. Reductive alkylation of 1-2 with ketones II in the presence of a borohydride such as sodium triacetoxyborohydride or sodium cyanoboorohydride then provides the compound of formula la. Note that when Rl6; R17, orR18 are other than hydrogen, a mixture of diastereomers (Eliel, E. E., Wilen, S. H., Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York) results from the reductive amination step. These can be separated into their components by chromatography using normal phase,<br>
reverse phase or chiral columns, depending on the nature of the separation. Compound Ia can be further elaborated to the compound of the formula I by reductive alkylation with an aldehyde or by alkylation with, for example, an alkyl halide.SCHEME 1<br>
(Formula Removed)An alternative sequence of construction involving fragments of the formulas II, III, and IV is depicted in Scheme 1A. Amine IIIb is reductively alkylated with ketone II in the presence of a borohydride such as sodium triacetoxyborohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride to<br>
give secondary amine 1-3. Protection of the amine group can be accomplished using any of a number of protecting groups, including the trifluoroacetamide group (R23 = COCF3), which can be installed by treatment with trifluoroacetic anhydride in the presence of a base such as triethylamine. The ester functionality of the resulting compound VI is then cleaved using conditions that are dependent upon the nature of R20. For example, a benzyl ester is cleaved by hydrogenolysis using a catalyst such as Pd on carbon to give the fragment of the formula VIa. Coupling of the acid VIa and the amine IV under standard amide bond formation reaction conditions such as PyBrop in the presence of a base such as N,N-diisopropylethylamine and a catalyst such as DMAP gives the intermediate 1-4. Alternatively, the acid VIa can be converted to its corresponding acid chloride and then treated with amine IV in the presence of a base such as triethylamine to give 1-4. Removal of the protecting group (R23) to give compound Ia can be achieved in various ways depending upon the nature of the protecting group. For example the trifluoroacetate group can be removed by treatment with excess sodium borohydride, or by treatment with a base such as lithium hydroxide.<br>
SCHEME 1A<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
Alternatively, Intermediate 1-3 from Scheme 1A can be more directly accessed as shown in Scheme 1B. In this case amine IIIc is reductively alkylated with ketone II in the presence of aborohydride such as sodium triacetoxyborohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride to give secondary amine l-3a. Treatment with a base such as LDA then generates the enolate of 1-3a which can be alkylated with a variety of electrophiles including but not limited to alkyl<br>
halides, aldehydes, ketones. The resulting compound 1-3 can be carried on to compounds of the formula I or Ia, using the same steps as outlined in Scheme 1 A.<br>
SCHEME IB<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In addition to assembly according to Schemes 1, and 1A-1B, compounds of the formula I can be prepared using Intermediates of the formula V and VI (Scheme 2). According to this approach acids of the formula Via are coupled to primary amines V using EDC, or EDC and HO At, or by first forming the acid chlorides with oxalyl chloride, among other methods. The resulting amides 2-1 are deprotected if B has a protecting group, R22, for example if BR22 is O-t-butyl, then TFA or HC1 in dioxane may be used to remove the t-butyl group. After deprotection, or if no deprotection is required, treatment with paraformaldehyde (or another formaldehyde source) and an acid catalyst such as TsOH accomplishes cyclization to give intermediates 1-4 (Scheme 1 A). Alternatively, 2-1 may be treated with phosgene to afford compounds 1-4. These then are converted as shown previously into final chemokine modulators.<br>
SCHEME 2<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
fragment III can be prepared in a number of ways. One of those is depicted in Schemes 3, 3a, and 3b. According to Scheme 3, the commercially available homochiral lactam 3-1 is hydrogenated and the saturated 3-2 is treated with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate in the presence of a suitable catalyst, e.g. N,N-dimethylamino pyridine. A base catalyzed cleavage of the amide bond in the presence of a suitable alcohol R20-OH then provides the respective ester IIId. The BOC-protecting group is removed, preferably with an acid such as HC1 in a aprotic solvent, such as dioxane, to yield the amine IIIe in the form of a salt. When this amine is mixed with benzophenone imine, the respective Schiff base 3-4 is formed, which can be obtained in pure form by simple filtration to remove ammonium chloride.<br>
SCHEME 3<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The enolate formed from ester 3-4 with a strong base, such as LDA can be reacted with alkyl halides Rl-X, as well as aldehydes RlaCHO or ketones RlaR2acO to obtain intermediates 3-5, 3-6 and 3-7, 3-8, respectively (Scheme 3A). These reactions produce a mixture of the respective cis- (3-5 and 3-7) and trans- (3-6 and 3-8) diastereoisomers, which can be separated by a suitable chromatography. In most cases, normal phase flash chromatography on deactivated silica gel can be applied with success.<br>
SCHEME 3A<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
The desired cis diastereoisomers 3-5 and 3-7 are then treated with an acid such as HC1 to aid hydrolysis of the imine group and the resulting amino group IIIf can be suitably protected e.g. in a form of a tert-butoxycarbonyl amide (Scheme 3B). The ester group present in intermediates IIIg can then be cleaved to give acid IIIh. The applied procedure depends on the nature of the ester: e.g. a benzyl ester can be cleaved by hydrogenolysis, a tert-butyl ester under acidic conditions and a alkyl ester can be hydrolyzed under either acidic or basic conditions.<br>
SCHEME 3B<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
Note that Compound IIIh can be used in place of IIIa in Scheme 1, IIIf can be used in place of IIIb in Scheme 1A, and IIIe can be used in place of IIIc in Scheme 1B (the only differences being that the cyclopentane rings are defined as being fully saturated). An alternative way of preparing compounds of the type III is shown in Scheme 3C. According to this route, commercially available IIIi is converted to ester IIIj using an appropriate alcohol such as methyl or benzyl alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst. Protection of the amine in IIIj by treatment with Boc2O results in IIIk. Alkylation using a base such as lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LiHMDS) and an electrophile such as an alkyl halide gives IIII, where the major diastereomer obtained is normally the cis-l,3-isonier. Separation of the cis/trans isomers can be carried out at this point or after the following step using column chromatography. If desired, hydrogenation using a catalysts such as Pd/C gives IIIm. If R20 is benzyl, hydrogenation of IIIm would directly furnish IIIn. Otherwise, IIIm can be hydrolyzed using various conditions such as treatment with NaOH to give IIIn.<br>
SCHEME 3C<br><br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Amines of the formula V could be prepared in several ways. One approach is shown in Scheme 4. Fluorides 4-1 (either commercially available or prepared as detailed in the experimental section) could be treated with P22BH (such as ammonia, methanesulfonamide, t-butylthiol, t-butyl alcohol) in the presence of a base such as NaH to give 4-2 arising from nucleophilic aromatic substitution. The nitrile groups could then be reduced under various conditions, such as by Raney Ni and hydrogen gas or by borane, giving amines Va.<br>
SCHEME 4<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Ainines of the type represented by formula IV were prepared on an individual basis and details for their preparation can be found in the Experimental section.<br>
Compounds of the type represented by fragment II were often commercially available, but sometimes required preparation. For example, compounds IIa (Scheme 5) where X is either CH2, S, O, orNP (P=protecting group), and R17 and R18 are both hydrogen, are commercially available. Compounds can be easily modified to IIb, having Rl6 groups, where R16 is an alkyl group, by deprotonation with a base such as LDA and alkylation with an alkyl halide (for a published procedure involving tetrahydropyran-4-one see J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1991, 113, 2079-2089). Compounds IIb can be incorporated into final target compounds as shown in the preceding Schemes.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
SCHEME 5<br><br>
A synthesis of ketones IIc where R16 is an alkoxy group is detailed in Scheme 5A. According to this,, commercially available 5,6-dihydro-4-methoxy-2H-pyran (5-1) is treated with m-chloroperbenzoic acid in methanol to affect direct conversion to 5-2. An alkylation of the secondary alcohol with an appropriate alkyl halide R25x in a presence of a base such as sodium hydride affords the ether 5-3. Deprotection of the acetal under acidic conditions affords the desired ketones IIc. In this manner, a number of 3-alkoxyderivatives can be synthesized. Further details, as well as examples are described in the Experimental section.<br>
SCHEME 5A(Formula Removed)<br>
Alternatively, Intermediates 5-2 can be prepared in an asymmetric fashion according to Scheme 5C. Enol benzoate 5-4 can be prepared from ketone IId by trapping the enolate generated upon treatment with abase such as KHMDS with benzoic anhydride. Asymmetric oxidation can be accomplished according to the conditions described by Yian Shi, et al, (J. Org. Chem.., 2001, 66,1818-1826) to give 5-6 as predominantly a single isomer. Ring opening of the epoxide and generation of the dimethyl acetal occurs in one pot by treatment with an acid such as CSA in methanol to give 5-2a. Either enantiomer of 5-2 could be obtained by appropriate choice of the sugar catalyst 5-5.<br>

The combined organic phases were dried over sodium sulfate and evaporated. The residue was purified by flash chromatography (10% EtOAc/hexane) to yield the title compound as a mixture of cis and trans .isomers (~1:1, 24 g).
