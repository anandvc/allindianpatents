				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a helicopter construction having safety provision for its protection and particularly for saving the lives of the passengers in the event of an accident BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention resolves the half century old problem of seeking a method of saving a helicopter from free falling to the ground in an accident<br>
The capability of a helicopter in lifting off vertically from the ground and traveling horizontally over a long distance and then landing vertically again at the destination has greatly changed the traditional concept of having to provide a runway for an air plane to taking off and landing. This concept is ideal in air transportation. Only a relatively much smaller ground area is required for the helicopter to take off or land Thus, air transportation may be achieved quickly in any emergency, for example, in the transportation of patients, rescuing lives in a flood disaster, fire fighting in a forest area not accessible to land vehicles, in engineering and military operations.<br>
In the second world war, [lived in a village in Taiwan which was under the Japanese occupation, and I was attending primary school A Japanese military airfield was located close to my home The Japanese army placed many decoys of air planes in the air field in order to distract the American air offence. The decoys having the same physical size as the real air planes were made with bamboo and tarpaulin The primary school students were often ordered by the Japanese army to move and vary the positions of the decoys. It was a new and surprising experience for the primary students to marvel at the grand scale of this large operation and the vastness of the runway In the evening my friend used bamboo material to make a dragonfly toy which could operate to fly vertically upwards and then horizontally forwards and eventually to fall safely and vertically downwards. I was much marveled in<br><br>
witnessing the capability of such toy after seeing the vast runway built with much engineering operations. It pointed out to me that an air plane could take off vertically, fly horizontally, and land vertically without requiring a runway for take off and landing. I picked up the dragonfly toy and dashed home with my friend to tell my family that all air planes should be constructed the same way as the dragonfly toy to achieve the same capability. Shortly after, my home town and the air field were attacked and destroyed by the American offense, and the event of the dragonfly toy has now been forgotten for fifty-seven years<br>
Helicopter is an air traveling means which meets all transportation requirements It is a product of much study and constant improvements and it is utilized for a large variety of air operations throughout the world. It's construction is similar to automobiles and its building material and construction comply with modem industrial standards However, similar to the aging of human, sometimes accident does occur in which helicopters weighing several tons including passengers do fall to the ground in the accident and there is frequent news of helicopter accident with fatality The reason for such disaster is that human is unable to build infallible helicopters that can resist bad weather conditions The present invention provides the means for safe lift off and landing of a helicopter People regard the modem day helicopter as a mere half developed product, because it has no provision of resolving the severe problem of safety in an accident when the helicopter is flying high in the sky. It is a well accepted fact that any machine would sometimes break down. The integrity of the machine is determined by the number of times it would break down, however, the number would never be zero When a heavy object loses its flying power in the sky, it would fall directly onto the ground, and the sad result in such event is really unimaginable. If such problem can be resolved, it would fulfill the hope of human as if having an angel standing by the wing of the flying machine to safeguard the lives of the passengers, so that people would<br><br>
accept the safe transportation by a helicopter rather than regarding it as a specialized dangerous machine made of steel Only with the resolution of such problem the helicopter can meet the general good expectation such that it may be regarded as a perfect helicopter or a century 2000 perfectly safe helicopter. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has been determined with careful consideration that when trouble occurs in the either the engine, electrical power, the body structure or loss of control by the pilot, during flight of the helicopter, in order to protect its passengers and the transported goods, the simplest method is by using parachutes to support the helicopter for landing it safely on the ground The parachutes would suspense the body of the helicopter in such event to reduce its falling speed and then landing speed reduction jets may be utilized to further reduce its fall to a safe speed when it is less than a hundred meters from the ground. One main problem of such concept is that a large propeller is used by a helicopter. The propeller covers over a large portion of the helicopter such that it is not feasible to deploy a parachute directly from its body top, as the parachute would readily be severed by the propeller. The above problem has been alleviated by three methods according to the present invention, depending on the size and the purpose of utilization of the helicopter. Any one method may be selected to meet weight design or cost consideration They totally resolve the critical problem pointed above<br>
Furthermore, an air bag is provided on the helicopter to safeguard it when it lands on water. The air bag is inflated by high pressure air cylinders provided in the helicopter to maintain its floatation on water to await for rescue. A tubular gasket is provided between the exit door and the door frame. The tubular gasket may be inflated either by automatic or manual inflation means to provide a leak-proof joints between the door and the door frame such that no water may leak through thejoint into the interior cabin of the helicopter Two<br><br>
elongated inflatable air bags are mounted on both sides of the helicopter such that when they are inflated they would maintain the helicopter floating on the water like a submarine while waiting for rescue<br>
Closure traps are provided at the engine exhaust and the air conditioning vent to prevent water from entering the helicopter through these outlets. The only air communication with the outside atmosphere is provided by a steel air tube located at the top of the helicopter body The air tube may be raised or lower similar to a periscope in a submarine. The dp of the air tube is provided with a cutting edge usable for cutting the parachute if the latter covers over the helicopter The air tube may be extended above the waves to vent fresh air supply to the passengers inside the helicopter<br>
Speed reduction jets are provided at the belly portion of the helicopter adjacent to the landing wheels These jets may be ignited to further reduce the falling speed of the helicopter when it is a short distance from the ground so as to provide a safe landing. The duration of the ignition of the jets may be predetermined such that their fuel would be depleted to distinguish their ignition when the helicopter touches the ground so that it would not cause any fire hazard to the parachute. Additional fire extinguishing means directed at the jets may be provided to reduce the possibility of fire hazard due to the ignition of the jets or any other causes.

(3) The main parachute is installed in a container provided at the top of the drive shaft It is<br>
determined according to the present invention that for smaller helicopters the parachute may<br>
be provided at the top end of the propeller drive shaft The design is to place the parachute in<br>
an inner box 36 which has a circular top cover and a circular bottom base similar to a circular<br>
cookie box Rollers are provided between the external container and the top cover and<br><br>
circular bottom base of the inner box such that the external container may rotate relative to the inner box. The rotatable base 45 of the inner box is provided with the mounting ring for securing the parachute, but it is rotatable independent of the external container. The external container is mounted to the drive shaft and is rotatable directly with the latter. The external container provides protection of the inner box. The cover of the external container is normally locked in place with six electromagnetic latches 4]   When an accident occurs, the electromagnetic latches are unlatched and simultaneously four explosive installations 40 are ignited to force open the cover of the external container, and since the cover of the inner box is connected to the cover of the external container, it will also be forced open. In this manner, the parachute which is connected to the mounting ring 37 of the drive shaft is deployed. The electrical power for activating the electromagnetic latches is conducted to the latches through a carbon rod 42 contacting with a rotatable copper ring 43. The ignition of the explosive causes an annular projection ring to push upwards at the projecting circular flange 36A of the inner box cover, thus in a chain action the parachute located in the inner box is deployed instantly With such provision, the present invention has resolved the past problem of being unable to safe lives in an air accident when the helicopter is in flight<br>
