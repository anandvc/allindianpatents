				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SUPPORTING NON-VOICE SIGNAL SUCH AS<br>
FACSIMILE AND<br>
COMPRESSED VOICE OVER A DIGITAL WIRELESS LINK<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to data transmission systems.<br>
More particularly, the invention relates to a method and apparatus for sending<br>
voice data such as, for example, facsimile and compressed voice signals over a<br>
digital wireless link.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
There are many types of data communication systems in the art for<br>
transmitting facsimile, audio, video and data signals. In addition, cordless<br>
telephone systems have become enormously popular, offering flexibility and<br>
convenience unequaled by traditional corded telephone systems.<br>
Cordless telephone systems use digital signal processing for processing<br>
voice signals prior to transmission. Once the voice signal is digitized, a cordless<br>
telephone system compresses the digitized voice signal using a voice<br>
compression algorithm or technique that is based on a speech model. To<br>
conserve bandwidth over the digital wireless link (or RF link) and maintain a<br>
reasonable speech quality, the compression algorithm operates at compression<br>
ratios between two and ten.<br>
As cordless telephone systems are enormously popular, it is desirable to<br>
incorporate additional features in these systems, such as coupling facsimile<br>
machines to a cordless handset or producing a cordless facsimile machine.<br>
However, facsimile machines do not process data using a speech model as is<br>
used in cordless telephone systems. If a speech model that is applied to the<br>
voice compression algorithm used in existing cordless telephone systems were to<br>
be applied to facsimile data, the facsimile data would become distorted.<br>
Data communications systems that combine voice and data, such as<br>
facsimile, are known in the art. Davis et al, in U.S. Patent No. 5,764,628 and<br>
Davis et al, in U.S. Patent No. 5,812,534 are two examples of such systems.<br>
However, these systems require dedicated lines or channels to separately<br>
transmit voice and facsimile data and are not applicable to cordless telephone<br>
systems.<br>
Therefore, a need exists in the art for combining the wireless transmission<br>
of non-voice data such as facsimile signals with the wireless transmission of<br>
compressed voice signals in cordless telephone systems.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention overcomes the disadvantages associated with the prior art<br>
by providing a method and apparatus for transmitting non-voice data such as<br>
facsimile signals over the same wireless or radio frequency (RF) link used for<br>
transmitting compressed voice signals. The invention segments a facsimile<br>
signal into a format that is similar to a compressed voice signal. The segmented<br>
portions of the facsimile signal are separately transmitted through the wireless<br>
link. As such, the invention may transmit facsimile and/or compressed voice<br>
signals over a wireless link without distortion.<br>
Specifically, the inventive apparatus comprises a base station and a<br>
remote station. The base station comprises a signal converter for converting<br>
facsimile and compressed voice signals from a telephone network respectively<br>
into a converted facsimile signal and a converted voice signal, a voice processor<br>
coupled to the signal converter for compressing the converted voice signal, a<br>
data splitter coupled to the signal converter for segmenting the converted<br>
facsimile signal, and a modem coupled to the voice compressor and the data<br>
splitter for transmitting the converted voice and facsimile signals via a wireless<br>
link to the remote station. The remote station receives these signals from the<br>
base station, and converts voice and facsimile signals in a reverse manner to that<br>
of the base station, i.e., the segmented facsimile signals are combined into a<br>
digital facsimile signal, the digital facsimile signal and the compressed voice<br>
signal are processed to form analog voice and facsimile signals. As such, the<br>
remote station may be or may contain a wireless facsimile machine and/or a<br>
cordless telephone handset having a facsimile machine connected thereto. The<br>
base station and remote station contain complementary circuitry that provides<br>
full duplex facsimile and voice communications over the wireless link.<br>

common to the figures.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
FIG. 1 depicts a system level block diagram of an end-to-end system 100<br>
for providing facsimile transmission and compressed voice transmissions through<br>
a wireless link. The end-to-end system 100 comprises a base station 200 and<br>
the remote station 400 that communicate with one another in a full duplex<br>
manner. The base station 200 receives facsimile or voice signals from,<br>
illustratively, a Plain Old Telephone System (POTS) 50 and processes the<br>
facsimile or voice signal for transmission to the wireless link via an antenna 201.<br>
The remote station 400 receives the transmitted facsimile or voice signal via an<br>
antenna 401. To receive facsimile output at the remote station 400, a facsimile<br>
device 102 or facsimile machine is coupled to the remote station 400.<br>
Additionally, to receive a voice transmission at the remote station 400, a<br>
telephone handset 104 is provided.<br>
Other variations of the end-to-end system 100 include having the facsimile<br>
device 102 embedded within the remote station 400. Also, the handset 104<br>
may be connected to the remote station 400. Other base stations 200 and 400<br>
for receiving facsimile and voice data from a digital network are possible. Those<br>
skilled in the art will recognize that other variations of the end-to-end station 100<br>
are also contemplated to be within the scope of the invention.<br>
FIG. 2 depicts a high level block diagram of the base station 200 that is<br>
adapted to communicate with an analog telephone network such as the<br>
ubiquitous POTS network 50. The base station 200 may operate as a<br>
transmitter and/or as a receiver. In a transmitter mode of operation, the base<br>
station 200 receives voice and/or facsimile data from the POTS network 50,<br>
processes the received POTS data, and transmits the processed POTS data to a<br>
remote station 400 via a wireless link. Alternatively, in a receiver mode of<br>
operation, the base station 200 receives voice and/or facsimile data from the<br>
remote station 400 via the wireless link, processes the received facsimile and<br>
voice data and couples the processed data to the POTS network 50. The<br>
operation of the remote station 400 will be described in more detail below with<br>
respect to FIG. 4.<br>
Specifically, the base station 200 of FIG. 2 comprises a linear codec 202,<br>
a voice compressor/decompressor 204, a facsimile compander/ expander 206, a<br>
facsimile data splitter/ combiner 208, a radio frequency (RF) multi-channel<br>
modem 210 and an antenna 201. As the base station 200 may transmit and<br>
receive facsimile and compressed voice signals from the digital wireless link, the<br>
signal paths between base station 200 components are shown with bi-directional<br>
arrows to illustrate complementary functions. For example, the modem 210<br>
modulates signals produced by the voice compressor/decompressor 204 and by<br>
the data splitter/combiner 208 for RF transmission via the antenna 201. The<br>
modem 210 also demodulates a RF signal received by the antenna 201. Other<br>
components within the base station 200 may also operate in receive and<br>
transmit modes, as will now be discussed.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, the linear codec or linear coder-decoder 202 receives<br>
either facsimile or voice signal from a POTS network 50. Unless the POTS<br>
network 50 is specifically programmed to simultaneously transmit facsimile and<br>
compressed voice signals on a single telephone line to the codec 202, the POTS<br>
network 50 generally propagates only one type of signal at any one time. The<br>
linear codec 202 samples either the received facsimile or compressed voice<br>
signals at, illustratively, an 8 kHz sampling rate using a 14-bit analog to digital<br>
converter (ADC). The linear codec 202 operates as a signal converter that<br>
converts the received signals into digital form. The converted signals are coupled<br>
to the voice compressor/ decompressor 204 via signal path S1 and coupled to<br>
the compander/ expander 206 via signal path S5. Signal paths S1 and S5<br>
convey, illustratively, 112 kilobits per second (Kbps) digital data streams.<br>
The voice compressor/decompressor 204 compresses the converted voice<br>
data according to, illustratively, the G.727 standard (International<br>
Telecommunications Union Recommendation G.727) to produce a compressed<br>
voice signal, illustratively a 32 Kbps data stream, that is coupled to the modem<br>
210 via signal path S2. The voice compressor/ decompressor 204 operates as a<br>
voice signal processor.<br>
The compander 206 compands the converted facsimile data according to,<br>
illustratively, the G.711 standard (International Telecommunications Union<br>
Recommendation G.711) to produce a 64 Kbps data stream that is coupled to<br>
the data splitter 208 via signal path S4.<br>
The data splitter 208 or signal segmenter splits or segments the<br>
companded 64 Kbps facsimile data stream into two 32 Kbps data streams or<br>
segments that are coupled to the RF multi-channel modem 210 via signal path<br>
S3. As the companded facsimile data is transmitted at twice the data rate than<br>
compressed voice data, thereby requiring twice the bandwidth as compressed<br>
voice data, the data splitter 208 segments the companded facsimile data into a<br>
format suitable for transmitting compressed voice data. Specifically, the signal<br>
segmenter segments a facsimile signal into a plurality of segmented facsimile<br>
signals, where each segmented facsimile signal occupies a bandwidth that is less<br>
than or equal to a bandwidth of the compressed voice signal. Although<br>
segmentation may occur at the bit level (e.g., every other bit), byte level or<br>
packet level, other implementations are contemplated within the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
Since facsimile data requires approximately twice the bandwidth of voice<br>
data, the base station 200 must allocate additional bandwidth for transmitting<br>
the facsimile data over the wireless link. The bandwidth allocation depends on<br>
whether the base station 200 uses time division multiplexing (TDM) or frequency<br>
division multiplexing (FDM) for transmitting facsimile and voice data over the<br>
wireless link. If the base station 200 uses TDM, then the base station 200<br>
allocates a greater number of time slots for facsimile data (e.g., twice the<br>
number allocated for voice data). Alternatively, if the base station 200 uses<br>
FDM, then the base station 200 allocates a greater number of frequency bands<br>
or codes for facsimile data (i.e., twice the number allocated for voice data). To<br>
simplify the allocation of twice as many time or frequency bands to facsimile<br>
data as to voice data, the facsimile data is split into two data streams. Thus, by<br>
allocating the same number of time or frequency bands to each of the voice data<br>
stream, first facsimile data stream and second facsimile data stream, the<br>
facsimile data will inherently receive twice the time or frequency band allocation.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other divisions of data<br>
(e.g., a factor of three or four) may be effected to further increase the bandwidth<br>
allocation to the facsimile data. Additionally, the base station 200 may use other<br>
multiplexing techniques, such as code division multiplexing (CDM), for<br>
transmitting facsimile and voice data streams<br>
The modem 210 modulates the compressed voice signal as well as the<br>
previously split or segmented facsimile signal for transmission over the wireless<br>
link. The modem 210 may modulate these signals using FDM, TDM or CDM.<br>
The modulated voice and facsimile signals are transmitted to the wireless link via<br>
the antenna 201.<br>
The base station 200 in FIG. 2 may also receive modulated facsimile and<br>
cordless voice signals from the remote station via the wireless link. In the<br>
receive mode of operation, the modem 210 receives the RF modulated facsimile<br>
and/or voice signals from the remote station and demodulates these signals. The<br>
demodulated signals are coupled to the voice decompressor 204 via signal path<br>
S2 and to the data combiner 208 via signal path S3.<br>
The decompressor 204 decompresses the demodulated voice signal while<br>
the data combiner 208 combines the demodulated facsimile signals. These<br>
functions are the reverse of that previously discussed for the base station 200 in<br>
the transmitter mode. The decompressed voice signal is coupled with the linear<br>
codec 202 via signal path S1 while the combined facsimile data is coupled with<br>
the expander 206 via signal path S4. The expander 206 expands the combined<br>
signal, which is also coupled to the linear codec 202 via signal path S5. The<br>
codec 202 operates in the receiver mode as a 14-bit digital to analog converter<br>
(DAC) to convert the decompressed voice signal and expanded facsimile signal to<br>
analog inputs into the POTS network 50.<br>
FIG. 3 depicts a high level block diagram of a base station 300 that is<br>
adapted to communicate with a digital telephone network 60. In contrast to the<br>
POTS network 50, the digital telephone network 60 may simultaneously transmit<br>
facsimile and compressed voice signals. As such, the base station 300 may also<br>
simultaneously receive and/or transmit facsimile and compressed voice signals.<br>
The base station 300, as with the base station of FIG. 2, operates as a<br>
transceiver having a transmitter mode and a receiver mode.<br>
The base station 300 of FIG. 3 includes a cable modem or digital<br>
subscriber line (DSL) modem 302, an encoder/decoder 304, a voice compressor<br>
306, a data splitter/combiner 308, a RF multi-channel modem 310 and an<br>
antenna 301. These components also operate in a bi-directional, full duplex<br>
manner, such as previously described with respect to the components of the<br>
base station 200 of FIG. 2.<br>
The cable modem or DSL modem 302 receives facsimile and voice signals<br>
from the digital telephone network 60 through, illustratively, a coaxial cable or<br>
twisted wire pair medium. The modem or signal converter 302 decodes the<br>
received signals and couples the decoded signals to the encoder/decoder 304 via<br>
signal path S6 and to the data splitter 308 via signal path S10.<br>
Unlike base station 200 of FIG. 2, the voice signal processor in this<br>
embodiment of the base station 300 either compresses or decompresses the<br>
decoded voice data in two distinct stages. First, the encoder/decoder 304<br>
decodes the voice signal received from the digital network 60. Then the voice<br>
compressor/decompressor 306 compresses the decoded voice data and couples<br>
the decompressed and decoded voice data to the modem 310. The<br>
encoder/decoder 304 and compressor/decompressor 306 combination operates<br>
as a voice processor.<br>
The encoder/decoder 304 operates as either a compressor/ decompressor<br>
or as a compander/expander. If the received voice data has been subjected to<br>
compression, then the encoder/decoder 304 operates to decompress the received<br>
voice data. Similarly, if the received voice data has been subjected to<br>
companding, then the encoder/decoder 304 operates to expand the received<br>
voice data. The resulting decompressed or expanded voice signal is coupled to<br>
the voice compressor 306 via signal path S7.<br>
The compressor 306 compresses the previously decompressed or<br>
expanded voice data and couples the compressed voice data to the RF multi-<br>
channel modem 310 via signal path S8.<br>
The data splitter 308 or signal segmenter receives the decoded facsimile<br>
data stream, illustratively, 64 Kbps, from the modem 302, and splits or<br>
segments the decoded facsimile into two 32 Kbps data streams for subsequent<br>
transport over the wireless link. Each of the segmented facsimile streams<br>
occupies a bandwidth that is less than or equal to a bandwidth of the<br>
compressed voice signal. The resulting "split" or segmented facsimile signals are<br>
coupled to the RF multi-channel modem 310 via signal path S9. Note that this<br>
embodiment of the base station 300 does not include a compander/expander, as<br>
the facsimile data is generally received from the digital network 60 in a<br>
companded state.<br>
The modem 310 modulates the compressed voice signal received via<br>
signal path S8 and the split or segmented facsimile signal received via signal path<br>
S9 in substantially the same manner as described above with respect to the<br>
modem 210 of FIG. 2. The antenna 301 transmits the modulated voice and<br>
facsimile signals over the wireless link.<br>
FIG. 4 depicts a high level block diagram of a remote station 400 suitable<br>
for use with either of the base stations 200 and 300 depicted, respectively, in<br>
FIG. 2 and FIG. 3. As such, the remote station 400 may receive facsimile and<br>
voice signals previously transmitted by the base station 200 or 300 over the<br>
wireless link. The block diagram for the remote station 400 includes<br>
substantially the same components as the block diagram for the base station 200<br>
shown in FIG. 2.<br>
As with the base stations 200 and 300, the remote station 400 operates<br>
as a transceiver having both a receive mode and a transmit mode. In a receive<br>
mode of operation, the remote station 400 receives voice and/or facsimile data<br>
from a base station 200 or 300, processes the received data and provides the<br>
processed data at an analog input/output port for subsequent use by a facsimile<br>
machine, answering machine or person. In a transmit mode of operation, the<br>
remote station 400 receives voice and/or facsimile signal via the input/output<br>
port, processes the received signal and couples the processed signal to the base<br>
station 200 or 300 via RF transmission.<br>
Specifically, the remote station 400 includes a linear codec 402, a voice<br>
decompressor/compressor 404, an expander/compander 406, a data<br>
combiner/splitter 408, a RF multi-channel modem 410 and an antenna 401.<br>
These components are also bi-directional, full duplex, as the remote station 400<br>
will convert data in the reverse direction if applied for transmitting facsimile and<br>
compressed voice signals over the wireless link.<br>
The modem 410 receives the transmitted facsimile and voice data signals<br>
through the antenna 401. The modem 410 demodulates the received facsimile<br>
and voice signals into, illustratively, 32 Kbps signals. The modem 410 couples<br>
the demodulated signals to the voice decompressor/compressor 404 via signal<br>
path S11 and to the data combiner/ expander 408 via signal path S15.<br>
The voice decompressor/compressor 404 decompresses the demodulated<br>
voice signal into, illustratively, a 112 Kbps data stream. This decompression is<br>
the complementary to the compression performed by the voice compressor 204.<br>
The voice decompressor/compressor 404, which operates as a voice processor,<br>
couples the decompressed voice signal to the linear codec 402 via signal path<br>
S12.<br>
The data combiner/splitter 408 combines at least two 32 Kbps<br>
demodulated and previously segmented facsimile signals into a 64 Kbps signal.<br>
The data combiner/splitter 408 couples the combined facsimile signal to the<br>
expander/compander 406 via signal path S14. The expander/compander 406<br>
expands the combined signals into, illustratively, a 112 Kbps data stream and<br>
couples the expanded facsimile signal to the linear codec 402 via signal path<br>
S13. The data combiner/ splitter 408 and expander/compander 406 combination<br>
operates as a facsimile processor as with the base station 200.<br>
The linear codec 402 operates, illustratively, as a 14-bit digital-to-analog<br>
converter (DAC) running at 8 kHz. In this mode, the codec 402 converts the<br>
compressed voice signal and expanded facsimile signal into analog signal inputs.<br>
As such, one or more remote facsimile machines 102 or telephone handsets<br>
104 can be coupled to the output of the remote station 400.<br>
The remote station 400 may also transmit facsimile and digital cordless<br>
voice data signals in the reverse outgoing direction to the wireless link. In this<br>
transmit mode, the remote station 400 components operate in the reverse<br>
manner to the remote station 400 in the receive mode. The operation of the<br>
remote station 400 in the transmit mode is substantially the same as the base<br>
station 200 of FIG. 2 in the transmit mode, as voice data is compressed and<br>
facsimile data is companded. Specifically, the remote station 400 compresses<br>
the voice data signal at, illustratively, 32 Kbps to the wireless link. In the case<br>
of facsimile data, the remote station 400 compands, illustratively, at 64 Kbps, to<br>
the wireless link, since the facsimile signal uses twice the bandwidth of the voice<br>
signal.<br>
FIG. 5 depicts a high level block diagram of a base station 500 adapted to<br>
communicate with a digital telephone system or digital network 60 that uses a<br>
single voice compression/decompression technique for both the wireless link and<br>
the digital network 60. In contrast to the base station 300 shown in FIG. 3, the<br>
voice compression techniques are the same for transmission to the wireless link<br>
and to the digital network 60. As such, the incoming voice signal to the base<br>
station 500 is in a compressed state suitable for transmission over the wireless<br>
link. The voice signal compressor for this base station 500 is, in essence, a<br>
unity compressor, as there are no separate compression modules for the digital<br>
network 60 or the wireless link.<br>
Specifically, the base station 500 includes a Cable or Digital Signal Line<br>
(DSL) modem 502, a data splitter/combiner 504, a RF multi-channel modem 506<br>
and an antenna 501. As with the other base stations 200 and 300, the<br>
components of this base station 500 are bi-directional depending on whether the<br>
base station 500 operates as a transmitter or as a receiver. The base station<br>
500 may also simultaneously transmit facsimile and compressed voice data.<br>
In a receiver mode of operation, the cable modem or DSL modem 502,<br>
which operates as a signal converter, decodes the facsimile and compressed<br>
voice signals from the digital network 60. The cable modem or DSL modem 502<br>
couples the decoded voice signal to the RF multi-channel modem 506 via signal<br>
path S16 and couples the decoded facsimile signal to the data splitter via signal<br>
path S18.<br>
The data splitter 504 or signal segmenter splits or segments the decoded<br>
facsimile signal into smaller data streams and couples the RF multi-channel<br>
modem 506 via signal path S17. Each of the segmented data streams occupies<br>
a bandwidth that is less than or equal to a bandwidth for a compressed voice<br>
signal. The modem 506 modulates the decoded compressed voice signal and<br>
segmented facsimile signal, where the modulated signals are coupled to the<br>
wireless link via the antenna 501.<br>
The base station 500 may receive facsimile and compressed voice signals<br>
from the wireless link as with the other base stations 200 and 300. The signal<br>
conversions are the reverse than of the base station 500 in a receiver mode. In<br>
addition, the remote station 400 is suitable for use with this base station 500.<br>
Advantageously, the invention transmits facsimile data over the same<br>
wireless link used for transmitting compressed voice data. It is specifically noted<br>
that the slotted transmission architecture may be adapted to provide varying<br>
bandwidth allocation of the processed facsimile and compressed voice signals. It<br>
is also noted that while a single voice channel and a single facsimile channel are<br>
depicted, multiple voice and/or facsimile (or other data) channels may be<br>
employed within the context of the invention.<br>
The numerical values used herein are only examples. As these values are<br>
not intended as being limiting, other values and standards are contemplated to be<br>
within the scope of the invention.<br>
Although various embodiments which incorporate the teachings of the<br>
present invention have been shown and described in detail herein, those skilled in<br>
the art can readily devise many other varied embodiments that still incorporate<br>
these teachings.<br>
