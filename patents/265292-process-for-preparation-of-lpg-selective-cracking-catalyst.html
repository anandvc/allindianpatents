				<td>PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF LPG SELECTIVE CRACKING<br>
CATALYST FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a cracking catalyst suitable for enhancing yield of C3 to C4 hydrocarbons, which are major constituents of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The invention particularly relates to a catalyst composition comprising alumina, silica, silica-alumina with clay phosphate binder for cracking heavy residual hydrocarbon feed. In addition, the present invention relates to preparation of said catalyst composition. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART OF THE INVENTION<br>
Catalytic cracking today constitutes several refining processes in which heavier hydrocarbons are cracked into lighter useful products. They are fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), hydrocracking, reforming, etc. FCC process is simple and highly flexible, as required product slate can be obtained independent of feed and hardware through tailoring of catalyst.<br>
The earliest catalysts used for fixed bed cracking were based on acid reacted clays. The exigencies imposed during the Second World War provided required acceleration to the concept and growth of moving bed catalytic cracking process. This process demanded more rugged catalysts than activated clays. Demand for this was met by more active silica alumina gel based synthetic catalysts, which provided an improved physical stability, and greater selectivity.<br>
Grinding and screening methods were used to produce catalyst particles of required size. Later, spray-drying technique produced catalyst particles of required size and with improved attrition resistance suitable for fluid bed reactor systems.<br>
Introduction of silica-magnesia based matrix provided greater selectivity towards the production of middle distillates than silica-alumina based catalysts. One of the most significant developments in the area of cracking catalyst was the introduction of crystalline inorganic synthetic products called "Y zeolites".<br>
The "Y zeolites" have discrete pores in the range 6.5 to 13.5Â°A, higher surface area and higher acidity as compared to the amorphous silica-alumina based catalysts thereby generating higher catalytic activity and much more selectivity towards gasoline.<br>
Later on, by employing rare earth exchanged Y zeolites and ultra stable Y zeolites, many active and stable catalysts were developed.<br>
Along with the introduction of highly stable cracking components like zeolites in different forms, in the past, there have been gradual improvements in binder system used for binding these crystalline materials into attrition resistant microspheres.<br>
Discovery of medium pore high silica zeolite and it's application in cracking catalyst process offers required impetus in shifting product selectivity from gasoline and middle distillate to C3-C4 hydrocarbons with increased octane number has been described in US Pat. Nos. 3,702,886, 4,828,679 and 5,389,232.<br>
Binding of low soda Y zeolite with gel alumina and polysilicate has been described in US Pat. Nos. 4,333,857 and 4,326,993.<br>
US Pat, No. 4,309,280 describes a process for maximizing yield of LPG by adding very small amounts of powdered, neat ZSM-5 catalyst, characterized by a particle size below 5 microns to the FCC catalyst inventory.<br>
US Pat. No. 5,997,728 refers to a process for catalytically cracking of a heavy feed in a FCC unit, with large amounts of shape selective cracking additive. The catalyst inventory preferably contains at least 10 wt % additives, of 12-40% ZSM-5 on an amorphous support, equivalent to more than 3.0 wt % ZSM-5 crystals circulating with equilibrium catalyst. This process yields large amount of light olefins, without excessive production of aromatics, or loss of gasoline yield.<br>
US Pat. No. 6,137,022 discloses a process of making an olefin product from an oxygenated feedstock by contacting the feedstock in a reaction zone containing 15 volume percent or less of a catalyst, preferably a catalyst comprising a silica-alumina-phosphate molecular sieve.<br>
A process for jointly producing butene-1 and ether in a catalytic distillation column, which comprises an upper catalytic zone for etherification and a lower catalytic zone for isomerisation of C3 to C4olefins and conversion of butadiene has been described in US Pat. No. 6,156,947.<br>
US Pat. No. 6,258,257 refers to a process for producing polypropylene from C3 olefins by a two-stage fluid catalytic cracking process having two types of catalysts made from zeolites of large pore and medium pore.]<br>
US Pat. No. 5,286,369 describes a phosphate based binder composition suitable for binding high silica zeolites. Here, reaction between aluminium nitrate and phosphoric acid forms aluminium phosphate binder. However, during the reaction, along with the formation of aluminium phosphate binder, nitric acid is also formed as a by-product as per following reaction.<br>
Al (NO3)3 + H3PO4     -------------&gt; A1PO4+ 3HNO3<br>
Presence of nitric acid is detrimental to the activity of any type of zeolite. Nevertheless, additives prepared by this process exhibit higher ABD and excellent attrition resistance.<br>
US Pat. 6,858,556 relates to a process for preparing a hydrocarbon conversion catalyst comprising stabilized ZSM-5 type zeolite and a Y zeolite bonded with a common silica alumina binder. This is due to the fact, ZSM-5 type high silica zeolite and low silica Y zeolite cannot be bonded with a common binder at the same time maintaining catalytic activity.<br>
From US Patent Nos. 5,190,902 and 5,286,369, it can be concluded that attrition resistant catalysts based on ZSM-5 zeolite can be prepared with an acidic clay-phosphate binders but with loss of catalytic activity. Further improvement in activity is possible by preparing similar catalyst at higher pH by sacrificing attrition resistance properties.<br>
From prior art processes, it can be concluded that ZSM-5 type high silica zeolites based microspheroidal catalyst particles can easily be prepared by employing several types of binders. Retaining catalytic activity with adequate physical properties is tedious. ZSM-5 type zeolites are sensitive to extreme pH conditions. While the use of basic or semibasic phosphate source does improve catalytic activity of the particles, however, attrition resistance has to be sacrificed. Hence, there is a need to develop a process for the restoration of catalytic activity of high silica zeolites without sacrificing attrition resistance and ABD of resulting catalyst particles.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of LPG selective catalyst.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a catalyst composition for cracking heavy residual hydrocarbon feed.<br>
Another object of the invention is to explore the potential of ZSM-5 crystals by stabilisation to retain catalytic activity and LPG selectivity.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of catalyst additive having adequate ABD and attrition resistance property to obtain LPG.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to reduce undesired hydrocarbons such as C1, C2 and boiling fraction above 360Â°C when used in cracking process.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to develop a process for simultaneously enhancing catalytic activity with enhanced yield of LPG and higher attrition resistance and ABD of resulting catalyst particles and suppressing dry gas and heavy fraction.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

The present invention is further explained in the form of following preferred embodiments<br>
Clays<br>
Clays are commonly used as major component of cracking catalysts. They are favoured due to their low cost and used as diluents and density modifier. Clays are used in finely divided form with a size below 3 microns. The most common varieties of clays used in cracking catalyst formulations are kaolinite and halloysite. Clays have a two-layer structure, consisting of alternating sheets of silica in tetrahedral configuration and alumina in octahedral configuration. These sheets are separated with a gap of 7.13 Â°A. Dry atmosphere equilibrated clay has moisture content of about 15wt%. Clays are good sources for silica and alumina as they contain about 45 wt% of silica and 38 wt% of alumina. It is preferable to use clays having particle size below 3 microns. It has been shown that use of delaminated clays in catalyst formulations enhances ABD and attrition resistance.<br>
Medium pore high silica zeolites<br>
Zeolites are synthetic or naturally occurring crystalline inorganic material characterized by properties such as ion exchange and molecular sieving. The most important and industrially exploited members of zeolite family are ZSM-5, ZSM-11, beta and mordenite a few to mention. These zeolites are synthesized with SiOj to Al2O3 ratio in the range 10 to infinity and 0.1 to 4 wt %Na2O. To make them suitable for catalytic application, soda present inside for balancing electrovalence is required to be exchanged with a proton, via ammonium exchange followed by calcination. Higher silica to alumina ratio zeolite may be further prepared by modification of synthetic forms by steaming, chemical treatment or replacement of framework aluminium with silica. These modification steps for ultra-stabilization drastically reduce the catalytic activity of the<br>
zeolite. Most commonly used medium pore zeolite in cracking catalyst is ZSM-5 zeolite. This material has pores in the range 5.4 to 5.5Â°A. This zeolite is known for dewaxing and isomerisation abilities of hydrocarbons. In cracking processes, these zeolites lead to the production of higher LPG and high-octane gasoline. ZSM-5 zeolite cannot be employed for cracking catalyst with conventional silica alumina binders, as it cannot sustain LPG selectivity due to the requirement of stabilization of acid sites and pores with phosphate radicals. The present invention shows how to enhance catalytic activity of zeolite materials. Step of zeolite activation involves reacting of medium pore high silica zeolite with required amount of sodium free basic components with or without phosphate. Once these zeolite materials are treated with a basic phosphate compound, it can be incorporated to an acidic catalyst binder containing clay, phosphate, silica and/or alumina. The phosphate source could be ammonium di-hydrogen phosphate, ammonium mono hydrogen phosphate, tri-ammonium phosphate, ammonium hypo phosphate, ammonium ortho-phosphate, ammonium di-hydrogen ortho-phosphate, ammonium mono hydrogen ortho-phosphate, ammonium hypophosphite, ammonium di-hydrogen ortho-phosphite, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Colloidal silica<br>
Colloidal silica is aqueous colloidal dispersions of silica particles, stabilized by the use of small quantities of soda or ammonium. These products having soda less than 0.2 wt % can be readily used for matrix or catalyst binding purpose. These are stable between pH of 8.5 and 11. These products are commercially available in varying particle size ranging from 7 to 22 nm. However, pH of these colloidal silica materials may be lowered between 1-3 employing mineral and/or organic acids for enhancing binding property.<br>
Alumina<br>
Pseudoboehmite alumina with soda, less than 0.1 wt % are ideal binders for different zeolite based catalysts as they can be converted to a glue by reacting with acids like nitric acid, formic acid or acetic acid. Glue alumina can be mixed with a zeolite, clay-phosphate and colloidal silica and spray dried. Once spray dried product is calcined, alumina gets transformed into gamma phase, a hard material, which holds clay, zeolite and other catalyst ingredients together to form attrition resistant mass. Varieties of<br>
pseudoboehmite alumina are commercially available in different crystallite sizes and surface area. Besides this other species of alumina such as aluminium trihydrate, bayrite, gamma alumina can also be used for enhancing binding and catalytic activity with respect to cracking of heavier hydrocarbons.<br>
Cracking catalyst<br>
In a preferred method for preparing cracking catalyst of present invention, (a) a conditioned medium pore high silica zeolite is prepared by reacting dry zeolite with loss on ignition below 3 wt%, with a basic phosphate compound, (b) preparing silica-alumina-clay-phosphate binder by homogenising acidified colloidal silica and/or, alumina with a clay phosphate binder, (c) adding finely ground slurry of conditioned zeolite to silica-alumina clay phosphate obtained under (b) to obtain a slurry ready for spray drying having composition, 1 to 50 wt% conditioned low soda zeolite, 1 to 20 wt% alumina, 1 to 20 wt% silica , 10 to 50 wt% kaolin clay and 1 to 20 wt% phosphoric acid, (d) drying the slurry and (e) calcination.<br>
