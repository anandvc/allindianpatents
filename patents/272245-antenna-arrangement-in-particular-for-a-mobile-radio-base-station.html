				<td>Antenna arrangement, in particular for a mobile radio base station<br>
The invention relates to an antenna arrangement, in particular for a mobile radio<br>
base station, according to the preamble of Claim 1.<br>
Antenna arrangements, in particular for a mobile radio base station, are known, for<br>
example, from WO 00/039894 A1. In this prior publication, a vertically alignable<br>
reflector is described, on the two outer lateral limitations of which running vertically<br>
and parallel with respect to one another, a lateral web projecting in the radiation<br>
direction and therefore transverse to the reflector plane is configured, in each case.<br>
Arranged one above each other in the vertical direction are a plurality of dipole<br>
arrangements which radiate in two polarization planes aligned perpendicularly with<br>
respect to one another and which consist of so-called vector dipoles. These vector<br>
dlpoles are structurally similarly designed to dipole squares. The design and the<br>
feed are, however, such that, despite the horizontally or vertically aligned dipoles,<br>
the dipole arrangement as a whole acts as an X-polarized antenna, in which the two<br>
polarization planes which are perpendicular with respect to one another are aligned<br>
at an angle of +45° or -45° with respect to the vertical or the horizontal.<br>
It can be inferred from the generic DE 103 596 22 A1, that the dual-polarized<br>
radiators, which are seated in front of a reflector, can be provided with a capacitive<br>
outer conductor coupling. Introduced in each half of the two balancing devices<br>
located rotated about 90° with respect to one another are therefore axial bores<br>
extending perpendicularly to the reflector plane, in the region of which, rod-shaped<br>
coupling elements 21 galvanically connected to the reflector are seated and are<br>
surrounded by cylindrical insulators, on which the pairs of balancing halves, which<br>
are provided with the total of four axial bores and arranged rotated about 90° with<br>
respect to one another, of the dual-polarized radiator arrangement can be mounted.<br>
 <br>
An inner conductor for feeding the two polarizations of the radiator arrangement<br>
located perpendicularly with respect to one another can be laid inside two rod-<br>
shaped coupling elements from the rear side of the reflector.<br>
From this prior publication it can also be inferred that the dipoie-shaped radiator<br>
arrangement, with the associated carrying device and/or balancing device and the<br>
associated dipole and/or radiator halves, forms a common part which is electrically<br>
conductive, or is provided with an electrically conductive surface or surface layer.<br>
The radiator arrangement formed in this manner is then placed by means of the<br>
outer conductor coupling mentioned on an associated reflector arrangement,<br>
according to the above-mentioned DE 103 59 622 A1.<br>
A radiator arrangement is also known from EP 1 588 454 B1. According to this prior<br>
publication, the use, for example, of a vertically alignable antenna arrangement with<br>
a reflector is described, on the vertical lateral limiting lines of which two lateral webs<br>
projecting transversely and, in particular, perpendicularly to the reflector plane in the<br>
direction of radiation are configured, between which the dual-polarized radiators<br>
arranged in the vertical direction above one another are seated. According to this<br>
prior publication, the base of the balancing device of the associated radiator<br>
arrangement is also capacitively connected (in other words without any<br>
electric/galvanic contact) to the reflectors, or coupled thereto, with the interposition of<br>
a base, for which purpose the reflector has a recess, in which the non-conductive<br>
base engages and is anchored and in turn holds the balancing device or the base of<br>
the balancing device of the dual-polarized radiator. The inner conductor can be laid<br>
here as described in the above-mentioned prior art.<br>
Finally, antenna arrangements with reflectors are known, on the longitudinal lateral<br>
regions of which, in other words on the longitudinal or vertical lateral regions thereof,<br>
webs projecting forward from the reflector plane are provided, as can be inferred, for<br>
example, from the prior publications WO 99/62138 A1, US 5,710,569 A or EP 0 916<br>
169 B1.<br>
 <br>
In an alternative embodiment according to this prior publication, it is shown that,<br>
instead of an electrically conductive reflector, generally in the form of a metal sheet,<br>
a printed circuit board can also be used, on which the reflector is constructed. In this<br>
case, the electrically conductive ground face is preferably omitted on one side of the<br>
printed circuit board or the base is also provided with insulation in this region.<br>
It is to be inferred as known from WO 2004/091041 A1 that a reflector for a radiator<br>
arrangement is not constructed, for example, from a plurality of sheet-metal parts,<br>
but may consist of a cast part, a deep drawn part, a stamped part or a milled part. In<br>
this case, the reflector produced in this manner may also be configured at least with<br>
an additionally integrated functional part, which is integrally connected to the<br>
reflector. This functional part may be one or more housing parts for HF components.<br>
It is described how, for example, a housing attachment is produced integrally with<br>
the reflector on the reflector rear, in which housing attachment feed lines for the<br>
feeding of radiators arranged on the front can be accommodated.<br>
It is an object of the invention, proceeding from the generic prior art according to DE<br>
103 59 622 A1, to provide an antenna arrangement, in which the risk of the<br>
occurrence of intermodulation products is as low as possible. In this case, the<br>
production-related outlay for assembly is also to be as low as possible.<br>
The object is achieved according to the invention according to the features disclosed<br>
in Claim 1. Advantageous configurations of the invention are given in the sub-claims.<br>
The invention provides an improved antenna arrangement which can be produced<br>
simply and with high precision with exactly predetermined radiation properties,<br>
avoiding potential sources of interference, such as, for example, undesired<br>
intermodulations.<br>
The antenna arrangement according to the invention is distinguished in that the at<br>
least one radiator arrangement and an associated reflector or at least an associated<br>
reflector frame are produced together, in particular are cast, in other words consist of<br>
 <br>
a common part or, for example, cast part. The entire antenna arrangement<br>
preferably comprises at least one radiator arrangement and the reflector or part<br>
reflector or a reflector frame which are formed from a common diecast part, in<br>
particular a metal diecast part, such as, for example, an aluminium cast part. It is<br>
also possible to cast the entire arrangement from a dielectric material, in particular<br>
plastics material, and then to provide it with a metallised, i.e. electrically conductive<br>
surface.<br>
In particular when the antenna arrangement is produced from metal with regard to its<br>
important parts, in other words, for example, with the mentioned radiator<br>
arrangement (in other words, for example, the dipole and/or radiator halves and the<br>
associated carrying or balancing device and the associated reflector or a part<br>
reflector), other production methods can also be considered, for example production<br>
by deep drawing, milling or the like. In other words, the important parts of the<br>
antenna arrangement of this type, comprising the radiator arrangement with the<br>
associated carrying device and/or balancing device and the associated reflector or<br>
associated reflector part, consist of a part produced together which can also be<br>
called one-part or integral. Frequently a so-called "primary forming method" is also<br>
referred to for parts produced in this manner.<br>
In this case, the reflector arrangement has a recess, within which the carrying device<br>
of the radiator arrangement is provided, which is preferably mechanically rigidly<br>
connected at its base by means of at least two, and preferably by means of at least<br>
four, holding or support webs arranged offset in the peripheral direction to the<br>
reflector arrangement surrounding the recess.<br>
In the framework of an antenna arrangement of this type according to the invention,<br>
the reflector arrangement may also at least comprise a longitudinal and/or transverse<br>
web.<br>
If the antenna arrangement according to the invention is used, in particular, as a<br>
base station for a mobile radio antenna, it generally comprises, when erected in a<br>
 <br>
vertical orientation, a plurality of radiator devices arranged one above the other at a<br>
spacing, so a uniformly cast antenna of this type according to the invention with a<br>
plurality of radiators and/or radiator arrangements and the cast reflector or reflector<br>
frame comprises two lateral longitudinal webs extending in the vertical direction<br>
(which may be arranged located at a lateral edge or located offset thereto rather<br>
toward the centre). Furthermore, the antenna arrangement according to the invention<br>
may, however, also comprise an upper and a lower transverse web. If a plurality of<br>
radiator arrangements are arranged offset with respect to one another in the<br>
mounting direction, transverse webs may also be configured running between them<br>
in each case which are also cast integrally with the entire antenna arrangement. An<br>
entire antenna arrangement of this type may thus be produced as a uniform cast part<br>
which can be handled.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the radiator arrangement cast with the reflector or the<br>
reflector frame may also consist of dual-polarized radiator arrangements which<br>
radiate in two polarization planes which are perpendicular with respect to one<br>
another. In this case, cruciform dipole radiators could be used but also so-called<br>
vector dipoles, as are basically known from WO 00/039894 A1.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, vector dipoles are used, as known from WO<br>
2004/100315 A1, in which namely the radiator halves belonging to each polarization<br>
plane, arranged diagonally with respect to one another and, viewed alone in plan<br>
view, formed so as to be square or similar to a square, can be configured with a<br>
closed part face or even closed over the whole face.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, it is also provided here that in the region of these dipole<br>
or radiator halves, corresponding recesses are provided in the region of the reflector<br>
plane. Namely, in the region of the slots separating the individual dipole halves or<br>
radiator halves from one another, which pass into recesses of the balancing device<br>
or carrying device carrying the radiator device, holding webs or holding connections<br>
may preferably be provided located in the reflector plane, via which the radiator<br>
arrangement seated in the centre is held by the reflector frame surrounding it.<br>
 <br>
The embodiment mentioned last also offers the advantage that a corresponding tool<br>
can also be used which, during the casting process, has an upper face limiting the<br>
cavity, which forms the lower face of the respective dipole half or radiator half. This<br>
tool can then be withdrawn downwardly, in other words with the transverse<br>
component to the reflector plane through the corresponding window-like recess, the<br>
entire radiator arrangement being held by the holding webs mentioned or holding<br>
connection portions, via which the radiator arrangement is connected with the<br>
reflector surrounding it.<br>
In particular when a reflector is formed without longitudinal and/or transverse webs,<br>
there would also be the possibility of removing tools laterally with a withdrawal<br>
movement parallel to the reflector plane during demolding, so the reflector plane<br>
could then also be closed.<br>
In a reflector formed in this manner, the base of the balancing device of the radiator<br>
arrangement may be connected galvanically, i.e. in terms of direct current, to the<br>
reflector plane.<br>
The dual-polarized radiator arrangement and the associated reflector frame may be<br>
formed as a whole from an electrically conductive material. The radiator<br>
arrangement and the reflector frame may, however, also be formed from a plastics<br>
material or in general dielectric material, i.e. cast, the corresponding parts then being<br>
provided with an electrically conductive surface layer. In this case, it is not<br>
necessary, however, for example, for the above-mentioned holding webs or holding<br>
connections between the carrying device and the radiator device and the reflector<br>
frame to also be electrically conductive. In other words, the radiator device and, in<br>
particular, its carrying device and/or the balancing device and the reflector frame<br>
may be galvanically separated from one another.<br>
The antenna arrangement according to the invention with a reflector arrangement<br>
preferably comprising a plurality of radiators and a reflector frame with longitudinal<br>
and/or transverse webs may, however, also be capacitively coupled to a ground face<br>
 <br>
or capacitively coupled to a ground face arranged below the so-called reflector<br>
frame.<br>
It has previously been conventional in the prior art, to generally use reflectors made<br>
of a metal sheet, on which the radiator modules are constructed. Owing to the<br>
radiators arranged between the lateral outer limitation of the reflector plane and the<br>
radiators generally arranged rather to the centre, it was possible to configure at a<br>
suitable point the longitudinal lateral limitations projecting transversely to the reflector<br>
plane in the form of longitudinal webs which could be adjusted, for example, between<br>
a perpendicular alignment with respect to the reflector plane through to an angled<br>
alignment in such a way that a desired radiation shaping was possible.<br>
If, on the other hand, it was desired to use reflectors in the form of printed circuit<br>
boards (so-called PCBs), which were provided on one printed circuit board side with<br>
an electrically conductive ground face, this required that the webs required for the<br>
radiation formation had to be connected to the ground face of the printed circuit<br>
board by means of screw or solder connections in order to produce a clear galvanic<br>
connection here. This assembly work was, however, not only laborious but<br>
constantly caused potential intermodulation sources of interference.<br>
In contrast, it is now proposed, proceeding from a printed circuit board which is<br>
preferably provided on the radiator side with an electrically conductive ground face<br>
and an insulating layer located thereabove, building on this, to position the reflector<br>
frame with the radiator arrangement connected thereto, which reflector frame is<br>
provided with a coupling face parallel to the ground face of the printed circuit board,<br>
longitudinal and/or transverse webs required for the pattern formation then being<br>
configured in turn on this coupling face. In other words, a capacitive reflector frame<br>
coupling is preferably proposed which makes it possible to capacitively couple the<br>
longitudinal and/or transverse webs required for the pattern formation to a ground<br>
face seated on a printed circuit board.<br>
 <br>
In the scope of the invention, a capacitive coupling of the reflector frame is thus<br>
preferably provided on a printed circuit board without a galvanic connection between<br>
the reflector and printed circuit board ground face. The invention is distinguished by<br>
a stable intermodulation-free connection. Above all, a precisely defined coupling<br>
between the ground face of the printed circuit board and the reflector frame can also<br>
be ensured in the scope of the invention by a clearly defined spacing and/or by a<br>
clearly definable size of the coupling faces.<br>
Finally, a rapid and uncomplicated assembly is also possible in the scope of the<br>
invention, so fault sources are reduced and, above all, solder points on the reflector<br>
are omitted. If the uniformly cast antenna arrangement according to the invention<br>
consisting of the reflector frame and radiator module or radiator modules is used as<br>
the antenna arrangement, further assembly steps for connection to an additional<br>
printed circuit board, for example one provided with a ground face, would no longer<br>
be necessary at all. If a printed circuit board of this type provided with a ground face<br>
is used to produce a capacitive outer conductor coupling, a simple connection is<br>
possible, for example, by using an adhesive strip which adheres on both sides, in<br>
order to produce the reflector frame with the printed circuit board located therebelow<br>
and provided with a ground face with the formation of the total reflector with the<br>
capacitive outer conductor coupling.<br>
The completely assembled unit, consisting of the reflector frame and the radiator<br>
arrangement connected thereto and the printed circuit board, forms a self-supporting<br>
unit. The reflector frame and the base of the radiator arrangement or the radiator<br>
arrangements may be fixed on the board with all suitable means, for example by<br>
means of clips, by means of an adhesive tape which adheres on both sides,<br>
separate adhesive etc.<br>
The ground face is preferably provided on the printed circuit board by the producer<br>
with an insulating layer allowing a galvanic separation with respect to the reflector<br>
frame, for example in the form of a lacquer, in particular solder resist lacquer, a film<br>
or another plastics material layer. If the reflector frame is glued on by means of an<br>
 <br>
adhesive tape adhering on both sides, an insulation and therefore a galvanic<br>
separation is through this produced between the electrically conductive reflector<br>
frame, on the one hand, and ground face on the printed circuit board, on the other<br>
hand, so a separate insulating layer on the ground face could even be dispensed<br>
with.<br>
Further advantages, details and features of the invention emerge below from the<br>
embodiments described in the figures, in which, in detail:<br>
Fig. 1:	shows a schematic three-dimensional view of a basic type of an<br>
antenna according to the invention with a dual-polarized radiator<br>
arrangement;<br>
Fig. 2:	shows an exploded view of the embodiment of Fig. 1;<br>
Fig. 3:	shows a corresponding schematic three-dimensional view of an<br>
antenna arrangement according to the invention with three dual-<br>
polarized radiators arranged offset with respect to one another;<br>
Fig. 4:	shows an exploded view of the embodiment of Fig. 3;<br>
Fig. 5:	shows a schematic cross sectional view through a dual-polarized<br>
radiator with a part of the reflector arrangement to clarify the feeding of<br>
the radiator; and<br>
Fig. 6:	shows an embodiment modified with respect to Fig. 5.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the basic type of an antenna arrangement according to the invention as<br>
can be used, for example, for a mobile radio base station. The antenna arrangement<br>
comprises a reflector arrangement 1, in front of which a dual-polarized radiator or a<br>
dual-polarized radiator arrangement 3 is provided. In the embodiment shown, this is<br>
a vector dipole, which radiates in two polarization planes P which are perpendicular<br>
 <br>
with respect to one another and which are perpendicular to the reflector plane and<br>
run virtually diagonally through the corners of the radiator arrangement which is<br>
square in plan view. With regard to the construction and mode of functioning of such<br>
a radiator type, reference is made, for example, to WO 00/039894 A1.<br>
However, any radiator or radiator type can basically be used in the scope of the<br>
invention, in particular dipole radiators and/or patch radiators, such as are known, for<br>
example, from the prior publications DE 197 22 742 A1, DE 196 27 015 A1, US<br>
5,710,569 A, WO 00/039894 A1 or DE 101 50 150 A1.<br>
It can be inferred from the view according to Fig. 1 that the antenna arrangement has<br>
a so-called reflector or reflector frame 11. This reflector or reflector frame 11<br>
comprises a reflector face 13 which will sometimes also be called a coupling face 13'<br>
below in view of an embodiment of the invention still to be described below. This<br>
reflector face 13 is provided, in the embodiment shown, with longitudinal webs 15<br>
extending perpendicularly with respect to the reflector face 13 and transverse webs<br>
17 which are configured and/or provided, in the embodiment shown, on the outer<br>
limitations of the reflector frame 11 but may also be located offset further inward<br>
relative to the outer limitations of the reflector frame 11, so a portion of the reflector<br>
projecting outwardly over the webs 15, 17 remains. These longitudinal and<br>
transverse webs 15, 17 are also connected to one another at the corner regions 19.<br>
The longitudinal and transverse webs shown do not absolutely necessarily have to<br>
be aligned perpendicularly to the reflector face 13. These webs may also partially<br>
extend in an alignment to the reflector face differing from a 90° angle, for example<br>
diverging in the radiation direction or running toward one another or may be more<br>
inclined to the left or the right etc. To this extent, limitations basically do not exist.<br>
It can also be seen from the view according to Fig. 1 that the reflector face 13 is<br>
provided with a recess 13a which, in the embodiment shown, has dimensions in the<br>
longitudinal and transverse direction that are as large as the dual-polarized radiator 3<br>
with regard to its longitudinal and/or transverse extension. The cut-out face with the<br>
formation of the corresponding recess 13a may be shaped in any way here, i.e. it<br>
 <br>
may differ from the outer contour of the radiator and even comprise curved edge<br>
courses, so the recess 13a thus formed is defined by curved section courses or any<br>
other limitation lines.<br>
It can also be seen from the view according to Fig. 1 that the two balancing devices<br>
21 arranged rotated about 90° with respect to one another (one balancing device for<br>
each polarization of the radiator device 3) have a base 121 located at the bottom in<br>
Fig. 1 connecting them together, from which upwardly extending so-called balancing<br>
slots 123 are provided. To this extent, a carrying device 21 for the dipoles or<br>
radiators or dipole or radiator halves etc. is primarily also referred to below, the<br>
carrying device comprising corresponding slots 123 extending axially from the top in<br>
the direction of the base 121.<br>
The antenna arrangement according to the invention is distinguished according to<br>
one embodiment in that the at least one radiator arrangement and an associated<br>
reflector or at least one associated reflector frame are cast together, in other words<br>
consist of a common cast part. The entire antenna arrangement preferably<br>
comprises at least one radiator arrangement and the reflector or the part reflector or<br>
a reflector frame which are formed from a common cast part, in particular a diecast<br>
part, such as, for example, a metal diecast part or an aluminium cast part. It is also<br>
possible to cast the entire arrangement from a dielectric material, in particular<br>
plastics material and to then provide it with a metallised, i.e. electrically conductive<br>
surface.<br>
As can also be seen from Fig. 1, the window-like recess 13a provided in the reflector<br>
plane of the reflector frame 11, in other words at the level of the reflector face 13, is<br>
substantially square in plan view. In this case, this window-like square configuration<br>
is divided into four part openings 13'a, namely by holding webs 131 which in each<br>
case extend from the base 121 of the carrying device and/or balancing device 21<br>
centrally and transversely, i.e. in particular perpendicularly to the side limitations of<br>
the window cut-out and are cast during the casting process of the antenna<br>
arrangement together with the radiator arrangement and the reflector frame 11. The<br>
 <br>
carrying device and/or balancing device 21 and therefore the entire radiator<br>
arrangement 3 is connected to the reflector frame 11 and therefore held by this total<br>
of four holding webs 131.<br>
The width of the holding webs 131 corresponds to the slot width of the slots 123 in<br>
the carrying device and/or balancing device 21, via which the dipole or radiator<br>
halves 3a located at the top are held. The thickness of the holding webs 131 can be<br>
selected as desired. Thus, the thickness of the holding webs 131 may, for example,<br>
correspond to the thickness of the coupling faces 13 or else to the thickness of the<br>
base 121 of the carrying device and/or balancing device 21, i.e. the carrying device<br>
21.<br>
In the embodiment shown, the slots 123 reach approximately to the surface of the<br>
coupling faces 13 or the surface of the holding webs 131 but may also end<br>

The reflector frame 11 is preferably produced together with the entire radiator<br>
arrangement 3 from an electrically conductive material, for example from a metal<br>
cast part (aluminium, but also other materials may be considered for this). This may<br>
also be a plastics material part which is then metallised, in other words covered with<br>
a metallic conductive surface. In particular when producing the reflector frame 11<br>
from metal, other production methods may be considered, for example production of<br>
the reflector frame by deep drawing, milling, or the like. In other words, the antenna<br>
arrangement with the reflector arrangement 3 and the reflector or reflector frame<br>
may also be produced by other production methods as a common part, for example<br>
by milling, optionally by deep drawing etc. Frequently, a so-called "primary forming<br>
method" is referred to here.<br>
A configuration of the antenna arrangement with the above-mentioned holding webs<br>
131 and the slots 123 and the described window-like recesses 13'a has the<br>
advantage that a casting tool can be used, for example, that has cruciform walls<br>
which, once the casting process is complete in the drawing according to Fig. 1, can<br>
 <br>
be removed upwardly perpendicular to the reflector face, whereby the cruciform<br>
separating and balancing slots and the inner further recesses 151 (which are<br>
required to lay feed cables here) can be removed upwardly, whereas another part of<br>
the casting tool can be removed downwardly through the four part window recesses<br>
13'a. Only if at least transverse and/or longitudinal webs were to be dispensed with,<br>
could a tool of this type also be removed laterally, i.e. parallel to the coupling face<br>
plane 13, so the window-like recesses 13a could then be dispensed with at the level<br>
of the coupling faces 13.<br>
An antenna arrangement formed in this manner is fully functional per se, once the<br>
corresponding cabling, in particular for feeding the radiator arrangement, has been<br>
installed. In this case, a uniform, handleable, mechanically rigidly connected overall<br>
arrangement consisting of a dipole radiator (a dual-polarized dipole radiator in the<br>
embodiment shown) and a reflector frame is formed, in this case, by the antenna<br>
arrangement described with the aid of Fig. 1.<br>
In contrast to this, this antenna arrangement may also be further completed, namely<br>
with an additional ground face producing the overall reflector, which is formed on a<br>
substrate.<br>
For this purpose, reference is made to the exploded view according to Fig. 2.<br>
As emerges, in particular from the exploded view with regard to a preferred<br>
development of the invention according to Fig. 2, the antenna arrangement may also<br>
comprise a printed circuit board 5 (PCB), which is preferably provided on the side 5a<br>
facing the radiator side, the so-called radiator or ground face side 5a, with a<br>
preferably all-over electrically conductive ground face 7. The electric components<br>
and the conductor paths connecting the electric components are then provided on<br>
the opposing conductor path plane 5b (in other words on the lower side of the printed<br>
circuit board 5 not shown in more detail with respect to Fig. 1 and 2).<br>
 <br>
The ground face 7 is generally covered with an insulating layer 8 not reproduced in<br>
Fig. 2, for example in the form of a plastics material or film layer, a lacquer layer or<br>
so-called solder resist lacquer layer etc..<br>
5 The antenna arrangement described with the aid of Fig. 1 with the radiator<br>
arrangement 3 and the reflector frame 11 can be rigidly connected to the printed<br>
circuit board 5, specifically by any measures suitable for this. The two parts can be<br>
assembled, for example, by fixing a screw to be screwed in from the rear side of the<br>
printed circuit board into the lower side, in other words the base 121 of the carrying<br>
i device and/or balancing device 21 or by means of other clip-like fastening elements,<br>
the carrying device and/or balancing device 21, via which the radiator elements 3a of<br>
the dual-polarized radiator 3 are held, being capacitively coupled with the ground<br>
face 7 of the printed circuit board 5 located therebelow.<br>
The reflector frame 11 could also be connected to the printed circuit board by means<br>
of suitable mechanical means. However, the reflector frame 11 is preferably<br>
fastened to the upper side of the printed circuit board 5 by means of an adhesive film<br>
9 that adheres on both sides, the adhesive film 9 being provided, in the embodiment<br>
shown, with a window-like cut-out 9', the size and positioning of which corresponds<br>
or is approximated to the cut-out 13a in the coupling face 13 of the reflector frame<br>
11. The adhesive film may also be continuous, however, in other words be provided<br>
without the above-mentioned window-like cut-out 9'. In this case, a corresponding<br>
adhesive film 9 provided with an adhesive layer on both sides or another spacer may<br>
also be provided on the lower side of the base 121 of the carrying device and/or<br>
balancing device 21, so the same spacing ratios and conditions are provided<br>
between the lower side of the coupling faces 13 and the lower side of the base 121<br>
with respect to the ground face 7 of the printed circuit board 5 located therebelow<br>
and covered with an insulating layer.<br>
If the insulating layer 8 on the ground face 7 should also be provided with a window,<br>
so the insulting layer 8 is omitted in the region of this window (with it being possible<br>
for this region, where the insulating layer 8 is omitted on the ground face, to be<br>
 <br>
comparable with the size and/or arrangement of the other window 9' with regard to<br>
the double-sided adhesive device 9 and/or the recess 13a in the reflector face 13),<br>
the ground face 7 would in this region lie "bare". In this case, the base 121, in other<br>
words the lower side of the carrying device and/or balancing device 21, could also be<br>
galvanically contacted by the ground face 7. In the board, bores and axial bores<br>
flush therewith are configured in the base 121 of the carrying device and/or<br>
balancing device 21 of the radiator arrangements in order to guide an inner<br>
conductor being used for feeding upwardly from the rear side of the printed circuit<br>
board here, in each case, and to couple it galvanically via a bridge portion with the<br>
respective diagonally opposing second half 3a of the radiator device 3 located at the<br>
top or, to couple it inductively, as described in WO 2005/060049 A1, for example.<br>
Reference is therefore also made to this extent, with regard to the mode of<br>
functioning, to the above-mentioned prior publication or to the Figs. 5 and 6<br>
described later.<br>
To ensure a rigid connection between the reflector face 13, in other words a rigid<br>
connection between the reflector frame 11, on the one hand, and the lower side of<br>
the base 121 of the radiator arrangement 3, on the other hand, with the printed<br>
circuit board, all conceivable connection methods may be considered. Thus, for<br>
example, an adhesive compound may be applied to the upper side of the printed<br>
circuit board (in other words the ground face or the insulating layer 9 covering the<br>
ground face) and/or to the lower side of the coupling face 13. However, clip-like<br>
parts which engage in one another and produce a catch mechanism when attached<br>
are also possible.<br>
However, the above-mentioned adhesive tape 9 adhering on both sides, ensuring a<br>
rigidly predetermined spacing between the coupling face 13 and the ground face 7<br>
and simultaneously producing a mechanically rigid connection, is preferred. The<br>
reflector frame 11 with the printed circuit board 5 is a rigidly connected self-<br>
supporting unit owing to a connection of this type.<br>
 <br>
Owing to the structure described, a capacitive coupling, which also ensures the<br>
desired capacitive coupling of the ground face for the longitudinal and/or transverse<br>
webs 15, 17, is produced by the capacitive coupling of the reflector face 13, which is<br>
therefore sometimes also called a coupling face 13', and of the ground face 7<br>
located therebelow on the printed circuit board 5.<br>
With the aid of Fig. 3, only one extension is reproduced such that the corresponding<br>
antenna arrangement may also comprise a plurality of radiator arrangements 3<br>
seated next to one another or above one another in the mounting direction, an<br>
antenna arrangement of this type being erected with the plurality of radiators<br>
generally in the vertical direction, so the plurality of radiator arrangements are<br>
arranged spaced apart one above the other in a vertical plane. The reflector frame<br>
may, in this case, comprise a number of reflector fields 25 corresponding to the<br>
number of radiator arrangements. The size of the antenna arrangement can thus be<br>
extended as desired. In this case, the adhesive tape 9 which adheres on the two<br>
sides is preferably configured so as to be a corresponding length and provided with<br>
three recesses 9' which correspond to the three recesses or windows 13a with the<br>
respective four part windows 13'a in the three reflector fields 25 of the reflector frame<br>
11. This radiator arrangement may also be additionally fixed through the bore 26<br>
incorporated in the printed circuit board (see Fig. 2 or 4), similarly to in the<br>
embodiment according to Fig. 3, from below by screwing a screw into the base of the<br>
carrying device and/or balancing device of the radiator device 13, preferably using<br>
an electrically non-conductive screw, above all when the base of the carrying device<br>
and/or balancing device of the radiator device 3 is to be capacitively coupled to the<br>
ground face 7 of the printed circuit board 5. However, a film adhering on both sides<br>
comparable with the adhesive tape 9 adhering on both sides is preferably also<br>
provided on the lower side of the base 121, so the lower side of the base 121 and<br>
the lower side of the coupling faces 13 are seated at the same spacing level with<br>
respect to the upper side of the printed circuit board 5 located therebelow.<br>
 <br>
With the aid of Figs. 5 and 6, it is only indicated by a schematic section through a<br>
corresponding radiator arrangement how a feed of a dual-polarized radiator or, in a<br>
similar manner, also of a singly-polarized radiator 3 can take place.<br>
The feed generally takes place by means of a coaxial cable which extends from the<br>
lower side of the reflector through an axial bore 103 leading in the carrying device or<br>
balancing device 21 to the plane of the actual dipole and/or radiator halves 3a. At<br>
the upper end of this axial bore at the level of the dipole and/or radiator halves 3a,<br>
the coaxial cable is then stripped, so the outer conductor, which is insulated in the<br>
axial bore 103 relative to the carrying and/or balancing device 21, is exposed and is<br>
then electrically/galvanically connected in the upper region, for example, by means<br>
of a solder 201 to the inner end of an associated dipole or radiator half 3a.<br>
Substantially, only the inner conductor 101b is drawn in here in Fig. 5 in the<br>
drawings. The coaxial cable would thus be passed upwardly from below through the<br>
axial bore 103, the outer conductor, as mentioned, then being<br>
electrically/galvanically connected to the associated dipole or radiator half 3a at the<br>
upper end of the carrying device 21 via the solder 201. Up to this point, the outer<br>
conductor is insulated relative to the carrying device 21.<br>
Alternatively or preferably, however, a coaxial feed cable would be connected in<br>
such a way that the outer conductor is held at the lower end of the bore 103, for<br>
example, on a solder point 201' and the inner conductor 101b is held only by an<br>
insulator and guided upwardly separately in the bore 103. The bore in the carrying<br>
device thus acts as an outer conductor which surrounds the inner conductor 101b,<br>
so a coaxial feed line is virtually formed as a result, via which the dipole and/or<br>
radiator halves which are electrically/galvanically conductively connected to the<br>
carrying device, generally as a common component, are fed.<br>
If the one dipole half (which is not fed by the inner conductor) is not fed by an<br>
electrical/galvanic coupling, for example in the region of the bore of the carrying<br>
device, but, for example, by soldering on an outer conductor of a coaxial cable, the<br>
corresponding feed may also be brought about capacitively, for example by a<br>
 <br>
capacitive coupling between the base of the carrying device and the ground c<br>
reflector face. Generally, the associated feed line, usually the outer conductor of<br>
coaxial cable, is thus connected in a region below the carrying device, which i<br>
preferably located, with a plan view perpendicular to the reflector, in that regioi<br>
i below the dipole or radiator half which is fed thereby.<br>
The inner conductor 101b generally connected to the inner conductor of a coaxia<br>
cable, is generally angled approximately at the level of the dipole and/or radiatoi<br>
halves 3a by 90° or approximately 90° and leads to the adjacent inner end of the<br>
associated second dipole and/or radiator half 3a and is generally contacted there<br>
electrically by means of a solder 203.<br>
In the case of a dual-polarized radiator, the feed of the dipole and/or radiator halves<br>
3a located offset with respect to one another by 90° takes place accordingly, the<br>
second inner conductor extending crosswise with respect to the first inner conductor<br>
101b being arranged on another plane, so the two inner conductors do not touch in<br>
the middle but are guided past one another.<br>
In a singly-polarized radiator with only one polarization plane, only one feed<br>
conductor also designated an inner conductor is required.<br>
In the embodiment according to Fig. 6, it is shown that the end 101b' of the inner<br>
conductor 101b ends freely in a further axial bore 103, this further axial bore 103<br>
being provided in the carrying device and/or balancing device 21. In this case, the<br>
freely ending end portion of the inner conductor 101b is guided downwardly over a<br>
certain axial length in this further bore 103 and thus held via an insulator 203 in the<br>
bore 103 (similarly to the corresponding insulator 203 for fixing the inner conductor<br>
101b in the other axial bore 103), so a capacitive or serial coupling is produced here<br>
with regard to the second dipole and/or radiator half 3a'.<br>
Other feeds are also possible.<br>
 <br>
It is mentioned only for the sake of completeness that it can, for example, also be<br>
seen from Figs. 5 and 6 that the slots 23 extend here to the lower plane or base 121<br>
of the carrying and/or balancing device 21. The level of this carrying and/or<br>
balancing device 21 or the slots 123 should preferably lie in a range of about 1/8 to<br>
3/8 of a wavelength from the relevant operating frequency band to be transmitted or<br>
received; the level should preferably thus be 1/8 to 3/8 based on the medium<br>
wavelength A of the frequency band to be transmitted or received, in other words<br>
preferably about 1/4 A. In general, therefore, the radiator level relative to the<br>
reflector, in other words relative to the ground or reflector face should not fall below a<br>
value of A/10, with there basically being no upward restriction, so the radiator level<br>
could even be any multiple of A. The slots 123 can then be adapted accordingly with<br>
respect to their length.<br>
