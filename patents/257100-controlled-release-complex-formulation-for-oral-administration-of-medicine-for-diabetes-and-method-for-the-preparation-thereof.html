				<td>CONTROLLED RELEASE COMPLEX FORMULATION FOR<br>
ORAL ADMINISTRATION OF MEDICINE FOR DIABETES AND<br>
METHOD FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF<br>
Fieid of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an oral controlled release combination formulation of two medicines for diabetes and a method for the preparation thereof.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Metformin is an oral medication designed for helping control the patients' elevated blood sugar level by activating glucose receptor in the liver. It induces weight loss, reduces the level of blood-triglyceride and low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and increases high-density lipoproteins (HDL) in a diabetic patient. Therefore, it may be used as a primary drug for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).<br>
Metformin in the tabletted form of its hydrochloride is currently marketed as GLUCOPHAGE® (Bristol-myers Squibb Company) and its daily dosage is determined individually on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance, while not exceeding the maximum recommended dose of 2,550 mg per day. The side effects of metformin are loss of appetite, abdominal distension, nausea and diarrhea, while skin eruption or hives may break out on rare occasious. These side effects may be avoided by reducing the minimum and/or maintenance dose, or by administrating a controlled release formulation.<br>
Glimepiride, one of the sulfonylureas for oral administration, has been used as a drug for non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients who can not improved by dietetic therapy, weight training and weight loss, and its tabletted form is marketed as AMARYL® (Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc.).<br>
Sulfonylurea-based medicines including glimepiride are known to react with ß-cells to enhance insulin secretion and to exert long-term effects in<br>
reducing the blood-glucose level.<br>
United States Patent No. 6,031,004 discloses medication comprising a sulfonylurea derivative such as glyburide, glipizide and glimepride tabletted with a novel metformin salt for treating non-insulin-dependent diabetes; WO 00/03742 discloses a method for the manufacture of a combination formulation comprising (a) forming granules by wet granulation of a mixture of metformin and glibenclamide, (b) blending the granules with a tabletting aid and a diluent, (c) tabletting the blend, and (d) coating the obtained tablet with a hydrophilic cellulose polymer. However, this combination formulation shows the problem of unsatisfactory release behavior.<br>
United States Patent No. 6,682,759 discloses a method for the manufacture of a combination formulation comprising (a) tabletting metformin hydrochloride for controlled release using hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and polyethyleneoxide and (b) spraying on the resulting tablet glimepride dispersed in aqueous hydroxypropyl methylcellulose in the absence of a stabilizer. However, this combination formulation has the problem of reduced effective concentrations of the drugs because of the formation of drug derivatives; cyanoguanidine derivative of metformin and sulfonamide derivative of glimepride.<br>
Therefore, there has been a continual need to develop improved controlled release formulation for oral administration of a combination of medicines for diabetes, which is capable of maintaining the effectiveness of the drug by uniform release over a prescribed period.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a controlled release combination formulation for oral administration of metformin and a sulfonylurea-based antidiabetic medicine, which can be easily prepared and is capable of maintaining uniform release of the drugs over a long period of time, and a method for the preparation thereof.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a controlled release combination formulation for oral administration comprising a) a controlled release portion containing metformin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as an active ingredient, and a carrier for controlled release consisting of a polyethylene oxide and a natural gum; and b) a rapid-release portion coated on the controlled release portion containing a sulfonylurea-based antidiabetic medicine as an active ingredient.<br>

Test Example 1: In vitro Release Test 1<br>
In order to examine the effects of natural gum and polyethylene oxide as carriers for controlled release on the release rate of the drug, the tablets prepared in Examples 1 to 12 were subjected together with GLUCOPHAGE® XR controlled release tablet (Bristol-Myers Squibb Company) as a comparative formulation to in vitro release tests in accordance with the release test method described in Korea pharmacopoeia (the paddle method). The release pattern of metformin-HCl from each of the tablets was measured under the following conditions.<br>
-	Release test apparatus: Erweka DT 80 (Erweka, Germany)<br>
-	Release   solution:   The  2nd   solution  for the   disintegrating-test<br>
described in Korea pharmacopoeia (artificial gastric fluid)<br>
-	Release solution temperature: 37 ± 0.5 <br>
-	Amount of the release solution: 900 mL<br><br>
-	Rotation rate: 50 rpm<br>
-	Sampling times: Aliquots of the release solution were collected at 1,<br>
2, 3,4, 6, 8, and 10 hrs, filtered through a 0.45 µrn membrane, and used<br>
as test samples.   After each sampling of the release solution, the<br>
release-test system was refilled with an equal amount of fresh release<br>
solution.<br>
-	Analyzing method: The absorbances of a sample and a standard<br>
solution were measured at 233nm employing distilled water as a<br>
reference to calculate the corresponding release ratio.<br>
-	Calculation of the released amount: Cumulative release amount<br>
As can be seen from Figs. 2 to 4, the release rate becomes slow as the amount of polyethylene oxide or the natural gum increases. Especially, the tablet of Example 12 releases the drug continuously in a release pattern similar to that of the comparative formulation.<br>
Test Example 2: In vitro Release Test 2<br>
In order to examine how the film coating of the controlled release tablet obtained in Example 13 affect the release rates of the drugs, in vitro release-tests were conducted by repeating the method of Test Example 1 except for using the controlled release formulation prepared in Example 12, the combination formulation prepared in Example 13, and GLUCOPHAGE® XR controlled release tablet as a comparative formulation.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 5, the controlled release combination formulation of Example 13 shows a continuous drug release pattern similar<br>
to those of the combination formulation of Example 12 and the comparative formulation.<br>
Test Example 3: In vitro Release Test 3<br>
In order to examine how the glimepiride coating of the controlled release combination formulation afifect the release rate, the controlled release combination formulation prepared in Example 13 and Amaryl tablet (Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc.) as a comparative formulation were subjected to in vitro release tests in accordance with the release test method described in Korea pharmacopoeia (the paddle method). The release pattern of the active glimepiride ingredient from each of the formulations was measured under the following conditions.<br>
-	Release test apparatus: Erweka DT 80 (Erweka, Germany)<br>
-	Release solution: Phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.8)<br><br>
-	Release solution temperature: 37 ± 0.5 <br>
-	Amount of the release solution: 900 mL<br><br>
-	Rotation rate: 75 rpm<br>
-	Sampling times: Aliquots of the release solution were collected at 5,<br>
10, 15 and 30 mins, filtered through a 0.45 µm membrane, and used as<br>
test samples. After each sampling of the release solution, the release-<br>
test system was refilled with an equal amount of fresh release solution.<br>
-	Analyzing method: The release ratios of a sample and a standard<br>
solution    were    calculated    in    accordance    with    the    Liquid<br>
Chromatograph method described in The Korea pharmacopoeia under<br>
the following conditions.<br>
-	Column: Octadecyl silylated column<br>
-	Mobile phase: After mixing  sodium  dihydrogen  phosphate,<br>
acetonitrile and water (0.5g : 500ml : 500ml) together, pH of the<br>
mixture was adjusted to 2.5 to 3.5 with 20 % by volume of phosphate.<br>
-	Detector: UV Spectrophotometer (measuring wavelength : 228nm)<br>
-	Amount of injection: 50<br>
-	Flow rate: 0.5 ml/min<br>
- Calculation of released amount: Cumulative release amount<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 6, the release rate of glimepiride from the formulation of Example 13 was equivalent to that of the comparative Amaryl tablet formulation.<br>
Test Example 4: In vitro Release Test 4<br>
In vitro release tests were conducted for the tablet prepared in Example 12 and the comparative formulation by repeating the method of Test Example 1, except for adjusting the rotation rate to 100 rpm and 150 rpm.<br>
As can be seen from Figs. 7 and 8, the tablet of Example 12 displays a steady release pattern, without initial burst release of the drug even at a high rotation rate.<br>
Test Example 5: Stability Test<br>
In order to examine the stability of glimepiride in a solution as function of pH changes, only the glimepiride rapid-release portion of the formulation of Example 13 was separated, and dissolved in each of the solutions listed in Table 17. Each of the resulting solutions was kept at room temperature and the glimepiride contents thereof were measured at predetermined times.<br>
Table 17<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 9, it was found that in the solution containing meglumin which is an alkaline compound, glimepiride was most stable as judged by its lowest K value.<br>
Test Example 6:   Stability Test (Accelerated Test (40 , Relative Humidity 75%)<br>
In order to examine the effect of meglumin, an organic base, on the stability of glimepiride, a stability test was conducted by employing the controlled release combination formulations of Example 13 and Comparative Example 1, and the results are shown in Table 18.<br>
Table 18<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
As shown in Table 18, a large amount of sulfonamides, the main decomposition product of glimepiride, was detected for the formulation of Comparative Example 1 which does not contain meglumin, after 6 months under the accelerated condition. Therefore, it was confirmed that, when meglumine was not added to the formulation, the glimepiride stability becomes poor and, its effective concentration becomes lower.<br>
