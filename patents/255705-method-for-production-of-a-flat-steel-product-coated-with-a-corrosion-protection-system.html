				<td>METHOD FOR PRODUCTION OF A FLAT STEEL PRODUCT COATED WITH A<br>
CORROSION PROTECTION SYSTEM<br>
The invention concerns a method for production of a flat<br>
steel product coated with a corrosion protection system in<br>
which a zinc-based coating is applied to a steel substrate<br>
such as a steel strip or sheet by means of hot dip coating<br>
and in which an organic coating is applied to the zinc-<br>
based coating.<br>
To improve the resistance to corrosion, in particular on<br>
steel sheets or strips, metallic coatings are applied which<br>
in the majority of applications are based on zinc or zinc<br>
alloys. Such zinc or zinc alloy coatings, because of their<br>
barrier and cathodic protective effect, provide good<br>
protection in practical use for the steel sheet coated in<br>
this way.<br>
The corrosion resistance of zinc-coated sheet metal is<br>
further improved by application of organic coatings which<br>
in practice usually comprise lacquer systems constructed of<br>
several layers. One method for applying such a lacquer<br>
system to steel sheets with a zinc coating for example is<br>
described in WO 98/24857. According to this known method,<br>
the substrate surface is first cleaned. Then if necessary<br>
an organic and/or inorganic pre-treatment agent is applied<br>
to the coating. Then the coating layer prepared in this way<br>
is given a coating of a so-called primer as an adhesion<br>
promotion agent, on which in turn is applied, by means of<br>
spraying, dipping, scraping, rolling or spreading, a<br><br>
 lacquer containing an amine-modified epoxy resin and a<br>
reticulation agent suitable for cross-linking. After<br>
application of this lacquer, this is baked and where<br>
necessary a removable or permanent film laid over the<br>
lacquer film to protect it from damage during transport or<br>
further processing, or to establish specific surface<br>
properties. The advantage achieved by this method is that<br>
with corresponding preparation of the coating surface, the<br>
primer shows little or no surface disruption and no<br>
adhesion problems occur. Substrates coated in this way<br>
therefore have good, even surface quality and are<br>
characterised by good formability, durability, resistance<br>
to chemical substances, corrosion and weathering.<br>
In the prior art explained above, there is regularly a need<br>
for pre-treatment of a coating surface which has the<br>
disadvantage not only of associated cost but also in<br>
particular that the pre-treatment agent is usually harmful<br>
to the environment. One possibility for applying a lacquer<br>
system directly to the untreated surface without special<br>
pre-treatment is described in DE 103 00 751 Al. According<br>
to the method described in this publication, by the use of<br>
a suitable corrosion protection composition described in<br>
more detail in DE 103 00 751 Al, and while observing<br>
specific layer thicknesses and establishing a particular<br>
flexibility and adhesion strength of the coating, it is<br>
possible to produce, on a hot galvanised sheet with no<br>
further pre-treatment, a coating layer which is only 4-8<br>
µm thick and which ensures a high corrosion resistance.<br>
However such methods, because of the complexity of the<br>
influences and operating parameters to be taken into<br>
account in their performance, are regarded as laborious and<br><br>
can only be implemented with difficulty under the crude operating conditions which usually predominate in practice.<br>
The object of the invention is to specify a method which<br>
allows economic production of highly corrosion-resistant<br>
flat steel products which at the same time are easy to<br>
process further.<br>
This object is achieved with a method for production of a<br>
flat steel product coated with a corrosion protection<br>
system in which a zinc-based coating is applied to a steel<br>
substrate such as a steel strip or sheet by means of hot<br>
dip coating, and in which an organic coating is applied to<br>
the zinc-based coating, in that such a method comprises the<br>
following work steps:<br>
-	preheating the steel substrate in a preheating oven to<br>
a strip temperature of 720 to 850°C under inert gas<br>
atmosphere;<br>
cooling the steel substrate to a strip inlet<br>
temperature of 400 - 600°C;<br>
-	hot dip coating of the steel substrate under air<br>
exclusion in a zinc bath which contains, as well as<br>
zinc and unavoidable impurities, (in wt. %) 0.15 - 5%<br>
Al, 0.2 - 3% Mg and optionally in total up to 0.8% of<br>
one or more elements of the group Pb, Bi, Cd, Ti, B,<br>
Si, Cu, Ni, Co, Cr, Mn, Sn and rare earths, and with<br>
bath temperature of 420 - 500°C, wherein the<br>
difference between the strip immersion temperature and<br>
bath temperature varies in the range from -20°C to<br>
+100°C, so that on the steel substrate a metallic<br>
corrosion protection coating is formed which (in wt.<br>
%) contains 0.25 - 2.5% Mg, 0.2 - 3.0% Al, 
and optionally in total up to 0.8% of one or more<br><br>
elements of the group Pb, Bi, Cd, Ti, B, Si, Cu, Ni,<br>
Co, Cr, Mn, Sn and rare earths, remainder zinc and<br>
unavoidable impurities and which has an Al content of<br>
maximum 0.5 wt. % in an intermediate layer extending<br>
between a surface layer directly adjacent to the<br>
surface of the flat steel product and a border layer<br>
adjacent to the steel substrate and with a thickness<br>
amounting to at least 20% of the total thickness of<br>
the corrosion protection coating;<br>
adjusting the thickness of the metallic corrosion<br>
protection coating applied to the steel substrate in<br>
the melt bath to values of 3 - 20 µm per side by<br>
scraping away excess coating material;<br>
cooling the steel substrate with the metallic<br>
corrosion protection coating; and<br>
- Applying the organic coating to the metallic corrosion<br>
protection coating of the steel substrate.<br>
According to the invention, a steel substrate present in<br>
the form of a fine steel sheet or strip is subject to a<br>
coating process, the work steps of which, with regard to<br>
the economics of large scale implementation, are preferably<br>
performed in continuous passage. The through speeds set in<br>
practice can, depending on the efficiency and time required<br>
for the processing step concerned, lie in the range of 60 -<br>
150 m/min.<br>
As part of the method according to the invention, first the<br>
steel substrate is preheated. Preheating can be carried out<br>
for example in a preheating oven of the type DFF (Direct<br>
Fired Furnace) or RTF (Radiant Tube Furnace). In order to<br>
prevent oxidation of the surface of the steel substrate on<br><br>
heating, the annealing concerned is performed under inert<br>
gas which in the known manner can have a hydrogen<br>
proportion of at least 3.5 vol.% to typically 75 vol.%.<br>
In order to prepare the steel substrate optimally for the<br>
subsequent coating step, the maximum strip temperature<br>
achieved, depending on steel type, is set at 720 to 850°C.<br>
After heating the steel substrate enters the zinc bath<br>
under air exclusion. This can be achieved in the known<br>
manner for example by introducing the substrate into the<br>
melt bath through a blow pipe connected with the interior<br>
of the annealing furnace and with its opening submerged in<br>
the melt bath.<br>
The melt bath comprises a melt which, as well as zinc and<br>
the usual production-induced impurities, has contents of<br>
magnesium and aluminium. The composition of the melt is<br>
chosen so that on the steel substrate a metallic corrosion<br>
protection coating containing Zn-Mg-Al-Fe is formed.<br>
Because of the distribution of the alloy elements it<br>
contains, this has firstly optimum adhesion to the steel<br>
substrate and secondly a surface composition which is<br>
suitable for direct application of an organic coating<br>
without complex pre-treatment. At the same time the coating<br>
has excellent weldability which makes the flat steel<br>
products according to the invention particularly suitable<br>
for spot welding.<br>
By using the method according to the invention, the layer<br>
structure of the coating can be formed so that in its<br>
surface border layer directly adjacent to the surface, the<br>
thickness of which is restricted to max 10% of the total<br><br>
thickness of the coating, the elements Mg and Al are<br>
initially present enriched as oxides. In addition Zn oxide<br>
is present at the surface. The amount of Al enrichment at<br>
the immediate surface is maximum approx 1 wt. %. The oxide<br>
layer formed on the zinc alloy coating passivates the<br>
surface and allows direct lacquer adhesion.<br>
The thinner the surface border layer, the better the<br>
coatability and weldability of the metal corrosion<br>
protection coating produced in the hot dip method.<br>
Therefore the operating parameters for the zinc dip coating<br>
according to the invention are preferably set so that the<br>
thickness of the surface border layer is less than 5%, in<br>
particular less than 1% of the total thickness of the metal<br>
coating.<br>
Next to the surface border layer, up to a thickness of at<br>
least 25% of the total thickness of the coating, is an<br>
intermediate layer with Al content of maximum 0.25 wt. %.<br>
In its border layer adjacent firstly to the intermediate<br>
layer and secondly to the steel substrate, the Al content<br>
then rises to 4.5% at the border to the steel substrate.<br>
The Mg enrichment at the immediate surface of the coating<br>
is clearly greater than the Al enrichment. Here Mg<br>
proportions of up to 10% are reached. Thereafter the Mg<br>
proportion diminishes over the intermediate layer and, at a<br>
depth of around 25% of the total layer thickness of the<br>
coating, amounts to 0.5 to 2%. Over the border layer there<br>
is a rise in Mg content in the direction of the steel<br>
substrate. At the border to the steel substrate the Mg<br>
content is up to 3.5%. The low Al content in the<br>
intermediate layer guarantees particularly good weldability<br>
and even formation of the surface, while the Fe alloyed<br><br>
into the border layer ensures particularly good adhesion of<br>
the coating to the steel substrate. The excellent corrosion<br>
protection effect of the coating also achieved with low<br>
coating thicknesses is guaranteed by the high content of Mg<br>
and Al in the border layer.<br>
The data given here and in the claims on the structure of<br>
the corrosion protection coating and its individual layers<br>
relate to a layer profile determined by GDOS measurement<br>
(glow discharge optical emission spectrometry). The GDOS<br>
measurement method described for example in the VDI<br>
Glossary of Material Technology, issued by Hubert Grafen,<br>
VDI-Verlag GmbH, Diisseldorf, 1993, is a standard method for<br>
rapid detection of a concentration profile of coatings.<br>
In particular the properties listed above are achieved with<br>
a metallic corrosion protection coating produced according<br>
to the invention if the Al content of the melt bath is 0.15<br>
- 0.4 wt. %. It has been found that with such relatively<br>
low Al contents of a melt bath used in the method for<br>
carrying out the invention, suitable setting of the strip<br>
immersion and/or bath temperature itself can directly<br>
influence the structure of the desired layer system<br>
according to the invention.<br>
In the method according to the invention, during the hot<br>
dip coating it is achieved that high Al and Mg contents are<br>
enriched in the border layer of the metallic corrosion<br>
protection coating adjacent to the steel substrate, whereas<br>
in the intermediate layer in particular low Al contents are<br>
present. The difference between the temperature of the<br>
strip on immersion and the temperature of the melt bath has<br>
a particular significance. As this difference varies in the<br><br>
range from -20°C to 100°C, preferably -10°C to 70°C, the<br>
minimised presence of Al according to the invention in the<br>
intermediate layer can be set securely and in a targeted<br>
manner.<br>
To support further the formation of the layer structure of<br>
the metallic corrosion protection coating to be set<br>
according to the invention, the Mg content of the melt bath<br>
can be restricted to 0.2 to 2.0 wt. %, in particular 0.5 to<br>
1.5 wt. %. Elements of the group Pb, Bi, Cd, Ti, B, Si, Cu,<br>
Ni, Co, Cr, Mn, Sn and rare earths can be present in a<br>
corrosion protection coating produced according to the<br>
invention up to a total content of 0.8 wt. % in the coating<br>
according to the invention. Pb, Bi and Cd serve to form a<br>
larger crystal structure (flower of zinc), Ti, B, Si to<br>
improve formability, Cu, Ni, Co, Cr, Mn to influence the<br>
border layer reactions, Sn to influence the surface<br>
oxidation and rare earths, in particular lanthanum and<br>
cerium, to improve the flow behaviour of the melt. The<br>
impurities which may be contained in a corrosion protection<br>
coating according to the invention include the constituents<br>
which enter the surface coating from the steel substrate as<br>
a result of the hot dip coating in quantities which do not<br>
influence the properties of the surface coating.<br>
After passing through the galvanising part, in the method<br>
according to the invention the thickness of the surface<br>
coating is set to 3 - 20 µm which corresponds to a coating<br>
mass of the metallic corrosion protection coating of 20 -<br>
140 g/m2 per side. The excellent corrosion protection<br>
effect of coatings formed according to the invention allows<br>
the thickness of the coating to be restricted to values of<br>
4-12 µm, which corresponds to a coating mass of 30 - 85<br><br>
g/m2 per side. Steel substrates with such thin coatings can<br>
be processed further particularly well.<br>
The scraping away of excess surface coating material to set<br>
the coating thickness can for example be achieved in the<br>
known manner by means of gas jets applied by a nozzle<br>
scraper system. The gas for the gas jets is preferably<br>
nitrogen in order to limit as far as possible any oxidation<br>
of the surface of the coating.<br>
After the steel strip with the zinc-based metallic<br>
corrosion protection coating containing Mg and Al has been<br>
guided out of the zinc bath, it is cooled in a targeted<br>
manner. The final temperature reached typically corresponds<br>
to room temperature.<br>
Then the steel substrate with the metallic corrosion<br>
protection coating can be subjected to temper rolling in<br>
order to achieve a surface texturing optimally suited to<br>
the subsequent coating. Both the controlled cooling and any<br>
temper rolling performed are carried out preferably, with<br>
regard to economics and efficiency, in line and in a<br>
continuous passage with the galvanising process.<br>
Finally, the steel substrate coated in the manner of the<br>
invention is organically coated. This can take place in a<br>
separate strip coating plant or also in line directly after<br>
cooling and/or any necessary additional tempering. A<br>
process following continuously after the preceding work<br>
step is favourable here because then the coating can be<br>
applied directly to the freshly produced metallic surface<br>
with particularly good working results. In particular, when<br>
the organic coating follows the preceding work step in<br><br>
line, it avoids the metallic coating being changed by<br>
ageing, oiling or degreasing.<br>
In principle however it is also conceivable for the organic<br>
coating to be applied in the known manner discontinuously<br>
via a separate coil coating plant. To this end the steel<br>
substrate fitted with the coating can, after galvanising,<br>
cooling or rolling, first be oiled to guarantee a temporary<br>
corrosion protection.<br>
A further variant is "sealing" of the substrate and<br>
galvanising. For this a layer approximately 2 µm thick made<br>
of polyacrylate or polyester is applied as simple corrosion<br>
protection and as a further processing aid which, inter<br>
alia, can be applied with thermal or UV hardening.<br>
Surprisingly it has been found that the surface present<br>
immediately after the galvanising step without cleaning and<br>
pre-treatment and not influenced by further processing<br>
steps, is particularly suited for direct application of the<br>
organic coating. Where at one point of the method according<br>
to the invention cleaning of the surface of the coating is<br>
performed, a mild cleaning has proved suitable so that the<br>
native oxide layer existing on the metallic coating is<br>
subject to minimum attack. The term "mild cleaning" in this<br>
context refers to cleaning in which the surface of the<br>
metallic corrosion protection coating is treated with a<br>
mild alkali cleaning agent (pH value 9 - 10, free<br>
alkalinity up to 14) or a strong alkali (pH value 12 -<br>
12.5, free alkalinity 5) but low concentrate cleaning<br>
agent. Cleaning agents suitable for this purpose are for<br>
example fluids based on phosphate-containing potassium or<br><br>
sodium lye, the temperature of which typically lies in the<br>
range from 40 - 70°C.<br>
Before application of the organic coating by means of<br>
spraying, dipping or using a roll coater, pre-treatment can<br>
be applied to the strip surface which passivates the<br>
metallic surface and ensures adhesion between the metal<br>
coating and the lacquer. This pre-treatment is preferably a<br>
system free from CrVI, preferably a pre-treatment totally<br>
free from Cr, which for example is produced on a basis of<br>
Ti, Zr, P and/or Si. As the native oxide layers which are<br>
created on the steel substrate carrying the coating already<br>
guarantee excellent passivation of the surface, in many<br>
applications important in practice, however, such pre-<br>
treatment may be completely omitted and the lacquer applied<br>
directly to the metallic substrate which has only been<br>
degreased.<br>
The organic coating can be applied in the known manner in<br>
the form of at least one layer (lacquer and where<br>
applicable film) by means of roll coaters, spraying,<br>
dipping etc. In this way it is possible to form a single<br>
layer or multilayer structure in which the following layers<br>
or layer systems are implemented and where applicable can<br>
be combined:<br>
1.	Lacquer<br>
2.	Lacquer - film<br>
3.	Lacquer - film - lacquer<br>
4.	Lacquer (with and without adhesive)<br>
This is followed by hardening of the coating by means of<br>
heat supply or radiation. With regard to the economics of<br>
the process, hardening by radiation, in particular UV<br><br>
radiation, is advantageous. Hardening by radiation requires<br>
no thermal afterburning of released solvents. Also a system<br>
for UV hardening can be implemented in a construction<br>
length which is substantially shorter than the length which<br>
would be required for a circulating air oven required for<br>
thermal drying.<br>
Flat steel products produced according to the invention<br>
with a metallic and an organic coating have, with reduced<br>
coating thickness, protection of open cut surfaces which is<br>
substantially better than that of conventionally coated<br>
steel substrates and improved migration properties at<br>
scratches and cut edges.<br>
Where corresponding pre-treatment is necessary, with the<br>
method according to the invention using pre-treatment<br>
agents free from CrVI, the corrosion protection properties<br>
achieved are at least as good as in products which are pre-<br>
treated according to the prior art with agents containing<br>
CrVI.<br>
The invention is now explained in more detail below with<br>
reference to embodiment examples in the drawings. These<br>

Two possible sequences within the framework of the<br>
invention of individual work steps of the method according<br>
to the invention are depicted graphically as examples in<br>
diagrams 1 and 2.<br>
In the variant shown in diagram 1, all work steps are<br>
performed in a continuous passage. The steel substrate<br>
concerned (sheet or strip steel) is first preheated, then<br>
hot dip galvanised and, after setting the thickness of the<br>
metallic coating produced on the substrate, rolled to form<br>
an optimised surface structure with a low degree of<br>
deformation. Then an organic coating system formed from a<br>
primer and a lacquer is applied either directly onto the<br>
metallic corrosion protection coating without intermediate<br>
cleaning and preparation, or onto the metallic corrosion<br>
protection coating only after cleaning and where applicable<br>
pre-treatment following the rolling.<br><br>
In the sequence shown in diagram 2, the work steps "pre-<br>
heating", "galvanising", "thickness setting" and "rolling"<br>
are performed in a continuous passage, as in the method<br>
shown in diagram 1. Then the steel substrate obtained after<br>
rolling, and coated with the corrosion protection coating,<br>
is first temporarily stored before - after cleaning of its<br>
surface to be provided with the organic coating - being<br>
coated in a separate coating plant with the organic coating<br>
system formed from primer and lacquer. In order to protect<br>
from corrosion during the waiting time the surface of the<br>
metallic corrosion protection coating which is to be coated<br>
organically, the metallic corrosion protection coating can<br>
be oiled or "sealed" after rolling.<br>
To test the method according to the invention, operating<br>
tests Bl - B8 were performed in which steel strips<br>
comprising high-grade steel were used as steel substrates.<br>
The composition of the steel strips is given in table 1.<br><br>
The operating parameters set during the operating tests,<br>
the respective melt bath composition and an analysis of the<br>
corrosion protection layer resulting on the steel<br>
substrate, are given in table 2.<br>
The thickness of the surface border layer absorbing the<br>
superficial oxidation in the specimens tested was maximum<br>
0.2 µm, and in relation to the layer profile determined by<br>
GDOS measurement, lay in the range of up to 2.7% of the<br><br>
total layer thickness. The amount of Al enrichment at the<br>
direct surface is maximum approximately 1 wt. %. This is<br>
followed up to a thickness of at least 25% of the total<br>
coating thickness by the intermediate layer with low Al<br>
content of maximum 0.25 wt. %. In the border layer then the<br>
Al content rises to 4.5% at the border to the steel<br>
substrate. The Mg enrichment at the immediate surface of<br>
the coating is clearly greater than the Al enrichment. Here<br>
Mg proportions of up to 20% are achieved. Thereafter the Mg<br>
proportion diminishes over the intermediate layer and at a<br>
depth of around 25% of the total layer thickness of the<br>
coating amounts to 0.5 to 2%. Over the border layer there<br>
is also a rise in Mg content in the direction of the steel<br>
substrate. At the border to the steel substrate the Mg<br>
content amounts to 3.5%.<br>
A corresponding distribution over the thickness D (surface<br>
D = 0 µm) is depicted graphically as an example in diagrams<br>
3 and 4 which show the result of a GDOS measurement of two<br>
typical layer structures of metallic corrosion protection<br>
coatings produced on the steel substrate according to the<br>
invention.<br>
Diagrams 3 and 4 show that at the surface of the coating<br>
concerned, a surface border layer has formed with a high Al<br>
content as a result of oxidation. The thickness of this<br>
surface border layer is maximum 0.2 µm and is therefore<br>
easily broken in spot or laser welding without a<br>
deterioration in the quality of the welding result.<br>
The surface border layer is followed by an intermediate<br>
layer approximately 2.5 µm thick with an Al content below<br><br>
0.2%. The thickness of the intermediate layer is therefore<br>
around 36% of the total layer thickness of the corrosion<br>
protection coating of 7 µm.<br>
The intermediate layer transforms into a border layer<br>
adjacent to the steel substrate in which the contents of<br>
Al, Mg and Fe have clearly risen over the corresponding<br>
contents of the intermediate layer.<br>
Fig. 1 shows, not to scale, a cross-section of part of a<br>
steel flat product produced and composed according to the<br>
invention. According to this on side A lying on the outside<br>
in use and particularly severely exposed to corrosive<br>
attack, of a steel substrate S present as steel sheet,<br>
firstly a metallic corrosion protection coating K<br>
approximately 7.5 pm thick is applied which essentially<br>
comprises Zn, Al, Mg and Fe.<br>
Applied directly onto the surface of the corrosion<br>
protection coating K, i.e. without further pre-treatment,<br>
is a primer layer P. The thickness of the primer layer P<br>
with conventional primer products is around 5 µm. If so-<br>
called "thick layer primer" is used, the thickness of the<br>
primer layer P can be up to 20 µm.<br>
On the primer layer P a lacquer layer L is applied with a<br>
thickness of approximately 20 µm. In preparation for the<br>
lacquer application and to shorten the total drying time,<br>
the primer layer P can first be pre-treated by means of UV<br>
radiation.<br>
On the lacquer layer L is finally applied a cover lacquer<br>
coating D which is up to 17 µm thick. The primer layer P,<br><br>
lacquer layer L and cover lacquer layer D together form an<br>
organic coating which, together with the metallic corrosion<br>
protection coating K, despite the omission of pre-treatment<br>
of the surface of corrosion protection coating K, protect<br>
the steel substrate S particularly well against corrosion.<br>
On the inside I in practical use, which is less severely<br>
attacked by corrosion, of the steel substrate S is also<br>
first applied a metallic corrosion protection coating Ki<br>
approximately 7.5 µm thick which essentially comprises Zn,<br>
Al, Mg and Fe. Directly onto the surface of the corrosion<br>
protection coating Ki is applied a lacquer layer Li of<br>
thickness 5 to 10 µm.<br>
Flat steel products of the type shown in Fig. 1 are<br>
particularly suitable for use in the field of vehicle<br>
construction.<br>
Fig. 2 shows, not to scale, a cross-section of part of a<br>
second flat steel product produced and composed according<br>
to the invention and particularly suitable also for use in<br>
the field of vehicle construction. According to this, on<br>
the outside in use, which is particularly exposed to<br>
corrosive attack, of the steel substrate S present as steel<br>
sheet, is firstly applied an approximately 5 jam thick<br>
metallic corrosion protection coating K which essentially<br>
comprises Zn, Al, Mg and Fe.<br>
The surface of the corrosion protection coating K in this<br>
case has first been subjected to pre-treatment in which a<br>
thin pre-treatment coating V remains on the corrosion<br><br>
protection coating K. On the pre-treatment coating V is<br>
applied a primer layer P1 approximately 8 µm thick.<br>
The primer layer P1 carries a layer of adhesive E<br>
approximately 5 µm thick, over which on the primer layer P1<br>
is glued a laminated film F approximately 52 µm thick<br>
placed on adhesive layer E. On the outside of the laminated<br>
film F is applied a further primer layer P2, which again<br>
carries a cover lacquer layer D approximately 20 µm thick.<br>
The cover lacquer layer D forms the outer termination of<br>
the organic coating system formed from the primer layer P1,<br>
the adhesive layer E, the laminated film F, the primer<br>
layer P2 and the cover lacquer layer D.<br>
On the inside in practical use, which is less severely<br>
attacked by corrosion, of the steel substrate S is also<br>
applied first a 5 µm thick metallic corrosion protection<br>
coating Ki which essentially comprises Zn, Al, Mg and Fe.<br>
The surface of the corrosion protection coating Ki in this<br>
case is first pre-treated to form a thin pre-treatment<br>
layer Vi. Then on the pre-treatment layer V is applied a<br>
lacquer layer Li which is typically 5 µm thick.<br>
Fig. 3 shows, not to scale, a cross-section of part of a<br>
third flat steel product produced and composed according to<br>
the invention and particularly suitable for general<br>
external construction applications. According to this, on<br>
the outside in use, which is particularly exposed to<br>
corrosive attack, of the steel substrate S present as a<br>
steel sheet, is first applied an approximately 10 µm thick<br>
metallic corrosion protection coating K which essentially<br>
comprises Zn, Al, Mg and Fe. The surface of the corrosion<br><br>
protection coating K in this case too was first subject to<br>
pre-treatment in which a thin pre-treatment layer V<br>
remained on the corrosion protection coating K.<br>
Applied to the pre-treatment layer V is applied a primer<br>
layer P approximately 5 µm thick, which in turn carries a<br>
20 µm thick cover lacquer layer D.<br>
The cover lacquer layer D itself carries on its outside a<br>
removable protection film U which protects the flat steel<br>
product during transport and storage.<br>
The protective film U can however also be designed as a<br>
permanently adhering film to improve the surface<br>
properties.<br>
On the inside in practical use, which is less severely<br>
attacked by corrosion, of the steel substrate S is also<br>
first applied an approximately 10 urn thick metallic<br>
corrosion protection coating Ki which essentially comprises<br>
Zn, Al, Mg and Fe. The surface of the corrosion protection<br>
coating Ki in this case too is first pre-treated to form a<br>
thin pre-treatment layer V. Then onto the pre-treatment<br>
layer V is applied a lacquer layer Li which is typically 7<br>
to 15 µm thick.<br>
Fig. 4 shows, not to scale, a cross-section of part of a<br>
fourth flat steel product produced and composed according<br>
to the invention and particularly suitable for domestic<br>
appliance construction. According to this, on the outside<br>
in use which is heavily exposed to corrosive attack, of a<br>
steel substrate S present as a steel sheet, is first<br><br>
applied an approximately 4 to 5 µm thick metallic corrosion<br>
protection coating K which essentially comprises Zn, Al, Mg<br>
and Fe.<br>
Directly onto the surface of the corrosion protection<br>
coating K, i.e. without further pre-treatment, is applied a<br>
primer layer P approximately 8 µm thick. The primer used<br>
here is a so-called "structure primer" which forms a<br>
structured surface with protrusions and recesses.<br>
On the primer layer P is then applied a lacquer layer L<br>
with a thickness of approximately 20 µm.<br>
Where applicable, onto the lacquer layer can also be<br>
applied, for example, a permanently adhering protective<br>
layer which serves, inter alia, to improve the surface<br>
properties.<br>
On the inside of the steel substrate S which is less<br>
severely attacked by corrosion, is also first applied an<br>
approximately 4 to 5 µm thick metallic corrosion protection<br>
coating Ki which essentially comprises Zn, Al, Mg and Fe.<br>
Directly onto the surface of the corrosion protection,<br>
coating Ki is applied a lacquer layer Li with a thickness<br>
of 7 to 10 µm.<br><br><br><br>
