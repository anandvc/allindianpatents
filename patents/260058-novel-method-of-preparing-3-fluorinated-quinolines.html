According to the invention, the products of general<br>
formula (I) are obtained by a process wherein a compound of<br>
general formula (IV)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
in which RI, R2, R3 and R4 are as defined hereinabove, is<br>
subjected to a Hofmann degradation, so as to obtain a<br>
compound of general formula (III)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
in which Rlf R2, R3 and R4 are as defined hereinabove, which is<br>
treated under conditions capable of forming the diazonium<br>
salt of general formula (II)<br>
 (Figure Removed)<br>
in which RI, R2, RS and R4 are as defined hereinabove, which is<br>
heated in an inert organic solvent to a temperature of<br>
between 35 and 120°C.<br>
The Hofmann degradation is carried out with bromine and<br>
sodium hydroxide, and also pyridine, in water, at a<br>
temperature of approximately 60°C.<br>
The conditions for preparing the diazonium salt consist,<br>
for example, in carrying out the process in the presence of<br>
an alkali metal salt or of an ester of nitrous acid, in<br>
particular of sodium nitrite or of potassium nitrite or of<br>
tert-butyl or isobutyl nitrite, and of fluoroboric acid, or<br>
in the presence of boron trifluoride-ethyl ether complex, in<br>
an appropriate solvent, in particular THF, water or an<br>
alcohol, at a temperature between +15 and +20°C.<br>
In order to convert the compound of formula (II) to a<br>
compound of formula (I), the process is preferably carried<br>
out in a solvent such as toluene, xylene, heptane, hexane, a<br>
fluorinated solvent such as perfluorohexane, or else a<br>
chlorinated solvent such as mono- or dichlorobenzene,<br>
chlorobutane or methylene chloride.<br>
The heating temperature is preferably between 60 and<br>
100°C and depends, of course, on the solvent used.<br>
A subject of the invention is also a process according<br>
to the above, wherein the compound of general formula (IV) is<br>
obtained by subjecting a compound of formula (V)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>

represents a chlorine atom or a bromine atom and alk<br>
represents an alkyl radical containing from 1 to 6 carbon<br>
atoms, to the action of a hydrogenolysis agent, and then to<br>
that of aqueous ammonia, so as to obtain successively the<br>
compound of formula (VI)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
which may or may not be isolated, and then the compound of<br>
formula (IV).<br>
According to the invention, the two reactions above may<br>
be carried out in the reverse order, the compound<br>
intermediately formed, and which may or may not be isolated,<br>
then being the compound of formula (VII)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The hydrogenolysis reaction is carried out in an<br>
alcohol, in particular ethanol or methanol, in the presence<br>
of triethylamine and of a catalyst such as palladium-oncharcoal,<br>
by sparging hydrogen into the reaction medium.<br>
It is also possible to carry out the process in<br>
dimethylformamide, in the presence of sodium formate and of<br>
tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium.<br>
A subject of the invention is also a process according<br>
to the above, wherein the compound of formula (V) is obtained<br>
by subjecting a compound of formula (VIII)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
in which R!, R2, R3 and R4 and alk are as defined hereinabove,<br>
to the action of phosphorus oxychloride or phosphorus<br>
oxybromide.<br>
The, process is preferably carried out without a solvent,<br>
at a temperature in the order of about 100°C.<br>
A subject of the invention is also a process according<br>
to the above, wherein the compound of formula (IV) is<br>
obtained by treating a compound of formula (VIII), as defined<br>
above, with a base, so as to obtain a corresponding acid of<br>
formula (IX)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
in which Rx, R2, RS and R4 are as defined hereinabove, which is<br>
subjected to the action of phosphorus oxychloride or of<br>
phosphorus oxybromide, so as to obtain a compound of formula<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
in which RI, R2/ RS, R4 and X are as defined hereinabove, which<br>
is subjected to the action of ammonia so as to obtain a<br>
compound of formula (VII) as defined above, which is<br>
subjected to the action of a hydrogenolysis agent.<br>
The saponification reaction is carried out under<br>
conventional conditions known to those skilled in the art, in<br>
particular by the action of sodium hydroxide or potassium<br>
hydroxide in aqueous medium at reflux temperature.<br>
The action of the phosphorus oxychloride or the<br>
phosphorus oxybromide is preferably carried out at the reflux<br>
temperature thereof, without solvent.<br>
The hydrogenolysis agent is one of those which were<br>
mentioned above.<br>
A subject of the invention is also a process according<br>
to the above, wherein the compound of formula (IV) is<br>
obtained by heating a compound of formula (XI)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
in which Rl7 R2, RS, R4 and alk are as defined hereinabove, in<br>
the presence of phosphorus pentoxide, so as to obtain a<br>
compound of formula (IX) as defined above, and then pursuing<br>
the synthesis as described above.<br>
The reaction of the phosphorus pentoxide with the<br>
compound of formula (XI) is preferably carried out in a<br>
solvent such as nitrobenzene at a temperature in the order of<br>
about 120-130°C.<br>
The compound of formula (V) may also be obtained by<br>
subjecting a compound of formula (XI) as defined above to the<br>
action of phosphorus oxychloride or of phosphorus oxybromide.<br>
The process is preferably carried out without solvent,<br>
at a temperature in the order of about 100°C, starting with a<br>
compound of formula (XI) in which the sensitive groups on R1;<br>
R2, R3 and R4 are pre-protected.<br>
The compound of formula (VIII) may be obtained by<br>
heating a compound of formula (XI) as defined above, in a<br>
solvent with a high boiling point.<br>
The cyclization of the compound of formula (XI) is<br>
preferably carried out in diphenyl ether, at reflux<br>
temperature or at a temperature similar to the reflux of the<br>
latter.<br>
The compound of general formula (XI) is obtained by<br>
reacting a compound of general formula (XII)<br>
in which Rx, R2/ R3 and R4 are as defined hereinabove, with <br>
compound of general formula (XIII)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
in which alk is as defined hereinabove and alkx represents a<br>
linear or branched alkyl radical which may be. identical or<br>
different to alk.<br>
Under preferential conditions, the reaction is carried<br>
out without the addition of a solvent, by heating to a<br>
temperature of from about 80 to about 120°C.<br>
According to the definitions of RI, R2/ R3 and R4, it may<br>
be desirable, or even necessary, depending on the type of<br>
reaction involved, to use compounds in which the substituents<br>
are protected. These are in particular the alkyl<br>
substituents substituted with OR5 or with NR'R", OR6, NRR'<br>
and GO2Ra-<br>
A subject of the invention is in particular a process as<br>
defined above, wherein use is made of compounds in which the<br>
possible sensitive substituents are protected, during the<br>
preparation of the compounds of formula (X) from the<br>
compounds of formula (IX) and also during the Hofmann<br>
degradation producing the compounds of formula (III) from the<br>
compounds of formula (IV). According to the invention, the<br>
compounds involved are either protected from the beginning of<br>
synthesis or just before the critical step is carried out.<br>
The protective groups which may be used and also the use<br>
thereof are known to those skilled in the art and described,<br>
for example, by T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Nuts, "Protective<br>
Groups in Organic Synthesis" (John Wiley &amp; Sons, inc.).<br>
A subject of the invention is in particular a process<br>
according to the above, wherein use is made of compounds in<br>
which RI, R2, Ra and R4, which may be identical or different,<br>
represent a hydrogen atom, a fluorine atom, an optionally<br>
substituted linear or branched alkyl radical as defined<br>
above, or a radical ORe as defined above.<br>
The subject of the invention is more particularly a<br>
process wherein use is made of compounds in which Rl7 R2, RS<br>
and R4, which may be identical or different, represent a<br>
hydrogen atom, a fluorine atom or a radical OR6 as defined<br>
above, and in particular an alkoxy radical.<br>
Finally, a subject of the invention is a compound of<br>
formula (II) as defined above.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are intermediate compounds<br>
useful in particular in the preparation of compounds having<br>
antibacterial activity, described, for example, in<br>
applications WO 02/72572 and WO 02/40474.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention without,<br>
however, limiting it.<br>
Example 1: Preparation of 3 -f luoro-6-tnethoxyquinoline <br>
A suspension of 1007 g of 6-methoxy-3-quinolinediazonium<br>
fluoroborate taken in 9 1 of toluene is heated to 60°C in<br>
85 minutes. A release of gas is observed at 60°C. The<br>
reaction medium is then gradually heated further for 90<br>
minutes to 70-72°C. After having been kept at 72°C for 90<br>
minutes, the medium is then gradually heated again to 85°C.<br>
After cooling and stirring overnight, 4 1 of ice-cold water<br>
are added to the suspension. After having stirred for 15<br>
minutes, 2.5 1 of ethyl acetate are added. After having<br>
stirred for 45 minutes, the pH is adjusted to pH = 7-7.5 by<br>
adding 47% sodium hydroxide (250 ml). The medium is stirred<br>
for 30 minutes and then separated by settling out for 1 hour.<br>
The lower aqueous phase is re-extracted with ethyl acetate.<br>
The organic phases are combined together and washed with<br>
water. The solution is filtered and then concentrated under<br>
reduced pressure so as to give 655 g of crude 3-fluoro-<br>
6-methoxyquinoline. The crude product is distilled under<br>
reduced pressure. The distillation fractions (bp 103-110°C<br>
under 1 mbar) containing the expected product are combined<br>
together. 498.9 g of 3-fluoro-6-methoxyquinoline (76%) are<br>
thus obtained in the form of a white solid which melts at<br>
51-53°C.<br>

3-Amino-6-methoxyquinoline (10 g) are suspended in 50 ml of<br>
THF and stirred for 15 minutes at 20°C, before being cooled<br>
to -15°C. 11.6 g of BF3-etherate are then added. The<br>
temperature of the reaction mass is brought to -15°C. After<br>
15 minutes at this temperature, 7.5 g of tert-butyl nitrite<br>
at 90% in solution in 25 ml of THF are added over 10 minutes.<br>
The suspension is stirred for 1 hour at -15°C, before being<br>
brought to +15°C over a period of one hour. The precipitate<br>
is filtered off, washed with hexane and then dried at 15-20°C<br>
under constant pressure until a constant weight is obtained.<br>

are obtained in the form of a yellow solid.<br>
Decomposition temperature: 82°C<br>
3-Amino-6-methoxyquinoline:<br>
104 kg of a 32% sodium hydroxide solution are added to 341 kg<br>
of water. The solution is cooled to 0°C and 22.0 kg of<br>
bromine are introduced over 1.5 hours while maintaining the<br>
temperature at 0°C. The solution is stirred at this<br>
temperature for 1 hour, and then 409 kg of pyridine are<br>
introduced over 3 hours at 0°C. 26.5 kg of 6-methoxyquinoline<br>
-3 -carboxamide are then added over 50 minutes at<br>
0°C. The reaction medium is kept at this temperature for<br>
2 hours and then gradually heated to 60°C over 1 hour. After<br>
maintaining the temperature at 60°C for 6 hours, the reaction<br>
mass is cooled to 20°C and separated by settling out. The<br>
aqueous phase (172 kg) is washed with pyridine (60 liters).<br>
The organic phases are pooled (820 kg) and concentrated <br>
dryness under reduced pressure (100-150 mbar) at a maximum of<br>
84°C. The residue is then taken up with 425 1 of water <br>
43 1 of ethanol. The suspension obtained is refluxed for<br>
1 hour and then cooled. The product begins to precipitate <br>
a temperature of 65°C. The medium is then cooled to 0-5°C,<br>
and kept at this temperature for 2 hours. The precipitate is<br>
filtered off, washed with cold water, and then dried at<br>
50-55°C under reduced pressure. 16.5 kg (72.3%) of 3-amino-<br>
6-methoxyquinoline are obtained in the form of a brown solid<br>
(HPLC titer = 99.1%), having a melting point of 108-110°C.<br>

6-Methoxyquinoline-3-carboxamide:<br>
380 1 of ethanol are added to 49.2 kg of 4-chloro-3-ethoxycarbonyl-<br>
6-methoxyquinoline. The suspension is heated at<br>
45°C for 30 minutes and then cooled to 20°C. 18.65 kg of<br>
triethylamine are added under nitrogen, followed by 1.91 kg<br>
of palladium-on-charcoal at 5% (at 60% water content). A<br>
stream of hydrogen is passed through under 0.5-0.8 bar at<br>
33°C for 48 hours. At this time, an HPLC1 control shows that<br>
the reaction is complete. The reactor is then vented with<br>
nitrogen and the reaction medium is then filtered to remove<br>
the catalyst. The filter is then rinsed with ethanol. The<br>
filtrate is poured over 750 kg of an aqueous ammonia<br>
solution. The reaction medium is then stirred at 25°C over a<br>
period of 4 days. The ethanol is then removed by<br>
distillation under reduced pressure at a temperature not<br>
exceeding 40-45°C. The suspension thus obtained is cooled to<br>
0-5°C and stirred for 3 hours at this temperature. The<br>
precipitate is filtered off, washed with cold water, and then<br>
dried at 60-65°C under reduced pressure until a constant<br>
weight is obtained. 26.5 kg (71%) of 6-methoxyquinoline-3-<br>

132 g of phosphoryl chloride are added, at 25°C, to 50 g <br>
diethyl 2-[(4-methoxyphenylamino)methylene]malonate. The<br>
reaction medium is stirred for 15 minutes at this<br>
temperature, heated to 95-100°C over 45 minutes, and then<br>
kept at this temperature for 4 hours. The excess phosphoryl<br>
chloride is then removed by heating at 125°C for<br>
approximately 2 hours. The mixture is then cooled to 25°C<br>
and 125 ml of dichloromethane are added. The medium is then<br>
stirred at 25°C for 1 hour, and then run into 900 ml of<br>
water, over 30 minutes, while maintaining the temperature<br>
below.30°G. The pH is then adjusted, to 7.5-8 by adding 172 g<br>
of. a 47% -• sodium hydroxide solution, while maintaining the<br>
temperature at 20-25°C. The 2 phases are sepa'rated and the<br>
