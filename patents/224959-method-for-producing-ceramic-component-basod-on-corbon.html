				<td>Description<br>
Method for producing a ceramic component based on carbon.<br>
The invention relates to a method for producing a ceramic component based<br>
on carbon, using a cellulose-containing, especially lignocellulose-containing<br>
semi-finished molded piece, which is pyrolyzed in a non-oxidizing gas<br>
atmosphere.<br>
Ceramic components having large surfaces, especially wall thickness<br>
between 0.2 and 20 mm, and consisting of carbon or silicone carbide are<br>
used e.g. as firing or sintering bases, as carrier and charging systems or as<br>
lightweight components in furnaces and heat exchangers. The use of carbon<br>
materials e.g. in furnace construction has proven useful especially due to<br>
their low density, sufficient resistance and good stability at high<br>
temperatures of over 2000Â°C in a non-oxidizing atmosphere. If even higher<br>
resistance and stiffness requirements have to be met, silicone carbide<br>
materials are used.<br>
In the production of large components and articles various powder<br>
technology methods can be employed. To this end, carbon and/or graphite<br>
power is mixed with a binder agent having a high carbon content, such as<br>
pitch, resin or cellulose-containing solutions, pressed into molds and cured<br>
through thermal treatment. If necessary, another mechanical and chemical<br>
final treatment step can be performed to harden the surface. The<br>
disadvantage of this technology, which is preferably employed for the<br>
production of large carbon items with thin walls, is above all the high<br>
equipment-related complexity that is required to produce good and<br>
reproducible powder and binder agent quality. Moreover the scrap rate is<br>
relatively high contributing to the high manufacturing costs.<br>
In the manufacture of large carbon products also carbon-fiber reinforced<br>
carbon (CFC) materials are used. To produce these, carbon fibers in form of<br>
fleece, mats or fabrics are saturated in part several times with resins such as<br>
phenol resins and are subsequently pyrolyzed. These materials combine the<br>
properties of polycrystalline carbon with the benefits of high-strength carbon<br>
fibers and represent composites that exhibit high stability, high tear<br>
resistance, high thermal shock resistance, low density and good mechanical<br>
forming abilities (M. Leuchs, J Sporer, "Langfaserverstarkte Keramik - eine<br>
neue Werkstoffklasse (Long-Fiber Reinforced Ceramics - A New Material<br>
Category)". Keram Zeitschrift (Ceramics Magazine) 49, 18-22 (1997). Due<br>
to the high manufacturing costs, however, a comprehensive use is not given.<br>
DE 198 23 507 relates to a method for producing shaped bodies on the basis<br>
of carbon, carbides and/or carbonitrides. In doing so, biogenic materials are<br>
used, which are converted into a product mainly containing carbon by<br>
carbonizationand are subsequently processed to obtain shaped bodies with a<br>
high carbon content. As biogenic starting materials fiber composites in form<br>
of fleece, mats or fabrics, ie. long-fiber composites, as well as large thin-<br>
walled surface structures are suggested here. In their ruse as carbon<br>
materials with a mechanical function, corresponding technical surface<br>
structures are subject to significant restrictions since the achievable carbon<br>
density is too low for most applications so that the resistance values do not<br>
meet the requirements of the mechanically highly stressed components. Such<br>
a product can also be used as a carbon platen for a reaction siliconization<br>
only to a limited extent since a high percentage of free silicone in the end<br>
product causes significant restrictions in the corrosion and high-temperature<br>
behavior.<br>
The use of ligneous products as starting materials for inexpensive SiC<br>
ceramics, which are formed by means of a so-called "Biocarbon pre-mold"<br>
through liquid phase siliconization, is known from "Krenkel Biomorphe<br>
SiC-Keramiken aus technischen Holzern (Biomorphous SiC ceramics made<br>
of industrial wood)", "Composite Materials and Material Composites"<br>
Symposium, Editors K. Schulte, K. Kainer Publishing House Wiley Chemie<br>
Weinheim 1999 as well as "Low cost ceramics from wooden products".<br>
Materials Week, Munich 09/23-09/28/2000. In experiments above all<br>
carbon bodies were siliconized from pyrolyzed veneer plywood and<br>
transferred into a C/SiC/Si material.<br>
From DE 199 47 731 Al we know of a method for producing a component<br>
made from SiC ceramics. To this end, a ceramic component is produced<br>
from a cellulose-containing starting body through pyrolysis and subsequent<br>
infiltration of silicon. The starting body consist of an industrial semi-finished<br>
product, which is made from cellulose-containing material in form of chips<br>
and/or individual layers of wooden sheets. In doing so, the structure of the<br>
semi-finished part is adjusted through various ratios of the cellulose-<br>
containing material and binder agent, wherein the binder agent content<br>
amounts to more than 5%. Based on the layer formation and the selection of<br>
the cellulose-containing material a semi-finished product is created that has<br>
a high percentage of translaminar pore channels, facilitating the infiltration<br>
of liquid silicon. In a layered semi-finished product, this process is enhanced<br>
further through the formation of cracks during pyrolysis. However, this<br>
inhomogeneous, heavily porous structure leads to a carbon platen that can be<br>
used for only very limited SiSiC special applications. The resulting high<br>
percentage of free Si in the end product limits both the mechanical<br>
properties and the corrosion and high-temperature behaviors significantly.<br>
From JP 2001-048648 we know about producing a component on the basis<br>
of carbon using a lignocellulose-containing semi-finished formed part,<br>
which is pyrolyzed in the absence of oxygen. The formed carbon parts have<br>
a low mechanical stability.<br>
WO 01/64602 relates to a ceramic component that has been produced on the<br>
basis of a lignocellulose-containing semi-finished molded part. The material<br>
composition and processing technology result in a low material density as<br>
well as structural and density inhomogeneities.<br>
From DE 39 22 539 C2 we know of a method for producing high-precision<br>
heating elements out of carbon-fiber reinforced carbon (CFC), which<br>
suggests a pressed carbon fiber textile fabric or wound carbon monofilament<br>
fibers as the starting bodies. It is then possible to siliconize the pyrolyzed<br>
body.<br>
A significant disadvantage of the method pursuant to the prior art is that the<br>
large products that have been produced with the powder technology or by<br>
means of a fiber winding operation are complex and expensive since special<br>
molding tools, or fiber winding assemblies are required. Another<br>
disadvantage consists of the fact that structure such as bores, recesses or the<br>
like, as is required for special application purposes, have to be either<br>
integrated into the molding tool as extremely high additional cost or must be<br>
inserted later on into the rigid and partially brittle fiber composite carbon<br>
product.<br>
Carbon of SiC materials that are produced from chips or venner plywood are<br>
inhomogeneous. Wood is characterized by a distinct anisotropy, which is<br>
also maintained in macroscopic wood elements such as chips or veneers.<br>
Even with a correspondingly adapted material forming process, the raw<br>
material-related anisotropy is transferred to the composite. Hence,<br>
mechanical and thermal properties of the material are highly anisotropic.<br>
The present invention is based on the object of designing of further<br>
developing a method of the above-mentioned kind such that homogeneous<br>
large carbon or ceramic components can be manufactured as mass products,<br>
which exhibit largely isotropic mechanical and thermal properties. Also the<br>
methods should become more simplified. Finally, it should be possible to<br>
shape geometric structures in the components.<br>
Pursuant to the invention the problem is substantially solved for one in that a<br>
sheet-shaped molded part having a density p with p = 500 kg/m3 and a<br>
homogeneous density distribution across its sheet diagonal line with a<br>
density deviation ?p wherein ?p = 20 kg/m3 is used as the semi-finished<br>
molded piece.<br>
In particular the problem however is solved in that a sheet-shaped molded<br>
part consisting of cellulose-containing and/or lignocellulose-containing<br>
particles is used as the semi-finished molded part, wherein said particles are<br>
distributed from a statistical point of view in the molded piece such that the<br>
semi-finished molded part has isotropic or substantially isotropic properties,<br>
and in that the semi-finished molded piece is siliconized such after pyrolysis<br>
that the ceramic component is a SiSiC ceramic component with a desired<br>
free C portion with C = 0%. The board that is used is especially a low<br>
density (LDF), medium density (MDF) or high density (HDF) board,<br>
wherein the LDF board has a density pL with 400 = pL = 650 kg/m3, the<br>
MDF board has a density pM with 650 = pM = 800 kg/m3, and the HDF board<br>
has a density pn with 800 = pH = 1100 kg/m3. The idea pursuant to the<br>
invention can however also be implemented based on hard particle boards<br>
and extra hard particle boards.<br>
The special advantage of the fiber-containing, lignocellulose-containing<br>
starting materials pursuant to the invention is in their high isotropy.<br>
In particular the semi-finished molded piece consists of randomly, i.e.<br>
statistically dispersed, preferably polymer-bonded particles, which lead to<br>
isotropic properties of the molded body that is to be pyrolyzed. The particles<br>
can be fibers, but also flat particles which in turn have the same or<br>
substantially the same extensions in the plane defined by the respective<br>
particle. The molded piece is hereby produced such that it is suited for a<br>
subsequent siliconization operation such that an SiSiC ceramic component<br>
with a defined free C portion can be produced.<br>
It is preferred that a fiber board with a density of 650 = p = 1100 kg/m3 and<br>
homogeneous density distribution along the board diagonal line especially<br>
with Ap = 10 kg/m3 is used as the semi-finished molded part.<br>
Pyrolysis occurs especially in the absence of oxygen at a temperature T of<br>
400Â°C = T = 2300Â°C, especially T = 1600Â°C, wherein especially the heating<br>
speed in the temperature range between 250Â°C and 550Â°C is between 0.1<br>
K/min and 0.5 K/min, especially between 0.3 and 0.5 K/min. Gaseous and<br>
volatile compounds arising in the reaction chamber should furthermore be<br>
removed with a current of a non-oxidizing gas or inert gas such as nitrogen<br>
or argon.<br>
To produce large ceramic components made of carbon or silicone carbide<br>
especially lignocellulose-containing sheets comprising fibers, chips and/or<br>
strands should be used, wherein said sheets should have a thickness D with 1<br>
mm = D = 50 mm and/or a density p = 500 kg/m3. The thickness D should<br>
preferably be 2 mm = D = 20 mm and/or the density p = 650 kg/m3.<br>
For producing a fibreboard as the semi-finished molded part, in particular a<br>
mixture of the binder agent and fibers is molded in a hot pressing operation.<br>
Using a hot press allows the selection of a considerably shorter pressing<br>
cycle than with a cold pressing operating, resulting in economical<br>
advantages. The desired structure and the desired pattern are hereby<br>
achieved by means of the degree of compaction and the selection of various<br>
pressing phases. The compaction process can consist of several opening and<br>
closing operations with subsequent holding phases, wherein at least a<br>
specific pressing force P1, which is to be applied during the first compaction<br>
phase, should be: P1 = 5 N/mm2 . In doing so the plasticizing characteristic of<br>
wood when exposed to heat and steam is utilized. During the holding phase,<br>
the pressing operation should be maintained until the binder agent has cured.<br>
However, the pressing force can be lowered by means of control systems in<br>
accordance with the plasticization level that has been reached. This way it is<br>
ensured that bonds formed among the fibers are not destroyed. It prevents<br>
cracks in the semi-finished molded piece and excludes damaging<br>
interference in the material continuum.<br>
Accordingly produced plates are dimensionally stable and self-contained<br>
even at densities of less than 700 kg/m3. Appropriate results can be achieved<br>
not only with fibers, but also with chips or strands. If instead of fibers<br>
strands with coefficients of fineness of more than 80 are used and if during<br>
fleece formation a directional orientation is foregone, board with an express<br>
isotropy are created.<br>
For certain applications the certain level of anisotropy present in oriented<br>
strand board (OSB), parallel strand lumber (PSL), laminated strand lumber<br>
(LSL), veneered strand lumber (VSL) or uniform particle boards can be of<br>
benefit. Regardless thereof, however, the pressing operation should be<br>
conducted corresponding to that used for the production of the semi-finished<br>
molded pieces out of fiber pursuant to the invention.<br>
Apart from the question whether the board as the semi-finished molded<br>
piece, especially when present in form of a fiberboard, has a flat extension in<br>
the range of preferably between o.l m2 to 3 m2, which is sufficient in most<br>
cases, it is provided in a particularly emphasized development of the<br>
invention that machining of the board occurs prior to its pyrolysis so as to<br>
achieve a desired structure in the finished component. Machining can hereby<br>
take place in a metal-cutting or non-cutting fashion. Also, especially during<br>
the pressing operation, desired shapes can be implemented. To this end it is<br>
also feasible that the machining and/or molding operation occurs<br>
simultaneously for several boards arranged on top of each other.<br>
The machined - possibly also unmachined - boards as the semi-finished<br>
molded parts are then subjected to the pyrolysis process, wherein preferably<br>
temperatures between 400 and 2300Â°C, especially temperatures between 800<br>
and 1600Â°C in the absence of oxygen are used in order to convert the semi-<br>
finished molded parts into the carbon ceramics.<br>
The material shrinkage associated with the pyrolysis process can be taken<br>
into consideration for the design of the final dimensions already on the<br>
starting semi-finished product. Hereby it must be considered that shrinkage<br>
in the length and width amounts to about 20 to 25% and in the height to<br>
about 30 to 40%. Due to the pyrolysis process the density of the semi-<br>
finished molded piece changes as well to about 70 to 80% of the starting<br>
sheet thickness.<br>
Shrinkage rates and density changes are overall dependent on the type of the<br>
board, on the material type, the type of wood, binder agent, the binder agent<br>
content, pyrolysis conditions and the geometric dimensions.<br>
Moreover the idea pursuant to the invention provides that the pyrolysis of<br>
the board occurs such that arising volatile pyrolysis products such as water,<br>
carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons such<br>
as benzene, napthaline or alcohols, ketones, aldehydes can reach the exhaust<br>
gas without impairment. Correspondingly long pyrolysis times, which can<br>
certainly extend to several days in the temperature range between 250Â°C and<br>
550Â°C, as well as clearances between the boards are required if several<br>
boards are pyrolyzed at the same time. To simplify the degassing process,<br>
another suggestion of the invention provides that an additive is introduced<br>
into the semi-finished molded piece, which acts as a pore-forming agent<br>
when exposed to heat.<br>
After the completed pyrolysis process the sheet, which now largely consists<br>
of carbon, is cooled under an inert gas atmosphere to room temperature, to<br>
avoid spontaneous ignition of the carbon parts. The products manufactured<br>
this way generally do not require further processing so that they form the<br>
desired components. For certain filigree components, however, subsequent<br>
mechanical processing operations can also still be performed.<br>
Without leaving the idea of the invention, it is also feasible to chemically<br>
post-treat the corresponding ceramic components. This way oxidation-<br>
inhibiting layers such as silicon dioxide, silicon carbide or silicates can be<br>
applied. An infiltration of liquid or gaseous silicon is also possible, creating<br>
SiC of Si/SiC/C composites.<br>
Preferably medium density fiber boards (MDF) having a density p with 650<br>
kg/m3 = p = 800 kg/m3 and high density fiber boards (HDF) having a density<br>
p with p = 800 kg/m3 are used for forming homogeneous carbon board<br>
through pyrolysis in an inert gas flow. These fiber boards can comprise both<br>
wood fibers and plant fibers as the fiber material.<br>
Plant fibers that can be used include especially flax, hemp, sisal, miscanthus<br>
or nettle. Upon pyrolysis, densities between 600 and 700 kg/m3 are reached<br>
for MDP starting boards and 700 to 900 kg/m3 for HDF boards.<br>
The corresponding ceramic components produced through pyrolysis are<br>
dimensionally stable, self-contained and easy to handle. They can be stacked<br>
without difficulty. Mechanical post-treatment and their installation into<br>
systems are also feasible. The bending strength of corresponding carbon<br>
components is between 20 and 50 MPa and that of silicon carbide<br>
components is up to 350 MPa. The boards produced this way have a good<br>
homogeneity in the mechanical properties such as density and stability, a<br>
prerequiste for the self-contained characteristic.<br>
Boards produced with the idea of the invention can have any desired surface<br>
dimensions. Preferably surfaces of up to 3 m2 should be mentioned, however<br>
larger surfaces can be achieved as well.<br>
Carbon products manufactured pursuant to the invention can be used as<br>
linings for furnaces, in heat exchangers, as firing and sintering bases or as<br>
carrier and charging systems. Other applications are friction elements and<br>
systems, seals and lightweight assemblies. A use as substrate material and<br>
processing aids in solar technology should also be mentioned.<br>
The carbon components can be manufactured inexpensively as mass<br>
products.<br>
Moreover it shall be mentioned that it is also possible to convert the carbon<br>
components with silicone into SiC-containing composites by means of liquid<br>
phase or gaseous phase siliconization in order to use the SiC/C/Si products<br>
created this way likewise as carrier and charging systems, firing and<br>
sintering bases. A use in brakes, clutches, friction elements, filter elements,<br>
heating elements, protective shieldings and the like is also feasible.<br>
Further details, benefits and features of the invention result not only from the<br>
claims, the features revealed therein - either alone and/or in combination -<br>
but also from the following examples containing more details.<br>
Example 1<br>
A medium density fiber board (MDF) was produced by applying - in an<br>
experimental system, consisting of a boiling apparatus, blowline gluing<br>
system and a tubular dryer - a urea formaldehyde resin onto wood fibers<br>
having a length of 2 mm and residual moisture of 4%, subsequently pre-<br>
compressing them cold to a density of 150 kg/m3 and then hot-pressing them<br>
in accordance with a special pressing sequence at a temperature of 200Â°C in<br>
order to increase density and cure the binder agent. The MDF board had a<br>
density of 800 kg/m3 and a thickness of 8mm. From said MDF board a sheet<br>
section of 300 x 300 m was cut and exposed to a pyrolysis process up to<br>
1700Â°C. Pyrolysis took place in a box furnace with dry nitrogen at a flow<br>
speed of 15 1/min, wherein the volatile pyrolysis products such as methane,<br>
hydrogen, low hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide were burned in an after-<br>
burning system. Pyrolysis products that were less volatile such as higher<br>
aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons were separated in a separator filled with<br>
oil. The pyrolyis time took a total of 38 hours, wherein the heating speed in<br>
the area of maximum loss of mass was 30 Kh" .<br>
The pyrolyzed fiber board consisted of 98.8% carbon and had a density of<br>
630 kg/m3 and an open porosity of 57%. The skrinkage of the board was<br>
23.2% in the length and width and 36.5% in the height. The decrease in mass<br>
over the starting fiber board amounted to 73.5%. The carbon board obtained<br>
this way had a dimension of 230 x 230 x 5.1 mm3, had no warpage, was<br>
completely level and was self-contained. Mechanical machining (boring,<br>
cutting, milling) was good without leading to partial breakage and chipping.<br>
The stability of samples taken from the carbon board with the dimensions 10<br>
x 4.5 x 64 mm3 was 21 Â± 3 MPa, measured based on the 3-point bending<br>
method (platen 50 mm).<br>
A high density fiber board (HD) was produced analog to the way described<br>
in Example 1, wherein the temperature during hot pressing was 210Â°C. The<br>
HDF board had a density of 1000 kg/m3 and a thickness of 8 mm. From said<br>
HDF board a sheet section of 300 x 300 m was cut and exposed to a<br>
pyrolysis process up to 1700Â°C pursuant to Example 1. The pyrolyzed wood<br>
fiber board consisted of 99.1% carbon, had a density of 810 kg/m2 and an<br>
open porosity of 43%. The shrinkage of the board was 23.4% in the length<br>
and width and 35.8% in the height. The decrease in mass over the starting<br>
fiber board amounted to 70%.<br>
The carbon board obtained this way had no warpage, was level and was self-<br>
contained and easy to machine without chipping. The stability of samples<br>
taken from the carbon board with the dimensions 10 x 4.5 x 64 mm3 was 33<br>
Â± 3 MPa, measured based on the 3-point bending method (platen 50 mm).<br>
From a parallel carbon sample of the same board a silicon carbide sample<br>
was produced by conducting a liquid siliconization process with a<br>
temperature of 1600Â°C pursuant to the wick method. Said SiC sample had<br>
the same exterior dimensions as the carbon sample, had a density of 2.84<br>
kg/m3 and no open porosity. The bending strength was 268 Â± 40 MPa,<br>
measured based on the 4-point bending method. The modulus of elasticity<br>
was 270 Â± 10Gpa.<br>
Example 3<br>
An oriented strand board (OSB) was produced by processing pine wood by<br>
means of a chipper into conventional OSB strands with a dimensions of 60<br>
to 150 mm long, 15 to 30 mm wide and 0.4 to 1 mm thick, the strands were<br>
glued with a polyphenyl methane diisocyanate resin, then cold pre-<br>
compressed and subsequently compressed at 200Â°C. The density of the OSB<br>
board was 650 kg/m3. The thickness of the board was 18 mm. From said<br>
OSB board a sheet section of 300 x 300 m2 was cut and exposed to a<br>
