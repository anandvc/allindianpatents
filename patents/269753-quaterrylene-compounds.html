m	is 1 or 2;<br>

and mixtures thereof.<br>
The invention further relates to the preparation of the rylene derivatives I and to their use for coloring high molecular weight organic and inorganic materials, for producing aqueous polymer dispersions which absorb in the near infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum, for obtaining markings and inscriptions which absorb infrared light and are invisible to the human eye, as infrared absorbers for heat management, as IR laser beam-absorbing materials in the fusion treatment of plastics parts, as semiconductors in organic electronics, as emitters in electro- and chemiluminescence applications, and also as active components in photovoltaics.<br>
Compounds which absorb in the near infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum are of increasing interest for a multitude of applications. One class of such organic compounds is that of polycyclic conjugated aromatic ring systems based on rylene.<br>
Molecules known to date on the basis of the higher rylenes of particular interest are unsubstituted and tetra- and hexa-halo-substituted and tetra- and hexa-aroxy-substituted quatenylenetetracarboximides (EP-A-596 292 or WO-A-96/22332 and WO-A-02/76988), unsubstituted and peri-halogenated terrylene and quaterrylenedicarboximides (WO-A-02/66438). and also unsubstituted and tetra-halo-and -aroxy-substituted terrylenetetracarboximides (WO-A-03/104232).<br>
It was an object of the invention to provide further compounds which absorb in the wavelength range from 550 to 900 nm and feature advantageous performance properties, and are in particular functionalized such that they are adapted in a controlled manner to the desired end use or else can be converted to compounds absorbing at even longer wavelengths.<br><br>
Accordingly, the terrylene and quaterrylene derivatives of the fornnula I defined at the outset have been found.<br>
Preferred definitions of the variables occurring in formula I can be taken from the<br>
subclaims.<br>
The terrylene derivatives I may have from 3 to 6 substituents R; they are preferably tetrasubstituted by substituents in the 1.6,9.14 arrangement.<br>
The quaterrylene derivatives I may bear from 3 to 8 substituents R; they are preferably tetrasubstituted in the 1,6,11,16 arrangement or hexasubstituted in the 1,6,8,11,16,18 or 1,6,8,11,16,19 arrangement.<br>
In general, both the terrylene derivatives and the quaterrylene derivatives I are obtained in the form of mixtures of products with different degrees of substitution, in which the tetrasubstituted product, or else the hexasubstituted product for the quaterrylene derivatives, makes up the majority in each case.<br>

The inventive rylene derivatives I and the processes for their preparation which are likewise in accordance with the invention will be detailed individually hereinbelow.<br>
The variables occurring in the formulae used here, unless stated otherwise, are each as defined at the outset.<br>
In these formulae and also in the claims, the carboxylic acid functions are always shown in anhydride form and also referred to as anhydride. However, the free carboxylic acids or salts thereof are likewise obtainable by the procedures described or are obtained as intermediates and merely have to be isolated.<br>
The rylenetetracarboxylic monoimide monoanhydrides la<br><br><br><br>
can be prepared advantageously in accordance with the invention by subjecting a rylenetetracarboximide II<br><br>
to a hydrolysis under alkaline conditions in the presence of a polar organic solvent and isolating the rylenetetracarboxylic monoimide monoanhydride la and the rylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride lb, preferably by column chromatography, and separating them from one another.<br>
It is advantageous in this procedure (variant a) of the particular individual process) that it also starts from symmetrical rylenetetracarboximides II for the preparation of the rylenetetracarboxylic monoimide monoanhydrides, and makes superfluous the complicated synthesis of the unsymmetrical rylenetetracarboximides II which are otherwise required.<br>
Suitable reaction media for the hydrolysis are polar, in particular protic, organic solvents. Particularly suitable are aliphatic alcohols which have from 3 to 8 carbon atoms and may be unbranched, but are preferably branched. Examples include, in addition to n-propanol and n-butanol, in particular isopropanol, sec- and tert-butanol and 2-methyl-2-butanol.<br>
It will be appreciated that it is also possible to use mixtures of solvents.<br>
In general, from 5 to 500 ml, preferably from 20 to 100 ml, of solvent are used per g of<br>
11.<br><br>
Suitable bases are alkali metal and alkaline earth metal bases, preference being given to the alkali metal bases and particular preference to the sodium and potassium bases. The bases used are both inorganic bases, in particular the hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, and organic bases, in particular the alkoxides such as sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide, potassium isopropoxide and potassium tert-butoxide, which are typically used in anhydrous form. Very particular preference is given to potassium hydroxide.<br>
It will be appreciated that it is also possible to use mixtures of bases.<br>
In general, from 10 to 200 mol, preferably from 30 to 70 mol, of base are required per mole of il.<br>
Especially in the case of hydrolysis of terrylenetetracarboximides II, it has been found to be advantageous additionally to use a metal fluoride, in particular an alkali metal fluonde, for example potassium fluoride, sodium fluoride or lithium fluoride, as an assistant.<br>
Suitable amounts of assistant are generally from 0.1 to 4 mol, in particular from 0.5 to 1.5 mol, per mole of base.<br>
The reaction temperature is generally from 50 to 120'C, preferably from 60 to lOCC.<br>
Typical reaction times are from 0.5 to 24 h, in particular from 2 to 10 h.<br>
In terms of process technology, the procedure is appropriately as follows:<br>
A mixture of base, if appropriate assistant and solvent is heated to the reaction temperature with vigorous stirring and then the rylenetetracarboximide II is added. After the desired reaction time, an acid, for example an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid or preferably an organic acid such as acetic acid, is added dropwise until a pH of from about 1 to 4 has been attained, and the mixture is stirred at the reaction temperature for a further 1 to 4 h. The reaction product precipitated by dilution with water after cooling to room temperature is filtered off, washed with hot water and dried at about lOO1'C under reduced pressure.<br>
When the corresponding carboxylic acid salt is to be isolated instead of the particular anhydride, the procedure is appropriately not to acidify the reaction mixture after the hydrolysis, but instead only to cool it to room temperature, filter off the precipitated product, wash with a lower aliphatic alcohol such as isopropanol, and dry at about 100°C under reduced pressure.<br><br>
Rylenetetracarboxylic monoimide monoanhydride la and rylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride lb may be isolated by column chromatography on silica gel with toluene or chloroform as the eluent and purified, i.e. separated from one another and from unhydrolyzed reactant 11.<br>
The yield for the mixture of rylenetetracarboxylic monoimide monoanhydride la and rylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride lb is typically from 70 to 90%.<br>
Selection of suitable reaction conditions allows the reaction, if desired, also to be steered in the direction of single or of double hydrolysis (respective process variants<br>
b)).<br>
Thus, the single hydrolysis is promoted by milder reaction conditions such as smaller amounts of base, lower reaction temperatures and shorter reaction times, while, in the case of more severe reaction conditions such as larger amounts of base, addition of assistant, higher reaction temperatures and longer reaction times, double hydrolysis predominates.<br>
Rylenetetracarboxylic monoimide monoanhydride la and rylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride lb may be obtained in this way generally in yields of from 30 to 70% (for la) or from 50 to 90% (for lb).<br>
In the inventive preparation of the rylenedicarboximides Ic<br><br><br><br>
the mixture, obtained in the hydrolysis of the rylenetetracarboximide II, of rylene-tetracarboxylic monoimide monoanhydride la and rylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride lb, which typically also comprises unhydrolyzed rylenetetracarboximide II, is used and is subjected to a decarboxylation in the presence of a tertiary nitrogen-basic compound as a solvent and of a transition metal catalyst (respective process variants a)). The rylenedicarboximides Ic and rylenes Id formed here may be separated from one another readily by column chromatography.<br>
It will be appreciated that the rylenedicarboximides Ic and the rylenes Id may also be prepared in accordance with process variants b) from the rylenetetracarboxylic monoimide monoanhydride la or rylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride lb isolated in each case.<br>
Suitable reaction media for the decarboxylation are tertiary nitrogen-basic compounds whose boiling point is preferably above the reaction temperature. Examples of particularly suitable solvents are N,N-disubstituted aliphatic carboxamides (in particular N,N-di-Ci-C4-alkyl-CrC4-carboxamides) and nitrogen heterocycles.<br>
Specific examples include: dimethylformamide, diethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, dimethylbutyramide, N-methylpyrrolidone, 3-methylpyridine, quinoline, isoquinoline and quinaldine, preference being given to quinoline.<br>
It will be appreciated that it is also possible to use solvent mixtures.<br>
In general, from 5 to 200 ml, in particular from 10 to 70 ml, of solvent are used per g of reactant to be decarboxylated.<br>
Suitable catalysts are in particular the transition metals copper and zinc and their compounds, in particular their oxides and their inorganic and organic salts which are used preferably in anhydrous form.<br><br>
Examples of preferred catalysts are copper, copper(l) oxide, copper(ll) oxide, copper(l) chloride, copper(ll) acetate, zinc acetate and zinc propionate, particular preference being given to copper(l) oxide and zinc acetate.<br>
It will be appreciated that it is also possible to use mixtures of the catalysts mentioned.<br>
In general, from 0.5 to 2 mol, preferably from 0.9 to 1.2 mol, of catalyst is used per mole of reactant to be decarboxylated.<br>
The reaction temperature is typically from 100 to 250°C, preferably from 160 to 220°C.<br>
It is recommended to work under protective gas, for example nitrogen or argon.<br>
The decarboxylation is complete generally within from 0.5 to 24 h, in particular from 1 to5h.<br>
In process technology terms, the procedure is appropriately as follows:<br>
A mixture of reactant to be decarboxylated, solvent and catalyst is heated with stirring under protective gas to the desired reaction temperature. After the desired reaction time and cooling to room temperature, the reaction product is precipitated in an aqueous acid, in particular dilute hydrochloric acid, and the mixture is stirred if desired at 60°C for about 1 h. The reaction product is filtered off, washed with hot water and dried at about 100°C under reduced pressure.<br>
Rylenedicarboximide Ic and rylene Id may be isolated by column chromatography on silica gel with toluene as the eluent and purified, i.e. separated from one another and from unconverted reactant.<br>
The yield for the mixture of rylenedicarboximide Ic and rylene Id is, starting from the rylenetetracarboximide II, typically from 65 to 85%.<br>
It is also possible in the preparation of the peri-halogenated rylenedicarboximides le<br><br><br>
(Hal: halogen, preferably chlorine, bromine or iodine, more preferably chlorine or bromine, most preferably bromine)<br>
and of the halogenated rylenes If<br><br>
(Hat: halogen, preferably chlorine, bromine or iodine, more preferably chlorine or bromine, most preferably bromine; Z1Z1: hydrogen, or one of the Z1or Z1 radicals is halogen, preferably chlorine, bromine or iodine, more preferably chlorine or bromine, most preferably bromine, and the other radical is hydrogen),<br>
in accordance with the inventive process variant b), advantageously to use the mixture, obtained in the above-described decarboxylation, of rylenedicarboximide Ic and rylene Id, which typically also comprises unhydrolyzed rylenetetracarboximide II, which is in turn based on the mixture, obtained in the hydrolysis of the rylenetetracarboximide li, of rylenetetracarboxylic monoimide monoanhydride la and rylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride lb. The resulting halogenated rylene derivatives le and If can be separated easily by column chromatography.<br>
It will be appreciated that the halogenated rylene derivatives le and If may also be prepared by haiogenating the isolated individual compounds Ic and Id (process variants a)).<br>
The inventive halogenation is undertaken with N-halosuccinimide in the presence of a polar organic solvent and of a Lewis acid as a catalyst.<br>
This procedure can be employed in order to prepare the chlorinated, brominated or iodinated rylene derivatives le and If, preference being given to the chlorinated products and particular preference to the brominated products.<br>
The rylenedicarboximides Ic are monohalogenated regioselectively in the peri-position; the rylene derivatives Id may be mono- and dihalogenated.<br><br>
In the dihaiogenation of the rylene derivatives Id, the possibility exists, both in process variant a) and in process variant b) of undertaking the halogenation in one step with addition of the total amount of N-halosuccinimide required (process variants a1) and b1)).<br>
However, a stepwise halogenation in accordance with process variants a2) and b2) may be preferable, in which the monohalogenated rylene If (Z1=Z1=H) is prepared in a first step and, preferably after intermediate isolation of the monohaloryiene, the dihalogenated rylene If (Z1or Z1=halogen) is prepared in a second step. The two-stage procedure additionally enables, by use of different N-halosuccinimides, the controlled preparation of mixed-halogenated rylenes If which are substituted on one side of the molecule (in the 3 position) by one halogen and on the other side of the molecule (correspondingly in the 11- or 12-position in terrylene and in the 13- or 14-position in quaterrylene) by the other halogen. In general, the dihaiogenation always affords mixtures of the 3,11- and 3,12-dihaloterrylenes or the 3,13- and 3,14-dihaloquatenylenes.<br>
Suitable polar organic solvents for the halogenation are in particular aprotic solvents. Preferred examples of these solvents are the aforementioned aliphatic carboxamides such as dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide, and halogenated hydrocarbons such as chloroform and methylene chloride. Particular preference is given to dimethylformamide.<br>
In general, from 25 to 200 ml, preferably from 50 to 150 ml, of solvent are used per g of reactantto be halogenated.<br>
Suitable Lewis acid catalysts are in particular metal halides, preference being given to iron(lll) halides. aluminum trihalides and zinc halides. Specific examples include iron(lll) chloride. iron(III) bromide, iron(lll) iodide, aluminum trichloride, aluminum tribromide, aluminum triiodide and zinc chloride, particular preference being given to the iron halides.<br>
In general, from 0.01 to 0.5 mol, preferably from 0.05 to 0.2 mol, of Lewis acid is used per mole of reactant to be halogenated.<br>
The amount of N-halosuccinimide depends upon the degree of halogenation desired. Typically, from 1 to 6 mol, in particular from 1 to 4 mol. of N-halosuccinimide are required per halogen atom to be introduced. When mixtures of rylenedicarboximide Ic and rylene Id are used, it has to be taken into account that both reactants are to be halogenated. When the dihalorylenes If are to be prepared stepwise, appropriately from 1 to 3 mol of N-halosuccinimide are used in the first step per mole of rylene id or per mole of rylene Id and rylenedicarboximide Ic when a reactant mixture is used, and<br><br>
generally a further from 1 to 6 mol, in particular from 1 to 4 mol, are used in the second step per mole of monohalogenated rylene If.<br>
The halogenation temperature is generally from 20 to 100°C, preferably from 40 to<br>
80°C.<br>
It is recommended to work under protective gas, for example nitrogen or argon.<br>
Typical reaction times are from 0.5 to 24 h, in particular from 1 to 2 h.<br>
A convenient procedure is as follows:<br>
A mixture of reactant to be halogenated, Lewis acid, N-halosuccinimide and solvent is heated to the desired reaction temperature with stirring under protective gas. After halogenation has ended and cooling to room temperature, the reaction product is precipitated with dilute inorganic acid, for example with dilute hydrochloric acid. The reaction product is filtered off, washed with hot water and dried at about 100°C under reduced pressure.<br>
The haiogenated rylenedicarboximide le and rylene If may be isolated by column chromatography on silica gel with toluene as the eluent and purified, i.e. separated from one another and from unconverted reactant.<br>
In the case of two-stage preparation of dihalorylenes If, the monohalorylene If isolated in this way may be subjected to a further halogenation as described above.<br>
The yields for the peri-halogenated rylenedicarboximide le and the haiogenated rylene If are, starting from the rylenetetracarboximide II, typically in each case from 25 to 40%.<br>
The unhalogenated or peri-halogenated rylenedicarboxylic anhydrides Igh<br><br><br>
(Z: hydrogen or halogen, preferred halogen being chlorine, bromine or iodine and particularly preferred halogen being chlorine or bromine and very particularly preferred halogen being bromine)<br>
are obtainable in accordance with the invention by hydrolyzing unhalogenated or peri-halogenated rylenedicarboximides of the general formula Ice<br><br>
The hydrolysis may be undertaken analogously to the above-described hydrolysis of the rylenetetracarboximides II under alkaline conditions in the presence of a polar organic solvent.<br>
Here too, especially in the case of hydrolysis of the terrylenedicarboximides Ice, the presence of a fluoride is recommended, in particular of potassium fluoride, which is used generally in amounts of from 0.1 to 2 equivalents, preferably from 0.7 to 1.3 equivalents, based on the base.<br>
The further reaction conditions and also the process procedure correspond to the above-described hydrolysis process.<br>
The rylenedicarboxylic acid salts or the free acid may, as described for the hydrolysis of the rylenetetracarboximide II, be isolated or prepared.<br>
If desired, the rylenedicarboxylic anhydride Igh may be subjected to a purification by column chromatography with chloroform as the eluent, but this will generally not be required.<br>
The yield is typically from 70 to 90% based on the rylenedicarboximide Ice used.<br>
It will be appreciated that the peri-halogenated rylenedicarboxylic anhydrides Ih<br><br><br>
(Hal: halogen, preferably chlorine, bromine or iodine, more preferably chlorine or bromine, most preferably bromine)<br>
may also be prepared in accordance with the invention by halogenating the corresponding rylenedicarboxylic anhydride Ig<br><br>
The halogenation may advantageously be undertaken with N-halosuccinimide in the presence of a polar organic solvent and of a Lewis acid as a catalyst analogously to the above-described halogenation of the rylenedicarboximides Ic and of the rylenes Id.<br>
The peri-(dioxaborolan-2-yl)rylenedicarboximides li<br><br>
and the peri-(dioxaborolan-2-yl)rylenedicarboxylic anhydrides Ik<br><br><br>
are obtainable in accordance with the invention by reacting the corresponding peri-halogenated rylenedicarboximide le<br><br>
(Hal: halogen, preferably chlorine, bromine or iodine, more preferably chlorine or bromine, most preferably bromine)<br>
or the peri-halogenated rylenedicarboxylic anhydride Ih<br><br>
(Hal: halogen, especially preferably chlorine, bromine or iodine, more preferably chlorine or bromine, most preferably bromine)<br>
with a diborane of the general formula III<br><br><br>
in the presence of an aprotic organic solvent, of a transition metal catalyst and of a base.<br>
The (dioxaborolan-2-yl)-substituted rylenes Ij<br><br>
may be prepared analogously in accordance with the invention from the halorylenes If<br><br>
To prepare the mono(dioxaborolan-2-yl)rylenes Ij (D"'=D1=H), monohalorylenes If (Z1=Z1=H) are used.<br>
Bis(dioxaborolan-2-yI)rylenes Ij (D1 or D1=(d) radical)<br><br>
)     are obtainable correspondingly from the dihalorylenes If (Z1 or Z1=halogen).<br>
Finally, exchange of only one of the halogen atoms present in the dihalorylene If also makes it possible to obtain mixed-substituted rylenes Ij (D' or D1=halogen).<br><br>
Since the dihaloryienes If are generally the above-described isomer mixtures, the (dioxaboroian-2-yl)-substituted rylenes Ij prepared from them are also obtained as isomer mixtures.<br>
In general, a (dioxaborolan-2-yi) radical is introduced into the rylene derivative ie, Ih and/or If by using from 1 to 3 mol, preferably from 1 to 2 mol, of dibcrane III per mole of rylene derivative.<br>
When only one of the halogen atoms present in the dihalorylenes If is to be replaced by a (dioxaborolan-2-yl) radical, it is recommended to slightly lower the amount of diborane III and to use from about 1 to 1.5 mol of diborane III per mole of rylene derivative If in order to prevent double substitution.<br>
To prepare the bis(dioxaborolan-2-yl)rylenes Ij, typically double the amount of diborane III is accordingly required.<br>
Suitable diboranes III are in particular bis(1,2- and 1,3-diolato)diboranes, tetraalkoxy-diboranes, tetracycloalkoxydiboranes, tetraaryloxydiboranes and tetrahetaryloxydiboranes and also their mixed forms.

Preference is given to diboranes III In which the two R" radicals disposed on a boron atom are joined together with formation of a five- or six-membered ring comprising the two oxygen atoms and also the boron atom. It is possible for aromatic or saturated, even bicyclic, rings having from 5 to 7 carbon atoms to be fused to the five-membered rings formed as ring members. All rings or ring systems may be substituted by up to 4 C1-C30-alkyl. C3-C8-cycloalkyl, aryl and/or hetaryl radicals; they are preferably substituted by up to 4 C1-C4-alkyl radicals. Examples of these preferred diboranes are the bis(1,2- and 1,3-diolato)diboranes already mentioned above, particular preference being given to bis(pinacolato)diborane.<br>
Suitable solvents for this reaction are in principle all aprotic solvents which are stable toward bases under the reaction conditions and have a boiling point above the selected reaction temperature, in which the halogenated reactants Ie. If and/or Ih dissolve fully at reaction temperature and the catalysts and bases used at least partially, so that substantially homogeneous reaction conditions are present. It is possible to use either nonpolar-aprotic or polar-aprotic solvents, preference being given to the nonpolar-aprotic solvents.<br><br>
Examples of preferred nonpolar-aprotic solvents are solvents which boil at &gt;100°C from the following groups: aliphatics (especially C8-C18-aikanes), unsubstituted, alkyl-substituted and fused cycloaliphatics (especially unsubstituted C7-C10-cycloalkanes, C6-C8-cycloalkanes which are substituted by from one to three C1-C6-alky! groups, polycyclic saturated hydrocarbons having from 10 to 18 carbon atoms), alkyl- and cycloalkyl-substituted aromatics (especially benzene which is substituted by from one to three C7-C6-alkyl groups or one C3-C8-cycloalkyI radical) and fused aromatics which may be alkyl-substituted and/or partly hydrogenated (especially naphthalene which is substituted by from one to four C1-C6-alkyi groups) and also mixtures of these solvents.<br>
Examples of particularly preferred solvents include: octane, isooctane. nonane, isononane, decane, isodecane, undecane. dodecane, hexadecane and octadecane; cycloheptane, cyclooctane, methylcyclohexane, dimethylcyclohexane. trimethylcyclohexane, ethyicyclohexane, diethylcyclohexane. propylcyclohexane. isopropylcyclohexane, dipropylcyclohexane, butylcyclohexane, tert-butylcyclohexane, methylcycloheptane and methylcyclooctane; toluene, o-, m- and p-xylene, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene), 1.2,4-and 1,2,3-trimethylben2ene, ethylbenzene, propylbenzene, isopropylbenzene, butylbenzene, isobutylbenzene, tert-butylbenzene and cyclohexylbenzene; naphthalene, decahydronaphthalene (decalin), 1-and 2-methylnaphthalene and 1- and 2-ethylnaphthalene; combinations of the aforementioned solvents, as may be obtained from the high-boiling, partly or fully hydrogenated fractions of thermal and catalytic cracking processes in crude oil or naphtha processing, for example mixtures of the Exxsol® type and alkylbenzene mixtures of the Solvesso® type.<br>
Very particularly preferred solvents are xylene (all isomers), mesitylene and in particular toluene.<br>
Examples of suitable polar-aprotic solvents are N,N-disubstituted aliphatic carboxamides (especially N,N-di"CrC4-alkyl-C1-C4-carboxamides) and nitrogen heterocycles which have already been listed above, and also aprotic ethers (especially cyclic ethers, diaryl ethers and di-C1-C6-alkyI ethers of monomeric and oligomeric C2-C3-alkylene glycols which may comprise up to 6 alkylene oxide units, in particular diethylene glycol di-C1-C4-alkyl ethers), such as:<br>
tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, diphenyl ether, the dimethyl, diethyl, dipropyl. diisopropyl, din-butyl, di-sec-butyl and di-tert-butyl ethers of diethylene glycol, diethylene glycol methyl ethyl ether, the dimethyl and diethyl ethers of triethylene glycol, and triethylene glycol methyl ethyl ether.<br><br>
In the case of the rylenes Id, particular preference is given to the polar-aprotic solvents, in particular dioxane and dimethylformamide; for the other reactants to be halogenated, particular preference is given to the nonpolar-aprotic solvents, in particular toluene.<br>
The amount of solvent is generally from 10 to 1000 ml, preferably from 20 to 300 mL per g of halogenated reactant.<br>
Suitable transition metal catalysts are in particular palladium complexes such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), tetrakis(tris-o-tolylphosphine)palladium(0), [1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane]palladium(ll) chloride.

Typically, the transition metal catalyst is used in an amount of from 1 to 20 mol%, in particular from 2 to 10 mol%, based on the halogenated reactant.<br>
The bases used are preferably the alkali metal salts, especially the sodium salts and in particular the potassium salts, of weakly organic and inorganic acids, such as sodium acetate, potassium acetate, sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogencarbonate, potassium carbonate and potassium hydrogencarbonate. Preferred bases are the acetates, in particular potassium acetate.<br>
In general, from 1 to 5 mol, preferably from 2 to 4 mol, of base are used per mole of halogenated reactant.<br>
The reaction temperature is typically from 20 to 1800C in particular from 60 to 1200C<br>
It is recommended to work under protective gas, for example nitrogen or argon.<br>
The reaction time is generally from 0.5 to 30 h, in particular from 1 to 20 h.<br>
In process technology terms, the procedure is appropriately as follows:<br>
halogenated reactant and solvent are initially charged, diborane III, the transition metal catalyst and the base are added successively and the mixture is heated to the desired reaction temperature under protective gas for from 0.5 to 30 h. After cooling to room<br><br>
temperature, the solid constituents are filtered off from the reaction mixture and the solvent is distilled off under reduced pressure.<br>
The rylene derivative Ik is not obtained here in anhydride form, but rather is generally present in the form of the rylenedicarboxyiic acid salt. The anhydride itself may be obtained in a simple manner by adding an acid. In this way, a dioxaborolan-2-yl radical present as the ester (R" 1 H) is hydrolyzed to the boronic acid (R" = H):<br>
if desired, the (dioxaborolan-2-yl)-substituted rylene derivatives li, Ij and Ik may be subjected to a purification by column chromatography with a 2:1 mixture of chloroform and hexane as the eluent, but this will generally not be required.<br>
The yield is typically from 80 to 100%.<br>
The rylene derivatives I having anhydride functions (or acid functions) may be condensed with aromatic diamines IV.<br>
The double condensation products obtainable starting from the rylenetetracarboxylic dianhydrides lb are generally obtained in the form of mixtures of the cis isomer Imcis and of the trans isomer Imtrans<br><br>
By stepwise reaction with two different diamines IV and 1V\ it is also possible to obtain the corresponding unsymmetrical condensation products ImCISand ImTRANS<br><br><br>
However, it is also possible to subject the rylenetetracarboxylic dianhydrides lb only to a single condensation reaction with the aromatic diamine !V, by which it is possible to obtain the rylenetetracarboxylic acid derivatives In<br><br><br>
can be prepared by corresponding reaction of the rylenetetracarboxyiic monoimide monoanhydrides la.<br>
Finally, the rylenedicarboxylic acid derivatives Ip<br><br>
nnay be prepared by condensing the rylenedicarboxylic anhydrides Ig with the aromatic diamines IV.<br>
The condensation of the rylene derivatives 1 having anhydride functions with the aromatic diamines IV is carried out in accordance with the invention in the presence of a nitrogen-basic compound or of phenol as a solvent and of a Lewis acid or of piperazine as a catalyst.<br>
To prepare the monocondensation products, typically from 1 to 1.5 mol, preferably from 1.05 to 1.2 mol, of aromatic diamine IV are used per mole of anhydride reactant. To prepare the symmetrical dicondensation products Im, accordingly, generally from 2 to 3 mol, especially from 2.1 to 2.4 mol, of diamine IV are used.<br>
When the unsymmetrical dicondensation products Im' are to be prepared, it is recommended to react the rylenetetracarboxylic'dianhydrides lb first with only from 1 to 1.5 mol, in particular from 1 to 1.2 mol, of the diamine IV and then with from 1 to 1.5 mol, especially from 1 to 1,2 mol, of the diamine 1VSuitable aromatic diamines IV are o-phenylenediamine, 1,8-diaminonaphthalene and 3,4-diaminopyridine. The diamines may be substituted by Ci"Ci2"alkyl, C1-C6-alkoxy, hydroxyl, nitro and/or halogen, but are preferably unsubstituted. Prefen-ed diamines IV are o-phenylenediamine and 1,8-diaminonaphthaIene,<br>
Suitable nitrogen-basic compounds are in particular nitrogen heterocycles which are preferably not further functionalized, such as quinoline, isoquinoline, quinaldine, pyrimidine, N-methylpiperidine, pyridine, pyrrole, pyrazole, triazole, tetrazole, imidazole<br><br>
and methylimidazole. Preference is given to tertiary nitrogen-basic compounds, in<br>
particular quinoline.<br>
In general, from 5 to 200 ml, preferably from 10 to 50 ml, of solvent are used per g of rylene derivative.<br>
Suitable catalysts are Lewis acids, for example zinc compounds, in particular zinc salts such as zinc acetate and zinc chloride, and zinc oxide, inorganic and organic acids such as hydrochloric acid, acetic acid and p-toluenesulfonic acid, preference being given to zinc acetate.<br>
Likewise suitable as a catalyst is piperazine which is preferably used in combination with phenol as a solvent.<br>
Typically, from 0.25 to 5.0 mol, in particular from 1.0 to 2.0 mol, of catalyst are used per anhydride group to be converted.<br>

240X.<br>
It is recommended to work under protective gas, for example nitrogen or argon.<br>
In general, the condensation has ended within from 0.5 to 24 h, in particular from 2 to<br>
6h.<br>
In process technology terms, the procedure is appropriately as follows:<br>
A mixture of anhydride reactant, catalyst, diamine and solvent is heated to the desired reaction temperature with stinging under protective gas. After the end of condensation and cooling to room temperature, the reaction product is precipitated with dilute hydrochloric acid, filtered off, washed with hot water and dried at about 100°C under reduced pressure.<br>
If desired, the resulting condensation products may be subjected to purification by column chromatography with chloroform as the eluent, but this will generally not be required.<br>
The yield is typically from 90 to 95%.<br>
The rylenedicarboxylic acid derivatives Ip<br><br><br>

v1'ith N-halosuccinimide in the presence of a polar organic solvent and of a Lewis acid as a catalyst.<br>
In this case, it is possible to proceed analogously to the halogenation described above for the rylenedicarboximides ic, rylenedicarboxylic anhydrides Ig and rylenes Id. The arylene or hetarylene radical may also be halogenated fronn one to four times.<br>
It is also possible to obtain the peri"(dioxaborolan-2-yl)rylenedicarboxylic acid derivatives Ir<br><br>
in accordance with the invention by reacting the peri-halogenated rylenedicarboxylic acid derivatives Iq<br><br><br>
in the presence of an aprotic organic solvent, of a transition metal catalyst and of a<br>
base.<br>
The procedure is advantageously analogous to the above-described reaction of the peri-halogenated rylenedicarboximides ie, of the peri-haiogenated rylenedicarboxylic anhydrides Ih and of the halorylenes If with the diborane III.<br>
The inventive rylene derivatives I exhibit strong absorption in the infrared region at wavelengths of from 550 to 900 nm. Their functionaiization can be selected such that they can be adapted directly to the desired end use.<br>
They are suitable for a multitude of applications, such as the coloring of high molecular weight organic and inorganic materials, for example of coatings, printing inks and plastics, for producing aqueous polymer dispersions which absorb in the near infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum, for obtaining markings and Inscriptions which absorb infrared light and are invisible to the human eye, as infrared absorbers for heat management, as IR laser beam-absorbing materials in the fusion treatment of plastics parts, as semiconductors in organic electronics, as emitters in electro- and chemiluminescence applications, and also as active components in photovoltaics.<br>
They may also be used advantageously as reactants for preparing higher rylenes which absorbs at longer wavelength.<br>
