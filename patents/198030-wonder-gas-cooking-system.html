				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a cooking system using hexane liquid as fuel.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Traditionally and conventionally, wood is used to be the only means fuel for cooking.<br>
It is well known that due to constant use of wood as fuel, crores of trees have been destroyed causing ill health to the rural women folks due to the intake of fumes and carbon-di-oxide emanating from the burning wood apart from deforestation.<br>
Another alternative of fuel is Liquidified Petroleum Gas (LPG) which is the most common cooking gas fuel widely and extensively used both at home and in hotels in urban centres all over India. LPG is also used by housewives as an altemative to kerosene which is again an expensive and unsafe cooking fuel.<br>
Safety angles provided in the present LPG fuel system is fraught with dangers to life and property caused by means of explosion due to any oversight or slippage at any stage from Naphtha and Natural Gas condensate.<br>
The object of the present invention is to overcome the afore-mentioned disadvantages.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to develop a cooking system keeping in mind the twin objective of helping the poor rural illiterate population and also safe guarding the environment by discouraging use of wood as a cooking fuel.<br>
The object of this invention is to develop a cooking system which uses cheap fuel that can easily be stored like kerosene is easily available in rural areas and economical. This cooking system having maximum thermal efficiency is safe to be used by illiterate population.<br><br>
To achieve the said objective the present invention provides a cooking<br>
system using hexane liquid as fuel comprising of-<br>
a fuel tank for storing said liquid fuel, a stove consisting of at least one burner, a connecting means for connecting regulator to the stove through an outlet characterized by an electronic regulator having a micro motor for operating the pump to create various pressures to suit the ambient temperatures and flow of fuel, a diaphragm pump to create the required pressure for forming the flammable mixture of Hexane vapor and air, an electronic circuit to control the operations of micro motor and recharging the enclosed rechargeable battery, a rechargeable battery to back up the regulator operation in case of non availability of power supply<br>
Said converter comprises a diaphragm air pump, micro motor, a charging plate and if desired a rechargeable battery<br>
Said stove comprises of a frame having a housing for at least one burner holder having a burner, nozzle means to which one end of the second connecting means is connected.<br>
Said liquid fuel is hexane. The nozzle is suitably designed to use hexane gas a cooking fuel. The nozzle of the Big Burner is designed to allow hexane gas through 2mm hole and for reducing the flame through a 1 mm hole. The small burner is designed to allow hexane gas through 2mm hole and for reducing the flame through a 1.5mm hole. The nozzle is designed to give maximum thermal efficiency. The fuel tank is made of mild steel sheet of 2mm thickness and is provided with an inlet to refill hexane liquid.<br>
The air inlet sends air into said fiiel tank and said outlet sends the Hexane-Air-Gas to the stove. The said connecting means between the cylinder and stove comprises of non- return valve. The said air pump is designed so as to pump only necessary volume of air to convert Hexane liquid into Hexane gas so as to create a pressure of 0.03 PSl in the fuel tank. Said second connecting means is provided with a non-return valve for allowing hexane gas from the fiiel tank to the stove but stops any back pressure from the stove to the fuel tank. A non- return safety valve is provided between the tank and converter.<br><br>
This invention further relates to a process of converting stable liquid hexane fuel to hexane gas by using the specially designed power operated converter comprising micromotor, air pump, transformer, standby battery and a circuit, by pressurising the fuel from specially designed fuel tank and sending the gas under nominal pressure to suitably designed burners of the stove.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The hquid Hexane, a petrochemical is available in abundance. The said Hexane is manufactured through distillation process from Naptha and Natural Gas condensate. Hexane is a colorless and odorless liquid and therefore colour as well as odor is added to Hexane for identification purpose.<br><br><br>
8)	Flash Point- 22" Centigrade<br>
9)	Stable at room temperatures in closed containers at under normal storage and handling conditions<br>
The cooking fuel used in the instant cooking system has all the qualities of Liquid petroleum gas with exception of little or no danger at all to life and property even at the remotest chance.<br>
The capacity of the fuel tank is 10 liters of water and 7.5 liters of gas Fuel capacity.<br>
A fuel tank/ cylinder is developed to store and use Hexane liquid as a cooking fuel. The design of the fuel Tank is developed to utilize Hexane liquid with optimum efficiency. The base of the said fuel tank/cylinder is broad so as to have maximum liquid surface area, which increases the vaporization process.<br>
The said fuel tank/ cylinder is made of mild steel sheet of 2mm thickness. The fuel tank/cylinder is provided with inlets to refill Hexane liquid, an air inlet to send the air into fuel Tank and an outlet to send the Hexane- Air-Gas to the stove. There is no regulator in the fuel tank.<br>
The fuel tank/ cylinder has the capacity of 10 Its water and 7 Its Hexane liquid. The said fuel tank shall withstand up to maximum pressure of 15 kgs/cm<br>
A stove made up of stainless steel frame is connected through pipe to the fuel tank having a big and a small burner, two burner holders, two sets of nozzles, two gas controlling plates, two vessels stands and nuts and bolts.<br>
Though the stove is similar to the traditional LPG stove, it is a quite different cooking stove. It is not possible to use LPG as a fuel in this Stove. The nozzle of the Stove is suitably devised to use Hexane Gas as the cooking fuel. The Burners and nozzles are designed to give maximum thermal efficiency using Hexane gas as the cooking fiiel. The nozzles are designed to give normal high flame and also to reduce the flame with slim option. The nozzles are designed as follows:<br>
The Big Burner is made of Brass and at normal flame the nozzle allows Hexane gas through 2mm hole and for reduced i.e. slim flame is through a<br><br>
1mm hole whereas the small burner is also made of Brass and at normal flame to nozzle allows Hexane gas through 1.5mm hole and for reduced i.e. slim flame is through a 0.75mm hole.<br>
Regulator/Converter<br>
Regulator/Converter is the main part of the cooking Gas System. This works both as a Regulator and Converter. This works as a Converter by sending air into the Fuel Tank so as to convert Hexane liquid into Hexane Gas and works as a Regulator to send the Hexane Gas from the Fuel Tank to the Stove.<br>
The Regulator/Converter is designed consisting of a unique Diaphragm Air Pump, a Micro Motor, a Transformer, a Charging Plate, a rechargeable Battery all fitted in a Metal Box. The battery is provided as a stand-by power to use the system continuously even when the power fails. The Regulator is provided with automatic switch over provision to the battery when the power fails. The full charging time of the battery is 5 hours. When the regulator runs on power, it simultaneously charges the battery and once it is fully charged the power cuts-off automatically stops over-charging the battery.<br>
The main part of the Regulator/Converter is the Diaphragm Air Pump. The Air Pump is designed and developed in a manner that it pumps only necessary volume of air to convert Hexane liquid into Hexane gas. The pump pumps the air creating a pressure of 0.03 PSI to 1 PSI in the Fuel Tank. If the Pressure in the Fuel Tank increases to more that 1 PSI, the pump stops pumping air and avoids creating high pressure. As long as the Stove is burning, the pressure in the Fuel Tank shall never exceed more than 1 PSI. If the Stove is not working/burning, the pressure in the Fuel Tank increases but before the pressure reaches 1 PSI in the Fuel Tank, the air pump stops working and avoids any pressure hazard. So it is the unique design of the pump which is suitable to convert Hexane liquid into Hexane gas with optimum efficiency and with built in safeguards to avoid pumping excess air into the Fuel Tank/ cylinder.<br>
The Micro Motor and the diaphragm works as a unit for specific function.<br>
The rechargeable Battery is provided to work the system continuously in case of power failures to complete the entire cooking. The Battery works<br><br>
continuously for 8 hours and recharges automatically when the Power is available.<br>
The entire Cooking gas System is connected through 2 rubber pipes i.e. one pipe is connected Fuel Tank to the Regulator through which air is pumped. The second pipe connects Fuel Tank to the Stove through which Hexane gas reaches to the stove from the Fuel Tank. The second pipe, that is the pipe connecting Fuel Tank/cylinder to the Stove, is provided with a non-return valve. The non-return valve allows Hexane gas from the Fuel Tank to the stove but stops any back pressure from the Stove to the Fuel tank and thereby prevents hot gases to go into the Fuel tank/cylinder.<br>
Yet another valve which is the non return safety valve is provided between the fuel tank/cylinder and the convertor so that the pressure generated in the fuel tank does not damage the motor of the convertor. Once the pressure inside the fuel tank increases, the non return safety valve operates and releases the increased pressure to the atmosphere.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 1 shows the complete cooking system with gas stove, non- return valve, gas cylinder and the regulator.<br>
Figure 2 shows the complete design of the fuel tank/ cylinder<br>

Figure 4 shows the details of the regulator/convertor and its components illustrating the lead acid battery, on/off switch, charger Ckt, indicators, fransformer 6V/750 milli Amps, diaphragm pump, pump outlet to cylinder and micrometer.<br>
Figure 5 shows the assembly of the regulator with fuel container<br><br>
WORKING:<br>
The liquid fuel stored in the cylinder (3) is in the stable form when the cooking system is not in use. As the cooking system is switched on, the micromotor (8) in the Electronic regulator (4) activates the diaphragm pump (6) to send air to the fuel container under preset pressure and flow. The air goes and mixes with the fuel vapors available in the container and forms rich hexane fuel air mixture. This mixture is sent to the stove inlet through the regulator (4) under the preset pressure. The rich mixture at the stove inlet enters the mixing chamber in the stove's burning tube through the various sized jet. There it mixes with the required quantity of atmospheric air to form the perfect burning mixture. This mixture then comes out through the lmm/2mm holes of the burner top and by ignition catches fire and bums.<br>
ADVANTAGES:<br>
The instant Cooking Gas System is the safest cooking system compared to all other Cooking Systems in the Country. This Cooking System is the first system in the world using Hexane as a Cooking Fuel.<br>
Thermal efficiency is more in such type of cooking system<br>
It is more economical than the usual LPG system and is less hazardous.<br>
It is for commercial use such as in Hotels, canteens etc.<br>
There is no need of replacing the cylinder every time the gas is exhausted, it could be refilled by liquid gas in the house itself or at the dealer's point.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
