Description<br>
Self-locking Bolted Fastener<br>
The invention relates to a self-locking bolted fastener to join components by means of at least one bolt and by means of at least one nut, wedging means being provided to prevent rotation.<br>
From published patent application DE 100 60 963 Al, a bolted fastener with wedging means has become known, the wedging means serving to prevent rotation. A bolt holds two components together. The head of the bolt rests against the base of a round hole arranged in a component. The axis of the round hole is offset from the axis of the bolt by an eccentricity. Wedging means rest against the head of the bolt and against the inside surface of the round hole. When the bolt is screwed in, the wedging means are increasingly jammed between the head of the bolt and the inside surface, the bolt being thereby held and made insensitive to vibrational and lateral forces.<br>
A disadvantage of the known device is that a round hole that is eccentric to the threaded hole is required. Also, the wedging means in the form of a block with seating surface and thread require high outlay.<br>
It is here that the invention sets out to provide a remedy. The invention as characterized in Claim 1 provides a solution to avoiding the disadvantages of the known device and creating a self-locking bolted fastener that is easy to install.<br>
Advantageous further developments of the invention are stated in the dependent claims.<br><br>
The advantages obtained from the invention are mainly to be seen in that with the eccentric fastener according to the invention, easy assembly with few parts is possible and valuable worktime can thereby be saved. Additional drilling operations or positive-fit wedging means with seating surfaces are obviated.<br>
The eccentric fastener according to the invention is easier, cheaper, and less complicated to manufacture than comparable bolted fasteners with wedging means. Faster and easier assembly and disassembly, as well as the use of fewer parts, are economically advantageous. The assembly work and assembly process of the escalator are thereby substantially shortened.<br>
The present invention is explained in more detail by reference to the attached figures.<br>
Shown are in<br>
Fig. 1<br>
an upper head-piece of an escalator with truss;<br>
Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4<br>
a bolted fastener according to the invention before,<br>
during, and after assembly;<br>
Fig. 5<br>
details of a bracket; and<br>
Fig. 6<br>
details of an eccentric element.<br><br>
Fig. 1 shows an upper head-piece 3 of an escalator or moving walk with rail block 5 and truss 6. The rail block 5 comprises a drive wheel 5.1 for driving a chain-band of the steps or pallets, a drive wheel 5.2 for driving the handrail, and guiderails 5.3 for guiding the step rollers or pallet rollers.<br>
The rail block 5 is fastened by means of bolted fasteners to the truss 6. A bracket 7 serves as connecting part between the rail block 5 and truss 6. The bracket 7 is fastened by means of bolts 9, nuts 10, and eccentric elements 8 to the rail block 5 and crosspieces 11 having oblong holes 12, and to struts 6.1 having oblong holes 6.2, of the truss 6. The self-locking positive-fit joint that thereby results forms a compact, durable, adequately dimensioned force interface. Additional welding or pinning operations are obviated. When the bolts 9 and nuts 10 are tightened, the eccentrics 8 turn and become positive-fitting and tight in the receptacle holes 7.2.<br>
With the fastener according to the invention, valuable worktime can be saved. The fastener is easier, cheaper, and less complicated to manufacture. Welding, cleaning with chipping hammer and wire brush, as well as drilling and hammering dowel-pins into place are obviated.<br>
Further components (for example comb plate or balustrade) of the escalator or moving walk can also be fastened together by means of bolts 9 and eccentrics 8 and nuts 10 as described above.<br>
Fig. 2 shows in exploded view the bolted fastener according to the invention that should fasten the bracket 7 to the crosspiece 11. Arranged in the crosspiece 11 are a crosswise oblong hole 12 and a lengthwise oblong hole 12.<br><br>
The oblong holes 12 can also be arranged tilted or sloping. The square neck 9.1 of the bolt 9 fits into the oblong hole 12 and prevents the bolt 9 from turning. The head 9.2 rests against the oblong hole 12 and against the crosspiece 11. The bracket 7 has lugs 7.1 that serve to center the bracket<br>
7	on the crosspiece 11. Also provided in the bracket 7 are receptacle holes 7.2. The diameter of the eccentric element<br>
8	that acts as wedging means, hereinafter referred to as the eccentric 8, fits onto the slightly larger diameter of the receptacle holes 7.2, and the eccentrics 8 fit into the receptacle holes 7.2. Provided on the end face of the bracket 7 are further receptacle holes 7.2 that serve to fasten the bracket 7 to the strut 6.1.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the bracket 7 positioned on the crosspiece 11, the receptacle holes 7.2 being aligned with the oblong holes 12.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the bracket 7 completely mounted on the crosspiece 11. The eccentrics 8 have been inserted into the receptacle holes 7.2. The bolts 9 penetrate the oblong holes 12 as well as the eccentric round holes 8.1 which are the holes of the eccentrics 8. The nuts 10 have been screwed onto the bolts 9 and tightened. Tightening the nuts 10 has caused the eccentrics 8 to be turned with frictional engagement and positive fit in their receptacle holes 7.2. On account of the eccentricity of the eccentric 8 relative to the bolt 9, and of the round hole 8.1 relative to the receptacle hole 7.2, a self-locking bolted joint is created.<br>
Fig. 5 shows details of the angle-shaped bracket 7 comprising a first arm 7.3 with lug 7.1 and a second arm 7.4. In the first arm 7.3 are two receptacle holes 7.2 for bolted fastening to the crosspiece 11 and in the second arm<br><br>
7.4 are three receptacle holes for bolted fastening to the strut 6.1. Bracket 7, bolts 9, eccentrics 8, and nuts 10 form a self-locking bolted joint to the crosspiece 11, and to the strut 6.1, of the truss 6 as described above.<br>
Fig. 6 shows details of the eccentric 8. The eccentric 8 has essentially the form of a half-cylinder with a flange 8.2 serving as stop at one end, the sheath or outer surface serving as sliding surface 8.3 that slides when inserted into, and turned in, the receptacle hole 7.2. The flange 8.2 prevents the eccentric 8 from entering completely into, or passing completely through, the receptacle hole 7.2, in that the flange 8.2 rests against the circumference of the receptacle hole 7.2. The axis of symmetry of the eccentric is indicated by the line M. The center of the eccentric round hole 8.1 is offset by the distance d from the axis of symmetry of the eccentric M, the axis of symmetry of the eccentric M being aligned with the axis of symmetry of the receptacle hole 7.2. When the nut 10 is screwed on or tightened, the eccentric 8 acting as wedging means turns about the bolt 9 and, on account of its eccentricity, wedges itself into the receptacle hole 7.2. The wedged eccentric 8 prevents accidental loosening or accidental unscrewing of the nut 10.<br>
The crosspiece 11 and strut 6.1 can also be fastened to the bracket 7 with only one bolt 9, one eccentric 8, and one nut 10. The crosspiece 11 and strut 6.1 can also be joined directly without the bracket 7. The receptacle holes 7.2 are then arranged in one of the two struts.<br>
The bolted fastener according to the invention can also be used for joining components in devices other than escalators or moving walks as, for example, elevators,<br><br>
aerial cableways, cable railways, hoisting equipment, or machines.<br><br><br>
