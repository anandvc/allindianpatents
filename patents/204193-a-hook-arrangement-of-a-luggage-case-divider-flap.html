The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :<br>
	1 9 APR 2004          19-4-2004<br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a hook arrangement of a luggage case divider flap.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
A luggage case such as suitcase or briefcase may include a divider flap disposed therein to provide a partition between the bottom shell and top shell thereof. The rear side of the divider flap is hinged at the rear side inner surface of the top shell of the suitcase. The front side of the divider flap is provided with a hook arrangement at each end thereof to releasably clamp the divider flap on a tumable T-shaped knob provided at each end of the front side inner surface of a top frame fitted to the top shell edge. The hook arrangement comprises a fixed member one end of which is riveted at the front side of the divider flap and the other end of which is provided with a cross rib. The hook arrangement also comprises a hook member provided with a cross rib at one end thereof and a slot at other end<br><br><br>
thereof  A narrow woven elastic fabric material loop is engaged over the cross rib of the fixed member and the crossrib of the hook member. The slot in the hook member is adapted to be engaged over and disengaged from the turnable T-shaped knob. The hook member is held by hand and pulled towards the turnable knob to engage it over the knob. While the hook member is being pulled, the elastic fabric material loop gets stretched and is prone to tearing and failure due to fatigue over a period of time or frequent use. Due to frequent use or use over a period of time, the loop may loose its elasticity and sag causing the divider flap to sag in the clamped position thereof. In the undamped position of the divider flap, the hook member hangs down along with the loop. This is not desirable aesthetically. Making of the loop involves cutting a narrow woven elastic fabric material ribbon to size and fusing the edges. This is time consuming and tedious and increases assembly time of the hook arrangement. Colours of the loops are generally matched with the colours of the inside linings of the luggage case and also the divider flap. This calls for stocks of elastic ribbons of different colours and increases number of inventories thereby increasing cost and labour. Good quality elastic ribbons are also expensive. The fixed member and hook<br><br><br>
member are generally made of plastics. Therefore, the cross ribs thereof may break over a period of time or due to frequent use or if the pulling force exerted on the hook member is very high. Due to the loop being elastic when the hook member is pulled it invariably moves with a wabble and jerk which may cause the loop to rub against the hook member. Besides, the fixed member is, usually fixed at the front side of the divider flap with a single rivet which may rotate when the hook member is being pulled and cause the loop to rub against the hook member. Due to rubbing, the loop may tear and fail over a period of time or due to frequent use. Rotation of the fixed member also causes misalignment of the hook member with the T-shaped knob. The hook member does not have any positive finger grip and may slip out of hand while being pulled.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a hook arrangement of a luggage case divider flap, which eliminates narrow woven elastic fabric material loop and drawbacks associated therewith.<br><br><br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a hook arrangement of a luggage case divider flap which is simple in construction and easy, less time consuming and convenient to make and assemble and is economical.<br>

Another object of the invention is to provide a hook arrangement of a luggage case divider flap, which has excellent aesthetic appearance.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
According to the invention there is provided a hook arrangement of a luggage case divider flap comprising a fixed member one end of which is riveted at the front side of the divider flap and the other end of which defines a neck and shoulders at opposite sides at the base of the neck and a hook member formed with a U-shaped open slot at one end thereof and disposed over the neck through the U-shaped open slot, the tips of the opposite sidewalls of the U-shaped open slot abutting the shoulders of the fixed member, the hook member being spring stretched to the fixed member and adapted to describe sliding guided movement along the neck, the hook member being provided with finger grip means and a slot at the other end thereof adapted to engage over and disengage from a turnable T-<br><br><br>
shaped knob fixed at the front side inner surface of a top frame fitted to the top shell edge.<br>
The following is a detailed description of the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which :<br>
Fig 1 is isometric view of a luggage case, namely, suitcase in the open position thereof and provided with hook arrangements according to an embodiment of the invention;<br>
Fig 2 is enlarged view at X in Fig 1;<br>
Figs 3 and 4 are front side and rear side isometric views of a hook arrangement of Fig 1; and<br>
Fig 5 is an exploded isometric view of the hook arrangement of Figs 3 and 4.<br><br>
Referring to Figs 1 to 5 of the accompanying drawings, the bottom and top shells of the suitcase are marked 1 and 2, respectively. 3 is a divider flap whose rear side is hinged at the rearside inner surface of the top shell and whose front side is provided with a pair of hook arrangements 4,4 one at each end. The other features/parts of the suitcase have not been marked and described as such are not necessary for understanding the invention. Each of the hook arrangements 4 of the invention comprises a fixed member 5 one end of which is riveted at the front side of the divider flap with a pair of rivets 6, 6 (rivet holes marked 7,7) lying across the width thereof. The other end of the fixed member defines a neck 8 and shoulders 9, 9 at opposite sides at the base of the neck. The fixed member is provided with an oblong recess 10 at the inner surface thereof extending into the neck. The opposite side walls 11a, 1 la of the neck bordering the recess extending into the neck define oblong matching openings 12, 12. 13 is a hook member formed with a U-shaped open slot 14 at one end thereof. The hook member is disposed over the neck 8 of the fixed member through the U-shaped open slot 14. The opposite side walls of the U-shaped open slot are marked 15,15. The hook member is spring stretched to the fixed member with a tension<br><br><br>
spring 16 located in the oblong recess 10 at the inner surface of the fixed member. One end of the tension spring is anchored on a metallic cross pin 17 located in the fixed member through holes 18, 18 in the opposite side walls lib, lib bordering recess 10 in the fixed member at the inner surface thereof. The cross pin 17 is disposed across the recess 10. The other end of the tension spring is anchored on another metallic cross pin 19 located in the opposite side walls 15,15 of the U-shaped open slot 14 through holes 20, 20 in the side walls 15, 15. The pin 19 runs through the oblong matching openings 12, 12 in the opposite side walls 11a, 11a of the neck 8. The cross pins 17 and 19 are knurled (knurls marked 17a and 19a, respectively) at one end to retain their position in the side walls 11a, 11a and lib, lib respectively while in use. The tips of the opposite sidewalls 15, 15 of the U-shaped open slot 14 abut the shoulders 9, 9 at the base of the neck 8 of the fixed member to arrest the movement of the hook member in the direction of the fixed member. The hook member is provided with finger grip means comprising a pair of ergonomicaUy designed notches 21, 21 at opposite sides thereof. The hook member is also provided with a slot 22 at the other end thereof. Each of the hook arrangements is associated with a turnable T-<br><br><br>
shaped knob 23 positioned in a base 24 fitted at the front side inner surface of a top frame 25 fitted to the top shell edge 26. The T-shaped knob comprises a right angled flange 27 and a cross flange 28. The right angled flange 27 is tumable in the base 24. In order to clamp the divider flap onto the T-shaped knob, the T-shaped knob is turned and its cross flange is ahgned with the slot 22 of the hook member followed by pulling the hook member forward against the spring tension and engaging it over the rightangled flange of the T-shaped knob through the slot 22 which is adapted to pass over the cross flange 28 when the cross flange is ahgned with it. The T-shaped knob is again turned and its cross flange is made to he across the slot 22 thereby preventing the hook member from getting detached from the T-shaped knob and clamping the divider flap to the T-shaped knob. The right angled flange 27 of the T-shaped knob bears the load/force of the hook. The divider flap remains clamped under spring tension as the spring tends to regain its original position. The divider flap is undamped from the T-shaped biob by turning the T-shaped knob and ahgning the cross flange with the slot 22. On getting disengaged from the T-shaped knob, the hook member retracts in the direction of the fixed member and regains its original position<br><br><br>
due to contraction of the spring. During forward and backward movement of the hook member, it defines a shding guided movement along the neck of the fixed member. The fixed member and hook member may be moulded of plastics such as polypropylene, nylon or acrylonitrile butadiene styrene in order to render manufacture and assembly of the hook arrangement of the invention easy, convenient, less time consuming and economical. The crosspins may be made of steel.<br>
According to the invention the narrow woven elastic fabric material loop and disadvantages associated with it have been eliminated. It comprises mainly the fixed member, hook member and spring anchored on the cross pins. Therefore, it is simple in construction and easy, less time consuming and convenient to make and assemble and is economical. Chances of breakage of the metallic crosspins and spring failure over a period of use or due to frequent use are comparatively very less. Therefore, the hook arrangement of the invention has long life and is reliable and ensures trouble free performance over a period of time. The finger grip means of the invention provides positive finger grip to facilitate pulling of<br><br><br>
the hook member and prevents finger slippage. Because the hook member describes guided sliding movement it does not wabble and jerk during movement. As the hook member is under spring tension the divider flap does not sag in the clamped position thereof. The hook member also does not hang down in its non-operative position. This gives good aesthetic appearance to the hook arrangement. As the fixed member is riveted with two rivets chances of its rotation and misalignment with the T-shaped knob have been eliminated.<br>
The above embodiment of the invention is by way of illustrative example and should not be construed to be limitative of the scope thereof. Several variations of the invention are possible without deviating from the scope thereof. For instance, the neck and U-shaped open slot may be interchanged with the hook member and the fixed member, respectively. The guided movement of the hook member may be a different construction. The hook member may be spring stretched differently. The fixed member may be riveted with one rivet. The geometry/profile of the fixed member and hook member may be different. Instead of tension spring, compression<br><br>
spring may be used. Rivets may be used instead of knurled cross pins. The finger grip means may be of different geometry/profile/construction. Such variations are to be construed and understood to be within the scope of the invention.<br><br>
