METHOD FOR PREPARING ACYCLOVIR 2/3 HYDRATE;<br>
ZHEJIANG CHARIOTEER PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD., A COMPANY ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF CHINA, WHOSE ADDRESS IS TONGYUANXI, DAZHAN TOWNSHIP, XIANJU COUNTY, ZHEJIANG 317321, CHINA<br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br>
 <br>
1.	TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to the preparation of a nucleoside drug acyclovir (ACV) 2/3 hydrate.<br>
2.	BACKGROUND ART<br>
Acyclovir is a new HBV-DNA polymerase inhibitor, having broad spectrum antiviral activity against animal and human viruses.<br>
Kristl (Int. J. Phar. 1996, 139, 231-235) reported some crystal forms of acyclovir, including 2/3 hydrate, instable anhydrous form and anhydrous (stable) form 1 and anhydrous form 2. The results showed that, compared with other forms, 2/3 hydrate had higher water solubility and thus higher bioavailability, and was suitable for preparing antiviral preparations. The acyclovir in European Pharmacopeia is 2/3 hydrate. However, the preparation process and XRD data of acyclovir 2/3 hydrate have not been reported yet. Young (Arch. Pharm. Res. 2008, 31, 231-234) disclosed an acyclovir hydrate ( Form 3), which had a weight-loss as measured by Thermogravimetric Analysis(TGA)of about 6.74%.<br>
3.	SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The technical problem of the present invention to solve is to provide a method for preparing acyclovir 2/3 hydrate (i.e. ACV 2/3 hydrate), which is simple and suitable for industrial production.<br>
In order to solve the above technical problem, the invention adopts the following technical scheme:<br>
A method for preparing acyclovir 2/3 hydrate comprises: mixing acyclovir with water at<br>
weight ratio of 1:5-50, dissolving at 50-100°C, filtering, cooling filtrate to 0~30°C to precipitate<br>
crystal, collecting the crystal by filtration, and drying the crystal at 0~150°C for 0.5-24 hours to<br>
obtain acyclovir 2/3 hydrate.<br>
In the dry step of the present invention, the drying conditions should be controlled properly in order to obtain qualified acyclovir 2/3 hydrate with water content of 5.1% by weight. One of<br>
 <br>
ordinary skill in the art can carry out the dry step in a conventional manner to obtain acyclovir 2/3 hydrate. For example, if the dry step is carried out at high temperature (for example, over 1000c)<br>
and lasts a longer time, the crystal is easy to lose too much water and thus the water content may be below 5.1%, Generally, when the water content of the crystal gets to be below 5.1% after drying, the crystal can be placed under the circumstance of 60-80% relative humidity of air for 8-10 hours to obtain acyclovir 2/3 hydrate. Vacuum can be adopted to improve drying efficiency.<br>
In the present invention, the time required for precipitating crystal is 1-24 hours.<br>
Further, acyclovir and water are preferably mixed at weight ratio of 1:10~15.<br>
Preferably, the filtrate is cooled to 20~30°C and held for 4-10 hours to precipitate crystal.<br>
Preferably, the crystal is dried at 50-100°C for 5-12 hours to obtain acyclovir 2/3 hydrate.<br>
In the present invention, it is recommended to carry out the preparation of acyclovir 2/3 hydrate as follows: acyclovir and water are mixed at weight ratio of 1:5-50 and dissolved at 50~100°C. Then the mixture is filtered. The filtrate is cooled to 20-30°C and held for 4~10 hours to<br>
precipitate crystal. The crystal is collected by filtration, and then dried at 50-100°C for 5~12 hours to obtain the acyclovir 2/3 hydrate.<br>
The acyclovir 2/3 hydrate according to the present invention shows the following characteristic peaks expressed in terms of 29 and interplanar spacings (d value) in the X-ray powder diffraction pattern obtained with Cu-Ka radiation:<br>
<br>
Peak	20(°)	interplanar spacing d(A)<br>
1	about 7.0	about 12.7<br>
2	about 10.5	about 8.4<br>
3	about 13.1	about 6.8<br>
4	about 16.1	about 5.5<br>
5	about 18.3	about 4.9<br>
6	about 21.0	about 4.2<br>
7	about 24.9	about 3.7<br>
8	about 26.2	about 3.4<br>
9	about 29.2	about 3.0<br>
 <br>
The acyclovir 2/3 hydrate according to the present invention shows absorption peaks at about 3522cm"1, about 3471cm'1, about 3438cm"1, about 3294cm'1, about 3180cm"1, about 2854cm"1, about 2698cm"1, about 1716cm"1, about 1631cm"1, about 1610cm'1, about 1483cm"1, about 1388cm"1, about 1182cm"1, about 1105cm"1, about 1049cm"1, and about 902cm"1 in the infrared absorption spectrum (KBr pellet).<br>
The acyclovir 2/3 hydrate according to the present invention has a weight-loss as measured by Thermogravimetric Analysis(TGA)of 5.1% by weight.<br>
The preparation process of the present invention is simple and suitable for industrial production. The acyclovir 2/3 hydrate according to the present invention has the following advantages:<br>
(1) It has the property required for large-scale preparation of drugs: for example, it has thermal<br>
decomposition point of over 250°C, and good fluidity and bulk density, which are in favor of drug<br>
preparation and industrial production on a large scale.<br>
(2) It has good stability of crystalline form. The stability test has shown that the acyclovir 2/3 hydrate obtained according to the present invention can be stored for more than one year at room temperature with relative humidity of less than 50%. During the storage time, the crystalline form remains the same and the content does not reduce, which completely comply with the European Pharmacopoeia specification. It can be stored in the dark, cool and dry place for a long time.<br>
