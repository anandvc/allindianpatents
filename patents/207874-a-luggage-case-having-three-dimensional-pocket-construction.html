COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
A  LUGGAGE  CASE HAUING  THREE  DIMENSIONAL  POCKET  CONSTRUCTION<br>
SAMSONITE CORPORATION, of 11200 East Forty-fifth Avenue, Denver, Colorado 80239, United States of America,<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention    and    the    manner    in    which    it    is    to    be    performed:-<br><br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The subject invention relates to luggage cases generally, especially so-called upright luggage cases having mostly textile front panels, with separately accessible pockets mounted on the main access door of the main packing compartment. More particularly, the subject invention relates to a simple method for assembling such pockets, and the door on which they are arrayed, from known textile construction materials.<br>
In the prior art type luggage case typified by Figures 1, 2 and 3, the overall luggage case is a generally 6-sided box shape with the main or front wall comprising a self-hinged door zippered to the front of the main packing compartment. The door includes at least two pockets, one above the other. Each of the pockets is assembled by a peripheral rail member sewn to the main zipper accessing door, with each rail having a pocket face of textile material stitched to the rail using an edge beading or the like. Further, zippered access may be had through the face of the pocket (as shown in the lower door of Figure 1) or along an upper portion of the rail, Such as that shown in the upper pocket of Figures 1 and 2. Figure 2 shows a side view of the prior art system where each pocket rail has a substantially uniform depth dimension creating luggage pockets with a similar parallelopiped shape. The space between the upper and lower pockets comprises essentially two thicknesses of rail material with a narrow gap therebetween. Both the upper and lower pockets are defined at their outermost edges by the edge beading as set forth above. The back of the prior art<br><br>
luggage case is similar to that of the instant invention in that it includes an. upwardly extendible handle assembly for wheeling the case on the fixed axis wheels shown at the lowermost corners of the case.<br>
While such prior art cases present pockets with substantial packing volume, the sewing and cutting operations to create these separately defined pockets are fairly complex.   The present invention teaches a simple construction technique that defines two visually and functionally distinct pockets on the main packing door of an upright case that are simple to construct yet are easy to understand and operate. Accordingly, the disclosed luggage case improvement comprises a first pocket carried by the main access door of an upright luggage case, this first pocket being constructed of a generally inverted U-shaped textile panel attached along its outermost edges across the top edge of the access door and down a substantial portion of the access door on either side of the top edge, and a door panel for this first pocket which is affixed in the bite of this U-shaped panel to form a three dimensional shape of the first pocket. This first pocket is accessible from the outside of the case. Below this first pocket is a second pocket extending the full width dimension of the access door and affixed at its upper edge to the lower edge of the first pocket. Thus, the second pocket forms, together with this first pocket, upstanding sides which extend around the entire periphery of the access door and define a packing volume on the main access door.<br>
Brief Description of the Figures<br>
Figure 1 shows a prior art luggage case or upright case with a pair of protruding pockets. Figure 2 is a side view of the prior art pocket construction.<br><br>
Figure 3 is a back view of the prior art case. Figure 4 is a perspective view of a case with the inventive pocket and main packing door construction. Figure 5 is a cross section through line 5-5 of Figure 4. Figure 6 is a cross-section through line 6-6 of Figure 4. Figure 7 is a closeup of a part of the pocket construction of Figure 4. Figure 8 is a cross section view similar to Figure 6 showing an alternative pocket construction.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
In Figure 4, the distinctive aesthetics and shape of a luggage case 10 is shown, resulting from the inveiitive construction as will be detailed. Note the inventive case has an overall upright luggage construction, including a pair of wheels 12 (one shown), glides 14 to steady the case in the upright position while resting on the wheels, and a pull-up handle 16 for pulling the case on the wheels 12 mounted at the back lower edge of the case. The case also includes edge beading 18 that continues substantially around the entire vertical periphery of the case between the main packing door 20 and the rest of the case. The main-packing door 20 is self-hinged to the remaining portion of the case and releasably closed by zipper 11 around 3 sides, and has a distinctive configuration and overall shape. The portion positioned forward in Figure 4 from the edge beading 18 not only looks distinctive but is constructed in a unique fashion. Starting from the top, the main packing door 20 includes a first pocket 26 comprised of an inverse U-shaped textile piece 22 that extends from about one-third to one-quarter of the overall height dimension of the door 20 down each side of the door and across the top of the door between the upper portion of the edge<br><br>
beading .18 and a zipper 24. This zipper selectively opens into the first pocket 26 formed on, protruding from, and carried by the access door 20. The first pocket has an access panel 28 which consists of an elongated rectangular textile panel which is rounded at its upper corners and positioned within the bite of the inverted U-shaped textile panel 22. Below this first door is a preferably single panel 30 that extends across the full width of the case from one side to the other of the peripheral edge beading 18. This panel 30 has a relatively harrow center portion that smoothly curves slightly outwardly to define relatively wide portions 32 at the extreme ends thereof. Immediately below this elongated panel is a large rectangular textile panel 34 that forms the front of the second pocket 38, as well as the zippered door 34 for access into the second pocket. Between the large rectangular textile door panel 34 and the elongated panel 30 is a second zippered opening 36 into the second pocket 38 carried by the main access door 20. Preferably, this rectangular textile panel again extends all the way across the access door 20 from one portion of the edge beading 14 to the other portion of the edge beading 18. Unlike the elongated panel 28, however, the rectangular textile panel 34 narrows or tapers along both its upper and lower edges substantially near each edge. A final or lower U-shaped elongated panel 40 closes off the bottom portion of the access door. This lower U-shaped panel is fastened along its lower edge to the lower portion of the edge beading 18 with known sewing techniques as will be detailed. The lower U-shaped panel 40 has an overall upright U-shape with' the ends of the U tapering at the edge beading 18.<br>
All of the panels, namely the inverted U-shaped panel 22, the first door 28, the elongated panel 36, the rectangular textile panel 34, and the second U-shaped panel<br><br>
40, are so shaped to form a three dimensional truncated pyramid shape with smoothly tapering edges around the periphery of the main access door, i.e., along each rectangular edge paralleling the edge beading 18 and an overall slightly bulbous front face. The elongated panel 30 is seen to define the relatively smaller elongated pocket 26 a substantial distance from the second pocket 38 which is substantially defined by the rectangular textile panel.  In fact, as will be seen from Figure 5, the packing volumes defined by these two pockets are not separated, but share a single textile wall 44. This is a major advantage over prior art constructions. Distinctive aspects of this construction include the complete absence of edge beading running vertical and parallel to the vertical portions of the edge beading 18. This is because each of the textile panels are attached to one another and shaped to form the overall three dimensional form of a truncated pyramid set forth above. This is especially facilitated by the shape of the inverted U-shaped panel 22 on the upper end and the second elongated panel 30, the second U-shaped panel 40, and rectangular panel 34 there¬between at the other end of door 20 which serve to not only define upwardly standing but slightly tapered upper and lower walls respectively of the overall access panel construction, but also at least partially define the vertical upstanding side walls of the overall construction. Cross section 5 shows the typical shape of the panel 28, as well as panels 30 and 34. Note how the main panels 28 (and thus 34) are forced to bow   ' outward, especially toward the lateral sides thereof. This bowing, together with the vertically extending portions of inverted U-shaped panel 22, create a tapering, sculptured pocket with a substantial volume created by the upstanding portions of panel 22 and the bowed portion of panel 28. Again,  while this is shown with regard to<br><br>
the first pocket and the panels which create that pocket, the same phenomenon occurs in virtually all portions of the main packing door. For example, panel 34 bends all the way around to beading 18 on both sides of the access door 20, but this bowing or bending is facilitated by the tapering shape of panel 30 and 40 as well as the stiffening members that make up those panels, as will be detailed below.<br>
Note in both Figures 5 and 6, stitch lines are schematically shown in these cross sections as short lines cutting across the various overlapping panel edges. Thus, the end portions of the elongated panel 30 and the corresponding end portions of the rectangular textile panel 34 also contribute to upstanding walls along the left and right vertical portions of the access panel.<br>
Referring particularly to Figure 6 as mentioned previously, one surprising aspect of this cross section is that, unlike the prior art case shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3, there is only a single divider wall or panel 44 between the upper pocket 26 and the lower pocket 38. In this way, all volume occupied by the case can accommodate the property of the traveler with almost no wasted space between the strongly visually separated pockets. In addition, a minimum amount of textile material need, be used to construct the voluminous upper and lower pockets, yet define and separate these pockets functionally.<br>
Note in particular that the main access zipper 11 is sewn using conventional sewing techniques between the main rail 48 of the luggage case and the access door construction, as is herein detailed. The inverted U-shaped panel 22 is constructed of an inner and an outer textile layer with a thin, flexible polymer foam or polymer sheet material 42 of known composition trapped between these two textile panels. This<br><br>
laminated construction of the inverted U-shaped panel 22 also characterizes the pocket door 28, the elongated panel 30, and the second elongated panel 40. The foam construction gives these panels a soft, yet structural, characteristic to let these elongated, relatively extensive panels 28 and 34 of textile fulfill the many functions normally carried by separate rail and edge beading construction. In contrast, the rectangular textile panel 34, behind which is formed the second larger pocket, is itself not necessarily stiffened by a foam panel. This is in order to reduce costs, but also to permit this panel to flex easily when opened and after being packed. Besides, it has been found that the thus properly structurally enhanced elongated panel 30 and second elongated panel 40 work together to shape the rectangular textile panel 34 appropriately for a good showing in the luggage shop.<br>
Between the first pocket and second pocket is a single textile divider 44 sewn to the back panel 49 of the access door and along the seam forming the upper edge of the access zipper 36 into the second pocket 38. The U-shaped zipper 24 into the first pocket opens readily to give access all the way down to this divider panel. This is especially important when this pocket tends to be the favored storing space for those last minute items such as umbrella, magazine, or the like, that must be retrieved rapidly. In contrast, the second pocket is much deeper than the first pocket, usually appropriate for a single item such as a trench coat or a rain coat, sweater or the like. Thus, this pocket can be much deeper and accessed by a less accommodating zipper opening 36 as shown.<br>
Alternatively, lower pocket 38 could be defined by a stiff laminated textile panel 34A (Figure 8), which is shaped to take the place of the three panels 34, 36 and<br><br>
WO 01/91597<br>
40. Here, access to the second pocket 3 8 is had through panel 49 on the back side of the main access door 20.<br><br>
