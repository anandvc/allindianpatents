CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application No.<br>
60/199208, filed 24 April 2000, which is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully<br>
disclosed herein.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
A structural panel which finds use as a ceiling panel or wall panel, includes an<br>
outer sheet having a plurality of spaced dividers protruding from one face thereof and<br>
a connecting sheet, or the like, parallel to and spaced from the outer sheet connecting<br>
the dividers together along their sides distal the outer sheet. The dividers are<br>
compressible for at least some period of time when pressure is applied thereto to<br>
reduce the thickness of the panel when desired, for example, for shipping purposes.<br>
Description of the Relevant Art<br>
Structural panels used in the finish or decoration of building structures have<br>
taken numerous forms from drywall to decorative or acoustical ceiling panels. While<br>
such panels obviously have different characteristics, the panels have had numerous<br>
shortcomings, such as from a weight standpoint, a shipping standpoint, a lack of<br>
aesthetic or acoustical variety, and the like.<br>
Some of these panels are used, for example, in drop ceiling systems wherein a<br>
gridwork of inverted T-shaped support members define rectangular openings in which<br>
acoustical panels or the like are placed. Such acoustical panels are typically rigid in<br><br>
nature and somewhat brittle. As a result, they are difficult to insert or remove from<br>
the supporting gridwork and in many cases are easily damaged during such process.<br>
Further, the ceiling panels are relatively heavy and are of a fixed thickness so that<br>
their shipping dimensions are the same as their installation dimensions. Due to their<br>
weight and bulk during shipping, the cost per square foot of such panels is relatively<br>
high.<br>
Drywall is also relatively heavy, difficult to work with and has a shipping size<br>
identical to that of its installation size. The shipping cost for drywall is, therefore,<br>
also relatively high.<br>
It will be appreciated from the above that structural panels used in the<br>
construction, finish and decoration of building structures suffer numerous<br>
shortcomings. A panel that would overcome such shortcomings would, therefore, be<br>
desirable.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The structural panel of the present invention can be used for a number of<br>
different uses as will be evident to those skilled in the art upon a reading of the<br>
present disclosure. Fundamentally, however, the panel would typically include an<br>
outer sheet of semi-rigid material with a plurality of dividers protruding from one face<br>
thereof. A connector in the form of a sheet or similar means is secured to the distal<br>
edges of the dividers. The connector could take the form of another sheet of material,<br>
strands of connective fibers, or the like.<br>
The dividers are collapsible in nature and could take numerous forms. In<br>
some of the described embodiments, the dividers are elongated cells having<br><br>
collapsible sides so that when lateral or transverse pressure is applied to the cell in<br>
predetermined directions it will collapse into a shallow space. The dividers can be<br>
formed from folding a strip of semi-rigid material such that the longitudinal sides or<br>
partitions fold inwardly or outwardly when the divider is compressed laterally. The<br>
dividers are constructed so as to normally assume an expanded or extended position<br>
of predetermined configuration and are resilient so as to return to that configuration<br>
after having been compressed. The dividers are secured to the outer sheet and the<br>
connector so as to remain in position relative thereto.<br>
As will be appreciated, with a panel so formed, it will assume an expanded<br>
form in its normal at rest condition, but by applying pressure to the outer sheet or the<br>
connector, the dividers are caused to collapse allowing the entire panel to assume a<br>
very thin thickness or profile. This, of course, is very advantageous for shipping<br>
purposes as a greater number of panels can be confined in a container than is possible<br>
with prior art panels that have a uniform thickness during shipping and use. The<br>
panels are also predominantly air filled and, therefore, are very lightweight.<br>
It will further be appreciated from the more detailed description hereafter that<br>
the panels can be bent at least in one direction to facilitate installation in a drop<br>
ceiling or the like but are resilient to resume their normal at rest position. Further, the<br>
panels are not brittle and do not damage easily. They can, further, be cut very simply<br>
into any predetermined size and/or configuration.<br>
Decorative sheets can also be overlaid onto the outer sheet, the connector<br>
sheet or the like of the panel to give the panel a desired aesthetic look. For example, a<br>
sheet of wood veneer, vinyl, patterned or contoured paper, colored paper, thin metal,<br>
polyester, other synthetic material, fabric, non-woven, or the like, can be overlaid so<br><br>
that the panel, when in use, has any desired appearance. Further, the panel can be interiorly or exteriorly<br>
lined with metal foil to change the properties of the panel.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a compressible structural panel comprising : at least<br>
one outer sheet of material having an inner face and an outer face ; a plurality of compressible<br>
dividers secured to and protruding from said inner face ; and connector means for securing said<br>
dividers together at locations distal from said outer sheet ; wherein each divider is longitudinally-<br>
elongated and comprises longitudinally-extending side partitions and longitudinally-extending fold<br>
lines such that, by applying pressure to the outer sheet or the connector means, said dividers are<br>
caused to fold along said fold lines and be compressed to reduce the thickness of the panel ;<br>
wherein each divider is expanded when in a resting condition and is resilient so as to return to that<br>
configuration after having been compressed such that the panel will assume an expanded form in<br>
its normal at rest condition ; and wherein said dividers comprise separate sheets of a semi-rigid but<br>
foldable material ; characterised in that said foldable material is made of glass fibers bonded together<br>
in a resin, such that each of said fold lines is resilient and comprises a crease formed without<br>
damaging significantly said fibers.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The compressible structural panel 50 of the present invention is probably best<br>
shown in Figs. 1 and 12 to include a plurality of collapsible preferably parallel<br><br>
dividers or beams 52 extending between an outer sheet 54 (not seen in Fig. 1) and a<br>
connector sheet 56. A decorative sheet 58, as seen in Figs. 1 and 12, may be provided<br>
to overlie in face-to-face relationship the outer sheet 54. As will be explained in more<br>
detail later, the panel is compressible from its normal expanded condition shown in<br>
Figs. 1 and 12 to a fully collapsed or compressed condition as shown in Fig. 17. The<br>
panel is also bendable in one transverse direction, as will be described in more detail<br>
later, but can be rigidified to inhibit bending in any direction. The panel is further<br>
comprised mostly of air and is, therefore, very light and easy to handle.<br>
The panel 50 has many possible uses in building structures, such as, for<br>
example, it might be used as a wall panel, fixed ceiling panel, as panels for a drop<br>
ceiling, or the like. It will also be appreciated from the description that follows that<br>
the panels could be made of different sizes some of which might be inordinately large<br>
in comparison to conventional panels used in building structures. For purposes of the<br>
present disclosure, the panel is illustrated of conventional size and for use in a drop<br>
ceiling as shown in Fig, 2.<br>
In a typical drop ceiling system, a gridwork of elongated inverted T-shaped<br>
support members 60, as seen in Figs. 2 and 3, are conventionally supported from a<br>
ceiling thereby defining rectangular openings 62 and peripheral support edges 64<br>
around those openings on which a ceiling tile or panel 50 can be positioned.<br>
Traditional ceiling panels, not being bendable or otherwise pliable, are difficult to<br>
insert into the rectangular openings 62 and due to the fact that they are aiso brittle,<br>
they are many times damaged or broken when being inserted. The panel of the<br>
present invention, as will be appreciated with the description that follows, is<br><br>
inherently bendable so as to facilitate its insertion into the rectangular opening of a<br>
drop ceiling system and once in place will resume a desired flat planar orientation.<br>
As probably best seen in Fig. 12, the dividers 52 are formed from individual<br>
strips 66 (Fig, 4) of material which have been pre-creased and folded into a desired<br>
configuration so that when incorporated into the panel 50 are transversely collapsible<br>
allowing the panel to be compressed if desired. The dividers are secured along top<br>
portions thereof to the connector sheet 56 and along bottom portions thereof to the<br>
outer sheet 54 with the connections desirably being made with adhesive 68, but other<br>
systems for connecting the components would be evident to those skilled in the art.<br>
The outer sheet is, in turn, adhesively or otherwise secured in face-to-face relationship<br>
to the decorative sheet 58, which is the sheet that is exposed to the interior of the<br>
building structure in which the panel is incorporated. A sheet may be defined as one<br>
or more pieces of material interlocked, bonded, welded, or otherwise joined to define<br>
a broad expansive surface. The decorative sheet could be any material such as real or<br>
synthetic wood, vinyl, patterned or contoured paper, foil, polyester, other synthetic<br>
material, fabric, non-woven, or the like. Of course, this material would normally be<br>
selected for the desired decor of the room in which the ceiling panel is being<br>
incorporated but might also be selected for its acoustical properties.<br>
In the disclosed embodiment, the outer sheet 54, the connector sheet 56 and<br>
the dividers 52 may be, but would not necessarily be, made from the same material.<br>
That material might be a fiberglass sheet composed of randomly oriented glass fibers<br>
bonded together in a resin. As will be explained in more detail later, the resin could<br>
be a thermosetting resin or a thermoplastic resin depending upon the desired<br>
characteristics of the panel. The adhesive 68 used to join the various components of<br><br>
the panel might typically be a thermosetting adhesive, which bonds the adjacent<br>
components upon attaining a predetermined temperature. Illustrations of suitable<br>
adhesives would include, however, polyurethane resins, copolyester hot melts, hot<br>
melt polyurethane reactive adhesives, two part epoxies, two part urethanes and RTV<br>
silicones.<br>
The dividers 52, as best illustrated in cross-section in Fig. 1 2, might, in<br>
combination, be formed from one continuous strip of material but in the disclosed<br>
embodiment are each individual dividers of an elongated cellular or tubular<br>
configuration. Each divider is formed from the strip 66 of material such as fiberglass<br>
in a manner as shown in Figs. 4-1 ],<br>
In Fig. 4, a front view of the flat strip 66 is illustrated before it is passed into a<br>
creaser. In the creaser, as seen in Fig. 5, the material is passed between rotary<br>
creasing wheels 70 and back up rollers 72 so that longitudinally extending creases 74<br>
are formed in the material at predetermined laterally spaced locations. In the<br>
preferred system, the creasing wheels have an arcuate creasing edge approximately a<br>
1/32" diameter and the back-up rollers are of 90-durometer hardness. With this<br>
apparatus, an efficient fold line is created without cutting the material or at least<br>
without damaging many, if any, of the glass fibers so that a spring force is retained in<br>
the material. As will be appreciated, starting at the left of the strip of material as<br>
shown in Fig. 5, a crease 74a is placed near the left edge in the top surface and<br>
another crease 74b is placed in the top surface at a location spaced slightly to the left<br>
of center. Between these two locations a crease 74c is placed in the bottom surface of<br>
the strip. Corresponding creases are placed on the right side of the strip so that the<br>
strip upon exiting the creaser has six creases formed therein as illustrated in Fig. 6.<br><br>
The strip 66 of material is then folded over and along the longitudinal creases as<br>
illustrated in Fig. 7, 8 and 8A bringing the side edges 76 of the strip together at a<br>
centered location on the top of the divider 52. Preferably, the breaking diameter of<br>
the fibers in the material is less than the combined thickness of the folded material so<br>
that minimal, if any, damage occurs to the fibers during folding. When so formed, the<br>
divider forms an elongated tube or cell comprised of two truncated triangles 78 and<br>
80 that are inverted relative to each other. The lower triangle 78 has a broader base<br>
than the upper triangle 80. The fiberglass material from which the divider is made is<br>
semi-rigid so that it can be flexed and folded along crease lines 74 but remains<br>
substantially flat between such folds. Applying pressure to the cell as configured in<br>
Fig. 7 in a vertical direction causes the components of the cell to collapse so that the<br>
divider assumes a compressed configuration as shown in Fig. 8. In the compressed<br>
configuration, the adhesive 68 can be applied across the top and bottom of the divider<br>
with the adhesive preferably being a thermosetting or thermoplastic adhesive applied<br>
in any of various different ways, which would be readily known to those skilled in the<br>
art.<br>
As seen in Fig. 10, the divider 52 with adhesive 68 applied to its upper and<br>
lower faces is then passed between the outer sheet 54 and the connector sheet 56 and<br>
as seen in Fig. 11, the entire laminate is then compressed between heated plates 82<br>
which activate the adhesive 68 in the case of thermoplastic adhesives or act as a<br>
catalyst in the case of thermosetting adhesives. Subsequent heat may be used to<br>
increase the curing rate of a thermosetting adhesive if selected.<br>
If a thermosetting resin is used in bonding the glass fibers within the strips 66<br>
and sheets 54 and 56 of material, the panel 50 will naturally expand to its preformed<br><br>
condition, as shown in Fig. 12, after having been compressed and bonded together. If<br>
the resin bonding the glass fibers is a thermoplastic resin, it will remain compressed<br>
but need only be reheated and the strips will inherently expand under the heat, which<br>
might be applied, for example, with a hair dryer. Under any circumstance, the panel<br>
can either inherently expand or be selectively expanded to a desired height or<br>
thickness.<br>
While it would be evident to one skilled in the art to modify the material from<br>
which the dividers 52, outer sheet 54 and connector sheet 56 are made, and in fact<br>
they could each be made of different materials, for purposes of the present disclosure,<br>
the following materials have been found satisfactory for each of the outer and<br>
connector sheets as well as the dividers:<br>
JM type 8802-100GSM (Glass Mat with thermoplastic resin) or JM type<br>
MF5020GSM (Glass Matt with thermosetting resin), each made by Johns-Manville<br>
Corp. of Denver, Colorado; or Ahlstrom type 51 50 GSM (Glass Tissue with<br>
thermosetting resin) made by Ahlstrom of Karhula, Finland.<br>
There are other materials that might work well, for example, for the outer<br>
sheet or the connector sheet but not for the dividers and, conversely, there are some<br>
materials that might work well for the dividers but not for the outer and connector<br>
sheets. For example, the outer and connector sheets could be one of many different<br>
sheet types of material, such as paper, cardboard, metal, plastic, polyester, other<br>
synthetic material, or the like. It does not even need to have structural stability as<br>
such stability is given to the panel by the dividers. The dividers, on the other hand,<br>
while preferably being made of fiberglass, could be made of a carbon fiber mat, some<br>
papers, cardboards, woven materials, films, or combinations thereof, with the<br><br>
important feature being that they have some predetermined modulus of resiliency,<br>
similar to the specific materials identified above, which allows them to be folded but<br>
remain resilient. If the materials are to be creased to define fold lines as discussed<br>
above in connection with fiberglass material, it is important that the material retain<br>
the modulus of resiliency after having been creased, which, of course, is true with<br>
fiberglass or carbon fiber materials.<br>
As seen in Fig. 13, the decorative sheet 58 could also be positioned between<br>
the outer sheet 54 and the heat press 82 with a suitable adhesive 66 therebetween to<br>
bond the decorative sheet in face-to-face relationship to the outer sheet. The resulting<br>
panel, of course, is illustrated in Fig. 12. When bonding the decorative sheet to the<br>
outer sheet and in addition to the alternatives mentioned above, a porous decorative<br>
sheet can be used which is bonded to the cover sheet with adhesive in a grid or printed<br>
dot pattern. This would allow the lamination to more freely pass or transmit sound<br>
therethrough. Conversely, if a continuous layer of adhesive were used to join the<br>
decorative sheet and the cover sheet, the transmission of sound through the laminate<br>
would be decreased. Through the lamination process, a relatively unstable decorative<br>
sheet can be rendered flat and stable with the resultant flat surface possibly also<br>
providing impact and puncture resistance superceding that of the cover sheet. It will<br>
be appreciated that the acoustics of the panel can be changed by varying the outer<br>
sheet material, the strip material, the adhesive, the connector sheet, the spacing<br>
between the sheets, the manner in which the assembly is joined together, or the like.<br>
Other materials could cover or be laminated to the connector sheet 56 as well.<br>
For example, films could be applied over the connector sheet or an additional sheet of<br>
non-fiberglass material laminated thereto. The panel in such case could be handled<br><br>
without gloves in that fiberglass can be abrasive and otherwise harmful to exposed<br>
skin. Further, the film or laminate for the connector sheet 56 could be printed with a<br>
manufacturer"s identification or with a measuring grid to facilitate cutting the panel to<br>
desired sizes. Further, and as mentioned previously with regard to the outer sheet 54,<br>
porous laminates or films could also be overlaid onto the connector sheet for<br>
acoustical purposes.<br>
As mentioned, numerous materials might have applicability in the present<br>
invention, but in the preferred mode, the connector sheet and the dividers are made of<br>
the same material, which is a fiberglass mat made by Johns-Manville Corporation and<br>
the mat may be one designated No. 5802 or one designated No. 5803 by Johns-<br>
Manville. The 5802 is a 120 g/m2 mat composed of 10% PET/65% 16-micron<br>
glass/25% MF. The 5803 is a 100 g/m2 mat composed of 12% PET/68% 16-micron<br>
glass/20% MF. MF is an abbreviation for melamine formaldehyde resin, which<br>
exhibits the characteristics of a thermoset resin. PET is an abbreviation for a<br>
polyethylene terephthalate. Dividers made from either of the 5802 or 5803 material<br>
have the ability to expand with little or no addition of heat after having been creased<br>
and folded as described previously and after having been fully compressed. A more<br>
complete description of the Johns-Manville products and related products can be<br>
found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,840,413, 5,942,288, and 5,972,434, which are herein<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
The preferred outer sheet is a composite lamination of an aesthetically<br>
pleasing textile material, which has been laminated to a glass non-woven base using a<br>
co-polyester hot-melt adhesive. Three different laminates are equally desirable. The<br>
first laminate utilizes a base substrate in the nature of a thermal bond polyester non-<br><br>
woven having a basis weight in the range of 45 to 75 g/m2 and can be purchased from<br>
Hollingsworth and Vose of Floyd, West Virginia. The adhesive pattern used to<br>
thermally bond the polyester fibers in the non-woven base substrate becomes the<br>
visual pattern upon the bottom surface of the outer sheet. When a small point-<br>
bonding pattern with a bonding area of approximately 7% is used, the preferred<br>
polyester non-woven material is one designated by Hollingsworth and Vose as<br>
TR2315A-B. When a large point-bonding pattern is used, approximately 21%<br>
bonding area, the preferred material is designated TR2864C1 by Hollingsworth and<br>
Vose. Either non-woven base substrate is then screen coated using an acrylic<br>
binder/flame retardant coating with an additional weight of 15 to 25 g/m2. The<br>
coating can be formulated to increase the durability of the non-woven base substrate<br>
while adding flame retardant. The polyester non-woven base substrate can then be<br>
run through a hot-melt roll coater/laminator where a flame resistant co-polyester<br>
adhesive from, for example, EMS Chemie North America of Sumter, North Carolina,<br>
is applied to the surface of either the polyester non-woven base substrate or the<br>
material to be coated thereon. The coating weight of this adhesive is dependent upon<br>
the bond strength desired to achieve between the polyester non-woven base substrate<br>
and the glass non-woven materials. Generally an adhesive having a basis weight in<br>
the range of 30 to 45 g/m2 has been found desirable. A Gravure roller, preferably<br>
having a Crosshatch 25x25 pattern thereon is used to compressively laminate the glass<br>
non-woven to the polyester non-woven base substrate. The depth of the engraving on<br>
the Gravure roller is a main variable related to the adhesive weight per area being<br>
applied. The adhesive formulation obtained from EMS Chemie is a 50:50 mix of two<br>
materials with the materials designated by EMS as Grilltex D1573G and Grilltex<br><br>
VP1692G. The EMS Grilltex VP1692G is compounded with a 25% loading of an<br>
organic phosphorous flame retardant. The resulting 50:50 mix produces a final flame-<br>
retardant loading of approximately 13.5%. Following the application of the adhesive<br>
upon the surface of the polyester non-woven, the adhesive is kept molten until it<br>
reaches the nip of the roll coater/laminator where it is joined with the glass non-<br>
woven. The glass non-woven is preferably the afore-noted 5802 (120 g/m2) matting<br>
sold by Johns-Manville, a glass non-woven from Ahlstrom designated GFT-413G10-<br>
60-1300 (60 g/m2) or a non-woven glass matting from Ahlstrom designated GFT-<br>
413G10-80-1300 (80 g/m2). A composite laminate made with the above-noted<br>
materials is inherently translucent and that feature combined with the ability of light<br>
to travel down the length of the cells defined between the dividers in a finished panel<br>
makes it possible to see shadows in the areas where two cells meet.<br>
The shadowing can be decreased if desired, by using, in lieu of the afore-noted<br>
polyester non-woven, an aesthetic material having a silver, gray, or black color upon<br>
its back side. The backside is the one, which receives the hot-melt adhesive and is<br>
subsequently laminated to the glass non-woven matting. The coloring reduces the<br>
amount of light which can travel down the cells and up through the surface thus<br>
reducing the shadowing effect.<br>
An alternative aesthetic material to the polyester non-woven described above<br>
is a knit material, which has a silver, gray, or black appearance on one side. To<br>
achieve this, a knit material from Gilford technical textiles of Greensboro, North<br>
Carolina, has been used with the knit material being composed of two different types<br>
of yarns in a single knit construction. The preferred yarns used are nylon and<br>
polyester. The nylon yarns are mainly observed on one side of the matting and the<br><br>
polyester on the other. The knitted material is "cross-dyed" with black dyestuffs that<br>
have affinity for the nylon and leaving the polyester white in color. A flame retardant<br>
and soil release may also be added to the dye bath formulation. The knit is then<br>
stabilized and a melamine resin added to stiffen the fabric. The knit material can then<br>
be run through the roll coater/laminator to laminate the knit material to the glass non-<br>
woven material as previously described with the polyester fiber material. The<br>
preferred Gravure roller pattern used in this case is one having a random<br>
computerized dot pattern and which is well known in the trade. When the silver,<br>
gray, or black side of the knit is laminated to the glass non-woven material, the light<br>
transmittance through the laminate is reduced by the presence of the darker layer.<br>
The visual appearance of the surface is unique in that it mimics the appearance of a<br>
perforated metal ceiling panel. You can also laminate the white side of the knit<br>
material to the glass non-woven material and when doing so, the appearance of the<br>
knit lamination mimics a metal screen material but also eliminates the shadowing<br><br>
effect.<br>
Another method of reducing reflected light and transmitted light shadowing is<br>
the use of a colored black, gray, or silver glass non-woven material. If the pigmented<br>
black, gray, or silver glass non-woven is laminated to either the polyester fiber mat or<br>
the knit matting described previously, the shadowing effect can also be reduced.<br>
It should also be noted that the coloring of the aesthetic material, whether it be<br>
the polyester fiber matting or the knit material, could be obtained by printing or<br>
coating the materials with a colored pigment. This would involve a secondary<br>
printing or coating step, which would add to the cost. The use of colored or<br><br>
pigmented adhesive may also be employed as a low-cost solution to the shadowing<br>
and/or increased surface whiteness of the aesthetic material.<br>
Figs. 14-17 illustrate the assembled panel 50 in progressively compressed<br>
conditions with Fig. 14 showing the panel in a fully expanded condition and Fig. 17 in<br>
a fully collapsed or compressed condition.<br>
An isometric view of the panel 50 is shown in Fig. 18 and an enlargement<br>
thereof in Fig. 19. It will there be readily appreciated that the dividers 52 are evenly<br>
spaced from each other while extending parallel to each other and longitudinally of<br>
the panel. Of course, in Figs. 18 and 19, the panel is fully expanded with the panel<br>
being shown fully compressed in corresponding views 20 and 21, respectively.<br>
A problem with conventional ceiling panels is that they remain of the same size<br>
and thickness during shipment, installation and use. A desirable feature of the panel of<br>
the present invention resides in the fact that, while the panel has a predetermined at<br>
rest thickness that might correspond with that of conventional ceiling panels when<br>
fully expanded, it can be compressed for shipping purposes so that far more panels can<br>
be packed in one container for shipping purposes thereby improving shipping costs<br>
considerably. When the panels are removed from the shipping container, they will<br>
either naturally expand if a thermosetting resin was used in the fiberglass material or<br>
can be heated to expand if a thermoplastic resin was used. While the panel could be<br>
expanded to any desired thickness, a preferred panel for ceilings might be in the range<br>
of 12 to 26 mm in thickness when desirably expanded depending on the span of the<br>
panel but could be thicker or thinner depending on use, and approximately 3-4 mm in<br>
thickness when fully compressed.<br><br>
As best seen in Fig. 31, the panel 50 can easily be flexed or bent transversely<br>
of the direction in which the elongated dividers 52 extend to facilitate the insertion of<br>
the panel into the support structure of a drop ceiling, for example. In fact, the panel<br>
can be preformed in the bent configuration so that this becomes its at rest<br>
configuration should a curved panel be desired for some reason. The panel will not<br>
flex or bend very easily in the opposite direction, i.e. the direction in which the<br>
dividers extend, as the tubular configurations of the dividers will inhibit such. If<br>
desired, however, the panel can be substantially rigidified so that it is inhibited from<br>
bending in either transverse direction by placing support members 84 along opposite<br>
ends of the panel so as to cover the open ends 86 of the tubular or cellular dividers.<br>
The support members 84 can either be preformed C-shaped channel members 88<br>
(such as plastic, aluminum, etc.) of a rigid configuration, as illustrated in Figs. 24 and<br>
25, or can be strips 90 of adhesive material, for example, which are adhered to the<br>
ends of the panel as illustrated in Fig. 26. While the strips of adhesive material would<br>
have some flexibility, it would have enough stiffness so that when incorporated onto<br>
the ends of the panel, it will inherently prevent the panel from bending in a transverse<br>
direction relative to the longitudinal direction of the dividers. Plastic or vinyl tapes or<br>
the like would be an illustration of a suitable adhesive strip. As a further alternative<br>
and as shown in Figs. 65-67, a divider 52a could be placed at each end of the panel to<br>
cover the open ends of the parallel dividers 52. The outer sheet 54 and connector<br>
sheet 56 are extended to cover the dividers 52a which serve to rigidify the panel in the<br>
cross direction.<br>
The panel can also be rigidified in a cross-direction by incorporating cross<br>
dividers (not shown) at selected locations throughout the panel. The cross dividers<br><br>
would run perpendicular to the primary dividers and might assume an identical or<br>
varied configuration to the cross-sectional configuration of the primary dividers. Of<br>
course, the cross dividers could be adhesively bonded in the panel the same as the<br>
primary dividers. The height of the dividers, whether they be primary dividers or<br>
cross dividers, can also be varied across the width of a panel to create varied structural<br>
and aesthetic effects.<br>
To change the structural characteristics of the dividers 52, the outer or inner<br>
surface of the divider can also be laminated with another sheet of material and<br>
possibly a metallic sheet material 92, which renders the divider material slightly more<br>
rigid, as illustrated in Figs. 28 and 27, respectively. A metallic sheet would also<br>
affect the thermal characteristics of the panel. Fig. 27 shows the metallic sheet<br>
material on a panel with a support member 88 while Fig. 28 does not include a<br>
support member. Of course, the lamination process would take place during the<br>
formation of the divider and preferably immediately before creasing.<br>
As seen in Figs. 29 and 30, the panel formed in accordance with the above<br>
process is unique in that pressure applied at any one location to one surface of the<br>
panel will only depress the panel at that location and will not deform the opposite side<br>
of the panel. The panel will also support multiples of its own weight without<br>
deflection on the opposite side of the panel. By way of example, a panel formed in<br>
accordance with the present invention that is 26 millimeters thick when expanded and<br>
which is 24 inches wide by 48 inches long weighs approximately .9 kilograms (1.98<br>
pounds). The panel can support up to 2.9 kilograms load (6.38 pounds) in the form of<br>
a circular weight 10 inches in diameter with minimal deflection observed on the<br>
opposite side of the panel. Point loads of approximately 2 inches in diameter and<br><br>
weighing 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) are also easily absorbed by the same panel with no<br>
deflection of the bottom surface.<br>
With reference to Figs. 33-35, a second embodiment of a panel 94 is<br>
illustrated wherein the connector sheet 54 has been replaced with a connector in the<br>
form of a plurality of elongated flexible but non-extensible strands or fibers 96.<br>
These strands or fibers could be plastic, nylon or other similar material having the<br>
same or similar characteristics. The strands or fibers of material can be adhesively or<br>
otherwise bonded to tubular dividers 52" while extending transversely thereto and with<br>
the fibers spaced from each other preferably in a parallel relationship to each other. A<br>
panel 94 so formed can be easily flexed or bent, as illustrated in Fig. 35, in a direction<br>
transverse to the longitudinal direction of the dividers as with the previously<br>
described panel.<br>
In each of the afore-described embodiments of the invention, the dividers have<br>
identical side partitions 98 (Figs. 12 and 34) which have longitudinal fold lines 100<br>
therein so that the side partitions collapse inwardly when the panel is compressed.<br>
The side partitions thereby define upper and lower portions 98a and 98b, respectively,<br>
which are rectangular in configuration but wherein the upper portion 98a is of a<br>
smaller dimension than the lower portion 98b. This arrangement might be referred to<br>
as an asymmetric arrangement in that the upper portion of the divider is of a different<br>
size than the lower portion.<br>
A third embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in Figs. 36-42 and in<br>
this embodiment, a panel 102 is identical to that shown in Fig. 12 except that the<br>
partitions 104 in the dividers 105 are symmetric in configuration. In other words, the<br>
panel 102 includes an outer sheet 54" and a connector sheet 56" interconnected by<br><br>
dividers with partitions and may include a decorative panel 58" overlying the outer<br>
sheet if desired. Fold lines 106 along the partitions 104, however, are positioned so<br>
that an upper rectangular portion 104a of each partition is of equal size to a lower<br>
rectangular portion 104b. The panel 102 can again be compressed.<br>
The compressed and expanded forms of the panel 102 shown in Figs. 36-38<br>
are illustrated isometrically in Figs. 39 and 40 and it will be appreciated that the panel<br>
can be fully compressed to a depth or profile that is far less than its normal expanded<br>
condition.<br>
As seen in Figs. 41 and 42, when the panels are stacked, a considerable<br>
amount of space can be saved by compressing the panels, which, of course, saves<br>
considerable expense when shipping as, more panels can be compressed and shipped<br>
in one container than with conventional ceiling panels.<br>
An advantage of a panel using symmetric dividers resides in the elimination of<br>
telegraphing that can, if not carefully watched, exist in compressed panels.<br>
Telegraphing is a phenomenon that can result in compressed panels of the type<br>
described herein when a sheet is compressed tightly against other components of the<br>
panel such as dividers or partitions. If the pressure is too great or the dividers exert<br>
too much resistance, a visual pattern can be seen through the sheet where a partition is<br>
secured thereto and where it is not.<br>
By reference to Fig. 17, which illustrates a panel with asymmetric dividers, it<br>
will be appreciated there are spaces between the dividers along their connections to<br>
the connector sheet, but such a gap hardly exists when using symmetric dividers as<br>
best seen in Fig. 38. Accordingly, in a panel using symmetric dividers as shown in<br>
Fig. 38, telegraphing is virtually eliminated regardless of the pressure applied to the<br><br>
panel. It should also be appreciated, however, that in panels of the present invention<br>
with symmetric or asymmetric dividers, there is less tendency for telegraphing due to<br>
the fact that when the connector sheet is forced downwardly against the dividers, they<br>
do not resist the pressure but simply compress so that an adequate pressure for<br>
bonding the connector sheet to the dividers can be applied without creating<br>
telegraphing.<br>
By changing the location of the fold line 106 in each side partition of a divider<br>
105, the resistance of the panel to compression can also be regulated. For example, in<br>
the at rest expanded position of an asymmetric panel 50 such as disclosed as the first<br>
embodiment of the present invention and shown in Figs. 43 and 45, an obtuse<br>
angle (a) is formed in the side partition 98 which is greater than the corresponding<br>
angle, (d) in the partition 104 as shown in Fig. 46 of a symmetric panel. The height A<br>
of each panel in the expanded form is, however, identical. Note also the difference in<br>
the length B and C of the upper and lower portions 98a and 98b, respectively, of the<br>
side partitions of the asymmetric divider, whereas in the symmetric divider illustrated<br>
in Fig. 46, the length D of the upper partition portion 104a and the lower partition<br>
portion 104b are identical.<br>
The greater the angle (a) or (d) in the side partition, the more resistance there<br>
will be to compressing the panel, as illustrated in Figs. 47 and 48. In Figs. 47 and 48,<br>
an equal force F is shown being applied to the asymmetric divider panel 50 in Fig. 47<br>
and the symmetric divider panel 102 in Fig. 48 and it will be seen that the same<br>
amount of force compresses the symmetric divider panel a greater amount. This is<br>
because the angle in the side partition in the symmetric divider panel is smaller than<br>
the angle in the asymmetric divider panel.<br><br>
By way of illustration and not limitation, in a panel formed in accordance with<br>
the present invention which has been found to provide satisfactory performance and<br>
wherein the outer sheet, connector sheet and dividers are all made of 100GSM Johns<br>
Manville #8802 glass matting, the parameters identified in Figs. 43 through 46 fall in<br>
the following ranges:<br>
X= 5 to 10 mm<br>
S= 20 to 40 mm<br>
A= 15 to 26 mm<br>
B= 8 to 10 mm<br>
C= 13.5 to 17 mm<br>
D= 13.5 to 15 mm<br>
a= 100 to 120 degrees<br>
b= 100 to 120 degrees<br>
In another alternative embodiment 108 of a panel in accordance with the<br>
present invention shown in Figs. 51 and 52, the connector sheet of the previously<br>
described embodiments is eliminated by the use of a unique divider 110. The divider<br>
110, as best seen in Figs. 49 and 50, is of generally hourglass configuration defining<br>
two truncated triangular zones 112 and 114 inverted relative to each other similarly to<br>
the first described embodiment of the present invention, but the top of the divider has<br>
a long horizontal leg adapted to overlap an adjacent divider so as to have a segmented<br>
connector sheet 116 that is composed of a plurality of interconnected strips defined by<br>
the horizontal top leg of the divider. While the divider 110 has been shown to be<br>
asymmetric, it could, in fact, assume a symmetric configuration similar to that shown<br>
in the third described embodiment of the present invention. The divider, therefore,<br><br>
has a base 118, a left side partition 120 and a right side partition 122, with each side<br>
partition having a horizontal leg 124 and 126 respectively at its top. Both of the side<br>
partitions have a crease line 128 so that the side partitions will collapse when pressure<br>
is applied to the top or bottom of the divider. The horizontal top leg 126 of the right<br>
side partition is approximately a third of the width of the divider at its top, but the<br>
horizontal leg 124 from the left side divider is slightly longer than the base 118 of the<br>
divider so that it overlies and overlaps the horizontal top leg 122 of the right divider.<br>
As is best seen in Fig. 51, when a plurality of the dividers 110 are positioned<br>
in immediately adjacent or contiguous side-by-side relationship, the top horizontal leg<br>
124 from the left side partition 120 extends beyond the right side partition 122 and<br>
into overlapping relationship with the top horizontal leg 124 of the left side partition<br>
120 of the next adjacent partition to the right. The overlapping horizontal top legs<br>
124 from the left side partitions thereby form in combination a segmented but<br>
integrated connector sheet. Of course, the top horizontal leg 124 from the left side<br>
partitions of each divider is adhesively secured to the top horizontal leg 126 from the<br>
right side partition and also to the top horizontal leg 124 from the left side partition of<br>
the divider that is to the immediate right thereof. A cover sheet 130 is secured to the<br>
base 118 of each of the dividers to interconnect the dividers along their bases and, of<br>
course, a decorative sheet (not shown) can be secured to the lower face of the outer<br>
sheet or the segmented connector sheet if desired.<br>
Still another embodiment 132 of a panel formed in accordance with the<br>
present invention is shown in Figs. 53-55, and in this embodiment, the dividers 134<br>
are not cellular in and of themselves but are rather strips of material that have been<br>
folded into a zig-zag pattern and secured between an outer sheet 136 and a connector<br><br>
sheet 138 so as to form a cellular compressible panel. Looking initially at Figs. 53<br>
and 54, the divider 134 is formed from a strip of material which has a pair of outer<br>
parallel crease lines 140 and inner parallel crease lines 142 but with the outer crease<br>
lines being folded in opposite directions and the inner crease lines being folded in<br>
opposite directions. A pair of attachment surfaces or marginal zones 144 and 146 are<br>
thereby defined between the outer crease lines 140 and the side edges 148 of the strip<br>
which can be secured in any suitable manner to the outer sheet and the connector<br>
sheet respectively. In between these marginal zones of the dividers, an intermediate<br>
portion 150 of the divider has the two inner folds therein allowing the strip to collapse<br>
when transverse pressure is applied to either of the marginal zones. The panel 132<br>
formed with the dividers 134 of Figs. 53 and 54 is shown in Figs. 55 and 56 in an<br>
expanded and compressed condition, respectively.<br>
Another divider 152 is shown in Figs. 57 and 58 for use in a panel 154 shown<br>
in Figs. 59 and 60 in an expanded and collapsed condition, respectively. The divider<br>
152, as seen in Figs. 57 and 58, includes a pair of parallel outer crease lines 156 with<br>
folds in the same direction therein spaced inwardly from the side edges 158 of a strip<br>
of material from which the divider is formed and a third intermediate crease line 160<br>
between the parallel outer crease lines. An upper marginal zone 162 is defined<br>
between one edge of the strip of material and one of the outer crease lines and a<br>
second much larger lower marginal zone 164 is defined along the bottom of the<br>
divider between the associated edge of the strip of material and the adjacent crease<br>
line. A fold in an opposite direction is provided at the intermediate crease line 160 so<br>
that the divider has upper and lower marginal zones of different widths that both<br>
project to the right, as viewed in Fig. 8, from their adjacent fold lines 156. The upper<br><br>
marginal zone 162 of each divider is secured to a connector sheet 166 at parallel<br>
equally spaced locations while the lower marginal zones 164 are adapted to extend to<br>
the right and overlap a small portion of the next adjacent divider to the right. The<br>
overlapping lower marginal zones are secured to each other thereby forming an<br>
integrated segmented outer sheet 168 formed from the plurality of lower marginal<br>
zones of the respective dividers. Of course, a decorative sheet (not shown) could<br>
overlie the interconnected lower marginal zones or the connector sheet to provide<br>
variety to the aesthetics of the panel.<br>
A similar embodiment 170 of a divider is shown in Figs. 61-64 where, again, a<br>
strip of material is provided with a pair of outer crease lines 172 and an intermediate<br>
crease line 174 therebetween, with upper and lower marginal zones 176 and 178 being<br>
defined between the edges 180 of the strip and the outer crease lines 172. The folds at<br>
the outer crease lines 172 are in an opposite direction to the fold along the<br>
intermediate crease line 174 so that the outer and lower marginal zones both project<br>
horizontally to the right, as viewed in Fig. 62. As will be appreciated, both of the<br>
horizontal zones extend horizontally beyond the intermediate crease line 174 and are<br>
adapted to overlap the upper and lower marginal zones of adjacent dividers to the<br>
right so that they can be secured thereto in any suitable manner to form the panel<br>
shown expanded in Fig. 63 and compressed in Fig. 64.<br>
In a further embodiment of a panel 182 made in accordance with the teachings<br>
of the present invention, and as seen in Figs. 68-73, the panel again has an outer sheet<br>
54, a connector sheet 56 and a plurality of dividers 184 extending therebetween. As is<br>
probably best seen in Figs. 68 and 71, the dividers 184a in a part of the panel are of Z-<br>
shaped cross-section while the dividers 184b in the other part of the panel are of<br><br>
reverse Z-shaped cross-section. At the location 186 at which the direction of the<br>
dividers changes, the panel can be bent at a right angle as seen in Figs. 72 and 73 so<br>
that the panel can, for example, follow the right-angled contours of building<br>
components on which it is mounted. For example, the panel could be wrapped around<br>
rectangular ductwork of the type that might be found in a house for conducting forced<br>
air or the like.<br>
Referring again to Figs. 68 and 71, it will be appreciated on the right-hand<br>
portion of the panel that the dividers 184a are Z-shaped in cross-section so as to<br>
define an upper horizontal leg 188 that extends to the left, a lower horizontal leg 190<br>
that extends to the right and a diagonal connecting leg 192 that connects the right<br>
edge of the upper leg to the left edge of the lower leg. The Z-shaped dividers 184a<br>
are, of course, formed similarly to those described previously by placing crease lines<br>
in strips of material from which the dividers are made and then folding the strips of<br>
material along the crease lines. The reverse Z-shaped dividers 184b on the left side of<br>
the panel, of course, have an upper horizontal leg 194 that extends to the right, a<br>
lower horizontal leg 196 that extends to the left and a diagonal connecting leg 198<br>
that extends from the left edge of the upper leg to the right edge of the lower leg.<br>
As is best seen in Figs. 68 and 71-73, at the location 186 where the direction<br>
of the dividers changes, (in the illustrated panel, near its center) the panel can be<br>
folded at a right angle. The panel can then be fully expanded as shown in Figs. 72<br>
and 73 so that the legs of the dividers are perpendicular to each other thereby forming<br>
rectangular cells.<br><br>
With reference to Figs. 68 and 69, it will be appreciated that the panel can also<br>
be compressed as with the earlier described embodiments of panels made in<br>
accordance with the present invention.<br>
The panel is also amenable to rigidification in a cross-direction in a manner<br>
illustrated in Figs. 74-79. It will there be appreciated that a segment of the panel near<br>
an end thereof can be partially cut at 89 by cutting through the connector sheet 56 and<br>
the dividers 52 (in a direction transverse to the length of the dividers) but not severing<br>
the outer sheet 54. This cut forms a small band 91 of material, which can be<br>
independently compressed as illustrated in Fig. 75 to receive a rigidifying clip 93.<br>
The rigidifying clip in the disclosed embodiment is of substantially J-shaped cross-<br>
section having a long side 95, a spaced parallel short side 97, a connecting wall 99<br>
interconnecting corresponding edges of the long and short sides and a lip 101<br>
depending from the long side along the opposite edge from the connecting wall 99.<br>
The clip is mounted on the compressed band of material so as to retain the material in<br>
a compressed state. The clip and compressed material can then be folded upwardly as<br>
shown in Figs. 77 and 78 to form a rigidification along the end of the panel. Of<br>
course, the rigidified band of material can be adhesively secured in position after it<br>
has been folded upwardly as illustrated in Figs. 78 and 79 if desired.<br>
The clip, with appropriate modification readily evident to those skilled in the<br>
art, can also be used as a mounting clip for suspending the panel from ceiling support<br>
members (not shown) such as of the type described in co-pending application Serial<br>
No. 08/752,957, filed April 10, 2000, entitled A Cladding System and Panel for Use<br>
in Such System, which is of common ownership with the present invention. That<br>
application is hereby incorporated by reference.<br><br>
It should be further understood from the above description of the various<br>
embodiments of the present invention that the dividers each have unique features that<br>
could be incorporated into the other embodiments. By way of example only, the<br>
upper and lower portions of the side partitions of the various dividers or the upper and<br>
lower portions of the walls separating the upper and lower marginal zones could be of<br>
the same or different dimensions so as to define symmetric and asymmetric dividers.<br>
Further, simply changing the angle in the side partition of a divider causes one panel<br>
to be more compressible than another. Similarly, by spacing the dividers at greater<br>
distances, the panel would be more easily bendable in a transverse direction to the<br>
dividers. The depth of the dividers will also affect the strength of the panels<br>
(assuming other parameters remain unchanged) so that the length and width of a panel<br>
(i.e. the span) can be significantly enlarged without altering strength or bonding<br>
characteristics of the panel simply by increasing the depth of the dividers. Also, as<br>
mentioned previously, numerous aesthetics and acoustical properties can be created<br>
by laminating different types of decorative sheets to the outer sheet of the panel so<br>
that one might create a different color, pattern, texture, or the like to the interior of the<br>
room in which the panel is used.<br>
It will further be appreciated from the above description that the material from<br>
which the outer sheet, connector sheet or dividers is made can be varied to achieve<br>
different characteristics for the panel. For example, the materials could be varied to<br>
obtain different acoustic characteristics for the panel or to obtain different light<br>
transmitting characteristics. Also, the materials could be fire retardant to inhibit the<br>
spread of a fire in a building in which the panels were being used. It would also be<br>
possible to utilize different materials in the panel with for example the cover sheet or<br><br>
the connector sheet being made of the same or different materials and the dividers<br>
also being made of a material that is the same as or different from one of the cover or<br>
connector sheets. The dividers themselves might be made of different materials in a<br>
single panel. For example certain dividers may be provided to obtain the resilient and<br>
compressible feature of the panel while other dividers might be provided to vary the<br>
acoustics, light transmitting or fire retardant capabilities of the panel. Also, the panels<br>
could be stacked in a building structure to alter the acoustic or light transmitting<br>
characteristics of the panels.<br>
While the panels previously described have principally been described for use<br>
as a replacement to conventional acoustical tiles that are supported on the T-shaped<br>
support members of a drop ceiling gridwork, the panel can be modified slightly so as<br>
to also be suspendable from the same T-shaped support members. As will be.<br>
appreciated, by suspending panels of the present invention from the T-shape support<br>
members 60, the panels can be used to replace or renew an existing ceiling system<br>
with or without removing the acoustical tiles positioned or supported on top of the T-<br>
shaped support members 60.<br>
A panel 200 that has been modified to be suspendable from or supportable by<br>
the T-shaped support members 60 is shown in Figs. 80-96 with a plurality of the<br>
panels shown in Fig. 8 installed in underlying relationship to existing acoustical<br>
panels 202 supported on support members 60. As will be appreciated, each panel 200<br>
is of the general type previously described and as seen in Figs. 84-86 has an outer<br>
sheet 204, a connector sheet 206, and a plurality of parallel cellular dividers 208<br>
therebetween. The cellular dividers are preferably, as previously described,<br>
compressible in nature and best seen in Figs. 87-91 as being formed from individual<br><br>
strips of material that have been creased and folded so as to define elongated tubes<br>
having two truncated triangular areas 210 and 212 superimposed upon each other.<br>
The dividers 208 have collapsible intermediate side walls 214 with fold lines 216,<br>
which allow the side walls to either collapse inwardly as shown in Figs. 89-91 or<br>
expand outwardly as shown in Figs. 87 and 88 depending upon a number of<br>
conditions including the type of binder used in the fiberglass matting material from<br>
which the dividers are made and the treatment of the dividers to heat and cold which<br>
will be described in more detail later.<br>
At each end of the panel 200 along the open ends of the cellular dividers 208,<br>
a unique clip 218 as seen best in Figs. 81-86, is secured to the panel. The clips are<br>
elongated and preferably extruded members of a rigid material such as aluminum,<br>
plastic, or the like and are generally of inverted J-shaped configuration as probably<br>
best seen in Fig. 82. They therefore define a vertical main flat body 220 with a lower<br>
protruding Up 222 from the bottom edge of the main body. An upper downwardly<br>
opening hook-shaped channel 224 extends from the upper edge of the main body.<br>
Also along the upper edge is formed a second or horizontally opening hook-shaped<br>
channel 226 which protrudes from the main body in the opposite direction as the lip<br>
222. An obliquely protruding rib 228 extends downwardly from the upper edge of the<br>
main body beneath the horizontally opening channel 226.<br>
With reference to Figs. 92-95, the clip 218 is secured to the end of the panel<br>
200 either by notching the end of the panel, as described previously, so that the outer<br>
sheet 204 protrudes longitudinally from opposite ends of the panel or the outer sheet<br>
can be made slightly longer and wider than the remainder of the panel so that it<br>
naturally protrudes from opposite ends and opposite sides as shown in Figs. 87 and 92<br><br>
defining outer sheet longitudinal extensions 230 and outer sheet lateral extension 232.<br>
An elongated straight stiffening strip 234, which might be made of plastic, aluminum,<br>
paperboard, or the like, is adhesively bonded to the top surface of the outer sheet<br>
longitudinal extension 230 where it protrudes from the ends of the panel and clips are<br>
thereafter positioned over the outer sheet longitudinal extensions and the stiffeners as<br>
shown in Fig. 94 by inserting the stiffener strips and outer sheet longitudinal<br>
extensions into the downwardly opening J-shaped channels 224 adjacent to the main<br>
bodies with the lip 222 hanging over the innermost edge of the stiffeners. With the<br>
clips so positioned, the outer sheet longitudinal extensions 230, stiffener 234 and clip<br>
218 can be folded upwardly as shown in Fig. 95 until the connector sheet 206 at<br>
opposite ends of the panel is received between the horizontally opening J-shape<br>
channels 226 and the oblique ribs 228 of clips. The underside of the horizontally<br>
opening J-shaped channels 226 can then be adhesively or otherwise secured to the<br>
connector sheet 206 to hold the clip in the position illustrated in Fig. 95.<br>
The oblique rib 228 of each clip projects beneath the connector sheet 206 so as<br>
to hold the panel in a fully expanded position. By following the same procedure at<br>
each longitudinal end of the panel, it will be appreciated that each panel will have a<br>
clip thereon and the horizontally opening J-shaped channels 226 are positioned to be<br>
secured to a flange of the T-shaped support member 60 as shown in Figs. 84 and 85.<br>
An alternative way for securing a J-shaped clip to ends of the panel is shown<br>
in Figs. 92A-95A. In the alternative system, at an open longitudinal end of a panel, a<br>
cut or slit is made downwardly through the connector sheet 206 and the open ends of<br>
the dividers 208 as shown in Fig. 92A, so as to define a slight gap between the<br>
severed portions of the connector sheet and the dividers and the remainder of the<br><br>
panel. The connector sheet and dividers are then compressed downwardly into<br>
closely adjacent relationship with the outer sheet 204 and this compressed material is<br>
then inserted into the downwardly opening J-shaped channels 224 of the clip so that<br>
the lip 222 of the clip hangs over the innermost edge of the compressed material, as<br>
shown in Fig. 94A. The clip with the compressed material confined therein is then<br>
folded upwardly as shown in Fig. 95A and secured in position, preferably with<br>
adhesive so as to define a longitudinal end of a panel.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 83, the ends of the horizontally opening J-shaped<br>
channels 226 are spaced inwardly from opposite longitudinal ends of the clip 218 to<br>
accommodate a T-shaped support member 60 that extends perpendicularly to the T-<br>
shaped support member 60 to which the clip is secured. In this manner, the panels<br>
can be supported by a conventional gridwork of T-shaped support members in a<br>
suspended rather than supported manner with or without another set of acoustical tiles<br>
being supported by the gridwork. In other words, the panels 200 with the clips 218<br>
secured thereto can be used in connection with an existing gridwork or in connection<br>
with a new gridwork in exactly the same manner. As will also be appreciated, the<br>
clips of adjacent longitudinally aligned panels can abut each other (Fig. 85) so the<br>
ends of the outer sheets of the panels are only slightly spaced to give a substantially<br>
continuous appearance to the ceiling with virtually no view of the gridwork from<br>
which the panels are suspended. Further, due to the fact that the clips hold the panels<br>
in their fully expanded position, the lower or outer sheet 204 of each panel will be<br>
horizontally aligned with the outer sheet of an adjacent panel to give a smooth<br>
uniform appearance to a ceiling formed from such panels. Referring to Figs. 87-91,<br>
the outer sheet lateral extensions 232 can be folded up into engagement with the<br><br>
adjacent sidewall 214 of the outermost divider and secured thereto with a suitable<br>
adhesive to give the panel a finished look along its side edges.<br>
Sometimes it might be desirable to fold a panel around a corner or to form a<br>
corner. With the panel of the present invention, such a fold or corner can be made in<br>
an aesthetically attractive manner as illustrated in Figs. 97 and 98. It will be seen in<br>
Fig. 97 that a divider 208 including the connector sheet 206 across the top thereof can<br>
be severed from the remainder of the panel at the location where a fold or bend is<br>
desired in the panel leaving the outer sheet 204 where the divider was removed. The<br>
remaining portions of the panel can be folded in one direction or the other as<br>
illustrated in Fig. 98 so that one remainder portion of the panel is oriented .<br>
perpendicularly to the other portion with the outer sheet 204 extending continuously<br>
around the bend so as to define a fully finished corner for the panel. Such a fold in<br>
the panel might be desirable, for example, in a skylight where a window is raised<br>
above the ceiling level into an upwardly recessed area and by following the procedure<br>
shown in Figs. 97 and 98, a panel or panels can be folded to extend from the normal<br>
ceiling level up into the recessed area of the skylight.<br>
As mentioned previously, the preferred material from which the dividers are<br>
made, includes glass fibers and a mixture of a thermoset resin and a thermoplastic<br>
resin. The material so formed wants to remain in a flat planar orientation even after<br>
having been creased and folded as described previously into the configuration of the<br>
divider as illustrated for example in Figs. 89-91. In order to retain the folded<br>
configuration with the side walls 214 of each divider folded inwardly, the panel 200<br>
over a long period of time needs to be held in at least some compression or the folded<br>
side walls will fold outwardly in an effort to return to the flat planar orientation. Of<br><br>
course, the dividers cannot return to the flat planar orientation as they are secured<br>
along the top and bottom to the outer sheet 204 and connector sheet 206 but the side<br>
walls will over some period of time try to straighten out if not held in compression<br>
and when doing so, pass from their inwardly folded orientation of Fig. 89 to their<br>
outwardly folded orientation of Fig. 88 wherein the side walls abut the side walls of<br>
adjacent dividers thereby being mutually reinforced and rigidifying the panel so that it<br>
is virtually incompressible. A panel in its substantially incompressible condition is<br>
shown in Fig. 96. In other words, to maintain the compressible nature of a completed<br>
panel, the sidewalls need to be folded inwardly as shown in Figs. 89-91.<br>
The strips of material from which the dividers 208 are made are folded in an<br>
unheated environment and a hot melt adhesive is applied to the strips or to the outer<br>
sheet 204 and connector sheet 206 before they are laminated together. As mentioned<br>
previously, unless the panels 200 are maintained in a compressed configuration such<br>
as illustrated in Figs. 89-91, they will, over some period of time, expand into the<br>
configuration of Fig. 88 in which configuration the panel is no longer compressible.<br>
This time period over which it takes for the dividers to convert from the configuration<br>
of Figs. 89-91 to the configuration of Fig. 88 is dependent upon a number of factors<br>
including the resin used in the material from which the dividers are made and also<br>
whether or not heat is applied to the material while the dividers are in the compressed<br>
configuration of Figs. 89-91. By adding heat to the dividers while they are<br>
compressed, the time period it takes for them to expand into the configuration of Fig.<br>
88 is lengthened. Also, by increasing the percent of thermoplastic resin used in the<br>
formation of the material from which the dividers are made, the time in which it takes<br>
for the dividers to transform from the configuration of Fig. 89 to the configuration of<br><br>
Fig. 88 can be increased. By way of example, the time period for the transformation<br>
may be varied anywhere from 15 minutes to 32 hours.<br>
Accordingly, when the panels 200 are formed and shipped, they are desirably<br>
shipped in a compressed state so that a relatively large number of panels can be<br>
packed and shipped in a relatively small container particularly in comparison to<br>
conventional acoustical tiles of a fixed depth, i.e., a depth similar to the fully<br>
expanded depth of a panel 200 in accordance with the present invention. Once the<br>
panels are removed from the shipping container, however, they expand immediately<br>
from the configuration shown in Fig. 91 through the configuration shown in Fig. 90 to<br>
the configuration shown in Fig. 89. They will remain in the configuration of Fig. 89<br>
for the above-noted time period after which they will transform into the configuration<br>
shown in Fig. 88 where the panel becomes incompressible. During that time period,<br>
the panels can be cut to their desired shape and installed in a supporting grid system<br>
before the panels become substantially incompressible. They can therefore be flexed<br>
for easy insertion into the openings defined between support members in the<br>
supporting grid system if inserted before becoming incompressible.<br>
As mentioned previously, panels formed in accordance with the present<br>
invention have desired acoustical properties and can be varied according to various<br>
parameters. In comparing one embodiment of the present invention with<br>
conventional acoustical tiles, one can see the acoustical benefit obtained from a panel<br>
formed in accordance with the present invention. In Fig. 99, a graph comparing the<br>
panel of Fig. 14 of the present invention with other acoustical tiles is illustrated. The<br>
X-axis references frequency in hertz while the Y-axis references a noise reduction<br>
coefficient. The three panels compared to the panel formed in accordance with Fig.<br><br>
14 of the present invention are a hard mineral acoustical tile panel manufactured by<br>
Armstrong under the trademark "Cirrus," a glass fiber tile of two-inch thickness<br>
manufactured by Ecophon of Sweden under the trademark "Focus," and a 0.7 mm<br>
metal panel with perforations and an overlying sheet of a non-woven fleece<br>
manufactured by Hunter Douglas of Rotterdam, Holland, under the designation<br>
Luxalon 300C.<br>
As can be seen, the acoustical panel of Fig. 14 performs superiorly to the three<br>
compared panels at lower frequencies as well as at fairly high frequencies and<br>
performs comparably at intermediate frequencies.<br>
Although the present invention has been described with a certain degree of<br>
particularity, it is understood that the present disclosure has been made by way of<br>
example, and changes in detail or structure may be made without departing from the<br>
spirit of the invention as defined in the appended claims.<br><br>
WE CLAIM :<br>
1. A compressible structural panel (50, 94, 102, 108, 132, 154, 182, 200)comprising :<br>
at least one outer sheet (54, 54", 116, 136, 168, 204) of material having an inner face and an<br>
outer face;<br>
a plurality of compressible dividers (52, 52", 105, 110, 134, 152, 170, 184,208) secured<br>
to and protruding from said inner face ; and<br>
connector means (56, 56", 96, 130, 138, 166,206) for securing said dividers together<br>
at locations distal from said outer sheet;<br>
- wherein each divider is longitudinally-elongated and comprises longitudinally-<br>
extending side partitions (98, 104, 120, 122, 192, 214) and longitudinally-extending fold<br>
lines (74,106,128,140,142, 156, 160, 172, 174, 216) such that, by applying pressure<br>
to the outer sheet (54, 54", 116, 136, 168, 204) or the connector means (56, 56", 96, 130,<br>
138, 166, 206), said dividers (52, 52", 105, 110, 134, 152, 170, 184, 208) are caused to<br>
fold along said fold lines and be compressed to reduce the thickness of the panel (50, 94,<br>
102,108,132,154,182,200);<br>
-wherein each divider (52,52", 105, 110, 134, 152, 170, 184,208) is expanded when in<br>
a resting condition and is resilient so as to return to that configuration after having<br>
been compressed such that the panel (50, 94, 102, 108, 132, 154, 182,200) will assume an<br>
expanded form in its normal at rest condition ; and<br><br>
- wherein said dividers (52, 52", 105, 110, 134, 152, 170, 184, 208) comprise separate sheets of a<br>
semi-rigid but foldable material;<br>
characterised in that<br>
- said foldable material is made of glass fibers bonded together in a resin, such that each<br>
