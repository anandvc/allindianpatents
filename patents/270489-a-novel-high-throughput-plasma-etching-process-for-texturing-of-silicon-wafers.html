FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
Solar cells are fabricated from multicrystalline silicon wafers<br>
(mc-si). One of the essential requirements for high efficiency<br>
solar cells is minimization of the reflection of incident light<br>
from its front surface for enhanced light harvesting.<br>
The present invention relates to development of a novel high<br>
throughput plasma etching process for texturing multicrystalline<br>
silicon wafers (mc-Si) and their application in solar cell<br>
fabrication.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION;<br>
Plasma etching provides a stress-free method suitable for texturing<br>
thin silicon wafers, independent of crystal orientation, for<br>
obtaining isotropically texturised mc-Si surface that is not<br>
possible with wet alkaline method used for texturing<br>
monocrystalline silicon wafers. In recent publications on the<br>
subject, improvement in efficiency of mc-Si solar cells has been<br>
reported using plasma texturing process when compared to other<br>
methods of surface texturing.<br>
The improvement in efficiency of mc-Si solar cells has been<br>
attributed to: a) complete suppression of reflectivity (
broad spectral range (300-1000 nm) leading to black silicon<br>
surface, b) implementation of the texturing process in the chemical<br>
etching dominated mode that results in reduced surface damage or<br>
additionally performing defect removal etching and c) passivation<br>
of the surface and bulk defects in silicon by the PECVD deposited<br>
silicon nitride AR coating film.<br>
Using optimum ratios of flow rates of SF6 and O2 etch precursors<br>
under the influence of 13.56 MHz RF power and pressure-electrode<br>
gap combination, a reaction byproduct causing self-masking was<br>
created on the surface of mc-Si wafer to give random etching,<br>
independent of the crystal orientation. This random etching of<br>
silicon surface lead to wavelength scale nanostructures (typical<br>
size: 150-200 nm) exhibiting enhanced light harvesting property.<br>
The high throughput of the texturing process was realized through a<br>
custom designed, three chamber industrial system (one process and<br>
two load lock chambers) suitable for processing 20 wafers per batch<br>
(each of 156 mm sq. size).<br>
The uniformity in texturing was obtained by introducing innovative<br>
features like, premixing of process gases (high molecular weight<br>
SF6 gas with low molecular weight O2 gas through a gas blender) and<br>
uniform distribution of premixed gasses to obtain uniform plasma<br>
over the entire wafer carrier (Si2e:~0.7 m2)was carried out through<br>
a showerhead electrode.<br>
A process invention (Ref: Patent application No. 768/KOL/2007 A,<br>
Date of filing application: 18/05/2007) disclosing a self-masking,<br>
low energy, RIE (Reactive Ion Etching) plasma process for surface<br>
texturing of 125 mm sq mc-Si wafers for use in solar cell is in the<br>
process of granting the patent. SF6 and O2 gas mixture under 13.56<br>
MHz RF power, produces reactive ions responsible for random surface<br>
etching of silicon wafers called texturing. The process resulted in<br>
formation of nanostructures with size comparable to wavelength of<br>
incident light exhibited efficient light trapping and facilitated<br>
enhanced surface passivation due to hydrogen released by PECVD<br>
SiNx.<br>
The wafer surface was polished with alkali solution essential for<br>
initiating texturing process on damage-free surface to get optimum<br>
quality solar cell emitter. Use of minimum RF power density and<br>
mounting of the wafer on grounded carrier plate lead to a damage-<br>
free textured surface of the wafer. Further, wafer surface was<br>
treated with acid based damage removal etch to eliminate<br>
possibility of any plasma damaged textured surface.<br>
The overall outcome of the multicrystalline silicon texturing<br>
process lead to an improved solar cell efficiency upto 15.1% for<br>
125 mm sq size, which is 2.4% absolute higher compared to the one<br>
without RIE texturing.<br>
In the prior art, a) the process gases were fed to the plasma<br>
chamber without premixing leaving a room for non-uniformity of<br>
plasma precursors and b) the gas mixture was not uniformly<br><br>
delivered over the silicon wafers mounted on the carrier plate<br>
acting as a ground electrode.<br>
In the present invention the plasma etching process is carried out<br>
after premixing the etching gases and the gas mixture was uniformly<br>
distributed over the silicon wafers mounted on the carrier plate,<br>
using a showerhead electrode. Due to inclusion of these additional<br>
processes, it is possible to texture 20 silicon wafers of size upto<br>
156 mm sq. per batch.<br>
The objects of the present invention is to disclose a high<br>
throughput plasma texturing process capable of producing 20<br>
textured wafers per batch each of 156 mm sq. size with consistently<br>
uniform texturisation, low reflection and damage-free surface<br>
suitable for solar cell applications.<br>
The present invention discloses set of process parameters creating<br>
specific condition of self-masking due to in-situ formation of<br>
randomly absorbed polymer giving rise to selective etching of<br>
silicon, yielding least reflecting, uniformly textured wafers<br><br>
placed over the entire carrier. To reduce the etching damage of the<br>
silicon wafers, wafer carrier was grounded and hence process done<br>
in chemical etching dominated mode.<br>
Inventive feature of the present invention lies in:-<br>
Introduction of gas blending process resulting in an uniform<br>
mixture of process gases viz., SF6 and O2.<br>
Maintaining uniform flow of premixed gases over 20 silicon wafers<br>
each of 156 mm x 156 mm size, mounted on a SS carrier, by<br>
introducing a showerhead electrode coupled with the wafer carrier<br>
designed to exhaust the residual gases uniformly.<br>
Enhanced plasma stability and uniformity leading to uniform<br>
texturing and a throughput of 20 wafers per batch by introducing<br>
independent RF earthing system and excellent matching network.<br>
A combination of process parameters (given in detailed Technical<br>
write up) resulting in a product called, plasma textured silicon<br>
wafer (size: 125 mm sq. or 156 mm sq.) with reduced average<br><br>
reflectance ~ 8% forming an input to solar cell process exhibiting<br>
cell efficiency.<br>
For example, solar cells processed out of the plasma textured<br>
multicrystalline silicon wafers showed efficiency upto 15.6% and<br>
the improvement achieved in average efficiency of the solar cell is<br>
upto 1.5% higher compared to the one without plasma texturing.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION;<br>
The present invention discloses a novel, high throughput plasma<br>
etching process for texturing multicrystalline silicon wafers and<br>
its application in solar cell fabrication. The process was carried<br>
out in a custom designed multichamber plasma etching system.<br>
Features of the system resulting in novel high throughput plasma<br>
etching process include, uniform distribution of premixed gases to<br>
obtain uniform plasma over the entire wafer carrier (Size: ~0.7m2)<br>
by using showerhead electrode for gas distribution, grounding of<br>
the wafer carrier to minimize the sputter damage due to accelerated<br>
radicals/ions in the plasma, and use of PLC based SCADA automation<br>
system for process operation. Using optimum flow rates and ratio of<br>
SF6 and O2 etch precursors under the influence of 13.56 MHz RF power<br>
and combination of pressure-electrode gap, a reaction causing self-<br>
masking on the surface of mc-Si wafers was created to give random<br>
etching independent of crystal orientation. This random etching of<br>
silicon surface lead to wavelength scale nanostr.uctures (typical<br>
size: 150-200 nm) exhibiting enhanced light harvesting property.<br>
A number of process experimentation runs were carried out by<br>
varying critical process parameters for achieving optimum surface<br>
texturing of mc-Si wafers of size 125 mm sq. and 156 mm sq. The<br>
average reflectance measured was -8.4% on more than 100 textured<br>
wafers after carrying out damage removal etching (DRE) process.<br>
Theses plasma textured mc-Si wafers were processed for cells using<br>
standard manufacturing steps. Current-Voltage characteristics of<br>
the plasma textured cells under standard test conditions show<br>
highest conversion efficiency of 15.6% whereas that for cells<br>
without plasma texturing it was 13.9%, clearly showing an<br>
improvement of 1.7% absolute in efficiency.<br>

by this description.<br>
The present invention relates to development of a high throughput<br>
plasma etching process suitable for uniform texturing of 20 silicon<br>
wafers for use in high efficiency solar cell process. The process<br>
was carried out in a custom designed industrial three chamber<br>
plasma etching system comprising a process chamber and two load<br>
lock chambers placed on both sides of the process chamber to avoid<br>
possible contamination to wafers due to atmospheric or other<br>
exposure. Loading and unloading stations for wafer carrier were<br>
provided to facilitate the start up and completion of the process<br>
cycle.<br>

having essential accessories, like mass flow controllers (MFCs) for<br>
monitoring and maintaining the gas flow in the process chamber,<br>
customized gas blender for premixing of process gases, pressure<br>
gauges to monitor pressure of the process chamber and load-lock<br>
chambers to facilitate on-line transfer of wafer carrier across the<br>
vacuum chambers and their entry to and exit from the chambers,<br>
vacuum pumps for evacuating residual gases and reaction byproducts<br>
from the process chamber and equalization of chamber pressure<br>
during carrier transfer, custom designed showerhead electrode for<br>
effective uniform distribution of process gases across the entire<br>
wafer carrier, RF power supply and matching network for splitting<br>
the precursor gases into etch radicals and ions, 'o' ring sealed<br>
slit valves to avoid cross contamination within chambers and from<br>
outside environment, variable frequency drive (VFD) motors for<br>
transport of wafer carrier and PLC based process automation and<br>
SCADA monitoring system for process operation etc. are integrated<br>
with the system.<br>

damage removal, whereas in b) on right side: textured mc-Si wafers<br>
kept in the unloading station are shown. Fig.3. illustrates a view<br>
of process gas plasma (Sulphur Hexafluoride and Oxygen) in the<br>
process chamber.<br>
Process optimization runs for texturing silicon wafers of size up<br>
to 156 mm x 156 mm, were carried out, as per the design of<br>
experiments planned for the most critical set of process<br>
parameters, as given in the example of process parameters. The<br>
measurement of diffused reflection of these wafers (more than 100<br>
pcs.) showed an average reflectance of ~8.4%. Using these textured<br>
wafers the best cell efficiency of 15.6% was obtained in a batch of<br>
82 solar cells using conventional solar cells manufacturing steps.<br>
The details of the results achieved are given in Figs. 4, 5 and 6.<br>
Fig.4. gives a run chart for diffused reflectance of mc-Si wafers<br>
after plasma texturing and damage removal etching (DRE) process.<br>
Fig.5. illustrates a histogram of efficiency of the cells processed<br>
in the manufacturing line using wafers with and without plasma<br>
texturing. It can be observed that approximately 90% of the plasma<br>
textured cells are falling in 14-15% efficiency range - whereas<br>
7.3% cells are in 15-16% efficiency range. Fig.6. shows current-<br>
voltage characteristics of mc-Si solar cells with and without<br>
plasma texturing in a customized Plasma reactor. Fig.7. gives SEM<br>
micrographs of plasma textured sample Silicon wafers at different<br>
magnifications of a) 3,000X and b) 10,000X. Fig.8. gives a typical<br>
surface profile of the plasma textured wafer. Fig 9. shows quantum<br>
efficiency measurements of typical mc-Si solar cells with and<br>
without plasma texturing. It could be observed from QE curves that<br>
the plasma texturing has enhanced the long wavelength response of<br>
the solar cell due to passivation of defects near Aluminum BSF<br>
junction and light trapping on the rear of the cell. Fig.10<br>
exhibits photographs of solar cells: with (Left side) and without<br>
(Right side) plasma texturing.<br>
The texturing of silicon wafers through plasma etching process was<br>
carried out as shown in the flow chart of Fig. 14 and explained<br>
below.<br>
20 silicon wafers each 156mm x 156mm in size were mounted on a<br>
Stainless steel carrier after they were polished with an alkali<br>
solution with a concentration of 10-30% and at a temperature 70°-<br>
85°C. The process chamber was evacuated to a chamber pressure of<br>
150 to 300 m Torr and the gas mixture (SF6 and O2) was introduced in<br>
the chamber through Mass Flow Controllers (MFC) used for monitoring<br>
and control of gas flow in the process chamber. The gas mixture was<br>
uniformly distributed over the silicon wafers mounted on the<br>
carrier plate through a shower head electrode. Following this, the<br>
RF power (Radio Frequency Power) was switched on and maintained at<br>
a predetermined value. The showerhead electrode was capacitively<br>
coupled with the wafer carrier for striking plasma as well as<br>
designed to exhaust the residual gas uniformly. RF Power was<br>
switched off after a preset time and the chamber was purged with<br>
Nitrogen for a couple of minutes. The wafer carrier was transferred<br>
to the exit load lock chamber. From the load lock chamber wafer<br>
carrier was transferred to the unload station and then the textured<br>
wafers were unloaded in an etching basket. An etchant made up of<br>
HF-, HNO3 and H2O (2:48:50) was used at 8-15 Deg C temperature for<br>
damage removal etching. The textured wafers were dipped in the<br>
solution for 10-30 seconds, rinsed thoroughly in DM water and<br>
dried. The diffused reflectance of the textured wafers was measured<br>
and the wafers accepted if it was less than 10%.<br>
