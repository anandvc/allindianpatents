and to pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their salts are characterized by valuable therapeutic properties. It has been surprisingly found that the compounds of the present invention are antagonists of the Neurokinin 1 (NK-1, substance P) receptor. Substance P is a naturally occurring undecapeptide belonging to the tachykinin family of peptides, the latter being so-named because of their prompt contractile action on extravascular smooth muscle tissue. The receptor for substance P is a member of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors.<br>
The neuropeptide receptor for substance P (NK-1) is widely distributed throughout the mammalian nervous system (especially brain and spinal ganglia), the circulatory system and peripheral tissues (especially the duodenum and jejunum) and are involved in regulating a number of diverse biological processes.<br>
The central and peripheral actions of the mammalian tachykinin substance P have been associated with numerous inflammatory conditions including migraine, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease as well as mediation of the emetic reflex and the modulation of central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as Parkinson's disease (Neurosci. Res., 1996, 7,187-214), anxiety (Can. J. Phys., 1997, 75, 612-621) and depression (Science, 1998, 281,1640-1645).<br>
Evidence for the usefulness of tachykinin receptor antagonists in pain, headache, especially migraine, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, attenuation of morphine withdrawal, cardiovascular changes, oedema, such as oedema caused by thermal injury, chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma/bronchial hyper reactivity and other respiratory diseases including allergic rhinitis, inflammatory diseases of the gut including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, ocular injury and ocular inflammatory diseases reviewed in "Tachykinin Receptor and Tachykinin Receptor Antagonists", J. Auton. Pharmacol., 13,23-93,1993.<br>
Furthermore, Neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists are being developed for the treatment of a number of physiological disorders associated with an excess or imbalance of tachykinin, in particular substance P. Examples of conditions in which substance P has been implicated include disorders of the central nervous system such as anxiety, depression and psychosis (WO 95/16679, WO 95/18124 and WO 95/23798).<br>
The neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists are further useful for the treatment of motion sickness and for treatment induced vomiting.<br><br>
In addition, in The New England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 340, No. 3 190-195,1999 has been described the reduction of cisplatin-induced emesis by a selective neurokinin-1-receptor antagonist.<br>
Furthermore, US 5,972,938 describes a method for treating a psychoimmunologic or a psychosomatic disorder by administration of a tachykinin receptor, such as NK-1 receptor antagonist.<br>
The usefulness of neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists for the treatment of certain forms of urinary incontinence is further described in "Neuropeptides, 32(1), 1-49, (1998)" and "Eur. J. Pharmacol., 383(3), 297-303, (1999)".<br>
Life Sci., (2000), 67(9), 985-1001 describes, that astrocytes express functional receptors to numerous neurotransmitters including substance P, which is an important stimulus for reactive astrocytes in CNS development, infection and injury. In brain tumors malignant gill cells originating from astrocytes are triggered by tachykinins via NK-1 receptors to release soluble mediators and to increase their proliferative rate. Therefore, selective NK-1 receptor antagonists maybe useful as a therapeutic approach to treat malignant gliomas in the treatment of cancer.<br>
In Nature (London) (2000), 405(6783), 180-183 is described that mice with a genetic disruption of NK-1 receptor show a loss of the rewarding properties of morphine. Consequently NK-1 receptor antagonists maybe useful in the treatment of withdrawel symptoms of addictive drugs such as opiates and nicotine and reduction of their abuse/craving.<br>
NKl receptor antagonists have been reported to have also a beneficial effect in the therapy of traumatic brain injury (oral disclosure by Prof. Nimmo at the International Tachykinin Conference 2000 in La Grande Motte, France, October 17-20,2000 with the title "Neurokinin 1 (NK-1) Receptor Antagonists Improve the Neurological Outcome Following Traumatic Brain Injury" (Authors: A.J. Nimmo, C.J. Bennett, X.Hu, I. Cernak, R. Vink).<br>
The compounds of the present invention are further useful for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is common in older men. BPH can be progressive and lead to urinary retention, infections, bladder calculi and renal failure. This indication has been reported in EP 01109853.0.<br>
The compounds of formula I can also be used in the form of their prodrugs, for example in form of their N-oxides. The prodrugs may add to the value of the present<br><br>
compounds advantages in adsorption, pharmacokinetics in distribution and transport to the brain.<br>

As mentioned earlier, the compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically usable addition salts possess valuable pharmacological properties. It has been found that the compounds of the present invention are antagonists of the Neurokinin 1 (NK-1, substance P) receptor.<br>
The compounds were investigated in accordance with the tests given hereinafter.<br><br>
The affinity of test compounds for the NKi receptor was evaluated at human NKi receptors in CHO cells infected with the human NKi receptor (using the Semliki virus expression system) and radiolabelled with [‘H]substance P (final concentration 0.6 nM). Binding assays were performed in HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) containing BSA (0.04 %) leupeptin (8 fig / ml), MgClz (3mM) and phosphoramidon (2 p-M). Binding assays consisted of 250 jil of membrane suspension (1.25x10’ cells / assay tube), 0.125 |al of buffer of displacing agent and 125 |j.l of [‘H] substance P. Displacement curves were determined with at least seven concentrations of the compound. The assay tubes were incubated for 60 min at room temperature after which time the tube contents were rapidly filtered under vacuum through GF/C filters presoaked for 60 min with PEI (0.3%) with 2 x 2 ml washes of HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4). The radioactivity retained on the filters was measured by scintillation counting. All assays were performed in trifurcate in at least 2 separate experiments.<br>
The affinity to the NK-1 receptor, given as pKi, is in the scope of 6.00 - 9.38 for the described compounds.<br>
Examples of the pKi data for such compounds are described in the table below:<br><br><br><br>
J<br>
The compounds of formula I as well as their pharmaceutically usable acid addition salts can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. The administration can, however, also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically usable acid addition salts can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic excipients for the production of tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts etc can be used as such excipients e.g. for tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules.<br>
Suitable excipients for soft gelatine capsules are e.g. vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi¬solid and liquid polyols etc.<br>
Suitable excipients for the manufacture of solutions and syrups are e.g. water, polyols, saccharide, invert sugar, glucose etc.<br>
Suitable excipients for injection solutions are e.g. water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils etc.<br>
Suitable excipients for suppositories are e.g. natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols etc.<br>
Moreover, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stationers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorings, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, in the case of oral administration a daily<br><br>
dosage of about 10 to 1000 mg per person of a compound of general formula I should be appropriate, although the above upper limit can also be exceeded when necessary.<br>
The following Examples illustrate the present invention without limiting it. All temperatures are given in degrees Celsius.<br>
Example 1 2-Methylsulfanyl-4-o-tolyloxy-pyrimidine-5-carboxylicacid(3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl-<br>
benzyl)-methyl-amide<br>
