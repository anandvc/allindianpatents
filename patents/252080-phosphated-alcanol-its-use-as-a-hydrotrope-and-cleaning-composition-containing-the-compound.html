				<td>The present invention relates to the use of phosphated 2-propylheptanol or a<br>
phosphated 2-propylheptanol alkoxylate as a hydrotrope in aqueous alkaline<br>
solutions for a C8-C18-alcohol alkoxylate containing 1-20 ethyleneoxy units. It<br>
also relates to a phosphated 2-propylheptanol alkoxylate per se and an alkaline<br>
cleaning composition comprising phosphated 2-propylheptanol and/or a<br>
phosphated 2-propylheptanol alkoxylate as a hydrotrope.<br>
The ability of an aqueous solution to spread evenly over a surface, the so-called<br>
wetting ability, is important for nnany applications. For example, a composition<br>
for the cleaning of hard surfaces benefits from a good wetting of the surface.<br>
Good wetting is also desirable for laundry as well as for scouring and<br>
mercerizing processes. Nonionic surfactants are known to be good wetting<br>
agents, and are often present in compositions for the cleaning of hard surfaces.<br>
Most often the hard surface cleaning composition also contains alkaline<br>
components. Many nonionic surfactants are not soluble enough in solutions with.<br>
a high amount of electrolytes, such as alkali and/or alkaline complexing agents,<br>
and therefore need the presence of a hydrotrope to improve the solubility. A<br>
number of hydrotropes for nonionic surfactants have been described in various<br>
publications. Examples of such hydrotropes are ethanol, sodium xylene<br>
sulphonate, sodium cumene sulphonate, alkyl glycosides, and phosphated<br>
alkoxylated alcohols.<br>
In US 5 145 597 alkaline cleaners useful in the cleaning of mechanical<br>
equipment are described. These alkaline cleaners include a phosphate ester<br>
hydrotrope and a nonionic surfactant, but in the working example it is not<br>
specified which phosphate ester is used.<br>
US 4 493 782 describes a cleansing composition containing an ethoxylated<br>
phosphate ester derived from an alcohol with between 8 and 12 carbon atoms<br><br>
in the alkyl chain, which alcohol has been ethoxylated with 2-4 moles of<br>
ethylene oxide (EO). This phosphate ester is combined with another phosphate<br>
ester prepared from butanol + 2 EO, where the latter phosphate ester is added<br>
to stabilise the formulation.<br>
US 4 137190 discloses a detergent composition comprising a nonionic<br>
surfactant and a synergistic hydrotrope mixture. In the working examples use is<br>
made of a combination of P2O5 phosphated phenol + 6 EO and PPA<br>
phosphated butanol + 1 EO or PPA phosphated isoamyl alcohol + 4 EO.<br>
US 3 294 693 discloses hydrotropes for solubilising polyethylene oxide nonionic<br>
surfactants into builder solutions. The hydrotropes are surface-active materials<br>
which contain upwards of Â£55% primary phosphate esters. These esters are<br>
formed by the reaction between PPA and an ethoxylated C6 to C10 alkyl phenol<br>
or an ethoxylated C10 to C18 alcohol with 1-20 moles of EO. In all the working<br>
examples phosphated octylphenol ethoxylates were used.<br>
BE 632 444 relates to alkaline detergents comprising surface-active nonionic<br>
polyethylene oxide adducts, obtained by the addition of ethylene oxide to an<br>
alcohol, an alkylamine or an alkylphenol, and a hydrotrope which is a phosphate<br>
of an alkoxylated alkylphenol having 6-10 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, or a<br>
phosphate of an alkoxylated alcohol having 10-18 carbon atoms in the alkyl<br>
chain, and where the hydrotropic material contains 90% primary phosphate<br>
esters. In the working examples several phosphated alkoxylated alkylphenols<br>
were used as hydrotropes, as well as phosphated dodecylalcohol + 15 EO and<br>
phosphated stearylalcohol + 7.5 EO, to solubilise octylphenol + 10 EO.<br>
Orthophosphoric acid esters produced from alcohols that have been<br>
ethoxylated with up to 10, preferably 5, moles of ethylene oxide are disclosed in<br>
EP-A-256427 as dispersants for pigments. 2-Propylheptanol is among the<br>
alcohols mentioned.<br><br>
Alkali metal salts of mono- and dliesters of orthophosphoric acid, produced from<br>
a number of alcohols, are disclosed in CH-A-481953 as surface-active agents<br>
used in a process for making a stable latex by emulsion polymerisation of<br>
vinylhalide monomers. Propylheptyl is mentioned as one possible alkyl<br>
substituent in these phosphates.<br>
However, there is still a need for new efficient hydrotropes that are suitable for<br>
certain compositions, since not all hydrotropes and nonionics are compatible for<br>
the achievement of clear, stable solutions and an optimal performance in the<br>
application at hand. Especially, in some cases alkaline solutions containing a<br>
nonionic surfactant obtained from an alkyl-branched alkoxylated alcohol and a<br>
hydrotrope will separate upon dilution. An example of such alcohol alkoxyiates<br>
are 2-propylheptanol alkoxyiates, where tests have shown that clear and<br>
homogeneous, alkaline concentrates, containing alkylene oxide adducts of 2-<br>
propylheptanol, and hexyl glucoside and/or an octyliminodipropionate as a<br>
hydrotrope, will become hazy or separate when they are diluted to make ready-<br>
to-use solutions.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to find a new hydrotrope that is efficient in<br>
making clear homogeneous concentrated alkaline compositions containing C8-<br>
C18-alcohol alkoxyiates comprising 1-20 ethyleneoxy units, especially 2-<br>
propylheptanol alkoxyiates, which compositions will remain homogeneous upon<br>
dilution, and where the cleaning performance of the compositions is good.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that phosphated 2-propylheptanol or a<br>
phosphated 2-propylheptanol alkoxylate where the alkoxylate on the average<br>
comprises 1-20, preferably 2-10, more preferably 2-6, even more preferably 2-4,<br>
and most preferably 3, ethyleneoxy units and 0-3, preferably 0-2, propyleneoxy<br>
and/or butyleneoxy, preferably propyleneoxy, units, is an efficient hydrotrope in<br>
an alkaline aqueous solution for C8 - C18, preferably C8- C12, alcohol<br>
alkoxyiates containing 1-20, preferably 1-8, and most preferably 2-7<br><br>
ethyleneoxy units and 0-3, preferably 0-2 propyleneoxy units, preferably for 2-<br>
propylheptanol alkoxylates according to the formula<br>
  (1)<br>
where PO is a propyieneoxy group, EO is an ethyleneoxy group, a is a number<br>
0-3, and b is a number 1-8.<br>
The invention further relates to aqueous cleaning solutions comprising<br>
a)	0.2-20%, preferably 2-10%, by weight of a C8 - C18, preferably C8 - C12,<br>
alcohol alkoxylate containing 1-20, preferably 1-8, and most preferably 2-7,<br>
ethyleneoxy units, preferably a 2-propylheptanol alkoxylate having the formula<br>
  (I)<br>
where EO, PO, a, and b have the same meaning as above<br>
b)	0.1-30, preferably 0.1-20, and most preferably 0.1-10% by weight of<br>
phosphated 2-propylheptanol and/or a phosphated 2-propylheptanol alkoxylate,<br>
where the alkoxylate on average comprises 1-20, preferably 2-10, more<br>
preferably 2-6, even more preferably 2-4, and most preferably 3, ethyleneoxy<br>
units and 0-3, preferably 0-2, propyieneoxy units, preferably a phosphated<br>
alkoxylate according to the formula<br><br>
where M is H, a monovalent metal ion or R1R2R3R4N+, where R1, R2, R3, and R4<br>
are H, an alkyl group with 1-4 carbon atoms or-CH2CH20H, and c is a number<br>
1-20, preferably 2-10, more preferably 2-6, even more preferably 2-4, and most<br>
preferably 3, and<br>
c)	0.05-40, preferably 0.05-30, more preferably 0.05-20, and most preferably<br>
0.05-15% by weight of an alkali hydroxide and/or alkaline complexing agents;<br>
which are homogeneous and stable, also upon dilution. The cleaning<br>
performance of these solutions is also very good.<br><br>
Phosphated 2-propyIheptanoI or a phosphated 2-propyiheptanol alkoxylate may<br>
be obtained by different processes, the most common being the reaction of 2-<br>
propylheptanol or alkoxyiated 2-propylheptanol with polyphosphoric acid or<br>
phosphorous pentoxide (P2O5).<br>
In the process using polyphosphoric acid the resulting product mixture will<br>
predominantly contain the monoalkylphosphate ester of 2-propylheptanol or of<br>
alkoxyiated 2-propylheptanol and only a small amount (
dialkylphosphate ester. Always rather large amounts of inorganic phosphate<br>
residues from the polyphosphoric acid, such as orthophosphoric acid, will be<br>
present.<br>
When P2O5 is used as the phosphatising reagent and the molar ratio between<br>
P205 and alcohol or alkoxyiated alcohol is 1:3, the product mixture will contain<br>
about equal amounts of monoalkylphosphate ester and dialkylphosphate ester,<br>
and only smaller amounts of inorganic phosphate residues. A larger amount of<br>
alcohol or alkoxyiated alcohol will yield more diester, and a smaller amount will<br>
yield more monoester. It will be known to a person skilled in the art how to<br>
synthesise phosphate esters with certain amounts of mono- and dialkyl<br>
phosphate esters. For a general description of phosphate esters see, e.g.,<br>
Anionic Surfactants Vol. 7, Part II, pages 504-511 in Surfactant Science Series,<br>
edited by Warner M. Linfield, Marcel Dekker Inc., New York and Basle 1976.<br>
The alcohol alkoxylates to be phosphated may be either of the standard type<br>
produced by using an alkaline catalyst such as KOH, or of the narrow range<br>
type produced by using a narrow range catalyst, such as an acid catalyst,<br>
Ca(OH)2 or hydrotalcite.<br>
Normally the reaction mixture resulting from either of the procedures will be<br>
neutralised by an organic or inorganic base before use. The base may be, e.g.,<br>
an alkali hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide;<br><br>
ammonia, an alkanolamine, such as monoethanolamine, triethanolamine or<br>
methyldiethanolamine; or an alkylamine such as triethylamine.<br>
The monoalkylphosphate ester of 2-propylheptanol or of ethoxylated 2-<br>
propylheptanol has the formula<br><br>
where M is H, a monovalent metal ion or R1R2R3R4N+, where R1, R2, R3, and R4<br>
are H, an alkyl group with 1-4 carbon atoms or-CH2CH2OH, and c is a number<br>
0-20, preferably 2-10, more preferably 2-6, even more preferably 2-4, and most<br>
preferably 3. The product mixture resulting from the reaction of 2-propylheptanol<br>
or of ethoxylated 2-propylheptanol with polyphosphoric acid may also contain<br>
smaller amounts of products containing more than one phosphate unit<br>
according to the formula<br><br>
where n is 1-3 and M and c have the same meaning as above.<br>
For ethoxylates containing smaller amounts of ethyleneoxy units, also a certain<br>
amount of unethoxylated product will remain due to the distribution of<br>
ethyleneoxy units. This unethoxylated product will also be phosphatised during<br>
the reaction with the phosphatising agent, and thus the phosphate ester of 2-<br>
propylheptanol will also be present in the reaction mixture resulting from these<br>
above-mentioned ethoxylates. <br>
The dialkylphosphate ester of 2-propylheptanol has the formula<br><br><br>
where M and c have the same meaning as above. The product mixture resulting<br>
from the reaction of 2-propylheptanol or ethoxylated 2-propyIheptanol with P205<br>
may also contain a dialkyl diphosphate ester according to the formula<br><br>
where M and c have the same meaning as above. This type of diester may be<br>
hydrolysed to yield 2 moles of monoester.<br>
2-Propylheptanol is normally made by a process resulting in small amounts of<br>
by-products such as 4-methyl-2-propylhexanol and 5-methyl-2-propylhexanol.<br>
These products or their ethoxylates will also be phosphated during the process,<br>
and the phosphated species will be comprised in the resulting product mixture.<br>
The reaction mixtures obtained by the phosphatising procedures are normally<br>
used as such without any purification procedure, but both the mixtures and the<br>
purified phosphate esters function as hydrotropes. To act as a good hydrotrope,<br>
the mixture should predominantly contain the monoalkyl phosphate esters,<br>
since these are better hydrotropes than the dialkyl phosphate esters. Preferably<br>
more than 60, more preferably more than 70, and most preferably more than<br>
80% by weight of the mixture should be monoalkyl phosphate esters,.<br>
The phosphated 2-propylheptanol or phosphated 2-propylheptanol alkoxylates<br>
where the alkoxylate on average comprises 1-20, preferably 2-10, more<br>
preferably 2-6, even more preferably 2-4, and most preferably 3, ethyleneoxy<br>
units and 0-3, preferably 0-2, propyleneoxy and/or butyleneoxy, preferably<br>
propyleneoxy, units described above and a process for their production are<br>
already partly disclosed in the earlier mentioned publications EP-A-256427 and<br>
CH-A-481953 for use as dispersants for pigments and as additives in an<br>
emulsion polymerisation process, respectively. However, the phosphated 2-<br>
propylheptanol alkoxylate where the alkoxylate comprises 2-4, preferably 3,<br><br>
ethyleneoxy units on average is especially efficient as a hydrotrope compared<br>
to the other phosphated alkoxylates of 2-propylheptano! (see Table 1 in the<br>
Examples). Therefore, the invention aiso relates to the phosphated 2-<br>
propylheptanol alkoxylate where the alkoxylate on average comprises 2-4,<br>
preferably 3, ethyleneoxy units per se and a process for its production.<br>
The C8âC18-alcohol alkoxylates may, in addition to the 1-20 ethyleneoxy units,<br>
also contain 1-3 alkyleneoxy units with 3-4 carbon atoms. The ethyleneoxy units<br>
and the propyleneoxy and/or butyleneoxy units may be added randomly or in<br>
blocks. The blocks may be added to the alcohol in any order. The alkoxylates<br>
may also contain an alkyl group with 1-4 carbon atoms in the end position.<br>
Preferably, the alkoxylates contain 2-7 ethyleneoxy units and 0-2 propyleneoxy<br>
and/or butyleneoxy units.<br>
A suitable alkoxylate to be used in the cleaning composition for the cleaning of<br>
hard surfaces has the formula <br>
CH3(CH2)4CHCH20(PO)a(EO)bH	(I)<br>
I<br>
C3H7<br>
where PO is a propyleneoxy group, EO is an ethyleneoxy group, a is a number<br>
0-3, preferably 0-2, and b is a number 1-8, preferably 2-7, and most preferably<br>
3-6. When the 2-propylheptanol contains the by-products mentioned above,<br>
these will also be alkoxylated and comprised in the resulting product mixture.<br>
The cleaning concentrates obtained by using the phosphated 2-propylheptanol<br>
alkoxylates as hydrotropes for the 2-propylheptanol alkoxylates are clear and<br>
stable, also upon dilution, and cleaning compositions with these components<br>
exhibit a good cleaning performance.<br>
When the cleaning composition is to be used for textile applications, such as for<br>
laundry, then the alkoxylate a) should preferably comprise an amount of<br>
ethyleneoxy units in the upper part of the range 1-20, for example 7-15 moles of<br>
EO per mole of C8-C18-alcohol.<br><br>
The alkali hydroxide in the composition preferably is sodium or potassium<br>
hydroxide. The alkaline complexing agent may be inorganic as well as organic.<br>
Typical examples of inorganic complexing agents used in the alkaline<br>
composition are alkali salts of silicates and phosphates such as sodium silicate,<br>
sodium metasilicate, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium orthophosphate, sodium<br>
pyrophosphate, and the corresponding potassium salts. Typical examples of<br>
organic complexing agents are alkaline aminopolyphosphonates, organic<br>
phosphates, polycarboxylates, such as citrates; aminocarboxylates, such as<br>
sodium nitriiotriacetate (Na3NTA), sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA),<br>
sodium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate, sodium 1,3-propylenediamine-<br>
tetraacetate, and sodium hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetate. The amount of<br>
alkali present in the composition depends on the application and on whether the<br>
composition is a concentrate or a ready-to-use solution. Some applications use<br>
highly alkaline solutions; for example for scouring, the alkali concentration is c.<br>
4-6% by weight when using NaOH, and for mercerization, a ca. 20-26% by<br>
weight caustic soda solution is used. A concentrate composition for vehicle<br>
cleaning normally contains 6% to 15% by weight alkali and/or alkaline<br>
complexing agents, and the ready-to-use solution normally contains 0.2 to 5%<br>
by weight. For laundry, the amount of alkali and/or alkaline complexing agents<br>
is lower and normally amounts to 3 to 10% by weight in the concentrate and 0.1<br>
to 1% by weight in the ready-to-use solution.<br>
The concentrated compositions of the present invention are clear and stable.<br>
The clarity interval is suitably between 0-40Â°C, preferably between 0-50Â°C, and<br>
most preferably between 0-60Â°C. This may be adapted by changing the ratio of<br>
hydrotrope to nonionic surfactant. The concentrate normally contains 50-95%<br>
by weight of water, suitably 70-90% by weight.<br>
To obtain a ready-to-use solution the concentrates are diluted with water up to<br>
1:40. The diluted solutions are also clear and stable, but in some cases they<br>
may turn a little bit hazy although they are still stable and do not separate. The<br><br>
ready-to-use solutions exhibit good cleaning properties. A typical concentrate<br>
formulation for vehicle cleaning contains 3-5% by weight of a), 3-5% by weight<br>
of b), and 5-10% by weight of c), and a ready-to-use formulation would normally<br>
contain 0.2-1% by weight of a), 0.2-1% by weight of b), and 0.5-1% by weight of<br>
c).<br>
The present invention is further illustrated by the following Examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
Formulations were made containing:<br>
5% by weight of a nonionic surfactant<br>
10% by weight of Na3NTA (sodium nitrilotriacetate)<br>
X% by weight of hydrotrope<br>
Balance water<br>
The hydrotrope was added in such an amount that the solution exhibited the<br>
clarity interval stated in Table 2. All percentages are by weight.<br><br><br>
To evaluate the cleaning efficiency of the formulations in Table 1 the following<br>
cleaning test was used: White painted plates were smeared with an oil-soot<br>
mixture obtained from diesel engines. 25 ml of the test solutions, in this case<br>
the formulations in Table 1 diluted 1:20, were poured onto the top of the oil-<br>
smeared plates and left there for one minute. The plates were then rinsed off<br>
with a rich flow of water. All solutions and the water were kept at a temperature<br>
of about 15 - 20Â°C. All reference solutions were placed on the same plate as the<br>
test solutions. The cleaning ability was measured with a Minolta Chroma Meter<br>
CR-200 reflectometer, and the result is presented as the % soil removal. The<br>
results are collected in Table 2.<br><br>
The formulations containing phosphated 2-propylheptanol or phosphated 2-<br>
propylheptanol ethoxylates as a hydrotrope exhibited a better cleaning<br>
performance than the comparison formulation containing coco fatty amine + 17<br>
EO quaternised with CH3CI. There are two values for the comparison<br>
compound, since the cleaning efficiency was tested on two separate plates; one<br>
with l, II, lll, and IV and the other with V, VI, VII, and IV.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
This example relates to a comparison between phosphated 2-propylheptanol +<br>
5 EO and phosphated hexanol + 5 EO as hydrotropes for 2-propylheptanol + 5<br>
EO.<br><br>
A smaller amount of phosphated 2-propylheptanol+5EO, as compared to<br>
phosphated hexanol+5EO, was required to obtain a clarity interval of 0-600C.<br>
The formulations with phosphated 2-propylheptanol + 5 EO as a hydrotrope<br>
exhibited about the same cleaning efficiency as the formulations with<br>
phosphated hexanol + 5 EO, but the former were much more stable when<br>
diluted than the latter.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
This example compares a number of phosphated ethoxylated alcohols with<br>
phosphated 2-propylheptanol + 5 EO as a hydrotrope for 2-propylheptanol + 5<br>
EO.<br><br><br>
The formulation according to the invention exhibited the best cleaning<br>
performance of all the investigated formulations, in combination with a good<br>
stability upon dilution.<br>
Example 4<br>
Table 7 displays formulations where the same amount of hydrotrope was added<br>
to all formulations. The cleaning efficiency of the different formulations is shown<br>
in Table 8.<br><br><br><br>
The formulations according to the invention are more efficient than the<br>
comparison formulations.<br>
Example 5<br>
In this example phosphated 2-propylheptanol + 5 EO was added as a<br>
hydrotrope to a number of nonionic surfactants, and the formulations were<br>
tested for their cleaning efficiency.<br><br><br><br>
The results show that phosphated 2-propylheptanol + 5 EO also works as a<br>
hydrotrope for other nonionics than 2-propyiheptanol alkoxylates, and that the<br>
cleaning efficiency for these formulations in general is good.<br>
Example 6<br>
In this example the wetting ability of a composition according to the invention<br>
was measured by the modified Drave's test.<br><br>
In the modified Drave's test, the sinking time in s is measured for a specified<br>
cotton yarn in approximately 0.1% surfactant solution. The formulation in the<br>
Table above was diluted with distilled water to 0.1% by weight with respect to<br>
the C9-C11-alcohol + 4 EO, and the modified Drave's test was performed on this<br>
solution. The result is displayed in the Table below.<br><br><br>
The formulation containing the phosphated 2-propylheptanol + 5 EO as a<br>
hydrotrope for the ethoxylate had a good wetting ability, whereas for the<br>
different components alone, the wetting time was &gt;420 s. The C9-C11-alcohol is<br>
not soluble in this alkaline medium without a hydrotrope, and the phosphated 2-<br>
propylheptanol + 5 EO has no good wetting ability on its own. When the<br>
hydrotrope is added, the nonionic surfactant is solubilised, and it is then able to<br>
exert its wetting ability.<br>
Example 7<br>
In the syntheses described below a 1,000 cm3 flange flask equipped with an<br>
anchor stirrer was used. The reactor was heated by an electrical heater<br>
equipped with a thermostat. A slight flow of nitrogen was applied during the<br>
reaction. The poiyphosphoric acid (PPA) used was Polyphosphoric acid 116,<br>
84% equivalent in P205 (Albright &amp; Wilson).<br>
1)	2-propylheptanol + PPA<br>
2-propylheptanol (222.47 g, 1.41 mole) was charged and heated to 45Â°C. PPA<br>
(254.09 g) was added from a 60 mi syringe and the exothermic reaction was<br>
kept at 55-70Â°C while stirring at 240 r/min. PPA was added during a period of 1<br>
hour. The reaction was then left for 2 h at 60Â°C and with stirring at 300 r/min.<br>
After the post-reaction water (5.0 g) was added to hydrolyse the remaining PPA,<br>
after which the acid was neutralised: with KOH (274.4 g) dissolved in 555.0 g<br>
water.<br>
2)	2-propylheptanol + 3 EO +PPA<br>
2-propylheptanol +3 EO (295.63 g, 1.02 mole) was charged and heated to<br>
45Â°C. PPA (184.95 g) was added from a 60 ml syringe and the exothermic<br>
reaction was kept at 55-70Â°C while stirring at 240 r/min. PPA was added during<br>
a period of 1 hour. The reaction was then left for 2 h at 60Â°C and with stirring at<br>
300 r/min. After the post-reaction water (5.0 g) was added to hydrolyse the<br>
remaining PPA3 after which the acid was neutralised with KOH (191 g)<br>
dissolved in 454 g water.<br><br>
3) 2-propyIheptanoI + 5 EO + PPA<br>
2-propylheptanol + 5 EO (307.71 g, 0.81 mole) was charged and heated to<br>
45Â°C. PPA (148 g) was added from a 60 ml syringe and the exothermic reaction<br>
was kept at 55-70Â°C while stirring at 240 r/min. PPA was added during a period<br>
of 1 hour. The reaction was then left for 2 h at 60Â°C and with stirring at 300<br>
r/min. After the post reaction water (5.0 g) was added to hydrolyse the<br>
remaining PPA, after which 374.02 g acid were neutralised with KOH (132.37 g)<br>
dissolved in 517 g water.<br><br>
