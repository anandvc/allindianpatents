				<td>Cyclopropyl Amines as Modulators of the Histamine H3 Receptor<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a series of cyclopropyl amines, their<br>
synthesis, and methods for using them to treat disorders and conditions in<br>
which the histamine H3 receptor is involved. As a consequence of these<br>
activities, the compounds of the present invention will have therapeutic utility<br>
for the treatment of a variety of CNS related disorders including, but not limited<br>
to, narcolepsy, sleep disorders, obesity, neurodegenerative disorders, cognitive<br>
disorders, and hyperactivity disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Histamine {2-(imidazol-4-yl)ethylamine} is a biologically-active molecule.<br>
Histamine exerts a physiological effect via multiple distinct G-protein coupled<br>
receptors. The histamine H3 receptor was first described as a presynaptic<br>
autoreceptor in the central nervous system (CNS) (Arrang, J.-M. et al., Nature<br>
1983, 302, 832-837) controlling the synthesis and release of histamine.<br>
Evidence has emerged showing that H3 receptors are also located<br>
presynaptically as heteroreceptors on serotonergic, noradrenergic,<br>
dopaminergic, cholinergic, and GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric acid<br>
containing) neurons. These H3 receptors have also recently been identified in<br>
peripheral tissues such as vascular smooth muscle. Consequently, there are<br>
many potential therapeutic applications for histamine H3 agonists, antagonists,<br>
and inverse agonists. (See: "The Histamine H3 Receptor-A Target for New<br>
Drugs", Leurs, R. and Timmerman, H., (Eds.), Elsevier, 1998; Morisset, S. et<br>
al., Nature 2000, 408, 860-864.)<br>
Several indications for histamine H3 antagonists and inverse agonists<br>
have similarly been proposed based on animal pharmacology and other<br>
experiments with known histamine H3 antagonists (e.g. thioperamide). These<br>
include dementia, Alzheimer's disease (Panula, P. et al., Soc. Neurosci. Abstr.<br>
1995, 21, 1977), epilepsy (Yokoyama, H. et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993, 234,<br>
129-133), narcolepsy, with or without associated cataplexy, cataplexy,<br><br>
disorders of sleep/wake homeostasis, idiopathic somnolence, excessive<br>
daytime sleepiness (EDS), circadian rhythm disorders, sleep/fatigue disorders,<br>
fatigue, drowsiness associated with sleep apnea, sleep impairment due to<br>
perimenopausal hormonal shifts, jet lag, Parkinson's-related fatigue, multiple<br>
sclerosis (MS)-related fatigue, depression-related fatigue, chemotherapy-<br>
induced fatigue, eating disorders (Machidori, H. et al., Brain Res. 1992, 590,<br>
180-186), motion sickness, vertigo, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders<br>
(ADHD), learning and memory (Barnes, J.C. et al., Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1993,<br>
19,1813), and schizophrenia (Schlicker, E. and Marr, I., Naunyn-<br>
Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1996, 353, 290-294). (Also see: Stark, H.<br>
et al., Drugs Future 1996, 21(5), 507-520; and Leurs, R. et al., Prog. Drug Res.<br>
1995, 45, 107-165 and references cited therein.) Histamine H3 antagonists,<br>
alone or in combination with a histamine H1 antagonist, are reported to be<br>
useful for the treatment of upper airway allergic responses (U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,217,986; 5,352,707 and 5,869,479). A more recent review of this topic was<br>
presented by Tozer and Kalindjian (Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents 2000,10,1045).<br>
For additional reviews, see: Celanire, S. Drug Discovery Today 2005,<br>
10(23/24), 1613-1627; Hancock, A.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006, 71, 1103-<br>
1113.<br>
The compounds of the present invention display potency at the human<br>
H3 receptor as determined by receptor binding to the human histamine H3<br>
receptor (see Lovenberg, T.W. et al., Mol. Pharmacol. 1999, 55, 1101-1107).<br>
Screening using the human receptor is particularly important for the<br>
identification of new therapies for the treatment of human disease.<br>
Conventional binding assays, for example, are determined using rat<br>
synaptosomes (Garbarg, M. et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992, 263(1), 304-<br>
310), rat cortical membranes (West, R.E. et ai., Mol. Pharmacol. 1990, 38,<br>
610-613), and guinea pig brain (Korte, A. et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res.<br>
Commun. 1990, 168(3), 979-986). Only limited studies have been performed<br>
previously using human tissue or the human receptor, but these indicate<br>
significant differences in the pharmacology of rodent and primate receptors<br>
(West, R.E. et al. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999, 377, 233-239; Ireland, D. et al.<br>
Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001, 433, 141-150).<br><br>
To achieve a desired pharmacological effect, a compound must display<br>
potency against the biological target, as well as a suitable pharmacokinetic<br>
profile. First, the compound must be able to travel to its site of action, whether<br>
in the CNS, requiring adequate permeation of the blood-brain barrier, or in the<br>
periphery. Absorption through various biological membranes is dependent on<br>
the physical properties of the drug (degree of ionization at physiological pH,<br>
partition coefficient, molecular size, among other factors). Once the desired<br>
pharmacological effect is produced, a drug must be elimated from the<br>
organism at a suitable rate. Where an elimination process is too slow, an<br>
accumulation of the drug can occur, potentially causing undesirable side<br>
effects.<br>
Various H3-mediated diseases may require compounds with distinct and<br>
different pharmacokinetic profiles. In particular, administration of a compound<br>
with a short half-life provides greater control over exposure and duration of<br>
action of the drug, which may be advantageous in treating or preventing a<br>
particular disease or condition. A compound with such an optimized profile<br>
allows for the use of tailored formulations, dosing regimens, and/or delivery<br>
strategies to accomplish these results. For example, a compound with an<br>
attenuated pharmacokinetic profile may produce a shorter pharmacodynamic<br>
effect, which may be preferable in treating certain disease states. In contrast,<br>
a compound with a long half-life may be preferred for conditions in which<br>
constant occupancy of the target by the drug, with no or only very minor<br>
changes in drug concentration, are desireable.<br>
Various piperazinyl benzamides were disclosed in U.S. Patent Appl.<br>
Publication No. US-2004-0110746-A1 (June 10, 2004), which is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
The features and advantages of the invention are apparent to one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art. Based on this disclosure, including the summary,<br>
detailed description, background, examples, and claims, one of ordinary skill in<br>
the art will be able to make modifications and adaptations to various conditions<br>
and usages. Publications described herein are incorporated by reference in<br>
their entirety.<br><br>
Described herein is a series of N-cyclopropyl amine compounds with the<br>
ability to modulate the activity of the histamine receptor, specifically the H3<br>
receptor.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention features a compound selected from the group consisting<br>
of: (4-cyclopropyl-piperazin-1-yl)-(4-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-phenyl)-methanone,<br>
(4-cyclopropyl-piperazin-1-yl)-[4-(4-fluoro-piperidin-1-ylmethyl)-phenyl]-<br>
methanone, (4-cyclopropyl-piperazin-1-yl)-(4-thiomorpholin-4-ylmethyl-phenyl)-<br>
metharione, and (4-cyclopropyl-piperazin-1 -yl)-[4-(2-hydroxymethyl-morpholin-<br>
4-ylmethyl)-phenyl]-methanone, and enantiomers, hydrates, solvates, and<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
In particular embodiments, the compound is (4-cyclopropyl-piperazin-1-<br>
yl)-(4-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-phenyl)-methanone citrate salt dihydrochloride or<br>
(4-cyclopropyl-piperazin-1-yl)-(4-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-phenyl)-methanone<br>
citrate salt. In further embodiments, the compound is (4-cyclopropyl-piperazin-<br>
1 -yl)-[4-(4-fluoro-piperidin-1 -ylmethyl)-phenyl]-methanone citrate salt, (4-<br>
cyclopropyl-piperazin-1-yl)-(4-thiomorpholin-4-ylmethyl-phenyl)-methanone<br>
citrate salt, or (4-cyclopropyl-piperazin-1-yl)-[4-(2-hydroxymethyl-morpholin-4-<br>
ylmethyl)-phenyl]-methanone citrate salt.<br>
The present invention provides methods of treating or preventing<br>
diseases and conditions mediated by histamine H3 receptor activity. The<br>
invention also features pharmaceutical compositions containing such<br>
compounds and methods of using such compositions in the treatment or<br>
prevention of diseases mediated by histamine H3 receptor activity. The<br>
present invention also contemplates a method of treating or preventing a<br>
disease or condition in which histamine is involved with a combination therapy<br>
of compounds of the present invention administered with any of the following:<br>
histamine H1 antagonists, histamine H2 antagonists, neurotransmitter re-uptake<br>
blockers, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-<br>
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors, non-<br>
selective serotonin-, dopamine- or norepinephrine- re-uptake inhibitors,<br>
modafinil, and topiramate.<br><br>
The pKa of a given compound affects the degree of ionization at<br>
physiological pH. As unionized forms are more lipophilic, they can penetrate<br>
membranes, including the blood-brain barrier, more readily. Although<br>
calculated pKa values for the a cyclopropyl amine compound of the present<br>
invention (Example 1) were similar to that obtained for an isopropyl analog<br>
(Comparative Example 1), the measured pKa's differed greatly. Although it has<br>
been suggested that a cyclopropyl amine is approximately ten times less basic<br>
than aliphatic amines (Zaragoza, et al. J. Med. Chem. 2004, 47, 2833-2838),<br>
no direct experimental evidence has been reported (Love, et al. J. Am. Chem.<br>
Soc. 1968, 90(10), 2455-2462). Therefore, replacement of a cyclopropyl group<br>
for an aliphatic one may produce a higher fraction of non-protonated amine at<br>
physiological pH and, thus, serve to improve permeability of membranes<br>
(Zaragoza, et al. J. Med. Chem. 2005, 48, 306-311). These data indicate that<br>
cyclopropyl amines may tend toward a greater permeability and volume of<br>
distribution (Vd) than aliphatic amines of similar structure.<br>
The present invention provides experimental evidence demonstrating a<br>
significant decrease in basicity for Example 1, a cyclopropyl amine, relative to<br>
its isopropyl and cyclobutyl amine analogs. However, cyclopropyl amines of<br>
the present invention actually showed a pharmacokinetic profile that contrasted<br>
with the results predicted in the literature. For example, Example 1B displayed<br>
a shorter half-life (T1/2) and lower volume of distribution (Vd) than Comparative<br>
Examples 1B and 2B. Similarly, Example 2B displayed a shorter T1/2 and lower<br>
Vd than Comparative Examples 3B and 4B; Example 3B displayed a shorter<br>
T1/2 and lower Vd than Comparative Example 5B, and Example 4B displayed a<br>
shorter T1/2 and lower Vd than Comparative Example 6B.<br>
Additional features and advantages of the invention will become<br>
apparent from the detailed description and examples below, and the appended<br>
claims.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention may be more fully appreciated by reference to the<br>
following description, including the following glossary of terms and the<br>
concluding examples. For the sake of brevity, the disclosures of the<br>
publications cited in this specification are herein incorporated by reference.<br><br>
and examples that follow. To obtain the various compounds herein, starting<br>
materials may be employed that carry the ultimately desired substituents<br>
though the reaction scheme with or without protection as appropriate. This<br>
may be achieved by means of conventional protecting groups, such as those<br>
described in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", ed. J.F.W. McOmie,<br>
Plenum Press, 1973; and T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wuts, "Protective Groups in<br>
Organic Synthesis", 3rd ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999. The protecting groups<br>
may be removed at a convenient subsequent stage using methods known from<br>
the art. Alternatively, it may be necessary to employ, in the place of the<br>
ultimately desired substituent, a suitable group that may be carried through the<br>
reaction scheme and replaced as appropriate with the desired substituent.<br>
Such compounds, precursors, or prodrugs are also within the scope of the<br>
invention. Reactions may be performed between the melting point and the<br>
reflux temperature of the solvent, and preferably between 0 °C and the reflux<br>
temperature of the solvent.<br>
The compounds as described above may be made according to<br>
Schemes A-C below. Persons skilled in the art will recognize that certain<br>
compounds are more advantageously produced by one scheme as compared<br>
to the other. In addition, synthetic sequences described in U.S. Pat. Appl. No.<br>
10/690, 115 are hereby incorporated by reference and may be applied to the<br>
preparation of compounds of the present invention. One skilled in the art will<br>
recognize that compounds of Formula (I) where where R1R2N- is morpholinyl,<br>
4-fluoropiperidinyl, thiomorpholinyl, or 2-hydroxymethyl-morpholin-4-yl are<br>
compounds of the present invention.<br><br>
Scheme A<br><br>
Referring to Scheme A, amines of formula (X), where PG is cyclopropyl<br>
or a suitable protecting group such as a benzyl or tert-butylcarbamoyl (Boc),<br>
may be coupled with benzoic acids of formula (XI), either through activation of<br>
the acid to the acid chloride or acid fluoride followed by reaction with the<br>
amine, or directly under peptide coupling conditions, such as 1,1'-<br>
carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) or 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide<br>
hydrochloride (EDC)/1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt). Preferably, reactions are<br>
run with EDC/HOBt in the presence of 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP), in a<br>
solvent such as CH2CI2. Benzaldehydes of formula (XII) may then be reacted<br>
with suitable amines R1NR2H (where R1NR2H is morpholine, 4-fluoropiperidine,<br>
thiomorpholine, or morpholin-2-yl-methanol) under reductive amination<br>
conditions to provide benzyl amines (XIII). Suitable reducing agents include<br>
NaCNBH3 or NaB(OAc)3H in a solvent such as methanol or dichloroethane.<br>
Preferred conditions include NaB(OAc)3H in methanol. The protecting group<br>
"PG" may then be removed under standard deprotection conditions to provide<br>
amines of formula (XIV). Where PG is Boc, deprotection may be effected<br>
using HCI in 1,4-dioxane or trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in CH2CI2. Amines (XV)<br>
are converted to the corresponding cyclopropyl amines of Formula (I) through<br>
reaction with [(1-methoxycyclopropyl)oxy]trimethylsilane or [(1-<br>
ethoxycyclopropyl)oxy]-trimethylsilane (R is methyl or ethyl) under conditions<br><br>
similar to those described in J. Med. Chem. 2004, 47(11), 2733-2738 and<br>
Tetrahedron Lett. 1995, 36(41), 7399-7402.<br><br>
Alternatively, compounds of the present invention may be prepared as in<br>
Schemes B and C. To this end, protected heterocycle (X), where PG is as<br>
defined previously, may be reacted with [(1-methoxycyclopropyl)oxy]-<br>
trimethylsilane or [(1-ethoxycyclopropyl)oxy]trimethylsilane as described in J.<br>
Med. Chem. 2004, 47(11), 2733-2738 and Tetrahedron Lett. 1995, 36(41),<br>
7399-7402. Preferably, PG is a Boc group. The group "PG" may then be<br>
removed under standard deprotection conditions to provide cyclopropyl amines<br>
of formula (XVI). Where PG is Boc, preferred conditions include a mixture of<br>
HCI in a solvent such as 1,4-dioxane.<br><br>
Acids of formula (XI) may be coupled (through activation or directly as<br>
described in Scheme A) with amines (XVI) to form amides (XVII). Reductive<br>
amination with a suitable amine as described in Scheme A gives rise to<br>
compounds of Formula (I).<br>
Compounds of the present invention may be converted to their<br>
corresponding salts using methods known to those skilled in the art. For<br>
example, free base forms of compounds of the present invention may be<br><br>
treated with TFA, HCI, or citric acid in a solvent such as methanol (MeOH) or<br>
ethanol (EtOH) to provide the corresponding salt forms.<br>
Compounds prepared according to the schemes described above may<br>
be obtained as single enantiomers or diastereomers, or as racemic mixtures or<br>
mixtures of enantiomers or diastereomers. Where such mixtures are obtained,<br>
isomers may be separated using conventional methods such as<br>
chromatography or crystallization. Where racemic (1:1) and non-racemic (not<br>
1:1) mixtures of enantiomers are obtained, single enantiomers may be isolated<br>
using conventional separation methods known to one skilled in the art.<br>
Particularly useful separation methods may include chiral chromatography,<br>
recrystallization, resolution, diastereomeric salt formation, or derivatization into<br>
diastereomeric adducts followed by separation.<br>
The present invention includes within its scope prodrugs of the<br>
compounds of this invention. In general, such prodrugs will be functional<br>
derivatives of the compounds that are readily convertible in vivo into the<br>
required compound. Thus, in the methods of treatment of the present<br>
invention, the term "administering" shall encompass the treatment of the<br>
various disorders described with a compound of the present invention or with a<br>
compound that converts to a compound of the present invention in vivo after<br>
administration to the patient. Conventional procedures for the selection and<br>
preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in<br>
"Design of Prodrugs", ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985. In addition to salts,<br>
the invention provides the esters, amides, and other protected or derivatized<br>
forms of the described compounds.<br>
For therapeutic use, salts of the compounds of the present invention are<br>
those that are pharmaceutically acceptable. However, salts of acids and bases<br>
that are non-pharmaceutically acceptable may also find use, for example, in<br>
the preparation or purification of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound. All<br>
salts, whether pharmaceutically acceptable or not, are included within the<br>
ambit of the present invention.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds according to the<br>
present invention refer to those salt forms of the compounds of the present<br>
invention which would be apparent to the pharmaceutical chemist, i.e., those<br><br>
that are non-toxic and that would favorably affect the pharmacokinetic<br>
properties of said compounds of the present invention, such as sufficient<br>
payability, absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. Other factors,<br>
more practical in nature, which are also important in the selection, are cost of<br>
raw materials, ease of crystallization, yield, stability, hygroscopicity and<br>
flowability of the resulting bulk drug.<br>
Examples of acids that may be used in the preparation of<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the following: acetic acid, 2,2-<br>
dichloroacetic acid, acylated amino acids, adipic acid, alginic acid, ascorbic<br>
acid, L-aspartic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, benzoic acid, 4-acetamidobenzoic<br>
acid, boric acid, (+)-camphoric acid, camphorsulfonic acid, (+)-(1S)-camphor-<br>
10-sulfonic acid, capric acid, caproic acid, caprylic acid, cinnamic acid, citric<br>
acid, cyclamic acid, cyclohexanesulfamic acid, dodecylsulfuric acid, ethane-<br>
1,2-disulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, 2-hydroxy-ethanesulfonic acid, formic<br>
acid, fumaric acid, galactaric acid, gentisic acid, glucoheptonic acid, D-gluconic<br>
acid, D-glucuronic acid, L-glutamic acid, a-oxo-glutaric acid, glycolic acid,<br>

acid, (±)-DL-iactic acid, lactobionic acid, lauric acid, maleic acid, (-)-L-malic<br>
acid, malonic acid, (±)-DL-mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, naphthalene-2-<br>
sulfonic acid, naphthalene-1,5-disulfonic acid, 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid,<br>
nicotinic acid, nitric acid, oleic acid, orotic acid, oxalic acid, palmitic acid,<br>
pamoic acid, perchloric acid, phosphoric acid, L-pyroglutamic acid, saccharic<br>
acid, salicylic acid, 4-amino-salicylic acid, sebacic acid, stearic acid, succinic<br>
acid, sulfuric acid, tannic acid, (+)-L-tartaric acid, thiocyanic acid, p-<br>
toluenesulfonic acid, undecylenic acid, and valeric acid.<br>
Compounds of the present invention containing acidic protons may be<br>
converted into their therapeutically active non-toxic metal or amine addition salt<br>
forms by treatment with appropriate organic and inorganic bases. Appropriate<br>
base salt forms comprise, for example, the ammonium salts; the alkali and<br>
earth alkaline metal salts (e.g. lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium<br>
salts, which may be prepared by treatment with, for example, magnesium<br>
hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, zinc hydroxide, or sodium<br>
hydroxide); and amine salts made with organic bases (e.g. primary, secondary<br><br>
and tertiary aliphatic and aromatic amines such as L-arginine, benethamine,<br>
benzathine, choline, deanol, diethanolamine, diethylamine, dimethylamine,<br>

The compounds of the present invention are modulators of the<br>
histamine H3 receptor, and as such, the compounds are useful in the treatment<br>
of disease states mediated by histamine H3 receptor activity. Thus, the<br>
compounds of the present invention may be used in a method of treating a<br>
subject suffering from or diagnosed with a disease mediated by histamine H3<br>
receptor activity, comprising administering to a subject in need of such<br>
treatment an effective amount of a compound of the present invention, or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Particularly, the compounds may be<br>
used in methods for treating or preventing neurologic or neuropsychiatric<br>
disorders including sleep/wake and arousal/vigilance disorders (e.g. insomnia<br>
and jet lag), attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD), learning and<br>
memory disorders, cognitive dysfunction, migraine, neurogenic inflammation,<br>
dementia, mild cognitive impairment (pre-dementia), Alzheimer's disease,<br>
epilepsy, narcolepsy with or without associated cataplexy, cataplexy, disorders<br>
of sleep/wake homeostasis, idiopathic somnolence, excessive daytime<br>
sleepiness (EDS), circadian rhythm disorders, sleep/fatigue disorders, fatigue,<br>
drowsiness associated with sleep apnea, sleep impairment due to<br>
perimenopausal hormonal shifts, Parkinson's-related fatigue, MS-related<br>
fatigue, depression-related fatigue, chemotherapy-induced fatigue, eating<br>
disorders, obesity, motion sickness, vertigo, schizophrenia, substance abuse,<br><br>
bipolar disorders, manic disorders and depression, as well as other disorders in<br>
which the histamine H3 receptor is involved, such as upper airway allergic<br>
response, asthma, itch, nasal congestion and allergic rhinitis in a subject in<br>
need thereof. For example, the invention features methods for preventing,<br>
inhibiting the progression of, or treating upper airway allergic response,<br>
asthma, itch, nasal congestion and allergic rhinitis. Excessive daytime<br>
sleepiness (EDS) may occur with or without associated sleep apnea, shift work,<br>
fibromyalgia, MS, and the like.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be used in methods for<br>
treating or preventing disease states selected from the group consisting of:<br>
cognitive disorders, sleep disorders, psychiatric disorders, and other disorders.<br>
Cognitive disorders include, for example, dementia, Alzheimer's disease<br>
(Panula, P. et al., Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1995, 21, 1977), cognitive dysfunction,<br>
mild cognitive impairment (pre-dementia), attention deficit hyperactivity<br>
disorders (ADHD), attention-deficit disorders, and learning and memory<br>
disorders (Barnes, J.C. et al., Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1993, 19, 1813). Learning<br>
and memory disorders include, for example, learning impairment, memory<br>
impairment, age-related cognitive decline, and memory loss. H3 antagonists<br>
have been shown to improve memory in a variety of memory tests, including<br>
the elevated plus maze in mice (Miyazaki, S. et al. Life Sci. 1995, 57(23), 2137-<br>
2144), a two-trial place recognition task (Orsetti, M. et al. Behav. Brain Res.<br>
2001, 124(2), 235-242), the passive avoidance test in mice (Miyazaki, S. et al.<br>
Meth. Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol. 1995,17(10), 653-658) and the radial maze<br>
in rats (Chen, Z. Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2000, 21(10), 905-910). Also, in the<br>
spontaneously hypertensive rat, an animal model for the learning impairments<br>
in attention-deficit disorders, H3 antagonists were shown to improve memory<br>
(Fox, G.B. et al. Behav. Brain Res. 2002, 131(1-2), 151-161).<br>
Sleep disorders include, for example, insomnia, disturbed sleep,<br>
narcolepsy (with or without associated cataplexy), cataplexy, disorders of<br>
sleep/wake homeostasis, idiopathic somnolence, excessive daytime sleepiness<br>
(EDS), circadian rhythm disorders, fatigue, lethargy, REM-behavioral disorder,<br>
and jet lag. Fatigue and/or sleep impairment may be caused by or associated<br>
with various sources, such as, for example, sleep apnea, perimenopausal<br><br>
hormonal shifts, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), depression,<br>
chemotherapy, or shift work schedules.<br>
Psychiatric disorders include, for example, schizophrenia (Schlicker, E.<br>
and Marr, I., Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1996, 353, 290-294),<br>
bipolar disorders, manic disorders, depression (Lamberti, C. et al. Br. J.<br>
Pharmacol. 1998,123(7), 1331-1336; Perez-Garcia, C. et al.<br>
Psychopharmacology1999, 142(2), 215-220) (Also see: Stark, H. et al., Drugs<br>
Future 1996, 21(5), 507-520; and Leurs, R. et al., Prog. Drug Res. 1995, 45,<br>
107-165 and references cited therein.), obsessive-compulsive disorder, and<br>
post-traumatic stress disorder.<br>
Other disorders include, for example, motion sickness, vertigo (including<br>
vertigo and benign postural vertigo), tinitus, epilepsy (Yokoyama, H. et al., Eur.<br>
J. Pharmacol. 1993, 234, 129-133), migraine, neurogenic inflammation, eating<br>
disorders (Machidori, H. etal., Brain Res. 1992, 590, 180-186), obesity,<br>
substance abuse disorders, movement disorders (e.g. restless leg syndrome),<br>
and eye-related disorders (e.g. macular degeneration and retinitis<br>
pigmentosis).<br>
Said methods of treating and preventing comprise the step of<br>
administering to a mammal suffering therefrom an effective amount of at least<br>
one compound of the present invention.<br>
The present invention also contemplates a method of treating or<br>
preventing a histamine-mediated disease or condition with a combination<br>
therapy for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, nasal congestion, and allergic<br>
congestion, comprising: a) administering an effective amount of at least one<br>
compound of the present invention, and b) administering an effective amount<br>
of one or more histamine H1 or H2 antagonists. Suitable histamine H1<br>
antagonists include: loratidine (CLARITIN™), desloratidine (CLARINEX™),<br>
fexofenadine (ALLEGRA™) and cetirizine (ZYRTEC™).<br>
The present invention also contemplates a method of treating or<br>
preventing a histamine-mediated disease or condition with a combination<br>
therapy for the treatment of depression, mood disorders or schizophrenia,<br>
comprising: a) administering an effective amount of at least one compound of<br>
the present invention, and b) administering an effective amount of one or more<br><br>
neurotransmitter re-uptake blockers. Suitable neurotransmitter re-uptake<br>
blockers include: selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-<br>
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors, or non-<br>
selective serotonin-, dopamine- or norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors.<br>
Particular examples of neurotransmitter re-uptake blockers include fluoxetine<br>
(PROZAC™), sertraline (ZOLOFT™), paroxetine (PAXIL™), and amitryptyline.<br>
The present invention also contemplates a method of treating or<br>
preventing a histamine-mediated disease or condition with a combination<br>
therapy for the treatment of narcolepsy, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS),<br>
Alzheimer's disease, depression, attention deficit disorders, MS-related fatigue,<br>
post-anesthesia grogginess, cognitive impairment, schizophrenia, spasticity<br>
associated with cerebral palsy, age-related memory decline, idiopathic<br>
somnolence, or jet-lag, comprising: a) administering an effective amount of at<br>
least one compound of the present invention, and b) administering an effective<br>
amount of modafinil.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention contemplates a method of<br>
treating or preventing a histamine-mediated disease or condition with a<br>
combination therapy comprising: a) administering an effective amount of at<br>
least one compound of the present invention, and b) administering an effective<br>
amount of topiramate (Topamax). In particular, such methods are useful for<br>
the treatment of obesity. Preferably, the combination method employs doses<br>
of topiramate in the range of about 20 to 300 mg per dose.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may be administered in<br>
pharmaceutical compositions to treat patients (humans and other mammals)<br>
with disorders mediated by the H3 receptor. Thus, the invention features<br>
pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one compound of the present<br>
invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A composition of the<br>
invention may further include at least one other therapeutic agent such as H1<br>
antagonists, SSRIs, topiramate, or modafinil (for example, a combination<br>
formulation or combination of differently formulated active agents for use in a<br>
combination therapy method).<br>
The present invention also features methods of using or preparing or<br>
formulating such pharmaceutical compositions. The pharmaceutical<br><br>
compositions can be prepared using conventional pharmaceutical excipients<br>
and compounding techniques known to those skilled in the art of preparing<br>
dosage forms. It is anticipated that the compounds of the invention can be<br>
administered by oral, parenteral, rectal, topical, or ocular routes, or by<br>
inhalation. Preparations may also be designed to give slow release of the<br>
active ingredient. The preparation may be in the form of tablets, capsules,<br>
sachets, vials, powders, granules, lozenges, powders for reconstitution, liquid<br>
preparations, or suppositories. Preferably, compounds may be administered<br>
by intravenous infusion or topical administration, but more preferably by oral<br>
administration.<br>
For oral administration, the compounds of the invention can be provided<br>
in the form of tablets or capsules, or as a solution, emulsion, or suspension.<br>
Tablets for oral use may include the active ingredient mixed with<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as inert diluents, disintegrating<br>
agents, binding agents, lubricating agents, sweetening agents, flavoring<br>
agents, coloring agents and preservatives. Suitable inert fillers include sodium<br>
and calcium carbonate, sodium and calcium phosphate, lactose, starch, sugar,<br>
glucose, methyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, mannitol, sorbitol, and the like;<br>
typical liquid oral excipients include ethanol, glycerol, water and the like.<br>
Starch, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, sodium starch glycolate, microcrystalline<br>
cellulose, and alginic acid are suitable disintegrating agents. Binding agents<br>
may include starch and gelatin. The lubricating agent, if present, will generally<br>
be magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. If desired, the tablets may be<br>
coated with a material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate to<br>
delay absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, or may be coated with an enteric<br>
coating. Capsules for oral use include hard gelatin capsules in which the<br>
active ingredient is mixed with a solid, semi-solid, or liquid diluent, and soft<br>
gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water, an oil such<br>
as peanut oil or olive oil, liquid paraffin, a mixture of mono and di-glycerides of<br>
short chain fatty acids, polyethylene glycol 400, or propylene glycol.<br>
Liquids for oral administration may be suspensions, solutions, emulsions<br>
or syrups or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or<br>
other suitable vehicles before use. Compositions of such liquid may contain<br><br>
pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients such as suspending agents (for<br>
example, sorbitol, methyl cellulose, sodium alginate, gelatin,<br>
hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, aluminium stearate gel and the<br>
like); non-aqueous vehicles, which include oils (for example, almond oil or<br>
fractionated coconut oil), propylene glycol, ethyl alcohol or water; preservatives<br>
(for example, methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid); wetting<br>
agents such as lecithin; and, if needed, flavoring or coloring agents.<br>
The compounds of this invention may also be administered by non-oral<br>
routes. The compositions may be formulated for rectal administration as a<br>
suppository. For parenteral use, including intravenous, intramuscular,<br>
intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous routes, the compounds of the invention will<br>
generally be provided in sterile aqueous solutions or suspensions, buffered to<br>
an appropriate pH and isotonicity or in parenterally acceptable oil. Suitable<br>
aqueous vehicles include Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride. Such<br>
forms will be presented in unit dose form such as ampules or disposable<br>
injection devices, in multi-dose forms such as vials from which the appropriate<br>
dose may be withdrawn, or in a solid form or pre-concentrate that can be used<br>
to prepare an injectable formulation. Another mode of administration of the<br>
compounds of the invention may utilize a patch formulation to affect<br>
transdermal delivery. The compounds of this invention may also be<br>
administered by inhalation, via the nasal or oral routes using a spray<br>
formulation consisting of the compound of the invention and a suitable carrier.<br>
Methods are known in the art for determining effective doses for<br>
therapeutic (treatment) and prophylactic (preventative) purposes for the<br>
pharmaceutical compositions or the drug combinations of the present<br>
invention, whether or not formulated in the same composition. The specific<br>
dosage level required for any particular patient will depend on a number of<br>
factors, including severity of the condition being treated, the route of<br>
administration, metabolic rate, and the weight of the patient. For therapeutic<br>
purposes, "effective dose" or "effective amount" refers to that amount of each<br>
active compound or pharmaceutical agent, alone or in combination, that elicits<br>
the biological or medicinal response in a tissue system, animal, or human that<br>
is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor, or other clinician,<br><br>
which includes alleviation of the symptoms of the disease or disorder being<br>
treated. For prophylactic purposes (i.e., preventing or inhibiting the onset or<br>
progression of a disorder), the term "effective dose" or "effective amount" refers<br>
to that amount of each active compound or pharmaceutical agent, alone or in<br>
combination, that inhibits in a subject the onset or progression of a disorder as<br>
being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor, or other clinician,<br>
the delaying of which disorder is mediated, at least in part, by the modulation of<br>
the histamine H3 receptor. Methods of combination therapy include co-<br>
administration of a single formulation containing all active agents; essentially<br>
contemporaneous administration of more than one formulation; and<br>
administration of two or more active agents separately formulated.<br>
It is anticipated that the daily dose (whether administered as a single<br>
dose or as divided doses) will be in the range 0.01 to 1000 mg per day, more<br>
usually from 1 to 500 mg per day, and most usually from 10 to 200 mg per day.<br>
Expressed as dosage per unit body weight, a typical dose will be expected to<br>
be between 0.0001 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg, especially between 0.01 mg/kg and 7<br>
mg/kg, and most especially between 0.15 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg.<br>
Preferably, oral doses range from about 0.05 to 200 mg/kg, daily, taken<br>
in 1 to 4 separate doses. Some compounds of the invention may be orally<br>
dosed in the range of about 0.05 to about 50 mg/kg daily, others may be dosed<br>
at 0.05 to about 20 mg/kg daily, while still others may be dosed at 0.1 to about<br>
10 mg/kg daily. Infusion doses can range from about 1 to 1000 µg/kg/min of<br>
inhibitor, admixed with a pharmaceutical carrier over a period ranging from<br>
several minutes to several days. For topical administration compounds of the<br>
present invention may be mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier at a<br>
concentration of about 0.1% to about 10% of drug to vehicle.<br>
Examples<br>
In order to illustrate the invention, the following examples are included.<br>
These examples do not limit the invention. They are only meant to suggest a<br>
method of practicing the invention. Those skilled in the art may find other<br>
methods of practicing the invention, which are obvious to them. However,<br>
those methods are deemed to be within the scope of this invention.<br><br>

methanone. To a solution of 4-(4-cyclopropyl-piperazine-1-carbonyl)-<br>
benzaldehyde (56.0 g) in 1,2-dichloroethane (550 mL) was added morpholine<br><br>
(37.8 mL) dropwise over 5 min. The mixture was cooled to 10 °C and was<br>
treated with NaB(OAc)3H (64.3 g) in portions over 1 h. After a further 2 h, the<br>
mixture was warmed to rt, and a water bath was used to keep the temperature<br>
below 20 °C. After 18 h, water (60 mL) was added while the temperature was<br>
kept under 20 °C by the addition of small amounts of ice. After 20 min, the<br>
mixture was basified to pH -10 with 1 N NaOH (450 mL) and the mixture was<br>
stirred for 10 min. The layers were separated, and the organic layer was<br>
washed with 1 N NaOH (150 mL). The combined aqueous layers were<br>
extracted with CH2CI2 (200 mL). The combined organic layers were washed<br>
with brine (200 mL), dried (Na2SO4), and concentrated to give the title<br>
compound as pale yellow viscous oil (68.0 g, 95%). HPLC: RT = 4.39 min. MS<br>

Biological Examples and Data<br>
A. Transfection of Cells with Human Histamine Receptor<br>
Cells were grown to about 70% to 80% confluence and removed from<br>
the plate with trypsin and pelleted in a clinical centrifuge. The pellet was then<br>
re-suspended in 400 uL of complete media and transferred to an<br>
electroporation cuvette with a 0.4 cm gap between the electrodes (Bio-Rad<br>
#165-2088). One ug supercoiled H3 receptor cDNA was added to the cells and<br><br>
mixed gently. The voltage for the electroporation was set at 0.25 kV and the<br>
capacitance was set at 960 pF. After electroporation the cells were diluted with<br>
10 mL of complete media and were plated onto four 10 cm dishes at the<br>
following ratios: 1:20,1:10,1:5, and 1:2. The cells were allowed to recover for<br>
24 h before adding 600 ug G-418. Colonies that survived selection were grown<br>
and tested. SK-N-MC cells were used because they give efficient coupling for<br>
inhibition of adenylate cyclase. The clones that gave the most robust inhibition<br>
of adenylate cyclase in response to histamine were used for further study.<br>
B. [3H]-N-Methylhistamine Binding<br>
Cell pellets from histamine H3 receptor-expressing SK-N-MC cells were<br>
homogenized in 50 mM TrisHCI/0.5 mM EDTA. Supernatants from an 800 g<br>
spin were collected and were recentrifuged at 30,000 g for 30 min. Pellets<br>
were re-homogenized in 50 mM Tris/5 mM EDTA (pH 7.4). Membranes were<br>
incubated with 0.8 nM [3H]-N-methylhistamine plus/minus test compounds for<br>
60 min at 25 °C and were harvested by rapid filtration over GF/C glass fiber<br>
filters (pretreated with 0.3% polyethylenimine) followed by four washes with<br>
buffer. Filters were added to 5 mL of scintillation cocktail, and the signal was<br>
then counted on a liquid scintillation counter. Non-specific binding was defined<br>
with 10 µM histamine. pKI values were calculated based on a KD of 0.8 nM and<br>
a ligand concentration ([L]) of 0.8 nM according to the formula KI= (IC50)/(1 +<br>
([L]/(KD)). Data for compounds tested in this assay are presented in Table 2<br>
as an average of results obtained. Binding data for Comparative Example 1<br>
was presented in U.S. Patent Appl. No. 10/690,115 (Oct. 21, 2003).<br>
Table 2. Binding Activity at the Human H3 Receptor.<br><br><br><br>
C.	Cyclic AMP accumulation<br>
Sublines of SK-N-MC cells were created that expressed a reporter<br>
construct and the human H3 receptor. The pA2 values were obtained as<br>
described by Barbier, AJ. et al. (Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994, 143(5), 649-661).<br>
Data for compounds tested in this assay are presented in Table 3, as an<br>
average of the results obtained.<br>
Table 3. Functional Activity<br><br>
D.	Pharmacokinetics and bioanalysis<br>
One group of six male Sprague Dawley Rats (approx. 300 g body<br>
weight; three animals per time point) was used. They were group-housed,<br><br>
provided food and water ad libitum, and were maintained on a 12-h light and<br>
dark cycle. Animals were acclimatized for at least 7 days after receipt from the<br>
vendor prior to investigations.<br>
For oral dosing, test compounds were formulated at 1 mg/mL in 0.5%<br>
hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose and delivered at a dose of 10 mg/kg. Citric acid<br>
salt forms (prepared as described for Example 1B) of the test compounds were<br>
used. Animals received a bolus dose of 10 mg/kg (10 mL/kg) for each<br>
compound via a 16 gauge intragastric gavage. For intravenous dosing, test<br>
compounds were formulated at 1 mg/mL in 5% dextrose in water and dosed at<br>
1 mg/kg (1 mL/kg) with a bolus intravenous dose via a 24-gauge Terumo®<br>
Surflo® catheter in the lateral tail vein. All dosing solutions were prepared<br>
immediately prior to injection.<br>
Blood samples (250 µL) were taken from the lateral tail vein into<br>
heparinized Natelson blood collection tubes and expelled into 1.5 mL<br>
mcirocentrifuge tubes. The blood samples were centrifuged for 5 min at<br>
14,000 rpm in a micro-centrifuge. Plasma was retained and kept in a -20 °C<br>
freezer until analysis by LC-MS/MS.<br>
Data analysis was performed using WinNonlin version 3.3 or 4.0.1. A non-<br>
compartmental model (#200 for Extravascular administration and #201 for i.v.)<br>
was used to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters shown in Tables 4 and<br>
5 (NA = not applicable or not determined).<br>
