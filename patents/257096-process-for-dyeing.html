Process for Dyeing<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the bichromatic and/or trichromatic dyeing or printing hydroxy-group-containing or nitrogen-containing organic substrates with dye mixtures and also to such dye mixtures and hydroxy-group-containing or nitrogen-containing organic substrates dyed or printed therewith.<br>
Trichromatic describes the additive colour mixing of suitable yellow- or orange-, red-and blue-dyeing dyes with which any desired shade in the visible spectrum can be obtained by suitably selecting the amount ratios for the dyes. However, it is possible to archive some shades by mixing only two colorants selected from a suitable yellow- or orange-, red- and blue-dyeing dye which is here called bichromatic dyeing.<br>
Trichromatic and bichromatic dyeing is well known from the literature for various dye classes, for example from EP 83299, DE 2623178, EP 226982 and EP808940.<br>
Optimum trichromatic or bichromatic performance of any yellow (or orange), red and blue dye mixture is crucially dependent on the neutral affinity and migration characteristics. Dyes having identical or very similar characteristics with regard to neutral affinity and migration are highly compatible with regard to trichromatic or bichromatic performance.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a trichromatic or bichromatic dyeing process and associated trichromatic or bichromatic dye mixtures consisting of at least one red component, at least one yellow component or orange component or one blue component whereby trichromatic or bichromatic dyeing with good fastnesses is obtained.<br>
This object is achieved by a trichromatic or bichromatic dyeing process which is characterized by using a dye mixture comprising a red-dyeing compound of the formula<br>
(I)<br><br><br>
and at least one yellow-dyeing compound or orange-dyeing compound or one blue-dyeing compound.<br>
In a further embodiment this object is achieved by a trichromatic dyeing process which is characterized by using a dye mixture comprising a red-dyeing compound of the formula (1) and at least one yellow-dyeing compound or orange-dyeing compound and at least one blue-dyeing compound.<br>

Preferred hydroxy-group-containing or nitrogen-containing organic substrates are leather and fibrous materials, which comprise natural or synthetic polyamides and, particularly, natural or regenerated cellulose such as, cotton, viscose and spun rayon. The most preferred substrates are textile materials comprising cotton.<br>
The compound of the formula (I) is prepared according to EP962500.<br>
The yellow-dyeing compounds or orange-dyeing compounds are known from the state of the art and can therefore be produced according to the process given in the prior art. E.g. WO96/02593 and F.Lehr, Dyes Pigm. (1990), 14(4), 257.<br>
The blue-dyeing compounds are also known from the state of the art and can therefore be produced according to the process given in the prior art. E.g. EP 99721, EP84314, WO0168775, EP 149170, EP497174 and DE4241918.<br>
This invention further provides dye mixtures for the trichromatic dyeing or printing of hydroxy-group-containing or nitrogen-containing organic substrates are used in the above processes according to the invention.<br>
The inventive process for trichromatic dyeing or printing can be applied to all customary and known dyeing and printing processes, for example the continuous process, the exhaust process, the foam dyeing process and the ink-jet process.<br>
The composition of the individual dye components in the trichromatic dye mixture used in the process according to the invention depends on the desired hue. For instance, a brown hue preferably utilizes 30-65% by weight of the yellow (or orange) component according to the invention, 10-30% by weight of the red component according to the invention and 10-30% by weight of the blue component according to the invention.<br>
The red component, as described above, can consist of a single component or of a mixture of different red individual components.<br>
The same applies to the yellow (or orange) and blue components.<br><br>
The total amount of dyes in the process according to the invention is between 0.01 and 15% by weight, preferably between 1 and 10% by weight.<br>
The present invention further provides hydroxy-group-containing or nitrogen-containing organic substrates dyed or printed by a dye mixture according to the invention.<br>
The process according to the invention provides dyeings and prints having a homogeneous hue build-up throughout the entire hue spectrum with on-tone exhaustion, with a high bath exhaustion even in the case of fibres with low saturation and with a high dye build-up on fine fibres, particularly on microfibres.<br>
The resulting dyeings or prints are notable for very high wet fastnesses, specifically the fastnesses in washing, perspiration and water. These good wet and fabrication fastnesses, which are in no way inferior to the fastness level of dyeings and prints with metal complexes, are obtained without afte rtreatment. With an additional after treat-ment, these fastnesses are even exceeded.<br>
These excellent results are provided by metal-free elements which meet the current and future ecological requirements of national institutes and regulations.<br>
The tables which follow show some examples of the individual components of the dye mixtures which are used in the inventive trichromatic dyeing process.<br><br>
