Water was added to the reaction mixture and the resulting mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent was then distilled off under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel thin layer chromatography (developing agent; methylene chloride : methanol = 10:1), whereby 175 mg (73%) of the title compound were obtained as white crystals.<br>

(al Preparation of Crude Pulmonary Membrane Specimens<br>
Crude pulmonary membrane specimens were prepared from the lungs of male Hartley guinea pigs. Namely, the animals were sacrificed by exsanguination from the abdominal aorta under chloroform anesthesia followed promptly by excision of lung and respiratory tract tissue.<br>
After perfusing the excised lungs in buffer (1) (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), the lungs were sliced into thin sections and then homogenized in a buffer (2) (buffer (1) containing 120 mM sodium chloride and 5 mM potassium chloride) using a Polytron.<br>

After the reaction, the membrane component was recovered on a GF/B glass fiber filter (Whatman) using an automatic filtration system (Brandel).<br>
Incidentally, the glass filter was pretreated for about 4 hours with 0.1% polyethyleneimine solution to minimize non-specific binding.<br>
The filter containing the membrane component was transferred to a mini plastic vial containing 4 ml of Picoflow and radioactivity was measured with a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman, LCS35OO).<br>

(a)	Preparation of Crude Heal Membrane Specimens<br>
Crude membrane specimens were prepared from the ileum of male Hartley guinea pigs. Namely, the animals were sacrificed by exsanguination from the abdominal aorta under chloroform anesthesia followed promptly by excision of the ileum.<br>
The excised ileum was separated into its contents, secretions and epithelium by scraping with a slide glass. After slicing into thin sections in buffer (1) (50 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.4), it was homogenized in buffer (2) (buffer (1) containing 120 mM sodium chloride and 5 mM potassium chloride) using a Polytron.<br>
The tissue mass was removed from the homogenate by passing through a Nylon mesh (50 \im) and separating by centrifugation (30,000 x g, 30 minutes, 4°C).<br>

After the reaction, the membrane component was recovered on a GF/B glass fiber filter (Whatman) using an automatic filtration system (Brandel).<br>
Incidentally, the glass filter was pretreated for about 4 hours with 0.1% polyethyleneimine solution to minimize non-specific binding.<br>

[Experiment 3] Inhibitory Effect on Increased Vascular Permeability<br>
The inhibitory effect on increased vascular permeability induced by NK] receptor antagonist substance P (SP) was assessed based on the amount of leaked pigment obtained using normal guinea pigs (male Hartley guinea pigs, body weights: approx. 400 g). Increased vascular permeability was induced by sequential administration of pigment (Evans blue: 20 mg/kg) to guinea pigs anesthetized with pentobarbital (25 mg/kg, i.p.) followed immediately by intravenous injection of SP (1 jag/kg). After 15 minutes, the guinea pigs were sacrificed under chloroform anesthesia and the amount of pigment that had leaked into the major areas of the respiratory tract was measured according to the method of Harada (J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 23, 218 (1971)). A test compound was suspended in a 0.5% tragacanth suspension and the resulting suspension was orally administered one hour before induction by SP.<br>
The inhibitory effect was based on the amounts of the leaked pigment in the guinea pigs to which a test compound was administered.<br>
[Experiment 4] Inhibitory Effect on Respiratory Tract Contraction<br>
The inhibitory effect of a test drug on respiratory tract contraction induced by neurokinin A (NKA), which is an NK2 receptor agonist, was assessed based on respiratory tract internal pressure in accordance with a variation of the method of Konzett-Roessler (Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Exp. Pathol. Pharmakol. 195, 71 (1940)) using normal guinea pigs (male Hartley guinea pigs, body weights: approx. 500 g).<br>
Namely, after implanting a respiratory tract cannula in the guinea pigs anesthetized with pentobarbital (30 mg/kg, i.p.) and administering gallamine (20 mg/kg, i.v.), the animals were immediately subjected to positive pressure breathing at 8 ml/kg and 60<br>

cycles/minute (Ugo-Basile, 7025). Respiratory tract internal pressure during artificial respiration was amplified by means of a pressure transducer (Nippon Denko, TP-200T) installed in the side branch of the respiratory tract cannula, received (Nippon Denko, AP-601G) and recorded with a recorder (Nippon Denko, WT-685G). Five minutes after pre-treatment with atropine (1 mg/kg, i.v.) and propranolol (1 mg/kg, i.v.). 4 jig/kg of NKA were intravenously administered to induce respiratory tract contraction. Respiratory tract internal pressure was then measured for 10 minutes. A test compound was prepared in a similar manner to that described in Experiment 3 and orally administered one hour before the induction by NKA.<br>
The inhibitory activity was determined by a comparison in the area of respiratory tract internal pressure between the group to which a test compound was administered and the non-administered group.<br>
[Experiment 5] NK3 receptor binding test<br>
(a)	Preparation of Crude Cerebral Membrane Specimens<br>
Crude membrane specimens were prepared from the brain of male Hartley guinea pigs. Namely, the animals were sacrificed by exsanguination from the abdominal aorta under chloroform anesthesia After perfusing with Buffer (1) (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) from the right ventricle, the brain was enucleated immediately. The excised brain was homogenized in buffer (2) (buffer (1) containing 120 mM sodium chloride and 5 mM potassium chloride) using a Polytron. Tissue mass was removed from the homogenate by passing through a Nylon mesh (50 jam) and separating by centrifugation (30,000 x g, 30 minutes, 4°C). The pellet (membrane component) was suspended in an ice-cooled Buffer (3) (Buffer (1) containing 10 mM EDTA and 300 mM potassium chloride) and after allowing to stand undisturbed for 60 minutes at 4°C, the resulting suspension was centrifuged and washed twice (30,000 x g, 15 minutes, 4°C). This was suspended in Buffer (1) to prepare the crude membrane specimens. It was stored at -80°C until the time of use in the receptor binding test.<br>
(b)	Receptor binding test<br>
A test tube to be used for the reaction was treated in advance with Buffer (1) containing 5 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin (BSA). To 100 ul of Buffer (1) containing [3H]-senktide, 6mM of manganese chloride, 800 ng/ml of BSA, 8 ng/ml of chimostatin,   8   ug   of  leupeptin,   80   ug/ml   of  bacitracin   and   20   (ag/ml   of<br>

phosphoramidone, 150 ul of Buffer (1) containing 400 (ig/ml of BSA and a lest compound were added. To the resulting mixture, 250 ul of the crude brain membrane specimen (adjusted to 1 mg/ml of a protein concentration) were added to start the reaction (at that time, the final concentration of the [3H]-senktide in the reaction phase was 2.5 nM).<br>
After incubation at room temperature for 60 minutes, the membrane component was recovered on a GF/B glass fiber filter (Whatman) using an automatic filtration system (Brandel), which had been pre-treated with 0.1% polyethyieneimine for more than 4 hours, followed by washing three times with 5 ml of ice-cooled Buffer (4) (5 mM tris-hydrochloric acid containing 400 ug/ml of BSA and 0.01% of sodium dodecylsulfate, pH 7.4).<br>
The filter containing the membrane component was transferred to a mini plastic vial containing 4 ml of Picoflow and radioactivity was measured with a liquid scintillation<br>
munter (Aloka, LSC 3500).<br>
In order to determine the radioactivity due to non-specific binding of [3H]-senktide (binding to sites other than the receptor, for example, the filter), the Experiment was carried out by adding an excess amount of senktide (final concentration: 10 uM), and the radioactivity was measured.<br>
The inhibitory ratio of senktide-receptor binding due to a test compound was calculated bv the following equation.<br>
Inhibitory ratio (%) = [1-(C-A)/(B-A)] x 100 A: radioactivity due to nonspecific binding B: radioactivity in the test without the addition of a test compound C: radioactivity in the test with the addition of a test compound<br>
The compounds of the present invention exhibited, against all of NK], NK2 and NK3 receptors, antagonistic activities superior to those of Compound A.<br>
[Industrial applicability]<br>
Since the spiropiperidine derivatives of the present invention exhibit excellent antagonistic activity against NKU NK2 and NK3 receptors, have less toxicity and superior pharmacokinetics, they are useful as a medicament, particularly as a preventive or remedy for asthma and/or bronchitis, rhinitis, allergies or urinary incontinence.<br>
