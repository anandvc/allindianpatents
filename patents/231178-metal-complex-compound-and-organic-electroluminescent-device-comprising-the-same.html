QltOAJJlC ELErTT?OLTJMlNEgCEMT DRMCE USING SAft^E<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel metal complex compound and an<br>
organic electroluminescence device using the compound. Particularly, the<br>
present invention relates to an organic electroluminescence device<br>
("electroluminescence" will be referred to as "EL", hereinafter) having excellent<br>
efficiency of light emission and prolonged lifetime, and to a metal complex<br>
compound realizing it.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The organic EL devices have been expected to be appUed to color wide<br>
screen image display devices replacing liquid crystal display devices, and have<br>
been intensively developed. Recently, although displays using the organic EL<br>
devices have now been used in practical applications, full-color image display<br>
devices using the same are still in the course of development because they lack in<br>
sufficient Hght emitting property. Very high efficiency green organic light<br>
emitting devices based on electrophosphorescence employing ortho metalized<br>
iridium complex (fac-tris{2-phenylpyridine) iridium) as a phosphorus light<br>
emitting material for improving properties of the organic EL device are proposed,<br>
(refer to. for example, D. F. O'Brien and M. A. Baldo et al "Improved energy<br>
transferring electrophosphorescent devices" AppHed Physics letters Vol.74 No.3,<br>
pp442-444, January 18, 1999; and M. A. Baldo et al "Very high-efficiency green<br><br>
organic light emitting devices based on electrophosphorescence" Applied Physics<br>
letters Vol. 75 No. 1, pp4-6, July 5, 1999).<br>
Because the current organic EL devices employing the phosphorus<br>
photoluminescence are limited to emitting only green Hght, coverage as the color<br>
display devices is narrow. Therefore, it has been demanded to develop organic<br>
EL devices which emit hght of different colors from green with improved light<br>
emission property. Regarding particularly with EL devices which emit blue hght,<br>
those having an external quantum yield exceeding 5 % is not reported yet.<br>
Accordingly, an improvement in the EL devices which emit blue hght, if possible,<br>
enables the display devices to display full colors or white hght resultantly<br>
advancing toward practical use of phosphorus light EL device greatly.<br>
Further, although International PCT Patent Publication No. WO<br>
02/15645 discloses following structures of ligands G\) and (B):<br>
Ri      R2<br>
RN^N<br><br>
(A)<br>
wherein Ri to Rs each independently represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen<br>
atom, an alkyl group, an aromatic group and an arylene group; and Ri' and R2'<br>
an aromatic group, which may bond each other;<br>
any practical synthesis example of real complex with the use of the Hgands is not<br>
described.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made to overcome the above problems and<br><br>
has an object of providing an organic EL device having an enhanced efficiency of<br>
hght emission and prolonged hfetime, and an object of providing a metal complex<br>
compound reaUzing it.<br>
As a result of intensive researches and studies to achieve the above object<br>
by the present inventors, it was found that the iridium complex proposed in the<br>
former patent hterature neither generates nor isolates stably in a case where R<br>
is H in the above Hgands (A) and (B) and that it is important for stably isolating<br>
the iridium complex to replace an atom on a side of N without forming a<br>
coordinate bond with a metal to an atom except a hydrogen atom. Then, the<br>
inventors designed hgands having various kinds of substituent on N, and<br>
succeeded in synthesizing iridium complex for the first time. Further, it was<br>
found that an employment of a metal complex compound having a partial<br>
structure represented by a following general formula (1) provides the EL device<br>
achieving an external quantum yield of 8 % and exhibits an enhanced efficiency<br>
of Ught emission not only in blue region but also about various phosphorus<br>
photoluminescence and prolonged lifetime, resultantly completing the present<br>
invention.<br>
Namely, the present invention provides a metal complex compound<br>
having a partial structure represented by a following general formula (I):<br><br>
( R3-C)<br>
(1)<br>
wherein R^ to R^ each independently represents a hydrogen atom, a cyano group.<br><br>
a nitro group, a halogen atom, a substituted or unsubatituted alkyl group having<br>
1 to 20 carbon atoms, a substituted or unsubatituted amino group, a substituted<br>
or unsubstituted alkoxyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, a substituted or<br>
unsubatituted alkylsilyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, a substituted or<br>
unsubstituted acyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms or a substituted or<br>
unsubstituted aromatic group having 1 to 30 carbon atoms; and a couple of R'<br>
and R2, a couple of R^ and R^, a couple of R^ and R^ and a couple of R* and R'^ may<br>
bond each other to form a ring structure;<br>
p and q each independently represents an integer of 0 to 3; p + q being 2 or 3;<br>
further, when p is an integer of 2 or greater, plural of R^ may bond each other to<br>
form a ring structure; when q is an integer of 2 or greater, plural of R^ may bond<br>
each other to form a ring structure; and<br>
M represents any one metal ^tom selected from iridium (Ir) atom, rhodium (Rh)<br>
atom, platinum (Pt) atom or palladium (Pd) atom.<br>
Further, the present invention provides an organic EL device which<br>
comprises at least one organic thin film layer sandwiched between a pair of<br>
electrode consisting of an anode and a cathode, wherein the organic thin film<br>
layer comprises the above metal complex compound, which emits light by<br>
applying an electric voltage between the pair of electrode.<br>
