NEEDLE CAPTURE MECHANISMS<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/633,413<br>
filed December 7, 2004, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Technical Field<br>
The subject invention relates to mechanisms that will effectively and safely capture a<br>
needle or other sharp object, thereby placing the needle or other sharp object in a state that<br>
makes accidental contact therewith unlikely or impossible.<br>
Background Art<br>
In the following discussion, certain articles and methods will be described for<br>
background and introductory purposes. Nothing contained herein is to be construed as an<br>
"admission" of prior art. Applicants expressly reserve the right to demonstrate, where<br>
appropriate, that the articles and methods referenced herein do not constitute prior art under the<br>
applicable statutory provisions.<br>
In recent years, there has been great concern over the contamination of clinicians with a<br>
patient's blood and a recognition that blood contaminated sharps must be disposed of to avoid an<br>
accidental needle stick. This concern has arisen because of the advent of currently incurable and<br>
fatal diseases, such as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ("AIDS"), which can be<br>
transmitted by the exchange of body fluids from an infected person to another person Thus,<br>
contact with the body fluids of an AIDS infected person must be avoided. As noted above, if a<br>
needle has been inserted into an AIDS infected person, the needle, via its sharp distal tip, is a<br>
vehicle for the transmission of the disease. Although clinicians are aware of the need to<br>
properly handle blood contaminated sharps, unfortunately, in certain medical environments such<br>
as emergency situations or as a result of inattention or neglect, needle sticks with a blood<br>
contaminated sharp still occur.<br>
As a result of the problem of accidental needle sticks by blood contaminated sharps,<br>
various needle shields have been developed. Such devices are disclosed in, for example, U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 5,601,536 and 4,994,041.<br>
Devices such as catheters, catheter introducers and guidewire introducers are all<br>
examples of the types of devices that can incorporate a needle or other sharp object therein.<br>
Catheters, particularly intravascualar (IV) catheters, are used for infusing fluid, such as normal<br>
saline solution, various medicaments and total paternal nutrition, into a patent, withdrawing<br><br>
blood from a patient or monitoring various parameters of the patient's vascular system.<br>
Peripheral IV catheters tend to be relatively short and, typically, are on the order of about two<br>
inches or less in length. The most common type o IV catheter is an over-the-needle peripheral<br>
IV catheter. As its name implies, an over-the-needle catheter is mounted over an introducer<br>
needle having a sharp distal tip. At least the distal portion of the catheter tightly engages the<br>
outer surface of the needle to prevent peelback of the catheter, thereby facilitating insertion of<br>
the catheter into the blood vessel. The catheter and the introducer needle are assembled so that<br>
the distal tip of the introducer needle extends beyond the distal tip of the catheter, with the bevel<br>
of the needle facing up away from the patient's skin.<br>
The catheter and introducer needle assembly is inserted at a shallow angle through the<br>
patient's skin into a blood vessel. There are many techniques for inserting such a catheter and<br>
introducer needle assembly into a patient. In one insertion technique, the introducer needle and<br>
catheter are inserted completely into the blood vessel together. In another technique, the<br>
introducer needle is partially withdrawn into the catheter after the initial insertion into the blood<br>
vessel. The catheter is then threaded over the needle and inserted completely into the blood<br>
vessel.<br>
To verify proper placement of the catheter in the blood vessel, the clinician confirms that<br>
there is flashback of blood in a flashback chamber. The flashback chamber is typically formed<br>
as part of the needle hub. Alternatively, where the introducer needle includes a notch, i.e., a<br>
hole or opening in the sidewall of the introducer needle, flashback of blood can be observed in<br>
the annular space between the introducer needle and the catheter, in the catheter adapter and,<br>
where the catheter is an integrated catheter, in an extension tube extending from a side arm<br>
formed in the catheter adapter. Once proper placement of the catheter into the blood vessel is<br>
confirmed, the clinician applies pressure to the blood vessel by pressing down on the patient's<br>
skin over the blood vessel distal to the introducer needle and catheter. This finger pressure<br>
occludes, or at least minimizes, further blood flow through the introducer needle and the<br>
catheter. The clinician then withdraws the introducer needle, leaving the catheter in place, and<br>
attaches an appropriate device to the catheter. Such a device can include a fluid delivery device,<br>
a PRN, a deadender cap or a blood pressure monitoring probe. Once the introducer needle is<br>
withdrawn from the catheter, the introducer needle is a blood contaminated sharp and must be<br><br>
properly handled.<br>
It would be desirable, in general, to provide a needle capture and shielding arrangement<br>
having an improved capture mechanism. For instance, some conventional needle capture<br>
mechanisms can require a relatively large amount of space within the apparatus into which it is<br>
incorporated. Moreover, some conventional needle capture mechanisms require the user to<br>
undertake specific steps or actions to activate the capture mechanism; such steps or measures are<br>
often not intuitive. Thus there is a need to provide relatively compact needle capture<br>
mechanisms that are easy to use.<br>
Disclosure Of The Invention<br>
Therefore, according to certain embodiments, the present invention comprises a device<br>
or method that provides one or more of the following features and advantages: a needle capture<br>
device and arrangement that is compact, simple and easy to use, requires no special features or<br>
techniques to be operative, and has a relatively low cost.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an arrangement<br>
comprising: a needle defining a longitudinal needle axis having a sharp distal tip, a shank<br>
portion, and a needle feature defining at least one localized area along the shank of increased<br>
outer diameter; a needle shield defining a longitudinal central axis, the needle shield comprising<br>
a proximal opening having a diameter great enough to permit passage of the needle shank<br>
therethrough, but small enough to prevent the needle feature from passing therethrough, a distal<br>
opening having a diameter great enough to allow both the needle shank and needle feature to<br>
pass therethrough, and an inner shoulder surface; and a biasing member adapted to exert a<br>
generally downward biasing force upon the needle; wherein the arrangement is constructed such<br>
that upon drawing the needle completely through the distal needle passage, the downward<br>
biasing force of the biasing element causes the needle to become angled downwardly such that<br>
the central axis and the needle axis diverge, and the sharp tip of the needle is forced out of<br>
registry with the distal needle passage and is trapped within the needle shield by the inner<br>
shoulder surface.<br><br>
According to the invention, the above-described arrangement further comprises: a<br>
catheter adapter having a proximal end; a catheter mounted within the catheter adapter; and an<br>
external coupling housing comprising a proximal end, the external coupling housing being<br>
received within the proximal end of the catheter adapter; and wherein the needle shield is<br>
received within the proximal end of the catheter adapter.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, the above-described needle shield<br>
is retained within the external coupling housing by one or more of the following: a folded tab,<br>
one or more areas of increased outer diameter along the external periphery of the needle shield,<br>
an adhesive, a frangible link and a mechanical fastener.<br>
According to the invention, the above-described biasing member comprises one or more<br>
of: a finger spring in the form of a folded tab cut from the sidewall of the needle shield, a<br>
mechanical spring; an elastomeric spring; a pneumatic element; and an electromechanical<br>
element.<br>
According to the invention, the above-described catheter adapter and external coupling<br>
housing are formed from a thermoplastic material, such as a polyamide, a<br>
polytetrafluoroethylene, a fluonnated ethylene propylene, a polyurethane, or a metallic material.<br>
According to the invention, the above-described needle feature comprises a crimp or a<br>
ferrule.<br>
According to the invention, the above-described arrangement is constructed such that the<br>
needle shield, having a needle captured therein is separable from one or more of the catheter<br>
adapter and the external coupling housing.<br>
According to another aspect, the present invention provides an arrangement comprising,<br>
a needle defining a longitudinal needle axis having a sharp distal tip, a shank portion, and a<br>
needle feature defining at least one localized area along the shank of increased outer diameter; a<br>
needle shield defining a longitudinal central axis, a proximal through-hole opening and a distal<br>
through-hole opening, the needle shield comprising a pocket formed therein having an inclined<br>
surface; a split collet disposed within the pocket, the split collet having a variable inner bore;<br>
and a biasing element disposed within the pocket for biasing the split collet toward the inclined<br>
surface of the pocket; wherein the arrangement is constructed such that as the needle is drawn in<br>
toward the interior of the needle shield, the needle feature comes into contact with the split<br><br>
collet, which causes compression of the biasing element such that the split collet no longer<br>
contacts the inclined pocket surface and the inner bore of the split collet is expanded, thereby<br>
allowing passage of the needle feature through the split collet with a predetermined degree of<br>
interference therewith, and further as the sharp distal tip of the needle is completely withdrawn<br>
into the needle shield housing, the needle feature passes out of the inner bore of the split collet,<br>
thereby removing the aforementioned compression of the biasing element, which causes the split<br>
collet to once again be biased against the mclined surface, this also causes the inner bore of the<br>
spht collet to constrict such that it is once again smaller in diameter than the distal through-hole<br>
opening, as well as the outer diameter of the needle feature, thereby preventing the sharp distal<br>
tip of the needle from exiting the needle shield housing<br>
According to the invention, the above-described needle shield and/or split collet is<br>
formed from a thermoplastic material, such as a polyamide, a polytetrafluoroethylene, a<br>

received within the proximal end of the catheter adapter.<br><br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of making a<br>
needle safe, the needle comprising a longitudinal axis comprising a sharp distal tip, a shank<br>
portion, and a needle feature defining at least one localized area along the shank of increased<br>
outer diameter, the method comprising: providing a needle shield defining a longitudinal central<br>
axis and comprising a proximal opening having a diameter great enough to permit passage of the<br>
needle shank therethrough, but small enough to prevent the needle feature from passing<br>
therethrough, and a distal opening having a diameter great enough to allow both the needle<br>
shank and needle feature to pass therethrough, and an inner shoulder surface; providing a biasing<br>
member adapted to exert a generally downward biasing force upon the needle; drawing the<br>
needle completely through the distal needle passage; applying a downward biasing force on the<br>
needle with the biasing member causing the needle to become angled downwardly such that the<br>
central axis and the needle axis diverge, and forcing the sharp tip of the needle out of registry<br>
with the distal needle passage thereby trapping the needle within the needle shield by the inner<br>
shoulder surface.<br>
According to yet another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of making a<br>
needle safe, the needle comprising a longitudinal axis comprising a sharp distal tip, a shank<br>
portion, and a needle feature defining at least one localized area along the shank of increased<br>
outer diameter, the method comprising: providing a needle shield defining a longitudinal central<br>
axis, a proximal through-hole opening and a distal through-hole opening, and comprising a<br>
pocket formed therein comprising an inclined surface; locating a split collet within the pocket<br>
having a variable inner bore; and disposing a biasing element within the pocket for biasing the<br>
split collet toward the inclined surface of the pocket; drawing the needle toward the interior of<br>
the needle shield such that the needle feature comes into contact with the split collet;<br>
compressing the biasing element such that the split collet no longer contacts the inclined pocket<br>
surface and the inner bore of the split collet is expanded, thereby allowing passage of the needle<br>
feature through the split collet with a predetermined degree of interference therewith; further<br>
drawing the needle such that the needle feature passes out of the inner bore of the split collet<br>
thereby removing the aforementioned compression of the biasing element, which causes the split<br>
collet to once again be biased against the inclined surface, and also causing the inner bore of the<br>
split collet to constrict such that it is once again smaller in diameter than the distal through-hole<br><br>
opening as well as the outer diameter of the needle feature, thereby preventing the sharp distal<br>

Modes For Carrying Out The Invention<br>
The principles of the present invention will now be further described by the following<br>
discussion of certain illustrative embodiments thereof and by reference to the foregoing drawing<br>
figures.<br>
As used herein, the term "proximal" refers to a location on the catheter and introducer<br>
needle assembly with needle shield of this invention that, during normal use, is closest to the<br>
clinician using the device and farthest from the patient in connection with whom the device is<br>
used. Conversely, the term "distal" refers to a location on the catheter and introducer needle<br>
assembly of this invention that, during normal use, is farthest from the clinician using the device<br>
and closest to the patient in connection with whom the device is used.<br>
As used herein, the term "top," "up" or "upwardly" refers to a location on the catheter<br>
and introducer needle assembly with needle shield of this invention that, during normal use, is<br>
radially away from the longitudinal axis of the device and away from the patient's skin.<br>
Conversely, as used herein, the term "bottom," "down" or "downwardly" refers to a location on<br>
the catheter and introducer needle assembly of this invention that, during normal use, is radially<br>
away from the longitudinal axis of the device and toward the patient's skm.<br>
As used herem, the term "in" or "inwardly" refers to a location with respect to the<br>
catheter and introducer needle assembly with needle shield of this invention that, during normal<br>
use, is toward the inside of the device. Conversely, as used herein, the term "out" or<br>
"outwardly" refers to a location with respect to the catheter and introducer needle assembly of<br>
this invention that, during normal use, is toward the outside of the device.<br><br>
As used herein, the term "needle" refers to a member having at least one relatively sharp<br>
end. The member may be either hollow or solid in cross-section. The member may have any<br>
number of suitable dimensions and/or geometries.<br>
The present invention is described herein using the same reference numbers for like<br>
elements in the different embodiments. Although this invention is described herein in<br>
connection with various devices and assemblies, it is to be understood that this invention is<br>
usable alone and is also applicable to other devices. For example, this invention is applicable to<br>
standard IV catheters and extended dwell catheters requiring the needle to be connected to the<br>
needle hub by a stylet, as well as other medical devices where it is desirable for a needle to be<br>
shielded after use such as anesthesia needles, epidural needles, catheter introducers and<br>
hypodermic syringes.<br>
A first illustrative embodiment of the present invention is depicted in FIGS. 1-5. As best<br>
illustrated in FIGS. 1-3, this embodiment can be identified generally as an over-the-needle<br>
catheter assembly 10. The assembly 10 defines a central longitudinal axis AC. The catheter<br>
assembly 10 includes a catheter 12 mounted within a catheter adapter 14. The proximal end 15<br>
of the catheter adapter 14 receives an external coupling housing member 16 therein.<br>
A needle shield 18 is also mcluded in the catheter assembly 10. The needle shield 18 is<br>
received within the proximal end 17 of the external couplmg housing 16. The needle shield 18<br>
is optionally provided with a retention means 30, which acts to secure the needle shield 18<br>
within the external couplmg housing 16. According to the illustrated embodiment, the retention<br>
means 30 is in the form of a folded tab cut out of a sidewall of the needle shield 18 It is within<br>
the scope of the present invention that alternative constructions for retaining the needle shield 18<br>
are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. For example, the needle shield 18<br>
may be provided with one or more areas of increased outer diameter along the periphery thereof<br>
(not shown), which would also act to secure the needle shield 18 within the external coupling<br>
housing 16. Moreover, various adhesives and/or mechanical fasteners and/or frangible links<br>
may be utilized as the retention means to accomplish the same functionality.<br><br>
As illustrated, for example, in FIG. 3, the assembly 10 further includes a needle 20<br>
concentrically disposed within the catheter 12. The needle 20 defines a longitudinal axis AN<br>
extendmg therethrough.<br>
According to the illustrated embodiment, the needle 20 comprises a shank 22 having a<br>
needle feature 24 provided thereon. The needle feature 24 provides the shank 22, on at least a<br>
portion thereof, with a localized area of increased outer diameter. In this regard, numerous<br>
physical constructions for providing this area of increased outer diameter are envisioned. For<br>
example, the needle feature 24 may comprise a crimp in the shank 22 of the needle 20, thereby<br>
defining a localized area of increased outer diameter, relative to adjacent sections of the needle<br>
shank 22. Alternatively, the needle feature 24 may comprise a ferrule. The ferrule can comprise<br>
either a separate member fixably attached to the shank 22 or an integral portion of mcreased<br>
diameter such that the shank and ferrule comprise a one-piece monolithic part. The term<br>
"ferrule"' as utilized herein is intended to encompass each of the above-described alternative<br>
constructions.<br>
The above-described components of the assembly 10 can be formed from any suitable<br>
material or combinations of different materials. For example, the catheter adapter 14 and the<br>
external coupling housing 16 can be made of similar or different thermoplastic materials.<br>
Suitable materials mclude polyamide, polytetrafluoroethylene, fluonnated ethylene propylene,<br>
polyurethane and the like. The needle shield 18 can also be formed of any suitable material,<br>
such as a metallic material or any of the above-described thermoplastic materials<br>
The assembly 10 further comprises a biasing member for exerting a biasing force on the<br>
needle 20. When constructed of a metallic material, it is convenient that the needle shield 18 be<br>
provided with an integral biasing member 38. According to the illustrated embodiment, the<br>
biasing member 38 includes a finger-spring element, which is formed by cutting and folding the<br>
side-wall of the needle shield 18. It should be understood, however, that many different biasing<br>
elements are envisioned by the present invention. Any suitable mechanical spring member<br>
could be substituted. Alternatively, a metal or plastic clip, elastomenc and/or magnetic biasing<br>
elements are possible.<br><br>
Operation of the illustrated embodiment of the present invention will now be described<br>
by reference to FIGS. 3-5. As illustrated in FIG. 3, the shank 22 of the needle 20 is disposed<br>
within the catheter 12, extends therethrough and passes through the coupling housing needle<br>
passage 32. The shank 22 continues and extends to both the proximal and distal openings 34<br>
and 36, respectively, of the needle shield 18 (see, e.g., FIG 1). As the needle 20 extends<br>
through the needle shield 18, the biasing element 38 is in contact with the shank 22 and exerts a<br>
generally downward biasing force thereon. In the state illustrated in FIG. 3, it is evident that the<br>
central axis AC and the longitudinal axis of the needle AN substantially coincide.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 4, as the needle 20 is withdrawn in the proximal direction, the<br>
shank 22 is withdrawn from the catheter 12 and eventually passes completely through the<br>
coupling housing needle passage 32, as well as the distal needle passage 36 of the needle shield<br>
18. In this state, the sharp tip 26 of the needle 20 is located entirely within the confines of the<br>
needle shield 18. Once the needle 20 has been completely withdrawn through the couplmg<br>
housing needle passage 32 and the distal needle passage 36, the downward biasing force of the<br>
biasing element 38 causes the needle to become angled downwardly such that the central axis<br>
AC and the needle axis AN diverge and no longer coincide. As illustrated in FIG. 4, the sharp<br>
tip 26 of the needle 20 is forced out of registry with the distal needle passage 36 and the<br>
coupling housing needle passage 32 by the downward force of the biasing element 38. The<br>
sharp tip 26 of the needle 20 is trapped within the needle shield 18 by inner shoulder surface 40<br>
thereby preventing unwanted movement of the needle 20 in the distal direction. Moreover,<br>
unwanted movement of the needle 20 in the proximal direction is also prevented by virtue of the<br>
fact that the needle feature 24, having at least a localized area of increased outer diameter,<br>
prevents further passage of the needle shank 22 through the proximal needle passage 34 of the<br>
needle shield 18. In other words, the inner diameter of the proximal needle passage 34 is<br>
smaller then the outer diameter of the needle feature 24. Thus, it is evident that the needle 20<br>
has been made safe within the needle shield 18.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 5, the external coupling housing 16, with the needle shield 18 and<br>
captured needle 20 contained therein, can be jointly removed from the catheter adapter 14 for<br>
safe and convenient disposal. Alternatively, the needle shield 18 may be separable from the<br><br>
external coupling housing.<br>
While the principles of this embodiment of the present invention have been described by<br>
reference to a specific illustrated embodiment, it should be understood that the scope of this<br>
embodiment of the present invention is not confined .thereto. Namely, the needle capture<br>
mechanism of this embodiment of the present invention can be generally described as follows.<br>
A needle shield is constructed to permit a needle to be at least partially drawn therethrough.<br>
When the sharp tip of the needle has been drawn completely within the confines of the needle<br>
shield, a downwardly acting biasing force acts to push the needle in a direction that causes a<br>
change in the angular orientation of its longitudinal axis. This change in the angular orientation<br>
of the longitudinal axis of the needle, coupled with the physical construction of the needle<br>
shield, prevents the sharp tip of the needle from exiting one end of the needle shield. In<br>
addition, the needle is provided with a feature that, in conjunction with the construction of the<br>
needle shield, prevents further undesired movement of the needle out of the opposing end of the<br>
needle shield.<br>
A second embodiment of a needle capture mechanism and arrangement formed<br>
according to the principles of the present mvention is depicted in FIGS. 6-9. As illustrated, for<br>
example, in FIG. 6, a needle shield arrangement 100 comprises a needle shield housing 102<br>
having a proximal through-hole opening 104, a distal through-hole opening 106, and defining a<br>
longitudinal central axis AC. A needle shield housing 102 is formed with a pocket 108 that is<br>
defined, at least in part, by an inclined surface 110, a radially-extending pocket surface 112, and<br>
an interconnecting longitudinal surface 114. The needle shield housing 102 can be formed from<br>
any suitable material, such as a metal or a thermoplastic material of the type identified in the<br>
description of the first embodiment.<br>
A needle 116 is received through the proximal through-hole opening 104, as well as the<br>
distal through-hole opening 106. The needle 116 comprises a shank portion 118, as well as a<br>
needle feature 120 disposed thereon. The needle feature 120 provides at least a localized area of<br>
mcreased outer diameter. Numerous constructions are envisioned as being capable of providing<br>
this feature. For example, the needle feature 120 may comprise a crimp in the wall of the<br>
needle, thereby providing a localized area of mcreased outer diameter. Alternatively, the needle<br><br>
feature 120 may comprise a ferrule. As used herein, the term "ferrule" refers to a separate<br>
member fixably attached to the shank portion 118 of the needle 116, thereby providing at least a<br>
localized area of increased outer diameter. In addition, the term "ferrule" is intended to<br>
encompass a construction wherein the ferrule comprises an integral part of the shank 118,<br>
thereby defining a one-piece monolithic construction composed of both the needle feature 120<br>
and the shank portion 118. The needle 116 further comprises a sharp distal tip 122.<br>
The assembly 100 further comprises a split collet 124 disposed within the'pocket 108 of<br>
the needle shield housing 102. The split collet 124 is generally in the form of an annular ring<br>
member. According to the illustrated embodiment, the split collet 124 comprises a distal lead-in<br>
chamfered surface 126, an inner bore 128, and a proximal radially-extending surface 130. The<br>
split collet can be formed from any suitable material, such as a metal or a thermoplastic of the<br>
type identified in connection with the description of the first embodiment<br>
A biasing element 132 is also located within the pocket 108 and is disposed generally<br>
between the proximal pocket surface 112 and the proximal radially-extending surface 130 of the<br>
split collet 124. The biasing element 132 can comprise many different types of elements<br>
According to the illustrated embodiment, the biasing element 132 is schematically illustrated as<br>
a mechanical spring member. Further constructions are comprehended. For example, the<br>
biasing element 132 may comprise a metal or plastic clip, an elastomeric element or a magnetic<br>
element.<br>
As noted above, the collet 124 has a split annular configuration. This split annular<br>
configuration allows for a predetermined degree of expansion and contraction of the inner<br>
diameter, as defined by the inner bore 128. As illustrated in FIGS. 7A-7B, the split collet 124<br>
can be in the form of a single piece ring or multiple arcuate segments.<br>
FIG. 7A is illustrative of a split collet 124' in the form of a plurality of arcuate segments<br>
51	and S2. While this embodiment of the split collet 124' is shown as comprising two arcuate<br>
segments, it should be understood that it is possible to construct the split collet from three or<br>
more such arcuate segments. As further illustrated in FIG. 7A, each of the arcuate segments SI,<br>
52	has interfitting ends E'l and E'2, respectively, which permit the aforementioned expansion<br><br>
and contraction of the inner diameter of the split collet 124. In the illustrated embodiment, these<br>
mterfitting ends E' 1 and E'2 are in the form of a staircase-type geometry. It is envisioned,<br>
however, that numerous other geometries may be provided to the interfitting ends, so long as the<br>
desired expansion and contraction of the inner diameter of the split collet 124 can be<br>
" accommodated.<br>
FIG. 7B is illustrative of an alternative construction of the split collet which comprises a<br>
single piece split ring 124". The one-piece ring 124" has a split end configuration SE.<br>
According to the illustrated example, the split end SE has a first and second mating end<br>
configuration E' 1 and E"2. Once again, the end constructions E" 1 and E"2 are shown in the<br>
form of a staircase-type geometry, which permits the desired expansion and contraction of the<br>
inner diameter of the split collet 124". As noted above, however, numerous other geometrical<br>
configurations are contemplated, so long as they accommodate the desired expansion and<br>
contraction of the inner diameter of the split collet 124".<br>
The operation of this embodiment of the present invention will now be described by<br>
reference to drawings FIGS. 6, 8 and 9. As illustrated in FIG. 6, in a state in which the sharp<br>
distal tip 122 of the needle 116 is disposed entirely outside of the needle shield housing 102, the<br>
split collet 124 is urged in a forward, or distal, direction under the action of the biasing element<br>
132. As the split collet 124 is forced against the inclined surface 110 under the action of the<br>
biasing element 132, the split collet 124 is radially compressed; thereby reducing the inner<br>
diameter as defined by the inner bore 128. As illustrated in FIG. 6, in this state, the inner bore<br>
128 defines a diameter smaller than the distal through-hole opening 106, and is smaller than the<br>
outer diameter of the needle feature 120.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates the arrangement 100 in a state in which the needle 116 has been<br>
partially drawn into the needle shield housing 102 in the proximal direction. As the needle 116<br>
is withdrawn in the proximal direction, the needle feature 120 comes into contact with the<br>
chamfered lead-in surface 126 of the split collet 124. This contact causes compression of the<br>
biasing element 132 such that the split collet no longer contacts the inclined pocket surface 110.<br>
In the state illustrated in FIG. 8, the inner diameter of the split collet 124, as defined by the inner<br>
bore 128, is permitted to expand. This allows for passage of the needle feature 120 through the<br><br>
inner bore 128 with a degree of interference therewith.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 9, as the sharp distal tip 122 of the needle 116 is completely<br>
withdrawn into the needle shield housing 102, the needle feature 120 passes out of the inner bore<br>
128 of the split collet 124, thereby removing the aforementioned compression of the biasing<br>
element 132, which causes the split collet 124 to be once again urged against the inclined pocket<br>
surface 110, thereby contracting the inner diameter as defined by the inner bore 128. The inner<br>
bore 128 is once again smaller in diameter than the outer diameter of the needle feature 120. In<br>
addition, the diameter defined by the bore of the proximal through-hole opening 104 is smaller<br>
than the outer diameter of the needle feature 120. Given these relative dimensions, it is evident<br>
that the needle feature 120 is trapped between the proximal pocket surface 112 and the proximal<br>
radially extending surface 130. Thus, the needle 116 trapped in a positioned such that the sharp<br>
distal tip 122 is located within the needle shield housing 102.<br>
While this invention is satisfied by embodiments in many different forms, as described in<br>
detail in connection with preferred embodiments of the invention, it is understood that the<br>
present disclosure is to be considered as exemplary of the principles of the invention and is not<br>
intended to limit the invention to the specific embodiments illustrated and described herein.<br>
