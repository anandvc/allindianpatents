ASSIGNEE; HINDUSTAN ZINC LIMITED "YASHAD BHAWAN" UDAlPUR-31300li RAJASTHAN, INDIA<br>
Recovery of metal values from Hot Gas Precipitator dust (HGP dust) of pyrometallurgical Lead-Zinc extraction plant<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION; The present invention relates to a recovery of metal values from by-product generated during pyrometallurgical treatment of lead and Zinc concentrate and particularly relates to dissolution of base metal through oxidizing acid leaching followed by precipitation of dissolved metal to produce high grade material.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION;<br>
Hindustan Zinc Ltd (HZL), a part of Vedanta pic, has a Pyro metallurgical lead and Zinc extraction plant (Unit I) at Chanderia Lead Zinc Smelter. The zinc and lead concentrate received from mines is mixed with flux etc and charged in to a sinter machine to produce lumpy masses containing oxides of zinc and lead. This sintered product is charged in to Imperial Smelting Furnace (ISF) for zinc and lead recovery.<br>
Hot gases generated during sintering are loaded with dust. The dust loaded gas is passed through an electrostatic precipitator where the gas is cleaned of dust particles. The dust so collected is called HGP dust. Although, this intermediate product contains approximately 58-62 % of lead, it can not be recycled in the main stream due to its high cadmium content (4-6%).<br>
No significant research has been reported to recover base metal values from a dust characteristically similar to sinter plant of Chanderia Lead Zinc Smelter. The present invention is aimed to propose a simple two stage process scheme developed by extensive research activities to recover base metal values from HGP dust or a dust having similar characteristics.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION;<br>
The HGP dust treatment process is developed by HZL through its research and development efforts to produce a cadmium sponge and recovering of lead and silver values from left out residue. The process is basically a two stage leaching and precipitation process.<br>
In a single aspect, the process hereby claimed consists of the following steps:<br>
1.	Leaching of HGP dust as the first step with oxidizing acid to dissolve cadmium as<br>
cadmium sulphate.<br>
2.	Separation of the undissolved residue of lead by filtration with water washing<br>
treatment and precipitation of cadmium rich solution by slowly adding zinc dust<br>
to produce high quality cadmium sponge.<br>
Cadmium sponge thus produced contains 65-90 % Cd, 0.5-15 % Zn, 400 - 700 ppm Pb and 40-80 ppm Fe. This sponge is amenable to different hydrometallurgical or pyrometallurgical processes to produce cadmium metal or can be sold as such.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS;<br>
Figure 1 is a Process Flow Diagram of Leaching and Precipitation circuit of HOP dust treatment.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION;<br>
As described in Figure 1, HOP dust is leached in the first process stage with the oxidizing acid which is prepared by mixing the sulphuric acid and hydrogen peroxide (both are cooled at 
As depicted in Figure 1, zinc dust is slowly added in cadmium sulphate solution to precipitate high quality cadmium sponge. The acidity of the solution is kept between 2 -50 gpl to optimize the zinc percentage in the cadmium sponge. The ratio of cadmium in the solution to zinc dust addition is kept at 1: 0.6 to 1.2 for higher cadmium recovery.<br>
The sponge thus produced primarily consists of mainly cadmium, zinc and is amenable for different hydro / pyrometallurgical processes or can be saleable as such. The present invention can be applied to any dust of similar nature. The present invention is also advantageous in terms of process simplicity as it is two stage process of leaching and precipitation.<br>
The different stages of development work to obtain the process claimed hereby are given below:<br>
SECTION 1 (Raw Material Characteristic)<br>
The HOP dust samples generated from sinter plant of CLZS were thoroughly mixed and representative samples were made which have been the materials subjected to Test work and Engineering, leading to the present invention. The chemical analysis of HGP dust is tabulated in table no 1.<br>

SECTION 4 (Amenability of cadmium sponge for Metal Extraction)<br>

We Claim:<br>
1.	A process for the recovery of valuable metals from HOP dust comprising<br>
Sulfides/Sulphates/Oxides of the metals.<br>
The process consists of:<br>
Leaching of HOP dust with oxidizing acid to dissolve cadmium as cadmium sulphate. Separation of the undissolved lead residue with water washing treatment followed by precipitation of cadmium sulphate solution by slowly adding zinc dust to produce cadmium sponge.<br>
2.	A process as claimed in Claim 1, which is believed to be capable of successful<br>
application in treating dust of having similar characteristic. Necessary adjustments<br>
and  modifications are to  be  incorporated  depending on  the  Raw  Material<br>
specifications and Project economics.<br>
3.	A process as claimed in Claim 1, which can be applied to produce a high grade<br>
cadmium   sponge.   This   sponge   can   be   further   treated   via   a   suitable<br>
hydrometallurgical (acid leaching followed by electrolysis) or pyrometallurgical<br>
process to extract high grade cadmium metal (Cd - 99.95%). The achievable<br>
sponge quality and process economics will be the key determining factors for<br>
Technology selection.<br>
4.	Process as claimed in Claim 3, this sponge can be directly converted in to<br>
cadmium   metal   after   briquetting   and   melting   at   a   suitable   temperature.<br>
Briquetting pressure 10 - 100 bar and melting temperature 350-600°C.<br></td>
