THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"PRODUCTION PROCESS OP 1,2-DIHYDROPYRIDINE COMPOUNDS"<br>
EISAI  CO.,  LTD.,  of 6-10,  Koishikawa 4-chome,  Bunkyo-ky,  Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
22-5-2006<br>
21 APR 2006<br><br>
The present application relates to production process of 1, 2-dihydropynding compounds.<br>
The present invention relates to a novel compound, a salt thereof and hydrates thereof, and to a method for manufacturing the same. More specifically, it relates to a pyridone compound, a salt thereof and hydrates thereof which are useful as inhibitors to non-NMDA receptors, particularly to AMPA receptor.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Glutamate and aspartate are important amino acids which participate in nerve functions such as recognition, memory, 'movement, respiration, cardiovascular adjustment and sensation and are called excitatory neurotransmitters as well. In the expression of their physiological activities, an interaction with a specific receptor is important and, generally, two types of receptors - an ion channel type and a G-protein coupled type - have been known. The former is further classified into N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor, kainate receptor, etc. on the onter hand; the amino acid as an excitatory neurotransmitter has been known to induce<br><br>
neurotoxicity by, for example, abnormal excitation of central "nerves. It has been noted that the said toxicity is as serious as being accompanied by the death of nerve cells causing various nervous diseases. Main nervous diseases which have been known are cerebral ischemia, head injury, spinal cord injury, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) , Huntington's chorea, AIDS nervous disturbance, epilepsy, neurodegenaration observed after the state of hypoxia, mental disorder, mobility disturbance, pain, spasticity, nervous disturbance by toxin in food, various neurodegenerative diseases, various mental diseases, chronic pain, migraine, cancer pain and pain caused by diabetic nervous disturbance. They are serious diseases where many mechanisms of onset, etc. have not been clarified yet and pharmaceutical agents which are effective for the therapy have not been found yet but it is believed that they are closely related to excessive release/accumulation of excitatory neurotransmitters, changes in expressing pattern of receptors, etc. For example, it has been reported that glutamate concentration in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma increases in stroke, cerebral ischemia, head injury and spinal cord injury (Castillo, J., Dazalos, A. and Noya, M., Lancet, 1997, 346:79-83; etc.). There is a report that neuropathy occurs when glutamate, NMDA, AMPA, kainate, etc. are excessively applied to nerve cells (Meldrum, B., Brain Res. Reviews, 18, 293, 1993). There are reports that, in Alzheimer' s disease, (3-amyloid protein enhances the neurotoxicity of<br><br>
glutamate and that it promotes the release of glutamate (Arias, C, Arrieta, I. and Tapia, R., J. Neurosci. Res., 1995, 41:561-566; etc.) . In the case of Parkinson's disease, there are reports that L-dopa hydroxide activates the AMPA receptor (Cha, J. J., et. al., Neurosci. Lett., 1991, 132:55-58) and enhances the neurotoxicity (Olney, J. W., et. al., 1990, 108:269-272; Rosenberg, P. A., et. al. , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1991, 88:4865-4869) . There is another report that L-dopa promotes the generation of free radicals resulting in a rise of oxidative stress (Smith, T. S., et. al., Neuroreport, 1994, 5:1009-1011).  In the case of Huntington's chorea, it is reported that a substance which inhibits the release of glutamate is effective in improving the symptoms.  In the case of ALS, there are many reports showing the participation of glutamate in its pathology. There are some cases where the AIDS patients suffer from recognition nerve function deficiency and, even in such a nerve disease, participation of glutamate is suggested. For example, it is reported that gp 120 which is a glycoprotein in an envelope of HIV virus suppresses the uptake of glutamate by astrocytes (Dreyer, E. B., Eur. J. Neurosci., 1995, 7:2502-2507; Ushijima, H., et. al., Eur. J. Neurosci., 1995, 7:1353-1359) while a substance which inhibits the release of glutamate suppresses the neurodegenerationby gp 120 (Sindou, P., et. al., J. Neurosci. 1994, 126:133-137; Muller, W. E. G., et. al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. Molec. Pharmacol., 1992, 226:209-214; Lipton, S. A., Neurology, 1992, 42:1403-1405).<br><br>
With regard to allergic encephalomyelitis, there is a report that, in the mice where the said inflammation takes place, enzyme which decomposes glutamate incorporated from outside of cells is deficient (Hardin-Pouzet, H., Glia., 1997, 20:79-85). Olivopontocerebellar atrophy is a disease which is sometimes combined with Parkinson' s disease and an antibody to GluR2 which is a subunit constituting the AMPA receptor has been found (Gahring, L. C. , Neurology, 1997, 48:494-500) and the relation between olivopontocerebellar atrophy and AMPA receptor is suggested. With regard to a report for epilepsy, it is reported that, in the mice which are unable to construct the GluR2 in AMPA receptor, Ca2+ permeability of the AMPA receptor increases whereby it is apt to cause a sudden onset resulting in death Brusa, R. , Science, 1995, 270:1677-1680). Besides the above, it is reported that NBQX (2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenz[f]quinoxaline; Sheardown, etal., Science, 247, 571, 1990) and other inhibiting compounds to AMPA receptors have antianxiety and anticonvulsant action (J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 260, 742, 1992; Pharmacol. Biochem. Behavior, 1998, 60:119-124) and there are also reports for the connection of AMPA receptor/kainate receptor with urinary disturbance, drug abuse, pain, etc. (J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 280, 894-904, 1997; Neuroscience Letters, 268:127-130, 1999).<br>
It can be expected that the substances showing an antagonistic action to excitatory neurotransmitter receptors are useful for the therapy of the above-mentioned nerve diseases .<br><br>
At present, the usefulness of the substances having an antagonistic action to non-NMDA receptors such as AMPA receptor and kainate receptor is particularly expected. For example, it is reported that inhibitors of the interaction of glutamate with the AMPA and/or kainate receptor complex are useful in treating demyelinating disorders such as encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, acute demyelinating polyneuropathy (Guillain Barre syndrome), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, multiple sclerosis, Marchifava-Bignami disease, central pontine myelinolysis, Devic syndrome, Balo disease, HIV- or HTLV-myelopathy, progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy, a secondary demyelinating disorder; for example, CNS lupus erythematodes, polyarteritis nodosa, Sjogren syndrome, sarcoidosis, isolated cerebral vasculitis, etc. as secondary demyelinating disorders, etc. in WO00/01376. With regard to the compound having an inhibitory action to AMPA receptor and kainate receptor, there are reports for the following compounds for example.<br>
(1) Competitive AMPA receptor-inhibiting compounds represented by the following formulae.<br><br><br>
(2) Non-competitive AMPA receptor-inhibiting compounds represented by the following formulae.<br><br><br>
(3) Besides the above, there are reports on competitive AMPA receptor-inhibiting compounds having a quinoxalinedione skeleton in WO 94/25469, WO 96/10023, US 5356902, etc. and there are reports on non-competitive AMPA receptor-inhibiting compounds in WO 95/01357, WO 97/28135, WO 97/18163, WO 97/43276,<br><br>
IWO 97/34878, WO 98/38173, EP 802195, DE 19643037, etc.<br>
On the other hand, with regard to 1,2-dihydropyridine compounds, there have been several reports for them such as the compounds represented by the formula<br><br>
[in the formula, R is a hydrogen atom, a C1-6 alkyl group, a C2-6 alkenyl group, a C2-6 alkynyl group, a C1-6  alkoxy group, etc.; V is CH or N; W is O or S; X is a phenyl group which is unsubstituted or substituted with one or more group (s) selected from a C1-6 alkyl group, CF3, acyanogroup, anitrogroup, halogen, etc. or an aromatic hetero group which is substituted with one or more group (s) selected from a C1-6 alkyl group, CF3, halogen, etc.; Y is a hydrogen atom, a C1-6 alkyl group, a C2-6 alkenyl group, a C2.6 alkynyl group, an aryl group, etc.; and Z is halogen, a C3-6 cycloalkyl group, a C1-6alkylthio group, a C2-6 alkenylthio group, an aryl group, etc.] or salts thereof as a ligand for<br>
GABAAa subunit in WO 98/55480 and the compounds represented by the formula<br><br>
[in the formula, n is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5; X is a hydrogen atom, a C1-4 alkyl group, a C1-4 alkoxy group, a trif luoromethyl group, a trifluoromethoxy group or halogen; A is an amino group, a C1-4^lkylamino group, a Cx_4 dialkylamino group, a morpholino group, a piperidino group or a pyrrolidine group] useful for therapy of epilepsy in WO 00/07988 but their connection with AMPA receptor and kainate receptor has not been known at all.<br>
As such, there has been a brisk demand for the compounds which inhibit AMPA receptor/kainate receptor and are useful as pharmaceutical agents. However, the compounds which exhibit an excellent inhibiting action to AMPA receptor and/or kainate receptor and are highly useful as pharmaceutical agents effectively acting in clinical field have not been found yet. Thus, an object of the present invention is to investigate and find a compound which inhibits AMPA receptor and/or kainate receptor which suppresses the neurotoxicity of excitatory neurotransmitters and achieves an excellent neuroprotective action as pharmaceutical agents being useful as therapeutic/preventing/improving agents for various nerve diseases.<br>

Test Example l.<br>
The suppressing action of the compounds of the present invention to calcium influx into nerve cells induced by AMPA was investigated using the primary culture system of nerve cells of cerebral cortex of embryo of rat. Culturing Conditions:<br>
Cerebral cortex was cut out from the brain of rat of gestational 18 days and treated with trypsin and DNase to disperse the cells. The cells were flown by MEM containing 10% of serum, sown in a culture bottle and astrocytes were proliferated. The astrocytes were re-dispersed by trypsin and sown in a 96-well plate. After incubation for one week, it was confirmed that the astrocytes covered all over the bottom and then the nerve cells of cerebral cortex which was dispersed by the above method were sown thereupon. After incubation for 24 hours, the medium was changed, the incubation was carried out for one week and, after that, the medium was changed to that containing luM of MK-801. Nerve cells which were incubated for not shorter than 8 to 10 days were used. Suppressing Action to Calcium Influx into Nerve Cells Induced<br><br><br>
by AMPA<br>
Calcium influx into the cells was measured using Fura2 -AM which was a calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye. It was treated in a medium containing Fura2-AM for 1 hour, incorporated into the cells, exchanged to a Tyrode solution containing luM MK-801 and stimulation was carried out using 2|uM AMPA. Change in the amount of calcium flown into the cells were measured as the change in the fluorescent intensity at the exciting wave length of 340/380 nm. Effect of the test compound was evaluated using the reaction resulted in the AMPA added to a Tyrode solution containing no compound as a control. Results are shown in Tables 1 to 3.<br>
GYKI 52446 (Le Peillet, et al., Brain Res., 571, 115, 1992) was used as a control compound.  IC50 of GYKI 52466 was 9.02UM.<br>
Test Example 2. Anticonvulsant Action Induced by AMPA<br>
A test compound was suspended in a 0.5% methyl cellulose solution or in sesame oil and was orally administered (25 mg/kg) to male mice of ddy strain. After 30 minutes or 1 hour from the oral administration, AMPA was continuously injected (2 nmole/5ul/minute/mouse) into lateral ventricle to induce the convulsions. The effect was judged by a time-extending action until the convulsion takes place by a continuous injection of AMPA. Results<br><br>
The compound represented by the above formula (I) according to the present invention showed an excellent anticonvulsant action. For example, the compounds of Examples 4, 7, 9, 12, 16, 32, 41, 47, 57, 61, 76, 78, 91, 126, 128, 137, 139, 164, 199, 261, 262, 264, 270 and 298 showed a significant anticonvulsant action. Test example 3 Occlusion model of midcerebral arteries<br>
The usefulness of the compound related to the present invention in the remedy of cerebral vascular accident acute stage was confirmed by the test below. Namely, the cerebral bloodstream of midcerebral arteries was blocked by inserting a nylon suture thread of 4-0 specification whose edge was crashed with flame, by 17mm from the branch of internal carotid artery, through internal carotid artery from the external carotid artery of a male Spfange Dawley rat, and cerebral infarction was prepared (Zea Longa et al., Storke 20:84-91, 1989) . The size of the cerebral infarction was evaluated by preparing the intersection slice of brain having a thickness of 2mm and measuring the area of a portion which was not stained by TTC staining. The effect of the tested substance was carried out in this model by comparing the infarction nidus size between a group treated with a solvent and a group treated with the tested substance.<br>
As a result, the compound related to the present invention revealed an excellent effect as the therapeutic agent of<br><br><br>
cerebral vascular accident acute stage. Test ExamplP 4 Antimethamohetamine effect<br>
(S) -( + )-N, a-dimethylphenetylamine (hereinafter, referred to as "methamphetamine") was dosed intraperitoneal injection to a rat or mouse to which the tested compound was dosed, and a quantity of active movement was measured using an active movement measuring apparatus (SCANET SV-10; manufactured by TOYO Sangyo Co., Ltd.). The activity as the therapeutic agent of schizophrenia was evaluated using the hyperdynamic effect control of active movement caused by methamphetamine as an index (K.E.Vanover, Psychopharmacology 136: 123-131, 1998).  The effect of the tested substance was confirmed by the control effect of a quantity of active movement accentuation in comparison with the group dosed with a solvent.<br>
As a result, the compound related to the present invention revealed an excellent methamphetamine effect. Test Example 5 Rigidity model of intercaruncle ablatio provocative muscle<br>
An animal model in which the myotony of anteroposterior limbs was provoked was prepared by electrically freezing between the upper cumulus and the lower cumulus of a rat. Myorelaxation effect was evaluated based on the effect of controlling the increase of muscle discharge which is generated when the posterior limbs in this model are moved back and forth. The effect of the tested substance was confirmed by the changes<br><br>
of muscle discharge amount before dosing the tested substance and muscle discharge amount after dosing it.<br>
The compound related to the present invention revealed an excellent myorelaxation effect. Test Example 6 Light dark test<br>
A mouse is put in a dark box which is composed of two light and dark boxes which are linked by a tunnel, and items below were recorded concerning the behavior of the mouse for 5 minutes after that. 1. A time for remaining in the light and dark boxes.<br>
2	. Times by which the mouse went and came back between the light box and the dark box.<br>
3	. Times by which the mouse went until the entrance of the light box.<br>
The antianxiety effect of the tested compound was detected as the elongation of the time remaining in the light and dark boxes, the increase of times by which the mouse went and came back between the light box and the dark box, and the increase of times by which the mouse went until the entrance of the light box, for the group dosed with a solvent (Hascoet M. , Bourin M., Pharm. Biochem. Behav. 60: 645-653, 1998).<br>
According to the present test, it was confirmed that the compound related to the present invention has an excellent antianxiety effect. Test example 7<br><br><br>
Destruction model of 6-hydroxvdopamine-inductive niarosfcriaton<br>
lOmg/kg of L-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) (twice per day) was dosed every day in the abdomen of a rat whose one side of nigra neurocyte was destroyed by injecting 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into nigra, therefore the increase of rotational motion to the reverse side of encephalopathy was provoked (C.Marin et al, Synapse 36 (4) :267-274, 2000). After the solvent or the tested compound was dosed to the rat, influence on the provoked rotational motion was studied. The tested compound delayed the time until primitive rotational motion shows the maximum value after dosing L-DOPA, and increased the time of showing rotation which is a half or more of the maximum rotational number. Test example 8 Acetic acid writhing method<br>
Anguishing condition under which the lower half of rat's body was twisted, its abdomen was dented and its hind legs were extended was provoked by injecting 0.6% acetic acid saline in the abdomen of the rats. After the tested compound and the solvent were dosed, the acetic acid saline was injected in the abdomen, and analgesic effect was evaluated by comparing the times of these abnormal actions within an observation time (5 to 15 minutes after the dose of acetic acid) which occur after the dosing (Basic Pharmacology Experiment, edited by Kazuhiko Kubota, pages 45-47, Nankoh-do).<br><br>
As a result, it could be confirmed that the compound related to the present invention controls the times of the abnormal actions significantly and has an excellent analgesic effect.<br>
Test example 9 Vomiting model induced bv cisplatin<br>
A catheter for venoclysis was buried in a ferret, and the rat was postoperatively recovered. Then, vomiting reaction was provoked by injecting lOmg/kg of cis-<br>
diaminedichloroplatinum (cisplatin) (A.Fink-Jensen et al., Neuroscience Letters 137 : 173-177, 1992) . Cisplatin (lOmg/kg) was injected a ferret which was preliminarily treated with the tested compound or the solvent, then the ferret was put in an observation cage, and the time (latent time) and times until the rhythmical contraction of abdomen (defined as vomiting) occurs during the observation period of 240 minutes were measured.<br>
As a result, the compound related to the present invention reduced the latent time and the vomiting times significantly. Test example 10 Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model<br>
Female Lewis rats (205 ± 10 g) obtained from Charles River, Kent UK, were housed in pairs under environmentally controlled conditions (6:00a.m.-6:00p.m. light/dark cycle; 22-24°C; 45-55% humidity) and allowed free access to food and water. Experimental groups consisted of 9-12 animals. Rats were<br><br>
immunised in each hind foot with 20-50 ul of inoculum containing 50 ug guinea pig myelin basic protein (MBP; final concentration 2 mg/ml) , emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant (CFA; Sigma, UK) containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra (final concentration 5.5 mg/ml; Difco Laboratories, UK). Animals were weighed and monitored daily and clinical disease scored as (0) no clinical signs; (1) flaccid tail and weight loss; (2) hind limb hypotonia with further weight loss; (3) complete hind limb paralysis; (4) paraplegia and (5) death. In addition, intermediate scores were assigned to animals which showed a loss of tonicity in the distal half of the tail (score = 0.5), paralysis of one hind limb (score = 2.5) or complete hind limb paralysis with forelimb weakness (score = 3.5). During the period of compound administration (10-16 days post immunisation; dpi) animals were scored 15h after injection of vehicle or compound to avoid any acute effect of treatment on disease score. Compounds were dissolved/suspended in 0.5% methyl cellulose using a hand held Polytron homogeniser (PT1200; 2 min). Rats were dosed p.o. with either methyl cellulose vehicle (2.5 ml/kg) or compound at 5, 10 and 2 0 mg/kg. Results: the compound of the invention is improved in view of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. The compounds of Examples 7, 32, 76, 139, 164, 261, 262 and 264 are for example provided with a superior effect to the vehicle-administered group.<br><br><br><br>
