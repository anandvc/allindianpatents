				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a cricket bowling machine. The present invention particularly relates to a cricket bowling machine which is highly versatile in delivering different kinds of bowling of precise line and length. The present invention more particularly relates to a device for throwing balls of different diameter, beside the cricket ball, one ball at a time, as and when required, in an accurate manner at a predetermined speed and direction, controlled by a micro-controller based control system.<br>
The bowling machine of the present invention will be very useful for both amateur and professional cricketers who can use it as part of their regular practice for fine-tuning of batting without the necessity of bowlers. The main usage of this invention is to provide consistent batting practice for different cross-sections of the players, such as, professional cricketers, amateur cricketers, women cricketers and junior boys. The bowling machine of the present invention will assist in improving the natural talent of the batsman. It will be of much use at school, club and junior level where the standards of bowling are less consistent.<br>
The prior art search covering literature, patent databases and market survey reveals that there are a number of well known ball throwing devices. However, a through study reveals that in each of the hitherto known prior art ball throwing devices there is scope of further improvements and based on this study, the cricket bowling machine of the present invention has been provided.<br>
Reference may be made to U.S. patent no. 2526018, U.S. patent no. 2935980, U.S. patent no. 3467073, U.S. patent no. 3584614, U.S. patent no. 3662729, U.S. patent no. 4014307, U.S. patent no. 4091791 and U.S. patent no. 4570607, wherein tennis balls, baseballs and other soft balls have been projected by pneumatic means. This type of ball throwing machine used an air compressor actuated by motor to produce highly compressed air into the throwing tube. The throwing machines of air compression type occupy more space, are high in manufacturing cost and not portable.<br>
Reference may be made to U.S. patent no. 4860717, U.S. patent no. 3817235, U.S. patent no. 5975527, U.S. patent no. 4220130, U.S. patent no. 629044, U.S. patent no. 4517953, U.S. patent no. 4249508, U.S. patent no. 4291663, U.S. patent no. 4168695, U.S. patent no. 4220130, U.S. patent no. 4995371, U.S. patent no. 4269162, U.S. patent no. 4579100, U.S. patent no. 4611571, wherein base balls, tennis balls and other balls have been propelled by means of spring or elastic. Devices of this type usually make use of a striking or throwing mechanism consisting of either spring or elastic to project the ball. In this arrangement difficulty is encountered in designing a suitable controllable deflection mechanism. Also, complications and inconveniences arise in providing a suitable feed mechanism, since the ejecting mechanism must be accurately synchronized with the feed of the balls thereto. Moreover, these devices provide only limited directional control of the thrown ball and do not apply rotation to the ball as it is released. They are thus incapable of fully simulating the flight characteristics of a pitched ball.<br>
Reference may be made to patent nos.: GB 936559 and GB 1529396, wherein the balls are thrown by means of a striker head alongwith a spring connected striking arm or throwing arm. In this system reliability of total mechanism is highly questionable due to fatigue of each linkages and springs. Moreover, this machine cannot create any spin on the ball for not having any gripper to hold it at desired orientation.<br>
Reference may be made to U.S. patent no. 4080950, wherein A ball is delivered into the constricted space between, and thereby gripped frictionally by, a fixed pad and a confronting surface of a wheel which is driven at a speed predetermined to propel the ball therefrom at a selected velocity. The line on which the ball is propelled between the pad and wheel is adjustable about a horizontal axis and the speed of the wheel is variable so as to adjust the trajectory of the thrown ball. Further, the pad may be mounted above or below the wheel to reverse the spin on the ball and thus afford a variety of practice conditions. Here, the control of orientation on the ball is not positive, hence the flexibility of producing various kinds of balls as a challenge to the cricketer is not possible.<br>
Reference may be made to U.S. patent no. 6,739,325, U.S. patent no. 3,734,075, U.S. patent no.4,352,348, U.S. patent no. 4,561,414, U.S. patent no. 5,046,476, wherein one or more co-acting rotating wheels are used to propel a ball that is introduced between number of wheels. These type of throwing machine utilize rotary wheels which include a pneumatic tire mounted on a wheel which is supported on a rotary shaft. Rotary wheels of the pneumatic tire type are characterized by a number of limitations. Principal among these is the requirement to maintain proper inflation pressure in order to ensure consistent ball gripping action, the frequency of wheel balancing to prevent wheel wobble and consequent erratic ball throwing and the excessive cost of such wheels and their maintenance. Although the aforementioned earlier ball throwing device provides a substantial degree of adjustment of the rotational plane of the ball projecting wheels, the structural arrangement prevents the precise and positive adjustment of the rotational plane of the wheels to all positions between horizontal and vertical.<br>
In our co-pending patent application no.: 1560 DEL 2003, titled: "A Cricket ball Throwing Machine", a cricket bowling machine has been proposed to generate different type of bowling. The drawbacks of the said machine are listed below:<br>
1.There is no yaw motion, which is responsible for control of the line of pitching of the<br>
ball.<br>
2. The rolling motion of the machine necessary for changing the spinning axis of the<br>
ball is uncontrollable.<br>
From the details of the hitherto known prior art, it is observed that there is a definite need for providing a cricket bowling machine which is highly versatile in delivering different kinds of bowling of precise line and length.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a cricket bowling machine which obviates the drawbacks of the hitherto known prior art, as detailed above.<br>

In another embodiment of the present invention, the cricket bowling machine is capable of being automated and programmable through interfacing with microcontroller based electronic control systems.<br>
The description of the cricket bowling machine of the present invention with reference to figures 1 to 6 of the drawings accompanying this specification, is as follows:<br>
The cricket bowling machine of the present invention includes a base member (10) with fork like ends. Each fork carries a Wheel and Motor Holding cum Sliding<br>
Arrangement (WMHSA) (08) (09) which has a slider block (31). Each wheel (01) is supported on slider block (31) through radial bearing (37) and thrust bearing (38). Each motor (11) is fixed to a slider block (31) by screw. The motor shaft (39) is keyed to the wheel (01) and locked by locking screw (40) from the top, thus preventing the ejection of wheel (01) at high speed of rotation. The motors (11) (12) are electric type, preferably of variable speed in order to adjust the rotational speed of each wheel (01) independently of the other. Micro-controller based electronic control system (07) is provided to control the speed of each motor (11) independently.<br>
The wheel (01) preferably includes a rigid central hub (34) of cast alloy, a press-fitted thin cylindrical rim (35) with flanged ends and a rubber portion (36). Each of the rubber portion (36) has a deep concavity along its length and running throughout the periphery with curved fillet edges. Flanges prevent the thick concaved groove rubber portion (36) from coming out during high speed of rotation of the wheel (01).<br>
A rack (29) and pinion (30) is used in the WMHSA (08). The rack (29) is fixed to the slider block (31) with the help of screw (33). The pinion (30) which rotates inside a bush fitted in a casing (32) and screwed to the base member (10) in such a way that it meshes with the rack (29). The rack (29) and pinion (30) mechanism is used to control the gap between the two wheels (01) (02) for throwing balls of different diameters.<br>
Tripod cum Tri-axial Precise Rotation Mechanism (TTPRM) (03) is used to hold the base member (10) and to precisely adjust the required position of the delivery point of the ball with respect to three axes system i.e. roll axis (18), pitch axis (19) and yaw axis (20) to achieve a certain trajectory of the ball (13) such that the ball (13) pitches at different positions relative to the batsman. The TTPRM (03) has three indexer namely, Roll Axis Indexer (RAI) (14), Pitch Axis Indexer (PAI) (15) and Yaw Axis Indexer (YAI) (16) integrated with a tripod (17).<br>
PAI (15) of TTPRM (03) is used to control the length of the bowling. Pitching is the rotation of the top platform (24), over which the base member (10) is fixed, about the pitch axis (19). By controlling this, the length of the bowling can be varied from bouncer to Yorker, according to the will of the batsman. The precision and reproducibility of ball pitching distance that is required for effective batting practice is achieved by setting precisely the rotation of worm with knob for pitch (22) and worm wheel for pitch (27) which attached with top platform (24) of the PAI (15), about pitch axis (19). RAI (14) of the TTPRM (03) controls the axis of spin of the ball (13) during spin bowling. The worm with knob (21) is turned through some degrees to rotate the worm wheel (26) thereby governing the rotation of the PAI (15), which fixed with cantilever type shaft (25) portion of the RAI (14). The RAI (14) is directly placed on the top of the YAI (16). YAI (16) of the TTPRM (03) is used to control the line of the bowling. A worm wheel for yaw (28) meshes with a worm with knob (23) for yaw rotation, inside the tripod (17) casing.<br>
The ball (13) is guided on a ball delivery chute (04) attached to the base member (10) until it touches the curved surfaces of the wheels (01) (02) rotated in opposite direction. The ball (13) passes through the gap which is less than the ball (13) diameter and thereafter ejected tangentially forward. As the ball (13) passes through the gap between the two wheels (01) (02), the rubber material gets compressed. The concave surface provides a better contact and fillet edges provide a finger like grip on either side of its surface. The finger like gripping action of the fillet edges helps in controlling the trajectory of the ball (13). By controlling the relative speeds of the two counter rotating wheels (01) (02) as well as amount of rolling, a spin can be imparted to the ejected ball. The spin imparted to the ejected ball can cause it not only to drop but to take curve path to the left or right as well.<br>
The essential constructional features of the machine are a Tripod cum Tri-axial Precise Rotation Mechanism (TTPRM) to hold the base member on which the pair of rubber-bonded wheels are mounted. TTPRM rests on a tripod. The connection<br>
between the wheels and the motors are via Wheel and Motor Holding cum Sliding Arrangement (WMHSA).<br>
In the cricket bowling machine of the present invention, the Tripod cum Tri-axial Precise Rotation Mechanism (TTPRM) consists of Roll Axis Indexer (RAI), Pitch Axis Indexer (PAI), and Yaw Axis Indexer (YAI) to adjust precisely the required position of ball delivery with respect to three-axes i.e. roll, pitch, yaw axis system. The Wheel and Motor Holding and Sliding Arrangement (WMHSA) comprises of slider block which holds radial bearing and thrust bearing to accommodate hub of the wheel, the said WMHSA being provided with a rack and pinion mechanism capable of actuating the sliding movement over the base member to change the gap between the pair of wheels for throwing different diameter balls.<br>
The novelty of the present invention resides in providing a compact, efficient and economic cricket bowling machine which has the capability of delivering different kinds of bowling with greater mobility i.e. 3 axes of freedom system which enables in-swing, out-swing, leg spin, off spin, of precise line and length at speeds in the range of 70 km/hr to 160 km/hr using different varieties of balls.<br>
The novelty of the cricket bowling machine of the present invention has been effectively realized by the non-obvious inventive steps of providing in combination a pair of rotatable rubber bonded wheels (01,02), a ball (13) delivery chute (04), two drive motors (11,12), an electronic control panel (07), a substantially horizontal base member (10), a Tripod cum Tri-axial Precise Rotation Mechanism (TTPRM) (03), and a Wheel and Motor Holding cum Sliding Arrangement (WMHSA) (08,09);<br>
