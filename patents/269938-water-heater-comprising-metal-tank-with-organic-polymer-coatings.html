CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED AFFLICTIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
61/030,118, filed February 20, 2008, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by<br>
reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to organic coatings, and particularly, to water-<br>
resistant organic polymer coatings for use in water heaters. Porcelain enamel coatings<br>
traditionally used in hot water tanks and heaters are subject to corrosion and dissolution by<br>
hot water. In a water heater or water tank, once the porcelain enamel coating protecting a<br>
metal substrate is dissolved through to the substrate, then the substrate corrodes rapidly and is<br>
perforated through. At this point the water heater must be replaced.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0003] In one aspect, the invention provides a water tank comprising a tank having a<br>
water chamber with an interior surface, the interior surface at least partially coated with an<br>
organic polymer coating, the coating having a thickness of less than about 375µm (less than<br>
about 15 mil) and adapted to contact water.<br>
[0004] In another aspect, the invention provides a method of making a water tank, in<br>
which at least a portion of a metal surface of a water tank is treated to create a surface having<br>
a profile of about 40 µm to about 100 µm (about 1.6 mil to about 4 mil) and an organic<br>
polymer coating is apphed to the tank to form a coated surface that contacts water in the<br>
water tank.<br>
[0005] The invention also provides a method of producing a water tank in which a<br>
surface of the tank is treated with a metal phosphate such as zinc phosphate, iron phosphate<br>
or manganese phosphate and an organic polymer is applied to the treated surface to form a<br>
coated surface that contacts water in the water tank.<br>
[0006] In another aspect, the invention provides a method of storing hot water,<br>
comprising contacting a tank having at least a portion of its interior surface coated with an<br>
organic polymer coating, a portion of the coating contacting water a temperature of at least<br>
about 60°C, and showing less than about 1% blistering after a period of at least about 3<br>
months.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0007] It is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the<br>
details of construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the following<br>
description. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of<br>
being carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and<br>
terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as<br>
limiting. The use of "including," "comprising," or "having" and variations thereof herein is<br>
meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as additional<br>
items. Unless specified or limited otherwise, the terms "mounted," "connected,"<br>
"supported," and "coupled" and variations thereof are used broadly and encompass both<br>
direct and indirect mountings, connections, supports, and couplings. Further, "connected"<br>
and "coupled" are not restricted to physical or mechanical connections or couplings.<br>
[0008] It also is understood that any numerical range recited herein includes all values<br>
from the lower value to the upper value. For example, if a concentration range is stated as<br>
1% to 50%, it is intended that values such as 2% to 40%, 10% to 30%, or 1% to 3%, etc., are<br>
expressly enumerated in this specification. These are only examples of what is specifically<br>
intended, and all possible combinations of numerical values between and including the lowest<br>
value and the highest value enumerated are to be considered to be expressly stated in this<br>
application.<br>
[0009] All patents, publications and references cited herein are hereby fully incorporated<br>
by reference. In case of conflict between the present disclosure and incorporated patents,<br>
publications and references, the present disclosure should control.<br>
[0010] In one aspect, the present invention relates to water heaters and tanks for storing<br>
liquids coated with an organic polymer coating, and methods for making and using the coated<br>
water heaters or tanks. The present invention provides at least one of a durable, adhesive.<br>
water resistant, pH resistant, chemical resistant and abrasion resistant organic polymer<br>
coating for the interior surface of a water tank, such as is used in a water heater. The use of<br>
an organic polymer coating on a metal, such as a steel (or a grit-blasted steel) tank permits the<br>
water storage tank to be fabricated without the need for firing, so that thinner, less or lower<br>
strength metal, such as steel, may be used. Typical glass liners used in water storage tanks<br>
tend to dissolve over time when the temperature of the water exceeds about 60°C (140°F),<br>
particularly when the temperature exceeds about 82°C (180°F), or when the pH of the water is<br>
at least about 8. The hot water tank coated with the organic polymer coating may be used to<br>
store liquids at any pH and at temperatures above about 60 °C (140 °F), about 70°C, about<br>
71.1°C (160°F), about 80°C, or about 82.2°C (180°F).<br>
[0011 ] The organic coating is applied a hot water tank, or other liquid or water storage<br>
tank, directly or indirectly to the surface. In other words, in some embodiments there may be<br>
one or more additional layers between the surface and the organic coating. In some<br>
embodiments, the organic coating is applied to the interior surface of the tank. In other<br>
embodiments, the organic coating is applied to the interior and exterior surfaces of the tank.<br>
As used herein "a hot water tank" is a vessel adapted to hold water at a temperature of at least<br>
about 55°C (131°F) and includes, without limitation, a hot water storage tank, a water heater,<br>
such as a direct fired water heater, or a water boiler. The tank is suitably made from a metal,<br>
such as steel, which is coated with the organic coating. The organic coatings are suitably<br>
applied, for example, to a residential electric or gas water heater or an industrial electric or<br>
gas water heater and polymerized. The tank suitably defines or includes a water chamber<br>
which is coated with the organic coating, the organic coating being adapted to contact or hold<br>
water. Suitably, the water tanks coated with the organic polymer coating are adapted to hold<br>
water at a temperature of at least about 55°C, at least about 60°C, at least about 65°C, at least<br>
about 70°C, at least about 75°C, at least about 80°C, at least about 85°C, at least about 90°C,<br>
at least about 95°C, or at least about 98°C.<br>
[0012] Suitably the hot water tank has a capacity of at least about 15 liters, at least about<br>
19 liters (5 gallons), at least about 25 liters, at least about 35 liters, at least about 37.9 liters<br>

(30 gallons), at least about 150 liters, at least about 151.6 liters (40 gallons), at least about<br>
175 liters, at least about 189.5 liters (50 gallons), at least about 300 liters, at least about 350<br>
liters, at least about 379 liters (100 gallons) or at least about 400 liters.<br>
[0013] In one embodiment, the organic polymer comprises an epoxy polymer base such<br>
as bisphenol A epoxy, acrylic modified epoxy, polyester modified epoxy, or a combination<br>
thereof. The organic polymer suitably comprises (by weight) at least about 30%, at least<br>

than about 85% or less than about 80% of the epoxy polymer base. The epoxy polymer base<br>
is suitably a reaction product of an epoxide and a dihydroxy compound. Examples of suitable<br>
dihydroxy compounds may include bisphenol A, bisphenol F, biphenol, resorcinol. The<br>

pyromellitic dianhydride, may also be used. Examples of suitable novolac epoxys may<br>
include those obtained by reacting phenols such as phenol, o-cresol, m-cresol, p-cresol, p-<br>
tert-butylphenol, p-nonylphenol, 2,6-xylenol, resorcinol, bisphenol-A, a and ß-naphthol, and<br>
naphthalenediol with aldehydes such as acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, furfural, glyoxal, and p-<br>
hydroxybenzaldehyde in the presence of an acid catalyst, or an alkali catalyst to yield a<br>
methylolated compound of the corresponding phenol, which is then reacted with phenols in<br>
the presence of an acid catalyst. High temperature performance curing agents suitably may<br>
be used. Suitably, the curing crosslinking agent is present (by weight) in the organic polymer<br>
at at least about 1%, at least about 2%, at least about 3%, at least about 5%, at least about<br>

[0014] Suitably, the organic polymer used to coat tanks of the invention may optionally<br>
comprise an adhesion promoter, or a cathodic disbondment promoter. The cured organic<br>
polymer suitably comprises an epoxy polymer or epoxy resin.<br>
[0015] The organic polymer used to coat tanks of the invention may optionally comprise<br>
a filler, such as, without limitation, calcium silicate (woUastonite), calcium carbonate,<br>
titanium oxide, micronized silica, an aluminosilicate such as calcined kaolin, a<br>
magnesosilicate such as talc and calcium sulfate. Examples of suitable commercially<br>
available fillers are WoUastonite Nyad 400 (commercially available from NYCO). The filler<br>
is suitably present (by weight) at less than about 70%, less than about 60%, less than about<br>
50%, less than about 40%, less than about 30%, or less than about 20%, and at least about<br>
0.5%, at least about 1%, at least about 1.5%, and at least about 5%, or and at least about 10%<br>
of the organic polymer.<br>
[0016] The organic polymer used to coat tanks of the invention may optionally comprise<br>
a flow control agent. Suitable flow control agents include, without limitation, acrylic flow<br>
agents (polyacrylates), silicone oligomers, fluorinated polyolefins, polyvinyl butyral, and<br>
combinations thereof. An example of suitable flow agents are the Resiflow series (such as<br>
Resiflow p-67), commercially available from Estron Chemical, Calvert City, KY. The flow<br>
control agent is suitably present (by weight) at less than about 10%, less than about 0.7%, or<br>
less than about 5%, and at least about 0.1%, at least about 0.2%, or at least about 0.5% of the<br>
organic polymer.<br>
[0017] The organic polymer used to coat tanks of the invention may optionally comprise<br>
a catalyst. Suitable catalysts may include, without limitation, tin catalysts such as stannous<br>
octoate and tetraphenyl tin, zinc metal, dibutyltin dilaurate, potassium acetate, potassium<br>

0.5%, at least about 1%, at least about 1.5%, or at least about 2% of the organic polymer.<br>
[0019] Organic polymer coatings of the invention may be stable over a wide range of<br>
different pHs. For example, the organic polymer coating may resist corrosion or blistering<br>
when the pH of the liquid contained in it over a period about 1 month, about 3 months, about<br>
4 months, about 6 months, about 9 months, about 12 months, about 2 years, about 5 years or<br>
about 10 years is at least about 1 (or about 1), at least about 2 (or about 2), is at least about 3<br>
(or about 3), at least about 4 (or about 4), at least about 5 (or about 5), at least about 6 (or<br>
about 5), or at least about 7, (or about 7) and is less than about 14 (or about 14), less than<br>
about 13 (or about 13), less than about 12 (or about 12), less than about 11 (or about 11), less<br>
than about 10 (or about 10), less than about 9 (or about 9), or less than about 8 (or about 8).<br>
Suitably, the organic polymer coating resists corrosion and/or blistering over the<br>
aforementioned pH values, or when contacted with water, for the aforementioned periods of<br>
time when the temperature of the liquid is at least about 20°C, at least about 30°C, at least<br>
about 40°C, at least about 50°C, at least about 60°C, at least about 65°C, at least about 70°C,<br>
at least about 75°C, at least about 80°C, at least about 82°C, at least about 85°C, at least about<br>
88°C, at least about 90°C, at least about 95°C, at least about 98°C, or at least about 99°C.<br>
Resistance to corrosion and/or blistering over pH ranges of about 1 to about 14 or about 2 to<br>
about 13 are contemplated. Suitably, the organic polymer coating resists corrosion and<br>
blistering when exposed to boiling water for a period of 6,000 to 9,000 hours. As used herein<br>
"resists corrosion or blistering," means that no blisters or corrosion of the coating are visually<br>
evident after the specified test conditions. Suitably less than about 10%, less than about 7%,<br>
less than about 5%, less than about 4%, less than about 3%, less than about 2%, less than<br>
about 1%, less than about 0.5%, less than about 0.1%, less than about 0.01%, less than about<br>
0.001%, or less than about 0.0001% of the surface area of the organic polymer coating<br>
contacting the liquid (or otherwise exposed to the conditions) is blistered or shows blistering<br>
after the specified test conditions and specified time periods described herein.<br>
[0020] Conditions for testing corrosion and/or blistering, include, for example, exposure<br>
to a water immersion test at about 60°C (140°F), about 71°C (160°F), about 82°C (180°F),<br>
about 93°C (200°F), about 96°C (205°F), exposure to salt spray testing (for example, ASTM<br>
B117 testing) for 9,000 hours or 10,000 hours, exposure to methyl ethyl ketone, xylene and<br>
methylene chloride for a period of nine months (or 5,000 hours), or exposure to water at a<br>
temperature of about71.1°C(160°F) about 82.2°C (180T),or about 87.8°C (190°F). For<br>
example, the corrosion, blistering and or degradation of coatings may be monitored using hot<br>
water test cells with a water temperature of at least about 55°C, at least about 60°C, at least<br>
about 65°C, at least about 70°C, at least about 75°C, at least about 80°C, at least about 85°C,<br>
at least about 90°C, at least about 95°C, at least about 98°C, or at least about 99°C for a<br>
period of at least about 50 hours, at least about 100 hours, at least about 200 hours, at least<br>
about 400 hours, at least about 800 hours, at least about 1,000 hours, at least about 3,000<br>
hours, at least about 4,000 hours, at least about 5,000 hours, at least about 8,000 hours, at<br>
least about 9,000 hours, or at least about 10,000 hours. Organic polymer coatings of the<br>
invention suitably resist corrosion and blistering when subjected to high humidity (RH 95%)<br>
or water immersion tests. For example, corrosion and/or blistering may be monitored by<br>
performing a water immersion test of 10,000 hours at 82°C (180°F), 6,000 hours at 96.1°C<br>
(205 °F), or 4,000 hours at 100°C (212 °F). Organic polymer coatings of the invention<br>
suitably resist corrosion or blistering under one or more of these conditions.<br>
[0021] Organic polymer coatings of the invention suitably show excellent chemical<br>
resistance. For example, the coatings may resist corrosion and blistering when exposed to a<br>
10% sodium hydroxide solution or a 10% sulfuric acid solution for 6,000 to 9,000 hours at<br>
82.2°C (180 °F), a 50% sulfuric acid solution for 9000 hours at 82.2°C (180 °F), a 50%<br>
sodium hydroxide solution for 9,000 hours at 82.2°C (180 °F). The organic polymer coatings<br>
when applied to a water tank also suitably resist corrosion and/or blistering after exposure to<br>
hydrofluoric acid (such as a 50% aqueous solution of HF) or gluconic acid for a period of at<br>
least about 1 month, at least about 3 months, at least about 6 months, at least about 9 months,<br>
at least about 12 months, at least about 15 months, at least about 18 months, or at least about<br>
24 months.<br>
[0022] Organic polymers useful in the invention may have high glass transition<br>
temperatures (Tg). For example, the polymer may have a Tg of at least about 80°C, at least<br>
about 85°C, at least about 90°C, at least about 95°C, at least about 100°C, at least about<br>
105°C, at least about 110°C, at least about 115°C, at least about 120°C, at least about 130°C,<br>
at least about 140°C, at least about 145°C, or at least about 150°C.<br>
[0023] Organic polymer coatings of the invention show good adhesion to the substrate,<br>
such as a water tank, water heater, hot water storage tank, or boiler. For example, the organic<br>
polymer coating may adhere well to metal surfaces such as those containing, without<br>
limitation, steel (including standardized steel and/or galvanized steel), iron, titanium,<br>
aluminum or magnesium. While thicker steel (such as steel having a thickness of at least<br>
about 1.5 mm, at least about 1.6 mm, at least about 1.75 mm, or at least about 1.9 mm) may<br>
be used to fabricate the substrate, such as a water tank, water heater, hot water storage tank,<br>
or boiler, thinner steel may also be suitably used. For example, steel having a thickness of<br>
less than about 1.5 mm, less than about 1.4 mm, less than about 1.3 nun, less than about 1.25<br>
mm, less than about 1.2 mm, less than about 1.1 mm, less than about 1 mm, less than about<br>
0.9 nmi, less than about 0.8 mm, less than about 0.7 mm, or less than about 0.6 mm may be<br>
used. For example, for a 50-gallon (190 liter or 200 liter) tank, steel having a thickness of<br>
less than about 1.5 mm, less than about 1.25 mm less than about 1.2 nun, less than about 1.1<br>
mm or less than about 1 mm may be used. For a 10-gallon (about a 40 liter or less) tank, for<br>
example, steel having a thickness of less than about 1 mm, less than about 0.9 mm, less than<br>
about 0.8 mm, less than about 0.7 mm, or less than about 0.6 mm may be used.. For a tank of<br>
at least an about 100 liters (or about 30-gallon) capacity, steel having a thickness of less than<br>
about 1.4 mm, less than about 1.3 mm, less than about 1.25 mm less than about 1.2 mm, less<br>
than about 1.1 mm or less than about 1 mm may be used.<br>
[0024] In one embodiment, adhesion to the substrate is facilitated by pre-treating the<br>
surface of the substrate by cleaning and/or profiling the surface. Substrates, such as<br>
fabricated tank components, may be cleaned using any suitable technique known in the art.<br>
For example, fabricated tanks or tank components may be cleaned using single-stage or<br>
multiple-stage washers (such as two-stage, three-stage, four-stage or five-stage washers).<br>
Cleaning agents than may be used include, without limitation, mild acid cleaners, neutral<br>
cleaners, alkaline cleaners, or organic cleaners such as acetone and ethanol.<br>
[0025] The substrate may be surface treated or modified to facilitate adhesion of the<br>
organic polymer coating or coating components. For example, steel or other substrate may be<br>
phosphate-treated (e.g. with iron-phosphate, zinc-phosphate or manganese phosphate), etched<br>
with acid (for example immersed in gluconic acid for one minute or longer), shot blasted, grit<br>
blasted, sand blasted, or cold-rolled before being coated with the organic polymer. The<br>
blasting treatment may be carried out to produce a metal surface that is white in appearance.<br>
The surface may be treated to have a profile (i.e. the depth of the texture on the surface) of<br>
about 50 µm (2 mils). Suitably, the profile of the treated surface is at least about 10 µm, at<br>
least about 20 µm, at least about 25 µm, at least about 30 µm, at least about 35 µm, at least<br>
about 40 µm, or at least about 45 µm. Suitably, the profile of the treated surface is less than<br>
about 150 µm, less than about 140 µm, less than about 130 µm, less than about 120 µm, less<br>
than about 110 µm, less than about 100 µm, less than about 90 µm, less than about 80 µm,<br>
less than about 75 µm, less than about 70 µm, less than about 65 µm, less than about 60 µm,<br>
or less than about 55 µm. The blasting surface treatment may provide a controlled profile<br>
with substantially no contaminating chemical residues (for example, as might be left from<br>
inadequate rinsing, etc). Chemical residues left on surfaces may interfere with the<br>
functioning of the organic polymer coating, and potentially cause early failures. In one<br>
embodiment, the organic polymer is applied to the treated or blasted surface within about 24<br>
hours, within about 12 hours, within about 8 hours, within about 4 hours, within about 3<br>
hours, within about 2 hours, within about 1 hour, within about 45 minutes, within about 30<br>
minutes, within about 20 minutes, within about 15 minutes, within about 10 minutes, within<br>
about 5 minutes, or within about 3 minutes of completion of the treatment or blasting, such<br>
that oxidation of the surface is minimized. Suitably, the humidity is controlled and the steel<br>
is maintained under inert conditions following the surface treatment and prior to applying the<br>
organic coating to prevent or reduce oxidation of the treated surface. Suitably, less than<br>
about 50%, less than about 45%, less than about 40%, less than about 35%, less than about<br>
30%, less than about 25%, less than about 20%, less than about 15%, less than about 10%,<br>
less than about 5%, less than about 3%, less than about 2%, less than about 1%, less than<br>
about 0.5%, less than about 0.1%, less than about 0.1% or less than about 0.01% of the<br>
surface is oxidized prior to applying the organic coating.<br>
[0026] For metal (e.g. zinc, iron, manganese) phosphate treatment, the tank or tank<br>
components may be cleaned using hot alkaline cleaner, rinsed, and chemically conditioned to<br>
prepare for zinc, iron or manganese phosphate. The metal phosphate is then added before<br>
excess is rinsed away using one or more rinses which may include a deionized water rinse<br>
and/or a sealing rinse. The metal phosphate treatment results in crystals layered, deposited or<br>
grown on the substrate surfaces. These crystals may have a needle-like appearance and<br>
create profiles for better coating adhesion. When electro-coating is used to coat the<br>
component with the polymer, a hydrogen bond may form between the organic polymer and<br>
the metal phosphate. When powder coating is used to coat the component with the polymer,<br>
the crystals provide mechanical adhesion of the coating.<br>
[0027] When the coating components are in powder form, the organic polymer coating<br>
may be formed, for example, by powder coating the inside of the tank and heating the tank to<br>
form the coating, or otherwise curing the coating components to form the organic polymer<br>
coating. When the coating components are in liquid form, the coating may be formed by<br>
dipping the tank into the coating components such that the coating forms on the interior and<br>
exterior surface of the tank. Suitable methods for applying the organic polymers to the tank<br>
may include those known in the art, such as spraying, pouring and painting. Electrocoating<br>
may also be used.<br>
[0028] The organic polymer coating may be cured or set onto the water tank at a<br>
temperature of less than about 200°F (or about 95°C), less than about 300°F (or about<br>
150°C), less than about 400°F (or about 205°C), less than about 500°F (or about 260°C), less<br>
than about 600°F (or about 315°C), less than about 700°F (or about 370°C), less than about<br>
800°F (or about 425°C), less than about 900°F (or about 485°C), less than about 1000°F (or<br>
about 540°C), less than about 1200°F (or about 650°C), less than about 1400°F (or about<br>
760°C), or less than about 1600°F (or about 870°C).<br>
[0029] In one embodiment, the coating is cured or set at a temperature of at least about<br>
175°C, at least about 185°C, at least about 190°C, at least about 195°C, or at least about<br>
200°C and less than about 260°C, less than about 255°C, less than about 250°C, less than<br>
about 245°C, less than about 240°C, less than about 235°C, or less than about 225°C for a<br>
period of time of at least about 2 minutes, at least about 5 minutes, at least about 7 minutes or<br>
at least about 10 minutes, and less than about one hour, less than about 45 minutes, less than<br>
about 40 minutes, less than about 35 minutes or less than about 30 minutes. For example, the<br>
coating may be cured at a temperature of about 185°C to about 260°C for between about 5<br>
and about 30 minutes.<br>
[0030] In one embodiment, the organic coating adheres to the inner or interior surface of<br>
the tank and suitably forms a contiguous layer. In another embodiment the organic coating<br>
adheres to the inner (or interior) and outer (or exterior) surface of the tank, and suitably forms<br>
a contiguous layer over both inner (or interior) and outer (or exterior) surfaces. The tank may<br>
therefore suitably contain a single layer or film of the coating. The coating is adapted to<br>
contact water, and may suitably regularly contact water. As used herein, "contacting water,"<br>
means that a least a portion of coating is in contact with a volume of at least 0.5 liters of<br>
water contained or stored in the tank. As used herein, "regularly contacting water," means<br>
that at least a portion of the coating contacts water for a majority of time over the functional<br>
life span of the tank.<br>
[0031] The coating formed on the tank is suitably less than about 500 µm (20 mil), less<br>
than about 400 µm (16 mil), less than about 375 µm (15 mil), less than about 350 )µm (14<br>
mil), less than about 300 µm (12 mil), less than about 250 µm (10 mil), less than about 200<br>
µm (8 mil), less than about 175 µm (7 mil), less than about 150 µm (6 mil), less than about<br>
125 µm (5 mil), or less than about 100 µm (4 mil), less than about 75 µm (3 mil), or less than<br>
about 50 µm (2 mil) in thickness. The coating formed on the tank may be at least about 25<br>
µm (1 mil), at least about 50 µm (2 mil), at least about 75 µm (3 mil), or at least about 100<br>
µm (4 mil) in thickness.<br>
[0032] The following examples are illustrative and are not to be construed as limiting the<br>
scope of the invention.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
[0033] A one flat-panel storage tank was coated with a coating of the invention to test the<br>
integrity of the coating. The tank was used to store pig manure. The integrity of the coating<br>
was inspected every three months. No compromise in integrity was detected after two years<br>
of testing.<br>
Example 2<br>
[0034] Twelve 50 gallon gas water heaters fabricated from steel at a customary steel<br>
thickness were hand cleaned with acetone. The organic polymer components described in<br>
Example 4 (Table 1) were used to powder coat the interior surface of the tanks. The tanks<br>
were heated to form the coatings. The coatings had a thickness of between 25 µm and 125<br>
µm (1 to 5 mil).<br>
[0035] No corrosion or degradation of the coating was seen when the tanks were used to<br>
heat water and store hot water over a period of 3 months.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
[0036] Ten 20 gallon electric water heaters fabricated from steel at a customary steel<br>
thickness were cleaned using a glassing line washer. The organic polymer components<br>
described in Example 4 (Table 1) were used to powder coat the interior surface of the tanks.<br>
The tanks were heated to form the coatings. The coatings had a thickness of between about<br>
25 µm and 100 µm (1 to 4 mil).<br>
[0037] No corrosion or degradation of the coating was seen when the tanks were used to<br>
heat water and store hot water over a period of 2 months.<br>
Example 4<br>
[0038] An organic polymer in the form of a powder was made using the components<br>
listed in Table 1. The coating had a glass transition temperature of at least 121°C (250°F)<br>
and was applied to water heaters. The coating performed well in tests.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
Example 5<br>
[0039] An organic polymer of the invention was used to coat steel and was tested using<br>
hot water corrosion cells. Conditions tested included 93.3°C (200°F) (1/2 filled to create<br>
vapor phase) for 72 hours; boiling for 800 hours; 82.2°C (180°F) for 3200 hours, and 71.1°C<br>
(160°F) for 3200 hours. No blistering or corrosion was observed under any of these tested<br>
conditions.<br>
Example 6<br>
[0040] The organic polymer of Example 4 (Table 1) was applied to water heaters: 10-<br>
gallon capacity electric heaters, 50-gallon capacity electric heaters and 30 gallon capacity gas<br>
heaters were each tested.<br>
[0041] Ten-gallon capacity steel tanks were fabricated by processing steel coil though an<br>
uncoiling/ straightening line and then through a blaster. Tank and head blanks were cut and<br>
processed through a stamping operation. Top heads were washed and tank shells were<br>
welded. Spuds were then welded onto top heads and tank shells. The tank shell was<br>
expanded and the head was pressed into the tank shell. The head was then welded onto the<br>
shell.<br>
[0042] The fabricated steel water tanks were cleaned at ambient temperature with 2%<br>
volume of a commercially available neutral cleaner at a pH of 7-8, with 2 satiations, using a<br>
three-stage washer facility. The cleaned tanks were dried off at temperatures of 121.1°C<br>
(250°F) and higher using oven facilities having a high volume air movement.<br>
[0043] The interiors of the tank assembly were grit blasted in a blast cabinet using steel<br>
grit (for some 50 gallon tanks) or 24 grit aluminum oxide (10-gallon tanks and other 50-<br>
gallon tanks) to produce a 50 µm (2.0 mils) profile. The dust, shots and grits following the<br>
blasting were blown off using compressed air to reveal surfaces having a white metal<br>
appearance.<br>
[0044] Within 5 minutes of preparing the metal by grit blasting, the organic polymer<br>
powder listed in Table 1 was spray applied to a 4 to 6 mil (about 100 to 150 µm) thickness.<br>
The powder coated components were cured by baking at an oven temperature of 420°F<br>
(215°C) for 20 minutes (or to a metal temperature of 400°F (204°C) for 10 minutes) to<br><br>
produce a coating thickness of about 5 mils (about 125 µm) or 4 to 6 mils (about 100 to 150<br>
µm).<br>
[0045] No corrosion or degradation of the coating was seen (no blisters were evident on<br>
the surface of the coatings) when the tanks were used to heat water and store hot water over a<br>
period of three years at a water temperature of 160°F (71.1 °C), with six draws of 6 to 10<br>
gallons from each tank (i.e. the tanks were emptied and refilled with 6 to 10 gallons of water<br>
six times) per 24 hour period during the three year test period.<br>
Example 7<br>
[0046] Steel water heaters (ten-gallon capacity electric heaters and 50-gallon capacity<br>
electric heaters) were coated with a polymer using the process detailed in Example 6, except<br>
that the polymer contained the components listed in Table 2 instead of the components listed<br>
in Tabic 1. The coating had a glass transition temperature of at least 121°C (250°F).<br>
Table 2<br><br>
[0047] No corrosion or degradation of the coating was seen (no blisters were evident on<br>
the surface of the coatings) when the tanks were used to heat water and store hot water over a<br>
period of three years at a water temperature of 160°F (71.1°C), with six draws of 6 to 10<br>
gallons fh)m each tank over each 24 hour period during the three year test period.<br>
Example 8<br>
[0048] Six 30-gallon capacity steel gas water heaters were coated with Henkel<br>
AQUENCETM 930 (an epoxy-acrylic urethane mixture commercially available from the<br>
Henkel Corporation), by dipping the heaters into the Henkel AQUENCE™ 930.<br>
[0049] No blisters were visually evident after the tanks were used to heat water and store<br>
hot water over a period of three months at a water temperature of 160°F (71.1°C), with six<br>
draws of 6-10 gallons from each tank over each 24 hour period during the three month test<br>
period.<br>
Example 9<br>
[0050] Standard steel test panels were cleaned with hot alkali, rinsed, and subjected to<br>
chemical conditioning to prepare for zinc phosphate. Zinc phosphate was deposited on the<br>
panels such that needle like crystals grew on the surface. The panels were rinsed, followed<br>
by a deionized water rinse, and a sealing rinse.<br>
[0051] The zinc phosphate crystals created a profile on the metal panels for better<br>
adhesion of the organic polymer coating. The organic polymer of Example 4 (Table 1) was<br>
used to coat the panels. No blistering or corrosion of the coating (no blisters were noted on<br>
the surface of the coating) was noted after the coated panels were immersed in water at<br>
temperatures of 160°F (71.1°C), 180°F (82.2°C), or 194°F (90°C) for 4,000 hours.<br><br>
