Manganese dioxide-catalyst for hydrolysing carboxylic<br>
acid nitriles<br>
The invention relates to a novel manganese dioxide<br>
catalyst which can be used for the hydrolysis of<br>
organic nitriles to the corresponding carboxamides, and<br>
to a process for preparing the catalyst. The invention<br>
also relates to a catalytic process for hydrolysing<br>
organic nitriles to the corresponding carboxamides with<br>
the aid of the catalyst.<br>
The invention relates in particular to a catalytic<br>
process for hydrolysing 2-hydroxy-4-methylthio-<br>
butyronitrile to 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyramide, a<br>
valuable intermediate in the preparation of 2-hydroxy-<br>
4-methylthiobutyric acid, the hydroxyl analogue of<br>
methionine (MHA), and salts thereof. These substances<br>
find use as an animal feed additive, in particular in<br>
poultry breeding. These methionine-like compounds can<br>
replace methionine and significantly improve the<br>
utilization of proteins in the feed.<br><br>
The hydrolysis of 2-hydroxycarbonitriles (cyanohydrins)<br>
is a special case of nitrile hydrolysis. It is not<br>
possible to use any -of the known processes for<br>
hydrolysing nitriles, in which strong bases may be<br>
used, because a back reaction of the cyanohydrin to<br>
aldehyde and hydrogen cyanide proceeds under these<br><br>
reaction conditions.	<br><br>
The 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyronitrile can also be<br>
hydrolysed with highly concentrated mineral acids,<br>
preferably with sulphuric acid, in a virtually<br>
equimolar amount. In the first reaction step, the amide<br>
of the substituted butyric acid forms. An industrially<br>
readily realizable separation of 2-hydroxy-4-<br><br>
methylthiobutyramide and sulphuric acid with the aim<br>
of being able to reuse the sulphuric acid, is, however,<br>
not known. Only after the hydrolysis of the amide to<br><br>
the hydroxycarboxylic acid is the mineral acid removed<br>
as ammonium hydrogensulphate, arid worked up back to<br>
sulphuric acid in an additional, expensive process<br>
step.	<br><br>
It is also known that manganese dioxide catalyses the<br>
hydrolysis reaction of carbonitriles to amides, as<br>
described, for example, in DE 1593320. <br>
As a result of the incorporation of manganese of other<br>
valence states into the crystal lattice, the<br>
stoichiometric composition of natural and synthetic<br>
manganese dioxide is in the range between MnO1.7 to<br>
MnO2.0. Extraneous ions such as sodium, potassium may be<br>
present in the crystals. Manganese dioxide exists in<br>
several allotropic modifications. They differ greatly<br>
in their behaviour as a catalyst. The crystallinity is<br><br>
at its most marked in pyrolysite (beta-manganese<br>
dioxide), the most stable modification. This form is<br>
catalytically inactive. The crystalliciity is less<br>
marked in the further modifications and] extends up to<br>
an amorphous product, ramsdellite. It is possible to<br><br>
assign the modifications by x-ray diffraction. Some of<br>
the chemically and catalytically active forms of<br>
manganese dioxide are hydrated and additionally contain<br>
hydroxyl groups.	<br>
Numerous patents describe catalytic processes for<br>
hydrolysing carbonitriles, especially 2-hydroxynitriles<br>
(cyanohydrins), with manganese dioxide. These processes<br>
are highly suitable, for example, for hydrolysing<br>
acetone cyanohydrin, as shown in US-4018829, with which<br>
yields of over 90% are achieved in the hydrolysis of<br>
acetone cyanohydrin to 2-hydroxybutyramiide with the aid<br>
of manganese dioxide.	<br>
The catalytically active modifications of manganese<br>
dioxide are, however, also active as oxidizing agents,<br>
which significantly restricts their use in the<br><br>
hydrolysis of thioether- or thiol-substitsuted nitriles,<br>
caused by their easy oxidizability. This reduces<br>
tetravalent manganese partly to trivalent manganese,<br>
and correspondingly oxidizes the sulphur.<br>
DE 1593320 describes a process for hydrolysing nitriles<br><br>
to amides with the aid of manganese dioxide, in which<br>
yields up to over 90% were achieved with aliphatic<br>
nitriles. Only 8% yield of amide was achieved with<br>
thiodipropionitrile, which makes it clear that<br>
conventional manganese dioxide is hardly suitable as a<br>
catalyst in the presence of easily oxidizable thioether<br>
groups.EP 0 597 298 describes a partial reduction of manganese<br>
dioxide by a pretreatment with reducing agents such as<br>
alcohol in order to improve the catalyst properties, in<br>
particular to suppress oxamide formation there. With<br><br>
increasing proportion of trivalent manganese oxide,<br>
however, the activity of the catalyst declines.<br>
The oxidizing action of manganese dioxide is generally<br><br>
undesired in the hydrolysis of nitriles which bear<br><br>
easily oxidizable groups such as thiol or thioether<br>
groups. In particular, the S-oxidization is undesired<br>
in the hydrolysis of 2-hydroxy-4-methylthio~<br>
butyronitrile to 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyramide, an<br><br>
important intermediate in the preparation of the animal<br>
feed additive 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyric acid.<br>
Oxidation of the sulphur forms the sulptioxide and this<br><br>
ultimately reduces the yield of 2-hydroxy-4-methyl-<br><br>
thiobutyramide. This by-product formed by oxidation<br>
cannot be removed without a considerable level of cost<br>
and inconvenience and then leads to a contaminated end<br>
product which can no longer be used directly as an<br>
animal feed additive.	<br>
The reduction of the catalyst which is associated with<br>
the oxidization of the sulphur also shortens its<br><br><br><br>
lifetime, which, in an industrial process, leads to<br>
economic disadvantages, such as iricreased catalyst<br>
consumption and regeneration complexity with<br>
corresponding costs.	<br>
The patent JP 09104665 describes the preparation of<br><br>
active δ-manganese dioxide and defines its activity via<br>
the parameter of surface area. The hydrolysis of<br>
2~hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyronitrile with full<br>
conversion is also described with this catalyst. There<br>
is no discussion whatsoever of the formation of<br>
sulphoxide in this publication on the part of the<br>
applicant. By virtue of adjustment of the conditions<br>
specified there, it was, however, found that, during<br>
the reaction, the sulphoxide of 2-hydroxy-4-methyl-<br>
thiobutyronitrile is formed up to more than 4% in a<br>
selectivity of at least 1.6% (comparative example,<br>
Example 11), which is highly disadvantageous. Moreover,<br>
the nitrile conversion was only 96.1%, the amide yield<br>
7 9.8% in continuous mode.	<br>
The same applicant describes, in the patent<br>
EP 0 731 079, a process for preparing carboxylic acids<br>
by hydrolysing cyanohydrin with the aid of manganese<br>
dioxide and subsequent hydrolysis of the amide formed<br>
with alkali to give the salt of the carboxylic acid.<br><br>
The electrodialysis then separates the carboxylic acid<br>
and sodium hydroxide solution from one another. In<br>
Example 3, in a column reactor with δ-manganese dioxide<br>
(amorphous) not described in more detail the formation<br>
of MHA amide at 50°C by hydrolysis of 2-hydroxy-<br>
4-methylthiobutyronitrile with a nitrile conversion of<br>
100% is reported at an MHA amide yield of even 100%. It<br>
was likewise impossible to confirm this result.<br>
Instead,. it was. found that, especially in a column<br>
reactor with high catalyst concentration, the oxidizing<br>
action of active manganese dioxide comes to bear. With<br>
simultaneous reduction of manganese4+, this leads to<br>
catalytically inactive Mn3+ and to increased formation<br><br>
of the sulphoxide. The reworking of this example which<br>
is quite similar to JP 09104665 also shows that the<br><br>
sulphoxide of 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyramide is<br>
formed with a selectivity of approx. 2% to more than<br>
4%.	<br><br><br>
The patent FR 2 750 9 87 solves the problem of the<br><br>
oxidation of sulphur by coating silicon dioxide with<br>
manganese dioxide. However, the catalyse contains only<br>
 5 to 10% of active catalyst constituents This must be<br><br>
balanced out by the use of a large amount of catalyst<br>
or by reaction times of 17 to 45 hours. For an<br>
industrial process, this procedure is disadvantageous.<br><br><br><br>
Against the background of the disadvantages of the<br>
prior art, the inventors were faced with the object of<br>
providing a catalyst based on manganese dioxide which<br>
catalyzes the hydrolysis of carbonitriles which bear<br>
easily oxidizable groups such as thiol| or thioether<br>
groups, especially corresponding hydroxyhitriles to the<br>
corresponding amides. The oxidizing action of this<br><br>
catalyst should be sufficiently low that cyanohydrins<br>
which bear oxidizable functional groups such as thiol<br>
or thioether groups, i.e., for example, 2-hydroxy-4-<br>
methylthiobutyronitrile, should also be hydrolysable<br>
with it without significant S-oxidation. It was a<br><br>
further object to provide a suitable preparation<br>
process for the catalyst. It was a third object to<br>
 provide a hydrolysis process which is readily<br><br>
performable industrially for carbonitriiles, which is<br>
applicable to carbonitriles which bear easily<br>
oxidizable groups such as thiol or thioether groups,<br>
especially corresponding hydroxynitriples, with the<br>
proviso that the disadvantages of the known processes,<br>
especially the easy oxidation of sulphur, take place<br>
only to a reduced degree, if at all. <br>
These objects, and also further objects which are not<br>
specified explicitly but which can immediately be<br><br>
derived or discerned from the connections discussed<br>
herein are achieved by a manganese dioxide catalyst<br>
according to Claim 1, by a process for its preparation<br>
according to Claim 6 and by a process for hydrolysing<br>
nitriles with the aid of an inventive catalyst<br>
according to Claim 16. Appropriate embodiments and<br>
modifications of the invention catalyst, and of the<br>
process for its preparation and for its use, are<br><br>
protected in the subclaims referring back to Claim 1, 6<br>
or 16.	<br>
The object was achieved in accordance with the<br>
invention by providing a manganese dioxide catalyst<br>
which contains at least 52% by weight of manganese,<br>
preferably at least 53% by weight of manganese, more<br>
preferably at least 55% by weight of manganese, and<br>
additionally at least one lanthanide compound.<br><br>
Surprisingly, it was found that the incorporation of<br>
small amounts of lanthanides into the manganese dioxide<br>
greatly reduced its undesired oxidizing action toward<br>
thioether or thiol groups without adversely affecting<br>
the catalytic action in the hydrolysis of<br>
carbonitriles.	<br>
In particular, the object is achieved by providing a<br>
catalyst of the type mentioned with the general<br>
formula:	<br>
MnMexMyOz, <br>
where x is between 0.05 and 0.002, y is between 0.06<br>
and 0.02 and z is between 1.7 and 2.0, Me is at least<br>
one element of lanthanides, M is an alkali metal<br>
(lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium), and<br>
additional water of hydration may be present.<br>
Elements particularly suitable in accordance with the<br>
invention from the group of the lanthanides are cerium<br>
and lanthanum. Particular preference is therefore given<br>
to catalysts in which Me is cerium and/or lanthanum.<br><br><br>
The manganese dioxides modified in accordance with the<br><br>
invention contain, in addition to lanthanide, as<br>
extraneous ions, preferably lithium) sodium or<br>
potassium, most preferably potassium, which is<br>
important in an advantageous manner for,the action in<br>
the catalysis of nitrile hydrolysis. Particular<br><br>
preference is thus also given to catalysts in which M<br>
is potassium.	<br>
The manganese dioxides modified in accordance with the<br>
invention have a specific surface area (BET) of 50 to<br>
550 m2/g, preferably of 150 to 400 m2/g, most preferably<br>
of 200 to 300 m /g, which is determined according to the<br>
test method DIN66131.	<br>
The preparation of the catalyst is simple and can be<br><br>
effected, for example, by a treatment of commercially<br><br>
available active manganese dioxide with an aqueous<br>
solution of a salt of the lanthanides. The inventive<br>
process for preparing the catalyst is characterized in<br>
that alkali metal-containing manganese dioxide is<br>
reacted with at least one lanthanide salt in aqueous<br><br>
solution or suspension, and the solid obtained is<br>
removed, optionally washed and dried. <br>
■ ;<br>
The process for preparing the catalyst is preferably<br><br>
performed in such a way that alkali metal-containing<br>
manganese dioxide is reacted with at least one<br>
lanthanide salt in aqueous solution or suspension in<br>
the suitable molar ratios, so as to obtain the<br><br>
resulting solid with the desired composition MnMexMyOz,<br>
and this is removed, optionally washed and then dried.<br>
Active manganese dioxide is typically prepared by the<br>
reaction of potassium permanganate with sulphuric acid<br>
solution of manganese(II) sulphate, as reported, for<br>
example, in EP412310 in Example 1. THE salt of the<br>
lanthanides can also be added to the reaction solution<br><br><br>
A preferred process for preparing the inventive<br>
catalyst consequently features, before and/or during<br>
the reaction of manganese dioxide with lanthanide salt,<br>
the direct preparation of the alkali metal-containing<br>
manganese dioxide from alkali metal Permanganate,<br>
preferably potassium permanganate, and manganese(II)<br>
sulphate in sulphuric acid solution. This is<br><br>
particularly inexpensive and affords particularly<br>
active catalysts.	<br>
Alkali metal-containing manganese dioxide is preferably<br><br>
prepared from approx. 2 molar equivalents of alkali<br><br>
metal permanganate and approx. 3 molar equivalents of<br>
manganese(II) sulphate.<br><br>
To prepare the catalyst, it is possible to use either<br>
inorganic or organic lanthanide salts,which further<br>
simplifies the catalyst preparation. <br><br><br><br>
In the case of the	inorganic lanthanide salts,<br>
preference is given to	using the halides, nitrates,<br>
sulphates or phosphates,	the phosphates being the most<br>
suitable.<br>
In the case of the organic lanthanide salts, preference<br>
is given to using the carboxylic salts, especially the<br>
formates or acetates.	<br><br>
Since the inventive catalysts preferably contain cerium<br>
and/or lanthanum, they are prepared preferably by using<br><br>
the corresponding cerium and/or lanthanum salts.<br>
The oxidizing action was the most reduced with<br>
trivalent salts of cerium; these are therefore used<br>
preferentially. It is also possible to use tetravalent<br>
salts of cerium for catalyst preparation.<br><br>
Preference is therefore given to employing a process in<br>
which trivalent and/or tetravalent salts, of cerium are<br>
used for catalyst preparation.	<br>
It has also been found that the most active catalysts<br>
are obtained when the manganese dioxide used is present<br>
in the crystal modification of α-manganese dioxide,<br>
especially in the case of use of commercia1 material.<br>
A further significant aspect of the invention is the<br>
use of the inventive catalysts for the hydrolysis of<br>
nitriles.	<br>
The inventive catalysts also feature, in addition to<br>
the reduced sulphoxide formation in the hydrolysis of<br>
thioether-containing nitriles, simultaneously the<br>
achievement of further activation of the manganese<br>
dioxide catalyst used compared to the manganese dioxide<br>
catalysts prepared without lanthanide salt.<br>
This is made clear especially by the comparison of the<br>
hydrolysis results of Example 5 (manganese dioxide<br><br>
catalyst without lanthanides), Example 6 (cerium-<br>
containing manganese dioxide catalyst) and Example 9<br>
(lanthanum-containing manganese dioxide catalyst).<br>
While the conversion of 95.3% (Example 5) rises to<br>
99.2% (Example 6) or 99.5% (Example 9) with<br>
approximately equal residence time, the selectivity<br>
with regard to undesired sulphoxide falls in the same<br>
series from 5.2% to 1.1% or 1.9%. <br>
The best activation of the catalyst and reduction of<br>
sulphoxide formation in the hydrolysis reaction is<br>
achieved by preparing the catalyst by the process<br>
according to the invention described above in aqueous<br><br>
solution or suspension. Mixing and trituration of the<br>
manqanese dioxide with the lanthanide salts in a more<br><br>
or less dry state leads only to limited success, as<br>
made clear by the comparison of Examples 5, 6 and 7.<br><br>
By performing a process for catalytically hydrolysing<br>
thioether (S-R)-.or thiol (S-H)-substituted, preferably<br>
S-R-substituted, carbonitriles of the general formula<br>
R1-CR2R3-CN to the corresponding carboxamides with the<br>
aid of the above-described inventive catalyst, where R1,<br>
R and R may be the same or different and are each<br>
hydrogen, at least one S-R- or S-H-substituted<br>
hydrocarbon radical and R is optionally a hydroxyl<br>
radical, where the particular hydrocarbon radical R1,<br>
R2, R3 is a linear or optionally branched C1- to Cio-<br>
alkyl radical, a C6- to C10-aryl radical, an O-, N-<br>
and/or S-containing C4- to Cs-heteroaryl radical or a<br>
C7- to C12-aralkyl radical, and the R radical is a<br>
linear or optionally branched C1- to C4-alkyl C6- to<br>
C10-aryl radical, an O-, N- and/or S-containing C4- to<br>
Cs-heteroaryl radical or a C7- to C12-aralkyl radical,<br>
the objects specified at the outset are achieved.<br><br>
Preference is given to using S-R- or S-H-substituted,<br><br>
especially S-R-substituted, carbonitriles in which R1 ,<br><br>
R2, R3, R are each C1- to C4-alkyl, phenyl, naphthyl,<br>
furyl, thienyl, imidazolyl, pyridyl, pyrimidyl or<br>
indolyl, benzyl or naphthylmethyl, in the case that R3<br>
is not a hydroxyl radical.	<br><br>
For example, in the case of 2-hydroxy-4-methylthio-<br>
butyronitrile, the process is notable for conversion<br>
rates of at least 96% up to 100%, depending on the<br>
precise selection of the conditions, Especially by<br>
virtue of sufficiently long reaction time, it is<br>
possible to achieve nitrile conversions of at least<br>
99%, preferably &gt; 99.5% and up to 100%. At the same<br>
time, the selectivities for the undesired S-oxidation<br>
products of 
the hydrolysis of carbonitriles containing thioether<br>
groups, selectivities of the undesired formation of<br><br>
sulphoxide products of significantly below 2% of<br>
theory, especially of preferably 
 <br>
preferably up to 
very particularly advantageous with regard to the end<br>
product purity and with regard to the significantly<br>
reduced purification complexity.	<br>
When used once, the catalyst does not lose its<br>
activity. It is therefore possible without any problem<br>
to separate the catalyst, after the hydrolysis reaction<br>
has ended, from the reaction solution, and to use it<br>
again. The reaction can therefore be performed<br>
continuously and batchwise.<br>
It has been found that, surprisingly, the oxidizing<br>
action of the catalyst on repeated use declines further<br><br>
without any deterioration in the performance for the<br><br>
hydrolysis reaction. Thus, the selectivity of undesired<br><br>
S-oxidation can be lowered down to 
of catalyst used is not critical and has an influence<br>
only on the reaction rate.<br>
It is particularly advantageous to use the catalyst in<br>
a continuous process. In this case, the nitrile can be<br>
hydrolysed by using catalyst-filled column reactors or<br><br>
else suspension reactors. It is also possible to select<br><br>
continuous stirred tank batteries or other embodiments<br>
■<br>
known to those skilled in the art. <br><br>
In this hydrolysis reaction, water is simultaneously<br>
solvent and reactant. The reaction is preferably<br>
performed in such a way that from 10 to 200 mol of<br>
water per mole of nitrile are used in the hydrolysis,<br><br>
more preferably from 2 0 to 100 mol of water. Especially<br>
in the case of hydrolysis of 2-hydroxy-4-methylthio-<br>
butyronitrile, the range between 20 and 100 mol of<br>
water per mole of nitrile is preferred. A larger amount<br>
of water is not harmful for the conversion and<br>
selectivity, but reduces the space-time yield.<br>
Wherever it is more favourable for the solubility or<br><br>
miscibility of the reactants used and hence of the<br>
nitrile used, but especially in the case of a small<br>
amount of water, an inert organic solvent such as C1- to<br>
C4 alcohols, C3- to C6-ketones, preferably acetone, may<br>
be added as a solubilizer.	<br>
The temperatures at which the process according to the<br>
invention is performed can be varied within a wide<br>
range. Advantageously, the hydrolysis of the nitrile<br>
is, however, performed at temperatures of 10 to 90°C;<br>
particular preference is given to a range from 2 0 to<br>
50°C.<br>
When cyanohydrins are used and higher temperatures of<br>
over 90°C are employed, the reformation of aldehyde and<br>
hydrogen cyanide from the cyanohydrin is promoted and<br><br>
undesired by-products are formed. Therefore, a<br>
temperature range of from 20°C to 50°C is very<br>
particularly preferred here.<br><br>
The process is preferably used to hydrolyse thioether<br>
(S-R) - or thiol (S-H)-substituted carbonitriles of the<br>
general formula R1-CR2-CN defined above, in which R3 is<br>
hydroxy1.	<br>
Among the corresponding cyanohydrin compounds<br>
R1 -CR2OH-CN, very particular preference is given to<br>
those in which R1, R2 and R are represented by the Ci-<br><br>
to C4-alkyl radicals as the alkyl radical, by phenyl or<br>
naphthyl as the aryl radical, by furyl, thienyl,<br>
imidazolyl, pyridyl, pyrimidyl or indolyl as the<br>
heteroaryl radical, and by benzyl or naphthylmethyl as<br>
the aralkyl radical.	<br><br>
In a quite outstanding manner, the process is suitable<br>
for hydrolysing 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyronitrile to<br>
the corresponding 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyramide.<br><br><br>
The process can additionally also be used for the<br><br>
hydrolysis of non-sulphur-containing cyanohydrins.<br>
Excellent yield and selectivities are Jachieved when<br>
acetone cyanohydrin is reacted under the above-<br>
specified conditions with an inventive manganese<br><br>
dioxide catalyst to give the isobutyramide, an<br>
important precursor for methacrylic acid compounds. The<br>
advantage here is in particular that it is possible<br>
with the same catalyst to hydrolyse S-R- and S-H-<br>
substituted nitriles and also unsubstituted nitriles.<br>
The process can thus be performed successively for<br>
sulphur-containing and for non-sulphur-containing<br>
nitriles in the same plant without a catalyst change,<br>
which advantageously increases the flexible usability<br>
of such plants.	<br>
The examples which follow are intended to illustrate<br>
the process without being restrictive. <br><br>
Preparation of the catalyst:	<br>
.	 	<br>
Example 1:	<br><br>
 30 g of commercially available α-manganese dioxide of<br>
the HSA type from Erachem with a content of 1.6%<br><br>
potassium, a manganese content of 55%, a particle size<br><br>
range of 3.0 to 5.5 microns and a surface area of<br>
230 m2/g together with 811 mg of cerium (III) phosphate<br>
in 300 ml of demineralized water were stirred at 60°C<br>
for 24 hours. Thereafter, the solid was filtered off by<br>
means of a suction filter and washed with 11 of<br>
demineralized water in 3 portions. The catalyst thus<br>
prepared was dried at 110°C and 50 mbar for 20 hours.<br>
The specific surface area of the catalyst after drying<br><br>
was 239 in m2/g, the cerium content 0.97%.<br>
Example 2:	<br><br><br>
Example 1 was repeated, except that 1.15 g of<br>
cerium(IV) sulphate were used instead of cerium(III)<br>
phosphate. The specific surface area of the catalyst<br>
thus prepared after drying was 266 m2/g. <br><br>
Example 3:	<br><br>
Example 1 was repeated, except that 1.4 g of<br>
lanthanum(III) nitrate hexahydrate were used instead of<br><br>
cerium(III) phosphate. The specific surface area of the<br><br>
catalyst thus prepared after drying was 283 in m2/g.<br>
; i<br>
■<br>
Example 4:<br>
A round-bottomed flask with stirrer and dropping funnel<br>
was initially charged with 14.2 g of potassium<br><br>
permanganate and 1.76 g of cerium(III) phosphate<br>
together with 550 ml of demineralized water and heated<br>
to 85°C. Within 2 minutes, a solution, of 10.14 g of<br>
manganese(II) sulphate in 250 ml of demineralized water<br><br><br>
together with 4.1 g of concentrated sulphuric acid was<br>
added dropwise with vigorous stirring. The resulting<br>
black suspension was stirred at 85°C for a further<br><br>
6 hours. After cooling to 25°C, the solid was removed<br><br>
by suction filtering and washed with 21 of water in<br>
5 portions. The catalyst was dried at 110°C and 50 mbar<br>
■<br>
over 14 hours.	<br><br>
.	<br>
Catalytic hydrolysis reaction:	<br><br>
Example 5: Comparative example (manganese dioxide<br>
catalyst without lanthanides)<br><br>
In a round-bottomed flask with mechanical stirring,<br>
2 .0 g of unchanged α-manganese dioxide (HSA type from<br><br>
Erachem) and 12 0 g of demineralized water were heated<br>
to 40°C in a waterbath, and 13.1 g of 2-hydroxy-4-<br>
methylthiobutyronitrile were added. After 2 hours, the<br>
conversion of the cyanohydrin was 95.13%. The HPLC<br><br>
analysis of the reaction solution showed a selectivity<br><br>
of 5.2% for the sulphoxide of 2-hydroxy-4-methyl-<br>
thiobutyramide.<br>
Example 6:<br>
The experiment of Example 5 was repeated, except that<br>
the catalyst used was 2.0 g of the catalyst modified<br><br>
with cerium(III) phosphate from Example 1. After a<br>
reaction time of 2 hours at 40°C, 99.2% of the<br>
cyanohydrin had been converted. The selectivity for the<br>
sulphoxide was 1.1%.	<br>
Example 7:	<br>
30 g of commercially available α-manganese dioxide (HSA<br>
type from Erachem) having a content of l.6% potassium<br>
and a surface area of 230 m2/g were mixed with 811 mg of<br>
cerium(III) phosphate and triturated finely in a<br>
mortar. 2.0 g of this mixture were used as the catalyst<br><br><br>
in the hydrolysis of 13.1 g of 2-hydroxy-4-methy1-<br>
thiobutyronitrile with 12 0 g of water at a temperature<br>
of 40°C. After 2 hours, 96.8% of the cyanohydrin had<br>
been converted. The selectivity for the undesired<br>
sulphoxide was 4.2%.<br>
Example 8:	<br>
The experiment from Example 5 was repeated, except that<br>
the catalyst used was 2.0 g of the catalyst modified<br>
with cerium(IV) sulphate from Example 2. After a<br>
reaction time of 2 hours at 45°C, 99.6 % of the<br>
cyanohydrin had been converted. The selectivity for the<br>
sulphoxide was 1.9%. 	<br>
Example 9:	<br>
The experiment from Example 5 was repeated, except that<br>
the catalyst used was 2.3 g of the catalyst modified<br>
with lanthanum nitrate from Example 3 . After a reaction<br>
time of 2.5 hours at 35°C, 99.5 % of the cyanohydrin<br>
had been converted. The selectivity for the sulphoxide<br>
was 1.9%.	<br>
Example 10:	<br><br>
In an experimental series, the catalyst was recycled.<br>
To this end, in a round-bottomed flask with mechanical<br>
stirring, 2.0 g of the modified manganese dioxide<br><br>
according to Example 1 were heated with 12 0 g of<br>
demineralized water to 40°C in a water bath, and 13.1 g<br><br>
of 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyronitrile were added.<br>
After 2.5 hours, the conversion of the cyanohydrin was<br><br>
99.8%. The selectivity for the sulphoxide was 1.1%.<br>
Thereafter, the catalyst was filtered off and used<br>
again in the hydrolysis reaction under the same<br>
conditions. This operation was performed a further 5<br>
times. Thereafter, the cyanohydrin conversion was still<br>
99.8%; the selectivity for the sulphoxide declined to<br><br><br>
0.2%.	<br><br>
Example 11: Comparative example (according to<br>
JP 09104665, Example 2)	<br><br>
A glass column (diameter 1 cm, length 10 cm) was<br>
charged with 10 g of manganese dioxide catalyst<br>
(prepared according to JP 09104665, Example 1). A 10%<br>
by weight aqueous 2-hydroxy-4-methy[lbutyronitrile<br>
solution was pumped through the column in<br>
countercurrent at 10 g/h at 40°C. The effluent solution<br>
was analysed by means of HPLC. The run time was<br>
100 hours from the start of the reaction. This gave a<br>
nitrile conversion of 96.1% of theory, an amide yield<br>
of 79.8% of theory ( = 83.0% selectivity) and a yield of<br>
1.5% of theory of MHA amide sulphpxide (= 1.6%<br>
selectivity) . The amide yield reported in JP09104665<br>
Example 2 of at least 99.1% with 100% nitrile<br>
conversion could not be confirmed in any way. The<br>
yields decline even further when precisely 15% aqueous<br>
2-hydroxy-4-methylbutyronitrile is used, since an oily<br>
second phase comprising predominantly nitrile separates<br>
out, which covers the catalyst and prevents uniform<br>
conversion.	<br>
In an analogously performed batch experiment, 2 g of<br>
manganese dioxide catalyst (prepared according to JP<br>
09104665, Example 1) were reacted with 0.1 mol of 2-<br>
hydroxy-4-methylbutyronitrile as a 10% by weight<br>
aqueous solution at 40°C within 3.5 hours. The amide<br>
yield was 81.6% of theory (= 84.1% selectivity), the<br><br>
nitrile conversion 97.0% of theory. The yield of MHA<br>
amide sulphoxide 4.0% of theory (= 4.1% selectivity)<br>
based on nitrile used.	<br><br>
