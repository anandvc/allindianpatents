This  invention relates to a composite propellant  containing<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
application. Hydro thermal production  of active copper oxide is carried out by adding stoichiometric  quantities of sodium hydroxide  solution to a copper salt solution to obtain meta-stable crystals  of hydrated precursors containing  copper, maintaining the temperature of the reaction mixture below its reflux  point to hydrothermally decompose the  precursor  to precipitate copper oxide which is separated’  washed and dried•   Copper  oxide prepared according to  this  technique exhibits exceptionally high catalytic activity due  to  its higher surface Area    It is also found that Marginally lower quantity  of this compound is required to impart the  desired burn  rates  when  compared to  the  conventional  burn . rate modifier, copper chromate.  Lower pressure exponent  is  also observed  in  comparison with copper  chromite  modifier  •, Active copper oxide is found to catalyse both low  and  high temperature   decomposition  of    ammonium   perchlorates. Accelerated  ageing studies of composite  propellants  having active  copper oxide show  that they exhibit very good  shelf life  without  any variation in burning rate  values.   These facts establish  that  the  propellant  envisaged  by   this invention  exhibits  unforeseen  properties  and   synergestic action  of  the  components.   It  is  understood  that   the proportion of the components of the slurry other than  active copper  oxide  is known to persons skilled in  the  art  and needs no special elaboration.<br>
The   composite  propellant  according  to   this   invention comprises  finely  divided   ammonium perchlorates,  known<br><br>
metallic fuels, polymers, curing agents, and 0.25X to 1% by weight of active copper oxide as burn rate modifier, the said active coppery oxide being produced by adding stanchion metric quantities of sodium hydroxide solution to a copper salt solution, to precipitate meta - stable crystals of hydrated precursors containing copper, maintaining the temperature of the reaction mixture below its reflux point to hydro -thermally decompose, the said precursor to active copper oxide.<br>
Hydroxy1 terminated polybutadiene is preferred polymer  used in  preparing  the propellant of  this  invention.  Hydroxy1 terminated polybutadiene having a molecular weight  of 2500, polydispersity of 2.0-2.2 and a viscosity of 4000 to 6000 cps at 30  is preferred .  The hydroxy1 number may vary  from 40 to 46. Ammonium perchlorates may be a bimodal distribution of average particle size of 45 and 300 microns, metallic fuel used may be aluminium powder of the average particle size  15 microns.  Characteristic features of active copper  oxide  in comparison with copper chromite is shown in table I.   Table II,  III,  and IV show   candidate  propellant  formulations, effect  of  concentration  ACO on  mechanical  and  ballistlc properties  of  HTPB - AP propellant and  accelerated  ageing data on ACO catalyzed HTPB  propellant respectively.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
From the table* it im clear that the burn rate of the propel lent   enhanced up to 377. when up to 0.257. of activated copper oxide is used ‘while 0.5% of activated copper oxide increases it to S6X, whereas addition of 1% of ACQ lowers the rate slightly.<br>
Active copper oxide unlike other transition metal oxides, catalyses both the low temperature and the high temperature decomposition  of ammonium per chlorate. The amount  of  acid sites  and  surface area  influence  the decomposition  of ammonium per chlorate favourably.  It is well postulated that during  decomposition»  the perchloric acid migrates  to  the catalyst  surface by surface diffusion and decomposes  there heterogeneously.  Active CuO, being a p-type semi  conductor, with  positive  holes in the d-orbitals has  the  ability  to accept electrons from  the absorbed HCIO’ thus favoring  the decomposition  process.  When chemisorbed in a surface HCIO’ can interact with electron accepter sites.  With increase in pressure, an increase in burning rate is observed.  At higher pressure’ the burning rate is controlled by the gas phase reactions occuring due to the high heat release close to the burning  surface of  the propellant.  In  the  ammonium  per chlorate  based HTPB  propellant, the catalyst acts on  HCIO’ or its decomposition products in the gas phase.  Naturally at high pressures, more gas phase collision between the catalyst and the oxidizer fragments would occur in the region close to the  burning  surface.  The above explanation  justifies  the enhanced  burning  rate  and  pressure  sensitivity  of   the<br><br>
propellants. The physic-mechanical properties of the cured propellant such   tensile strength, elongation, modulus and hardness   listed table 3. The mechanical properties of the HTPB propel lent with Active Copper Oxide,   the one without burn rate modifier   quite comparable as seen from Table 3- The effect of concentration of Active Copper Oxide on mechanical properties shown in Table 3 reveals that the mechanical properties are more or less unaffected by the concentration of Active Copper Oxide.<br>
Ageing data has been generated to understand the influence of this burn rate modifier on storage of the propellant and to predict the shelf life of the propellant. Accelerated ageing studies conducted with test specimen of ASTM standard, over a period of 60 days at 60*’ show that there is no marked change in the properties of the Active Copper Oxide catalysed propellant, as seen from Table 4. The accelerated ageing period of 60 days at 60*’C corresponds to an ambient ageing of the propel lant for a period of a|5put 2 years. The mechanical properties show marginal variation, whereas the burning rate values does not show any change with ageing. This shows that the propellant with Active Copper Oxide has good shelf life for any mission application.<br>
In view of the above features , the high performance HTPB propel lant containing active copper oxide ill-timed in this invention , is a better potential candidate propellant in rockets and launch vehicle solid motors.<br><br>
Composite propellants according to this invention is prepared by propellant mixing operation in a horizontal sigma or vertical change can mixer. The liquid ingredient are premixed and charged into the mixer followed by the addition of metal 1ic fuel, oxidiser blend and finally the curing agents. The mixing’ operations are continued for a period of 3 hours at ambient temperatures up to 40’C till a homogeneous slurry is obtained. The cast ability of the slurry is obtained by measuring the viscosity at regular intervals of 30mts for a period of 3 to 5 hours. The slurry is then desecrated. and cast into polypropylene cartons as a residual pressure of 3 to 5 torrs. Cast slurry is heated in an oven for an optimum period of 5 days at 60*’C. The oven may be heated by circulated hot water through the same . The mechanical properties and the burn rates of the propellants are then evaluated by known means.<br>
The process for preparing a composite propellant according to this invention comprises mixing known liquid polymers metal lie fuels, finely divided ammonium perchlorates and from 0.257. to   by weight of active copper oxide obtained by adding stoichiometric amounts of sodium hydroxide to a copper salt solution f maintaining the reaction temperature below the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture to precipitate the said active copper oxide and a curing agent to form a homogeneous slurry , casting and heating the said cast slurry<br><br>
to produce the composite propellant.<br>
