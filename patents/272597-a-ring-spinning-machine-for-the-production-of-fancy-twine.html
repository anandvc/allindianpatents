DEVICE AND METHOD FOR SUPPLYING FLAMES TO RING SPINNING<br>
MACHINES<br>
The invention relates to a device and a method for generating fancy yarns/twines on spinning machines, in particular ring spinning machines.<br>
It is known that programmed yarn thickenings can be generated on ring spinning machines in that the draft of the slivers in the drawframe of the ring spinning machines is varied in a directed manner. These effects are also called basic flames and consist of continuously drafted single-colored or multicolored fiber strands which have programmable yarn thickenings of approximately 3 to 10 cm. In contrast to this, supplied flames are differently colored thickenings in the yarn or twine which contain different fiber material. A twine in this case consists of at least two carrier yarns which are twisted with one another in a device provided for this purpose. Supplied flames can be programmed continuously, in variable thicknesses or by start/stop operation. The use of various kinds of fiber materials allows a versatile flexible utilization of the different dye affinity according to market requiieiaeiiLa . Double and multiple drawfram.cs, which in a controlled manner feed, programmed, differently or uniformly drafted fiber strands to one and the same delivery point in the region of a pair of delivery rollers, have already been published in previous years. Some methods and devices known from the prior art are presented in more detail below. As is shown, all the methods are based on devices optimized for this purpose .<br>
Supplied flames which are fed in between two or more carrier threads are also present in fancy twine machines,  such as are used,  for example,  for coarse<br>
2<br><br>
yarn counts. Disadvantages are the coarse spindle divisions, the small production units and the absence of fiber suction-extraction plants, and therefore these are unsuitable for fine yarn (for example, yarn counts NM 30-70) . The production of fancy yarns in large quantities is therefore not economically possible.<br>
DE2321762 (henceforth DE'762) was applied for in 1973 in the name of the company Braschler &amp; Cie and relates to a device for the mixing of yarns. The device described in DE'762 is attributable to the same inventor of the invention disclosed below. DE'762 is aimed at a device for the mixing of roving for the generation of fancy yarns, in which there is no need for a basic roving which runs through continuously. All the rovings can be varied equally, and there is the possibility of working with more than two rovings. The device has at least two delivery units, each for a roving, and a common exit delivery unit, a guide device, lying between the exit delivery unit and the delivery units, for the convergence of the rovings, a drive device for driving the delivery units at a variable speed and a control device for the individual control of the drives of the delivery units. The device is advantageous for the production of fancy yarn or fancy twine. It is suitable for installation in spinning or twisting machines. The de^'ice is restricted to the processing of different rovings. To generate flames in various colors, the rovings are supplied intermittently or at alternating speed by means of a quadruple drawframe. The device has a comparatively complicated set-up.<br>
DE4041301 (henceforth DE'301) was filed in 1990 in the name of Amsler-Iro AG and is attributable to the same inventor of the invention on which this patent application is based. DE'301 relates to a method and a device for producing a fancy yarn on a ring spinning machine.  In contrast to the older prior art,  DE'301<br><br>
discloses a finely regulatable spinning machine of compact build for the production of fancy yarns. The speed variations required for generating the fancy yarn are made possible by means of servomotors and an electronic control. The device mentioned in DE'301 is suitable for use with the invention disclosed in this application.<br>
DE3206431 was applied for in 1982 in the name of Zinser Textilmaschinen AG and shows a method for the production of a fancy yarn. Upon entry into a drawframe, a sliver is wound around with at least one filament yarn. This wound-around sliver is drafted by means of a drawframe, so that the filament yarn is torn. The sliver is subsequently wound with the roving twisted together with filament yarn fragments. The twisted roving is subsequently drafted on a ring spinning machine and twisted into a fancy yarn.<br>
DE707116 was filed in 1938 in the name of Rudolf Landwehr and relates to a fancy twine machine for the production of fancy yarns, such as looped, chenille or crimped yarns. In the fancy twine machine, two delivery units arranged one behind the other are used. The rear delivery unit running more slowly delivers the basic thread or basic threads, while the front delivery unit running more quickly delivers the thread or threads which are intended for looping or crimping. In order to combine the basic threads, which are delivered by the delivery unit running more slowly, with the threads of the front delivery unit, the pressure roller resting on the front delivery unit is provided with grooves through which the basic threads of the rear delivery unit are allowed to pass. The device is designed only for the processing of threads.<br>
DE1149650 was filed in 1958 in the name of "Hamel, Projektierungs- und Verwaltungs AG" and shows a device for production of fancy twines having a high elastic<br><br>
stretch. This is achieved in that elastic material, for example crimped yarn, is used as the core thread. The core thread is stretched out between two delivery units. Immediately before or upon entry into the last delivery unit, one or more threads generating the effect are supplied at a uniform or changing speed. After exit from the last delivery unit on the way to the twisting arrangement, the core threads contract on account of the reduced tension, so that the desired effect is established. In connection with figure 2, an exemplary embodiment for the production of a fancy twine with flame effects is described, in which three delivery units are employed. An elastic core thread is stretched between a first delivery unit and a second delivery unit. Roving is supplied via a further delivery unit and results in a thickening in the core thread on account of relaxation after it leaves its delivery unit. This is a special device which has hitherto not really achieved commercial success. One problem is that the device is suitable only for the production of the special yarns described.<br>
CH519039 was applied for in 1970 in the name of "Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation" and shows a device and a method for the production of a uniform yarn from at least two running slivers. The slivers are supplied separately from a supply point to a convergence point and are twisted uniformally into a yarn at the convergence point. A device provided for carrying out the production method has in each case a drawframe for supplying a sliver from a supply point to a convergence point. The device has, furthermore, an arrangement for the intermittent variation of the path length between the convergence point and the supply point of the slivers. One embodiment consists essentially of a conventional spinning drawframe with multiple drafting arrangement, which drawframe is arranged such that it can supply a sliver to the traveler of a spinning spindle. However,<br><br>
the spinning drawframe is modified to the effect that only a single spindle is located in each case between two drafting arrangements and in the middle between these. A further embodiment has only one drawframe which is suitable for treating both yarns. The device is not suitable for the production of fancy yarns with flames.<br>
JP11350265 (henceforth JP'265) was filed in 1998 in the name of Suzuki Sangyo KK. JP'265 is aimed at a spinning device which is suitable for the continuous spinning of different yarns. According to the published figures, above a spinning station, two yarn rolls are arranged, the yarn of which is supplied to a spinning station via a selection and delivery part.<br>
The object of the invention is to show a method for the production of fancy yarn or fancy twines on a ring spinning machine and a device for carrying out the method.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is to show a device which is suitable for use with existing fully automatic spinning machines, in particular ring spinning machines, having a multiplicity of spindles (as a rule, up to 1200) and which is distinguished by its simple opeiatioa, thread routing and monitoring.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is to show a device which makes it possible to show fine ring spinning machines, modified according to the invention, for many variants of niche yarns, inter alia basic flames, core yarns, core yarns with non-elastic filament, boucle yarns and other twist effects.<br>
A further aspect is to show a device which, in the event of thread breaks, does not cause any problematic yarn accumulations, or in which the spinning station affected is interrupted in a controlled manner.<br><br>
The  object  is  achieved  by  means  of  the  invention defined in the independent patent claims.<br>
One solution for achieving the object is based on producing a fancy twine with at least two carrier yarns and thickenings (flames) from further fibers by means of a ring spinning machine designed or converted especially for this purpose. Ring spinning machines known from the prior art which are suitable for the production of fancy yarns have one or more spinning stations, each with a drawframe, which serves for drafting a roving or a plurality of rovings. The spinning machines are configured such that the delivery speed of certain regions of the drawframes can be varied abruptly, so that the fibers forming the yarn are accumulated in a controlled manner. In order to avoid thin places, a controlled overfeed or underfeed also sometimes takes place. When the drawframe no longer delivers any fibers, the spinning process is interrupted. By means of a pair of entry rollers, roving is taken off from a roving roll via deflections and is supplied to a pair of belts which bear one against the other and are driven by means of belt rollers and which are tensioned by means of belt guides. The belts are followed, as seen in a conveying direction, by a pair of delix'^ery rollers which receive the drafted roving projecting between the belts and convey it to a spinning triangle lying downstream of the delivery rollers. In the spinning triangle, the fibers of the roving which are hitherto oriented approximately parallel and are drafted in relation to one another are twisted into a yarn, in that a metal ring (traveler) rotates on a circular path (ring) around a spindle. The fibers twisted into the yarn are wound onto a spinning tube plugged onto the spindle, to form a cop. In this conventional ring spinning process, the fibers coming from the drawframe form the actual yarn.  Since  the  entry  rollers,  the  belts  and  the<br>
7<br><br>
delivery rollers of the drawframe have different conveying speeds, the fibers of the roving are uniformally drawn apart or drafted. In the generation of fancy yarns, the absolute and the relative conveying speeds of the individual regions of the drawframe are influenced, so that a discontinuous conveyance of the fibers results and thickenings occur in the yarn. In the case of conventional fancy yarns, however, the fiber delivery is never switched off entirely, since the spinning process is otherwise interrupted.<br>
A fancy yarn according to the invention has essentially two or mo]?e intertwisted carrier yarns having identical or different properties. If required, the fancy yarn has further fibers which are supplied between the carrier yarns by means of a drawframe before these are twisted together. These further fibers have a uniform distribution, as seen in the longitudinal direction, or are present in the form of local thickenings (flames). Further combinations are possible. The supply of the additional fibers is preferably controlled by means of a modified flame-forming device of a ring spinning machine.<br>
The carrier yarns are supplied at a defined lateral distance from one another to the yarn-forming process of Q ring spinning station in the region of the spinning triangle. In one embodiment, the carrier yarns are supplied to the spinning process via a carrier yarn guide means and/or by means of a continuously or discontinuously driven pair of rollers. At the same time, fibers of a roving are treated regularly or irregularly according to a predefined sequence by means of the drawframe and are likewise supplied to the spinning process by means of a pair of rollers. Depending on the field of use and the effect to be achieved, the pair of rollers may be the take-off rollers of the drawframe or another guide means, for example a separate pair  of rollers or yarn guides<br><br>
arranged next to one another. If necessary, at least one of the rollers has a specially profiled cross section which is suitable for receiving, guiding and/or nipping the carrier yarns. In one embodiment, one of the rollers has two continuous grooves which are arranged according to the distance between the carrier yarns and which serve for the pressureless leadthrough of these.<br>
Good results are achieved with comparatively simple carrier yarn guide devices which, in relation to the running direction of the carrier yarn in the direction of the carrier yarn bobbins, have one or more eyes which serve for receiving one or more carrier yarns. The eyes are preferably of spiral and slotted design, such that the carrier yarns can be introduced jointly or singly in a simple way. Below the eye, as seen in the running direction of the carrier yarns, is located a separator which, during operation, is arranged between the carrier yarns and keeps these at a defined distance from one another. If required, the separator may be designed such that it is suitable for plugging on a tube consisting, for example, of ceramic or of another suitable material. By means of tubes of different diameter, the distance between the carrier yarns can be set in a simple way. In a further embodiment the carrier \^arn guide de"^^! '^e has loer spinning station an eccentric for setting the relative distance between the carrier yarns. The eccentric can be deflected in the lateral direction by rotation about an axis which runs approximately perpendicularly with respect to the direction of the carrier yarns.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, approximately above each drawframe of a ring spinning machine, one or more carrying devices are provided which are suitable for receiving yarn bobbins having carrier yarn. The carrying devices are in this case arranged such that they do not come into conflict with existing elements<br><br>
of the spinning device, in particular the traveling blower and the roving bobbins. At least two carrier yarns are supplied in each case in a controlled manner to a drawframe in the region of the spinning triangle by means of thread guides. Depending on the field of use, in each case two or more carrier yarns are wound on the yarn bobbins, thus reducing the number of carrier yarn bobbins required per spinning station to one. If required, instead of one yarn roll, two or more laterally offset yarn rolls arranged behind, above or next to one another and having only one carrier yarn may also be provided, although this entails a certain extra outlay and an increased space requirement.<br>
In contrast to conventional ring spinning yarns, the fibers supplied by the drawframe no longer, as a rule, have a carrying function and are replaced completely or partially in their function by the carrier yarns. Instead, the fibers supplied from the drawframe serve for generating effects, for example of an optical nature, in the form of thickenings or for generating color variations or for influencing the physical properties of the yarns obtained. In contrast to conventional ring spinning processes, the fiber supply by the drawframe is completely or only partially prevented, or switched off, depending on the effect to De acnievea.<br>
In order to avoid the situation where, in the event of a break of one of the carrier yarns, an unwanted accumulation of carrier yarn occurs, a check device or a thread monitoring system may be provided, which automatically interrupts the supply of carrier yarn to the affected spinning station in the event of the break of one of the carrier yarns. In one embodiment, the check device has a rocker which is held in equilibrium by the carrier yarns and which is operatively connected to a separation device. If, then, one of the carrier yarns supplied in pairs per spinning station breaks,<br>
10<br><br>
the rocker is deflected, so that the supply of the second carrier yarn is also interrupted in a controlled manner by means of the separation device. Moreover, the check device is preferably set up such that the carrier yarns can be threaded in in a simple way, for example by being introduced from front to rear, and by means of a wedge they come to lie separately, on both sides of the rocker, at locations provided for this purpose. Depending on the embodiment, the check device is configured such that the carrier yarns are held in position in the event of a thread break, but the supply is interrupted. Depending on the field of use, however, it is more beneficial to arrange the check device such that, in the event of a break of one of the carrier yarns, the remaining carrier yarn is likewise separated, and the free ends of the carrier yarns are wound onto the carrier yarn bobbin. The risk of operating faults due to the free carrier yarns is thereby reduced.<br>
In one embodiment, at least two carrier yarns are supplied to the process, upstream of the delivery rollers, as seen in a running direction, from at least two additional thread rolls via thread guide and control mechanisms designed according to the invention. The carrier yarns are led through between the delivery rdlors and then pass ini~o the spinning triangle where they are twisted with one another as a result of the rotation of the traveler and of the cop, to form a yarn, and are then wound onto the cop. Depending on the embodiment, the carrier yarns are conveyed primarily by the driven delivery rollers or other aids. The carrier yarns are oriented and spaced apart by means of the thread guides such that fibers supplied by means of the drawframe pass, at least in regions, between the carrier yarns before they are twisted with one another in the spinning triangle. The result of this is that the fibers supplied by the drawframe become, in the spinning  triangle,   a  constituent  of  the  thread<br>
11<br><br>
obtained. Depending on how the fibers are delivered by the drawframe, different effects arise. In the case of continuous conveyance, for example, a thread is obtained which consists of the two carrier yarns and of the uniformly supplied fibers from the drawframe. The overall thickness of the thread in this case results from the thickness of the carrier yarns and the quantity of the supplied fibers from the drawframe. In the case of a change in the quantity of fibers supplied by means of the drawframe, a yarn with a varying thickness is obtained. By virtue of an abrupt change in the fiber quantity supplied by means of the drawframe, flames of different length and configuration can be achieved. There is likewise the possibility of interrupting the fiber supply by means of the drawframe completely, so that the resulting yarn consists only of the carrier yarns. Further parameters arise from the supply speed and the mass flow. Depending on the yarn to be achieved, the drawframe itself, which has hitherto served for the actual primary fiber supply, has only a secondary function, for example for generating yarn effects.<br>
The arrangement and make-up (preparation) of the feed bobbins containing the carrier yarns are preferably arranged below the existing roving creel and above the drawframe. It is thereby possible to dvoid deLiimeut to the traveling blower. A further advantage is that these components can thus be installed in a simple way in existing spinning machines, without these having to be substantially modified.<br>
Guide separators position the attached feed bobbins in the longitudinal direction of the carrier cylinders and make it possible to have a parking position which is contact-free with respect to the carrier cylinder or carrier cylinders. In one embodiment, one or more carrier cylinders (feed cylinders) driven positively at an adjustable ratio to the delivery rollers of the<br>
12<br><br>
drawframe carry the carrier yarn bobbins. The carrier yarn bobbins (feed bobbins) either lie directly, at least in regions, on at least one carrier cylinder along a surface area or are operatively connected to the latter. For example, the carrier yarn bobbins can lie simultaneously on two carrier cylinders lying one behind the other. The feed bobbins are supported and guided laterally by means of guide separators. If required, the guide separators have further guide means for the carrier yarn bobbins, which guide means are suitable, for example, for receiving a shaft or a shaft stub of the carrier yarn bobbin. In one embodiment, two guide separators arranged opposite one another have guide slots which run obliquely or vertically upward approximately radially with respect to the carrier cylinders and which are oriented with one another in the axial direction such that they are suitable for receiving a shaft of a carrier yarn bobbin. If required, the guide slots have, in the rear region facing away from the carrier cylinder, a saddle surface in which the shaft of the carrier bobbin can be brought into a parking position, so that the carrier yarn bobbin is no longer operatively connected to the carrier cylinder. The described arrangement of the carrier cylinders is a factor in a successful conversion of existing fancy yarn spinning machines, since only in Lhis way does it becomie possible to have a space-saving arrangement.<br>
If required, variable drawing zones between the carrier cylinder and delivery rollers of the drawframe may be provided, by means of which the tension and the draft of the carrier yarn can be set.<br>
In one embodiment, the tension of the carrier yarn is compensated by stirrup pieces which precede the carrier cylinders and are arranged parallel or askew to these. The stirrup pieces have a region which is in contact with the carrier yarns during the unwinding of the<br>
13<br><br>
latter. This region of the stirrup piece has approximately the width of a carrier yarn bobbin. In particular, since the stirrup pieces are arranged at an angle to the axis of the carrier cylinders, the tension of the carrier yarn is compensated. If required, the stirrup pieces may be operatively connected to a release mechanism, by means of which the carrier yarn bobbins can be lifted by means of a simple manual action out of a parking position and brought into the working position. Good results are achieved in that the release mechanism acts on both sides on the shaft stubs of the carrier yarn bobbin.<br>
The carrier cylinders are preferably arranged one behind the other in pairs and parallel to the longitudinal direction of the spinning machine (transversally to the spindles). Depending on the type of machine, there is the possibility of designing the carrier cylinder or carrier cylinders such that they extend only over certain regions or over the entire length of the spinning machine.<br>
The carrier cylinders are preferably driven laterally and rotate essentially at a constant speed which is co-ordinated with the conveying speed of the delivery cylinders of the associated drawframe or drawframes, so that an optimal supply of carrier yarn is ensured. The drive speed is adjustable within a certain range (for example, +/-5%), so that different circumstances and yarn tensions can be taken into account. If required, the carrier cylinders are driven discontinuously, the carrier threads not being nipped in the pair of take-off rollers (for example, a roller with continuous grooves), and the pulling direction of the traveler and of the cop bringing about the take-off. This variant makes it possible to generate looped, knotted and boucle effects on ring spinning machines.<br>
14<br><br>
The carrier cylinders may also consist of a plurality of segments which are operatively connected to one another at their ends. This allows maximum flexibility, for example during subsequent installation or when wear phenomena occur. The carrier cylinders may likewise be co-ordinated ideally with the carrier yarn to be processed.<br>
In one embodiment, the segments of the carrier cylinders are operatively connected by means of connection elements which serve at the same time as bearing elements in that they lie with a rotationally symmetrical outer face on one or more guide rolls supported with respect to the spinning machine. In order to achieve an increase in traction, the carrier cylinders may have traction-increasing surfaces, for example in the form of groovings or coatings.<br>
In one embodiment, the feed bobbins are cheese-wound, that is to say they contain two or more carrier threads deposited in parallel. If required, there is the possibility of providing one or more pairs of carrier yarns on one feed bobbin. A plurality of spinning stations can consequently be served from only one feed bobbin. This affords the advantage that the number of carrier yarn bobbins required can be reduced. A further advantage is that only a very small amount of space is required, and therefore the device is suitable even for use on ring spinning machines intended for cotton and having a very close division (distance between individual spinning stations) of around 70 to 82.5 mm. If more space is available, there is the possibility of using two individual carrier yarn bobbins instead of one cheese-wound carrier yarn bobbin. The defined draft between the delivery roller of the drawframe and the at least one feed cylinder controls the desired tensioning and compensates tension fluctuations.<br>
15<br><br>
One embodiment has a carrier yarn guide which is arranged in the region of the take-off rollers. The carrier yarn guide is fastened to the roving traversing profile of the ring spinning machine via a mounting. This ensures an optimized synchronization of the carrier yarns and of the roving.<br>
A further factor is an active monitoring of the carrier yarns by means of a thread monitoring system which is preferably arranged upstream of the delivery cylinder. The thread monitoring system checks whether all the carrier yarns necessary for the spinning process are actually present. Should one of the carrier yarns be missing, this leads to a discontinuation of the spinning process, for example in that the thread monitoring system likewise prevents the supply of the remaining carrier yarns in a controlled manner or returns them by means of a drive of the feed bobbin. A thread monitoring system contains, as a rule, a thread-sensor and thread-separation device which co-operates with the carrier yarns between the feed bobbin and the delivery roller of the carrier cylinder. The position is preferably synchronized with the fiber material flow such that the incorporation of the fiber material supplied to the spinning machine by means of the drawframe is optimized, for example for forming a<br>
A mechanical embodiment of the thread sensor operates with thread pretension. Via a rocker which is pretensioned by means of a spring and can be equally deflected symmetrically to the left and to the right, the presence of the threads is checked in that the threads keep the rocker in a middle position as a result of their pretension. If, then, one of the two carrier threads is missing, the pretension of the remaining thread is sufficient to deflect the rocker such that the remaining thread is interrupted. This ensures that, without carrier threads, no false yarn is<br>
16<br><br>
spun.- If required, the middle position of the rocker can be ensured in a defined way by means of suitable centering elements until a certain deflection force is reached. In one embodiment, this is achieved by means of a magnet which in the middle position exerts on the rocker a force which is sufficiently high that the rocker is not deflected in an uncontrolled manner even under oscillations or vibrations. In this embodiment, the magnitude of the force may be set, for example, by means of the distance between the magnet and rocker. A thread sensor according to the invention is preferably distinguished by a simple thread-in capacity. Alternative embodiments are possible. An essential factor is the simple thread-in capacity of the carrier yarns on the running spinning machine.<br>
If required, a carrier yarn guide device is arranged in the region of the take-off rollers so as to be finely adjustable in distance and/or orientation. Depending on the embodiment, it is arranged in a traversing (laterally deflecting) manner on the roving traversing profile or stationarily with respect to the delivery rollers.<br>
A supply of the effect-forming fibers takes place preferably via a modified basic-flame plant. This contains a programmable control for the desired types of flame forms and flame sequences. One feature is an adapted advancing movement of the drawframe by means of an adapted ramp during run-up and during braking. Expediently, the supply is accelerated at the start, and, after flame formation, the feed drawframe is not only braked, but also reversed a little way, so that residual fibers lying with the tip in the region of the nip of the delivery cylinders are not carried along undesirably between the flames, consequently causing fiber soiling. As has been shown, the operation of the spinning machine in the normal production mode (running state) for the normal spinning is readily possible. For<br>
17<br><br>
the "injected slub" operating mode, there are two components which have to be treated individually and stopped per spindle and have to be capable of being pieced up again individually. Particularly in the event of a thread break and the rectification of this, problems may arise in running operation in the case of three and four cylinder spinning machines, since the reciprocating carrier is simultaneously put under pressure in each case for two spindles, and individual pressure rollers cannot be lifted off. A factor of the invention is based on eliminating this problem. A special delivery cylinder (pressure roller) contains, on both sides of the reciprocating carrier, a lifting-off device, for example in the form of an eccentric supporting roll, which in the activated state lifts off the pressure roller individually, while the second pressure roller can continue to operate in the correct position. This achieves the aim of making it possible to interrupt all the running processes per spindle .<br>
The components of a fancy yarn device according to the invention, as described, which do not typically belong to a commercially available ring spinning machine are suitable for this purpose in the form of a construction kit to be provided for converting a commercially a-s^ai Table ring spinning machine. Such a construction kit contains essentially a carrier yarn holder for receiving at least one carrier yarn bobbin per drawframe of a spinning station. Further, the construction kit contains a carrier yarn guide, co-ordinated with the carrier yarn holding device, for feeding in at least two carrier yarns, spaced apart from one another, in the region of a pair of rollers arranged upstream of a spinning triangle. The carrier yarn guide of the construction kit may have an inner guide which serves for deflecting the carrier yarns upstream of the spinning triangle. Depending on the field of use and on the ring spinning machine,  the<br><br>
inner guide may be designed as a roller, stirrup piece or eccentric or as an element of E-shaped cross section. In one embodiment of the construction kit, the carrier yarn holder has a carrier cylinder which is arranged in the longitudinal direction of the ring spinning machine and is driven rotatably about its longitudinal axis and which is operatively connected during the spinning process to at least one carrier yarn bobbin of a spinning station. In this embodiment, during the spinning process, the carrier cylinder is operatively connected to a surface area of the carrier yarn bobbin. Other embodiments are possible. If required, per carrier yarn bobbin, a lifting-off device is present which serves for temporarily interrupting the operative connection between the carrier yarn bobbin and carrier cylinder, in that the carrier yarn bobbin is decoupled from the drive. The lifting-off device may be arranged rotatably about the carrier cylinder or about another axis. In one embodiment, it has a sickle-shaped cross section. Since the carrier cylinder consists of a plurality of standardized segments, the ends of which can be operatively connected directly to one another or via intermediate elements, the length can be set to different ring spinning machines in a flexible way. The intermediate elements may serve as part of a rotation-free bearing. In one embodimenL of Lhe corisLruction kit, the carrier yarn holder has per carrier yarn bobbin two guide separators which are spaced apart from one another and which are arranged essentially perpendicularly with respect to a carrier cylinder, in such a way that at least one carrier yarn bobbin can in each case be arranged between them, which, during operation, is operatively connected at least temporarily to at least one carrier cylinder along a surface line. The guide separators may have guide means in the form of slots which serve for receiving a shaft of a carrier yarn bobbin and are arranged radially with respect to a carrier cylinder. The carrier cylinder may serve for<br>
19<br><br>
the drive of carrier yarn bobbins with a plurality of spinning stations.<br>
If required, there is the possibility of winding a plurality of pairs or groups of carrier yarns on one carrier yarn bobbin. As a result, the number of carrier yarn rolls can be reduced, or a plurality of spinning stations can be served simultaneously from one carrier yarn roll. However, in this embodiment, problems may arise in the event of the break of a carrier yarn. For winding the plurality of pairs or groups of carrier yarns, a correspondingly adapted winding device is provided which is equipped with a winding head making it possible to wind the required number of pairs or groups of carrier yarns onto a carrier yarn bobbin. If required, the winding head is configured such that the distances between the plurality of carrier yarns can be set in relation to one another.<br>

Figure 1, figure 2 and figure 3 show a drawframe 3 of a spinning station 2 of a ring spinning machine 1 according to the invention from the front (figure 1), in a side view (figure 2) and in a perspective Illustration (figure 3). A spiiuiing device 1 has, as a rule, a multiplicity of spinning stations 2 arranged next to one another, in each case with one or typically two spindles of the type described above (not illustrated in any more detail). The spinning stations 2 are equipped with a corresponding number of drawframes 3 which normally, in ring spinning, serve as the sole supply of the fibers to be processed. In the invention, however, the functioning of the drawframes 3 is changed completely, in that they are used primarily for generating effects and are no longer the primary fiber suppliers.<br>
21<br><br>
The drawframe 3 shown has a symmetrical set-up with first and second entry rollers 4, 5 which are arranged in pairs and which are driven by a first drive shaft 6. The second entry rollers 5 are arranged here on both sides on a boom 7 and, during the spinning operation, are pressed by this against the first entry rollers 4 by means of spring force. Moreover, the drawframe 3 has in each case a pair of first and second delivery rollers 8, 9, by means of which the fibers to be processed normally leave the drawframe before they are spun. The first pair of delivery rollers 8 is driven by means of a second drive shaft 10. The second pair of delivery rollers 9 is driven indirectly by the first delivery rollers 8 in that they are likewise pressed against the first delivery rollers 8 by means of the boom 7. If required, lifting-off devices, for example in the form of a wedge, eccentric or lever mechanism, are provided, by means of which the second delivery rollers 9 can be individually lifted off temporarily from the first delivery rollers 8, while the opposite roller continues to be operatively connected. Arranged between the entry rollers 4, 5 and the delivery rollers 8, 9 are first belts 13 driven by a third drive shaft 12 and second belts 14 driven passively via the first belts 13. The second belts 14 are likewise arranged on the boom 6 which, during spinning operation, presses then-, elastically against the first bel+:s 13. The first belts 13 are tensioned by first belt rollers 15 and a first belt guide 16 having here an essentially triangular cross section. The second belts 14 are deflected in their rear (trailing) region by means of passively driven second belt rollers 18 which are likewise arranged on the boom 7. They are tensioned in the front region by means of second belt guides 19 which are likewise arranged on the boom 7. The belt guides 16, 19 are configured such that they press the belts 13, 14 against one another during spinning operation. In the illustration shown, the components in each case occurring twice are arranged symmetrically to<br>
22<br><br>
the boom 7, but are partially concealed by this and can therefore be seen only individually.<br>
In the embodiments shown, above the drawframes 3, two roving rolls 20 are arranged laterally next to one another, from which roving 21 is unwound and supplied by means of deflections 22 to the drawframes 3 via the entry rollers 4, 5. The roving rolls 20 are usually mounted, vertically suspended, above the drawframes 3 on columns or creel columns (cf. figures 8 and 9) .<br>
Between the drawframes 3 and the roving rolls 20 can be seen a carrier yarn holder 30 which serves for receiving carrier yarn 32 wound on carrier yarn bobbins 31. The carrier yarn bobbins 31 are cheese-wound. This means that, per carrier yarn bobbin 31, two or more carrier yarns 32 are wound parallel to one another, so that fewer rolls are required. In the embodiment shown, the carrier yarn holder 30 comprises two carrier yarn cylinders (carrier yarn shafts) 33 which are driven in rotation about their longitudinal axis and which are arranged one behind the other parallel to the machine longitudinal direction (y-direction). These carrier yarn shafts 33 advantageously extend over a plurality of spinning stations and thus drive a plurality of carrier yarn bobbins 31 simultaneously. The carrier yam bobbins 31 are operatively connected to the carrier yarn shafts 33 at least during spinning operation. As a result of the rotation of the carrier yarn shafts 33, the carrier yarn bobbins 31 are driven at a constant circumferential speed, so that carrier yarn 32 is dispensed at a suitable speed and under controlled tension. The carrier yarn shafts 33 at the same time prevent an unwanted overfeed and serve for controlling the tension of the carrier yarns 32. If required, the drive of the carrier yarn shaft 33 is configured such that the relative conveying speed of the carrier yarn with respect to the spindle speed or to the (averaged) speed of the delivery rollers 8, 9<br>
23<br><br>
can be set within a certain tolerance range, for example +5% to -5%. In the embodiment shown, the carrier yarn shafts 33 serve as a deflection for the carrier yarns 32 which are unwound from the carrier yarn bobbins 31 and supplied to the spinning process, via the delivery rollers 8, 9 of the drawframe 3, upstream of a spinning triangle 50. If required, the carrier yarn shafts 33 have a traction-increasing surface, for example in the form of a grooving or coating, so that a uniform dispensing of the carrier yarns 32 is ensured.<br>
Located on both sides of the carrier yarn bobbins 31, as seen in the axial direction, are guide separators 34 which define the axial position of the carrier yarn bobbins 31 with respect to the carrier yarn shafts 33. The guide separators 34 have slot-shaped orifices 35 which are arranged essentially radially with respect to a carrier yarn shaft 33 at an angle a and are suitable for guiding a bearing shaft 36 of a carrier yarn bobbin 31. The carrier yarn shafts 33, as a rule, extend over a plurality of spinning stations and are suitable for driving a plurality of carrier yarn bobbins 31 simultaneously. The guide separators 34 have, in the region of the rear end of the slot-shaped orifices 35, a saddle 37 which is suitable for receiving the bearing shaft 35 of a carrier yarn bobbin 31, so that the carrier yarn bobbin 31 is no longer operatively connected to the carrier yarn shaft 33 (position of rest) .<br>
One of the carrier yarn bobbins 31 illustrated in figures 2 and 3 is in this position of rest (cf. figure 2 on the right), and the other is operatively connected to the carrier yarn shaft 33  (cf.  figure 2 on the<br>
left).<br>
As can be seen clearly in figures 2 and 3, the carrier yarns 32 are taken off from the carrier yarn bobbins 31<br>
24<br><br>
around the carrier yarn shafts 33. The embodiment shown has, for each side of the drawframe 3, a separate carrier yarn bobbin 31, in each case with two parallel-wound carrier yarns 32. Each carrier yarn bobbin 31 is assigned a driven carrier yarn cylinder 33 which supports the carrier yarn bobbin 31 along a surface line and meters the dispensing of the carrier yarn 32. In the embodiment shown, the carrier yarn shafts 33 are mounted essentially at the same height one behind the other (x-direction). The carrier yarn 32 of the carrier yarn bobbin 31 arranged at the rear, as seen in the x-direction, serves for feeding the right spinning station, and the carrier yarn 32 of the carrier yarn bobbin 31 arranged at the front serves for feeding the left spinning station (cf. figure 3) . The holding device 30 for the carrier yarn bobbins 31 is designed such that it can be retrofitted into an existing ring spinning machine at as little outlay as possible, without adversely influencing the functioning of the latter. A different arrangement and mounting of the carrier yarn bobbin 31 lead to a substantially more complicated set-up and therefore to an increase in the cost of the device.<br>
Depending on the embodiment and field of use, there is the possibility of providing a single carrier yarn shaft instead of two sepaiaLe carrier yarn shafts. The carrier yarn shafts 33 of the embodiment shown rotate contradirectionally to one another (figure 2, left side: counterclockwise; figure 2, right side: clockwise) . After the carrier yarns 32 have been taken off from the carrier yarn bobbins 31 around the carrier yarn shafts 33, they are supplied to a carrier yarn guide device 38. Depending on the field of use, the carrier yarn guide device 38 is a simple yarn guide or, as illustrated here, a yarn guide and monitoring device 38. If required, further thread guides are provided. The monitoring device 38 serves for ensuring that both carrier yarns 32 are always present during spinning<br>
25<br><br>
operation, in that it is designed such that, in the event of a break of one of the carrier yarns 32, the supply of the other carrier yarn 32 is also interrupted. The carrier yarn guide device 38 is configured such that the carrier yarns 32 are supplied to the spinning process in a fiber dispensing region 52 at a defined distance a from one another (cf. figure 4) . The carrier yarn guide device 38 may be designed such that the distance a can be set.<br>
Figure 4 shows the detail C from figure 3 in an enlarged illustration. What can be seen are the drawframes 3 with the entry rollers 4, 5, with the delivery rollers 8, 9 and with the belts 13, 14 arranged between them. In each case the upper, passively driven entry rollers 4 and delivery rollers 9 and belts 14 are fastened to the upwardly pivotable boom 7. In the embodiment shown, the yarn guide and monitoring device 38 is mounted by means of a holder 40 on a laterally deflectable traversing rail 41, by means of which the yarn guide device 38 and also a roving guide (ceramic guide) 24 arranged downstream of the drawframes 3 can be moved to and fro laterally (illustrated diagrammatically by the arrows F). An uneven wear of the delivery rollers 8, 9 is thereby counteracted. If required, the yarn guide devices 24, 38 can also be arranged fixedly. The traversing rail 41 is a holder which, as a rule, arranged downstream of the drawframes, runs parallel to the machine longitudinal direction. The functioning of the yarn guide and monitoring device 38 is explained in more detail in figure 5. A yarn 22 of the type according to the invention typically has at least two intertwisted carrier yarns 32, between which further fibers 21 from the drawframe 3 are interweaved. The further fibers 21 may be incorporated in the form of flames 2 3 (local thickenings) or continuously.<br>
26<br><br>
For the production of boucle yarns, the carrier yarns can be decoupled from the take-off rollers, in that the take-off rollers are equipped with tangentially continuous grooves (not illustrated in detail), in which the carrier yarns 32 are arranged. The continuous grooves reduce the local traction. In order to lower the friction and make relative movement easily possible, the inner faces of the grooves may be provided with a friction-reducing coating. Alternatively or additionally, separate rolls may be arranged in the grooves and can rotate independently of the take-off rollers. In this case, the carrier yarn guides 38 are arranged rigidly, not deflected laterally, or the take-off rollers 8, 9 are deflected together with the traversing rail.<br>
Figure 5 shows a mechanical carrier yarn guide and monitoring device 38 according to the invention in a front view (x-direction). The embodiment illustrated is set up such that the carrier yarns 21 can be threaded in quickly and simply from the front along a first and a second fiber guide region (fiber guide path) 51. Particularly in ring spinning machines with large numbers of spindles, this is particularly relevant for economical operation. The carrier yarn guide device 38 is set up such that the carrier yarns 32 are dispensed at a defined distance a from one another. The auide device may be set up such that the distance a is adjustable.<br>
Depending on the field of use of the device, active monitoring of the carrier yarns 32 by means of a thread monitoring system 38 is important, so that, in the event of a break of one of the carrier yarns 32, the remaining carrier yarn does not continue to be conveyed and does not lead to a fault in the spinning process. The thread monitoring system 38 checks whether all the carrier yarns 32 necessary for the spinning process are actually present. Should one of the carrier yarns 32 be<br>
27<br><br>
missing, this leads to a discontinuation of the spinning process, in that it prevents the supply of the remaining carrier yarns 32, likewise in a controlled manner, and returns them to the associated carrier yarn bobbin. A thread monitoring system, as a rule, contains a thread-sensor and thread-separation device which co-operates with the carrier yarns between the feed bobbin and the delivery roller of the carrier cylinder. The position is preferably synchronized with the fiber material flow such that the incorporation of the fiber material supplied to the spinning machine by means of the drawframe in order to form a flame is optimized. The mechanical embodiment of the thread sensor 38, as shown, operates with the pretension of the carrier yarns 32. The thread sensor 38 has a baseplate 44 and a rocker 43 pretensioned by means of a spring (not visible) and mounted rotatably about an axis 42. Since the rocker 43 can be deflected symmetrically equally to the left (figure 5b) and to the right (figure 5c), the presence of the carrier yarns 32 is checked in that the carrier yarns 32, as a result of their pretension, keep the rocker 43 in a middle position (figure 5a). If, then, as illustrated in figs 5b and 5c, one of the two carrier yarns 32 is missing, the pretension of the remaining carrier yarn is sufficient to ensure that the rocker 43 is deflected such that the remaining thread i=^ interrupted. Tn the embodiment shown here, the rocker 43 has cutting blades 44 which sever the carrier yarns 32. An interruption of the carrier yarns 32 ensures that no false yarn is spun. If required, the middle position of the rocker 43 may be ensured in a defined way by means of a suitable centering element until a certain deflection force is reached. In one embodiment, this is achieved by means of a magnet which, in the middle position, exerts on the rocker a certain force which is sufficiently high to ensure that the rocker is not deflected in an uncontrolled manner even under oscillations or vibrations. In this embodiment, the magnitude of the force may be set, for<br>
28<br><br>
example, by means of the distance between the magnet and rocker.<br>
Figure 6 shows a further embodiment of a ring spinning device 1 according to the invention obliquely from the front and from above. Figure 7 shows the detail D from figure 6. Reference is made for the general description to figures 1 to 4. In contrast to the embodiment according to figures 1 to 4, the variant shown in figures 6 and 7 has a simplified carrier yarn guide device 45 which consists of a guide element 46 with two carrier yarn guide ducts 47, 48 arranged next to one another. The guide element is formed here in one piece and has an essentially E-shaped cross section. If required, the carrier yarn guide device 46 is configured such that the distance between the carrier yarn guide ducts 47, 48 is adjustable. In the event of a break of one of the carrier yarns 32, the yarn supply is not interrupted. The result of this is that, as a rule, only robust carrier yarns which do not break can be processed. On the other hand, complicated manual checks are necessary. The carrier yarn guide device 46 is fastened via the holder 40 to the traversing rail 41 and by means of the latter is moved to and fro in the y-direction during operation so that the delivery cylinders 8, 9 are not subjected to uneven wear. The guide element 4 6 is arranged on a ba^e 4 9 which preferably consists of plastic. The base is configured such that it can be fastened to the holder 40 in a flexible and simple way, for example by being snapped on or clamped on. The carrier yarn guide device 46 preferably consists of an abrasion-resistant material, such as ceramic or hard metal. The device may be further simplified if the carrier yarn guide device 46 is not arranged on a traversing rail 41, but at a fixed location instead.<br>
Figure 8 shows an extract from a further embodiment of a ring spinning device 1 according to the invention<br>
29<br><br>
having a plurality of spinning stations 2 arranged next to one another. Figures 9, 10 and 11 show parts and extracts of the device according to figure 8. In figure 9, the carrier yarn holding device 30 and part of the drawframes 3 can be seen, including their drive shafts 6, 10, 12 and the holding bar 11 of the boom 7. Figures 10 and 11 show a carrier yarn bobbin 31 between two guide separators 34 above two carrier cylinders 31 in a perspective illustration (figure 10) and in a side view ( figure 11) .<br>
As may be gathered from figure 8, the spinning device 1 has a symmetrical set-up with respect to the yz-plane. The arrangement of the carrier yarn bobbins 31 containing the carrier yarns is placed below an existing roving creel 25 having roving rolls 20 and above the drawframes 3. This avoids detriment to a traveling blower (not illustrated) moving along the ring spinning machine 1 in the longitudinal direction (y-direction). A further advantage is that these components can thus be installed in existing spinning machines 1 in a simple way, without the latter having to be substantially modified.<br>
One or more carrier cylinders (feed cylinders) 33 driven positively at an adjustable ratio to the delivery rollers S, 9 of the dravjf ram.i^s 3 carry the carrier yarn bobbins 31 for the carrier yarns. The carrier cylinders 33 are preferably arranged in pairs one behind the other and parallel to the longitudinal direction (y-direction) of the spinning machine 1 (transversally to the spindles) . As can be seen, the carrier cylinders 33 extend essentially over the entire length of the spinning machine 1, thus making it possible to have a simple cost-effective set-up. In each case two carrier cylinders 33 arranged, spaced apart, one behind the other serve for the reception of carrier yarn bobbins 31 in that these lie on the carrier  cylinders  along  a  surface  line.   Guide<br>
30<br><br>
separators 34 arranged vertically (xz-plane) between the carrier yarn bobbins 31 position the laid-on carrier yarn bobbins 31 in the longitudinal direction (y-direction) and prevent these from touching one another. The guide separators have here, on both sides, essentially radially arranged guide slots 35 which are suitable for receiving a bearing shaft (axis) 36 of a carrier yarn bobbin 31. The guide slots 35 run obliquely upward here. The guide slots 35 have, in the rear region, a saddle 37 which serves for receiving the bearing shaft 36 of the carrier yarn bobbin 31 in a position of rest in which the carrier yarn bobbin 31 is no longer operatively connected to the carrier cylinder 33 . The carrier cylinders 33 are preferably driven contradirectionally laterally via a drive means (not illustrated in any more detail) and rotate essentially at a constant speed, so that a uniform supply of carrier yarn to the spinning stations 2 is ensured. In order to achieve an increase in traction, the carrier cylinders 33 have here a traction-increasing surface in the form of groovings . If required, the feed bobbins are cheese-wound. This affords the advantage that the number of carrier yarn bobbins required can be reduced. One advantage is that the arrangement of the carrier yarn bobbins 31, as shown, requires a very small amount of space, and therefore the device is suitable even for use on ring spinning machines inLended for cotton and having a very close division (distance between individual spinning stations) of around 70 to 75 mm. The set-up of the drawframes 3 corresponds essentially to that of figures 1 to 4 and is therefore not explained again.<br>
Each carrier yarn bobbin 31 is assigned a driven carrier yarn shaft 33 which supports the carrier yarn bobbin and which meters the dispensing of the carrier yarn (not illustrated here). The carrier yarns are taken off from the carrier yarn bobbins 31 around the carrier yarn shafts 33 and are supplied to a carrier<br>
31<br><br>
yarn guide device 38. The carrier yarn guide device 38 is here a yarn guide and monitoring device 38 which ensures that, during spinning operation, all the required carrier yarns are present, in that it is designed such that, in the event of a break of one of the carrier yarns, the supply of the other carrier yarn is also interrupted. In some applications, it may be used instead of a simple carrier yarn guide. In the embodiment shown, the yarn guide and monitoring device 38 is mounted by means of a holder 40 on a laterally deflectable traversing rail 41, by means of which the yarn guide device 38 and also a roving guide arranged downstream of the drawframes 3 can be moved to and fro laterally (y-direction) (other embodiments are possible, depending on the field of use), so that an uneven wear of the delivery rollers 8, 9 is avoided.<br>
As may be gathered particularly from figure 9, between two carrier cylinders 33 is arranged in each case a longitudinal member 29 (designed here as a profile rail), to which the guide separators 34 are fastened, for example by being plugged on. The carrier cylinders 33 consist here of segments 54 of an extruded aluminum profile which are operatively connected (plugged together) at their ends by means of connection elements 55. The connection elements 55 serve at the same time for the loLation-free mounting of the carrier cylinders 33 with respect to bearers (projecting arms) 56 and for transmitting the drive torque. The bearers 56 are arranged at regular intervals (only one can be seen here) according to the length of the segments 54 on the rotor spinning machine 1. In the embodiment shown, the connection elements 55 are produced as injection moldings which mesh positively, at least in regions, with the profile of the segments 54 for the transmission of the drive torque. The connection elements 55 serve at the same time as bearing means of the carrier cylinder 33. For this purpose, they have an outer bearing face  58,  which bearing  faces  lie in<br>
32<br><br>
bearing points 59, provided for these, of the bearers 56. The bearing points in the embodiment shown are orifices in the upper region of the bearers 56, in which orifices rolls (not visible) are arranged. If required, the drive of the carrier cylinders 33 may be integrated into the bearers 56.<br>
It may be gathered from figures 10 and 11 how the guide separators 34, formed here as an injection molding, are arranged on the longitudinal member 29 and are fastened at any desired location by means of a clamping connection 39. It can likewise be seen clearly how the bearing shaft 36 of the carrier yarn bobbin 31 is arranged in the guide slots 35 running essentially radially with respect to a carrier cylinder 33, so that the carrier yarn roll 31 lies with its surface area on the carrier cylinder 33. Between the guide separators can be seen lifting-off devices 57, by means of which the operative connection between a carrier yarn bobbin 31 and a carrier cylinder can be temporarily prevented in a simple way, without the carrier yarn roll 31 having to be raised in its position of rest in the saddle 37. The lifting-off devices 57 are configured here as half shells made from plastic having an essentially sickle-shaped cross section. The lifting-off devices 57 are snapped onto the carrier cylinders 33 and can be moved from a first into a second position around the carrier cylinders 33 by means of a shift lever 58. In the first position, the carrier yarn roll 31 is operatively connected to the carrier cylinder 33. In the second position, the region of the lifting-off device 57 having the sickle-shaped cross section is pushed, at least in regions, underneath the carrier yarn bobbin 31, so that the latter is no longer in engagement with the rotating carrier cylinder 33.<br>
Figures 12 and 13 show a further embodiment of a spinning device 1 obliquely from above (figure 12) and<br>
33<br><br>
obliquely from below (figure 13) . Figure 14 shows the detail E from figure 13. The spinning device 1 corresponds largely to the spinning devices 1 of the previous embodiments according to figures 1 to 11, and therefore reference is made to these for the general description. In contrast to the preceding embodiments, the embodiment shown here has a carrier yarn guide 60 which supplies the carrier yarns 32 at a defined distance a from one another, downstream of the delivery rollers 8, 9 of the drawframe 2 in the running direction, in the region of an exit point of the roving 22 from the drawframe 2, to the spinning triangle 50. If required, the carrier yarn guide 60 is configured such that the distance a is adjustable. The roving guide 60 is operatively connected here via a holder 61 to the traversing rail 41 and is periodically deflected laterally (y-direction) by means of the latter, in such a way that the rollers of the drawframe 2 are not worn on one side. Depending on the field of use, said roving guide may be arranged in a stationary manner. The carrier yarn guide 60 illustrated has an outer guide 62 and an inner guide 63. The outer guide 62 guides the carrier yarns 32 around the drawframe 2, and the inner guide 63 serves for actual supply to the spinning triangle 50. The inner guide 63 is designed here as a stirrup piece which is arranged so as to be adjustable m angle and orientation about an axis 64 via a setscrew 65. The inner guide 63 may also be a ceramic element or rollers, for example one or more rollers with or without continuous grooves. If required, the inner guide 63 is configured such that the distance between the carrier yarns is adjustable, for example in that the inner guide 63 has two separate guide means, the distance a between which can be set variably. The stirrup piece shown has the advantage that it can be threaded in very simply and quickly. Alternatively or additionally, guide means having an essentially E-shaped or other cross section may be used. The outer guide 62 is likewise arranged on the axis 64 .   At least<br>
34<br><br>
the inner guide 63 has essentially an E-shaped cross section which serves for guiding the carrier yarns. In the embodiment shown, the inner guide 63 is arranged so as to be tiltable about the axis 64. If required, in the region of the carrier yarn guide 60, an active thread monitoring device (for example, according to figure 4) is present, which interrupts the carrier yarn flow in a controlled manner in the event of a break of one of the carrier yarns 32. In the embodiment shown, if required, more than two carrier yarns 32 may be processed relatively simply per spinning station 2. For this purpose, the carrier yarn guide 60 sometimes has to be adapted.<br>
Figures 12 and 13 illustrate a drive 70 of the carrier yarn cylinders 33 of the carrier yarn holding device 30. Each of the carrier cylinders 54 is operatively connected to a belt pulley 71 which is driven contradirectionally here by a motor 73 via a belt 72. The carrier yarn holding device 30 can be converted in a very simple way for the reception of alternative disk bobbins (not illustrated in any more detail), in that the guide separators are removed and the belt 72 is laid around the belt pulleys 71 in such a way that these are driven co-directionally. The carrier threads or filaments can then be laid in the form of disk bobbins very simply with their surface area on the carrier yarn cylinders 33 and be driven by these.<br>
Figure 15 shows a further embodiment of a device 1 according to the invention. What can be seen are two drawframes 70 which are arranged, spaced laterally apart from one another, on a drawframe holding rail 69. Between the drawframes 70 are arranged two holders 71, essentially L-shaped here, on the front end of each of which a carrier yarn guide device 72, 73 is mounted laterally adjustably (y-direction). Normally, identical carrier yarn guide devices are used on both sides. In the example shown, however, two different embodiments<br>
35<br><br>
72, 73 are shown. The holders 71 are mounted at their rear end on a base 74 so as to be upwardly pivotable. Figure 16 shows the L-shaped holders 71 with the carrier yarn guide devices 72, 73 and also the base 74 in an enlarged illustration. The holder 71 in the right half of the figure is illustrated, for example, swung upward, so that there is a-clearer view of the elements lying underneath. The base 74 is, in turn, mounted on a clamp 75, by means of which it can be mounted on the traversing device or on another region of a rotor spinning machine (not illustrated in any more detail), depending on the embodiment. Here, in the rear region of the clamp 75, a support 67 in the form of a rotatable roll 68 is arranged, which assists in absorbing the torque in the case of heavy bearers or a one-sided load.<br>
What can also be seen is an approximately T-shaped web 76 which extends forward and, in the embodiment shown, has at its front end a laterally extending crossbar 77 which, in turn, serves for receiving two roving guide elements 78. The arms 77 engage, together with the roving guide elements 78, between the rollers of the drawframe 70 (cf. figure 15), where they orient the roving optimally with respect to the carrier yarn guide devices. If required, both the roving guide elements 78 and/or the carrier yarn guide devices 72, 73 arc configured so as to be adjustable in the transverse and/or longitudinal direction with respect to their holders 71. The roving guide elements have here an upwardly open V-shaped guide duct 79. Other configurations are possible.<br>
Figure 17 shows a carrier yarn guide device 73 in an enlarged illustration. The carrier yarn guide device 73 has a base 80, approximately C-shaped here, on which a spiral eye 81 is mounted so as to project in the upper region. Below the eye 81 is arranged a multiply bent guide bar 82 which, during spinning operation, engages<br>
36<br><br>
between two carrier yarns and spaces these apart laterally with respect to one another. The lateral distance can be set by means of the thickness of the guide bar 82. In one embodiment, the guide bar 82 is designed to be straight and is suitable for the reception of tubes (not illustrated) of different outside diameter. The tubes are advantageously manufactured from an abrasion-resistant material. The carrier yarns are guided through the eye 81 and then led past on each side of the tube, so that the diameter of the tube determines the relative distance of the carrier yarns from one another. The carrier yarn guide device 73 is preferably produced from metal or plastic. Depending on the number and arrangement of the carrier yarns, more than one guide bar 82 may be provided. The embodiment shown can be produced cost-effectively from metal wire (guide bar and eye) and sheet metal.<br>
Figure 18 shows the carrier yarn guide device 72 in an enlarged illustration. The carrier yarn guide device 72 has a base 83, by means of which it can be fastened to a holder 71 (cf. figure 15) . A laterally slotted eye 84 is suitable for the reception of carrier yarns (not illustrated) . Below the eye 84 is arranged an oval guide bar 8 6 which is rotatable about an axis 85 and which is suitable for variably setting the lateral distance between two carrier yarns running through Lhe eye 84. A latching mechanism 87 in which a pin 88 engages prevents an inadvertent adjustment of the distance between the carrier yarns. The distance can be adjusted by the element having the oval guide bar being drawn rearward out of the holder until the pin 88 is no longer in engagement with the latching mechanism 87. By rotation about the axis 85, the new distance a between the carrier yarns is set.<br>
In one embodiment, the various components of a device according to the invention have a modular form with standardized interfaces with one another, so that they<br>
37<br><br>
can  be  assembled  variably  and  can  be  adapted  to different rotor spinning devices.<br><br><br>
