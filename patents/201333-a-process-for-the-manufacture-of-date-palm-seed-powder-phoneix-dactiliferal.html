The present invention relates to the method of preparation of a dry powder from the seeds of Date Palm (Phoenix dactilifera L) in such a manner that the high content of Vitamins, Minerals, Carbohydrates, Fats, Proteins are not destroyed.<br>
Traditional knowledge: The date palm, its botany<br>
Date Palm trees are tall evergreen, unbranched palms;which can grow to a height of 30 m. The trunk is surrounded from the ground upward in spiral pattern with the base of earlier formed leaves Leaves are large (4-5 m) alternate, sheathing, in dense terminal rosettes, pinnately lobed. The end of the leaf fronds are needle sharp. Dioecious: female and male individuals. Flowers are borne in bunches at the top of the tree. Only the female trees produce fruit, but one male tree can produce enough pollen to pollinate 40-50 female trees. The fruit of the date is a drupe and has one seed, which can vary in size, shape, color and quality of flesh. Unripe dates are green in colour, maturing to yellow, then reddish-brown when fully ripe. A single large bunch may contain more than a thousand dates,. Each tree produces between five and ten bunches. Date palms begin to bear fruit at 3 to 5 years, and are fully mature at 12 years. Can be propagated by seed (but the chances are 50/50 of getting a male tree); generally, however (i.e. in commercial planting), propagated by suckers (offshoots) taken from the base of the mature female. These will always be a genetic copy of the parent tree.<br>
The date palm, its distribution and ecology<br>
These trees require high temperatures and low air humidity for fruit setting and ripening and also requires water supply (irrigation, high water table) They are grown in a nearly rainless belt<br><br>
Prior Art:<br>
Virtually every part of the tree has its uses. The wood and leaves provide timber and fabric for houses and fences. The leaves are used for making ropes, cord, baskets, crates and furniture. Bases of the leaves and the fruit stalks are used as fuel. The fruit yields food products such as date vinegar, date chutney or sweet pickle, date paste for bakery products and additional flavoring for oranges, bananas and almonds. Even the tree's terminal buds (heart of palm) make tasty additions to vegetable salads. The date palm is often the only available staple food for the inhabitants of desert and arid lands, and as such it is vital to millions throughout the world. Dry or bread dates: self-curing on tree. Soft dates: require harvest at appropriate time and sun-drying to increase sugar content and prevent spoilage. The latter are packaged traditionally in palm leaves and widely traded (caravans, ships). The date palm is also highly prized as an ornamental tree, as it is ideally situated in streets, avenues and driveways. The date palm can tolerate a high level of salinity.<br>
In India they are grown in Rajasthan. The seeds which are byproduct when the pulp is extracted for commercial use are not utilized for anything. In some parts of the United States and South Africa they are used for poultry, chicken and fish feed. As the seeds are not used in general for germination the seeds generally are treated as waste.<br>
The principle aim of this invention is to utilise the wasted Date Palm seeds as the powdered Date Palm seeds were tested and found to be rich in Vitamins, Minerals, Carbohydrates.<br>
Date Palm Seed Powder was taken for the major categorical analysis. The Minerals (Inorganaic) were assayed by the AAS (Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry) method and the findings are given below. The Vitamins were analysed by Fluorimetry, Microbiology, Titrimetry and UV<br><br>
Spectrophotometry methods. The Protein and Tannin content were determined using Folin Rowley's UV Spectrophotometry method.<br>
Carbohydrates were determined by Anthrone Reagent in a UV Spectrophometer.<br>
Nutrient Details of Date Palm Seed Powder:<br><br>
The seeds of Date Palm are hard and cannot be used as such by mankind and this invention relates to a process for converting the said hard seeds into a powder in such a manner that the basic inherent nutritional properties of the seeds are not lost and the said powder can be utilised with maximum benefit to the ultimate user.<br><br>
A Brief descriptions of the Drawing:<br>
A more complete appreciation of the present invention and many of its advantages will be readily obtained as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing and detailed specification, all of which forms a part of this disclosure:<br>
In the accompanying Flow Chart:<br>
Drying Chamber "A" is where the procured seeds are dried at temperatures betweeen 50 ° C and 57.5°C. The said drying Chamebr is heated by means of hot air.<br>
Feeder "B" is the point wherein dried the Date Palm Seeds are fed.<br>
Conveyor Belt "C°: takes the dried Date Palm Seeds to the Mechanical Pulveriser "D" wherein the dried Date Palm Seeds are crushed.<br>
Screener "E" in a temperature regulated chamber filters the crushed Date Palm Seeds of the required particle size on to a detachable container "F". The temperature is maintained at about J4*0°C in this chamber.<br>
Conveyor Belt "G" carries the unfiltered Date Palm Seeds back to the Mechanical Pulveriser UD" and this process continues till there is no residue left.<br>
Once the detachable container MF" is filled the contents of the said contianer is then transferred into a Cooling Trough "H" which is an open trough attached with rotary handles "I" which when rotated moves the powder in a circular manner which enhances rapid cooling.<br>
Storage containers "J" are made of such material which allows aeration of the said powder.<br><br>
Referring to the drawings, the seeds of Date Palm (Phoenix dactilifera L) are first dried in a drying chamber "A" by means of hot air which is ciruclated in that chamber. The said dried seeds are then fed into a feeder "B" which in turn feeds the dried Date Palm Seeds onto a conveyor belt<br>
Ond by not** CJDo/ad<br>
"C" which takes the driedADate Palm Seeds to a mechanical pulveriser "D". The Mechanical Pulveriser "D" crushes the dried Date Palm Seeds. Screener "E" in a temperature regulated chamber filters the crushed Date Palm Seeds of the required particle size (2,000.micron to 2,500 micron) on to a detachable container "F". The seeds which have not been crushed to the required particle size are then carried by the Conveyor Belt "G" back to the Mechanical Pulveriser "D", which in turn carries out the same process till there is no residue left. Once the detachable container UF" is filled, the filtered powder is then transferred to the cooling trough "H" which is open at the top and to which are attached rotatory paddles T which when rotated moves the powder in a circular (vertical) manner which enhances rapid cooling. The cooled powder is then packed in containers "J" which allow aeration.<br>
While in accordance with the Patent Statutes, the best mode and preferred embodiment has been set forth, the scope of the invention is not limited thereto, but rather by the scope of the attached claims.<br><br><br><br>
