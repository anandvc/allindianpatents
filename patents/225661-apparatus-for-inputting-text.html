				<td>"apparatus for inputting text"<br>
field of invention<br>
This invention relates to apparatus for inputting text, and pertains to the design of touch-<br>
typable devices, and the use of touch-typable devices in computing and telecommunications,<br>
and more particularly to touch-typable devices based on strongly touch-typable ambiguous codes<br>
and substantially optimal ambiguous codes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Since the invention of the typewriter more than 100<br>
years ago, keyboard engineering has been an active field<br>
of research and development/ resulting in many competing<br>
designs. With the growth of personal computing and<br>
telecommunications, the number of keyboard designs has<br>
multiplied as designers attempt to accommodate the wide<br>
variety of constraints and to exploit opportunities these<br>
new technologies present. Nonetheless, much of the<br>
variability of prior-art keyboard designs is not due to<br>
this variety of constraints and opportunities. Rather, it<br>
results from an incomplete appreciation on the part of<br>
keyboard designers of the constraints inherent in the<br>
problems they are trying to solve. It also reflects the<br>
lack of general, effective methods for optimizing with<br>
respect to these constraints. The present state of the<br>
art is thus represented by a plethora of partial<br>
solutions. These ills are cured by the keyboard design<br>
methods taught by the present invention. To illustrate<br>
the many facets of this invention, the optimizing methods<br>
are applied to the design of a variety of device<br>
embodiments, each preferred as the substantially optimal<br>
solution of a given set of design constraints.<br>
The instant invention relates to touch-typable<br>
devices. Touch typing, like playing a musical<br>
instrument, is a manual skill which is difficult to<br>
learn. Once learned, it is difficult to modify the<br>
acquired motor patterns. This difficulty places strong<br>
constraints on keyboard design. The familiar Qwerty<br>
keyboard (and its close variants such as the Azerty<br>
keyboard used in France) owes its dominance to ingraining<br>
and overlearning of the motor patterns involved in touch<br>
typing. Thus, the wide established base of the Qwerty<br>
keyboard has created a barrier to entry to improved<br>
keyboards, such as the Dvorak keyboard. Indeed such<br>
keyboards have gathered but a limited user community.<br>
Due to its large number of keys, the Qwerty keyboard<br>
is unsuitable for handheld and smaller typable devices.<br>
The advent of such devices opens a niche for keyboard<br>
designers. A new design in this niche which becomes<br>
dominant will likely conserve its dominant position even<br>
if more optimal designs appear later, due to the<br>
intrinsic tendency of repetitive motor patterns to become<br>
fixed. This prospect imposes an enormous burden of<br>
responsibility on keyboard designers to avoid saddling<br>
future generations of keyboard users with suboptimal<br>
designs.<br>
There are two main approaches in the prior art<br>
toward reducing the number of input means required to<br>
encode a given set of symbols 1) chording methods, in<br>
which a combination of input means are activated to<br>
encode each symbol, and 2) ambiguous codes, in which a<br>
combination of symbols are encoded by each input means.<br>
Chording methods have not met with practical success<br>
since they have been heretofore difficult to learn to<br>
operate, and few are willing to make the time investment<br>
required. Thus, only ambiguous codes, or ambiguous codes<br>
in combination with chording methods, hold any real<br>
promise as a solution to this problem.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Definitions and Basic Notions<br>
This section collects definitions of words and<br>
concepts which will be used in the following detailed<br>
specification.<br>
Language Given a set of symbols, one can construct<br>
sequences of symbols, and assign probabilities to the<br>
sequences. The set of symbols, sequences of symbols, and<br>
the probabilities assigned to the sequences will be<br>
referred to here as a language. For clarity of<br>
discussion, and without limiting the scope of this<br>
invention, the languages we will refer to are written<br>
natural languages, such as English, and though for<br>
concreteness we may refer to symbols as "letters" or<br>
"punctuation", it will be understood by those of ordinary<br>
skill in the art that symbols in this discussion may be<br>
any discrete unit of writing, including standard symbols<br>
such as Chinese ideograms or invented symbols such as the<br>
name of the artist formerly known as Prince.<br>
Keyboard/Input Means A keyboard is a component of a<br>
communications and/or computing device which transforms<br>
physical movement by an operator into symbol sequences.<br>
Keyboards comprise at least one input means which<br>
is responsible for the transformation of some subset of<br>
the physical motions operative to activate the keyboard<br>
into some subset of symbol sequences.<br>
The physical movement used to operate a keyboard<br>
is typically in the form of motion of fingers and/or<br>
thumb or of a hand-held stylus. This definition extends<br>
to other bodily motions, such as head, tongue, or eye<br>
motions which might serve to signal a choice of symbol<br>
from the keyboard. A device comprising a keyboard<br>
according to this definition will be referred to as a<br>
typable device.<br>
By "typable device" we understand not just the<br>
physical device containing the keyboard, but the entire<br>
communication system in which this typable device is<br>
embedded, the limits of that system defined by dependence<br>
on the underlying ambiguous coding scheme. In the case<br>
of a typable device in which input symbols appear<br>
directly on a display which is physically part of the<br>
typable device, the limits of the system are clear and<br>
defined by the physical perimeters of the device. In<br>
more general cases, in which for example the typable<br>
device includes a telephone handset sending information<br>
to a central computer, the central computer begin<br>
responsible for decoding or otherwise acting on the<br>
textual information communicated from the handset, then<br>
the "typable device" must be understood to include the<br>
central computer, as configured to operate in the<br>
required manner by software built in view of the<br>
teachings of this invention.<br>
It will be appreciated that each of the at least one<br>
input means comprised in a keyboard can take a wide<br>
variety of physical manifestations. The essential<br>
feature of an input means is that it permits an operator<br>
to select a subset from the set of symbols to be encoded<br>
by the keyboard. With this appreciation, and in order to<br>
increase the readability of this present specification,<br>
the word "key" will often be used interchangeably with<br>
the words "input means".<br>
Typing is the process of sequentially selecting at least<br>
one input means in order to select sequences of subsets<br>
of symbols from the set of symbols which can be encoded<br>
by the keyboard. It is to be appreciated that well-known<br>
handwriting recognition software permits a kind of typing<br>
in which the input means translates a collection of<br>
drawing motions into the selection of a subset of a set<br>
of symbols.<br>
Touch typing is the process by which the symbol<br>
sequences are generated from the keyboard using only or<br>
predominately kinesthetic rather than visual or auditory<br>
feedback.<br>
Strongly correlated symbols and symbol sequences It is<br>
well known that different letters appear in words with<br>
different frequencies. For instance, in the previous<br>
sentence, the letter "e" appeared 11 times, while the<br>
letter "z" did not appear at all. This is also true of<br>
pairs of letters, triples of letters, and so on. It is a<br>
related fact that words do not all occur with the same<br>
frequency. The 3-letter word "the" is very common in<br>
English, while the 3-letter word "zap" is rather<br>
uncommon. These statistical irregularities can be used<br>
in the design of ambiguous codes. Indeed, statistical -<br>
irregularities have been exploited in keyboard design at<br>
least since the invention of Qwerty.<br>
We are particularly concerned with symbols and<br>
symbol sequences whose distribution in typical samples of<br>
text is substantially strongly correlated with the<br>
distribution of other symbols or symbol sequences, such<br>
symbols will be called strongly correlated symbols. For<br>
example, the symbol "." often used in English and other<br>
languages to indicate the end of a sentence may be a<br>
strongly correlated symbol since the distribution of<br>
sentence length is not random in typical text. In Hebrew,<br>
the symbol "." is correlated as well with particular<br>
letter symbols since Hebrew uses a different symbol for<br>
some letters occurring at the end of a word, and ends of<br>
sentences are correlated with ends of words.<br>
Reference Statistics The reference statistics on<br>
symbols sequences used to measure the correlation between<br>
symbols are typically estimated by analysis of a<br>
reference corpus. A reference corpus is a large<br>
collection of text chosen to represent some aspect of<br>
language. As is well known to linguists, there are<br>
significant, fundamental problems in constructing corpora<br>
to represent general features of a language, as opposed<br>
to features pertaining to particular classes of text or<br>
particular types of writers. These problems are beyond<br>
the scope of the present invention. Here we refer<br>
throughout to a set of reference statistics gleaned from<br>
analysis of the British National Corpus, one of the<br>
largest corpora existing at the present time for analysis<br>
of English. Choosing a corpus is a necessary step toward<br>
gathering results which permit various methods and<br>
embodiments to be compared. Nothing in this particular<br>
choice should be construed as limiting the scope of this<br>
invention. In particular, the choice of a corpus of<br>
English language texts is an arbitrary choice. The same<br>
analysis could be performed for any other written natural<br>
language.<br>
Encodings and Decodings In the United States, the keys<br>
on a telephone keypad are often labelled with letters as<br>
well as numbers, typically with the key corresponding to<br>
the number 2 also corresponding to the letters a, b, and<br>
c, the key corresponding to the number 3 also<br>
corresponding to the letters d, e, and f, and so on in<br>
the standard ordering of letters in English.<br>
Thus, the sequence of key presses associated to the<br>
digit sequence 233 also corresponds to the letter<br>
sequences add, bee, and bed, all of which are English<br>
words, as well as various meaningless letter sequences<br>
such as cff. Here, a sequence is considered to have<br>
meaning if it appears in a reference list of meaningful<br>
sequences. Thus all of these letter sequences,<br>
meaningful or not, are associated with the same digit<br>
sequence. We will say that the sequence of key presses<br>
233 is an encoding and the sequences add, bee bed, eff<br>
and so on are decodings of the encoding 233. When no<br>
confusion will arise, "decodings" may be used to mean<br>
"meaningful decodings". The set of symbols used in<br>
decodings, in this example, letters in the alphabet, will<br>
be referred to as decoding symbols, or simply symbols if<br>
no confusion will arise, and the set of symbols used in<br>
encodings, in this example, digits, will be referred to<br>
as encoding symbols.<br>
Ambiguous codes Ambiguous codes as such are well known<br>
in the art. On the standard telephone keypad used in the<br>
United States, there are 12 keys, 10 of which encode a<br>
digit, and several of these, typically 8, encode in<br>
addition 3 or 4 letters of the alphabet, arranged in<br>
alphabetic order. These assignments produce an ambiguous<br>
code which we will call the standard ambiguous code.<br>
This code is abc def ghi jkl xnno pqrs tuv wxyz.<br>
Since several letters are encoded on each key, some<br>
method of disambiguation must be used to decide which of<br>
the several letters is intended by the operator. In<br>
typical applications, such as a voice response system,<br>
the intended letter is found by comparing the input<br>
sequence with a list of stored responses. In the event<br>
that several of the stored responses correspond to the<br>
input sequence, the user is presented with a list of<br>
these responses, from which he or she must choose. The<br>
order in which these choices are presented may be<br>
arbitrary, or may depend on the frequency by which each<br>
response is the correct response, with the responses<br>
presented in decreasing order of frequency.<br>
Standard keyboards. There are essentially three standard<br>
keyboards in wide use: the Qwerty keyboard and its close<br>
variants, the 12-key telephone keypad and the typically<br>
17-key numeric keypad and its close variants. It is a<br>
unique advantage of this invention to provide keying<br>
methods useful both on the standard telephone and numeric<br>
keypads, as well as on a specially designed keypads<br>
disclosed herein.<br>
Strong touch typability A weakly touch-typable device<br>
is a device in which the assignment of symbols to keys is<br>
essentially fixed; only relative to such a device can a<br>
typist develop physical reflexes for encoding particular<br>
symbols using particular motor patterns. We will say<br>
that a typable device is strongly touch typable if it is<br>
1) weakly touch typable, 2) based on an ambiguous code,<br>
and yet 3) such that in a normal mode of operation, a<br>
touch typist can use the typable device to produce text<br>
at an acceptable level of accuracy without being unduly<br>
distracted from the touch typing task to intervene in the<br>
disambiguation process.<br>
Strong touch typability is a matter of degree; it is<br>
a measure of touch typability which depends on a host of<br>
factors, some pertaining to the individual typists, some<br>
pertaining to the uses to which the typable device will<br>
be typically put, and some pertaining to the structure of<br>
the typable device itself. For a given touch typists,<br>
for instance, a given typable device may be sufficiently<br>
strongly touch typable for some typing tasks, but not for<br>
others.<br>
It is to be appreciated that two of the key elements<br>
of the definition of strong touch typability, accuracy of<br>
the text produced and the distraction of the touch-typing<br>
user, depend on a number of factors, including:<br>
• the disambiguation means,<br>
• the context of the use of the machine, for<br>
instance while driving or while sitting at a -<br>
desk,<br>
• the kind of text to be typed, which determines<br>
in part the level of accuracy required,<br>
• the reference statistics,<br>
• the skill of the individual typist,<br>
• individual preferences, and<br>
• the means by which the attention of the user is<br>
drawn to the disambiguation mechanism (for<br>
instance, a voice-synthesis mechanism which<br>
speaks the words or words in a query to the<br>
user may or may not be more distracting than a<br>
bell or a flashing light).<br>
Though strong touch typability, like temperature, is<br>
a matter of a degree, it is, like temperature, perfectly<br>
well-defined. The strong touch typability of a typable<br>
device can be quantitatively measured, with respect to<br>
any user or group of users, once these various factors<br>
are fixed, using standard experimental protocols, well-<br>
known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, two<br>
components of strong touch typability can be measured<br>
directly from an ambiguous code: lookup error and query<br>
error. Thus, numerical values of strong touch typability<br>
can be assigned without any direct reference to a<br>
population of users, but only with reference to the<br>
ambiguous code in question.<br>
Like temperature, there is a lower bound to strong<br>
touch-typability. It is clear that a device which<br>
requires user intervention after every word or even after<br>
every three words in order to disambiguate cannot be<br>
considered strongly touch-typable with respect to any<br>
touch typist engaged in any task. The lower bound of<br>
strong touch typability can be expressed in terms of<br>
continuity of attention. If a user's attention must be<br>
substantially continually focused on the operation of the<br>
disambiguation mechanism to produce text which is »<br>
disambiguous to an acceptable level, then the device is<br>
not strongly touch typable.<br>
The practical lower bound of strong touch typability<br>
pertains to a user of average skill in the art of touch<br>
typing, and is higher than the theoretical lower bound<br>
just described. In order to bring numerical as well as<br>
conceptual precision and definiteness to the inventive<br>
notion of strong touch typability, numerical values are<br>
assigned to strong touch typability in terms of values<br>
of lookup error and query error. This numerical<br>
characterization serves to further distinctly point out<br>
the differences between the inventive methods and devices<br>
of the present disclosure and all prior art methods and<br>
devices.<br>
A strongly touch typable ambiguous code is an<br>
ambiguous code on which strongly touch typable devices<br>
may be based.<br>
Feedback Devices In devices which permit the user to<br>
intervene at various points in the decoding of symbol<br>
sequences generated using ambiguous codes, some manner of<br>
sensory feedback to the user is required. Typically, this<br>
feedback will be in the form of a graphical<br>
representation of symbols, however, feedback could take<br>
many forms, such as auditory, tactile, or even olfactory.<br>
Ergonomic Factors Design of keyboards implementing<br>
ambiguous codes involves satisfying many constraints.<br>
These may include reduction of lookup error rate,<br>
reduction of query rate, selection of a number of keys<br>
consistent with the size of the desired keyboard,<br>
compatibility with existing keyboards such as the Qwerty<br>
keyboard, phone keypad, or numeric keypad, regularity of<br>
partition structure, anatomic fidelity, minimal mode-<br>
changing key use, partition structure, compatibility<br>
between one- and two-handed typing, and conservation of<br>
conventions such as alphabetic ordering. Other<br>
constraints include: the ergonomics of disambiguation<br>
mechanisms, the ergonomics of the encoding of weakly<br>
correlated symbols, look-and-feel, and availability of<br>
computing resources at the sending and receiving ends of<br>
a communication system utilizing ambiguous codes.<br>
Lookup Error measures the error committed by a<br>
disambiguation mechanism which disambiguates by<br>
systematically selecting the most-probable (meaningful)<br>
decoding from the set of possible decodings of an<br>
ambiguous sequence. Thus, the lookup error rate of a code<br>
is the sum, over all possible decodings which are not the<br>
most probable decoding of an ambiguous sequence, of the<br>
reference probability of the possible decodings. In the<br>
case of word-based disambiguation, these sequences begin<br>
and end with a "space" symbol, that is, are words. Lookup<br>
error is the probability that the tnost-likely decoding is<br>
not the correct one. The lookup error is conveniently<br>
expressed as a rate, the lookup error rate, in units of<br>
words per lookup error. The lookup error rate is the<br>
reciprocal of the lookup error probability.<br>
Query probability is the sum, over all (meaningful)<br>
decodings which are not unique (meaningful) decodings, of<br>
the reference probability of said decodings. This gives<br>
the probability that a given word will have more than<br>
one meaningful decoding, and therefore a query must be<br>
made of the user as to decide which of these decodings to<br>
use. The reciprocal of the query probability is the<br>
query rate, expressed in units of words per query. The<br>
query rate gives the average number of words entered<br>
between queries.<br>
Substantial Optimality A code will be said to be<br>
substantially optimal with respect to a property if it is<br>
among the best codes with respect to that property given<br>
other constraints imposed on the code. For example, a<br>
code on 20 keys may have a lower value of the lookup<br>
error rate than a code on 2 keys, and yet the code on 2<br>
keys may be substantially optimal with respect to the<br>
lookup error rate given the constraint that the code be<br>
on 2 keys. Substantially optimal ergonomic codes will be<br>
defined as codes which are simultaneously substantially<br>
optimal with respect to each of a collection of ergonomic<br>
constraints. Such constraints include but are not limited<br>
to key number, lookup error rate and query rate. For<br>
these three constraints, pairs of constraints are<br>
correlated. Lookup error rates tends to increase with<br>
query rate, and both lookup error and query rates tend to<br>
increase as key number decreases. The best value<br>
possible for a given criterion when this given criterion<br>
is the sole optimization criterion may be better than the<br>
best possible value obtainable when some other criterion<br>
must be optimized as well. Thus, the ergonomic<br>
constraints relevant to a given design must be decided<br>
upon and their importance weighted as an initial step of<br>
the optimization methods taught by this invention.<br>
It is to be emphasized that the optimality of an<br>
ambiguous code cannot be discussed in the absolute, but<br>
must be evaluated relative to a set of reference<br>
statistics for the language to be encoded. Indeed, given<br>
any ambiguous code, it is possible to construct a set of<br>
statistics such that code is optimal with respect to the<br>
constructed statistics.<br>
Given a set of reference statistics, an estimate of<br>
the optimality of a given code can be obtained from<br>
experiments comprising the generation of random codes, as<br>
well be discussed in more detail below.<br>
Disambiguation Methods Substantial optimality for<br>
ambiguous codes is well defined only in reference to a<br>
chosen disambiguation method. A code which is<br>
substantially optimal with respect to one disambiguation<br>
method may not be substantially optimal with respect to<br>
another method of disambiguation.<br>
At least two disambiguation methods are well known<br>
in the art. These are word-based and block-based<br>
disambiguation. In word-based disambiguation, a list of<br>
words along with their probabilities is used to choose<br>
among alternate decodings of a given encoding in the<br>
ambiguous code. For instance, all words in the list which<br>
are meaningful decodings of a given encoding may be<br>
compared, and the word with the largest probability<br>
selected. Block-based disambiguation is similar, except<br>
that the list contains fragments of text up to some size,<br>
along with the probability of the fragments.<br>
Both word-based and block-based disambiguation<br>
methods are special cases of a more general framework,<br>
which we will call sequence-based disambiguation, in<br>
which a list of sequences is associated with a<br>
probability, and disambiguation is effected by reference<br>
to this list. It is to be noted that the "space" symbol<br>
which defines word boundaries in languages such as<br>
English is for the purposes of this discussion no<br>
different from any other symbol. One can define a list of<br>
sequences and sequence probabilities in which said<br>
sequences include the "space" symbol, and thus extend<br>
beyond word boundaries. One can go further and define<br>
sequences which include a wildcard symbol and thus define<br>
lists of sequences which contain arbitrary subsequences,<br>
which subsequences may or may not correspond to words in<br>
the language. In this way, arbitrarily complex<br>
representations of a language can be built up, and can<br>
be used in a disambiguation method. For instance,<br>
syntactic and semantic relationships between subsequences<br>
can be brought in to resolve conflicts between possible<br>
interpretations of an ambiguously coded sequence. For<br>
clarity, we focus this specification on well-known word-<br>
based disambiguation, unless otherwise specified. It<br>
will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the<br>
methods taught by this invention do not depend on word-<br>
based disambiguation; any other disambiguation method can<br>
be used.<br>
Partitions A partition of an integer n is a set of<br>
integers such that the sum of the elements of the set is<br>
equal to n. Typically, a given integer admits many<br>
partitions, e.g. the integer 5 has the partition 3:2, but<br>
also the partition 2:2:1. Algorithms for generating all<br>
the partitions of an integer are well known to those<br>
skilled in the art. Most prior art codes use an even-as-<br>
possible partition. That is, a partition in which, to<br>
the extent possible given the number of keys in relation<br>
to the number of letters to be encoded, the number of<br>
letters per key is the same. As will be further expanded<br>
below, this choice is a sensible choice with respect to<br>
some ergonomic considerations, it may be sub-optimal with<br>
respect to others.<br>
There are two genera of ambiguous codes for which<br>
exclusive rights are herein claimed. These are l)<br>
strongly touch-typable ambiguous codes, and 2)<br>
substantially optimal ambiguous codes. Ambiguous codes<br>
may be substantially optimal but not strongly touch<br>
typable, strongly touch typable but not substantially<br>
optimal, neither substantially optimal nor strongly touch<br>
typable, or both substantially optimal and strongly touch<br>
typable.<br>
The disclosure begins by pointing out how to make<br>
ambiguous codes in both of these genera, and identifying<br>
whether a code is contained in either of the genera. It<br>
then explains how to use codes in both of these genera to<br>
make typable devices, and how these codes may be used to<br>
solve various design problems confronting the designer of<br>
typable devices.<br>
The best mode for practicing this invention depends<br>
on the constellation of design criteria which are to be<br>
optimized according to the teachings of the invention.<br>
Thus, several particular, practically relevant and<br>
useful, situations are chosen to illustrate the range of<br>
the methods and devices taught by the present invention.<br>
The range of machines which can be built by persons<br>
skilled in the art according to the teachings of this<br>
invention extends considerably beyond the specifics of<br>
the preferred embodiments presented herein. Various<br>
extreme or particular cases of design constraints are<br>
solved in these embodiments. Given the teachings embodied<br>
in these cases, it will be clear to one skilled in the<br>
art how to combine features appropriately in order to<br>
solve intermediate or hybrid design problems.<br>
One embodiment is optimized with respect to lookup<br>
error rate exclusively. This embodiment is designed for a<br>
machine with limited memory and computing power, such as<br>
a smart card. With such a machine, computing resources<br>
may not be available to support a complex querying<br>
mechanism for user intervention in the disambiguation<br>
process. Thus this machine uses one of the simplest<br>
possible disambiguation mechanisms, which comprises<br>
systematic selection of the most-probable decoding of any<br>
given encoding.<br>
Another embodiment is optimized with respect to<br>
query rate exclusively. This embodiment is designed for<br>
use by the driver of a vehicle, such as an automobile.<br>
Though computing power may be available to support a<br>
complex querying mechanism, use of such mechanism should<br>
be kept to a minimum, so as to distract the driver as<br>
little as possible from driving.<br>
A next embodiment provides a phone keypad optimized<br>
with respect to both lookup error rate and query rate,<br>
and which is compatible with the layout of standard<br>
telephone keypads.<br>
Another embodiment is optimized with respect a<br>
conventional criterion: preservation of alphabetic order.<br>
Letters are arranged on the standard touch-tone keypad in<br>
alphabet order. It is possible to preserve the<br>
alphabetic ordering of the conventional telephone keypad<br>
and yet reduce lookup and query rates by optimizing over<br>
partitions.<br>
Optimization over partitions leads to an additional<br>
embodiment in which keyboards with substantially optimal<br>
query and lookup error are exhibited which preserve as<br>
well as possible the traditional Qwerty keyboard<br>
arrangement.<br>
A further embodiment illustrating the design of<br>
keyboards which correspond as well as possible to<br>
conventional designs is a keyboard based on an ambiguous<br>
code and corresponding to a numeric keypad.<br>
For many applications, a keyboard which can be<br>
ergonomically operated in both an ambiguous and a non-<br>
ambiguous fashion is desired. To this end, it is<br>
preferable to chose ambiguous codes on a number of keys<br>
which divides the number of symbols to be encoded. A<br>
number of keys equal to M the number of symbols is<br>
particularly preferred. The desirable consequences of<br>
this preferred choice are exhibited by this next<br>
embodiment.<br>
Another embodiment shows how keyboards can be<br>
optimized for cross-platform compatibility. In this<br>
embodiment two keyboards, a one-handed keyboard and a<br>
two-handed keyboard, are designed to be operated in<br>
potentially rapid alteration, in such a way that touch-<br>
typing motions used to operate one of the keyboards<br>
transfer seamlessly to touch-typing motions used to<br>
operate the other keyboard. This keyboard has the<br>
additional advantage of having the potential to reduce<br>
typing injuries, as well as other objects and advantages,<br>
as will be described in the detailed specification.<br>
The above-mentioned embodiments taken together show<br>
that different keyboard uses imply different kinds of<br>
optimality, which, since a given user may need keyboards<br>
for several different uses, in turn implies that<br>
mechanisms must be provided for several different<br>
solutions to co-exist in a single device. A surprising<br>
solution to this problem, made possible by the small<br>
typable device sizes achievable with ambiguous codes, is<br>
the twice-foldable personal digital assistant described<br>
in this embodiment.<br>
The embodiments discussed up to this point involve<br>
both hardware and software specification. However, it<br>
is possible to achieve many of the objects of this<br>
invention using a purely, or predominantly, software<br>
solution. An example software solution is worked out in<br>
detail to show how specifics of existing hardware can be<br>
incorporated using appropriate software to achieve some<br>
of the objects of this invention.<br>
A final set of embodiments synergistically unites,<br>
for the first time, two alternative approaches to<br>
producing keyboards with a small number of keys: chording<br>
methods and ambiguous-code methods.<br>
First it is shown that by ergonomic construction of<br>
chording patterns, coupled with optimization of lookup<br>
error rate and query rate, an ambiguous code on n keys<br>
can be made to behave like an ambiguous code on m<br>
substantially larger than n keys. When, in particular,<br>
this method is applied to the standard ambiguous code,<br>
the 8 letter keys of the standard ambiguous code gain the<br>
properties of substantially optimal codes without<br>
chording on 13 keys. Comments on how to extend ambiguous<br>
code creation discussed throughout with reference to<br>
English can be extended to other languages. For<br>
concreteness, this discussion is carried out with respect<br>
to this embodiment, but the comments apply generally to<br>
all embodiments.<br>
Second, it is shown that combining a divide and<br>
conquer method with the methods exemplified by the<br>
previous embodiment, the number of input means can be<br>
further reduced, in this example 4 input means are used<br>
to operate an ambiguous encoding with 16 elements. The<br>
number 4 is chosen so that a handheld device embodying<br>
this code can be operated using the fingers and thumb of<br>
the hand holding the device.<br>
Operational overview of a strongly touch typable device.<br>
Figure 2 shows an operational overview of a strongly<br>
touch typable device based on an ambiguous code. Such a<br>
device possesses input means, the manipulation of which<br>
140 causes sequences of encoding symbols to be generated<br>
141. A strongly touch typable ambiguous code is used to<br>
map these sequences of encoding symbols to sequences of<br>
decoding symbols in step 142. These sequences of encoding<br>
symbols may then be selectively output, either on a<br>
display for direct observation by the user of the device,<br>
or in some electronic form for further processing,<br>
transmission, or storage 142.<br>
It should be pointed out that the ambiguous code of<br>
the device of figure 2 overview satisfy other ergonomic<br>
criteria in addition to strong touch typability.<br>
Construction of substantially optimal codes The<br>
methodological steps to optimize an ambiguous code with<br>
respect to a set of ergonomic criteria are explained in<br>
reference to figure 3. In summary, the steps are as<br>
follows:<br>
• 2000 selecting a set of statistically<br>
correlated decoding symbols to be represented<br>
in an ambiguous code, comprising the sub steps<br>
of<br>
- 2007 selecting a set of reference<br>
statistics,<br>
- 2008 analyzing the statistical<br>
correlation of symbols relative to<br>
the statistics selected in<br>
step 2007<br>
• 2001 selecting a disambiguation method.<br>
• 2002 selecting the number of encoding symbols.<br>
• 2003 selecting the ergonomic criteria with<br>
respect to which the code should be<br>
substantially optimal.<br>
• 2004 weighting the importance of ergonomic<br>
criteria selected in step 2003.<br>
• 2005 selecting an optimization method.<br>
• 2006 applying the optimization method selected<br>
in step 2005, whereby substantially<br>
optimal ambiguous codes are produced.<br>
It will be appreciated that the steps 2000 through<br>
2003 might be applied in any order, and that the<br>
application of one of these steps could influence the<br>
choices at other of these steps. Details regarding the<br>
application of these steps will now be explained.<br>
Step 2000 selecting a set of statistically<br>
correlated symbols to be represented in an ambiguous<br>
code. This step is comprised of the substeps of 2007<br>
selecting a set of reference statistics, and 2008<br>
analyzing the statistical correlation of symbols relative<br>
to the statistics selected in step 2007. The goal of<br>
these steps is to identify those symbols which are<br>
capable of being represented ambiguously. All<br>
disambiguation methods work by exploiting correlations<br>
between symbols to make predictions about which sequence<br>
of decoding symbols should be associated with a given<br>
sequence of encoding symbols. If a decoding symbol is<br>
distributed randomly throughout all texts to be encoded,<br>
then it cannot be represented in an ambiguous code, since<br>
no predictions can be made about a randomly distributed<br>
symbol. Typically, for any natural language, the symbols<br>
used to encode that language (for instance, letters in<br>
the case of English, ideograms in the case of Chinese)<br>
are sufficiently statistically correlated that an<br>
effective ambiguous code for these symbols can be<br>
designed. There may be other symbols, such as punctuation<br>
symbols, which are significantly statistically correlated<br>
with each other, and with the letters or ideograms used<br>
to write the language. The fine details of steps 2007 and<br>
2008 depend on the natural language to be represented.<br>
Analysis of statistical correlation of symbols used in<br>
written natural language is a well-known art to<br>
linguists.<br>
Step 2001, selecting a disambiguation method. As<br>
has already been mentioned, there are currently at least<br>
two well-know methods of disambiguation, block-based and<br>
word-based disambiguation. Both of these methods use<br>
statistical correlation between symbols to make<br>
predictions about which sequence of decoding symbols to<br>
set in correspondence with a given sequence of encoding<br>
symbols. Both block-based and word-based methods can be<br>
augmented though use of higher-level information about a<br>
language, such as its syntax and semantics. The goal of<br>
this present method is to construct an ambiguous code<br>
such that, relative to the selected disambiguation<br>
method, optimal selection of a decoding sequence to<br>
correspond to each encoding sequence. Therefore, the<br>
details of the selected disambiguation method can<br>
influence the detailed nature of the ambiguous code to be<br>
thus designed. This method will be illustrated with<br>
respect to the selection of word-based disambiguation as<br>
the disambiguation method, though other disambiguation<br>
methods will also be discussed.<br>
Step 2002, selecting the number of encoding symbols.<br>
The selection of the number of encoding symbols is<br>
crucial to the design of a typable device based on<br>
ambiguous codes. This selection is made in view of many<br>
factors, including the size of the typable device and the<br>
acceptable level of ambiguity. These factors and their<br>
interplay are best explained in reference to concrete<br>
examples; such examples are taken up later in this<br>
disclosure.<br>
Step 2003, selecting the ergonomic criteria with<br>
respect to which the code should be substantially<br>
optimal. An essential aspect of this invention is the<br>
discovery and definition of several ergonomic criteria<br>
which determine the quality of a typable device based on<br>
ambiguous codes. These criteria include strong touch<br>
typability, lookup rate, query rate, anatomic fidelity,<br>
physiological fidelity, conservation of convention,<br>
partition structure, cross-platform compatibility,<br>
regularity of layout, and scan rate. Depending on the<br>
application, one or more of these criteria may be<br>
relevant to the design of a typable device.<br>
Step 2004, weighting the importance of ergonomic<br>
criteria selected in step 2003. When more than one<br>
ergonomic criterion is relevant to the design of a<br>
typable device, some weighting of the importance of these<br>
criteria must be decided upon. It is rarely the case that<br>
the same optimum with respect to a given ergonomic<br>
criterion can be achieved when that ergonomic criterion<br>
is considered in isolation as when it is also necessary<br>
to optimize relative to another ergonomic criterion.<br>
Step 2005, selecting an optimization method. Two<br>
optimization methods will be discussed in more detail<br>
below, random selection, and directed random walk. Of the<br>
two, random selection is typically easier to implement,<br>
yet directed random walk produces better codes. These<br>
two methods are representative of a large class of<br>
methods which might be appropriate for the design of a<br>
given typable device. In some cases, for instance the<br>
first chording/ ambiguous code device considered below,<br>
the number of codes to be examined is small enough that<br>
all of them can be checked exhaustively.<br>
Step 2006, applying the optimization method selected<br>
in step 2005, whereby substantially optimal ambiguous<br>
codes are produced. Regardless of the optimization<br>
method selected in step 2005, some skill must be used<br>
when applying the method to produce substantially optimal<br>
ambiguous codes. In particular, when an optimum is<br>
required with respect to several ergonomic criteria at<br>
once, it is preferable to consider each ergonomic<br>
criterion first in isolation, whereby an estimate can be<br>
made of the code quality ultimately achievable. This<br>
estimate can be invaluable for fine-tuning the<br>
optimization process, as will be discussed in more detail<br>
below, once two optimization methods have been fully<br>
introduced.<br>
Random Search The basic method for finding a code with<br>
good properties is to choose codes at random, test their<br>
properties, and select those which have the best<br>
properties. Exhaustive enumeration, in which all codes in<br>
the candidate set are tested, is typically not a viable<br>
option since the number of codes is too large to be<br>
tested in any reasonable amount of computer time.<br>
Random search provides a benchmark by which the<br>
utility of other methods of code selection can be<br>
measured. Suppose that a set of ergonoraic criteria, and<br>
a weighting on those criteria is given. One can estimate<br>
the substantial optimality of a first ambiguous code with<br>
respect to those criteria and those weightings by.<br>
generating additional ambiguous codes at random. If in a<br>
small number of random trials it is possible to find a<br>
code with equal or better values with respect to the<br>
given ergonomic criteria than the first code, then that<br>
first code is not substantially optimal.<br>
If, on the other hand, it can be shown that a<br>
substantially large number of random trials is required<br>
to produce a code with values better than or equal to the<br>
first code, or that on better code exists, then the first<br>
code is substantially optimal.<br>
With reference to figure 4 we state in detail a<br>
method for rejecting the hypothesis that a candidate<br>
ambiguous code is substantially optimal. In summary, the<br>
steps are:<br>
• 3000 determining a set of relevant constraints<br>
which define an appropriate set of codes<br>
which contains the candidate code.<br>
• 3001 determining the set of ergonomic criteria<br>
with respect to which the candidate code<br>
may be substantially optimal.<br>
• 3002 randomly selecting a subset of codes from<br>
the set determined in step 3001.<br>
• 3003 evaluating each of the codes selected in<br>
step 3002 with respect to each of the<br>
ergonomic criteria determined in<br>
step 3001.<br>
• 3004 comparing the values of the candidate code<br>
with respect to the ergonomic criteria<br>
selected in step 3001 with the values<br>
found in step 3003. If any of the values<br>
found in step 3003 are more optimal than<br>
the values of the candidate code, then the<br>
hypothesis that the candidate code is<br>
substantially optimal can be rejected.<br>
Details concerning these steps:<br>
Step 3000, determining a set of relevant constraints<br>
which define an appropriate set of codes which contains<br>
the candidate code. The set with respect to which the<br>
substantial optimality of a candidate code is to be<br>
evaluated must be appropriately defined. Some of the<br>
potentially relevant constraints are: number of encoding<br>
symbols, partition structure, and admission of a<br>
specified ordering, such as alphabetic ordering. Each of<br>
these constraints limits the set of codes to which the<br>
candidate code is appropriately compared to.<br>
Step 3001, determining the set of ergonomic criteria<br>
with respect to which the candidate code may be<br>
substantially optimal. Some of the criteria which might<br>
be relevant for the analysis of the candidate code are:<br>
lookup error rate, query rate, admission of a<br>
specified ordering, such as alphabetic ordering,<br>
admission of a regular layout, and anatomic fidelity.<br>
Once steps 3000 and 3001 are performed, a<br>
distribution of code properties over a set is defined,<br>
and this distribution can be sampled randomly. Figure 5<br>
presents an example in which sets of codes are defined as<br>
having 1) an even-as-possible partition, and 2) a<br>
specified number of encoding symbols, where the specified<br>
number is 7, 9, 11, and 13. This definition completes<br>
step 3000. Then it is determined that lookup error is the<br>
sole relevant ergonomic criterion. This determination<br>
completes step 3001. Together, these steps determine a<br>
distribution, the shape of which can be determined by<br>
random sampling, steps 3002 and 3003. In the figure 5,<br>
5000 codes from each distribution are selected,<br>
completing step 3002, and the lookup error of each is<br>
measured, completing step 3003. The data are presented as<br>
percent lookup error (the reciprocal of lookup error<br>
rate) vs. the number of codes with the given percent<br>
lookup error. It is seen that the distributions become<br>
increasing strongly peaked as the number of keys<br>
increases. If the process is repeated but with query<br>
probability replacing lookup probability, we obtain the<br>
data shown in figure 6.<br>
To illustrate step 3004, a candidate code whose<br>
substantial optimality to be tested is selected. This<br>
code is the 14-key code pn gt cr zk wj a e hi so ud xf ym<br>
vl qb proposed by [1]. The lookup error of this code<br>
relative to our reference statistics is 105 words/lookup<br>
error. Proceeding as above, we determine that 14-key code<br>
with an even-as-possible partition with lookup error<br>
equal to or better than that of the candidate code can be<br>
found in 7 random trials on average. If we repeat the<br>
process, except for using query rate instead of lookup<br>
error rate as the relevant ergonomic criterion, we find<br>
that a code with better query rate than the candidate<br>
code (4 words/query) will be found in 3 out of 4 random<br>
trials on average. Thus the ambiguous code of [1]<br>
substantially optimal either with respect to lookup error<br>
rate, or with respect to query rate. Indeed, with respect<br>
to query rate, most codes are better than the given code.<br>
As a rule of thumb, if a code has not been<br>
explicitly optimized with respect to an ergonomic<br>
criterion, then it is likely that it is not substantially<br>
optimal with respect to that criterion, as measured with<br>
respect to any reasonable set of language statistics.<br>
Directed Random Walk<br>
Directed random walk is an iterative optimization<br>
method wherein, at each step, a previously best code is<br>
used as a seed for generating new codes, one or more of<br>
which may be better than the best previously found. As<br>
the process is iterated, better and better codes are thus<br>
found. The procedure will first be explained<br>
intuitively, and then more formally.<br>
In the present context, optimization of ambiguous<br>
codes with respect to one or more ergonomic criteria, we<br>
assume no detailed knowledge of the structure of the<br>
space to be searched. In the absence of such knowledge,<br>
one is blind of foresight as to which direction to move<br>
to best continue the search. Thus, the safest procedure<br>
to take small as possible steps in as many as possible<br>
directions, and refrain from moving until steps in each<br>
of these as many as possible directions have been<br>
evaluated and compared. As an accumulation of small<br>
steps may lead a searcher into a cul-de-sac, any such<br>
search should be augmented with a "restart" procedure<br>
which always the search step back out of unpromising or<br>
blocked avenues.<br>
More formally, the problem is to take minimal steps<br>
though the space of ambiguous codes and direct these<br>
steps though that space toward the desired codes.<br>
According to the teachings of this invention,<br>
substantially minimal steps in space of ambiguous codes<br>
correspond to single pairwise permutations of assignments<br>
of decoding symbols to encoding symbols. At each step of<br>
the optimization method, it is desirable to test as many<br>
pairwise permutations as possible, preferably all<br>
possible pairwise permutations. The step is completed by<br>
choosing the pairwise permutation which gives the largest<br>
improvement in the property to be thereby optimized. If<br>
there is no largest improvement, then one of the pairwise<br>
permutations is chosen at random.<br>
In reference to figure 7, the steps of the method<br>
are as follows:<br>
• 4000 choosing a starting code from the set of<br>
candidate codes.<br>
• 4001 generating new codes from the starting<br>
code by perturbation of the starting code,<br>
preferably, by pairwise permutations of<br>
the assignment of symbols to keys,<br>
preferably all possible pairwise<br>
permutations.<br>
• 4002 measuring the properties of the codes thus<br>
generated.<br>
• 4003 checking if a stopping criterion has been<br>
reached, such as a criterion of limited<br>
further improvement.<br>
• 4004 outputting the best code, if the stopping<br>
criterion has been reached.<br>
• 4005 if the stopping criterion has not been<br>
reached, checking to see if the set of<br>
codes generated by perturbation of the<br>
current starting code contain a code<br>
better than the current best code.<br>
• 4006 if there is a code in the current set of<br>
codes better than the current best,<br>
selecting the best of these as the new<br>
current best.<br>
• 4007 selecting a new starting code. If step<br>
4005 yields YES, selecting as new starting<br>
code the best code from the current set,<br>
else, select a new starting code from the<br>
current set at random. Upon completion,<br>
return to step 4001.<br>
When there is but one criterion to be optimized,<br>
selection of the best code from the set of candidate<br>
codes is a simple matter of choosing the code in the set<br>
which has the most optimal value of the criterion.<br>
However, when there are several criteria to be<br>
simultaneously optimized there is but a partial ordering<br>
on the values of the criteria, and it is not obvious how<br>
to select among these values in order to best advance the<br>
optimization procedure.<br>
One way to perform simultaneous optimization is to<br>
optimize with respect to each variable independently.<br>
Then, in cases of conflict, where the simultaneous<br>
optimum can not be achieved, this being the generic case,<br>
some weighting of the importance of each criterion must<br>
be established. And that relative weighting is part of<br>
the design constraints.<br>
Construction of Strongly Touch-typable Codes In order to<br>
facilitate the explanation of how to make and use<br>
strongly touch-typable ambiguous codes, we will fix three<br>
increasingly strict levels of strong touch typability.<br>
• Level A This level of touch typability is<br>
exemplified by a casual, tolerant typist<br>
characterized in that he or she 1) types 2 0<br>
words per minute and accepts distractions every<br>
15 seconds, that is, a query rate of one query<br>
every 5 words on average, and 2) accepts a 2<br>
percent lookup error, that is, a lookup error<br>
rate of one error every 50 words, or two and M<br>
minutes of typing.<br>
• Level B This level of touch typability is<br>
exemplified by a less casual, less tolerant<br>
typist characterized in that he or she 1) types<br>
20 words per minute and accepts distractions<br>
every 3 0 seconds, that is, a query rate of one<br>
query every 10 words on average, and 2) accepts<br>
a 1 percent lookup error, that is, a lookup<br>
error rate of one error every 100 words, or 5<br>
minutes of typing.<br>
• Level C This level of touch typability is<br>
exemplified by a skilled typist characterized<br>
in that he or she 1) types 40 words per minute<br>
and accepts distractions every 30 seconds, that<br>
is, a query every 20 words on average, and 2)<br>
accepts a 0.5 percent lookup error, that is, a<br>
lookup error every 200 words, or 5 minutes of<br>
typing.<br>
With reference to figure 8, we point out that the<br>
method to construct strongly touch touchable codes<br>
comprises the following steps:<br>
• 5000 Determining quantitative values of<br>
acceptable lookup error rate and query<br>
rate.<br>
• 5001 Selecting an ambiguous code optimization<br>
method.<br>
• 5002 Determining the minimal number of keys<br>
required such that using said number of<br>
keys and the optimization method selected<br>
in step 5001 it is possible to achieve the<br>
values of lookup error rate and query rate<br>
determined in step 5000.<br>
• 5003 Determining the maximal number of keys<br>
allowable given the design of the target<br>
typable device.<br>
• 5004 Deciding if the design criteria are<br>
compatible. If the number determined in<br>
step 5003 is greater than or equal to the<br>
number determined in step 5002, then the<br>
design criteria are compatible, otherwise<br>
they are not.<br>
• 5005 If the design criteria are compatible, as<br>
determined in step 5004, apply the<br>
optimization procedure selected in step<br>
5001 to construct an appropriate strongly<br>
touch-typable ambiguous code. If they are<br>
not compatible then the procedure fails.<br>
Details of this method are as follows:<br>
Step 5000, Determining quantitative values of<br>
acceptable lookup error rate and query rate. This could<br>
be done by testing of an individual or group of<br>
individuals, or by simply preselecting desired values for<br>
lookup error rate and query rate, for instance, by<br>
selecting a level of strong touch-typability as described<br>
above.<br>
Step 5001, Selecting an ambiguous code optimization<br>
method. In reference to the construction of<br>
substantially optimal ambiguous codes above, two<br>
optimization methods were discussed: random search and<br>
directed random walk. Random search is less powerful than<br>
directed random walk, but may suffice if the number of<br>
allowed keys is high enough, and the level of desired<br>
strong touch-typability is low enough. An ever weaker<br>
method, selection of a code in a single random trial,<br>
could be sufficient in some circumstances. To see this<br>
in more quantitative detail, some experimental results<br>
are discussed in reference to figures 9, 10 and 11.<br>
In this experiment, 5000 ambiguous codes with an<br>
even-as-possible partition were selected at random from<br>
each of the sets of ambiguous codes for 2-20 keys. In<br>
addition, for each number of keys 2-20, an optimization<br>
run was performed using directed random walk, in each of<br>
three conditions, 1) optimization for lookup error rate<br>
only, 2) optimization for query rate only, and 3)<br>
optimization for both lookup error and query rate, using<br>
a target value method. From the values of lookup error<br>
rate and query rate calculated for the randomly selected<br>
codes, the following statistics were computed: best<br>
value, worst value, average value, and median value. All<br>
these statistics are plotted in figure 9 for the lookup<br>
error rate, and in figure 10 for the query rate, together<br>
with the results of an optimization run in which lookup<br>
error rate and query rate, respectively, was the sole<br>
ergonomic criterion optimized for. The results from<br>
optimization runs in which lookup error rate and query<br>
rate were simultaneously optimized are shown in<br>
figure 11. From all these data, a decision can.be<br>
reached as to which optimization method to use. While it<br>
is always preferable to use the most powerful method at<br>
one's disposal, it may be that a less powerful method may<br>
be sufficient, for instance, any single, randomly<br>
selected code could meet specified criteria, if these<br>
criteria are sufficiently lax. This will be discussed<br>
further below.<br>
Step 5002, Determining the minimal number of keys<br>
required such that using said number of keys and the<br>
optimization method selected in step 5001 it is possible<br>
to achieve the values of lookup error rate and query rate<br>
determined in step 5000.<br>
With reference to the experimental results described<br>
above, and the selected levels of strong touch typability<br>
described above, one can construct a table giving the<br>
minimum number of keys required for each of the three<br>
levels of strong touch typability, and reference to the<br>
three types of optimization mentioned. This table is<br>
presented in figure 12.<br>
Step 5003, Determining the maximal number of keys<br>
allowable given the design of the target typable device.<br>
Ambiguous codes will be typically used in small devices,<br>
and the number of keys will generally be a compromise<br>
between key size and total typable device size. In some<br>
cases, convention may enforce a key number, such as the<br>
convention of using 12 keys for a telephone keypad.<br>
Step 5004, Deciding if the design criteria are<br>
compatible. If the number determined in step 5003 is<br>
greater than or equal to the number determined in step<br>
5002, then the design criteria are compatible, otherwise<br>
they are not.<br>
As will be seen more clearly in the detailed<br>
specification of the device embodiments presented below,<br>
the number of keys permissible in a typable device can<br>
depend on many factors, and can be more or less rigidly<br>
determined by these factors.<br>
Step 5005/ If the design criteria are compatible, as<br>
determined in step 5004, apply the optimization procedure<br>
selected in step 5001 to construct an appropriate<br>
strongly touch-typable ambiguous code. If they are not<br>
compatible then the procedure fails.<br>
If the procedure fails then at least one of the<br>
following things must happen:<br>
• A stronger optimization method is chosen.<br>
• The device design is modified to allow for more<br>
keys.<br>
• A lower value of strong touch typability is<br>
accepted.<br>
• The device is abandoned.<br>
Smart Card on 9 to 16 letter keys Smart cards are<br>
substantially credit-card sized devices containing<br>
computer components such as a processor and a memory.<br>
They are currently used in applications such as security<br>
and banking, but have many other possible uses. This<br>
embodiment shows how it is possible to equip a smart-<br>
card-sized device with a touch-typable keyboard, and thus<br>
vastly expand the range of applications which these<br>
devices can serve. As a simple example, in banking and<br>
security applications, smart card users must currently<br>
remember a string of digits which is the password for the<br>
device. However, with a typable smart card, easy-to-<br>
remember, though relatively long, pass phrase in natural<br>
language could be used in the place of a difficult-to-<br>
remember, albeit short, numeric password. Examples of<br>
smart-card sized devices to which the teachings of this<br>
embodiment could be applied include the personal digital<br>
assistants manufactured by the Franklin Corporation and<br>
sold under the trademark REX.<br>
Given present technology, the small size of smart<br>
cards substantially forbids complex and power-consuming<br>
communication components for transmission of data entered<br>
on the keyboard on the card. Thus, this smart-card<br>
embodiment teaches a low-cost machine for ergonomically<br>
and efficiently sending messages using standard touch<br>
tones, and standard touch-tone generators.<br>
Most telephones have but 12 keys, each associated<br>
with a touch tone, in the sense that activating each key<br>
causes a distinguished touch tone to be emitted by the<br>
phone. However, the universal DTMF standard provides for<br>
16 touch tones, and the DTMF tone generator installed in<br>
most telephones is capable of generating all 16 of these<br>
tones. By exploiting the additional tones, each of up to<br>
16 keys can be assigned to a touch tone, and used to<br>
encode alphanumeric symbol sequences. Other things being<br>
equal, the larger the number of keys, the lower the<br>
ambiguity of codes associated to these keys. The teaching<br>
of this embodiment is thus to use substantially all of<br>
the 16 touch tones to encode alphanumeric sequences. In<br>
this way, machinery for the communication of information<br>
with low-ambiguity codes can be produced using readily<br>
available, low-cost components.<br>
This embodiment has the further objects of<br>
• providing a touch-typable keyboard for a smart-<br>
card-sized device.<br>
• providing a method for simulating a set of<br>
encoding symbols which is larger than the set<br>
of encoding symbols which can be physically<br>
generated by a device<br>
• providing an example of a device in which<br>
lookup error is the dominant ergonomic<br>
criterion.<br>
• providing a keyboard/visual display device<br>
geometry which is adapted for smart-card-sized<br>
devices.<br>
• providing a disambiguation mechanism which is<br>
operable using very limited computer memory.<br>
• providing an example of a system wherein more<br>
than one disambiguation mechanism may be<br>
operable, each adapted to local computational<br>
capabilities. In this case, a first<br>
disambiguation mechanism is used to provide<br>
feedback to the user, at the sending end of a<br>
communication, while a second disambiguation<br>
mechanism is used at the receiving end of the<br>
communication.<br>
We will now discuss in detail the manner in which<br>
these objects are achieved by the present embodiment.<br>
Strongly touch-typable keyboard Smart card devices are<br>
small, so only a small number of substantially full-<br>
sized keys can be located on them. If some of the area of<br>
the card is to be reserved for a visual display device,<br>
then the area available for keys is further reduced. The<br>
preferable compromise in number of keys between the<br>
requirement of substantially full-sized keys for touch-<br>
typability, and the requirement of a large number of keys<br>
to allow for low-ambiguity codes, is in the range, of 9-16<br>
keys. Two possible layouts for devices with a number of<br>
keys in this range are shown in figure 16 and 15. The<br>
arrangement and functionality of the keys and their<br>
relationship to other components of the smart card will<br>
be discussed in detail below.<br>
Synthesizing encoding symbols using encoding sequences<br>
with meaningless decodings With reference to figure 13,<br>
let us divide the set of decoding symbols into two<br>
subsets: 1) a core set, consisting of symbols to be<br>
associated encoding symbols bearing a one-to-one<br>
relationship with physical input means, and 2) an<br>
auxiliary set consisting of symbols to be associated with<br>
encoding symbols bearing a many-to-one relationship with<br>
physical input means {step 100). Then, the method of<br>
synthesizing encoding symbols further comprises the steps<br>
of<br>
• 101 establishing a first, potentially<br>
ambiguous, code which associates subsets of the<br>
core set with encoding symbols, said encoding<br>
symbols bearing a one-to-one relationship with<br>
physical signals which can be generated by the<br>
typable device for physically representing<br>
encoding symbols,<br>
• 102 identifying short sequences of encoding<br>
symbols which are such that no possible<br>
decoding of the sequence of encoding symbols<br>
forms part of a meaningful decoding.<br>
• 103 establishing a second, potentially<br>
ambiguous, code as a relationship between<br>
subsets of the auxiliary set of decoding<br>
symbols with the short sequences of encoding<br>
symbols identified in step 102.<br>
For example, let us associate 16 encoding symbols<br>
with the 16 DTMP tones, so that said tones physically<br>
represent the encoding symbols. The tones will be<br>
labelled (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, *,#,A,B,C,D). We will<br>
take as the core set of symbols the letters [a-z], and<br>
associate them with the physically representable encoding<br>
symbols via a first ambiguous code as follow<br>
(0,aw),(l,bi),(2,cx),(3,d),(4,ej), (5,fo),(6,g),(7,hv),<br>
(8,ky) , (9,1) , (*,mu) , (in) , (A,pz) , (B,qr) , (C,s) , (D,t) ,<br>
where the first element of each pair gives the encoding<br>
symbol, and the second element of each pair gives the<br>
decoding symbols associated to the encoding symbol. The<br>
auxiliary set of decoding symbols will be a singleton set<br>
consisting of the symbol "space". Thus we synthesize one<br>
encoding symbol to represent the one decoding symbol<br>
"space". A candidate sequence is A8A, which corresponds<br>
to the following decoding sequences (pkp pkz zkp zkz pyp<br>
pyz zyp zyz). None of these decoding sequences form part<br>
of any word in our reference list of meaningful<br>
sequences, thus the encoding sequence A8A is a suitable<br>
sequence for representing an element of the auxiliary<br>
set, and we form the pair (A8A,"space") to represent the<br>
"space" symbol. The "space" symbol can then be associated<br>
with an input means, which input means will cause the<br>
sequence of tones associated to A8A to be emitted each<br>
time said input means is activated. On the receiving end,<br>
a decoding means will transform the sequence A8A to the<br>
"space" symbol. Whether a given input means is associated<br>
to a single physically representable encoding symbol, or<br>
a synthesized encoding symbol, is entirely transparent to<br>
the user. An arbitrarily large auxiliary set of decoding<br>
symbols can be represented in this way. It will be<br>
appreciated that given the above specificatxon, a<br>
programmer of ordinary skill would oe easily capable of<br>
creating software to automatically generate any desired<br>
number of synthesized encoding symbols, given a set of<br>
reference statistics, and a first (ambiguous) code for<br>
tne core set or encoding symbols.<br>
Providing a disambiguation mechanism which is operable<br>
using very limited computer memory. The limited<br>
processing power and memory capacity of present-<br>
generation smart cards puts a substantial premium on low<br>
ambiguity in ambiguous code designs; little computing<br>
power is available in the card to be devoted to<br>
disambiguation machinery.<br>
For any ambiguous code, most of the disambiguation<br>
effort, on the part of the computing hardware and<br>
software as well as on the part of the user, is incurred<br>
in selecting which of the alternative decodings to an<br>
ambiguous encoding should be selected. In view of the<br>
limited computing capability of the smart card, querying<br>
for alternative decodings can be eliminated entirely. In<br>
the absence of querying, only the most probable decoding<br>
for each encoding need be stored, for only the most-<br>
probable decoding sequence will be output by the<br>
disambiguation mechanism when each encoding sequence is<br>
received. With this simplification, a particularly<br>
compact form of the database can be obtained, e.g. in the<br>
form of a simple suffix tree. Since querying is<br>
eliminated sufficient visual feedback can be provided<br>
using only a simple, low-power requirement display, for<br>
example, a single-line traveling banner display related<br>
to the type of display used in pocket calculators or<br>
digital watches.<br>
This method of disambiguation, in which only the<br>
most-probable decoding sequence is stored and output,<br>
we will refer to as simple lookup disambiguation. Simple<br>
lookup disambiguation is only effectively operable with<br>
ambiguous codes which are sufficiently strongly touch<br>
typable. Thus a surprising consequence of strongly touch<br>
typable codes is that they permit effective operation of<br>
very simplified disambiguation mechanisms.<br>
An example 16-key substantially optimal ambiguous<br>
code suitable for application in the present embodiment<br>
is the code aw bi ex d ej fo g hv ky 1 mu n pz qr s t<br>
with lookup error rate 4043 words/lookup error, and a<br>
query rate of 68 words/query, this code is shown is an<br>
example layout 51 on a 16-letter-key smart card in<br>
figure 15. This figure also reveals a display means 50<br>
for displaying decodings of encoding symbols entered via<br>
the keyboard, and an auxiliary input means 51, which is<br>
thumb-activatable, and could be used to encode a variety<br>
of additional symbols and mode changes, as will be<br>
discussed more fully in reference to other embodiments.<br>
Here it is to be especially noted that the display means<br>
50 is preferably placed in such a way that 1) both the<br>
letter input means 51 and the thumb-actuated auxiliary<br>
input means 52 are in a comfortable position to be<br>
actuated by one hand (in this figure, the right hand),<br>
while, at the same time, allowing the keys to be as large<br>
as possible, given the small size of the smart card, and<br>
also allowing the screen to be comfortably and fully<br>
viewed in the frame formed by the thumb and the index<br>
finger of the hand actuating the input means 51 and 52.<br>
This unique and preferred arrangement solves the problem<br>
of allowing a touch-typable keyboard and a large-as-<br>
possible display means to functionally co-exist on a<br>
smart card.<br>
Since queries are not permitted at the sending end<br>
in this embodiment, this code was chosen by directed-<br>
random-walk optimization using lookup error as the only<br>
criterion of optimality. It is to be noted that lookup<br>
errors using this code will occur on average only once<br>
every roughly 16 pages of typed text. Thus this code is<br>
suitable for accurate communication of substantially long<br>
messages, even in the absence of a querying mechanism. If<br>
it were desirable to sacrifice some lookup optimality at<br>
the sending end in order to reduce processing of queries<br>
at the receiving end, an example alternate code optimized<br>
for both query and lookup error is aw bu ex d eV pz go bv<br>
imkylNQprs t with a lookup error rate of 2670<br>
words/lookup and a query rate of 101 words/query. Choice<br>
of a code optimized both with respect to lookup error<br>
rate and query rate would be appropriate in at least two<br>
circumstances, 1) if the smart card were in fact<br>
sufficiently powerful to support a query mechanism,<br>
and/or 2) a query-based disambiguation mechanism would be<br>
used at the receiving end of communications initiated at<br>
the smart card. This latter might be the case, for<br>
instance, if the user composed messages using a smart<br>
card, sent them to another computer over a phone line,<br>
and at some later moment performed a second<br>
disambiguation pass using a more powerful disambiguation<br>
mechanism. Indeed, the second disambiguation pass need<br>
not be performed by the person who composed the message,<br>
but could be performed by a second person, for instance<br>
the first person's secretary.<br>
In any case, the lookup error rate of this second<br>
code is still extremely low, as compared, for instance,<br>
to the rate at which even very skilled typists make<br>
typing errors, approximately 1 error every 100 words. By<br>
any reasonable measure, both of these 16-letter-key codes<br>
must be considered strongly touch typable, as a typist<br>
typing 20 words per minute will only need to answer a<br>
query once every three minutes for the first 16-letter-<br>
key-code, and once every five minutes for the second 16-<br>
letter-key-code. Performing the same optimizations for<br>
ambiguous codes for 9 letter keys, we find, for example,<br>
the code akw bnq cly dhx epv fim gr jot buz optimized<br>
only for lookup error raue, and with lookup error and<br>
query rates of 116 words/lookup error and 4.4<br>
words/query respectively. This code is shown in an<br>
example layout on a 9-letter-key smart card in figure 16.<br>
Optimizing for both lookup error rate and query rate sing<br>
the directed random walk method, one can also construct<br>
codes such as am bnz cfi dhx evw gjr kos luy pqt with<br>
lookup error and query rates of 109 words/lookup error<br>
and 6.2 words/query respectively. It is to be noted<br>
that since no querying can be performed using simple<br>
lookup disambiguation, strong touch typability can only<br>
be discussed in terms of the lookup error rate. An<br>
evaluation must be made as to whether lookup errors occur<br>
at a sufficiently low rate as to produce acceptable text.<br>
Even for these 9-key codes, the lookup error rate is<br>
comparable to the rate at which skilled typists produce -<br>
typing errors, hence these codes can be considered<br>
strongly touch typable in this context. Further, since<br>
the smart card would typically be used for short<br>
messaging, composition of electronic mail, communications<br>
to pagers, and the' like, standards for text accuracy may<br>
be lower than standards for transcription of final-copy<br>
text, for instance. It is from these considerations that<br>
we arrive at the definition of 9 to 16 keys as the<br>
preferred range for this embodiment. More than 16 keys<br>
are difficult to fit into a smart card format while<br>
retaining the advantages of substantially full-sized<br>
keys. On the other hand, ambiguous codes on fewer than 9<br>
keys may not be strongly touch typable with respect to<br>
the simple disambiguation mechanisms compatible with the<br>
smart card's limited computing power.<br>
Feedback to the typist A smart card equipped with simple<br>
lookup disambiguation could be operated by a person who<br>
is a competent touch typist, needing no feedback from the<br>
card as to the progress of the communication, and/or<br>
getting feedback from the machinery at the receiving end<br>
of the communication, potentially over a phone line and<br>
potentially in the form of speech synthesized on the<br>
basis of the symbols input by the typist on the smart<br>
card. It is desirable, however, to provide feedback<br>
directly from the card whenever there are sufficient<br>
computing resources built into the card to supply that<br>
feedback.<br>
Here it is pointed out that the computing resources<br>
needed to provide useful feedback are even less than the<br>
computing resources needed for simple lookup<br>
disambiguation. Even if no disambiguation database and<br>
software is present on the card, and using only<br>
rudimentary electronic circuitry, well known to those<br>
skilled in the art, a unique character can be sent<br>
directly to the display in response to each key press,<br>
where said character is the most probable (according to<br>
the reference statistics) letter associated with the key.<br>
Using for example the code aw bi ex d ej fo g hv ky 1 mu<br>
n pz qr s t described above, the resulting text would<br>
typically be quite readable by a human. For example, the<br>
first line of the Gettysburg address, rendered using 1-<br>
block (single-letter) statistics reads as follows:<br>
oour score and sehen kears ago our oathers irought<br>
oorth on this continent, a nea nation, conceihed in<br>
liiertk, and dedicated to the proposition that all<br>
uen are created erual.<br>
This level of accuracy is already enough provide a<br>
rough guide to the typist as to the text he or she is in<br>
the process of entering on the smart card. This example<br>
shows that disambiguation can be accomplished with<br>
extremely small amounts of memory; here the only memory<br>
required is that needed to store the 16 characters which<br>
will be displayed in response to activation of the 16<br>
keys. This approach is scalable in terms of the computing<br>
resources required. With successively more memory,<br>
2-,3-, and higher-block probabilities could be stored<br>
and used as the basis of well-known block-based<br>
disambiguation, and thus render the text with increasing<br>
accuracy for display to the user.<br>
While block-based disambiguation is well known in<br>
the art, it has heretofore proved to be not practical.<br>
This example shows the reason for this: block-based<br>
disambiguation is not powerful enough to effectively<br>
disambiguate codes which are too ambiguous. In this<br>
example block-based disambiguation is coupled with a<br>
code which is sufficiently strongly touch-typable,<br>
sufficiently disambiguous, that it permits effective<br>
disambiguation with a block-based method. The prior art<br>
has taught away from block-based disambiguation in favor<br>
or word-based disambiguation. However, in application<br>
of the teachings of this invention, block-based<br>
disambiguation is made operable and viable for practical<br>
use.<br>
The example further shows that 1) word-based<br>
disambiguation is not reguired to practice the teachings<br>
of this invention, 2) a micro-processor is not required<br>
to practice the teachings of this invention, and 3) more<br>
than one, potentially different, disambiguation<br>
mechanisms can be used in the same communication system<br>
based on ambiguous codes. Word-based disambiguation, or<br>
another disambiguation method, could be used at the<br>
receiving end of a communication sent from the smart<br>
card, while locally the smart card is using simple block-<br>
based disambiguation td provide feedback to the user of<br>
the smart card.<br>
As the size of the blocks used in block-based<br>
disambiguation increases, the accuracy of text rendering<br>
increases as well. However, at some block size the amount<br>
of storage required approaches that of the storage<br>
requirements of word-based disambiguation, and since<br>
word-based disambiguation generally gives better results<br>
than block-based disambiguation, word-based<br>
disambiguation will generally be preferred, if there is<br>
enough memory available to support it.<br>
Further applications If there is memory available on the<br>
smart card beyond that required for storage of the<br>
disambiguation database and software, then the potential<br>
applications of this device are greatly increased. For<br>
instance, with only a few bytes of additional memory, a<br>
user could call an appropriate voice response system for<br>
telephone directory information, request a phone number<br>
by typing in a name and other identifying information on<br>
the smart-card keyboard, and could then store the<br>
retrieved phone number in the user memory for later<br>
downloading to another, more powerful, machine.<br>
Query Error Minimization - a typable device for a vehicle<br>
The present embodiment concerns an instance in which<br>
query error is the dominant constraint on typable device<br>
design. It is generally of value to reduce the query<br>
rate since the effort to answer queries distracts from<br>
the typing task. In some applications, however,<br>
reduction of query rate is of paramount importance.<br>
Queries will be displayed on a visual display<br>
in most practical implementations of typable devices<br>
implementing ambiguous codes. When the vision of the<br>
user is otherwise urgently occupied, for example when the<br>
user is driving a car, then, for safety reasons,<br>
distracting that vision to the evaluation of queries must<br>
be kept to a minimum. Even when queries are made by<br>
auditory means, it is crucial to minimize driver<br>
distraction. Further, while driving a car, both hands of<br>
the user are generally occupied in holding the steering<br>
wheel of the car, and should preferably not be removed<br>
from the steering wheel to operate a typable device.<br>
This object can be achieved by embedding the input means<br>
of the typable device directly in the steering wheel.<br>
Referring now to figure 17, we note that any number<br>
of input means could be embedded in a steering wheel<br>
200. Many steering wheels comprise crenulations on the<br>
inner or rear surface of the wheel to provide better grip<br>
for the fingers. For these steering wheels, it is<br>
natural to associate a first plurality of input means 201<br>
with each of a plurality of these crenulations. When the<br>
driver grasps the steering wheel, four of the first input<br>
means 201 are contacted by the fingers of each hand. The<br>
region of the steering wheel contacted by the drivers<br>
hands may change from moment to moment, for instance when<br>
the driver turns the steering wheel through a large<br>
angle. Which set of 8 keys are contacted by the driver's<br>
hands at any one time can be recognized by a position-<br>
sensing means, such as a combination of pressure<br>
sensitive keys with simple electronic circuitry, which<br>
combination will be evident to those skilled in the art.<br>
A second plurality of input means 202 can be placed.along<br>
the outer or upper surface of the steering wheel, whereby<br>
one of said second input means is contacted by the thumb<br>
of each hand while the steering wheel is grasped by the<br>
driver. Again, which of the second input means are<br>
contacted by the thumbs of the driver at any one time can<br>
be detected by an appropriate position-detecting means.<br>
With respect to the steering-wheel embedded keyboard<br>
just sketched, it is natural to select a code on 8 keys,<br>
said keys to be associated with the first input means<br>
contacted by the fingers of both hands, along with two<br>
mode-switching keys to be associated with the second<br>
input means contacted by the thumbs of the driver.<br>
Ambiguous code selection Applying the directed-random-<br>
walk method taught by this invention for selecting<br>
substantially optimal codes, and optimizing only with<br>
respect to the query rate, we construct, for instance,<br>
the following code on 8 letter keys: aksz bcev dfi gmo<br>
hqt jnw luy prae with a lookup error rate of 70.2<br>
words/lookup error, and a query rate of 4.1 words/query.<br>
As throughout this specification, these rates are<br>
calculated with respect to our reference statistics, and<br>
using simple word-based disambiguation as the<br>
disambiguation method. The query rate for this code might<br>
well be too high to consider this code to be strongly<br>
touch-typable. A typist/driver typing 20 words/minute<br>
would be distracted from driving by a query approximately<br>
every 12 second, likely too often to be compatible with<br>
safe driving. On the other hand, even a skilled typist<br>
may not be able to type 20 words per minute while<br>
driving, potentially bringing the relationship between<br>
query and typing rates into an acceptable range for<br>
strong touch typability.<br>
There are several additional strategies for reducing<br>
query rate, beyond choosing a substantially optimal code,<br>
and these strategies can be used in combination. They<br>
include<br>
• Increasing the total number of keys by<br>
increasing the number of keys activatable by<br>
each finger. It will be appreciated that this<br>
could be done, for instance, by adding another<br>
row of keys on the steering wheel, or,<br>
equivalently, making each key<br>
multipositionable, or using a chording method<br>
by which two or more keys are pressed<br>
simultaneously to encode a different subset of<br>
encoding symbols.<br>
• Eliminating queries when the less-probable<br>
decodings are much less probable than the most-<br>
probable decodings. The parameter controlling<br>
how close the probability must be between most-<br>
probable and less-probable decodings must be to<br>
invoke a query is a parameter whose value could<br>
be selected by the user. Such a mechanism<br>
could be of value in any embodiment in which<br>
query rate is a relevant ergonomic criterion.<br>
• Using a hybrid chording/ambiguous code method,<br>
as described in detail below.<br>
• Using a disambiguation method which is more<br>
powerful than simple word-based disambiguation.<br>
Phone keypads compatible with existing phone keypads<br>
In this embodiment, the limitation on the number of keys<br>
is paramount since the keypad must be compatible with<br>
existing telephone equipment which generally have 12<br>
keys. For the purposes of this embodiment, we require<br>
that two of these keys must be reserved for non-letter<br>
symbols such as space, backspace, period, and an end-of-<br>
transmission symbol. Thus, the 2 6 letters must be<br>
distributed over at most 10 keys. In this embodiment<br>
both minimal lookup error rate and minimal query rate are<br>
desired. We find that using the optimization methods<br>
taught by this invention and using the even-as-possible<br>
partition on 10 keys, codes such as amq be cdu fiy gpx hi<br>
jsv Jcrz nw ot with lookup error rate of 13 8 words/lookup<br>
error, and query rate of 9.3 words/query can be found,<br>
while simultaneously optimizing for lookup error rate and<br>
query rate. This should be compared to the lookup error<br>
rate of 29 words/lookup error and the query rate 2.2<br>
words/query of the standard ambiguous code, thus, there<br>
is an overall improvement of by more than a factor of 4<br>
over the standard ambiguous code. Said 10-key code<br>
optimized for lookup error rate and query rate is shown<br>
in an example layout on a telephone keypad in figure 18.<br>
We may also compare this 10-key code with two 9-key<br>
codes proposed in United States Patent CITE tegic, and<br>
EPO patent application CITE epo, respectively. The first<br>
of these codes, afg bkn jlo mqr ew dhi sux ptv cyz has a<br>
lookup error rate 86.5 words/lookup error, and a<br>
queryrate of 3.9 words/query, while the second, rpg adf<br>
nbz olx ewv img cyk thj su has a lookup error rate of 115<br>
words/lookup error, and a query rate of 5.2 words/query.<br>
These codes are both significantly inferior to the<br>
example 10-key code which is herein designed for this<br>
task. As neither the United States Patent CITE tegic,<br>
nor EPO patent application CITE epo are enabling with<br>
respect to the construction of the cited ambiguous codes,<br>
nor are the statistics available with respect to which<br>
these codes are optimized (if they are indeed optimized),<br>
we can draw no further conclusions as to the substantial<br>
optimality of these codes.<br>
Another useful comparison is to 9-key codes which<br>
are optimized according to the teachings of this<br>
invention with respect to both lookup error rate and<br>
query rate. We construct, for example, the code am bnz<br>
cfi dhx evw gjr kos luy pgt with lookup error rate 109<br>
words/lookup error and query rate of 6.2 words/query.<br>
Comparing these results, we find that the improvements<br>
which result from the teachings of this embodiment are<br>
from two sources 1) using more than 9 keys to permit the<br>
improvement of lookup error rate and query rate, and 2)<br>
optimizing both with respect to lookup error rate and<br>
with respect to query rate. If the approach taught by<br>
this embodiment to is extended to 11- and 12-key codes,<br>
one finds for example the 11-key code, avy bn cl dhx ew<br>
fip gjo kr mu gt sz with lookup error and query rates of<br>
215 words/lookup error and 10.1 words/query<br>
respectively, and the 12-key code aw bn cky dhq ef go ip<br>
jr lz auc bv tu with lookup error and query rates of 313<br>
words/lookup error and 13.2 words/query respectively.<br>
Thus, by sacrificing the use of the * and # keys for<br>
the encoding of non-letter symbols, we can dramatically<br>
improve lookup error rates, and substantially improve<br>
query rates, bringing the standard-telephone-compatible<br>
keyboards comfortably into the (level B) strongly touch-<br>
typable range. Whether or not these improvements<br>
outweigh the reduction of the ability to encode non-<br>
letter symbols by using * and # keys can only be<br>
decided in reference to the intended uses of the devices<br>
so constructed, it is to be noted that non-letter<br>
symbols could be encoded using sequences of encoding<br>
symbols as described in reference to the smart-card<br>
embodiment specified above. If the * key and # key are<br>
available to encode non-letter symbols, then a<br>
particularly ergonomic scheme, which respects in part the<br>
convention of using the # symbol as an end-of-<br>
transmission symbol is as follows. Let # encode the<br>
space symbol=end-of-word symbol, ## encode. =end-of-<br>
sentence symbol, and ###=end-of- transmission symbol.<br>
In this way the complexity of encoding a symbols varies<br>
inversely with the probability of the symbol. Depending<br>
on the application, sequences of the * symbol could then<br>
be used to encode other non-letter symbols such as<br>
backspace, @ (for electronic mail applications), and/or<br>
be used as a mode changing symbol.<br>
Telephone keypad in alphabetic order This embodiment<br>
presents a solution for a severely constrained keyboard-<br>
design problem in which the number of keys is fixed, the<br>
placement of the keys is fixed, and the ordering of<br>
symbols on these keys is fixed. This problem arises in<br>
the design of a keyboard which 1) preserves as well as<br>
possible the familiar alphabetic ordering of the standard<br>
ambiguous code, 2) is compatible with existing, standard<br>
telephone keypads, and yet 3) has improved lookup error<br>
rate and query rate as compared to the standard ambiguous<br>
code. These constraints allow a limited freedom to choose<br>
the number of keys on which to base the ambiguous code.<br>
One can choose, for example, to allow the ambiguous code<br>
for the letters to occupy 10 keys of the telephone<br>
keypad, leaving the * and # keys available for encoding<br>
non-alphabetic symbols. Also, while the standard<br>
ambiguous code uses an even-as-possible partition, one<br>
may choose an alternate partition and still respect the<br>
given constraints.<br>
Given the constraint of alphabetic ordering, each<br>
ordered partition of 26 elements into 10 groups<br>
corresponds to a unique ambiguous code. Given sufficient<br>
computing time, it would be possible to evaluate the<br>
lookup and query errors of each of these codes, and<br>
choose the best. An alternate and more efficient<br>
procedure is to apply the optimization methods taught by<br>
this invention to this constrained optimization problem.<br>
This invention teaches that a minimal elementary step in<br>
the set of possible codes should be defined, in the<br>
absence of information suggesting the use of some more<br>
complex elementary step. In the current context, an<br>
ambiguous code is a ordered list of 10 groups of letters,<br>
such that all letters occur in exactly one group, and<br>
within and across groups, the letters appear in<br>
alphabetic order. An example is ab cd ef gh ij kl nn opqr<br>
stuv wxyz. There are thus 9 gaps separating the groups.<br>
An elementary step consists of moving one letter across<br>
one gap. For instance, if we choose the second gap, we<br>
can produce in one elementary move either the code abc d<br>
ef gh ij kl on opqr stuv wxyz, by moving the letter c to<br>
the left, or the code a bed ef gh ij kl mn opqr stuv<br>
wxyz, by moving the letter b to the right. Given a<br>
specified code, all possible codes which can be obtained<br>
by one elementary move from the specified code can be<br>
simply generated. Given this observation, and the<br>
specification of the directed random walk method given<br>
above, it will be evident to one skilled in the art how<br>
to apply the optimization methods taught by this<br>
invention in the present context. Applying this method we<br>
find, for example, the code ab cd ef gh ijklm no pqr s tu<br>
vwxyz, with a lookup error rate of 65 words/lookup error<br>
and a query rate of 5.8 words/query. This code is shown<br>
in a preferred arrangement on the keypad of a telephone<br>
in figure 19. The error rates of this code should be<br>
compared to those of standard ambiguous code, with a<br>
lookup error rate of 29 words/lookup error, and a query<br>
rate of 2.2 words/query. Thus the improvement in lookup<br>
error rate is more than a factor of 2, and the<br>
improvement in query rate is nearly a factor of 3, with<br>
no sacrifice of easy-to-scan alphabetic ordering, nor<br>
compatibility with existing telephone equipment. It is<br>
to be appreciated that the the discussion above in<br>
reference to the choice of 11- or 12-key encoding of<br>
letter symbols for a telephone embodiment apply to this<br>
embodiment as well; using optimization over partitions,<br>
substantially optimal codes for 11 and 12 keys can be<br>
produced.<br>
The method of optimization over partitions is<br>
evidently not limited to this embodiment; it could be<br>
applied, for instance, to the smart card embodiment<br>
previously discussed, to produce optimal codes with<br>
alphabetic ordering on an array of 9-16 letter-symbol<br>
bearing keys.<br>
Qwerty-like Keyboards The approach used in the previous<br>
embodiment to generate a keyboard which at once 1) is<br>
compatible with a standard keyboard, and 2) is optimized<br>
with respect to various ergonomic criteria, can be used<br>
to produce keyboards which are 1) similar to the standard<br>
Qwerty keyboard, and 2) are optimized with respect to<br>
various ergonomic criteria. As in the previous embodiment<br>
we will maintain as well as possible the layout of the<br>
standard keyboard by maintaining the ordering of the<br>
assignment of symbols to keys, and yet optimize over<br>
partitions of those ordered symbols so as to minimize<br>
lookup and query rates as well as possible. This<br>
embodiment requires the further restriction that letters<br>
remain in the same row of keys as given by the Qwerty<br>
arrangement.<br>
There exists a sequence of keyboard layouts which<br>
are Qwerty-like in that they have three rows devoted to<br>
letter keys, and variable numbers of columns, from one up<br>
to 10 columns. It is clear that with but one column, that<br>
is, but three keys, lookup and query rates must be very<br>
high, and there is but one possible ambiguous code which<br>
corresponds to the ordering of symbols of the Qwerty<br>
keyboard. This code is qwertyuiop asdfghjkl zxcvbnm with<br>
a lookup error rate of 2.8 words/lookup error, and a<br>
query rate of 1.1 words/query, a code of such poor<br>
quality that it is unlikely to be acceptable for any<br>
serious use. As the number of columns increases, we are<br>
able to find better and better ambiguous codes. At the<br>
same time, as the number of columns increases, the device<br>
size required to contain the keyboard, maintaining<br>
substantially full-sized keys, increases as well. Thus<br>
design of Qwerty-like keyboards must be a compromise<br>
between code ambiguity and keyboard size. If, for<br>
example, we wish to build a keyboard which is Qwerty-like<br>
and substantially the same size as a pocket calculator<br>
yet using full-sized keys, 7 columns can be used, as<br>
shown in figure 20. A strongly touch-typable code,<br>
substantially optimal with respect to lookup error and<br>
query rates is qwe rtyuiopasdfg hjk 1 zxc vb n<br>
m with lookup error every 668 words, and query every<br>
35.5 words, clearly strongly touch typable with respect<br>
to a large class of typists and keyboard uses. In<br>
figure 20 this code is shown in a preferred arrangement.<br>
A typable device with a keyboard as described in this<br>
figure would be suitable for note-taking, composing<br>
electronic mail, and the like. It would be readily<br>
typable with no or minimal learning by anyone familiar<br>
with the standard Qwerty keyboard, and, even built with<br>
full-sized keys, it would fit easily into a pocket.<br>
It. is to be noted that in terms of lookup and query<br>
rates, the cost of adhering to the Qwerty convention is<br>
high, even when the convention is adhered to but<br>
approximately. In the code given above 17 keys are<br>
devoted to letter symbols. If we now allow for<br>
arbitrary assignments of letters to 17 keys, we find<br>
codes such as w r t bu gi ov p af s d ej ky 1 hz ex n mq<br>
with a lookup error rate of 7483 words/lookup error, and<br>
a query rate of 2 90 words/query. This is equivalent to<br>
one lookup error every 30 pages of typed text, and less<br>
than one query per page of typed text. It is difficult to<br>
imagine a use with respect to which this keyboard would<br>
not be strongly touch typable.<br>
With reference to figure 21, we see that this code<br>
can be laid out in such a way that 18 letters at or very<br>
close to their Qwerty positions, these letters are<br>
indicated in bold face. In this arrangement, to maximize<br>
the similarity of typing motions between typing on the<br>
Qwerty keyboard and on this optimized Qwerty-like<br>
keyboard, the fingers should be placed on the home row<br>
such that the index finger of the left hand is on the<br>
(space) key and the index finger of the right hand is on<br>
the (ej) key. Notably by bringing both the space key and<br>
the 'e1 to the home row, this layout makes a step from<br>
the Qwerty layout in the direction of anatomic fidelity,<br>
in that the weight on the home row is increased relative<br>
to Qwerty, and the weight on the strongest fingers is<br>
increased relative to the Qwerty weight. By suitable<br>
assignments of symbols to keys, any ambiguous code can be<br>
brought into optimal coherence with the Qwerty (or other<br>
convent ional) keyboard.<br>
It is to be noted that by allowing some departure<br>
from strict Qwerty ordering, a very substantial gain has<br>
been made in terms of functional Qwerty similarity. When<br>
the rows are slightly displaced relative to one another,<br>
such as they are in the standard Qwerty layout, much or<br>
most of the finger motion required to operate the various<br>
keys of this Qwerty-like keyboard is the same or similar<br>
to the finger motion required to operate the standard<br>
Qwerty keyboard. This illustrates a tradeoff between the<br>
ergonomic criteria of preservation of a conventional<br>
ordering, and the ergonomic criterion of preservation of<br>
conventional function.<br>
In view of the many competing criteria which might<br>
be optimized, and the variety of user populations and<br>
their needs, it would be motivated in practical<br>
implementations of such devices to allow users the choice<br>
between the optimized Qwerty-like keyboard and other<br>
corresponding keyboards optimized or optimized as well<br>
with respect to a selection of other ergonomic criteria,<br>
such as lookup and query rates. This choice would be<br>
facilitated if the labelling of the keys could be changed<br>
in software. This object could be attained if each key<br>
were equipped with a display means capable of displaying<br>
at least one symbol at a time. Such display means could<br>
for instance comprise an light-emitting diode array, or a<br>
liquid-crystal display, etc.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art<br>
that the keyboard design method used to prepare the<br>
present embodiment could be applied to the preservation<br>
or partial preservation of other conventional keyboard<br>
designs, such as the Azerty keyboard used in France.<br>
Numeric Keypad-like Keyboards This embodiment has the<br>
object of making the advantages of an ambiguous keyboards<br>
available to most computer users, with minimal cost and<br>
with no change in their existing hardware. These<br>
advantages notably include the advantage of one-hand<br>
typability, and the advantage of potential compatibility<br>
with ambiguous keyboards designed for hand-held devices.<br>
Standard 101-key keyboards for workstations and personal<br>
computers include a numeric keypad, typically to the<br>
right of the part of the keyboard laid out in a Qwerty<br>
arrangement. Typically, there is included a set of arrow<br>
keys, or other input means effective for moving the<br>
cursor, near the numeric keypad.<br>
Referring now to figure 22 we present an ambiguous<br>
code optimized for a common numeric keypad layout 600<br>
taken together with the means for moving the cursor 601<br>
where such is available. Said numeric keypad 600 has in<br>
this example 17 keys of various sizes. Depending on other<br>
design constraints, some or all of these keys could be<br>
used for punctuation, or other symbols, and these other<br>
design constraints could influence the choice of the<br>
number of keys to be assigned to letters, the<br>
distribution of letters and other symbols over modes and<br>
so on. The essential features of this embodiment are:<br>
• • assignment of an ambiguous code to a plurality<br>
of keys in the numeric keypad<br>
• optional use of the thumb-actuatable auxiliary<br>
input means to change modes.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art<br>
that said assignment of an ambiguous code to a plurality<br>
of keys in the ambiguous keypad can be achieved in<br>
software; there is no need for special-purpose hardware.<br>
However, if it is desired to have the keys thus assigned<br>
be labelled with the elements of the ambiguous code, then<br>
some modification of the keyboard labelling may be<br>
required. To give a concrete example of the use of an<br>
ambiguous code in this setting, we choose an ambiguous<br>
code in which letters are assigned to 17 keys in such a<br>
way as to minimize lookup error and query rate, with<br>
respect to our standard corpus. The code illustrated in<br>
figure 22 af bu ex d ej gi hz ky 1 mg n ov p r s t w<br>
has a lookup error rate of 7483 words/lookup error, and a<br>
query rate of 290 words/query. This same code has already<br>
been discussed above. Here the code is laid out in such<br>
a way as to preserve in part an alphabetic ordered. The<br>
given code has not been optimized relative to alphabetic<br>
ordering; it has only been optimized with respect to<br>
lookup error rate and query rate. According to the<br>
teachings of this invention, it would be possible to<br>
simultaneously optimize with respect to lookup error<br>
rate, query rate, alphabetic ordering, and/or other<br>
ergonomic criteria.<br>
To illustrate the use of the thumb-actuated<br>
auxiliary input means for mode changing, we refer again<br>
to figure 22. We assume for the sake of this<br>
illustration that the auxiliary input means is comprised<br>
of 4 keys: up 602, down 603, left 604, and right 605<br>
arrow keys. These functionalities are typically<br>
implemented with 4 depressible keys, but they are<br>
sometimes implemented as a touchpad, a joystick, or some<br>
other device capable of generating multiple, different<br>
signals as a function of manipulation by the user. It is<br>
to be noted that in figure 22 a plurality of keys are<br>
labeled with symbols other than those of the ambiguous<br>
code, in this case digits. These other symbols can be<br>
obtained by depressing a specified one of the four keys<br>
of the auxiliary input means. A possible assignment of<br>
modes to input means in the auxiliary keypad is<br>
• 602(up) Shift key for upper case letters.<br>
• 603 (down) numeric/punctuation mode.<br>
• 604 (left) left symbol on key.<br>
• 605 (right) right symbol on key.<br>
It will be appreciated that 1) other assignments of<br>
modes and/or symbols to the auxiliary keypad are<br>
possible, and in accordance with the teachings of this<br>
invention, and 2) with a more complex set of auxiliary-<br>
input means, additional modes and symbols can be assigned<br>
to the auxiliary input means. Assignment of symbols to<br>
modes will be discussed in more detail in reference to<br>
another embodiment. That discussion is applicable to<br>
other embodiments, including this embodiment.<br>
Objects and advantages of 13-letter-key codes Several<br>
related embodiments of the teachings of this invention<br>
exploit the surprising benefits of optimizing<br>
ambiguous codes for keyboards in which the number of keys<br>
devoted to strongly correlated symbols is substantially<br>
half of the number of strongly correlated symbols. In<br>
particular, if we take the set of strongly correlated<br>
symbols as the set of letters [a-z] used in English, then<br>
the preferred number of keys is 13. The surprising<br>
benefits of a 13-letter-key code for English include:<br>
• strong touch-typability,<br>
• ergonomic, touch-typable, unambiguous text<br>
entry.<br>
• ergonomic, touch-typable, querying.<br>
• compatibility with standard keyboard layouts<br>
(Qwerty keypad, numeric keypad, and telephone<br>
keypad),<br>
• providing for conservation of typing skills<br>
from 1- to 2-handed typing,<br>
• providing for an integrated mouse/keyboard.<br>
• providing a mechanism to reduce typing<br>
injuries.<br>
Further objects and advantages will become clear in<br>
detailed specification below, which takes up in turn each<br>
of the above-listed objects and advantages.<br>
Strong touch typability Referring again to figures 11<br>
and 12, we see that with respect to word-based<br>
disambiguation, ambiguous codes on 13 keys can be found<br>
which are strongly touch typable, even for an<br>
accomplished typist. Using the directed-random-walk<br>
method described above, we find, for instance, the code<br>
aw ba ck du ef go hv ip js lynx qt rz with a lookup<br>
error rate of 515 words/lookup error, and a query rate of<br>
21 words/query, (level C) strong touch typability. This<br>
code is shown in a preferred arrangement in figure 25.<br>
As discussed above, this query rate can be reduced<br>
further by adjustment of a parameter which controls how<br>
important queries must be to require user attention. In<br>
the limit where querying is turned off entirely, the<br>
lookup error rate controls touch typability. With this<br>
code, lookup errors will occur on average approximately<br>
once every two pages of typed text, that is to say, at a<br>
rate much less than the rate of typing errors of even<br>
very skilled typists. Thus, 13-key codes exist which are<br>
suitable for a wide range of touch typing tasks, for a<br>
wide range of users.<br>
Ergonamlc, touch-typable unambiguous text entry With<br>
any ambiguous keyboard, and any disambiguation mechanism,<br>
it may be advantageous to provide a mechanism by which it<br>
is possible to enter information in an unambiguous<br>
manner, for instance, to add information to the<br>
disambiguation database. For all uses of ambiguous<br>
keyboards it is advantageous for the unambiguous text<br>
entry mechanism to be as ergonomic as possible, ergonomic<br>
meaning in this case simple to operate. For ambiguous<br>
keyboards meant to be touch typed, it is advantageous if,<br>
further, the keyboard can be operated in unambiguous<br>
text-entry mode in a touch-typable manner.<br>
One strategy often employed in the prior art to<br>
achieve unambiguous text entry using a small number of<br>
keys is to use a chording method. In satisfying their<br>
urge to maximally reduce the number of keys, chording<br>
keyboard designers have consistently taught away from<br>
providing a sufficient number of keys that chording<br>
patterns can be kept simple. By an elementary<br>
combinatorial argument, the number of keys cannot be less<br>
than 1/2 the number of symbols to be encoded if the<br>
complexity of a chord is never more than 2, that is, if<br>
it is never required to active more than 2 input means<br>
substantially simultaneously in order to unambiguously<br>
encode a symbol. The present invention teaches, by<br>
contrast to the prior art, to provide a number of keys no<br>
less than 1/2 the number of symbols to be encoded, if a<br>
simple mechanism for unambiguous encoding of those<br>
symbols is to be provided. In particular, the present<br>
invention teaches to provide at least 13 keys to<br>
represent the letters [a-z], and at least one mode<br>
changing key, which when active in combination with one<br>
of the keys encoding letters serves to uniquely and<br>
unambiguously encoding one of the letters associated to<br>
said key encoding letters.<br>
In an ambiguous keyboard, some keys represent a<br>
plurality of symbols with a single keystroke. To use the<br>
same keyboard in an unambiguous mode, said single<br>
keystroke must be combined with at least one other<br>
keystroke, perhaps of the same key, to permit each<br>
individual symbol associated to the key to be singled<br>
out. For ergonomics, it is preferable that said<br>
combination of keystrokes be as simple as possible, and<br>
for a touch typability, it is preferable that<br>
substantially the same combination of strokes is used for<br>
unambiguous entry of all symbols. These two criteria are<br>
best satisfied if l) the same number of symbols is<br>
associated with each ambiguous key, and 2) the number of<br>
symbols on each ambiguous key is small. Taken together,<br>
these criteria imply that the preferred number of keys<br>
for an ambiguous code which is to be touch typed is one-<br>
half of the number of symbols to be represented<br>
ambiguously. And, in the case where the symbols to be<br>
represented are the 2 6 letters in the alphabet, the<br>
criteria taken together imply that 13 keys are preferred.<br>
One way this observation can be exploited to produce<br>
an ergonomic, touch-typable ambiguous keyboard with an<br>
ergonomic, touch-typable unambiguous text entry mode is<br>
described in reference to figure 23, and in reference to<br>
the case of ambiguous representation of the letters of<br>
the English alphabet with 13 keys. In this figure, each<br>
of the subset of keys used to ambiguously represent the<br>
letters 700, encodes exactly two letters. The typable<br>
device further comprises a mode key 701 and a means for<br>
placing the device in either ambiguous or unambiguous<br>
text-entry mode. The means for placing the typable<br>
device in ambiguous or unambiguous text-entry mode could<br>
be a software means which detects, depending on context,<br>
which of these modes is required at any given instant, or<br>
a key devoted to this mode change, or a particular<br>
pattern of input on other input means, such as a double<br>
tap on the mode-changing key 701. When in unambiguous<br>
text-entry mode, activation of the 701 key causes one a<br>
selected symbol from the two symbols associated with a<br>
key in the plurality 700 to be encoded when said key in<br>
the plurality 700 is activated substantially<br>
simultaneously with the 701 key. It is preferable to<br>
think of the pair of symbols on each key in the plurality<br>
700 to be composed of a left symbol and a right symbol,<br>
and to label the keys with the left symbol on the left<br>
and the right symbol on the right. Then one of these,<br>
without loss of generality, the left of these, is<br>
associated with activation of the 701 key whereby<br>
unambiguous text entry can be achieved. When a key in the<br>
plurality 700 is activated in combination with the 701<br>
key, the left symbol is selected unambiguously, and if<br>
the same key in the plurality 700 is activated without<br>
the 701 key being substantially simultaneously activated,<br>
then the right symbol is selected unambiguously. If the<br>
keyboard is designed to incorporate additional modes,<br>
then this same method of unambiguous text entry could be<br>
used also in reference to the symbols in the other modes.<br>
Touch-typing oriented querying Even with an optimal<br>
ambiguous code, coupled to unlimited computing power and<br>
ultimate, yet-to-be discovered artificial-intelligence<br>
techniques for disambiguation, some ambiguous sequences<br>
may be generated in the course of typing a text which<br>
require intervention of a human operator to effect full<br>
disambiguation.<br>
True touch-typists type without looking at the<br>
keyboard, keeping their eyes focused on the text being<br>
produced, or the copy being transcribed. For the touch<br>
typists, then, it is preferable to have all querying for<br>
alternate interpretations of ambiguous sequences done in<br>
such a way that 1) their eyes are not diverted from the<br>
text-display screen and 2) queries can be answered in a<br>
simple, stereotypical manner from the keyboard. These<br>
objects can be accomplished by reserving a key for<br>
advancing in a list of candidate words, and highlighting<br>
the ambiguous word on the screen. Users scroll through<br>
the list of candidate words using this scroll key, and as<br>
soon as a key other than the "scroll" key is pressed, the<br>
word in the scroll box is considered selected.<br>
With reference to 23 and 24, we explain in detail<br>
the software underlying touch-typing-oriented querying,<br>
and the visual display it controls. In the first step 800<br>
a query has been detected, that is, the disambiguation<br>
mechanism has discovered that more than one meaningful<br>
decoding sequence in the database corresponds to the<br>
input encoding sequence. Entrance in the query mode<br>
causes a means to draw the users attention to the<br>
decoding under query to be display. These means could be<br>
visual means such as the framebox 702 shown in figure 23.<br>
The possible decodings are then ordered according to<br>
their likelihood (step 802). Then, (step 804) the most-<br>
likely decoding is displayed on the screen, in context<br>
with the text previously entered, in a place indicated by<br>
the attention means. The software is then prepared to<br>
detect either input from the scroll key, or some other<br>
key (step 806). If some input is received from some other<br>
key, then the means to draw attention to the user is<br>
removed (step 808), the decoding is added to the text<br>
previously entered (step 810), and ambiguous text entry<br>
mode is reentered.<br>
On the other hand, if input from the scroll key is<br>
detected at step 806, then a test is performed to see if<br>
there exists any other meaningful decodings in the data<br>
base 812. If there is, the current decoding is replaced<br>
with the next most probable decoding (step 814), and step<br>
806 is returned to. If there is no next-most-probable<br>
decoding, then, preferably, the typable device enters<br>
unambiguous text entry mode as described above (step<br>
816), when the decoding sequence has been unambiguously<br>
entered, the means to draw attention to the user is<br>
removed (step 808), the unambiguously entered decoding is<br>
added to the existing text (step 810) and ambiguous text<br>
entry mode is reentered (step 818).<br>
While this method for in situ presentation of<br>
alternatives has been presented in terms of touch-typing-<br>
oriented querying, it will be appreciated that the same<br>
method could be applied in other contexts, such as when<br>
the "decodings" are words with related meanings, and the<br>
database is a thesaurus, or when the "decodings" are<br>
various possible translations of a word into a foreign<br>
language, and the probabilities of the decodings are<br>
supplied by an automatic translation program.<br>
Conservation of design across platforms as an ergonomic<br>
criterion: a mouse/keyboard Consider a user of a small<br>
typable device equipped with a one-handed touch-typable<br>
keyboard, such as a personal digital assistant. In the<br>
course of a typical day, the user might also type on his<br>
or her desktop computer equipped with a two-handed<br>
keyboard. If both of these devices are to be effectively<br>
touch typable for that user, the motor patterns used in<br>
the one- and two-handed keyboards must be as similar as<br>
possible. The shorter the interval between the uses of<br>
the two keyboards, the stronger the requirement for<br>
conservation of typing skills. To sharply draw the object<br>
of conservation of typing skills across platforms, and<br>
the means by which this invention achieves this object,<br>
we now turn to an embodiment in which 1- and 2-handed<br>
keyboards may be used in rapid alteration.<br>
This embodiment concerns a one-handed keyboard<br>
suitable for entry of data into forms, such as<br>
spreadsheets or web-based forms. It will be of use for<br>
interaction with a program, such as a game or a drawing<br>
program, 1) which requires quick alternation of typing<br>
and cursor movement, and/or 2) where the symbol set which<br>
is appropriate for entry may vary depending on where the<br>
cursor is on the screen. Using the standard computing<br>
configuration of a Qwerty keyboard and a mouse, users<br>
must remove their hands from the keyboard to move the<br>
mouse. In tasks which involve both typing and mouse<br>
manipulation in rapid succession, such as labeling a<br>
design presented on the computer screen, or filling in a<br>
form, such as an HTML form, this alternating use of mouse<br>
and keyboard can be quite slow and laborious. In this<br>
embodiment, a one-handed keyboard is mounted in a frame<br>
which may be moved over a surface and thus perform the<br>
functions of a mouse as well as a keyboard. Since users<br>
may prefer to use a two-handed keyboard for predominantly<br>
text-entry tasks, and intermix usage of the one-handed<br>
keyboard with use of the one-handed keyboard, it is<br>
desirable to have the layout of keys on both keyboards be<br>
as similar as possible, so as to permit seamless transfer<br>
of touch-typing skills from the two-handed to the one-<br>
handed keyboard.<br>
Referring now to figures 25, 28 and 26, we see how<br>
this object can be attained by the choice of an ambiguous<br>
code which is such that it can be laid out on the one-<br>
handed keyboard so that the movements of the fingers and<br>
the thumb of one hand (in this case the right hand) are<br>
the same, whether that hand is typing on the one-handed<br>
or two-handed keyboard, and that, further, the typing<br>
movements of the other hand are similar to the movements<br>
of the hand chosen for one handed typing.<br>
The design strategy is as follows:<br>
• Choose a 13-key code with substantially minimal<br>
lookup error rate and query rate.<br>
• Choose a physical layout for the 13 keys. A<br>
layout with 5 keys in the top row, 5 keys in<br>
the middle (home) row, and 3 keys in the bottom<br>
row is a preferred arrangement.<br>
• Choose which hand will actuate the one-handed<br>
keyboard.<br>
• Arrange the keys such that, in the one-handed<br>
layout, and relative to the hand chosen in the<br>
previous step: where<br>
- weight on the home row is maximized.<br>
- weight on the strongest fingers is<br>
maximized.<br>
- weight on the top row is higher then<br>
weight on the bottom row.<br>
• Then, to obtain a layout for the two-handed<br>
keyboard, pair each key actuated with the left-<br>
hand to a key actuated by the right hand.<br>
Preferably, the pairing is done so that members<br>
of the pair are laid out symmetrically, with<br>
respect to a symmetry plane which cuts the<br>
keyboard at the center, and runs from the<br>
bottom to the top of the keyboard.<br>
• Of the two symbols associated to each of the 13<br>
original keys, associate one symbol to one of<br>
the keys in each pair chosen in the previous<br>
step. This can be done in a way favoring the<br>
one-handed keyboard, or in a way favoring the<br>
related two-handed keyboard.<br>
- If favoring the one-handed keyboard:<br>
retain the higher-probability letter<br>
on the chosen-hand side of the two-<br>
handed keyboard, and place the lower-<br>
probability letter on the opposite<br>
side of the keyboard.<br>
 If favoring the two-handed keyboard:<br>
for each of the 13 keys, choose to<br>
place either the lower or the higher<br>
probability letter on a given side of<br>
the two-handed keyboard so that the<br>
summed probability on each half of<br>
the keyboard is as equal as possible.<br>
Beginning with the 13-key code selected to<br>
illustrate the teachings of this embodiment, and choosing<br>
to favor the right hand, one constructs the keyboard<br>
layout described in figure 25. When this one-handed<br>
keyboard is expressed as a two-handed keyboard, the<br>
resulting layout is shown in figure 26. On this<br>
keyboard, the right hand types approximately 84 percent<br>
of the letters, while the left hand types approximately<br>
16 percent of the letters. This asymmetry is desirable<br>
in that the large majority of keystrokes will be<br>
performed in exactly the same manner whether the one-<br>
handed or the two-handed keyboard is used.<br>
Conversely, if most typing is done with a two-handed<br>
keyboard, and only occasionally with a one-handed<br>
keyboard, it may be desirable to have as even as possible<br>
weight on the two hands when used to operate the two-<br>
handed keyboard. This object can be achieved with an<br>
alternate layout of the two-handed keyboard as shown in<br>
figure 27. It will be appreciated that substantially 50<br>
percent of the typing motions used in typing on the two-<br>
handed version of this keyboard are the same as the<br>
typing motions used on the one-handed keyboard, whether<br>
the one-handed keyboard is typed with the right or the<br>
left hand.<br>
It will be appreciated that for a 13-key ambiguous<br>
code there are 213 different ways of pairing homologous<br>
left- and right-hand keys of a two-handed keyboard. This<br>
number is small enough that the symmetry of the weights<br>
assigned to the two hands in each set of pairings can be<br>
evaluated, and depending on whether a most-symmetric or<br>
most-asymmetric weighting is desired, or some<br>
intermediate value, the appropriate assignment can be<br>
selected.<br>
Referring now to figure 28, a detailed view of the<br>
one-handed keyboard, we see how the objects of this<br>
embodiment are achieved by equipping the keyboard with a<br>
plurality of keys 300, a thumb-actuatable input means<br>
301, mouse keys 302, a palm grip 303, and a display 304.<br>
The keyboard may be further equipped with a communication<br>
means to enable symbol selections by means of the<br>
keyboard to be communicated to the computer. This<br>
communication means could be simply a wire, or a wireless<br>
communication means such as an infrared communication<br>
means. The keyboard is slidably supported on a support<br>
means, such as a desktop, whereby the keyboard can be<br>
moved over the support means by means of pressure from<br>
the base of the palm of the hand actuating the keyboard.<br>
The keyboard is preferably equipped with a means for palm<br>
grip means for engaging said base of the palm to allow<br>
said pressure to be effective in moving the keyboard.<br>
Said means for engaging said base of palm of the hand<br>
operating the keyboard are preferably formed means where<br>
the form is such that slight pressure is effective to<br>
move the keyboard in any desired direction. For instance,<br>
the form could be an indentation in the body of the<br>
keyboard which securely engages the base of the palm. By<br>
moving the keyboard in this way, the fingers of the hand<br>
actuating the keyboard are free to move in a way<br>
effective to actuate the keys, even while the keyboard is<br>
in motion. Thus this keyboard can be used in situations,<br>
such as for playing computer games, in which motion needs<br>
to be simultaneously input along with symbol sequences<br>
such as text.<br>
It is to be noted that while this device performs<br>
the functions of a mouse, it bears little physical<br>
similarity to a mouse. Its form factor is determined by<br>
the anatomy of the hand in a comfortable position for<br>
touch typing. The device must therefore be considerably<br>
larger than a standard mouse, and the means for moving<br>
the device substantially different.<br>
To communicate motion of the keyboard 305 to the<br>
computer, said keyboard is equipped with a motion sensing<br>
means, such as a trackball, familiar to those skilled in<br>
the art. Preferably, the keyboard 305 can be further<br>
equipped with a biasing means, such as springs, to lift<br>
the keyboard away from the support means when the weight<br>
of the hand on the keyboard is lessened, thus<br>
facilitating movement. In contradistinction, when the<br>
substantially full weight of the hand is applied to the<br>
keyboard, the keyboard remains relatively stably fixed to<br>
the support means whereby typing is facilitated.<br>
The two-handed keyboard may thereby be used for long<br>
typing episodes, uninterrupted by the need to move a<br>
mouse, and the one-handed keyboard for quick typing/mouse<br>
movement alternation.<br>
Visual Representation of the Keyboard It will be<br>
appreciated that when using a single device which<br>
supports more than one ambiguous codes, or more than one<br>
mode, it may be helpful to the user to have a<br>
representation of the current association of keys with<br>
symbols at any given moment displayed on the displayed<br>
device. While such a representation could be of value<br>
for any typable device, it is of particular utility for<br>
touch-typable devices, since for such devices, some or<br>
all of the keys are hidden from view (typically by the<br>
fingers of the operator) while in use. Thus, any display<br>
means integrated into the keys is of limited utility for<br>
the touch typist. The most useful visual representations<br>
are those in which the physical layout of the keyboard is<br>
represented in the visual display. Such a device 304 is<br>
shown in figure 28, but could be incorporated in many of<br>
the embodiments described in this disclosure.<br>
Reduction of typing injury Typing injuries (repetitive<br>
stress syndrome) afflict many keyboard users. Numerous<br>
keyboards have been designed in an attempt to attenuate<br>
the stress of the repetitive motions involved in typing.<br>
It has long been recognized that the most effective means<br>
to reduce typing injuries is for the typist to take<br>
regular breaks from typing. This is seldom practical,<br>
however, as typists are often under time pressure to<br>
complete their typing work. The one-handed keyboard just<br>
described offers a solution to this problem. While the<br>
one-handed version of the present embodiment has been<br>
described as being used with the right hand, it is<br>
evident that the same design methods lead to a left-<br>
handed one-hand keyboard as well. Each of these<br>
keyboards is capable of encoding all of the same symbols.<br>
A therapeutic typable device equipped with both a right-<br>
handed and a left-handed keyboard, such as both a left-<br>
and a right-handed mouse/keyboard as described above,<br>
could be operated with either the left or the right hand<br>
in alteration. With such a pair of keyboards, a user<br>
wishing to reduce repetitive-stress injuries could type<br>
for some period of time, for instance, for 15 minutes,<br>
using one of the keyboards, and then switch for the next<br>
period of time to the other keyboard, whereby the user<br>
gives each hand a resting period, with no decrement to<br>
typing productivity. If desired, the typable device could<br>
be equipped with a locking means which would alternately<br>
lock one or the other of the keyboards, enforcing<br>
alternating use. It is to be appreciated that when<br>
therapy is completed, the user could return to a two-<br>
handed version of the keyboard, with no relearning of<br>
typing skills required.<br>
Foldable PDA We saw in the smart-card embodiment<br>
described above that it is convenient and ergonomic to<br>
place the text screen of a typable device based on<br>
ambiguous codes in such a way that part of the keyboard<br>
is manipulated by the fingers of one or both hands and<br>
the thumb may be used to actuate further input means, in<br>
particular, mode-changing input means, in the region<br>
above the thumb or thumbs and to the side of the finger-<br>
manipulated part of the keyboard. The present embodiment<br>
concerns a typable device at a somewhat larger scale<br>
which uses the same concept in conjunction with a folding<br>
concept in order to design a twice-foldable information<br>
appliance which may ergonomically perform different<br>
functions when it is unfolded, once folded, and twice<br>
folded.<br>
This twice-foldable design is a surprising<br>
consequence of ambiguous codes. It is remarkable that<br>
typable devices built by the methods taught by the<br>
present invention permit keyboards which are at once 1)<br>
effective for the coding of natural language, 2) use<br>
substantially full-size keys, and 3) are small enough to<br>
be placed in a pocket or a small hand bag. This<br>
embodiment is based on building a hand-held computing<br>
device from substantially same-sized elementary units<br>
which are the size of a keyboard designed for an<br>
ambiguous code, said units being configurable in a<br>
variety of ways depending on the instant needs of a user.<br>
The elementary units can be foldably and/or detachably<br>
connected to each other in each of a variety of<br>
configurations. In this way the computing device can<br>
alternately play the role of a laptop computer, a<br>
personal digital assistant, a telephone, a gaming device,<br>
and so on.<br>
With reference first to figure 29 we specify in<br>
detail a twice-foldable computer built from four<br>
substantially same-sized parts, each of which is adapted<br>
to perform a specified function and are connected to each<br>
other in a foldable and/or detachable way. Figure 29<br>
shows such a device in the unfolded state. It is thus<br>
revealed that one of the parts 900 has a first surface<br>
which functions as a first visual display, while 901 has<br>
a first surface which functions as a first keyboard and<br>
902 has a first surface which functions as a second<br>
keyboard. Preferably, the keyboard layout on said first<br>
and second keyboards is a 13-letter-key keyboard, though<br>
many other choices are possible. The final part 903 has a<br>
first surface which functions as a pair of mode-changing<br>
thumb switches, to be used in combination with the said<br>
first and second keyboards. The first keyboard is meant<br>
to be operated with the right hand. It will be evident -<br>
to those skilled in the art that a similar configuration<br>
exists which is typable with the left hand, and that this<br>
similar configuration can be obtained by simple<br>
rearrangement and reattachment of the four parts. Indeed,<br>
a two-handed keyboard can be obtained from by detachment<br>
and rearrangement of the four units as shown in<br>
figure 33.<br>
Figure 30 shows the unfolded twice-foldable computer<br>
in a bottom view. Part 904 is a telephone keypad 905 and<br>
corresponding second visual display 906. Part 907 is a<br>
third visual display, and part 908 a third keyboard.<br>
Parts 904, 905, 906, 907 form the second surfaces of<br>
parts 900, 901, 902, 903 respectively.<br>
Folding the computer along the line 908 shown in<br>
figures 29 and 30 we obtain the configuration shown in<br>
figure 31. In this configuration the third keyboard is<br>
exposed for typing, and the third visual display is used<br>
as the corresponding display. Here the keyboard layout<br>
is a 12-key keyboard, but many other choices are<br>
possible. This configuration might be used when, due to<br>
time or space limitations, the user is unable or<br>
unwilling to open the computer to its full extent. It<br>
might also be used to supply a different functionality<br>
than the fully unfolded computer, such as a gaming<br>
functionality.<br>
Finally, the computer can be folded along the fold<br>
909 shown in figure 31 to provide the twice-folded<br>
configuration shown in figure 32. This is the<br>
configuration in which the computer would be typically<br>
kept for transportation; in this configuration the device<br>
could be small enough to fit into a pocket. Further, in<br>
this twice-folded configuration the telephone<br>
functionality is exposed for use. For many users, this<br>
will be the most frequently used configuration of the<br>
device. It will be noted that we have shown the telephone<br>
keypad with the ambiguous code of a previous embodiment,<br>
though many other choices are possible.<br>
To recapitulate: thanks to ambiguous codes, we can<br>
design a portable communication and computing device<br>
which functions alternately as a telephone, a personal<br>
digital assistant, and a laptop computer.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art<br>
that if each of the elementary units, including the<br>
keyboard units, are built from touch-screens, then the<br>
variety of configurations and uses of this device could<br>
be further increased. What would be lost, however, is the<br>
tactile feedback from the keyboards built from standard,<br>
depressable keys. Many other variants are possible,<br>
consistent with the teachings of the present invention.<br>
Software embodiment for a typable device comprising a<br>
touchscreen This invention permits software as well as<br>
hardware embodiments. In particular, the methods of the<br>
present invention can be used to design typable<br>
mechanisms for devices comprising touch screens, such as<br>
the series of personal digital assistants built by the<br>
3Com corporation and sold under the trademark PALM PILOT,<br>
as well as other trademarks, For the sake of<br>
illustration, we will focus on the PALM PILOT class of<br>
devices, which includes hand-held computers capable or<br>
running a variety of applications programs, though the<br>
methods herein described could be applied to any typable<br>
device comprising a touch screen.<br>
In reference to figure 34, we note that devices of<br>
the PALM PILOT class typically comprise: a touch screen<br>
1000, a touch-sensitive region 1001 which is used for<br>
entering characters via hand-writing recognition<br>
software. Said touch-sensitive region may be a subregion<br>
of the touch screen, or may be implemented separately.<br>
One of the essential and surprising features of the<br>
present embodiment is that by use of a touch-typable<br>
keyboard in a device comprising a touch screen, we design<br>
a radically new user interface for information appliances<br>
such that keyboards need not compete for limited screen<br>
space with applications programs. The same touch screen<br>
area can be used both for the application program and for<br>
the keyboard.<br>
The crucial observation is that if the keyboard is<br>
weakly touch typable, then the keyboard does not need to<br>
be displayed to the user to be operative. The user's<br>
fingers "know" where the keys are, without visual<br>
referents. Thus, the keyboard can be used to enter data<br>
into which ever application program is currently-<br>
displayed on the touchscreen. If, further, the keyboard<br>
is strongly touch typable, then the keyboard can be used<br>
to produce high quality text, even if no screen space is<br>
used for querying feedback to the user.<br>
With reference to figures 34 and 35, some of the<br>
particular features of the PALM PILOT class of devices<br>
which are accounted for in the present embodiment are:<br>
• The ability of the touch screen 1000 to easily<br>
present alternate keyboard layouts.<br>
• The ability of a touch screen to present images<br>
of different levels of intensity and/or in<br>
different colors.<br>
• The placement of the region for entering<br>
characters 1001 at some remove from the touch<br>
screen, or in a non-central region of the touch<br>
screen.<br>
• The use of the personal digital assistant to<br>
run a variety of programs, such as scheduling<br>
programs or address-book programs, which may<br>
compete for space on the touch screen with a<br>
keyboard.<br>
The ability of touch screens to easily present<br>
alternate keyboard layouts is used in this embodiment to<br>
enable a given input means to represent many different<br>
symbols or groups of symbols, depending on the "mode" of<br>
the keyboard at any given time. When a touch screen is<br>
used to embody a keyboard, each input means is associated<br>
with a specified region of the touch screen. The dual<br>
function of the touch screen as a visual display and as a<br>
plurality of mechanically activated input means is<br>
exploited to give each input means different functions<br>
and different labels depending on mode. It will be<br>
appreciated, however, that the same effect could be<br>
obtained with mechanical keys of a traditional,<br>
depressable structure by equipping each mechanical key<br>
with its own display device. In this way, the methods<br>
for mode changing here specified in reference to a<br>
touchscreen comprising device could be applied to devices<br>
comprising mechanical keys, such as many of the other<br>
devices specified in the present disclosure.<br>
Mode Selection One strategy in keyboard design to<br>
increase the number of symbols which can be encoded given<br>
a fixed number of keys is to augment the keyboard with a<br>
number of mode-changing keys. Pressing a mode-changing<br>
key changes the symbol encoded by a plurality of other<br>
keys. The canonical example is the shift key of the<br>
standard typewriter keyboard which changes the symbol<br>
encoded by the letter keys from lower case to upper case.<br>
Upper-case letters could in principle be encoded on a<br>
separate set of keys from the keys encoding lower-case<br>
letters, and if upper-case letters occurred with the<br>
same frequency as lower-case letters in typical<br>
communications, then this could be a defensible choice.<br>
Also in principle, having upper- and lower-case letters<br>
accessible in different modes does not imply that an<br>
upper-case letter must be assigned to the same key as the<br>
corresponding lower-case letter. The same-key assignment<br>
is chosen in practice because there are strong<br>
conventional, conceptual and statistical relationships<br>
between lower- and upper-case letters.<br>
Thus there are three principles which guide the<br>
assignment of symbols to modes and of symbols to keys<br>
within modes: adherence to statistical relationships,<br>
adherence to conventional relationships, and adherence to<br>
conceptual relationships between symbols. In the design<br>
of typable devices employing ambiguous codes the problems<br>
associated with the design of modes are particularly<br>
acute since a plurality of keys must already carry the<br>
burden of encoding more than one letter symbol on each<br>
key, and the number of keys available to encode symbols<br>
is typically sharply limited. However, the same methods<br>
which have been above applied to produce ambiguous codes<br>
for letter symbols can also be applied to non-letter<br>
symbols such as punctuation, provided that these non-<br>
letter symbols are strongly correlated.<br>
The collection of symbols to be encoded by a<br>
keyboard will be divided into subsets corresponding to<br>
modes. Modes can be at least partially ordered according<br>
to how much manipulation is required on the part of the<br>
user to obtain each mode and/or how frequently the<br>
symbols in each mode are used. Thus we can speak of<br>
primary, secondary, tertiary modes and so on in order of<br>
increasing amounts of manipulation required to obtain<br>
each mode and/or decreasing probability of the symbols in<br>
the mode.<br>
Letter symbols are preferably placed in the first<br>
mode or modes. The subtle design issues have to do with<br>
methods for assigning non-letter symbols to modes, and<br>
arranging the spatial layout of each mode.<br>
A first statistical measure to be taken into account<br>
is the probability of non-letter symbols. Some of these<br>
non-letter symbols, such as punctuation marks and digits,<br>
are essential to communication and may occur with a<br>
frequency rivalling or exceeding those of letter symbols.<br>
These punctuation marks are candidates for inclusion in<br>
the primary or secondary symbol set in any effective<br>
keyboard design. Next to be considered are correlations<br>
which arise from non-letter acting in concert with other<br>
non-letter symbols. Some non-letter symbols have<br>
conventional and conceptual relationships with other non-<br>
letter symbols, for example, the symbol (left arenthesis)<br>
is related to the symbol) (right parenthesis), as the two<br>
symbols act together to express meaning. The symbol<br>
is related to the symbol , as the two symbols express<br>
similar meanings (end of a phrase or sentence). These<br>
are examples of global relationships, common to most uses<br>
of the language, in these cases including languages such<br>
as English. There are other, more local, relationships<br>
which could be accounted for in keyboard designs for<br>
specialized purposes, such as the relationship between :<br>
and / in the expression :/ commonly used in site<br>
addresses on the World Wide Web (URLs or Universal<br>
Resource Locators).<br>
Non-letter symbols may also have statistical,<br>
conventional, and conceptual relationships with letter<br>
symbols. For some symbols, it is possible to analyze<br>
their statistical relationships with each other with<br>
reference to a corpus. For others, user studies are<br>
needed, or specialized software to capture these symbols<br>
for statistical analysis, since the symbol may never<br>
appear in a text. Examples here are "backspace", "page<br>
up", and other symbols which are used to edit, examine,<br>
or otherwise manipulate a text.<br>
Given reference statistics constructed in this way,<br>
a next step in the assignment of symbols to modes is to<br>
arrange the symbols in such a way that the statistical,<br>
conventional, and conceptual relationships are best<br>
satisfied. A further constraint which could be taken into<br>
account is the mnemonic potential of the arrangement.<br>
Preferably, all symbols are arranged within and across<br>
modes in a way that "makes sense", that is, that the<br>
symbol pattern is simple, familiar, preferably visually<br>
well structured. Even well-trained touch typists may<br>
revert to a visual scanning mode to find infrequently<br>
used symbols on a keyboard. Thus, mnemonic potential may<br>
be the overriding concern in the arrangement of modes<br>
devoted to less-frequently used symbols. It is to be<br>
appreciated that mnemonic potential can be quantified<br>
using experimental protocols for memorization tasks well-<br>
known to psychologists.<br>
To illustrate the approach, an example layout of<br>
 letter symbols [a-z], digits, and the 32 nonletter<br>
symbols<br>
found on a standard keyboard is provided. This<br>
arrangement comprises three mode changing keys, and 3<br>
modes, each mode containing 16 symbol keys, as shown in<br>
figure 36A-C. This layout is designed for PALM PILOT<br>
class machines. It has not been shown to be optimal by<br>
psychological testing.<br>
The first mode (figure 36A) contains an ambiguous<br>
code for the letters, a space/backspace key, a basic<br>
punctuation key, and a key for shifting modes in either<br>
the forward or the backward directions.<br>
The second mode (figure 36B) contains keys for<br>
the digits, and certain punctuation marks, arranged so<br>
that this mode can function either as a telephone, or as<br>
a rudimentary calculator/numeric keypad.<br>
The third mode (figure 36C) contains additional<br>
punctuation marks, arranged so that 1) a shift key<br>
relates symbols with related meanings, such as open and<br>
closed parentheses, or, if there is no related meaning,<br>
related symbol shapes, as an aid to remember the symbol<br>
placements. A convention is applied whereby "hard"<br>
symbols, more angular symbols, are on the left, while<br>
"soft" symbols, more curved symbols, are on the right.<br>
Since all or most keys have exactly two symbols,<br>
ergonomic disambiguation mechanisms as described above<br>
can operate in each mode.<br>
Selectable transparency of the keyboard Currently,<br>
typically implementations of a keyboard displayed on a<br>
touch-screen device in the PALM PILOT class comprise a<br>
keyboard occupying one part of the screen, while the rest<br>
of the screen is devoted to an application program which<br>
receives input from the keyboard, such as an address book<br>
application. Since display real estate in such devices<br>
is extremely limited, sharing the display between<br>
keyboard and application program results in both keyboard<br>
and application program being very small. Keyboards used<br>
in present devices are not meant to be practically touch<br>
typable, nor could they be, given their extremely small<br>
size. However, application of the methods of this<br>
invention produces keyboards which are small enough to be<br>
touch typable, even in the limited environment of the<br>
touch screen of a personal digital assistant. The<br>
important observation is that since the keyboard is<br>
touch-typable, it does not have to be displayed to the<br>
user. The user's fingers "know" where the keys are,<br>
without the user having to see them. Thus the keyboard<br>
can be made transparent, occupying the entire touch<br>
screen, while the application program can be opaque, and<br>
also occupy the entire touch screen. Displayed in this<br>
way, the user types directly on the application program<br>
to produce input to it. In figure 35 a keyboard displayed<br>
in this way 1003 is shown with an application program<br>
1002 in this case a drawing program displaying a drawing.<br>
Since it is impossible to draw a transparent keyboard,<br>
the keyboard is indicated in this figure in a shade of<br>
gray, while the application program is shown in black.<br>
Indeed, it would be possible to allow the user to select<br>
the level of transparency of the keyboard, for example,<br>
as a function of his or her level of touch typing skill.<br>
It has already been pointed out that different modes<br>
may contain symbols of different levels of familiarity<br>
to the user. To account for these differences, the<br>
transparency of the keyboard could also be adjusted as a<br>
function of mode, becoming increasingly less transparent<br>
as the unfamiliarity of the symbols in the mode<br>
increases. It is to be noted that the same effect of<br>
distinguishing the keyboard for the applications program<br>
could be accomplished by adjusting other visual factors,<br>
such as the color of the image, in addition to its<br>
transparency.<br>
Hybrid Chording/Ambiguous Keyboards The important<br>
observation on which this aspect of the present invention<br>
is based is that chording patterns which require but two<br>
keys to be activated substantially simultaneously, such<br>
as the chording pattern which causes a Qwerty keyboard to<br>
encode capital letters, are readily learnable and can<br>
therefore be adopted by a large user community. However,<br>
the prior art has proven that chording patterns any more<br>
complex than this will not become generally accepted.<br>
It has been noted that there are two main prior-art<br>
approaches toward typable devices with a small number of<br>
keys: chording methods and ambiguous-code methods. One<br>
aspect of the present invention is to teach how to<br>
synergistically combine these two methods.<br>
We can distinguish two kinds of chording methods 1)<br>
methods in which a key or keys are reserved for the<br>
function of forming chords, an example is the familiar<br>
shift key used for keying uppercase letters by a chording<br>
combination of the shift key with a letter key, and we<br>
will generally refer to such keys as shift keys, 2)<br>
methods in which chords are formed by activating a<br>
plurality of letter keys substantially simultaneously. In<br>
the present embodiment the first of these methods is<br>
used, in a subsequent embodiment, the second of<br>
these methods is used.<br>
The essential insight of this aspect of this<br>
invention is that substantially simultaneous activation<br>
of a pair of input means is readily unified into a single<br>
gesture by a human user. Thus, a pair of keystrokes is no<br>
or little more difficult to master than a single<br>
keystroke, yet, a pair of keystrokes contains<br>
substantially more information than a single keystroke,<br>
and thus can be used to create easily operable, low-<br>
ambiguity codes and typable devices based on these codes.<br>
Thus, to make the keyboard easy to learn, chords must<br>
require no more than a pair of keys to be activated<br>
substantially simultaneously. In this embodiment, one of<br>
the pair being a key reserved for forming chords, and the<br>
other a key corresponding to at least one decoding<br>
symbol. Rare symbols may still require more than two keys<br>
to be activated substantially simultaneously, and very<br>
frequent symbols could be associated with a single input<br>
means without exceeding the scope of this invention.<br>
It is preferred that at least one of the decoding<br>
symbols is a strongly correlated symbol. In this way,<br>
should a chord be formed improperly, when a shift key is<br>
activated when it should not be or not activated when it<br>
should be, the disambiguation software may be able to<br>
correct for this error.<br>
Thus, while chording and ambiguous codes could a<br>
priori be combined in any number of ways, according to<br>
the teachings of this embodiment, preferred combinations<br>
are such that<br>
• no more than 2 input means need be<br>
substantially simultaneously activated in order<br>
to encode any substantially probable symbol.<br>
• lookup error and/or query error is optimized,<br>
• chording is accomplished using a mode-shift<br>
key,<br>
• (preferably) such that the probability of using<br>
the mode-shift key is minimized.<br>
When chording and ambiguous-code methods are<br>
combined according to these teachings, surprising and<br>
synergistic results are obtained as will be<br>
demonstrated by the present embodiment in which a hybrid<br>
chording/ambiguous-code method is applied to a telephone<br>
embodying the standard ambiguous code. We have already<br>
seen that the standard ambiguous code has rather poor<br>
lookup error and query rate. It is therefore quite<br>
extraordinary that using a hybrid method a keyboard based<br>
on the standard ambiguous code can be made {level C)<br>
strongly touch typable. The objects of this embodiment<br>
are to produce a keyboard which is<br>
• strongly touch typable, fully compatible with<br>
standard telephones embodying the standard<br>
ambiguous code,<br>
• simple to operate,<br>
• simple to learn,<br>
• and uses a minimal number of keying gestures.<br>
A standard telephone embodying the standard<br>
ambiguous code is shown in figure 38. It is seen that a<br>
plurality of keys 10000 are used to encode letters and<br>
digits, there are eight of these. Two keys 10001, 10002<br>
encode only digits, and two keys 10003,10004 encode the<br>
non-letter symbols * and # respectively. In this<br>
embodiment, one of the keys selected from the group<br>
consisting of 10001, 10002, 10003, 10004 will be used as<br>
a mode-changing key, preferable key 10001 encoding the<br>
digit 1. This selected key will be referred to as the<br>
shift key, for reasons which will become evident. Key<br>
10001 can be conveniently activated by the thumb of the<br>
left hand while the telephone is held in the left hand,<br>
while the right hand is used to activate the other keys.<br>
For an embodiment in which the right thumb is used to<br>
active the shift key while the telephone is held in the<br>
right hand, key 10004 can be used as the shift key.<br>
For each of the keys in the plurality 10000 the<br>
corresponding letters will be divided into two subsets,<br>
which will be referred to as the shift set and the non-<br>
shift set respectively. Letters will be assigned to the<br>
(shift, nonshift) sets so that<br>
• lookup error is minimized,<br>
• queries are minimized,<br>
• one of the sets, without loss of generality,<br>
the shift set, contains exactly one letter per<br>
key,<br>
• the probability of activating the shift key is<br>
minimized.<br>
As is usually the case, simultaneous optimization<br>
with respect to lookup error rate, query rate, and other<br>
ergonomic criteria implies compromise. For instance, one<br>
could potentially achieve better lookup error rates and<br>
query rates by removing the restriction that one of the<br>
(shift, nonshift) sets is composed of a single letter per<br>
key and allowing the number of letters in the shift set<br>
to vary from key to key. However, regularity of the<br>
partition into shift and nonshift sets makes the keyboard<br>
easier to learn, an ergonomic criterion which is here<br>
given high priority. Learnability could be further<br>
improved by selecting the singletons such that the<br>
collection of singletons is easy to remember, perhaps by<br>
mnemonic. This selection, however, could compromise<br>
lookup error rates and query rates.<br>
There are 11664 different pairs of shift/non-shift<br>
sets obeying the constraint that the shift set contains<br>
but one letter per key. This number is small enough that<br>
all possibilities can be tested for their ergonomic<br>
properties.<br>
The results of testing all such codes are shown in<br>
figure 39, where lookup error rate is plotted vs. query<br>
rate, for all 11664 codes, as well as the standard<br>
ambiguous code SAC. It is to be noted that while all of<br>
the codes are better than the standard ambiguous code,<br>
most are better by a small multiple. However, this<br>
distribution is quite large, and the best code CEHLNSTY<br>
with a lookup error rate of 431 words/lookup error and<br>
query rate of 21 words/query is 15 times better than the<br>
standard ambiguous code in terms of lookup error and 10<br>
times better in terms of query error. This best code is<br>
abC dEf gHi jkL mNo pqrS Tuv wxYz where the<br>
elements of the shift set are written with uppercase<br>
letters. It is to be emphasized again that this code is<br>
the best code with respect to our reference statistics,<br>
other statistics may yield other best codes, though it<br>
appears to be among the best for statistics drawn from<br>
many alternate corpora of English. It should be further<br>
appreciated that the same hybrid chording/ambiguous code<br>
method could be applied to arbitrary ambiguous codes in<br>
which the underlying ambiguous code is not constrained to<br>
be the standard ambiguous code, indeed is not constrained<br>
to be in alphabetic ordering, or only 8 keys, or with an<br>
even-as-possible partition. By allowing more freedom to<br>
choose codes, hybrid chording/ambiguous codes can be<br>
found of such high quality in terms of lookup error rate<br>
and query rate that other ergonomic criteria, such as<br>
minimizing use of the shift key, could be profitably<br>
combined with optimization of lookup error rate and query<br>
rate. These optimizations are beyond the scope of the<br>
present embodiment, which seeks full compatibility with<br>
existing telephones, they are however, well within the<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
To further facilitate the learnability and<br>
operability of this keyboard, the letters which form the<br>
shift set are preferably represented on the corresponding<br>
key using an uppercase letter, while the letters in the<br>
nonshift set are represented as a lowercase letter, as<br>
shown in figure 38. Alternately, the two sets could be<br>
indicated by lettering varying in size, color, typeface<br>
etc.<br>
Use of this device is simple. When the text to be<br>
typed contains a letter in the shift set, then the shift<br>
key must be operated substantially simultaneously with<br>
the corresponding letter key, this letter will be<br>
represented unambiguously. By contrast, when a letter in<br>
the nonshift set is required, the corresponding letter<br>
key is operated, and the letter is represented<br>
ambiguously.<br>
In view of the teachings of this invention, it will<br>
be appreciated that the disambiguation mechanism<br>
corresponding to this embodiment could be physically<br>
located within the telephone, at the sending end of the<br>
communication, and or at the receiving end of the<br>
communication, for instance at a central computer which<br>
the user contacts by telephone.<br>
As we have seen, on the standard telephone keypad<br>
there are 4 keys available to encode non-letter<br>
information such as mode changes. Using the method of<br>
synthesized encoding symbols described above, the number<br>
of non-letter symbols encodable using a telephone keypad<br>
can be further increased. In particular, added shift keys<br>
can be provided if even lower levels of ambiguity are<br>
required. For instance, with 4 shift keys, each<br>
associated to one letter on each letter key, totally<br>
disambiguous text entry can be achieved, albeit while<br>
increasing the number of keystrokes per letter. In short,<br>
many associations of subsets of decoding symbols with<br>
shift keys can be imagined. One particular class of<br>
assignments is considered in a later section on<br>
internationalization of these teachings, up to now<br>
described in detail mainly with respect to English.<br>
It will be appreciated that using the shift key in<br>
combination with the remaining non-letter keys, in the<br>
preferred arrangement the *, # and 0 keys, can be used<br>
to encode at least 6 non-letter symbols, such as<br>
punctuation symbols, mode-shift symbols, and the like.<br>
Error correction using the standard ambiguous code<br>
Especially when used by a novice user, the keyboard of<br>
the present embodiment could be operated in such a manner<br>
that the shift key is pressed at times when it should not<br>
be to encode the intended text, and at other times the<br>
shift key will not be pressed when it should be. Often,<br>
such a manipulation will result in a meaningless decoding<br>
if the disambiguation device is expecting correctly typed<br>
encoding sequences in the hybrid chording/ambiguous code.<br>
In these cases, rather than issuing a query, an alternate<br>
disambiguation can be attempted in which the shift key<br>
activation is ignored, and the encoding sequence is<br>
interpreted as being an encoding sequence in the standard<br>
ambiguous code. Often, this interpretation will recover<br>
the text intended by the user.<br>
It is to be noted that in the device shown in<br>
figure 38 a strongly correlated symbol (space)<br>
is paired on the same key with a weakly or uncorrelated<br>
symbol (backspace). This pairing potentially allows<br>
disamiguation software to correct errors in which (space)<br>
is meant but (backspace) keyed by the user, or vice<br>
versa.<br>
Touch-typing-oriented querying It is preferable in this<br>
embodiment to use the selected shift key as the scroll<br>
key for querying, when querying is permitted, as<br>
described above. It will be appreciated that whether the<br>
key functions as a shift key or a scroll key at any given<br>
moment can be determined automatically given the<br>
appropriate software. When the device is in querying<br>
mode the key functions as a scroll key, and otherwise<br>
functions as a shift key.<br>
Alternate placement of shift keys Referring again to<br>
figure 38, we note that this embodiment has been designed<br>
to be operable using existing, standard, telephones. If<br>
telephones are manufactured with use of this embodiment<br>
in mind, they are preferably equipped with additional key<br>
or keys 1005 to function as the shift key. It is<br>
preferred to place these additional keys on the sides of<br>
the telephone, where they can be actuated by the thumb of<br>
the hand holding the telephone; such a placement is shown<br>
in figure 38. Additional keys to be actuated by the<br>
fingers of the hand holding the telephone (either the<br>
left or the right hand) may also be used 10006.<br>
Culling infrequent words in queries It is often the case<br>
that a very frequent word is ambiguous with a very<br>
infrequent word. For instance, in the case of CEHLNSTY<br>
for English, the very frequent word "for" is ambiguous<br>
with the very infrequent word "fop". By eliminating<br>
these very infrequent words from the dictionary, the<br>
effective query rate can be improved with very little<br>
effect on how well that dictionary represents the<br>
language in question. For instance, the query rate for<br>
CEHLNSTY can be improved to 1 query every 46 words, by<br>
eliminating words whose total probability is less than<br>
one part in 50 thousand. This culling can be achieved<br>
for instance by application of a "gap factor" given by<br>
the ratio between two words in the query, e.g. the most<br>
frequent and the least frequent. If, for instance, the<br>
gap factor is set to 500, the distribution of figure xxx<br>
is obtained, two codes, the standard ambiguous code (SAC)<br>
and the CEHLNSTY code are particularly pointed out in<br>
this drawing.<br>
Internationalization There are two main issues in<br>
internationalization of the present embodiment, both of<br>
which are readily solved by a person skilled in the art<br>
in application of the teachings of this invention. These<br>
are 1) handling accents, and 2) creation of generalized<br>
codes which are applicable to many languages at once.<br>
Both of these issues will be briefly discussed.<br>
Handling accents. Many languages are written with<br>
letters which may appear in both an accented and an<br>
unaccented form. For example, in French, "e" may be<br>
written as "e", "e", or "e". It is generally important to<br>
distinguish these accented letters. Without accents, for<br>
instance, the word "eleve" (meaning "student") can be<br>
ambiguous with the word "eleve"" (meaning "raised") . One<br>
natural approach is to use another shift key, which we<br>
can call an accent-shift key which has the function of<br>
selecting an accented version of a letter when used in<br>
combination with a key encoding that letter. For<br>
instance, to treat French using CEHLNSTY, we can key the<br>
accent shift key in combination with the "def" key to<br>
encode either "'e" or "'e", and then rely on a<br>
disambiguation mechanism to decide which of these two<br>
accents is appropriate for a given word. Using this<br>
approach, we find that with some set of word-frequency<br>
statistics for French, a (lookup, query) rate of (38,3)<br>
for CEHLNSTY without an accent-shift key, but (584,24)<br>
with an accent shift key. For the telephone keypad, any<br>
of the keys on the bottom row could be used as an accent<br>
shift key, for example. In specially built keypads, an<br>
additional key could be provided to supply the accent-<br>
shift function. For ergonomic reasons, it is preferable<br>
that this accent-shift key be operated in a manner<br>
similar to the way the usual shift key is operated, e.g.<br>
such that thumb motion in one direction is used to encode<br>
a regular shift operation, while thumb motion in an<br>
opposite direction is used to encode the accent-shift<br>
operation.<br>
Multi-Language Ambiguous Codes Since the statistics of<br>
one language are typically different from the statistics<br>
of another language, a code which is substantially<br>
optimal with respect to one language may not be<br>
substantially optimal with respect to another language. A<br>
code which is strongly touch typable with respect to one<br>
language may not be strongly touch typable with respect<br>
to another language.<br>
For example, CEHLNSTY, optimized for English,<br>
performs less well for French than a code specifically<br>
chosen for its optimality with respect to French. In this<br>
particular example, CEHLNSTY remains strongly touch<br>
typable with respect French, though this will not be the<br>
case with respect to all languages.<br>
In order to gain economies of scale, manufacturers<br>
may wish to produce a single machine operable in many<br>
local linguistic environments. Since a typable device,<br>
for instance, a mobile phone, may preferably have keys<br>
labeled with the ambiguous code for which it is designed,<br>
it is useful to have a single code which applies to many<br>
languages, so that this labelling can be done in the same<br>
way for all machines in a production run, regardless of<br>
the target linguistic community.<br>
Applying exactly the same techniques as have been<br>
already described, it is possible to produce ambiguous<br>
codes which are simultaneously optimized with respect to<br>
several different languages. In a multi-language<br>
optimization method, the step of weighting ergonomic<br>
criteria with respect to each other can include as a<br>
sub-step the step of weighting multiple languages with<br>
respect to each other. Different weighting schemes are<br>
appropriate in different circumstances. For instance, one<br>
may choose to simultaneously optimize with respect to<br>
statistics of English and German, and yet weight<br>
performance of the code with respect to English as more<br>
important than performance with respect to German.<br>
A preferred weighting method is one in which the<br>
minimum performance is maximized, such a procedure will<br>
be referred to as a mini-max procedure.<br>
Consider optimizing with respect to a set of<br>
languages 11, 12,..., In, and a set of ergonomic<br>
criteria, el, e2, ... , em. Given two ambiguous codes<br>
cl, c2, and for each ergonomic criterion em, we rate cl<br>
as better than c2 if for cl the minimum of em over the<br>
languages In is greater than the minimum of em over the<br>
languages In for c2. When several ergonomic criteria must<br>
be optimized against, it may happen that one code is<br>
better than another in the mini-max sense with respect to<br>
one ergonomic criterion, but worse with respect to<br>
another ergonomic criterion. In this case the ergonomic<br>
criteria must be weighted with respect to each other as<br>
has already been described in detail.<br>
As an example of these teachings, consider<br>
optimizing with respect to lookup error and query error<br>
for a set of languages. In this example will we allow<br>
non-alphabetic orderings, and use 8 regular input means,<br>
and a auxiliary input means and an accent-shift auxiliary<br>
input means, so that the 8 regular input means can be<br>
used in combination with one of the auxiliary input means<br>
in a hybrid chording/ambiguous code embodiment as has<br>
been previously described.<br>
First consider optimizing with respect to the set<br>
of languages consisting of French, Italian, Portuguese<br>
and Spanish, each language represented by a set of<br>
reference statistics.<br>
Using the directed random walk method, one readily<br>
finds codes such as joz m bhx a kn r pw d iy 1 gq t ev c<br>
fu s with (lookup error rate, query rate) of (3250,265),<br>
(11400,3800), (4720,505), and (6280,400) with respect to<br>
French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish respectively.<br>
This code has relatively poor performance on Dutch,<br>
English, and German, with values of (65,4.8),(93,10), and<br>
(360,13) respectively.<br>
Using a similar amount of computing time, but<br>
optimizing now with respect to Dutch, English, and<br>
German, one can find codes such as cjk r biy 1 fv e mo a<br>
sz p hx g tu d qw n which yields (1220,44), (816,44),<br>
(480,47) on these languages respectively. This same code<br>
yields (253,20),(306,50),(525,36), (4236,272) for French,<br>
Italian, Portuguese and Spanish respectively. And while<br>
these results are respectable for the out of sample<br>
languages, they are not nearly as good as the results<br>
obtained when ambiguity with respect to these languages<br>
is explicitly optimized. These results suggest that the<br>
more different the languages are from each other, the<br>
less performance on one language generalizes to<br>
performance on another language.<br>
In practical circumstances, the decision as to which<br>
languages to include in a multi-language optimization<br>
scheme are more commercial then conceptual. The<br>
important inventive concept taught by this disclosure is<br>
that even the minimal performance over the selected<br>
languages should be such that the code should be strongly<br>
touch typable. In the cases examined above, optimization-<br>
with respect to French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish<br>
discovered a code which is level C strongly touch typable<br>
with respect to these languages, but the minimal<br>
performance is barely level A strongly touch typable<br>
with respect to Dutch, English, and German.<br>
Strongly touch typable handheld device which is typable<br>
using one hand. In the hybrid chording/ambiguous code<br>
embodiment described above, it was shown how a<br>
distinguished input means can be used to form chords with<br>
input means encoding ambiguously coded symbols in order<br>
to reduce the ambiguity of the overall system. This<br>
present embodiment shows how the same input means can be<br>
used both for chord formation and for encoding<br>
ambiguously encoded symbols. In this case the ambiguous<br>
code can be expressed as a multi-level code: a first<br>
sequence of input means manipulations serves to select a<br>
first subset of decoding symbols, a second sequence of<br>
input means manipulations serves to select a second<br>
subset of decoding symbols, and so on. Preferably, the<br>
second subset is a subset of the first subset, the third<br>
subset a subset of the second subset (and thus a subset<br>
of the first subset), and so on. This is a "divide and<br>
conquer" approach, as such well known to those in the<br>
art. However, it is not been heretofore understood that<br>
a) the number of successive subdivisions of the set of<br>
symbols can be limited by making the smallest subsets<br>
contain more than one symbol, and thus represent an<br>
ambiguous code, nor b) that the manner of subdivision can<br>
be chosen so as to minimize the ambiguity of the final<br>
ambiguous code, nor c) that ambiguity reduction can be<br>
optimized while simultaneously optimizing other ergonomic<br>
criteria, such as adherence to convention, nor d) that<br>
the transition between levels in the hierarchy can be<br>
accomplished with chords consisting of pairs of key<br>
presses only.<br>
A concrete manifestation of these discoveries will<br>
now be described in detail, with reference to figures 39<br>
to 47. It will be understood that this is but one of an<br>
infinite number of devices that can be built according to<br>
the teachings of this invention: any typable device which<br>
relies on a divide and conquer approach to code<br>
construction, while minimizing ambiguity and/or some<br>
other ergonomic criterion such as adherence to<br>
convention, fits well within the scope of this<br>
embodiment.<br>
This embodiment is a device which is strongly<br>
touch-typable with a single hand. It has the additional<br>
desirable characteristics of<br>
1) permitting a fully unambiguous text-entry mode.<br>
2) permitting a substantially optimal, strongly<br>
touch typable, ambiguous text-entry mode.<br>
3) permitting a minimal-keystroke mode for<br>
data-retrieval.<br>
4) is such that the above three modes are<br>
maximally ergonomically compatible.<br>
Preferably, this device can be configured such that,<br>
in addition to the above-stated ergonomic criteria, a new<br>
ergonomic criterion, scan time, is also optimized.<br>
Optimization of scan time will be discussed in a section<br>
below.<br>
An overview of the method for constructing a<br>
typable device based on multi-level ambiguous codes is<br>
described in reference to figure 39.<br>
In the first step 150, a set of second-level<br>
decoding symbols are selected. These are the symbols that<br>
are to be represented by the ambiguous code, and might<br>
include, for example for English, the letters a<br>
through z.<br>
In the next step 151, an ergonomic criterion is<br>
selected for the over-all multi-level code. This<br>
ergonomic criterion could be, for example, strong touch<br>
typability or lookup error. In general, many ergonomic<br>
criteria of the multi-level code could be simultaneously<br>
selected. In the next step 152, the second-level decoding<br>
symbols are divided into subsets. An encoding symbol is<br>
assigned to each second-level subset in such a way that<br>
the overall code is optimized with respect to the<br>
selected ergonomic criterion. Up to this point, the<br>
construction is not different from the construction of<br>
any optimized ambiguous code. However, there may be<br>
additional constraints, for instance on the allowed<br>
number of encoding symbols, such that the next step of<br>
construction can be executed. In this next step 153, the<br>
second-level encoding symbols are collected into groups.<br>
These groups are treated as decoding symbols for a<br>
first-level ambiguous code. Otherwise said, the encoding<br>
symbols of the second-level code become decoding symbols<br>
for the first-level code. Hence, a first-level encoding<br>
symbol is assigned to each group, forming a first-level<br>
ambiguous code. Additional optimization of ergonomic<br>
criteria can be performed in the assignment of<br>
second-level symbols into groups. In general, each level<br>
in a multi-level code can be optimized with respect to<br>
different ergonomic criteria. These criteria may be the<br>
same, or may be different from, the ergonomic criteria<br>
with respect to which the over-all multi-level code is<br>
optimized. In the final step 154, the multi-level code<br>
thus constructed is embodied in a typable device.<br>
In this description of the construction of a<br>
multi-level code, the construction of the second-level<br>
code was described as proceeding the construction of the<br>
first-level code. In using a device embodying a<br>
multi-level code this order is reversed: first an element<br>
of the first-level code is selected by manipulation of<br>
input means, then an element of the second-level code is<br>
selected by further manipulation of input means. This is<br>
the essence of the divide-and-conquer approach. It will<br>
be evident to one skilled in the art that this<br>
construction could be continued in the same way to<br>
include third- and higher-level codes.<br>
In practice, properties of each level of the<br>
multi-level code must be simultaneously optimized to<br>
achieve desired properties of the over-all multi-level<br>
code. The present embodiment is presented to concretely<br>
illustrate how this simultaneous optimization can be<br>
planned and executed.<br>
The overview of the method of construction of this<br>
embodiment is shown in figure 40. To help exhibit the<br>
procedure in full generality, three ergonomic criterion<br>
are selected for the over-all multi-level code, two<br>
criteria for the first-level code and three for the<br>
second-level code which comprise the multi-level code. In<br>
this embodiment the three ergonomic criteria applied to<br>
the multi-level code are strong touch typability, query<br>
error, and lookup error. The first-level code is<br>
optimized relative to anatomic fidelity, and alphabetic<br>
ordering, and the second-level code is optimized relative<br>
to evenness of partition, anatomic fidelity, and<br>
substantial alphabetic ordering.<br>
The first step 3100 in the construction of this<br>
embodiment is the selection of (second-level) decoding<br>
symbols. These are the letters a-z. Then strong touch<br>
typability, query error, and lookup error are selected as<br>
ergonomic criteria for the multi-level code in steps<br>
3101, 3102, and 3103 respectively. Then, in step 3104,<br>
anatomic fidelity is selected as a ergonomic criterion.<br>
Since this device is meant to be typable using the<br>
fingers of the hand holding the device, anatomic fidelity<br>
is maximized when there are 4 input means and 4<br>
corresponding first-level encoding symbols, one for each<br>
finger.<br>
Anatomic fidelity is chosen as an ergonomic<br>
criterion for the second-level code in step 3105. Each<br>
encoding symbols in the first-level code will correspond<br>
to several encoding symbols for the second-level code.<br>
Anatomic fidelity of the second-level code is maximized<br>
if each of the 4 first-level symbols corresponds to 4<br>
second-level encoding symbols, so the number of<br>
second-level encoding symbols should be 16 for anatomic<br>
fidelity to be maximized. 16 second-level encoding<br>
symbols can be associated with second-level decoding<br>
symbols such that evenness of partition is maximized if<br>
the 26 second-level decoding symbols are distributed over<br>
the second-level encoding symbols such that either 1 or 2<br>
second-level decoding symbols are associated with each of<br>
the 16 second-level encoding symbols. This distribution<br>
implies, in turn, that between 4 and 8 second-level<br>
decoding symbols will be ultimately associated with each<br>
of the 4 first-level decoding symbols.<br>
Next, in step 3106, alphabetic ordering is selected<br>
as an ergonomic criterion for the first-level code.<br>
Optimizing with respect to this criterion requires<br>
simultaneous optimization of both the first- and<br>
second-level codes. What is required is that the letters<br>
a-z must be displayable in alphabetic order on the<br>
displays corresponding to the input means associated with<br>
each finger respectively. Since these displays are<br>
arranged in order of the fingers, this implies in turn<br>
that letters from the first part of the alphabet must be<br>
associated to second-level decoding symbols which are in<br>
turn associated to the first-level encoding symbol which<br>
is associated to input means associated to the first<br>
finger. In the same way, a second group of letters,<br>
following the first group in alphabetic order, must be<br>
assigned to second-level encoding symbols associated to<br>
the first-order encoding symbol associated with the input<br>
means associated to the next finger, and so on for the<br>
other two first-level encoding symbols. Optimizing with<br>
respect to alphabetic ordering thus corresponds to<br>
choosing an ordered partition of the 26 letters, in the<br>
same way as has been discussed for other embodiments of<br>
this invention. This time, each of the 4 elements of the<br>
ordered partition must have between 4 and 8 subelements,<br>
so that all of the ergonomic criteria listed can<br>
simultaneously optimized. As will be shown in the<br>
detailed description of the best mode for this<br>
embodiment, codes with even-as-possible partitions, even<br>
for the first-level code, can be found, while optimizing<br>
as well with respect to all of the other ergonomic<br>
criteria considered.<br>
Finally, in step 3107, substantial alphabetic<br>
ordering is chosen as an ergonomic criterion of the<br>
second-level ambiguous code. This means that it should be<br>
possible to lay out the letters as well as possible in<br>
alphabet ordering, given all of the other constraints on<br>
the assignment of letters to second-level encoding<br>
symbols. Divergences from strict alphabetic ordering can<br>
be measured in any number of ways, for instance by the<br>
number of pairwise permutations required to bring a given<br>
ordering into strict alphabetic ordering.<br>
In reference now to figures 41-47, we describe a<br>
strongly touch typable handheld device, typable using one<br>
hand, encoding at least the letters [a-z], and embodying<br>
a code constructed according to the above described<br>
method. In order for a device built according to the<br>
present embodiment to be touch typable, the division of<br>
the symbols into subsets, subsets of subsets, and so on<br>
must be fixed, that is, not changing depending for<br>
instance on which symbols have been previously entered.<br>
This fixedness pertains only to the requirement of touch<br>
typability, and the teachings of this invention could be<br>
applied in a broader context. For instance, allowing<br>
word completion mechanisms can significantly reduce the<br>
number of keystrokes. But since the behavior of the<br>
word-completion mechanism is complex and difficult to<br>
predict, a machine with word-completion is not in any<br>
strict sense touch-typable. Nonetheless, the same<br>
optimizations that lead to strongly touch typable codes<br>
lead to effective word completion mechanisms, since the<br>
lower the ambiguity, the better word completion can be<br>
effected. Thus, augmenting a strongly touch typable<br>
code with word-completion mechanism does not transport<br>
the device beyond the scope of the present invention.<br>
For the present embodiment we make the further<br>
limitation that the symbol-input typable part of the<br>
device must be able to be held in one hand, and be<br>
typable by the hand holding the device, and that hand<br>
only. To limit the requirement for digit motion, most of<br>
the symbols can be input though sequences of manipulation<br>
of but 5 input means: 4 input means operable by the<br>
fingers of the hand holding the device 2100-2103 and 1<br>
input means operated by the thumb of the hand holding the<br>
device 2104. The device shown in figure 41 is meant to<br>
be held in the left hand; it is evident that the<br>
symmetric device designed to be held in the right hand or<br>
an ambidextrous device operable by either hand could also<br>
be constructed.<br>
Preferably, associated with each of the input means<br>
2100-2103 is a visual display 2106-2109 showing the<br>
elements of the subset currently associated with the<br>
given input means. Operating the input means selects the<br>
corresponding subset. The input means 2104 can be used to<br>
further refine the subset selection and/or be used to<br>
select other subsets of symbols. For example, the single<br>
symbol "space" can be associated with the input means<br>
2104; this or other symbols associated with input means<br>
2104 can be preferably displayed on display means 2110.<br>
The letters [a-z] can be distributed over the 4 input<br>
means 2100-2103. The distribution of letters over the<br>
input means is preferably chosen so as to minimize the<br>
ambiguity (lookup error rate and/or query rate) of the<br>
resulting code, while simultaneously adhering to the<br>
convention of alphabetic ordering. This adherence aids<br>
the novice user in finding a needed letter by simply<br>
scanning the candidate letters.<br>
Figure 42 shows an arrangement of the letters [a-z]<br>
in which the letters [a-f] are associated with the first<br>
input means 2100 , [g-1] with the second input means<br>
2101, ttn-r] with the third input means 2102, and<br>
finally [s-z] with the fourth input means 2103. These<br>
associations constitute first-level subsets in a<br>
first-level code. In general, it will be preferred to<br>
associate 4-8 letters with each of these 4 input means:<br>
thereby the subset of letters associated to each input<br>
means can be further subdivided into 4 subsets, each of<br>
which contains no more than two letters. The utility of<br>
this limitation will become evident shortly, and it will<br>
be evident to one skilled in the art how to extend the<br>
teachings of this embodiment to languages with a<br>
different number of symbols, and a different number of<br>
input means.<br>
An example set of second-level subsets which divide<br>
the first-level subsets shown in figure 42 is shown in<br>
figure 43. Figure 43 is a table of four columns and four<br>
rows. The columns are labeled by the input means<br>
activated at the first step, the rows by the symbols<br>
associated to each input means at the second step. Thus,<br>
for instance, if input means 2100 is first activated,<br>
then at the second step, the symbols ac will be<br>
associated to input means 2100, be to the input means<br>
2101, etc. This assignment is chosen to minimize lookup<br>
error and query rates, given the constraints on subset<br>
size described above. The lookup error and query rates<br>
for this code are (1100,69) using our reference<br>
statistics. It is to be noted very carefully that in<br>
this example, the letters in the first level subsets are<br>
arrangeable in alphabetic ordering, but the letters in<br>
the second-level subsets are only partially arrangeable<br>
in alphabetic ordering. It was decided for this example<br>
to loosen the alphabet ordering constraint at the second<br>
level in order to permit better query and lookup rates,<br>
and to produce a code which is as strongly touch typable<br>
as possible. This shows that alphabetic ordering can be<br>
optimized, or not, just like any other ergonomic<br>
criterion, and that weighting of optimization properties<br>
can be different at different levels in a multi-level<br>
ambiguous code. The advantage, again, of alphabetic<br>
ordering is that it reduces scan time, especially for<br>
novice users. Since the number of symbols displayed at<br>
the second level is small, scan time is in any case<br>
small, and can be further reduced by mechanisms to be<br>
discussed presently.<br>
To type a given desired letter, the user first<br>
activates one of the input means 2100-2103 corresponding<br>
to first subset containing the desired letter. The user<br>
then selects one of the second-level subsets by again<br>
activating one of the input means 2100-2103<br>
corresponding to a set of letters containing the desired<br>
letter. Figure 44 shows an example operation of the<br>
device in which the user types the letter e. With<br>
reference to figure 42 we see that e is associated with<br>
input means 2100 by the first level code. The user<br>
activates this input means, and the display becomes that<br>
shown in figure 44. Now the letter e is associated with<br>
the input means 2101. When this input means is<br>
manipulated, the letter e is output. The same sequence<br>
of manipulations of input means serves also to select the<br>
letter b, so the code is ambiguous. As in the other<br>
embodiments, which of the letters b or e is intended is<br>
determined from context by a disambiguation mechanism.<br>
Words are entered by successively selecting the required<br>
letters in this manner, and terminating the word by<br>
activation of the input means 2104 associated with the<br>
thumb, two-hand operation. It should be noted that since<br>
a two-stroke method is used to encode each letter, this<br>
input method can form the basis of a one-hand/two-hand<br>
embodiment. More explicitly, if one hand is used to<br>
indicate the first stroke of each letter, and the second<br>
hand is used to indicate the second stroke of each<br>
letter, then first and second-stroke information could be<br>
input simultaneously. There are numerous physical<br>
embodiments which could be based on this remark. For<br>
instance, the "fingering" mechanism of [4] could be the<br>
physical substrate upon which a one-hand/two-hand<br>
embodiment could be based. The code proposed by [4] is<br>
based on motion sensors capable of sensing several<br>
positions per finger, to encode each letter<br>
unambiguously. This requires relatively sophisticated<br>
sensors. However, using a two-handed variant of the<br>
present embodiment, simpler sensors could be used. These<br>
sensors would need only record binary (up/down)<br>
information for each finger. Both software and hardware<br>
complexity could be reduced in this manner. In addition,<br>
a machine build according to the teachings of this<br>
invention would be simpler for the user to learn and<br>
operate.<br>
Visual Cache Scan time is the time it takes to visually<br>
locate a desired letter from a set of letters. The<br>
hunt-and-peck typist visually scans the keyboard to find<br>
a next letter and then presses the corresponding key.<br>
Scan time is determined by a number of factors, including<br>
the user's familiarity with the layout of a keyboard. The<br>
hunt-and-peck typist may know basically where the<br>
desired key is, and is using visual scanning only for<br>
confirmation, or precise localization. It is to improve<br>
scan time, through the familiarity of typical users with<br>
an alphabetic ordering, that alphabetic ordering was<br>
chosen for the first-level code of this embodiment.<br>
In a variant of alphabetic ordering, certain letters are<br>
selected from the group of letters on a given key for<br>
display in a distinguished, selected area of the visual<br>
display associated with the key. These letters are the<br>
most likely-to-be-selected letters at any given moment,<br>
and placing them in a distinguished position makes them<br>
easier to find. The principle is analogous to the cache<br>
used in some computer processors to store recently-used<br>
data in registers where they can be gotten at quickly,<br>
under the hypothesis that data recently used is more<br>
likely to be used again. Here, letters are placed in<br>
cache not on the basis of their recent use, but on the<br>
basis of their likelihood to be used next, given the<br>
statistics of the language. Still, the term "visual<br>
cache" seems appropriate.<br>
One embodiment of a visual cache will now be<br>
described in the context of the current embodiment. It<br>
will be appreciated that this invention permits a wide<br>
variety of modifications without modification of its<br>
essential quality, for instance, modifications in the<br>
size and location of the cache, how the cache is<br>
organized, how it is labelled, and the like.<br>
From analysis of our standard statistics, we find<br>
that of the letters [a-f] associated to input means 2100<br>
by the first-level code, "a" is the most likely to be the<br>
first letter of a word. Similarly, of the letters [g-1]<br>
associated to input means 2101 2101, "i" is the most<br>
likely to be the first letter of a word, "o". the most<br>
likely from [m-r] associated with input means 2102, and<br>
"t" the most likely from the letters [s-z] associated to<br>
input means 2103.<br>
By placing the letters a,i,o,t in a distinguished<br>
portion of the display, for instance the upper-left hand<br>
corner of the display area associated with each input<br>
means. This makes these letters the first-encountered<br>
letters in a standard left-to-right, top-to-bottom visual<br>
scan of each associated display. Preferably, other than<br>
this selection of a single letter out of alphabetic<br>
order, alphabetic ordering is maintained for the other<br>
letters in the subset. The distinction between the<br>
letter in cache and the rest of the letters can be<br>
further marked by selecting a different color, size,<br>
style, etc. of font for the cached letter than for the<br>
rest of the letters.<br>
Referring now to figures 45 and 46, we see how this<br>
observation can be exploited to reduce scan time.<br>
Figure 45 shows how the word "think" is entered without<br>
the use of a visual cache, and figure 46 shows the same<br>
word entered using a visual cache. Thus, in figure 45,<br>
the letter "t" is entered by first activating the first<br>
input means 2103 corresponding to the letter "t". Before<br>
the first input means is activated, the display as shown<br>
in the second column of the figure. Once 2103 is<br>
activated, the display changes to that shown in the third<br>
column. When the input means 2101 is then activated, the<br>
letter "t" is output. The displays change similarly as<br>
the other letters of the word "think" are entered.<br>
In figure 46, the distinction between letters in and<br>
not in visual cache is marked by writing letters in the<br>
visual cache in upper case letters, while letters not in<br>
visual cache are displayed using lower-case letters. For<br>
our reference statistics, we find that 42 percent of<br>
first letters of words are either a,i,o, or t. Thus 42<br>
percent of the time a user beginning to enter a word will<br>
find the required letter immediately in cache.<br>
As a word is entered the most-likely next letter<br>
changes as context is created by the entering of the<br>
word. Thus, the letter selected to be cached should<br>
change as a word is entered, and will depend on which<br>
word is being entered.<br>
In the case of the word "think" The letter "t" is<br>
found in visual cache both before activation of the first<br>
input means, and before activation of the second input<br>
means, as shown in the first four rows of figure 46, each<br>
row corresponding to an input means display. Once "t" has<br>
been selected. The letters in visual cache are a,h,o,w,<br>
as shown in the second set of 4 rows in figure 46. After<br>
the first input means (input means 2101) is selected to<br>
begin entering the letter "h", there are only two<br>
possible letters which form parts of words according to<br>
the reference statistics, these are the letters "h" and<br>
"i", both of these appear in visual cache in the second<br>
display. Continuing in this way for the letters, i,n,k,<br>
we find that the desired letter is always in visual cache<br>
for this word. Indeed, after the first input means<br>
manipulation for entering the letter "i", there is only<br>
one possible letter which could have been intended if the<br>
user is in fact entering a word in the database. In this<br>
case, then, a second input means manipulation is<br>
redundant, and the letter "i" could be output immediately<br>
after the first input means manipulation.<br>
Explicit disambiguation and inputting of additional<br>
symbols. As has already been pointed out, it is<br>
generally desirable to provide a completely unambiguous<br>
method for inputting symbols in a typable device based on<br>
ambiguous codes. In the present embodiment, one simple<br>
way to provide unambiguous input is by provision of an<br>
additional unambiguous input means 2105 shown in figure<br>
41 in a position where it is easily activatable by the<br>
thumb, which is the preferred position. Other positions,<br>
however, could be chosen.<br>
In the present embodiment, it was chosen to limit<br>
the size of second-level subsets to at most 2 symbols.<br>
Thus the disambiguation mechanism will always either<br>
choose the desired symbol correctly, or it will chose the<br>
other, incorrect, symbol to which it is paired. Any<br>
disambiguation software could generate a signal to<br>
indicate which of the two symbols it would choose were<br>
the corresponding input means to be selected by the user.<br>
This signal could be used to provide feedback to the<br>
user, for instance by highlighting the letter to be<br>
chosen. If the letter to be chosen is not the desired<br>
letter, the user has the option of activating the<br>
explicit disambiguation input means 2105 shown in<br>
figure 41 to force the choice of the other, non-<br>
highlighted symbol.<br>
An example use of this unambiguous text.entry-<br>
mechanism is shown in figure 47. As in figures 45 and<br>
46, this figure shows how the word "think" is entered.<br>
Here the fourth column gives the letter that would be<br>
output were the unambiguous input means 2105 to be<br>
activated after activation of the first and second input<br>
means used to enter the letters of the word "think". For<br>
example, if input means 2103 and then input means 2101<br>
had been activated to enter the letter "t", then further<br>
activation of input means 2105 would select the letter<br>
"u". Then "u" would become the first letter of the word.<br>
All possible letters can be entered unambiguously in this<br>
way. When the second-level subsets contain but one<br>
letter, this one letter will be entered unambiguously<br>
even without activation of the input means 2105, and thus<br>
input means 2105 is inapplicable. For the given code,<br>
the letters d,f,h,l,n, and p are always entered<br>
unambiguously.<br>
Strong Touch Typabilityt Measurement and Thresholds<br>
Strong touch typablity is a new, inventive concept<br>
describing a definite class of machines. The breadth of<br>
this concept has been pointed out through a variety of<br>
embodiments placed near the boundaries of this class, and<br>
thus indicating its extent.<br>
To further add definiteness to the disclosure of<br>
strong touch typability, this section will present an<br>
alternative numerical characterization of strong touch<br>
typability which will allow the strong touch typability<br>
of any ambiguous code to be measured, and to thus decide<br>
if that code falls within the scope of this invention or<br>
not.<br>
Language Statistics It has already been mentioned that<br>
representing a language in terms of a corpus of text is a<br>
topic of research among linguists. For the sake of<br>
numerical definiteness, define a representative corpus<br>
as a collection of at least 10 million words drawn at<br>
random from a general-interest newspaper in the target<br>
language.<br>
Key Number We need to define four kinds of key numbers:<br>
physical key number, chording key number, effective key<br>
number, and combined effective key number. Physical key<br>
number: the number of inputs used to encode symbols. A<br>
minimal qwerty keyboard has 26 keys labeled with a<br>
letter, a shift key and a space key, it thus has a<br>
physical key number of 28. Chording key number: the<br>
number of distinct combinations of keys which encode<br>
symbols. For the minimal qwerty keyboard, the shift key<br>
can be combined with any of the letter keys to form a<br>
capital letter, therefore this keyboard has a chording<br>
key number of 28+26-1=53, since the shift key alone does<br>
not encode any symbols. Otherwise said, a keyboard which<br>
is fully equivalent to the minimal qwerty keyboard<br>
could be build with 53 physical keys, each one encoding a<br>
single symbol, either an upper case or a lower case<br>
letter. Indeed, some early typewriters were of this<br>
structure.<br>
Effective key number: Given a set of symbols to<br>
represent in an ambiguous code, a set of language<br>
statistics, and a number of physical keys, P, there<br>
exists an optimal ambiguous code which has the best<br>
possible lookup and query rates, given that these are the<br>
only constraints on the code. Let us call these rates Pi<br>
and Pg respectively. Any ambiguous code on any number of<br>
physical keys will have an effective key number of P if<br>
its lookup rates and query rates are equal to Pi and Pq.<br>
It is impossible for a keyboard with a physical number of<br>
keys less than P to support an ambiguous code with an<br>
effective key number equal to or greater than P. It is<br>
perfectly possible, and usually the case, that an<br>
ambiguous code on a physical number of keys P has an<br>
effective key number less than P. Combined effective key<br>
number: it is an experimental observation that the lookup<br>
error rates and query rates of substantially optimal<br>
ambiguous codes are substantially related by a power law,<br>
as shown for example, by the experimental results of<br>
figure 11. Here it is shown that for English, the log<br>
of the substantially optimal query rate is linearly<br>
related to the log of the substantially optimal lookup<br>
rate.<br>
This observation allows us to define a single number<br>
relating the lookup error rate and query rate of a code:<br>
the projection of the point (lookup error rate, query<br>
rate) of the code onto the best-fit line in a log-log<br>
plot.<br>
Consider, for example, the standard ambiguous code.<br>
This code has (lookup error rate, query rate) of<br>
(29,2.2). Projecting this point onto the best-fit line of<br>
figure 11 and linearly interpolating, we find the value<br>
5.96, which is thus the combined effective key number of<br>
the standard ambiguous code. Though the standard<br>
ambiguous code is defined on 8 physical keys (and with a<br>
chording key number also of 8, since no chording is<br>
involved), it is equivalent in ambiguity to a substantial<br>
optimal code on 5.96 physical (or chording) keys. Of<br>
course fractional physical keys are not possible in<br>
practice, but these results indicate that a substantially<br>
optimal code on 6 keys could be found which has lookup<br>
error rates and query rates better than the standard<br>
ambiguous code.<br>
These considerations allow us to define a precise,<br>
albeit arbitrary, numerical threshold for substantial<br>
optimality of combined lookup error rate and query rates:<br>
a code will be said to be substantial optimal with<br>
respect to these rates if its combined effective key<br>
number is within 0.01 of its chording key number, if<br>
there are no other ergonomic constraints on the system.<br>
We can also define a precise, albeit arbitrary, threshold<br>
for strong touch typability: an ambiguous code for<br>
English can be defined as strongly touch typable if its<br>
combined effective key number is at least 10. We can<br>
extend this definition to other languages by requiring<br>
that for a code to be strongly touch typable, it must<br>
have a lookup error rate and a query rate greater than or<br>
equal to those of a strongly touch typable code for<br>
English. Since the combined effective key number of the<br>
standard ambiguous code is less than 10, it is not<br>
strongly touch typable by the considerations of this<br>
section.<br>
By measuring the combined effective key number,<br>
any ambiguous code can be screened for possession of the<br>
strong touch typability property. For instance, the<br>
hybrid chording/ambiguous code: ab c df e gi h jk 1 mo n<br>
pqr s uv t vxz y discussed above has 9 physical keys: the<br>
8 letter keys of the standard telephone keypad plus 1<br>
shift key. It has a chording key number of 16; it is<br>
equivalent to an ambiguous code on 16 independent keys<br>
with no shift key. Without application of a gap factor,<br>
its (lookup,query) rates are (431,21) corresponding<br>
to a combined effective key number of 12.8. With<br>
a gap factor of 500, this improves to (440,46),<br>
corresponding to a combined effective key number of<br>
13.75. With or without a gap factor, this code is<br>
strongly touch typable. It should be noted that the<br>
combined effective key number is less than the chording<br>
key number, still, this code is substantially optimal<br>
given the additional constraint of alphabetic ordering.<br>
In the same way, the one-handed hybrid chording/<br>
ambiguous code embodiment has a code with (lookup, query)<br>
rates of (1100,69), yielding a combined effective key<br>
number of 15, though its physical key number is 4 and its<br>
chording key number is 16. It is a strongly touch typable<br>
code, and the difference between the chording key number<br>
and combined effective key number is due to the<br>
additional ergonomic constraint of alphabetic ordering<br>
of the first-level code. Taking into account this<br>
additional constraint, the code is substantially optimal.<br>
By contrast, the 14-physical key code of Fujitsu, pn gt<br>
cr zk wj a e hi so ud xf yxn vl gb, has (lookup, query)<br>
rates of (105,4), and a combined effective key number of<br>
8.47. This code is neither substantially optimal<br>
nor strongly touch typable, despite the fact that its<br>
physical number of keys is greater than 10.<br>
Although illustrative embodiments of the present<br>
invention have been described herein with reference to<br>
the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that<br>
the invention is not limited to those precise<br>
embodiments, and that various other changes and<br>
modifications may be effected therein by one skilled in<br>
the art without departing from the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>

numerous ergonomic problems. Solutions for these problems are herein disclosed. This invention teaches methods for the selection of<br>
ambiguous codes (6001) from the classes of strongly-touch-typable ambigous codes (6001) and substantially optimal ambiguous codes<br>
(6001) for touch-typable devices such as computers, telephones, pagers, personal digital assistants, smart cards, television set-top devices<br>
and other information appliances, given design constraints such as the size, shape, and computational capacity of the device, the typical<br>
uses of the device, and conventional contraints such as respect of alphabetic ordering or Qwerty ordering.</td>
