Background of the Invention<br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
 <br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The 2,4-diamino pyrimidine moiety (1) is a common component in a variety of biologically active drug-like molecules. Pyrimidine derivatives have been found to be useful in<br>
i<br>
the treatment of abnormal cell growth, such as cancer, in mammals. These moieties are commonly synthesized starting with pyrimidine intermediated (where "X" is a leaving group; most commonly a halogen) and an equivalent of amine 3, HNR3R4 (see Scheme 1 below). For the vast majority of reactions involving pyrimidines of formula 2 and amines of formula 3, it is well known that this first amine addition occurs preferentially (or exclusively) at the more reactive pyrimidine 4-position (Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds, The Pyrimidines, Volume 52, Wiley, New York 1994, p.371.) to provide intermediate 4. The primary factors that influence the selectivity of this initial amine addition are the stereoelectronic effects associated with substituents present in both pyrimidine 2 and amine 3 and to a lesser extent the reaction solvent. Subsequent heating of 4 with a second amine (5) provides the desired 2,4-diaminopyrimidine 1.<br>
A representative example of the aforementioned chemistry can be found in WO00391901 and is highlighted in Scheme 2. Other examples utilizing this general synthetic scheme include Montebugnoli et. al. Tetrahedron 2002, (58), p. 2147. Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds, The Pyrimidines, Volume 52, Wiley, New York 1994, pp. 371-417. Selective amine addition to 2)4-dichloro-5-carboxamidopyrimidines is described in WO 02/04429. Selective amine additions to 2,4-dichloro-5-halopyrimidines are described in WO 01/65655.<br>
 <br>
SCHEME 2<br>
 <br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
While there are a number of general examples where specific pyrimidines (2), amines 
 <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
An example of such a reaction that provides mixtures of isomers is the addition of 4-methyl-aniline to 2,4-dichloro-5-trifluoromethylpyrimidine (Scheme 4). This electron deficient pyrimidine has a slight preference for amine addition to the pyrimidine 2-position. HPLC analysis of the crude reaction mixture shows a 1.4 to 1 mixture of and (4-Chloro-5-trifluoromethyl-pyrimidin-2-yl)-p-tolyl-amine (8) and (2-Chloro-5-trifluoromethyl-pyrirnidin-4-yl)-p-tolyl-amine (9). Other examples of non-selective amine addition to 2,4 di-halogenopyrimidines are described in Chemistry of Heierocyclic Compounds, The Pyrimidines, Volume 52, Wiley, New York 1994, pp. 371-417. Luo et. al. Tetrahedron Lett. 2002, (43) p. 5739. Yoshida et. al. J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. I: Organic and Bioorganic<br>
 <br>
Chemistry,   1992  (7) p.  919.     EP 647639 describes  additions  of piperidines  to 2,4-dichloropyrimidine.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
In contrast to the reactions described above, there are only a few very specific examples where an amine (3) is added to a pyrimidine of formula 2 in a selective manner to provide preferentially the 2-amino-4-chloro-pyrimidine 64 The most notable example of this type of reaction is the addition of N-methyl piperidine to 2,4-dichloro-5-methyl pyrimidine to provide 4-chloro-5-methyl-2-piperidinopyrimidine (Scheme 5) found in Yoshida et. al. J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. I: Organic and Bioorganic Chemistry, 1992 (7) p.919. In this case, the steric effect of the 5-methyl substituent on the pyrimidine coupled with the fact that the amine nucleophile is a tertiary (rather than a primary or secondary) amine provides for selective addition of piperidine to the pyrimidine 2-position.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It has been surprisingly found that by adding a Lewis acid to the reaction medium, one can selectively add an amine functionality to the C-2 position of a CF3 substituted-pyrimidine ring. Thus, the present invention relates to a process of making a compound of the formula 11<br>

 <br>
R3 and R4 are substituents independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, an aromatic group and an aliphatic group; or taken together -NR3R* can form a 4-1 1 membered aromatic or aliphatic ring;<br>
wherein the process comprises reacting a compound of formula 10<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
with an amine of formula 3 (HNR3R4) in the presence of a Lewis Acid and a non-nucleophilic base to form a compound of formula 11, wherein X1 is a leaving group such as a halide, aryisulfonate, alkylsulfonate, perfluoroalkylsulfonate. arylsulfmate or alkylsulfmate. &gt;<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Compounds of the formula 11 can be prepared by reaction of pyrimidine 10 and a<br>
primary or secondary amine nucleophile (3) in the presence of a Lewis acid and a non-<br>
nucleophilic base in an organic solvent or mixture of solvents. Leaving groups (X1, X2, which<br>
may be the same or different) on pyrimidine 10 suitable for displacement, include but are not<br>
limited to halides, sulfonates and sulfinates. Preferentially, each leaving group is a halide. In<br>
a further preferred embodiment, the halide is chloride. Suitable primary and secondary amine<br>
nucleophiles include aromatic, aliphatic or cyclic amines as described above.   Lewis acids<br>
include but are not limited to the salts of Zn, Mg, Sn, Ti, Al, B, Li, Ag, Na, K, Ca, Va, Cr, Mn,<br>
Fe, Co, Ni, In, Zr, Sm and Cu.  In a preferred embodiment, salts of Zn, Mg, Sn, Ti, Al, B, Li,<br>
Ag, and Cu are preferred.   Most preferably, a salt of Zn or Mg is used as the Lewis acid.<br>
Suitable equivalents of Lewis Acid relative to pyrimidine 10 necessary to effect selective<br>
amine addition range from 0.25-10 equivalents, and preferably 0.5-3 equivalents when the<br>
amine nucleophile is aromatic or 0.5-10 equivalents, and preferably 1-4 equivalents when the<br>
amine is aliphatic (or an aromatic amine capable of forming a multidentate ligand with the<br>
Lewis Acid).    Suitable organic solvents include but are not limited tetrahydrofuran, 1,2-<br>
dichloroethane,  /-butanol,  ether,  methylene  chloride,  acetonitrile,  methanol,   ethanol,  2-<br>
propanol, dioxane,  1,2-dimethoxyethane,  toluene,  chloroform, ethyl acetate or mixtures<br>
 <br>
thereof, preferably a mixture of a halogenated and alcoholic solvents. Suitable non-nucleophilic bases include but are not limited to triethylamine, N, N-diisopropyl-ethylamine, diaza-bicyloundecene (DBU) or resin bound bases such as MP-Carbonate. Temperatures for this process range from -30°C to 50°C; preferably the reaction is run at 0°C to room temperature.<br>
The reaction may be carried out in a single step or in several sequential steps, without any adverse effect on the overall yield or selectivity of the reaction.<br>
Compounds of the formula 11, when combined with a primary or secondary amine<br>
HNR5R6 (5) are useful in the preparation of compounds of formula 12, where R6 and R6<br>
independently represent hydrogen, an aromatic group or an aliphatic group, or NR5R6 taken<br>
together can form a 4-1 1 membered aromatic or aliphatic ring.  Alternatively, compounds of<br>
formula 11 are useful in the preparation of compounds of formula 13a or 13b by addition of an<br>
oxygen or sulfur nucleophile, respectively. Compounds of formula 11 (where X is a halide or<br>
perfluoroalkylsulfonate) are also useful in preparing compounds of formula 14 or 15a/b,<br>
wherein R7 is an aromatic or an aliphatic group, via palladium catalyzed carbon-carbon bond<br>
formation.<br>

Compounds of formula 12-15 are useful for example, in the treatment of abnormal cell growth, such as cancer, in mammals. For example, compounds 12-15 are inhibitors of protein kinases. In particular, compound of formula 12 are selective inhibitors of certain receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases, e.g., FAK (focal adhesion kinase). Compounds such as these are described in U.S. Patent Application Serial Nos. 1 0/734, 039(Attorney docket number PC25339) and 10/733215 (Attorney docket number PC25937).<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples illustrate the preparation of the compounds of the present invention. NMR data are reported in parts per million and are referenced to the deuterium lock signal from the sample solvent. Commercial reagents were utilized without further purification. THF refers to tetrahydrofuran and DMF refers to N,N-dimethylformamide. Chromatography refers to column chromatography performed using .040 mm silica gel and executed under flash chromatography conditions. Low Resolution Mass Spectra (LRMS) were recorded on a Fisons Atmospheric Pressure Chemical lonization platform, which uses a 50/50 mixture of acetonitrile/water with 0.1% formic acid as the ionizing agent. All non-<br>
 <br>
aqueous reactions were run under a nitrogen atmosphere for convenience and to maximize yields. Concentration under reduced pressure means that a rotary evaporator was used. Aromatic or aliphatic amine nucleophiles were either purchased and used without further purification or prepared by standard methods of amine synthesis known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Where analytical HPLC chromatography is referred to in the preparations and examples below, the general conditions used, unless otherwise indicated, are as follows. The column used is a ZORBAX RXC18 column (manufactured by Hewlett Packard) of 150 mm distance and 4.6 mm interior diameter. The samples are run on a Hewlett Packard-1100 system. A gradient solvent method is used running 100 percent ammonium acetate / acetic acid buffer (0.2 M) to 100 percent acetonitrile over 10 minutes. The system then proceeds on a wash cycle with 100 percent acetonitrile for 1.5 minutes and then 100 percent buffer solution for 3 minutes. The flow rate over this period is a constant 3 mL/ minute.<br>
Example 1 Preparation of 2,4-dichloro-5-trifluoromethylpyrimidine: 5-Trifluoromethyluracil<br>
(250g, 1.39 mol) and phosphorous oxychloride (655 mL, 6.94 mol, 5 equiv) were<br>
charged to a 3L 4-neck flask equipped with overhead stirrer, a reflux condenser, an addition<br>
funnel and an internal theromocouple. The contents were maintained under a nitrogen<br>
atmosphere as concentrated phosphoric acid (85 wt%, 9.5 mL, 0.1 equiv) was added in one<br>
portion to the slurry, resulting in a moderate exotherm. Diisopropylethylamine (245 mL, 1.39<br>
mol, 1 equiv) was then added dropwise over 15 min at such a rate that the internal<br>
temperature of the reaction reached 85-90 °C by the end of the addition. By the end of the<br>
amine addition the reaction mixture was a homogenous light-orange solution. Heating was<br>
initiated and the orange solution was maintained at 100 °C for 20h, at which time HPLC<br>
analysis of the reaction mixture indicated that the starting material was consumed. External<br>
heating was removed and the contents of the flask were cooled to 40 °C and then added<br>
dropwise to a cooled mixture of 3N HCI (5 L, 10 equiv) and diethyl ether (2L) keeping the<br>
temperature of the quench pot between 10 and 15 °C. The layers were separated, and the<br>
aqueous layer was extracted once with ether (1L). The combined organic layers were<br>
combined, washed with water until the washes were neutral (5 x 1.5L washes), dried with<br>
MgSO4 and concentrated to provide 288g (95% yield) of a light yellow-orange oil of 96%<br>
purity (HPLC). This material can be further purified by distillation (bp 109 °C at 79 mmHg).<br>
Example 2:<br>
General procedure for non-selective amine addition:<br>
Method A: A mixture of (2-Chloro-5-trifluoromethyl-pyrimidin-4-yl)-p-tolyl-amine (9) and (4-Chloro-5-trifluoromethyl-pyrimidin-2-yl)-p-tolyl-amine (8) To a solution of 5-trifluoromethyl-2,4-dichloropyrimidine (500 mg; 2.3 mmol) in DCE/t-butanol 
 <br>
