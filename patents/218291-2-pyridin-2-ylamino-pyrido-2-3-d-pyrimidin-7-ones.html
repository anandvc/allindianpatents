				<td>This invention relates to substituted 2-amino pyridines that are potent inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 4. The compounds of the invention are useful for the treatment of inflammation, and cell proliferative diseases such as cancer and restenosis.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Cyclin-dependent kinases and related serine/threonine protein kinases are important cellular enzymes that perform essential functions in regulating cell division and proliferation. The cyclin-dependent kinase catalytic units are activated by regulatory subunits known as cyclins. At least 16 mammalian cyclins have been identified (Johnson D.G. and Walker C.L., Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999;39:295-312). Cyclin B/cdkl, Cyclin A/cdk2, Cyclin E/cdk2, Cyclin D/cdk4, Cyclin D/Cdk6, and probably other heterodimers including Cdk3 and Cdk7 are important regulators of cell cycle progression. Additional functions of Cyclin/Cdk heterodimers include regulation of transcription, DNA repair, differentiation and apoptosis (Morgan D.O., Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1997; 13261-13291).<br>
Increased activity or temporally abnormal activation of cyclin-dependent kinases has been shown to result in the development of human tumors (Sherr C.J., Science 1996;274:1672-1677). Indeed, human tumor development is commonly associated with alterations in either the Cdk proteins themselves or their regulators (Cordon-Cardo C, Am. J. Pathol. 1995;147:545-560; Karp J. E. and Broder S., Nat. Med. 1995;1:309-320; Hall M. et al., Adv. Cancer Res. 1996;68:67-108). Naturally occurring protein inhibitors of Cdks such as pl6 and p27 cause growth inhibition in vitro in lung cancer cell lines (Kamb A., Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998;227:139-148).<br>
Small molecule Cdk inhibitors may also be used in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders such as restenosis and atherosclerosis and other vascular<br>
disorders that are due to aberrant cell proliferation. Vascular smooth muscle<br>
proliferation and intimal hyperplasia following balloon angioplasty are inhibited by<br>
over-expfession of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor protein p21 (Chang M.W.et<br>
al., J. Clin. Invest, 1995;96:2260; Yang Z-Y. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA)<br>
1996;93:9905. Moreover, the purine cdk2 inhibitor CVT-313 (Ki = 95 nM) resulted in<br>
greater than 80% inhibition of neointima formation in rats (Brooks E.E. et al., J. Biol.<br>
Chem. 1997:29207-29211).<br>
Cdk inhibitors can be used to treat diseases caused by a variety of infectious agents, including fungi, protozoan parasites such as Plasmodium falciparum, and DNA and RNA viruses. For example, cyclin-dependent kinases are required for viral replication following infection by herpes simplex virus (HSV) (Schang L.M. et al., J. Virol. 1998;72:5626) and Cdk homologs are known to play essential roles in yeast.<br>
Selective Cdk inhibitors can be used to ameliorate the effects of various autoimmune disorders. Chronic inflammatory disease rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by synovial tissue hyperplasia; inhibition of synovial tissue proliferation should minimize inflammation and prevent joint destruction. Expression of the Cdk inhibitor protein pl6 in synovial fibroblasts led to growth inhibition (Taniguchi K. et al., Nat. Med. 1999;5:760-767). Similarly, in a rat model of arthritis, joint swelling was substantially inhibited by treatment with a p16 expressing adenovirus. Cdk inhibitors may be effective against other disorders of cell proliferation including psoriasis (characterized by keratinocyte hyperproliferation), glomerulonephritis, and lupus.<br>
Certain Cdk inhibitors may be useful as chemoprotective agents through their ability to inhibit cell cycle progression of normal untransformed cells (Chen et al. J. Natl. Cancer Institute, 2000;92:1999-2008). Pre-treatment of a cancer patient with a Cdk inhibitor prior to the use of cytotoxic agents can reduce the side effects commonly associated with chemotherapy. Normal proliferating tissues are protected from the cytotoxic effects by the action of the selective Cdk inhibitor.<br>
Review articles on small molecule inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases have noted the difficulty of identifying compounds that inhibit specific Cdk proteins without inhibiting other enzymes. Thus, despite their potential to treat a variety of diseases, no Cdk inhibitors are currently approved for commercial use (Fischer, P. M., Curr. Opin. Drug Discovery 2001,4, 623-634; Fry, D. W. &amp; Garrett, M. D. Curr.<br>
Opin. Oncologic, Endocrine &amp; Metabolic Invest. 2000, 2,40-59; Webster, K. R. &amp; Kimball, D. Emerging Drugs 2000,5,45-59; Sielecki, T. M. et al. J. Med. Chan. 2000,43,1-18.).<br>

This invention identifies 2-(2'-pyridyl) pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidinones as compounds that are useful for treating uncontrolled cell proliferative diseases, including,, but not limited to, proliferative diseases such as cancer, restenosis and rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, these compounds are useful for treating inflammation and inflammatory diseases. In addition, these compounds have utility as antiinfective agents. Moreover, these compounds have utility as chemoprotective agents through their ability to inhibit the cell cycle progression of normal untransformed cells. Many of the compounds of the invention display unexpected improvements in selectivity for the serine/threonine kinases cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and cyclin-dependent kinase 6. The compounds are readily synthesized and can be administered to patients by a variety of methods.<br>
Compounds of formula I may contain chiral centers and therefore may exist in different enantiomeric and diastereomeric forms. This invention relates to all optical isomers and all stereoisomers of compounds of the formula I, both as racemic mixtures and as individual enantiomers and diastereoismers of such compounds, and mixtures thereof, and to all pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treatment defined above that contain or employ them, respectively.<br>
As the compounds of formula I of this invention may possess at least two asymmetric centers, they are capable of occurring in various stereoisomeric forms or configurations. Hence, the compounds can exist in separated (+)- and (-)-optically active forms, as well as mixtures thereof. The present invention includes all such forms within its scope. Individual isomers can be obtained by known methods, such as optical resolution, optically selective reaction, or chromatographic separation in the preparation of the final product or its intermediate.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can exist in unsolvated forms as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms. In general, the solvated forms, including hydrated forms, are equivalent to unsolvated forms and are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The present invention also includes isotopically labelled compounds, which are identical to those recited in formula I, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the present invention include isotopes of hydrogen,<br>
carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, sulfrir, fluorine and chlorine, such as 2H, 3H, 13C, nC, 14C, 15N, 18O,17O,31P, 32P, 35S, 18F, and 36C1, respectively. Compounds of thepresent-inventionrpfodrugsthereofi-and-pharmaceutically-acceptablesaltsof-said compounds or of said prodrugs which contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically labelled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H and 14C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated, i.e, 3H, and carbon-14, i.e., 14C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labelled compounds of formula I of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples and Preparations below, by substituting a readily available isotopically labelled reagent for a non-isotopically labelled reagent.<br>
The compounds of Formula I are capable of further forming pharmaceutically acceptable formulations comprising salts, including but not limited to acid addition and/or base salts, solvents and N-oxides of a compound of Formula I.<br>
This invention also provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I or a therapeutically acceptable salt thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient therefor. All of these forms are within the present invention.<br>

The term "treating", as used herein, refers to reversing, alleviating, inhibiting<br>
the progress of, or preventing the disorder or condition to which such term applies, or<br>
preventing one or more symptoms of such condition or disorder. The term<br>
"treatment", as used herein, refers to the act of treating, as "treating" is defined<br>
immediately above.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, amides, and prodrugs" as<br>
used herein refers to those carboxylate salts, amino acid addition salts, esters, amides,<br>
and prodrugs of the compounds of the present invention which are, within the scope<br>
of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of patients<br>
without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate with a<br>
reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use, as well as the<br>
zwitterionic forms, where possible, of the compounds of the invention.<br>
The term "salts" refers to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic acid<br>
addition salts of compounds of the present invention. These salts can be prepared<br>
in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds or by separately<br>
reacting the purified compound in its free base form with a suitable organic or<br>
inorganic acid and isolating the salt thus formed. In so far as the compounds of<br>
formula I of this invention are basic compounds, they are all capable of forming a<br>
wide variety of different salts with various inorganic and organic acids. Although<br>
such salts must be pharmaceutically acceptable for administration to animals, it is<br>
often desirable in practice to initially isolate the base compound from the reaction<br>
mixture as a pharmaceutically unacceptable salt and then simply convert to the free<br>
base compound by treatment with an alkaline reagent and thereafter convert the free<br>
base to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The acid addition salts of the basic compounds are prepared by contacting the free base form with a sufficient amount of the desired"acid"toproducelhe" salt in theconventional manner The free~ base form may be regenerated by contacting the salt form with a base and isolating the free base in the conventional manner. The free base forms differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to their respective free base for purposes of the present invention.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts are formed with metals or amines, such as alkali and alkaline earth metal hydroxides, or of organic amines. Examples of metals used as cations are sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and the like. Examples of suitable amines are N.N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine, and procaine; see, for example, Berge et al., supra.<br>
The base addition salts of acidic compounds are prepared by contacting the free acid form with a sufficient amount of the desired base to produce the salt in the conventional manner. The free acid form may be regenerated by contacting the salt form with an acid and isolating the free acid in a conventional manner. The free acid forms differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to their respective free acid for purposes of the present invention.<br>
Salts may be prepared from inorganic acids sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, nitrate, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, chloride, bromide, iodide such as hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, hydrobromic, hydriodic, phosphorus, and the like. Representative salts include the hydrobromide, hydrochloride, sulfate, bisulfate, nitrate, acetate, oxalate, valerate, oleate, palmitate, stearate, laurate, borate, benzoate, lactate, phosphate, tosylate, citrate, maleate, fumarate, succinate, tartrate, naphthylate mesylate, glucoheptonate, lactobionate, laurylsulphonate and isethionate salts and the like. Salts may also be prepared from organic acids, such as aliphatic mono- and dicarboxylic acids, phenyl-substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic acids, alkanedioic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids, etc. and the like. Representative salts include acetate, propionate, caprylate, isobutyrate, oxalate,<br>
malonate, succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate, maleate, mandelate, benzoate, chlorobenzoate, methylbenzoate, dinitrobenzoate, phthalate, benzenesulfonate, toluenesulfonate, phenylacetate, citrate, lactate, maleate, tartrate, methanesulfonate.._ and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may include cations based on the alkali and alkaline earth metals, such as sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and the like, as well as non-toxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations including, but not limited to, ammonium, tetramethylammonium, tetraethylammonium, methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, ethylamine, and the like. Also contemplated are the salts of amino acids such as arginate, gluconate, galacturonate, and the like. (See, for example, Berge S.M. et al., "Pharmaceutical Salts," /. Phann. Set, 1977;66:1-19 which is incorporated herein by reference.)<br>
Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable, non-toxic esters of the compounds of this invention include C1-C6 alkyl esters wherein the alkyl group is a straight or<br>
branched chain. Acceptable esters also include C5-C7 cycloalkyl esters as well as<br>
arylalkyl esters such as, but not limited to benzyl. C1-C4 alkyl esters are preferred.<br>
Esters of the compounds of the present invention may be prepared according to conventional methods "March's Advanced Organic Chemistry, 5th Edition". M. B. Smith &amp; J. March, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2001.<br>
Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable, non-toxic amides of the compounds of this invention include amides derived from ammonia, primary C1-C6 alkyl amines<br>
and secondary C1-C6 dialkyl amines wherein the alkyl groups are straight or branched<br>
chain. In the case of secondary amines the amine may also be in the form of a 5- or 6-membered heterocycle containing one nitrogen atom. Amides derived from ammonia, C1-C3 alkyl primary amines and C1-C2 dialkyl secondary amines are preferred. Amides of the compounds of the invention may be prepared according to conventional methods such as "March's Advanced Organic Chemistry, 5th Edition". M. B. Smith &amp; J.

DETADLED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
An illustration of the preparation of compounds of the present invention is shown in Schemes 1 to 13.<br>
Synthesis<br>
The compounds of the invention may be prepared according to the general Scheme 1. The assembly of components A and B generally requires their combination in a suitable solvent such as DMSO, toluene or pyridine, and heating of this mixture to 80-140 °C. A subsequent deprotection step may be required depending on the nature of substituent R4. Scheme 1<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
Synthesis of the sulfoxides represented by the structure A has been described previously in PCT applications WO 98/33798 and WO 01/70741. Such intermediates are assembled via established and published protocols (Barvian et al., J. Med. Chem. 2000,43,4606-4616) starting from the commercially available pyrimidine, 4-chloro-2-methylsulfanyl-pyrimidine-5-carboxylic acid ethyl ester. The pyridine derivatives B where X1 = X2 = X3 = hydrogen can be prepared from commercially available 5-bromo-2-nitropyridine by base or palladium promoted displacement of the bromine by<br>
a nucleophile such as an alcohol or a primary or secondary amine, followed by reduction of the nitro group. A representative example of this method is illustrated in Scheme 2 examples of bases that may be used for this reaction include K2CO3, or <br>
Na2CO3. These bases may be used in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst such as BU4NI. Palladium promoted reactions are typically performed with catalysts such as Pd(OAc)2, Pd2(dba)3, or Pd(PPh3)4 and the like in nonpolar organic solvents such benzene, toluene, tetrahydrofuran or acetonitrile at temperatures from 25 - 110 °C. These catalysts are typically employed with a suitable ligand such as suitable ligand, such as BTNAP, Xantphos or a related phosphine-based Pd ligand. Reduction of the nitro group is typically performed using Raney Nickel although other reducing agents also may be used including palladium on charcoal or Fe/HCl.<br>
Scheme 2<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
When at least one of X1, X2, or X3 is not hydrogen, the pyridine derivatives B are prepared by methods known to those in the art. Examples of representative procedures may be found in Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry, Eds. A. R. Katritzky, C. W. Rees, 1984, Pergamon, NY; Volume 2, Chapter 2.08, Pyridines and their Benzoderivatives: Synthesis, Gurnos Jones. Also, refer to Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry H, Eds. A. R. Katritzky, C. W. Rees., E. Scriven, 1996, Pergamon, NY; Volume 25, Chapter 5.05, Pyridines and their Benzoderivatives: Synthesis, Gurnos Jones. Representative examples are illustrated in Scheme 3.<br><br>
Scheme 3.<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
An alternate route to access compounds of the present invention involves conversion of the pyridopyrimidine core fragment to a pyridopyrimidine C-2 amine as shown in Scheme 4 and employment of this amine as a nucleophile to displace a leaving group such as bromide or iodide from a pyridine fragment. This reaction proceeds with palladium catalysis to provide the target compounds in equivalent yields to the route shown in Scheme 1. Examples of palladium catalysts that may be employed in this reaction include Pd(OAc)2, Pd2(dba)3, or Pd(PPh3)4, and PdCl2(PPh3)2. These catalysts are typically employed with a suitable ligand, such as BINAP, Xantphos or a related phosphine-based Pd ligand. Typical solvents include dimethoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile and toluene. Reactions are typically performed at temperatures between 25 °C and 160 °C. In some cases, the reaction is accelerated by the presence of electron withdrawing substituents ortho to the leaving group on the pyridine ring (Jonckers, T. H. M. et al. Tetrahedron 2001, 57,7027-7034).<br>
Scheme 4<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
In another alternate route to compounds of the present invention, the pyridine fragment is converted to a guanidine and condensed with an appropriate partner to<br>
produce the pyrimidine ring via a condensation reaction (Scheme 5). This condensation reaction typically requires heating the reaction components at concentrations of 0.5 M to 2 M in a suitable non-polar organic solvent such. as chlorobenzene, nitrobenzene, or Dowtherm to a temperature in the range of 100- 200 °C.<br>
Scheme 5<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
In addition, synthesis of compounds of the instant invention may proceed through substituted pyrimidine intermediates such as those shown in Schemes 6-13. Thus, in Scheme 6, a 4-amino, 5-halo-pyrimidine sulfide is converted directly to a pyridopyrimidinone using chemistry introduced by Piers (e.g. Piers, E. McEachern, E. J. and Romero, M. A. J. Org. Chem. 1997, 62, 6034-6040). Alternatively, the side-chain pyridyl-amine is installed through displacement of a sulfoxide at the C2 position using standard procedures (see above), and then the pyridopyrimidinone is built-up via a Stille coupling and a ring closure reaction. Similar chemistry is employed is Schemes 7 starting with a 2-chloropyrimidine. The Stille reactions in Schemes 6 and 7 are typically performed under palladium catalysis using reagents such as Pd(OAc)2, Pd2(dba)3, or Pd(PPh3)4, and PdCl2(PPh3)2. Typical solvents include dimethoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile and toluene which may be warmed during the reaction to temperatures in the range of 100-200 °C. Ring closure occurs spontaneously or with gentle warming in a suitable organic solvent to a temperature less than 100 °C. Installation of the C2 side chain in Scheme 7 typically proceeds with catalysis by POPd, Pd(OAc)2 or Pd2dba3 and a suitable ligand, such as BINAP, Xantphos or a related phosphine-based Pd ligand.<br>
Scheme 6	.<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
Another way to build the pyridone ring is to start with an aldehyde or ketone at the C5 position of a simple substituted 4-aminopyrimidine and to perform Wittig, Horner-Wadsworth Emmons, Knoevenagel or related chemistry such as enloate anion chemistry to install the C4-C5 double bond of the pyridopyrimidinone system. These reactions proceed under conditions that would be well known to one skilled in the art, with the employment of a suitable base such as NaH, NaOEt, LDA, BuLi, HMDS and the like. Ring closure typically occurs spontaneously under the reaction conditions when the double bond geometry is such that the pyrimidine and the ester are placed in a cis relationship across the newly formed double bond. Otherwise gentle warming in a suitable organic solvent to a temperature less than 100 °C may be required to promote ring closure. When the double bond geometry is such that the pyrimidine and the ester are placed in a trans relationship across the double bond, ring closure can be driven by double bond isomerization, for example by heating in DBU to a<br>
temperature between 100 and 200 °C, or by treatment with a radical source such as iodine and UV light under conditions that would be well known to one skilled in the art. The. order .of ring formation ans side chain  installation may be reversed as.shown in Schemes 11-13. Scheme 8<br>

The compounds of the present invention can be formulated and administered in a wide variety of oral and parenteral dosage forms, including transdermal and rectal administration. It will be recognized to those skilled in the art that the following dosage forms may comprise as the active component, either a compound of Formula I or a corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate of a compound of Formula I.<br>
This invention also comprises a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I together with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient therefor. For preparing pharmaceutical compositions with the compounds of the present invention, pharmaceuticallyacceptable carriers can-be either a solid or-liquid. Solid form-preparations include powders, tablets, pills, capsules, cachets, suppositories, and dispensable granules. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluents, flavoring agents, binders, preservatives, tablet disintegrating agents, or an encapsulating material.<br>
In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid such as talc or starch which is in a mixture with the finely divided active component. In tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired.<br>
The formulations of this invention preferably contain from about 5% to about 70% or more of the active compound. Suitable carriers include magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like. A preferred form for oral use are capsules, which include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as a carrier providing a capsule in which the active component with or without other carriers, is surrounded by a carrier, which is thus in association with it. Similarly, cachets and lozenges are included. Tablets, powders, capsules, pills, cachets, and lozenges can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration.<br>
For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax, such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter, is first melted and the active component is dispersed homogeneously therein, as by stirring. The molten homogenous mixture is then poured into convenient size molds, allowed to cool, and thereby to solidify.<br>
Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions such as water or water/propylene glycol solutions. For parenteral injection, liquid preparations can be formulated in solution in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution, isotonic saline, 5% aqueous glucose, and the like. Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavors, stabilizing and thickening agents as desired. Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water and mixing with a viscous material, such as natural or synthetic gums, resins,<br>
methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, or other well-known suspending agents.<br>
Also included are solid form preparations that are intended to be converted; shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for oral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. These preparations may contain, in addition to the active component, colorants, flavors, stabilizers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispersants, thickeners, solubilizing agents, and the like. Waxes, polymers, microparticles, and the like can be utilized to prepare sustained-release dosage forms. Also, osmotic pumps can be employed to deliver the active compound uniformly over a prolonged period.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations of the invention are preferably in unit dosage form. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form.<br>
The therapeutically effective dose of a compound of Formula I will vary from approximately 0.01 mg/kg to approximately 100 mg/kg of body weight per day. Typical adult doses will be approximately 0.1 mg to approximately 3000 mg per day. The quantity of active component in a unit dose preparation may be varied or adjusted from approximately 0.1 mg to approximately 500 mg, preferably about 0.6 mg to 100 mg according to the particular application and the potency of the active component. The composition can, if desired, also contain other compatible therapeutic agents.

To 4-cyclopentylamino-2-methylsulfanyl-pyrimidine-5-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (92 g, 8 mmol) in THF (80 mL) at -20 °C under nitrogen was added pyridine (2.6 mL, 32 mmol) followed by TiCL, (1.75 mL, 16 mmol) in CH2C12 (20 mL). The cold bath was removed and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction was quenched with water (10 mL) then diluted with ether and washed three times with saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution, then once with brine. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Removal of the drying agents and evaporation of the solvent gave a yellow oil that was used without further purification. This oil was dissolved in dry DMF (150 mL) and treated with l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (119 |iL, 0.8 mmol). The resulting solution was heated to 80 °C for 1 h then allowed to cool to room temperature and diluted with ethyl acetate. This mixture was washed with water then with saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution (3 times), then with brine. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, then filtered and the solvents removed in vacuo to provide a brown oil which crystallized to give a yellow solid upon standing at room temperature. This solid was collected by filtration and rinsed with ethyl acetate then<br>
dried in vacuo. The filtrate was concentrated and chromatographed on silica gel eluting with 20-50% ethyl acetate in hexanes to give additional product as a solid upon removal of the solvents. The two solids were combined to provide the desired product, 8-cyclopentyl-2-methylsulfanyl-7-oxo-7,8-dihydro-pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (1.2 g,) in 42% over the two steps.

After filtering and removal of the solvents, the crude product was chromatographed on silica gel eluting with 50-65% ethyl acetate in hexanes to give an orange gum (0.298 g). This gum was dissolved in CH2C12 and washed with 10% KF in H2O, then brine and dried (MgSO4). Following removal of the drying agent and evaporation of the solvent, the remaining material was dissolved in ethyl acetate (10 mL) and treated with 1 M HC1 (aqueous). The resulting mixture was stirred vigorously for 1 h at room temperature. Sufficient CH2C12 was added to dissolve the precipitate that had formed and the organic solution was washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution. The aqueous layer was back extracted twice with CH2C12 and the combined organic layers were dried (MgSO4). Removal of the drying agent and evaporation of the solvent gave a foamy solid, which was dissolved in ethyl acetate (20 mL) and filtered then diluted with an equal volume of hexanes and stored at 4 °C. The yellow crystals that formed were collected by filtration and dried in vacuo to give 6-acetyl-2-{5-[bis-(2-methoxy-ethyl)-amino]-pyridin-2-ylamino}-8-cyclopentyl-5-methyl-8H-pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-one (120 mg, 32%).

Biological Assays<br>
To determine the inhibitory potency and selectivity of-compounds of the present invention against Cdk4 and related kinases, compounds were evaluated in standard assays routinely used to measure inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase enzymes and other protein kinases (see for example D. W. Fry et al, J. Biol. Chem. 2001,276", 16617-16623). The assays were carried out as described below.<br>
Assay for inhibition of Cdk2/Cyclin A<br>
Cdk2 enzyme assays for IC50 determinations and kinetic evaluation are<br>
performed as follows. 96-well filter plates (Millipore MADVN6550) are used. The final assay volume is 0.1 mL containing buffer A (20 mM TRIS (tris[hydroxymethyl]aminomethane) (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol,<br>
10 mM MgCl2), 12 mM ATP containing 0.25 µCi [32P]ATP, 20 ng Cdk2/cyclin A,<br>
1 ng retinoblastoma protein, and the test compound at appropriate dilutions in buffer A (Buffer A alone without added test compound was employed as a control for no inhibition. Buffer A containing excess EDTA was used to determine the level of background 32P in the absence of enzyme activity). All components except the ATP are added to the wells, and the plate is placed on a plate mixer for 2 minutes. The<br>
reaction is initiated by addition of [32p]ATP, and the plate is incubated at 25°C for 15 minutes. The reaction is terminated by addition of 0.1 mL 20% TCA. The plate is kept at 4°C for at least 1 hour to allow the substrate to precipitate. The wells are then<br>
washed five times with 0.2 mL 10% TCA, and 32p incorporation is determined with a beta plate counter (Wallac Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The IC50 of the test compound was determined using the median effect method (Chou, T-C and Talalay, P. Applications of the median effect principle for the assessment of low-dose risk of carcinogens and for the quantitation of synergism and antagonism of chemotherapeutic agents. In: New Avenues in Developmental Cancer Chemotherapy (Eds. Harrap, K. T. and Connors, T. A.), pp. 37-64. Academic Press, New York, 1987).<br>
Assav for inhibition of Cdk4/Cyclin D<br>
The Cdk4 enzyme assay for IC50 determination and kinetic evaluation is performed as follows. 96-well filter plates (Millipore  MADVN65500) are used, The total volume is 0.1 mL containing buffer A (20 mM TRIS (tris[hydroxymethyl]aminomethane) (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol,<br>
10 mM MgCl2), 25 µM ATP containing 0.25 µCi [32P]ATP, 20 ng Cdk4,1 µg<br>
retinoblastoma protein and the test compound at appropriate dilutions in buffer A. Buffer A alone without added test compound was employed as a control for no inhibition. Buffer A containing excess EDTA was used to determine the level of background 32P in the absence of enzyme activity. All components except the ATP are added to the wells, and the plate is placed on a plate mixer for 2 minutes. The<br>
reaction is started by adding [32P]ATP, and the plate is incubated at 25°C for<br>
15 minutes. The reaction is terminated by addition of 0.1 mL 20% trichloroacetic acid<br>
(TCA). The plate is kept at 4°C for at least 1 hour to allow the substrate to precipitate.<br>
The wells are then washed five times with 0.2 mL 10% TCA, and 32P incorporation is determined with a beta plate counter (Wallac Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The IC50 of the test compound was determined using the median effect method (Chou, T-C and Talalay, P. Applications of the median effect principle for the assessment of low-dose risk of carcinogens and for the quantitation of synergism and antagonism of chemotherapeutic agents. In: New Avenues in Developmental Cancer Chemotherapy (Eds. Harrap, K. T. and Connors, T. A.), pp. 37-64. Academic Press, New York, 1987).<br>
Assay for inhibition of FGFr<br>
For FGF receptor (FGFr) tyrosine kinase assays 96-well plates (100 µL/incubation/well), and conditions are optimized to measure the incorporation of 32P from [y32P]ATP into a glutamate-tyrosine co-polymer substrate. Briefly, to each well is added 82.5 JJL incubation buffer B (25 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100,0.2 mM PMSF, 0.2 mM Na3VO4,10 mM MnCl2) and 750 µg/mL Poly (4:1) glutamate-tyrosine followed by 2.5 pL of the test compound in buffer B and 5 uL of a 7.5 µg/µL FGFr solution to initiate the reaction. Following a<br><br>
10-minute incubation at 25°C, 10 mL [y32P]ATP (0.4 µCi plus 50 µM ATP) is added<br>
to each well, and samples are incubated for an additional 10 minutes at 25°C. The<br>
reaction is terminiated by the addition of 100 µL 30% trichloroacetic acid (TCA)<br>
containing 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate and precipitation of material onto glass<br>
fiber mats (Wallac). Filters are washed three times with 15% TCA containing<br>
100 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and the radioactivity retained on the filters is counted<br>
in a Wallac 1250 Betaplate reader. Nonspecific activity is defined as radioactivity<br>
retained on the filters following incubation of samples with buffer alone (no enzyme).<br>
Specific enzymatic activity (enzyme plus buffer) is defined as total activity minus<br>
nonspecific activity. The concentration of a test compound that inhibited specific<br>
activity by 50% (IC50) is determined based on the inhibition curve.<br>
