				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
NITROGENOUS HETEROCYCLIC DERIVATIVE AND MEDICINE CONTAINING THE SAME AS AN ACTIVE INGREDIENT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic derivative which is useful as medicament and a drug containing the same as the active ingredient.<br>
Explaining in more detail about the present invention, it relates to<br>
(1)	a compound represented by formula (I)<br><br>
(wherein all symbols have the same meanings as described hereinafter.), a salts thereof, an N-oxide thereof or a solvate thereof, or prodrugs thereof,<br>
(2)	treatment and/or prevention for CCR5-related diseases comprising compounds represented by formula (I), a salt thereof, an N-oxide thereof or a solvate thereof, or prodrugs thereof, as an active ingredient, and<br>
(3)	a process for the preparation thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Chemokine is known as an endogeneous basic protein having leukocyte chemotactic and activating abilities and strong heparin-binding abilities. At present, it is considered that chemokine is related to not only the control of infiltration of specific leukocyte at the time of inflammations and immune responses but also the development and homing of lymphocyte under physiological conditions and migration of hemocyte precursor cells and somatic cells.<br>
Differentiation, proliferation and cell death of hemocytes are controlled by various types of cytokine. In the living body, inflammations are found topically and differentiation, maturation and the like of lymphocytes are carried out at certain specified sites. That is, various necessary cells migrate into certain specified sites and accumulate therein to cause a series of inflammations and immune responses. Accordingly, migration of cells is also an indispensable phenomenon in addition to differentiation, proliferation and death of cells.<br>
Migration of hemocytes in the living body starts firstly in the development stage  by  the  shift  of hematopoiesis  started  in the  AGM  region  into  permanent<br><br>
hematopoiesis in bone marrow via fetal liver. Furthermore, precursor cells of T cells and thymus dendritic cells migrate from the fetal liver into the bone marrow and then into the thymus gland and cytodifferentiate under thymus environment. The T cell which received clone selection migrates into secondary lymphoid tissues and takes part in an immune response in the periphery. The Langerhans1 cell of the skin activated and differentiated by capturing an antigen migrates into the T cell region of a topical lymph node and activates naive T cell therein as a dendritic cell. The memory T cell performs its homing again into the lymph node via lymphatic and blood vessels. Also, B cell, T cell in the intestinal epithelium, γ δ T cell, NKT cell and dendritic cell migrate from bone marrow without passing through the thymus gland and differentiate to take part in an immune response.<br>
Chemokine deeply takes part in the migration of such various cells. Chemokine receptors are greatly related to the control of inflammation and immune responses through a mechanism in which they are expressed at certain specified periods in variously specific cells and the effector cells are accumulated in a region where chemokine is produced.<br>
For example, it is reported an investigation in animal models such as CCR5-knockout mouse suggesting that CCR5 as a chemokine receptor plays a significant role in rejection in organ transplantation or autoimmune disease, etc. (Transplantation, Vol.72(7), 1199-1205 (2001); Diabetes, Vol.51(8), 2489-2495 (2002); Journal ofVirology, Vol.77(l), 191-198 (2003); Journal of Immunology, Vol. 164(12), 6303-6312 (2000)). It is also reported which make a comparison a risk of developing several diseases and a length of the survival of the transplanted graft, etc. between a human having inactive CCR and a human having wild-type one (Ref. The Lancet, Vol.357, 1758-1761 (2001); Arthritis &amp; Rheumatism, Vol.42(5), 989-992 (1999); The Lancet, Vol.354, 1264-1265 (1999); European Journal of Immunogenetics, Vol.29(6) 525-528 (2002)). It is suggested that CCR5 is related to several diseases, but they make no reference to the effect of drugs which antagonizes CCR in their reports.<br>
At present, immunosuppressive treatment for diseases in transplantation area is provided. That is, a calcineurin inhibitor such as cyclosporin or tacrolimus (FK506) is used mainly with various type of an immunosuppressant agent, for example, a TOR (target of rapamycin) inhibitor such as sirolimus (rapamycin), a non-specific antiphlogistic such as corticosteroids, an antiproliferative drug such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, etc. But, it frequently causes a chronic rejection or a severe side effect, so it is desired a useful novel immunosuppressant agent which prolongs a length of the survival of the transplanted graft and reduces the side effects in comparison with existing drugs.<br>
An antiinflammatory drug or a drug which modulates immune function such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSACDs) which have an inhibitory activity against<br><br>
cyclooxygenase (COX), disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARDs), steroids, etc. is used for treatment for autoimmune disease or allergic diseases. The more effective a drug is, the severer a side effect caused by it is, and it is suggested that the treatment with these drugs is not an underlying remedy for the disease, but a mere symptomatic treatment.<br>
At the same time, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (hereinafter referred to as "AIDS") which is induced by human immunodeficiency virus (hereinafter referred to as "HIV") is one of the diseases of which their therapeutic methods are most earnestly desired in recent years. Once infection with HIV is completed in a CD4-positive cell which is a principal target cell, HIV repeats its proliferation in the body of the patient and, sooner or later, completely destroγ δ T cell which takes charge of the immunological function. During this process, the immunological function is gradually reduced to cause fever, diarrhea, lymph node enlargement and the like various immunodeficiency conditions which are apt to cause complications with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and the like various opportunistic infections. Such conditions are the onset of AIDS, and it is well known that they induce and worsen Kaposi sarcoma and the like malignant tumors.<br>
As the recent preventive and/or therapeutic methods for AIDS, attempts have been made to, e.g., (1) inhibit growth of HIV by the administration of a reverse transcriptase inhibitor or a protease inhibitor and (2) prevent or alleviate opportunistic infections by the administration of a drug having immunopotentiation activity.<br>
Helper T cells which take charge of the central of immune system are mainly infected with HIV. It is known since 1985 that HIV uses the membrane protein CD4 expressing on the membrane of T cells in the infection (Cell, 52, 631 (1985)). The CD4 molecule is composed of 433 amino acid residues, and its expression can be found in macrophages, some B cells, vascular endothelial cells, Langerhans' cells in skin tissues, dendritic cells in lymphoid tissues, glia cells of the central nervous system and the like, in addition to the mature helper T cells. However, since it has been revealed that the infection with HIV is not completed by the CD4 molecule alone, a possibility has been suggested on the presence of factors other than the CD4 molecule, which are related to the infection of cells with HIV.<br>
CCR5, which is a receptor of RANTES, MIP-1α and MIP-1β, is also used at the time of the infection with a macrophage tropic (R5) HIV (Science, 222, 1955 (1996)).<br>
Accordingly, substances which can compete with CCR5 for HIV, or which can bind to HIV virus thus causing the virus unable to bind to CCR5, could become HIV infection inhibitors.<br>
It is also reported a possibility that the CCR5 is used in the infection with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (hereinafter referred to as "RSV").<br><br>
It is reported that CCR5 are expressed in arteriosclerotic plaque, so it is considered that chemokine receptor modulators are also useful in treating cardiovascular diseases.<br>
Based on the above, it is considered that chemokine (for example, RANTES, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, etc.) receptors, especially CCR5 are deeply related to the inflammation, immunological diseases, infectious diseases (infection with HIV, infection with RSV, etc.), and cardiovascular diseases. For example, it is considered that they are related to various inflammatory diseases (asthma, nephritis, nephropathy, hepatitis, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis, etc.), immunological diseases (autoimmune diseases, rejection in organ transplantation (rejection of graft of solid organ, rejection of graft of pancreatic islet cells in therapy for diabetes, graft-versus-host disease, etc.), immunosuppression, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, etc.), infectious diseases (infection with human immunodeficiency virus, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, infection with RSV, etc.), allergic diseases (atopic dermatitis, urticaria, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, allergic eosinophilic gastroenteritis, etc.), cardiovascular diseases (arteriosclerosis, ischemic reperfiision injury, etc.), acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock accompanying bacterial infection, diabetes mellitus, cancer metastasis and the like.<br>
It is reported that the aminopiperidine derivatives represented by formula (Z)<br><br>
(wherein R4Z is hydrogen atom, Cl-12 alkyl, C3-8 cycloalkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, aryl-C(=0)- or aryl-CH(OH)-, R5Z is hydrogen, Cl-12 alkyl, Cl-4 alkoxy, halogen or COR, R6Z is hydrogen, Cl-12 alkyl or substituted Cl-4 alkyl.    With the proviso that the definition of<br><br>
each symbol is an excerpt partially.) are useful as inhibitors of the chemokine receptors (ref specification of WO02/079186).<br>
It is described that the sulfonic acid compounds represented by formula (W)<br><br>
(wherein Xw is -0-, -S-, -CH2- or -NR6-, Yw is C6-10 aryl or C2-9 heteroaryl, R1W is selected from the group consisting of: H-, HO-, halo-, C1-8 alkyl- optionally substituted with 1-3 fluorine atoms, etc., R2W and R3W is selected from the group consisting of: H-, oxo, C1-8 alkyl- optionally substituted with 1-3 fluorine atoms, etc., R4W is selected from the group consisting of: H-, H0-, halo-, NC-, etc., R5W is Cl-8 alkyl, aW is 0-5, bW is 0-2, cW is 0-2, and dW is 0-4. With the proviso that the definition of each symbol is an excerpt partially.), pharmacological acceptable salts thereof and prodrugs thereof are selective antagonists of CCR1 (ref. specification of WO02/102787).<br>
Moreover, l-(4-pyridyl)-piperazine derivatives are described as CCR5 antagonists (ref. specification of US6,391,865).<br>
On the other hand, it is reported that triazaspiro[5.5]undecane derivatives, quaternary ammonium salts thereof or N-oxides thereof, or pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof regulate the effect of chemokine/chemokine receptor, so they are used for prevention and/or treatment of various inflammatory diseases, asthma, atopic dermatitis, urticaria, allergic diseases (allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis or allergic eosinophilic gastroenteritis etc.), nephritis, nephropathy, hepatitis, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, ischemic reperfiision disorder, multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cytotoxic shock, diabetes, autoimmune disease, in transplanted organ rejection reactions, immunosuppression, cancer metastasis and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (ref specification of WOO 1/40227).<br>
It is described that the compounds represented by formula (M)<br><br><br>

The alkylation is well known. For example, it may be carried out in an organic solvent (e.g., dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide), in the presence of alkaline (e.g., potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, triethylamine, etc.), and in the presence or absence of sodium iodide or potassium iodide at about 0 to 150°C.<br>
The amidation is known.   For example, it includes the method<br>
(1)	via an acyl halide,<br>
(2)	via a mixed acid anhydride,<br>
(3)	using a condensing agent.<br>
These methods are explained as follows.<br>
(1)	The method via an acyl halide may be carried out, for example, by reacting carboxylic acid with an acyl halide (e.g., oxalyl chloride or thionyl chloride) in an organic solvent (e.g., chloroform, dichloromethane, diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran) or without a solvent at about -20°C to reflux temperature. And then the obtained acyl halide derivative may be reacted with amine in an organic solvent (e.g., chloroform, dichloromethane, diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran) in the presence of a base (e.g., pyridine, triethylamine, dimethylaniline, dimethylaminopyridine or diisopropylethylamine etc.) at about 0 to 40°C.

And then the obtained mixed acid anhydride derivative may be reacted with amine in an organic solvent (e.g., chloroform, methylene chloride, diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran), at about 0 to 40°C.<br>
(3)	The method using a condensing agent may be carried out, for example, by reacting   carboxylic   acid   with   amine   in   an   organic   solvent   (e.g.,   chloroform,<br><br>
dichloromethane, dimethylformamide, diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran) or without a solvent, in the presence or absence of a base (e.g., pyridine, triethylamine, dimethylaniline or dimethylaminopyridine), using a condensing agent (e.g., 1,3-dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (DCC), l-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl] carbodiimide (EDC), l,r-carbodiimidazole (CDI), 2-chloro-l-methylpyridinium iodide, or 1-propanephosphonic acid cyclic anhydride (PPA)), in the presence or absence of 1-hydroxybenzotiazole (HOBt), at about 0 to 40°C.<br>
The reaction described in (1), (2) and (3) may be carried out under an inert gas (e.g., argon, nitrogen) to avoid water in order to obtain a preferable result.<br>
The sulfoneamidation is well known. For example, it may be carried out by reacting sulfonic acid with acyl halide (e.g., oxalyl chloride or thionyl chloride, phosphorus pentachloride or phosphorus trichloride) in an organic solvent (e.g., chloroform, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or tert-butyl methyl ether) or without a solvent at about -20°C to reflux temperature. And then the obtained sulfonyl halide derivative may be reacted with amine in an organic solvent (e.g., chloroform, dichloromethane, diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran) in the presence of a base (e.g., diisopropylethylamine, pyridine, triethylamine, dimethylaniline or dimethylaminopyridine etc.) at about 0 to 40°C.<br>

With regard to the protective group for carboxyl, hydroxyl, amino and mercapto, there is no particular limitation to the above ones so far as it is a group which is able to be easily and selectively detached. For example, a deprotection reaction may be carried out by a method mentioned in "T. W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc, 1999".<br><br>

The fact that the compound of the present invention has CCR5 antagonism is demonstrated, for example, by the following experiment. The total operation is based on the basic genetic engineering to prepare gene highly expressing cells, and the ordinary methods are utilized. Also, in the assaying method of the present invention, in order to evaluate the compound of the present invention, accuracy of measurement and/or sensitivity of measurement is improved as described below. The detailed experimental methods are shown below.<br>
(I) Inhibition test on the binding of RANTES to CCR5 (1) Isolation of human CCR5 gene<br>
Human placental cDNA is prepared using Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Clontech).   PCR primers hCCR5Xbal-Fl:<br>
5'-AGCTAGTCTAGATCCGTTCCCCTACAAGAAACTCTCC-3' (SEQ ID NO:l) and hCCR5Xbal-Rl:<br>
5'-AGCTAGTCTAGAGTGCACAACTCTGACTGGGTCACCA-3' (SEQ ID NO:2) are designed based on the sequence of GenBank U54994.<br>
Using the human placental cDNA as the template and using Ex Taq (Takara), PCR reaction (2 minutes at 95°C -^ (30 seconds at 95°C, 45 seconds at 60°C, 1 minute at 72°C) x 35 times) is carried out. The thus amplified PCR product is subjected to a 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QUIAGEN) and then digests with a restriction enzyme Xbal. The digested fragments are ligated to an expression vector pEF-BOS-bsr using DNA Ligation Kit Ver. 2 (Takara) and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5a. By preparing the resulting plasmid pEF-BOS-bsr/hCCR5, its DNA sequence is verified.<br>
(2)CulturingofCHOcell<br>
CHO-dhfr(-) is cultured using Ham's F-12 (containing fetal bovine serum (10%), penicillin (50 U/ml) and streptomycin (50 mg/ml)). Also, the transduced cell is cultured by adding blasticidin (5 mg/ml) to the above medium.<br><br>
(3)	Transduction into CHO cell<br>
The plasmid pEF-BOS-bsr/hCCR5 is transduced into the CHO-dhfr(-) cell using DMRIE-C reagent (Gibco BRL). After 48 hours, the medium is replaced with a medium containing 5 mg/ml of blasticidin to carry out the selection, thereby establishing a stably over-expressing cell.<br>
(4)	Inhibition test on the binding of chemokine (RANTES, MIP-1α and MIP-ip) to CCR5<br>
(activity of chemokine to induce transient increase of Ca ion).<br>
The thus established stable CHO cell overexpressing human CCR5 (CCR5/CHO cell) is suspended in Ham's F-12 medium containing FBS (10%) and seeded at a density of 3.0x106 cells/well into a 96-well plate. One day after culturing at 37°C, the culture supernatant is discarded, and Ham's F-12 medium (containing Fura-2AM (5 jiM), Probenecid (2.5 mM) and HEPES (20 mM; pH 7.4)) is dispensed in 80 |al/well portions to carry out 1 hour of incubation at 37°C under shaded condition. After washing twice with lx Hanks/HEPES (20 mM; pH 7.4) solution, the same solution is dispensed in 100μ1/well portions. Each of the test compounds is added to the thus Fura-2AM-incorporated CCR5/CHO cell, and 3 minutes thereafter, a recombinant human CCR5 ligand (RANTES, MIP-1α or MIP-1β) (PeproTach) diluted with lx Hanks/HEPES (20 mM; pH 7.4) solution is added thereto to a final concentration (Rantes: 10 nM; MIP-la: 30 nM; MIP-1β: 30 nM). Transient increase in the intracellular Ca concentration induced by the human CCR5 ligand is measured using a Ca detector for 96 well use (Hamamatsu Photonics), and inhibition ratio (%) of the test compound is calculated by the following calculation formula.<br>
Inhibition ratio = (Ec - Ea)/Ec x 100<br>
Ec:        measured value of Ca2+ transient increase by CCR5 ligand Ea:        measured value of Ca   transient increase by CCR5 ligand when a test compound is added.<br>
(II) Migration test of human CCR5 expressing cell (hCCR5-Ba/F3 cell): (1) Establishment of human CCR5 expressing cell (1-A) Isolation of human CCR5 gene<br>
The isolation is carried out according to the method of the isolation of human CCR5 gene as described in the above method (I)-(l).<br>
(1-B) Culturing of Ba/F3 cell<br>
Ba/F3 cells are statically cultured by using RMMI-1640 medium (Gibco BRL) containing antibiotics (Antibiotic-Antimycotic) (final concentration: penicillin G sodium (100 U/ml), streptomycin sulfate (100 |ug/ml), amphotericin B (0.25 M-g/ml) (Gibco BRL),<br><br>
plate for fluorescence assay, and uses as an assay sample for migrated cell numbers (final: 100 Ml/well).<br>
Next, Cell Titer-Glo Reagent (trade name, Promega) which is previously prepared at room temperature is added to the above assay sample for migrated cell numbers (100 μ1/well/well), followed by gently mixing (300 rpm, 2 min with KA-SCHUTTLER MTS4) for lysating the cells, the mixture is incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes, and the fluorescence is measured with wallac ARVO SX 1420 MULTILABEL COUNTER (trade name, Perkin Elmer) (detection by count/second).<br>
The migrated cell numbers (naturally falling cell numbers) at a chemokine concentration of 0 nmol/1 is used as the background, and the inhibition ratio of the test compound against the 0.1% DMSO control group is calculated.<br>
The inhibition migration ratio (%) of the test compound is calculated by the following equation:<br><br>
Ec:        (fluorescence measured value at the addition of 0.1% DMSO) - (fluorescence measured value of the naturally falling cells)<br>
Ea:        (fluorescence measured value at the addition of the test compound) -(fluorescence measured value of the naturally falling cells)<br>

Biological Example 6<br>
Model of renal allotransplantation in cynomolgus monkeγ δ To evaluate immunosuppressive<br>
effect of the compound of the present invention:<br>
Cynomolgus monkeys (body weight : 3-4.5 kg) that were ABO-compatible, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -different, more specifically, MLR miss-matched donor (male) -recipient (either sex) combinations underwent bilateral nephrectomy with subsequent implantation of an allogenic kidney from a selected donor animal. A test substance (a compound of the present invention and/or an immunosuppressant agent) was administered daily starting on Day-1 (the day before transplantation) until the day before rejection was defined. The efficacy was assessed by comparing the length of the survival of the transplanted kidney.<br>
The compound of the present invention was administered in combination with subtherapeutic immunosuppressant agent on the market (Cyclosporine, sirolimus, and/or tacrolimus). The efficacy was demonstrated by comparing with administration of immunosuppressant agent alone.<br>
The compound of the present invention was administered, for example, per os (PO), twice a day at a dose level of 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg.<br>
For example, the presence of rejection was suspected if the serum creatinine levels rise. In particular, rejection of transplanted kidney was defined as an increase in the serum creatinine levels to 8 mg/dL.<br>
As a result, the compound of the present invention showed an immunosuppressive effect in the model of renal allotransplantation in cynomolgus monkeys.<br>
